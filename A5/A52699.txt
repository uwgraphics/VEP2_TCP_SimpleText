THE Lambs War AGAINST The Man of Sin;
THE End of it, the manner of it, and what he wars against.
AND How all may know whether they be in it, or no; and whether the same Christ
be in them that is, was, and is to come, and their faithfulness or
unfaithfulness to him.
THE Lord God Almighty, to whom belongs all the kingdoms in heaven and earth,
does nothing therein but by his Son, the Lamb, by him he creates and governs;
by him he saves and condemns; judges and justifies* makes peace, and makes war,
and whatsoever he does, he is at his right hand in all places, who in him has
long suffered the burden of iniquity, and oppression of wickedness that has
abounded for many generations, till it be come to the full measure, as in the
days of old; and now his appearance in the Lamb (as ever it was when iniquity
was full) is to make war with the god of this world, and to plead with his
Subjects concerning their revolt from him their Cre^^or, who ordered their
beginning, and gave them a being, and their breaking the order that was in the
beginning, and giving up their obedience to the worldly spirit, and the
inventions thereof, til they become so far one with it, as that it has not
only defiled their souls and bodies, blinded their eyes, stopped their ears,
and so made the creature utterlie unprofitable to God, and unfit for a Temple
for him to be worshipped in, or to hear the voice, or understand the mind of
the eternal Spirit, by which they was created, but that they are also become
open enemies to every check and reproof of that Spirit which should lead them
to God, and does testify against their evil deeds, and are not afraid to speak
against it as a thing not worth the minding, nor able to lead them in the way
of truth. Thus has God lost the creature out of his call and service, and he
is become one with the god of this world, to serve and obey him in ways that
despite the spirit of Grace; and now use the Creation against the Creator. Now
against this evil seed, and its whole work brought forth in that nature, does
the LAMB make war to take vengeance of his Enemies.

The end of his War is,
TO judge this deceiver openly before all the Creation, showing that his
ways, fashions, and customs, are not what God ordered for man to live in, in
the beginning, to bind him and to redeem out of his captivity, all who will
but believe in the Lamb, and are weary of this service and bondage to his
Enemy, and who will but come forth and give their names and hearts to join
with him, and bear his image and testimony openly before all men, and
willingly follow him in such ways as wherein the Father has given him
victory over this power, for himself and all that follow him, to redeem them
to God, and the rest who will not believe and follow him, and bear his image,
them to condemn with the destroyer into everlasting destruction, and to restore
all things, and make all things new, as they were in the beginning, that God
alone may rule in his own work.

The manner of his War is,
FIrst, That he may be just who is to judge all men and spirits, he gives his
light into their hearts, even of man and woman, whereby he lets all see (who
will mind it) what he is displeased with, what is with him, and what is against
him; what he owns, and what he disowns, that so all may know what is for
destruction, to come out of it, lest they be destroyed with it, that so he may
save and receive all that are not wilfully disobedient, and hardened in the
pleasures of this world, against him; all who are deceived, who are willing to
be undeceived; all who are captivated, who are willing to be set free; all that
are in darkness, and are willing to come to light: In a word, All that loves
righteousness more then the pleasures of sin, that he may not destroy them,
nor they sight against him, and know not, but that he may receive them, to be
one with him against that which has misled and deceived them; and as many as
turn at his reproof, he does receive, and gives them power in spirit and life
to be as he is, in their measure, but all in watching, and wars against that
which has had them, and now has the restoe the Creation in bondage, that he
may restore all things in their former liberty.

What they are to war against.
AND that is, Whatever is not of God, whatever the eye (which loves the world)
lusts after; whatever the flesh takes delight in, and whatever stands in
respect of persons, (as says the Scripture) the lust of the eye, the lust of
the flesh, the pride of life, these are not of God; and whatever the god of
this world has begot in men's hearts to practice or to plead for, which God did
not place there, all this the Lamb and his Followers wars against, which is at
enmity with it both in themselves, and wherever they see it; for in the work
of God alon^ is his Kingdom, and all other works will he destroy. So their wars
is not against creatures, they wrestle not with flesh and blood which God has
made, but with spiritual wickedness, exalted in the hearts of men and women,
where God alone should be, and pleaded for, by which they become enemies to
God, and their souls are destroyed: Indeed, their war is against the whole work
and device of the god of this world, his Laws, his Customs, his Fashions, his
Inventions, and all which are to add to, or take from the work of God, which
was in the beginning, this is all enmity against the Lamb and his followers,
who are entered into the Covenant which was in the beginning, and therefore no
wonder why they are hated of the god of this world, and his subjects, who comes
to spoil him of all at once, and to destroy the whole body of sin, the
foundation and strength of his Kingdom, and to take the Government to himself,
that God may wholly rule in the heart of man, and man wholly live in the work
of God.

What their Weapons are.
AND as they war not against men's persons, so their Weapons are not carnal, nor
hurtful to any of the Creation; for the Lamb comes not to destroy men's lives,
nor the work of God, and therefore at his appearance in his subjects, he puts
spiritual weapons into their hearts and hands; Their Armor is the Light; their
sword the spirit of the Father and the Son; their Shield is Faith and Patience;
their paths are prepared with the Gospel of peace, and good will toward all
the Creation of God: Their Breast Plate is righteousness and holiness to God;
their minds are girt with godliness, and they are covered with salvation, and
they are taught with truth. And thus the Lamb in them, and they in him, goes
out in judgment and righteousness to make war with his enemies, conquering and
to conquer, not as the prince of this world in his subjects, with whips, and
prisons, tortures, and torments on the bodies of creatures, to kill and destroy
men's lives, who are deceived, and so become his enemies; but he goes forth in
the power of the spirit with the word of truth, to pass judgment upon the
head of the serpent, which does deceive and bewitch the world, and covers his
own with his love, whilst he kindles coals of fire on the head of his enemies;
for with the spirit of judgment, and with the spirit of burning will he plead
with his enemies: and having kindled the fire, and awakened the creature, and
broken their peace and rest in sin, he waits in patience to prevail to recover
the creature, and slay the enmity by suffering all the rage, and envy, and
evil entreatings, that the evil spirit that rules in the creature, can cast
upon him, and he receives it all with meekness and pity to the creature,
returning love for hatred, wrestling with God against the enmity, with prayers
and tears night and day, with fasting, mourning, and lamentation, in patience,
in faithfulness, in truth, in love unfeigned, in long-suffering, and in all
the fruits of the spirit, that if by any means he may overcome evil with good,
and by this his light in the light of the creature, that the eye may come to be
opened, which the god of this world has blinded, that so the creature might
see what it is he thus hates, and what fruits he himself brings forth, that
the creature may be convinced, he is no deceiver, but has with him the life
and power of innocence and holiness, in whom he rules; and this preaching
has a power in it to open the eye of all that are not wilfully blind, because
they love the deeds of darkness, and such are left thereby without excuse for
ever; and thus he in his members many times wrestles and preaches to the
spirits in prison, with much long-suffering toward the world, a Nation, or a
particular person, before he gives them up, and numbers them for destruction,
yea, sometimes till their rage against him, and cruelty exercised upon his
members be so great, that there be no remedy, as in the days of old 2 Chronicles.
36. 15, 16.

And these Fruits are his Colors he holds forth to all the world in such as he
reigns in.
AS they come to obey him, he covers them with love, gentienesse, faith,
patience, and purity, grace and virtue, temperance, and self-denial, meekness,
and innocence, all in white, that follow him, in whom he is, who walks
themselves as he walked, in all things conforming to God, with boldness and
zeal, owning the Lamb to be their Leader, with him testifying against the
world, That the deeds thereof are evil, themselves the mean while covered with
his Righteousness against all the storms and tempests that they must be sure
to meet withal who bears that Testimony which the Lamb has ever borne, in
whom he appeared to the convincing of the world, that he is the same that ever
he was from the beginning, that all that will believe and loves holiness may
see where it is to be found, and come forth to him, and be saved, that the
whole world become not as Sodom in the day of wrath, which ever comes upon a
people or a Nation after Christ has thus appeared, and been rejected thereof.

What his Kingdom is.
THE Power, the Glory, and Compass of it, is not comprehended with mortal
understanding, which was before all beginnings, and endures for ever, who
orders and limits all spirits in Heaven and Earth, who rules in the Rulers of
the Earth, and in all heavenly places, though many spirits knows him not, til
they have felt his reproof for their rebellion against him; his sufferings are
free for loves sake, which is naturally in him to the Creation, being his
offspring, for which cause he becomes meek and lowly, that he may bear the
infirmities of the Creation, which does no way take from his power, who is
equal with the Father, but does manifest his power to be unlimited, in that he
bears all things, his Dominion he has amongst the Heathen, and his hands is
in the counsels of the Kings of the Earth, and there is no place where he is
not, who descends below all depths, and ascends far above all Heavens, that he
may fill all things.

But his Kingdom in this world, in which he chiefly delights to walk and make
himself known, is in the hearts of such as have believed in him, and owned his
call out of the world, whose hearts he has purified, and whose bodies he has
washed in obedience, and made them sit for the Father to be worshipped in; and
in such he rejoices and takes delight, and his Kingdom in such is
Righteousness and Peace; in love, in power and purity, he leads them by the
gentle movings of his spirit out of all their own ways and wills, in which they
would defile themselves, and guides them into the will of the Father, by which
they become, more clean and holy; deeply he lets them know his Covenant, and
how far they may go and be safe, he gives them his Laws and his Statutes,
contrary in all things to the god of this world, that they may be known to be
his before all his Enemies; if they keep his counsel, they are safe; but if
they refuse, he lets them know the correction of the Father; his presence is
great joy to them of a willing mind; but with the froward he appears in
frowardness; the kisses of his lips is life eternal: But who may abide his
wrath? the secrets of the Father are with him, and he makes all his Subjects
wise; he makes them all one heart, and with himself of the same mind; his
Government is wholly pure, and no unclean thing can abide his judgments: As
any come into his kingdom, they are known, and their change is to be seen of
all men; he keeps them low in mind, and a meek spirit does he beget in them;
and with his power he leads them forth against all the enmity of the evil one,
and makes all conditions comfortable to them who abides in his kingdom.

Now are these the last times, and many false Christ's there must appear, and be
made manifest by the true Christ, with their false Prophets, false Ways, and
false Worships, and false Worshippers, which though they be at wars one with
another, yet not the Lambs war. Now seeing he has appeared who is from
everlasting, and changes not, here is an everlasting trial for you all, all
sorts of professors, whether you profess him from the Letter, or the Light,
come try your Christ, measure your life, and weigh your profession with that
which cannot deceive you, which has stood, and will stand for ever, for he is
sealed of the Father.

Now in truth to God and your own souls, prove your work in time, left you and
it perish together: First see if your Christ be the same that was from
everlasting to everlasting, or is he changed according to the times, in life,
in death, in peace and wars, in reigning, in suffering, in casting out, and
receiving in; and if you find the true Christ, then prove your faithfulness
to him in all things: Does him whom you obey as your Leader, lead you out to
war against this world, and all the pride and glory, fashions and customs, love
and pleasures, and whatever else is not of God therein? and to give up your
lives unto death, rather then knowingly to yield your obedience thereto? Does
he justify any life now, but what he justified in the Prophets, and Apostl^s,
and Saints of old? Does he give his Subjects liberty now to bow to the god of
this world, and his ways, in things that he has denied in the Saints of old,
and for denying whereof, many both then and now have suffered? Is he at peace
in you, whilst you are in the fleshly pleasures, or whilst you have
fellowship with the unclean spirits that are in the world? Does he not lead out
of the world, and to strive against it in watchings, fastings, prayers, and
strong cries to the Father, that you may be kept, and others delivered from the
bondage and pollutions of it? Is his Kingdom the same in you? And does he give
out the same spiritual Laws against all the Laws and customs of the man of
sin in you, as he has done in his subjects in all ages? Does he beget in
your hearts a new nature, contrary to the worlds nature in all things, motions
and delights like himself, whereby he works out the old nature that inclines to
the world, and can be at peace therein, and now your peace is wholly in him,
and that which crucifies the world to you, and you to it, is your joy and
delight? Has he called you out of this world, to bear his Name before the
powers thereof, and put his testimony into your hearts, and the same Weapons
into your hands, as was used by the Saints of old against the powers of
darkness, whereby you have power given to overcome evil with good, and many
other fruits you may find, which he ever brought forth in his chosen, whereby
they was known to be in him, and he in them, for which the world hates them; by
all which you may clearly know if he be the same in you to day, as he was
yesterday in his people, and for ever; for he changes not, nor conforms to the
world, nor the will of any creature, but changes all his followers, till they
become in all things like himself; for they must bear his Name and Image before
all men and spirits.

Now if you profess the same as was, and is, and is to come, the same for
evermore, the same Christ, the same calling in you that was in all the people
of God, then prove your faithfulness in answering and obeying: Who is it that
sees not that wars is begun? and to whom has not the sound gone forth? The
children of light has published the Gospel of Light through the world, and the
Prince of darkness has showed his enmity against it; the Lamb has appeared
with his Weapons as beforementioned, in much long-suffering, and the god of
this world has appeared to withstand him with his Weapons, and has prevailed
unto blood with much eagerness; and the Lamb has prevailed unto suffering
with much meekness and patience, each of them in their Subjects, in whom these
contrary spirits acts one against another; and now see what part you take, who
has hired you, and whose work are you in, or are you idle, looking on? Or are
you gone out with the Beast of the field, and regards nothing but your bellies
and pleasures? Does it not greatly concern you to try your estate, seeing all
must come speedily to an account for their lives and service? Are you such as
spend your time and strength in watching and praying to the Father of spirits
for your selves and the people of God, that they may be kept in the time of
temptation, and assaults of the evil one, who seeks his advantage on the weak
brethren, and for your enemies, that they may be delivered from under his
power, who are captivated by him at his will, to fulfill his lusts and envy,
and satisfy his wrath upon the innocent. And do you deny your selves of your
pleasures, profits, ease and liberty, that you may hold forth a chaste
conversation in the power and life of gentleness, meekeness, faithfulness and
truth, exercising a conscience void of offense toward God and all men, that
thereby you may shine forth in righteousness, so as to convince your enemies
whom you pray for; thus following him who lays down his life for his enemies;
Is this your war? and these your weapons? Is this your calling? and are you
faithful to him that has called you hereto, so as you can by no means bow to
the god of this world, nor his ways, though it were to save your lives or
credit in the world, or estates, and yet can serve the meanest creature in Gods
way, though to the loss of all? I beseech you be faithful to your own souls
herein: Do you find nothing in you that calls or moves this way, or reproves
the contrary? If there be, are you not such as quench the spirit, and put out
your own eye, and denies the Lambs call against your own lives? and if there be
not, then are you not dead members, cut off from Christ, and all your
profession is but a lie, and without Christ you are in the world? O that you
would prove your own selves; for there be many deceitful workers at this day of
his appearance, who do the work of the Lord negligently and deceitfully, and
many do their own work instead of his; and many are called, and for a while
abide, but in the time of hardship prove deceitful, and return to serve in the
world again, and take pleasure therein; others are called and convinced, but
com half out of the world, even ^s far as they ca^ ^o it without loss or shame,
but keep their covenant therewith still, in what makes most for their gain, or
earthly advantage or credit: othe^s have answered their call, and bin faithful
in the whole Covenant of the Lamb against the prince of this world, so far as
they have seen; but not minding the watch against the enemy, and not keeping
low in the fear, and zealous in the light, have suffered the simplicity to be
deceived, and are led back to the old beggarly rudiments of the world again,
and take that for their perfection and growth, which once they had vomited up;
and these expect great things in their work; but they are blinder then the
rest, and more to be pittyed, because of the simplicity that is deceived. Many
other grounds there be that brings not fruit to perfection, who are not found
faithful to him that has called them therein; so that now truth is, that many
are called, but few chosen and faithful; many are ashamed at the Lambs
appearance, it is so low, and weak, and poor, and contemptible, and many are
afraid seeing so great a power against him; many be at work in their
imaginations, to compass a kingdom to get power over sin, and peace of
conscience, but few will deny all to be led by the Lamb in a way they know not,
to bear his testimony and mark against the world, and suffer for it with him:
Now deceit has taught you to say, and may be you think it also, God forbid but
you should suffer with Christ til death; but come to the trial in deed and
truth; Does not he suffer under all the pride and pleasures of the flesh by all
manner of excess, by all manner of customs and fashions, not of God, but of the
world? is not all against him that is not of him and the Father? Is not the
lust of the eye, and of the flesh, and pride of life, his oppressors? And do
you that live in these things, and fashions, and plead for them, suffer with
him by them, or war with him against them? then would you be weary of them, and
not practice nor plead for them against him: This you will will find true in
the end, you cannot suffer with him, and serve his Enemies.

THE END.
