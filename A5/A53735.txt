TO My loving Neighbors and Christian Friends.
Brethren,
MY hearts desire and request unto God for you is, that ye may be saved: I say
the Truth in Christ also, I lie not, my conscience bearing me witness in the
Holy Ghost, that I have great Heaviness, and continual Sorrow in my Heart, for
them amongst you, who as yet walk disorderly, and not as beseems the Gospel,
little laboring to acquaint themselves with the Mystery of Godliness; for many
walk, of whom I have told you often weeping, and now tell you again with
Sorrow, that they are the Enemies of the Cross of Christ, whose end is
destruction, whose God is their Belly, who mind earthly things. You know
(Brethren) how I have been amongst you, and in what manner, for these few years
past; and how I have kept back nothing (to the utmost of the dispensation to me
committed) that was profitable unto you; but have showed you and taught you
publicly, and from House to House, testifying to all, Repentance toward God,
and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. Now with what Sincerity this has been
by me performed; with what Issue and Success by you received, God the righteous
Judge will one Day declare; for before him, must both you and I appear, to give
an account of the dispensation of the glorious Gospel amongst us: in the mean
while, the desire of my Heart is, to be Servant to the least of you in the Work
of the Lord. And that in any way, which I can conceive profitable unto you
either in your Persons or your Families. Now amongst my Endeavors in this
kind, after the Ordinance of Public Preaching the Word, there is not, I
conceive, any more needful, (as all will grant that know the Estate of this
Place, how taught of late days, how full of grossly ignorant Persons) then
Catechizing, which has caused me to set aside some Hours for the compiling of
these following, which also I have procured to be printed merely because the
least part of the Parish are able to read it in Writing, my Intention in them
being, principally, to hold out those necessary Truths, wherein you have been
in my Preaching more fully instructed: as they are, the use of them I shall
briefly present unto you.

1. The lesser Catechism may be so learned of the younger sort, that they may
be ready to answer to every Question thereof.

2. The greater will call to mind much of what has been taught you in public,
especially concerning the Person and Offices of Jesus Christ.

3. Out of that you may have help to instruct your Families in the lesser,
being so framed for the most part, that a Chapter of the one, is spent in
unfolding a Question of the other.

4. The texts of Scripture quoted, are diligently to be sought out and
pondered, that you may know indeed whether these things are so.

5. In reading the Word, you may have light into the meaning of many places, by
considering what they are produced to Confirm.

6. I have been sparing in the Doctrine of the Sacraments, because I have
already been so frequent in examinations about them.

7. The handling of moral Duties I have wholly omitted, because by God's
assistance I intend for you a brief Explication of the Lord's Prayer, and the
Ten Commandments, with some Articles of the Creed, not unfolded in these, by
themselves, by the way of Question and Answer.

Now in all this as the pains has been mine, so I pray that the Benefit may be
yours, and the Praise his, to whom alone any good, that is in this or any thing
else, is to be ascribed. Now the God of Heaven continue that Peace, Love, and
Amity amongst our selves, which hit herto has been unshaken, in these divided
Times, and grant that the Scepter and Kingdom of his Son may be gloriously
advanced in your hearts, that the things which concern your Peace may not be
hidden from your eyes in this your day: which is the daily Prayer of

Your Servant in the work of the Lord, J. O.
From my Study, Septem. the last.

Q. 3. Wherefore did God make man?
