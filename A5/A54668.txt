A Congratulatory ELEGY Offered up to the Earl of ESSEX, Upon his Investiture
with the Dignity of Lord Chamberlain.

By Thomas Philipot Master of Arts of Clare Hall in Cambridge.

London printed. 1641.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE ROBERT DEVOREUX Earl of Essex, Lord Chamberlain of his
Majesty's Household.
My Lord,

BE pleased to accept this grain of Incense, offered up to your name, on the
Altar of a real heart, and if I have erred in my devotion, style it the sin of
an hallowed ignorance, rather than the crime of any wild presumption; daigne
to confer upon me the Epithete of Superstitious rather than the attribute of
profane, since the latter issues from a defect of Worship, and the former
results from an excess of adoration. My Lord, your name is followed with such
a train of acclamations, that I should have appeared dull even to stupidity, if
I had not been wakened with their alarm, to the expression of my zeal, which I
have endeavored to improve by pouring it forth into this Congratulation, and
if it be too inconsiderable to entitle it self to so great a Patron, set upon
it the noble character of your mercy, and let it derive that from your charity,
which it could not hope to find from my self, the remission of many errors:
The lowest hearts are the fittest sacrifice for the highest. Altars. Therefore,
though this Poem cannot lay claim to your Lordships praise, suffer it to
pretend to your Lordships pity: though I have no sublimity of Fancy to
marshall me amongst the chiefest of Poets, yet I have humility, which shall
rank me amongst

The humblest of your Lordships adorers,

THOMAS PHILIPOT.

A Congratulatory Elegy offered up to the Earl of Essex upon his Investiture
with the Dignity of Lord Chamberlain.
My Lord,

TWere malice to your fame not to comply
With the worlds public joy, and amplify
My thoughts to such extent of mirth, they might
Digest themselves to action, and indite
Something to show that I had found the art,
To write with ink compounded with my heart;
For every vulgar spirit can improve
His joy to shouts, and can exhale his love
To clamorous acclamations, which he
Is easily steered to be that sympathy,
Which does the people in one vote combine,
And like a thread does all their hearts entwine:
So when a Lute string is but touched, each string
That does confine upon it seems to ring
A peal of music too, and the first note
Repeats, as it 'twas echoed forth by rote.
But when a Poet writes, he should distill,
And melt his very brain into his quill,
And strive to shake off all that envious weight
Of earth, which does controwle the growing height
Of his exalted thoughts, that being redeemed
From that rude heap of dross, which only teemed
With faint and sickly numbers, he might turn
All souls and fire which might so clearly burn.
The flame might from his ink all dregs assoil,
And that dull juice to air and spirit boil,
So that each drop his flowing pen lets fall
Might be like that too immateriall.
This I pretend to, if it be my crime,
T'ave wrapped my joy up in unseason'd rhyme,
I Will weep so many tears for this offense,
They shall to every line some salt dispense,
To which, although I could no brain impart,
Into each word I have distilled my heart,
For my extended joy did so dilate
Each angle of it, it did even estate
A Pleurisy upon it, which was then
Dissolved and scattered when 'twas by my pen
Extracted into verse, to celebrate
Your rising like a star in the sphere of State,
Who dart such cheerful beams forth that we might
Turn superstitious, and even court their light,
Which will to our enlivened State dispense
Such a benign propitious influence;
It will those clouds of discontent dispell
Which did before in our Horison dwell:
And may you in this Orb shine ever bright,
Not blear'd with any sullen mist or night,
Exhaled from black detraction, that you may
Still with your beams improve and guild our day,
Still may you in your course as you have begun,
Like Mercuries bright star, move nere the Sun,
Like Aarons Rod may your Staff fruitful be,
And bud each year, with a new Dignity,
May sprigges of hallowed Myrtle on it grow,
May peaceful Olive spring from thence, that so
The world may be induced at your Decease
To say your Staff became the tree of peace,
May you be still inskons'd in every heart,
That when pale Envy has discharged each dart,
She tipped with malice, against your name, and found
By their recoil they did her self but wound,
She may insert this in your Epitaph,
You innocence was whiter than your Staff,
And when Deaths frost your blooming Honor nips
And all your starlight suffers an Eclipse,
By an eternal night, and your great soul
Having thrown off that dust which did control
Her glorious flight, and purchased her release,
Soars up to Heaven, borne on the wings of peace
And innocence, as here a star you shone,
May you shine there a Constellation,
And make it by this brave retreat appear
You changed your life, that you might change your Spear,
Which this assertion will with truth improve,
That your decease was only a Remove,
And if weel'd know the tomb that is put in trust,
To be the Treasurer of your precious dust,
May it be found after a stock of cares
Spent in its search, orewhelm'd in good men's tears.
FINIS.
