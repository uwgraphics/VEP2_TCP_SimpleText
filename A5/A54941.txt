PROPOSALS For Printing a Third Edition of a Book Entitled Ludovici Le Blanc
Theses Theologicae. With considerable Additions.
WHereas Moses Pit, Bookseller, did in the year 1675. Print at London the
Theses Theologicae of Ludovicus Le Blanc, Professor of Divinity in the
University of Sedan; not only Reprinting those formerly Printed at Sedan in
Quarte, and sold at extravagant Rates; but also a far greater number of New
ones, which by the help of certain Eminent Divines he obtained from the Author
in his own handwriting, which Impression is now entirely sold off; and whereas
since the Author's death the said Moses Pit, by the Assistance of the same
Worthy Persons has obtained a considerable number of other Theses of the same
Author, fitted by himself for the Press before his death, which he concludes
will be very acceptable to the Learned World, as well from the favorable
Reception of the former Editions, as from the Approbation of several Judicious
and Learned Persons, who have seen the remaining Theses in the Authors M. S. S.
He the said Moses Pit, intending a New Edition of all the Theses of Ludovicus
Le Blanc, of which those already Printed contain 177 Sheets, and those in M. S.
S. as near as he can guess, will make 33 Sheets more, and the whole 210 Sheets.
In order hereunto offers these following Proposals to all such Persons as shall
be willing to Promote so Useful a Design.

I. That he the said M. Pit undertakes that all Gentlemen who shall please to
Subscribe, shall receive the said Book before Lady Day next, Printed on as good
Paper, and of the same Character with the Edition 1675, at the Rate of One
Penny per Sheet, paying Five Shillings in hand at the time of their
Subscription, for which the said M. Pit will give his Receipt under his Hand
and Seal, together with a Promise to perfect and deliver the said Book to each
Subscriber according to these Proposals, they Paying the Remainder of the Money
at the Delivery of the said Book.

II. He the said M. Pit promises, That if any person shall procure Six
Subscriptions, and Pay him Thirty Shillings; and as soon as the Work is
perfected, shall pay the Remainder of the Money, he shall have the Seventh Book
Gratis.

III. Whereas several persons have already the Theses of Lud. Le Blanc Printed
1675. and it is the great grievance of New Editions with Inlargements, that they
render former Editions invaluable, and utterly lost to such as have bought; for
the Remedy hereof in this case, he the said Moses Pit further proposes to
those that have the said Edition, that if they please to Subscribe for the
Additions only, and Pay Two Shillings and Six Pence before Michaelmas Day next
after the Date hereof, and the Remainder on Delivery, at the Rate of One Penny
a Sheet, shall receive the said Additions at the time prefixed. Given under my
hand this 12 day of June, 1682.
