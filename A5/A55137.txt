A Pleasant Spelling-Piece: Spelling the most variously Written Syllalables in
the BIBLE, or elsewhere, with such distinction, plain and delightful
demonstrations, that the least Reading Child may quickly become perfect in
spelling.

With such an Introduction INTO THE LATINE-tongue, As renders that whole
Tongue attainable With far less Charge to Memory, than the very Grammar-RULES
hitherto have been.

To this sweet Method let us all apply,
Leav't not to Rome, Spain, France, or Germany:
Who never well yet distinguished the Grounds of Speech,
Let us them teach, not they us I beseech.
