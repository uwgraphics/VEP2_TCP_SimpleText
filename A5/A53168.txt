WHereas the Lady Wentworth gives out in Speeches and otherwise, that she is
ready and willing to set aside her Privilege, and go to a Trial at Law with
the Lady Poole her Sister, and the Countess of Newbrough, for and concerning a
Debt of 6000 l. due and owing to them. But they are advised by Able Council
that they cannot safely proceed at Law: for if they should, they may be barred
by Pleas of no Assets, or nothing by Dissent or Minority. And also the Earl of
Cleaveland leaving no Personal Estate, and all his real Estate being vested in
Trustees; by those Acts they cannot be retained in any ordinary Course of Law
or Equity; nor can those seeming fair Offers aid them.

And in truth the Lady Wentworths Assurance to this Honorable House, are only
Words; for when the Lady Poole shall come to Law or Equity, neither of them can
give away the Infants Estate during the Minority; so that if she wave all she
pretends to, yet it is not in the power of the Law to help the Creditors, at
least during the Infants Minority. This is evident in the Case between Henry
Lyde and Mr. Bernardiston of Bedford, in which, Lyde the Mortgagee has been
kept out by Minority of several successive Infants, near 40 years, and is to
this day: Which Mortgagee if occasion shall require, will be produced; so that
in truth no Relief can be had but by Act of Parliament: And as it is alleged,
that the Lord of Cleaveland spent great part of his Estate by the Wars, it will
be proved upon Oath that he was so much in Debt, that he was forced to fly into
the Army for Shelter.
