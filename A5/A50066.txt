A DECLARATION OF THE GENERAL COURT OF THE MASSACHVSETS Holden at Boston in
New England, October 18. 1659. Concerning The execution of two Quakers.
ALthough the justice of our proceedings against William Robinson, Marmaduke
Stevenson, and Mary Dyer, Supported by the Authority of this Court, the Laws
of the Country; and the Law of God, may rather persuade us to expect
encouragement and commendation from all prudent and pious men, then convince us
of any necessity to Apologize for the same, yet for as much as men of weaker
parts, out of pity and commiseration (a commendable and Christian virtue yet
easily abused, and susceptible of sinister and dangerous impressions) for want
of full information, may be less satisfied, and men of perverser principles,
may take occasion hereby to calumniate us, and render us as bloody persecutors,
to satisfy the one, and stop the mouths of the other, we thought it requisite
to declare. That about three Years since, diverse persons, professing themselves
Quakers, (of whose pernicious Opinions and Practices we had received
intelligence from good hands, from Barbados to England, arrived at Boston)
whose persons were only secured, to be sent away by the first opportunity,
without censure or punishment, although their professed tenants, turbulent and
contemptuous behavior to Authority would have justified a severer
animadversion, yet the prudence of this Court, was exercised, only in making
provision to secure the Peace and Order here established, against their
attempts, whose design (we were well assured of by our own experience, as well
as by the example of their predecessors in Munster) was to undermine and ruin
the same, And accordingly a Law was made and published, prohibiting all Masters
of Ships, to bring any Quakers into this Jurisdiction, and themselves from
coming in, on penalty of the House of Correction, till they could be sent
away: Notwithstanding which, by a back Door, they found entrance, and the
penalty inflicted on themselves, proving insufficient to restrain their
impudent and insolent obtrusions, was increased by the loss of the ears of
those that offended the second time, which also being too weak a defense
against their impetuous frantic fury, necessitated us to endeavor our
security, and upon serious consideration, after the former experiments, by
their incessant assaults, a Law was made, that such persons should be banished,
on pain of Death, according to the example of England in their provision
against Jesuits, which sentence being regularly pronounced at the last Court
of Assistants against the parties above named, and they either returning, or
continuing presumptuously in this Jurisdiction, after the time limited, were
apprehended, and owning themselves to be the persons banished, were sentenced
(by the Court) to death, according the Law aforesaid, which has been executed
upon two of them: Mary Dyer upon the petition of her Son, and the mercy and
clemency of this Court, had liberty to depart within two days, which she has
accepted of. The consideration of our gradual proceeding, will vindicate us
from the clamorous accusations of severity; our own just and necessary defense,
calling upon us (other means failing) to offer the point, which these persons
have violently, and wilfully rushed upon, and thereby become felons dese, which
might it have been prevented, and the Sovereign Law Salus populi been
preserved, our former proceedings, as well as the sparing of Mary Dyer, upon an
inconsiderable intercession, will manifestly evince, we desire their lives
absent, rather then their death present.
