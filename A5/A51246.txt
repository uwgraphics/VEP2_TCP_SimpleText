A TESTIMONY Concerning RICHARD MOOR.
THE Author of this Book being a faithful Servant of the Lord, and zealous for
the Truth, who labored and travailed in the Work of the Ministry, both in
England and beyond Sea, and was in Barbados when he wrote this little Book,
which was some Years since; and because the Press has been fully supplied with
other Things, there was not an Opportunity to print it; but knowing it was his
great Desire it should be published, and having now a fit Opportunity, I was
willing to answer what his Mind then was: He came to London to visit Friends in
the 11th Month, and there fell sick, and on the 13th Day of the same Month he
dyed in Peace; and thus much is signified concerning him by one who truly loved
him for the Truth's sake.

TO THE READER.
WHoever thou art that read this ensuing Treatise, if thou find any Thing
in it which does appear strange unto thee in the reading thereof, be not
troubled thereat, but stand still in the Coolness of thy Spirit, and turn in to
the Measure of the Light of God, which shines forth clearly in thy own
Conscience, and there thou will see it openly made manifest unto thee; but if
thou read it in the Power of thy own Will, and therein stand expecting to
receive Benefit thereby, thou will find nothing but Deadness and barrenness;
for the Appearance of God and his Eternal Truth has at all Times and Seasons
been contrary to Man's Will; for it is now as it was in the Days of Old, it
comes not by the Will of Man, but holy Men speak as they are moved by the
Spirit of God; and as it was in former Ages, so it is now in this our Day, for
he that departs from Iniquity makes himself a Prey unto this Generation of
Evildoers, who set themselves in Perverseness against the Lord, and have
hardened their Hearts, and stiffned their Necks against the Appearance of the
Lord, and of his Eternal Truth; and he is come to be a Cross to the Will of
all Flesh; for if the Things of God came according to the will of Man, then the
World would receive them; but seeing it crosses Man's Will, therefore the
World hates it, and calls it Foolishness and Madness, and cries out, that them
that are given up to follow it are Deceivers, and are deluded and bewitched.

THE CONTENTS.
I. THe Return of the True Church out of the Barren Wilderness into her former
State and Glory. II. The Destruction of Babylon, the Mystery of Iniquity, and
the Mother of Harlots, and the Abominations of the whole Earth. III. A
Revelation of the Man of Sin and Death, wherein he is separated from the Man of
Righteousness and Life, which two Men are of two several Births, which Births
proceed from the two Seeds, which two Seeds are herein manifested and declared,
the one to be the Seed of God, and the other the Seed of the Serpent, whose
Head is now to be bruised. IV. A Word of Love unto the Sons and Daughters of
Sion; and a Hand held forth unto them who are yet in Egypt's Captivity, and to
them who are yet in the Desert Wilderness.
A True Manifestation of the Church's Return out of the Barren Wilderness,
where She has remained since the Days of the Apostles, which Church is the
true Spouse, the Lamb's Wise. Also the Speedy Downfall of Babylon the Mother of
Harlots, declared, etc.
NOW is the appointed Time come, wherein the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac,
and the God of Jacob is risen and arising to manifest himself unto his People,
and to make himself known to those that have long waited for this the Day of
his Appearance, unto whom the Son of his Righteousness is arising with healing
in his Wings; and now is the great Jehov^h appearing in his Dread and in his
Power, to the establishing of his Covenant unto ^braham, and to his Seed
forever, and he is now gathering his Elect from the four Quarters of the Earth,
and redeeming the Seed of Jacob out of their Captivity, and the Outcast of
Israel from under their Yoke of Bondage.

Therefore prepare thee to meet thy God, O Israel; for behold he is come and
coming in Ten Thousand of his Saints, and who may abide the Day of his
Appearance? for the Eyes of the Lord God are upon the sinful Kingdom, and he
will destroy it from off the Face of the Earth, saving that he will not utterly
destroy the House of Jacob; for behold he sits upon a white Throne, before
whose Face the Heavens and also the Earth shall fly away, and their Place shall
be no more found at all, his Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, and on his Head are
many Crowns, and he has a Name written that no man knows but himself, and is
clothed with a Vesture dipped in Blood, and his Name is called The word of God,
and out of his Mouth goes a sharp Sword, wherewith he does smite the Nations,
and he treads the Wine Press of the Fierceness and Wrath of the Almighty God,
and he has on his Vesture and on his Thigh a Name written, KING of KINGS and
LORD of LORDS, and in his Hands is all the Power of the Earth, and also of the
Heavens; for behold he makes all things new, old things must pass away; for the
Dragon having had Possession for so many Days, even many Generations, of the
old Heaven, and also of the old Earth, which I say the subtle Dragon having
gotten the Dominion thereof, he by his Filthiness defiled it, so that the true
Virgin could no longer remain therein, but was driven forth of it, and was
banished into the mourning and desolate Wilderness, a place prepared her of God
for so many Days, and her Heir which she had brought forth, which is to rule
the Nations with his Iron Rod, has been caught up from her to God, and so the
Dragon has had the Dominion of the true Virgin's Territories, since the Days
of the Apostles, and has made War with the Seed of the Virgin, and as it were
overcome them, and in her Dominion he has placed the great Whore, the Mother
of Harlots, and she has corrupted the Earth, and also the Heavens, wherein the
true Virgin was placed before she fled into the Wilderness, the Whore having
poluted them with the Filth of her Fornication; for her Superscription is,
Mystery-Babylon the Mother of Harlots and Abominations of the whole Earth: And
the Nations which the true Virgin's Heir should have ruled, they have all been
the Seat of this great Whore, and she has guided them and ruled them, as a
man would guide and rule the Beast whereon he rides, and she has made them
all unstable as Waters, for she sat upon Peoples, Multitudes, Nations and
Tongues, and all the Kings of the Earth have committed Whoredom with her, and
have drunk of the Cup of her Fornication; for she held forth a golden Cup in
her Hand, a smooth Profession and pleasing Pretenses, but within full of
Abominations; yea, rich and poor, bond and free, even from the Beggar upon the
Dunghill to the Prince upon the Throne, they all drunk of this Cup, and have
been drunken with the Wine of the VVhore's Fury; and many of them have (as it
were) drunk the Blood of the Saints and of the Martyrs of Jesus Christ, whom he
has raised to bear their faithful Testimonies against the Whore, and against
her Fornications; and all the Blood that has been spilt upon the Earth is to
be found in her, for within her lodges the Ground of all Iniquity, and the
Foundation of all Transgression.

But now has the Lord God remembered his poor banished Spouse, which sits
mourning in the Wilderness, and the great Persecution of her Seed; and great
BABYLON is coming into his remembrance, and she shall receive a just reward
from the Lord God of Life for all the Abominations that have proceeded from her
since the time the Virgin fled into the Wilderness; and though she has long
sat as a Queen, and has known no Sorrow, but has had a Husband, and has
brought forth many Children of Fornication, and has lived deliciously for many
Generations, whilst the true spouse (the Lamb's Wife) has sat desolate in
the barren Wilderness, where she has been childless and deprived of her
Husband, yet nevertheless thy Judgments are at hand, and thy Downfall
approaches, O thou great and Antichristian-Babylon; for Sorrow, Desolation and
Misery is even ready to seize upon thee; and the Smoke of thy Torments does
begin to rise, and thy Kingdom is full of Darkness, and the Lord God has
discovered thy Nakedness and thy Sorceries, and thy false Divinations, whereby
thou have deceived the Nations, and caused them to receive thy Beast like mark;
and many are they that are come out from thee, and will no longer be partakers
with thee in thy Sins, lest they should partake with thee of thy plagues; for
strong is the Lord God who judges thee; and thy Cup which thou have given to
others shall be filled unto thee double, even the measure that thou have
measured to others, shall be measured unto thy self double, and all that
wherein thy soul delighted must depart from thee and thou must come down and
sit in the Dust, O thou Virgin-Daughter of BABYLON; and thou shall be no more
counted delicate nor fair; for the DECREE is gone forth against thee, and thy
Judgment is assuredly coming upon thee.

Therefore all ye Inhabitants of the Earth, hearken diligently and your Souls
shall live, and take WARNING in this the Day of your Visitation, and go no
longer on in your Polutions, but come forth of the midst of BABYLON, and be no
more partakers with her in her Sins; for, if you do, you will assuredly partake
with her of her plagues; for she must be burned up and consumed, and brought to
naught by the fiery Fierceness of the Lord's Wrath; and the old Heavens, and
the old Earth, wherein she has ruled in all this Dark Night of Apostasy since
the Days of the Apostles, must be destroyed with her, and all them that
wilfully resisted the Voice of the Lord their God in their own Hearts and
Consciences, calling them out of BABYLON, the Land of Darkness, into his
marvelous Light.

Therefore beware of kicking against this* but if in wilfulness and stubborness
you reject this the large Love of God toward you, yet nevertheless let it be
known unto you all in his living presence, that you have at large been warned,
therefore shut not your Ears at the Voice of Peace, and be not like to the
deaf. Add^r which stops his Ear at the voice of the Charmer, although he
charms never so wisely.

For now Wisdom utters her voice in the open Street, and in the broad ways,
she cries at the Gates at Entry of the City, at the coming in at the Door,
unto you O men I call, and my voice is to the Sons of man, O ye simple
understand Wisdom, and ye Fools be of an understanding Heart, and know in th^s
your day the things that belong to your Peace before they are hid from your
Eyes, and the Door of Mercy be shut upon you, and the Decree sealed against
you, and Repentance removed far from you, so that you cannot attain to it,
although y^u should seek it with tears.

Now as BABYLON comes to be destroyed, so likewise is the marriage of the LAMB
prepared, and preparing, and his Bride is making her self ready even the true
Virgin, the Lamb's Wife (the true Church) is now returning out of the desolate
and barren Wilderness, where she has sat for many Generations in a mournful
state and condition, a place not known to the World, a place prepared her of
God for so many Days; and now praises be unto the Lord our God, the Days are
near expired, and she is returning again into her former State and Glory; and
the Lord is now creating for her a new Heaven, and a new Earth, wherein
dwells Righteoushess; and if any question what her former Glory was, and
wherewithal she then was beautified? let them with singleness of Heart stand in
the Light of the Lamb, look into John's Revelations, and there thou shall see
what he declares of her, and of her Glory and Beauty in Ages past, even in his
Days; for he saw her a woman exceeding glorious and beautiful, even clothed
with the Sun, having the Moon under her Feet, and on her Head a Crown of twelve
Stars: She was clothed with the true Light of heaven, even with the brightness
of the everlasting day and the Moon with her changeable things was under her
Feet* and she was ^rowned with the Brightness of the Glory of the Lord God of
Life, and she travailed to bring forth the Man-Child that should rule the
Nations wi^h a Rod of Iron. Now this was the state of the true Church in the
Days of the Apostles, before the time of her Banishment into the Wilderness:
And John saw this to be wonderful, even in Heaven. Now this will be the State
and Condition of the true Church after she is returned out of the Wilderness
again; and the time is assuredly come, where in the Lord God will cloth her
with his own Brightness, and with his own eternal Glory, and she shall again
bring forth the Heir, which shall rule the Nations with his Rod of Iron, and
shall bind PRINCES in Chains, and NOBLES in Fetters of Iron; and he that does
deny this, does deny plain Scripture, for they bear Witness, that Sion shall
arise and shall shine for^h, for her Light is come, and the Glory of the Lord
is risen and arising upon her; and though the Darkness does cover the Earth,
and the gross Darkness the People, yet the Lord shall arise upon her, and his
Glory shall be seen upon her, and the Gentiles shall come to her Light, and
Kings to the Brightness of her rising, and she shall awake, and put on her
Strength and her beautiful Garments shall be put on; for henceforth there shall
no more come into her the Uncircumcised nor the Unclean; therefore cleanse your
Hands ye Sinners, and purify your Hearts ye double-minded, that you may be
accepted in this the Day of the Lord's l^rge Love and Mercies, that is so
largely held forth and proffered unto you, to invite you, that you might not
partake of the Plagues of BABYLON, which shall speedily come upon her at
unawares, in an Hour when you least think of it shall Desolation and
Destruction come upon her, and upon all them that are found in her, partaking
with her of her Sins.

O therefore as you tender the Eternal Welfare of your precious Souls, which
ought to be counted as dear and as precious in your Sight as any Man's Soul
that ever lived on the Earth; for they are precious in the Sight of the Lord;
therefore prize them and this the Day of your Visitation, for you know not how
soon the dark Night may overtake you, and you may be sealed up in the Pit of
utter Darkness, and no Means afforded you, whereby you may be redeemed into the
Light again; therefore consider of these Things while you have Time and Space,
and come forth of Babylon, and touch no more of her Uncleanness, lest you
perish eternally with her in your Stubbornness, and gain*saying the VVitness of
God in your own Consciences, which does stand a true VVitness against you in
these things; and let not the long Forbearance of so merciful a God, whose
Spirit has for a long time striven with you, and still rises up to condemn you
in your own Hearts for your evil Deeds; I say, let not his long Forbearance
harden your Hearts against the Day of Slaughter because his Judgments are not
speedily executed upon you; for verily his Spirit shall not always strive with
Man, but at last you will provoke his Wrath, and cause it to be kindled
against you, and his fierce Indignation will break forth of a sudden upon you,
and Horror, Dread and Terror will take hold on all such ungodly VVretches,
which do Despite to his Spirit of Grace, which has long striven with them in
their own Hearts and Consciences, and have turned it into Lasciviousness, and
VVantonness, and put the Day of the Lord their God afar off from them; yet let
all such know, that he is nigh unto every one of them, to smite them in their
own Hearts and in their own Consciences, for disobeying of his righteous Law
and just Command, which he has clearly made known unto them; for what may be
known of God is made manifest in thee, for he has showed it unto thee, O Man:
And though there has been a long time of Darkness and Ignorance, whereat the
Lord has winked; but now since the true Light has shined in all Hearts so
manifestly, so that none can plead Ignorance after they once come to be
acquainted therewith: now does he command all Men every where to repent, and he
that shall deny to obey his Commands shall be left without Excuse in the Sight
of God* and in the Sight of his Witness, which shines in his own Conscience;
for the Commands of God are not grievous, but they that love him keep his
Commandments, and meditate upon his Law Day and Night; for their whole Delight
stands in walking in his Statutes.

The Man of Sin and Death separated from the Man of Righteousness and Life,
wherein the first m^n Adam is manifested to be of the Earth earthly, and the
second Man Adam to be from Heaven heavenly.
THou that have any Longings or Breathings after the Lord God that made thee,
and formed thee in the Womb, who stretched forth the Heavens as a Curtain, and
by whom the Foundations of the Earth were laid; and thou that have any Thing in
thee that is oppressed by the unrighteous Power, and groans under the Burden of
Oppression, and desires to be set at Liberty, even into the glorious Liberty of
the Sons of God; arise out of thy dark Slumbers, for the Night is far spent,
and the dawning of the Day of the Lord God of Power is come, and the
everlasting Son of Righteousness is risen and arising, even Christ Jesus, the
eternal Son of God, the Son of the everlasting Day, who is the true Light of
the World, and has enlightened every Man and Woman that comes into the World
with a Measure of his true Light, which Light shines in the Consciences of all
the Sons and Daughters of Men, and this is the Light that lets thee to see the
Thoughts of thy own Heart; For he that formed the Mountains, and created the
Winds, he declares unto Man his Thoughts, and the secret Intents of his Heart,
whether they be good or evil; and this the Lord has placed in thee to bear a
true and faithful Testimony for him against every Appearance of Evil, and is
God's Gift unto thee, which Gift is perfect and without Sin; for it is a true
Measure of his Son Christ Jesus, which has enlightened every Man and Woman;
this did never at any Time consent to the speaking of any evil Word, or the
acting of any unrighteous Action by thee, or any other of the Sons or Daughters
of Man, but has and does at all Times stand a Witness for the Lord God of
Life, and has at all Times been the Condemner of the Transgressor and the
Worker of Iniquity in thee and them: Now fallen Man being Darkness it self,
having no Means whereby to discern his own Thoughts, yet this Light has shined
in the Darkness, but the Darkness could not comprehend it; therefore have thou
and all Mankind for a long time walked in Darkness, and thy Deeds have been the
Deeds of Darkness, and thou art become a Stranger to God and to his Ways of
Light and Life, by Reason whereof thou love Darkness rather then Light,
because thou love thy own Will and thy evil Deeds, which proceed from thence,
whereby the Heritage of God in thee has beenlaid waste, and his Righteous Seed
oppressed and trampled under Foot in thee by the Power of Unrighteousness
through thee; but now after his long Forbearance, and after many gentle
Admonitions which he has held forth to the Rebellious Sons and Daughters of
Men; after all this is he appearing to make himself known, and now are the
Cries of the Oppressed entered into the Ears of the Lord God of Sabbath, and he
is now jealous for his Seed's sake, which has long suffered under the Burden
of Oppression, and he is now manifesting himself in this his great Day, to
plead with all Flesh in the Valley of Judgment; and he will Overturn, Overturn,
Overturn, till he comes to reign, whose Right it is; for long has the Powers
of Darkness reigned in all Mankind, whose Right it was not; but now Christ
Jesus making himself known, who is the true Light of the World, and he is
arising to reign, whose Right it is.

Therefore come into the Moderation, and seriously consider in thy own Heart
how thy Condition stands before the Lord thy God, if thou were immediately
called to an Account before him for thy Deeds done in the Body, whether good or
evil; and come but with an honest Heart to the Light of Christ Jesus in thy own
Conscience, and that will let thee, and all the Sons and Daughters of men see
how your Condition stands in the Presence of your God; for be thou assured,
that if the VVitness of God in thy own Conscience condemns thee for thy evil
Words and Actions, God from whence the Witness came is greater, and will not
any ways justify thee therein, but if thou give up to be guided by his Light
in the Singleness of thy Heart, then thou will come into the Beginning of the
Creation of God* and see his Work daily manifested in thee; and thou will come
to see the Sword of the Lord God of Jacob to cut down and to destroy the
Transgressor at all times in thee, and thou will come to see that nature in
thee that would stand up to take the Sword to kill or destroy thy
Fellow Creatures, or oppress or defraud any by the Unrighteous Power, thou will
come to see that Nature to perish by the Sword of the Lord in thee, which Sword
is the Word of the Lord, which is a Discerner of the Thoughts of the Heart, and
divides between the precious Thoughts and the vile, therefore as thou tenders
thy own Soul, come to that Sword, and bring all thy Thoughts unto it, and in
the Light thou will come to see a nature in thee that has a long time led thy
Soul captive under the Captivity of Sin and Satan; and thou will come to see
that nature carried away captive by the power of Christ Jesus, even into the
Land of Forgetfulness; for he is now risen in this his Day to lead Captivity
captive, and to set free from all Oppression, and now is the Day of his
plenteous Redemption come, and his Salvation will he make known unto the Ends
of the Earth, and will redeem all them that come to walk in his Light and that
obey and follow it in all his motions, and that contentedly come to take up the
Cross daily to their own wills, and so in Singleness follow Christ the Light,
them will he redeem from under the Power of Sin and the Devil who is the Author
thereof; and from the World and all its enticing Lusts; and as they give up
wholely to be guided by the Light, and to take up their Cross daily, which
crosses the carnal will, and so come to deny themselves, and to follow Christ,
who says, I am the Light of the World, whosoever follows me, shall not abide
in Darkness, but shall have the Light of Life; and he that comes into this,
comes into the true Faith, which purifies the Heart, and they come to receive
Christ, and to as many as receive him, to them Power is given to be the Sons of
God, and so such come to know what the Seed in them is, and what it is to have
the tender Babe of Grace formed in them, and what it is to be born of God, and
so such do not commit Sin; for they have the Seed of God remaining in them; for
that which is born of God cannot commit Sin; for the Prince of this World has
no part in this new Creature, who is created in Righteousness and true Holiness.

Now thou that art born after the Flesh, and art in the first Nature, thou art
a Stranger to this new Birth, which is born of God, and thou art ready with
Nicodemus to cry out, Can a man ente, rnto his Mother's Womb again when he is
old? or shall there any thing be brought forth by God whilst man lives upon
Earth, to be made manifest to be without Sin? So thou art altogether ignorant
of the wonderful works of the Lord; for the God of the world having blinded the
Eyes, and darkened the Minds of all that live in the old nature, so that they
therein cannot please the Lord their God, but their delight is in the works of
Darkness, whereof the Devil is the Prince; and they love the world and the
Glory thereof, and so the Love of the Father is not in them, but now if thou
do but come to believe in the Light, and into true Obedience to it in tender
Simplicity, thou will come into the spiritual warfare, and to march under the
Banner of CHRIST, who is the eternal CAPTAIN of our Salvation, and thou will
come to see the Battle fought in Heaven between the Lamb and the Dragon; even
in God's Kingdom, which comes not by observations, to say, lo here it is, or lo
there it is; for his Kingdom is within thee, and there the Battle of the great
God is to be fought, between Christ the Prince of Peace, and the old Dragon the
Prince of darkness. Now as Christ the Lamb of God comes to take away the Sins
of the World, and to lead his Soldiers forth, he arms them with the whole
Armor of Light, in Patience, Meekness, Humility, Chastity, Soberness, and
Gentleness, Love and Tenderness, contented in the Will of God tosuffer all
things with Cheerfulness, so it may tend to his Glory: Now these are they which
are to make War in Righteousness against the Principalities and Powers of
Darkness in high Places, at whose Appearance all flesh shall tremble, and all
Hearts shall be astonished; for Fearfulness shall surprise the Hypocrites.

Now as Christ appears prepared to battle, and has armed his Soldiers with
those Weapons aforementioned, so likewise the Dragon he arms his Soldiers
with his Armor, which is the whole Armor of Darkness, which consists in
Hatred and Malice, Envy and Persecution, Pride, Hastiness and High-mindedness,
Oppression, and Tyranny, Covetousness, and Drunkenness, Lying and Swearing,
Defrauding and Deceit, Wantonness and Whoredoms, and many other wicked Weapons,
which the Light will make manifest to them that abide faithful in it.

Now let every one in particular come to a honest search in your own Hearts,
and examine your selves without Deceit, and see whose Banner you are marching
under, and whose Armor you wear; for it is but vain for any man to deceive
himself any longer; for look whose Armor thou bear, his Soldier thou art,
and his Wages thou must look to receive; for if thou live in Sin and
Wickedness, thou art a Servant to Sin, and the Wages of Sin thou must expect to
receive, and the Wages of Sin is Death, therefore it were good for thee to
ponder the thing wisely, lest thou bring thy Destruction upon thy self;
therefore am I, out of the Tenderness of my Soul, and in bowels of Compassion
toward thee, moved to warn thee, and to advise thee in dear and tender Love to
the oppressed Seed in thee, which groans to be set at Liberty. Now the Desire
of my Heart is, that thou should awake out of death, and come unto CHRIST the
LIGHT, that he may give thee Life; and to cast off every weight and burden, and
the Sins that so ea^^ly beset thee; and that thou should put off the Armor
of darkness, and put on the Armor of light; for assuredly there is nothing
that makes a Separation between thee and thy God, but Sin; but now, herein
stands the wonderful Love of God toward the fallen Sons and Daughters of Men,
who were dead in Sins and Trespasses, and altogether in Darkness, without any
Means or Hope of Recovery in themselves; now the Lord beholding poor distressed
man in this State, whereinto the Prince of Darkness has captivated him, out of
the Tenderness of his Compassion unto the poor distressed Sons and Daughters of
men, he gave his only begotten Son into the World for a Light, and to every man
and woman which is born upon the Face of the whole Earth, has the Lord in
mercy given a measure of this true Light which has enlightened every one which
comes into the World, in which Light stands the Power of God and in this
Light man comes to see his Sins, and to see the Deceit of his own Heart, which
otherwise he could not have seen; and though thou art unacquainted with it, yet
that is it that lets thee see the actings of the Prince of Darkness in thee;
for if he plotteth in thee any mischievous Intents, whereby to destroy any
man's Person or Estate, and so endeavors to make thee an Instrument whereby he
may do it secretly in the dark, and although no Eye of man can see thee, nor
see his secret acting in thee, yet this Light will follow thee, and discover
his subtle Delusions unto thee, and make him many times appear odious unto
thee, and calls thee and invites thee from following of him, and many times
brings Fearfulness and Dread upon thee for thy wicked Actions; now this is that
that would redeem thee out of Sin, which saves all them that believe in and
follow the Son of God, the true Light of the World, out of Sin and Death, which
is the Wages thereof.

Now it is but vain for thee or any other to call Christ thy Redeemer and thy
Savior, and to say, that thou hopest to be saved by Christ after thy Death,
because he was crucified at Jerusalem sixteen Hundred years ago, and yet thou
live in Sin and Wickedness, in Pride and Vainglory of this world, which
passes away as a Vapor of the Night before the Morning Sun; but for all this,
let me tell thee plainly without Deceit, nevertheless for all thy high Conceits
of thy self, and for all thy vain Hopes and thy feigned Faith, thy Hope is the
Hope of the Hypocrite, which will perish in the time of Trial, and thy feigned
Faith cannot give thee victory over the world, therefore if ever thou come to
witness Redemption to thy Soul, thou must witness Christ's Death to kill Sin in
thy mortal Body, and thou must witness his Resurrection in thee.

And as for his Sufferings at Jerusalem I own according to the Declaration of
the Scriptures, but thou must witness him nearer to thee then at Jerusalem, if
ever thou witness him to be thy Redeemer, and the Salvation of thy Soul.

Now let me reason with thee a little in Coolness and Moderation; if Christ be
thy Redeemer, what is it that he has redeemed thee out of, seeing thou yet
live in Sin, and in the Polutions of the World? And if he be thy Savior,
what has he saved thee from, seeing thou art yet in Bondage to Sin and
Iniquity? Therefore the sting of death is not yet taken away while Sin remains,
so thou can not call him thy Redeemer in Truth and Righteousness unless thou
could witness him to have redeemed thee out of sin and transgression, and
thou do but deceive thy self to call him thy Savior, unless that thou
could witness that he did save thee out of temptations when they arise in
thee from thy own Lusts, and so from Sin which they bring forth, and from Death
which is the Wages thereof.

Now as the first Nature has reigned, which is of the Earth earthly in all
mankind, which is the first Adam, over whom Sin came to have the Dominion,
whereby Death came to reign over all Mankind in that nature; so now, as the
Children of men come to be begotten into Christ the Second Adam, and so born of
the new Birth of Righteousness, they come to know what the Immortal Seed is,
whereunto the Promises are Yea and Amen, and come to witness Christ to be the
Redeemer and Savior in Deed and in Truth, and that his Cross in them is the
Power of God unto Salvation, and they see, as they abide faithful in that which
crosses their own fleshly wills, therein they come to see the power of God and
as they stand steadfastly faithful in it they come to see the Power of Light in
them, which is far stronger then the Powers of Darkness; for they come to see
Victory in it over the Devil and all his subtle Delusions, and over the Flesh
and all its Lusts, and over the World and all the Vanities thereof, and as they
abide in this Power, which is CHRIST, the Light of the World, and the Power of
God unto Salvation, and as they follow him faithfully through all Sufferings,
and all the Hatred and Malice which arises against them in the Children of
Darkness, they will come to see him to trample down all his Enemies in them,
and make them his Footstool; but as any man or woman goes out of the Cross,
wherein stands God's Power, and let their own wills rule in them, then they
go into the Power of the Prince of the Air, which rules in the Children of
Disobedience, whose Dominion wholely stands in man's corrupt and carnal will,
and then he leads them captive at his own Pleasure, and so as they stand in his
Dominion Sin comes to have Power over such in all his Motions, and then comes
in Complainings and Murmurings against the Lord, who made them; and so they
come to cry out for want of Power, and because they cannot have power and
victory over Sin in their own wills, and in their own time, which is the very
Ground wherein the Power of Sin stands; then when they see they cannot have
Power over Sin there, which is impossible for any to attain to unless they come
out of the Power of their own will into that Power which crosses it; then they
come to plead for Sin in themselves, then they not having Power over it there,
they inform all others that they can never have Power over Sin, nor be set free
from it whilst they remain in this earthly Tabernacle; and then if the Lord
raise up any to witness that he has redeemed them from under the Power of Sin,
and so by his Power in them which is a Cross to the carnal will of man, freed
them from the Power of sin and Death, then cry out those that live in all
manner of sin and polutions, these are Deluders, take heed of being deceived,
when, alas! there is nothing reigning in them that they can be deceived of but
sin and wickedness, and so they cannot bear the hearing that they should be
free from sin until the Lord cut off them and their sins together; but they
never consider that, as the Tree falls, so it lies, and as Death leaves
them, so assuredly shall Judgment find them; for in the Grave there is no
Repentance, neither can any unclean thing enter into God's Kingdom, which
consists of Purity, Holiness, and Righteousness.

Now the scriptures they declare that God is Light, and if we walk in the
Light, and a^ide in the Light, as he is in the Light, then we have Fellowship
one with another, and the Blood of Christ cleanses us from all Sin. Now if
thou come into this LIGHT, this will let thee see that there is something in
thee that does check, reprove and cross thy own natural will, and this is the
Power of God in thee, and would be unto Salvation if thou would but obey it;
for it will crucify thy old Nature, and stand a Cross over thy own will, and
so keep it down, that it might not rule in thee, and so thy Soul will come to
stand in the Power which is above the Power of sin, and so come to be saved out
of sin, and out of Death, which is the sting thereof: And so as thou come
into the Light, and therein stand with an Upright Heart, the Light will make
sin and the Power thereof manifest unto thee in all its Motions, and will
crucify all that is of the first Nature, and all that which arises from thy
self, and will judge out that Power daily which has moved in thee, and has
carried thee forth at all times to act contrary to the Mind and Will of God,
and has caused thee to oppress the Seed which God has placed in thee; and so
SION with the pure Seed of God in thee comes to be redeemed through Judgment,
and her Converts come to bring forth a righteous Life and Conversation.

Now thou that read understand, The Life is more then Meat, and the Body is
more then Raiment, and the pure Life is more then Knowledge; for old Adam, or
the first Nature may eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, and so by
that may come to talk much of the Truth, and what the Saints enjoyed in former
Ages, but cannot come into the Life thereof; for he is driven out from the tree
of Life into the earthly Imaginations without him* and the ANGEL of the Lord
with his flaming Sword, even the Righteous Law is placed to keep the Way of the
Tree of Life lest he put forth his Hand and take of the Fruit there of and eat,
and so live forever: Now the first Nature is not to live forever, but for an
appointed time; for that is the first Adam and his Life which stands in sin,
and he has transgressed the Righteous Law of God, and so has sinned, and that
Soul that sins must dye the Death, and so death comes to reign over all
Mankind from Adam till Moses, from the first Nature till the Seed of God in the
creature moves under the burden of Iniquity, whereby it has been pressed
down, as a Cart is pressed with sheaves, and comes to stir up the Creature, and
draws him into some Consideration, and brings him to understand his Condition,
that he is even a Captive under sin in the Land of Darkness, even in spiritual
Egypt, and under many Lusts which are as so many hard Taskmasters to him, and
that he is but a stranger and a sojourner there, and that the Lord has
promised him a land of rest and freedom, but he knows not how to find it out
until the Lord God shall raise up the great Prophet like unto Moses to lead him
out of this Land of Darkness through the red Sea, by his LIGHT, or PILLAR of
Fire, which Light is Darkness unto the Egyptians even in their Day, which
Pillar of Fire is to guide the Creature through the long desert Wilderness into
the land of rest; and Moses is till the Prophets, and the Prophets they declare
that there shall a REDEEMER come out of Zion, or the Seed of God within, who
shall reign in Peace and Righteousness over his own House, which shall be
raised up; for he will make them a willing People, and he will turn unto them
the pure Language, and they shall all call upon the Name of the Lord with one
Consent, and he will bring back again their Captivity, and settle them in
perfect Peace, so that they may every man sit under his own Vine, and under his
own Fig Tree, and none shall make them afraid: And the Prophets they are till
John, who is as the Voice of one crying in the Wilderness; now the VOICE said,
Cry, the Prophet answered, what shall I cry? That all Flesh is Grass, and the
Clory of man as the Flowers of the Field, therefore prepare the Way of the
Lord, and make straight the crooked Paths, and let the high lofty Mountains of
Man's proud Will be laid low, and let every Valley, and low despised Place be
raised, that so the ransomed of the Lord may pass* and John he baptizeth to
Repentance, and brings the Creature into a Sorrow and a Trouble, because it
cannot bring forth Fruit worthy of Repentance, and he declares that he is not
the Messiah that is to come after him, which is to be preferred before him,
whose Shoe-latchet he was not worthy to unloose, but that he is sent to bear
his Testimony of him, and John he is till Christ, and when he comes which is
the true Messiah, and the true Redeemer of the promised Seed of Israel after
the Spirit, who is the second Adam, and the true Prophet like unto Moses, whom
the Lord has promised since the Days of old, even this is he that shall come
out of Sion, and shall bring Deliverance unto that Seed in all the Sons and
Daughters of Men that has long groaned, and that which Sion has long
travailed with, and been in Pain to be delivered from under the Burden of
Oppression; and he will crucify the old Nature, even the first Adam, who has
been the Oppressor, and nail him to the Cross, and so by the Cross to him and
to his corrupt Will will mortify or kill his Deeds, even by the Power of the
Spirit, which Power stands in that which crosses the old Nature; now the
first Adam's Life, that stands in Sin, and in Transgression, and in Deceit
and Guile, which are all the Fruits of Death, whereon he feeds, and is in some
sort satisfied, for he dares not approach unto the Tree of Life, because the
Angel of the Lord's Presence stands with the flaming sword ready lifted up,
even the righteous Law, which still lays hold on him when at any time he
approaches near unto the Tree of Life, this cuts him down, so that he at all
Times remains in Death, and feeds upon the Fruits thereof; this is the true
State and Condition of the first Adam who has lost himself, and is fallen from
God his Maker: But now the second Adam, whom the Lord is creating, and whom he
has created, even after his own Image, in Righteousness and true Holiness, who
was and is the first born among many Brethren, even Christ the Son of the
living God, who puts an End to Transgression, and destroys Sin, and says, O
Death I will be thy Death, and fulfills the Royal Law in all things, and
passes through the flaming sword, for the Fire cannot touch him, but he has
free Access to the Tree of Life, and feeds plentifully upon the Fruit thereof,
and so lives forever, and nothing will satisfy him but the very Life it self:
And this is the true Condition of the second Adam, who is the true Heir of all
things: Now he that comes to have this Babe begotten in him, that which has
begot him will bring him forth; for shall I bring to the Birth, and not bring
forth? says the Lord; now he that comes to be born of this Birth, and to have
his Life to stand in this, he shall with this come to eat of the Tree of Life;
for this is he that shall enter in at the straight Gate into the City whose
Builder is God: Therefore if thou feel any thing in thee which stirs and
moves in thee against sin, and against the very Appearance of Evil, there lies
the seed out of which this Babe is formed; and therefore as it is as yet but
weak, as in Appearance to thee, thou ought to be tender over it, even more
tender then the Mother that is newly conceived is over the tender Fruit of her
Womb, and beware of bruising of it, and of smothering of it, for a small thing
will offend it and choke it; but as thou art tender over it, and with
Carefulness do cherish it, and come to take Delight in it, thou will find it
to grow daily, and increase in thee from strength to strength; but thou must
beware that thou do not at any time lay any Burden upon it, whereby it may be
offended, for if thou do, thou will come into Condemnation for the same, and
thou will come to suffer Loss in thy self, which Loss will not easily be
regained, for thou will find Deadness and Barrenness to arise up in thee, and
the Dread and Terror of the Lord will take hold daily upon thee; until the Lord
has executed his Vengeance upon that which has oppressed his seed; for thou
must assuredly come to know a day of Vengeance in thee to light upon the Head
of the Transgressor, and a Night of s^rrow, before thou can know the day of
Joy and Gladness.

Therefore if thou will give up freely to let the Seed of God go free to serve
the Lord its God in Truth and Righteousness, and wait in Patience to see the
Oppressor judged and condemned in thee, and to see the Vengeance of the Lord to
be laid upon the Head of the Transgressor, and so to become one with that which
judges, and executes the fierce Wrath and Indignation of the Lord upon that
which oppresses the righteous Seed in thee: Now if thou become one with the
Lord in this, and give up thy self willingly in Obedience to him, then a short
Work will the Lord make in the Earth, and thou shall come to see him whom thy
Soul loves, who now does but spring up in thee, as a Lilly among Thorns, but
when he comes to be brought forth, he will be the fairest amongst ten thousand,
and this is Christ in thee, the Hope of Glory, and thou will come to live in
him, and he in thee; and so thou will come to live in the Life that was before
Sin was, and before Transgression was, and shall be when Sin and Transgression
is destroyed, and shall be no more; and then thou will come to witness old
things to be done away, and all things to become new, a new Heaven and a new
Earth wherein dwells Righteousness; and thou will come to witness God's Will
to be done in thy Body of Earth as it is in Heaven, and his Kingdom in thee to
be come and established, and his Power made known in thee to the destroying of
the Power of Sin and Satan, and his Glory to be made known in thee to the
setting forth of his eternal Praise in the midst of all his Enemies; and this
is declared by many who are faithful Witnesses of it, according to the Measure
which the Lord has freely been pleased to give and bestow upon them, and this
do they witness to be an eternal Truth, according as the Spirit of the Lord God
of Truth has revealed it unto them; for they never received from Man, neither
by Man, but by the Revelation of Jesus Christ, who leads into the Path of Light
and Life all that are willing and obedient to follow him; now these things are
deep and hidden Mysteries to them that yet remain in Darkness; but if thou
can but read the Scriptures singly without adding thereunto thy own or any
other Man's Imaginations, they testify of him that has the Life in him, and
they declare how the two Births have been brought forth in all Ages, which
Births came from the two Seeds, even the Seed of the Promise and the Seed of
the Serpent, and between these two Seeds there is an everlasting Enmity placed,
so that they can never be reconciled one to the other, but still arise one to
destroy the other; but at last the Seed of the Woman must and will get the
Victory, for that must come to bruise the Seed of the Serpent's head, although
the other bruise his Heel for a short Space; now see the Seed of the Serpent
brought forth by the first Birth in Cain, how the Enmity comes to work in him,
so that he came as it were to murder Abel, the second Birth, which was brought
forth of the Seed of the Promise, and wherefore was it, but because the
Sacrifice that was offered up by the promised Seed was accepted, and his, the
Seed of the Serpent was not; therefore Cain, the first Birth, who as in
Reference to his outward Birth after the Flesh was therein his Brother; but yet
he being ruled by the contray Seed to Abel, the Enmity caused him to rise up
and to murder innocent Abel, and then he became a Fugitive and a Vagabond upon
Earth all his Days, not having an Habitation in God, although he builded a
City, and called it by his Son's Name; so here the Seed of the Serpent bruised
the Seed of the Woman's Heel, and yet the Serpent's Head was bruised in this
thing: See the Declaration of Jacob and Esau, and there thou shall see it more
nearly and clearly made manifest unto thee; for there thou may see the two
Seeds Placed together in one fleshly Womb, and there they strove which should
first come forth to the Birth; I know thou can not but with me witness these
two Seeds in thee, striving which shall be brought forth; now rough Esau came
first forth in the Birth, who became a Hunter, and hunted up and down after
Venison, and became a rough hairy Man, of whom it was said, The Elder shall
serve the Younger before they had been instrumental to do Good or Evil; then
after him Jacob was brought forth, who by true Interpetation is a Supplanter,
who stayed at home with his Father, who in Process of Time came to get both the
Birthright and the Blessing, for the Blessing of Right belongs to him, for he
was blessed in the Womb, for in him the promised Seed sprung up, who at last
became a great People; yet was he by Esau long kept out of the Birth*right,
although that Esau had sold it to him, and counted it a small thing, even a
thing of naught, and sold it for a thing of small Value, even for a Mess of
Pottage, which afterward he would have sought the Blessing with Tears, but
could not attain it; but the Power of Jacob daily increased, so that he became
a mighty people, and the Dread and the Terror of the Lord was with him, which
caused the Heathen, even the Stock of Esau, even many times to fear, and
tremble, and stand astonished at their Presence: Yet nevertheless this fleshly
Seed of Jacob, which came out of his fleshly Loins, came to be corrupted, and
the Seed of the Serpent came to bear Rule in many of them, so that the Seed of
God came to be oppressed in them, which should have born Rule over the Seed of
the Serpent in their earthly Bodies, so that many times there was hardly one to
be found in an Age, or one in a Generation which came to witness the Serpent's
Head to be bruised in him, or that the Seed of God ruled in him in singleness
and simplicity; so that the Lord came as it were to be forgotten amongst the
Sons and Daughters of Men; but yet there was the Seed within, which still
breathed and groaned after God, for which seed's sake the Lord has long
waited, that he may be gracious unto the Sons and Daughters of Men, otherwise
he had long ago consumed them in his Fury, and his fierce Wrath had broke forth
upon them, as it did upon SODOM and GOMORRAH, and all the Cities of the Plains.

But he has at all times raised up his own seed in some, so that they have
born their faithful Testimonies for him against the seed of the serpent, and so
by them came to give forth Laws and Statutes, whereby the Children of Men may
come to know his Mind and Will, so that in the Performance of them they should
li^e, but they that disobey the same should dye the Death, then all they which
were of the Seed of Jacob after the Flesh said, that whatsoever the Lord should
command them, they would perform; but the Lord full well knew that there was
not such an Heart in them, which caused him to cry out, Oh that there was such
an Heart in this People to obey me, then should their Peace break forth as the
Morning, and their Righteousness as the Sun at Noonday; but the Lord's
all-seeing Eye saw that there was the Seed of the Serpent still lodging amongst
them and in them, which soon afterward showed it self forth, which caused the
Lord's Wrath to break forth upon many of them, even to their Destruction: And
although the Lord had wrought great Deliverances for them, even in carrying
them down into the Land of Egypt, and causing them there to endure a hard time
of Servitude and Bondage under the Hand of Pharaoh's hard Taskmasters; and
raising up his own Seed to show it self amongst them, even to the redeeming
them out of the Land of Bondage, and from under their Egyptian Captivity, even
by many grievous Plagues and mighty Wonders, which he showed forth upon Pharaoh
and his Egyptian Host; and carried them through the Depths of the Red Sea, as
upon dry Land, and destroyed Pharaoh and h^s Multitude, who pursued after them,
and led them through the Desert Wilderness, and caused Water to gush cut of the
Rock to satisfy their thirsty Souls, and fed them many Years with Manna in the
Wilderness; yet nevertheless for all this his large Love toward them* this
pure Seed of God was still oppressed in many of them by this Seed of the
Serpent, which caused the Lord to destroy many Thousands of them in the
Wilderness, before they came into the promised Land; so that there was but a
very small Number of them that came out of Egypt, that entered into the Land of
Rest, even but Two Persons, which were JOSHUA and CALEB; for all the rest were
destroyed, because the Seed of God was oppressed In them, even by the Seed of
the Serpent, which caused them To complain, and To murmur, and to depart from
his Statutes, and rebel against his Righteous Laws; yet still the Seed of God
cried and groaned unto him under all this, and his Ears are continually open
unto the Cries thereof; and for this Seed's Sake he raised up a People out of
the Stock of JACOB, even in the Wilderness, which he caused to enter into the
Land of Promise.

And whenas they stood faithful in his Laws and Statutes, he destroyed their
Enemies before them, even in a wonderful and miraculous manner, so that in
process of time they came to have victory over all their Enemies, and to sit
down in the Land, in Rest and Peace, and the Lord made them a Dread and a
Terror to all Nations round about them, and they built strong Holds and great
fenced Cities, so that they became a mighty People; and as they stood faithful
unto the Lord, he made them as a Sign, and as a Wonder unto all the Nations of
the Earth, so that his Fear and Dread fell upon many that had been Strangers to
(and alienated from) him; and they were set as a City upon a Hill, which could
not be hid, but still there was the Seed of the Serpent lodging in many of
them; for when they were brought to sit down in Rest and Ease, the Seed of the
Serpent came to rise in them, and the pure Seed came to be oppressed, and the
pure Simplicity, that came to be lost, and they rebelled against the Lord, and
transgressed against his pure Laws and Statutes; and they committed Whoredom,
even with the Heathen, and then the Lord raised up his Seed in his Prophers,
and sent many of them unto them, to fore-warn them of the Destruction that
would come upon them, if they still went on in their Rebellion against the
Lord: And as the Lord had set the House of Israel, whilst they stood in his
Statutes, as a Sign, and as a wonder unto the Nations round about them, so now
likewise he has set his Prophets, in whom his Seed is raised, as Signs and
Wonders to the House of Israel, because they were become a rebellious People;
but many of the Prophets they murdered, wherein the same Seed of the Serpent
that was in Cain appeared; and some they cast into Prison, others they
Banished, so that they provoked the Holy One of Israel to Wrath, so that he let
loose the Heathens against them, and suffered them to destroy their Land, and
to lay waste their fenced Cities, and to carry them away Captives into strange
Lands, till he had humbled them, and brought them low; then, when they were in
Distress they called upon him, and cried unto him in the time of their Trouble,
and his Ears were open to them, and then he many times by his Prophets came to
reason with them, and to lay open before them the many Deliverances which he at
sundry times had wrought for them, and of the Largeness of his Love toward
them* and yet how they had all along rebelled against him, and turned his
Righteous Law behind their Backs, and not regarded his Reproofs; but yet, when
he by Afflictions had brought down the Seed of the Serpent, so that they came
low in Heart, and in Mind to be humbled toward him, and to let the oppressed
Seed in them to arise, whose Sighs and Groans were to the Lord, for whose Sake
the Lord brought back again their Captivity, and caused them to rest in their
own Land, in Peace, and Safety; and when he had ruled them many Years by
Judges, then they desired to have a KING, even as all the Nations round about
them had, who were Strangers to God, and in this they provoked the Holy One of
Israel; but yet for his own Seed's Sake he suffered all this and much more, And
gave them a King in his Wrath, even Saul the Son of Kish, and anointed him with
his own Spirit, that he might have Understanding and Wisdom to rule and govern
them, that they might walk humbly in the Statutes of the Lord; but he himself
soon disobeyed the Voice of the Lord, when he was sent to destroy the
Amalekites, that he should not spare old nor young, but slay both Man and
Woman, Infant and Suckling, Ox and Sheep, Camel and Ass; but see how the Seed
of the Serpent arose in Saul, and the Children of Israel, and caused him to
disobey the Commands of God, by sparing Agag (the King of the Amalekites)
alive, and the best of the Sheep and of the Oxen, and of the Fatlings, and of
the ^ambs, and all that was Good, and would not utterly destroy them, but every
thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly, and so provoked
the Spirit of the Lord which anointed him King; and the Lord repented that he
had set up Saul King over Israel, and he rent the Kingdom from him, because his
pure Seed came to be oppressed in him; and so, as he gave [those People] a King
in his Wrath, he took him from them in his Sore Displeasure.

But then he sent his Servant Samuel, whom he anointed to be a Prophet unto the
House of Israel, and sent him unto Saul, to acquaint him that the Lord had rent
the Kingdom from him; and the Spirit of the Lord departed from him, and with it
his Honor; but yet, behold the Subtilty of the Serpent in him, who would have
tempted the Prophettohave honored him before the People, when that in him, to
which the Honor did duly belong, was departed from him; but herein the
Serpent's Head (in some Measure) came to be bruised: Then the Lord sent his
Prophet to anoint David King over Israel, who was the Son of Jesse; for said
the Lord, Behold, I have found a man after my own Heart to reign over Israel;
to whom the Lord promised, that out of his Loins, after the Flesh, should come
the MESSIAH, that should rule over the spiritual Seed of Abraham, and that
there should not want one to sit upon the Throne of David henceforth, even
forever, and that his Kingdom should be an Everlasting Kingdom, and of his
Dominion there should be no End, and the Government should be upon his
Shoulders; this is the great Prophet that Moses foretold of to the Children of
Israel, that should come, saying, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up
from among your Brethren, like unto me, him shall you hear in all things, and
it shall come to pass, that he that will not obey the Voice of this Prophet
shall be cut off from amongst the People.

Now consider what this Moses was, who declares this unto Israel, he was one
whom the Lord preserved in the Court of Pharaoh, in Egypt, which was of the
stock of Israel; and by his Hand the Lord brought many Plagues upon the Land of
Egypt, and by him delivered the Seed of Israel out of their Captivity.

So likewise, this Prophet that the Lord has promised to raise up, like unto
him, from amongst their Brethren, even from within the midst of every man,
which shall bring JUDGMENTS and PLAGUES upon spiritual Egypt, even the Land of
Darkness, and bring Deliverance unto the spiritual Seed of Israel, which now
groans under the Burden of Oppression. This Messiah, even CHRIST, all the
Prophets pointed at him, and prophesied of his Coming, even in the one Body of
Flesh; for they prophesied, That a Virgin should conceive and bear a Son, and
they should call his Name EMANUEL, which by Interpretation is, GOD WITH US; and
he promised To give him for a COVENANT unto the People, and for a LIGHT unto
the Gentiles, that he might be his Salvation unto the End of the Earth; and
that he should put an End unto all Types and Ceremonies, which then the
Children of Israel observed, and were commanded so to do, even by the Lord
their God, and had their Priests, their Levites, their Burnt-Offerings and
Sacrifice, their Heave-Offerings, their Peace Offerings, their Shewbread,
their Passeovers, their New Mons, their Sabbaths, their Solemn-Assemblies,
their Temple and Altar, with the Ark of the Testament; but yet all These were
but Shadows of things which were to come; for the Substance was and is CHRIST;
for the Seed of God was yet (for all this) oppressed in them; for they smote
with the Fist of Wickedness, and many times provoked the Lord to Wrath, so that
he destroyed many of them, and they caused him to say, that though the number
of the Children of Israel were in number as the Sands on the Sea Shore, yet
should there be but a Remnant of them saved, which Remnant was them in whom the
pure Seed of God came to be raised up to bear Rule, and so they came faithfully
to believe in the Promises of God, and so by Faith they came to be saved; for
they came to witness it to give them Victory over Sin, and so they believed in
Christ the Son of God, which was to come, and to be made manifest to the World
in general, and was manifested in them in particular; and of his Coming all the
House of Israel believed, in the Notion, and in a Carnal Sense, but yet in
Process of time, when he came they would not receive him; for the Seed of the
Serpent raised up in them a Heart of Unbelief, so that they were hardened
against the Promise when he came unto them.

And although the Wise Men and the Astrologers could tell Herod, the very Place
and time, when and where he should be born, and although the Lord did send his
Prophet, even John, to bear witness of him, and in baptizing o^ them into
Repentance, and so to prepare the Way before him, so that many of them
believed, that John was sent of God; and although he declared, that there was
one coming after him whose Shoe-latchets he was not worthy to unloose, yet
their Hearts were hardened by the Seed of the Serpent, which ruled in them; so
that when Christ was brought forth amongst them, who was and is the true
Redeemer of the spiritual Seed of Abraham, even the Seed of the Promise, for
which Seed's sake the Lord has all along spared them, and his fierce wrath has
been withheld from breaking forth upon them, so that they were not utterly
destroyed from being a People; but yet his Wrath broke forth soon after upon
them, which burnt in Fury like the Fire, till it had consumed them, and cut
them off from being a People, and scattered them up and down the Earth as
Vagabonds, because of their Hard-Heartedness and Unbelief, which arose in them
from the Seed of the Serpent, because they rejected him whom the Lord had sent
to bruise the Serpent's Head; but before they came to be cut off, do but behold
the Seed of the Serpent how it came to work in them in the Enmity against the
Seed of the woman* even CHRIST, and how in subtilty, as soon as Herod came to
hear of his Birth, under a pretense of worshipping, him he would have slain
him, but the Lord delivered him out of his Hands, by sending him into Egypt,
where he remained till after Herod's Death.

But yet, see how the Bloody Serpent's seed was raised up in Herod, which
caused him to cause all the Children in Bethlehem to be slain; but yet, after
his Death CHRIST JESUS came to be made manifest unto Israel, even in the Land
of Judea, and at Jerusalem, and in all the Regions round about, even by
disputing with the Scribes and the Disputers of the Law, in their Synagogues
and in their Temple, who confounded them by grounded Reasons and strong
arguments, making it appear to them by Scripture, and by evident Signs, and
miraculous Wonders, which he wrought amongst them, that he was the Messiah that
was to come, whereof the Scripture declared, and many there were that believed
in him, and that forsook all to follow him, even of the poor, foolish and
despised by the world; but yet the Seed of the Serpent still ruled in the
great, mighty and potents of Israel after the Flesh, and in the wise Scribes
and Pharisees, and the Rulers of the People, so that their hearts were
hardened, that they could not believe, because he came not according to their
Expectations in their carnal Imaginations; for said they, When Christ comes,
who shall know from whence he comes? but for this Fellow, we know from whence
he is: is not this the Carpenter's Son whose Father and Mother, Sisters and
Brethren are amongst us daily?

So, because he came not according to their proud Wills, which could not stoop
to so mean a thing as the Carpenter's Son, although the Lord had declared by a
Voice from Heaven, that he was his beloved Son, in whom he was well pleased,
and that they were to hear him; yet still they were carried on in Hatred
against him by the Enmity from the cursed seed that reigned in them; and them
in whom the Seed of God came to bear rule, which confessed Christ to be the Son
of God, were hated, despised and called cursed, because they knew not the Law,
and turned out of their Synagogues; and the Enmity increased (daily) in them
against him, so that they (daily) sought Opportunity to take him, that they
might put him to Death; but yet they durst not lay hands on him, because his
appointed time was not yet come: Now the Priests and the Chief Leaders of the
People caused them to err, so that the Scriptures (came to be fulfilled) which
declared, That he should be a Man of Sorrow, and one acquainted with Grief, and
be despised and rejected of men, and that they should hide as it were their
Faces from him, and esteem him as smitten of God and afflicted; so the People
then cried out, That he cast out Devils by the power of Beelzebub, the Prince
of Devils; others they cried out, He was a Companion to Publicans and Sinners;
others, That he was a Sabboth-breaker; others cried out, He has a Devil; why
hear ye him? So there came many false Accusations to be raised up against him
by the seed of the Serpent, and the Enmity which he raised up in them, whose
Head Christ came to bruise.

But yet, notwithstanding all this, many were they that believed on (and
followed after) him, amongst whom he declared the Message unto them which the
Lord had sent him to declare, which was, That he was the Light of the World,
and that whosoever followed him should not abide in darkness, but should have
the Light of Life; and that for Judgment he was come into the world; and that
the Prince of this world might be judged, which should come after him, but had
no part in him; and that he that had formerly had his Sight might be blind, and
that he that had been blind might receive his Sight. And he did many Miracles
amongst them, even Raising the Dead, causing the Lame to walk, and the Blind to
see, and the Deaf to hear, and the Leper to be cleansed; and he exhorted them,
To walk in the Light whilst they had the Light, that they might be the Children
of the Light; and that they should work while they had the Day, for the Night
should come wherein no man could work. And he told even the Scribes and
Pharisees, That the Kingdom of God came not with Observations, that is to say,
Lo here it is at this place, or lo there it is at that place, but that the
Kingdom of God was nigh at hand, even within them, and therefore he often
exhorted them to Repent, and many times spoke to them in Parables, comparing
the Kingdom of Heaven to a Grain of Mustardseed, which should be sown in the
Earth, which is the least among many Grains, yet it should spring up into a
great Tree, wherein the Fowls of the Air might roost; and he compared it to a
lost Groat, which could not be found till the Woman had lighted the Candle and
swept her House; and he compared it to a certain Lord, who went into a far
Country, who called his own Servants, and delivered unto them his Goods, and
unto one he gave five Talents, and unto another two, and unto another one
Talent, to every man according to his several Ability, and streight-way took
his Journey, then he that had received the five Talents went and traded with
the same, and made them other five Talents, and likewise he that had received
two gained also other two; but he that had received one, went and dug in the
Earth, and hid his Lord's Money; after a long time the Lord of those Servants
comes, and reckons with them* and so he that had received five Talents came,
and brought other five Talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five
Talents, behold I have gained besides them five Talents more; his Lord said
unto him, Well done thou good and faithful Servant, thou have ^een faithful
over a few things, I will make thee a Ruler over many things, enter thou into
the Joy of thy Lord; and he also that had received two Talents came, and said,
Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two Talents, behold I have gained other two
Talents besides them; and his Lord said unto him, Well done thou good and
faithful Servant, thou have been faithful over a few things, I will make thee
Ruler over many, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord; then came he which had
received the one Talent, and said, Lord, I knew thee, that thou art an hard
man, reaping where thou have not sown, and gathering where thou have not
strewed, and I was afraid, and went and hid thy Talent in the Earth, lo there
thou have that is thine; his Lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and
sloathful Servant, thou know I reaped where I sowed not, and gathered where
I strewed not, thou ought therefore to have put my Money to the Exchangers,
and then at my coming, I should have received mine own with Usury; take
therefore the Talent from him, and give it to him that has ten Talents; for
unto every one that has, shall be given, and he shall have abundance; but from
him that has not, shall be taken away even that which he has; and cast ye the
Unprofitable Servant into utter Darkness, where shall be Weeping, and Wailing
and Gnashing of Teeth. And he compared the Kingdom unto Ten Virgins* and to
many other things, which would swell into a great Volumn to declare and open
the Mysteries thereof.

Now all this was to be found within man; for there he told them the Kingdom
was, whereunto this was likened; and he advised them, to strive to enter into
the Kingdom; and told them, The Gate was straight, and the Way was narrow,
which leads into it; but the Way was broad, and the Gate wide, that leads into
Destruction: yet nevertheless for all this, the god of the World blinded their
Eyes, and their Hearts were still hardened, although there were some that bore
witness to their Faces, whom they had sent unto Christ to seek to ensnare him
by Words, and testified, That never man spoke like unto him, yet for all this
the Enmity came to burn the more violently in them against him, which Enmity
arose from the Seed of the Serpent which lodged in them, whereby they sought
Opportunity that they might by any Means put him to death which was not unknown
to him, who was the express Image of God the Father, in whom the Godhead
dweltbodily; so that he was the Searcher and Discerner of the Heart, and by his
Light he makes manifest the Secrets thereof; for he saw through the Pharisees,
who made large Profession of God the Father, but yet they rebelled against the
Son of God, whom he had sent a Light into the World, therefore he pronounced Woe
against them, calling them, Blind Leaders of the Blind, and Hypocrites, and
Whited Walls, and likening them unto Painted Sepulchers, which outwardly made a
fair show, but inwardly were full of Rottenness, telling them, that they washed
the Outside of the Platter, but the Inside remained full of Filthiness, and
that they paid Tithes of Cummin, Mint and Annise, when they omitted the
weightier Matters, even Justice and Judgment; these are they that in outward
Appearance did walk as to the Law blameless, yet Christ warned his Disciples to
beware of the Leven of these great Professors, who did all to be seen of Men,
they made Long Prayers in the Synagogues, and loved the Chiefest Place in the
Assemblies, and Greetings in the Marketplace, and would not keep Company with
Publicans nor Sinners, but cried out against Christ, because his Disciples did
eat with Publicans and Sinners; yet nevertheless, Christ told his Disciples,
that unless their Righteousness did exceed the Righteousness of these High
Professing Scribes and Pharisees, they should in no wise enter into the Kingdom
of Heaven: and he many times did dispute with these Professors, who sat in
Moses's Chair, but they being Carnallyminded could not understand him, because
he spoke unto them in a spiritual Sense, therefore what was spoken by him unto
them was as Parables, which they could not understand; and many times his
Sayings were so hard amongst them, that them that believed on him could not
understand; for even his Disciples, whereof he had chosen twelve particularly
unto himself, many times asked him in private, what might be the Meaning of
what he had spoke to them in public: And he sent forth many of his Disciples
to declare his Name abroad in the World, and that they should publish, That
CHRIST, the M^s^ias, who was the Redeemer of the World, which the Prophets
prophesied should come, that now he is come a Light into the World, that
whosoever believes in him should no longer remain in Darkness; and he foretold
to them the Destruction of their Temple and Temple-worships, and that he was
come to put an End to it all, and that they should no longer worship him at
Jerusalem, nor in the Mount at Samaria, but he that will worship the Father,
must worship him in Spirit and in Truth, and that such the Father seeks to
worship him; and that God was and is a Spirit, and those that will worship him,
must worship him in Spirit and in Truth; and he told his Disciples, that he had
chosen them twelve, and yet one of them was a Devil, and he foretold them,
that he should be betrayed by one of them into the Hands of Sinners, and that
they should be all offended because of him; but honest-hearted Peter, who was
one of the 12. told him from the pure Simplicity that lodged in his Heart, that
though they all should forsake him, yet he would not; but Christ saw how
secretly the Seed of the Serpent lodged in him, and so answered him, that
before the Cock should crow he would deny him thrice; and he told them, that
the Shepherd should be smitten, and the Sheep should be scattered, and that the
Chief Priests and Elders should take him by Policy and hale him before the
Judgment Seat, that he should (by them) be put to Death, and that the third day
he should rise again, and that he would go before them into Galilee, and that
no Man could take away his Life, but that he laid it down that he might take it
up again; for he had Power to lay it down, and Power to take it up again, all
which came to pass according as he had said; for the Enmity still arose amongst
the Jews against him from the seed of the Serpent, which lodged in them, and
caused them to combine with the Chief Priests and Elders, who hired Judas
Iscarriot, even one of the twelve, to betray him into their Hands for thirty
Pieces of Silver, and so came with a Band of Soldiers, and with a traiterous
Kiss betrayed him into the Hands of Unreasonable Men, who came forth with Pikes
and Staves, as if he had been a Murderer, whenas he daily taught in their
Synagogues, and disputed with them in their Assemblies, and no Man laid hands
upon him; but now was the Time come wherein the seed of the Serpent must bruise
his Heel, and he must bruise the Serpent's Head; for he had compared his Life
unto a Corn of Wheat, which when it was sowed in the Ground was but one, but
when it sprung up it came to be many; and he said, that the Son of Man must be
lifted up, and when he was, he should draw all Men after him; and he told his
Disciples, that he would come again unto them, and be with them unto the End of
the World, and that he would not leave them comfortless, but he would send them
the Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth, which should lead them into all truth,
and bring all things to their Remembrance, and that he should convince the
World of Sin, of Righteousness and of Judgment; and that he was the good
Shepherd, that would lay down his Life for the Sheep, and that all the rest
were but Thieves and Robbers, whose own the Sheep were not.

But now, thou that read, do but consider and behold how mightily the Enmity
which is placed betwixt these Two Seeds works in each of them one against the
other, see how the Seed of the Serpent arises to bruise the Seed of the
Woman's Heel in the Disciples of Christ, and them that had believed in him,
when he was betrayed, and taken and bound and sent away to the Judgment Seat,
how the Seed of the Serpent raised up Doubtings, and Fear, and Questionings in
them, whether he were the CHRIST yea or nay, whereby the pure Seed of God in
them came as it were to have its Heel bruised for that present time, and they
all forsook him, except Peter only, in whom the Seed of God was raised up in
something a higher Measure then the rest; but yet in the very time of Trial,
when he cane to be questioned concerning Christ the Seed of the Serpent raised
up in him a slavish Fear, which caused him to deny Christ, even with Oaths; but
then the Cock cr^w, and he remembered Christ's Words, and he went forth and wept
bitterly: Now see also the Strivings that were betwixt the Two Seeds in Pilate,
how from the honest Simplicity of the Seed of God which lodged in him, he
consessed, he found no Fault in him whom they called the King of the Jews, but
would have loosed him from the Bands of Death; but yet see the Workings of the
subtle Serpent in him, which raised up a Fear in him of displeasing the
People, whose Mouths were continually opened unto him, crying out, Away with
this Fellow, crucify him, he is not worthy to live upon the Earth: Now behold
what a straight Pilate was in between two, even in himself; they cried out,
That they would have Christ crucified, and Barabas the Murderer delivered to
them, and his Wife sent to him, That he should have no hand in the Death of
that just man; for She had been much troubled in a Dream concerning him, and
that of God in his own Conscience testified unto him, That he was innocent of
the things whereof he stood accused before him; then the Seed of the Serpent
rose up in him, and caused him to work wickedness in Hypocrisy, and caused him
to call out unto the People, and to tell them, that he would not have any Hand
in the Death of this man, but that his Blood should be upon them, and upon
their Children, and they all cried out that it might be so, so Pilate called
for Water, and washed his Hands, and said, That he was innocent, as concerning
the Blood of this Just Man; and so he delivered him unto them to be crucified,
who formerly had great Strivings in his Body of Flesh, in so much that it
caused him to sweat Drops of Blood; so likewise now upon the Cross the Seed of
the Serpent so bruised his Heel whereat he cried, MY GOD, MY GOD, why have thou
for saken me? but at his Departing, when he yielded up the Ghost, then the Seed
of the Woman began to rise to bruise the Serpent's Head, when the Vail of the
Temple rent, and the Rocks clave, and the Graves opened, and many of the Saints
that had slept came forth, and Darkness came over the Earth; then Fear and
Dread fell upon the Hearts of many, and the Serpent's Head was bruised down in
them, so that they confessed, that they believed, he was the Son of God: And
although they buried him in a strong Sepulcher, and rolled a mighty Stone upon
the Mouth thereof, and although the chief Priests and Elders sealed it with
their own Seal, and set Soldiers over it to watch him, lest any Man should
steal him away in the Night, yet the third Day he rose again, according to the
Scriptures, in such a Miraculous Manner, that the Sight thereof struck Dread
and Amazement upon the Soldiers, which caused them to for sake the Sepulcher
and to go and tell it to the Chief Priests and Elders, yet see the Subtilty of
the Serpent, how it wrought in them to cover the Guilt from the sight of Men,
and how he turned his Head to save it from bruising, in causing them to give
the Soldiers Money, that they might go their way and report, That whilst they
were asleep his Friends came and stole him away from them; yet nevertheless he
appeared unto many after he was risen from the dead; for the Bands of Death
could not hold him: And the first which saw him after his Resurrection was
Mary, who stood weeping without at the Sepulcher, and Jesus said unto her,
Woman, why weepest thou? who seek thou? She supposing him to be the Gardener
said unto him, Sir, if thou have born him hence, tell me where thou have laid
him, and I will take him aw^y, Jesus said unto her, Mary, she turned her self
and said unto him, Raboni, which is to say, Master, Jesus said unto her, touch
me not, but go unto my Brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father and
your Father, and to my God and your God; and Mary Magdalen came and told the
Disciples, that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto
her; and now the Seed of the Woman was raised up mightily to bruise the
Serpent's Head: He afterward app^ared unto his Disciples at sundry times and
Places, bidding them to go and preach the Gospel to all Nations; and he told
them, that he would be with them to the End of the World, and commanded them to
go to Jerusalem, and there to wait till they should receive Power from on high,
even the Holy Ghost the Comforter, which he had promised to them before; and he
told them, that after the Holy Ghost was come upon them, They should be
Witnesses unto him, both in Jerusalem and in Judea, and in Samaria, and unto
the uttermost Parts of the Earth, which accordingly came to pass, when they
were met together with one accord, on the Day of Pentecost; for there suddenly
came a Sound from Heaven, as of a rushing mighty Wind, and it filled all the
House, where they were sitting, and there appeared upon them cloven Tongues as
of Fire, and sat upon each of them, and they were all filled with the Holy
Ghost, and began to speak with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them Utterance;
and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men out of every Nation under
Heaven, and now when this was noised abroad the Multitude came together and
were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own Language,
and they were all amazed, and marvailed saying one to another, Behold, are not
all these that speak Galileans, and how hear we every man in our own Tongue
wherein we were born, we do hear them speak in our own Tongues the Wonderful
Works of God; and they were all amazed and in doubt, saying one to another,
what means this! Now the Seed of the Woman was raised up in many of these
devout men, and the Serpent's Head came to be bruised; but yet there were
others in whom the Seed of the Serpent ruled, which caused them to mock and to
say, These men are full of New Wine, but Peter was raised up amongst them by
the Power of the Almighty to declare unto them the Eternal Truth of God,
whereby the Serpent's Head came to be bruised in many, and the Seed of God to
be raised up, even in three thousand, whose Souls were then converted; and the
Seed of the Woman still prevailed more and more, and the Apostles went on in
the Dread and in the Authority of the Lord, declaring unto the Nations what tho
Lord had made manifest in them, even by the Operation of his Powerful Spirit;
and they turned People from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of the
Serpent, even Satan, to the Power of God, which was Christ in them the Hope of
Glory; and they told People, that Christ was in them except they were
Reprobates; yet they met with strong Oppositions, even within them and without
them, which arose from the Seed of the Serpent, but yet they witnessed the
Cross of Christ to be the Power of God to Salvation. Now do but behold how
suddenly the Seed of the Serpent came to be destroyed in Paul, even by the Seed
of the Woman, who bruised his Head, who being a violent Persecuter came
suddenly to be convinced, even by the Voice of Christ Jesus the Light of the
World, which Light shined round about him, and he became Blind to what he had
formerly seen, and that Eye which formerly was blinded, came to be opened and
that Eye which formerly had been opened came to be shut, and the Scales fell
from off them, and that Tongue that had formerly been drunk came to sound forth
the Praises of the Lord in the Declaration of his glorious Gospel; and not only
Paul, but whole Nations, came to be converted unto God, and to be turned from
Darkness unto the Light of the glorious Gospel, and the Sound of God's mighty
Day went through all the Earth; this was a good Day, wherein Christ warned his
Disciples, that they should work; but yet this Day was to be darkened; for
Christ told them, That the Night should come wherein no man could work; for he
saw, that the Seed of the Serpent yet lodged in many of them, who then
professed him, therefore he gave his Disciples Warning of them, and told them
by what Signs they should know them, which were, That they should come in
Sheeps Clothing, a fair outward Show, but inwardly ravened from the Nature of
the Sheep, and the Wolfish Nature should lodge in them, which would make a Prey
of the Sheep, and continually seek to devour them; and this Nature did arise
from the Seed of the Serpent which lodged in the Hearts of many, and came
afterward to work in a Mystery, even in the Mystery of Iniquity, and this was
the man of Sin, which sat in the Temple of God, as God, and exercised himself
above all that is called God, which was then veiled and not known, except unto
a few, to whom the Man of Sin came to be revealed, and the Everlasting Day of
the Lord came to be known, and they came to give forth their Testimony from the
Seed of God which was raised up in them, that the Ends of the World were come
upon them, and that the latter times were come, whereof Christ had forewarned
them wherein Antichrist should come, and that he was then in their Days come;
and that there were many Antichrists then gone forth into the world, which
Antichrists made up the one great Antichrist in Process of time, and they
declared, that the Mystery of Iniquity did then in their Days begin to work;
and that the Form of Godliness should come to be followed, and the Power of
Godliness to be denied: And the Apostle exhorted the Thessalonians, Not to be
troubled, neither by Word, nor by Spirit, nor by Letter, as from us, that the
Day of Christ is at Hand: So he declared, that there should be a Night; for
else he had not spoken of a Day to be at hand, which Night was then drawing on,
therefore he advised the aforesaid Thessalonians, Not to let any man deceive
them by any Means, as concerning the Day of the Lord; for that Day should not
come except there came a Night, or a Falling away first, that the Man of Sin
might be revealed, the Son of Perdition, which Man was conceived from the Seed
of the Serpent, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God,
or that is worshipped; so that he as God, sits in the Temple of God, showing
himself that he is God, even the God of the world, who blinds the eye of the
mind of many. And the Apostle declared unto the forementioned People, that the
Mystery of Iniquity did already work, only he who now lets would let until
he were taken out of the Way, and then should that wicked one be revealed, whom
the Lord would consume with the Spirit of his Mouth, and destroy with the
Brightness of his Coming. And the Apostles declared, That Perilous times were
at hand, and should come, wherein men should be Lovers of themselves, more then
Lovers of God, and that they should be Proud, Heady, High*minded men, and
should have a Form of Godliness, but should deny the Power; they should be
such, who seek after filthy Lucre, and through Covetousness should make
Merchandise of Souls for dishonest Gain, and they should be Fierce, Despisers
of them that are good, and should speak Evil of Things they know not, but what
they know, is naturally, as Bruit Beasts, and in those Things they corrupt
themselves; these are Murmurers and Complainers, walking after their own Lusts,
and their Mouths speaking great swelling Words, having men's Persons in
Admiration, because of Advantage; these are as raging Waves of the Sea foaming
out their own Shame, Wandering Stars, to whom is reserved the Blackness of
Darkness forever, therefore the Woe is unto them; for they have gone in the Way
of Cain, and run greedily after the Error of Balaam, even for Gifts and
Rewards: And Enoch the Seventh from Adam prophesied of these, saying, Behold,
the Lord comes in Ten Thousand of his Saints to execute Judgments upon all,
and to convince all that are Ungodly amongst them, of all their Ungodly Deeds,
which they have ungodlily committed; and of all their Hard Speeches, which
Ungodly Sinners have spoke against him. Now these were the Ministers of
Darkness, therefore they have wrought in the dark, and their Deeds have been
the Deeds of Darkness; and these are they that have kept People in Blindness
and Ignorance some Thirty, some Forty and some an Hundred Years, even all their
Life*time, ever learning, but they never came to the Knowledge of the Truth by
them, and these are they which have taught for Doctrine the Precepts of Men,
and their Precepts are contrary to the Scriptures, and are as follows.

First, They tell People, That the Scriptures are the Word of God, when there
is no such thing mentioned in the Scriptures; but they declare, that Christ was
the Word, which was in the beginning with God, and was God.

2dly, They tell People of a Sacrament, and some of them of several Sacraments,
and of Three Persons in the Trinity; when the Scripture declares no such thing;
yet the Father, Son and holy Ghost we own, which is but one.

3dly, They Sprinkle Infants with Water, and tell the People, They are adopted
into Christ, and are thereby become Members of his Body, when there is neither
Command nor Example in all the Scriptures for any such thing.

4thly, They tell People, That the First Day of the Week is the Sabbath Day,
and ought to be kept more holy then any other Day; when there was no such thing
commanded by Christ nor any of the Apostles.

5thly, They have told the People, That the House made of Lime and Stone is the
Church, and the Temple of God, wherein the Lord dwells; when the Scripture
declares no such thing, but the Contrary, that is, that God dwells not in
Temples made with Hands.

6thly, They taught the People to observe Days and Set Times, as
Christ*mas*day, and Children*mas-day, and Lamm^s-d^y, and Candle-masday, and
Michael's-mas-day, with Easter, and their Good Friday, and their Whitsuntide,
and Shrovetide, and many other Saints Days, which are tedious (here) to
mention, whereof the Scripture makes no mention.

And they have told the People, That Tithes and Offerings are due to them, and
Easter-Reckonings, and Midsummer-Dues, and Smoke-Pennys, and Reek-Pennys, and
Money for Eggs and Gardens, with their great fair House and Glebe-Lands,
whereby they, their Wives and Families, may live even in the Sins of Sodom,
which were Pride, abundance of Idleness and Fullness of Bread.

Now this, which they call their Dues, is the very Pillar and Ground upon which
their Gospel and Ministry stands; for let this be but taken away, and down fall
they, with their Gospel and Ministry, which some of them have not been ashamed
to declare in public.

Now the Scripture declares not any such thing, neither is there any mention
made of such Maintenance to be Compelled from the People to maintain them that
are the True Ministers, who are Called and Chosen, and sent abroad from Country
to Country, and from City to City, to declare the Glorious Gospel, that the
Sound thereof might reach even to the Ends of the Earth; and as they received
freely, so they were to give freely; and into what City soever they came, they
were to enquire who was worthy, and there to remain eating such things as were
set before them; for, the Labourer is worthy of his Meat.

Now, thou that read, consider in thy own Heart; think thou that the Lord
God of Life has entrusted his Glorious Gospel in the Hands of such Hirelings,
as beforementioned, who would not declare it to the Poor and Needy, whereunto
it is the Glad-Tidings of Salvation, because they have not wherewithal to
satisfy them for it? Nay, verily nay; the Lord never intended any such thing;
but he sent his Prophets to cry out to every one that thirsts, that they might
come unto the Waters, and take Wine and Milk without Money and without Price.
And John witnesses that the Spirit says Come, and the Bride says Come, and
whosoever is athirst may come, and take of the Water of Life freely: And Paul
affirms, That he did not eat any Man's Bread for naught, but wrought with
Labor and Travail, Night and Day, that he might not be Chargeable to any; but
he commanded, that if any would not Work, neither should he eat. Therefore
their Maintenance was not so large, neither did they sit down in one Place to
preach the Gospel, some Ten, some Twenty and more years, and so sit at Ease in
Pride and Idleness, compelling their Maintenance from the People, and making
Friends to the Rulers and Magistrates, having their Persons in Admiration that
they may have the Advantage of the Law against the People, that they may have
their Goods by Violence, and cast their Bodies into Prison, if they Refuse to
put into their Mouths, to satisfy their Lusts, as those which have ruled in
this long Night of Apostasy have done. But the True Apostles, who labored with
their own Hands, and travailed up and down in Hunger and in Cold, who were
counted as Vagabonds, and not worthy to live upon the Earth, by them in whom
the seed of the Serpent ruled; they foretold the People, that such Ravening
Wolves should come, who should make a Prey upon the Sheep; and as there had
been False Prophets in all ages before them, even so there should arise False
Teachers amongst them, who privily should bring in Damnable Heresies, even
denying the Lord that bought them, and bringing upon themselves swift
Destruction, and many should follow their pernicious Ways, by reason of whom
the Way of Truth should be evil-spoken of; and through covetousnes they should
with Feigned Words make Merchandise of the People: And they likewise declared,
That in the Latter Times there should come Scoffers, walking after their own
Lusts, and saying, Where is the Promise of the Lord's Coming? for since the
Fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of the
Creation: And these were they who had forsaken the right way, and gone astray
following the Way of Balaam the Son of Boser, who loved the Wages of
Unrighteousness; these are Wells without Water, even broken Cisterns that can
hold no Water, Clouds that are carried with a Tempest, to whom the Mist of
Darkness is reserved forever; for, while they promise Liberty to others they
themselves are Servants to Corruption.

Now, many Years were not to be expired before these should come, who were the
Antichrists and the False Christ's; for the Apostle John declared, that the
Latter Times were then, even in his days, in these words, saying, Little
Children, it is the Last Time, and as ye have heard, that Antichrist shall
come, even now are there many Antichrists, whereby we know that it is the Last
Time; they went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of
us, they would (no doubt) have continued with us; but these went out that they
might be made manifest that they were not of us.

Now, these Antichrists were they who had been amongst the Apostles, and in
Fellowship with them, as to Outward Appearance, so that thereby they came to
get the Form of Godliness, but had not the Life nor the Power.

Now, do but behold how subtly the seed of the Serpent came to work in them
against the Seed of the Woman, even secretly, as in a Mystery, whereby it could
not so easily be discovered as it had formerly been; for now it had as it were
a Covering to hide it self under, even the Form of Godliness, and a Likeness of
Truth: for those False Apostles went forth from the True Apostles into the
World, and the World received them, and went after them; so that in process of
time the Form of Godliness came to be followed, and to be cried up in all the
Earth, and the Life and Power thereof to be lost and forgotten.

Now, the Seed of the Serpent lodged under the Form or Likeness of Truth, but
could not lodge in the Truth it self; for therein lodges the Seed of the
Woman, which is to bruise his Head; so that under the Form and Likeness of
Truth he has made War with the Truth it self; and wherever the Seed of God
has appeared in any, they have been destroyed by them in whom the seed of the
Serpent ruled; John in his Revelations saw it all in a Vision, he saw that
which had whored from God to make War against the True Spouse, and to drink the
Blood of the Saints and Martyrs of Jesus Christ, and to cause all (to worship
her) both great and small, rich and Poor, high and low, bond and free, and to
receive her Mark, and those that refused it came to be slain amongst them,
where Satan's Seat is; and now the Glorious Sun was set, and the Night was come
whereof Christ had forewarned his Disciples, and Truth was as it were banished
from the Earth, so that in length of Time that seed that had whored from the
Life and Power of Godliness came likewise to depart from the very Form of
Godliness also; for the seed of the Serpent has not any Love to the Form of
Godliness, but only because it could not so well come (as it were) to eat out
the Life and the Power any other ways; but now it even departed from the Form
likewise, and came to set up Invented Traditions, which is, to worship Saints,
and Images, and the like, which is not any part of the Form of Godliness, but
of the old Heathenish Worship under which the seed of the Serpent formerly
lodged, which was to worship the Sun, Moon and Stars; and such like vain things.

And now, when at any time the Lord raised up his Seed in any to bear their
Testimony against the Heathenish Ways and Customs of Men, and to make manifest
the Way of Truth, according as the Lord has revealed it unto them; then the
Seed of the Serpent arises in them in whom it rules, and causes them even to
Murder, Destroy or Banish them, according as the Lord permits; and thus has
the Prince of Darkness ruled in all this long Night of Apostasy, since the
Days of the Apostles, and caused Millions of Thousands to be Murdered for
satisfying of Lusts. Now, this was a Murderer from the Beginning, therefore all
that cross his Kingdom will he Murder and Destroy; for, by him the Lamb of God
was slain, who was Dead and is alive, and lives forever.

Now, thou that read, do but look into these latter Times, even within these
few Years, and thou shall see how the seed of the Serpent has made a Prey of
those in whom the Seed of God has been raised; see in Queen Mary's days, what
Burning, what Imprisoning, what Torturing was there exercised upon them who had
the seed of God raised up in them, and could not Worship the Beast, in which
the seed of the Serpent lodged, nor receive his Mark, they rather chused to
bear all that could be inflicted upon them; so that by their Means the seed of
the Serpent came again to be discovered, so that he was feign in some measure
to creep under the Form of Godliness again, whereby to Shelter himself, and to
save his Head from bruising.

Now behold the Weapons of these two Seeds; for as their Natur^s are Contrary
one to the other, so likewise are their Weapons; for the seed of the Serpent's
Weapons are Carnal, and therefore he has exercised his Tyranny upon the
outward, fleshly or carnal Bodies of them in whom the Seed of God has been
raised: And the Saints, in whom the Seed of the Promise has been raised, their
Weapons are Spiritual, and Mighty through God, to the throwing down of the
strong Holds of Sin; and they War not with Flesh and Blood, neither do they any
harm to men's Persons, but they war with Principalities and Powers, and
spiritual Wickedness in high Places; so that when the seed of the Serpent has
exercised his Cruelty at any time upon their carnal or fleshly Bodies, they
have not at any time resisted in the least, but have born and suffered all in
Patience, knowing that therein they were to possess their Souls; so that by
their Patience the Serpent's head has (many times) been bruised, whereby they
have (as it were) obtained victory over their Enemies. Now look but back since
the Beginning of Charles late King of England his reign, and there thou may
see how the seed of the Serpent has been (by the seed of God) chased out of
one Form into another, and how he has shifted to and fro to save his Head from
bruising: See in Charles's time how the seed of the Serpent lodged in the
Bishops and Prelates, and how it was drawing out of the Form of Godliness again
into the heathenish Way of Worship; but see how the Lord has (then) raised up
a People, in whom his seed was manifest, who bore their Testimony against those
Bishops and Prelates, in whom the contrary seed lodged, who came to be hated,
and in scorn and derision called Puritants, and were rendered by them (as
Separates* Deceivers and Deluders) in whom the seed of the Serpent ruled; for
therein lies the subtilty of the Serpent, to charge the Truth with that, which
he himself is guilty of; so that at all times the seed of God and his eternal
Truth has been persecuted (by the Serpent and his seed) under the Name of
Error Heresy and Blasphemy. So those People came to be imprisoned, fined, and
many of them banished; but yet see how the Judgments of the Lord came both upon
King, Bishops, Prelates and Priests, and how the Serpent came to have his Head
bruised in them, who raised up a War in the Nation, whereby they came to be cut
off from the Face of the Earth, and all stood in a tottering Condition, so that
the seed of the Serpent was fain to endeavor to shelter himself under a more
smoother Form of Godliness then he had done in many years before, even under
the Presbyterian Form: but then the Lord raised up his seed in a People, who
could not be satisfied under that Form; for the Light, even Christ, shined in
them, and let them see many gross Errors in it, and caused them to withdraw
from having Fellowship with them; and these in scorn came to be called (by the
rude Multitude) Independants; but they also came soon after into a Form, so
that there was a ground in them wherein the seed of the Serpent might lodge,
therefore it soon entered into that Form, and likewise corrupted it: but then
the Lord raised up his seed again in some of them, and caused them to depart
from them, out of that Form, and to give their Testimony against the Errors
thereof, which arose from the seed of the Serpent; and these came by the rude
Multitude to be called Anabaptists; but these soon departed from the pure Life,
that arose in them from the seed of God in them, and came into Imitation of
what the Saints of God had done in former Ages, and so came into a Form of
Godliness* and the Life and Simplicity, which first moved in them, came to be
lost, and there came a ground wherein the seed of the Serpent could lodge,
therefore he soon entered into that Form* and likewise corrupted it, yet the
Lord still followed him with his Light, which shined in these dark Forms, and
caused many of them to see that there is nothing but Emptiness and Barrenness
in that Form, and that their Souls (therein) could not be satisfied; and then
they came into a more purer Way, and Likeliness of the Truth, then any of the
former, and they bore their Testimony against all the Forms through which they
had come; for they saw (by the Light of Christ) the Deceit that lodged in them,
and so they came to a Way of seeking, and waiting on the Lord; but yet they
likewise came (again) into a Form, and there was a kind of a ground amongst
them, wherein the seed of the Serpent could remain; for the Serpent can turn
himself into the likeness of any thing, even into the very likeness of the Way,
the Life, and the Truth; but though he can transform himself into the Form of
an Angel of Light, and into the Likeness of Truth, yet he cannot come into the
Way, nor into the Life it self, nor into the Truth, therefore now is the Lord
raising up a People after all this who shall worship him in Spirit and in
Truth, out of all Forms and Likenesses, so that in them the Lord will destroy
and judge out all that ground, wherein the seed of the Serpent can lodge, so
that the Serpent's Head is come to be bruised in many Thousands in their
particulars, and as it is begun in the particulars, so likewise it shall at
length be bruised in the general, and the seed that has long groaned unto God
shall be delivered from under the Burden of Oppression; for now after all this
long dark night of Apostasy, which has been for this 1600. and odd years,
wherein the Lord has been as it were a stranger unto the Sons and Daughters of
Men, and they have lived (as it were) without God in the World, taking pleasure
and delight in the vanities thereof, and their foolish Hearts have caused them
to err; but now is the Day sprung from on high even the mighty Day of the Lord,
therefore the night must vanish away; for the Darkness cannot stand before the
Brightness of his Coming, nor before the Gloriousness of his Appearance,
therefore it is time for the Prince of Darkness to arise and to gather together
the uttermost of his Strength; for now is his Kingdom invaded on every Side,
even by the Lamb and his Followers, who is risen to make War in Righteousness,
and by patient suffering shall overcome his Kingdom, and bruise the Serpent's
Head. Now thou that read, have thou not heard of a People, who dare not
swear, nor dare not tell a Lie, who cannot stoop nor bow their Knees, nor put
off their Hats in Honor to any man's Person in the World, and which cannot
give any vain flattering Titles to man, neither can have any Fellowship with
workers of Iniquity, neither can they enter into any excess of Riot with them,
neither dare they speak any other Language then that which the Saints in former
Ages spoke, and stand as Witnesses against all vain Talks and foolish Jesting,
and cannot respect the Person of any man because therein they should commit
Sin; who dare not to do unto any man, but as they would be done unto in the
like Condition; who bears their Testimony against all the vain Worships of the
World, and all deceitful Professors, who profess God in Words* but deny him in
their Lives and Conversations? and have thou not at sometimes heard their very
Enemies say, that they believed that many of them were honest People, and that
their dealing toward them has been honest and just? and have thou not heard,
that some of them have wished, that they could live as those People do? and
have thou not heard the People of the World report, of what undaunted Spirits
those People are, who fear not the Frowns, nor the lofty looks of the greatest
Potent upon the Face of the Earth? and on the other side, have thou not heard
the rude People of the World, (even Drunkards, Swearers, Liars and Covetous
Persons, and such as live in all manner of Excess of Riot) cry out, that these
are Deceivers, Deluders and Blasphemers, and that they are not worthy to live
upon the face of the Earth; and have thou not heard what petitioning to the
Powers of the Earth there has been against them, and what stocking, stoning,
knocking down in their public Assemblies, haling before Magistrates, whipping
and sending to the Bridewels, and what long Imprisonments have been suffered by
many, and by some (even to the Death) who have thereunto been committed by the
power of the Earth? and have thou not heard of what those People have suffered
in New England, by the great red Dragon, who is risen in those People, who once
fled out of Old-England, even for Fear of that which they now exercise in a far
greater measure upon those whom the Lord has sent amongst them, to declare
(the Appearance of his mighty Day) unto them, who in their time in Old-England
should have born their Testimony against the Bishops, Prelates, and Priests,
and have stood in the Cross to that (in their own Walls) which caused them to
flee from the Sufferings, and so from the Cross which should have crucified
that Nature, which they carried with them out of Old-England, even that which
is now risen in them, which causes them to exercise such grievous Tortures upon
the Bodies of those whom the Lord has sent amongst them, even imprisoning and
whipping, casting into Dungeons and nasty Holes, beating with Ropes, until
their Flesh became as Gelly, whereby they are given to such a hardness of
Heart, that they have exceeded all Nations under the Sun in Tyranny, the very
Turks themselves have stood more in the Fear and Dread of the Lord then they;
for they continually thirst after Blood, who after they have cut off the Ears
of the Lord's People, which no Nation under the Heavens (except themselves) did
dare to do, yet they not thinking that sufficient, have since drunk two more
larger Draughts then (then ever yet was drunk by any in this our Age) of
innocent Blood, whose Righteous Lives will stand as a Brand of Infamy upon them
and their Generation to all Eternity, and when the Lord makes Inquisition for
Blood that will not be forgotten. Now have thou heard that at any time, these
People ever plotted or contrived any way or means whereby to defend themselves
by the Arm of flesh, or that they have risen, or were defended by the Powers of
the Earth at any time? but at all times the Powers of the Earth stood against
them and opposed them* and yet do thou not see* that these People have daily
increased, and how many are daily gathered unto them, and how they daily learn
to bear the Reproaches of Moab, and the Revilings of the Children of Ammon. and
are contented to bear and suffer all with Patience, so that in their suffering
they may glorify God, and therein become more then Conquerers by the Power of
Christ, who is risen in them, and is become the Captain of their Salvation?
Now, whoever thou art that read consider seriously in thy own Heart; for
here thou see the Division that is made between them that fear the Lord, and
them that fear him not, if thou can with a single Eye behold it; but if thou
standst in doubt, as yet, concerning this thing, come but into a true
Examination in thy own Heart and Conscience; for assuredly there is something
in the Matter, therefore what think thou? do thou think that it is for
naught, that these People forsake their Goods and Lands, their Wives and
Children, and become, as it were strangers, even unto their Country and to
their Father's House; and to travail from Country to Country, through
Persecutions and Sufferings, through Mockings and Reproaches, through Hunger
and Cold, and so come to be counted as Vagabonds and Wanderers, having no
Habitation in the Earth, that they might have a Habitation in God? for Cain he
was a Vagabond, although he builded a City, and called it by his Son's Name,
yet he had no Habitation in God, therefore was he a Vagabond; but these who
have a Habitation in God, they are no Vagabonds, but have sought, and have
found the City whose Builder is God, and they are willing and contented to part
with all, so that they may have a Habitation in that City.

But now herein stands the clear Truth of the Difference, the appointed time is
now come, and drawing near, even at the very Door wherein the Lord God is risen
and arising to fulfill his Promise, which he promised unto Adam in the Garden of
Eden after his Fall, that is, That the Seed of the Woman should bruise the
Serpent's Head, and he should bruise his Heel: And now is he come and coming,
who will cut Rahab, and wound the Dragon, and bruise to powder the very Head of
the Deceit and the Iniquity, which have long lodged in the Hearts of the Sons
and Daughters of Men. And now is the Stone, even the Stone which is elect and
precious, which is to be laid in Sion, which is the chief Cornerstone, that
the Builders have long refused, which Stone has long lain buried in the
Mountain of Sin and Transgression; but now is the Stone cutting it self out of
the Mountain, which shall smite at the Feet of the Image, even at the very
Ground and Foundation of Iniquity; and this Stone will become a Mountain, which
shall cover the whole Earth, which the Mountain of the House of the Lord, which
is to be established atop of all Mountains and above the Hills, and the Nations
shall flow unt^ it. Therefore seeing the Treader upon the Serpent's Head is
come, and has made himself manifest in many, therefore has Pangs taken hold
on many of them in whom the seed of the Serpent bears rule, so that that Seed
strives and struggles in them, even as a Dying Man, on whom the Pangs of Death
had taken hold; and this is the Cause that them in whom the seed of the Serpent
still rules in power, are so bitter and invitered against the Seed of the
Woman, in whom its raised: but yet, though they raise up the uttermost of their
Forces, and gather together Gog and Magog, and come up even the whole breadth
of the Earth to encompass the Camp of the Saints about, yet they shall not
prosper; for this John saw in his Revelation, and he likewise saw a Fire come
out of Heaven, and devoured them; therefore do I in tender Love to thee advise
thee to consider of these things, and lay them to Heart; for this is the Day of
thy Visitation, therefore trifle it not away for mere Vanity and things of
naught; for it passes away from thee faster then thou art aware of; for this is
the Time which the Lord has given thee to make thy Calling and Election sure:
Therefore be not like foolish Esau, sell not thy Birthright for a Mess of
Pottage, for if thou do, thou will hereafter come to seek it (perhaps) with
Tears, when thou may not attain it; therefore while the Lord is yet so
tender toward thee, who stands with his Arm of Mercy spread open, ready to
receive thee, therefore tarry not, but arise and come away; for the Winter is
near spent, and the Summer draws on, the Fig Tree has put forth her Bud, and
the Vine her tender Grape, and the singing of Birds and the Voice of the Turtle
is heard in our Land; and now after all this Dark Night of Apostasy is the
Glorious Day dawned and dawning unto many, which many precious Souls have
longed and breathed after, desiring that they might have seen it, but they
could not attain thereunto, but by Faith; therefore consider what Age and
Generation thou art fallen in, even in a Day that is neither dark nor light,
but as the Evening-tide, wherein the Son of Man is come and coming, therefore
trim up thy Lamp, and provide Oil in thy Vessels; for verily, the Bridegroom is
coming, and the Voice of them who rejoice and sing Halelujah thereat is heard,
therefore prepare and come away, left thou be shut out of the Bride-chamber,
and so remain in Eternal Darkness, even with the Prince thereof, and his
Legions, who is bound up in Everlasting Chains of Darkness, never more to come
into the Light; therefore this is the Word of the Lord God unto thee, whoever
thou art, Rich or Poor, High or Low, If thou slight this the Day of thy
Visitation, which the Lord (out of his tender Mercy) has freely given to thee,
the time will come that thou will see these things to be an Everlasting Truth,
then thou will see how thou have spent thy precious Time in Vanity. Therefore
come unto the Light; come unto that which makes manifest Iniquity in thy own
Heart, for that is the Light, and obey it, that thou may find Eternal Peace
and Rest to thy Soul.

A Word of Love unto the Sons and Daughters of Zion, and a Hand held forth unto
them who are yet in Egypt's Captivity, and to them who are yet in the Desert
Wilderness.
My dear Friends, you whom the Lord has gathered and is gathering into the
Chosen Generation, and into the Royal Priesthood; and you whose Garments are
washed in the Blood of the Lamb, which has been slain from the Foundation of
the World, which Lamb of God you can behold and witness, that he is come, and
has taken and is taking away the Sins of many, who have formerly lived in the
World, but now they are come to be chosen out of the World, and are many of
them become a peculiar People unto the Lord; therefore you dear Sons and
Danghters of Zion, arise let your Light shine forth into the dark World, that
you may be faithful Witnesses, that Zion's Redeemer is come, and is redeeming
Zion through Judgments, and her Converts through Righteousness, that so they
who turn Judgments into Wormwood, and Righteousness into Hemlock, may come to
see the Gloriousness of Zion's Light to shine forth through you, that (...)
Shame may come to cover their Faces, and the Dread and Astonishment of the Lord
may take hold of them; for assuredly Friends, this I know, that as you stand in
the pure Light, and in Obedience to the Measure of God made manifest in you,
your Words and Actions being all spoken and acted therein, will reach to the
Witness of God in all Hearts, and in all Consciences; and so, as you stand
faithful to the Lord, he will make you a Dread and a Terror to your Enemies,
let them be ever so many; and you will triumph over them all in the Lord; yea,
the Devils shall bend and bow before you: Neither shall the Gates of Hell or
Death prevail against you; for you are of the Seed of Abraham, which are
numberless, to whom the Lord has sent a Deliverer to redeem you out of your
Captivity, even out of spiritual Egypt, and the House of Bondage; therefore
dear Friends be wise, and walk circumspectly, and let the Tenderness of your
Love flow forth freely one to another; for the Lord your Redeemer is Love, and
those that follow him are begotten into Love, therefore Christ Jesus the
Captain of our Salvation, gave a remarkable Sign whereby all men might know
that you are his Disciples, which was, Your Love one toward another; therefore
let your Moderation and Love appear to all men, that so they may be convinced
in their own Consciences, that the Lord is at hand; for verily Friends, there
is yet a mighty Seed which is under the Hand of hard hearted Pharach, who will
not let Israel go free to worship the Lord his God; but the Lord is raising up
his Prophet like unto Moses, who shall bring Plagues and Vengeance upon
spiritual Pharaoh, even that corrupt Nature, which lodges in the Hearts of the
Sons and Daughters of Men, which oppresses the Seed of God, which Seed groans
under the burden of Oppression, unto whose sighs and groans the Ears of the
Lord God of Hosts are opened, and he will redeem it all in his own appointed
time, therefore Dear Friends, as the Lord has spared us in our Transgressions,
and in our Iniquities, even for his own Seed Sake, that his Mercies might be
made known by us unto the World; let us now wait with Patience until the Lord
has finished his own work, who will redeem his own Seed in his time, that so
we may all sit down in his everlasting Land of Rest when Pharaoh and all his
Egyptian host shall be destroyed, even in the red Sea of his Wrath, therefore
thou s^ed of Zion arise, and show thy self forth in thy Beauty, that so Fear
and Amazement may take hold on all thine Adversaries: And you Sons and
Daughters of Zion, come forth and appear in your Might; for before your Faces
all Flesh is as Grass, and all the Glory of man is but as the Flower of the
Field; for the Appearance of your Beauty is admirable; for it stains the Beauty
of all Flesh, and marrs the Glory of all the Sons and Daughters of Men;
therefore arise and thresh the Mountains, even to Dust, and let the Hills be
laid low before you, and raise up the Valeys, that so a plain Way may be made
for the Lord and for his ransomed ones to pass over: Go on my dear Friends, go
on in the Dread and in the Authority of the Lord, cut down, and spare not,
neither let your Eye pity, that the Nations may know, that the Sword of the
Lord God is drawn forth and furbished to cut down, and to destroy that Nature
in all the Sons and Daughters of Men, which have rebelled against him, whereby
his pure Seed has been kept in Bondage: And you my dear Friends, who are yet
but passing out of Egypt, and you, who are got into the Wilderness, beware that
you look not back into Egypt, and that you hanker not after the Fleshpots
thereof, even the Glory of this vain World; but go on boldly, and with
Cheerfulness, and let your Eye be always, and at all times fixed on him, who
first brought you out of Egypt, even from out of your former gross Lives and
Conversation; and follow him in Truth and in Faithfulness, and he will bring
you through the desert Wilderness, even by a mighty hand, and by his Arm of
Strength, which he now has stretched forth unto you; which Arm he is making
bare, even in the Sight of the Nations, therefore go on and be valiant for
Truth, and lift up the weak Hands, and strengthen the feeble Knees; for now is
he making himself known, who will assemble her that halted, and gather her that
was scattered, and bring back again that which was driven away; even he that
binds up the brokenhearted is come and coming, who will satisfy the Thirsty
Soul, and speak comfortably unto all them that truly breath after the Eternal
Peace and Welfare of Zion, and the Redemption of the oppressed Seed, which has
long breathed after Liberty; therefore wait in the Patience in the Stilness and
in the Coolness of your Spirits, that you may come to feel that to arise daily
in you, which will dash down all Encumbrances, who rebukes the Winds, and
stills the raging Seas at his Command, who is the only begotten of the Father,
who begets all his Children into Love; for God is Love, and that which is begot
of him in all Hearts, is Love and Tenderness unto all men, but especially one
toward another: Therefore dear Friends beware of that Spirit, which would
arise in you to cause evil Surmisings one of another, or that would open an
evil Eye to look forth at one another Weakness, and of that Spirit that would
cause any secret Rejoicing thereat, though it be never so hidden; but beware,
and bring it to the Bar of Judgment, before it gets any Head or Strength in
you, that so it may be condemned before it go any further: And beware of that
Spirit that shall arise to cause a Deadness or a Barrenness in you, as to the
things of God, and would carry you back to feed upon that which you have
formerly enjoyed, and that would cause you to give way to a secret Envy, which
will be Ready to arise in you, against them who in honest Simplicity walk in
the true Obedience to the Measure of God made manifest in them, because, when
they feed in the Banqueting House of their Father, you may, perhaps, find
Barrenness and Emptiness for the present; I say, beware of that Spirit; for it
is he that causes the Barrenness, and the want; therefore wait in that which
discovers him, and makes him known; and come unto true Obedience thereunto, and
you shall see him, and all that would arise to oppose it self against the pure
seed of God in you, cast into utter darkness, from whence it arises; for the
Prince of Darkness with all his Legions, is not able to stand in the Presence
of God* and of his Christ, who is the Light of the World, and has enlightened
you with a measure of himself, which if you faithfully obey and follow, you
will feel a living Zeal to arise in your Hearts for the Lord, and for his
Truth, and likewise, an utter Enmity against all the Deeds of Darkness, both in
your selves, and likewise in all others; and you will feel that to arise in
you, which truly breaths after the Good and Welfare of all the Sons and
Daughters of men; and you will come to suffer with the Seed of God, which is
oppressed, both in your selves, and a^l the Sons and Daughters of Adam; and
blessed are all they that come to witness this in Truth and in Reallity, and
that are f^ithful to that little thing, that makes this known unto them; for
verily they shall be made Rulers over much: Therefore dear Friends, you that
are newly begotten into the eternal Truth of God for your Sakes is this
declared, by him, who has by the good Hand of God been carried through these
things, and has seen much of the Strength and Subtilty of the Enemy, who like
a roaring Lion goes about, seeking whom he may devour, therefore stand in the
Light, and in the Cross, even that which crosses the carnal Mind, and in that
there is Power against all his Assaults, and wait in Stilness at all times,
that so you may come to hear the Voice of the Lord, and to obey and follow it;
for Obedience is better then Sacrifice, and that is it, which the Lord requires
of you, and without that you shall not eat of the good of the land, even the
promised land of Rest and Peace, which the Lord is now bringing his People
into, where they shall feed in fat Pastures, even by the Springs of living
Water, under the Shadow of the Tree of Life, whose Fruit is pleasant to the
Taste, and whose Leaves are for the Healing of the Nations; in which Land is
Peace and Pleasantness, and Joy and Gladness of Heart, where the redeemed of
the Lord walk, and lie down in Rest and perfect Peace; where no vultrous Eye
can come, and where the Devourer cannot enter; where the Abominations, which
make desolate, cannot stand: The Gates of which land have long been the gates
of the Enemy; but now is the time appointed come, and the true spiritual Seed
of Abraham is risen in many, and does possess the Gates of their Enemies; and
many are they that are entered in through the Gates to this Land of Rest and
Redemption, Praises to the Lord God forever, and for evermore: And many are
they, that are yet entering, and to enter; therefore be courageous and faint
not; for the Promise is unto all, in whom tho Seed is in any measure made
manifest, which Seed shall possess the gates of his Enemies; and though the
Enemy has long stood in the Gate, and stopped the passage, and though it may
yet stop, in many, the passage through which the Seed should come forth out of
Bondage, and Oppression, yet mind not the Enemy, but mind him who has promised
and will perform, even that the Seed of Abraham shall possess the Gates of its
Enemies, which Seed is Christ in the Male, and in the Female. I say, mind not
that which brings in the Encumbrances, but mind that which lets you see them,
and stills and quiets all again: For Friends, the Battle which is to be fought
in every one of you, is hard, and the Enemy is strong and mighty, therefore
come forth, even forth of the Polutions, to the Help of the Lord against the
mighty; for Cursed is he, that comes not forth to the Help of the Lord against
the mighty; therefore stand forth with your loins girded about with Truth, and
put on the Breast plate of Faith and the Helmet of Salvation; for a mighty work
has the Lord God to do in the Earth, Instruments, in whose Hand, many of you
may be, if you are willing and obedient, and can with content take up the Cross
daily, which crosses the carnal, and despise the Shame, then shall you be
partakers of the Joy which is set before you, which Joy dashes all the Glory of
the World, and makes it appear as a thing of naught, for the Sake of which Joy
many dear hearts have despised the Shame and Contempt of the World, and have
willingly undergone many grievous Afflictions, and have undauntedly triumphed
over Death and Hell, even, to the Amazement of all their Enemies; therefore
blessed and happy are all you, that are called forth to suffer for the Name of
the Lord, and of his Truth, in which Truth is Freedom, and the Name of the Lord
is a strong Tower, to which you may fly in time of Distress, and you are safe
from the Enemy, and from all his Strength and Oppositions; and though he may
exercise his Tyranny upon your outward man, yet that is a thing of small value;
for that must to its Dust again, from whence it came, yet that it cannot touch,
without the Permision of him who is the Keeper of Israel, who never slumbers
nor sleeps: But you have a Life which is hid with God in Christ, which will
remain, when all mortal things shall turn to the Dust its Mother; which Life
cannot be touched nor injured by no invitred Heart nor cruel Hand; therefore
fear not man, nor the Sons of men; nay, I know you that are come into the true
Fear of the Lord, you cannot fear man; for Fearfulness that shall surprise the
Hypocrite, and Astonishment the double-hearted, when they that fear the Lord
shall be as bold as Lions: Therefore if Sufferings present unto thee my dear
Friend, whoever thou art that read, they will be as precious Jewels unto
thee, and thou will come to be as Gold, which is purified in the Fire; and as
thy Sufferings do abound upon thy outward Body, so likewise shall Peace, and
Tranquillity flow in upon thee, as Rivers of Living Water, whereby thy Soul will
come to be refreshed abundantly; yea, thou know, that Pen cannot express,
nor Tongue declare the Endless Joy and Felicity which at all times accompanies
those that are faithful. Words are too short ^o declare it, yet nevertheless
for the Sake of them that languish, and hunger after the living Bread,
wherewith all that are faithful are satisfied and fed abundantly; I say, for
the Sake of him that is hungry and not yet ^ully satisfied is this written,
that he may go on and not faint in his Travail; for blessed art thou that
hungers and thirsts after Righteousness; for ^f thou will wait and abide in the
Pa^ience, thou shall be satisfied; for in our Father's House is Bread enough,
where all his Children are fed at his Table, in the Banqueting House of Peace,
therefore wait and be still, and commune with thy Heart, and go not forth to
look that abroad, which cannot be found any where, but at home in thy own
Heart; and though at present thou may see a Day of Distress, and a Night of
Sorrow, wherein Judgment may come to be laid to the Line, and Righteousness to
the Plummet, yet stand still, and wait on the Lord and in the Way of his
Judgments, so shall thou witness Zion, even the Seed of God within thee, to
come to be redeemed through it, and Ba^ylon with all her Brats come to be
thrown down, and dashed in pieces by it; for now he that dasheth in Pieces is
come upon our Walls, and entered into our Borders, even the Lord, who is now
risen to enter into Judgment with all Flesh, and to purify and to cleanse the
Sons and Daughters of Men from all their Polutions, and to let them see the
Filth of the Fornication of Babylon's Whore, which has long reigned in the
Hearts of the Children of Men, and has caused all the Creation to groan under
her Oppression; now is the Lord risen to rent her Covering, and to lay open her
shame and Nakedness, that all that are not wilfully blind may see the Filth of
her Polutions, and come out from her, lest they be Partakers of her Plagues,
which shall suddenly come upon her, that so the Lord may cleanse them, and
purify them, and make them fit Temples for himself to dwell in; for that is
the Work which the Lord is going to perform, and his mighty Arm shall bring it
to pass; for he will work, and who shall hinder it? and he will dash all the
Pot-sherds to pieces that oppose themselves against him; for, who art thou that
set Briars and Thorns in Battle against me? says the Lord; Shall not I
pass through and burn them up? Yea verily, Friend, this have our Eyes seen, and
our Ears have heard, how the Lord has torn the Powers of the Earth in pieces,
and has brought all their Contrivances to naught, who have sought after their
own Glory, and not the Glory of Him* who have sat at rest and ease, and have
not partaken of the Day of Jacob's Trouble, but have sought their own Interest,
and not the Interest of the Lord, nor the Liberty of his People, but have
suffered the Innocent to lie under the Hands of grievous Oppressors, even the
greedy Hirelings and the dumb Idol Shepherds, who have long made and Prey upon
the Lord's Heritage, and have scattered the Lord's Flock in the dark and cloudy
Day, and caused them to wander upon the Barren Mountains* who have long fed
themselves with the Fat, and clothed themselves with the Wool, and have sat at
Rest and Ease, and have cried peace whilst men could put into their Mouths;
but now, them that cannot feed them any longer, they even prepare War against
them, whereby they become a Prey unto them; so that the whole Land groans under
that Oppression more then any other, and the Righteous suffer, and no man
lays it to Heart; and for this Cause has the Lord rebuked strong Nations,
and he will still rebuke all them that shall set themselves against him and
against his People.

Therefore, dear Friends, wait still on the Lord, who is the Strength of Sion,
and the Redeemer of the Seed of Jacob, who has already for your sakes, even
for his Seed's sake, which he has raised in you, overthrown all that have
exalted themselves against him, and against his Anointed, even Kings, Princes,
Protectors and Parliaments: I say, the Lord has overthrown and dashed them in
pieces as Potters Vessels, because they relieved not the Oppressed, nor pleaded
the Cause of the Innocent, therefore has swift Destruction overtaken them as
an Armed Man, and there was none to deliver. And for your sakes, O ye Sons and
Daughters of Sion, has the Lord brought these things to pass, that the Nations
may know that his Dread and Presence is with you, and at all times is amongst
you; for by you will he make himself known unto this crooked and perverse
Generation; and they shall confess, that God of a truth is in you and amongst
you: And though his Appearance unto Proud Flesh is without Form or Comeliness,
yet you know him to be as a Lilly among Thorns, who is the Beloved of your
Souls, and the fairest among Ten Thousand, who is declaring his strange Acts
and his wonderful Works in you, that which has been hidden from Ages and
Generations past, he is now making known even in and through you, whom he has
ordained to sound forth his Mighty Day in the Ears of all Flesh, that so all
may awake out of the Dust, and come to Judgment; for now is he risen and
arising in all Hearts, who sits upon the Throne, from before whose Face both
the Heavens and the Earth shall flee away, and their place shall be no more
found: And this is he that has long been waited for by many a tender Heart and
longing Soul, but now is he come and coming, and behold his Reward is with him;
therefore blessed are they that patiently wait for the Day of his Appearance,
who will wipe away tears from all Faces, and Sorrow and Sighing shall be no
more; then shall all Tyranny and Oppression be destroyed, and then shall Peace
be established in the Earth, and Love and Unity among Men; even thus shall it be
when Sion's King shall come to Reign in Glory; for then the Beast and the False
Prophet, which have long ruled the Nations, and deceived those that have dwelt
in the Earth, and compelled people to worship and bow down to their
Abominations, and to receive the Mark of the Beast in their Right Hands or in
their Foreheads, even the Mark of Sin and Transgression, that Monstrous Beast,
whose Mark has long been upon the Nations, without which Mark no man has
bought or sold for these many Generations, and they that would not receive that
Mark came to be slain: But now, Praises be unto the Lord, he has brought forth
many who cannot worship Man's Proud Will, that Monstrous Beast, neither can
they receive his Mark any longer; for their Father's Name is written in their
Foreheads, and they are come forth of great Tribulation, and their Garments are
washed white in the Blood of the Lamb; and these follow the Lamb of God (who is
now come to take away the Sins of the World) whither soever he goes, even
Christ Jesus, who is the Light of the World, who has enlightened every one that
is come into the World with a measure of his true Light.

Therefore, dear Friends, you that are obedient to the Light, and own it to be
your Rule and Guide, you are they whom the Lord has chosen to place his Name
in, for whose sakes the Lord is now risen to plead with Egypt's King, and all
his Host; and though they now harden their Hearts as an Adamant, and bend their
Brows as Brass, and stiffen their Necks as an Iron Sinnew, yet will the Lord
God bring them low, even unto the Dust in this his great Day, wherein his
Jealousy is broken forth against all Flesh, because they have corrupted their
Ways, and have not turned at his Reproof; but have cast his Judgments behind
their Backs, and turned his Grace (that has appeared unto them) into
Wantonness, and trampled the Blood of the Covenant under their Feet; but as it
was in the days of old, so will it be now in this latter Generation, when
Iniquity was at the height, and Oppression did most abound in Egypt upon the
Hebrews, who was the Fleshly Seed of Abraham, then did the Lord arise (to plead
their Cause) who brought Judgments and Plagues upon the Land of Egypt, and
destroyed Pharaoh, Egypt's King, with all the Firstborn, and all his Mighty
Host; so likewise Sodom, when Iniquities were at the very height, and their
Sins did greatly abound, then did the Lord's Wrath suddenly break forth upon
them, as soon as Just Lot was put forth from amongst them, even in Flames of
Fire from Heaven, and devoured them; so likewise, dear Friends, you that sigh
and cry for the Abominations that are done in the midst of the Earth, let not
your Hearts faint; for behold, he that is clothed in Linen fine and white,
which is the Righteousness of him that sanctifies, and of them that are
sanctified; for he that sanctifies, and them that are sanctified, are all one;
He is gone forth to seal and to set a Mark on all your Foreheads, that sigh and
that cry at the Abominations which are committed by him that makes desolate,
that sits where he ought not, and after he has sealed you all even unto
Redemption, then shall them that have the charge over the Earth draw near,
every one with his Slaughter Weapon in his Hand, and shall follow after him
that has sealed you, and shall smite and shall not spare, neither shall their
Eye take pity, but they shall utterly slay Old and Young, both Maid and little
Children, and Women; but you, upon whom the Mark is, they shall not come near:
him that reads, let him understand; for the Lord is risen, and he will smite
the Earth with a great Slaughter, and all Flesh shall know that he is the Lord,
and that he rules over the Kingdoms of men, and he will utterly destroy that
Nature that has oppressed his pure Seed in you, and in all the Sons and
Daughters of Men, and his own Seed shall come forth to serve him in
Righteousness and true Holiness; and though the Whore, the Beast and the False
Prophet have long born rule over the Heritage of the Lord, yet now is the time
drawing near, when they shall be taken and bound, and cast into the Lake which
is prepared for them, even for that Nature which would not have the Lord nor
his Christ to reign over them; under that may all the Enemies of the Lord be
justly included; and that is it which rules in the rebellious Sons and
Daughters of Men, which carries them forth into Pride, Envy and
High-mindedness one toward another, and into Disobedience to the Lord and his
pure Commands; and this is it which the Lord is risen to destroy, and not the
Creatures; for Christ came not to destroy Men's Lives, but to save them;
therefore wherever thou read any thing of Destruction, it is not meant the
Destruction of the Creature, or of his Natural Life, but the Destruction of
that Life in the Creature which rebelleth against the Lord, which Life may
truly be called Death; for if that be followed by the Creature, it will be the
Death of the Immortal Soul; and this is him which the Lord is risen to destroy,
and not the Creatures; therefore says Christ Jesus, O Death, I will be thy
Death; O Grave, I will be thy Destruction. So Friends, this is the Enemy, that
you are to wait with Patience to see it destroyed in your own Particulars
first, and then aftewards that you may see it destroyed in others in the
general; and blessed and happy are all you who have witnessed the Dead raised,
which has long lain in the Grave, under the Chains of Death, and can now truly
witness your Part in the first Resurrection, and that you are truly risen with
Christ, the Seed; for, over you the second Death shall have no Power.

And you, Friends, that are as yet brought but in part to the Knowledge of
these things, be still and quiet in your Minds, and beware of feeding upon
Knowledge which is out of the Life; for Knowledge will puff up, but it is Grace
that edifies; therefore wait in the pure Patience, that you may feel the Life
to stir in you; for that is the True Bread that comes down from Heaven, which
Bread is the Soul's Food; for the Soul cannot be satisfied with Knowledge; for,
to Know the Truth and the Things of God, and not to live in them, therein
stands the Condemnation.

Therefore, dear Friends, to whose Hands this may come, wait that you may feel
the Life, which will bring forth the Travails of your Souls, and then Knowledge
will be increased, and Truth will abound, and Eternal Peace and Happiness will
attend you wheresoever you go, and the Dread and Authority of the Lord will be
with you at all Times and Seasons, and as it has been a Dread and a Terror to
that Nature in you which rebelled against the Lord whilst you were in the
Polutions, so likewise if you are faithful the Lord will make you a Dread and a
Terror to all Evildoers wheresoever you come, and they will be afraid of your
Faces and afraid to trasngress against the Lord in your hearing; and these
things I know that many Thousands can witness to be Truth, and all that are
faithful shall witness the same, and see it accomplished in the Lord's due
time; unto whom be Eternal Praises and Dominion given by all that fear him, for
that he has brought this his wonderful Work to pass, and has revealed his
Secrets even to Babes, and to such as fear his Name.

Given forth by one which has long mourned in Sion, and is a Sufferer with the
Seed, who waits for the Redemption of all Creatures from under the Band of
Corruption, that they may all be brought unto the Glorious Liberty of the Sons
of God, known to many by the Name of Richard Moore.

THE END.
