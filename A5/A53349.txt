ON THE CORONATION
I.
NO, it is in vain. What Limits can control
The Rovings of my active Soul?
That Soul that scorns to be to Place confined,
But leaves its dull Companion Earth behind;
Whilst Fancy with unbounded flight,
Enjoys that Object of Delight,
Which envious distance would conceal from Sight:
And coth by thought supply
The weaker Prospect of the Eye,
Giving Poets to partake
(Like those Deities they make)
Of Infinite Ubiquity.
II.
Thus methinks I see the Barge,
Pleased with the Sacred weight of its Majestic charge;
Argos a less Glorious Freight,
From impov'rish'd Colchos brought
The Cretan Sea now vanquished, must confess
Its Burden meaner, and its Triumph less;
Since richer Thames does James and Mary bear,
HE great as Jove, SHE as Europa Fair.
They come! Joy doubles Strength to every Oar,
Echoes fill the wondering Shore,
The Waves with an unusual Pride,
Pay Homage to the Lord
Of our asserted Main,
And calmly as they Glide,
Auspiciously afford
An Omen of His Reign.
III.
See, Glorious as the Eastern Sun,
Our Monarch from the Waters rise,
Whilst Zealous Crowds, like Persians run
To own the Blessing by their Sacrifice.
He comes, Religious Shouts proclaim Him near,
JAMES and HOSANNA bless the Ear;
Delighted Heaven confirms the Joys,
And in glad sounds reflects the Image of the Voice.
IV.
Tryumphant CAESAR in less Triumph rode,
Though from a Victor to be made a God,
When Captive Monarchs trembled by His side,
And by their shame increased His Pride;
No private Sorrows here allay
The common transports of the day,
But in each exalted Breast
(Of Happiness and JAMES possessed)
Is Evidently shown,
His People's Blessing's greater than His Own,
And he that gives the Triumph, Tryumphs least.
V.
With weaker Shouts did Israel Ring,
Less esteemed the Heavenly Choice,
Less approved the Prophets Voice
That Crowned their wishes in a King.
For wandering Asses did bestow
On Saul that Title to a Throne,
Which Providence to JAMES does owe
For His Forefathers Virtues, and His own.
VI.
Next, Fancy, to the Altar bring,
Second to him we there Adore; the King
By the Anointing Prelate met,
And Rising, where the mighty Brother Set.
But (Oh,) forbid the Omen Heaven,
And Guard the Blessing you have given,
Late He Possessed, long may he fill the Throne,
And for the Nations Bliss, defer his own.
FINIS.
