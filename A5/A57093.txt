TO HER GRACE the DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH.
MADAM,
THE following Play seems naturally to claim the Patronage of a Lady, for which
Reason no true Englishman will wonder that the first Person who occurred to my
Thoughts on this occasion should be the Duchess of Marlborough.

Not all the Security we enjoy by our safe and honorable Peace, can make us
unmindful of the Gratitude we owe to your Name. All the Blessings which have
been procured for us by our late Treaties, are not greater, than what might
have been expected from the long Course of the Duke of Marlborough's Victories.

If we are at leisure to cultivate the Politer Arts, if our Trade flourishes,
if our Credit rises both at Home and Abroad, if we have obtained a general
Peace for our Allies, if the Catalans are obliged to us for our Protection, the
Germans ^or our Faith, and the French for our Generosity; who could have
promised to themselves less Honors and Advantages for their Country, from the
many Glorious Campaigns and uninterrupted Successes of our late Great General.

It has been often observed, that when the French have been worsted in the
Field they have saved themselves by Treaties; but such are the consummate
Abilities o^ our present Ministers, that the World is as much astonished at
their Negotiations, ^s it was before at the Duke of Marlborough's Conquests.

There are indeed too many among us, who are apt to be affrighted at every
thing that seems to threaten our Religion and Liberties; but why should private
Men believe themselves in any Danger from the Pretender, when the Government is
not apprehensive of it? But this is certain, we have less Reason to be so^
while He is still living who has so often defeated the Ambition of France, and
broken its best concerted Measures.

Among the many eminent Virtues which I might here take occasion of celebrating
in your Grace, I shall only single out that which I believe your Grace will be
most delighted to hear mentioned, I mean that truly conjugal Fri^ndship and
Affection with which you accompany this Great Man in His Absence from His
native Country, and share with him in all the Cares and Inquietudes his
Extraordinary Merit has brought upon him.

That You may have many Years in reserve for your own mutual Happiness^ as well
as for your Country's Good, i^ the hearty Desire of every honest Man^ and
particularly of, Madam,

Your GRACE's Most Obedient and Most Humble Servant,

THE following TRAGEDY was Originally Written in French by the celebrated
Monsieur RACINE, whose Masterpiece it is justly accounted; and having been
translated into English, with considerable Additions, by Mr. BOYER, and passed
the Correction and Approbation of the late famous Mr. DRYDEN, and several other
Persons distinguished as well by their Wit and Learning, as by their Taste and
Discernment, was acted with general Applause, toward the End of the Year 1699,
and Beginning of 1700. The Reasons why this Excellent PLAY stopped, on a sudden,
in a full Career, are, in some Measure, accounted for in Mr. BOYER'S Preface:
To which he might have added, That the Duchess of MARLBOROUGH, who at that
Time bore an irresistible Sway, bespoke the Comedy then in Vogue, during the
Run of Iphigenia in Aulis; And that this Tragedy received no small Prejudice,
from the Person that acted Eriphile, who sunk under the Weight of so great a
Part.

This TRAGEDY having lain dormant for many Years, was lately revived, in the
most IRREGULAR MANNER, that was ever known or practiced either on PARNASSUS, by
Poets; or on the STAGE, by ACTORS. The Town has already done Mr. BOYER some
Justice, by Discovering the Imposition, and by Finding out, that the VICTIM was
no other than ACHILLES and IPHIGENIA in AULIS. The Publishing a SECOND EDITION
of this Play, (which was out of Print) is sufficient to justify the Judgment of
the Public, and vindicate Mr. Boyer's Right. But the manner in which his
Performance, and Himself, have been abused is so flagrant and injurious, that
he designs, in few Days, to publish a short DISSERTATION, on the PRESENT
MANAGEMENT of the STAGE, Addressed to My Lord CHAMBERLAIN, wherein he shall set
in a true Light, the PERNICIOUS CONSEQUENCES of such Vnfair Practices both of
some Writers and Players; and in particular, inquire into the Reason, Why Mr.
Wilks declined to revive, this very Tragedy, for the Entertainment of the Duke
D' AUMONT, who, by his Secretary Monsieur l' AB^E NADAL, had Intimated to Mr.
Boyer, his Desire to see it represented; which Mr. Boyer signified to Mr. Wilks?

TO THE PLAGIARY OF Mr. BOYER's IPHIGENIA.
VAin is Racine's and Boyer's Laboring Wit!
The one Improving what the other Writ:
Both fall a Sacrifice to thy Third-Day
And Lovely Iphigenia is thy Prey.
Nor knows the Nymph if she should more detest
Calchas or Thee; the Pirate or the Priest?
Her ancient Tears and Griefs, from him proceed
Who brought Her to Diana's Shrine to bleed:
But that She Mourns unpitied in her Woes,
The Wretched Virgin to thy Dullness owes.
Her Life alone was Wicked Calchas's Aim:
Thou touchest a yet tenderer Part, her Fame.
Thy Theft has all her Grace and Luster soiled;
Thou Stolest the Beauty first, and after spoiled.
So fares it with that desperate Band, who live
On Prey and Rapine, and by Injury thrive.
Those whom they Wrong, with Hatred they pursue,
And not content to Rob, they Murder too.

THE DEDICATION TO The Beautiful and Ingenious DIANA.
Madam,
DEdications are grown so Modish, that a Play makes as ill a Figure without
one, as a Beau in the Side-Box without a long Wig.

Yet I must freely own, that the greatest Trouble this Tragedy gave me, was the
fixing it on a proper Person to Patronize it. Those whose Merit entitles them
to these solemn Addresses, are generally unwilling to have their Names exposed;
and such who are most fond of seeing their Pedigrees, and Encomiums pre^ix'd to
a Play, do commonly fasten upon the Poet the scandalous Character of a vile
Flatterer.

One of my Friends advised me to o^^er this Piece to a great Lord; but not
being Secretary to his Mistress, I was a^raid of meeting with a cold Reception.
Another would persuade me to Dedicate to a Courtier; but I am either too Modest
or too Proud to appear with a cringing Assurance at a Levee; and too great a
Lover of Truth to commend a Fop in Favor. Another would have me Address to a
Beau-Knight; but he being lately broke at Basset, and his Taylor's and
Perwig-maker's Bills coming thick upon him, I was unwilling to put in for one
amongst his needy Visitants. Lastly, a ^ourth would have engaged me to make my
Achilles and Iphigenia court the shelter of some Rich Citizen; but my Muse was
too aspiring to pro^^itute herself to a Plebeian

Thus having reviewed all Patrons of all Ranks, and m^turely considered the
several pitiful Means by which some Poets intrude into their Protection, I wa^
induced, for many Reasons, to lay this Tragedy on fair Diana' Shrine.

First of all, as ancient Poets tell us, the Greek Iphigenia owing its
Preservation to Diana in Aulis, I hope the Person who is willing to borrow the
Name of that Goddess, will likewise receive the English Iphigenia under her
Patronage.

Besides, by thus prefixing your feigned Name to this Play, I spare my self the
trouble of a begging Visit, and you the Sight of a Dunning Dedicator.

But, Madam, the most prevalent Motive with me is, That I may commend you
without being suspected of Adulation, or making your Modesty uneasy. I may
freely proclaim to the World, that you make Conquests by your Beauty, and
secure them by your Wit; that your Sense ^quals your Wit, and that your good
Humor is inferior to neither. I may boldly say, that you are free with
innocence; Modest without A^fectation; and Virtuous without Pride. That at once
you command Love and Respect; and that nothing surpasses the Charms of your
Conversation, but your admirable way of Writing.

Nay, I might take a greater Latitude with you than any Poet ever did with his
Patron, for I might tell you of your Faults, and reproach your cruel
Indifference, not to say, Ingratitude. I might con^irm my constant Love to you,
and expostulate your broken Promises of eternal Friendship. I might remind you
of your Letters, without putting you ^o the Blush, or incurring my self the
charge of Indiscretion, since nothing can be more secret than what I now speak
in Public.

All these Advantages I find in Dedicating to my charm^^g Diana; and if she
proves so kind as to bless me once more with her endearing Company, I will
esteem this Ep^^tle better rewarded than any I writ before. I remain with all
the Sincerity of a Lover and a Poet.

Charming DIANA, Your most devoted humble Servant. A. BOYER
From behind the (...) Drury Lane, (...).
THE PREFACE.
POets, like most Lovers, are apt to boast the Favors, or complain of the
^^gour of their Mistress, the Town: For my part, I am too discreet a Lover to
boa^^, and too young a Poet to complain; and though the First r^n of thi^ Play
was but short, yet I must own my self obliged to the Civility of the English
Nation; for on this Occasion, a^ on many others, I found that the Imputation of
^eing inh^spitable and rude to Strangers, which Horace charges on the Britons,
reaches no higher than the Mob.

Some of my Friends wondered that a Play which was ac^ed with so much Applause,
should stop so soon in its career. The Reason of it is obvious: This Tragedy
came out upon the N^ck of another of the same Name, which being the p^oduct of
a Giant-Wit, and a Giant-Critick, like Horace's Mountain in Labor, had
miserably balk'd the World's Expectation; and most People having been tired at
Lincolns-Inn-Fields, did not ^are to venture their Patience at Drury Lane, upon
a false Supposition that the two Iphigenia's were much alike: Whereas they
differ no less than a young, airy Vi^gin, from a stale, antiquated Maid.

Anoth^r difficulty this Play labored under, was its being acted at a time
when the whole Town was so much, and so justly diverted by the Trip to the
Jubilee. A merry Entertainment is certainly very impro^er to prepare the Tas^es
of an A^dience to relish a grave and solemn Tragedy; ^or we are naturally angry
with those who would make us W^ep, when we are in a sit of Laughing. Yet
notwithstanding all th^se Inconveniences, my Iph^g^nia has pleased the fairest
Part of the Town, I mean the L^di^s, and having gained this Point, (...) my
Wishes.

N^w when I call this Play mine, let me not be thought so (...) a^ to a^^^me
the Honor o^ ^he Comp^si^ion wholl^ to my se^f. The Subject o^ it is taken
from a Greek (...) of ^uripides: This Monsieur Racin^ brought upon (...) the
Addition of the ^^isode of Eriphile, Ac^illes^ (...), which (...) his P^ot more
full (...).

(...) Racine managed his Subject with a great d^al (...) ^a^tery: H^s
Expressions are (...) and lofty; his Sen^^^^^ts noble and ^irtrous; his
Passions moving and na^^ral^ (...) well managed and surprising; the whole Piece
r^g^l^r. The success answered (...) extraordinary Perform^nce; ^phigenia at her
first Appearance on the French (...), and commanded Admiration both from the
Co^^t and the C^ty, for many Months successively; and set Monsi^^^ ^^a^^in^
above the Level of all French Tragic Writ^^^.

The great ^^ccess of Racine's Iphigenia, and the Enco^^^g^me^t I rec^iv'd from
some Persons of a just Discernme^t, made me venture to make her appear upon an
Eng^^sh Thea^re; (...), whether she has gained or l^st any Thing (...) her ne^
(...), I leave to the Judicious to determin^^. (...) I can say in her Favor,
is, That her numbers are easy and sl^wing; and that she speaks English like a
genteel well-^re^ Lady, and not like an affected, pedantick Would-be-Wi^. But
in this I must own my self obliged to my hono^r'd and ^^genious ^rie^d Mr.
Cheek, to whom I owe some of (...) smoo^hest Line^. I wish he had a greater
share in the whol^ Play, ^or then I am sure the Town would have liked ^t a
great deal better.

THE PROLOGUE.
Written by Tho. Cheek, Esquire Spoken by Mr. Powell.
APollo the other Day in Council sat,
Where after many a ^^^ned and wise Debate,
(...) so ^ast increase,
To (...) and keep the Peace,
I^ was (...) -- As w^ll the Cause it sits,
To Reinforce his Regiment of Wits,
Among the rest, the Author of this Play
Here takes his Post, and enters into Pay.
He hopes to keep it too with Reputation,
And stem the Tide of Folly in the Nation.
That Is a hard Task --, and I Am afraid it tends
To make him lose abundance of his Friends:
Yet though he has obtained a Privilege,
He would be very loath to Disoblige.
The Race of ^ops his Satyr ne^re will drive at,
If modestly they will play the Fool in private.
But if they still appear in public Places,
With fashionable Nonsense and Grimaces,
He must not let 'em escape without Derision,
That were a Crime would forfeit his Commission.
Yet in this Play no Satyr will appear.
All that deserve it are in safety here.
From great Euripides he drew this Piece,
Euripides the boast of ancient Greece.
And wondrous Beauties of each coming (...),
With Pride he owns he borrowed from Racine.
Then, since these Poets had such great Success.
Why may not ours please you in an English d^^^^^
Yet though like them the labored Scene he draws,
With just regard to the Dramatick Laws,
He Would not be thought of that vainglorious Tribe,
Who their own Rules imperiously prescribe.
He better knows what to your Taste is due,
And writes well, only when he pleases you
His Muse in Nature's Majesty appears,
She has no Sounds Tremendous to the Ears;
And if once more he should attempt to w^^^e.
His Pen shall Draw, your Palate shall In^^^.
THE EPILOGUE.
Written by Mr. Motteux. Spoken by Mr. Norris.
THE Deuce take Poet, Epilogue, and Play^
The Devil a Word know I what I Have to say,
Who Will mind his Cant? An Audience, like a Lover,
Longs to be gone soon as the Play is over,
As ^or Example --.
Y^nd' mobb'd-up, civil, modest Velvet Fa^es
Long to be Coach'd to more diverting Places.
Not one would stay, though they but now sneaked in;
When our Play ends, theirs always does begin.
Kind Cull, and Miss steal out from th'Epilogue,
And merrier Scenes are acted at the Dog.
You rakish Sparks in quest of Game run out,
And give or take the Covent Garden Gout.
Your Student who but came to see the Play,
With some Pit-Muse his Talent would essay.
Some at Basset long to encr^ase their Guineas,
And leave 'em there, and then sneak home like Ninnies.
You Topers long to drink in ample Glasses
Confusion to dull Poets and pale Faces.
But above all yond^ City Fry would go,
Who came by Thr^e to sit on that First Row.
Poor Things!
They thought e're this that they might home have scutled,
Their Time's all spent, and all their Apples guttled.
The Poet (if he is not quite Dead for Fear)
Would go to Wills ^ncog. t'observe his Critics there.
Scarce one would s^ay but that obliging Fry,
Who about this ^ime in our dark Passage ply,
Stale Wenches, Sharpers, Catterwawling Sparks,
Old dirty Beaux^ and young Attorneys Clerks.
Since then your Business lies another way,
I hope you have not Time to damn the Play;
But if you must, do it on the Poets Day.
ACHILLES: OR, IPHIGENIA in AVLIS. A TRAGEDY.
ACT 1. SCENE 1.
A Camp near the Sea Shore. A Fleet at a distance. The Curtain rises and
disco^ers Agamemnon with a Letter in his Hand. Agam. ARCAS, what hoa! Arcas,
awake!
^e hears me not: Sweet Sleep sea^s fast his Eyes.
He is no King, he is no wretched Father,
Who ^atally has promised his own Child,
To be a bloody ^ictim to Ambition.
Oh! Agamemnon^ Thou have banished Rest
For ever, ever banished Peace of Mind,
To grasp the shadow o^ a mighty Name.
Arcas! I say, what hoa! Arcas.

Enter Arcas. Arc. Great Sir, I come -- ^ But what concern
Has roused you from your Bed before the Morn?
There Is scarce a glimmering Light to guide our St^ps;
All Eyes but you^s and mine are clo^'d in Aulis
What! Has some welcome noise distu^b'd the Air?
And are the Wind^ propitious to our Wi^hes?
But, no -- All sleeps: The Camp, the Winds, and Nep^une.

Agam. Oh Ha^py! Who content^d with his State,
^ree from the G^^d^ Th^aldom of a C^own^
S^curely li^es in an obs^^^^ Ret^^at

(...)
If you would obtain the Winds the Heavens deny,
Sac^ifice Iphigenia --

Arc. Your Daugh^er!

Agam. Amazed and Speechles^ for a while I stood:
My t^embling Spi^its c^ill'd within my Veins:
^^t when m^ ^roken Voice bu^st out a Passage,
I c^^st the Gods and ^ow'd to disobey.
My ^^^st resolve was ^o dismiss the Army,
W^i^^ (...) U^^ss^s seemi^gly approved,
To let my raging Pa^^ion take it^ course.
B^^ soon em^loying his persuading Arts,
He (...) ^^^ore m^ a^l the ties ^f Honor;
Thos^ Troops and Princ^^ under my Command,
T^^ ^a^tern Empire ^a^ed (...) ^e ours,
A^l (...) ^^uld raise Ambition to a height.
(...) Ti^le of the King o^ Kings,
(...) the haughty weakness of my Soul.
Besides, the Gods a^soon as gloomy Night,
Began to lull my Cares in gentle Sl^mbers,
With angry Dreams reproached my impious Pity,
And th^eatn'd vengeance to my troubled Mind;
With Tears I yielded and pronounced the Doom
Of my unhappy Daughte^ --.
But now, what barbarous cunning did I use,
To d^aw her ^^om her Mothers tender A^mes
I sent her Orders to repair to Aulis:
Pretending that Achilles pressed to go,
Would wed my Daughter, e're we put to Sea.

Arc. But fear you not Achilles's boiling Rage?
Think you that unc^n^ern'd he will calmly see,
His Name abused to Sac^ifice his Love?

Agam. Achilles then had left the Camp: To meet
His Father P^leu^'s insulting Foes;
And all expected this new kindled War,
Would ^or a while employ hi^ early Courage.
But what can stop this Heroes rapid course?
Achilles ^ights and Triumphs a^ he r^ns,
And vving with the swi^test Wings o^ ^ame,
Returned last Night to join our wond^ing Arm^.

Arc And has he learned wh^t Fate a^^ends hi^ B^^de.

Agem. He has not --.
Bu^ ^^ill a st^onger motive holds my Arm:
(...) Daughter who with eager jo^ app^o^^^^^,
^o meet a longing Lover and a Father,
(The kindest Father as She may suppose)
My Da^g^ter meets inevitable Death.
My Daughter^ at that sacred Name I shake;
Yet, ^tis not Blood alone endears her to me,
Her Love, her Piety, her gentle Nature,
A thousand blooming Virtues I regret.
N^^ no, I Will ^e're perform the Sacrifice,
(...) is too just to own so black a Dee^,
(...) Pious I must disobey.

(...) (...) how can you recall your sol^mn Promise?

(...) (...), you over-rate a tri^ling Conquest:
(...) Go^s open a nobler Field,
(...) great Prize you have proposed,
To animate my Courage. But, My Lord,
Must I believe the joyful News I hear?
That to anticipate my di^tant Bliss,
Fair Iphigenia comes to the Camp,
To Crown my Wishes?

Agam. My Daughter!
Who told you she is to come?

Achil. You seem surpised, my Lord, at this Report?

Agam. Heaven! How I fear my secret is revealed To Ulysses.
And ^ll my cunning lost!

Ul^^. My Lord the King's surprise To Achill^.
I^ but ^o (...): Good Gods! Is this a time
To think on Nuptial Joy^, when angry Heaven
Strikes terro^ through the Camp? Whilst a dead Sea
Af^^ights all Greece, and wastes our ling^ing Army;
Whilst to appease the unrelenting Gods,
A Victim, a dear Victim must be Sacrificed,
Achilles minds his Love^ as if he meant
T'insuit the public Woes; must Agamemnon
Exasperate our Fate with Festivals?
Is this, my Lord, the tender Love you show,
To your af^licted Country?

Achil In Phr^g^^ Fields our Actions soon will prove
Whe^h^r U^^ss^s (...) I love her most.
I^ the mean ^ime, you may display your Zeal;
Yo^ may s^^^^ly ^ire the Gods with Prayers,
And load their Altars with tame Of^erings;
You may consult ^he pa^ting Victims Breast,
And s^arch the cause o^ the Winds tedious Silence,
But a^ ^o^ me, who leave that care to Calch^s,
I hope, my Lord, I may pursue a Marriage,
Which no con^erns the Gods nor you --.
Yet, think not I Will dissolve in womanish Pleasures,
No, if I love, it is like the God of War,
Only to fill the vacancies of Action;
And my courageous Soul could never brook,
That any one should touch the Phrygian Shore
Before Achilles --.

Agam. Oh! Heaven! Why must thy secret Envy stop
The way to Asia, to such noble Heroes?
Must I be wi^ness o^ so bright a Valor,
Only to withdraw home, with Grief and Shame?

Ulys. Ye Gods! What do I hear?

Achil. My Lord, What Is that you uttered?

Agam. Princes, we must retire: Too long the Winds
Have tired our credulous Hopes with Expectation^
(...)

Achil. You pry too far into the Gods Decree^^
Besid^^, ^hink you, my Lord, those ^rivolous Th^eats,
Will '^r^ de^er Achilles ^^om pu^suing,
honor and Glory under your Command?
What i^ the ^a^^l Sisters did ^or^ell.
When ^^st my Mother yielded to th'^mb^ace
O^ mo^t^l Pel^^, that ^ might choose,

Then let us not re^^^d what they Decre^,
^^t ^ather s^^ive to ^qual t^eir Con^ition
By our immo^tal D^^ds. Now since at Troy
^oth ^ame and Victo^y attend^ I fly,
And on^y ask the Winds to want me over.
^et all th'a^f^ighted Greeks retire with Sha^^,
(...)
Does animate the Camp: When Greece proclaims
Your Zeal and Wisdom: Nay, when twenty Kings
Will Sacri^ice their Lives in your Defen^e,
You, Sir, alone refuse the glorious purchase
Of Honor and Revenge; a little Blood
You think too dear to gain immortal Fame.
Must It be said, the General of Greece
Employed his skill in nothing but Commanding
A sa^e Retreat?

Agam. Alas! my Lord, how easily, whilst secure
From my impending Woes, you seem undaunted!
But was your Son Telemachus the Victim,
^ow soon the ghastly image of his Death,
Would turn to Tears your proud insulting Speech?
How deep you would feel the Torments I endure
From struggling Nature! And how swi^t you would ^ly
To snatch him from the Priest! Yet since my promises past.
If my unhappy Daughter meets us here,
I Will not recall it, but if kinder Fate
Prevents her coming, you will not think it strange,
If I accept the welcome Help of Heaven^
Too long your Counsels have prevailed upon me^
I blush to think o^'^ --

Enter Eurybates. Euryb. My Lord -- ^

Agam. Gods! The News?

Euryb. The Queen ^id me ^aste
To tell you her Approach: And that she brings
^er Daughter, to resign her to your Arms.
She had arrived before, but that she lost
^er way, through those thick Woods that sh^owd the Camp

Agam. Oh! Heaven!

Euryb. They are attended
By young Eriphile, Achilles's Lesbian Captive,
Who being unacquainted with the Parents,
D^signs to learn her Fate from Renowned Chalebas.
The News of their ar^ival is now s^^e^d
Through all the Camp, and with loud Acclamations,
The joyful Soldiers crowd about the Queen,
And your ^air Daughter; some enquire the Cause
That brings them hither: Others are contented,
To pray the Gods for their P^osperity.
But with a common Voice, all b^^s^ their General,
A^ the most glo^ious King, and happy Father.

Agam. It Is well --, you may retire --, I Will make them welcome.
Exit. Eurybates. Thus to secure its Vengeance, angry Heaven
Breaks all the Measures of my Policy!
Yet i^ I was allowed the Privilege
Of soothing Tears, it were some Comfort! But
The ba^barous Fate of Kings sets us on high,
To lie expo^'d to all the Bolts of Fortune,
And be a gazing-stock to those below.
Thus still b^set by troublesome Spectators,
Though most unhappy, we must least complain.

Ulys. My Lord, I am a Father, nay, a tender Father,
Who feelingly resents your cruel Woe:
I shudder at the stroke that makes you sigh,
And even would weep to countenance your Tears^
But your denial can have no Excuse,
The Gods have brought their Victim to the Camp,
Calchas expects it, and will soon demand it.
Yet, whilst we are alone, let flowing Tears
Express your Sorrow: Your concern allows them.
But, no --, let rather your undaunted Soul
Consider the vast Glory you shall reap.
Behold the Hellespont yields to our Oars;
Behold our Flames devour persidious Troy;
Her Subjects made your Slaves; King Priamus
Grasping your Knees, and Helena resto^'d.
Behold our numerous Fleet returns to Aulis
Crowned with success: Behold that pompous Triumph,
That will be the sam'd Tale of After-ages.

Agam. My Lord, I find how weak and impotent,
All my Efforts would be to oppose the Gods.
And since it is decreed, that Innocence
Must be oppressed, I --, no --, ^ I Will never yield:
Oh! Cruel Fate! Inexorable Gods!

Ulys. My Lord, remember
Your solemn Vows, and dread the Almighty Powers.
Consult your Safety --; Nay, consult your Honour^

Agam. Oh! Hard Necessity!
Oh! Wretch^d Father! Yet engage the Priest
To Silence for a while: Let me, at least,
Be Guiltless for one Moment: Let me hide,
From Clytemnestra, my black, barbarous Arts;
And spare her tender Heart the cruel Sight,
Of a dear Daughter bleeding on an Altar.

Exit. Agamemnon. Ul^s. I'^e done my Task: Nature and Love give way,
The Gods and Honor bear the Sovereign Sway.

The end of the First Act.
ACT II.
^nter Eriphile, weeping, D^ris. Eriph. DOris, Let us retire: And whilst within
They ^eel the Raptures of their mutual Love,
Both in a Father, and a Husband's Arms,
Here let me vent my unrelenting Grief.

Dor. Why, Madam, will you thus provoke your Sorrows?
And waste those Beauties with incessant Tears?
It Is true, nothing seems Charming to a Prisoner,
Captivity turns all to Bitterness;
Yet, shall I tell it? When we c^ost the Seas
With proud Achilles, when yet a trembling Captive,
You viewed your Conque^our, me thought your Eyes
We^e less employed about your Miseries.
Now Fortune seems to smile, since Iphigenia
Like a fond Sister sooths your Cares with Friendship,
And gives those Comforts you had found in Troy.
You longed to come to Aulis, and your Wishes
A^e all accomplished, yet your Grief redoubles.

Eriph. What! Do thou think that sad Eriphile,
Can be a calm Spectator of their Joys?
Can thou believe my Griefs will disappear,
When I behold a Heaven I cannot reach?
Blessed Iphigenia hugs the dearest Father,
She is the Pride of a fond haughty Mother,
Whist from my Infancy exposed to Dangers,
My unknown Parents never Smiled on me.
I am a Stranger to my very sel^;
And to complete my Woes, the Oracle
Bid me continue in my Ignorance;
For when I ask to whom I owe my Birth,
It Is answered, in this Knowledge lies my Loss.

Dor. But why should this de^er you from your Search?
All Oracles lie hid in dubious Riddles,
Who knows but by the losing a false Name
You Will find your own: This, sure, must be the Loss
The Oracle foretells, for in your Cradle,
Your Name was changed --

Eriph. Of all the Circumstances of my Fate,
This is the only one I ever could learn,
From thy unhappy Father, who knew all.
Indeed he used to tell me, that in Troy,
I should retrieve my Glory, my true Name,
And find my Royal Parentage -- But oh!
I had within my view the wish'd^^or^ City,
When fierce Achilles led his Conquering Host,
Against Lesbos, and made all yield to his Sword;
Thy Father buried in a heap of Dead,
Left me a Captive to my self unknown:
And of all those great ^onours I expected,
Vile Prisoner of Greece, I only keep
The Pride of a High Birth I cannot prove.

Dor. How great's the Loss of such a Faithful Witness!
How much you ought to hate the Barbarous Hand
That gave the fatal Blow! Yet renowned Calchas,
Who holds a Correspondence with the Gods,
And know's what is past, what is present, what is to come,
Calchas may, sure, acquaint you with your Fate.
Besides, this Camp affords you safe Protection:
Kind Iphigenia will soon be joined,
In happy Marriage to our Conqueror,
And make our Chains the lighter; doubt it not,
She has engaged her Promise --

Eriph. What! If of all my Woes^
This fatal Marriage were the cruellest?

Dor. How! Madam?

Eriph. Be not surpised my Grie^s admit no Cure,
But rather wonder I have lived so long,
With such a load of Cares and Misery.
I am unknown, a Stranger, and a Captive:
All these were little -- But, oh! I Am a Lover.
That fierce Destroyer of the Lesbian State;
That fatal Author of our dir^ Misfortunes,
Who with Hands drenched in Blood made me his Captive,
And with thy Father robbed me of my Birth,
Achilles is the dearest Man I view.

Dor. Heaven! What do I hear?

Eriph. I first designed
Eternal Silence should conceal my Weakness:
But I must speak to ease my Soul oppressed,
And in thy friendly Bosom vent a Secret,
Which ought for ever, ever be forgotten.
Yet, Doris, ask me not with what fond Hopes,
I entertained this Passion in my Breast?
I will not charge it on that kind Concern,
With which Achilles seemed to sooth my Woes.
No, no; it is unrelenting Heaven's Dec^ee,
^till to pursue me with immortal Hatred.
And ^rush my tender Heart with Cares of Love.

Dor. Oh! cruel hopel^ss Love!

^rith. Shall I call back to my distracted Mind,
The sad Remembrance o^ that dismal Day,
When first we lost our Liberty?
^^^echless and Trembling for a while I lay,
Buried in gloomy Night; at last my feeble Eyes,
Began to seek the Light, and as I saw
The pressing Hand of my ^ierce Conqueror
R^^king with Blood, I ^ear'd to meet his Looks.
As I embark't with him, I still endeavored,
To shun the dreadful and detested Sight;
B^^, oh! I saw him; saw him with a Blush;
Nay, which is more, I saw him with concern.
His Aspect was Serene, and my Reproaches
Could find no Tongue to Curse the pleasing ^oe;
My Heart rebelled against my Miseries,
And all my Anger melted into Tears.
I followed with Delight my Charming Guide,
And as I loved him then, I love him still.
Kind Iphigenia offers me Protection,
But all in vain, since my tormenting Furies
Bid me lay hold of my Protectress's Hand,
Only to crush a Rival, and unseen
Disturb those Joys which cause my Sufferings.

Dor. Alas! What can your feeble Hate pe^form
Had it not been much better to have remained
S^ill Prisoner at Mycene; there to quench
Your fatal Fires, and shun the cruel Woes
Of unregarded Love --

Eriph. 'Twas my Design; but though my Rivals Triumph
Threatened my newborn Love with endless Torments,
Yet driven by Fate I came: A secret Voice,
Bid me attend my Guardian --
Presaging that I might leave on this Shore,
All my Mis^ortunes, and like a Lib^tion,
Pour them upon the ^eads of these bl^st Lovers.
This is the Reason I appear in Aulis,
And not a fond Desire to know my Bi^th.
Or rather I am come to let their Nupti^ls
Pronounce my final Doom; for if accomplished,
A speedy Death will end my Miseries;
And without wasting time in fruitless Search,
After my unknown Parentage, the Grave
Will hide my Love and Shame --

Dor. How much I do lament your cruel Fate^

Enter to them Agamemnon, Iphigenia. Iphig. My Lord, What makes you thus Fly
^^om my Sight;
And ^hun the Clasping of a Daughter's Arms?
My duti^ul Respect made me fo^bear,
Till the transported Queen had first expressed
Her joys in your Emb^ace, Must Iphigenia,
Retire without a Blessing, and a Kiss?
May Not I? --

Agam. Yes -- you may embrace a Father, Embraces her.
Who loves you still --

Iphig. How dear I value such a Father's Love^
What pleasing Raptures do I feel, to see
Th'Excess of Power and Honor that surrounds you?
Fame's busy Tongue had entertained my Ears,
With wondrous Tales of your supreme Command;
But all comes short of what I now behold;
My Joys and my Surprise at once redouble:
You have the general Love of all the Grecians,
And am I then beloved by such a Father?

Agam. Alas! A Father to so good a Daughter,
Deserved to be more Fo^tunate --

Iphig. Is there a greater Fortune can attend a King?
I thought you reached the Top of humane Bliss,
And that the Bounteous Gods could give no more.

Agam. Just Heaven! Must I prepare her to her Fate? Aside.

Iphig. You Sigh my Lord, and seem to cast your Looks,
Unwillingly upon me; Pray, dear Sir,
Is it against your Orders we are come?

Agam. Daughter, I see you with a Father's Eye;
But at this Time and Place, perplexing Care
Disturb my Joys --

Iph^g. How sad are the effects of tedious Absence!
Alas^ cannot you forget your high Degree,
And le^^n to be a Father for a moment?
Here is no Witness that can make you Blush;
You s^e before you, none but a young Princess,
To whom I often told how blessed I was
With the most Tender and I^dulgent Father,
Who would at my Request end her Misfortunes.
What will she think o^ your Indifference?
Must all her Hopes be vain? Pray, gentle Father,
Dispel those Clouds that hover on your Brow.

Agam. Alas! My Daughter --

Iphig. My Lord, Go on.

Agam. Oh! I cannot --

Ip^ig. ^urst be th'adulterous Tro^an,
The ^atal Author ^f our di^e Al^^ns!

Agam. ^is Ru^n must b^ bought with Floods of Tears.

Iphig. I hope propitious Heaven will Protect your Head.

Agam. The Gods of late seem d^^l to all my Prayers.

Iphig. Calchas, they say, prep^^e^ a Sac^ifice.

Agam. May Heaven be appeased before it is Offered!

Iphig. Pray, when is that to be?

Agam. Too soon, Alas!

Iphig. Shall I be suffered
To join my Vows with yours before the Altar?

Agam. Oh! me!

Iphig. My Lord; you're silent --

Agam. No -- Yes -- You will be there, My Daughter --
^arewell -- Exit Agamemnon.

Iphig. His cold Reception fills my Mind with Doubts.
A secret Horror seizes all my ^i^bs:
^ear -- But know not w^^t, May Heaven avert
The Impending Wo^s -- Yet, whom they seem to threaten.
The Go^^ alone can tell --

Eriph. Madam, I wonder that amidst those Cares,
Which now employ your Father, a small Coldness
Can discompose y^^r Mind? Al^^! How anxious
My Tho^ghts must be?
Wherever I s^t my Steps I am a Stranger;
Lost an^ ^^an^on'd ^^om my ^^ry Cradle,
My unk^^^n Parents n^v^r cast upon me
A fl^tt^^^ng ^mile; You, if a cro^s Father
R^j^ct y^^^ datio^s L^ve, may yet complain
To a (...) Moth^^; my, i^ b^th should prove,
Un^^nd, a Lover (...) dry ^p your Tears.

Iphig. Yes, dear Eriphile, I own my Tears
Will soon be d^y'd at my Achilles's view:
His worth, my Father, my Heart bid me Love him.
Yet, What must I believe of this ^ond Lover?
Who se^m'd to ^urn with longing expect^tion
To meet me here? What keeps him from my Sight?
I have, for these two Days, upon our Jou^ney,
^ought him with trembling Looks; b^t all in vai^.
At last I Am welcomed by an unknown Crowd,
And s^ill he keeps away: Sad Agamemnon
^^em^ shy to name him to me. Where is he?
I^m full ^f Doub^s and Fears --, What! Have the Cares of War,
Chilled both a Father and a Lover's Heart?
But, no --, I wrong him by unjust Alarm^:
For he alone did never engage his Promise
To H^ll^n's Father: It Is on my Account
He ^lies to Troy; I am the only Prize
His gene^ous Love expects to Crown his Valor.

Enter Clyt^mnestra, with a Letter in her Hand. Clyt. Daughter, we must be
gone, and by a speedy Flight
Prevent our Shame; it is now no more a Riddle,
What made your Father troubled and uneasy
To see us here: This Letter clears all Doubts;
By faithful Areas he had sent it to me,
To spare u^ the Affront of a Denial.
But wandering from our Way, that Messenger
Could not convey it sooner --.
He w^ites, Achilles having changed his Mind,
Defers the Nuptial Rites till his Return.

Eriphil. What do I hear!

Clyt. You blush, and seem concerned at the Abuse --;
But let your Spirit arm you with Disdain. To Iphigenia.
Ungrateful Wretch! Deceived by his Renown,
I did at Argos countenance his Love,
And thought a Goddess's Son would make you Happy.
But since his vile Inconstancy belies
His noble Offspring from th'unchanging Gods,
Let Us now despise the basest of Mankind,
And fly this hated Shore; lest he should think,
We stay to court his dull Indifference.
Your Father is acquainted with my Purpose,
I only wait him here to take my leave.
In the mean time I Will see all Things prepared
For our departure --. As for you, Madam, To E^i^hile.
You Would think it hard to follow; our Retreat
Leaves you in better Hands; too well we know,
That it is not Chalchas that you came to see.

Exit, Clytemnestra, in a Fury. Iphig. In what amaze of Trouble has she left me,
By her perplexing Speech! Achilles having
Changed his Mind,
D^^e^s the Nuptial Rites till he Returns;
I must prevent my Shame by hasty Flight;
And it is not Calchas that you came to see. To Eriphi^e.

Eriph. The meaning of her Speech is a dark Riddle,
I cannot apprehend --.

Iphig. Nay, Madam, too, too well,
You know its meaning --, yet, if barbarous Fate In an Ironical Tone.
Ro^s me of a Hu^band, su^e, you will be more kind
Than to abandon me in my Misfortunes.
'^had been a Torment for you to have staid
At Mycene without me --, Shall the Queen
Now leave you ^ere alone?

Eriph Madam, I designed
To consult Calchas --.

Iphig. Then what is the Reason you don't haste to see him?

Erip. You speak of being gone within a Moment.

Iphig. Sometimes one Moment may clear many Doubts:
But, Madam, I Am too pressing: And now plainly see.
What I could never have thought -- Yes, it is Achilles
Who makes you so uneasy till we are gone.

Eriph. Can you suspect me of such Treachery?
I! Madam, Love a furious Conqueror,
Whose bloody Image haunts my fearful Mind,
E're since with Fire and Sword he spread Destruction,
Through all the Lesbian State? --

I^hig. Yes, Traytress, Yes, you love the fierce Destroyer:
And ^^l those Horrors with which you describe him,
His ^^nds embru'd with Blood, his ree^ing Sword,
And flaming Lesbos are the Characters,
Which left his pleasing Image printed in your Soul.
This, I remember, this made you so ^ond,
Still to repeat to me the doleful Story
Of your Captivity -- I might have seen
Your eager Passion through your feigned Complaints.
But my fond Friendship banished all Distrust,
I hugged and cherished a pe^^idious Rival;
Credulous Fool^ I loved her: Nay, I offered
The safe protection of her perjured Lover.
The Robbing me of him, I could forgive,
But to be brought to this detested Shore,
To meet the ungrateful Man who now forsakes me,
And grace the Triumph of a treacherous Friend,
This, this is an Abuse I cannot bear.

Eriph. Madam, you give me Words I never was used
To hear before --; And though hard Fate pursues me
With cruel Hate, yet such harsh sounds till now,
Were Strangers to my Ears; But I excuse
The Unjust Reproaches of an incensed Lover.
Which way could I prevent your Journey hither^
Can you suspect Achilles will prefer
A forlorn Maid to Agamemnon's Daughter?
One, who all she can learn of her Condition,
Is, that she is the Offspring of that Blood
He longs to spill --.

Iphig. The barbarous Wretch insults over my Misfortunes!
And still compares her vileness to my Glory,
Only to heighten her perfidious Triumph.
Was this then wanting to my load of Woe?
But have a care your Raptures be'nt too rash:
That Agamemnon you have dared, commands
All Greece; He is my Father; nay, he loves me,
And feels my Sufferings deeply as my self.
My Tears did melt him: I perceived those Sighs
He strove to hide from me; Fond Fool! I blamed
That Coldness which his Tenderness had caused.

Enter Achilles. Achil. Is It possible then, Madam! Do I see you?
Or is it fond Delusion? No! For the whole Camp,
Assured me you was here --, But, Madam, What concern
Has brought you to this Shore, since Agamemnon,
Give out Mycene would enjoy you still?

Iphig. My Lord, ^ear not my hated Presence here,
For Iphigenia will soon be gone.

Exit Iphigenia with a disdainful Air. Achil. She shuns me! Do I wake? Or is it
a Dream?
Gods! ^ow I am distracted at this Flight!
What shall I do? -- Madam, can I presume To E^iphil^.
To meet your Looks, and not provoke your ^atred?
Yet, if Achilles did e're pity you:
If you can now receive your Conquerours Prayer,
In^orm m^ why they are come --, sure, you can tell.

Eriph. My Lord, I wonder
You should be unacquainted with their Journey;
Since you have been a Month upon this Shore,
Still pres^ing their A^rival^ and your Nuptials.

Achill. I Madam? I was Absent this whole Month,
And only came last Night --.

E^ipil. ^ow, When Agamemnon did write to Mycene,
^^d not your Love Indite and Guide his Hand?
I tho^ght you was transported with the Charms
O^ ^is bright Daughter --.

Achil. Y^s: I still adore her.
N^y, i^ I had cons^l^ed b^t my Love,
(...) have (...) to see her at Mycene.
Yet, I (...) ^^^nn'd; but ^or what ^^ime I know not.
(...) I cast my Loo^s I meet a Foe:
An^ (...) this M^ment Calchas and U^^sses
Dis^l^^'d their Eloquence to oppose my Love,
And s^^m'd to intimate it shocked my Honor.
What can their Counsels mean? Am I abus'^?
And made a Tale to entertain the Army^
(...) in --, And wrench the Secret from their Souls.

Exit. Achilles. Eriph. Ye Gods! Who see my Shame, Where shall I hide it?
Proud Rival, thou art loved, and yet thou murmur'st.
Must I at once behold thy haughty Triumph,
And bear with thy Insults? No --, Let me rather --:
But, Doris, I Am deceived, or some great Storm,
Is gathering thick to break upon their Heads.
I Have Eyes: -- Their Happiness is not yet settled.
King Agamemnon Sighs, and is in Trouble:
He shuns his Daughter: Both avoid Achilles.
There Is something in it; I Will not yet Despair:
And if Fate listens to my Hatred's Call,
^^l die, but crush a Rival with my Fall. Exeunt Eriphil^, Doris

The end of the Second Act.
ACT III. SCENE 1.
Enter Agamemnon, Clytemnestra. Clyt. YES, my Lord,
My Indignation made me leave the Camp,
And ^ly Achilles view: Scorned Iphigenia
Designed Mycene should lament her Woe.
But ^^at young Hero wondering at our Flight,
Called all the Gods to prove his Constancy,
And stopped our Journey. Nay, he pres^es now
That Marriage, which before, 'twas said, he shunn'd^
^e seeks you full of Passion and of Love:
Fu^ious to know who raised this false Report,
And punish his audacious Insolence.
Therefore let no Suspicions pall our Joys.

Agam. Madam, it is well: Achilles must be trusted:
I own we wronged him: And I share your Joys,
As much, as least, as my concern allows.
Now since you wish that Cal^has should perform
The Nuptial Sac^ifice, it is ^it you send
Your Daughter to the Altar: I Will there wait her coming.
Yet first in private let me here advise you:
You see what place you're in, how every thing
Seems ^itter for a Fight, than for a Marriage;
The Tumult of an Army, and a Fleet:
An Altar bri^tling with Pikes, Darts and Spears,
Such hor^id Pomp may suit with fierce Achilles,
But is not calm enough to court your Sight,
It were unseemly that the Greeks should see,
Their Que^n bereft of aw^ul Majesty,
And undistinguished in a Crowd of Soldie^s.
Believe me, let your Maids alone attend
Your Daughter to the Altar --.

Clyt. I, Sir, resign my Daughter to my Wom^n^
And not accomplish what I have begun?
Have I then brought her hither from Mycene,
And shall I now refuse to lend my Hand
To lead her to the Priest? -- Is not this a Duty
Incumbent on a Mother? -- Who shall order
The Marriage Festival? -- ^

Agam. Madam, That might have been your Care
In Atreus's Palace: Now you're in a Camp.

Clyt. Yes, I am in a Camp,
Where the whole ^ate of Troy depends on you;
Where all the Grecians bow to your Command;
Where Thetis's Son will this Day call me Mother;
Pray, in what Palace could I e're appear
With greater Splendour and Magnificence?

Agam. Madam,
By all the immortal Authors of our Race,
I do conjure you, grant me this Request:
I have my Reasons.

Cl^^. My Lo^d,
By all those Powers you named, let me entreat you
Not to deny my Eyes that bliss^ul show.
Vouchsafe to see me there without a Blush.

Agam. I thought much better of a Wi^e's Compliance,
(...) my Arg^ments, and my Entreaties
C^^ have no force to bend your s^ubborn Mind,
Madam -- it is my Pleasure -- I command you --
O^ey --

Exit Agamemnon. Clyt. Ye Gods above! What makes my Husband use
Such ^arbarous C^re to keep me from the A^tar.
I^ he so ^levated with his Power,
That he disdains to own me for his Wife?
O^ is his new Command yet so unsettled
That he dares not appear with Hellens Sister?
B^t why that Nicety? Yet, since it is his Command
I willingly submit; my Daughter's Bliss
Makes me amends ^or all; th'indulg^nt Gods
U^ite her to Achilles, and my Joys
A^e Infinite to think she shall be called --
^ut he^e he comes himself --

Enter Achilles. Achil. M^dam, all things succeed to Crown my Wishes:
The King desires no further Satisfaction,
But tru^^s the Raptures o^ my eager Love.
^ ^carce began to clear my Innocence,
When with a kind Embrace he called me Son.
^is Words were ^ew: But, Madam has he told you
What happy News was spread at your Arrival?

Clyt. What Is that, my Lord?

Achil. The Gods will be appeased: The Priest proclaims
That the next Hour by solemn Sacrifice,
Neptune will be propitious to our Vows,
And wake the drowsy Winds; sure of his Promise
The joyful Mariners un^url their Sails,
And turn their Prows to Troy. As for me, Madam,
Though I were glad if to indulge my Love
The Winds should still be silent for a while:
Though with regret I quit the happy Shore,
Where Iphigenia will soon be mine,
Yet with delight I grasp the blessed Occasion,
To Seal this noble Match with Trojan Blood;
And in the Ruins o^ persidious Troy,
Bury the Shame o^ that respected Name,
To which mine will for ever be allied.
Enter Iphigenia, Eriphile, Aegina, Do^is. Fair Princess, all my Blis^ depends
on you:
Your Father waits our coming to the Altar; To Iphigenia.
Haste Madam, to receive the plighted ^ai^h
O^ your Adorer --

Ip^ig. My Lord, before we go,
I hope the Queen will suffer me to ask you
A Boon to prove your Love: Here Is a young Princess
Whose noble Aspect speaks her high D^scent:
Her Eyes continually dissolves in Tears,
You know her Troubles, for it is you have caused them.
And I just now transported with rash Passion,
Rudely insulted over her Affliction.
I would atone for my too-h^sty C^rriage,
And sooth her into Ease, but how I know not,
Unless it be by interceeding ^or her.
My Lord, she is your Captive, and those Chains,
Whose weight I pity, will at your Command
Fall from her Hands: Let then your generous Deeds
Begin this happy and auspicious Day.
Let sad Eriphile be now discharged
From our Attendance -- Let all the Grecians see,
That the great King to whom I plight my Faith,
Is not contented to spread dire Alarms,
And wild Destruction through the affrighted World,
But that he can relent at a Wifes Tears,
And like the Gods from whom he is Descended,
Will be disarmed by the Unfortunate.

Eriph. Yes, my Lord, you may alleviate
The quickest Pain a Woman ever felt.
It Is true the Fate o^ War made me your Captive;
But still you strain too high its rigid Laws,
Thus to o're-bear my Heart with all the Torments
I suffer here.

Achil. You, Madam?

Eriph. Yes, my Lord, and waving all the rest,
Could you impose a more severe Commnd,
Than here to make my Eyes the sad Spectators,
Of the Prosperity of all my Foes:
My Proud, my Haughty, Persecuting Foes.
Wherever I go, I hear the insulting Threats
Of a ^ierce Army, ready to destroy
My native Countrry: And to break my Heart,
I see, I see that fatal Hymen's Brand,
Which will devour it, and consume my Hopes.
Therefore permit me to retire from hence:
And wand^ing from your Sight, and still unknown,
^^wail the ^ardships of that dismal Fate, Weeps.
Which nothing but my Tears can well express.

Achil. Fair Princess, that is too much: Wipe of those Tears,
You have your Wishes; ^ollow to the Altar,
That all the Gre^ks may witness you a^e Free;
And may ^h^ Hour that gives you Liberty,
Make me f^r ever Blessed. Enter Arcas. To Cl^tem.

Arc. M^dam, all things are ready for the Sacrifice;
The King w^its at the Altar for your Daughter,
And sends me to D^mand her -- Or rather,
Sir, I come To Achilles.
To beg your h^lp a^ai^st him.

A^hil. What ^ay ^ou^ ^rcas?

Cl^t. Y^ Go^^^ What ^^ws is this?

Arc. You (...), my ^o^d, To Achilles.
Can now ^^o^^ct he^.

C^hil. Against whom?

Arc. My Lo^d it is wi^h regret I name him --
But I can keep no longer the black Secret,
And to be silent would be Treachery.
The Kni^e, the Fillet, the Pile, all is ready;
But were that fatal Pomp designed to take
My Life for the Discovery -- yet I must speak.

Clyt. Heaven! How I tremble! Quickly; Arcas,
Explain your meaning --

Achil. Whoever it be, speak boldly, fear him not.

Arc. My Lord, you a^e her Lover; and you, Madam,
Her tender Mother; suffer not the Princess
To meet her Father --

Clyt. What should we fear from him?

Achil. Why should we distrust him?

Arc. He waits her at the Altar, with intent
To Sacrifice her --

Achil. He! Agamemnon!

Clyt. His Daughter!

Iphig. My Father!

Eriph. Oh Heavens! What News!

Achil. Gods! What blind Fury
Can Arm his cruel Hand against his Daughter?
It Is Impious but to think on it.

Arc. Alas! my Lord, there is no room for Doubt:
The Oracle and Calch^s have prono^nc'd
The ^atal Doom, and stubbornly reject
All other Sacri^ice: The Gods themselves
Protect the Rav^sher, and bid the Winds
Lie hushed till that be o^fer'd.

Clyt. How can the Gods dec^ee so black a Deed?

Iphig. Heaven! What Is my Crime, that m^rits such hard ^ate?

Clyt. Now it is too plain
Why he imp^s^d ^n me such s^^ict Command^,
To keep me from the Altar.

Iphig. Is this the Mar^iage was designed ^or me? so A^hilles.

Arc. The King ^o blind you, did suppose ^his M^rriage^
And ^he whole Camp is still in the same Error.

Clyt. My Lord, Kneels.
Here let me grasp your Knees --

Achil. Al^s! Madam -- Raising her.
Pray rise --

Cl^t. My Lord, let me forget my troublesome State:
This low Submi^sion suits my cruel Fortune;
I were too happy if my Tears could touch, Weeps.
Your ^eart with Pity -- Alas! It Is your Bride
They snatch away from you. I brought her up
To the fond ^opes of this auspicious Match.
It Is you we sought on this detested Shore;
And it is you^ Name betrays her to her Fate.
Must she then go t'implore the Angry Gods,
And grasp that Altar dismally Adorned,
To Sacrifice her? You alone are here
Her Father, Husband and protecting God.
I read your Grief in your distracted Looks.
Daughter, I leave you in a Lovers Arms.
My Lord, I beg you, stay till I return.
I fly to meet my cruel, treacherous Husband,
And with just Rage oppose his wild Design.
I Will force the Priest to seek another Victim;
Or should my best Efforts prove vain, to ward
The fatal Blow, I Will die with my dear Daughter.

Exit Clytemnestra. Achil. Madam, all this while
My wonder kept me Dumb and Motionless.
Was it to me she spoke? Am I Achilles?
And must your Mother and a Queen disgrace
My noble Passion, to descend thus low
With unbecoming Posture, Prayers and Tears
To move my Pity? Who is more concerned
Than Thetis's Son in your Prosperity?
Yes; you may trust my Love, th'affront is levelled
At me alon^: What^v^r they attempt,
I answer ^^r a Li^e on which my own depends.
B^t my ^^st Anger do^s engage me fu^ther:
'Twe^e ^i^tle to protect, I will revenge you,
An^ pu^^^h all at once the ignoble Cheat,
(...) my Name ^or your undoing.

^pig^. ^ray, My Lord, slay -- Hear me --

Ac^il. God^, must a Ba^barian
Af^ront me t^us^ Whilst to ^evenge his Sister,
I fly ^o T^^^; whilst by my leading Vote,
^e holds ^ommand over twenty Rival Kings;
Whilst for m^ Se^vi^^s, and Wa^like Toils:
Whilst for the P^ice of that great Victory,
(...) will (...) him, Vindicate his Wrongs,
And Crown (...) Name for ever with Renown;
I am content^d with the glo^ious Title
O^ b^^ng you^s; the bloody Perjured Man
Thinks little to despise the sacred Laws
Of Love and Natu^^, and to rack my Soul
With the sad view, of your dear, Virgin Heart
Reekin^ upon an Altar, his black Deed
Must still ^e cove^'d by a Marriage Pomp;
It Is I must lead you to the Sacri^ice;
My credulous Hand must guide the fatal Kni^e;
An^ in the place of ^usband, I must prove
Your E^^cutioner -- Gods^ I grow Mad to think on it.

Iphig. My Lord, let not your Passion thus transport you.

Achil. Just Heaven! What had be^ome of all my ^opes,
Had not my coming forestalled your Ar^ival?
The harmless Bride aban^on'^ to their Fury,
^ad vainly sought her abs^nt Love, and met
A B^^cher Priest: Still charging on my Name
The ^loody, ^a^barous Cheat. Such Treac^ery
I will expos^ l^te before al^ Gree^e
M^^am, your honor is concerned in mine.
And th^^e^o^e you will approve my just Revenge
T^^ c^uel Man shall ^now Achill^s^s W^ongs
^e^e went unpunished --.

(...). My Lord, if ever you did truly Love me,
L^^ now my Pray^rs and Tea^s disa^m y^u^ Ang^^.
Co^si^e^ that Ba^ba^i^n whom you da^^.
That c^uel, (...), t^ea^h^^ous En^my,

Achil. Your Father, Madam? No -- ^i^ bl^^k Desi^n
Leaves him no other than a Mu^^he^er's Name

Iphig. My Lo^d, I s^ill ^ep^at it, H^'s my (...)
A Father whom I love, whom I ^eve^e;
A Father who till now h^s cherished me,
With all Indulgen^e and Paternal Care.
My Heart brought up even ^^om my Infancy,
To dutiful Re^pect, is sad when he is offended.
It Is not our Nuptial tie can make me lose,
My Duty, and allow your furious, Passion.
Yet, see, my Lord, how very much I love you^
Since I could bear to hear the outrageous injury,
You offerr'd to his Name. But how can you
Think him so barbarous that unconcerned
He Would see his Daughter bleed, if any way
He could prevent the cruel Sacrifice.
Believe me, Sir, I saw him sigh and weep.
Do not condemn him till you hear him speak^
Must his Heart, filled with Hor^ors, still encounte^
Your raging Hatred? --

Achil. Is It possible, Madam
Amidst your Danger is this all you ^ear?
A wild Barbarian (for this Name befits him)
Betrays you to the Priest like a tame Victim,
And when my Tenderness would stop his Fury,
You seem concerned to trouble h^s Repose;
I Am silenced he is excused, he is lamented;
For him you tremble, and it is me you fe^r.
Has then Achilles sued and sighed in vain?
Is this the Progress of my constant Love?

Iphig. Oh! Cruel Man! How can you doubt that love,
Of which I gave you such convincing Proofs?
You saw how with dry Eyes, and undisturb^d,
I heard the bloody Messenger of Death;
But, all ye Powers of Love! How deep was my Despair,
When at our first Arrival the false News,
O^ your inconstancy come to my Ears?
My just concern made me accuse the God's^
Reproa^h your Falsehood, and cu^se all Ma^^ind.
Then, t^en you might ^^ve seen, how much (...)
Your Love before my ^i^e -- Ala^! I thought
My gene^ous Flames had raised m^ (...) all Mo^^^l^
Perhaps the envious G^d^ have been prov^^'d,
By the Exc^^^ o^ my ^^licity.

ACT IV. SCENE I.
Enter Eriphile, Doris, they sit on a g^ee^ Bank near (...) Seashore. A SONG
Set by Mr. PVRCEL, and Sung by Mrs. ERWIN. I.
MORPHEUS, thou gentle God of (...) Repose,
The unruly Tumults of my Mind compose;
Allay the Fury of my anxious Care,
Drive hence black Thoughts, and chase away (...)
Here let indulgent Fancy sooth my Pain,
Here let me sleep, and never wake again,
II.
What Is this I feel? What this within my Breast,
Strikes such alarms, and will not let me rest?
It Is Iealousy, tormenting Iealousy!
The Bane of Love, tormenting Iealousy

I rage, I rave, I burn, my Soul's of ^^re:

Did^t th^^ not see her Triumph? How Achilles
Wa^ t^o^b^ed and conce^n'd? I saw, I saw it;
And sh^nn^ ^he ^igns of her undoubted Blis^.
The v^li^nt, p^^^d, insul^ing, ^ie^ce Achilles,
(...) to all humane kind;
Who (...) kn^w a Tear, but what he draws
(...) yes: Achilles, who ^tis said,
Was ^^ckled by a Lioness or a Tigress;
Achilles (...) her now begins to tremble,

Here ble^^ ^ondi^ion; Death it self were pleasing,
I^ I could purch^se fierce Achilles's Tears. Weep^^

Dor. Dea^ Madam, moderate your Sorrows^
Or if you weep, let Iphigenia
Bespeak your Tears; she was our kind Protectress,
And in an hour she dies. --

Eri^h. No, D^^is, she will not die --
Do thou believe Achilles wept in vain?
Think th^^ his Love and Courage will ly buried
In shame^ul Uncon^^rn? No, he will prevent
All her impending Dangers: Thou shall find
The angry God's pronounced this Oracle
To raise her Glory, aggravate my Woes,
And make her still the deare^ to her Lover.

Dor. What Reasons, Madam, can breed this Suspicion?

Eriph. Do thou not see
How all endeavor to prevent the Blow?
The ^atal Sentence is still kept a Secret;
And though all things be ready at the Altar,
The Camp is unacq^ainted with the Victim.
Does not ^his silence speak a wavering Father?
What can he do? What Heart of ^lint or steel
Could e^re resist the Assa^lts he must encounter?
The R^ge and Fury of an incensed Wife;
A (...) and Tears^ the deep Despair
O^ a wh^le Family; fond N^ture^^ s^^uggles;
^ebill^^'s th^eatning (...). No, it is in vain
The God's p^onounc'd her Doom, for she shall live
I, I alone m^^t be (...).
Oh^ (...) --

Dor. Madam, what do you mean?

^riph. Why don^t I follow
The angry Dict^tes of my jealous Mind?
And publish to the Camp the fatal Senten^e,
The Oracle pronounced, and how by impious Silence
They strive to make it void, and save the Victim
The God's demand --

Dor. Oh! What a wild Design!

Eriph. Oh! What excess of Joy!
What Altars would the Trojans raise to me,
If vindicating my Captivity,
I sowed Dissension through the Grecian Camp,
And armed Achilles against Agamemnon!
If I could make them lay aside their Quarrel
Against Troy, and turn their Arms 'against themselves!
If my malicious Whispers could destroy
The Gr^cian Army, and secure my Country!

Dor. Madam, I hear a noise -- It Is Clytemnestra:
Compose your self, or else avoid her Presence.

E^iph, Let Us in: And to prevent this hated Marriage,
I Will use all means -- The Gods allow my Passion.

Exeunt Eriphile, Doris. Enter Clytemnestra, Aegina. Clyt. Thou see, Aegina,
I must ^ly my Daughter^
So far she is from shedding any Tears,
Or trembling for her Life, that she excuses
Her cruel Father, and would have my Grief
Respect the Hand that strikes the cruel Blow.
Oh! Constancy! Oh! Reverence! Oh! Love^
Yet to reward all these, my Savage Husband
Complains of her Delay. I Will here expect him^
For, sure, he will come to expostulate with me
The reason of her stay. But he appears^
Be hushed my Passion; let me try how far
He can dissemble his base Artifice.

Enter Agamemnon. Agam. Madam, what do you mean? How comes this (...)
Don't o^^er ^phig^nia to my sight?
I sent Arca^ to demand her from you --
Where have y^^ left he^^ --
What stays her? I^ i^ you? (...) you not ^rant
My j^st Request? And do y^^ still (...)
To ^ollow to the Alta^?

Clyt. My L^^d, if she must (...),
My Daughter's ready: But does nothing stop you?

Agam. Me! M^d^m?

Clyt. But have you taken c^^e of all?

Agam. Calchas is ready; the Altar is prepared.
I have done all my Duty bid me do.

Clyt. My Lord, you tell me nothing of the Victim?

Agam. Madam?
What means this jealous care? Aside.

Enter Iphigenia. Clyt. Come, Daughter, Come; they only wait for you:
Be thankful to a kind, a loving Father,
Who will himself conduct you to the Altar. Weep^.

Agam. What do I see! What means my Wive's discourse?
Daughter, you weep, and look with downcast Eyes:
What Is this Dis^rder?
But b^th the Daughter and the Mother weep.
Oh! Arcas! I Am betrayed. --

Iphig. Father, be not alarmed: You're not not betray'd^
Comm^nd and I Will obey; my Life is Yours,
You may ^et^ke it without Artifice.
With that contented and submissive Heart,
With which I did accept a promised Husband,
If I must needs submit to Heaven's Decree,
I Will prove an innocent Victim, and respect
The Blow you order; with all due obedience
I Will spill that Blood, I have received from you.

Agam. Oh! dutiful Respect! Oh! wondrous Love!

Iphig. Yet, i^ this Reverence, this humble Love
Seem to deserve a better Recompense;
If you can pity a fond Mother's Grief,
My Lord I dare to say, that as I am
S^^^^nded with bright Honor, I could wish
A mi^d^r Fate, and that the bounteous God's
Would not cut off my Life so near its Spring.
It Is I (...) c^^l'd you by the Name of Father;
-- ^h^^ (...), endearing Name --
(...) th^^ N^me so o^^ you than^^d the God^
(...) I mad^ you^ Delight; with me y^u learnt
(...) Majesty, and not di^dain
-- With fond C^^esses to ^ssume the Father.
Alas! With how much e^gerness and Joy,
I loved to hear the Names of all those Countries
You went to Conquer? My p^esaging ^opes
Began to anti^ipate the wish^d-for News
O^ Troy's Destruction, and p^epar'd a Feast
To g^^ce your Triumph. Little did I think,
That to obtain your Victory, my Blood
Must ^i^st ^e spilled by you. --

Agam. Oh! She Will un^man me with her tender Words?

Ip^ig Not that the horror of the threatening Blow
Makes me remind You of your form^r Kindness^
Fear not: My Heart still care^ul of your Fame,
Shall ne'^e expo^e my Father to a Blush.
And had my Life alone been my Concern,
My gra^eful Thoughts had been concealed for ever
Within my dutious Breast. But, Sir, you know
That on my wretched Fate a tender Mother,
And a ^ond Lover fixed their Happiness.
A King whose worth you own, look^ on this Day
To light the Torch of our illustrious Hymen;
Sure of a Heart, you gave me leave to promise,
To his undoubted Love, he thought himself
The happiest of Mankind: -- But since he knows
Your ^atal p^rpose, judge of his Alarms
You see my Mother's woe, pardon, dea^ Father,
My weak endeavors to p^event their Tears. Weeps.

Agam. Daughter, ^is but too true: The angry God's
Demand a Victim, for what Crime, I know not:
But you are named. A cruel Oracle
Commands that you shall bleed^ --
To save your precious Life from ^he black Doom,
My Love prevented your endearing P^ayers.
I wave to tell you how long I withstood:
Believe that Love which you just no^ attested.
This very Night I did recall the O^der.
Which they before had wre^^ed from my Hand.
I sacrifi^'d to you the cause of Greece,
My Ambition, my Safe^y, nay, ^y Honor.
Arcas was sent to keep you from the C^mp.
But the Go^'s would not ^uffe^ he sh^^ld ^eer you;
They baf^led my E^for^s. Oh! W^e^ched Father,
Who vainly Strove to guard, what they ^u^^ue^
Tru^^ not to my unsettled feeble Power:
What C^rb could hol^ a (...)
(...) ^^om the unea^y (...)
By holy Zeal, and (...)
^aughter, your hour (...) yield.
But, even in Death, rega^^ (...) ^^ee;
And mind a Counsel which I (...) follow:
Since the sad Blow that st^ikes (...) Heart shall sink
Deeper in mine; yet, let your Constancy,
Approve your Birth, and make the God's ashamed
O^ their black Sentence. Go -- Let all the Grecians
Know by your Courage, it is my Blood they spill.

Cl^t. No: Do you not belly your fatal Race:
It Is plain you spring from Atreus and Thyestes.
Butcher to your own Daughter, to complete
Your natural Cruelty, you only want
To entertain me with the ghastly Feast
Of all her slaughtered Limbs. Oh! Barbarian!
Is this the auspicious Sacrifice your care
Prepared with so much Art and Secrecy?
How could your Hand subscribe the black Decree,
And not be stopped by the horror of the Deed?

Agam. Oh! Wretched Father! Wheeps.

Clyt. Force not before us a dissembling Woe;
Nor think your Tears can prove your Tenderness.
What Fights are those you fought in her Defense?
What Floods of Blood were spilled to save her Life?
Where Is the wild Havoc that speaks your Resistance?
What Heaps of Slain can silence my Complaints?
These Savage Man, these are the Witnesses,
By which your Love should show your just Concern,
For Iphigenia's Life.

Agam. Madam, the God's must be obeyed:
A fatal Oracle pronounced her Doom.

Clyt. Have not all Oracles a dubious meaning?
Are the just God's so pleased with murderous Deeds
That innocence must bleed? If Hellen's Crime
Must be a^on'd for in her Family,
^et then H^rmione be fetched from Sparta,
She Is her own Daughter: Let fond Menelaus
With his own Blood redeem his guilty Wi^e.
But what blind Fury leads you to the Altar,
To expiate her Crime, and be his Victim?
Why must ^ ^end and tear a Mother's Breast,
And pay hi^ Fondness with my dearest Blood?
Nay, is this Author of so many Jars,
This great Disturber of ^he East and West,
A worthy Prize to crown your warlike Toils?
How often have we blushed at her Disgrace?
Before your Brother by a fatal Tie
Made her his Consort, had not Theseus dared
To s^eal her from her Father? Does not Calchas
Assure us that from their clandestine Mat^h
A P^incess sprung, who still is left unknown?

Agam. Oh! Cruel Honor!
Un^o^tuna^e Alliance!

Clyt. But, no: A Brother's Love, his injured Honor,
Are the least Cares that trouble your Repose.
Your Thirst of Empire, nothing can allay;
Your haughty Pride of having twenty Kings
Attend and fear You: The supreme Command
Lodged in your Person, these, Oh! Wild Barbarian,
The^e are the Gods to whom you Sacrifice;
And careless of the Blow, your Unconcern
Courts the Applause of the affrighted Greeks.
Too jealous of your fatal envied Power,
You're glad to purchase it with your own Blood:
And by so dear a Price deterr the Boldness
Of your Competitors. -- Is this to be a Father?
Oh! I grow mad -- This cruel Treachery
Hurries my Senses into wild Distraction.
A Priest, surrounded by a barbarous Crowd,
Shall lay his Murde^ing hand upon my Daughter;
Shall Tear her Bosom, and with cruel Eyes
Consult her panting Breast --
Whilst I who brought her to the Camp in Triumph,
Must return home, disconsolate and attended
With black Despair: I must behold the Way
Still fragrant with the Flowers strewn on her P^ssage
No, no: It shall not be said I brought her here,
To be thus butchered, if with the same Blow
You offer not a double Sacrifice.
No Tears, No Duty shall e're part me from her^
Unless you tear ^er from my Slaughtered hands.
Barbarous Husband, no less barbarous Father,
Come, if you dare, and wrest her from her Mo^he^
Daughter, go in: At least this time for all
I Will be obey^d --
Exeunt Clytem^estra. ^phig^nia^ (...) Agamemnon Solus. These are the f^rious
Clamou^s I expected:
These are the loud Complaints I feared to hear.
Yet, i^ my wavering and distracted Mind,
Feared nothing but their Cries, I Would not regard them.
Alas! Why did the Gods impose upon me
^o ^igid a Command, yet, leave me still
A Fa^her's Heart?

E^^^r Achill^s. (...) My Lord, a strange Report has reached my E^rs
(...) both our Sakes I wi^h it may be false,
(...) said, and with jus^ horror I repeat it,
That ^phig^nia by your Command
Expires this day; That having silenced Nature,
And all the Dicta^^s of ^um^nity,
With your own hand you give her to the Priest;
That 'ti^ my Name that b^ing^ her to the Altar;
That you suppo^'d
These Nuptial^ t^ amuse us; and to make me
The shameful Inst^ument of this black Murder.
What say you to^t, My Lord? What must I think on it?

Agam. My Lord,
I never give account of what I do:
My Daughter's unacquainted with my Will;
But when I think it proper to inform her,
You then may learn her Fate: I Will give the Camp
My Sovereign Orders. --

Ac^il. Too well I know what cruel Fate attends her.

Agam. Then why d' ye ask?

Achil. Why I do ask? Ye Gods! Is It possible,
That he can dare t'avow so black a Deed?
Think you I will approve your wild Design?
Think you my plighted Faith, my Love, my Honor,
Will e're consent to let your Daughter bleed?

Agam. But you, who dare to speak with threatening Voice,
Have you forgot who it is you ask such Questions?

Achil. And have you, Sir,
^orgot who it is I Love? Whom you affront?

Agam. Who bids you be concerned about my Family?
May Not I dispose of Iphigenia
Unless you be consenting? Am I not
Her Father s^ill? Is She your Wife? May Not she --

Achil. No -- she is yours no more --
I Am not to be amused with frivolous Hopes:
You swore she should be mine; and therefor, Sir,
As long as I have blood within my Veins,
I will maintain those Rights your Promise gave.
But, Sir, was it not for me she came to Aulis?

Agam. Expostulate with the Gods, it is they demand her.
A^cuse the Priest, Ulysses, M^n^laus:
Accuse the Camp; nay, first accuse your Self.

^^hil. Me!

Agam. Yes, you: Who greedy of the Eas^ern Conquest,
Quarrel each day with Neptune and the Winds.
You who offended at my just Alarms,
Have sp^ead your eager Fury through the Camp.
My tender Heart had ^ound a way to save her:
But Troy is all you wish, all you demand.
I stopped the Race which you desi^'d to run,
Her Death will set it open; Go -- depart.

Achil. Hell-Furies! Can I hear and b^ar all thi^
Is It thus you aggravate your Perjury
With base Affronts? What! Did I e're desire
TO obtain a Wind with Iphigenia's Blood?
What great Concern makes me repair to Troy?
For whom do I neglect my Parent Goddess,
And my disconsolate Father's fond Advice?
Why do I court that Death the Oracle
Foretold their Son? What Wrongs are those I suff^r'd?
Was e're a Trojan Fle^t so bold to dare
Make a Desce^t on my Thessalian Sho^e?
Did e're a Ravisher come to Larissa,
To s^eal away my Sis^er or my Wise?
What loss have I sus^ain'd? I^'t not ^or you,
Barbarian as you are, I ^ly to Troy?
^or you, whom I inv^sted with Command
Over all the Grecian P^inces and my sel^.
For you, whom I revenged in ^laming Le^b^s,
Before your gathered Forces met in Aulis.
But what prevailing Motive called us hither?
Was it not to resto^e a ^avish'd Wise
To Men^la^s? Then who can think I will
Be wanting to my self, and tamely yi^ld
The Bride I Love. It Is tru^ you^ Bro^he^ su^fe^'d
A base A^front; but then has he alone
A Right ^o (...) W^ongs? I too will vindicate
My injured honor -- I love your Daughter:
She only has my Vows: To her I promised
My Ships, my Soldiers, nothing to your Brother.
Let him pursue his Wife, and seek a Triumph
The God^ have promised to my Blood alone.
What Is Hellen, Paris, Priamus to me?
^.
(...) the Prize ^or which I^ll quit this Shore,
And ^^y to Troy.

A^am. Then, ^ly from hence: Return to Th^ssaly.
I (...) you from your solemn Vows.
Others will come submissive to my Power,
To ^e^p t^^s^ Laurels, which to you we^e promis'd^
And ^^^cing Destiny by glorious Deeds,
Will gladly meet their Death before the Walls
Of ^uin'd Troy. I s^^ through your Contempt,
How dear I bought your haughty, proud Assistance^
By you^ insulting Speech it seems you a^e
The Arbiter of Greece, and that I bear
An empty Tide. To your boast'd Valor
All must submit: All follow your Command.
A kindness when reproached becomes a Wrong:
I ask less Valor, but more Obedience.
Away -- I cancel all our former Ties,
Regardless of your Friendship, or your Hatred.

Ac^il. Thank that one Tie that holds my boiling Passion.
I still respect my Iphigenia's Father.
But wer^t not for that Name, perhaps the Chief
Of Twenty Kings had dared me once for all.
One Word and I have done: But mark me well.
Your Daughter and my Honor ly at stake:
I will defend them both; And if you would reach
The Heart you aim to strike, This is the way Points to his Breast.
Through which your Blow must pass.

Exit Achilles Agam. And this shall make her Sentence past recall:
My Daughter was more dread^ul by her Self.
Thy haughty Love, that thinks to make me tremble,
Anticipates the Blow, thou meanst to ward.
No more Debates --
It is resolved I Will dare his Insolence:
My injured Honor summons all my Reason,
And his proud Threats d^termine the Contest,
'Twixt Nature and the Gods; for now my Pity
Would look like Fear -- Guards --

Enter Eurybates, Guards. Euryb. My Lord.

Agam. What am I doing!
How can I give the bloody, rash Command?
Barbarous Man!
What Fight do thou Prepare? What hated Foe,
Art thou exposing to their Violence?
A Mother waits me: An undaunted Mother,
Who will defend her against a murdering Father.
I shall behold my Men less cruel than my self,
Respect my Daughter guarded by their Queen.
It Is true Achilles threatens and contemns me:
But still my Daughter's constant to her Duty;
She neither flies the Altar, nor declines
With murmuring Discontent the Blow I give,
What means my horrid, sacrilegious Zeal?
What Vows can I address for such a Victim?
A glorious Harvest waits me: But what Laurels
Can please, when stained by Iphigenia's Blood?
I will appease the angry Gods: But, oh!
What Gods, can be more cruel to me, than I am to my Self?
No: 'twill not be. I yield to Love, to Nature:
I Will not blush at my Pity, she shall live.
But what! Am I
Regardless of my Fame? Must proud Achilles
Carry the Day, and think I feared his Threats?
What frivolous care disturbs my anxious Mind!
He loves my Daughter:
She Will make another blessed. -- Eurybates
Call hither Clytemnestra and the Princess:
Tell them they need not fear. --
Exit Eurybates^ Almighty Powers!
If your immortal Hatred perseveres
To wrest her from my Hands, what can weak Mortals do,
I know my Love destroys what I would save:
Yet such a Victim does at least deserve
A confirmation of your rigorous Laws,
And that you should demand it once again.
^nt^^ Clytemnostra, I^hig^ni^, ^^iphile, Aegina, Do^i^, Eury^^^^s (...) you

Wh^r^ ^^^^lty bears sway. My Guards, commanded

And may the Gods contented with my Tears, W^ep.

For a long time. -- Guards, attend the Queen.

Iphig. Oh^ Father^ Weep

Agam. Once more, avoid the impatient, ba^ba^ous P^iest:
Be gone, ^ly ^ence -- To favou^ your Escape
^ll find some Reasons to make him suspend,
The fatal Sacrifice till the next day.

Exeunt all but Eriphile, Do^i^. Eriph. D^ris, this Way.

Do^. Madar^, don^t you follow:

Achill^^'s Tenderness fills me with Rage.

Come, ^o ^he Priest I will discover all.

Exeunt Eriphile, Doris. The END o^ the Fourth ACT.
ACT V. SCENE I.
Enter Iphigenia, Aegina holding her. IPhig. Aegina, cease to stop me: Go,
return
To my abandoned Mother: The angry Gods
Must be appeased; see how they are provoked
By our Efforts to rob them of their Victim.
Behold what Storm is gathering thick around us;
Consider to what State the Queen's reduced;
See how the ^urious Camp prevents our Flight^
How with bold Insolence their pointed Spears
Stop up our Passage --

Aegin. Dear Madam, stay:
Don't run to certain Ruin.

Iphig. All hopes are vanished:
Our Guards repulsed: My Mother in a Swoon^
Oh! Why should I expose her any more?
Or wait her feeble help in vain? No, rather
Let me fly from her, whilst her troubled Sen^^s
Will su^^e^ me to meet my cruel Fate.
See, see how all conspires for my undoing,
For even my Father when he bids me Live,
Commands my Death. --

Aegin. He, Madam? How!

Iphig. Achilles, I suppose, offended him,
Too eager to defend his injured Love.
Yet, as he hates him, I must hate him too.
My Heart must offer up this Sacrifice,
This horrid, cruel, Sacrifice of Love.
Arcas declared to me my Father's Will^
He orders I shall never speak to him.

Aegin. Oh! Cruel Father!

Iphig. Oh! Fatal Doom^ Oh! Rigorous Dec^^e
The milder Gods demanded but my Life;
Then set's ^hey Lets die: -- What do I see^
Heaven! It Is Achi^^^^.

Enter Achilles. A^^i^. Come, M^d^m, ^ollow me: Fear not the Tumult
Of that weak crowd that presses ^ound this Tent.
Do b^t app^ar: You Will s^e thi^ M^l^itude
Ne'^e da^e to stand the ^iercenes^ of my Blow,
But open of themselves to let y^u Pass.
My ^riend Patr^^les, wi^h s^m^ other Captains
That ^ollow my Command, ^ly to your Succor
With all the Choice of my Thessalian Troops.
The rest assembled near my Tent will offer
The impenetrable Bulwark of their Ranks.
Behind this she^ter you may bid defiance
To all your Pe^secutors: Let who dares
Approach A^hille^'s Tent. But, Madam, is it thus
You second my Ef^orts? And answer me
Only with Tear^? You tried their feeble Succor
Before your Father^ yet ^twas all in vain.

Iphig. My Lord, too well I know it, and therefore
I have no hopes but from my certain Death.

A^hil. Oh^ Name not Death: Consider by what Ti^
You're joined to me: Consider all my Bliss
Depends on you. --

Iphig. No, No: The Gods did never intend
To ^ix your Bliss on my unhappy Days.
Our Love deceived us: ^Tis by Heaven decreed
My ^peedy Death shall cause your Happiness.
My Lord, c^nsider what a C^op of Glory
^ict^ry presents to crown your warlike Toils.
Yet all those Fields of Honor will prove barren,
Unless besprinkled with my fatal Blood.
In vain my Father strove t^ evade the Sentence
That Ca^ch^s had pronounc^d: The immortal Gods
Loudly d^cla^^ their Will by the whole Camp
Combined ^or my undoing. --

A^hil. Madam,
Achi^les will encounter the whole Camp,
And silence their loud Threa^s.

Ip^^g. My lord,
(...) not my ^ife dep^ive you of your Honors:
Make good the Oracle^ Go, Signalize
(...) ^eroe promised to our Country,
(...) you Grief upon i^s c^uel Foes
Now Priamus ^urns Pale: Now Troy alarm^d
Does ^ear my ^uneral Pile, and dreads your Tear^^
Lay waste the hated City: Leave my Death
To be lamen^ed by the Trojan Widows.
I die contented with these pleasing Hopes,
That if my cruel Stars do not permit,
I should live happy with my dear Achilles,
Yet After^Ages will record my Name
With your immortal Deeds, and that my Death,
The Spring of your famed Actions, will b^gin
The wondrous Story. --
Farewell, my Prince: Blessed O^^ spring of the Gods
Farewell. --

Achil. No, no: You shall not take your fatal leave:
In vain your cruel and ^e^swadi^g A^ts,
S^ily endeavor to deceive my Love,
And serve your barb^^ous, inhumane Father;
In vain you're obstinate to your undoing,
And strive to make my Honor an Accompli^^;
That Crop o^ glorious Laurels, that Renow^,
I find them all in saving what I Love.
Who, for the ^uture, would court my Assistanc^,
If I could not secure my promised Bride?
My Love, my Honor, both ^id you should liv^.
Madam, obey their Call, and ^ollow me.

Iphig. What! Sir, rebel against my Father!
And so deserve that Death you bid me shun^
What must become of my Respect, my D^ty?

Achil. Discharge them both in following a (...).
Your Father has approved. In vain he st^ives
To rob me of that Title; I Will never s^ffer
The Violation of his solemn Promise.
Madam, your Self, whom rigid Duty aws,
Did not you own him as your Father, when
He gave You to me? Do you only ^ollow
His sovereign Will when ceasing to be Fa^he^,
He Murders his own Daughter?
But, Madam^ we wa^te Time, and my ju^^ ^e^r -- ^

Iphig. Wh^^^ My ^o^d, would you (...)
And hurried by your ^ierce and impi^u^ (...)
Complete my cr^el Woes? How c^n you b^
Less tender of my honor th^n my Li^^?
Alas! My L^^d, spare Ip^ig^nia:
Spare my Affli^tion. I have (...)
That rigorous Law ^ o^ght to (...)
(...)
Would strive to oppose the S^orm wi^h d^untless Courage;
Madam, what can he do? What Valor could dispe^
That Multi^ude of Foes that will surround him.

Cl^t. Then let them come and prove their (...) Z^^l
On ^orlorn me: Let their blind Fury take
The weak Remainder of my wretched Life.
Death, Death alone is able to unclasp
My grasping ^ands from Ip^igenia.
My Soul shall first be sev^r'd from my Body
Than I from my dear Daughter -- ^

^ Iphig. Oh! Madam! What cruel Star did (...)
That inau^picious Day when you brough^ (...)
The unhappy Object of your tender Love
Alas! What can your weak E^^orts per^orm^
Abandoned as we are? You must encounter
Both Gods and Men confederate to undo me.
Meet not the Rage of a fierce Multitude^
Let not your Fondness lead you to the C^mp,
Against ^ ^usband's Orders, and alon^
Strive not in vain to save me^ --
Don't aggravate my Woes wi^h the sa^ View
Of a dear Mother basely dragged along
By a licentious Band of furious Soldiers^
Go -- let the Greeks appease the angry G^d^;
And leave for ever this detested Shore.
Fly from the sight of those devouring Flames.
Which would oppress your tender Heart with (...)
While they consume your Guiltless Daughter --
And, as you love me with Maternal Fondness,
I beg you ne'^e reproach my Father with my Death.

Clyt. What! Not reproach the wild Barbari^n,
Who leads his Daughter to a Murdering Priest!

Iphig. Madam, Consider
All he has done to save me, and prevent
Your cruel Woe.

Clyt. Oh! By what Treachery
The ba^barous Man deceived me!

Iphig. Madam, He but resigns me to the G^ds
That gave me to him: Yet Death takes not from you
The only offspring of your nuptial Jo^s.
Your mutual ^oves have still another ^ledge
In young Orestes: May he prove less ^^^al
To his dear Mother, than his wretched Sister^
^^dam.
You hea^ ^he Voice of an impatient People. Shoutings within.
Summon (...) Constancy; Pray, let me go --
Now take my l^s^ Farewell -- Clytemnestra ^aints.

W^^^ innocent Blood, and not devour the Grecians
In the dark Bottom of the wa^^y Deep?
Shall then the Winds, whom they so long accused,

Their guilty Fleet?
And Thou, immortal Sun, who on this Shore
Behold^^ the Son and ^eir of bloody Atr^us:

Of ^is inhumane Father, now withdraw

(...), Oh! Heaven! Oh! Earth! Oh! Wretched Mother!
With ^a^al Garlands Iphig^nia crowned,
Like a ^a^e Victim, waits the cruel Knife
Her Father has prepa^'d; the murderous Priest
Is just ready to strike -- Hold, B^^c^e^s, hold^

Hold -- Hold. Runs off with her (...).
