The Mistaken Mid-vvife, OR, Mother Midnight finely brought to Bed.
Relating how a Midwife in London being married to the third Husband, and not
having a Child in all that time; to take off the scandal of Barreness,
pretending to be with-child, wore a Pillow under her clothes, to deceive her
Neighbors. And the time of her delivery being come, she provided a dead child,
whereof she pretended to be privately delivered: But upon suspicion, being
found by a Jury of Women to be none of her own: she was sent to prison, where
she now remains.

What nature did deny her on her part,
She was resolved for to supply by art.
Tune of, I am a Jovial Bachelor, etc.
With Allowance.

A Midwife lately in this town,
by folly was misled,
Who many a woman had lain down,
and brought them unto Bed;
She to three husbands married was,
which made her almost wild,
Because in all that time^ alas,
she could not have a Child.
A project came into her mind,
the world for to deceive,
And how she might her neighbors blind,
and make them to believe;
That she from Barrenness was free,
and fruitful as the best,
Thus with her self she did agree,
^
A little Pillow she prepared.
which cunningly she placed,
And to the women then declared,
she should not be disgraced;
Quoth she my time of joy is come,
I now am big with child,
I f^el the babe spring in my womb*
and thus she them beguiled.
Her neighbors being credulous
believed the words she spoke,
And for a time it passed thus,
under this feigned cloak:
Because they ever used still,
her help in time of need;
So every one with a good will,
(...) that (...) well might speed.


HEr simple Husband he poor man,
knew nothing of the Cheat,
But to provide what ever he can,
of dainties for her Meat:
For fear she should her longing lose,
and what she went withal;
Thus did she lead him by the Nose,
and made him pay for all.
And now the time it did draw nigh,
she should be brought to bed,
Great preparations speedily,
was ready furnished:
And all things put in order d^e,
against the joyful hour;
With childbed linen fine and new,
according to her power.
And so this Wretch provided had,
to compass her own ends,
A child which had been buried,
and sent for none but friends:
Who privy were unto the Plot,
pretending sudden pains,
That she delivered was God wot,
but now the rest remains.
She for the burial did prepare,
of her pretended Child,
And seemed to be full of care,
as are all Mothers mild.
and to that end in readiness,
she had provided Wine,
But all her craft did not prevail,
as she did there design*
Some Women who suspected had
her carriage all the time,
Gave notice of her dealings bad,
and did divulge her crime:
So that a Jury of Women wise,
were summoned to appear,
Who found she told nothing but lies,
and made the business clear.
She for the dead Child questioned was
how she came by the same,
She still affirmed it was her own,
and they were much to blame.
Pretending weakness in that case,
she begged and did prevail,
That for some time in her distress,
she might be under bail.
But fearing what would be the end,
of this her folly great,
For to escape she did intend,
which was discovered straight:
And so she was to Prison sent,
whereas she does abide,
For to receive due punishment,
when as she shall be tried
Thus did she strive for to obtain,
what nature did deny,
To blind the world it was in vain,
her fraud they did espy:
Ho^e'r^ it was a cunning slight,
as ever did befall:
To bring a Child into the World,
and feel no pain at all.
