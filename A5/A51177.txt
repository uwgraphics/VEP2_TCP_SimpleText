THE COPY OF A LETTER Sent from France by Mr. Walter Mountagu to his Father
the Lord Privy Seal, with his answer thereunto.

Also a second answer to the same Letter by the Lord Faukland.



Imprinted, 1641.

My Lord,
AFter much debate concerning the fittest expression of my duty to your
Lordship, whether I ought by silence seek to suspend the belief of the
declaration of my self, I have made here, or by a clear profession of it
assure you of what I may only fear to present you with, as apprehensive of a
mis-interpreted affection, I concluded what was most satisfactory to my first,
and immediate duty to God, was most justifiable to my second, and derivative to
Nature, therefore I resolved so soon to give you this ingenuous account of my
self; The greatest part of my life capable of distinction of Religions has
been employed in places and conversant with persons opposite to the faith I was
bred in, therefore it had been strange if natural curiosity without any
spiritual provocation had not invited me to the desire of looking with mine
own eyes upon the foundation I stood upon, rather there holding fast blindfold
by my education to agree to be carried away always after it insensible of all
shocks I met to unfasten me, and besides I was solicited with the reproaches
Protestants press upon Catholics, that they blindly believe all the impostures
of the Church, without any illumination of their judgments; this me thought
enjoined the cleerest information of my self of the differences between us I
could propose to my capacity. So at my last journey into Italy, I did employ
all my leisure to a more justifiable settlement of my belief, as I then
imagined to a confirmation of my judgment, in what had been introduced by my
birth and education; I began with this consideration, that there were two sorts
of questions between the Catholics and Protestants, the one of right or
doctrine, the other of fact or story; as this, whether Luther were the first
erector of the Protestants Faith; whether it had a visible appearance of
Pastors and Teachers before his time? I resolved to begin my enquiry with the
matter of fact, for these Reasons; first because they were so few, and so
comprehensible by all capacities; and the controversies of doctrine intricate,
and so many, as they required much time, and learning for their disquisition
only, and I found my self unprovided of both those Requisitions, for this
undertaking: and for the decision of the other, I needed not much presumption
to believe my self a competent Judge when it consists only in a perusal of
authentike testimonies; Secondly, I considered that there was no one part of
controverted Doctrine, whereon all the rest depended, but that this one
question of fact was such as the decision of it determined all the rest; for if
Luther could be proved to be the Innovator of the Protestants faith, it was
necessarily evicted of not being the true, ancient, and Apostolical Religion,
therefore I began with this enquiry which Protestants are bound to make, to
answer this Objection, to find out an existence of some Professors of the
Reformed Doctrine before Luthers time; for finding the Catholics were not
obliged to prove the Negative, it was my part to prove to my self the
Affirmative, that our Religion was no Innovation by some Pre-existence before
that, but in the perusal of all the Stories or Records Ecclesiastical or
Civil, as I could choose, I could find no ancienter a dissension from the
Roman Church, then Waldo, Wickliffe, and Huffe, whose cause had relation to the
now-professed Protestancie, so as I could find an intervall of about 800 years
from the time that all Protestants confess an unity with the Church of Rome,
down to those persons without any apparent profession of different faith: to
answer my self in this point, I read many of our Protestant Authors who
treated of it, and I found most of them reply to this sense, in which I cite
here one of the most authentike, Doctor Whitaker, in his Controversy 2. 3..
page 479. Where they ask of us where our Church was heretofore for so many
ages? We answer that it was in secret solitude, that is to say, it was
concealed and lay hid from the sight of men; and further the same Doctor Chap.
4. page 502. Our Church always was, but you say it was not visible, does that
prove that it was not? No, for it lay in a solitary concealment To this direct
sense all the answers were that ever I could meet with, to this objection, I
repeat no more; those places being so positive to our point, this confession of
Invisibility in our Church for so many ages did much perplex me, it seemed even
to offend natural Reason, such a derogation from Gods power or providence, as
the sufferance of so great an eclipse of the light of this true Church, and
such a Church as this is described to be, seeming to me repugnant to the main
reason why God has a Church upon earth, to be a conserver of the doctrine of
Christ, and his precepts, and to convey it from age to age, until the end of
the World: therefore I applied my study to peruse such Arguments as the
Catholics brought for the proof of the necessity of a continual visibility of
the true Church down from the Apostles time in all ages, and appearance of
Doctors teaching and administering the Sacraments; in proof of this I found they
brought many provisoes of Scripture, but this Text most litterall of the fourth
of the Ephesians: Christ has placed in his Church Pastors and Doctors to the
consummation of the Saints, till we meet in the unity of the faith: and next
the discourse upon which they infer this necessary visible succession of the
Church, seemed to me to be a most rational and convincing one, which is to
this effect. Natural reason not being able to proportion to a man a course
that might certainly bring him to a state of supernatural happiness, and that
such a course being necessary to mankind, which otherwise would totally fail
of the end it was created for, there remained no other way, but that it must be
proposed unto us by one whose authority we could not doubt of, and that in so
plain a manner, as even the simplest might be capable of it as well as the
Learned. This work was performed by our Savior, from whose mouth all our faith
is originally derived. But this succeeding age not being able to receive it
immediate from thence, it was necessary it should be conveyed unto them that
lived in it by those that did receive it from Christ's own mouth, and so from
age to age until the end of the World; and in what age soever this thread of
doctrine should be broken, it must needs be acknowledged, for the reason above
mentioned, that the light which should convey mankind through the darkness of
this world was extinguished, and we left without a guide to inevitable ruin,
which cannot stand with Gods providence and goodness; which Saint Augustine
affirms for his opinion directly in his Book de vtil. cred. cap. 16. saying
if divine providence does preside over our humane affairs, it is not to be
doubted but that there is some authority constituted by the same God upon which
going as upon certain steps we are carried to God; Nor can it be said he
meant the Scripture only by these steps, since experience shows us by the
continual altercation about the right sense of several of the most important
places of it, that what is contained there cannot be a competent rule to
mankind, which consists more of simple then learned men; and besides the
Scripture must have supposed to have been kept in some hands whose authority
must beget our acceptance of them; which being no other then the Church of all
ages, we have no more reason to believe that it has preserved the Scripture
free from all corruption then that it has maintained it self in a continua^^
(...)isibility which Saint Augustine concludes to be a mark of the true
Church in these words in his book contra Cecill. 104. The true Church has
this certain sign that it cannot be hid, therefore it must be known to all
Nations, but that part of the Protestant Donatist is unknown to many, therefore
cannot be the true; No inference can be stronger then from hence that the
concealment of a Church disproves the truth of it; Lastly, not to insist upon
the allegation of the sense of all the Fathers of the Church in several ages,
which seemed to me most clear; that which in this cause weighed much with me
was the Confession and Testimony of the approved Doctors themselves of the
Protestant Church, as Hooker in his book of Eccles. Pol. page 126. God always
had and must have some visible Church upon earth. And Doctor Field the first of
Eccle. cap. 10. It cannot be but those that are the true Church must be known
by the Profession, and further the same Doctor says how should the Church be
in the World, and no body profess openly the saving truth of God? And Doctor
White in his defense of the way, cap. 4. page 790. The providence of God has
left monuments and stories for the confirmation of our Faith, and I confess
truly that our Religion is false, if a continual descent of it cannot be
demonstrated by these monuments down from Christ's time; this appears unto
me a direct submission of themselves to produce those apparent testimonies of
the public profession of their faith, as the Catholics demand, but this I
could never read, nor know of any that performed; For D. White himself for want
of proof of this, is fain to say in another place in his way to the Church p.
520. The Doctors of our faith have had a continual succession though not
visible to the world, so that he flies from his undertaking of a conspicuous
demonstration of the monuments of his faith to an invisible subterfuge, or a
belief without appearance: for he says in the same Book in an other place
page 4. All the external government of the Church may fail so as a local and
personal succession of Pastors may be interrupted, and page 40^. We do not
contest for an external succession, it suffiseth that they succeed in the
Doctrine of the Apostles, and faithful who in all ages did embrace the same
truth; so as here he removes absolutely all external proofs of succession
which before he consented to be guided by; I cannot say I have verbally cited
these Authors, because I have translated these places, though the Original be
in English, yet I am sure their sense is no way injured, and I have chosen to
allege Doctor Whites authority, because he is an Orthodox professor of the
Protestant Church; the reflection of the state of this question wherein I found
the Protestants defend themselves only by flying out of sight, by confessing a
long invisibility in their Church in appearance of Pastors and Doctors, left me
much loosened from the fastness of my professed Religion, but had not yet
transported me to the Catholic Church; for I had an opinion that our Divines
might yet fill up this vacuitie with some more substantial matter then I could
meet with, so I came back into England, with a purpose of seeking nothing so
intentively as this satisfaction, and to this purpose, I did covertly (under
another man's name) send this my scruple to one in whose learning and
sufficiency I had much affiance, in these terms, Whether there was no visible
succession to be proved in the Protestant Church since the Apostles time down
to Luther, and what was to be answered to that objection? Besides the
confession of invisibilitie for so many ages; to this I could get no other
answer, but that the point had been largely, and learnedly handled by Doctor
White, and many others of our Church: upon this I resolved to inform my self
in some other points which seemed to me unwarrantable and superstitious in the
Ceremonies of the Church of Rome, since I had such an inducement, and so little
satisfaction in a point which seemed to me so essential, and in all these
scruples I found mine own mistake in the belief of the Tenets of the Roman
Church gave me the only occasion of scandal, not the practice of their
doctrine, and to confirm me in the satisfaction of all them, I found the
practice and authority of most of the ancient Fathers, and in the Protestant
Refutation of these Doctrines, the Recusation of their Authorities, as men that
might err, so that the question seemed then to me whether I would rather
hazard the erring with them, then with the later Reformers which consequently
might err also in dissenting from them; since then my resolution of
reconciling my self to the Roman Church is not liable to any suspicion of too
forward or precipitate resignation of my self, my judgment may perchance be
censured of seducement, my affection cannot be of corruption.

Upon these Reasons I did soon after my return last into England, reconcile
my self to the Roman Catholic Church, in the belief and convincement of it to
be the true, ancient, and Apostolical Church, by her external marks, and her
internal objects of faith and doctrine, and in her I resolve to live and die,
as the best way to salvation; when I was in England, I did not study
dissimulation so dexterously as if my fortune had read it to me, nor do I now
profess it so desperately as if it were my fortunes Legacy, for I do not
believe it so dangerous, but it may recover, for I know the Kings wisdom is
rightly informed that the Catholic Faith does not tend to the alienation of
the subject, it rather super-infuseth a reverence and obedience to Monarchy,
and strengthens the bands of our obedience to our natural Prince, and his
grace and goodness shall never find any other occasion of diversion of them,
from the natural and usual exercise of themselves upon those that have had
the honor to have been bred with approbation of fidelity in his service, nor
can I fear that your Lordship should apprehend any change in my duty, even
your displeasure (which I may apprehend upon this mis-interpreted occasion)
shall never give me any of the least recession from my duty, in which
profession I humbly ask your blessing as

Your Lordships obedient Son, W. Mountagu.

The Answer.
Walter,
YOur Letter sent from Paris tells me how much debate you had with your self,
whether with silence to suspend my belief, or by a clear profession to assure
me what you feared to present me; but what was most satisfactory to the first
duty to GOD, that you thought most justifiable to your derivative duty to
nature, therefore resolved to give me an ingenuous account of the declaration
you had made then: had you asked my counsel, before you signified the
resolution, it would have showed more duty in you, and bred less discontent
in me; but think how welcome that Letter could be, that at once tells of the
intention, and signifies the resolution.

Say you could not expect from me so much Theological Learning as to satisfy
your scruples, yet it had been a fair address, of a son to a Father in a
matter of that importance; nor are you ignorant of my care, I dare say
knowledge studied, for the settlement of my children in that true faith which
their father professed, and the Church of England has established: Therefore
it would have been your greater justification, and my less sorrow, so to have
lost your self with love, that I could not have held you in with religious
reason. Happily you will return upon me the misconstruction of that speech, If
any man come to me, and hate not his father, he cannot be my Disciple. But I
must tell you that by this post-dated duty you have trespassed upon loves duty,
for you have robbed me of the means of helping you with mine advise; which as
it is the best part of a fathers portion to give, so it is not the least
testimony of filial duty to ask.

Now to lay such a blemish upon all the cares of your former education, as not
to think me worthy to see the aim, until you have set up your rest, is such
a neglect that without overmuch fatherly candor cannot be forced into an
excusable interpretation: It makes me suspect that some politic respects or
private seducements, if not discontentments, have wrought upon you.

Policy and Religion as they do well together, so do they as ill asunder, the
one being too cunning to be good; the other being too simple to be safe: But
upon policy to change Religion, there is no warrant for that, less for
discontentments, or upon seducements.

When I look upon your Letter, which you termed an ingenuous account of your
self, it seems to me not an account of your new professed Religion, but
rather an exprobration of mine, and so of ours of the Church of England.

Had I known the doubts before, I might have been an adviser, but objecting
them after you had resolved, you call me up now to be a Disputer: although I
be of his opinion, who thought that truth did oftentimes suffer by too much
altercation, it being a common error amongst great Clerks, to contend more for
victory, than for verity: yet since you have so punctually led me into it,
though it be contrary to my first resolution of silence (else you had heard
from me sooner) and finding that the Letter you sent me had a farther reach
then to give me satisfaction, (else the copies of it would have not been
divulged before I came to receive it, and uses made of it to my discomfort) I
therefore thought my self tied to give you an answer, lest those of your new
profession should think (as some of them say) that a new lapsorian, was more
able by a few days discipline to oppose our Religion, then an old Father and
long professor was able to defend it.

Having this tie upon me, I hope, on the one side, our learned Divines will
pardon me, if for my sons sake I dip my pen in their ink; and you on the
other side will lay mine arguments more to heart, as proceeding from the bowels
of a Father, then if they had been framed by the brains of a learned Divine.

In this case also I have some advantage of other men, who though they might
write more learnedly, yet cannot do it so feelingly: for mine interest is not
only in the cause, but in the person, for whom I might give an account, if
there be failing in my part to reduce him to truth: A person whose Letter I
take into mine hands, as he did the Urne of his sons ashes to shed over it
veras lachrymas, as arguments of the truth, both which I hope shall persuade
forceably, if there be any of that blood left in you that I gave you, It is
true, affection is not to rule Religion: yet in this way nature may cooperate
with grace.

Your Letter says truly, the greatest part of your life capable of
distinctions of Religions has been in places, and conversant with persons
opposite to the faith I bred you in, therefore you say, it had been strange if
natural curiosity without any spiritual provocation had not invited you with
desire of looking upon the foundation I trod on, rather then holding fast
blindfold by your education to be always carried away after it.

In your education, God knows my first care was to season you with true
Religion, wherein from a boy you attained unto such knowledge as Spain will
witness, (when you were but a youth) how strong a champion you were for the
Protestant profession. The Court of France, nor yet all the Princes Courts of
Christendom (most of which you have visited) could never till now taint your
faith, but always rendered you sound in the Religion which you carried with you
hence.

But now Italy has turned you, because England has discontented you.

In the last journey into Italy, as you said, you applied all your leisure to
confirm your judgment in the doctrine introduced by your education, which if
you had done seriously, you could not so soon, nor would not at all, upon so
weak motives, have let go your hold; for of all other their tenants the two
you mentioned are the weakest, and have received cleerest satisfaction: whereby
it appears, that you were resolved to give up the cause, before you came at
it; and what you would not hold blindfold, to give up blindfold which is
worst.

Could that be a motive to your desertion of our Church, as persuaded that
Luther was the Father of our faith? your self cannot forget, but how that we
build our faith upon Christ, not upon Luther, upon the doctrine of the
Scriptures, not upon the inventions of men; Could it be proved against us that
Luther or any other man how gray headed soever were the inventor of our faith,
there needed no more to be said, we would contend no longer.

But we renounce all men alike as inventors of Religion, or any part of it,
but hold only the Apostolical doctrine, of the ancient Primitive and Catholic
Church, and presume not to coin any new Creed.

Yet we are not unwilling to grant that Luther was one, but not the first of
many that restored the purity of the doctrine, which had been long smothered by
the Papacy; our faith if you take in the whole is no other but what is
exiconized in the Apostles Creed, included in the Scriptures: If you take it in
a lower and straighter way, for so much of it as is opposed to the corruption
of popery, you must remember that these points are neither the whole nor
greatest points of faith, there are not any points of our faith, but we are
able to show they had mayntainers few or many in all ages since the Apostles
time; and every of these ages, those substructures of Popery opposed, some by
one man, some by an other.

I wonder therefore to see you carried away with that common and trivial
calumny, that Luther was the inventor of our faith; and why say you that for
the intervall of 800 years before there was no apparent profession of faith
different from Rome? and this you collect by historical search of all the
stories and Records Ecclesiastical and Civil.

It seems Italy affords you no coppies of our Writers, else might you see in
them a list which they carry out through all these spaces, and show you, that
most of our tenants have had the suffrage of the learn'dst of Romes side, and
how many men in the decursion of time, from the ancientest of Fathers, have
declared themselves, and some of them apparently, ye earnestly contended for
the truth of our doctrine.

And where you object that Waldo, Wickliff, and Hus, had scarce any relation to
the professed Protestancie, if you mean because we disclaim those horrid
opinions which are put upon them (how true God knows) therein you say truly,
Neither they to us, nor we to them have any relation: but in the main points of
doctrine touching faith and opposition of the superstitions and usurpation of
the papacy, we have a joint consent of all the best Writers, Historians, and
Divines, of both sides, that they and we consent in one.

It is strange therefore to say, that these and we had no relation to the
Protestant profession, who for substance of Religion held as we do, their
errors only we own not: and the consent of times do all agree, that the
Waldenses flew out against their corruptions 400 years before Luther was
borne, nay, says Renerus, Quidam dicunt quod secta illa duraverie a tempore
Silvestri, alii quod a tempore Apostolorum, deriving their fundamental
doctrine from the time of the Apostles: nor were they few, sed multiplicati
super arenas maris; nor plebeians only, sed principum favore armati, As the
Kings of Arragon, the Earls of Toulouse, and many more. So that, there are
witnesses more then sufficient, that there were many who opposed themselves to
the Papacy in the Protestants tenants long before Luther. This is the first
supposition failing, I will now let you see the mistakes in the subsequent
passages, and open to you my self, hoping yet that I may draw you again to me.

You as you conceive having showed a defect of visibilitie in our Church till
Luthers time, labor to prove a necessity of visibilitie to every true Church:
if it were granted that it were simply necessary to the essentiating of a
Church to be able to demonstrate in all times, both the visible number of
professors of the truth, as also a visible succession of Pastors, we are able
to demonstrate both these for our defense to be as unquestionable in our
Church as in the Church of Rome: they that are otherwise minded will account
this a bold undertaking, but it is no hard matter to do: Wherefore the vanity
of that question, to ask, where our Church was before Luther, becomes not any
man that has read any thing of our Church monuments.

But you would seem to me to prove it two ways; first, by the testimony of
our own Divines; Secondly, by argument.

By testimonies of our Divines you would have Doctor Field, Doctor White, and
Master Hooks, to confess needfulnesse of visibilitie: and yet for their own
Church fly to latencie.

For the second you instance Doctor Whitaker, and Doctor White, one of them, to
confess our Church for many ages to have been in a secret solitude; and the
other to let go his defense of visible succession by flying to an invisible
subterfuge of non-apparency: if you had better perused the truth of those
Writers, they would have given you full satisfaction, but you mistake both the
persons and the points.

These made a demonstration of those 3 points: First, that neither the Churches
obscurity is repugnant to the visibilitie of it: Secondly, nor the visibility
of it such as excludes all latencie: Nor yet the latencie of Orthodox
Christians in the swaying time of Popery, such as had not requisite lineaments
of an accomptable visibilitie.

But you must know that visibilitie does not always carry the same height,
but admits of degrees, so that we cannot say, that that wants visibilitie
which has it in a lower degree. The Sun compared with it self is in a degree
visible, though in a mist, yet not so clearly visible as when it shines out: so
it is with the state of the Church, because her splendor is not in termino,
but such as receives degrees by augmentation or diminution; like as the Sun is
as truly visible under a cloud as in his brightness, though not so clearly
visible; though not to admit the Church to be visible, except she be glorious,
is an error; for there is a variation of the Churches visibilitie in respect of
her object: the want of which consideration, I believe is one cause why so many
deceive themselves in this point. secondly, there is another diversity, which
arises from the visible object, some may see and will not, there the fault is
not in the object, but in the beholders. Philosophers say, Visibilia non sunt
minus visibilia cum non videntur, quam quando videntur, The objects of sight
remain still discernable, when they are not discerned: so it is with the
Church, there are strictures of visibility discernable in her obscure
condition, but it is possibile non visum, which falls out when men will not open
their eyes, or they shut them on purpose, which happened in the prevailing times
of popery, when this notwithstanding, yet there were lights which appeared by
the defense of the truth, and the discovery of error, in every age of the
intervall.

But sure our men labor in vain to demonstrate that visibilitie, whilst they
of the Papacy are so disaffected, as not to acknowledge it upon any terms,
otherwise this controversy had long since been ended, if they had been as well
disposed to see, as we ready to show our visibility: in this question men are
to consider that there is a double splendour of the Church, which makes way for
the visibilitie of it.

The proper splendor of a Church consists in purity of doctrine.

The common splendor of a Church consists in the outward accommodations which
appertain not to the being, but the well being of the Church, as temporal
peace, multitude of professors, local succession of Pastors; yet persecution
may interrupt this succession of Pastors, it may cut off the multitude of
professors, heresy may so far prevail as to make the Orthodox Church pull in
her head, witness the time of Arianisme, when few but godly Athanasius, and
some with him were feign to keep in corners, and of this our Divines are to be
understood when they speak of our latencie, that for this outward splendor it
suffered a great obscurity, for diverse hundred years, yet when it was at the
lowest, the doctrine was visible, and some professors still in the eye of the
World, I would wish you well to consider the things which I shall tell you.

The state of the Church is so ordered by our great Master Christ, that she is
to expect her times of obscurity, as well as her times of splendour, he has
made her estate militant, and appointed her to a passive condition, as well as
an active: designed her to vicissitudes of obscurity, as well as luster, and
shows her no less glorious in her obscurity then in her triumph, as Tertullian
says of virtue. Extruitur duritia: destruitur mollitia.


2 This visibilitie represented by an innumerous multitude, local Succession,
Secular estate, these were not considered in the first times, when the Church
stood sound, nor in the later times, when she got some recovery, only in the
intermediate, when she lay under the cross; and were these the probats of
Faith, it had bin ill with the Israelites Church in the time of Elias, worse
with the Apostolical Church, when the Scribes and Pharisees sat in Moses
Chair, worst in the time of Arianisme, and in times of Antichristianisme,
which shall come as most Writers say.

3 This glorious succession which Rome so much brags of is a deceitful medium
whereby to measure the truth of a Church, because a Church may be a true Church
without it: and be also a false Church with it.

Non colligitur ibi necessario esse Ecclesiam ubi est successio, says
Bellarmine, though Stapleton be of another mind: Alexandria challenges
succession, as well as Rome, the Church of Constantinople takes her pedigree
from Saint Andrew the Apostle, and brings it down to our times.

A false Church may have succession, and a true Church may want it, otherwise
you will grant that Rome is no true Church: the Church of Rome has sometimes
lain empty; sometimes it has carried double, and both of them have bin
deposed, these broken links mar the chain of that succession. But because
this rather concerns the persons not the thing, It is otherwise to be clearly
showed, that it may be a true Church that has not this uninterrupted
succession: for else no Church at all could be true in her first plantation.
For successions are by descent, descents have no place in first originals,
whereas the orthodox faith does the very first day put her in possession of
Apostolical succession, as Tertullian well says, That Churches which have not
their original descent from the Apostles are Apostolical, propter
consanguinitatem doctrinae.

The place which you cite out of the fourth to the Ephesians proves clearly the
necessity of orthodox Pastors, not of local Succession, you may hereby see how
in the informing of your self in this particular you are overtaken; this thing
also much troubles me, that your Letters said, that when you last came back out
of Italy, you sought nothing so attentively as satisfaction in these points of
controversy, especially that touching the visibilitie of our Church in all
ages, but could receive none.

Could you never in all the while of your last being in England find the time
to acquaint me with your desire? doubtless, I must say, you did in this time
study the dissimulation of your intention, otherwise I must have known it.

I was heretofore more indulgent toward you, for God knows it Walter, the
son of my body was never so dear unto me, as the salvation of my son
Walters soul, your younger years can witness how I showed you the way which I
my self took to settle mine own salvation: for though it was my happiness to
be derived from virtuous and religious parents; yet I took not my Religion
merely by descent, but studied and examined the ground on which I was to found
my faith; I read both Papists and Protestants, I found both confident, and
contradictory.

Et quoties palpitavit mihi tremulum cor, before I settled either way? sometimes
thinking safest to mean well, and to keep unsettled either way, yet I saw a
necessity laid on me, to be one of the two Churches, but how to find out which
of them was the true Church, whereof I must be a member if I would secure my
salvation, hic labor hoc opus est: I easily resolved there was not two Churches
whereof a man might choose which to be of, and after long study I found clearly
that to be the true Church, which constantly held the common faith, which faith
had the Scripture for the rule, this known and resolved, which is undoubted,
then I was not scared with that fearful censure of the Roman Church, which
pronounced all damned that are not of that Church.

But how much am I distasted to find several arguments made in the Letter,
all to insinuate that the Scriptures are not a competent rule of faith? and
first, variety of interpretation, secondly, obscurity of some places,
thirdly, inauthentiquences of themselves, fourthly, their authority dependent
on the Church, fifthly, the purity of them warranted by the visibility of the
Church, sixthly, made Authentike by the Churches authority: strange assertions,
as if the true Church were not to be tried by the true faith, but the true
faith by the Church. I know my self bound to believe the authority of that
Church which makes Scripture the rule of faith; but as for the act of any
Church, though it be a fit Ministry to show me the way, yet it is not of
authority sufficient of it self to secure me of my salvation; from true faith
the true Church is inferred, and which is the true Church when all is done must
be tried by the Scripture: but it is now with us, as it was in the time of
Chrysostom, when there was so much question, which was the true Church, and
men were of so many different opinions about it as none could tell what Church
to be of, or what Religion was safest to trust to, so says the Father of the
Scriptures, which in matters of faith necessary to salvation speak so truly, so
fully, so plainly, as it is but a shift for a man to say, he understands them
not; and good Saint Austin finding that from controversies in Religion, there
came no other fruit, but indeterminata luctatio, said with sorrow, Why do we
strive about our Fathers Will? Nos fuimus fratres, and our Father is not dead
intestate, but has left his Will and Testament in writing: let it be followed
and all controversies will soon be ended. Flatter not your self Walter, the
Remonstrance you make shows that the resignation you made of your self to the
church of Rome was precipitate, then the resolution to live and die there
desperate, yet you give some hopes when you say, nor do you now so desperately
profess, as if it were your fortunes legacy, for you do not believe it so
dangerous but it may recover.

The Kings benignity and goodness is always to interpret the best, but know
that his Majesty has a better opinion of those who are bred such, then of
those who become such by relapse; nor am I willing to apprehend any change of
your duty, yet take this for a caveat, that commonly all changes follow change
of faith. I never traveled of you till now, and it is with a great deal of
pain, I thought you should have wept over me, when Nature had called for her
due, but you have prevented me, And yet my son you may yet return to me, but
I shall never go to you in this way, nor had I ever gone so far into this
question, but to fetch you again my son otherwise a lost child.

Thus as your Letter began so do I end, after much debate concerning a fit
expression of my self, whether was better by not writing to show my dislike,
or by long writing to labor your recovery; this last was most satisfactory to
my conscience, though the other more agreeable to nature displeased; I have
therefore resolved as you see to give you this answer, and I pray God that he
may bless you and me so in it, that my pen may have the fruit my heart wishes.

Your Loving Father, Manchester.

My Lord Faulklands Answer.
A Letter of Master Mountagu, justifying his change of Religion, being
dispersed in many copies, I was desired to give my opinion of the Reasons, and
my reason if I misliked them; having read and considered it, I was brought to
be persuaded, First, because having been sometimes in some degrees moved with
the same inducements, I thought that what satisfied me might possibly have the
same effect upon him: Secondly, because I being a Layman, a youngman, and an
ignorant man, I thought a little reason might in likelihood work more from my
pen, then more from theirs, whose profession, age, and studies might make him
suspect that it is they are too hard for him, and not their cause for his:
Thirdly, because I was very desirous to do him service, not only as a man,
and a Christian, but as one whom all that know him inwardly esteem of great
parts (and I am desirous somewhat to make up my great want of them by my
respects to those that have them) and as an impartial seeker of Truth which I
trust he is, and I profess my self to be; and so much for the cause of this
paper: I come now to that which it opposes.

First then, whereas he defends his search, I suppose he is rather for that to
receive praise, then to make apologies, all men having cause to suspect that
gold which were given with this condition, that the Receiver should not try it
by any touchstone.

Secondly, He says, that there being two sorts of questions, the one of right
or doctrine, the other of fact or story, as whether the Protestants faith had a
visible appearance before Luther, he resolved to begin his enquiry with the
matter of fact, as being sooner to be found (because but one) and easier to be
comprehended: to this I answer by saying, that if they would not appeal from
the right Tribunal, or rather rule, which is the Scripture, those many might
easier be ended then this one (we building our faith only upon plain places,
and all reasonable men being sufficient judges of what is plain) but if they
appeal to a consent of Fathers, or Councels, whereof many are lost, many, not
lost, not to be gotten, many uncertain whether Fathers or no Fathers, and
those which we have being too many for almost any industry to read over, and
absolutely for any memory to remember, which yet is necessary (because any one
clause of any one Father destroys a consent) and being besides liable to all
the exceptions which can be brought against the Scriptures being the rule, as
difficulty, want of an infallible interpreter, and such like, and being denied
to have any infallibility (especially when they speak as witnesses, which a
consent of them never does against us) by one party, which the Scripture is
allowed to have by both, then I wonder not if he think such a way so uncertain,
and so long, that he was willing to choose any shorter cut rather then travel
it. Neither do I believe this to be so short, or so concluding as he imagines,
for if he consider the large extent of Christian Religion, so that we know
little from any indifferent Relator of the opinions of the Abissines, so great
a part of Christendom, if he consider the great industry of his church in
extinguishing those whom they have called Heretics, and also their Books, so
that we know scarce any thing of any of them but from themselves (who are too
partial to make good Historians) if he consider how carefully they stop men's
mouths (even those of their own) with their Indices Expurgatorii, it will then
appear to him both a long work to seek, and a hard one to find, whether any
thought like Luther in all ages, and that he concludes very rashly who
resolves there was none because he cannot find any, since they might have bin
visible in their time, and yet not so to us (for men are not the less visible
when they are so, for not being after remembered) as a man may be a Gentleman,
though he know not his pedidigree: so that as I will not affirm that there were
always such, because I cannot prove it, so neither ought they to make
themselves sure there were none without they could prove that which is
impossible, and therefore no argument can be drawn from thence: and if it could
be proved that such a no-wayes erring church must at all times be, I had rather
believe that there were still such, though we know them not, which may be
true, then that theirs is it, which in my opinion cannot.

Thirdly, He says, he could find no one point of controverted doctrine,
whereupon all the rest depended, but that this one question of fact was such as
the decision of it determined all the rest. To this I answer, that the question
of the infallibility of the Pope, at least of those who adhere to him, which
they call the church is such a one as if determined must determine all the
rest, and not only so to us but to all men; whereas this (though granted
necessary, and determined to his wish) would indeed conclude against us, but
not for them, since the Greek Church would put in as good plea upon the title
of visibilitie as that of Rome, and he would be to begin anew with them, when
he had ended with us.

Fourthly, He gives his reason. If Luther could be evicted to be the Innovator,
his Religion was then evicted of not being the true Ancient and Apostolical;
To this I answer, by confessing the consequence, but he might be the
Renovator, and not the Innovator, and then no such consequence follows.

Fifthly, He says, we are bound to find an existence of some Professors of the
Reformed Religion before Luther, which requiry is grounded upon his supposition
of the necessity of a continual succession of a visible and no ways erroneous
Church. Now I will first examine the sense of his terms: By the first I
conceive by a place he cites out of Saint Augustine, that he means visible to
all Nations, but I pray has his been always so, I mean (at least for many
Centuries) to those Nations which Columbus has not long since discovered? By
the second term Church, I suppose he means a company of Christians holding
neither more or less then Christ taught (for in a more large sense no man
denies the Church to have bin always in some degrees visible) and in this sense
I not only deny it necessary, that it should always be visible, but that it
should always be, for I doubt whether there be, or for a long while have bin
any such. Next that such a one as he means appears, because when catalogues
have been brought of some who in all ages have differed from them in things
which we hold, his side would not accept of them, because they agreed not with
us in all things, and yet when Campian intends to prove all the Fathers to be
his, he uses only this course of instancing in some wherein they agree with
him (though sometimes not so much, but rather the contrary ought to be
inferred, as in the instance of Polycarpus, for comparing his words with the
History it will appear that he concluded him a Papist for not being persuaded
by the Pope) though they differed from them in many other, as indeed all the
notable Fathers do in more then one point. I will therefore say, that if this
be required to showing that a Church has been ever visible, it is more then
either part can do, and therefore I hope they will come upon better
consideration, to confess that not necessary for us to do, which is
impossible for themselves: For let any man look into Antiquity, I will not say
without all prejudice, but without an absolute Resolution of seeing nothing in
it that contradicts his present belief, and if he find not some opinions of
the Church of Rome, as unknown to Antiquity, as either he or I, as the Popes
Indulgenges having power to deliver out of Purgatory (confessed by Bishop Fisher,
and Alphonsus de Castro, where they treat of Indulgences) if he find not
others at first unknown after known, but not held de fide, which are yet so at
Rome, as prayer to Saints, their enjoying the beatificall vision before the day
of Judgment, the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, and her being free from all
actual sin; If he find not some wholly unknown and absolutely condemned
which we condemn, as the lawfulness of picturing of God the Father, whereof
the first is confessed by Baronius in the margent, to an Epistle of a Pope, which
says the same, and the latter is to be found in Tom. 9. An 72. De fide and
(...). 2. lib. 2. c.
many places of Saint Austine, Lactantius, and others; nay, if he find not that
all the Doctors, Saints, and Martyrs of the two first ages (I mean as many as
are now extant, and speak of it) held something which both parties condemned,
as the opinion of the Chiliasts, if I say he find not this, or I show him not
that he might have found it, I profess I will be ready to spend my life for
the Church against which I now employ my pen: So that this will be the end,
neither of our Churches have been always visible, only this is the difference,
that we are troubled to show our Church in the latter and more corrupt ages,
and they theirs in the first and purest, that we can least find ours at
night, and they theirs at noon: And whereas he expects that D. White should
stand to this to confess his Religion false if a continual descent of it could
not be demonstrated, if he himself please to grant as much as he exacts, if
he but continue in this Resolution, and in this search, I doubt no more but
that he will soon leave to be a Papist, then I should doubt if I saw him now
receiving the Communion in the Kings Chapel, that he had done it already.

Sixthly, his reason for the necessity of the visibility follows, because the
contrary were a derogation from Gods power or providence, I answer, to say he
could not keep the truth exactly in men's belief, were to derogate from Gods
power, to say he had not given sufficient means to find the truth, and yet
damned men for error, the first would be a derogation from his providence, the
second from his Justice, but to say he suffers men to err who neglect the
means of not erring, and that he damnes none for a mere error, in which the
will has no part, and consequently the man no fault, derogates from none of
the three, but says he, this is repugnant to the maine reason why God has a
Church upon earth to be the conserver of the doctrine of Christ, and to convey
it from age to age, I answer to conserve it is every man's duty, but such as
they may all fail in, and is indeed rather the form of the Church then the end
of the Church, an exact conservation making an exact Church, as a less perfect
conserving a less perfect Church. As for conveyance of doctrine, the whole
Church conveyes none, whereof many (if his be it) have had but little conveyed
to them. Particular Christians (especially Pastors) teach others which it is
every man's duty to do when he meets with them who want instruction which he
can give, and they are likely to receive, yet is not the instruction of others
every man's main end. But I know Master Mountague persuades himself that some
body of men are appointed to convey this doctrine which men are to receive,
only because they deliver it, and this I absolutely deny, for we receive no
doctrine from the Church upon the Churches authority, because we know her not
to be the Church, till we have examined her doctrine, and so receive rather her
for it, then it for her. Neither for the conveyance of the Truth is it
necessary that any company of men in all times hold it all, because some may
convey some truths, and others other, out of which by comparing their doctrine
with the Scripture, men may draw a perfect body of Truths: and though they
delivered few other Truths, yet in delivering Scripture (wherein all necessary
Truths is containd) they deliver all, and by that rule whosoever regulates his
life and doctrine, I am confident that though he may mistake error for Truth
in the way, he shall never mistake Hell for Heaven in the end.

Seventhly, His next reason is their common Achilles, the fourth of the
Ephesians, which he chooses only to employ like his Triarios, his mayn
battle, leaving his Velites, his light armed Soldiers, some places too
allegorical, even in his own opinion, to stand examination. The words are
these. He has given some Prophets, some Apostles, some Evangelists, some
Pastors, and some Doctors, for the instauration of the Saints, for the work of
the Ministry, for the edification of the body of Christ, till we all meet in
the unity of Faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man,
and unto the measure of the age of the fullness of Christ, That we may be no
more children tossed and carried away with every wind of doctrine, etc. Verse
11, 12, 13. Now out of this place I see not how a succession may be evinced,
rather I think it may that the Apostle meant none: For first, he says, not
he will give, but he has given, and who could suppose that the Apostle could
say that Christ had given then the present Pope, and the Doctors who now adhere
to him; Secondly, allow that by he has given, were meant, he has promised
(which would be a gloss not much unlike to that which one of the most witty
and most eloquent of our modern Divines Doctor Dun notes of Statuimus i.
Abrogamus) yet since these several Nowns are all governed by the same Verb,
and no distinction put, it would prove as well a necessity of a continual
succession of Apostles, Prophets and Evangelists, as of Pastors, and Doctors,
which is more then either they can show or pretend they can, so that it seems
to me to follow that these were then given to do this, till then, and not a
succession of them promised till then, to do this; and so we receiving and
retaining the Scriptures, wherein what they taught is contained (as we would
any thing else, that had as general and ancient a tradition if there were any
such) need no more, for if he say that men are tossed for all the Scriptures, I
answer so are they for all these Doctors, nay, if these keep any from being
tossed, it is the Scripture which does it, upon which their authority is by them
founded upon their own interpretation, and reason, who yet will not give us
leave to build any thing upon ours out of plainer places, and though they tell
us that we cannot know the Scripture, but from the Church, they are yet fain
(as appears) to prove the Authority of the Church out of Scripture, which
makes me ask them in the words of their own Campian, and with much more
cause, Nihilne pudet Labyrinthi?

Eigthly, there follows an other reason to this sense, that Reason not being
able to show away to eternal happiness, and without such an one man would
fail of the end to which he was ordained, it must be proposed by an infallible
authority, in so plain a manner as even the simple might be capable of it,
which being performed by our Savior, it must be convai'd to succeeding ages by
those who heard it from him, and whenever this thread failed mankind was left
without a guide to inevitable ruin; I answer, that though all this be
granted, it proves not against us, for we have the Scripture come down to us
relating Christ's Doctrine, and written by those that heard it, and which the
simple are capable of understanding (I mean as much as is plain, and more is
not necessary, since other Questions may as well be suffered without harm as
those between the Jesuits and Dominicans about Predetermination, and between
the Dominicans, and almost all the rest about the Immacultate conception) and
those who are not neither are they capable out of Scripture to discern the
true Church; Much less by any of these notes, which require much understanding
and large learning, as conformity with the Ancients, and such like.

Ninthly, the same answer I give to this serves also to the following words of
Saint Austin, for whereas Master Mountague concludes, that he could not mean
the Scriptures as a competent rule to mankind, which consists most of simple
persons, because there has been continual altercations about the sense of
important places, I answer that I may as well conclude by the same Logic,
that neither is the Church a competent guide, because in all ages there have
also been disputes, not only about her authority but even which was she, and
to whatsoever reason he imputes this, to the same may we the other, as to
negligence, pride, prejudication and the like; and if he please to search, I
verily believe he will find that the Scriptures are both easier to be known
then the Church, and that it is as easy to know what these teach as when that
has defined, since they hold no Decrees binding de fide without a confirmation
of the popes, who can never be known infallibly to be a Pope, because a
secret simony makes him none, no not to be a Christian, because want of due
intention in the Baptizer makes him none, whereof the latter is always
possible, and the first in some ages likely, and in hard Questions, a
readiness to yield to the Scriptures when they shall be explan'd me thinks
should serve, as well as a readiness to assent to the decrees of the Church
when those shall be pronounced.

Tenthly, He says the Scripture must be kept safe in some hands, whose
authority must beget our acceptance of them, which being no other then the
Church of all ages, we have no more reason to believe that it has preserved
that free from corruption then its self in a continual visibility: I answer
that neither to giving authority to Scripture nor to the keeping of them is
required a continual visibility of a no ways erring body of Christians, the
writers of them give them their authority amongst Christians, nor can the
Church move any other, and that they were the writers of them, we receive from
the general Tradition, and testimony of the first Christians, not from any
following Church, who could know nothing of it but from them (for for those
parts which were then doubted of by such as were not condemned for it by the
rest why may not we remayn in the same suspense of them that they did) and for
their being kept and conveyed this was not done only by their Church, but by
the Greeks, and there is no reason to say that to the keeping, and transmitting
of Records safely it is required to understand them perfectly, since the old
Testament was kept and transmitted by the Jews, who yet were so capable of
erring, that out of it they looked for a temporal King, when it spoke of a
spiritual: and me thinks the testimony is greater of a church that contradicts
the Scripture then which does not, since no man's witnessing is so soon to be
taken as when against himself, and so their testimony is greater of a Church
that contradicts the Scripture by which themselves are condemned: Besides the
general reverence which ever has bin given to the Books, and the continual
use of them (together with several parties having always their eyes upon each
other ready and desirous to have somewhat to accuse in their Adversaries) gives
us greater certainty that these are the same writings, then we have that any
other ancient Book is any other ancient Authors, and we need not to have any
other unerring company preserved to make us surer of it: yet the Church of Rome
as infallible a Depositarie as she is, has suffered some varieties to creep
into the Copies in some less material things, nay and some whole Books (as
they themselves say) to be lost, and if they say how then can that be the rule
whereof part is lost, I answer, that we are excused if we walk by all the rule
that we have, and this makes much against Traditions being the rule, since the
Church has not looked better to Gods unwritten word then to his written, and if
she pretend she has, let her tell us the cause why Antichrists coming was
deferred, which was a Tradition of St. Paul to the Thessalonians, and which
without impudence she cannot pretend not to have lost, and if again they say
God has preserved all necessary Traditions, I reply so has he all necessary
Scripture, for by not being preserved it became to us not necessary, since we
cannot be bound to believe and follow what we cannot find. But besides, I
believe that all which was ever necessary is contained in what remains, for
Pappias says of S. Mark, that he writ all that S. Peter preached, as Iraeneus
does that Luke writ all that S. Paul preached, nay Vincentius Lirinensis though
he would have the Scripture expounded by ancient Tradition, yet confesses
that all is there that is necessary (and yet then there was no more Scripture
then we now have) as indeed by such a Tradition as he speaks of no more can be
proved then is plainly there, and almost all Christians confent in, and truly I
wonder that they should brag so much of that Author, since both in this and
other things he makes much against them, especially in not sending men to the
present Roman Church, a much readier way (if he had known it) then such a long
and doubtful one as he prescribes, which indeed it is impossible that almost
any question should be ended by.

Eleventhly, He brings S. Austines authority to prove, that the true Church
must be always visible; but if he understood Church in Master Mountagu's
sense, I think he was deceived. Neither is this impudence for me to say, since
I have cause to think it but his particular opinion, by his saying (which Card.
Perr. quotes) that before the Donatists the question of the Church had never
been exactly disputed of, and by this being one of his maine grounds against
them, and yet claiming no Tradition, but only places of Scripture most of them
allegorical, and if it were no more, then I may better dissent from it, then
he from all the first Fathers, (for Dionisius Areopagita was not as yet hatched)
in the point of the Chiliasts, though some of them (Pappias and Iraeneus)
claimed a direct Tradition, and Christ's own words. Secondly, as he uses this
kind of liberty, so he professes it in his 19 Epistle, where he says, that to
Canonical Scriptures he had only learnt to give that reverence, as not to
doubt of what they said, because they said it, and from all others he expected
proof from Scriptures, or reason. Thirdly, the Church of Rome condemns
several opinions of him, and therefore she ought not to find fault with them
who imitate her examples.

Twelfthly, He adds two reasons more, the consent of the Fathers of all ages,
and the confession of Protestants: To the first I answer, that I know not of
any such, and am the more unapt to believe it, because M. Mountague vouchsafes
not to insist upon it, nor to quote any, which I guess he would have done, but
that he misdoubted their strength. Secondly, suppose that all the Fathers
which speak of this did say so, yet if they say it, as private Doctors, and
claim no Tradition for it, I know not why they should weigh more then so many
of the now-learned, who having more help from Art, and no fewer from Nature,
are not worse searchers into what is truth, though less capable of being
witnesses to what was tradition. Thirdly, they themselves often profess they
expect not to be read as Judges, but as to be judged, by their and our rule,
the Canonical Scriptures. Fourthly, Let him please to read about the imaculate
conception Posa, Salmeron, and Wadding, and he will find me as submissive to
antiquity, even whilst I reject it, as those of his own Party, for they to
prefer new opinions before old, are feign to prefer new Doctors before old,
and to confess the latter more perspicacious, and to differ from those of
former times, with as little scruple as he would from Calvin (whom Maldonat on
purpose to oppose confesses he chooses a new Interpretation before that of all
In 6 cap. Ioh.
the Ancients, which no witness but my eyes could have made me believe) nay,
and produce other points wherein their Church has decreed against the Fathers,
to persuade her to do so again, although Campian with an eloquent brag would
persuade us that they are all as much for him as Greg. the 13, who was then
Pope. To the second I answer, that infallibility is not by us denied to the
Church of Rome, with an intention of allowing it to particular Protestants, how
wise and learned soever.

Thirteenthly, He says next, that he after informed himself in other points
which seemed to him unwarrantable, and superstitious, and found only his own
mistakes gave him occasion of scandal; to this I answer that I cannot well
answer any thing, unless he had specified the points, but I can say that there
are many, as picturing God the Father (which is generally thought lawful, and
as generally practiced) their offerings to the Virgin Mary (which only differs
from the heresy of the Colliridians in that a candle is not a cake) their
praying to Saints, and believing de fide that they hear us, though noway made
certain that they do so, and many more which without any mistake of his might
have given him occasion to be still scandalized; for whereas he says that
these points were grounded upon the authority of the ancient Fathers, which was
refused as insufficient by Protestants, I answer, that none of these I name
have any ground in the Ancientest, nay, the first is by them disallowed, and if
any other superstition of theirs have from them any ground, yet they who depart
from so many of the Ancients in several opinions cannot by any reason be
excused for retaining any error, because therein they have consent, nor have
the Protestants cause to receive it from them, as a sufficient Apology,
neither has he to follow the Fathers rather then Protestants, in a case in
which not the persons, but the reasons were to be considered: For when Saint
Hierome was by this way both brought into, and held in a strange error, though
he spoke something like Master Mountagues patiaris me errare cum talibus,
suffer me to err with such men, yet he could not obtain Saint Augustines
leave, who would not suffer him, but answered their reasons, and neglected
their authorities.

Fourteenthly, He speaks of his Religion super-infusing loyalty, and if he had
only said it destroyed, or weakened it not, I (who wish that no doubt of his
allegiance may once enter his mind to whom we all owe it, but profess my
self his humble servant, and no ways his enemy though his adversary) would
then have made no answer, but since he speaks as if Popery were the way to
obedience, I cannot but say, that though no tenet of their whole Church (which
I know) makes at all against it, yet there are prevailing opinions of that
side, which are not fit to make good subjects, when their King and they are of
different persuasions. For besides that Cardinal D'Ossat (an Author which I
know Master Mountague has read, because whosoever has but considered state
matters must be as well skilled in him as any Priest in his Breviary) tells us
that it is the Spaniards maxim, that faith is not to be kept with Heretics,
and more that the Pope intimated as much in a discourse intended to persuade
the King of France to forsake the Queen of England, he says moreover speaking
in an other place about the Marquizat of Saluces, that they hold at Rome that
the Pope to avoid a probable danger of the increasing of Heresy may take away
a territory from the true owner and dispose of it to an other, and many also
defend that he has power to depose a Heretical Prince, and of Heresy he
makes himself the Judge: so that though I had rather my tongue should cleave
to the roof of my mouth, then that I should deny that a Papist may be a good
Subject, even to a King whom he counts a Heretic, since I verily believe that
I my self know very many very good, yet Popery is like to an ill air, wherein
though many keep their healths, yet many are infected (so that at most they are
good subjects but during the Popes pleasure) and the rest are in more danger
then if they were out of it.

To conclude, I believe that what I have said may at least serve (if he will
descend to consider it) to move Master Moungue to a further search, and for
Memorandums in it, which if he do, he will be soon able to give as much
better reasons for my conclusion (that such a visible Church neither need, nor
can be showed) as his understanding is degrees above mine. I hope also by
comparing the body of their belief, and the ground of their authority, that
little that can be drawn out of the fourth of the Ephesians, with the Myriads
of contradiction in Transubstantion, he will come to see that their pillars are
too weak to hold up any building be it never so light, and their building is
too heavy to be held up by any pillars be they never so strong, and trust he
will return to us whom he will then find that he has causesly left, if he
be (which I doubt not) so ingenuous, as not to hold an opinion, because he
turned to it, nor to stay, only because he went.
