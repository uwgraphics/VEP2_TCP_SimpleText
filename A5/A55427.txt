THE SALSBURY-BALLAD, With the Learned COMMENTARIES of a Friend to the Authors
Memory.

O Salsbury People, give ear to my Song,

Of your Bishop, your Church and your City.

O This seems Heathenish to pray to Hills and Parks and Rivers; but it is no
more than other Poets invoking Parnassus and Helicon; nevertheless I believe
the Poet was a good Christian, for if you read to the end of this Part, you
will find the Bishop was very much in his favor.

number of School-Mistresses in the Close, but the Poet has need of no more of

Women are wise, if not cunning. I confess some who pretend to have been
intimately acquainted with the Poet in his lifetime, are very positive, that
this name did not only point out a particular Woman, but even the Poets
Mistress; but I cannot agree to this, for had it been so, he would have given
her a more honorable Epither.

IV.
This Whereupon is a very comprehensive word, and yet seems more than it is;
one would think the Poet here makes a leap from the Foundation of Old Sarum by
the Romans to Bishop Poor's time; but it is only from Herman the first Bishop of
Salsbury, Anne 1083. to Richard Poor the seventh, 1217. This Whereupon
therefore is as much as to say, After 134 years suffering the affronts of the
Garrison, their patience was worn out, flesh and blood could endure no longer;
but Bishop Poor being a stout man went to the King.
Whereupon Bishop Poor went to the Henry III.

scope.
Who I? said the King, Where note that King had no mind to incur the Popes
displeasure. In those days he was a terrible Fellow in England.
I Will not do such a thing,
Without our old Father the Pope.
VI.
Then I Will go to that This is a very hard place, why Bishop Poor being a Papist
should call the Pope Whore? Some think the Bishop spoke it prophetically,
knowing that in the succeeding times of Calvin and the Presbyterians, he should
be proved to be the Whore. Others more acutely think this might be Pope Ioane:
But this ingenious solution is against Chronology: For Pope Ioane (if ever
there was such a one) was in the year 853. 374 years before Bishop Poor. The
best reason in my opinion is taken out of the Context, the last verse of this
Stanza, Where every thing is to be sold. Rome is a Whore, because it does
kindnesses for Money only, not for love, which is the very definition of a
Whore.
Whore, replied Bishop Poor,
With a Purse full of good old Gold;
For why should I beg and make a low leg,
Where every thing is to be sold?

Sarum's Stones, and This S. Osmund was the second Bishop of Old Sarum; he was
also Earl of Dorset and Lord Chancellor of England, he died 1099. and was
removed with great Pomp to New Sarum, where he lies buried in the middle of our

thereof may be seen in Salsbury Muniments.

meaning here.

Yet they could not agree of a place.
IX.
One time as this Prelate lay on his Down-Bed,
Recruiting his Spirits with rest,
There appeared, as it is said, a beautiful Who that Maid and Babe were, the
learned and devout understand.
Maid,
With her own dear Babe at her breast.
X.
To him thus she spoke, (the day was scarce broke,
And his eyes yet to slumber did yield)
Go build me a Church without any delay,
Go build it in Merry-field.
XI.
He awakes and he rings, up ran Monks and Friars
At the sound of his little Bell.
I must know, said he, where Merry-field is,
But the Devil a bit could they tell.
XII.
Full early he arose on a Morning gray,
To meditate and to walk;
And by chance overheard a Soldier on the Guard
As he thus to his fellow did talk.
XIII.
I will lay on the side of my good Yewen Bow,
That I shoot clean over the Corn,
As far as that Cow in Merry-field,
Which grazes under the thorn.
XIV.
Then the Bishop cried out, Where is Merry-field?
For his mind was still on his Vow.
The Soldier replied, By the Riverside,
Where you see that brindle Cow.
XV.
Upon this he declared his pious intent,
And about the Indulgences are a sort of Roman Coin the Popes use to give to
pious uses, as building of Churches, maintaining Rebellion against Protestant
Princes, etc. To which sometimes they add dead Bodies, Promises and Hopes; so
one of their own Poets: Le Cose de la guerra andavan zoppe:
I Bolognesi richiedean danari
Al Papa, ed egli respondeva coppe,
E mandava Indulgenze per gli Altari. c. 12.
And in another place:

Part' eran Ghibelline, e favorite
Da l' imperio Aleman per suo interesse.
Part' eran Guelfe, e con la Chiesa unite,
Che le pascea di speme, e di promise. c. 1.
Which last Verses may be thus translated in our Authors style and measure:

The Ghibellines.
These held that the Emperor was in the right,
The Guelfs.
Those that the Popes Cause was good.
They that were for the Popes were fed with thin hopes,
And Pardons and Chips of the Cross.
pieces of Wood.
Thus the Pope having promised twenty five thousand Crowns a Month toward
carrying on the Rebellion in Ireland, paid them in this coin, and sent by the
Irish Ambassadors, (the Bishop of Fern and Sir Nicolas Plunket) Anno 1647* from
Rome two dead Bodies, which for ought any one knew, might have been Heathens,
instead of ready money.

While the River of Avon runs down to the Sea,
And Grass grows on Salsbury Plain,
While While the English follow the French fashions. This sort of Description
is frequent both in Ancient and Modern Poets: So Virgil, Dum juga montis aper,
fluvios dum piscis amabit,
Dumque thymo pascentur apes, dum rore cicada, etc.
So Ovid,

-- Tenedos dum stabit and Ida.
Dum rapidus Simois in mare volvit aquas, etc.
So the Italian Theotritus:

Mentre per questi monti
Andran le fere errando
E gli alti pini hauran pungenti foglie.
Mentre li vivi fonti
Correran mormorando.
Nel alto mar, che con amor gli accoglit, etc.
And in another place:

Mentre serpente in dumi
Saranno, e pesci in fiumi,
Ne Sol vivrai, ne la mia stanca lingua,
Ma per Pastor diversi,
In mill altre sampogne, e mill versi.
But in mine opinion these are too general, whereas those of our Poet are
particular and Satirical, and therefore more commendable.
