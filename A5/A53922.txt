THE KERNEL OF Christianity.
WHat is every one bound to know that looks to be saved?

A. Two things. 1. Something concerning God. 2. Something concerning Man.


Q. What ought you to know and believe concerning God?

A. That there is own most glorious God. Deuteronomy. 6. 4. Exodus 33. 18.

Q. How does it appear that God is so glorious?

A. In four particulars.

1. In his Essence, which is incomprehensible. 2. In his attributes, which are
those divine perfections whereby he makes himself known to us, which attributes
are not qualities in God, but nature. Gods Justice is God himself, and Gods
power is God himself, etc. 3. In his persons, which are three. 1. The Father
begetting. 2. The Son begotten. 3. The Holy Ghost proceeding.
1. The Father 2. The Son 3. The Holy Ghost
is glorious in regard of Election. Redemption. Application.
1. The Father 2. The Son 3. The Holy Ghost
is glorious in choosing the house. purchasing the house. dwelling in the house.


that is in the heart of a poor sinner. 4. In his works.
Q. What are those?

A. 1. His decrees of Election. Reprobation.

2. His works of Creation. Providence.




Q. What ought you to know and believe concerning his work of creation?

A. That this one glorious God made all things of nothing in six days in
excellent order and very good. Heb. 11. 3. Exodus 20. 11. Genesis 1. 21.

Q. What ought you to know and believe concerning the work of providence?

A. That this one glorious God, wisely orders, governs, and disposes of
all things, even to the least circumstance, Mat. 6. 26. etc. and 10. 29, 30.

Q. What ought you to know and believe concerning man?

A. These six things following: 1. What was the glorious, and happy condition
of man by creation. 2. What that miserable, and lamentable estate is, that man
is now fallen into. 3. What Jesus Christ is, the only means of deliverance out
of this estate. 4. What faith is, the only means of applying Christ, and how it
is wrought in the soul. 5. What that happy estate is, that every man that is in
Christ by faith, is brought unto. 6. What kind of thankfulness, and life it
is, that God requires of all them that be in this estate by Christ.


Q What are you to know concerning the glorious condition of man by Creation?

A. God created all mankind in his own image.

Q. Wherein did the Image of God consist?

A. In perfect knowledge, righteousness and holiness. Col. 3. 10. Ephesians. 4.
24.

Q. Man being created in a most happy condition, wherein did his happiness
consist?

A. In two things espycially: 1. His understanding was full of divine knowledge
of the whole mind of God. 2. His will and affections were fully conformable to
Gods will.


Q. Wherein did man's happiness further consist?

A. In five things: 1. He was in favor with God. 2. He had familiar communion
with God. 3. He felt unspeak able joy arising from this communion. 4. He had
dominion over all inferior creatures. 5. He was immortal, and should never
have tasted of death, if he had not fallen by sin.


Q. Does this any way concern us?

A. Yes; his estate was ours in him; we being then in his loins.

Q. What learn you by this?

A. Three things: 1. To lament and bewail the loss of this condition by
sin. 2. That I ought to labor to get this image of God repaired in me. 3.
That I ought not to be ashamed of holiness, nor to content my self with some
small measures of it, much less to hate it, as profane persons and dissembling
hypocrites do.


Q. What is that miserable and lamentable estate that man is now fallen into?

A. His misery now appears in four things. 1. In his birth: he is borne dead in
sin and so void of all good, and full of all evil, and so a child of wrath.
Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3, 4. Romans 1. 29. 2. In his life: whatsoever he does is sin
in Gods sight. Tit. 1. 15. God and all creatures are his enemies. Psalm. 5. 5.
Job 5. 23. he remains abondslave of Satan till God convert him. Act. 16. 18.
and hangs by the twine-thred of life every moment ready to drop into hell. 3.
In his death: then comes an end of all his hopes, and pleasures, and the
beginning of all his woes and sorrows. 4. After death: First comes his
particular judgment. Heb. 9. 27. after this follows his general judgment,
when that terrible sentence, 15. and the 41. ver. shall be pressed upon him.
After this follows the execution, wherein the vialls of Gods fierce wrath are
powered out upon his soul and body, which fire shall never be quenched.


Q. Wherein does the aggraration of this woeful estate of man by nature appear?

A. In three particulars: 1. He knows not his misery. Rev. 3. 17. 2. He is not
affected with it, though he should know it. Romans 2. 5. 3. He is unable of
himself to come out of it, though he should both know it, and be affected with
it. Romans 5. 6.


Q. What learn you from hence?

A. I learn that Gods wrath against sin, and sinful man (remaining in this
condition) is very great.

Q. How great is it?

A. So great that nothing (without Christ) but eternal death of body and soul
in the cverlasting torments of Hell can satisfy Gods just displeasure. Gal. 3.
10.

Q. Is it best now to see your miserable condition by nature, and to feel this
wrath of God, and mourn under it while there is hope, and means to come out of
it, or to stay till the gate of grace be shut, and God snatches the soul from
all hope, and means by death?

A. It Is far better to see it, and to mourn under it now.

Q. How, and why must a man see and feel himself under this wrath and misery?

A. 1. Every man must see that he is under Gods wrath for the present, else he
will never seek to Christ to bear it for him. 2. Man must see what this
fearful wrath of God is, that is now piled against him; else he will never
prize Christ to deliver him out of it. 3. All men must see that this wrath is
ready to light on them every moment in the full measure of it; else they will
defer their return till hereafter. 4. A man must see he is bound hand and
foot in the chains of his sins, and cannot come from under them, nor lay hold
of Christ to help him out of them; else he will presume he has received Christ
when he has not,


Q. What is to be known of every one concerning Jesus Christ, the only means of
deliverance out of this estate?

A. These four things: 1. What his person is, namely, both God and man united
into one person which is, Jesus Christ. 2. What his love is toward man, namely
past understanding. Ephesians. 3. 18, 19. 3. What his offices are, which are these
three.
1. His Priestly office, whereby he offered himself for his Church. Heb. 7. 27.
2. His Prophetical office, whereby he teaches his Church. Act. 3. 22. 3. His
Kingly office, whereby he rules his Church. Psalm. 2. 6. 4. How he delivers
those, whom he purposes to save, namely by being made sin, and curse and
righteousness for them. 2 Cor. 5. 21. Gal. 3. 13. 1 Cor. 1. 30.


Q. What learn you from hence?

A. I learn that all my sinful duties, no nor my death, cannot pacify Gods
wrath, and deliver me from it: It is done only by the perfect righteousness and
death of Jesus Christ.

Q. How may we come to get this Christ to do all for us?

A. By receiving him by Faith. Ioh. 1. 12.

Q. When may a man without presumption receive Christ as his own?

A. 1. When the poor soul is so weary, and heavy laden with the apprehension of
sin, and wrath that it cannot live without Christ. Mat. 11. 28, 29. 2. When
the poor sinner is so out of love with himself, that he is content to part with
all sin for Christ. Isa. 55. 7. 3. When the poor sinner receives Christ to
that end that God the Father offers him, namely to be his Priest, Prophet, and
King.


Q. How may a man come to receive Christ? can man create Faith in himself to
receive him, or must the Lord by an infinite almighty power work it in him?

A. The Lord must create faith in him by his almighty power. Ephesians. 1. 19.

Q. What is to be known concerning faith, the only means of applying Christ?

A. Two things 1. What Faith is. 2. How it is wrought in the soul.



Q. What is Faith?

A. It is a special grace of God, whereby an humbled sinner feeling himself
unable to believe, is drawn, and so comes by the help of Gods Spirit to Christ
for all good, and so rests upon him. Mat. 11. 28. Job 6. 44, 45. Phil. 3. 7, 8,
9.

Q. How does the Lord work this Faith in the soul by his mighty power, and how
comes the soul to know it is wrought?

A. By these nine steps: 1. The Lord gives the soul a listening ear to the word
preached, as if God himself were speaking to it. 2. The Lord makes the soul to
understand the word. Mat. 13. 23. 3. The Lord savingly wounds the soul, with
the sense and apprehension of his lost estate; having understood it. Act. 2.
37. 4. Then the Lord makes the soul poor in spirit, ready to dye for want of
grace, and Christ. Mat. 5. 3. Act. 6. 9. 5. The Lord reveals unto the soul the
freenes of his grace and mercy in Christ, and then brings the soul to ponder on
this mercy, from whence arises hope of help, Joh. 3. 16. hereupon hope comes
and waits on Christ for it, seeing now it is possible that an unworthy
sinful, lost creature may have it. Joel 2. 14. Jonah 3. 9. 6. The Lord
reveals the riches of his mercy in Christ, whereby the soul hungers after it,
Ephesians. 2. 7. Mat. 5. 6. and is not quiet without it, hence the desires, and
longs, and beggs for it, with unutterable groans, seeing and knowing (with the
prodigal) that there is enough in his fathers house. Luke 15. Rom 8. 26. 7.
Then the Lord reveals the worth and excellency of his mercy in Christ, and
hereby makes the soul to love it. Ephesians. 3. 7. Hence love to this mercy comes
secretly, and contents it self with it; hereupon the soul promises, if it may
but have this mercy in the Lord Jesus to pity it, and receive it; it will
everlastingly own it, and admire the Lord for it, Lam. 3. 24. 8. The Lord
reveals the sweetness of his mercy in the Lord Jesus, and hereby gives the
soul a satisfying taste of it, Psalm. 63. 3. and hence the will comes and is
persuaded with joy to leave it self for ever upon it, here to live, or here to
die. Psalm. 39. 7. 9. The soul being thus come up to Christ; the Lord does at
last reveal the property of mercy to him, (thus believing) whereby the soul is
now assured and persuaded that neither height, nor depth shall separate him
from Gods love in Christ. Romans 8. 38, 39.


Q. What is that happy condition that every one does enjoy, who are thus in
Christ by Faith?

A. It consists in two things: 1. Union with Christ. 2. The benefits which the
soul does enjoy hereby.


Q. What is Union with Christ?

A. It is that whereby the Spirit makes the soul one with Christ, and Christ
all to it. 1 Cor. 6. 17. Col. 3. 11.

Q. What benefits does the soul immediately enjoy by Union with Christ?

A. These four 1. Justification. 2. Reconciliation. 3. Adoption. 4.
Regeneration.



Q. What is Justification.

A. It is a gracious act of God the Father, whereby he imputing the sins of a
believer to Christ, and Christ's righteousness to him, he accounts him
guiltless, and just before him. Romans 3. 26. 4. 3. 5. 5. 1. 2 Cor. 5. 21.
Ephesians. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14. Psalm. 32. 1, 2.

Q. What is Reconciliation?

A. It is a most gracious act of God the Father offended, whereby he receives
into his favor a justified sinner. 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19. Col. 1. 21.

Q. What is Adoption?

A. A gracious act of God the Father, whereby he accounts a reconciled sinner
his son and so makes him coheire with Christ. Gal. 4. 5, 6.

Q. What is Regeneration?

A. It is a gracious act of God in the heart of his sons, whereby in uniting
them unto Christ, he infuseth a most glorious life into them. Ephesians. 2. 10. and
4. 24.

Q. What follows a believers Union with Christ?

A. Two things. 1. Coalition, or growing up with Christ. 2. Glorification.


Q. By what means or wherein does a believing soul grow up with Christ?

A. By increase of faith and sanctification.

Q. Wherein does sanctification consist?

1. In mortification, or dying daily to sin. 2. In vivification, or living
daily to Christ. Rom 6. 3, 4, 5. Romans 8. 11.


Q. How are Faith and sanctification confirmed and increased?

A. By the same means that they are begun by, and also by receiving of the
Sacraments.

Q. How many Sacraments be there?

A. Two 1. Baptism which confirms our Regeneration, or new birth. 2. The Lords
Supper, which signifies and seals our groath in Christ.



Q. What is a believers glorification?

A. When death has swallowed the bodies of Gods faithful Servants, their
blessed souls are taken up to Christ, and swallowed up in Glory which never
shall have an end. 1 These. 4. 17.

Q. What kind of thankfulness and life is that which God requires of all
them that be in this estate by Jesus Christ?

A. The Lord requires of them to answer his infinite love with their love
again, to the praise of Jesus Christ, testified by obedience to the morral law,
observing it (though not as a Covenant of works, yet) as a rule of life,
according to his will. Ioh. 14 15. 21.

Q. What is this called?

A. Serving of God. Luke 1. 74, 75.

Q. How must this be performed?

A. 1. Without slavish fear. 2. With love. 3. In holiness and righteousness
in all things. 4. All this must be done before him, or in his sight. 5. And
lastly, this must be done constantly all the days of their life, in all
places, at all times, in all estates and conditions.
