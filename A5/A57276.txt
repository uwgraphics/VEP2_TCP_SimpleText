OXFORD, Printed at the THEATER Anno Dom. 1688.

Ridleus ad Lectorem.
HAEc, amice Lector, bona fide scripsimus, non quod isthaec eadem omnia vel
eisdem aut ordine, aut Forma verborum, me in Scholis dixisse affirmaverim:
Nequaquam hoc dixerim, erat enim hoc tunc impossible, ita eram tunc tanquam
Ursus catenatus Molossorum multitudine undique allatrantium circumdatus, and
exagitatus; sed quod sciam me ista, aut ejus generis simillima habuisse, and
interdum credo istis (pro ea quae tum data est mihi dicendi occasio) interdum
etiam commodiora. Nam Deo sint gratiae, cujus hoc singular beneficium fuisse
agnosco, nunquam mihi aut ingenium praesentius, aut Lingua promptius alicui
negotio quam illi Disputationi mihi inserviisse sunt visa. Unde, amice Lector!
quicquid antehac legisti, aut audisti, quod ad illam nostram disputationem
pertinet, vel posthac quicquid contigerit te legere aut audire a quocunque
descriptum, and relatum, quod cum his quae jam scripsi repugnabit in sensu, and
in summa non consenserit, id universum scias esse falsum, and vel ab imperito
and indocto scriba qui meas responsiones non been intellexerit, aut oscitante,
qui non satis diligenter attenderit, vel ab invido, and malitioso Papista, qui
Hostis est Dei and veritatis, esse profectum. -- Scias insuper Amice Lector,
Dominum Proloquutorem mihi in Scholis inter disputandum public promisisse, ut
viderem Responsiones meas, quomodo essent a Notariis exceptae, and ut haberem
facultatem easdem supplendi, and perficiendi, aut etiam commutandi, si quid
postea visum foret commodius quod propositis argumentis respondere vellem.
Promisit etiam mihi Locum, and Tempus public danda, in quibus libere omnia
quae vellem in confirmationem mearum responsionum liceret adducere. Haec omnia
cum public promisisset, in auditu reliquorum Commissariorum, and totius
Scholae Oxoniensis, scias inquam eum nihil horum in veritate praestitisse. Quid
igitur fidei istius modi hominibus, and ubi tales sunt Judices, habendum est in
arcanis mysteriis Dei; qui in suis promissis tam palam factis, tam justo jure
debitis, and in tam seriis rebus, neque Deum, neque homines veriti, fidem
fallere non erubescunt, ego prudentioribus judicandum relinquo. Et nunc quid
restat, nisi ut precemur ut Deus Ecclesiae suae Anglicanae misereri velit, ut
ipsa aliquando clare videat, and amplectatur avide in facie Jesu Christi
voluntatem patris caelestis; and ut grassantes Lupos, atque Impostores
gravissimos qui tam misere gregem suum dilaniant, vel pro sua infinita bonitate
transformet in fideles pastores, aut pro aequissimo suo Judicio, ab Ovili suo,
ne amplius Oves Christi conturbare, and dissipare valiant, quam citissime
abscindat. - Amen! Amen! Et qui habet spiritum Christi, ut inquit Johannes,
dicat Amen! -- Scias postremo, cum Dominus Proloquutor proposuisset nobis tres
propositiones, and jussisset singulis parari a nobis responsionem, post habitam
unam duntaxat hujusmodi Disputationem cum unoquoque nostrum de prima tantum
propositione, absque ulteriori delatione, and antequam de reliquis duabus
propositionibus, meas Scio responsiones vel accepisset, vel audisset (in quod
in die quo tulit in nos sententiam, interrogavit simul omnes utrum vellemus eis
ea forma qua proponebantur simpliciter subscribere) condemnavit nos omnes, me
dico, Cranmerum, and Latymerum, (patres in Christo reverendissimos, atque in
aeternum mihi fratres charissimos) horrendissimi Haereseos criminis de omnibus
illis tribus propositionibus: and sejunctos ab invicem, atque in diversis Locis
distractos, tradidit servandos in diem Combustionis; ablatis prius a nobis
propriis nostris Famulis, ablatis postea, cum abiret, calamo, charta, and
atramento.

Deus misereatur nostri, and benedicat nobis; illuminet vultum suum super nos,
and misereatur nostri; ut cognoscant in Terra viam tuam, and in omni gente
salutem tuam.

Omnipotens Deus qui causas humilium respicit, and solvere consuevit gemitus
compeditorum; Ipse jam dignetur Causam Ecclesiae suae Anglicanae respicere,
atque ejus malis omnibus, pro sua immensa misericordia, finem brevi imponere
dignetur.

Amen.
NIC. RIDLEUS.

Disputatio habita Oxonii 19 Apr. A. 1554. D. Cranmer respondente.
POst recitatam praefationem attulit Consensum Chedsey.
Evangelistarum, Matt. 26. Marc. 14. Luc. 22. Ergo, inquit, verum est corpus,
and verus Sanguis, nam in duorum, aut trium testium stat omnis veritas.

Verum corpus esse fateor, and verum sanguinem de Cranmer.
quibus mentionem faciunt Evangelistae; nempe corpus vere crucifixum, and
sanguis vere fusus. Sed panem appellavit illud verum corpus, and vinum
sanguinem verum, sed figurata Loquutione, quia sacramenta instituebat corporis
occisi, and sanguinis fusi. -- Atque huc referebat totius rei Definitionem, and
pro ampliori solutione exhibuit quoddam scriptum.

Ergo vocatione, and significatione erat corpus, and Chedsey.
non vere; sed Christus illud quod tradebatur vocavit Corpus suum, sed panis
non tradebatur, ergo panem non vocavit corpus suum.

Nego Majorem; non enim quod tradebatur vocavit Cranmer.
Corpus suum, sed Panem vocavit verum corpus suum quod tradebatur. Ergo panis
fractus Sacramentum est passionis, and repraesentat corpus Jesu in mortem pro
nobis traditum, and ideo vocatur nomine corporis traditi.

Rursus urget verba Evangelistarum - Hoc est corpus Chedsey.
meum - hic est sanguis meus. Caetera desunt.

THE PREFACE.
THere is no good Protestant but will be glad to meet with any Relic, though
never so small (a Finger or a Tooth, if I may so speak) of our Blessed Martyrs,
especially such Eminent ones as Bishop Ridley and Mr. Bradford: I mean any of
their Writings that never yet were Printed, cannot but find a very hearty
welcome amongst them; and such is a good part of what is now published. Bishop
Ridley's Treatise indeed has been Printed long since, and is in our Libraries,
and has been again lately Reprinted; but any account of the Disputation with
him at Oxford in Latin, I have not met with but in this Manuscript; neither is
the Letter of Mr. Bradford's, now published, in Foxes History. However there is
no Impartial Reader will have reason to suspect either of them to be spurious:
They are of the same Spirit and Temper, which we find from our Histories, to
have animated and governed those great Men. And what is now Printed, I do
assure the Reader, is exactly according to the Manuscripts I found in my
Fathers Study presently upon his Death, 1671.

Our Adversaries boast, the Relics of their Saints work Miracles, (indeed as
they have been, and which is more, are still managed; they are Full of Wonders)
I hope these of ours will Do some Good, partly by showing the World how
consonant the Church of England is, and always has been, to her Principles,
particularly in that concerning the Presence in the Eucharist, (in managing of
which she always walked after the Scripture Phrase, with great Fear and
Reverence, and expressed her self in the Interpretation, with so much Nicety and
Caution, as to have given occasion, perhaps, to have been misunderstood by some
weak, or to be artificially misrepresented, by some Evil Men, to I know not what
purposes) partly by setting before us Examples, not only of suffering if it be
the will of God, but also, of all good and dutiful behavior toward our
Superiors, with meekness and fear; for whom we do, and will always implore the
Throne of Grace to support their Authority over us, let the Scepter held out,
be what it will.

For these Reasons I am content this Manuscript be Printed.

PREFATIO.
NUnquam mihi contigit in Universa mea vita videre aut audire quicquam vanius
aut tumultuosius geri, quam haec quae nuper mecum habita est disputatio in
Scholis Oxonii. Et profecto non arbitrabar inter nostrates potuisse reperiri
alicujus Literaturae aliquos aliquo gradu insigniori donatos, qui tam
perfrictae essent frontis, ut hujusmodi scenicis vanitatibus (quibus ea
disputatio abundabat) indulgere aequo animo sustinuissent. Sorbonici Clamores,
quos olim vidi Parisiis, ubi Papismus maxim regnat, prae nostra hac Thrasonica
ostentatione speciem aliquam habere modestiae merito videri possint. Nam and
mirum erat, quod qui aliorum Moderatores ibi esse debuerunt, quique aliis sese
formam in agendo praebuissent in verbo, and Gravitate, etc. (ut Paulus inquit)
ipsi sane omnium profusissime aliis ad tumultuandum, and clamandum Classicum
cecinerunt; Unde manifestum est, (Christian Lector!) quod haudquaquam ab istis
sincera aliqua veritas, sed prorsus vana mundi gloria, and Thrasonica victoria
quaerebatur. Caeterum ne ad innumera convitia quibus ego inter disputandum
totus conspuebar, causa nostra, quae Dei est, and Ecclesiae ipsius, mendosis
etiam disputationis habitae exemplaribus mundo traducatur, atque inde damnum
aliquod ipsa veritas sustinere possit: Visum est mihi meam Literis commendare
responsionem, ut quisquis ejus cognoscendae est cupidus, simul and veritatis
studiosus, scire ex his possit and quae mihi maxim objecta fuerint, and in
summa quid d me singulis sit responsum. Quanquam tibi, Amice Lector, verissimum
esse fateor omnia omnium mihi a tam multis, and tam tumultuose objecta, and a
me vicissim tot interdum simul opponentibus tam celeriter responsa ponere esse
omnino impossible. Ad haec bona pars temporis in contumeliosis opprobriis, and
plusquam theatricis exsibilationibus, applausionibus, and Triumphis ad
captandam auram popularem populari sermon inaniter consumpta est. Quam rem cum
ego aegerrime ferrem, ac public deplorarem, testarerque coetum illum
eruditorum virorum, ac Scholas, quae Theologorum gravitati destinatae esse
dicuntur, hujusmodi ineptiis, and scenicis vanitatibus contaminari, atque
pollui, and actores suae causae vanitatem per haec ipsa palam prodere, dicendo
nihil profeci; sed obloquentium exsibilationibus, and vociferationibus, partim
vero praesidentium authoritate, coactus sum ejus generis in me jactata
convitia, qualia profecto viri graves non sustinuissent, citra ruborem, audire
conjecta a turpissimo nebulone in vilissimum ganeonem.

In initio disputationis, cum meam responsionem ad primam propositionem
voluissem paucis, idque Dialecticorum more confirmare, priusquam primam
probationem, quae non admodum prolixa est, potuissem absolvere, exclamant ipsi
Domini Doctores Loquitur Blasphemias! Blasphemias! Cumque ego supplex, atque
enixe precarer uti perorantem audire dignarentur, qua mea supplicatione
commotus, ut videbatur, D. Prolocutor, inclamat ex alto, Legate, Legate; and ego
tum rursus pergerem legere, tantus continuo obortus est clamor, Blasphemias!
Blasphemias! ut nunquam me ullum audisse, aut legisse Similem, praeter illum
qui in Actis Apostolorum excitatus est a Demetrio Fabro argentario, cum suis
qui erant ejusdem artis, clamantibus in Paulum Magna Diana Ephesiorum! Magna
Diana Ephesiorum! Et praeter disputationem quandam quam Arriani habebant contra
Orthodoxos in Africa, ubi dicitur Quales praesides erant, talis erat and
Disputationis Finis; omnia erant plena tumultu, and Arrianorum calumniis, ut
nibil quiet audiri potuisset. Haec victor, in secundo Lib. suae History.
Atque ita invaluerunt istorum Clamores, and tumultuationes, ut ego velim nollem
cogerer probationes meas alioqui satis breves, inchoatas dimittere. Testes
habeo bujus veritatis omnes cordatiores qui intererant. Sed de his plura
conqueri jam desinam; and nunc mihi curae erit Argumenta mihi proposita, and
meas vicissim ad argumenta illorum Responsiones, quantum mihi mea memoria
diligentiori singularium circumstantiarum recordatione suggerere potuerit,
summatim annotare.

Disputatio habita Oxonii 20 Aprilis de praesentia Corporis Christi in
Eucharistia, A. D. 1554. Ridleio nuper Londonensi respondente.
AScensio Christi in Caelum, and ejusdem ibidem D. Smith.
perpetua Sessio ad dextram patris, non obstat quicquam reali praesentiae
Corporis Christi in Sacramento Altaris. Ergo tu Falleris.

Realis Christi praesentiae duplex potest esse Intellectus. Ridley.
Nam si intelligas realem Christi praesentiam secundum assumptae carnis realem,
and Corporalem substantiam; ea praesentia, cum sit in caelis, obstat quo minus
simul possit esse in Terris. Sin intelligas realem praesentiam secundum rem
aliquam quae ad Corpus pertinet, ea sane non obstat; quia sic est Corpus
Christi hic nobis in caena Dominica per gratiam, ut Epiphanius loquitur.

Christus perpetuo sedet ad dexteram patris, and tamen Smith.
sic quoque in Terris ab ascensione visus est, ergo falleris, and probatur
antecedens ex 15 Johan.

Quod Christus ab ascensione sua visus est ab hominibus Ridley.
in Terris, certum est. Visus est enim a Stephano: visus est etiam fateor a
Paulo; sed utrum ipse ad Terras descenderit, an in celo consistens praebuit se
Paulo conspicuum, cum Paulus in tertium caelum raperetur, scio esse
controversum, and Scriptura, quod sciam, non definit, and de incertis incertum
Judicium est ferendum.

Linus in Historia passionis Petri and Pauli, and Aegesippus Smith.
testantur Christum visum a Petro.

Scio ita Scriptum esse ab Eusebio in Ecclesiastica Ridley.
Historia, non tamen istas istorum relationes pro canonica Scriptura habeo.
Quanquam si aliquando ab ascensione hic in Terris cuipiam apparuisset, nihil
nostrae officit Sententiae. Neque enim nos compedes in^icimus Christo, ut
quidam falso de nobis loquuntur, quin possit pro suo Beneplacito in Terris
quandocunque vult apparere; sed quod simul, and eodem Temporis momento in caelo
existat, and in Terris, secundum suam substantiam corporalem, dicimus esse
contra naturam suae humanitatis, and sui Corporis verum modum. Perpetua autem
Sessio ad dextram Patris, potest fateor intelligi Stabilitas regni Christi, and
perpetua ejusdem cum patre in gloria caelesti aequalitas.

Ego oftendam vobis quid per realem Christi Praesentiam (...) Weston.
intelligimus. Intelligimus semper ipsissimi Corporis Christi veram, and
corporalem praesentiam.

Hic allegabat Canonem quem dicebat esse Nicaeni D. Smith.
Concilii pro Transubstantiatione, and carnali Christi praesentia in
Eucharistia, cujus Canonis verborum jam non memini; sed prorsus similis erat
Canoni de eadem re Lateranensis Concilii; quamobrem negabam talem extare
Canonem in Niceno concilio.

Tunc D. Cole, non est, inquit, Canon Concilii Nicaeni, D. Cole.
sed est Ephesini. -- Ridley pernegebat ullum talem Canonem extare aut in
Ephesino, Nicaeno, Chalcedonensi, aut Constantinopolitano.

D. Cole clamat - Afferatur Liber - Ridley-Afferatur, and nusquam invenietur.
Tunc quidam qui sedebat inter Scribas dicebat se in aliquo alio Concilio ex
recentioribus Synodis legisse, and sic itum est ad alia.

Chrysostomus Hom. 17 ad Hebr. Christus multis Smith. Weston.
locis offertur; hic plenus Christus, and illic plenus. -- Uunum Corpus, and
una est Hostia, non multae E. potest esse in multis locis simul, and eodem
Tempore in caelo, and in Terra.

Concedo cum Chrysostomo, una est hostia, non multae, Ridley.
and una dicitur nostra hostia ab unitate illius unicae, quam unam omnes
nostrae repraesentant; Illa autem unica, fuit ea quae semel duntaxat oblata est
in ara crucis, cuius omnes nostrae sunt Sacramentalia Exemplaria. -- Et quod
dixisti Christum in multis Locis simul offerri, hic plenum Christum, and illic
plenum, verum est quoque Christum offerri simul multis in Locis, sed in
mysterio, and Sacramentaliter, and plenum esse in omnibus illis Locis, non
secundum corporalem Carnis assumptae substantiam, sed secundum Benedictionem
vivificativam, quae datur piis in pane and vino, ut Cyrillus loquitur. -- Quod
ad oblationem Christi attinet, ipsemet Chrysostomus, quid Sentiat clarissime
explicat, per correctionem dicens - Idem semper facimus, magis autem
recordatione sacrificii operamur.

Bernardus in sermon de Caena D. - Gratulare sponsa! Weston.
Gaude ineffabiliter! nam in multis idem, in multis Locis Christus a solis
ortu, usque ad occasum, ab aquilone ad austrum offertur. Ergo potest esse simul
in multis Locis.

Facilis est Responsio - Quod unus Christus est, and ubique; Ridley.
quippe Deus secundum majestatem, secundum providentiam; and, ut Augustinus
ait, cum piis ubique secundum invisibilem and infallibilem gratiam: alioqui, si
secundum corporalem praesentiam intelligeretur Bernardus, quam monstrosum, and
Giganteum corpus faceretis de corpore Christi, quod ab Aquilone ad austrum, ab
Occasu in ortum usque protenderetur.

Chrysostom. ad Pop. Antiochen. Hom. 2. Helias correptus Alius nescio quis.
in caelum curru igneo, clamidem demisit suo discipulo Helizaeo, nec simul
secum habere potuit: Christus ascendit in caelum, and veram Carnem secum
assumpsit, and nobiscum in Terris reliquit. Sed non reliquit nisi in Sacramento
altaris. E. etc.

Concedo Christum utrumque fecisse: Hoc est, and Ridley.
Carnem dum ascenderet secum sumpsisse and hic quoque nobiscum eandem
reliquisse: sed id quidem factum est long diversis modis. Assumpsit autem
Carnem suam secundum veram Corporis Carnis corporalem substantiam, reliquit in
Mysterio in Caena Dominica fidelibus secundum spiritualem Communicationem, and
per gratiam percipiendam. Nec percipitur tantum in Caena Dominica, sed and
alias quoque ex auditu Evangelii per Fidem. Panis enim quem frangimus, corpus
Christi est and generaliter nisi manducaveritis carnem filii hominis, and
biberitis ejus sanguinem, non habetis vitam in vobis.

Hic triumphationes populares agebantur, and in me conjiciebantur convitiorum
plena plaustra. Chrysos. Smyth.
de dignitate sacerdotis, Lib. 4. O summam Dei beneficentiam! O Miraculum! Qui
sursum sedet ad dextram Dei patris, eadem hora omnium manibus tenetur.

Tenetur profecto a piis communicantibus, non solum Ridley.
sacramentaliter, manu corporis, sed multo salubrius, manu cordis, and haustu
interiore sumitur, ac per sacramentalem significationem tenetur ab omnibus.

Christus majus quiddam reliquit quam Helias cum Alius Incognitus.
pallium discipulo reliquisset. Helias autem reliquit cum pallio gratiam per
quam Elizaeus postea pallio Heliae aquas divide bat.

Concedo libenter Christum multo majora nobis reliquisse, Ridley.
quam Helias Helizaeo, licet dicatur reliquisse duplicem suum spiritum; quia
virtus and gratia Corporis Christi quam Christus ascendens nobis reliquit,
unica est salus, and vita omnium Servandorum, quam reliquit nobis Christus hic
percipiendam ex auditu verbi, and ex legitima suorum sacramentorum nobis facta
administratione. Hanc virtutem, and gratiam Chrysostomus more Johannis
Evangelistae, Carnem Christi vocat.

Hilarious ait - Deus neminem fallit Vocabulis, quia Alius Incognitus.
est ipsa veritas. Verum est ergo quod dicit; dicit autem hoc est corpus meum:
Ergo est corpus Christi.

Concedo tibi haec omnia. Ridley


Quid tradidit Christus Discipulis in caena? Incognitus


Panem, corpus suum. Ridley


Tradidit illud quod jussit eos accipere, sed jussit eos Incognitus
accipere corpus suum, and non panem, ergo Corpus erat quod tradidit, and non
panis.

Nego minorem. Jussit enim accipere corpus suum Ridley.
sacramentaliter in pane materiali, and ita Panis erat quod eos accipere
jussit, quia substantia erat panis; and etiam Corpus, quia Sacramentum erat sui
corporis, propter sanctificationem, and accessionem spiritus sancti, qui
mysteriis a Christo institutis, and legitime administratis, semper solet
assistere.

Disparatum de Disparato non potest praedicari, ut Ogilthorp.
homo non est Lapis: Ita panis non potest esse corpus Christi.

In propriis locutionibus non potest, Concedo, sed Ridley.
in tropicis, qualis haec loquutio Christi in verbis caenae-Hoc - i. e. hic
panis - est corpus meum, been potest. -- Johannes est Helias. Petra erat
Christus. Ego sum vitis.

Theophylact. in 6 Johan. ait quod fit Conversio panis Weston.
in Carnem Dominicam, and quod illud quod Christus ded it nos damus, illud
autem non erat, inquit, figura Corporis, sed corpus ipsum.

De authoritate Theophylacti quid sentiebat Ridleius, Ridley.
non explicavit; neque enim commode potuit, tot tam multorum vociferationibus
exagitatus. Respondit simpliciter ad propositum locum Theophylacti.

Concedo, inquit, panem converti in corpus Christi, sed non per
Transubstantionem, sed per Sacramentalem conversionem. Transformatur inquit
Theophylactus ibidem, per mysticam benedictionem, and accessionem spiritus
Sancti, in carnem Domini; Non dicit per Expulsionem substantiae panis, and
substitutionem corporalis substantiae carnis Domini. Et quod dicit non est
Figura Corporis, subintelligendum est quod and ipse alibi addidit - Tantum. Hoc
enim non est nuda figura corporis; assistit enim Christus suis mysteriis; neque
unquam, ut Cyprianus ait, Divina majestas absentat sese a divinis mysteriis.

Qui sedebat ad mensam inter scribas, qui sibi vindicabat Quidam Incognitus
Linguae Graecae, (ut videbatur) notitiam, allegabat verbum Graecum quod
vertitur Transelementatur - Hoc verbum, inquit, importat, substantiae in
substantiam Conversionem: Ergo substantia Panis convertitur in substantiam
corporis Christi.

Negat verbum illud Graecum eam vim habere, and Ridley.
citabat ex eodem Theophylacto alium locum, in quo idem Theophyl. utitur eodem
verbo, dicens - Nos Transelementari in carnem Christi. Sed absurdum est dicere
nos Transubstantiari in Corpus Christi.

Christus dedit nobis suam veram carnem manducandam, Incognitus
sed nunquam dedit eam manducandam, nisi in ultima Caena, and in sacramento
altaris. Ergo.

Si de vera Christi Carne loqueris secundum substantiam Ridley.
carnis assumptae, and non per gratiam, and spiritualiter, nego majorem. Sin
autem intelligas de vera carne secundum gratiam and spiritualem
Communicationem, tunc concedo majorem, and nego minorem. Dat enim nobis vere
carnem suam manducandam omnibus in eum credentibus. Est enim verus cibus animae
quo pascimur perpetuo in vitam aeternam, juxta illud, - Caro mea vere est cibus.

Post contumeliosam praefatiunculam, quam fateor D. Glyn.
eo molestius tuli, quod habitus est mihi semper pro veterano amico, (sed quia
scenae credo inservire voluit, and postea cum ad aedes in quibus custodiebar
venisset, Petit a me suorum dictorum veniam coram Yongo, opinor, and
Ogelthorpo, ego illi ex animo remitto; and opto claram in Domino Evangelicae
sinceritatis cognitionem, and precor ut aliquando remissis non modo illi, sed
and reliquis omnibus offensis, plene reconciliati conveniamus in domo patris
caelestis) Sed argumentum ita formavit- Agnovit Ecclesia verum Christi Corpus
in Sacramento, Ergo ibi est verum Corpus Christi. Antecedens probatur ex
Augustino contra Faustum Haereticum.

Quomodo Ecclesia Christi, quae est sponsa Christi, Ridley.
edocta est a spiritu sancto per regulam verbi Christi agnoscere verum corpus
Christi in caena Dominica, ita and ego libenter agnosco. Agnoscit autem
Ecclesia praesentiam Corporis Christi in caena Dominica piis, per gratiam, and
spiritualiter, ut saepe jam dixi and per Sacramentalem significationem, non
autem per corporalem praesentiam corporis carnis Christi.

Chrysostom. Quod est in Calice, Id est quod fluxit de latere Curlop.
Christi; sed verus sanguis corporaliter fluxit de latere Christi: Ergo verus
naturalis sanguis corporaliter est in Sacramento Altaris.

Quemadmodum panis Sacramentalis and Eucharisticus, Ridley.
dicitur Corpus Christi quod pro nobis est traditum; ita sane poculum Domini
est sanguis, qui pro nobis effusus est, sive idem qui fluxit de latere Christi:
sed panis dicitur Corpus Domini pro nobis traditum, quia est ejus corporis
Sacramentum; Ita Calix, scilicet id quod est in Calice, dicitur sanguis pro
nobis effusus, vel id quod fluxit de Latere Christi, quia est ejus sanguinis de
Latere Christi effluentis Sacramentum, ab ipso Domino ordinatum in nostrum
singular commodum; hoc est ad alitionem nostram spiritualem, sicut est
Baptismus in aqua ad spiritualem regenerationem.

Joh. 6. Qui manducat meam Carnem, and bibit Watson.
meum sanguinem, in me manet, and ego in eo. De qua manducatione intelligis
esse dictum?

De spirituali manducatione. Ridley


An Eucharistia sit sacramentum a Domino institutum Watson.
in sua ultima caena cum suis Discipulis.

Concedo haec omnia ita se habere. Ridley


Quid est Sacramentum? Watson.


Tritum est illud Augustini; est Invisibilis gratiae visibilis Ridley.
Forma: alioqui quomodo sacramentum a multis scriptoribus vary accipitur,
credo tibi non esse ignotum.

Eucharistia est Sacramentum Novi Testamenti; Watson.
habet ergo promissionem Gratiae; sed nulla promissio facta est pani and vino;
ergo panis and vinum non sunt Sacramenta Novi Testamenti.

Concedo ad Eucharistiam pertinere gratiam, juxta Ridley.
illud - Panis quem frangimus nonne Communicatio Corporis Christi est? Et sicut
qui edit and bibit indigne sacramentum corporis and sanguinis Domini reus est
corporis and sanguinis, and Judicium sibi edit and bibit, ita sane qui digne
edit and bibit, manducat vitam, and bibit vitam. Concedo etiam, quod nulla
promissio facta est pani and vino, quatenus sint Panis and vinum, verum
quatenus sanctificantur, and fiunt sacramenta corporis and sanguinis Domini,
habent annexam promissionem gratiae; (nimirum Communicationis spiritualis
corporis Christi) communicandae quidem, and largiendae non pani and Vino, sed
iis qui digne mysteriis participant.

Unus panis, and unum Corpus multi sumus, omnes Wiston.
qui de uno pane participamus. Quaero quomodo illud intelligis, de uno pane
materiali-ne? an de corpore naturali Christi?

De uno pane materiali, quod Sacramentaliter est Ridley.
Corpus Christi. Nam Ecclesia olim consuevit uti uno pane in mensa Domini, and
ille unus panis omnibus communicabatur qui simul in ea mensa accumbebant. Ita
Dionysius vocat Panem Individuum, and Cyprianus testatur illum significare
corpus Christi mysticum.

Quomodo possint omnes participare de uno pane? Wiston.


Omnes, qui in eadem mensa simul mysteria communicabant, Ridley.
been poterant. Quia and unus est Panis etiam caelestis, cujus hic panis
Sacramentalis est mysterium; quem sane eundem omnes spiritualiter participamus.

August. scribitur de David quod ferebatur in manibus Smith.
suis, and de David non invenitur quod ferebat se in manibus suis, de Christo
autem invenitur quod ferebat se in manibus suis: sed hoc factum est in ultima
caena, quum tradebat corpus suum suis Discipulis in Sacramento Altaris. Ergo in
Sacramento Altaris est verum Corpus Christi.

Respondit -- Quod sciam illum Locum Scripturae Ridley.
aliter ab aliis legi secundum veritatem Haebraicam, and aliter exponi; tamen
detur tibi Expositio Augustim, and dico quod meae sententiae nihil adversatur;
nam Christus ferebat sese in manibus suis dum sacramentum Corporis sui tradidit
Discipulis comedendum.

Dicit August. ad Literam, non invenitur de Davide, Smith.
and de Christo invenitur. Sed non invenitur, nisi quando instituit Sacramentum
Altaris, nisi in ultima caena. Ergo Christus ad Literam, and non secundum
figuram ferebat sese, and ita secundum substantiam, and non secundum figuram,
Christi Corpus est in Sacramento Altaris.

Concedo dictum esse ab August. quod de Davide non Ridley.
invenitur ad Literam quod ferebat sese in manibus suis, and quod de Christo
invenitur. Sed verbum illud [ad Literam] non recte refers ad id quod
portabatur, debet enim ad eum qui portabat referri - Sentit enim August. quod
nusquam legatur in Sacris Literis quod carnalis ipse David, filius Jesse,
portabat sese in manibus suis, sed de David spirituali, qui Goliath Diabolum

A Brief Treatise of the most blessed SACRAMENT of the Body and Blood of Christ.
THE PREFACE.
MANY Things confound the weak memory, a few places well weighed and proved
lighten the understanding. Truth is there to be searched with Diligence where
it is to be had. Tho God does speak the Truth by man, yet in man's word which
God has not revealed to be his, man may doubt without mistrust in God: Christ
is the Truth of God reveal d, unto man from Heaven by God himself, and
therefore in his word the truth is to be found, which is to be embraced of all
that be his. Christ bids us ask, and we shall have; search, and we shall
find; knock, and it shall be opened unto us. Therefore, O Heavenly Father!
Author and Fountain of all Truth, the bottomless sea of all true understanding,
send down, we beseech thee, thy holy Spirit into our Hearts, and lighten our
understanding with the beams of thy heavenly grace. We ask thee this, O
heavenly Father, not in respect of our deserts, but for thy dear Son our
Savior Jesus Christ's sake. Thou know O heavenly Father, that the
controversy about the blessed Body and Blood of thy dear Son our Savior
Christ, has troubled not of late only the Church of England, France, Germany
and Italy, but also many years ago. The fault is ours no doubt thereof, for we
have deserved thy Plague. But O Lord! be merciful and relieve our misery with
some light of grace. Thou know O Lord how the wicked World rolleth up and
down, and reeleth too and fro, and cares not what thy Will is, so it may abide
in wealth. If Truth have wealth then who is so stout to defend the Truth as
they? but if Christ's Cross be laid on Truth's back, then they vanish straight
away as wax before the fire. But these are not they, O Heavenly Father! for
whom I make my most moan, but for those silly ones, O Lord, which have a zeal
unto thee: those, I mean, which would and wish to know thy will, and yet are
let, holden back and blinded by the subtelties of Satan and his Ministers,
the wickedness of this wretched world, and the sinful lusts and affections of
the flesh. Alas Lord! thou know that we are of our selves but flesh,
wherein there dwells nothing that is good. How then is it possible for man,
without thee O Lord, to understand thy Truth indeed? Can the natural man
perceive the will of God? O Lord to whom thou give a zeal of thee, give them
also we beseech thee the knowledge of thy blessed Will: suffer not them O Lord
blindly to be led for to strive against thee, as thou did those, alas! which
crucified thine own dear Son. Forgive them O Lord! for thy dear Son's sake, for
they know not what they do. They do think alas, O Lord, for want of knowledge,
that they do unto thee good service, even when against thee they do extremely
rage. Remember O Lord we beseech thee, the Prayer of thy Martyr St. Stephen, of
thy holy Apostle Paul, which wishes him accursed from thee for the salvation
of his brethren the Jews. Remember O Heavenly Father! the Prayer of thy dear
Son upon the Cross, when he said to thee, O Father forgive them, they know not
what they do. With this forgiveness, O good Lord God, give me I beseech thee
thy grace, so briefly here to set forth the sayings and sentences of thy dear
Son our Savior Christ, of his Evangelists and Apostles, that in this foresaid
controversy the light of thy truth by the Lanthorn of thy word may shine to all
them that love thee.

Amen.
OF the Lords last Supper speak expressly three of the Evangelists, Matthew,
Mark, and Luke: but none more plainly and more fully declares the same than
does St. Paul, partly in the 10th. c. Cor. 1st As Matthew and Mark agree in
form of words, so does likewise Luke and Paul, but all four no doubt, as they
were altogether in one school, and inspired with one spirit, so taught they all
one truth. God grant us to understand it well. Matthew sets forth Christ's
supper thus, When Even was come he sat down with the Twelve; as they did eat,
Jesus took Bread, and gave thanks, brake it, and gave it to the Disciples and
said, take eat this is my Body: and he took the Cup, gave thanks and gave it to
them saying drink ye all of this, for this is my Blood of the new Testament
that is shed for many for the remission of Sins. I say unto you I will not
drink of the Vine-tree until that day when I shall drink it new in my Father's
Kingdom: and when they had said grace they went out.

Now Mark speaks it thus: And as they eat, Jesus took bread, blessed, and
brake it and gave it to them and said, take, eat, this is my Body: and he took
the Cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank of it, and he
said unto them, this is my Blood of the New Testament which is shed for many:
Verily I say unto you I will drink no more of the fruit of the Vine, until
that day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God.

Here Matthew and Mark do agree not only in the matter, but also almost fully
in the form of words, saving that for this word in Matthew. [gave thanks] Mark
has this word [blessed] which signifies in this place all one: and whereas
Mat. says [Drink ye all of this] Mark says [and they all drank of it] and
where Mat. says [of this fruit of the Vine] Mark leaves out the word [this]
and says [of the fruit of the Vine.] Now let us see likewise what agreement in
form of words is betwixt St. Luke and St. Paul, Luke writes thus.

He took Bread, gave thanks, brake it and gave it to them saying, this is my
Body, this do in Remembrance of me: likewise also when they had supped he took
the Cup saying, this Cup is the New Testament in my Blood which is shed for
you.

St. Paul sets forth Christ's Supper thus, The Lord Jesus in the same night
in the which he was betrayed took bread and gave thanks and brake, and said,
take, eat, this is my Body which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of
me. After the same manner he took the Cup when Supper was done saying, this Cup
is the New Testament in my Blood, this do as often as you drink it in
Remembrance of me, for as often as you shall eat this Bread, and drink this
Cup, you shall show the Lords Death until he come etc.

Here where Luke says [which is given] Paul says [which is broken] and as
Luke adds to the words of Paul spoken of the Cup [which is-shed for you] so
likewise Paul adds to the words of Luke this do as often as you shall drink
it in the remembrance of me; the rest that follows in St. Paul, both there,
and in the 10th Chap. pertains to the right use and doctrine of the Lord's
Supper.

Thus the Evangelists and St. Paul have rehearsed the words and Works of
Christ, whereby he did institute and ordain this holy Sacrament of his blessed
Body and Blood to be a perpetual remembrance of himself until his coming
again. Of himself, I say, that is of his Body given for us, and of his Blood
shed for the remission of sins.

But in this remembrance thus ordained, as the Author thereof is Christ both
God and Man, so by the almighty power of God it far passes all kinds of
Remembrance that any other man is able to make, either of himself, or of any
other thing. For whosoever receives this holy Sacrament thus ordained in
remembrance of Christ, he receives therewith either Death or Life. In this I
trust we do all agree, for St. Paul says of the godly receivers 1 Cor. 10th.
The Cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the partaking or Fellowship of
Christ's Blood? and also he says the Bread which we break (he means at the
Lord's Table) is it not the partaking, or fellowship of Christ's Body? now the
partaking of Christ's Body and Blood unto the faithful and godly, is the
partaking and fellowship of Life and immortality. And again of the bad and
ungodly receivers St. Paul as plainly says thus, He that eats of this Bread,
and drinks of this Cup unworthily, he is guilty of the Body and Blood of the
Lord. O how necessary then is it if we love Life and would eschew Death, to try
and examine our selves before we eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, for
else assuredly he that eats and drinks unworthily, eats and drinks his
own damnation, because he esteemed not the Lords Body; that is, he reverenceth
not the Lords body with the honor which is due unto him. And yet by that which
was said, that with the receipt of the Holy Sacrament of the blessed Body and
Blood of Christ is received of every one, good or bad, either Life or Death; it
is not meant that they which are dead before God, hereby may receive Life; or
the living before God can hereby receive Death. For as none is meet to receive
natural food whereby the natural life is nourished except he be born, and live
before, so no man can feed by the receipt of this holy Sacrament, of the food of
eternal Life, except he be regenerated, and born of God before; and on the
other side, no man here receives damnation which is not dead before.

Thus, hitherto, without all doubt, God is my witness (I say so far as I know)
there is no controversy among them that be learned in the Church of England,
concerning the matter of this Sacrament, but all do agree, whether they be new
or old: and to speak plain, as some do odiously call each other, whether they
be Protestants, Papists, Pharisees, or Gospellers. And as all do agree hitherto
in the aforesaid Doctrine, so all do detest, abhor and condemn the wicked
Heresy of the Messalians, which otherwise be called Trip. Hist. Lib. 7. cap. 11.
Euchits, which said that the holy Sacrament can neither do good nor harm.

All do also condemn the wicked Anabaptists, which puts no difference
betwixt the Lords Table, and the Lords meat, and their own.

And forasmuch as Charity would, if it be possible, and so far as we may with
the safeguard of good Conscience, and maintenance of the Truth, to agree with
all men, therefore methinks that it is not charitably done to burden any man,
either new or old, farther than such do declare themselves to dissent from that
we are persuaded to be the Truth, or pretend there to be controversies whereas
none such are indeed, and so to multiply the debate, the which the more it does
increase, the farther it does depart from the unity that the true Christian
should desire.

And again this is true, that Truth neither needs, nor will be maintained
with lies, and it is sin to lie against the Devil, for tho by the ly thou do
seem never so much to speak against the Devil, yet in that thou lie indeed
thou workest the Devils work; thou do him service, and take the Devils
part.

Now then, whether they do godly and charitably, which either by their pen in
writing, or by their words in preaching, do bear the simple people in hand that
those which thus do teach, and believe, do go about to make the holy Sacrament
ordained by Christ himself a thing no better than a piece of common broken
bread, or that do say, that such do make this Sacrament of the blessed Body and
Blood of Christ but a bare sign or figure to represent Christ, none otherwise
than an Ivy-Bush does represent the Wine in a Tavern, or as a vile person
gorgeously apparrell'd may represent a King or a Prince in a Play: Alas! let
us leave lying and speak the truth every man not only to his neighbor, but
also of his neighbor; for we are members one of another, says St. Paul.

The controversy no doubt which at this day troubles the Church (wherein any
mean learned man either old or new, does stand in) is not whether the holy
Sacrament of the blessed Body and Blood of Christ is no better than a piece of
common bread or no, or whether the Lords Table be no more to be regarded than
the table of any earthly man or no, or whether it be a bare sign or figure of
Christ and nothing else or no, for all do grant that St. Paul's words do require
that the Bread which we brake is the partaking of the Body of Christ, and also
all do grant him that eats of that Bread and drinks of that Cup unworthily,
to be guilty of the Lords Death, and to eat and drink his own damnation,
because he esteemed not the Lords Body. All do grant that these words of Paul
when he says [if we eat, it advantageth us nothing, or if we eat not, we want
nothing thereby] are not spoken of the Lord's Table, but of other common meats.
Thus then hitherto yet we all agree, but now let us see wherein the Dissension
does stand: the understanding of it wherein it does chiefly stand, is a step to
the true searching forth of the Truth, for who can seek well a Remedy if he
know not before the Disease?

It is neither to be denied nor dissembled that in the matter of this Sacrament
there be diverse points wherein men counted to be learned cannot agree; as
whether there be any. Transubstantiation of the Bread or no? any corporal and
carnal presence of Christ's Substance or no? whether adoration due only unto
God, is to be done to the Sacrament or no? and whether Christ's body be there
indeed offered unto the heavenly Father by the Priest or no? or whether the
evil man receives the natural Body of Christ or no? yet nevertheless, as in a
man diseased in diverse parts, commonly the original cause of such diverse
diseases which are spread abroad in the body, do come from some one chief
member, as from the stomach, or from the head; even so all those five aforesaid
points do chiefly hang upon this one question which is, What is the matter of
the Sacrament? whether is it the natural substance of Bread, or the natural
substance of Christ's own Body. The truth of this question truly tried out and
agreed upon, no doubt shall cease the controversy in all the rest. For if it be
Christ's own natural Body, born of the Virgin, then assuredly (seeing that all
learned men in England both new and old grant there to be but one substance)
then I say, they must needs grant Transubstantiation, that is, a change of the
substance of bread into the substance of Christ's body. Then also they must
grant the carnal and corporal presence of Christ's body. Then must the Sacrament
be adored with the Honor due unto Christ himself, for the unity of the two
natures in one person. Then if the Priest do offer the Sacrament, he does offer
indeed Christ himself. And finally the murderer, the adulterer, and wicked man
receiving the Sacrament, must needs then receive also the natural substance of
Christ's own blessed Body both Flesh and Blood.

Now on the other side, if after the truth shall be truly tried out, it be
found that the substance of the Bread is the material substance of the
Sacrament, although for the change of the use, office, and dignity of the Bread,
the Bread indeed sacramentally is changed into the body of Christ, as the water
of Baptism is changed into the fountain of regeneration, and yet the material
substance thereof remains all one as was before, If, I say, the true solution
of that former question (whereupon all these controversies do hang) be, that
the natural substance of Bread is the material substance in the holy Sacrament
of Christ's body, then must it follow of that former proposition, (confessed of
all that be named to be learned, so far as I do know, in England,) which is,
That there is but one material substance in the Sacrament of the Body, and one
only, likewise in the Sacrament of the Blood) that there is no such thing
indeed and in truth as they call Transubstantiation. For the Substance of Bread
remains still in the Sacrament of the Body: then also the natural substance
of Christ's human nature which he took of the Virgin Mary is in Heaven, where it
reigns now in glory, and not here enclosed under the form of Bread: then that
godly Honor which is only due unto God the Creator, and may not be done unto
the creature without Idolatry, and Sacrilege, is not to be done unto the holy
Sacrament. Then also the wicked, (I mean the impenitent) murderer, adulterer,
or such like, do not receive the natural Substance of the blessed body and
blood of Christ. Finally then does follow, that Christ's blessed Body, which was
once only offered and shed upon the Cross, being available for the sins of all
the World; is offered up no more in the natural substance there of neither by
the Priest, nor any otherthing.

But here, before we go any farther to search in this matter, and to wade to
search and try out, as we may, the truth thereof in the Scripture, it shall do
well by the way -- Whether they that thus make answer and solution unto the
former principal Question, do take away simply and absolutely the presence of
Christ's Body and Blood from the Sacrament, ordained by Christ, and duly
ministered, according to his holy Ordinance and Institution of the same.
Undoubtedly they do deny That utterly, either so to say or to mean the same:
and hereof, if any man do, or will doubt, the Books which are written already
in this matter of them that thus do answer will make the matter plain.

Now then, will ye say, what kind of presence will they grant, and what do they
deny? Briefly they deny the presence of Christ's Body in the natural substance
of his human, and assumpt nature, and grant the presence of the same by Grace,
that is: They affirm and say that the substance of the natural body and blood
of Christ is only remaining in Heaven, and so shall be until the latter day,
when he shall come again in glory accompanied with the angels of Heaven to
judge both the quick and the dead. And the same natural substance of the very
Body and Blood of Christ, because it is united to the divine nature in Christ
the second person in the Trinity, therefore it has not only Life in it self,
but is also able, and does give life unto so many as be, or shall be partakers
thereof; that is to all that do believe in his name, which are not born of
blood, (as John says) or of the will of flesh, or of the will of man, but are
born of God, tho the self same substance abide still in Heaven, and they, for
the time of their Pilgrimage, dwell here upon Earth. By Grace I said, that is
by the gift of this life mentioned in John, and the properties for the same,
meet for a Pilgrimage here upon Earth, the same body of Christ is here present
with us. As for example; we say the Sun which in substance never removes his
place out of the Heavens, is yet present here by his Beams, Light, and natural
Influence where it shines upon the Earth: for Gods word, and his Sacraments be
as it were the Beams of Christ, who is Sol Justitiae.

Thus thou have heard wherein does stand the principal state and chief point of
all the Controversies which do properly pertain unto the nature of this
Sacrament. As for the use thereof, I grant there be many other things, whereof
here I have spoken of nothing at all.

And now, least thou justly may complain and say, that I have in opening
this matter done nothing else but dug a Pit, and have not shut it up again,
or broken a Gap and have not made it up, or opened the Book, and have not
closed it again, or else to call me what they list, as neutrall, Dissembler,
etc. Therefore here now I will by Gods Grace not only shortly, but also so
clearly, and plainly as I can, make thee now to know whether of the aforesaid
two Answers to the former principal state and chief point does like me best.
Yea and also I will hold all those accursed which in this matter, which now so
troubles the Church of Christ, have of God received the Key of Knowledge, and
yet go about to shut up the Doors, that they themselves will not enter in, nor
suffer others that would. And as for my own part, I consider both of late what
cure, and charge of Souls has bin committed unto me, whereof God knows how
soon I shall be called to give an Account, and also now in this world, what
peril and danger of the Laws concerning my Life I am now in at this present
time: what folly were it to dissemble with God, of whom assuredly, I look and
hope by Christ to have everlasting life. Seeing that such charge and danger both
before God and man do compass me in round about on every side, therefore God
willing, I will frankly and freely utter my mind: and tho my body be Captive,
yet my Tongue and my Pen, as long as I may, shall freely set forth that which
undoubtedly I am persuaded to be the Truth of Gods word. And yet will I do it
under this Protestation (call me a Protestant who list, I do not pass thereof)
my Protestation shall be this that my mind is, and ever shall be, God willing,
to set forth sincerely the true sense and meaning, to the best of my
understanding, of God's most holy word, and not to decline from the same,
either by fear of worldly danger, or else for hope of gain. I do protest also
due obedience and submission of my judgment in this my writing, and in all
other mine affairs, unto those of Christ's Church which be truly learned in Gods
holy word, and guided by his Spirit. After this Protestation, I do plainly
affirm, and say, that the second answer made unto the chief Question and
principal point I am persuaded to be the very true meaning and sense of Gods
holy word: That is, that the natural Substance of Bread and Wine is the true
material substance of the holy Sacrament of the blessed Body and Blood of our
Savior Christ: and the places of Scripture whereupon this my Faith is grounded
be these, both concerning the Sacrament of the Body, and also of the Blood.
First let us repeat the beginning of the Institution of the Lords Supper,
wherein all the three Evangelists and St. Paul do agree saying -- That Jesus
took Bread, gave thanks, brake, and gave it to the Disciples, saying -- Take,
Eat, this is my Body. Here it appears plainly that Christ called very Bread
his Body. For that which he took was very Bread. In this all men do agree; and
that which he took, after he had given thanks, he brake, and that which he took
and brake, he gave it to his Disciples, and that which he took, brake, and gave
to his Disciples, he said himself of it -- This is my Body. So it appears
plainly, that Christ called very Bread his Body: But very Bread cannot be his
very Body in very Substance thereof, therefore it must needs have another
meaning, which meaning appears plainly what it is by the next sentence that
follows immediately both in Luke, and in Paul, and that is this -- Do this in
remembrance of me; whereupon it seems unto me to be evident, that Christ did
take Bread and called it his Body, for that he would institute thereby a
perpetual Remembrance of his Body: specially of that singular benefit of our
Redemption, which he would then procure and purchase unto us by his Body upon
the Cross. But Bread retaining still its own very natural substance may be thus
by grace, and in a sacramental signification His Body, whereas else the very
Bread which he took, brake, and gave them could not be in any wise his natural
body, for that were confusion of substances, and therefore the very words of
Christ, joined to the next sentence following, both enforces us to confess the
very bread to remain still, and also opens unto us how that Bread may be, and
is thus by his divine power his body which was given for us.

But here I remember that I have read in some writers of the contrary opinion,
which do deny that That which Christ did take he brake; For, say they, after
this taking [he blessed it] as Mark does speak, and by his Blessing he changed
the natural substance of the Bread into the natural substance of his Body. And
so, although he took the bread, and blessed it, yet because in blessing it he
changed the substance of it, he broke not the bread which then was not there,
but only the form thereof. Unto this Objection I have two plain answers, both
grounded upon Gods word. The one I will rehearse here, the other answer I will
defer until I speak of the Sacrament of the Blood. Mine answer here is taken
out of the plain words of St. Paul, which does manifestly confound this
fantastical invention; first invented, I ween, of Pope Innocentius and after
confirmed by the subtle sophist Dunse, and lately renewed now in our Days with
an eloquent style, and much fineness of wit. But what can crafty Inventions,
subtilty in Sophisms, Eloquence or fineness of Wit prevail against the
infallible word of God? What need we to contend and strive what thing we break,
for Paul says, speaking undoubtedly of the Lords Table -- The Bread (says he)
which we break, is it not the partaking or fellowship of the Lords Body?
whereupon it follows that after the Thanksgiving it is Bread which we break.
And how often in the Acts of the Apostles is the Lords Supper signified by
breaking of Bread. They did per severe in breaking of Bread. And again -- They
brake Bread in every house. And again -- When they were come together to break
Bread. St. Paul who sets forth most fully in his writing both the doctrine
and the right use of the Lord's Supper, and the Sacramental eating and drinking
of Christ's Body and Blood, called it 5 times Bread, Bread etc.

The second Reason: The Sacramental Bread is the mystical body, and so is
called in Scripture 1. Cor. 10. as it is called the natural Body of Christ. But
Christ's mystical Body is the Congregations of the Christians. Now no man was
ever so fond as to say that That Sacramental Bread is Transubstantiated, and
changed into the substance of the Congregation. Wherefore no man should
likewise think or say that the Bread is Transubstantiated and changed into the
natural substance of Christ's human nature. But my mind is not here to write
what may be gathered out of Scriptures for this purpose, but only to note here
briefly those which seem unto me to be the most plain places. Therefore,
contented to have spoken thus much of the Sacramental Bread, now I will speak a
little of the Lords Cup.

And this shall be my third argument grounded upon Christ's own words.

The natural substance of the Sacramental Wine remains still, and is the
material substance of the Sacrament of the Blood of Christ. Therefore it is
likewise so in the Sacramental Bread. I know that he that is of the contrary
opinion will deny the former part of my argument. But I will prove it thus by
the plain words of Christ himself, both in Matthew and in Mark. Christ's words be
these, after the words said upon the Cup - I say unto you, says Christ, I will
not drink henceforth of this fruit of the Vine-tree, until I shall drink that
anew in my Fathers Kingdom. Here note how Christ calls plainly his Cup the
Fruit of the Vinetree: but the fruit of the Vine-tree is very natural Wine:
wherefore the very natural substance of the Wine does remain still in the
Sacrament of Christ's Blood.

And here in speaking of the Lord's Cup, it comes to my remembrance the vanity
of Innocentius fantastical Invention, which by Paul's words I did confute
before, and here did promise somewhat more to speak; and that is thus. If the
Transubstantiation be made by this word [Blessed] in Mark said upon the Bread,
then surely seeing that word is not said of Christ, (neither of any of the
Evangelists, nor of Paul) upon the Cup, then there is no Transubstantiation of
the Wine at all: For where the cause does fail, there cannot follow the Effect.
But the Sacramental Bread, and the Sacramental Wine do both remain in their
natural Substance alike, and if the one be not changed, (as of the Sacramental
Wine it appears evidently,) then is there no such Transubstantiation in
either of them both.

All that put and affirm this change of the substance of Bread and Wine into
the substance of Christ's Body and Blood (called Transubstantiation) do also
say and affirm this change to be made by a certain form of prescript words and
none others: but what they be which make the change, either of the one or of
the other, undoubtedly even they which write most sincerely in these our days,
almost confess plainly that they cannot tell. For although they grant to certain
old Authors, as Chrysostom and Ambrose, that these words -- This is my Body,
are the words of Consecration of the Sacrament of the Body; yet say they, these
words may well be so called, because they do assure us of the consecration
thereof whether it be done before these words be spoken or no. But as for this
their doubt concerning the Sacrament of the Body I let it pass.

Let us now consider the words which pertain unto the Cup. This is first
evident, that as Matthew much agrees with Mark, and Luke with Paul, in form of
words concerning the Sacrament of the Body; so in this Sacrament of the Cup the
form of words in Matthew and Mark is diverse from that which is in Luke and
Paul. The old Authors do most rehearse the form of words in Matthew, and Mark;
because, I ween, they seemed to them more clear: But here I would know whether
it is not credible or no, that Luke and Paul, when they celebrated the Lords
Supper with their Congregations, that they did not use the same form of words
at the Lord's Table which they wrote? Of Luke, because he was a Physician,
whether some will grant that he might be a Priest or no, and was able to
receive the order of Priesthood (which they say is given by virtue of these
words said by the Bishop - Take thou Authority to Sacrifice for the Quick and
Dead) I cannot tell: but if they should be so straight upon Luke, either for
his craft, or else for lack of such power given unto him by virtue of the
aforesaid words, then I ween, both Peter and Paul are in danger to be deposed
of their Priesthood; for the craft either of Fishing which was Peter's, or of
making Tents, which was Paul's, were more vile than the science of Physic; and
as for these Sacramental words of the order of Priesthood, to have authority to
Sacrifice both for the quick and the dead, I ween Peter and Paul, if they were
both alive, were not able to prove that ever Christ gave them such Authority,
or ever said any such words unto them. But I will let Luke go, and because Paul
speaks more for him himself, I will rehearse his words, That which I received
of the Lord I gave unto you, for the Lord Jesus etc. and so he fetteth forth
the whole institution and right use of the Lords Supper; now seeing Paul here
says that he received of the Lord that which he gave them, and that which he
had received and given them before by word of mouth, now he reherseth, and
writes the same in his Epistle; it is credible, that Paul would never have
used this form of words upon the Lords Cup, except as he says, he had received
them of the Lord; and that he had given them before, and now reherseth the same
in his Epistle. I trust no man is so far from reason, but he will grant me that
Paul did use the form of words which he writes, let us then consider Paul's
words which he says Christ spoke upon the Cup, This Cup is the New Testament
in my Blood; this do as often as you shall drink it in remembrance of me. Here
I would know whether that Christ's words spoken upon the Cup were not as mighty
in work, and as effectual in signification as they that were spoken upon the
Bread. If this be granted (which I think no man can deny) then further I reason
thus. But the word [Is] in the words spoken upon the Lords bread does mightily
signify, (say they) the change of the substance of that which goes before it,
into the substance of that which follows after; that is of the substance of
bread into the substance of Christ's body. Now then, when Christ's words spoken
upon the Cup be of the same might, and power both in working and signifying,
then must this word [Is] when Christ says this Cup [is] the New Testament etc.
turn the substance of the Cup into the substance of the New Testament. And if
thou will say that this word [Is] neither makes, neither signifies any such
change of the Cup, and that although it be said of Christ that this Cup is the New
Testament, yet Christ meant no such change as That; Marry Sr, even so say I
when Christ said of the Bread which he took, and after thanksgiving brake, and
gave them saying take, eat, this is my Body, he meant no more any such change
of the Bread into the substance of his natural Body than he meant of the change
and Transubstantiation of the Cup into the substance of the New Testament; and
if thou will say that the word (Cup) here in Christ's words does not signify the
Cup it self, but the Wine or thing contained in the Cup, by a figure called
Metonymia, (for that Christ's words meant, and so must needs be taken) thou
say very well; but I pray thee by the way here note two things. First, that
this word (Is) has no such strength or signification in the Lords words to
make or signify any Transubstantiation. Secondly; That in the Lords words
whereby he instituted the Sacrament of his Blood he used a Figurative speech.
How vain then is it that some say that Christ in Doctrine, and in the
Institution of the Sacraments, used no Figures, but all his words are to be
strained to their proper signification; when as here, neither That was in the
Cup, nor the Cup it self, (taking every word in its proper signification) was
the New Testament. Thus in one sentence spoken of Christ, the figure must help
us twice.

But some say if we shall thus admit figures in Doctrine, then shall all the
Articles of our Faith by figures and allegories shortly be transformed. I say
it is like fault, and even the same, to deny the figure when the place so
requires; as vainly to make It a figurative speech which is to be understood
in its proper signification. The rule whereby it is known when the speech is
figurative, and when it is none St. Aug. in his Book de Doctrina Christi lib.
3. chapter 16. gives diverse learned Lessons, of the which one is this - If (says
he) the Scripture does seem to command a thing which is wicked or ungodly, or
to forbid a thing that Charity does require, then know you that the speech is
figurative. As for example, he brings the saying of Christ, the 6th of John
Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, ye can have no
Life in you. It seems to command a wicked or ungodly thing, wherefore it is a
figurative speech, commanding to have communion or fellowship with Christ's
passion, and devoutly and wholsomly to lay up in memory that his flesh was
crucified and wounded for us. This Lesson of St. Aug. I have therefore the
rather set forth, because as it teaches us to understand that place in John
figuratively; even so surely the same Lesson with the example of St. Aug.
Exposition thereof, teaches us not only by the same to understand Christ's
words in the institution of the Sacrament both of his Body and of his Blood
figuratively, but also the very true meaning and understanding of the same. For
if to command to eat the flesh of the Son of man, and to drink his blood
seems to command an inconvenience, or an ungodly thing, and is even so indeed
if it be understood as the words do stand in their proper signification, and
therefore must be understood figuratively and spiritually (as St. Aug. does
learnedly and godly interpret them) then surely Christ commanding in his last
Supper to eat his Body and to drink his Blood, seems to command in sound of
words as great, and even the same inconvenience and ungodliness as did his
words in the sixth Chapter of St. John; and therefore must even by the same
reason be likewise understood and expounded figuratively, and spiritually, and
as St. Aug did the other. Whereunto the same exposirion of St. Aug. may seem to
be more meet, for that Christ in his Supper to the commandment of eating and
drinking his Blood adds - Do this in remembrance of me: which words surely
were the Key that opened and revealed this spiritual and godly exposition unto
St. Aug. But I have tarried longer in setting forth the form of Christ's words
upon the Lords Cup written by Paul and Luke then I did intend to do.

And yet here comes to my remembrance the form of words used in the Latin Mass
upon the Lords Cup, whereof I do not a little marvel what should be the cause,
that seeing the Latin Mass agrees with the Evangelists and Paul in the form of
words said upon the Bread, why in the form of words said upon the Cup it
differs from them all; yea and adds these words mysterium Fidei; yea, and
if they might have some good exposition, yet why it should not be as well added
unto the words of Christ upon the Bread as upon the Cup. Surely I do not see
the mystery. And when I see in the Latin Mass the sacrament of the Blood
abused when it is denied unto the Layman, clean contrary to Gods most certain
words, for why, I beseech thee, should the Sacrament of Christ's Blood be denied
unto the Lay-Christian, more than to the Priest? Did not Christ shed his Blood
as well for the Lay Godly man, as for the Godly Priest? If thou will say yes,
he did so, but yet the Sacrament of the Blood is not to be received without the
offering up and sacrificing thereof unto God the Father both for the quick and
for the dead, and no man may make oblation of Christ's Blood unto God, but a
Priest, and therefore the Priest, and that but in his Mass only, may receive
the Sacrament of his Blood. And call you this, Masters, Mysterium Fidei? alas
alas! I fear me this is before God mysterium Iniquitatis; such as St. Paul
speaks of in his Epistle to the Thessalonians. The Lord be merciful unto us,
and bless us, and lighten his countenance upon us and be merciful unto us, that
we may know thy way upon earth, and among all people thy Salvation.

This kind of Oblations stands upon Transubstantiation his German-cousin, and
do grow both upon one ground. The Lord weed out of his vineyard shortly that
bitter root.

To speak of this Oblation, how much it is injurious to Christ's Passion, how it
cannot but with highest blasphemy, heinous arrogance, and intolerable pride be
claimed of any man other then of Christ himself: how much and plainly it
repugneth unto the manifest words, the true sense and meaning of holy
Scripture, in many places, and especially in the Epistle to the Hebrews; the
matter is too long, and others have written in it at large, that my mind is now
not to entreat thereof any further.

Yet there remains one vain Quiddity of Dunse in this matter, the which
because some that write now do like it so well that they have stripped it out
of Dunse's dusty, and dark Terms, and pricked and painted it in fresh colors of
eloquent style, and therefore may deceive more except the error be warily
eschewed.

Dunse says in these words of Christ This is my Body, that this Pronoun
Demonstrative, meaning the word (this) if you will know what it does show or
demonstrate whether the Bread that Christ took, or no, he answers no, but
only one thing in substance it points, whereof the nature or name it does not
tell, but leaves that to be determined and told by That that follows the
word [is] that is by the Praedicatum as the Logicians does speak; and therefore
he calls this pronoun demonstrative Individuumvagum, that is, a wandering
proper name, whereby we may point out, and show any one thing in substance,
whatsoever it be. That this Imagination is untruly applied unto those words of
Christ- this is my Body, and the vanity thereof, may appear plainly by the
words of Luke and Paul, said upon the Cup in Matthew and Mark. For as upon the
Bread it is said of all this is my Body, so of Matthew and Mark it is said of
the Cup - this is my Blood. Then if in the words - this is my Body the word
This be, as Dunse calls it, a wandering name to appoint and show forth any one
thing where of the name or nature it does not tell, so must it be likewise in
those words of Matthew and Mark upon the Lords Cup -this is my Blood. But in
the words of Matthew and Mark, it signifies and points out the same that it
does in the Lords words upon the Cup in Luke, and Paul, when it is said - This
Cup is the New Testament in my Blood. Therefore in Matthew and Mark the pronoun
Demonstrative This does not wander to point one thing in substance not showing
what it is, but tells it plainly what it is no less in Matthew and Mark unto
the Eye, then is done in Luke, and Paul by putting to this word Cup both unto
the Eye and to the Ear. For taking the Cup and demonstrating, or showing it
unto his Disciples by this pronoun Demonstrative - This, and saying unto them
Drink ye all of this, it was then all one to say - This is my Blood, as to say,
This Cup is my Blood, meaning by the Cup, as the nature of the speech does
require, the thing contained in the Cup. So likewise, without all doubt, when
Christ had taken bread, given thanks, and broken it, and giving it to his
Disciples said - Take, Eat, and so demonstrating and showing that Bread which
he had in his Hands, to say then This is my Body, and to have said This Bread
is my Body is all one thing; as it were all one if a man lacking a knife, and
going to his Oysters would say unto another whom he saw to have two Knives, Sir
I pray you lend me the one of your Knives; were it not now all one to answer
him Sir, hold, I will lend you [this] to eat your meat, but not to open Oysters
withal; and -- Hold, I will lend you this Knife to eat your meat, but not to
open Oysters? This Similitude serves but for this purpose, to declare the
nature of speech withal, whereas the thing that is demonstrated and showed is
evidently perceived and openly known unto the Eye. But, O Good Lord? what
wonderful thing it is to see how some men do labor to teach what is
demonstrated, and showed by the pronoun Demonstrative - This - in Christ's
words, when he says -- This is my Body, This is my Blood. And here the
Transubstantiators do not agree among themselves, no more than they do about
the words which work the Transubstantiation; some attributing the work unto the
word - Benedixit; and the most part to [Hoc est corpus meum.] Innocentius
therefore, Duns, and that Sect, which puts the change in the word -
Benedixit - say, that this word - This, was then indeed Christ's Body, though the
word did not import so much, but only one thing in substance, which (after
Duns, now the Bread being gone) must needs be the substance of Christ's Body. The
other which do say that this change is made, when the whole Sentence - This is
my Body - is fully finished, and not before, cannot but say, that Christ's This
did demonstrate, and show Bread indeed, which so remained till the Sentence was
fully pronounced. But how can they make and verify Christ's words to be true,
demonstrating the substance of Bread, and saying thereof - This is my Body;
that is, as they say, the Natural substance of Christ's Body, except they will
say, that the Verb (is) fignifieth is made, or is changed into, and then, in
Christ's words upon the Cup rehearsed by Luke and Paul, the Cup, or the Wine in
the Cup, must be made, or turned into the New Testament, as was declared
before. There be some amongst the Transubstantiators, which would! be
Mediators, yea, rather Newtrals, or Ambidexters, which can shift on both sides;
for where the one says that this word This demonstrateth the substance of
Bread, the other says, No, not so; the Bread is gone, and it demonstrateth a
substance which is Christ's Body. Tush, says this third Man, Ye understand
nothing at all; They agree well enough in the chief point, which is the ground
of all, that is this: Both do agree, and bear witness that there is
Transubstantiation. They do agree indeed in that Conclusion, but their proof
and Doctrine thereof do even as well agree together as did the false Witnesses
before Annas and Caiaphas against Christ, or the wicked Judges to condemn
Susanna; for they did all agree to speak against Christ, and the wicked Judges
to condemn poor Susanna, but in the Examination of their Witnesses they were
found false, and clean contrary one to the other.

Thus much have I spoken in searching out a solution to this principal
Question, which was, - What was the Material Substance of the Holy Sacrament in
the Lords Supper?

Now lest I should seem to set by my own Conceit more than is meet, I have
thought good to establish this mine Answer and Opinion by the Authority and
Doctrine of the old Ecclesiastical Doctors; such, I mean, as were before the
wicked Usurpations of the Sea of Rome, grown so immeasurably great, that not
only with Tyrannical Power, but also with Corrupt Doctrine it began to subvert
Christ's Gospel, and to turn the state of the Church set by Christ and his
Apostles clean upside down. And I will rehearse but few of them, that is three
old Writers of the Greek Church and three of the Latin Church, which do seem
unto me to be in this matter so plain, that in reading of them no man can be
ignorant in this matter, but he which will shut up his own eyes and blindfold
himself. The Greek Authors are Origin, Chrysostom, and Theodoret; the Latin
are Tertullian, St. Augustine, and Gelasius. And first let us hear the old
Writers of the Greek Church. Origin, who lived above Twelve hundred and fifty
years ago, a Man for the excellency of his Learning so highly esteemed in
Christ's Church, that he was counted and judged the singular Teacher in his time
of Christ's Religion; the Confounder of Heresies, the Schoolmaster of many godly
Matters, and an Opener of the high Mysteries in Scripture. He writing upon the
Fifteenth Chapter of St. Matthews Gospel, says thus, -- But if any thing enter
into the Mouth it goes away into the Stomach and Belly, and is voided into the
Draught; yea, and that Meat which is sanctified by the Word of God and Prayer,
as concerning the matter thereof it goes away into the Belly, and is avoided
into the Draught, but for the Prayer which is added unto it, for the proportion
of the Faith, it is made profitable, making the mind able to perceive, and see
that which is profitable: for it is not the Material substance of the Bread,
but the Word which is spoken upon it that is profitable to the Man that eats
it not unworthily, -- And this I mean of the Typical and Symbolical, that is
Sacramental Body.

Thus far goes the words of Origin, wherein it is plain, that Origin speaking
here of the Lords Supper, does mean and teach, that the Material substance
thereof is received, digested, and avoided as the Material substance of other
Bread and Meats is, which could not be, if there were no Material substance of
Bread at all, as the Transubstantiators do say.

It is a World to see the Answers of the Papists to this place of Origin. They
say that this part of Origin was but set forth of late by Erasmus, and
therefore it is to be suspected. But thus may all the good old Authors which
lay in old Libraries, and are set forth of late, be by this reason rejected: as
Clemens Alexandrinus, Theodoretus, Justinus, Ecclesiastica Historia Nicephori,
and others such. - Another of their Answers is, that Origin was suspected to
have erred in some points, and therefore Faith is not to be given to him in
this matter. Indeed we grant that Origin in some points did err, but these
Errors are gathered out and noted, both of St. Hierome and Epiphanius, so that
his Works, those Errors excepted, are so much the more of Authority. And as
concerning this matter of the Lords Supper, neither they, nor yet ever any
other ancient Author did ever say that Origin did err.

Now because these two Answers have been of late so confuted and confounded
that they will take no place, therefore some which have written since that time
have forged two other Answers, even of the same mould. The former whereof is,
-- That Origin in this place spoke not of the Sacramental Bread or Wine of the
Lords Table, but of other Mystical Meat, of the which St. Augustine makes
mention to be given to them that were taught the Faith before they were
Baptized. But Origens own words in two Sentences before rehearsed, being put
together, prove this Answer untrue: For he says, that he means of that
Figurative and Mystical Body which profits them that do receive it worthily;
alluding so plainly unto St. Paul's words spoken of the Lords Supper, that it is
a shame for any Learned Man to open his mouth to the contrary. And that Bread
which St. Augustine speaks of, he cannot prove that any such thing was used in
Origens time; yea, and though that could be proved, yet was there never Bread
in any time called a Sacramental Body, saving the Sacramental Bread of the
Lords Table, which is called of Origin the Typical and Symbolical Body of
Christ. -- The second of the two new found Answers is yet most monstrous of all
others, which is this -- Let us grant, say they, that Origin spoke of the Lords
Supper, and that by the matter thereof was understood the Material Substance of
Bread and Wine; What then, say they, for tho the Material substance was once
gone and departed by reason of Transubstantiation whilst the form of Bread and
Wine did remain, yet now it is no Inconvenience to say, that as the Material
substance did depart at the entering in of Christ's Body, under the foresaid
forms, so when the said forms be destroyed, and do not remain, then comes
again the substance of Bread and Wine: and this, say they, is very meet in this
Mystery, that That which began with Miracle shall end with a Miracle. -- But
this Fancy lacks all ground either of Gods Word, Reason, or any Ancient
Writer, and clean contrary to the common Rules of School Divinity, which are,
that no Miracle is to be affirmed and put without Necessity: And although for
their former Miracle they have some ground, although it be but vain, yet to make
this second Miracle of returning of the Material Bread again, they have no
color at all; or else, I pray thee, show me by what words of Christ is that
second Miracle wrought. Thus you may see, that the sleights and shifts which
craft and wit can invent to wrest the true sense of Origin, cannot take place.
-- But now let us hear another place of Origin, and so let him pass. Origin in
the 11th Cap. sup. Levit. says, -- That there is also, even in the four
Gospels, and not only in the Old Testament, a Letter, meaning a Literal sense,
which kills; for if thou follow, says he, the Letter in that saying --
Except ye eat the Flesh of the Son of Man and drink his Blood, etc. This Letter
does kill. -- If in that place the Letter does kill, wherein is commanded the
eating of Christ's Flesh, then surely in those words of Christ, wherein Christ
commands us to eat his Body, the literal sense thereof does kill; for it is
no less Crime, but even the same, and all one in the literal sense, to eat
Christ's Body, and to eat Christ's Flesh. Wherefore if the one does kill, unless
it be understood Figuratively and Spiritually, then the other also does kill
likewise.

The Papists answer is this, - That unto the Carnal man the literal sense is
hurtful, but not so to the Spiritual: As though to understand that in its proper
sense which ought to be taken Figuratively, were to the Carnal dangerous, and
to the Spiritual not at all.

Now to Chrysostom, whom I bring in for my second Author in the Greek Church.
He speaking against the ungodly using of Man's body, which after St. Paul ought
to be kept pure and holy, as the very Temple of the holy Ghost; says thus -
Cap. 5. Hom. 11. operis Imperfecti.

-- If it be a fault, says he, to translate the hallowed Chrysostom.
Vessels in the which is not contained the true Body of Christ, but the Mystery
of his Body, to private uses; how much more amiss is it to abuse and defile the
Vessels of our Bodies? -- These be the words of Chrysostom. But I know that
here many foul shifts are found to defeat this place. The Author, says one, is
suspected: I answer, but in this place, never fault was found with him unto
these our days. And whether this Author was John Chrysostom himself, the
Archbishop of Constantinople, or no, that is not the matter, for of all it is
granted, that he was a Writer of that Age, and a Man of great Learning, so that
it is manifest, that this which he writes was the received Opinion of Learned
men in his days.

If that solution will not serve (says another) we may say, that Chrysostom
did not speak of the Vessels of the Lords Cup, or such as were then used at the
Lords Table, but of the Vessel used in the Temple in the old Law. -- But here
Chrysostom speaks of such Vessels wherein was that which is called the Body
of Christ, although it was not the true Body, says he, of Christ, but the
Mystery of Christ's Body. And Erasmus declares plainly, that this saying of
this Writer is none otherwise to be understood.

Yet can I, says the third Papist, find out a fine and subtle solution for
this place, and say, that Christ's Body is not contained in those Vessels at the
Lords Table as in a place, but as in a Mystery; -- Is not this a pretty shift,
and a mystical solution? But by the same Solution, then Christ's Body is not in
the Lords Table, nor in the Priests Hand, nor in his Pixe, and so he is
nowhere; for they will not say, that he is either here or there, as in a
place. This answer pleases so well the maker, that he himself, after that he
has played with it a little while, and showed the fineness of his wit and
eloquence therein, he is contented to give it over, and say -- That it is not
to be thought that Chrysostom would speak after this fineness or subtilty, and
so returns again to the second answer for his Sheet-Anchor, which is already
sufficiently answered.

Another short place of Chrysostom I will rehearse, which (if any Indifferency
may be heard) in plain terms sets forth the truth of this matter. Writing Ad
Caesarem Monachum, Before the Bread, says he, be hallowed, we call it Bread,
but the Grace of God sanctifying it by the means of the Priest, it is delivered
now from the name of Bread, and esteemed worthy to be called Christ's Body,
although the nature of Bread abide in it still. -- What can be said, or taught
more plain against this Error of Transubstantiation, than to declare that the
Bread abides so still? and yet to this so plain a place, some are not ashamed
thus shamefully to delude it, saying, -- We grant the nature of Bread remains
still thus far, that it may be seen, felt, and tasted, and yet the Corporal
substance of the Bread therefore is gone, lest two Bodies be confused together,
and Christ should be thought impanate. What contrariety and falsehood is in this
answer, the simple man may easily perceive. Is not this a plain Contrariety, to
grant that the nature of Bread remains so still, that it may be felt, seen,
and tasted, and yet to say the Corporal substance is gone to avoid absurdity of
Christ's Impanation. Or what manifest falsehood is this, to say or mean, that if
the Bread should remain still, then must follow the Inconvenience of
Impanation; as though the very Bread could not be a Sacrament of Christ's Body,
as the Water is of Baptism, except Christ should unite the nature of Bread to
his nature in unity of Person, and make of the Bread God.

Now let us hear Theodoretus, the last of the three Greek Authors. He writes
in his Dialogue contra Eutychen, thus: -- He that called the Natural Body
Theodoretus.
Corn and Bread, and also named himself a Vine-tree, even he, the same, has
honored the Symboles, that is, the Sacramental Figure, with the name of his
Body and Blood, not changing indeed the Nature it self, but adding Grace unto
the Nature.

What can be more plainly said than is this, that although the Sacraments bear the
name of the Body and Blood of Christ, yet is not their nature changed, but
abides still: And where is then the Papists Transubstantiation? The same
Writer in the second Dialogue of the same Work, writes yet more plainly
against this Error of Transubstantiation, if any thing can be said to be more
plain: For he makes the Heretic to speak thus against him that defends the
true Doctrine, whom he calls Orthodoxus.

As the Sacraments of the Body and Blood of our Lord are one thing before the
Invocation, and after the Invocation they be changed and made another; so
likewise the Lords Body, (says the Heretic) is, after the Assumption or
Ascension into Heaven, turned into the substance of God. -- The Heretic
meaning thereby, that Christ after his Ascension remains no more a Man. To
this Orthodoxus answers thus, and says to the Heretic; -- Thou art taken,
says he, in thine own snare, for those Mystical Symbols or Sacraments, after
the Sanctification, do not go out of their own nature, but they tarry and abide
still in their substance, figure, and shape, yea, and are sensibly seen, and
groped to be the same they were before. -- At these words the Papists do
startle, and to say the truth, these words be so plain, so full, and so clear,
that they cannot tell what to say, but yet will they not cease to cast their
color over them, that the Truth which is so plainly told, should not have
place.

This Author wrote, say they, before the Determination of the Church; as who
would say -- Whatsoever that wicked man Innocentius the Pope of Rome determined
in his Congregations with his Monks and Friars, that must be, for so Dunse
says, holden for an Article, and for the substance of our Faith. -- Some do
charge this Author, that he was suspected to be a Nestorian, which thing in
Calcedon Council was tried, and proved to be false.

But the foolest shift of all, and yet the best that they can find in this
matter, is, -- That Theodoretus understands by the word Substance, Accidents,
and not Substance. Indeed this gloss is like the gloss of a Lawyer upon a
Decree, the Text whereof begins thus -- Statuimus; that is, We Decree; The
gloss of the Lawyer there after many other shifts - vel dic - Statuimus - i. e.
Abrogamus; that is - We do Decree, that is, - We do abrogate or disanul. Is not
this a goodly and a worthy gloss?

Hitherto you have heard three Writers of the Greek Church, not all what they
do say, for that were a Labor too great for to gather, and too tedious for the
Reader; but one or two places of every one the which how plain, how clear, and
how full they be against the Error of Trausubstantiation, I refer here unto the
Judgment of the indifferent Reader.

And now I will also rehearse the saying of other three old Ancient Writers of
the Latin Church, and so make an end. And first I will begin with Tertullian,
whom Cyprian, the holy Martyr, so highly esteemed, that whenever he would
have his Book, he was wont to say, - Give us now the Master's, -- This old
Writer in his fourth Book against Marcion the Heretic, says -

Jesus made the Bread which he took and distributed Tertull.
to his Disciples, his Body, saying, This is my Body; that is to say, (says
Tertullian) a Figure of my Body. In this place it is plain, that after
Tertullian his Exposition, that Christ meant not, by calling of Bread his Body,
and the Wine his Blood, that either the Bread was his Natural Body, or the Wine
his Natural Blood; but he called them his Body and Blood, because he would
institute them to be unto us Sacraments; that is, holy Tokens and Signs of his
Body and Blood, that by them remembering, and firmly believing the benefits
procured to us by his Body, which was torn and Crucified for us, and of his
Blood which was shed for us upon the Cross; And so with thanks receiving these
holy Sacraments according to Christ's Institution, might by the same be
spiritually nourished and fed, to the increase of all Godliness in us here in
our Pilgrimage and Journey wherein we walk unto Everlasting Life. This was
undoubtedly Christ our Saviors mind, and this is Tertullian's Exposition. The
wrangling that the Papists do make to delude this saying of Tertullian's, it is
too far out of all frame. Tertullian writes here, say they, as none has done
either before him, or after him. This saying is too-too manifestly false; for
Origin, Hilary, Ambrose, Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, St. Augustine, and other old
Authors likewise do call the Sacrament a Figure of Christ's Body. And where they
say, that Tertullian wrote this when he was in a heat of Disputation with an
Heretic, coveting by all means to overcome his Adversaries: as who would say
he would not take heed what he did say, and specially what he would write in so
high a matter, so that he might have the upper hand of his Adversary. Is this
credible to be true in any Godly Wise Man? How much less then is it worthy to
be thought and credited in a Man of so great a Wit, Learning, and Excellency as
Tertullian is worthily esteemed ever to have been.

Likewise this Author in his first Book against the same Heretic Marcion,
writes thus.

God did not reject Bread, which is his Creature, for by it he has made a
Representation of his Body. -- Now, I pray you, what is this to say, that
Christ has made a Representation of his Body by Bread, but that Christ has
instituted and ordained Bread to be a Sacrament for to represent unto us his
Body. Now, whether the representation of one thing by another, requires the
corporal presence of the thing which is represented, or no, every man that has
understanding is able in this point (the matter is so clear of it self) to be a
sufficient Judge.

The second Doctor and Writer of the Latin Church August.
is St. Augustine, of whose Learning and Estimation I need not to speak; for
all the Church of Christ both has, and ever have had him for a Man of much
singular Learning, Wit, and Diligence, both in setting forth the true Doctrine
of Christ's Religion, and also in the Defense of the same against Heretics.
This Author, as he has written more plenteouslly in other matters of our
Faith, so likewise in this Argument he has written at large in many of his
Works; so plainly against the Error of Transubstantiation, that the Papists
love least to hear of him of all other Writers, partly for his Authority, and
partly because he opens the matter more fully than any other does; therefore
I will rehearse more places of him than heretofore I have done of the other. And
first, What can be more plain than that which he writes upon the Ninety eighth
Psalm, speaking of the Sacraments of the Lords Body and Blood, and rehersing,
Tom. 8. Col. Nov. B.
as it were, Christ's words to his Disciples, after this manner:

It is not this Body which ye do see that ye shall eat, nor ye shall not drink
this Blood which the Soldiers which Crucify me, shall spil or shed; I do
commend unto you a Mystery or a Sacrament, which spiritually understood, shall
give you Life.

Now, if Christ had no more Natural or Corporal Bodies but that one, which they
there then presently both heard and saw; and none other Natural Blood, but that
which was in the same Body, and the which the Soldiers afterward did cruelly
shed upon the Cross; and neither this Body, neither this Blood was by this
Declaration of St. Augustine either to be eaten or drunken, but the Mystery
thereof, spiritually to be understood: Then I conclude, that the Mystery which
the Disciples should eat, was not the Natural Body of Christ, but a Mystery of
the same, spiritually to be understood. For, as St. Augustine says in his
Twentieth Book Contra Faustum, Christ's Flesh and Blood was Cap. 21.
in the Old Testament promised by Similitudes and Figures of their Sacrifices,
and was exhibited indeed and in truth upon the Cross; but the same is
celebrated by a Sacrament of Remembrance upon the Altar. And in his Book De
Fide, ad Petrum. Cap. 19. he says;

That in those Sacrifices (meaning of the old Law) it is figuratively signified
what then was to be given; but in this Sacrifice, it is evidently signified
what is already given: Understanding in the Sacrifice upon the Altar, the
Remembrance and Thanksgiving for the Flesh which he offered for us, and for the
Blood which he shed for us upon the Cross.

Another evident and clear place wherein it appears, that by the Sacramental
Bread, which Christ called his Body, he meant a figure of his Body, is upon the
Third Psalm, where St. Augustine speaks thus.

Christ did admit Judas unto the Feast in the which he commended unto his
Disciples the Figure of his Body.

St. Augustine also in the 23 Epist. ad Bonifacium, teaches, how Sacraments
bear the name of Things whereof they be Sacraments, both in Baptism and in the
Lords Table; even as we call every Good Friday, the Day of Christ's Passion;
every Easter Day, the Day of Christ's Resurrection; where in very deed there was
but one day wherein he suffered, and one day wherein he rose: And why do we
then call them so which are not so indeed, but because they are in like time
and course of the year as those days were wherein those things were done.

Was Christ, says St. Augustine, offered any more but once; and he offered
himself, and yet in a Sacrament or Representation, not only every solemn Feast
of Easter, but also every day, to the People, he is offered, so that he does
not lie that says, -- He is every day offered. For if Sacraments had no
similitudes or likeness of those Things whereof they be Sacraments, they could
in no wise be Sacraments; and for their similitude and likeness, commonly they
have the names of the Things whereof they be Sacraments: Wherefore, as after a
certain manner of speech, the Sacrament of Christ's Body, is Christ's Body; the
Sacrament of Christ's Flood is Christ's Blood; so likewise the Sacrament of Faith
is Faith, etc.

After this manner of speech, as St. Augustine teaches in his Questions Super
Leviticum and contra Adamantium, -- it is said, - That seven ears of Corn be
seven years, seven Kyne be seven years, and the Rock was Christ, Blood is the
Soul. The which last saying, says St. Augustine in his Book Contra Adamantium,
is understood to be spoken in a sign or figure; for the Lord himself did not
stick to say, This is my Body, when he gave the sign of his Body: For we must
not consider in Sacraments, (says St. Augustine, contra Maximinum. Lib. 3. cap.
22.) what they be, but what they do signify; for they be signs of Things,
being one Thing in themselves, and yet signifying another Thing; for the
Heavenly Bread, (says he) by some manner of speech, is called Christ's Body,
when indeed it is the Sacrament of his Body. -- What can be more plain, or more
clearly spoken, than are these places of St. Augustine, if Men were not
obstinately bent to maintain an untruth? -- Yet one place more of St. Augustine
will I allege to this purpose, That Christ's Natural Body is in Heaven, and not
here Corporally in the Sacrament. In his 50th Treatise upon John, he speaks
thus of Christ.

By his Divine Majesty, by his Providence, by his unspeakable and invisible
Grace, That is fulfilled which he spoke; Behold I am with you unto the end of
the World: But as concerning the Flesh which he took in his Incaruation, as
concerning that which was born of the Virgin, as concerning that which was
apprehended by the Jews, and Crucified upon the Tree, and taken down from the
Cross, lapped in Linen Cloths, and buried and rose again, and appeared after
his Resurrection; as concerning that Flesh, he said, -- Ye shall not ever have
me with you. Why so? for as concerning his Flesh, he was conversant with his
Disciples forty days, and they accompanying him, seeing, and not following him,
he went up into Heaven, and is not here. By the presence of his Divine Majesty
he did not depart. As concerning the presence of his Divine Majesty, we have
Christ ever with us; but as concerning the presence of his Flesh, he said truly
to his Disciples - Ye shall not ever have me with you. For as concerning the
presence of his Flesh, the Church had him but a few days; now it holds him by
Faith, tho it see him not.

Thus much St. Augustine speaks, repeating one thing so often, and all to
declare and teach how we should understand the manner of Christ's being here
with us: which is by his Grace, by his Providence, and by his Divine Nature.
And how he is absent by his Natural Body which was born of the Virgin Mary,
died, and rose for us, and is ascended into Heaven, and there sits, as is in
the Article of our Faith, on the right hand of God, and thence, and from none
other place, says St. Augustine, shall come on the latter day, to judge the
quick and the dead; at the which day the Righteous shall then lift up their
Heads, and the light of Gods Truth shall so shine, that all Falsehood and
Errors shall be put to utter confusion. Righteousness shall have then the upper
hand, and Truth, that day, shall bear away the Victory; all the Enemies thereof
quite overthrown, to be trodden under foot for evermore.

O Lord! I beseech thee, haste this day! then shall thou be glorified with the
glory due unto thy holy Name, and we shall sing unto thee in all joy and
felicity laud and praise for evermore.

Here now would I make an end, for methinks that St. Augustine is in this matter
so full and plain, and of that Authority, that it should not need after this
his Declaration, to bring you any more Authors: Yet, because I promised to
allege three Writers of the Latin Church, I will now allege, last of all
Gelasius, which was a Bishop of Rome, but before the wicked Usurpation and
Tyranny thereof spread and burst out abroad unto the World. For this Man was
before Bonifacius, and Gregory the first, in whose days both corruption of
Doctrine and Tyrannical Usurpations did chiefly grow, and had the over-hand.

Gelasius in an Epistle of the two Natures of Christ Gelasius.
Contra Eutychen, writes thus; The Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Christ
are Godly things, whereby, and by the same, we are made partakers of the Divine
Nature, and yet nevertheless the substance or nature of Bread and Wine does not
depart or go away. -- Note these words, I beseech you, and consider whether any
thing can be more plainly spoken against the Error of Transubstantiation, which
is the ground and bitter root whereupon springs all the horrible Errors
before rehearsed.

Wherefore, seeing that the falsehood hereof does appear so manifestly, and by
so many ways, so plainly, so clearly, and so fully, that no man needs to be
deceived but he that will not see, or will not understand; let us all that do
love the Truth embrace it, and forsake the Falsehood; for he that loves the
Truth is of God, and the lack of the Love thereof is the cause why God su^^ered
Men to fall into Errors, and to perish therein. Yea, and the cause, as St. Paul
says, why God sends unto them illusions, that they believe Lies, unto their
own Condemnation, because they loved not the Truth. This Truth no doubt is Gods
Word, the Love and Light thereof Almighty God our Heavenly Father give us, and
lighten it in our Hearts by his holy Spirit, through Jesus Christ our Lord.

Amen.
An Epistle of Mr. John Bradford, Prisoner of the Lord, to a faithful Christian
in Coventry.
THe Peace which Christ left to his Church, and to every true Member of the
same, the Holy Spirit, the Guide of Gods Children, be so ingraft in your Heart,
and the Heart of your good Wife, and all my good Brothers and Sisters about
you, that unfainedly you may in respect thereof, contemn all worldly peace,
which repugneth that peace I speak of, and drives it utterly out of the hearts
of all them which would patch them both together: For we cannot serve two
Masters. No Man can serve God and Mammon. Christ's peace cannot be kept with
this Worlds peace. God therefore of his mercy give unto you his peace, which
passes all understanding, and so keep your hearts and minds, that they may be
pure Habitacles and Mansions for the Holy Spirit; yea, for the Blessed Trinity,
who has promised to come and dwell in all them that love Christ and keep his
sayings.

My dearly Beloved, the time is now come wherein Trial is made of Men which
have professed Christ, and would have been counted keepers of his Testimonies;
but, weal away! the tenth person persevereth not. The more part do part stakes
with the Papists and Protestants, so that they are become mangy Mongrels to the
infecting of all the Company with them, to their no small peril; for they
pretend outwardly Popery, going to Mass with the Papists, and tarrying with
them personally at their antichristian and Idolatrous Service; but with their
Hearts, say they, and with their Spirits, they serve the Lord: and so by this
means they save their Pigs, which they would not lose, I mean their worldly
Pelf. So they would please the Protestants, and be counted with them for
Gospellers, yea marry would they. But mine own beloved in the Lord, flee from
such persons, as from men most perilous and pernicious, both before God and
Men, for they are false to both, and true to neither. To the Magistrates, they
are clean contrary to God, they are most untrue, giving him but a piece which
should have the whole. I would they would tell me who made their Bodies; Did
not God as well as their Spirits and Souls? And who keeps both? Does not he
still? And alas, shall not he have the service of the Body, but it must be
given to serve the newfound God of Antichrist his Inventions? Did not Christ
buy both our Souls and Bodies? And wherewith; with any less price than with his
Precious Blood? Ah wretches then that we be, if we will defile either part with
the rose colored Whore of Babylon her filthy Mass Abominations. It had been
better for us never to have been washed, than so to wallow our selves in the
filthy puddle of Popery. It had been better never to have known the Truth, than
thus to betray it. Surely, surely, let such men fear that their latter end be
not worse than the beginning. Their own Conscience now accuses them before
God, (if so be they have any Conscience) that they are but Dissemblers and
Hypocrites to God and Man. For all the Cloaks they make, they cannot avoid
this, but that their going to the Church and to Mass is of self-love, that is,
they go thither because they would avoid the Cross; They go thither because
they would be out of trouble; They seek neither the Queens Highness nor her
Laws, (which in this point cannot bind the Conscience to obey, because they are
contrary to Gods Laws, which bid us often to flee Idolatry, and worshipping him
after men's devices) They seek neither, I say, the Laws, if there were any;
neither their Brothers Commodity, (for none comes thereby) neither Godliness,
or good Example (for there can be none found in going to the Mass, etc. but
horrible offenses, and woe to them that give them) But they seek their own
selves, their own ease, their escaping the Cross. When they have made all the
Excuses they can, their own Conscience will accuse them, that their going to
Church is only because they seek themselves, for if there would no trouble
ensue for tarrying away, I appeal to their own Conscience, would they come
thither? Never, I dare say: Therefore, as I said, they seek themselves, they
would not carry the Cross, and hereof their own Conscience does accuse them.
Now if their Conscience does accuse them at this present, what will it do
before the Judgment seat of Christ. Who will excuse it when Christ shall appear
in Judgment, and shall begin to be ashamed of them then, which here now are
ashamed of him? Who, I say, then, will excuse these Mass-gospellers Conscience?
Will the Queens Highness? She shall then have more to do for her self, than,
without hearty and speedy repentance, she can ever be able to answer, though
Peter, Paul, Mary, James, John, the Pope, and all his Prelates take her part,
with all the singing Sir John's that ever were, are, and shall be. Will the Lord
Chancellor and Prelates of the Realm excuse them there? Nay, nay, they are all
like then to smart for it so sore, that I would not be in their places for all
the whole World. Will the Laws of the Realm, the Nobility, Gentry, Justice of
Peace, etc. excuse our Gospel Mass-mongers Conscience then? Nay, God knows,
they can do little there but fear, tremble, and quake for the heavy Vengeance
of God like to fall upon them. Will their Goods, Lands, and Possessions, which
they by their dissembling have saved; will these serve to excuse them? No, no,
God is no Merchant, as our Mass-Priests be. Will Masses or Trentals, and such
Trash serve? No verily, the hunters of this Geer shall be then horribly
ashamed. Will the Catholic Church excuse? Nay, it will most of all accuse; as
will all the good Fathers, Patriarchs, Apostles, Prophets, Martyrs, Confessors,
and Saints, with all the good Doctors, and good General Councils. All these
already condemn the Mass, and all that ever use it, as it is now; being of all
Idols that ever was, the most abominable and blasphemous to Christ and his
Priesthood, Manhood, and Sacrifice: for it makes the Priest that says Mass,
Gods fellow, and better than Christ; for the Offerer is always better or
equivalent to the Thing offered. If therefore the Priest take upon him there to
offer up Christ (as they boldly affirm they do) then must he needs be equal
with Christ. O that they would show but one jot of Scripture of God calling
them to this Dignity, or of their Authority to offer up Christ for the Quick
and Dead; and to apply the benefit and virtue of his Death and Passion to whom
they will. Surely, if this were true (as it is most false and blasphemous,
prate they at their pleasure to the contrary) then it made no matter at all,
whether Christ were our Friend or no; for he can apply us Christ's Merits by his
Mass if he will, and when he will; and therefore we need little to care for
Christ's Friendship. They can make him when they will, and where they will. Lo
here he is, there he is, say they, but believe them not, says Christ; Believe
them not, believe them not, says he. For in his Humane Nature and Body, which
was made of the substance of the Virgins Body, and not of Bread; in this Body,
I say, he is, and sits on the right hand of God the Father Almighty in
Heaven; from whence, and not from the Pix, he shall come to judge both the
Quick and Dead. In the mean season, Heaven, says St. Peter, must receive him:
And, as Paul says, He prays for us, and now is not seen elsewhere, or
otherwise seen then by says there, until he shall be seen as he is to the
Salvation of them that look for his coming; which, I trust be not long to. For
if the day of the Lord drew near in the Apostles time, which is now above
fifteen hundred years past, it cannot be, I trust, long hence now. I trust our
Redeemer his coming is at hand: I trust then these Mass-sayers, and Seers shall
shalke, and cry to the Hills, Hide us from the fierce wrath of the Lamb, if
they repent not in time. Then will neither Gold nor Good; Friendship nor
Fellowship; Lordship nor Authority; Power nor Pleasure; Unity nor Antiquity;
Custom nor Council; Doctors Decrees, nor any Man's Devise serve: The word which
the Lord has spoken that day shall judge; the word, I say, of God, that day
shall judge. And what says it of Idolatry and Idolaters? Says it not, Flee
from it? And farther, That they shall be damned? O terrible Sentence to all
Mass-mongers, and Worshippers of Things made with the Hands of Bakers,
Carpenters, etc. This Word of God knows no more Oblations or Sacrifices for
Sin, but one only, which Christ himself offered, never more to be re-offer'd;
but in Remembrance hereof, his Supper to be eaten Sacramentally and Spiritually
according to Christ's Institution; which is so perverted now, that there is
nothing remaining in it simply according to the Judge, I mean the Word of God.
It were good for Men to agree with their Adversary, the Word of God, now while
they be in the way with it; lest, if they linger, it will deliver them to the
Judge, Christ, who will commend these Men to the Jailer, and so they shall be
cast into Prison, and never come out thence till they have paid the uttermost
farthing; that is never. - My dearly beloved therefore mark the Word, hearken
to the Word: It allows no Massing, no such Sacrificing, nor Worshipping of
Christ with Tapers, Candles, Copes, Cannabies, etc. It allows no Latin
Service, no Image in the Temples, no Praying to Saints dead, no Praying for the
Dead. It allows no such Dissimulations as a great many use now outwardly. If
any Man withdraw himself, my Soul, says the Holy Ghost, shall have no pleasure
in him. It allows not the Love of this World, which makes Men to do many
times against their Consciences; for in them that love the World, the love of
God abides not. It allows not Gatherers elsewhere than with Christ; but
says they scatter abroad. It allows no Lukewarm Gentlemen, but if God be
God, then follow him; if Baal, and a piece of Bread be God, then follow it. It
allows not Faith in the Heart that has not Confession in the Mouth: It
allows no Disciples that will not deny themselves; that will not take up
their Cross and follow Christ. It allows not the seeking of our selves, of
our own Ease and Commodity: It allows not the more part, but the better part:
It allows not Unity, except it be in Verity: It allows not obedience to
any, which cannot be done with obedience to God: It allows no Church which is
not the Spouse of Christ, and hearkeneth to his Voice only: It allows no
Doctor that speaks against it: It allows no General Council that follows
not it in all things: -- It allows no Angel, much less then Man, that should
teach any other thing than Moses, the Prophets, Christ Jesus and his Apostles
have taught and left us to look upon in the written Word of God, the Holy Books
of the Bible; but curses all that teach not only contrary, but also any other
Doctrine. It says they are Fools, unwise, proud, that will not consent to the
sound Word and Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles; and it bids and
commands us to flee from such. Therefore obey his commandment, company not
with them, specially in their Church Service, but flee from them. For in what
thing consent they to Christ's Doctrine? He bids us pray in a Tongue to
edify; they command contrary: He bids us call upon his Father in his Name
when we pray; they bid us run to Mary, Peter, etc. He bids us use his Supper
in the Remembrance of his Death and Passion, preachng it out till he come,
whereby he does us to wit that Corporally he is not there in the form of Bread;
therefore, says Paul, Till he come. He wills us to eat of that Bread,
calling it Bread after Consecration; and drink of that Cup, All, making no
exception, so that we do it worthily, that is, as the Sacrament of his Body and
Blood broken and shed for our Sins, and not as the Body it self, and Blood it
self without Bread and Wine, but as the Sacrament of his Body and Blood,
whereby he does represent, and unto our Faith give and obsign unto us himself
wholly, with all the Merits and Glory of his Body and Blood. But they forbid
utterly the use of the Supper to all but to their Shavelings, except it be once
in the year, and then also the Cup they take from us; They never preach forth
the Lords Death but in Mocks and Modes. They take away all the Sacrament by
their Transubstantiation, for they take away the Element, and so the Sacrament.
To be short, they most horribly abuse this holy Ordinance of the Lord by
Adoration, Reservation, Oblation, Ostentation, to drive away Spirits, to drive
away Tempests, etc. in nothing they are contented with the simplicity of Gods
Word. They add to, and take from at their pleasure; and therefore the plagues
of God will fall upon them at the length, and upon all that will take their
part. They seek not Christ and his Glory, for you see they have utterly cast
away his Word, and therefore (as the Prophet says) There Jer. 8.
is no wisdom in them. They follow the Strumpet-Church, and Bawdy Spouse of
Antichrist, which they call the Catholic Church, whose Foundations and Pillars
is the Devil, and his Daughter the Mass, with his Children, the Pope and his
Prelates. Their Laws are Craft and Cruelty; their Weapons are Lying and Murder;
their End and Study is their own Glory, Fame, Wealth, Rest, and Possessions.
For if a Man speak or do nothing against them, tho he be a Sodomite, an
Adulterer, an Usurer, etc. it forces not, he shall be quiet enough, no Man
shall trouble him; but if a Man speak any thing to Gods Glory, which cannot
stand without the overthrow of Man's Glory, then shall he be disquieted,
imprisoned, and troubled, except he will play Mume, and put his Finger upon his
Mouth, although the same be a most quiet and godly Man. So that easily a Man
may see how that they be Antichrists Church, and sworn Soldiers to the Pope and
his Spouse, and not to Christ and his Church; for then would they not cast away
Gods Word, and be no more Adversaries to his Glory, which chiefly consists in
obedience to his Word. Therefore, my dear Brethren in the Lord, seem not to
allow this or any part of the pelf of this Romish Church and Synagogue of
Satan. Halt not on both Knees for halting will bring you out of the way; but
like valiant Champions of the Lord confess, confess with your Mouth, as
occasion serves, and as vocation requires, the hope and Faith you have and
feel in your hearts.

But you will say, That so to do is perilous, you shall by that means lose your
Liberty, your Lands, your Goods, your Friends, your Name, your Life, etc. and
so shall your Children be left in miserable state, etc. To this I answer, my
good Brethren, That you have professed in Baptism to fight under the Standard
of your Captain Christ, and will you now for perils sake leave the Lord? You
made a solemn Vow that you would forsake the World and will you be forsworn,
and run to embrace it now? You swore and promised to leave all and follow
Christ and will you now leave him for your Father, your Mother, your Children,
your Lands, your Life, etc. He that hates not these, says Christ, is not
worthy of me. He that forsakes not these, and himself also, and thereto takes
not up his Cross and follow me, the same shall be none of my Disciples, says
Christ: Therefore, either bid Christ adieu, be forsworn, and run to the Devil
quick, or else say as a Christian should say -- That Wife, Children, Goods,
Life, etc. is not so dear unto you in respect of Christ, who is your Portion
and Inheritance. Let the Worldlings which have no hope of Eternal Life fear
perils and loss of Goods, Lands, Life, etc. here is not our home; we are here
but Pilgrims and Strangers. This Life is but the Desert and Wilderness to the
Land of Rest. We look for a City whose Workman is God himself. We are now
dwellers in the Tents of Kedar. We are now Psalm. 19.
in Warfare, in Travel, and Labor, whereto we were born, as the Birds to fly.
We sorrow and sigh, desiring the Dissolution of our Bodies, and the putting off
of our Corruption, that we might put on Incorruption. The way we walk is strait
and narrow, and therefore not easy to our Enemy the Flesh corrupted: But yet
we must walk on, for if we hearken to our Enemy we shall be served not
friendly. Let them walk the wide way that are ruled by their Enemies; let us be
ruled by our Friends, and walk the strait way, whose end is weal, as the other
is woe. The time of our suffering is but short, as the time of their ease is
not long; but the time of our rejoicing shall be endless, as the time of their
Torments shall be ever and intolerable. Our Breakfast is sharp, but our Supper
is sweet. The Affliction of this Life may not be compared in any part to the
Glory that shall be revealed unto us. This is certain, if we snffer with
Christ, we shall reign with him; if we will confess him, he will confess us,
and that before his Father in Heaven, and all his Angels and Saints, saying --
Come ye blessed of my Father, possess the Kingdom prepared for you from the
beginning. There shall be joy, mirth, pleasure, pastime, solace, melody, and
all kind of beatitude and felicity, such as the Eye has not seen, the Ear has
not heard, nor the Heart of Man is able in any point to conceive it as it is.
In respect of this, and of the joy set before us, should we not run our race,
though it be somewhat rough? Did not Moses so, the Prophets so, Christ so, the
Apostles so, the Martyrs so, and the Confessors so? They were drunk with the
sweetness of this gear, and therefore they contemned all that Man and Devil
could do to them. Their Souls thirsted after the Lord and his Tabernacles, and
therefore their Goods and Life were not so dear to them. Read the Eleventh to
the Hebrews, and the seventh Chapter of the second of Macchabees, and let us go
the same way; that is, by many Tribulations let us labor to enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven, for all that will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer
persecution. Think therefore the Cross, if it come for Confession of Christ, no
strange thing to Gods Children, but rather take it as the Lords Medicine, by
the which he helps our Infirmities, and sets forth his Glory. Our Sins
have deserved cross upon cross; Now if he give us his Cross to suffer for his
Truth and Confessing him, as he does by it bury our Sins, so does he glorify
us, making us like to Christ here, that we may be like unto him elsewhere. For
if we be partakers of the Afflictions, we shall be partakers of the
Consolations; if we be like in Ignomy, we shall be like in Glory. Great cause
we have to give thanks to God for lending us Liberty, Lands, Wife, Children,
Life, etc. thus long; that we shall be guilty of Ingratitude, if he shall come
and take the same away, except we be cheerful and content. And God has given,
and God has taken away, says Job; as it pleases the Lord o be it done. And
shall not we do thus, especially when the Lord takes these away of Love to try
us, to prove us, whether we be faithful Lovers or Strumpets; that is, whether
we love him better than his Gifts. This is most true, that it is not lost which
seems so to be for Confession of Christ. In this Life your Children shall
find Gods good plentiful blessing upon them, when you are gone, and all your
Goods taken away. God is so good that he helps the young Ravens before they
can fly, and feeds them when that their Dams have most unkindly left them:
and trow you that God which is the God of Widows and Fatherless Children, that
he will not especially have a care for the Babes of his dear Saints which dye,
or lose any thing for Conscience to him. O my dearly beloved! therefore look up
with the Eyes of Faith! Consider not things present, but rather things to come;
be content now to go whither God shall gird and lead us; let us now cast our
selves wholly into his Hands, with our Wives, Children, and all that ever we
have besides; let us be sure the Hairs of our Heads are numbered, so that one
Hair shall not perish without the good will of our dear Father, who has
commanded his Angels to pitch their tents about us, and in their hands to take
and hold us up that we shall not hurt as much as our foot against a stone. Let
us use earnest Prayers; let us heartily repent; let us hearken diligently to
Gods Word; let us keep our selves pure from all Uncleanness both of Sou^ and
Body; let us fly from all Evil, (...) of Evil; let us be diligent in our (...)
doing good to all Men, specially to them (...) of Faith; let us live in peace
with all Men as much as in us lies; and the Lord of Peace give us his Peace,
and that for evermore. Amen.

I pray you remember me your poor Afflicted Brother in your hearty prayers to
God.
FINIS.
