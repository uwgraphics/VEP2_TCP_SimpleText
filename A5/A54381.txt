OF THEOLOGY.
THeology is the science of living blessedly for ever.

Blessed life arises from the knowledge of God and of our selves. Joh. 17. 3.


The parts of the Theology are:

1. Of God. 2. Of Gods works.
That there is a God is evident.

1. By the course of Nature. 2. By the nature of the Soul of man. 3. By the
distinction of things honest and dishonest. 4. By the terror of Conscience. 5.
By the regiment of civil societies. 6. By the order of all causes which have
ever recourse to some former beginning. 7. By the determination of all things
to their several ends. 8. By the consent of all men.
The Names of God.
The Names of God, are.

Jehova. Elohim, Exodus 6. 2. 3. Jehova declares Gods Nature. Elohim his
Persons.
The Nature of God.
The Nature of God is his most lively, and most perfect essence.

The perfection of the Nature of God is that, where by he is wholely complete
in him self, Exodus 3. 13. Act. 17. 24.

The perfection of Gods Nature is the simpleness and infinitnes thereof.

The simpleness of Gods Nature Simplenes of the nature of God.
is that, whereby he is void of all Logical relation in Arguments. That is, See
Aug. l. 6. c. 4. de Trinitate.
God has not in himself either Subject, or Adjunct, Joh. 5. 26. and 14. 6.

In God to be, and to be just, and mighty, are all one; But in the mind of
man, it is not all one to be, and to be mighty, or just: For the mind may be
destitute of these virtues and yet a mind.

The Nature of God is immutable and Spiritual. Gods nature.


Gods immutability of Nature is that by which he is void of all composition,
division and change, Its immutability.
Jam. 1. 17. Malach. 3. 6.

Gods Nature is Spiritual, in that it is incorporal, and therefore invisible,
Joh. 4. 24. Colos. 1. 15. 1 Timothy 1. 17.

So much for the simpleness of Gods Nature.

The infinitness of Gods Nature is either his Eternity, Its infinitness.
or his exceeding greatness.

Gods Eternity is that by which he is without beginning, and ending, Ps. 90. 2.
Rev. 1. 8.

His exceeding greatness is that, by which his incomprehensible Nature is every
where present, both within and without the World, Ps 145. 3. 1 King. 8. 27.
Jer. 23. 24.

Of the life of God.
By this it does plainly appear. 1. That God is one, and indivisible and not
many, as Ephesians. 4. 5. 1 Cor. 8. 4.

2. That God is the knower of the heart: For nothing is hidden from that Nature
which is within all things, and without all things, which is included in
nothing, nor excluded from any thing, as 1 King. 8. 32. Psalm. 139. 1. 2.

The life of God is that by which the Devine in Nature is in perpetual action,
living and moving with it self, Psalm. 42. 2. 2 Heb. 3. 12. These three
following Attributes do manifest the operation of the Divine Nature toward the
Creatures.

1. Gods wisdom. 2. Gods will. 3. Gods omnipotency.
The wisdom and knowledge of Gods wisdom.
God is that, by which God does by one Eternal and immutable Act of
understanding, distinctly and perfectly know himself, and all other things
though infinite whether they have been, or not, Matthew. 11. 27. Heb. 4. 13.
Psalm. 347 5.

Gods wisdom is his foreknowledge and his Counsel.

Gods foreknowledge is that, by which he most assuredly foreseeth things that
are to come, Act. 2. 23. Romans 8. 29.

Gods counsel is that, by which he does most rightly perceive the best reason
of all things that are done, Prove. 8. 14.

So much of the wisdom of God. The will of God is that, Gods will.
by which he does most freely and justly will all things with one Act, Romans 9.
18. Epb. 1. 5. Jam. 4. 15.

In God there are two wills.

1. A will whereby God determines what shall be done concerning us, or in us.
Quid vult. fieri de nobis, or in nobis.


2. A will whereby God determines Quid vult. fieri a nobis.
what shall be done off us.

The first of these wills is called Predestination: And therefore it is, M. P.
page 295.
that Predestination is commonly defined to be the preparation of the blessing
of God, whereby they are delivered which are delivered.

The second of these wills is the Gospel.

Predestination determines, who who, and how many are to be saved, and hereupon
Christ says, I know whom I have choosed, John 13. 18.

The Gospel which is the second will of God, determines what kind of ones they
are that shall be saved, and how they must be qualified. Predestination which
is the first will of God, is Gods Decree it self.

The Gospel which is the second will of God, is an outward means of the
execution of this Decree of Predestination.

In the will of God there are three Actions.

(i. e.) V^lendo, velle.
1. An Action whereby God does absolutely will any thing, and delight in it.

2. An Action whereby he does wholely, Nolendo nolle, or penitus nolle.
and absolutely nill a thing.

3. A remiss Action, Decretun Dei non tell it libertatem voluntatis sed
ordinat. So M. P.
which is as a mean between the two former Actions, as when a thing is
remissely, or in part both willed and nilled.

God wills good by approving it.

God wills evil, because it is good that there should be evil.

For this cause God does voluntarily permit evil. But as it is absolutely evil
he wills it not; But does dissalowe and forsake it, Act. 14. 16. Psalm. 81. 12.

The will of God in respect of diverse objects, is called diversely by diverse
names, as by the Names of Love, Hatred, or of Grace, Justice.


The love of God is that, whereby he approves, first himself; and then all his
Creatures as they are good without their desert, and does take delight in them,
1 John 4. 16. Joh. 3. 16. Romans 5. 8.

His hatred is that, whereby he disliketh and detesteth his Creature offending
for his fault, 1 Cor. 10. 5. Psalm. 5. 5. and 45. 7.

Gods Grace is that, whereby he freely declares his favor to his Creatures,
Romans 11. 6. Tit. 2. 11.

The Grace of God is his goodness, or his mercy.

Gods goodness is that, by which he being also absolutely good, does freely
exercise his liberality upon his creatures, Matt. 19. 17. and 5. 45.

Gods mercy is that, whereby he freely assisteth all his Creatures in their
miseries, Esai 30. 18. Lament. 3. 22. Exodus 33. 19.

Gods justice is that, by which he in all things wills that which is just, as
Psalm. 11. 7. and 5. 4.

Gods justice is either in word, or deed.

Gods justice in word is that truth, by which he constantly, and indeed wills
that which he says, or has said, ( Romans 3. 4. Matthew. 24. 35.)

This is the justice of God in keeping his promise, 2 Timothy 4. 8. 1 John 4. 9.

Gods justice indeed is that, by which he disposes, or rewards

Gods disposing justice is that, by which he as a free Lord, orders all
things rightly in his Actions, Psalm. 145. 17.

His rewarding justice is that, by which he rendereth to his Creature according
to his work, 2 These. 1. 6. 1 Pet. 1. 17. Jer. 51. 56.

Again, the justice of God is either his, Gentleness, or his Anger.

Gods Gentleness is that, whereby he freely rewards the righteousness of his
Creature, 2 These. 1. 5. Matthew. 10. 41. 42.

Gods Anger is that, by which he wills the punishment of the Creature
offending, Romans 1. 8. Joh. 3. 36.

So much concerning the will of God.

Gods omnipotency is that, Gods omnipotency.
whereby he is most able to perform every work, Matthew. 19. 26.

Gods power is either absolute, or Actual.

Gods absolute power is that, by which he can do more than he either does, or
will do, Matthew. 3. 9. Phil. 3. 21.

Gods Actual power is that, by which he causes all things to be which he
freely wills, Ps. 135. 6.

Of the Glory, and blessedness of God.
Gods glory and Majesty, Gods glory.
is the infinite excellency of his most simple, and most holy Divine Nature,
Heb. 1. 3. Nehem. 9. 5.

In which we may see that God can only know him self perfectly, Joh 6. 46. 1 Timothy 6. 16. Exo. 33. 20.

The manifestation of Gods glory is either obscure as here on earth, or
apparent as in Heaven.

The obscure manifestation of Gods glory, is the Vision of Gods Majesty in
this life, by the eyes of the mind, through the help of things perceived by the
outward senses, as Isai 6. 1. Exodus 33. 22. 1 Cor. 13. 12.

The apparent manifestation of God, is the contemplation of him in Heaven, face
to face.

This concerning his glory.

Gods blessedness is that, Gods blessedness.
by which God is in himself, and off himself all sufficient, Genes. 17. 1.
Collos. 2. 9. 1 Timothy 6. 15.

Of the Persons of the Godhead.
The Persons of the Godhead are they, which subsisting in one Godhead, are
distinguished by incommunicable properties, 1 John 5. 7 Genes. 19. 24. John. 1.
1.

The Persons are coequal, and distinguished not by degree, but by order: There
is a Trinity of Persons, but a Unity in Essence, for the three Persons are but
one infinite essence.

The Communion of the Persons, or rather the Union of the Persons; is that by
which one of them is in the rest, and with the rest, by reason of the Unity of
the Godhead; and therefore every each one does possess, Love, and glorify
another, and work the same thing, Joh. 14. 10. and 1. 1. and 5. 19. Prove. 8.
22. 30.

The Persons of the Godhead are three, Matthew. 3. 16. 17.

The Father is a Person without beginning, from all Eternity begetting the Son,
Joh. 1. 3. 10.

In the generation of the Son we must note these properties.

1. That he that begets, and he that is begotten are together, and not one
before another in time.

2. He that begets, does communicate with him that is begotten, not some one
part of his essence, but his whole essence, so that this Communion is not a
Communion, but a Union.

3. The Father begot the Son not out of himself, but in himself; The
incommunicable property of the father is to be unbegotten, to be a Father, and
to beget. The Father is the beginning of Actions, and begins every Action of
himself, And effects every Action by the Son, and by the Holy spirit, 1 Cor.
8. 6. Romans 11. 36.

The Son is the second Person begotten of the Father from all Eternity, Joh. 1.
3. 10. 1 John 1. 1. 2. The Son in regard of his essence is of and by himself
(...)
very God.

But in regard of his filiation and Sonship, as he is a Person, and the Son of
the Father, he is not of himself, but from another, for he is the Eternal Son
of his Father; And thus is he truly said to be very God, of very God.

For this cause he is said to be sent from the Father, Joh. 8. 42.

And this sending takes not away the equality of Essence, and power, but
declares the order of the Persons, Joh. 5. 18. Phil. 2. 6.

The property of the Son is to be begotten; His proper manner of working is to
execute actions from the Father by the Holy Ghost, Joh. 5. 19. 1 Cor. 8. 6.

The Holy Ghost is the third Person, proceeding from the Father and the Son,
Joh. 15. 26. Romans 8. 9. Job. 16. 13, 14.

The incommunicable property of the Holy Ghost is to proceed.

The Holy Ghosts proper manner of working is to finish an action, Effecting it
as from the Father and the Son.

The second part of THEOLOGY.
Of Gods works and his Decree.
THe works of God, are all the World, and all the things contained therein.

The end for which all things are created, is the manifestation of the glory
of God, Romans 11. 36.

The Decree of God is that, by which God has freely from all eternity
determined all things, Ephesians. 1. 11. 4. Matthew. 10. 29. Romans 9. 21.

The execution of Gods Decree is that, by which all things in their time are
accomplished, according as he foreknew them, and Decreed them.

The Decree of God is the first, and principal working cause of all things, and
it is also in order and time before all other causes.

This first, and principal cause does not take away freedom of will in
Election; Nor the Nature and property of second causes; but it brings them
into a certain order; and it directs them to their determinate ends, and
hereupon the effects, or events of things are either, contingent, or Necessary.
--

-- Even as the Nature of the second cause is; And thus Christ according to his
Fathers Decree, died necessarily, (as Act. 17. 3.) But yet willingly. Joh. 10.
18.

And if we respect the temperature of Christ's body, he might have prolonged his
life, and therefore in this regard he may be said to have died contingently.

Gods foreknowledge is conjoined with his Decree; and in regard of us it is
before his Decree, but not in regard of God.

The branches of the execution of Gods Decree are his, Operation, and his
operative permission.

His operation is his effectual producing of all good things, which either have
being, or moving, or which are done.

Gods operative permission is that, whereby he only permits one, and the
same work to be done of others, as it is evil; but as it is good he does
effectually work it, Genesis 56. 20. and 45. 7. Isai 10. 5. 6. 7.

God permits evil by a certain voluntary permission, in that he forsakes
the second cause in working evil.

And he does also forsake his creature, either by detracting the grace it had,

Or by not bestowing that which it wants, Romans 1. 26. 2 Timothy 2. 25. 26.

And in this we must not think God unjust, for he is indebted to none, Romans 9.
15.

It is in Gods pleasure to bestow how much grace, and upon whom he will, Matthew.
10. 15.

That evil which God permits in respect of God is good, whither it be as a
punishment, or as a chastisement, because he can, and does produce good out of
it.

Gods Decree as it concerns man, is called predestination.

Predestination is a Decree of God, by which all men are ordained to an
everlasting estate; either of Salvation, or Condemnation, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 9.

The means of accomplishing Gods predestination, was the Creation and the fall.

The Creation is the World, The creation.
and the inhabitants in the World.

The parts of the World, are the Heaven and the Earth.

The Heavens are three fold, 1. The Air, 2. Sky, 3. The invisible Heaven.

Heaven in a large acceptance, 2 Cor. 12. 2.
is all that is above the Earth. All which, is distinguished into three Heavens.
The first Heaven is the space betwixt the Earth, and Starry Firmament. The
second Heaven contains the Sun, Moon, and Stars. The third Heaven is the
invisible Heaven, this is the place in which the blessed do behold the Majesty,
and glory of the Almighty.

The inhabitants of the World are Angels, Men, and all other Creatures.

In Angels there are these things to be considered.

1. Their Nature; they are spiritual, and incorporeal essences, Heb. 2. 16. and
1. 7.

2. Their qualities, 2 Samuel 14. 17.
First they are wise, Secondly, they are of great might, 2 These. 1. 7. 2 Samuel
24. 17. 2 Kings 19. 35. Another quality of them is, Thirdly, that they are
swift, and of great agility, Isa. 6. 6. Dan. 9. 21.

3. Their Number they are innumerable, Dan. 7. 10. Hebr 12. 22

4. The place in which these good Angels are, and that is in the highest
Heaven, for there they do ever attend upon God, and have society with him,
Matthew. 18. 10. Mark. 12. 25. Psalm. 68. 17.

5. Their orders, or degrees, which what they be, no man can certainly say; but
there are Archangels spoken of in Scripture, 1 These. 4. 16.

And Angels, Matthew. 18. 10. And Cherubims, and Seraphims, Esai 6. 6.

But it concerns us not to search this; neither may we curiously enquire
after it.

6. There office which is to magnify God, and perform his Commandments, Psalm.
103. 20. 21.

The Angels were created within the six days, as appears, Genesis 2. 1.

The knowledge that the Angels have, Their knowledge.
is either: 1. Natural, 2 Revealed, 3. Experimental.

The Ministry of the Angels is three fold, Ministry.
either to adore, or to praise, or to glorify God continually, To this purpose
do they stand in the presence of God, ever more ready to do his Commandments;
as Isai 6. 2. Luke 2. 14. Rev. 5. 11. 12. Ps. 103. 20. Dan. 7. 9. 10.

Part of the Ministry of Angels respects the Church, for they are Ministering
Spirits sent forth of God, to Minister for the good of those that shall be
heirs of salvation, Heb. 1. 14.

For the good of all these, they Minister first in this life, 2. In the end of
this life, and 3. In the last judgment.

In this life they watch for the good of their bodies, and for the good of
their Souls, and that from the beginning of their days to the end of them,
Psalm. 34. 7.

In the end of this life, they carry the Souls to Heaven, as they did the Soul
of Lazarus, Luke 16. 22.

In the last judgment they do gather all the Elect together, that they may
come before Christ, and so enter into Eternal fruition of glory, both in body
and Soul, Matthew. 24. 31.

Another part of their Ministry concerns Gods Enemies, and it is to execute
judgments upon his Enemies at his command.

Of Man and his State.
Man was made after Gods image, Of Man.
and resembling God in holiness.

In the excellent State of Man's innocence, these things are to be considered.

1. The place in which he was set in his innocence, The place of his first
habitation.
and that was the garden of Eden, that pleasant place. Genesis 2. 15.

2. The integrity of Man's Nature, His integrity.
he was Created in righteousness, and true holiness, Ephesians. 4. 24.

There are two parts of Man's first integrity, 1. Wisdom, for he had a true, and
perfect knowledge of God and his will, as far as it was to be performed of him;
and of the counsel of God, concerning all Creatures, Genes. 2. 19. 2. Secondly,
Justice, which was a conformity in his will, affections and powers of his body
to the will of God.

3. Man's dignity, which consisted in these things. 1. In Man's Communion with
God, God rejoiced in Man made in his own image, and Man did fervently love God;
and this appears by God's familiar conference with Adam; Genes. 1. 29.
Secondly, in his Dominion over all the creatures of the Earth; Genesis 2. 19.
Psalm. 8. 6. Thirdly, in his Decency, Comeliness, and Dignity of body; for
though he was naked, yet was he clothed with the best and excellentest roabs,
even with innocence; There was imprinted upon him by God a Princely Majesty, so
that there could not then be any thing in him unseemly; Genesis 2. 25. Psalm. 8.
Fourthly, in his labor of body, which was without pain, or grief; Genesis 3. 17.
19.

4. Man's subjection to God, for he was bound to perform obedience to these
commandments of God. He was not to eat of the two forbidden Trees. The
commandment concerning the Trees was as a proof, and a trial of Man's obedience.

The Tree of life was a sign to Man, to confirm to him his perpetual abode in
the garden of Eden, if he did continue in his obedience; Rev. 2. 7.

The Tree of the knowledge of good and evil, was a sign of death to him; if he
did transgress Gods Commandment; Genesis 2. 17.

5. Man's calling; which was to obey God's Commandments, and to dress the
garden of Eden; Genesis 2. 17. and 2. 15.

6. His diet, which was the herbs of the earth; and the fruit of all the Trees,
save of the Tree of life, and of the Tree of knowledge of good and evil, and
all the other Creatures; Genesis 1. 29. 30. and 9. 3.

His free choice to perform, or not perform these Commandments.

Thus were our first Parents Created in perfect innocence: But mutable. And
thus it pleased God to prepare a way to the execution of his Decree.

Of the Fall.
The fall was of Man and Angels. The fall of Angels.


Angels fell by leaving that good state, wherein God had placed them. Jude 6.

In their fall may be observed,

1. Their corruption arising from their fall; Their corruption.
by reason of which they are full of malice and hatred, and hatred, and by
reason of this they do set themselves against God, and insatiablely desire to
destroy all mankind, and that they may do this as much as in them lays, they
do neglect neither force nor fraud to act it withal; 1 Pet. 5. 8. Ephesians. 6. 12.
Joh. 8. 44.

Their degrees and diversity for one of them which is called Baalzebub, Degrees.
is chief; and Prince of the rest of the Devils; and he is far above the rest
in malice; Matthew. 25. 41. Rev. 12. 7. He is also called the Prince of this
World, and the God of this World; 2 Cor. 4. 4. Ephesians. 22.

3. Their punishment; Punishment.
God after their fall gave them over to perpetual torments, without any hope of
pardon; Jude 6. 2 Pet. 2. 4.

By this we may see what great punishment they deserved, and that grievous sins
will be grievously punished.

Their punishment was first their dejection from Heaven; 2 Pet. 2. 4. And the
shortning, and limiting of their power, Job 1. 12. Secondly, a grievous pain
and torment in the deep, which is endless, and infinite in time and measure,
Luke 8. 31. Matthew. 25. 41. Rev. 20. 10.

Of Man's fall.
The fall of Man was his revolting from his obedience to sin. Man's fall.
Sin was his transgression of Gods Commandment, or

Man's fall was his disobeying of Gods Commandment, in eating the forbidden
fruit, wherein these things are to be considered.

1. The manner of Man's fall. The manner of it.


The Devil having immediately before fallen himself, persuaded our first Parents
that both the punishment for eating the forbidden fruit was uncertain, and that
also God was not true in his word unto them: Having done this he blinds the
eyes of their understanding; and they being thus blinded straight began to
distrust God, and to doubt of Gods favor; And when he had brought them to a
doubting, he moved them to behold the forbidden fruit, which so soon as they
saw in its beauty, upon his motion of them to this purpose; he then stirred
them up to desire it; and from the desire of it, he moved them to satisfy
their desires; And so the Woman plucked the fruit and did eat, and gave it to
her husband and he did eat, Genesis 3. 1. to the 8. Thus did they willingly fall
from their integrity, God for just causes suffering it.

2. The greatness of their transgression, The greatness of it.
which appears by these trespasses that they committed in that action of
disobedience. 1. They doubted of Gods word. 2. They being bewitched with the
Devils promises, cease to fear Gods punishment, and thus become puffed up with
presumption, and enflamed with the desire of greater Dignity, and will no
longer believe Gods threatenings. 3. They forsake Gods word, and seek after
other wisdom. 4. They are proud, and seek to magnify themselves, and to become
like God. 5. They contemn God, and against their own consciences sin against
his Commandment. 6. They prefered the Devil before God. 7. They are
unthankful, and drive out the holy Spirit of God from dwelling in them, and
thus despised that everlasting blessed Union. 8. They murdered both themselves
and their progeny.

3. The fruits and effects of it, Fruits and effects of it.
upon it there arose a state of unbelief, and by it we are all included under
sin, Romans 11. 32.

Of Sin.
Sin is threefold. Of sin by participation.
1. A participation of Adam's transgression and guiltiness, by being in his
loins when he offended; as Heb. 7. 9. 10. It is said of Levi that he paid
Tithes in Abraham, because he was in the loins of Abraham when Abraham paid
Tithes.

2. Original sin which arises out of the former transgression; Original sin.
Original sin is a corruption engendered in our first Conception, by which the
faculties of Soul and body are prone, and disposed to evil; Psalm. 51. 5.

The remnant of God's image which man retained after his fall, were certain
Notions concerning good and evil; as that there is a God, and that he does
punish sin, and that there is an everlasting life; and the like; all which
serve to make men without excuse in the sight of God; Romans 1. 20.

From the fall our minds receive ignorance, The remnant of Gods image in the
mind after the fall.
by it we were deprived of knowledge in the things of God; by it we were made
ignorant of his sincere worship and eternal life; 1 Cor. 1. 14. Romans 8. 7.

By it our minds are disabled to understand spiritual things, though they be
taught us; Luke 24. 45. 2 Cor. 3. 5.

From the fall our minds received vanity, for we think falsehood truth, and
truth false-hood; Ephesians. 4. 17.

By it we have gotten a natural inclination to conceive and devise only that
which is evil, Genes. 6. 5. Jer. 4. 22.

The increase of sin in the understanding is either a reprobate sense. Increase
of sin what it is.
As when God withdraws the light of Nature, Joh. 12. 40. Romans 1. 28.

Or, 2. The spirit of slumber, as Romans 11. 8.

Or, 3. Spiritual drunkenness, Isai 29. 9.

Or, 4. Strong illusions, as 2 Thessalonians. 2 11.

The remnant of Gods image in the conscience, The remnant of Gods image in the
Conscience*
is an observing and watchful power, like the eye of a Keeper, reserved in Man
partly to reprove; And partly to repress the unbridled course of his
affections; Romans 2. 15.

From Adam's fall the Conscience has received impureness; The effects of the
impureness of the Conscience by Adams fall.
Titus 1. 15.

This impurity works these effects.

1. It causes Man to excuse sin, or cloak it, as when a Man by his outward
service of God does excuse his inward impiety; Mark. 10. 19. And it excuses
intents not waranted by Gods word; 1 Chronicles. 13. 19.

2. It does accuse and terrify us for doing good, and this we may see in
Idolaters and Superstitious persons, who are grieved when they do omit to
perform Idolatrous and counterfeit Worships to their Gods; Col. 2. 21. 22. Isai
29. 13.

3. Effect which it works, is when the Conscience does accuse and terrify for
sin, as Genes. 50. 15. Joh. 8. 9.

Impureness increased in the Conscience, is such a senseless numdness as that it
can hardly accuse a man of sin; Ephesians. 4. 19. 1 Timoth. 4. 2.

This senslesness springs from a custom in sinning, 1 Samuel 25. 37. or else
from some grievous horror and terror of the Conscience, as Genesis 4. 14.

The Symptoms of this disease are blasphemies, Trembling of body, fearful
dreams; Act. 24. 26. Dan. 5. 6.

The remnant of God's image The remnant of Gods image in the will.
which remains in Man's will since the fall is a free choice, either in
Natural Actions, as to Nourish, to engender, to move, to perceive;

Or, in humane actions that are common to all men, whither they concern
manners, families, or Commonwealths. In all these outward actions Man has
free will, either to choose, or to refuse them, though it be but weak, as Romans
2. 14.

By Adams fall the will received impotency, insomuch as it can not will, nor
lust after that which is indeed good, and which does please God, and is
acceptable to him, 1 Cor. 2. 14. Romans 5. 6. Phil. 2. 13.

And it received by Adams fall an inward Rebellion, whereby it does utterly
abhor that which is good; and will, and desire only that which is evil.

The will in the first Act of conversion to God is not an agent, but a patient,
as it does appear by this. For,

The affections have by Adams fall received a disorder, and by reason of this
disorder they do eschew good; and pursue that which is evil; Romans 1. 26. 1
Kings 21. 4.

The body by Adam's fall has received a fitness to begin sin, for it brings
in all objects and occasions of sin to the Soul; Genes. 3. 6.

And the body has received a fitness to execute sin, even so soon as the heart
thinks it. Romans 6. 13. 16.

Of Actual sin.
3. Actual sin.
Actual sin arises from Original sin; Actual sin is either inward, or outward.

Inward Actual sin, is in the Mind, Will, and affections.

The Actual sin of the mind is the evil thought assented to, or the evil
resolves, purposes, and intents thereof.

Examples of these Actual sins are these, Examples of Actual sin of the mind.
As

When a Man thinks that there is no God, Ps. 10. 4. and 14. 1.

Or, That there is neither providence nor presence of God in this World, Ps.
10. 11.

An immagination of safeguard from peril, and yet there is a course of sinning;
Ps. 10. 6. Rev. 18. 7.

Better esteem of a Man's self then ought to be, and worse esteem of others than
ought to be, Rev. 18. 7. Luke 18. 11.

When a Man thinks that the Gospel of God's Kingdom is mere foolishness, 1
Cor. 2. 14.

And when a Man thinks uncharitablely and maliciously of such as serve God
sincerly, Matthew. 12. 24.

When a Man puts the day of death far off, Isai 28 15.

When a Man thinks to run on in sin, and yet that he can eschew the pains of
Hell, Isai 28. 15.

When also a Man thinks that though he hold on his sins, yet that God will
defer both his particular judgment, and the last judgment; Luke 12. 19. 45.

When as God does open our eyes, we do see these evil thoughts rebelliously
rising in our minds even as sparckles out of a Chimney; yet in this will
carnal Men pretend a good meaning.

These are the examples of the Actual sins of the mind.

The Actual sins of bothwill, Actual sin of the Will and affections.
and affections, are all wicked motions, inclinations, and desires, Gal. 5. 17.

Of outward Actual sin.
Outward Actual sins are all those in the committing of which, Outward Actual
sin.
the Members of the body do join with the faculties of the Soul to act them.

Such sins as these are infinite, Psalm. 40. 12.

Outward Actual sins are either sins of Omission, or of Commission, both which
are either in Word, or Deed.

The degrees of the sin of Commission are these, Degrees of sins of Commission.
Jam. 1. 14. 15.

1. Temptation when as the Devil offers to the mind that which is evil to
allure a man to sin, John 13. 2. Act. 5. 3. 1 Chronicles. 21. 1.

And this is also effected by occasion of external objects, which the senses
perceive, Job 31. 1.

Of Tentation.
Tentation has two parts. 1. Abstraction. Tentation.
2. Inescation.

Abstraction is the first thought of committing sin; Abstraction.
by it the mind is withdrawn from Gods service, for which it should be always
ready pressed, Luke 10. 27.

Inescation. ( i. e. To take by a bait.
Inescation is an evil thought conceived, and for a time retained in the mind,
and it being thus kept in the mind, it does by delighting the Will and
Affections, lay a bait for a Man to draw him to consent.

2. The second degree of sin of Commission is Conception. Conception.


Conception of sin is, when the heart consents and resolves to commit sin,
Psalm. 7. 14.

3. The third degree of it is the birth of sin. The birth of sin.
That is the very acting and committing of sin; As when the faculties of the
Soul, and the powers of the body join together to act sin.

The fourth degree of the Commission Perfection of sin.
of sin is the perfection of sin; That is when sin by custom is made perfect,
and ripe; And then it brings forth death and damnation; and this is all that
the sinner reapeth by his sin, an example of this we have in Pharo.

The differences of sins of Commission Differences of sin of Commission.
are these:

1. To consent with an offendour and not actually to commit sin, Ephesians. 5. 11.

This a man does. Consent,
1. When he does in judgment allow the sin of another, Number. 20. 10. 12. 2.
When the heart approves in affection and consent; as do Ministers and
Magistrates, when they do conceal and winck at offenses, 1 Samuel 2. 23. 29. 3.
When sin is done indeed by Counsel, presence, or inticement, as Romans 1. 13.
Mark 6. 25. 26. Act. 22. 20.

2. The second difference of sin of Commission is.

Sinning ignorantly, Sin of ignorance.
that is, when a man does not expressly and distinctly know, whither that which
he does be a sin, or not, or if he do know it, he does not acknowledge and mark
it, 1 Timothy 1. 13. Numb. 35. 24. 1 Cor. 4. 4. Ps. 10. 13.

3. The third difference of sin of Commission;

Is, Sin of knowledge.
when any Man sins upon knowledge, but yet of infirmity, as when a Man
fearing some eminent danger, or when a Man amazed at the horror of death, does
against his knowledge deny that truth, which otherwise he would acknowledge and
embrace: Such was the fall of Peter, arising from the rashness of his mind,
mingled with some fear.

Thus do men offend by the strength of the corruptions of their flesh,
provoking them to that which their heart does detest, Romans 7. 19.

The fourth difference of it is, Presumptuous sinning upon knowledge;
Presumptuous sin.
as Psalm. 19. 13. of this kind is. 1. Every sin committed with an high hand,
or in contempt of God, Numb. 15. 30. Secondly, presumption of Gods mercy,
though we do evil, and run on in it, Eccles. 8. 11. Romans 2. 4.

5. The fifth difference of sin of Commission is,

Sinning upon knowledge, Sin of knowledge with malice.
and out of self malice against God. Of this kind is the sin against the holy
Ghost.

The punishment of sin.
Man is punished for sin, Punishment of sin in this life.
first in this life, either

1. In body. As 1. by care for the provision for his body, and by trouble for
the things of this life, Genes. 3. 17. Secondly, by proneness to diseases,
Matthew. 9. 2. Joh. 5. 14. Deuteronomy. 28. 21. 22. Thirdly, by shame of nakedness,
Genes. 3. 7. Fourthly, by pains as are in Women in Travail, and Childbirth,
Genes. 3. 16.

2. In Soul. As 1. By a trembling of Conscience. Secondly, by care. Thirdly, by
trouble. Fourthly, by hardness of heart. Fifthly, by madness, Deuteronomy. 28. 28.

3. In both body and Soul. As first, by a fearful subjection to the Regiment
of Satan, Colos. 1. 13. Heb. 2. 14. Secondly, by a separation from the
fellowship of God, and a trembling at his presence, Ephesians. 4. 18. Genesis 3. 10.

4. By diverse calamities and damages in his goods, Deuteronomy. 28. 29.

5. By the loss of dignity, and Lordly Authority, which he had over all the
Creatures; and by the vanity, weakening, corrupting, and abating of the
excellency, virtues, and powers of the Creatures, as Romans 8. 20. 21.

6. Or in his name; By infamy and ignominy before, and after his death, Jer.
24. 6. All these things come alike to all, yet doubtless it is by reason of
sin, by Adams fall, and since that, by our improvement of our Original and
Actual corruptions.

Secondly, Punishment of sin at the last gasp.
Man is punished for sin at the last gasp. First, by death, or 2. by a change,
like unto death, Rom 6. 23.

Thirdly, Man is punished for sin after this life, by an eternal separation from
the presence of God, and from his exceeding excellent glory, 2 These. 1. 9.

Of Election and his foundation of it.
Predestination has two parts. Election.
1. Election. 2. Reprobation, 1 These. 5. 9.

Election is the decree of God, concerning the salvation of some men, to the
praise of the glory of his grace, Ephesians. 1. 4. 5. 6.

This decree of God is the book of life wherein the names of the Elect are
written, Rev. 20. 12. 2 Timothy 2. 19.

The execution of this decree is The execution of the decree of Election.
Gods effectual working of all those things which he purposed for the salvation
of the Elect, by the same means with which he purposed to do it, Romans 18. 29.
30.

The foundation of this decree is Christ Jesus, Heb. 5. 5. Isai 42. 1. Ephesians. 1.
4.

The means of accomplishing this decree is Gods Covenant, and the seal thereof.

Gods Covenant is either the Gods Covenant.
Covenant of works, or of grace.

Gods Covenant of works is the moral Law, or ten Commandments.

Gods Covenant of grace is his free promise of Christ and all his benefits to
man, if man will repent him of his sins, and by faith receive Christ.

The Seals of the Covenant are the Sacraments. The Seals of the Covenant.


Gods Covenant of works, Covenant of works.
which is called the moral Law, Decalogue, or ten Commandments, is divided into
two Tables.

The first Table contains four Commandments.

The second Table contains six Commandments.

Every Commandment is both affirmative and negative. That is, it does both
command and forbid.

As it is Affirmative it binds at all times, but not to all times.

As it is Negative it binds at all times, and to all times.

Under one Vice expressly forbidden are comprehended all of that kind; yea, the
least cause, occasion, or inticement thereto are forbidden, Joh. 3. 15. Matthew.
5. 21.

The first Commandment.
Thou shall have no other Gods before me. First Commandment.


In this first Commandment are these affirmatives. First that we must
acknowledge God.

Secondly, Affirmative part of it.
that we must acknowledge no other God but him.

The marks of the true love of God are these.

1. To hear his word willingly.

2. To speak often off him.

3. To think often off him.

4. To do his will without irksomness.

5. To give body, and all for his cause.

6. To desire his presence above all, and to bewail his absence.

7. To embrace all such things as appertain to him.

8. To love and hate that which he loves and hates.

9. To seek to please him in all things.

10. To draw others unto the love of him.

11. To esteem highly of such gifts and graces as he bestows.

12. To stay our selves upon his Connsels revealed in his word.

13. To call upon his Name with affiance.

The Negative part of this Commandment is this. Negative part.


We must not account that God which is not God.

In this Negative part of this Commandment we are forbidden these things.

1. Ignorance of the true God and of his will.

2. Atheism, which is a denying of God, or of his Attributes; as off his
justice, wisdom, providence, presence, Ps. 14. 1.

3. Errors concerning God, or concerning the Persons of the Diety, or
concerning Gods Attributes.

Here Helenism, or the adoring of a multiplicity of Gods is forbidden.

4. The setting of our hearts and affections upon any thing else but one God.

The heart is drawn from God by these means.

1. By distrusting of God, Heb. 10. 38. From this distrust arises.

First, impatiency in suffering afflictions, Jer. 20. 14. 13. 18.

Secondly, a tempting of God, and this is when the man that distrusteth and
contemns God, seeks an experiment of Gods truth and power, Matthew. 4. 7. 1
Cor. 10. 9. 10.

3. A desperation, Genes. 4. 13.

4. A doubting concerning the truth of God, or concerning his benefits, either
present, or to come, Ps. 116. 11.

2. By confidence of Creatures, as 1. when a man puts trust in the strength
of the Creatures, as Jer. 17. 5. or 2. In riches, Matthew. 6. 24. Ephesians. 5. 5. or
3. In defenced places, Jer. 40. 16. or 4. In pleasures, or dainties, and who so
trusts in these does make his belly his God, Phil. 3. 19. or 5. In
Physicians, 2 Chronicles. 16. 12. or 6. In the Devil and his works. Thus Magicians
trust in the Devil: and Witches, and all such as seek help at their hands,
Levit. 20. 6.

3. The heart is drawn away from God, by loving the Creature too much, and more
than God, Matthew. 10. 37. Joh. 12* 43.

And by self Love, 2 Timothy 3. 2.

4. By hatred and contempt of God, as when a man declining from God, does fly
from God, and is angry with God when he punishes sin, Romans 8. 7. and 1. 30.

5. By want of the fear of God, Ps. 36. 1.

6. By fearing the Creature more than the Creator.

7. By hardness of heart and carnal security, as when a man will neither
acknowledge Gods judgments nor his own sins, Romans 2. 5. Luke 21. 34.

8. By pride, and presumption, as when a man ascribes that to his own industry
and merit, which is only due to God, 1 Cor. 4. 6. 7. Genes. 3. 5.

The highest stair of prides ladler, is that fearful presumption of men, of
climbing rashly into Gods seat of Majesty, as if they were Gods, Act. 12. 22.
23. 2 These. 2. 4.

The second Commandment.
Thou shall not make unto thee any graven Image, Second Commandment.
or any likeness of any thing that is in Heaven above, or that is in the Earth
beneath, or that is in the water under the Earth.

Thou shall not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them: for I the Lord thy
God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the Fathers upon the children,
unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.

And showing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
Commandments.

The Affirmative part of this Commandment is this. Affirmative part of it.


Thou shall worship God in Spirit and in truth, Joh. 4. 24.

Here we are first commanded to use the ordinary means of worshipping God: As

1. The calling upon the name of the Lord. First, by humble supplication, 1 Timothy 2. 1.

2. By hearty thanksgiving.

3. By reading, hearing, talking, and continually meditating on the word of God.

4. By the use of the Sacraments, as Act. 2. 41. 42. and 20. 7.

Secondly, we are here commanded to use these means holily, that is, as God in
his word has commanded to use them, Matthew. 28. 20. 1 Cor. 14. 40. Eccles. 5.
1. Ps. 26. 6.

Furtherance of Gods Worship Are leagues of amity, with those that truly fear
God, and serve him according to his word, 2 Chr. 19. 2. Malaeh. 2. 11.

And such Covenants as the Magistrates and people make together with God, for
the preservation of Christian Religion, 2 Chronicles. 15. 12. 14.

The Negative part of this Commandment is this: Negative part of it.


Thou shall neither worship false Gods, nor the true God with false worship.

Here we are forbidden these things.

First, to represent God by any image, similitude, likeness, or figure
whatsoever, Deuteronomy. 4. 15. 20.

For all idols are lies, Habak. 2. 18. Zach. 10. 2. Jer. 10. 8.

Secondly, we are here forbidden the least approbation of idolatry, Hosea 13.
2. Genesis 48. 10. And therefore all processions, plays, feasts, that are
consecrated to the memorial, and honor of idols, Exodus 32. 6. 1 Cor. 10. 7.

Thirdly, all relics, badges, and monuments of idols, Exodus 23. 13. Isai 30.
22.

Fourthly, we are here forbidden all society with infidels: As 1. Marriage with
them, Genes. 6. 2. Deuteronomy. 7. 3. 4. Malach. 2. 11. Ezra 9. 14. 2 Kings 8. 18. 2.
All leagues and confederacy with them in war, either to assist them, or to
receive assistance from them, and that for these causes.

1. Because it does obscure Gods glory, and makes him in appearance either
unwilling, or unable to aid his Church.

2. Because in so doing we shall without doubt infect our selves with their
impieties and idolatries.

3. Because we are thus endangered to be made partakers of their punishments, 2 Chronicles. 19. 2. With idolaters we are also forbidden all traffic in such wares,
as we know may further the service of their idols.

We are also forbidden with idolaters all Trials in Law, before Judges that are
infidels, when Christian Courts are open, and may be frequented, 1 Cor. 6. 6.
But if Christian Courts be not open, we may according to St. Paul's rule appeal
from one Court of infidels to another; so from Festus he himself appealed to
Caesar, Act. 25. 11.

Such necessities as these do make traffic, and other things to be frequently
used, which otherwise are unlawful.

We are here also forbidden all worshipping of the Beast, and receiving of his
mark, Revel. 14. 9.

Fifthly, Idolatry and Superstition.
we are here forbidden all Will worship, or worship of God after our own
fancies, in ways which are not waranted by the word of God, though we do
pretend good intention for the doing of it, Collos. 2. 23. 1 Samuel 13. 9. 10.
13. whither it be by Superstitions, Sacrifices, Meats, Apparel, observing
Ceremonies, Gestures, or by our Gate, Conversations, Pilgrimage, or by building
of Altars, Pictures, or Idols, and the like; or by Temples, or by strange
consorts of Music, or by Monastical vows of single life, or of poverty, 1 Cor.
14 15. 1 Cor. 7. 9.

1. Such vows as these are altogether repugnant to the Law of God. 2. They are
greater then man's nature can perform. 3. They do disanull Christian Liberty,
and make such things necessary as are indifferent. 4. They do renew Judaisme:
5. They are idolatrous, because they make them part of Gods worship, and esteem
them meritorious. 6. They are Hypocrisy, for they are but an outward show of
Gods worship, Matthew. 15. 7.

The effects of Hypocrisy are these. Effects of Hypocrisy.


First, to make a glorious show of serving God, and yet to seek nothing else by
it, but the pomp and glory of the World.

Secondly, to observe and take notice of other men's faults, and behavior, and
not to see, or mind our own.

Thirdly, to be more zealous, and curious in the observation of the Ancient
Traditions, then of the Statutes and Commandments of Almighty God.

Fourthly, to strain at a gnat, and swallow a Camel; or to omit serious
affairs, and the weighty matters of Gods word, and to hunt after trifles,
Matthew. 23. 24.

Fifthly, to do all things to be seen of men, Matthew. 6. 5. and 23. 5.

Sixthly, to fast with an opinion of Merit is Hypocrisy, and to make a
distinction of meats for the same; The like also is all external abstinence
from meats, if it be without an internal abstinence from sin, and unlawful
desires, Isai 58. 5. 6.

6. We are here forbidden all contempt, neglect, and intermission of Gods
service, Revel. 3. 15. 16.

7. We are here forbidden all corrupting of Gods worship, and of that order of
government, which he has ordained for his Church; And this we do when we
either add to Gods worship, or diminish it, or mangle it, Deuteronomy 12. 32.

8. We are here forbidden all Religious reverence of the Creature, Revel. 22.
8. Acts 10. 25.

9. We are forbidden all worship of Devils, under which is comprehended all
kinds of Magic.

Magic is a mischievous Art, Magic* a wicked Art.
accomplishing wonders by the assistance of the Devil.

The Devil effects wonders and merveils, not by making a new thing which was
not at all before, but by moving, transporting, and applying natural things
diversely, by making a thin body thick and foggy, and by bewitching and holding
of men's senses.

The foundation of Magic is a Covenant with Satan.

And this Covenant is such a contract, as does make, men mutually to have to do
with the Devil:

The Original of this mutual contract is this. First, The foundation of Magic
is a contract with the Devil.


Satan, or the Devil makes choice of such men to be his servants, as are by
nature, either notorious bad persons, or else very seemingly silly, or indeed,
silly Souls.

Then does he offer to them diverse means, either by Magicians, or by their
writings, or by teaching and instruction from himself.

The means which the Devil offers for this purpose, are such as are used for
the producing of such an effect, as by their own nature they were never
ordained for: Nor is there any word of God for the doing of them, but against
it.

These Satanical means are obscure words, and words of Scripture wrested and
abused; Holy water, Sieves, Seals, Glasses, Images, bowings of the knee, and
such like diverse gestures, The use of which according to his own will, and to
his own purpose, he teaches sometimes by secret whispers, or suggestions; and
sometimes, either, by the words, or writings of Magicians. And when they have
embraced these means, and do declare their Satanical confidence by their
earnest endeavor to use, and practice this kind of wickedness by these means,
the Devil stands ready to assist them, and he alone it is that does by these
means, which are void of all such virtue as is supposed, effect that which his
wicked instrument intended.

Then having brought them on thus far, the Devil Counterfeits God, and makes as
though he was God. And as God has his word and Sacraments, and Faith; so
likewise the Devil has his Characters, Gestures, and Sacrifices, which are as
it were his Sacraments, by which he does signify to his Devilish Magicians;
his own Devilish pleasure, and by the use of the same they do testify their
obedience to him.

And as God is delighted with his servants calling upon him. So likewise the
Devil is delighted with the Magical ceremonies of his servants, and with their
invocations.

The Covenant with the Devil is The Covenant with the Devil is either secret,
or express.
either secret, or express.

The secret Covenant with the Devil is, when the party does not expressly
compact and Covenant with the Devil, but yet in heart does allow of his means,
and does assuredly believe that by the using of such means wonders may be
effected.

Express Covenant with the Devil is when the party does not only trust in him,
but also Covenant with him, and give himsel holely to him upon condition that
he may by the observing of certain ceremonies accomplish his desires.

Magic is either Divining, or working.

Divining is a foretelling of things to come by the help of the Devil. Divining.


Prediction, or foretelling is done either with means, or without means.

Prediction, or foretelling of things by means are chese.

1. Sooth-saying, or Divining by the flying of birds, Deuteronomy. 8. 10.

2. Divination by looking into the entrails of beasts, Ezekiel. 21. 22.

3. Necromancy, or Conjuring, Necromancy.
This is, an asking counsel at the dead, The Devil does appear to them that
thus ask counsel, in the form of the dead man, as appears by the story of the
Witch of Endor, 1 Samuel 28. 11. 13. 14.

Divining, Prediction, or foretelling without means, is called Pythonisme.

Pythonisme is* when one is possessed Pythonism.
with an unclean Spirit, and does immediately use the help of the same Spirit to
charm with, or to reveal, and discover secrets by. Such a one was the Damsel
Pythoness, spoken of by the Acts, that by her Spirit of Divination brought her
Master much gain, Acts 16. 16. Concerning this kind of Divination there is
mention made, Isai 29. 4. where God threatening his judgments upon Jerusalem,
says, Thy voice shall be out of the ground, like him that has a spirit of
Divination (or a familiar Spirit) and thy talking, or speech shall whisper, or
peep, or chirp out of the dust.

Working Magic, Working Magic.
or Magic operative has two parts.

1. Juggling, which is when as the devil does work by his conveyance, many
things which seem great and hard, as Exodus 7. 10. 11. 12.

2. Enchantments, or charmings, by these kind of Charms, Enchantments.
Beasts, young Children, and Men of ripe years are offt enfected, poysend,
hurt, bounden, killed, and otherwise molested.

By charms the Devil does also offt cure diseases: Charms.
As

1. By mumbling up some few words.

2. By making certain Characters and figures.

3. By framing of Circles.

4. By hanging Amulets about the Necks, and other parts of the body, a thing
too frequently used now adays for the curing of diseases, which Physicians call
a curing of diseases by occult, and specific qualities of remedies.

5. By the abuse of Herbs and Medicines to this purpose.

To such as these it is that Solomon, speaks in Eccles. 10. 11. saying,
Surely the Serpent will bite without enchantment.

Those that do consult with Magicians do also worship the Devil, for they do
revolt from God to the Devil; Howsoever, they do plaster up their impiety with
untempered Mortar, as that they seek Gods help though by the means of
Magicians, 1 Samuel 28. 13. Levit. 20. 6. Isai 8. 19. 20.

The third Commandment.
Thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: Third Commandment.
for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that takes his Name in vain.

The Affirmative part of this Commandment is this. Affirmative part.


Here we are first commanded to be zealous for Gods glory, above all things in
the World, Numb. 25. 8. Ps. 69. 9.

Secondly, to use Gods Titles only in serious affairs, and that with all
reverence, Deuteronomy. 28. 58. Romans 9. 5.

Thirdly, to celebrate the praise of God, which we see brightly shining in his
Creatures, Jer. 5. 22.

To this part of this Commandment an Oath does belong, An Oath.
the parts of which are these.

1. Confirmation of a Truth. Its parts.


2. Invocation of God alone, as a witness of the truth, and a revenger of a ly.

3. A confession that God is a revenger of perjury; when he is brought in as a
false witness.

4 A binding over unto punishment, if in it deceit be used.

The form of an Oath is this. Its form.


1. We must swear truly, least we forswear.

2. Justly, least we swear to that which is wicked.

3. In judgment, least we swear rashly, or for a trifle, Jer. 4. 2. Isa. 48. 1.

There are some persons whose Oaths bind them not, as the Oaths of those that
swear in their drink; and the Oaths of Frantic, furious men, Fools, and
children bind them not.

The end of an Oath is to confirm some necessary truth in question, as Heb. 6.
16. Romans 1. 9. 2 Cor. 2. 23.

An Oath is either public, or private.

A public Oath is, when a Magistrate without any peril to him that swears,
does upon just cause desire a Testimony under the reverence of an Oath.

A private Oath is that, which two, or more in serious affairs take privately,
as did Jacob and Laban, and as did Boaz and Ruth.

An asseveration is like an Oath, but is no Oath.

An asseveration is nothing else but an earnest assertion of our meaning, An
Asseveration what it is?
the name of a Creature being sometimes used in it.

An asseveration without the use of the Name of the Creature is this of Christ.
Verily, verily, I say unto you, Joh. 10. 1.

An asseveration with the use of the name of the Creature, is this of David:
Indeed as the Lord lives, and as thy Soul lives, 1 Samuel 20. 3.

Though it be unlawful to swear by Creatures, yet thus far may we use them in
an Oath, as to make them pledges, and as it were cognisances of Gods glory.

An Oath that a man makes of a lawful thing must be performed, though with
great difficulty, Psalm. 15. 4.

Or it might be redeemed, as Numb. 27. 2.

The Oath of Maids under the Jurisdiction of Parents, Oath of Maids.
might by the Father of the Maid be disallowed in the day that he heard it; And
so likewise the Oath of a married Woman by her Husband in the day that he
hears it, Number. 30. 3. 6.

If a Man swear to perform things unlawful, either out of ignorance, error,
infirmity, or any other way, his Oath is to be recalled, for we must not add
sin to sin, 1 Samuel 25. 21. 22. 33.

Here we are commanded to sanctify Gods Creatures, as Meats, Drinks, Works,
Callings, Marriage bed, by the reverent use of the holy Name of God. As by
calling upon his Name for a blessing on them, or returning thanks to his Name
for the benefit of them.

The means of the sanctification of Creatures are two. 1. The word of God. 2.
Prayer, 1 Timothy 4. 4.

The word teaches us how to use the Creatures to the glory of God, Ps. 119.
24.

Prayer is a Petition by which we do obtain of Gods Majesty assistance by his
grace, to make an holy use of his Creatures, and ordinances, Ephesians 5. 18.

Prayer is used upon particular occasions: As

Sometimes for a prosperous journey, Act. 21. 5.

Sometimes for a blessing upon meat, or drink, Joh. 6. 11.

Sometimes for good issue of Childbirth, 1 Samuel 1. 12.

Sometimes for good success in business, Genes. 24. 12.

Thanksgiving is the magnifying of Gods Name through Christ, for his grace,
aid, and blessing, in use of the Creatures, Phil. 4. 6. 1 These. 5. 18.

It is also used after meat, Deuteronomy. 8. 10.

Sometimes after the loss of outward wealth, Job 1. 21.

For deliverance out of servitude, Exodus 10. 18.

Sometimes for obtaining of children, Genesis 29. 35.

Sometimes for Victory, 2 Samuel 32. 1.

Sometimes for good success in domestical affairs, Thus Abraham's servant did,
Genesis 24. 48.

The Negative part of this Commandment is this.

1. Here Perjury is forbidden, that is, Negative part.
when a man swears to do a thing and does not perform it, Matt. 5. 33.
Perjury contains under it.

1. Either lying unto God. Or lying, or Invocation on Gods Name to confirm a
ly. And contempt of Gods threatenings.

2. We are here forbidden to swear any thing that is false by the Name of God;
For this is to make God like the Devil, Joh. 8. 44. Zach. 5. 4.

3. To swear in common talk, Matthew. 5. 37.

4. To swear by strange Gods, or by that which is no God, Jer. 12. 16. and 5. 7.

5. Blasphemy, that is, a reproach of, and against God; and a contempt of his
Majesty, Levit. 24. 15. 16.

6. All cursing of enemies, or of our selves in any kind what ever.

7. All use of Gods Name carelessly in our common talk, Phil. 2. 10. Isai 45. 23.

8. Here is forbidden the abuse of Gods Creatures, whither it be by deriding
Gods workmanship, or his manner of working; for in all things we must give God
his praise and glory, 1 Cor. 10. 31. Ps. 191.

9. Here is forbidden the abuse of lots, because the disposition of them does
immediately come from the Lord, and the proper use of them is to decide great
controversies, Prove. 16. 33. and 18. 18.

The land of Canaan was divided by lots, Joshua 14. 15.

The Priests under the Law were commanded to choose the escape Goat by lot,
Levit. 16. 8. 10. The use of lots we may also read of in these places of
Scripture, Joshua 7. 13. to the 19. 1 Samuel 10. 20. 21. 22 23. Acts 1. 26.

10. Here is also forbidden Superstition, that is, an opinion conceived of the
works of Gods providence contrary to Gods word, and to the course of nature.

Examples of this Superstition are these.

To think it unlucky to have Salt fall toward a man, Superstitions.


Or have a hare cross the way before him,

Or to have the right ear burn,

Or to think it good luck to find old iron,

Or to have the left ear burn,

Or to have drink spilled upon a man.

Or to pair the Nails upon some day of the week,

Or to dream of some certain things,

Or to think that beasts may be tamed, by verses, short prayers, or other
charms,

Or to think that the repetition of the Creed, or Lords prayer can infuse into
Herbs, or other things, a faculty of healing diseases.

Palmestry is a Superstitious thing of this kind. Palmestry.
Such abominations as these are all detested of God, and ought also to be
detestable in the eyes of Gods people, as appears, Deuteronomy. 18. 10. 11.

11. Here is also forbidden Astrology; Astrology.
whither in the calculating of Nativities, or used in Prognostications, For in
these regards Astrology is nothing else but the abuse of the Heavens, and off
the Stars. M. P. p^
For the Imaginary twelve Houses are made o^ the fained signs of a supposed
Zodiak, in the highest sphere, which is commonly called the first moveable, and
truly, because it is thus high, therefore can no man certainly know their
influence and virtues.

This Art can not arise from experience, Ibidem.
because the same position of all Stars never happen twice, and if they did,
yet there could be no observation made of them, because the influencies of the
Stars are all confusedly mixed, both in the Air, and in the Earth, even as if
all herbs were mingled together in one Vessel.

By this Art, Astrology draws men's minds from the contemplation of Gods
providence.
Men's minds are drawn from the contemplation of Gods Providence, when as they
shall hear that all things fall out by the motion, and position of the Stars.

Stars were not ordained to foretell things to come, but to distinguish days,
months, and years, Genes. 1. 14. Isai 47. 13.

Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counselors, Let now the
Astrologers, the Star-gazers, and Prognosticatours, stand up and save thee from
the things which shall come upon thee, Dan. 2. 2.

Books of this kind they were that for zeal of Gods glory, and love to the
truth were burned by the faithful, in the days of the Apostles, such as these
were the curious Arts those books treated off, Act. 19. 19.

All Astrological predictions are conversant, or busied about such things, as
do either simplely depend on the will, or dispensation of God, or about such
things as do depend upon Man's free will, (and so are altogether contingent, and
therefore can neither be foreseen nor foretold,) and not upon the Heavens.

It is impossible by the bare knowledge of such a cause as is both common to
many, and far distant from such things as it works in, precisely and
infalliblely to set down particular effects.

The Stars have indeed a great force, but such as does manifest it self only
in the operation, which it has in the four principal qualities of natural
things, as in heat, cold, moisture, dryness.

The Stars can not at all force the will, or give the least inclination to it.
It is beyond the reach of man to define how great the force of the Stars is.

The effects of the Sun and of the Moon, Effects of the Sun and Moon.
are apparent in the constitution of the four parts of the year. But the
effects of the Planets and of the fixed Stars, though they be of great force,
and innumerable, are not so manifest unto us. And now, because a man can know
but some Stars only, and their operations, and not all the Stars, and all
their operations and forces, he can not certainly foretell future things, or
things to come; yea, though they did depend on the Stars. For though the
position of certain Stars do demonstrate such an effect to ensue, yet the
Aspects of such Stars as we know not may hinder those effects, and produce the
contrary for ought we know.

That part of Astrology which concerns the alteration of the Air, M. P. p. 44*
is for the most part of it false and frivolous, and therefore all manner of
predictions grounded upon the Doctrine of it, are nothing else but toys and
delusions.

And that part of Astrology which concerns Nativities, Astrology concerning
Nativities is wicked.
Revolutions, Progressions, Directions of Nativities, Elections of times, and
the finding again, of things lost, is very wicked; yea, it is very probable
that this Art, is of the same brood with implicit Magic, and that for these
reasons.

1. Because the word of God reckons Astrologers amongst Magicians,
Astrologers how they are reckoned of in Scripture.
and adjudgeth them both to the same punishment.

2. Because the precepts of that part of this Art which concerns predictions
are rediculous; And therefore such things can not be told by them, but by a
secret suggestion from the Devil, or instinct of the Devil.

Augustine, lib. 5. cap. 7. de Civitate Dei, says the same, For says he, if
we weigh well all those things, we will not without cause believe, that
Astrologers, when they do wonderfully declare many truths, work by some secret,
instinct of evil Spirits, (which desire to fill men's brains with dangerous and
erroneous opinions concerning starry destinies;) And not by any Art derived
from any inspection and consideration of the Horoscope, which indeed is none.

12. Here is also forbidden Popish Consecration of Water and Salt, to restore
the mind to health and to chase away Devils.

13. Here is also forbidden making jests of the Scripture, Isa. 66. 2.

14. Also, all setting-light of Gods Judgments, which are seen in the World,
Matthew. 26. 34. 35. Luke 13. 1. 2. 3.

15. Here is also forbidden all dissolute conversation, Matthew. 5. 16. 2 Samuel
12. 14.

The fourth Commandment.
Remember the Sabbath day, Fourth Commandment.
to keep it holy.

Six days shall thou labor, and do all thy work.

But the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shall not
do any work, thou nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, thy man servant, nor thy maid
servant, nor thy Cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates. For in six
days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all that in them is, and
rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and
hallowed it.

The Affirmative part of this Commandment is this:

We do keep it holy if we do cease from sin, Affirmative part.
and from the works of ordinary callings; and if this being done we do also
perform spiritual duties, which God does require of us.

As a preparation to the sanctification of the Sabbath day, we must rise in the
morning, and pray privately. Thus did Christ the day before the Sabbath: Mark.
1. 31. 39. Thus they were want to do under the Law, Exodus 32. 5. 6. Aaron
proclaimed, saying, to morrow shall be the holy day of the Lord; and the people
rose up early the next morning.

The Sabbath must again be sanctified, by frequenting the assemblies where we
may hear the pure word of God, Act. 13. 14. 15.

And by Meditation upon Gods word and his Creatures, Psalm. 92. Act. 17. 11.

By exercising of works of charity by visiting the sick, by giving Alms to the
needy, by admonishing those that fall; by reconciling those that are at
difference, Nehem. 11. 12.

The Sabbath is either Ceremonial, or Moral.

It is Ceremonial. Ceremonial Sabbath.
1. In respect of its strict observation.

2. As it is a Type of the inward rest of the people of God, that is, of their
continual resting from the work of sin, ( Exodus 31. 13. Ezekiel. 20. 12.) And of
the blessed rest of the faithful in the Kingdom of Heaven, Heb. 4. 10. Isa.
66. 23.

And as it was observed the seventh day after the Creation of the World, and
was then solemnized with other Ceremonies, Numb. 28. 9.

But in the light of the How the Sabbath is moral.
Gospel the Ceremony of the Sabbath is ceast, Colloss. 2. 16. 17.

The Sabbath was by the Apostles translated from the seventh day to the day
following, ( Act. 20. 7. 1 Cor. 16. 1. 2.) And this day is called the Lords
day, because our Savior rose again there on, Rev. 1. 10.

The Sabbath is moral, as it is a certain seventh day to preserve, and conserve
the Ministry of the word, and the solemn worship of God in the holy
assemblelies of the Church, and for this cause, we as well as the Jews are upon
this day enjoined rest from our vocations, Isai 58. 13.

It is also moral, because servants and Cattle are on this day freed from their
labors.

In this Commandment we are not forbidden any holy things, or things of present
necessity, as the preservation of life, or the maintaining of the glory of God,
or a Sabbath days journey, Act. 1. 12.

Or journeys unto the Prophets, or places appointed unto the worship, and
service of God, 2 Kings 4. 23.

Or works of mercy in the securing, either of life, or goods, Matthew. 12. 12.

Or provision of meat, or drink, Matthew. 12. 1.

Or watering of Cattle, Luke 13. 15.

Or curing of diseases, as did Christ and his Apostles by praying, and calling
upon the Name of God.

Or the necessary voyages of Mariners.

Or the tending of a flock by shepherds.

Or the necessary employments of Medicines, Mark. 2. 27.

The Negative part of this Commandment is this.

We must not pollute the Sabbath of the Lord, Negative part.
Matt. 24. 20. Lament. 1. 7. Levit. 19. 30.

We are here forbidden the works of all ordinary callings, and all unnecessary
things, Exodus 16. 29.

As fairs on the Sabbath day, Nehem. 13. 19.

All manner of Husbandry, plowing, sowing, reaping, mowing, and bringing in of
Harvest, Exodus 34. 21.

All jests, scurrility, sports, revellings, all manner of Prophanes, and
Hypocrisy.

The fifth Commandment.
Honor thy Father and thy Mother: Fifth Commandment.
that thy days may be long upon the land, which thy Lord thy God gives thee.

The Affirmative part of this, is this.

Here is commanded reverence, Affirmative parts.
or civil respect to the aged, and gray hairs where it is found in the way of
holiness, Levit. 19. 32. wisdom 4. 8. 9. Prove. 16. 31.

Obedience to the Lawful commands of Parents, Romans 1. 30. Ephesians. 6. 1. 1 Pet. 2.
9.

And relief of them when they stand in need, 2 Timothy 3. 3.

Here we are commanded to obey superiors, yea, though cruel, but not in
wickedness, Romans 13. 1. 2. 1 Pet. 2. 13. 14. 18. Act. 4 19. 1 Pet. 2. 19. 20.
Genes. 16. 6. 9. Colloss. 3. 23. 24. Romans 13. 1. 2.

And to pray for Superiors, for Elders that rule well, and for such as are in
Authority, 1 Timothy 2. 1. 2. and 5. 17.

We are here commanded to salute one another with holy signs, 1 Pet. 5. 14.
Romans 16. 16. Thus did Moses salute Jethro, Exodus 18. 7. Jacob the Shepherds,
Genes. 29. 4. And Boaz the reapers, Ruth 2. 4.

Here Superiors are commanded to carry themselves as brethren to inferiors,
Deuteronomy. 17. 20. As did Job to his servants, as did Naaman to Elisha, 2 Kings 5.
13. 14.

They must be as lights to shine before others by good example of a blameless
life, Tit. 2. 2. 3. 1 Pet. 5. 3. Phil. 4. 9.

They must rule in the Lord, Deuteronomy. 17. 19. Collos. 4. 1.

They must provide good things, both for the bodies and Souls, of those that
are under authority, Romans 13. 4. Isai 49. 23. Psalm. 13 2. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.

They must punish light faults by rebukes, and great faults by correction.
First, In punishing.

They must make a diligent enquiry and examination concerning the fault
committed.

Secondly, they must discover to the parties offending the grievousness of
their Crimes, that they may be sensible of the evils they have done.

Thirdly, they must defer, and omit punishment, in hope of amendment, Eccls. 7.
23. 1 Samuel 10. 27.

Fourthly, they must punish in Gods Name, and not in their own; and that with
an holy reverence, Deuteronomy. 25. 2. And as did Joshua Achan, Josh. 7. 19. 25.

Fifthly, in their punishing they must aim only at the glory of God, and the
best good of the Soul of the party offending, as Prove. 20. 30.

Parents are here commanded to provide for the good estate of their Children. 1 Timothy 5. 10.

Cruelty must not be used in punishing, Ephesians. 6. 4. 9. Jam. 2. 13.

Here we are commanded as concerning our selves, to preserve the gifts and
graces God has put into us, Phil. 4. 8.

Men do offend against themselves, when they do extinguish the gifts of God,
Matthew. 25. 2. 26.

Natural Parents and Superiors are no otherwise to be obeyed, but in the Lord,
Ephesians. 5. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 9.

By Parents here is meant natural Parents, Magistrates, Ministers, Elders, and
such as excel in gifts of God. To the four first of these, men do ordinarily
give honor, and they receive it as their due, Joh. 5. 44. But Christians
faithful men, and true believers, are by the command of Christ forbidden to
call any man Father upon Earth, Matt. 23. 9. Or to esteem of themselves one
greater then another, or to go about to take upon themselves any Authority, or
Dominion one over another, Matthew 18. 4. and 20. 25. 26.

The Negative part.

Here contempt of Superiors are forbidden, Negative part.
Genes. 9. 22. Prove. 30. 17. Exo^ 117. And disobedience. Romans 1. 30. 2 Timothy 3.
2. Genesis 6. 2. and 28. 8. 9.

Parents are here forbidden cruelty to their Children, either in correction,
threatening, or provocation, Ephesians. 6. 4. 9.

Servants are here forbidden stubborness, Titus 2. 6.

And deceitfulness, Tit. 2. 10.

To fly from their Masters, 16. 6. 9.

To resist lawful Authority, 1 Pet. 2. 20.

And to obey unlawful commands, Genesis 39. 12. Act. 4. 19.

Here is forbidden; The rebellious disobliging of Children, their lawful
duties to Parents, Matthew. 15. 4. 5. 1 Timothy 5. 4.

And the disobliging of such as are now subjects. Their lawful obedience to
Princes, as 1 Samuel 26. 8. 9.

Here we are forbidden to offend our equals, either in word, or deed, Matthew.
20. 20. 21. 24.

The sixth Commandment. Sixth Commandment.

Thou shall not kill.

The Affirmative part of this, The Affirmative part.
is this.

Here we are commanded to preserve the welfare of our Neighbor, both in body
and in Soul, Romans 12. 15. Job 29. 15. 2 Cor. 8. 3. Joh. 11. 25. Isai 24. 16.

To help him in his straights, to the utmost of our powers, and that speedily,
Prove. 3. 28. Levit. 19. 17.

To help him to bear his troubles by taking part with him, and sharing with him
in his adversities, Ps. 119. 136. Isai 24. 16. Romans 12. 15. Joh. 11. 35.

We are here also commanded to abstain from anger upon small occasions, Numb.
12. 3. Prove. 19. 3.

And not to continue wrath, nor to remain in anger, or displeasure, Ephesians. 4. 26.

And freely to forgive injuries, and not to avenge our selves, Ephesians. 4. 32.

Here we are also commanded in the wants and infirmities of our Neighbors to
avoid occasions of stirring them up, and laying them open, Genesis 13. 8. and 27.
44. 45.

And to part with our own right rather then do wrong, Matthew. 17. 25. 26. 27.

And to appease anger that is kindled. 1. By overcoming evil with good, Romans
12. 21. 2. By seeking and following after peace, 1 Pet. 3. 11. 3. By courteous
answers, Prove. 15. 1. 1 Samuel 1. 14. Phil. 4. 5. 4. By passing by words, and
infirmities in men's words, and deeds, Prove. 19. 11. 5. By covering them with
silence, Prove 17. 9. For he that covers a transgression seeks love, and
love covers a multitude of faults, 1 Pet. 4. 8. 6. By taking every thing if
it be possible in the best part, 1 Cor. 13. 5.

Here is showed the lawfulness of Truces, The lawfulness of truces and
Covenants. M. P. p. 56
Covenants, and Agreements concerning peace made to maintain love, and to avoid
injuries. 1. Whither in the maintaining of ancient bounds. 2. Or to procure
security in traffic, and 3. To maintain possessions and journeys, and 4. To
maintain pensions, and commons for Cattle. Or 5. Liberties of hunting, fishing,
fowling, and getting of fuel, or other necessaries for public commodities.

Truces and Covenants in this kind, if there be no unlawful conditions, that
is, such as are unwarantable by the word of God joined to them, are lawful,
and may be made not only with Christians, but also to maintain peace with
infidels. For, that which is Godly to be performed, is likewise godly to be
promised; And it is a note of true godliness, to be as much as may be at peace
with all men, Rom 12. 18.

These examples we have for the practice of this.

Abraham, ( Genes. 21. 22. 23. 24. 27.) Covenanted thus with Abimelech.

Jacob with Laban, Genes. 31. 44. 45.

We are here commanded to preserve the life of our Neighbor.

By ministering to him food and raiment, Matthew. 25. 45.

By helping him out of all bodily dangers, 1 John 3. 16.

We are here also commanded to show our desire of the good of his body by
burying it when it is dead, as did Abraham the body of Sarah, Genes. 23. 19.

Thus did the Apostles and Disciples to the body of Stephen, Act. 8. 2.

The want of which was heretofore accounted a curse, as Jer. 22. 19.

Moses was buried by the Lord him self, Deuteronomy. 34. 5. 6.

Burial must be used without immoderate mourning, John 11. 34. 35. 36.

Here we are commanded chastity in body and mind.

Chastity is the purity of body and Soul.

The body is chaste, when it does not put in execution the lusts, and
concupiscence of the flesh, 1 These. 4. 5. 1 Cor. 7. 34.

Modesty and sobriety do preserve chastity.

Modesty is a virtue, which keeps in every work a holy comelines.

Modesty is seen in the countenance and eyes, when as they do not express, nor
excite the concupiscence of the heart, Job 31. 1. Genes. 24. 56. Prove. 7. 13.

Modesty is also seen in a man's words, when as his talk is holy decent and

2. They must fast often, 1 Cor. 9. 27.

3. They must take heed they burn not in lust, 1 Cor. 7. 9.

Chastity in wedlock is, when the holy and pure use of wedlock is observed,
Hebr. 13. 4.

Cautions for preserving purity in wedlock. Cautions ^or pre^^rving ^urity.


1. Contracts must be made in the Lord, and with the faithful only, Malach.
2. 11. 1 Cor. 7. 39. Deuteronomy. 7. 3.

2. Both parties must separate themselves at the times of a Woman's disease, and
at the times of fastings, Ezekiel 18. 6. 1 Cor. 7. 5.

and concupiscence of the flesh; and mainly, and chiefly for the enlarging of
Gods Church by an holy seed, Romans 13. 14.

4. It must be used with prayer and thanksgiving, 1 Timothy 4. 3, 4.

The Negative part. The Negative part.


Here is forbidden the lust of the heart, or the evil concupiscence of the
flesh, Matthew. 5. 28. Colos. 3. 5.

Burning in the flesh, that is, an inward servency of lust, whereby the Godly
motions of the heart are hindered, overwhelmed, and as it were burnt up with a
strange and contrary fire, 1 Cor. 7. 9.

All strange pleasures about generation, which are forbidden in Gods word.

All pleasure with beasts, Levit. 18. 23.

All pleasure with Devils, such as Witches by their own confession say that
they have; And why may not a Spirit have society with a Witch, as well as eat
meat?

All pleasure of lasciviousness with one of the same kind, or Sex, Levit. 18.
22. This is a sin which they commit, whom God has given over unto a reprobate
sense, Romans 1. 26, 27. This was the sin of Sodom, and from its being so
commonly used there, it was called Sodomy.

All carnal pleasure with those that be within the degrees of consanguinity, or
affinity, are here forbidden, Levit. 18. 6.

All Fornication, Fornication what it is.
that is, the lying carnally with a maid that is not his wife, that lies with
her, Deuteronomy. 22. 28, 29. 1 Cor. 10. 8. For this sin with the Idolatrous Moabitish
women, there were in one day of the Israelites with a plague twenty three
thousand men slain.

All Adultery, Adultery what it is.
that is, all carnal pleasure with one that is married, or betrothed, Deuteronomy.
22. 22. to the 24.

Adultery is a marveilous great sin, as may appear in that it was punished with
the punishment of Idolatry, Romans 1. 23. Prove. 6. 29, 32.

Adulterers break Gods Covenant of marriage, Prove. 2. 16. 17.

Adulterers abuse their own bodies, and dishonest them, 1 Cor. 6. 18.

They do bereave their Neighbors of a great, and irrecoverable benefit, namely
of chastity.

By the Law of God, the Children of Adulterers were excluded the Congregation
of the Lord, till their tenth Generation, Deuteronomy. 23. 2.

The Adulterer makes his family a stews.

David's Adultery was punished in Absoloms abuse of his Concubines, 2 Samuel 16. 21.

A man's posterity feels the smart of the sin of Adultery, this is a fire
which shall devour to destruction, and which shall root out all mine increase,
Job 31. 11, 12.

Though Adultery be never so secretly committed, yet God will reveal it, Numb.
5. 12, 23.

Adultery has usually acompanying it a dullness of heart, or a marveilous
horror of conscience, whoredom and wine take away the heart, Hos. 4. 11.

The Patriarchs Poligamy cannot be defended, but it may 1. be excused, because
it served for the increase of mankind, when as yet, there were but few upon
the earth: and 2. Because it served for the propagation of Gods Church.

Here also men are forbidden to abuse their liberty, as by knowing their wives
in the time of their flowers, Ezekiel. 22 10. Levit. 18. 19. and Ezekiel. 18. 6.

Here are also forbidden unchaste thoughts.

Effeminate wantonness, and seeking of occasions to stir up lust, Gal. 5. 19.

Occasions of lust are these: Occasions of lust, what they are.

lascivious objects, 2 Pet. 2. 14.

2. Idleness, 2 Samuel 1 1. 2, 3.

3. Riotous, and lascivious attire, 1 Timothy 2. 9. Isai 3. 16, 23.

Riotous, and lascivious apparel, or Attire is a lavish and Prodigal wasting of
Gods benefits, that might be employed upon better uses. It is a Testimony and
ensign of pride, by which a man would have himself better esteemed than others.
It is a note of great idleness and slouthfulness, those that use it cannot
endure to take pains, and neglect other business; It is a sign of Levity, and
puts men upon the invention of new fashions, and upon the imitation of them. It
makes a confusion among degrees, and callings of men, so that the one can not
be known from the other.

Here also we are forbidden an immoderate, or insatiable fullness of bread, or
of meat, for they provoke lust in such immoderation, Ezekiel. 16. 49. Luke 16. 19.
Romans 13. 13.

And corrupt, and dishonest, and unseemly talk, I Cor. 15. 33.

5. 13.

In the use of the things of this World is required contentation, and
thriftiness amongst all men; And a common enjoyment of all worldly things
amongst the faithful, and true believers, as Act. 2. 45.

Contentation in every man is a virtue, Contentation.
whereby he is well pleased with that estate wherein he is placed, 1 Timothy 6. 6,
7. Phil. 4. 11. Heb. 13. 5.

Thriftiness, Thriftiness.
or frugality is a virtue, whereby a man does cheerfully, and without
prodigality and profuseness, and riotousness use, and employ temporal, and
worldly blessings freely, both for his own refreshing and commodity; and
likewise to the refreshing, and commodity of others, Prove. 5. 15, 16. Joh. 6.

simplicity in all our ways; Psalm. 15. 2. Genes. 23. 15, 18.

And to deal justly with all men, ^ These. 4. 6.

Those that buy, or sell, or let, or hire Farms, Tenements, or Lands, or that
use merchandise, must not rack, but must keep a just, and true price.

1. Such as these must keep an equality, and a proportion in all contracts; and
in the valuing of things, they must not only consider their own pains, but the
buyers profit also; Levit. 25. 14. to 16.

They must square their dealings according to the Law of Nature, as Christ
teaches; Matthew. 7. 12.

Those that are enriched by the lawful gain of another man's goods have a
natural tie, or Obligation upon them, to make recompense in some proportion
above the principal.

For Nature commands to do good for good.

Goods, or temporal things ought to be employed for the good of others; 2 Cor.
8 13.

In sale, wholesome things, substanstial things, and things fit for use are to
be sold.

Here are commanded just weights, and just measures; Deuteronomy. 25. 13. Ezekiel 45. 16.
Mich 6. 11.

He that hireth must not only pay the appointed hire, but also make good that

but not to make himself a surerety for any; Deuteronomy. 15. 7, 8. Prove. 11. 15. and
17. 18. and 22. 26. and 6. 1. to the 5.

Just Covenants and promises, Just Covenants must be performed.
though they be to our hinderance, must be performed; all promises bind, if
they be lawful, so far forth as he will, to whom we make the promise; Psalm.

He that lends must do it freely, and cheerfully; (...) 5.

He that borrows (...) be careful to make restitution, if need be, with the
sale of his goods, 2 Kings 4. 2. to the 7.

Here we are commanded to restore that, which is committed to our custody,
without delay; Matthew. 21. 41.

But if the thing committed to our custody be not lost by any default of ours,
we are not to be urged to repay it, nor is there any binding of us at all to
repay, Exodus 22. 7. 8.

That which a man finds he may keep in his own hands, if the true owner
cannot be heard of: but if he be, he must restore it, Deuteronomy. 22. 1, 2, 3.

In all injuries done unto men, they must ever have respect to the law of
charity, and not so much endeavor to maintain their own right, as to recall an
erring brother into the right way; Matthew. 5. 39. 40. Jam. 5. 20.

The Negative part of this Commandment The Negative part.
is this.

Here we are forbidden stealing.

To steal is to conveigh any thing from another closely, unawares, or by fraud;
Genes. 31. 20.

Here is also forbidden inordinate living, or idle living; 2 These. 3. 11. Gen
3. 19. 1 Timothy 5. 8.

And unjust dealing, either in heart, or deed.

Unjust dealing in heart is covetousness; Of unjust dealing in heart.
Matthew. 15. 19.

Covetousness is Idolatry, Ephesians. 5. 5.

It is the root of all evil, and that which nourishes all kind of sin, 1 Timothy
6. 10.

Unjust dealing indeed, is either in bargaining, or out of bargaining.

1. Unjust dealing in bargaining, Of unjust dealing in deed.
is to sell that which is not saleable, 1 These. 4. 6. as what ever is
unprofitable, or pernicious, either to the Church, or Commonwealth.

Or to think to buy the gift of the holy Ghost for money, Act. 8. 18. to the 20.

2. It is unjust dealing in bargaining, to use colored forgery.

As forged cavillation, Luke 19. 8.

Or to sell that which is counterfeit for good, as Copper for Gold, or to

Or to falsify measures, and weights, Deuteronomy. 25. 13. Levit. 19. 35 Amos 8. 4.

purse a penny, without giving a penny worth, Matthew. 7. 12.

Or by sale upon a set day, which is, when a day is given that the price may be
inhanced, for this is to sell time, and to take more of a man's Neighbor than
is right.

Or by engrossing, which is, when a man buyeth all commodities into his own
hands, that he may sell it at his own price, when as no man has any of it but
himself.

Or by breaking, or becoming bankrupt, that thou may enrich thy self by the
damages, and goods of others.

It is unlawful also to oppress, by not restoring that which was lent,
pledged, or pawned; Or that which is found, if the owner can be heard of; Ezekiel.
18. 7.

Or to oppress by delaying any kind of restitution from one day to another;
Prove. 3. 28. Ps. 37. 21. Deuteronomy. 24. 14, 15. Levit. 19. 13.

Or to oppress by practicing usury; Oppression by usury.
Exodus 22. 25. Deuteronomy. 23. 19. Levit. 25. 36.

Usury is again exacted by Covenant above the principal, only in Lieu and
recompense of the lending of it; Usury is quite contrary to Gods word; Exodus 22
14, 15. Ezekiel. 18. 8. Psalm. 15. 2 Cor. 8. 13. This usury is altogether
unlawful, and disallowed.

Cautions in Lawful Use. Cautions in use, if it be at all lawful.


1. A man must exact nothing, but that which his debtor can get by good and
lawful means.

2. A man must not take more than the gain; nay, not all the gain, nor that

3. Sometimes a man that lends must neither take gain nor principal, as when
his debtour is by just and inevitable casualties brought behind hand, Deuteronomy. 5.
2. And when it is apparent that he could not make any advantage of the money
borrowed.

Here we are also forbidden to oppress, by detaining the Laborers wages; Deuteronomy.
23. 14. Jam. 5. 4.

Unjust dealing out of bargaining is to pronounce false sentence for a reward,
either proffered, or promised. This is a grievous sin, which Lawyers and Judges
must beware of; Isai 1. 23.

It is also unjust dealing out of bargaining to feed men that are stout, and
lusty, and are offered employment, and yet will take no pains at all, 2 These.
3. 10.

Socrates, In the Tripatite History, says, that the Monk which labors not
with his hands, is no better than a Thief.

It is also unjust dealing out of bargaining not to employ him, who is knowing
and able for employments, and desires to be employed; yea, and also not to
further and assist those who do employ themselves in employments lawful, and
warrantable by the word of God, that so they may improve their labors and
endeavors both for public good, and also for their own particular good, and
for the glory of God.

We must not be too credulous, for then we shall often be over taken with the
belief of lies, Joh. 2. 24.

For this cause we must be ware of evil reports that run abroad amongst people
by whisperers, and tale-bearers, Ps. 15. 3. Jer. 40. 14, 16.

It is good for a man to show himself angry, and displeased, with such
flattering tongues, and whisperers, Prove. 25. 23.

Here we are commanded to conceal, and keep secret, our Neighbors offenses of
weakness, and imperfection, Prove. 10. 12. Matthew. 18. 15.

And knowing them we must admonish him, that we may mend him, Gal. 6. 1. Jam.
5. 19. 21.

If concealing of his sin, and admonition will not move him to forsake his sin,
then, out of love, and charity to him, we must declare it to those that may
remove, and amend the same, Genesis 37. 2. 1 Cor. 1 11. Matthew 18. 16.

By Godliness we must seek to get a good name, It is lawful to labor for a
good name by Godliness.
and when we have so gotten it, we must likewise by Godliness strive to
maintain it, Prove. 221. Eccles. 7. 1. Phil. 4. 8.

A good name is to be labored for thus:

1. By seeking the Kingdom of God before all things, by repenting of sin, and
earnestly desiring to follow after, and to embrace righteousness. This is the
right way to seek the Kingdom of heaven, Prove 10. 7. Mark. 14. 9.

2. By having a care to judge, and speak well of others, Matt. 7. 2. Eccles. 7.
23. 24.

3. By abstaining from all kind of vice, and wickedness; for evil men will
make use of one vice of a man to obscure his good name upon all occasions,
Eccles. 10. 1. Yea, and they will openly, and secretly labor to bring him into
sin, that they may have occasion of doing this.

4. By seeking only the glory of God in all things, and not our own glory,
Matthew. 6. 5, 6. Joh. 17. 18.

When we thus seek the glory of God, and have the praise of good men for the
doing of it, we must not despise, nor contemn their Testimony, and
commendation.

And if we thus seek the glory of God, and they praise us not, nor commend us,
yet we must take this in good part, and rejoice that God is glorified; For, to
him (...) indeed does belong all the praise, and glory of all our actions, 2
Cor. ^. 12. and 10. 13. 1 Cor. 1. 31. Psalm 16. 5. 6.

The Negative part of this Commandment is this. Negative part.


Here we are forbidden envy, disdain of others, or desire of a man's own glory,
Deutr. 19. 17. 1 Pet. 2. 1. Matthew. 12. 15.

And evil suspicions, 1 Samuel 17. 28. Act. 28. 4.

And hard censures, and sinister judgment against our Neighbor, Matthew. 7. 1,
2.

We must not interpret indifferent things in the worst part.

We must not out of evil will make a small offense great.

In judging others we may use three ways, How we may judge others.
and not sin

1. By the word of God when we see a sin, we may judge it sin, and reprove it.

2. The Magistrate may judge.

3. A friend may judge and admonish, by wishing to abstain from evil company,
and by giving warning to beware of sin, iniquity, and vice.

Here we are forbidden to give the bare words spoken for the full intention of
our Neighbor, when as we neither know the sense of them, nor the meaning of
our Neighbor, Matt. 26. 59. to the 61. Joh. 2. 19.

And to ly.

And unjust sentence in judgment.

An to suborn, or rest in a witness to accuse another wrongfully.

And to betray a man's cause by collusion, or winking at it, 1 Kings 21. 12.
Deuteronomy. 17. 6.

And openly to raise hurtful, tales, and reports of our Neighbor, or privily
to devise the same, Levit. 19. 16. 1 Timothy 5. 13.

And to spread abroad flying tales, or to feign and add any thing to them,
Prove. 26. 20, 22.

And to believe the reports of others, Exodus 23. 1. 1 Samuel 24. 10

And to accuse a man out of malice to his enemy, as Doeg did Abimelech, and
David to Saul, Ps. 52. 1, 2, 3, 4. 1 Samuel 22. 9.

And to declare the secrets of our Neighbor, or his sins of infirmity, Prove.
11. 13. Matthew. 18. 15.

And all babbling talk, and bitter words, Ephesians. 5. 3, 4. Joh. 9. 34.

And jestings, and all scurrility:

And that -- -- -- For these causes.

1. Because quips, or jests are like the stings of Scorpions, Serpents, and
Locusts; For by this means the Devil stingeth those that are jested upon,
girding them with these offenses; and netleth, or tickleth those with pleasure,
which take delight in the hearing of them; And this is his way by which he does
charm, and insensibly sting them also, even as he does the other to their
trouble.

2. Because a Christians Godliness and Gravity can not stand, or agree with
such behavior.

And if any object here, that Salt and Tart speeches have been used in
Scripture, Objection*
as when Eliah mocked the Priests of Baal, 1 Kings 18. 27. And when Isaiah mocked
the King of Babylon, Isai. 14. 4, 9.

Yet such must be thus answered, that these speeches were not to please any
withal. But they were reproofs sharply denounced against Gods enemies for his
glory.

Here we are forbidden flattery, that is, to praise our Neighbor above that we
know in him, Prove. 27. 6, 14. Act. 12. 22. --

-- This is a grievous sin in Ministers, 1 Thessalonians. 2. 5. Jer. 6. 13, 14. Romans
16. 18.

Here we are forbidden foolish over-confident boasting, Pro. 27. 1.

And to accuse, or witness against any falsely, 1 Kings 21. 13. Deutr. 19. 17.

The tenth Commandment. Tenth Commandment.

Thou shall not covet thy Neighbors house, thou shall not covet thy Neighbors
wife, nor his man servant, nor his maid servant, nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor
any thing that is thy Neighbors.

The Affirmative part of this Commandment is this. Affirmative part.


We are commanded here to labor, to keep our hearts pure toward our
Neighbor, 1 Timothy 1. 5.

And to endeavor that the cogitations, thoughts, and motions of our hearts may
be holy, and our spirits free from such vanity. To this purpose was Paul's
prayer for the Thessaloniaus, 1 These. 5. 23. Ephesians. 4. 23.

And to fight against the evil affections, and lusts of the flesh, Romans 7. 12,
24. 2 Cor. 12. 7. to the 9.

Cogitations, thoughts, or motions of the heart are of three kinds.

1. A glancing, or sudden thought suggested to the mind by Satan, The kinds
of the motions, or thoughts of the heart.
This does suddenly vanish away, and is not received of the mind; This is no
sin, It was in Christ himself, when as he was tempted by the Devil, Matthew. 4.
1, 3.

2 A more remaining, and abiding thought, or motion, which does as it were
tickle, and mingle the mind with some inward joy.

A thought, or motion, which draws from the will and affection a full assent
to sin.

To covet is to think inwardly, and to desire any thing, whereby our Neighbor
may be hindered, although there does ensue no assent of the will to commit that
evil.

There is a concupiscence, or coveting which is evil, as when any man does
desire that which is another, with his loss, damage, and injury.

And there is a concupiscence, or a coveting, or a desire which is good, as
when a man does desire meat and drink for the body. And the desire of the
spirit when it lusts, fights, striveth, and strugleth against the flesh,
Gal. 5. 17.

The Negative part of this Commandment is this. The Negative part.


Here is forbidden concupiscence it self, that is, original corruption, because
it is hurtful to our Neighbor, Jam. 1. 14.

And all sudden corrupt cogitations of the heart, which spring out of the
bitter root of concupiscence, Gal. 5 17. Luke 10. 27.

And all suggestions of Satan, which after the first offer are entertained,
and received into the closet of the heart.

And the entertaining of all tickling cogitations, and motions of the heart
that do thus delight it, as to say with prejudice to any, I would such a house
was mine, or such a living, or such a thing.

And all unchaste dreams, which do arise from the force of concupiscence, or
from the strength of any lustful desires, which man does suffer his heart to
be possessed withal

The use of the Law is this* Uses of the Law.


1. In un-regenerate men it lays sin open, and makes it known to them, Romans
3. 20.

2. In unregenerate men it does increase sin, and that because of the flesh,
and this is the cause that men do decline from the Commandment, and incline to
that which is forbidden them, Rom 7. 8, 9, 10.

3. It is to denounce eternal damnation for the least disobedience, without
offering any hope of pardon.

This sentence the Law does pronounce against offenders; and by it, it does
reign and rule over a man, partly by threatening him, and partly by terrifying
him, Romans 3. 19. Gal. 3. 10. 2 Cor. 3. 7, 8.

The end of the reigning of sin in men, is to urge sinners to fly unto Christ,
Romans 11. 32. Gal. 3. 22. 24.

The continuance of the power of the Law is for ever, unless a sinner does
repent.

The very first act of repentance does so free a sinner; as that, immediately
upon it, he is no more under the Law, but under grace, as we may see by David,
1 Samuel 12. 13. Romans 6. 14.

If we mean to have eternal life, we must examine the course of our lives by the
square of Gods Law; we must set the course due unto our sins before our eyes,
and bewail our miseries, and have a holy despair of our own powers, and
renounce our selves, and sue unto Christ Jesus.

This is the use of the Law, in unregenerate men and women.

The use of the Law in regenerate men, is, --

-- To guide them to new obedience in the whole course of their lives, and this
new obedience is acceptable to God through Christ; Romans 3. 31. Psalm. 119. 24.
105.

Of the Covenant of Grace.
The Covenant of grace is Gods free promise of Christ, The Covenant of Grace.
and his benefits to every repentant sinner, that will receive him by Faith,
Hosea 2. 18, 19, 20. Ezekiel. 33. 11. to the 15. and 36. 25. to the 27. Malach. 3.
1.

This Covenant is called a Testament, because it is confirmed by the death of
the Testatour; Heb. 9. 16, 17.

This Covenant is like a man's last Will and Testament, it is not for the
profit of the Testatour, but for the benefit of the Heir; we do here receive
from God, and not promise, or offer unto God.

In substance the Old and New Testament is the same.

The old Covenant, or Testament prefigured Christ in Types, and shaddows, who
was then to come.

The New Testament declares Christ, already come in the flesh, and shows him
apparently in the Gospel.

The Gospel is that part of God's word, which contains the welcome message of
Christ, and of the benefits that do come to mankind by him; Joh. 3. 14. Act.
10. 43.

The Gospel does manifest that righteousness in Christ, by which the whole Law
is fully satisfied, and salvation attained, Romans 1. 16. 17.

The Gospel is that instrument, or Conduit-pipe, by which the holy Ghost does
convey Faith into the Soul; 1 Cor. 1. 21. Act. 11. 19. to the 21. Joh. 4. 28.
to the 42.

And Faith is the hand by which we do apprehend Christ and his righteousness;
Joh. 6. 63.

The Sacraments are appendants to the word. Of the Sacraments.


A Sacrament is that, whereby Christ and his saving graces are signified,
exhibited, and sealed to a Christian by certain external rites; Genes. 17. 11.
Romans 4. 11.

The parts of a Sacrament are the sign, and the thing signified.

The sign is the visible, and sensible matter.

The thing signified is Christ.

The matter, or signs of the Sacrament have no inherent force, or efficacy at
all in them to make any that receives them holy; this is the alone work of the
holy spirit, which indeed does ever accompany the signs when at any time they
are received by faithful, and believing Souls.

So that the sign does only signify grace, either already received, or to be
received, and does not give it.

The thing signified is, 1. Christ, 2. His Graces.

The action about Christ is spiritual, and it is, 1. Either of God, or 2. Of
Faith.

The action of God is the offering, and application of Christ, and his graces
to the Faithful.

The action of Faith is the consideration, M. P. p. 73
desire, apprehension, or receiving of Christ in the Lawful use of the
Sacrament.

By a figure called a Metonymie, one thing is put for another in the Sacrament:

As the sign for the thing signified, Joh. 6. 51. 1 Cor. 5. 7. and 10. ^7.

And the name of the thing signified, is given to the sign, 1 Cor. 11. 24.
Matt. 26. 28. Exodus 12. 11.

And the effect of the thing signified is given to the sign, as circumcision is
a Covenant, Genes. 17. 10. Act. 7. 8. Luke 22. 20. Tit. 3. 5.

And that which is proper to the sign, is attributed to the thing signified;
Deuteronomy. 10. 16. Joh. 6. 53.

The ends of the Sacrament are The ends of the Sacraments.


1. To confirm our Faith. 2. To be a badge, or note to distinguish the true
Church of God from other Congregations. 3. It is a means to spread abroad the
Doctrine of the Gospel. 4. It does bind the faithful to continue Loyal, and
grateful to their Lord God. 5. It is a bond of mutual amity betwixt the
faithful.
The Covenant of Grace is absolutely necessary to salvation; for a man must be
within the Covenant, and receive Christ the substance thereof, or he cannot be
saved.

But a Sacrament is not absolutely necessary to salvation; for it is only a
stay for Faith to lean on, whilst that it does assure to us that which God
has bestowed on us.

The want of the Sacrament condemns not, M. P. p. 72
but the contempt of it does. For in the ( i. e.) Though a man has never used
the Sacraments.
neglect of a Sacrament, true repentance will obtain pardon of God. M. P. 72.

Unbelievers receive only the sign, and not the thing signified, and therefore
it does not profit them; Romans 2. 25.

Only true believers do receive the Sacraments with profit.

Sacraments and Sacrifices do thus differ. Sacraments and Sacrifices how they
differ.


In a Sacrament God does bestow his Graces on us.

In a Sacrifice we return thanksgiving, Faith, and obedience unto God.

The Sacraments of the two Testaments thus differ.

The Sacraments of the Old Testament were many.

But the Sacraments of the New Testament are but few.

These pointed at Christ to come.

These show him to be come.

They belonged properly to the posterity of Abraham.

These are common to all the Church, called out of the Jews and Gentiles.

The Sacraments are two, The Sacraments are two Baptism.
Baptism and the supper of the Lord.

The Fathers had these Sacraments, the first of the Corinth. 10. 1. to the 4.

Baptism belongs to all the faithful, even to all the promised seed.

It belongs to infants whose parents are believing, or which have but one
believing parent; 1 Cor. 7. 14. Romans 11. 16. Genes. 17. 7, 13. Act. 16. 31.

It belongs to all, even young and old that believe; Act. 8. 36, 37, 38.
Matthew. 3. 6. Exodus 12. 48.

Baptism signifies our regeneration by the holy spirit; Titus* 3. 5.

And assures, or seals to us our engraffing, and incorporating into Christ;
Gal. 3* 27. 1 Cor. 12. 13.

The parts of Baptism, or of washing, The parts of Baptism.
are three.

1. A putting into the water, to signify that all our sins are washed away by
the blood of Christ, and that his righteousness is imputed to us; Act. 22. 16.
1 Cor. 6. 11.

It does also signify the mortification of sin, by the power of Christ's death;
Romans 6. 3, 6, 7.

2. Continuance in the water, which signifies to us the burial of our sins,
and a continual increase of mortification in us by the power of Christ's death,
and burial, Romans 6. 4.

3. A coming out of the water, which signifies unto us our regeneration, or
spiritual vivification, or a newness of life, or quickening in holiness and
justice, which we do obtain by the power of Christ's resurrection; Romans 6. 4, 5.

The once administering of Baptism is a sign of the washing away of all sins,
both past, present, and to come, 1 Pet. 3. 21.

And this may be a good encouragement to all those that through infirmity fall
into sin.

The Lord's supper is a Sacrament, The Lords supper.
by which, in the signs of bread and wine, is signified the nourishment of our
Souls through Christ, by the holy spirit; 1 Cor. 11. 23. to the 25.

The receiving of the bread, and wine, signifies the receiving of Christ, Joh.
1. 12.

The eating of the bread, and drinking of the wine, signifies the applying of
Christ to our selves by Faith, that so we may find our Communion with him
daily increased, and perceive our Union with him; 1 Cor. 10. 16.

The whole Scope and intention of the Lord's supper, as it was instituted by
our Lord, was for no other end, but to be a remembrance of him; 1 Cor. 11. 24.
Luke 22. 19.

Men must not, because of infirmities abstain from the Lord's supper, but they
must use it to confirm them, and to strengthen them.

So much for the outward means, whereby the decree of Gods election is executed.

The degrees of the execution are two. The degrees of the execution of Election.


1. The love of God, whereby he does freely love us in Christ Jesus, who in our
selves are corrupt; 1 John 4. 19. Romans 5. 8, 10.

2. The Declaration of God's love.

God does declare his love, either in a secret way by his holy spirit, as to
infants; 1 Cor. 12. 13. Luke 1. 35. to the 80. Jer. 1. 5.

Or to men of ripe years, and that more manifestly; as Romans 8. 30. 1 Cor. 1. 30.

As first, 1. The first degree of the Declaration of God's love is effectual
calling.
By an effectual calling, in which God separateth a man from the World, and
does entertain him into his own family, Ephesians. 2. 17, 19.

And for this cause it is, that the World do hate the faithful; Joh. 15. 19.

In this calling God does give us to Christ; Ephesians. 5. 21. 33. Joh 17. 2, 6, 7.
and 10. 29. Isai 9* 6. Romans 8. 32.

And hence arises the admirable Union betwixt Christ and his Members, which is
the engraffing of a man into him; Joh. 15. 1, 2. and 17. 20, 21. Ephesians. 2. 20,
21, 22. and 5. 30.

This Union, or Communion, Conjunction, or engraffing, is wrought by the
operation of the spirit, which is an infinite essence, and therefore
sufficiently able to conjoyn those things which of themselves are far distant,
even as the Soul of a man joyneth all his Members together, and does cause them
all to grow and move, and live together; Ephesians* 2* 22. 2* Pet. 1. 4. Phil. 2. 1.

By this Union it is, that we are said to be Crucified with Christ, to die with
him, to be buried with him, and to be quickened, raised and placed in heaven
with him; Romans 6. 4, 6. Ephesians. 2. 1, 5.

And by this Union, as we all are said to sin in Adam, so we may be all said in
Christ to fulfill the whole Law of God.

Of the Members of Christ.
The Members of Christ are either Members outwardly, The Members Christ.
and before men, which are only out of charity so called, as externally
professing the Faith.

Or Members in the sight of God.

Which are, 1. Either decreed so to be, as being elect from all eternity,
though not yet born, or not yet called, Joh. 10. 16.

Or 2. Actually so already, and these are first either actual living Members,
as being engraffed through Faith by the holy Spirit into Christ, and therefore
grow in the power of holiness, Or 2. Actual dying Members, or decaying Members,
that is, such as have not the feeling of the power of the quickening spirit in
them, though they be truly engraffed into Christ, of this sort are all those
that are yet dead in their sins, till such time as they be again quickened, and
regenerated.

God does execute effectual calling by these means. Effectual calling the means
of its execution.


1. By the preaching of the word, and by hearing of it, Ezekiel. 16. 6. Isai 55.
1. Joh. 1. 12.

By the Law God does show a man his sin, and the punishment thereof, Romans 7. 7.

By the Gospel God does show salvation through Christ, to such as do believe.

And whilst the word is preaching, God does inwardly enlighten the eyes of the
mind, and open the heart, and the ears, that the word heard, may be truly
understood, 1 John 2. 27. Act. 16. 14. Psalm. 40. 6. Joh. 6. 44. Isai 54. 6.

2. By mollifying the heart, and making it fit to receive his saving grace into
it, when he offers it, Ezekiel. 11. 19.

The hammers by which a stony The hammers by which a stony heart is bruised.
heart is bruised, and broken, are these.

1. The knowledge of the Law of God.

2. The knowledge of sin Original and Actual, and of the punishment due unto
them.

3. Compunction, or a pricking of heart, that is, a sense, or feeling of the
wrath of God for sin, Act. 2. 37.

4. An holy desperation of our own power in the obtaining of life, Luke 15. 17,
18, 19. Mark. 15. 24.

Thirdly, effectual calling is executed:

By Faith receiving Christ, and by the operation of the holy spirit in applying
him, Joh 1. 12. 6. 35. Romans 6. 38. 1 Cor. 2 12. Zach. 12. 10. Romans 8. 16. Ephesians.
1. 13. 2 Cor. 1. 22.

In the work of Faith there are five motions of the heart linked. The five
motions in the heart upon the work of Faith.


1. Knowledge of the Gospel by the illumination of Gods spirit, Isai 53. 11.
Joh. 17. 3.

To this knowledge in those that are truly humbled is joined a serious
meditation of the promises in the Gospel. --

-- Which Meditation is stirred up by a sensible feeling of their own beggary.

And after this knowledge there does arise a general Faith in all such as are
enlightened, whereby they subscribe to the truth of the Gospel, Heb. 4. 2. 1 Timothy 1. 19. and 2. 4.

Which knowledge, so soon as it is full and perfect, it is called (...), that
is the full assurance of understanding, Col. 2. 2. Romans 14. 14. Luke 1. 1. 1
These. 1. 5.

2. Hope of pardon, by which a sinner believes that his sins are pardonable,
though he does not yet feel them certainly pardoned, Luke 15. 18.

3. Hungring and thirsting after grace, which is offered to us in Christ Jesus,
Joh. 6. 35. and 7. 37. Revel. 21. 6. Matthew. 5. 6.

4. An approaching with boldness to the Throne of Grace, that so we flying from
the terror of the Law, may take hold on Christ, and find favor with God,
Heb. 4. 16.

This approaching of the Throne of Grace is done, 1. by an humble confession of
our sins in the presence of God, as did David, Psalm. 32. 5. 2 Samuel 12. 13. Luke
15. 19.

2. By a craving earnestly to God for pardon of our sins, and by perseverance
in fervent prayer for the same purpose, Luke 15. 21. Act. 8. 22. Romans 8. 26.
Hosea 14. 2, 3.

3. An especial persuasion imprinted in the heart by the holy Ghost, by which
every faithful man does apply all the promises of the Gospel to himself,
Matthew. 9. 2* and 15. 28. Gal. 2. 20.

This persuasion is, and ought to be in every one, before he have any
experience of Gods mercy, Matthew. 15. 22, 27. Joh. 20. 29. Heb. 11. 1.

In natural Philosophy we do first see things true by experience, and
afterward assent unto them; Thus we are persuaded that water is hot, because
we perceive the heat by putting our hand into it.

But in the practice of Faith, we must first steadfastly believe, and then the
experience and feeling of comfort will follow, 2 Chr. 20. 20.

It is therefore very ill done of any, that they should doubt of their
salvation, because they do not always feel the especial motions of Gods holy
spirit in themselves.

The lowest degree of Faith is (...), that is, a weak Faith, or a little Faith,
like to a grain of Mustard Seed, or to smoking flax, which cannot flame nor
give out heat, but only smoke, Matthew. 8. 25. 26 and 7. 20. Isai. 3. 4 2.

Faith may be then said to be feeble, when either the first of the five
motions, or the last of them is weak and feeble; yea, though the other three
motions do remain strong, Romans 14. 2. 3.

Rules to know this kind of Faith by, are these. Rules to know true Faith.


1. A serious desire to believe, and endeavor to obtain Gods favor, is the
seed of this Faith, Matthew. 5. 6. Rev 21. 6. Psalm. 145. 19.

2. An earnest use of means to increase the least spark of Faith, that so it
may get growth by little, and little, Luke 17. 5, 6.

Faith is stirred up by earnest prayer, and meditation, and by making progress,
and going on in the ways of perfection, and in the exercise of godliness.

The highest degree of Faith, is called (...), or full assurance, by this a man
does find in himself a certain persuasion and assurance, that God does love
him, and will together with Christ, and all his graces give him eternal life,
Romans 4. 20. and 8. 38. 1 Samuel 17. 36. Ps. 23. 6.

A man does not come to high degree of Faith, till after a sense, and long
experience of Gods love, and favor.

2. The second degree of the Declaration of Gods love.
The second degree of the Declaration of Gods love is justification.

By this, through the obedience of Christ, true believers are accounted just in
the presence of God, 2 Cor. 5. 21. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Romans 5 19.

The parts of justification are, 1. Remission of sins, with a freeing from the
guilt, and punishment of them, and that through the satisfaction made to God
for them by Christ, Collos. 1. 21, 22. 1 Pet. 2. 24.

2. Imputation of Christ's righteousness, by this, those that believe have the
guilt of their sins covered, and are accounted just in the sight of God, Phil.
3. 8, 9. Romans 4, 3, 4, 5, 6.

The obedience of Christ is called the righteousness of God, and of Christ, of
God, because it is of God.

Of Christ, because it is out of us, and in the humanity of Christ, as in a
subject.

To justification is joined Adoption.

By Adoption we do receive power, to be actually accounted the Sons of God by
Christ, Ephesians. 1. 5.

Privileges that come unto us by Adoption are these. Privileges by Adoption.


1. By it we are made Heirs apparent to God, Romans 8. 17.

2. Fellow Heirs with Christ; yea, Kings and Priests, Romans 8. 17. Revel. 1. 6.

3. By it all our afflictions; yea, even our wants and offenses are turned to
trials, or fatherly chastisements inflicted upon us for our good, Romans 8. 28,
36, 37. Psalm. 89. 32, 33. 2 Cor. 12. 7. 2 Samuel 7. 14.

4. By it we have dominion over all the Creatures; yet, so as that in this life
we have only right to the thing, but after this life we shall have right in
the same, 1 Cor. 3. 22, 23. Heb. 2. 7, 8.

5. By it we have the Angels Ministering spirits for our good, Heb. 1. 14. Psalm.
34. 7.

The faithful alone have the true use of Creatures.

1. Because their persons are made acceptable unto God in Christ, and in him
they have restitution made them of the right use of Creatures, which was lost
in Adam, so that they may use them freely, and with a good conscience.

The third degree of the Declaration of Gods love is sanctification. The third
degree of the Declaration of Gods love.


By it we are delivered from the Tyranny of sin, and by little and little
renewed in holiness, and righteousness, 1 John 3. 9. Romans 8. 1.

The parts of sanctification are first mortification.

By this the power of sin is abated, and sin is killed in the faithful, Romans
6. 2, 3. 4. Gal. 5. 24. Mortification is wrought in us by the power of the holy
Spirit, abolishing sin in us, and regenerating, or renewing our spirits.

2. Vivification.

By this inherent holiness is begun in us, and by little and little augmented,
and enlarged by the power of the holy spirit.

For first we do receive the first fruits of the spirit, and then by degrees we
have a continual increase of them, Ephesians. 2. 21. and 4* 23, 24. Gal. 2. 20. Romans
8. 23.

Vivification is a benefit that springs unto us by the resurrection of
Christ, and is wrought in us by the holy spirit, Phil. 3. 10. It is this that
creates holiness in the heart of the adopted ones of God, Romans 8. 9, 11. Job
33. 24, 25.

Inherent holiness is distinguished according to the several faculties of the
body, and Soul of man, 1 These. 5. 23.

The parts of inherent holiness are these. The parts of Inherent holiness.


1. An illumination of the mind to know, and understand the will of God; which
illumination is both the holiness of the mind, and the renewing of it, Colos
1. 9. 1 Cor. 12. 8.

Illumination of the mind is, Illumination.


1. Either spiritual understanding, by which it acknowledges the known truth
of the word of God, 2. Or spiritual wisdom, by which the same truth is applied
to the good ordering, both of particular things, and of particular actions, as
persons, place, and time require.
The effects of spiritual understanding, and of spiritual wisdom are these.

1. To discern betwixt good and evil, Heb. 5. 14. Phil. 1. 10.

2. To discern spirits, 1 John 4. 1. 1 These. 5. 21. Act. 17. 11.

3. To meditate upon the words, and works of God, Ps. 1. 1. and 119. 33.

4. To know, and acknowledge a man's own inward blindness, Psalm. 119. 18, 33.

2. 2. Part of inherent holiness, is sanctification of memory.
A sanctification of the memory, by which it is enabled to receive a good thing
offered to the mind, and to keep it; and remember it as there is need, Psalm.
16. 7. 119. 11. Luke 2. 51.

3. 3 Part. Sanctification of conscience.
Sanctification of conscience, This is a grace of God, by which a man's
conscience excuses him for all sins, after they are once pardoned in Christ,
and also of his upright walking in the whole course of his life, 1 Timothy 1. 19.
1 Cor. 4. 4. Act. 23. 1. and 24. 16. Ps. 26. 1, 2, 3. 1 John 3. 21.

The inward peace of God does arise from this sanctity of conscience in all
godly men; yea, and the outward alacrity and cheerfulness of countenance also,
Phil. 4. 7. Prove. 28. 1. Job 33. 24, 25.

4. Sanctification of will, 4. Part. Sanctificaton of will.
by which through the renewing of the affections by the holy Spirit, a man does
begin to will that which is good, and to refuse evil.

This is such a state, as that the will is partly freed from bondage, and
partly in bondage to sin, Phil. 2. 13. Romans 7. 18. to the 22.

5. Sanctification of affections, 5. Part. Sanctification of affections.
by this, in the power of the holy Spirit the affections move well, and
rightly, 1 These. 5. 23. Romans 7. 24.

The chief affections are these. The chief affections.


1. Hope, by this, with sighings we look and wait for the accomplishment of
redemption, Romans 8. 23.

This Hope, when it is grown strong and lively, has its (...), that is, Its
full assurance, even as Faith has, Heb. 6. 11. 1 Pet. 1. 3.

2. Fear of offending God, because of his mercy, 1 Pet. 1. 17. Psalm. 130. 4.

3. A contempt, or a base account of all worldly things, in respect of Christ
Jesus, Phil. 3. 7, 8.

4. A love of God in Christ, which is as strong as death, and as a fire that
cannot be quenched, Cant. 8. 6.

5. An fervent zeal to Gods glory, Romans 9. 3.

6. An anguish of mind for our own sins; and also for the sins of others,
Psalm. 119. 136. 2 Pet. 2. 7, 8.

7. An exceeding great joy in the holy Ghost, Romans 14. 17.

The sixth part of inherent holiness, 6. Part. Sanctification of body.
is sanctity of body.

By this in the power of the holy spirit, the body is made a fit instrument for
the Soul to accomplish that which is good by it, Romans 6. 19.

Of Repentance, and fruits thereof.
Repentance does follow Faith and sanctification, Repentance.
and yet in such as are converted it does first manifest it self.

Repentance is when a sinner turns to the Lord, Act. 26. 20. Ezekiel. 33. 11,
19. 1 John 3. 3.

Repentance is then true, when as any one, by the motion and instinct of the
holy Ghost, does purpose, will, desire, and endeavor, to forsake his sins, and
to turn unto the Lord, and to become a new man, Psalm. 119. 112. Act. 11. 23.

The fruits of repentance is Christian conversation, Its fruits.
in which we bring forth fruits worthy amendment of life, Matthew. 3. 8.

A Christian conversation is such a course of life, as in which we do follow
Christ's example, and through the power of his spirit dwelling in us, perform
new obedience to God, Matthew. 11. 29. 1 Pet. 4. and 2. 21. and 3. 10, 11.

Of new obedience. New obedience.

The parts of new obedience are these.

1. The denial of our selves, Matthew. 16. 24.

2. The profession of Christ.

The denial of our selves consists.

1. In Christian warfar. Parts of self-denial.


2. In the patient bearing of the Cross.

The parts of Christian warfar are.

1. The preparation to the battle. 1. Part of Christian warfar.


2. The combat.

The preparation to the battle consists in the use of the complete armor of
God, Ephesians. 6. 13.

The pieces, or parts of the complete armor of God are these. The complete
armor of God.


1. Truth, Ephesians. 6. 14.

2. Justice and righteousness, Ephesians. 6. 14.

3. Evangelical obedience, which is the shoeing of the feet with the shoes of
the preparation of the Gospel of peace, Ephesians 6. 15.

4. Faith, ( Ephesians. 6. 16.) as the shield whereby we must quench all the fiery
darts of the wicked.

5. The sword of the spirit, which is the word of God, Ephesians. 6. 17.

6. The Helmet of salvation, Ephesians. 6. 17.

7. Continual, and fervent prayer with watching and fasting, Ephesians. 6. 18. 1 Pet
5. 8.

The Combat is a mutual conflict of them that fight spiritually. A Christians
Combat.


The Combatants, The Combatants.
or Warriors are the Tempter, and the Christian Soldier, Ephesians. 6. 12.

The tempter is the Prince of the power of the air, that is, the Devil and his
Angels, which are spiritual wickedness in high places.

Their helpers are the flesh and the world.

The conflict of all these enemies is temptation, by this they do provoke a man
to commit such wickedness, as is hurtful to the salvation of his Soul, 1 Pet.
2. 11.

In the Soldier we must consider his resisting, and his fall.

Resisting is an action, whereby the Soldier through grace working inwardly in
him, does withstand temptation, 1 John 2. 14. 1 Pet. 5. 8. Ephesians. 6. 16. Psalm.
91. 13.

The Soldier must strengthen, and confirm himself with these preservatives.

1. When a man is tempted to sin, Confirmation of the Soldier, consisting in
three things.
he must not only abstain from it, but also earnestly love, and follow after
the contrary, viz. righteousness, and holiness, 1 Pet. 5. 9. Ephesians. 4. 27. Jam.
4. 7.

2. He must never consent to Satan's words, whether he speak truth, ( Mark. 1.
24.) or accuse falsely, ( Joh. 8. 44.) or flatter dissemblingly, Act. 16. 17.

3. He must look for one temptation after another, and then especially when his
enemy seems to be at rest with him, as though he had made a truce with him.
For, Satan is such an enemy, as will never make an end of his malice, 1 Pet 5.
8.

The fall of the Soldier is then, when he faints through infirmity, and as
being subdued by the power and violence of his enemy, Gal. 6. 1.

The remedy for the restoring a man thus fallen, must be by instructing him in
the spirit of meekness, Gal. 6. 1.

Here for encouragement every man may remember this for his comfort.

1. That in whomsoever there is a willing heart, That man shall be accepted for
that grace which he has, and is manifested in the willingness of his heart,
and not for that which he has not, 2 Cor. 8. 12.

2. He that will live godly in Christ must always remember in all these things,
that the power of God is made perfect through our infirmity, 2 Cor. 12. 9, 10.

Of the assaults in this Combat.
1. Assaults in the Combat.
The Devil assaults a man about his effectual calling.

The temptation here is this.

The Devil striveth to blind a man's mind, and to harden his heart, least the
word of God should work in him to salvation, Matthew. 13. 4. to the 19.

This temptation must be resisted by giving ear, and endeavoring to receive
the word, that so through the spirit of God it may be grafted in our hearts,
and spring in us, Luke 8. 15. Heb. 4. 2. Jam. 1. 21.

Preservatives for the resisting of this temptation are these.

1. Meditate on the power, and use of the word, Eccles. 1. 17. and 5. 1.

2. Attend diligently unto it with thy mind, Acts 16. 14.

3. Hunger after it with the longing desires of the heart, Joh. 7. 37.

4. Labor to be pure in life, Psalm. 26. 6.

5. Cast away evil affections, Jam. 1. 21.

6. Be doers of the word, Jam. 1. 22.

7. Consent always to the truth of the word preached, Act. 2. 37.

8. With David hide, or treasure up the word of God in your hearts that you sin
not, Psalm. 119. 11.

9. Reverence, and tremble at the presence of God in the assembly of the
Church, Isai 66. 2. Act. 10. 33.

In the hearing of the word the fall is coldness in hearing, or receiving of
it, or else a falling into errors.

The remedy here is to restore by the spirit of meekness, and that, because we
our selves are also subject to be tempted, and thus doing is to bear one
another burdens, and to fulfill the Law of Christ, Gal. 6. 1. 2.

The second Assault. The second Assault.

The second assault is concerning Faith.

The temptation here is this, the Devil puts it into the heart of a godly
man that he is not elect, that he is not justified, that he has no Faith, and
that therefore he will be condemned for his sins, Matt. 4. 3.

To weaken a man's Faith, the Devil will take occasion to tempt him.

1. From his adversities, dangers, losses, persecutions, and grievous offenses.
Thus he deals with David, Psalm. 73. 12. and Job 13. 23, 24, 25.

2. From the remembrance of sin past, Job 13. 26.

3. From a feeling of death, even already at hand.

Here resistance must be thus made. In the power of true Faith, we must apply
Christ, and all his benefits to our selves. Thus

I assuredly believe that I shall not be condemned, that I am elected, and
justified in Christ, and I am out of all doubt that all my sins are pardoned,
Isai 53. 11. Romans 8. 38, 39.

In this temptation the preservative from the fall is steadfastly to look unto,
and rely upon Christ, the object of our Faith, Phil. 3. 12. to the 14. Joh. 3.
14.

The fall upon this temptation is doubtfulness, and distrust of Gods mercy, and
of our own elections, as in David, Ps. 76. 6, 7, 8. and 21. 1. The remedies to
recover this fall are

1. The powerful operation of the holy spirit in increasing Faith, and
stirring of it up, Phil. 1. 6. Luk* 17. 5. 2. Holy Meditations, as

1. That it is the commandment of God that we should believe in Christ, 1 John
3. 23.

2 That the promises of the Gospel exclude none, but those that exclude
themselves, Isai 55. 1. Matthew. 11. 28. Joh. 3. 15.

3. That doubtfulness, and despair are most grievous sins.

4. That with Abraham we must under hope believe against hope, Romans 4. 18.

5. That the mercies of God, and the merits of Christ's obedience do belong unto
all those that believe, Isai 54. 10. Ps. 103. 11. 1 John 2, 1. 2. Ps. 130. 7.

6. That God measures the obedience due unto him more by the affection, and
true desire of the heart to obey, than by the external act, and outward
performance of obedience, Romans 8. 5, 7. and the 7. 20, 21, 22. Malach. 3. 17.

7. That when one sin is forgiven, all* the rest also are forgiven; For,
forgiveness being once given without any limit of time, is given for ever, Romans
11. 29. Act. 10. 43.

8. That Grace and Faith are not taken away by sins of infirmity; but they are
hereby declared, and made manifest, Romans 5. 20. 2 Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9

9. That God works by contrary means, and his power is made perfect through
weakness, 2. 12. 9.

The third Assault.
The third assault is concerning sanctification. The third Assault.


Here the temptation is a provoking to sin.

The Devil provokes to sin according as he finds a man's disposition.

Secondly, as occasion offers it self, thus he provoked David to number the
people, 1 Chronicles. 21. 1. And Judas to betray Christ, John 13. 2.

Here the Devil to further his temptation will diminish the sin, that he would
have a man commit, and that

1. Either by closely objecting to us Gods mercy. Or 2. by covering and hiding
from us the punishment due to sin.

Helps by which the Devil furthereth himself in his temptations, are

1. The flesh.

The flesh lusts against the spirit, 1. by getting evil motions and
affections, 2. by overwhelming and oppressing good intents and motions, Gal. 5.
17. to the 21. Jam. 1. 14.

2. The World.

The World helps the Devil by its pleasure, profit, honor, evil examples, by
which the Devil labors to bring men into disobedience and sin, Ephesians. 2. 3.
1 John 2. 16.

These temptations may be resisted by desire of the holy spirit, for it works
good motions and affections in the faithful; And it does drive forth evil
motions, Gal. 5. 22. 26.

We may strengthen our selves in resisting thus: 1. If we count no sin light,
or small, Gal. 5. 9. Romans 6. 23. 2. If we do avoid all occasions of sin, 1
These. 5. 22. Judge 23. 3. We must accustom our selves to subdue the less sins,
that so we may the more easily overcome the greater, Romans 13. 4. 4. We must
ever employ our selves in employments, good and warrantable by the word of God.
5. We must oppose against the rebellion, and looseness of our flesh. 1. The Law.
2. The judgments of God. 3. The last judgment. 4. The glorious presence of
God, and the like, Prove. 28. 14. Genesis 39. 9.

Remedies against unjust anger, Remedies against unjust anger,
and against private desire of revenge are these.

1. If we do consider that injuries happen unto us by the appointment of the
Lord for our good, as David speaks of Shemei cursing him, 2 Samuel 16. 10.

2. If we consider that God of his goodness forgiveth us more sins than it is
possible for us to forgive men.

3. If we consider that it is the duty of Christian love to forgive others.

4. If we consider that they are the redeemed of Christ as well as we, and that
therefore we must not desire to destroy them.

5. If we consider that we are in danger of the wrath of God, if we suffer our
anger to burn against our brother, Matthew. 6. 14.

6. If we consider that we do not rightly understand the circumstances of the
facts, or what the mind, or purpose was of those against whom we swell.

Remedies, Against wrath.
or bridles against wrath are these:

1. If we do imitate the Lord in mercy, who does bear long with the wicked,
Matthew. 11. 29. 2 Pet. 3. 9.

2. If we make a pause, or a delay betwixt our anger and the execution of it.

3. If we go out of the place where those are with whom we are angry.

4. If we endeavor to avoid contention, both in word and deed.

5. If we will but often meditate on this, that he shall have judgment without
mercy that shows no mercy, and that mercy rejoices against judgment, Jam.
2. 13.

Remedies against desires of riches and honor are these: Against covetousness.
1. If we consider, that in famine God does quicken and revive those that fear
him, Psalm. 33. 18, 19. 2. That godliness is great gain, 1 Timothy 6. 6. 3. That we
are not to make our abode upon the earth, but traveling through the world to
Heaven, and waiting here for the resurrection, and inheritance of eternal life.
4. That we are here servants of God, and that he therefore will provide us
conveniences. 5. That ambition and pride blinds a man's mind, and thus
makes his downfall greater. An ambitious man fears to be humbled, least he
should not be exalted. 6. That pride, and ambition brought ruin upon mankind
even in Paradise. 7. That he robs God of his honor, that takes that glory to
himself, which is only due to God.


Remedies against the desires of the flesh are these: Against the desires of
the flesh.
1. If we consider, that none can be Christ's Disciples but those that live in a
continual self denial, Luke 9. 23. 2. That those that are of the spirit ought
always to savor the things of the spirit, Romans 8. 15. 3. That those which walk
after the flesh, shall die, Romans 8. 13. 4. That, even here; for holiness and
righteousness, we ought to walk as Citizens of the Kingdom of Heaven, Phil. 3.
20. 5. That our bodies are the Temples of God, 1 Cor. 3. 16. 6. That our
Members are Members of Christ, 1 Cor. 6. 15. 7. That we must not grieve the
spirit of God which dwells in us, 1 Cor. 6. 16. Romans 8. 9. Ephesians. 4. 30.


In these temptations by the flesh the fall is, any offense through infirmity,
which a man by these temptations of Satan is overtaken withal, Gal 6. 1.

In these falls Satan will much aggravate, and make greater the offense
committed than it is. And he will also terrify the offendour with the
judgments of God, Matt. 27. 3, 4, 7.

Here the remedy is

To renew our repentance.

The beginning of this repentance is godly sorrow, or sorrow toward Godward, 2
Cor. 7. 9, 11.

The fruits of this repentance are seven. 1. A purpose, and endeavor to live
according to the rule of Gods word. 2. Confession of sins before God, and an
earnest entreaty of pardon for the offense at his hands, Ps. 32. 5. 2 Samuel 12.
3. 3. An holy indignation against a man's a self for his offense. 4 A fear, not
so much because of the punishment, as least God should be highly displeased
with the sin, Ps. 130. 3. 5. A desire to be delivered from sin, and to be fully
renewed in life. 6. A fervent zeal to love God, and to embrace, and keep his
Cammandments. 7. A holy revenge, which a man must take of himself for the
taming, and subduing of his flesh, least afterward he should again fall into
the same offense. Second part of self denial.


The second part of self-denial is, The patient bearing of the Cross.

The Cross is nothing else but that measure of afflictions, which every
faithful man, by the will of God, passes under, in his traveling through the
World to Heaven, Matthew. 16. 24. Colos. 1. 24. No man is to seek affliction, or
to multiply his own troubles, but when God lays affliction upon a man, he is
to bear it willingly, and patiently, Colos. 1. 11. Luke 21. 19.

Patience is thus strengthened. To strengthen patience.


1. By the holy Ghost, Phil. 4. 13. and 1. 29. 2. By holy Meditations. As 1.
That afflictions come not to a Faithful man by chance, but through the counsel
and providence of God, Genesis 4 5* 4, 5. 2 Samuel 16. 10. Psalm. 119 71. The
afflictions of the godly are inevitable, Act. 14. 22. Matt. 7. 14. Joh 16. 33.
2 Timothy 3. 12.

Secondly, That though they be grievous, yet they are good and profitable, in
that by them we are humbled for our sins before God, and obtain peace, and
holiness of life, 2 Cor. 1. 9. Isai 26. 16. Hos 5. 15. Psalm. 78. 34. Jer. 31.
18. Heb. 2. 10. and 12. 11. Ps. 30. 5. Joh. 15. 2. Afflictions are the godly
men's high way to Heaven.
1 Pet. 1. 6. 2 Cor. 1. 4. Romans 5* 3.

Afflictions in the godly are signs of their adoption, Heb. 12. 6, 7. It is a
praise for the godly to do well, and for it to suffer evil patiently at the
hands of the wicked, 1 Pet. 2. 20.

They are a godly man's highway to Heaven, Jam. 1. 12. 2 Cor. 4. 17.

Thirdly, That God has promised favor and mitigation of punishment, his
presence in them, and deliverance from them, 1 Cor. 10. 13. Phil. 1. 29. 2 Samuel
7. 14. Ps. 50. 15. and 121. 4. Isai 43. 2.

Fourthly, That in all our troubles and afflictions, we do but take part in
that which Christ our Lord has suffered before us, 1 Pet. 4. 13. 2 Cor. 4. 10.
Colos. 1. 24.

Fifthly, That in all our afflictions we have Angels ministering for our defense
and comfort, Ps. 34. 7. 2 Kings 6. 16. The Prophet Elisha saw the Mountain full
of Angels for his defense.

So much for the denial of our selves.

The second part of new obedience is the profession of Christ. The profession
of Christ.


This profession does concern either Christ himself, or us his Members. The
profession of Christ, which does directly concern Christ from us, is, 1. Either
continual, or 2. In time of danger.

1. Our continual profession, Continual profession.
which does directly concern Christ, is the calling upon the name of God; this
is a duty that is always required of us in the name of him our Mediator, 1
Cor. 1. 2. Act. 9. 14. Colos. 3. 17.

Gods name is called upon, 1. by prayer, or 2. thanksgiving, Phil. 4. 6.

Prayer has two parts, 1. Petition, 2. Assent.

Petition is an asking things necessary at the hands of God in the name of
Christ, according to the rule of Gods word, 1 John 5. 14.

In every petition we must express a sense of our wants, and a desire of the
grace of God to supply those wants, 1 Samuel 1. 10, 15, 17. Dan. 9. 4, 20. Ps.
130. 1. and 143. 6.

By assent we do believe, and profess before God our belief, that he in his due
time will grant us our requests, which we have made unto his Majesty, 1 John 5.
14, 15. Matthew. 6. 1.

Though the faithful may discover many infirmities in their prayers, yet they
have a notable sense of Gods favor, Psalm. 6. 1, 2, 3, 4. and 8. 9 and 16. 7.
and 20. 5. and 3 5. 9, 8, 20.

And especially when they do pray zealously, Jam. 5. 16) And when they do pray
often to the Lord.

Examples of infirmities discovered in prayer. Infirmities in prayer.


Zacharias feared when he prayed, Luke 1. 13.

Jonah was displeased and angry, Jonah. 4. 12.

Thanksgiving is a calling upon Gods name, by which we do with joy and gladness
of heart praise God for his benefits; Either received, Ephesians. 5. 20. or
promised, Psalm. 36. 8, 9. Collos. 3. 16, 17.

This for the continual profession of Christ.

2. Profession in time of danger*
Our profession of Christ in time of danger, is either, 1. In word, or 2. In
deed.

Profession of Christ in word, is called Christian Apology, or the confession
of Christ, as Romans 10. 10. Psalm. 22. 22.

Christian Apology, or profession of Christ in word is, when with fear and
meekness we are always ready to confess the truth of Christian Religion as
often as need requires, and that in the presence of unbelievers, that the name
of God may be glorified, 1 Pet. 3. 15, 16. Act. 7. 1. to the end.

We are not bound to make this confession of our faith before unbelievers that
are past all hope of repentance; For holy things must not be given unto Dogs,
Matt. 7. 6.

Profession of Christ in time of danger indeed; is called Martyrdom.

Martyrdom is an undergoing of the punishment of death, for the profession of
Christ in the Doctrine of Faith, and for Justice, and for the salvation of the
brethren. For Justice, John Baptist was beheaded of Herod, Mark. 6. 18. 27. 28.

Christ laid down his life for us, so ought we, if need require for the
brethren, 1 John 3. 16.

For maintaining the Doctrine of Faith, Stephen was stoned, Act. 7. 59.

And yet this does nothing let Christians the using of all holy security, for
the safety of their own lives.

For (as Christ has showed in the Gospel.) It is lawful for Christians in
times of persecution, if they find themselves not sufficiently resolved, and
strengthened by the holy Spirit to stand, to fly from place to place for the
security of their lives, Matt. 10. 23. Joh. 10. 39.

This Christ did, and advised his Disciples to do the like.

Upon such occasions as these, Paul fled to Tarsus, Act. 9. 30.

And upon like occasions Eliah fled for his life from Jezabel, 1 Kings 19. 3, 4.

Thus much for the profession of Christ, which concerns Christ himself.

The profession of Christ, Profession of Christ, as it concerns his Members.
which concerns his Members, is, either, 1. Edification, or 2. Alms.

Edification is every particular duty of us toward our brethren, which may
further them in their growing up in Christ, and Unite them more surely to him,
Romans 14. 19.

To edification belong these things:

1. To give good example, Matt. 5. 16. 1 Pet. 2. 12.

2. To exhort, Heb. 3. 13. Romans 1. 12.

3. To comfort, 1 These. 5. 14. and 4. 18. Jam. 5. 16, 20.

4. To admonish, Romans 15. 14. 1 These. 5. 14.

They do observe a holy manner of admonishing, who do ever admonish in the
spirit of meekness, and so, as if they themselves were guilty of the like
infirmities, and of such faults, as they do certainly know by them whom they
admonish out of Gods word, Gal 6. 1. Matt. 7. 5. 2 Timothy 4. 2. Matt. 18. 15.

or relief is that, whereby the rich out of their abundance ought freely,
largely, and with open hands to supply the wants of the poor, and that to the
utmost of their ability, and sometimes beyond it, 2 Cor 8. 3. Acts 2. 44, 45.

In the days of the Apostles all those that were converted to the Faith by the
powerful operation of the holy Spirit, esteemed no worldly thing they had
their own, but held all their worldly store, Treasures, and inheritances in
common; yea, they sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men
as every one had need.

So much for Edification and Alms.

The fourth degree of the Declaration of Gods love, Fourth d^gree of the
Declaration of Gods love.
is Glorification, Romans 8. 30.

Glorification is the perfect transforming of the Saints into the image of the
Son of God, Glorification.
Phil. 3. 21. 1 Cor. 15. 14, 49. Psalm. 17. 15.

Glorification is begun in this life, and exceedingly enlarged at the day of
death, and will be fully, and thoroughly perfected at the general resurrection
in the last day: death of the faithful is a sleep in Christ; In this sleep the
Soul is for a time severed from the body, 1 Cor. 15* 17. Act. 7. 60.

The body lies in the earth and sees corruption, and at length is raised to
greater glory than at first it had, 1 Cor. 15. 36.

The Soul is severed from it, that being fully sanctified it may immediately
upon its departure from the body be transported to Heaven, Luke 13. 42. ^3.
Rev. 14. 13.

Remedies against death, Remedies against death.
or the fear of it are these:

1. If we consider that it is nothing else but a freeing of the faithful from
the Tyranny of the world, flesh, and Devil, and a placing of them safe under
the shadow of the wings of Christ.

2. If we consider that death, and the grave are sanctified to us through the
death of Christ.

3. If we do consider that Christ is gain unto us as well in death as in life,
Phil. 1. 21.

4. If we consider that the pains of death are nothing to the comforts after
death.

5. That we shall see God in the brightness of his glory and Majesty, and be
received into the company of glorified Spirits, in Heaven.

6. That our Souls shall be clad with glory instead of our bodies, 2 Cor. 11.
5.

7. That we are by it free from all the power of the Serpent, and of the sting
of death, 1 Cor. 15. 55. Heb. 2. 15.

8. If we do not so much think of our death as exactly, and diligently consider
our life; For he that lives well cannot die ill, and he that lives ill does
seldom die well.

9. That the Angels of God are ready to carry our Souls into Heaven, so soon as
they do depart from our bodies.

And our Souls being by them brought into Heaven shall there magnify the name
of God;

And shall there wait for, and pray for the consummation of the Kingdom of
glory, and for the full and perfect felicity of body and Soul, Rev. 5. 8, 9.
and 14. 2, 3. and 6. 10.

The estate of the Elect at the last judgment. The state osf the Elect at the
last judgment.


The manner of the last day is this.

1. Immediately before the coming of Christ, the powers of heaven shall be
shaken, the Sun and Moon shall be darkened, the Stars shall fall from Heaven,
Matthew. 24. 29, 30. Then the elect and faithful seeing this, shall lift up their
heads and rejoice. But at this sight the Reprobate shall fear and tremble, Luke
21. 26, 28. 2 Timothy 4. 8.

2. The Heavens being on fire, shall suddenly pass away with a great noise, and
the Elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the earth, and the works therein
shall be burned up, 2 Pet. 3. 12, 13.

At the same time when all these things shall come to pass, the sound of the
last Trumpet shall be heard sounded by the Archangel, Matt. 44 31. 1 These. 4.
16.

Then shall Christ the Lord come suddenly in the Clouds with power and glory,
and great train of Angels, Matt. 24. 30. 1 These. 4. 17.

3. At the sound of this Trumpet all the dead shall rise.

And those that are found alive shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye,
which change shall be in stead of death, 1 Cor. 15. 51, 52, 53.

Then shall all the bodies of the elect and faithful be glorified, and made
glorious like the body of Christ; Then, their bodies shall be spiritual,
immortal, glorious, and free from all infirmity, 1 Cor. 15. 43, 44.

4. They being all thus gathered together before the Tribunal seat of Christ,
he will forthwith place the elect at his right hand, and the reprobate at his
left hand; Then will he say, come ye blessed, to the elect, and they shall be
taken into Heaven, and he will say, go ye cursed, to the reprobate, and they
shall be cast into Hell, Matthew. 25. 33. 1 These. 4. 17. Rev. 20. 15.

The state of the Elect after the last judgment. The state of the Elect after
the last judgment.


The last judgment being finished the elect shall immediately enjoy an
everlasting blessedness in the Kingdom of Heaven.

Blessedness is that, whereby God himself is all in all his elect, 1 Cor. 15.
28. This is the reward of the good works of the faithful, their works being
accepted of God for the merit of Christ's righteousness imputed to them, Romans 6.
23. 2 Timothy 4. 8. Rev. 22. 12.

Blessedness does consist in eternal life, and perfect glory.

Eternal life is that fellowship with God, Eternal life what it is.
by which himself is life unto the elect, through the Lamb Christ Jesus, John
14. 23. 1 John 4. 15. Rev. 2^. 3, 23. and 22. 2, 5.

For, in the Kingdom of Heaven they shall neither need meat, drink, sleep, air,
heat, cold, physic, apparel, or the light of the Sun, Moon, or Stars.

But in the stead of all these they shall have in them Gods holy spirit, by
which they shall immediately most gloriously be quickened for ever, Revel. 21. 3,
23. and 22. 2, 5. 1 Cor. 15. 45. Romans 8. 11.

Perfect glory. -- Perfect glory what it is.


Is that wonderful excellency of the elect, by which they shall be in a far
better state than any tongue can utter, or any heart can here wish, or think.

This glory consists in these things:

1. We shall see God face to face, we shall ever behold his face; which is, his
glory and his Majesty, Rev. 22. 4. Psalm. 17. 15.

2. We shall be most like to Christ, that is, we shall be just, holy,
incorruptible, glorious, honorable, beautiful, strong, mighty, nimble, 1 John
3. 2. Phil. 3. 21.

3. We shall ever inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, for the new Heavens and the
new Earth shall be our inheritance, 1 Pet. 1. 4. Matthew. 25. 34. Revel. 5. 10.
and 2^. 7.

The fruits of this blessedness are: The fruits of eternal life, and perfect
glory.
1. Eternal joy. 2. The perfect service of God, Ps. 16. 11, 36, 8, 9.


The parts of this service are: 1. Praise, 2. Thanksgiving, Rev. 5. 12 and 19.
5 and 11. 17.

The manner of performing this service is this:

We shall immediately worship God, by God himself; For in Heaven there is
neither Temple, Ceremony, nor Sacrament; For God and the Lamb is the Temple
thereof, and God himself together with the Lamb shall supply all, Rev. 21. 22.
And this service shall be daily, for ever, and without intermission, Rev. 7. 15.

A Corolary, A Cororaly.
or the advantage, overplus, or last conclusion.
GOd in thus saving the elect, does clearly set forth his Justice and his mercy.

His Justice appears in, that he punishes the sins of the elect in his Sons
own person.

His mercy appears, in that he pardons their sins for the merits of his
Son, Ephesians. 1. 18, 19, 20. and 3. 18. 19.

These things the Lord has thus decreed, and in his good time he will
accomplish them, to the glorious praise of his name, Pro. 16. 4. The Lord has
made all things for himself; yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.

Of the Decree of Reprobation. The Decree of Reprobation.

The decree of Reprobation is that part of predestination, by which God,
according to the most free, and just purpose of his will, has determined to
reject some to eternal destruction and misery, and that for the praise of his
Justice, Romans 9. 21. 1 Pet. 2. 8. Jude 4. 1 These. 5. 9.

In the Scriptures, Cain and Abel, Ishmael and Isaac, Esau and Jacob are
propounded to us as Types of mankind partly elected, partly rejected.

The decree of damnation is not here absolutely set down, as that we should
think that any man is condemned by the mere, and alone will of God, without any
causes inherent in themselves.

The decree of God is secret, it does arise only from the good pleasure of
God. It is unsearchable and adored by the Angels. It is not known, but by that
which follows it, namely by the effects thereof.

Of the execution of the Decree of Reprobation.
The beginning and the foundation of the execution of this decree of
reprobation is the fall of Adam. The execution of this Decree.


He by his fall made himself, and his posterity subject, both to sin and
damnation, Romans 5. 12, 13. Romans 6. 23. and 11. 32.

God so has decreed to condemn some, as that notwithstanding all the fault and
desert of condemnation remains in themselves, for they fall into sin, and God
hates them for their sins.

This hatred which God has to man comes by Adams fall; And it is neither an
antecedent, nor a cause of Gods decree, but it follows the decree as a
consequent.

Reprobates are some of them called, by an uneffectual calling, and some of
them are not called at all.

In those that are called by an uneffectual calling Gods decree of reprobation
has three degrees in its execution. There are three Degrees of the execution
of Gods Decree of reprobation.


1. An acknowledgement of Gods calling.

2. A falling away again. 1. Degree of the execution of the Decree of
reprobation is the acknowledgement of Gods calling.


3. Condemnation.

1. The acknowledgment of Gods calling is, when Reprobates do for a time
subject themselves to the calling of God, which calling is workt by the
preaching of the word, Matthew. 22. 14.

There are of the acknowledgement of Gods calling five degrees.

1. An enlightening of their minds, whereby they are instructed of the holy
Ghost, that they may understand and know the word, Heb 6. 4. 2 Pet 2. 20.

2. The second degree of the acknowledgement of Gods calling, is a certain
kind of penitency, by this penitency the reprobate do acknowledge their sins,
as did the Children of Israel, Deuteronomy. 1. 41.

And are pricked with a feeling of Gods wrath for sin, as was Cain, Genesis 4. 13.

And they are grieved for the punishment of sin, as was Ahab, 1 Kings 21. 27.

And do confess their sin, as did Judas, Matthew. 27. 3.

And do acknowledge God to be just in punishing of sin, Number. 23* 10

And do desire to be saved, as Baalam, Numb. 23. 10.

And do in their misery and afflictions promise repentance, saying, we will sin
no more, Psalm. 78. 32, 33, 34, 35.

3. Degree of the acknowledgement of Gods calling is:

1. A Temporary Faith, for a reprobate is content with a general Faith, he does
confusedly believe the promises made in Christ, but he does never apply the
promises of God to himself; Nay, he has no purpose to desire, or endeavor to
apply the same; he has no wrestling, or striving against security,
carelessness, or distrust, he believes that some shall be saved, but not
particularly that he himself shall be saved, Jam. 2. 29. Matt. 13. 20, 21. Joh.
2. 23, 24.

4. The fourth Degree of the acknowledgement of Gods calling is:

A tasting of heavenly gifts, as of 1. Justification, 2. Of sanctification, 3.
Of the powers, and virtues of the world to come.

This tasting of heavenly gifts is a sense in their hearts, by which they do
feel and perceive the excellency of Gods benefits, but they do not enjoy the
same; For they do not feed on these banckets, nor are they nourished by them,
but they do only taste of them, Heb. 6. 4, 5.

5. The fifth Degree of the acknowledgement of Gods calling is:

1. An outward holiness of life for a time, under this is comprehended a zeal
in the profession of Religion, 2. A reverence and fear toward God, 3. An
amendment of life in many things, as it was in Herod, Mark. 6. 20. and in Simon
Magus, Acts 3. 13.

2. 2. Degree of the execution of the decree of reprobation is a falling away
after calling.
Degree of the execution of the decree of reprobation in those that are called
by an uneffectual calling is:

A falling away again after calling, this comes to pass after this manner. 1.
The reprobate is deceived by some sin. 2. His heart is hardened by the same
sin. 3. His heart being hardened becomes wicked, and perverse. 4. Upon this
follows unbelief, so that he will not consent unto Gods word, though he
hears it, and knows it. 5. There does immediately upon this unbelief follow
an Apostasy, or a falling away from Faith in Christ, Heb. 3. 12. 13. 1 Timothy 1.
19.

Apostasy is sometimes a sin against the holy Ghost; The sin against the holy
Ghost is so called, because it is done contrary to the illumination of the holy
Ghost: It is a set, and a stubborn, obstinate malice done knowingly, against
God and against Christ, and that after illumination, or enlightening by the holy
Spirit, Heb. 10. 29. It is a general, or total defection, and Apostasy from
God, after enlightening by the holy Spirit, out of mere stubborness, and malice
of heart, Heb. 10. 29. and 6. 5, 6.

It is hard to know when a man commits this sin, 1. because the root of it,
which is malice, lurketh secretly in the heart, and therefore it cannot be
easily discerned. This sin is not found in all the reprobates, because many of
them die before they are enlightened by the holy Spirit of God.

Those that commit this sin do never repent, and therefore can never receive
pardon.

The elect cannot commit this sin, therefore those, who do feel in themselves a
sure Testimony of their election need never despair.

After Apostasy follows pollution, which is the very fullness of all
iniquity, and it is altogether contrary to sanctification, Genesis 15 16.

He does not Apostatise, nor sin against the holy Ghost* that in time of
persecution does either rashly, or for fear deny Christ, for Peter thus for
fear did deny Christ, Matthew. 29. 73, 74, 75.

He that does ignorantly persecute the Church as did Paul, does not sin this
sin, 1 Timothy 1 13. And as did the Jews, Act. 3. 17. and 2. 37.

3. 3. Degree or the execution of the decree of reprobation is damnation.
The third degree of the execution of the d^cree of reprobation in those that
are called by an uneffectual calling is:

Damnation, by which they are delivered up to eternal punishment. The execution
of damnation begins in death, and is finished in the last judgment, Luke
16. 22, 23.

The execution of the decree of reprobation in those which are not called* is
this: The exec^^^^n of this decree, in those that are not called, and the state
of reprobates whilst they live.


1. They have by nature ignorance and vanity of mind, Ephesians. 4. 18. 2. Hardness
of heart follows this, by which they do become void of all sorrow for their
sins, Ephesians. 4. 18. 3. There does follow this hardness of heart a reprobate
sense, that is, an extinguishing of the natural light of reason, or of the
judgment of good and evil. And 4. when the heart does cease to sorrow for sin,
there does follow a committing of sin with greediness, Ephesians. 4. 19. 5. Upon this
follows pollution, which is the fullness of sin. And then 6. a just reward is
given to all these, viz. fearful condemnation, Ephesians. 4. 18. Romans 1. 28.

The estate and condition of reprobates when they are dead, is this

1. Their estate when they are dead.
Their bodies being dead lie in the earth.

2 Their Souls are tormented in hell, Luke 16. 25 1 Pet. 3 19. 2 Pet. 2. 4.

And in the last judgment their bodies and Souls being united shall be cast
into the most fearful, and terrible fire of Hell, Matthew 25. 41.

Reprobates when they die do become senseless, and astonished like unto a stone,
as did Nabal, 1 Samuel 25. 37, 38.

Or else they are overwhelmed with a terrible horror of conscience, and with a
despairing of their salvation, as if they were overturned and swallowed up, as
with a gulf of the Sea, as Judas, Matthew. 27. 5.

Their condemnation is this:

At the sound of the last Trumpet they that are alive shall be smitten with
horror, and with fear, Their condemnation.
and they shall be changed in a moment, and those of them that are dead shall
rise again, and their bodies shall then be made immortal, and cast into eternal
torments, Matthew. 25. 41. Joh. 5. 29. 1 These. 4. 16. 17.

Christ will pass this sentence of go ye cursed upon them, and this being by
him pronounced against them, immediately everlasting death shall follow.

The manner of which is this: The manner of it.


1. They shall be separated from the glory, and presence of God, 2 These. 1 9.

2. They shall be punished with eternal confusion, and with bitter reproaches*
For, all their secret wickedness and sins shall be revealed, 2 These. 1. 9.
Isai. 66. 24.

3. Their fellowship shall be with the Devil, and his Angels for ever, Matthew.
25. 41.

4. Their bodies and Souls shall be tormented with horror, and exceeding great
anguish, through the sense and feeling of Gods wrath, which shall be poured out
upon them for ever, Isai 66* 24.

And by reason of their great tortures, their punishment is called Hell: fire,
a worm, weeping, and gnashing of teeth, and outer darkness. Rev. 21. 8. Matthew
13. 42. Isai 66. 24.

A Corolary, A Corolary.
or the advantage, overplus, or last Conclusion.
IN this, which has been spoken concerning reprobation, the Justice of God in
punishing sin does appear.

And from it arises Gods glory, which is the end of punishment.

For this cause also every good Christian must in all things propound Gods
glory, as the end of all his actions, Romans 9. 14, 15, 16, 17. 1 Cor. 10. 31.

The Application of Predestination.
How to discern, and judge of our own predestination.

Rules:

1. Rule.
All the elect in Gods good time are assured, and sure of their election in
Christ to eternal life, Romans 9. 14, 16. John 15. 5, 18, 19. 1 Cor. 2. 12. 2
Cor. 13. 5.

2. Rule*
The elect do come to the knowledge of their election by the effects of their
election.

1. The effects of election are the Testimony of Gods Spirit, Romans 8. 10.

2 The works of sanctification, 2 Pet. 1. 5. to the 10.

3. If any doubt of this Testimony, Rule*
it may be known whether it does come from the Spirit of God, or from her own
carnal presumption, thus:

1. By a full persuasion which they shall find in themselves, for the holy
Ghost will not only say it, but persuade them that they are Gods children.

And the flesh can in no wise do this.

2 By the manner of this persuasion, the holy Ghost does not persuade men that
they are elect by reasons drawn from their own works, or worthiness, but by
reasons drawn from the free grace, love, and favor of God. And this persuasion
does exceedingly differ from that which Satan uses.

3. By the effects of this Testimony, or persuasion; For

If this persuasion comes from the holy Ghost, it is lively and stirring. But
if it does arise from carnal presumption, it is a dead and liveless persuasion.

For all such as are truly persuaded that they are elected, and adopted
Children of God, will love God, and trust in God, and call upon God with their
whole heart.

4. Rule.
If the Testimony of Gods Spirit be not so powerful in the elect, then they
may judge of their election by their sanctification, which is an effect of the
holy Ghost, even as we may judge by heat, that there is a fire, though we see
no flame.

5. Rule*
We may know whether we be predestinate, or elect, or no, by these notable
effects of sanctification.

1. By feeling our wants, and by bewailing, in the bitterness of our hearts,
our offending of God by our sins.

2. By our continual striving against the flesh, by our resisting and hating
the godly motions thereof, and if with grief we do think them burthenous and
troublesome.

3. By an earnest and fervent desire of the grace of God, and of the merit of
Christ, that thereby we may obtain eternal life.

4. By a true esteem of it when we have obtained it, even as a most precious
Jewel, Phil. 3. 8.

5. By our love to Christians, to Ministers, to Brethren, and by our readiness
to lay down our lives for them, and with them if need so require, Matthew. 10. 42
1 John 3 16.

6. By our earnest and fervent calling upon God, and that with hearty tears, in
the sensible perceiving of those sins which we commit to his dishonor, and
therefore may have just cause to think he may be displeased with them.

7. By a desire and love to the coming of Christ, and to the day of judgment,
that there may be an end of the days of sin, 1 John 4. 17.

8. By our flying all occasions of sin, and endeavor seriously to come to
newness of life.

9. By our perseverance in such good actions and endeavors, and in such good
thoughts as these, even to the last gasp of our lives.

Luther says, Luthers saying.
he that will serve God must believe that which cannot be seen, and hope for
that which is deferred, and love God even then when he shows himself an
enemy, and thus he must remain to the end.

6. Rule.
If so be that the godly find all these notable effects of the spirit feeble
in them, and their Faith weak and faint, yet they must not doubt of their
election; but they must know that God does thus try them, and therefore they
must not be dismayed: for a weak Faith is sufficient to engraf them into Christ.

7. Rule.
He that as yet feels none of these effects in his heart, must not upon this
conclude himself to be reprobate, but he must endeavor by the reading of the
word of God, and by the use of the Sacraments, and chiefly by fervent and
earnest prayer to come to an inward sense of the power of Christ drawing him to
himself by his Spirit, and thus to come to an assurance of his redemption by
Christ's death and passion.

8. Rule.
No man can certainly say of himself, or of any other that he is reprobate, for
God does oftentimes prefer those to be in his Kingdom, which in the sight of
men seem to be most estranged from his favor; and above them also which in
outward appearance, and in the judgment of men are the Children of the
Kingdom; Thus were the Publicanes and Harlots, preferred before the Pharisees
by Christ, Matthew. 21. 31.

And many a man is called even at the eleventh hour. Matthew. 20. 6.

A notable example of this we have in the Thief upon the Cross; Luke 23. 40, 43.

The uses of this Doctrine for instruction be these: The uses of this Doctrine.


1. There is no justification by works, nor any works of ours that are
Meritorious.

For election is by the grace of God, and therefore justification also.

In the work of Salvation, grace challenges all to it self, Romans 11. 5. 2 Timothy
1. 9. Phil. 1. 29. Romans 3. 24. Tit. 3. 5. Ezekiel. 36. 27. Romans 6. 23.

2. Hence we learn that judicial Astrology, or the foretelling of what men will
be by the casting of their Nativities is false: For this does determine such
and such men shall be like in life and conversation, whom God in his
predestination has made unlike; As for example, Jacob and Esau were born of
the same parents, and almost in the same moment of time, and yet they were most
unlike in disposition, and had diverse events

The like we may see in all Twins born at the same time.

3. Hence we learn that God is most wise, omnipotent, just, and merciful, Romans
11. 33. Ephesians. 1. 5.

Here we are advised, 1. to fight against all doubtings and distrust of our
Salvation, because it does not depend upon our works, but upon Gods grace Luke
10. 20. Romans 8. 33.

2. To humble our Souls under the mighty hand of God, because we are in his
hand, even as clay in the hand of the Potter, Romans 9. 20. 21.

3. To give all the glory to God, as to whom alone it is due, 2 These. 2. 13.

4. To bear crosses, or afflictions patiently, Romans 8. 29. And that because by
this means we are conformed to Christ, and made like unto him, Phil. 3. 10

5. To do good works, and that because God has created us in Christ Jesus unto
this purpose, Ephesians. 2. 10.

To whom with the Son and holy Spirit be all glory, honor and praise, now and
ever, Amen.
