A New Fashioned Marigold Or, A dainty New-Fashion devised for Tom Stitch the
Tailor,
Then listen to my song a while,
I Am sure here is that will make you smile.
The tune is, ^ehold the Man.




THere was a young man in his prime,
that lately would be wed,
And at the last with much ado,
his purpose he had sped.
For he had got a bonny lass,
to board and eke to bed,
And with hey ho the Marigold,
hey derry derry derry derry down.
At night when they should go to bed,
the clothes they did unfold.
They went into their naked beds,
and might do what they would.
He sought al^s, but could not find
out his wifes Marigold.
And with, etc.
He sought it high, he sought it low,
and also round about,
And yet he could not find it,
within the bed nor out.
Which made this silly young man,
most greatly stand in doubt,
That his wife had never a Marigold, etc.
Betimes in the morning,
for a Tailor he did send,
And eke desir^d his counsel, for
he took him for h^s friend.
My wife, quoth he, is lame alas,
the fault now you must mend,
For she has, etc.
Therefore kind Tailor now, quoth he,
if thou will undertake,
A brave new fashion Marigold,
for my young wife to make.
I Will give thee forty shillings,
to spend even for my sake.
And with, etc.
But when the nimble Tailor,
the money did behold,
And that the forty shillings,
into his hand was cold,
He undertook forthwith to make
a famous Marigold.
And with, etc.
With that the young man gave him
full twenty shillings more,
To buy brave silks and trimmings
to make it fine before,
For that is the only fashion,
which now a days is wore.
And with hey ho the Marigold,
hey derry derry derry derry down,




THen said the nimble Tailor,
since we are now together,
Pray let your wife go home with me,
that I may take right measure.
And I Will make her a Marigold
shall do you lasting pleasure
And with hey ho the Marigold,
hey derry derry derry derry down.
To this the bonny Bridegroom,
did quickly give consent,
And so away the Tailor
with the young woman went.
To his own house wherees it is thought
he did her well content.
With hey, etc.
He brought her to his chamber, and
upon the bed her laid.
And with his piercing Bodkin then,
he drove a subtle trade,
In less then half an hour,
the Marigold was made.
And with, etc.
When he had done the practice,
he brought her back again,
Unto her loving husband,
who did her entertain.
He kissed his wife and then he thankt,
the Tailor for his pain.
And with, etc.
That night they lay together,
the good man and his wife,
And merrily they concluded
their former care and strife.
For he was never pleased so well,
before in all his life,
As when he found her Marigold.
About a fortnight after that,
this women was in pain,
It seems her pretty Marigold
was cut of frame again.
To go unto the Tailor
she could not refrain,
And with, etc.
The Tailor he took pains with her
to settle all things aright:
And as it is reported,
he lay with her all night.
And on the morrow morning,
with joy and much delight,
He sent her to her husband, with
hey derry derry derry derry down.
