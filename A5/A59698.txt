Catalogues are given at Mr. William Millers at the Acorn in St. Paul's
Churchyard, Mr. Wilkinsons at the Blackboy in Fleet Street Booksellers, and at
the abovementioned place of Sale, 1686.

TO THE READER.
TO commend this Catalogue would be to reflect on the knowledge of the
unprejudiced peruser, and to account for this way of sale, and the advantages
that have ensued to learning in General, after so many experiments made by the
Approbation of the learned and bookish Gentlemen of this City, is to lessen the
veneration I have for their Judgments. I am sufficiently sensible that the
truest representations of the books, both as to their goodness and scarcity,
has been censured by some, and interpreted by others, as formal commendations;
I therefore leave the respective Buyers to judge as they please, and to
determine as they think fit, inviting them to a view and examination of the
books, the Fourteenth and Fifteenth days of this instant, from the hours of
Nine to Twelve in the morning, and from Two to Six in the Evening.

This SALE will begin on Thursday the 16th. day of December, 1686. At Mr.
Thomas Wards, Upholster; at the Boars-Head in Cornhill, from the hours of 9 in
the Morning to 12, and from 2 to 6 in the Evening, till all the Books are Sold.
Conditions for SALE.
I. THat he who bids most is the Buyer; and if any difference arises, the same
Books to be Exposed again to Sale.

II. That the Books in this Catalogue (not otherwise expressed) are for ought
we know perfect; but if any of them appear to be otherwise before they be taken
away, the Buyer shall have his choice of leaving or taking them.

III. That the Money for the Book or Books so bought, be paid by the Buyer
within one Week after the Sale is ended, at the place of Sale; where upon
payment thereof the Book or Books so bought shall be ready to be delivered
