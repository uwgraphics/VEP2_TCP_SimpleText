To the highly Honored, and most Hopeful Gentleman, EDWARD LAVRENCE Esquire
SIR,
BEfore I pay my Debt to Nature, I would willingly discharge the Debt I owe to
your so many Civilities and Favors. And I should then Depart well pleased;
could I leave something to show, That I have Lived; And a Testimony that I Died
with the Honor of being known Your Servant. How far These few MOTTETS
(which I here humbly present you) will contribute to the Ambition of my
Design; the Modesty of an Old Man, always distrusting his own Compositions,
may make him suspect: Which yet cannot but find a Pardon, if not a Patronage
from a Soul so Harmonious as Yours. However the Offer is Pious, and the
Adventure Noble, that I should Dare to put a Spirit (for the Note is That by
which they Breath) into the Words of Excellent Sandys: Words so Pure and
Proper, as that David Himself would have sung them with Joy: I might without
Profanation have spoke higher. And had the Church of England but the Happiness
to receive into Her Assemblies Those Psalms Thus Translated; Her Enemies long
before this would have turned their Scorn into Envy, and Witty Atheists their
Scoffs into Admiration. I am sure the Prudent Worshipper of God, in stead of
Scandal, had received Delight. I complain not of all; Some I confess are
Tolerable. In the mean time I am among Those, who Mourn to see, These
transcendently Holy Raptures even in Public Worship exposed to so much Scandal
and Scorn. I could not say less to Advance the Subject of my Mottets: Nor can I
speak too much to Excuse the Meanness of the Composition: yet, having followed
the Grounds of an Art by me studied more then 50 years, something in These may
prove not unworthy of Your Eye: though the Author has at present little else to
bring him forth from Obscurity, then the Honor He hopes to receive of being
acknowledged,

Sir, Your ever obliged and ready humble Servant W. P.

To all Lovers of MUSIC.
Gentlemen,
I Must confess the most of these Mottets were composed for a great Lover of
Music, and my especial friend, Sir Edward Spencer, an Honorable Mecenas to all
Virtuoso's known to him; a person endued with exemplary gifts and virtues, who
I presumed would have lived to have seen them published, but God has taken
him, unto whose glorious Name I doubt not but he sings Alleluiahs in the
Heavenly Quire: whose goodness, though he be missing, lives in his virtuous
Lady, continuing favors and noble respect to all he loved and esteemed; giving
them to understand, their friend is not dead to them, as long as she is living,
for which may she find her reward in heaven. This worthy friend of mine being
taken away, weighing my deep engagements to several friends, but disabled
(being plunged by these tempestuous times in many dangerous storms of
adversity, and growing calamities) to retaliate their many civilities and
courtesies, yet willing, notwithstanding, to return some grateful
acknowledgment, resolved to tender these Mottets to them, not offering them for
their worthiness or merit, but as a testimony and real demonstration of my
sincere and cordial respect, not having, according to the blessed Apostle St.
Peter, either Gold or Silver, but such as I have, etc. My aim in the Composing
these Divine Hymns, was at Good Air, Variety, and to marry the Words and
Notes well together, according to the saying of that famous Musician, Mr. Robert
Johnson; I desire those to whom any of these things shall come, to have them
well voic'd, humor'd, and sung right, and to follow the rule of that excellent
Musician, my worthy friend, Mr. Thomas Ford, who familiarly said, and knew it
by experience, that no Song could be so well sung and humor'd, as that which
was known to the Performers by practice: If you shall vouchsafe to follow his
rule, and satisfy my request, I shall adventure to say with the Italian, Spero
Che questa cosa non vuol dispiacere: I hope these things will not displease
you. The Inducement of my Composing of Parts only, was in regard of the
scarcity of Voices, it being both difficult and troublesome to get two Voices,
much more three or four together, to Sing Sure and Masterlike: And the
Ignorant judge frequently by the Performance, not by the Composition; which
caus'dthat unparalleled Master of Music, my good Friend and Maestro, to
vindicate a good Composition ill performed, affirming that had he been Rector
Chori, he would have made that Song before judged had, to have passed for good.
So advantageous and necessary is the Judicious ordering and management of
Music. This I am to advertise you, that you are to sing but where there are
Words, or this sign of Repetition ^, having made the Singing Bass a Thorough
Bass; and that all the Words of these Mottets are taken out of the learned Poet
Mr. George Sandys his Paraphrase on the Holy Psalms of David, but only the
Third and Fifth. So entreating your Acceptance and charitable censure, as also
to amend the defects of the Composition in your well-performance, I rest

Yours in all love WALTER PORTER.
