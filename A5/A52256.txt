TO THE Right Honorable JOHN Lord Viscount SCUDAMORE.
My Lord,
THough it must be acknowledged, that the Latin and Greek tongues are
necessary qualifications for all Gentlemen and persons of Honor; yet do I not
think them so for all persons of a low degree, especially if the laboring for
them shall occasion the neglect of other more useful studies in reference to
their livelihood; and yet attain to so little perfection in them, that the very
rudiments of them, are in a very little time wholly forgotten also; and
therefore, methinks, another way of instructing youth, than the Latin Grammar
should be thought on, at least for such whose present fortunes and future
employments, will not in any likelihood require the knowledge of exotic
Languages: To this purpose, it has been my endeavor to effect two things for
this Town of Ross, namely to procure a competent maintenance for Gods Minister
there, that so the people may be instructed in the principles of religion and
true piety; and some endowment for an English School, by which means the
Children may be the easier taught what Religion is, as well as instructed in
those Arts and Sciences which will conduce to their more comfortable
subsistence and present being.

The first of these, by Gods blessing, and the assistance of your (no less
truly religious than) Honorable Grandfather is now effected to the Glory of
God in all future ages; and had it pleased God, to have spared him to us yet a
little longer, his favorable countenance and assistance would not have been
wanting in the other: very sensible he was that Arithmetic and Geometry are
very necessary Arts for the common sort of people to be instructed in, as well
as for those that act in a higher Sphere; and that they might be so, I have now
composed this brief and plain Treatise of Arithmetic, in such a Method, as
will I hope prove useful even for Children of but seven years of age, for
their instruction in that Science; and as a thankful acknowledgement of the
great kindness of your Honorable Grandfather to me (personally, but chiefly in
assisting me to bring in the Tithes of Ross, Brampton and Weston in this County
of Hereford to the Church) I did intend to send this little treatise into the
world in his name; but since Gods providence, (in removing him to a better
place, and more lasting Honor) has made my intentions frustrate, whither
should I go, or unto whom should I address my self, but to you, who have
succeeded him in his Honor and fortunes, and given great hopes to the world of
succeeding him in his virtues also; whose great bounty to the Clergy in the
time of their sequestration, to several Churches since his Majesty's happy
restoration, not only in endowing them, with those Tithes which the Law made
his, and purchasing others, but building convenient and beautiful habitations
for the several Incumbents in those places, his great charity to all in want,
and care to put them into such ways of living, as might make them comfortably
to subsist (as his bounty in this particular to the City of Hereford does
witness) seconded with his exemplary piety both in public and private, will
proclaim his worth, and make his name to be very precious in all succeeding
generations.

And now what shall I say more, but for as much as the eyes of all men are upon
you, and that you have succeeded this Honorable and much lamented Patriot of
our Country, as Elisha succeeded Elijah, I will only pray that a double portion
of his spirit may be upon you, that the Glory of our Country may not together
with him depart from us, as it did from Israel when the Ark of the Lord was
taken from them: God I hope will not only continue but augment your Glory, and
the Glory of our Country, by making you to be instrumental for his: may your
days be many, and your death Glorious; may it be with you as it was with David
and your Honorable Grandfather, may you die in a good old Age, full of days,
riches and honor, and your Son succeed you, so prays

Your Honors devoted servant, JOHN NEWTON.

TO THE READER,
I Have but lately under the Title of School pastime presented thee with the
Rudiments of Grammar for our own tongue, as the first part of an English
Academy; and lo here according to what was promised in that little book thou
have the second also, which is a short treatise of Arithmetic; and for my thus
doing two things may possibly be demanded of me, or objected against me: first,
what need there was of any new Treatise of this kind, there being such great
variety thereof already: and secondly, why I place it next to Grammar, since
the Liberal Sciences are usually reckoned up in another order?

To which I answer, that among all those English Treatises of Arithmetic,
there is but one that I know of, or do at present remember, viz. Mr. Wingates,
in which the Rules of Arithmetic are propounded in any Logical Method; and
methinks, it is very convenient, if not necessary, that the Rules in every
Science should be Methodically handled; and this I confess is so exactly well
performed in that I but now mentioned, especially in the second Edition
thereof, in the year 1650, that though by reason of the several Fantasies of
several men, something may be altered, there is but little that can be amended;
but the bulk and price is such, that I fear but few parents will be willing to
be at the charge of it, especially for such striplings, as I would have
instructed in this science; for I know no reason, why a young Lad, that can but
read his Psalter, should not be instructed in the Rudiments of Grammar, and the
Art of Arithmetic; and whether this were not a likelier way, to teach them to
spell the words they hear, as well as those they see, and so by consequence,
enable them to write truly as well as read distinctly, than by learning a
Latin Grammar, I leave to thy judgment to determine. Were Children in their
Infancy acquainted with the Art of numbering, there is nothing in that nature
would be difficult to them in their riper years; and that they may be so, I
have in this Treatise, at least as I hope, very plainly as well as briefly and
orderly set down the most useful rules of this necessary and most excellent
Science; and would but our English Schoolmasters put it to the trial, I doubt
not, but that the success would answer all reasonable expectations; for sure
there can be no reason given, why children in these should not be as capable of
this and other Mathematical learning, as in the days of Plato and Aristotle,
when all the Schools in Greece did teach Cihldren these things in the first
place.

And thus you have at once not only the reason, for which I have added this to
those many Treatises of this kind already published, viz. that the memories of
Children may not be over burdened with long directions and tedious discourses,
nor the purses of Parents so over charged, as that the price of the thing
should be any bar to their childrens instruction; but also the reason for which
I place this Science next to Grammar, even this, because it is more suitable to
Childrens capacities, than the other Sciences are, nay will be sooner
understood by them, than all the parts of Grammar can: nor should the Art of
Geometry be severed from Arithmetic, they are of so near a kin, that they
should indeed go hand in hand, and both of them together will make an excellent
introduction to the other Sciences.

And because that the writing of a good hand is as necessary as the other, and
that it is almost as hard a matter to find a Master that is able to teach Youth
the Art of fair writing (I mean in the Country) as of Arithmetic and
Geometry, for the profit of Children, and the ease of Schoolmasters, there is
another little Book of Arithmetic, called, The Country Schoolmaster, which
will be speedily published also; in which the Titles of such Rules of
Arithmetic as children are first to learn, together with brief directions and
examples, are engraved in a fair useful writing hand, as will with the Masters
diligence be sufficient for the teaching of children as well to write fairly,
as to number readily; and because a Child must first learn to write his letters
well, before he be put to joining, there is annexed thereto, a Copy of letters
both great and small, suitable to the other copies, of which thou may have
as many as thou will alone; and upon very reasonable terms: And if the Master
have but so much Geometry, as to teach his children, to erect a perpendicular,
and draw a parallel line, he shall never need to rule a book, or set a Copy,
which will be a wonderful ease to him, and no less profit, and advantage to his
Scholar; for which I pray is best, for the Scholar to rule his own book, or
his Master to do it for him? which is better, for the Master to spend his time
in writing of copies, or directing the child to write according to the Copy he
has? these two books then I would have Children furnished with as soon as they
can but read their Psalter, and hold a pen in their hands; the one to inform
their judgments in the knowledge of the Rules in Arithmetic, and the other to
teach them to write, and to put their knowledge of Arithmetic in practice; and
as they shall profit in these things, so to be set forward in Geometry, and the
other Sciences, for which, god willing, it shall not be long before I furnish
thee with suitable Manuals to that purpose.

THE ART OF Natural Arithmetic.
CHAP. I. Of Notation.
1. ARITHMETIC, is the Art of Accounting by Number.

2. There are three kinds of it. 1. Natural. 2. Symbolical. 3. Artificial.

3. Natural Arithmetic, which is the subject of this present discourse, is
either Positive or Negative.

4. Positive Arithmetic, is either Single or Comparative.

5. Single is that, which is wrought by numbers considered alone, without
relation to one another.

6. The parts of single Arithmetic are Notation and Numeration.

7. Notation is the writing down of any sum to be expressed, or the
expressing of any sum set down in writing.

8. The parts of Notation are two; The first does explain the general value of
the Notes, by which numbers are to be expressed.

9. The Notes or Characters by which Numbers are ordinarily expressed, are
these; 1. one. 2. two. 3. three. 4. four. 5. five. 6. six. 7. seven. 8. eight.
9. nine. 0. nothing.

10. These Notes are either significant Figures or a Cipher.

11. The significant figures are the first nine, viz. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9. and these have a certain signification when they are put by themselves, but
any of these being joined with it self or any of the rest does become uncertain
in it is signification; for every of these figures alone does signify it self
once, but if two of them be set together, the first does signify it self once,
the second does signify it self ten times, as in 22 the same figure which in
the first place toward the right hand does signify only two, does in the
second place signify ten times two, that is twenty.

12. The Cipher does indeed signify nothing of it self, but being set before
or after the rest, it does increase or lessen their value.

13. The Value of these Notes is more fully expressed by Degrees and Periods.

14. The Degrees are three; The first, is the first place of a number toward
the right hand, and does signify it self once, The second degree, is the
second place toward the right hand, and does signify it self ten times. The
third is the third place toward the right hand, and does signify one hundred
times it self, so these figures 345 do signify three hundred forty five.

15. A Period if it be perfect does consist of three degrees, if imperfect it
does consist of fewer: and it is either simple or compound. A simple period if
it be perfect does consist of three degrees; a compounded Period, may have all
the Periods perfect, or the last toward the left hand may be imperfect. Thus
325 is a simple perfect period, and 325 678 is a perfect compound period, or a
number consisting of two perfect periods; 23 is an imperfect simple period, and
23 456 is an imperfect compounded period.

16. The second part of Notation, teaches how to read a number that is
expressed in writing.

17. Every number is either simple or mixed.

18. A simple number is that, whose parts are of one and the same kind, that
is, either whole or broken.

19. A whole number is that, which does consist of integers or entire unities;
thus 36 is composed of thirty six integers, or entire unities.

20. Integers of one simple period, are to be read, as has been showed in the
14 Rule: and integers which are composed of diverse periods, are to be read much
after the same manner, the periods being first distinguished from one another,
by interposing a short stroke or point between each period, as, 15. 246. 368;
whence 15 is an imperfect period, 246 and 368 are perfect periods. This or any
other number thus distinguished into periods, may easily be read, by giving to
every period its proper denomination.

21. The proper denomination of the first period is Hundreds. 2. Thousands. 3.
Millions. 4* Thousands of Millions, and so forward increasing by a tenfold
proportion as far as you please, but in ordinary practice, we seldom have
occasion for the fourth period; the reading whereof will be best learned by
young beginners, if they be first exercised in the reading of three or four
figures, which being well understood the rest cannot be difficult; as by the
Table following, if well considered, it will be manifest.

Thousands of Millions Millions Thousands Hundreds C X I C X I C X I C X I 9 9
8 9 8 7 9 8 7 6 9 8 7 6 5 9 8 7 6 5 4 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 9 8 7 6 5 4
3 2 1 5 6 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 3 9

22. According to this Table, the fourth number 9. 876 is thus to be expressed,
Nine thousand, eight hundred, seventy six, and the last number 569. 876. 543.
239. thus; Five hundred sixty nine Thousands of Millions, eight hundred seventy
six Millions, five hundred forty three thousand, two hundred thirty nine, and
so of any other.

CHAP. II. Of Addition.
1. HItherto we have treated of Notation, Numeration follows.

Numeration is that which by certain known numbers propounded, discovers
another number unknown.

2. Numeration has four species, viz. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication
and Division. In which besides the nine Figures and a Cipher, I shall for the
avoiding of many words, make use of these Characters. (+) (-) (=) (x)

3. This Character (+) I use to represent these words more by, and is the sign
of addition or affirmation; as 3 + 5 signifies 3 more by 5, or 5 added to 3, or
the sum of 3 and 5 that is 8.

4. This Character (-) denotes the words less by, and is the sign of
Subtraction or Negation; As 9 - 3 does signify 9 less by 3, or 3 Subtracted
from 9, or the difference between 9 and 3 that is 6.

5. This Character (=) represents the words equal to, and is the note of an
(...)* so 6 + 3 = 9 are to be read thus, 6 more by 3 is equal to 9.

6. This Character (x) represents the words multiplied by, as 7 x 6 are thus to
be read, 7 multiplied by 6, or the product of 7 and 6.

7. Addition is that, by which diverse numbers are added together, to the end
that the sum or total may be discovered.

8. Numbers to be added are either simple, as 1. 2. 3. and the rest which may
be expressed with one note or figure; or else they are compounded, as 10. 11.
13. 234. which cannot be expressed without two or more figures.

9. The Addition of simple numbers is to be learned by practice rather than
precept; as one added to one makes two, two and three make five and so of the
rest; this is so well known even to children, as that it needs no further
explication, but yet for Demonstration sake, and to prevent mistakes in the
adding of greater sums, I have here exhibited a short Table declaring the sum
of all simple Numbers,

1 1 2 1 2 3 1 3 4 1 4 5 1 5 6 1 6 7 1 7 8 1 8 9 1 9 10 2 2 4 2 3 5 2 4 6 2 5 7
2 6 8 2 ^ ^ 2 8 10 2 9 11 3 3 6 3 4 7 3 5 8 3 6 9 3 7 10 3 8 11 3 9 12 4 4 8 4
5 9 4 6 10 4 7 11 4 8 12 4 9 13 5 5 10 5 6 11 5 7 12 5 8 13 5 9 14 6 6 12 6 7
13 6 8 14 6 9 15 7 7 14 7 8 15 7 9 16 8 8 16 8 9 17 9 9 18

This Table does consist of two columns, in the first are the two simple
numbers to be added, and in the second, the sum or total of those numbers, as
if 5 and 7 were to be added, right against 5 and 7 in the first column, I find
12 in the second column for the sum of them.

4. The Addition of composite numbers is something more difficult, and yet it
does depend upon the addition of simple numbers. But that this may be the more
commodiously done, the numbers to be added must be so set down, that the unites
may stand under the unites, the tens under the tens, and the hundreds under the
hundreds, etc. as if the numbers 52364 + 36512 were given to be added, you are
to place them as in the Margin. ^


5. Having thus placed the numbers draw a line under them, and then add them
together, beginning with the unites first, saying 2 + 4 = 6 which I subscribe
in the place of unites under the line, and 1 + 6 = 7 which I subscribe in the
place of tens, 5 + 3 = 8 which I subscribe in the place of hundreds, and so 6 +
2 = 8 and 3 + 5 = 8 which being subscribed in their respective places, the
total sum is 88. 876.

6. But it frequently happens that the several sums of the particular ranks
are too great to be expressed with one figure, when this happens write down the
first figure of the sum in it is own proper place, and the other figure in the
next place above it, and so in the next rank as often as need shall require, as
in the example following.

In which the sum of the figures in the unites place is 25, ^
therefore writing down 5 in the place of unites, and the figure two which may
be said to signify 20 or two decades, I set in the next place above it, that
is in the place of tens.

In like manner the sum of the decades is 20, and therefore writing 0 in the
rank of tens, the 2 which signifies 20 decades or 200 I set in the place of
hundreds, and so the rest in their order; and adding the two last ranks
together, the total sum is 2. 278. 825.

7. But this work which for plainness sake is thus set down, may be more
briefly performed, if beginning with unites, the last figure of the sum be
only set down, and the other kept in mind, and numbered in the next rank, in
this manner, because in the rank of unites 8 + 9 = 17, 17 + 6 = 23. ^
23 + 7 = 30. 30 + 4 = 34, subscribing 4, the other 3 being kept in memory, I
presently add to the next rank thus, 3 + 3 = 6. 6 + 8 14. 14 + 1 = 15. 15 + 6
= 21. 21 + 5 = 26, subscribing 6 I carry 2 to the next rank, saying, 2 + 6 = 8.
8 + 7 = 15. 15 + 4 = 19. 19 + 5 = 24. 24 + 7 = 31 subscribing 1 I carry 3 to
the next rank 3 + 2 = 5. 5 + 3 = 8. 8 + 6 = 14. 14 + 9 = 23. and 23 + 4 = 27
subscribing 7 I carry to the next rank, saying, 2 + 7 = 9. 9 + 1 = 10. 10 + 5 =
15. 15 + 8 = 23. 23 + 3 = 26 subscribing 6 I carry 2 to the next rank, saying,
2 + 4 = 6. 6 + 5 = 11. 11 + 8 = 19. 19 + 7 = 26. 26 + 6 = 32 subscribing 2, the
other 3 I set in the next rank, because there is nothing more to be added, and
so the total sum is, 3267163.

The proof of Addition is thus, draw a line under the first rank of numbers,
then add together all the remaining ranks, as has been showed; Lastly, to
that total add the first rank of numbers: if that be the same with the first
total found, the Addition is true, otherwise not.

As in the last example, the first rank of numbers is, 472638, and the total of
the other four ranks, is, 2794526, to which the first rank being added, the
total will be 3267164, as may be before found, therefore the first rank was
true. The like may be done in any other.

CHAP. III. Of Subtraction.
1. SUBTRACTION is that, by which one number is taken out of another which is
greater or at least equal to the former, that the residue or remainer may be
known.

2. The Subtraction of simple numbers is so easy, that every one is supposed
to know that, either naturally or by daily practice; but if this also shall in
any case be thought necessary, it may be readily performed by the former table,
as if 2 were to be Subtracted out of 9, looking in the former table for 2 in
the first column, and 9 in the second, the number between them is 7 which is
the remainer sought.

3. But where one composite number is to be Subtracted from another or a simple
number from a composite, the two numbers given must be written one under
another, the lesser under the greater, as was directed in Addition, that is,
the unites under the unites, and the tens under the tens, etc. So the numbers
678945 and 543214 being given to be subtracted the one out of the ^
other, they must be placed as in the Margin; then proceeding to the
subtraction, I say 5 - 4 = 1 which I place in the same rank under the line; In
like manner 4 - 1 = 3 which I likewise set under the line in the next rank, and
thus finishing the whole operation, the remainer of 678945 - 543214 is 135731.
As in the Example.

4. When any of the figures of the number given to be subtracted is greater
than the figure, out of which it is to be subtracted, you must borrow one of
the next rank toward the left hand, and then the figure of which they are so
borrowed must afterward be esteemed an unite less, or, which is all one, the
figure to be subtracted from it, must be supposed an unite greater, and the one
which is borrowed may if you please for memory sake be set between two little
lines. ^


So the numbers 730582 and 51368 being given to be subtracted, the last from
the former and placed as before; I am to deduct 8 out of 2 which cannot be,
borrowing therefore one decade from the following figure, (which is equal to 10
unites) the 2 is made 12 and 12 - 8 = 4 which I set down under the unites, and
the one which I borrowed under the tenths between the lines. And then, saying,
1 + 6 = 7 and 8 - 7 = 1 which I set down in the place of tens; and then 5 - 3 =
2 which I set in the place of hundreds, and then 1 out of 0 I cannot but
borrowing one from the next rank 10 - 1 = 9 which I set in the place of
thousands, and the 1 which I borrowed under the next rank between the lines,
and then, saying, 1 + 5 = 6, but 6 from 3 I cannot, therefore borrowing 1 as
before, it is 10 + 3 = 13, and 13 - 6 = 7; lastly 7 - 1 (which was borrowed) =
6 and so the remainer is 679214 = 730582 - 51368.

CHAP. IV. Of Multiplication.
1. MULTIPLICATION, is that by which we multiply two numbers, by one another,
that their product may be discovered.

2. Multiplication has three parts, the Multiplicand, the Multiplicator and
the Product.

3. The Multiplicand is the number given to be multiplied. The Multiplicator is
the number by which the Multiplicand is multiplied, and the Product is the
number produced by the Multiplication: So if 7 be given to be multipled by 4,
the third number which is produced is 28, for 4 times 7 is 28; and here 7 is
the Multiplicand, 4 the Multiplicator, and 28 the Product.

4. Multiplication is single or compound.

5. Single Multiplication, is when the Multiplicand and Multiplicator do each
consist of single figures, and this is either to be performed by memory, or to
be performed by many additions, till use and practice has made it familiar;
but for a help to memory in this particular, the Multiplication of simple
numbers may be conceived by this Theoreme.

6. If one of the two numbers given shall be divided into as many parts as you
please, the Product of both numbers, shall be equal to all the Products made by
one of the numbers and all the parts of the other. As for the small numbers, as
how much 2 times 4, 4 times 5, or 3 times 6, even nature it self does teach
unto children. But if thou be not so ready in the greater notes, thou may by
this means make it familiar. As if the Product of 7 times 8 were required,
divide one of them into what parts you please, as 7 into 2. 3. 2. if 8 be
multiplied by these parts, the sum of the several products will be 56. And so
for 8 times 9 divide 9 into 3. 3. 3* and multiply 8 by these parts, the sum
of the products shall be 72: and so of any other. ^

7. The memory* may be also helped in the multiplication of simple numbers in
this manner. If two numbers be propounded, which together are more than 10, if
you multiply both their differences from 10, and also deduct either difference
from the other number, the product and remainer set in diverse degrees, shall
be the product of the given numbers. As in these Examples.

^By either of these ways the product of single figures may be attained, but
for the greater ease of young beginers, we have also added this table, in which
the product of all the single figures is expressed; the numbers to be multiplied
are set in the first column, and the product in the second, as 7 and 8 being
given, right against those numbers is 56 which is the product of them.

The Multiplication Table
2.2 4 2.3 6 2.4 8 2.5 10 2.6 12 2.7 14 2.8 16 2.9 18 3.3 9 3.4 12 3.5 15 3.6
18 3.7 21 3.8 24 3.9 27 4.4 16 4.5 20 4.6 24 4.7 28 4.8 32 4.9 36 5.5 25 5.6 30
5.7 35 5.8 40 5.9 45 6.6 36 6.7 42 6.8 48 6.9 54 7.7 49 7.8 56 7.9 63 8.8 64
8.9 72 9.9 81

8. The Multiplication of single figures being thus attained, the
Multiplication of compounded numbers cannot be difficult.

9. In Compound Multiplication, set down the given numbers, as in Addition and
Subtraction* so 3421 being given to be multiplied by 2, place 2 the
Multiplicator under 3421 the Multiplicand, and having drawn a line, write ^
the double of every figure in the Multiplicand under the line (because the
Multiplicator is 2*) in the same degree always with that figure of which it is
the double. Thus the double of one is 2, the double of 2 is 4, the double of 4
in the place of hundreds is 8, and the double of 3 in the place of thousands is
6 and the product of 3421 multiplied by 2 is 6842.

10. When the product of any of the particular figures exceeds ten, place the
excess under the line as before, and the last figure in the next place to it,
but a line lower, and so the rest until the multiplication be finished; as if
the same number 3421 were to be multiplied by 8. every figure of the
multiplicand is to be made 8 times as much as it is, and subscribed in their
proper places, and then to be collected into one sum. Thus 8 times 1 is 8,
which I place under the 1. and 8 times 2 is 16, I write 6 in the place of tens
a line lower, and 1 in the upper line, in the place of hundreds, 8 times 4 is
32, I write 2 in the lower line in the place of hundreds, and 3 in the upper
line a place forwarder, that is in the place of thousands, 8 times 3 is 24
thousands, I write 4 therefore in the place of thousands in the lower line, and
2 a place forwarder, in the upper or the lower line it matters not which,
because it is the last ^
figure in the product. And these two lines of numbers being added together,
the sum is, 27368=3421 x 8.

11. But this may be more compendiously performed, if that every figure to be
set in the upper line shall be committed to memory and added to the next rank.
So 3421 being given to be multiplied by 8 as before: for 8 times 1 I write 8
under the line in the place of unites: for 8 times 2 being 16 I write 6 under
the line in the place of tens, and reserve 1 for the ten it exceeds to be added
in the next rank, the place of hundreds. Then I say 8 times 4 is 32, unto which
if I add 1 which I kept in mind the whole is 33, wherefore subscribing 3 in
the next rank under the line in the place of hundreds, and carrying 3 in mind
for the three ^
tens that it exceeds, I proceed to perform the rest of the work, as you see it
in the Example.

12. When the Multiplicand and the Multiplicator are both compounded numbers,
for so many figures as are in the Multiplicator, so many several products must
be subscribed under the line which at last being added into one sum* gives
you the total product of all: so 3421 being given to be multiplied by 28, the
operation will stand thus.

For 3421 being multiplied ^
by 8 the product is 27368: again 342 I being multiplied by 2 the product is
6842, which several products standing in their due order and added together do
make 95788 the product required.

13. When in the Multiplicator there are Ciphers between the significant
figures, you must multiply by the significant figures only, neglecting the
Ciphers, and set each particular product in its due place, according to what
has been said in the last rule, and as is done in these examples following. ^

14. When the numbers given to be multiplied do one or both of them end with
Ciphers, neglecting the Cyhers, multiply by the significant figures only, and
having added together the several products according to the former directions,
annex as many Ciphers to the sum of all the products, as were at the end of
both the numbers given, so shall you have the product desired as in the
examples following. ^

15. When one of the Numbers given is an unite with nothing but Ciphers
annexed, the Multiplication is performed by annexing so many Ciphers to the
Multiplicand, as there are in the Multiplicator; so if 4327 were to be
multiplied by 1000, the product will be 4327000.

CHAP. V. Of Division.
1. DIVISION is that, by which we discover how often one Number is contained in
another, and thereby find the Quotient of the greater Number.

2. Division has three parts, the Dividend, the Divisor and the Quotient. The
Dividend is the Number given to be divided; The Divisor is the Number by which
the Dividend is divided; and the Quotient is the Number which the Division does
produce: So if 18 were given to be divided by 3, the Number produced would be
6, for 3 is found 6 times in 18, and here 18 is the Dividend, 3 the Divisor,
and 6 the Quotient.

3. Division is either single or compound. When the Divisor is a single figure,
and the Dividend less than 10 the answer may be given by memory; or if the
Dividend be the product of two single figures, the answer may be had from the
multiplication table if need be; for finding the Divisor in the first Column
and the Dividend in the second, the other figure in the first Column is the
Quotient sought; as if 56 were to be divided by 7, in the same line where I
find 7 in the first Column, and 56 in the second, I find 8 also, which is the
Quotient.

4. When the Divisor is a single figure, and the Dividend a Number of many
places, make a crooked line at each end of the Dividend, that on the left hand
serving for the place of the divisor, and that on the right, for the Quotient;
then proceed gradually, and ask how often the divisor is contained in the
Dividend, and place that which answers the question in the Quotient, then
multiply the Divisor by that figure in the Quotient, and substract the product
from the dividend, setting down the remainer. For example, let 2916 be given to
be divided by 4. placing the numbers as has been said; I ask how often 4 is
contained in 29, the answer is 7 times I therefore put 7 in the ^
Quotient, then I multiply 4 by 7 and it makes 28 which being subtracted from
29 the remainer is 1. Then drawing a stroke between the remainer and the
Dividend I draw down the next figure which is 1 also, and so the new Dividend
is 11, then I ask how often 4 is contained in 11, the answer is twice,
therefore I put 2 in the Quotient, and 4 multiplied by 2 makes 8 which being
deducted from 11 the remainer is 3 which I write under 11 and draw a stroke
between them as before, and draw down the next figure which is 6, and so the
new divided is ^^. Then I ask how often 4 is contained in 36 the answer is 9
times, therefore I place 9 in the Quotient, and 4 multiplied by 9 the product
is ^^, which b^^ng deducted from ^6 the remainer is 0* and therefore the
division is (...) and the Quotient required, is (...)

5. When the Divisor is also a composite Number, though the work be somewhat
more troublesome, yet is the manner of working the same with the former; and
therefore the former example well considered, will make way for that which
follows. Let then 6639642 be a Number given to be divided by 978, and being set
down as is before directed, distinguish by a point so many of the foremost
places of the Dividend toward the left hand as are either equal to the
Divisor, or being greater do yet come nearest to it, which in this Example ^
must be under 9 for 6639 is the least number in this Dividend, from whence 978
can be subtracted. Now therefore I demand how often 978 is contained in 6639*
and since to answer this and the like question some trial must be made, write
the Divisor in a place by it self, and the product thereof by all the nine
figures in this manner.

First, write down the Divisor it self 978 and draw a line on the right hand
thereof, and on the right hand of the line right against the Divisor write 1.
then underneath the divisor write the double thereof which is 1956, and right
against the said double on the other side of the line under 1. write 2. Then
add the Divisor 978 to 1956 the double thereof and their sum 2934, is the
triple of the Divisor, which must be placed under the double, and 3 right
against on the other side of the line; then add the Divisor 978 to 2934 their
sum 3912 must be put under the triple, and so proceed till you have nine
ranks of numbers showing the product of your divisor by all the 9 figures, and
to prove your work, add the ninth and last number to the first, so will their
sum be ten times the Divisor, if the work be true, thus 978 + 8802=9780.

A Table exhibiting the several products of your Divisor by all the 9 digits
being thus prepared; an answer to the former question may be easily found, for
in that table you may see that the nearest less to 6639 is 5868 and the figure
right against it on the other side the line is 6, therefore I place 6 in the
quotient and the product of 978 by 6, that is 5868 I write under 6639 and
subtract the said product from it, so is the ^ 978 1 1956 2 2934 3 3912 4 4890
5 5868 6 6846 7 7824 8 8802 9 remainer 771. Then deducting 6846=978x7 from
7716, and 7824=978x8 from 8704 and 8802=978x9 from 8802 the Quotient will be
6789, and the remainer nothing.

This method being practiced a while, you may at length shorten the work of the
table in this manner. Having doubled the Divisor, as before, and so got the
product thereof by 2, double that double, so shall you have the product by 4,
and the product of 4 being doubled will give you the product by 8, and then the
table 978 1 1956 2 3912 4 7824 8
will be as here you see it; from whence all the other products may be easily
had; for the first and second is 2934 the product by 3, and 1956 + 3912=5868
the product by 6, the sum of the first and third is 4890 the product by 5,
the sum of the first second and third is 6846 the product by 7, the first and
fourth is 8802 the product by 9, and by using this contraction but a while, you
will at last be able to divide any sum without the help of any such table,
and use as few figures as in any other method that I yet know to be made
public.

6. When the Divisor has one or more Ciphers after the significant figures,
the work is to be performed by the significant figures only, cutting off so
many figures from the Dividend as there are Ciphers at the end of the Divisor,
and after the division is finished annex the figures so cut off to the remainer
of the Dividend.

7. When the Divisor is an unite with Ciphers, the Division is performed by
cutting off with a line so many figures of the Dividend toward the right hand,
as there are Ciphers in the Divisor, the rest of the figures in the Dividend
toward the left hand is the Quotient sought.

CHAP. VI. Of the Notation of Fractions.
1. THe same parts of Arithmetic which have been wrought in whole numbers may
also be performed in broken numbers, otherwise called parts or fractions, but
first it will be necessary to show what is meant or intended by the word
fraction or fractions, and then proceed to their Notation and Numeration.

2. Fractions or broken numbers, are not so properly called numbers as
fragments of unity, f^r although an unite is the least number, yet this one
may be supposed to be divided, sometimes into more sometimes into fewer equal
parts as the thing shall require.

3. And as the equal parts of an unite may be sometimes more, sometimes fewer,
so have those parts sometimes one Denomination sometimes another; so that if an
unite be supposed to be divided into two equal parts, one of those parts is
called half, if into 3, one of those parts is called a third, if into 4, a
fourth, if into six a sixth, if into eight, an eighth, if into ten, a tenth,
and so of others. And in writing of fractions, this Denomination is expressed,
by writing such a figure under a little line as is proper to them. And the
number of parts supposed to be taken are expressed by another figure above the
line, thus a 2 above the line and a 3 under it do express two thirds. A 3 set
above the line and a 4 under it, do express three fourths, and so of any other.

4. A fraction then is to be written with two numbers* of which the lowermost
is called the Denominator, because it does denominate the parts, and limits or
determines how many parts are to be numbered, and the upper number, is called
the Numerator, because this does number the parts, or show how many of those
parts are to be taken.

5. A number of parts then being propounded to be set down in writing, as the
one half of a yard, or three fourths of a foot, they are to be written thus in
which 1. 3. are the numerators, and 2. 4. the denominators.

6. A broken number is either proper or improper.

7. A proper broken number, is that, whose numerator is less than the
Denominator: such as are these 6/^2 5/^^.

8. A proper broken number is either single or compound.

9. A single broken number is that which consists of one numerator, and one
Denominator: such as are 6/^1 5/1^ and the like.

10. A compound broken number (otherwise called a fraction of a fraction) is
that which has more numerators and more Denominators than one, which kind of
broken numbers are commonly set down with the particle of between them, as five
twelfths of one third is to be written thus 5/12 of 1/^^, three fourths of
seven eighths thus of 7/^ and so of any other.

11. The things to be expressed by broken numbers are chiefly the parts or
fractions of money, weight, measure, time, motion, and things accounted by the
Dozen. Of the three first of these there are infinite kinds and varieties
according to the Laws and Customs of particular Countries; those used in this
kingdom are most proper for us to know, and the knowledge of them will be
sufficient to direct us in the use of those in foreign nations, if at any time
there be an occasion for them.

12. The several pieces of Coin or Denominations of money used in England in
reference to account, are pounds, shillings, pence and farthings, whose
particular values are as follows.

4. Farthings make 1. Penny. 12. Pence make 1. Shilling. 20. Shillings make 1.
pound Sterling.
And according to these values, a pound Sterling is esteemed an integer, and
may be divided into 20 parts called shillings, and therefore one shilling is a
broken number of a pound Sterling, and by the former directions is to be
written thus 1/^^ l. that is one twentieth of a pound. Again a shilling may be
divided into twelve equal parts called pence, and so one penny is a fraction of
a shilling, and is to be written thus ^/12 s. that is one twelfth of a
shilling. Lastly, a penny may be divided into four equal parts called
farthings, and so one farthing is a fraction of a penny, and written thus d.
that is one fourth of a penny, or thus of 1/12 s. that is one fourth of one
twelfth of a shilling, or thus of 1/12 of 1/20 l. that is one fourth of one
twelfth of one twentieth of a pound Sterling.

13. Now then though the true and natural way of expressing broken numbers is
by their Numerators and Denominators, as has been showed, yet the broken
numbers or known parts of money, weights, measures and such like, are for more
convenient operation, commonly expressed like integers: so that if 12 shillings
seven pence half penny farthing were to be expressed in figures, the ordinary
and most usual way is thus, 12s-07d, 03 f. but the said twelve shillings seven
pence half penny farthing, being distinctly considered as fractions of a pound
Sterling, the way to write them properly is thus,

12 Shillings, are twelve twentieths of a pound Sterling, and written thus,
12/2^ l.

7 Pence are seven twelfths of one twentieth of a pound Sterling, and written
thus 7/12 of 1/20 l.

3 Farthings are three fourths of one twelfth of one twentieth of a pound and
written thus of 1/12 of 1/20 l.

14. The weights used in England are of two sorts, Troy weight and Averdupois.

15. The several pieces or Denominations of Troy weight, are pounds, ounces,
penny weights and grains, whose particular values are as follows.

24 Grains make 1 Penny weight. 20 Penny weight make 1 Ounce 12 Ounces make 1
Pound Troy.
16. The weights used by Apothecaries are derived from a pound Troy, the which
is subdivided as in the following Table.

lb A pound Troy is equal to 12 Ounces. An Ounce is equal to 8 Drams. A Dram is
equal to 3 Scruples. A Scruple is equal to 20 Grains.
17. But besides Troy weight, there is another kind of weight used in England
called Averdupois weight, a pound whereof is equal unto 14 ounces, and
twelve-peny weight Troy.

18. This Averdupois weight is either great or small.

19. The great Averdupois weight is, when an hundred consisting of 112 pounds
Averdupois is the integer, and subdivided into halves and quarters, each
quarter conte^ning 28 pounds.

20. The small Averdupois weight is, when a pound is the integer, each pound
being subdivided into 16 ounces, each ounce into 16 drams and each dram into 4
quarters, and because many persons have occasion to use both, and are perhaps
furnished but with one, I have here exhibited a Table for the speedy converting
of the parts of a pound Troy, into the parts of a pound Averdupois, and the
Contrary.

Drams Averdupois. Peny-weights Troy. Grains. Decimals of a grain. Ounces

12 15 17 02 625 15 13 13 18 16 18 06 000 16 14 12 00

21. The measures used in England are of two sorts, Capacity or Length.

22. The measures of Capacity are produced from weight, and are also of two
sorts liquid or dry.

23. The liquid measures are those, in which all kind of liquid substances are
measured, and are expressed in the table following.

1 Pound of wheat Troy weight make 1 Pint. 2 Pints make 1 Quart. 2 Quarts make
1 Pottle 2 Pottles make 1 Gallon. 8 Gallons make 1 Firkin of Ale, Soap,
Herring. 9 Gallons make 1 Firkin of Beer. 10 Gallons make 1 Firking of Salmon
or Eels. 2 Firkins make 1 Kilderkin. 2 Kilderkins make 1 Barrel. 42 Gallons
make 1 Tierce of Wine. 63 Gallons make 1 Hogshead. 2 Hogsheads make 1 Pipe or
But. 2 Pipes or Buts make 1 Tau of wine.
24. Dry measures are those in which all kind of dry substances are measured,
as grain, Sea-coal, Salt and such like, and are expressed in the table
following.

1 Pint make 1 Pint. 2 Pints make 1 Quart. 2 Quarts make 1 Pottle. 2 Pottles
make 1 Gallon. 2 Gallons make 1 Peck. 4 Pecks make 1 Bushel land measure. 5
Pecks make 1 Bushel water measure. 8 Bushels make 1 Quarter. 4 Quarters make 1
Chalder. 5 Quarters make 1 Wey.
25. Long measures are as follows.

3 Barley Corns in length make 1 Inch. 12 Inches make 1 Foot. 3 Foot make 1
Yard. 3 Foot 9 Inches make 1 Ell. 6 Foot make 1 Fathom. 5 Yards and make 1 Pole
or Perch. 40 Poles make 1 Furlong. 8 Furlongs make 1 English Mile.
26. In superficial or square measure 40 square poles or perches make 1 Rood or
quarter of an Acre, and 4 Roods an Acre.

27. A Table of Time, is this that follows.

1 Minute make 1 Minute. 60 Minutes make 1 Hour. 24 Hours make 1 Day. 7 Days
make 1 Week. 4 Weeks make 1 Month of 28 Days. 13 Months 1 Day and 6 hours
make 1 Year, not exactly, but very near.
28. A year is that space of time in which the Sun does finish course through
the circle in the heavens called the Zodiac, which is in 365 days, 5 hours, 4
min.

29. The Zodiac by is Astronomers divided, or supposed to be, into twelve
equal parts called signs, whose names and Characters are these, Aries,.
Taurus,. Gemini,. Cancer,. Leo,. Virgo,. Libra,. Scorpio,. Sagittarius,.
Capricornus,. Aquarius,. Pisces,. And each of these signs into 30 parts called
Degrees, so that this and all other Circles are supposed to be divided into 12
times 30 parts or Degrees, that is into 360, each degree into 60 minutes* each
minute into 60 seconds, each second into 60 thirds, etc.

30. Of things accounted by the Dozen, A gross is the Integer consisting of 12
dozen, and each dozen of twelve particulars,

31. An improper fraction or broken number is that, whose numeration is greater
than the Denominator. As 54/12 feet, that is, fifty and four twelfths of a
foot; and this may be well called an improper fraction, seeing it will not
admit of the definition of a true broken number* because it is greater than
that whole, whereas a fraction is properly but a part of the whole.

32. A mixed number* is that, which besides the integers or entire unities of
which it consists, has also a broken number annexed: As in this improper
fraction 54/12 if you divide the numerator 54 by the denominator 12 it will be
reduced into the mixed number 4 6/12 of which 4 is the whole part, and 6/12 the
broken number or fraction.

33. And this I hope is sufficient to show what is meant by a fraction, and how
all fractions whether proper or improper* are to be expressed and read, which
is the Notation of them; the next thing propounded concerning fractions is
their Numeration, whether such fractions be expressed by their true and natural
way, that is by their Numerators and Denominators, or whether they be expressed
like integers, as the known parts of money are expressed by pounds, shillings,
pence and farthings, and the known parts of Troy weight by pounds, ounces,
pennyweights and grains; of these and the like broken numbers which are
expressed like integers we speak of first.

CHAP. VII. Of the Numeration of such broken numbers as are expressed like
integers.
1. NUmeration of such as are expressed like integers, is twofold.

2. Accidental and Essential.

3. Accidental Numeration is otherwise called Reduction.

4. Reduction is either descending or ascending.

5. Reduction descending is when a number of a greater Denomination being
given, it is required to find how many of a lesser Denomination are equal in
value to that given number of the greater: as when it is required to find how
many shillings are contained in 34 pounds; or how many pence in 325 shillings,
or how many hours in 365 days.

6. Reduction descending is performed by Multiplication, for if the given
number of integers of a greater denomination, be multiplied by the number of
integers, contained in the next inferior denomination, the product shall show
how many of that inferior denomination, are contained in the integers of the
greater denomination given; for example, let 34 pounds be the greater
denomination given, and let it be required to show how many shillings are in 34
pounds, shillings being the next inferior denomination unto pounds, and that
every pound does contein 20 shillings, as has been showed, if you multiply 34
by 20 the product is 680; the number of shillings required. ^
In like manner 680 shillings will be reduced into 8160 pence, if you multiply
680 by 12 the number of pence in a shilling; and 8160 pence will be reduced
into farthings 32640, if you multiply 8160 by 4 the number of farthings in a
penny.

The like method is to be observed in weights and measures or any thing else
that is or may be subdivided, into inferior denominations; thus, 26 pound Troy
will ^
be reduced into 312 ounces, and 312 ounounces into 6240 penny weights, and
6240 penny weights into 149760 grains, as by the operation in the margin it
does appear.

And in this manner may any number of a greater denomination given, be reduced
into the least denomination, into which the greater is supposed to be
subdivided.

Reduction ascending is, when a number of a lesser denomination being given, it
is required to find how many of a greater denomination are equal in value to
that given number of the lesser; as when it is required to find how many pence
are contained 32640 farthings, or how many shillings in 8160 pence, or how many
days in 8760 hours.

And this kind of Reduction, called Reduction ascending, is performed by
Division; for if the number of integers given be divided by the number of
integers in the next superior or greater denomination, the quotient shall be
the number of integers sought; so 32640 farthings being divided by 4, the
number of farthings in a penny, the quotient is 8160 the number of pence
contained in 32640 farthings: In like manner if 8160 pence be divided by 12 ^
the number of pence in a shilling, the quotient will be 680, the number of
shillings in 8160 pence; and lastly, if 680 shillings be divided by 20 the
number of shillings in a pound, the quotient will be 34, the number of pounds
in 680 shillings; the like may be done by any other integers of any known
denomination given.

CHAP. VIII. Of the Addition of numbers that are of diverse Denominations.
1. ACcidental Numeration of such broken numbers as are expressed like
integers, has been showed; that which is essential now follows.

2. Essential Numeration does consist of Addition, Subduction, Multiplication
and Division.

3. When the numbers propounded to be added are of diverse denominations, you
must begin with the least denomination first, and set down their sum under that
inferior denomination, if their sum be fewer than the number of parts in the
next greater denomination; but if their sum be more than the number of parts in
the next greater denomination, set down the excess; if equal set down a Cipher;
and the rest must be added to the next superior denomination, and for memory
sake it may be set down under that denomination to which it is to be added; as
in the example following.

l s d f 24 13 05 3 07 19 04 0 16 08 07 2 2 1 1 49 1 5 1
In which I begin with the farthings first, and say 3 + 2 = 5 that is one penny
and a farthing, wherefore setting 1 down under the denomination of farthings I
carry a penny to the denomination of pence, and say 1 + 7 = 8, and 8 + 4 = 12,
and 12 + 5 = 17 pence, that is 1 shilling and 5 pence, wherefore I set down 5
in the lowest rank under the denomination of pence and 1 in the line above it
under the denomination of shillings, and say 1 + 8 = 9, and 9 + 19 = 28, and 28
+ 13 = 41, that is 2 pounds 1 shilling, wherefore I set ^ in the lowest line
under the denomination of shillings and 2 in the line above under the
denomination of pounds, and say 2 + 16 = 18, and 18 + 7 = 25, and 25 + 24 = 49,
which being set down in the lower line under the denomination of pounds, the
total of the three sums propounded is 49 pounds 1 shilling 5 pence and 1
farthing.

More examples of this rule are these following.

CHAP. IX. Of the Subtraction of numbers which are of diverse denominations.
1. WHen the numbers propounded to be subtracted are of diverse denominations,
you must begin with the least denomination first, and when the number to be
subtracted is greater than the number of that denomination from whence it is to
be subtracted you must borrow from the next denomination that is greater, and
you may if you will set down the number of the parts that it does contein of
the next inferior denomination, directly over the number from whence
subtraction is to be made, setting down the remainer in the lowest line under
that denomination, and the one that you borrowed under the next denomination a
line higher to be added thereto again; as for example.

20 12 4 4 03 05 1 2 17 08 3 1 1 1 1 03 8 2
I cannot substract 3 farthings from one farthing, therefore I borrow one from
the next greater denomination that is 1 penny out of 8 pence, and because there
are four farthings in a penny, I set down the number 4 over the next lesser
denomination, that is the denomination of farthings, and then 1 + 4 = 5, and 5
- 3 = 2 which I set in the lower line under the denomination of farthings; and
the one that I borrowed, I set in the line above it under the denomination of
pence, and say 1 + 8 = 9, and 9 out of 5 cannot be, therefore I borrow 1
shilling from the next rank and set down the number of pence contained in a
shilling, that is 12 over the rank of pence, and say 5 + 12 = 17 and 17 - 9 = 8
which I set down in the lower rank under the denomination of pence, and the 1
shilling that I borrowed in the line above it under the denomination of
shillings; then I say 1 + 17 = 18, and 18 out of 3 I cannot take, therefore I
borrow 1 pound from the next rank, and set down the number of shillings
contained in one pound, that is 20 over the rank of shillings and say 3 + 20 =
23 and 23 - 18 = 5 which I set down in the lower line under the denomination of
shillings, and the I pound that I borrowed in the line above it under the
denomination of pounds, and say 1 + 2 = 3, and 4 - 3 = 1, and so 2l. 17 8 3
being deducted from 4l. 03 05 01 the remaner is 0^l. 05 ^8 2.

2. Another way, when the smaller denominations in the sum to be subtracted,
are greater than the like denominations in the sum from whence the Subtraction
is to be made, borrow one from the greatest denomination in the question and
set down the number of parts less one, that one of the greatest denomination
does contein of the next less over that lesser denomination, and so orderly
till come to the least denomination that the greatest can be subdivided in* to,
and there set down the full number of parts and make your Subtraction as that,
so shall you have the remainer sought; so in the former example, because the
lesser denominations of the number to be subtracted are greater than the like
denominations lib. s. d. f. 19 11 4 4 03 05 1 2 17 08 3 1 05 08 2
in the number from whence the subtraction is to be made I borrow 1 from the
greatest denomination in the question, which is the denomination of pounds, and
because one pound does contein 20 shillings, I set 19 over the rank of
shillings, 11 over the rank of pence, and 4 over the rank of farthings, and
then subtracting the lowest line from the two lines of numbers above it the
remainer is 1l. 05 08 2.

More examples of this rule are these following.

CHAP. X. Of the Multiplication of numbers which are of diverse Denominations.
1. WHen a number of diverse Denominations is given to be multiplied by a
number of but one denomination, you must begin first with the least
denomination, and so by degrees ascend to the greatest, adding still to the
greater denomination the integers of the same denomination, which are produced
by the multiplication of the lesser, for example, if a man spend 14 pound 13
shillings 8 pence in one day, what will he spend at that rate in seven days?
The answer is seven times as much, and l. s. d 14 13 08 7 4 4 102 15 08
therefore the expense of one day must be multiplied by 7 in this manner, 8 x 7
= 56, but because 12 d. = 1 s. 56 d. = 4 s. 48 d. and therefore I write 8 d. in
the lowermost line right under the denomination of pence, and the 4 in the line
above it under the denomination of shillings. Then 13 x 7 = 91 to which the 4
being added the sum is 95, but because 20 shillings = 1 pound, therefore 95
shillings = 4 pound 15 shillings, and so I write 15 shillings in the lowermost
line under the rank of shillings, and 4 in the line above it under the rank of
pounds. Lastly 14 x 7 = 98 pounds, to which the 4 pounds being added, the sum
is 102. which being under written as before, the expense of the whole week will
be found to be 102l. 15 s. 8 d.

2. when a number of diverse denominations is given to be multiplied by a
number of one denomination, but greater than can be expressed with one figure,
it will be convenient, that the number of diverse denominations, be reduced
into a number of the least denomination given, before you begin your
multiplication; and after the multiplication is finished, to reduce the product
into the former denominations, if need be; for example, if 283 men were to
receive 28 pound 13 shillings 9 pence a man, how much money must be paid to the
283 men? Before I begin the multiplication I must reduce the 28 pound 13
shillings 9 pence into pence, which according to the rules of reduction given
will be 6885 pence. And then 6885 x 283 = 1948455 as by the work in the margin;
and so many pence ^
are required to pay off the 283 men, and 1948455 pence being reduced into the
former denominations, they will be found equal to 8118 pound 11 shillings and 3
pence.

3. When a numbe^ of diverse denominations is given to be multiplied by another
of diverse denominations also, but denominations of the same kind, it will be
convenient to reduce both the numbers into numbers of the least denomination
given, before you begin your multiplication, and after* your multiplication is
finished to reduce the product into the former denominations given; for
example, let it be required to multiply 2 pound 9 shilling and 6 pence by it
self: Reduction being made according to the former directions, the number of
pence in each number will be 594, and *594 pence being multiplied by 594 pence,
the product will be 352836 square pence, which being divided by 57600 the
number of square pence in a pound, the quotient will be 6 pound 2 shillings 6
pence, and ^/^ of a farthing, as by the operation it does appear. ^

4. Another way in the annexed Diagram, let there be two numbers of three
denominations given, and let A F be the square or rect angle made of the
greatest denomination in both numbers, E K and B G two rect angles made by
multiplying the first denomination by the second, the product being divided by
an integer of the greatest denomination reduced into the parts of the second,
the quotient shall be of the same denomination with the greatest, and the
remainer of the same denomination with the second. F L is the square of the
second denomination, which being divided by an integer of the first or greatest
reduced into the parts of the second, the quotient shall be of the same
denomination with the second; and if there be any remainer it must be
multiplied by a number which in the third denomination is equal to an integer
in the second, the quotient shall* be of the third denomination, and if there
be yet a remainer it must be multiplied by a number which in the fourth
denomination is equal to an integer in the thid, and divided as before, the
quotient shall be of the fourth denomination, and so forward till the remainer
cannot be reduced into lesser terms. And thus you have done with the square or
rect angle A C LH.

CR and H Q are two rect angles made by the multiplication of the sum of the
greatest denomination given, by the sum given which is of the third inferior
denomination, the product shall be of the same denomination with the third, and
therefore if that product be greater than an integer of the second
denomination, reduced into the parts of the third, it must be divided by a
number which in the third denomination is equal to an integer in the second,
the quotient shall be of the second denomination, and the remainer shall be of
the third. G M and K O are two rect angles made by multiplying the sum of the
second denomination by the third, and the product being divided by one of the
integers in the greatest denomination reduced into the parts of the second, the
quotient shall be of the same denomination with the third, and the remainer
must be multiplied by a number which in the fourth denomination is equal to an
integer in the third, the quotient shall be that fourth denomination, and the
remainer shall be the numerator of a fraction, whose denominator is that former
divisor. Lastly L P is the square of the third denomination which must be
divided if it may be by one integer of the greatest denomination, reduced into
the parts of the third, the quotient shall be of a fourth inferior
denomination, and the remainer shall be the numerator of a fraction, whose
denominator is the same divisor.

From this Diagram thus explained, the Multiplication of pounds, shillings and
pence, by pounds, shillings and pence will be plain and easy, for,

1. Pounds multiplied by pounds produce pounds.

2. Pounds multiplied by shillings and the product divided by 20, the quotient
will be pounds, and the remainer shillings.

3. Shillings multiplied by shillings the product will be the numerator of a
fraction, whose denominator is 400 the square of shillings in a pound, the
value of which fraction may be found by multiplying the numerator first by 20,
and dividing the product by 400, the quotient shall be shillings, and the
remainer the fraction of a shilling, which being multiplied by 12 and the
product divided by 400 the quotient shall be pence, and the remainer the
fraction of a penny, which being multiplied by 4 and the product divided by 400
the quotient shall be farthings, and the remainer shall be the fraction of a
farthing. Example, if 19 shillings were given to be multiplied by 19 shillings
the product will be 361 for the numerator of a fraction whose denominator is
400, which fraction being multiplied and divided according to the former
directions the value thereof will be 18 shillings 0 pence 2 farthings 4/10. Set
the work thus. ^

Or thus, shillings multiplied by shillings and the product divided by 20, the
quotient will be shilings, and the remainer the fraction of a shilling, as the
former product 361 being divided by 20 the quotient is 18 shillings, as before,
and the remainer is 1/20 which being reduced is 0 d. 2 f. and 4/10.

4. Pounds multiplied by pence the product is the numerator of a fraction,
whose denominator is 240 the number of pence in a pound; thus 2 pounds being
multiplied by 11 pence the product is 22 for the numerator to 240; now then if
you multiply 22 by 20 and divide the product by 240, the quotient will be
1200/^40 shillings and this also being multiplied by 12 and the product divided
by 240 the quotient will be 10 pence.

Or thus, pounds multiplied by pence and the product divided by 12 the quotient
will be shillings and the remainer pence. Thus re-divided by 12 give 1 shilling
10 pence as before.

5. Shillings multiplied by pence the product will be the numerator of a
fraction, whose denominator is 240 the number of pence in a pound, and this
numerator being multiplied by 12 and the product divided by 240, the quotient
will be pence, and the remainer the fraction of a penny, which being multiplied
by 4 and the product divided by 240, the quotient will be farthings and the
remainer the fraction of a farthing. Example, 19 shillings being multiplied by
11 pence the product is 209, which being multiplied by 12 the product is 2508,
and this product being divided by 240 the quotient is 10 pence and the remainer
108, which being multiplied by 4 the product is 432 and this product being also
divided by 240 the quotient is one farthing and 19^/240 or

Or thus, shillings multiplied by pence, and the product divided by 20 the
quotient will be pence and the remainer the fraction of a penny, thus 209 being
divided by 20 the quotient is 10 pence and one farthing and 16/20 or as before.

6. Pence multiplied by pence the product will be the numerator of a fraction
whose denominator must be 57600 the number of square pence in a pound; which
numerator being multiplied by 20, by 12 and by 4 continually, and the last
product being divided by 57600, the quotient will be farthings, and the
remainer the fraction of a farthing. Example, let 11 pence be given to be
multiplied by 11 pence the product is 121, which being multiplied by 20 the
product is 2420, and 2420 being multiplied by 12 the product is 29040, and this
also being multiplied by 4 the product is 116160, and this last product being
divided by 57600 the quotient is 2 farthings 57^60/6^0, or 1/60. Or thus, 121
being multiplied by 4 the product will be 484, which being divided by 240 the
number of pence in a pound, the quotient will be two farthings 4/24^ or 1/6^ as
before. For illustration of these 6 rules which are deduced from the preceding
Diagram, let 2 pounds 19 shillings and 11 pence be given to be multiplied by 2
pound 19 shillings and 11 pence, set the numbers as here you see.

lib. s. d. 2 19 11 2 19 11 4 00 00 1 18 00 1 18 00 2 4 0 18 00 0 0 0 01 10 0 0
0 01 10 1 8 00 10 1 8 00 10 2 1667 8 19 6 0 1667

Where two pounds multiplied by two pounds makes 4 pounds by the first rule,
and 2 pounds multiplied by 19 makes 1 l. 185. by the second rule, which must be
set down twice, and 19 shillings multiplied by 19 shillings do make 18 0 2 4/10
by the third rule, then 2 pounds multiplied by 11 pence do make 1 shilling 10
pence by the fourth rule, and this must be set down twice, 19 shillings
multiplied by 11 pence, do make 10 pence farthing 8/10 by the fifth rule, and
this must be set down twice; lastly 11 pence multiplied by 11 pence do make two
farthings, 16667 parts of a farthing by the sixth rule, and so the whole
product is 8 19 06 0 1667.

2 Example in board measure.
Let the length of a board be 14 feet 6 inches and 3 quarters of an inch and
let the breadth be 2 foot 9 inches and 3 quarters, and let the content of that
board be required. According to the first way you must reduce the length and
breadth into the least denomination, so is the the length of this board 699
quarters of an inch, and the breadth 135; and 699 being multiplied by 135 the
product is 94365.

And in a ^oot of board there are 144 inches or 2304 quarters, by which if you
divide 94365 the quotient will be 40 feet and 2^05/23^^ parts of a foot; the
numerator of which fraction being multiplied by 12 the product is 2646^, and
this product being divided by 2304 the quotient is 11 inches and the remainer
i^ 1^16 which multiplied by 4 the product is 4464 which being also divided by
2^01 the quotient is 1 quarter and the remainer is 2^60/^^^^ or 1^/1^ of a
quarter, and so the content of that board is 40 feet 11 inches and and 15/1^ of
a quarter.

The Second Way.
If you multiply 14 by 2 the product is 28 feet by the first rule. Secondly 14
feet by 9 inches makes 126 inches, and 2 feet by 6 inches makes 12 inches more,
in all 138, which being divided by 1^, the quotient is 11 feet 6 inches.
Thirdly, 6 inches by 9 inches makes 54, which being divided by 12 the quotient
is 4 inches and a half. Fourthly, 14 feet by 3 quarters of an inch makes 42,
and 2 feet by 3 quarters makes 6 more, in all 48, which being divided by 12 the
quotient is 4 quarters or one foot. Fifthly, 6 inches by 3 quarters make 18,
and 9 inches by 3 quarters make 27, in all 45, which being divided by 12 the
quotient is 3 quarters and 9/1^ or of a quarter or (...). Sixthly, 3 quarters
by 3 quarters makes 9/12, which is the numerator of a fraction whose
denominator is 48 the number of quarters in a foot, and (...) is equal to ^/1^
or 1^^5/10000 and so the content of this board is 40 feet 11 inches 1 quarter
and ^^/^^ of a quarter, as here you see; for 9/1^ more ^/1^ being reduced as
shall be showed in the doctrine of vulgar fractions, are equal to 15/1^. f. w.
q. 28 00 00 11 06 00 00 04 02* 01 00 00 00 00 03 ^/11 00 00 00 ^/^^


3 Example.
Let there be given in Astronomical fractions 23 degrees, 14 minutes, 32
seconds, to be multiplied by 17 degrees, 37 minutes, 25 seconds. The ancient
Astronomers have divided the Circles in which the Sun and other Planets do move
into 12 equal parts and called them signs; each sign into 30 degrees, so that
they have divided the whole circle into 360 degrees, each degree into 60
minutes, and each minute into 60 seconds, and each second into 60 thirds, and
so forward as far as you please. And hence seconds being multiplied by seconds,
produce fourths, seconds by minutes, thirds, and seconds by degrees, minutes;
only you remember that if the products shall at any time exceed 60, so many
sixties as it does exceed must be transferred to the product of the next
greater denomination, as by the operation it does appear.

Sig. Degrees. Min. Sec. Their. Fourt. 23 14 32 17 37 25 115 70 160 460 280 64 161

1116 1652 1547 13 19 36 32 47 20

In which first you have the Indices or exponents of the several denominations,
and in the two next ^^^e, the Multiplicand and Multiplicator, and beginning
with the least denominations first, I multipl^* 3^ seconds by 25 seconds, and
the product I set it under the denomination of fourths, because seconds
multiplied by seconds produce fourths, then I multiply 14 minutes by 25
seconds, and the product I set under the denomination of thirds, because
minutes multiplied by seconds produ^^ thirds: thirdly I multiply ^^ degrees by
25 minutes, and I set their product under the denomination of seconds, because
degrees multiplied by seconds, produce seconds; and this must be also done with
the second and third numbers in the multiplicator. Then add together all the
products under every particular denomination by themselves, so will the product
under the denomination of fourths, be 800, which being divided by 60 the
quotient is 13, and the remainer 20, therefore I set down 20 under the
denomination of fourths, and carry 13 to the next rank, in which the sum of
the product is 1534, to which the 13 being added, it makes 1547 which being
divided by 60 the quotient is 15, and the remainer 47, therefore I set down 47
under the denomination of thirds, and carry 15 to the next rank, till I have
finished the whole work, and so the product at last is 13 signs, 19 degrees, 36
mintes, 32 seconds, 47 thirds, and 2^ fourths.

CHAP. XI. Of the Division of numbers which are of diverse denominations.
1. WHen a number of diverse Denominations is given to be divided by a number
of but one Denomination, you must begin with the greatest Denomination and
divide the number given, as has been showed in the Division of whole numbers,
and when you have pro^^^ded ^o ^ar in your Division, that the Dividend is
become less than the Divisor, multiply the remaining part of your Dividend by
the number of parts in the next inferior Denomination, and to the product add
the parts of that Denomination given, if there be any in the sum propounded,
and then proceed as before; so shall you at last produce the whole quotient
sought. Example, let it be required to divide 102 pounds 15 shillings 8 pence,
into 7 equal parts or among seven men, you must place the numbers as has been
showed before, then ask how often 7 in 10, the answer is once, therefore I
write 1 in the quotient, and deducting 7 out of 10 the remainer is 3, to which
I draw down 2, the next figure in the dividend, and it makes 32, then I ask
how often 7 is contained in 32, the answer is 4, which I set in the quotient,
then I multiply 7 by 4, the figure last placed in the quotient, and the product
28 being subtracted from 32, the remainder is 4, which being less than 7, I
multiply 4 by 20 the number of parts ^ in the next inferior Denomination, and
the product is 80, to which I add the 15 shillings in the question, and then
the sum is 95, which being divided by seven, the quotient is 13, and the
remainer 4, which being multiplied by 12, the number of parts in a shilling,
the product is 48 pence, to which I add the 8 pence in the question, and then
the sum is 56, which being divided by 7, the quotient is 8, and nothing
remains, and so the whole quotient is 14l. 15s. and 8d.

In like manner 8118l. 11s. 3d. being given to be divided by 283, the quotient
will be 28l. 13s* 9d. as by the following operation does appear. ^

3. When a number of diverse Denominations is given to be divided by a number
of diverse denominations also, it will be convenient to reduce both the numbers
into numbers of the least denomination given, before you begin your Division,
and after Division is finished to reduce the quotient into the several
denominations in which the number was given.

For example, let it be required to divide 6l. 2s. 6d. 3/1, by 2l. 9s. 6d. To
reduce this Dividend into square pence, the ordinary way of Reduction will not
serve, for this Dividend is the quotient of a certain number of square pence,
divided by 57600 the number of square pence in a pound sterling, and therefore
to make this sum given fit for Division, it must be multiplied by 57600* and
to do this it will be proper to begin with the least denomination first, which
in this example is a fraction, and a fraction reduced into its least terms, so
that the first work will be to find the greater fraction, to which the fraction
given is aequivalent, and this is easily done, for 57600 is the denominator;
now then, as 5 to 3, so 57600 to 34560 the numerator sought; and this being
divided by 4 the number of farthings in a penny, gives me the last remainer,
before this 34560, viz. 8640: now pence being the next greater denomination, I
multiply 57600 by 6, the number of pence in the Dividend, the product is
345600, to which adding 8640, the number before found, the total is 354240
which being divided by 12, the number o^ pence in a shilling, the quotient is
2^520, and (...), the number of shillings in the sum given, is 2, I multiply
57600 by 2, the product is 115200 to which 29520 being added, the total is
144720 which must be divided by 20, the quotient will be 7236, and so we have
done with the shillings and pence in the question; lastly I multiply 57600 by 6
the number of pounds propounded, and the product is 345600, to which 7236 being
added, the total is 352836, and so at length the number given is fitted and
prepared for Division; the Divisor according to the ordinary way of Reduction,
will be found to be 594, by which dividing 352836 the quotient will be 594
also, as by the work appears. And this ^ quotient being reduced is 2l. ^s.
6d. the quotient sought.

4. This question and all others of the like nature may be also resolved
without reducing both numbers at the first, in this manner. First set down the
indices of the several Denominations given, and the Dividend under those
indices, and the Divisor under the Dividend, then ask how often the greatest
Denomination in the Divisor is contained in the greatest Denomination in the
Dividend, and put the answer in the quotient, then multiply all the
Denominations in the Divisor, by the figure in the quotient, and the product
being deducted from the Dividend, set down the remainer, and so proceed to the
next, and work in like manner, so shall you at last have the quotient desired.

Example, let 6 pound 2 shillings 6 pence be given to be divided by 2 pounds 9
shillings 6 pence. The numbers being set as here you see, I ask how often 2 is
contained in 6, and the answer is 3 times, but 2 pound 9 shillings cannot be
had but twice in 6 pound 2 shillings, therefore I put 2l. in the quotient, and
multiply the Divisor 2l. 9s. 6d. by 2. and the product 4l. 19s. being deducted
from 6l. 2s. the remainer is 1l. 3s. 6d and so have I wrought once; then I ask
how often 2. is contained in 1l. 3s. that is in 23s. the answer is 11, l. s. d.
^. ten. 6 2 6 00 6 2 9 6 4 19 0 2 lib* 1 3 6 00 6 1 2 3 01 2 9 shil. 1 2 3 4 1
2 3 4 6 d. but I can take but 9s. because of the following figures, therefore I
put 9 shillings in the quotient, and multiply 2l. 9s. 6d. by 9. and the product
is 1l. 2s. 3d. 1 farthing and 2 tenths, which being deducted from 1l. 3s. 6d. ^
far. and 6 tenths, the remainer is 1 shilling, 2 pence, 3 farthings, and 4
tenths, and so I have wrought twice. Then I ask how often 2. in 1s. 2d. and the
answer is 6, therefore I put 6 pence in the quotient, and multiply 2 pounds 9
shillings and 6 pence by 6, and the product is 1 shilling, 2 pence, 3
farthings, and 4 tenths, which being deducted from 1 shilling 2 pence 3
farthings and 4 tenths, the remainer is nothing, and so the quotient is 2l. 9
shillings and 6 pence.

5. In Astronomical fractions, let it be required to divide 13 signs, 19
degrees, 36 minutes, 32 seconds, 47 thirds, and 20 fourths, by 17 degrees, 37
minutes, 25 seconds; first set down the indices or several Denominations of
Astronomical fractions given, and under them write the number of the parts
belonging to each Denomination, as they are propounded in the Dividend, and set
your Divisor either under the Dividend as here you see, or in what other place
you please.

S. D. M. S. T. F. 13 19 36 32 47 20 Dividend 17 37 25 Divisor 13 15 20 35 23

sec.

Then beginning at the left hand, ask how often the number of the greatest
denomination in the Divisor, can be had in number of the greatest denomination
in the Dividend; but if your Divisor be greater than the first number in your
Dividend, place your Divisor one step farther, toward your right hand. Thus in
our example, because 17 is not contained in 13, the greatest denomination in
the Dividend, therefore I s^t it a place forwarder, toward the right hand,
that is under 19 degrees. and then reducing the 13 signs into degrees. by multiplying
them by 30, the product is 390, to which the 19 being added, the sum is 409,
in which 17 is contained 23 times, therefore multiplying the Divisor 17 degrees. 37
min. 25 sec. by 23, the product is 13 ^ig. 15 degrees. 20 min. 35 sec. which being
deducted from the Dividend, the remainer is 04 degrees. 15 min. 57 sec. and to this
remainer, I draw down the number of parts in the next lesser Denomination, and
then I ask how often 17 is contained in 4 degrees. 14 min. and the answer is 14
times, which I place in the Quotient, and multiplying the Divisor 17 degrees. 37
min. 25 sec. by 14, the product is 04 degrees. 06 min. 43 sec. 50 thirds, which
being deducted from the Dividend, as before, the remainer will be 9 min. 13
sec. 57 thirds, and unto this remainer I draw down the number of parts in the
next lesser denomination, and then proceeding as before, I ask how often 17 in
the Divisor is contained in 9 min. 13 sec. in the Dividend, and the answer is
32, which I set in the Quotient, and thereby also I multiply the Divisor as
before, and the product is 9 min. 13 sec. 57 thirds, 20 fourths, there
remains nothing, and so at last, I find the Quotient to be 23 degrees. 14 min. 32
sec.

CHAP. XII. Of the Reduction of Uulgar Fractions.
1. HItherto has been showed the Numeration of such broken numbers or
fractions as are many times expressed like integers: Numeration of such broken
numbers, or fractions as are expressed by their numerators and denominators now
follows, and these broken numbers, are commonly called natural or vulgar
fractions.

2. The numeration of vulgar fractions is either accidental or essential.

3. Accidental numeration, otherwise called Reduction, is that which changes
or reduces the terms of the parts given, without changing or altering of their
value.

4. Reduction or accidental numeration is either of parts to parts, or integers
to parts.

5. Reduction of parts to parts, is that which finds other parts, that are
proportional to the parts given, and this three ways.

1. By reducing the parts given into their least terms, if they be not in their
least terms already. 2. By reducing fractions of unequal denominations into
fractions of the same value, whose denominator shall be equal. 3. By reducing
fractions of diverse denominations into fractions of any denomination that
shall be desired.
6. Reduction of parts or fractions into their least terms, is performed by
finding out a common measure to both parts of the fraction given, that is by
finding out the greatest number, which will measure or divide each of the
numbers given, without leaving any remainer.

7. The greatest common measure of two numbers given may be found by dividing
the greater by the less, and the divisor by the remainer, and so continually
until nothing does remain, the last divisor is the common measure sought.
Example, let it be required to find the greatest common measure unto 63 and 14,
set your numbers as has been directed in Division of whole numbers, thus. ^

Then I ask how often 14 in 63, the answer is 4 times, therefore I put 4 in the
quotiont, and multiply 14 by 4, and the product 56 I set under the Dividend 63,
and substracting 56 from 63 the remainer is 7, then I divide 14 by 7 the
quotient is 2, and the remainer 0, therefore 7 the last divisor is the common
measure sought.

8. The common measure of any two numbers which do constitute a fraction, being
thus found, the said fraction may be reduced into its least terms, by dividing
the numerator and denominator by the common measure, for the quotients will be
the numerator and denominator of the fraction, and in the least terms. So if
the fraction 14/^^ be given to be reduced into the least terms, the common
measure being 7, I divide 14 by 7, and the quotient is 2 for a new numerator,
and dividing 63 by 7, the quotient is 9 for a new denominator, and so the
fraction 14/63 is reduced into its least terms that is into the fraction ^/^;
but if the greatest common measure unto the numerator, and the denominator
given shall be 1, such fraction is in its least terms already; so the fraction
13/34 cannot be reduced into lower terms, because the greatest common* measure
is 1. This is a general rule for the reduction of fractions into their least
terms; but yet even this may be sometimes shortened, for when the numerator and
denominator are eaven numbers they may be measured or divided by 2. As if 16
were the numerator, and 64 the denominator, draw a line at length between them
to separate the numerator from the denominator, and cross the same with a down
right stroke near the fraction as here you see in the margin. Then take the
half of 16 which ^
is 8 for a new numerator, and the half of 64 which is 32, for a new
denominator, again the half of 8 is 4, and the half of 32 is 16, and so
proceeding in like manner there will be found equivalent to 16/64. The like
abbreviation will be found, when the numerator and denominator do both end with
5, or one of them ending with 5, and the other with a cipher, for then the
fraction may be reduced into its least terms, by dividing both parts of the
fraction given, by 5. Thus if it were required to reduce the fraction 125/345
dividing 125 by 5, the quotient will be 5, and dividing 345 by 5, the quotient
will be 19, and so the fraction 135/345 is reduced to the fraction 5/19.

9. Reduction of fractions to the same denomination is performed by multiplying
the numerator of each fraction into all the denominators continually except its
own, for so the several products which arise by such continual multiplication,
shall be the new numerators; and the product found by multiplying all the
denominators continually, shall be the common denominator to all those new
numerators. As in the following examples and 5/6 I multiply 3 by 6, and they
make 18, and 5 by 4, and they make 20, for the two numerators, then I multiply
4 by 6 and the product is 24 for the common denominator, and so the fractions
and are reduced into the fractions 18/24 and 20/24, or being reduced into their
least terms 9/12 and 10/12, as by the work appears.

Thus if the fractions 3/7 and 4/9 ^
were propounded, here I multiply 2 by 7 and 9 continually, and they make 126,
also I multiply 3 by 5 and 9, and the product is 135, in like manner I
mulmultiply 4 by 5 and 7 and the product is 140, and these three products are
three new numerators, lastly I multiply 5 7 and 9 continually, and the product
315 is the common denominator to all the numerators. ^

10. But if the fractions propounded, be compounded fractions, or fractions of
fractions, they must be reduced into single fractions, by multiplying all the
numerators continually for a new numerator, and all the denomniators
continually for a new denominator. Thus if 2/3 of of 4/5 were given, the
product of the numerators 234 is 24; and the product of the denominators 34 and
5 is 60, and so the fractions of of are reduced to ^4/^^ or ^/^

11. The Reduction of integers to parts is either of whole or mixed numbers.

12. A whole number is reduced into an improper fraction by placing the whole
number given as a numerator, and one as a denominator, thus twelve integers
will be reduced into the improper fraction 12/1

13. A mixed number may be reduced into an improper fraction, by multiplying the
whole part of the mixed number, by the denominator of the fraction given, and
adding to the product the numerator of (...) s^id mixed number thus 47/12 is
reduced into the improper fraction 55/12, for 4 being multiplied by 12 the
product is 48, to which if you add 7* the sum is 55 for a new numerator,
which being placed over the denominator 12, gives the improper fraction 55/12
equal to the mixed number 47/12

14. Fractions of diverse denominations may be reduced into fractions of any
denomination desired by multiplying the numerator given by the denominator
required, and dividing the product by the denominator given, for so the
quotient shall be the numerator required.

Example, let the fraction given be of a pound sterling, and let it be desired
to know what that is in the 15/12 of a pound, multiply 7 by 15, the product is
105, which being divided by 8 the Quotient is 1331/1^ that is 13 shillings and
13 groats, that is 17 shillings and 4 pence and 1/^^ of a pound that is 16
pence, which being also divided by 8 the quotient is 2 pence, which being added
to 17 s. 4 d. the whole is 17 s. 6 d. and so the fraction* is reduced to the
equivalent fraction 105/15 or which is all one to the improper fraction 13 1/15
as was propounded. And by this rule may any other fraction given, be reduced to
another equivalent fraction, that shall have any denomination assigned, and is
of excellent use for the converting of vulgar fractions into decimals, and the
contrary, as shall be farther showed in its proper place.

CHAP. XIII. Of the Addition and Subtraction of vulgar fractions.
1. REduction of fractions I call accidental numeration, yet is the knowledge
thereof very essential, for that being well understood, the essential
numeration of vulgar fractions cannot be difficult; whose parts as in whole
numbers are these four, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

2. Vulgar fractions whether proper or improper, being reduced to fractions of
the same denomination, if need be, may be added like whole numbers, still
keeping the same denominator, so 3/9 and 2/9 being given to be added, their
sum is 5/9.

3. Vulgar fractions whether proper or improper being reduced into fractions of
the same denomination, if need be, may be subtracted one from another like
whole numbers, keeping still the same denominator. Thus if the fraction 2/9
were to be subtracted from the fraction 5/9 the difference will be 3/9.

CHAP. XIV. Of the Multiplication and Division of vulgar fractions.
1. WHen Vulgar fractions whether proper or improper are given to be
multiplied, (being reduced to single fractions, if need require) multiply the
numerator of the one, by the numerator of the other, so is the product a new
numerator, also multiply the denominator of the one, by the denominator of the
other, and so shall the product be a new denominator, and this new fraction is
the product sought. Example.

Let the fractions 5/7 and be given to be multiplied, if you multiply the
numerator 5 by the numerator 3, the product is 15 for a new numerator, also if
you multiply the denominator 7 by the denominator 4, the product is 28, for a
new denominator, and so the fraction 15/2^ is the product of the fractions
given.

2. When vulgar fractions whether proper or improper be given to be divided,
they must be reduced into single fractions if need require, then multiply the
denominator of that fraction which is the divisor by the numerator of that
fraction which is the dividend, so is the product a new numerator, also
multiply the numerator of that fraction which is the divisor, by the
denominator of that fraction which is the dividend, so is the product a new
denominator, and this new fraction is the quotient sought. Example.

Let the fraction 2/^ be given to be divided by the fraction, the quotient will
be 8/9, for multiplying 4 by 2, the product is 8 for a new numerator, also
multiplying 3 by 3 the product is 9 for a new denominator, and the fraction 8/9
the quotient sought; and the work stands thus ^/^) 2/^ (8/9.

2. But if the fraction of of be given to be divided by the fraction of 4/7
these compounded fractions must be reduced into single fractions by the tenth
rule of the twelfth Chapter, and then divided as before; thus the fraction of
of will be reduced to 9/40 and the compounded fraction of 4/^ will be reduced
to 8/^^ and the fraction 9/^^ being divided by the fraction 8/21 the quotient
will be 189/320 as by the work appears* 8/^1) 9/40 (189/320

CHAP. XV. Of the Notation of Decimal fractions.
1. THe Notation of fractions in the general has been showed in the sixth
Chapter, and these which for their excellent use are esteemed, as it were
another part of Arithmetic, and from their denominator called Decimals, are in
reality no other than vulgar fractions, and expressed like them, as 5/10 25/100
125/1000 but have also this property belonging to them, which vulgar fractions
in the general have not; namely, that they may be as well expressed without
their denominators as with them* by setting only a point before them; thus ^5
does signify five tenths, as fully, and as plainly, as the writing of it thus
5/10.

2. When the Numerator has not so many places as the Denominator has Ciphers,
supply those places by setting so many ciphers as there are places wanting,
before the numerator given, thus 25/1000 may be as well expressed thus.025.

3. Decimal fractions are so like unto integers, that the parts of single
Arithmetic in whole numbers being well understood, the same parts of
Arithmetic in Decimal fractions, may easily be conceived; the greatest
difference is in the reading of the value of their notes and periods; which is
directly contrary unto that of whole numbers, for in the one, to wit, in whole
numbers, we reckon unites, tens, hundreds, thousands and so forward from the
right hand to the left, but in Decimal fractions we reckon tenths of unity,
hundreds of unity, thousands from unity, and so forward from the left hand to
the right, as does very clearly appear by the following Table.

9 6 3 4 7 6 5 8 3 Fifth place Fourth place Third place Second place First
place First place Second place Third place Fourth place

In this Table you may observe that the places of Decimal parts are separated
from the place of unity in whole numbers by a line drawn between them, so that
the number on the left hand of that line expresses 9 6 3 4 7 integers or
unities; and the number on the right hand of the line 6 5 8 3 expresses the
parts of an unite, or an integer divided into 10000 equal parts, in like manner
this number 7 6 does signify 7 integers, and eight tenth parts of an integer,
and this number 3 4 7 6 5 does signify 347 integers or unities, and 65 decimal
parts of an integer.

CHAP. XVI. Of the Reduction of vulgar fractions into decimal fractions.
1. HAving showed the notation of Decimal fractions, I come now unto their
numeration, the which as in vulgar fractions, is accidental or essential.

2. Accidental numeration, is the Reduction of vulgar fractions into Decimals,
and this may be performed by the fourteenth rule of the twelfth Chapter, where
is showed how fractions of diverse denominations, may be reduced into fractions
of any denomination desired; namely by multiplying the numerator given, by the
denominator required, and dividing the product by the denominator given; now
then to apply this rule to decimal fractions, let it be required to reduce this
vulgar fraction 5/^ of a pound into a fraction, whose denominator shall be
1000; multiply 5 the numerator given by 1000 the denominator desired, and the
product is 5000, which being divided by 8 the denominator given, the quotient
is 625 the numerator answering to 1000 the denominator desired, and so the
vulgar fraction ^/^ is reduced into the decimal fraction 625/1000.

3. Upon this ground the known or accustomary parts of money, weight, measure,
time, motion, etc. may be reduced unto decimals, and first for money, if you
desire to know what decimal fraction is equal to one shilling* or 1/20 of a
pound, assigning the denominator of that decimal to be 100, the numerator
thereto by the last rule will be found to be 5 so that 5/100 or.05 is a decimal
fraction equal in value, to one shilling or 1/20 part of a pound sterling.

In like manner if the Decimal answering to 9/^^ of 1/^^ of a pound were
required, that is the decimal of 9 pence, the compounded fraction 9/^^ of 1/^0
being reduced to a single fraction is 9/240* now then if you assign the
denominator of that decimal to be 1000, the numerator thereto by the last rule,
will be found to be 375, so that 375/10000 or.0375 is a decimal fraction equal
in value to 9 pence or 9/240 of a pound sterling.

Or if the decimal answering to of 1/12 of 1/20 of a pound were required, that
is the decimal of 3 farthings, the compounded fraction of 1/12 of 1/20 being
reduced into a single fraction is 3/960; now then if you assign the denominator
of that decimal to be 10.000.000 the numerator thereto by the last rule will be
found to be 31250, so that 31250/1000000 or.0031250 is a decimal fraction equal
in value to ^/960 of a pound sterling. And hence it appears, that to find the
decimal answering to any number of shillings, you must multiply the shillings
propounded by the denominator 10000 etc. and divide the product by 20, the
number of shillings in a pound sterling.

And to find the decimal answering to any number of pence, you must multiply
the pence propounded by the denominator 10000 etc. and divide the product by
240 the number of pence in a pound sterling.

And to find the decimal answering to any number of farthings, you must
multiply the number of farthings propounded by the denominator 100000, and
divide the product by 960, the number of farthings in a pound sterling.

The decimal answering to any known parts of money, weight, measure, etc. may
be otherwise found in this manner; suppose a pound sterling to be divided into
1.0000000 equal parts, then does.1.0000000 represent one integer, or 20
shillings, and the half thereof 0.50000000 is the decimal of 10 shillings and
0.500000 is the decimal of one shilling, and the half thereof 0.0250000 is the
decimal of six pence, and the half thereof is the decimal of 3 pence, to wit,
0.01250000, and a third of 0.01250000 to wit 0.00416667 is the decimal of a
penny, the half of the decimal of a penny viz. 0.00208333 is the decimal of
half one penny, and the half of that, to wit, 0.00104166 is the decimal of a
farthing, and by either of these ways may a Table be made to show the decimal
of any number, of shillings, pence and farthings.

5. But if any dislike this, because the decimals of some parts of a pound
cannot be exactly found (though it may be thus found so infinitely near that
all questions may be resolved without considerable, though not without sensible
error) yet to satisfy the curiosity of such as shall make this objection, let
them make the third part of a pound to be the integer, that is six shillings
and eight pence, so may they have the decimal of any number of shillings, pence
and farthings exactly, as by the following operation does appear.

Let 6s. 8d. be divided into 1.000000 Then shall the decimal of 8d. be 0.100000
The decimal of 4d. shall be 0.050000 The decimal of 2d. 0.025000 The decimal of
1 penny 0.012500 The decimal of 2 farthings 0.006250 The decimal of 1 farthing
0.003125
6. The like may be done for weights and measures, but as for weights there
will be no great advantage by turning them into decimals, because all questions
concerning them may be more conveniently resolved without them; and as for
measures, especially long measures, there needs no reduction of them, for the
foot, yard or chain for measuring of land, being divided first into ten equal
parts, and then each of those into ten other equal parts, they will be more
useful, than as they are now usually divided.

7. And in Astronomical fractions, the Reverend, Learned, and the famous
Oughtred in the 1 Chap. of his key to the Mathematics, does tell us, that this
Decimal Logistica or accounting is much easier and nearer than that Sexagenary
commonly used* which he plainly perceived, says he, whatsoever he was, that
first reduced the Canon of Sines, from a Semidiameter of 60 parts, unto 1 with
circles or ciphers annexed, and wishes that the same were also done in all
other Astronomical Canons; how such fractions therefore may be converted into
decimals, the following examples will sufficiently declare.

^^^ as much as 60 minutes make a degree, 60 seconds a minute, 60 thirds a
second, and so forward as far as you please; if you divide the minutes given
with ciphers, annexed by 60, the quotient shall be the decimal sought; thus if
the decimal of 45 minutes were required, I divide 450000 etc. by 60, and the
quotient is 75 for the decimal of 45 minutes, if the decimal of seconds be
required, your divisor must be 3600, if the decimal of thirds be required, your
divisor must be 216000, and 12960000 for fourths.

But if there be diverse Sexagesimal Species joined to integers, suppose 127
degrees. 32 min. 00 sec. 09 thirds, 45 fourths, you may use this compendium; under
the integers 127 set the Sexagesimal species in an oblique descent, as here you
see in the margin, then beginning at the lowest, divide every of them
continually 127 d. 32 m. 00 s. 09 t. 45 f.
by 6, and setting the quotients over their heads join them to the row next
above until you come to the integers, so shall the last quotient be the Decimal
sought, Oughtred's Clavis, Chap. 6.

Thus 45 fourths being divided by 6 the quotient is 7, and the next dividend
09.75 which being also divided by 6 the quotient is 1625, and the next dividend
00.1625 ^
which being also divided by 6, the quotient is 002708333 and the next dividend
32.002708333 fourths which being divided by 6 the quotient 5333784722 is the
decimal sought.

8. When a decimal fraction is given, and the value thereof in the known parts
of the Integer is required, multiply the decimal propounded, by the number of
known parts of the next inferior denomination, which are equal to the Integers,
and from that product cut off as many figures toward the right, as the Decimal
given does consist of places, the figures remaining are the value of that
fraction in the next inferior denomination; and the value of the remaining part
of the decimal given in the next inferior denomination may be found by the same
rule, and so forward till you come to the last known parts.

Example, let the value of this decimal.98563, be required in the known parts
of a pound sterling, this decimal 98563 being multiplied by 20, that product is
19) 71260, from which I cut off five figures, the rest are 19 shillings, and
the figures cut off namely 71,260, being multiplied by 12 the product is
8.55120, that is 8 ^
pence and 55120 parts of a shilling, which being multiplied by 4, the product
is 2,220480 that is 2 farthings, and the remainer 20480 are the decimal parts
of a farthing, and so the value of the decimal fraction given is 19 shillings 8
pence penny.

But the value of a decimal fraction in the known parts of a pound, may be
known by inspection, for the first figure doubled, gives the number of
shillings the two next figures are the farthings, thus in the decimal given
98563 the figure 9 being doubled is 18 shillings, and 85 farthings that is 21
pence and a farthing; but more exactly thus, from 85, deduct 75 which is the
decimal of 18 pence the remainer is 10 farthings or 2 pence half penny; that is
in all 19-8d, 2 farthings as before.

If the decimal fraction given whose value is inquired be the decimal of the
degree for a circle, you must divide the decimal given by six continually, and
write the products underneath in every row cutting off one place toward the
right hand, so shall you have the value desired, let the decimal fraction given
be 127.5333784723 and let the value thereof in minutes and seconds be desired,
this fraction being multiplied by 6 the product is 32.002708332 from ^
which cutting off one place of the fraction given, the figures remaining give
32 minutes, and so multiplying of the remainer by 6 continually, the products
give 00 seconds, 09 thirds, and 45 fourths, almost as by the operation in the
margent, does appear.

The use of the Table.
THis Table does consist of six Columns, in the first, you have each other
Grain in two penny weight Troy, in the second every penny in two shillings, in
the other four Columns you have the decimals, answering to the grains in Troy
weight, and to the pence and farthings not exceeding two shillings in English
money. Example, let the decimal 1 penny weight, and 16 grains, be required, or
the decimal of 40 grains, I look for 40 grains in the first Column, and in the
third, I find the decimal thereof to be 083333. Or let the decimal of 1 penny
weight, and 11 grains be required, that is the decimal of 35 grains; 34 grains
I find in the Table; and therefore in the same line in the first Column, I find
072916, for the decimal thereof* if the decimal of 17 penny weight and 13
grains were required, the decimal of 16 penny weight is the half thereof; viz.
8 and that decimal of one penny weight 13 grains is 077083 and so the decimal
required, is 8.077083, the like may be done for any other; and so for money you
have the pence in the second Column and the farthings in the top of that page,
and in the angle of meeting the decimal answering thereunto, thus the decimal
of 19 pence 3 farthings is 08^291 and so for any other.

CHAP. XVI. Of the Addition and Subtraction of Decimals.
1. THe essential numeration of decimal fractions, in all the four speceies, to
wit of addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division is the same as in
whole numbers, only if the numbers given to be added, subtracted, multiplied or
divided, be any of them mixed numbers, that is one part of a whole number, and
the other a decimal fraction, or that in the several operations, integers shall
arise in the working, the greatest difficulty is to distinguish the Integers
from the Decimal parts, which yet in the three first Species of numeration is
very easy, and in the fourth, not very hard to effect, as by example, will
appear.

Let the Decimals of these several sums of money be given to be added together.

01 -- 6. 4968750 1^. 19 -- 10 -- 02 -- 13. 9937590 40. ^0* ^4 -- 00 40. 0166666

Draw a downright line between the whole numbers and the Decimal fractions, and
then add them as in whole numbers, so will the sum be 40l. 00s. 04 as by the
operation does appear.

2. The Subtraction of Decimals is as easy, only, as before, you are to
distinguish the whole number from the fraction by a stroke or point, and then
proceed as in whole numbers has been directed.

Example. Decimals. From 29. 11 -- 03 -- 01 -- 29.5635416 Deduct 14. 19 -- 11
-- 02 -- 14.9979166 Remain. 14. 11 -- 03 -- 03 -- 14.5656250

CHAP. XVII. Of the Multiplication of Decimals.
1. THough the Multiplication of Decimals, does not at all differ from the
Multiplication of whole numbers, as to the manner of the work, and so I might
be as brief in the explanation thereof, as in Addition and Subtraction, yet
that the excellent use of decimal fractions may appear, I shall illustrate
(...) Rule with more examples, than the former

2. And to distinguish the Integers, from the Decimal parts, when the
Multiplication is finished, consider how many decimal parts there are in both
numbers given, and cut off so many figures, or places from the product toward
the right hand the rest toward the left are, Integers, and if the whole
product have not so many places, as there are parts in both the numbers given,
you must prefix as many Ciphers before the product toward the left hand as
there are places wanting, to make it even with the number of the places in the
parts of both the numbers given.

Example, let 2 pound 9 shillings and 6 pence be given to be multiplied, by 2
pound 9 shilling 6 pence, the Decimal of 9 shillings and 6 pence, is,.475, and
therefore the Multiplicand is 2.475 And the Multiplicator also is 2.475 ^ the
product is -- 6.125625 that is, 6 pound 2 shillings 6 pence, and 625 parts.

2 Example.
Let a board in length be 14 feet 6 inches 3 quarters, and in breadth, 2 foot 9
inches 3 quarters, and let the content of that board be required: the Decimal
answering to 6 inches 3 quarters, is 5625, and therefore the Multiplicand
is.14.5625 and the Decimal of 9 inches 3 quarters is, 8125, and therefore the
Multiplicator is 2.8125, which being multiplied together, as whole numbers the
^ Product is -- 40.95603125 that is, 40 feet 11 inches and 1 quarter of an
inch, as it was before found in Chap. 10.

3. Example.
Let the Decimal.3625 be given to be multiplied by.2387 ^The product is --
8652875 which having but seven places of figures, whereas there are eight
places of parts in both the numbers given, I set a Cipher before the product
toward the left hand to make them equal, and then the product is.08652875.

3. By these few examples the easy resolution of some questions by decimal
fractions does appear, which are any other way troublesome enough; and as to
the manner of working, more needs not be said neither, but yet there are some
contractions in Multiplication which are in astronomical questions very useful,
and also in making of Tables of interest and such like, which are set down by
Mr. Oughtred in his Clavis, Chap. 4 It is to find any part of the product
toward the left hand without finding the remainer thereof toward the right
hand, as if 583614 were given to be multiplied by 472963 and that the six first
figures of the product were required toward the left hand, without any
consideration had to the use of the figures of the product toward the right
hand. The way is thus, set the figures of your Multiplicator under the figures
of your Multiplicand, but the quite contrary way, as here you see.

Then beginning with the first figure ^
toward the right hand I set down the product thereof as was directed in the
multiplication of whole numbers, which done I multiply by the second figure,
but begin with that figure of the Multiplicand which stands directly over it,
and set the product under the first figure of the first product, and so the
rest of the figures in the Multiplicator, having still regard to that increase,
which would arise out of the figure preceding that with which you begin your
Multiplication, so shall there be effected what was propounded, as by the
operation does appear; and for the clearer manifestation^ I have added the
wh^le product also. ^

CHAP. XVIII. Of the Division of Decimals.
1. THis is the last Species of essential numeration, and the most difficult,
but not much more difficult in decimal fractions than in whole numbers; in the
Arithmetic work there is no difference between them at all, that difference
that is, between them and all the difficulty too, is in discovering the nature
of the quotient, as whether it be only a fraction, or a mixed number, or which
be integers and which fractions, or if fractions only whether the first place
be tenths or hundreds, or of some other denomination.

2. For the resolving of this question in all the cases or varieties that can
possibly happen, take this general rule.

The first figure in your quotient will be always of the same degree or place
with that figure or Cipher in your Dividend, which stands over the place of
unites in your Divisor.

To illustrate this rule, I will add an example or two; let it be required to
divide a mixed number by a mixed number, let the product of the first example in
the last Chapter 6.125625 which is a mixed number, be given to be divided by the
Multiplicator there given, which is a mixed number also, to wit, 2.475, division
being made according to the rules given for the dividing of whole numbers, the
figures in the quotient will be 2475. Now it remains to separate the integers
in this quotient from the Decimal parts, to perform which I subscribe the
Divisor 2.475 underneath the first dividual 6.125 and I find that the figure 2
which stands in the unites place in the Divisor, does also stand under the
place of unites in the Dividend, and therefore I conclude according to the rule
given, that the first figure in the quotient must also stand in the first place
of Integers, and consequently that the next place on the right hand must be the
beginning of the fraction, and the note of separation must be put between 2 and
4, as here you see. ^

2. Example, let the mixed number 612.5625 be given to be divided by.2475 the
quotient will be 2475 as before, but placing the Divisor under the Dividend, I
find that the place of unites in the Divisor which is now supplied by a Cipher,
does stand ^ under the fourth place of Integers in the Dividend, and therefore
the first figure in the quotient, is the fourth place of Integers also, and
consequently in this example there are no decimal parts in the quotient.

3. Example, Suppose the Decimal.3675 were given to be divided by this
Decimal.025 the quotient will be, 147, and to discover the nature thereof I set
the Divisor under the Dividend thus ^ from whence it appears that the unites
place in that Divisor, is supposed to stand under the place of tens in the
Dividend, and therefore there are two places of Integers in the quotient. And
by these few examples, the use of the rule in any case is* I hope, sufficiently
declared.

The benefit of Division by Decimals may partly appear by the following
propositions.

1 Proposition, Let 8118 pounds 11 shillings 3 pence be given to be divided
amongst 283 men, 11 shillings 3 pence being turned into a Decimal, the Dividend
is 8118.5625 which being divided by 283 the ^ quotient is 28.6882 which being
reduced is 28 pound 13 shillings 9 pence for each man,

2. Proposition, In Astronomical fractions let 13 signs 19 degrees 36 minutes
32 seconds 47 thirds and 20 fourths be given, to be divided, by 17 degrees, 37
minutes, 25 seconds, these numbers being converted into Decimals stand thus. ^

And the quotient is and being ^
reduced is 23 degrees. 14 min. 32 sec. as by the operation does appear, in which
you may see not only the excellent use of decimal fractions, but an excellent
contraction of common division* for as in Multiplication I showed you how to
shorten every particular product, so may you by considering the manner of this
Division, see how to shorten your Divisor, and yet produce the same quotient,
as would arise by using the Divisor at the whole length given.

3. Proposition, If the content of a board be 40 feet 11 inches 1 quarter of an
inch and 15 sixteenths of a quarter, and the breadth 2 foot 9 inches 39, and
let the length of that board be required.

The Decimal of 11 inches 1 quarter 15/1^ by the second example of the last
Chapter is.95703125. So that 40.59703125 is the Dividend, and 2.8125 is the
Divisor, and the quotient is (14.5625 ^

Compare these examples with those in the 11 Chapter, and use that way which
likes you best.

CHAP. XIX. Of the relation of numbers in Quantity.
1. HItherto we have spoken of single Arithmetic, Comparative follows; in
which numbers are to be considered as they have relation to one another, in
quantity or in quality.

2. Relation in quantity is of equal or unequal numbers* and hence it is called
Relation of equal or unequal reason, in both which the numbers propounded are
always two, the first of which is called the Antecedent, and the other the
Consequent.

3. Equal reason, is the Relation that equal numbers have to one another, as 5
to 5, 6 to 6, 12 to 12.

4. Unequal reason is the relation, that unequal numbers have to one another,
and this is either of the greater to the less, or of the less unto the greater.

5. Unequal reason of the greater to the less, is when the greater number is
the Antecedent, and the lesser, the Consequent, that is, when the greater
number is first set down, and the lesser after it, or when the greater number
is set over the less, with a line between them in manner of a vulgar fraction,
as of 6 to 3, 5 to 2, where 6 and 5 are Antecedents, 3 and 2 are Consequents,
and may be otherwise written thus 6/^ 5/^.

6. Unequal reason of the lesser to the greater, is when the lesser number is
the antecedent, and the greater the consequent; as 5 to 6, 2 to 5.

7. The relation that these several kinds of numbers have to one another in
quantity, is either in respect of the difference between the antecedent and the
consequent, or in respect of the reason that is between them.

8. The difference between the antecedent and the consequent is found by
subtracting the consequent from the antecedent; thus the difference between
equal numbers as of the relation of 5 to 5, 6 to 6, or 12 to 12, is 0. but the
difference of the relation of 6 to 3 is 3, of 5 to 2 is 3, for 3, deducted from
6, the remainer is 3, and 2 deducted from 5 is 3 also, but the difference of
the relation of 3 to 6 and 2 to 5 is 3 less than nothing, that is the
antecedent is less by 3 than the consequent.

9. The rate or reason between 2 numbers i^ found by dividing the antecedent by
the consequent.

10. The rate or reason between two equal numbers is always an unite, for if it
be demanded how often 5 is contained in 5, the answer is 1.

11. The rate or reason between 2 unequal numbers is greater than unity, if the
antecedent be the greater, and less than unity if the antecedent be the lesser
number; thus the rate or reason of 8 to 5 is 1 but the rate, or reason of 5 to
8 is ^/^.

12. Both these kinds of unequal reason are either simple or compound.

13. The simple kinds of unequal reason are of three varieties. 1. Manifold, 2.
Superparticular, 3. Superpartient.

14. Manifold simple reason, is when the greater number does contain the less a
certain number of times, without leaving any remainer, as 4 to 2, 9 to 3, 16 to
4 are numbers which have manifold reason, as double, triple, and fourfold
reason, for the greater numbers being divided by the less, the quotients are 2.
3. 4.

15. Superparticular, is a simple rate or reason in which the greater number
does contein the lesser once and one part more, as 3 to 2, 6 to 5, 8 to 7, in
which the antecedent does contein the consequent once, and one part more of the
consequent, as by dividing the antecedents by the consequents, the quotients
clearly show; to wit, 1^/^, 1^/5 11/^. There is the same rate or reason in
these 12 to 8, and 15 to 10, for though the quotients are 14/^, 15/1^ yet being
reduced, they are 1.

16. Superpartient, is a simple rate or reason in which the greater number does
contein the lesser once, and several parts of the lesser; as 5 to 3, 7 to 4, 13
to 8, in which the antecedents being divided by the consequents, the quotients
are 12/^, 1, 15/^.

17. The compounded kinds of unequal reason are either Manifold
Superparticulars or Manifold Superpartient. That these are reasons compounded
of the preceding does plainly appear by their very names, the one being the
second joined unto the first, and the other the third joined unto the first.

18. Manifold Superparticular reason, is a compounded reason, in which the
greater number does contein the lesser diverse times, and one part more of the
lesser; as in these unequal reasons, 5 to 2, 10 to 3, 13 to 4, the greater
numbers being divided by the lesser the quotients are 2, 31/^, 3.

19. Manifold Superpartient reason, is a compounded reason, in which the
greater number does contein the lesser several times, and several parts more of
the lesser, as in these unequal reasons 11 to 4, 12 to 5, and 22 to 6, the
greater numbers being divided by the lesser, the quotients are, 2, 2, 32/^.

CHAP. XX. Of the relation of numbers in Quality.
1. RElation of numbers in Quality, (otherwise called Proportion,) is either
Arithmetical or Geometrical.

2. Arithmetical proportion, is a Relation that numbers have unto the equality
of their differences; as in 8. 7. 6. and in 12. 9. 6. 3 there are two
proportions which have equal differences; in that first rank of numbers, the
equal or common difference is 1, and in the second 3.

3. Arithmetical proportion, is either continued or interrupted.

4. Arithmetical proportion continued, is when the same difference is continued
from the first numbers to the last, as in this rank of numbers. 5. 7. 9. 11.
the common difference is 2.

5. Arithmetical proportion interrupted, is when the difference between the
first and second is the same with the third and fourth, but not between the
second and third, or when the difference is discontinued in any part of the
rank, as in these numbers, 10. 8. 4. 2. the difference between 10 and 8 is 2,
and the difference between 2 and 4 is 2, but the difference between 4 and 8 is
4.

6. In Arithmetical progression, two things may be inquired, either the terms
that constitute the progression, or the sum that the terms in a certain
progression made.

7. Sometimes all the terms in an Arithmetical progression at a certain given
rate may be required to be expressed in their natural order; or the progression
being interrupted, some particular term in that progression may be required.

8. If it be required to express the terms in any rate propounded, add the rate
to any given term continually and you have what is required; as if it were
required to make a rank of numbers, in Arithmetical proportion, answerable to
the rate or difference that is between 1 and 5, add 4 which is the difference
between the numbers given unto 5, and so continually to their sum and you shall
constitute this rank of numbers 1. 5. 9. 13. 17. 21. which is the rank of
numbers in Arithmetical proportion required.

9. If some particular term in any progression be required without the rest,
deduct, from the term required, the remainer being multiplied by the common
difference in that progression, and the product added to the first shall give
the term desired: as in this progression 4. 7. 10, let the 12 term from 4 the
first term given be required, deducting one from 12 the remainer is 11, which
being multiplied by 3 the common difference the product is 33, to which adding
4 the first term, the sum is 37 for the 12 term required: and in like manner
the 30 term will be found to be 91: the like may be done for any other.

The Terms. 4 2 10 37 91 The number. 1 2 3 12 30

10. If the sum of the terms in any rank of numbers, in Arithmetical proportion
continued, multiply the sum of the first and last terms by the number of the
terms, half the product shall be the sum required, as in this example, 1. 5. 9.
13. 17. 21, the sum of the first and last terms is 22, which being multiplied
by 6 the number of the terms the product is 132, the half whereof is 66 the sum
of the terms required.

11. Three numbers being given which differ by Arithmetical proportion
continued, the mean number being doubled, shall be equal to the sum of the
extremes, so 5. 9. 13. being given, the double of 9 is 18 and the sum of 5 and
13 is 18 also.

12. Four numbers being given that differ by Arithmetical proportion continued
or interrupted, the sum of the two means shall be equal to the sum of the two
extremes, so 5. 9. 13 17 being given, the sum of 9 and 13 the two mean numbers,
is equal to the sum of 5 and 17 the 2 extremes.

13. Geometrical proportion is a relation that numbers have to the equality of
their rate or reason: as in 2. 6. 4. 12, where the rate between 2 and 6 is the
same with that which is between 4 and 12; for as 6 is three times as much as 2,
so 12 is three times as much as 4.

14. Geometrical proportion is either continued or interrupted.

15. Geometrical proportion continued, is when the same rate or reason is still
kept in the whole rank of numbers given, as 2. 4. 8. 16. 32, in which the
progression is continued by double reason, for as 4 is twice 2, so 8 is twice
4, 16 is twice 8, and 32 is twice 16.

16. In numbers that increase by Geometrical proportion continued, if you
multiply the last term by the rate or reason by which the rank of numbers is
created, and from the product subtract the first, the remainer being divided,
by the rate less one shall give you in the quotient, the total sum of all the
terms. Example, let the rank of numbers propounded be 3. 9. 27. 81. 243, the
rate or reason by which this rank of numbers is created is 3, by which the last
term 243 being multiplied the product is 729, out of which deducting 3 the
first term, the remainer is 726, which being divided by the triple less one
that is by 2, the quotient gives me 363, for the sum of the terms propounded.

17. Three numbers being given which do increase by Geometrical proportion, the
square of the mean shall be equal to the product of the extremes; as 9. 27. 81.
being propounded, the square of 27 is 729, and the product of 81 by 9 the two
extremes is 729 also.

18. Geometrical proportion interrupted, is when the rate or reason which is
between the first and second and between the third and fourth, is not to be
found between the second and third; as 6. 3. 16. 8. in which 3 is half 6, and 8
half of 16, but the same rate is not found between 3 and 16.

19. Four numbers being given which do increase by Geometrical progression
continued or interrupted, the product of the two mean numbers shall be equal to
the product of the extremes: let the four numbers given be 6. 3. 16. 8. the
product of 16 by 3 is 48, and the product of 8 by 6 the extreme numbers is 48
also.

CHAP. XXI. Of the Rule of Three.
THis Golden Rule does from gi'n numbers three
Show in Proportion what the fourth must be:
What makes the Quest* must the third place possess;
Then see what it requires, be it more or less:
If more, you must by the less extreme divide,
If less, the greater must the Quote decide.
1. From the last rule of the preceding chapter does arise this precious Jewel
in Arithmetic, which for its excellent use is called the Golden Rule,
otherwise and more commonly the Rule of Three; because it teaches from three
numbers given, how to find a fourth that is in Geometrical proportion to them.

2. This Rule of three is either simple or compound.

3. The single Rule of three is, when three numbers are propounded, and a
fourth in proportion to them is required.

4. This Rule of three is either direct or inverse.

5. The rule of three Direct is when the third term has such proportion unto
the fourth, as the first has to the second.

6. The Rule of three Inverse is, when the first term has such proportion to
the fourth, as the third has to the second.

7. The difficulty of this Rule lies in two things, first in stating the
question or placing the numbers given, and then secondly in discovering,
whether the first or third term must be the Divisor.

8. The question may be easily stated by considering, by which of the three
numbers given the question is moved, for that must be always the third term,
and that which is of the same denomination with the third, must be always set
first, and the number remaining is to be set between them, and must be always
of the same denomination with the fourth that is required.

9. The Question being stated, to discover whether the first or third number
given must be the divisor, consider again whether the fourth term required,
must be more or less than the second term given, for if it must be more, the
lesser extreme must be the divisor, but if less, the greater extreme must be
the divisor.

Example, If 12 men spend 36 pound, how much shall 18 men spend; here the
question is concerning the 18 men, this is therefore the third number, and 12
men is the number of the same denomination, and must therefore possess the
first place, and the middle number is 36 pounds: so that the numbers in the
question must stand thus. And now to discover Men lib. Men 12. 36. 18.
whether the first or last of these numbers must be the Divisor, I consider
again whether the fourth term required must be more or less than 36. the middle
term or second number, and my reason tells me that 18 men must needs spend more
than 12, therefore the fourth number must be greater than the second, and so 12
the lesser extreme must be the Divisor; now then forasmuch as the product of
the two mean numbers is equal to the product of the two extremes by the last
rule of the preceding chapter, it follows that if I multiply 36 by 18 and
divide the product by 12, the quotient will be the fourth term required, and so
the answer will be found to be 54 pounds. Men lib. Men lib. 12 36 18 54

2. Example, If 25 shillings in Wine will serve 36 men when Wine is at 12
pounds the Tun, how many men will the same sum serve, when Wine is at 18 pounds
the Tun; Here the question is concerning the 18 pounds for a Tun of Wine; this
is therefore the third number, and 12 pounds the Tun is of the same
denomination, and must therefore possess the first place, and the middle number
is the 36 men, and so the numbers in the question must stand thus.

lib. Men lib. 12 36 18.

And now to discover whether the first or third of these numbers must be the
Divisor, I consider if the higher the price of Wine is, the fewer persons will
25 shillings serve, and therefore 18 the greater extreme must be the Divisor,
and then by the Rule of three inverse it is as 18. 36. 12. 14.

These two examples well considered will be sufficient to show the nature of
this Rule, and the manner of working: but because there is such variety of
questions to be resolved thereby, in which sometimes one part of single
Arithmetic is exercised, sometimes another, and of Comparative Arithmetic
also, by way of preparation for the better stating of the question, and more
plain and easy solution, it will not be amiss to add an example in each
variety, or in so many of them as are of daily practice.

3. My first instance shall be in such questions, in which the addition of
whole numbers is required in order to the better stating and resolving of them
by this Rule.

A Merchant buys 120 Tun of Wine for 2400l. and the freight thereof from Spain
to London cost him 1200l. for loading and unloading 30l. for custom 50l. and
for expenses in the voyage 64l. and he designs to get 800l. by the bargain. The
question is at what rate this wine must be sold per Tun.

In such examples, the price of the freight with all the expenses and gain must
by addition be brought into one sum, which in this particular is 4544; then I
say if 120 Tun cost 4544 pound, what shall 1 Tun cost, and the answer is
37104/120 or 52/60 or ^6/3^ or 13/15 of a pound.

4. Sometimes a question belonging to the Rule of three is prepared for
solution by subtraction, as in this following. If 24 Gallons of water do in one
hours time run from one pipe into a Cistern containing 250 Gallons, and run out
16 Gallons by another in the same time, in how many hours will that Cistern be
filled.

Here one of the terms propounded, must be explained by subtraction, for it is
plain that the enquiry is, by how much the Cistern does fill more than it
empties; if therefore you subtract 16 Gallons from 24 the remainer is 8
Gallons, which the Cistern recieves in an hours time; hence the question must
be thus stated.

If a Cistern recieve 8 Gallons in one hours time, in how many hours will it
receive 250 Gallons: facit, 32.

5. Sometimes a question belonging to this rule must be prepared by addition
and subtraction both, as in this following. A Merchant buys ^ bags of Pepper.

lib. The first marked A containing 86 tare 06 The second marked B containing
76 tare 05 The third C containing 98 tare 12 The fourth D containing 75 tare 05
335 028

And he is to pay 35 shillings per. Cent. neat. The question is how much the 4
bags cost.

In the Trade of Merchandise, there are certain allowances and abatements used,
which are known by the names of Tare and Tret, by Tare they understand the
weight of the chest, bag, but, etc. And by Tret the overweight which is allowed
the buyer, in this question we have to do with the former only; where first you
must get the gross weight of all the parcels by addition and they are 335 lib.
and also the sum of the allowances for the Tare which is 28 lib. then deducting
the 28 lib. Tare from 335 gross weight, the remainer is 307 lib. neat; hence
the question must be stated thus.

If 100 pound cost 35 shillings what shall 307 lib. cost: facit 107 4^/^^.

6. Sometimes a question belonging to this Rule must be prepared for solution
by Multiplication, as in this following. How many Spanish Pistolets at 14
shillings sterling the piece, ought to be received for 128 Escus d'or, at 7
shillings sterling the piece. Here the 128 Escus d'or must be reduced into
English by multiplying them by 7 shillings, the value of one Escus d'or, whose
product is 896 shillings, and then the question must be thus stated.

If 14 shillings be worth 1 Pistolet, how many Pistolets are 896 worth. Facit
64 Pistolets.

7. Sometimes a question belonging to this rule must be prepared for solution
by multiplication and addition, sometimes by multiplication and subtraction; as
in these examples following, the first of which requires multiplication and
addition.

A Butcher sends his man with 216 pound sterling to buy Cattle, Oxen at 11
pound apiece, Cows at 2 pound a piece, Colts at one pound 5 shillings, Hogs at
1 pound 15 shillings a piece, and of each a like number, the question is how
many of each he might buy for that money. To resolve this question I must first
reduce the pounds sterling into shillings by multiplication, and 216 pound
being multiplied by 20 the product is 4320 shillings, and the several prizes of
the Cattle must be reduced into shillings also, and thus 11 pounds for an Ox is
220 shillings, the price of a Cow is 40 shillings, the price of a Colt 25
shillings, and the price of a Hog is 35 shillings, the sum of these several
prizes is 320 shillings, this done the question may be thus stated.

If 320 shillings buy 1 of each sort, how many shall 4160 buy, facit 13.

2. Example, In the which the question is to be prepared by multiplication and
subtraction.

If 128 Gallons of water run into a Cistern in an hours time from one Cock, and
174 Gallons of water run into another Cistern, in an hours time also, but not
begin to run till 4 hours after the first, in what time will the quantity of
water run out of both be equal? To resolve this question, one of the terms
given must be prepared by Multiplication, and another by Subtraction; first
there must be computed how much water was run out of the first Cock before the
second began, and that is 4 times 128 Gallons that is 512: secondly it must be
considered, how many Gallons more does run out of the last Cock than does out
of the first in an hours time, which by subtracting 128 from 174 I find to be
46, and hence this question is to be thus stated.

If I gain 46 Gallons in one hour, in how many hours shall I gain 512 Gallons.
Facit 11.

8. Sometimes a question belonging to this rule, must be prepared for solution,
by Arithmetical or Geometrical proportion, as in these questions following.

A man going a journey spends one shilling the first day, 3 the second, 5 the
third, 7 the fourth, still increasing his expenses by this proportion till he
has spent 1500 shillings, I demand in how many days that sum is spent.

To resolve this question the sum of such an Arithmetical progression for some
certain time must be first computed; as suppose for thirty days, which will be
found to be 900 shillings; and hence it may be thus concluded.

If 900 shillings last me 30 days, how long shall 1500 shillings last me. Facit
50.

Another question may be this, If a piece of Cloth containing 40 yards did cost
me 30 pounds. at what rate must that Cloth be sold to gain 12 pound in the
hundred?

Before this question can be resolved, I must find the price of one Yard, by a
proportion Geometrical by way of preparation thus, If 4^ Yards cost 50 pound,
what shall one Yard cost, facit 1. Then I say.

If 100 pounds be increased to 112, to what shall 1 be increased? Answer 1.

CHAP. XXII. The Rule of Three in fractions.
1. FRactions as I have already showed, are of 3* sorts, viz. such as are many
times expressed like integers, such as are expressed by their numerators and
denominators, and such as have a unite with Ciphers annexed for their
denominator, and now known by the name of Decimal fractions: in each of these I
will exemplify this Rule by some few examples; and first in such fractions as
are expressed like Integers.

2. Your question being stated bring your numbers propounded into the least
name mentioned, or as low as you desire the question to be answered in, then
multiply the second and third and divide the product by the first, if your
question belong to the Rule of Three direct; or multiply the first and second
and divide by the third, if it belong to the Rule of Three inverse, the
quotient being reduced shall be the answer required.

Example.
If 7 lib. 8 ounces of Currants, cost 2s. 7d. what shall 100 13 lib. cost. In
this question the first and third terms must be reduced into ounces, and the
second term into pence, and then the question will stand thus.

If 112 ounces Cost 31 pence, what shall 1267 ounces cost. Facit 359d. 1 64/112
farthings; that is 1l. 9s. 11d. 1f. of a farthing.

A second example may be this; A man does borrow of his friend 246 lib. 7
shillings and 6 pence for 27 weeks, for how long time must he lend his friend
329 lib. 13 shillings 4d. to require his kindness. Here it is plain that the
fourth term required, must be less than the second term given, and therefore
the greater extreme must be the Divisor, and the numbers being reduced and
placed as has been directed they will stand thus 59130 -- 187 -- 79120* in
which the greater extreme being in the third place does plainly show that this
question does belong to the Rule of Three inverse, and therefore as ^

3 Example in Sexagenary numbers, If 48 firsts, 28 seconds, give 60 minutes,
what shall 25 minutes, 12 seconds give. According to the former Rules given in
Multiplication 25 firsts, 12 seconds being multiplied by 60 minutes, the
product is 25 degrees, 12 firsts, 00 seconds, which being divided by 48 firsts,
28 seconds the quotient will be 31 firsts, 08 seconds.

4. Example, in vulgar fractions. If of a Yard of Velvet be sold for of a pound
sterling, what shall of a Yard cost?

If respect be had to the Rules of the Multiplication and Division of fractions
already delivered in the 14th Chapter, the working of this Rule in fractions
will be the same as in whole numbers; thus and being multiplied together the
product will be 28/40 which being divided by 7 the quotient is 84/^0 or 1 lib.
4/^0 or 1/20; and so the answer is 1 pound and one shilling.

Otherwise thus, Multiply the Denominator of the first number by the numerators
of the second and third continually, so shall the last product be a new
numerator; then multiply the numerator of the first number by the denominators
of the second and third numbers continually, so shall the last product be a new
denominator, and this fraction shall be the quotient desired. Thus the
denominator 3 being multiplied first by 4 and then by 7 the last product is 84;
and the numerator 2 being multiplied first by 5 and then by 8 the last product
will be 80 for a new denominator, and so the new fraction will be 84/^0 as
before.

5 Example, If 4 of a Yard of Cloth in length, being 1 Yard and half broad,
will make a Cloak, how much Plush that is of a Yard in breadth will serve to
line that Cloak. Here the fourth term required must be greater than the second
term given, and therefore the lesser extreme must be the Divisor, and the less
extreme being in the third place, plainly shows, that this question does
belong to the Rule of Three inverse, and the numbers must stand as here you see.

breadth length breadth 1/1^ 4 or 3/^ 17/4

And being the Divisor, 4 being multiplied first by 17 and then by 3 the last
product is 204, and 3 being multiplied by 4 and by 2, the last product is 24,
and so the new fraction or quotient sought is 204/24, which being reduced, is 8
yards.

6. Example, in Decimal fractions. If 7 ounces 3 penny weight and 12 grains be
worth 21l. 11s. 6d. what is the value of 1 ounce?

The Decimal of 3 penny weight is 0.15 And the Decimal of 12 ounces is 0.025
And the sum of these 2 Decimals is 0.515 Wherefore the first number in the Rule
of Three is 7.175 Again the Decimal of 10s. 6d. is 0525 Wherefore the second
number is 21.515 And the third number is 1.5
Now to resolve this question, the 3 given numbers will stand thus. 7.175 -
21.525 - 1.5.

Lastly, multiplying the second by the third, the product is 32.2875 which
being divided by 7.175 the quotient is 4.5 that is 4 pounds and ten shillings,
which is the price of an ounce and half of that Gold.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the Rules of Practice.
1. WHen the Rule of Three direct has 1, or an Integer for the first term, it
is commonly called a Rule of practice, not only for the speedy, but the
practical resolution of such questions: for whereas other questions belonging
to this Rule, do for the most part require Multiplication and Division, these
in the ordinary way are resolved by Multiplication; and whereas Multiplication
is generally much easier than Division, these questions are in an accustomary
or practical way, for the most part performed by Division, and yet done with
more ease than they can be by Multiplication: nay where Multiplication and
Division are both used, the resolution is yet easier, than it is or can be by
Multiplication only.

2. The questions to be resolved by these abbreviations of the Rule of Three,
or practical operations, do for the most part come under one or other of these
five cases. The price of 1 or an Integer does consist either

1. Of a certain number of shillings under twenty. 2. Of a certain number of
pounds and shillings. 3. Of a certain number of pence under twelve. 4. Of a
certain number of shillings and pence. 5. Of a certain number of pounds,
shillings and pence with the parts of a penny.
3. Now for the resolution of such questions which may or do fall under any of
these cases; it is necessary that the Aliquot parts of a pound and shilling be
first known, that is, how often the shillings of pence, which are the given
price of one Integer are contained in a pound or shilling, without leaving any
remainer; thus 4 shillings is an aliquot part of a pound or 20 shillings,
because 4 may be taken 5 times in 20, without either excess or defect; and 3 is
an aliquot part of a shilling or 12 pence, for 4 times 3 does make 12; but 7 is
not the aliquot part of 20, for two times 7 is less than 20; and 3 times 7 is
more. In like manner 5 is not the aliquot part of 12, for 2 times 5 is but 10,
and 3 times 5 is 15, the one wants of 12, and the other exceeds it; but yet any
number of shillings under 20 may be reduced to the aliquot parts of a pound,
and any number of pence under 12 may be reduced to the aliquot parts of a
shilling.

Thus 7 shillings is one fifth more, 3 twenties of a pound: and 5 pence, is one
third more, one twelveth of a shilling, or one fourth, more one sixth. Such
aliquot parts of a pound or shilling as are most useful in the resolution of
questions of this nature, are here expressed in two Tables; with which I have
joined a third, showing the product of 12 by any number not exceeding it self,
which in many questions will be found as useful as either of the other.

Aliquot parts of a pound. Aliquot parts of a Shilling. The product of 12 by
any number less. Pence. 10 0 11 ++ 2 x 12. 24 6 8 10 + 3 x 12. 36 5 0 9 + 4 x
12. 48 4 0 8 +^/^ 5 x 12. 60 3 4 7 + 6 x 12. 72 2 6 6 7 x 12. 84 2 0 1/10 5
+1/^ 8 x 12. 96 1 8 1/12 4 9 x 12. 108 1 4 1/15 3 10 x 12. 120 1 3 1/^ 2 1/^ 11
x 12. 132 1 0 1/^ 1 ^/^ 12 x 12. 144 Shil. Pence. 1 1/20

These things premised, I will now show how any question coming under the
aforesaid five cases may be resolved.

1. Case, where the price of an Integer is shillings only.
4. Where the price of 1, or an Integer is two shillings, the price of as many
Integers as you will may be discovered by bare inspection, for two shillings
being the tenth of a pound, the double of the first figure (toward the right
hand) is the number of shillings required, and the rest of the figures are so
many pounds. Example, 567 yards at 2 shillings the Yard will cost 56 pounds 14
shillings; for the double of 7 is 14 which I write down by it self as
shillings, then taking the rest of the figures toward the left hand for
pounds, the answer is 56l. 14s.

5. When the given price of 1 or an Integer is an even number of shillings
greater than two, multiply the number of Integers whose price is required, by
half the number of shillings given; the double of the first figure toward the
right hand in the product being set down for the shillings apart, all the other
figures toward the left hand shall be the pounds required.

Example, let the price of 365 Yards be required, at 14 shillings per 1 Yard:
if you multiply 365 by 7 (which is the half of 14 the number of shillings
given) the product will be 2562, now the double of 2, the first figure y. s. y.
1. 14 365 7 256. 2
toward the right hand is 4, the other figures are 256 pounds, and so the
answer is 256l -- 4s.

Here note that 4 shillings being the 5th part of a pound, if that be the price
of an Integer, it will be all one to multiply by 2 or divide by 5, if the
double of the first figure in the product toward the right hand be taken for
the shillings according to this rule.

6. When the given price of 1 or an Integer is an odd number of shillings, for
the odd shilling take the. of the price propounded, and add it to the product
of the price given by half the number of shillings remainer, taking the double
of the last figure of the products for shillings according to the former
directions, their sum shall be the answer required. Example, let the price of
367 Yards be required at 9 shillings the Yard. The twentieth part of 367 y. s.
y. 1. 9. 367 4 20*367 -- 18 7 1468 -- 146 16 165 03
is 18 pound 7 shillings, and the product of 367 by 4 (half the number of the
shillings remaining) is 1468 that is 146 pound 16 shillings, which being added
to 18l. 7 shillings, the answer is 165 pound, 3 shillings.

Note, When 5 shillings is the given price of an Integer the shortest way will
be to divide the number whose price is required by 4, because 4 is the first
part of a pound; thus if the worth or price of 367 Yards at 5 shillings the
Yard were required, the answer would be 91 that is 91l. 15s.

2. Case, Where the price of an Integer is pounds and shillings.
7. When the price of 1 or an Integer does consist of pounds and shillings;
first multiply the number of Integers whose price is required, by the number of
pounds in the price given, and subscribe the product as pounds; then proceed
with the shillings in the price propounded, according to the 5 or 6 rules of
this Chapter, and subscribe the sum or sums so found under the number of
pounds, the total of these sums shall be the answer required. Example, let the
price of 1238 hundred weight at 3l. 12s. per C. be required, 1238 being C l s
1. 2. 13. 1238 3714 742.16 619.18 5067.14.
multiplied by 3 the product is 3714, and the product thereof by 6 is 7428 that
is 742l. 16s. and the twentieth part of 1238 is 619l. 18s. the which several
sums being added together their total 5067l. 14s. is the answer sought.

3. Case, Where the price of an Integer is a number of pence under 12.
8. When the given price of 1 or an Integer is such a number of pence, as is an
Aliquot part of a shilling; divide the number of integers, whose value is
required, by such aliquot part; so will the quotient be the number of
shillings, which answers the question, and may be reduced into pounds (if need
require) by dividing the same by 20.

Example, Let the value of 3947 pounds weight, be required at 3 pence the
pound, because 3 is the 4 part of 12 pence, lib. d lib. 1. 3. 3947 20. 986 49.
6. 9
I divide 3947 by 4 and the quotient is 986 that is 986 shillings 9 pence, or
the shillings being divided by 20 the answer is 49l. 6s. 9d.

9. When the given price of 1 or an Integer is composed of aliquot parts of a
shilling, divide the number of Integers whose price is required, by the several
parts of which the given price of one Integer is composed; the several
quotients being added together, shall be the value or sum inquired.

Example, let the price of 1638 Yards at 7 pence the Yard be inquired; for as
much 7 is composed of one third, and one fourth of a shilling, if I divide
1638, by 4 which is one third of a shilling, the quotient will be 4022/4
shillings, again dividing 1638 by 3 which is the fourth of a shilling, the
quotient will be 546 shillings, and the sum of these two quotients 9482/4 is
the answer to the question, or 94l. 16s. 6d. ^

4. Case, Where the price of an Integer is a number of shillings and pence.
10. When the given price of an Integer consists of shillings and pence,
multiply the number of integers, whose value is required, by the number of
shillings given, and set down the product as shillings; then divide the said
number of Integers, by the Aliquot parts of a shilling of which the pence are
composed, and set their quotients under the former product; the sum of the
product and quotients shall be the answer sought.

Example, let the value of 836 Yards at 17 shillings 9 pence the yard be
required, the product of 836 by 17 is 14212, that y s d y 1 17 9 836 17 4836
5852 2) 836 8360 4) 836 418 209 20) 14839 741l. 19s.
is the product by 7 is 5852 and the product by 10, 8360, then dividing 836 by
2 and 4 severally the quotients are 418, and 209, and the sum of all is 14839
that is 741l. 19s.

11. When the given price of an Integer consists of shillings and pence, and
that such shillings and pence considered together do make the aliquot part of a
pound; the question may sometimes be more expeditiously answered, if we divide
the number of Integers whose value is required, by such aliquot part of a
pound, than by the former rule. Example, let the price of one integer be 6
shillings 8 pence, which is the third part of a pound, and let the value of 983
Yards at that rate be required: the product of 983 by 6 is 5898, and 983 being
divided y s d 1 6 8 983 6 983 5898 3) 983 327 ^8 3) 983 327 8 20) 6553 4 327 13
4
by 3 twice, because 4 pence is the third of a shilling, the quotient is 327
that is 327 shillings 8 pence, which being set down twice, the sum of the
product and quotients 6553 shillings 4 pence, and this being divided by 20, the
value of 983 Yards will be 327l. 13s. 4d. But now if you divide 983 by 3, the
quotient is 327 that is 327 lib. 13 shillings 4 pence, as before.

5. Case, Where the price of an Integer does consist of pounds, shillings and
pence, and the parts of a penny.
12. Where the given price of an Integer does consist of pounds, shillings and
pence; and the price of a certain number of Integers less than 10 be required;
multiply the given price of one Integer, by the number of Integers whose value
is desired, as has been showed in the Multiplication of pounds, shillings and
pence, so shall the product be the answer required.

Example, let the price of 8 hundred weight be required, one hundred being 4
lib. ^7 shillings 9 pence, first I multiply 9 pence by 8 and they make 72 pence
or 6 shillings; therefore I set down 0 pence and carry 6 to the next
denomination: then I multiply 17 shillings by 8 and the product is 136, to
which I add the 6 I carried and then the product is 142 that is 7 pound 2
shillings, therefore I set down 2 shillings and carry 7 to the pounds: then I
multiply 4 lib. by 8 and they make 32, and the 7 I carried makes 39, and so the
whole product is 39 lib. 2 shillings, lib. shil. pence 4 -- 17 -- 9 39 -- 2 -- 0
0 pence, as by the work appears: and so much is the value of 8 C. Weight; as
was required.

13. When the given price of an Integer does consist of pounds, shillings and
pence; and the price of a certain number of integers more than 10 is required;
reduce the pounds into shillings and add the shillings in the given price to
them; then proceed according to the tenth rule of this Chapter.

Example, let the price of one hundred weight be 5* lib. 18 shilling and 4
pence, and let the price of 543 be required; the pounds and shillings being
reduced to one denomination are 118 shillings; now therefore I multiply 543 by
118, and the product is 64074^ and then because 4 is the third part of a
shilling ^ divide 543 by 3 and the quotient is 181 shillings* which being added
to 64074 the whole number of shillings is 60255, which being divided by 20 the
quotient is 3212 lib. 15 shillings, 0 pence, which is the price required. ^

14. When the given price of an integer does consist of pounds, shillings and
pence, with the parts of a penny, reduce the pounds into shillings, as in the
last example; and for the pence and parts of a penny, work by the aliquot parts
of a shilling, contained in the pence, except 1 penny, and the parts annexed in
the question, if the parts of a penny be 2 farthings or more; but if it be but
one farthing proceed with the whole numbers of pence as in the former examples;
and for the farthing take one fourth of the number whose value is inquired, the
quotient divided by 12 will be the shillings and pence desired; if 2 farthings
be annexed to the pence they are with the penny not computed the eight part of
a shilling, if 3 farthings you must for the odd farthing take the sixth part of
the last quotient; all these quotients added together shall be the price
required.

Example, let the price of one hundred weight be, 3 lib. 15 shillings 7, and
let the price of 95 C. be required. The pounds and shillings being reduced unto
one denomination do make 75 shillings: by which if you multiply 95 the product
will be 71.25, and 95 divided by 4 and 3 severally, ^ the quotients are 43
shillings, 9 pence, and 31 shillings, 8 pence, and 95 divided by four for one
fourth of a penny, the quotient is 43 pence 3 farthings, which being divided by
12 the quotient is 3 shillings and 7 pence 3 farthings, which several quotients
being added to the former product, the total is 7204 shillings 0 pence 3
farthings, and this again divided by 20 gives the answer to the question, 360
lib. 4 shillings 0 pence 3 farthings.

2. Example.
^

15. When the given price of an Integer is given, and the price of many
Integers of the same name, together with one fourth, one half, or 3 fourths of
an Integer is required, the value of those Integers may be first found by some
of the precedent rules, and then for the half of an Integer take the half of
the given price, for one fourth of an Integer take one fourth of the given
price, and for 3 fourths of an Integer, take the sum of one half and one fourth
of the given price. Example, let it be required to know what 127 hundred
weight, 3 quarters, 24 pound will cost ^t 4l. 17s. 7d. per Cent. The answer by
the following operation will be 625 lib. 5 shillings 4 pence 2 farthings, and
somewhat more.

^ Where you may observe the price of 127 C. to be found after the manner of
former examples, and the 3 quarters is the sum of one half and one fourth of
the given price; then for the 24 lib. I take first the half 1 quarter of C. for
14 thereof; and the half of that for 7 pound more thereof, and for the 3 pound
remaining I take 3/7 of the price of 7 pound, thus: the price of 7 lib. is 6
shillings and a penny and something more; or 73 pence, which being multiplied
by 3, the product is 219, which being divided by 7, the quotient is 31 2/7 that
is 2 shillings 7 pence and 2/7 of a penny. And hence it is apparent, that in
resolving of questions after this practical way, some error will be committed,
yet the loss for the most part will be less than a farthing, which is not
considerable.

16. When the price of one pound weight is known, and the price of one hundred
is required (that is 112) there is a rule differing from all the former, and
somewhat more expeditious by which the value thereof may be discovered, and it
is this: Twice so many shillings as there are farthings and once so many Groats
in the price of one pound is the value of 1C. weight. Example, let the price of
one pound be 3 pence or 12 farthings,

Twice 12 shillings is 24s Once 12 groats is 4^. lib. The Total is 1 8 0

The proof is plain. 1 lib. 12 far. 112 1344 in which there are 336 pence, that
is 28 shillings.

17. By all the preceding rules, the price of one Integer being given, I have
showed how the price or value of any certain number of Integers may be found at
that rate; but for as much as the converse of this is no less necessary to be
known, I will now show how from the known price of many Integers, to find the
price or value of one.

If 123 Else cost 61 lib. 17 shillings, 6 pence, what is the price of 1 Ell:
Reduce the pounds and shillings into shillings and divide by 123, the quotient
shall be the answer to the question; thus 61 lib. 17 shillings being reduced do
make 1237 shillings, which being divided by 123 the quotient is 10 shillings,
and 7 remains, which being reduced into pence is 84, which with the 6 pence in
the question do make 90 just, which being less than the divisor I reduce into
farthings and they make 360, which being divided by 123 the quotient is 2
farthings 9268 parts of a farthing, as by the work appears.

^ But if the first term be 100, the question will be answered by Reduction
only, as if 100 Else cost 74. 13. 9d. what is the price of 1 Ell? ^

18. In the Rule of Three direct or inverse, when the Divisor with either of
the other two given numbers may be severally divided, by some common measure,
without leaving any remainer, the quotients may be taken for new terms, and
proceeding in like manner as often as is possible, the operation will be much
contracted.

Example, If 25 Yards, cost 75 pound, what shall 85 Yards cost?

y. 25 75 83 5 15 83 1 3 83 (249

Another Example, if 27 men will finish a work in 25 days, in how many days
will 15 men finish the same work? Answer in 45 days.

men days 27 25 15 9 25 5 9 5 1 (45

In the first rank you may observe, that the Divisor 15 (for the rule is
inverse) and the first term 27 being severally divided by their common measure
3, the three new terms (in the second rank) will be 9. 25. 5. Again in the
second rank, the Divisor 5 and the second term 25 being divided by their common
measure 5, the three new terms in the third rank, will be 9. 5. 1. Lastly
working with these as the Rule of Three inverse requires, the answer to the
question will be 45.

19. In the Rule of Three direct or inverse, when the Divisor and either of the
other two terms are fractions, having a common denominator, the said*
denominators may be rejected, and their numerators retained as new terms:
Example, if of an Ell cost 65 pence, what shall cost, the answer will be found
91 pence, and the work will stand as here you see.

65 5 65 7 1 13 7 (91

20. In the rule of three direct or inverse, when one of the given terms is a
fraction, if it be not the Divisor, the Divisor may be turned into a fraction
having the same denominator, or if the Divisor only be a fraction, one of the
other terms may be turned into a fraction having the same denominator; and in
either case the common denominators may be cancelled.

An Example of the first case may be this* if 12 Yards in length will make a
Cloak, the stuff or Cloth being of a Yard broad; how much Stuff of one Yard
broad will make a Cloak of the same length and compass? Answer, 9 Yards.

Rule of 3 inverse.
12 1 12 ^/4 3 12 4 36/4 or 9 Yards

An Example of the second case. If of a yard cost 16 shillings, what shall one
Yard cost? Answer

Rule of 3 direct.

CHAP. XXIV. Of the double Golden Rule.
1. IN the two last Chapters I have showed the nature of the single Golden
Rule, with the ordinary and the practical manner of working the same: I come
now to speak of the compounded Golden Rule.

2. The compounded Golden Rule or rule of Proportion is, when more than three
terms are propounded.

3. Under the compounded Golden Rule, is comprehended the double Golden Rule,
and diverse Rules of plural Proportion.

4. The double Golden Rule is, when five terms being propounded, a sixth in
proportion to them is demanded: the greatest difficulty whereof is in placing
of the terms; for which observe, as in the former Rule of Three,

1. That the first and third numbers must be both of one kind. 2. That the two
first terms in the question do consist of a supposition, and the third of a
demand.
Example, if 10^l. gain 6 pound in 12 months, how much will 65 pounds gain in 8
months?

Here you see the supposition is, If 100l. gain 6; the demand is, how much will
65 pounds gain: and therefore these terms must stand thus, ^
and the other two terms must be set under the numbers to which they have
relation, the 12 months under 100, and the 8 months under 65.

5. The terms of the question being thus placed, a resolution may be made,
either by two single Rules of Three, or by one Rule of Three compounded of the
five numbers given.

6. If you make the resolution by two single Rules of Three, you must consider,
whether the terms in both Rules be in a direct proportion or not, by observing
whether the Demand be more or less, as has been taught in the single rule of
Three; in this example they are both direct, and the proportions are,

1. As the uppermost term of the first place, is to the middle term; so is the
uppermost term of the last place to a fourth number. 2. As the lower term of
the first place, is to that fourth number, so is the lower term of the last
place to the term required.
See in the example before set down; using the lower term of the first place as
a common number in the first proportion say, If 100 pounds gain 6 pounds in 12
months, how much will 65 pounds gain, in the same time: which being a direct
proportion, the fourth term proceeding from the said 3 given numbers 100. 6. 65
is 3. 90.

Again, to find the term required, using the uppermost term of the third p^e,
as a common number in this proportion, I say, 2. If in 12 months 65 pounds gain
3. 90, how much would 65 pounds gain in 8 months, which being also a direct
proportion, the fourth proportional proceeding from the said 3 numbers given
12. 3. 90. 8. is 2. 60. So I conclude that if 100 pounds gain 6 pounds in 12
months, 65 pounds will gain 2. 60 pounds in 8 months, as you may observe by the
work. ^

7. But to resolve this question by one Rule of Three compounded of the five
numbers given, they being placed as has been already directed, you must take
the product of the two numbers in the first place for the first term; and the
product of the two numbers in the last place for the third term, then working
as in the single Rule of Three the answer will be 2. 60. as before, as by the
operation does appear. ^

8. A second question or example may be this.

If 8 Clerks write 154 sheets in 6 days, how many Clerks will write 462 sheets
in 12 days?

Here the supposition is, if 154 sheets be writ in 6 days; the demand is, in
what time 462 sheets may be writ; the terms of the question must therefore
stand thus.

Sheets Clerks Sheets. 154 8 462 (24 6 12

And then to resolve this question by two single Rules of Three, according to
the directions of the fifth Rule of this Chapter, I say: by the Rule of 3
direct,

If 154 sheets canbe writ by 8 Clerks in 6 days, How many Clerks will write 462
sheets in that time, and the fourth term proceeding from the said 3 numbers
given 154. 8. 462 is 24.

2. I say, if 24 Clerks write 462 sheets in 6 days, how many Clerks will write
the same number of sheets in 12 days? Now here more time being allowed a lesser
number of Clerks will serve to do the work; and therefore by the Rule of Three
inverse, the fourth term proceeding from the said 3 numbers given 6 24 12 is 7
12; so I conclude, if 8 Clerks write 154 sheets in 6 days, that 7 Clerks will
write* 462 sheets in 12 days, as by the work appears. ^

9. But to resolve this question by one rule of Three compounded of the five
numbers given, they being placed as before, one of the single Rules being
inverse, you must multiply the lower numbers in the first and last terms, by
the upper numbers cross wise, that is the upper number of the first term, by
the lower number of the last, and the uppermost of the last terms by the lower
of the first, and write each product under the lower term by which it is
produced; and then if the inverse proportion be found in the uppermost line
using those products as single terms, proceed to find the term required by the
single Rule of Three direct: but in case you find the inverse proportion in the
lower line, perform the work by the single Rule of Three inverse. So in this
example the terms standing as before, I multiply 154 by 12 and the product 1848
I set under 12: again I multiply 462 by 6, and the product 2772 I set under 6,
then because the inverse proportion is in the lower line, I proceed to find the
fourth term required, by the Rule of Three inverse, and find the fourth
proportion all, from the 3 given numbers 2772. 8. 1848 to be 12, as by the
following work appears. ^

But the terms of this question being so ordered as that the uppermost numbers
in the first and last places be set in the place of the lower, and the lower in
the place of the first, the inverse proportion will be found in the upper line,
and then working by 2 single rules of three, the fourth proceeding by an
inverted proportion from the said three numbers given 6. 8. 12 will be 4.

And the fourth term proceeding from the 3 given numbers 154. 4. 462 in a
direct proportion, will be 12, as by the work appears. ^

Again the resolution of this question by one rule of three compounded of the
five numbers thus placed will be by a direct proportion, because the inverted
proportion is in the first line, as by the work appears. ^

CHAP. XXV. Of the Rule of Fellowship.
1. THe Rules of plural proportion are those, by which we resolve questions,
that are discoverable by more Golden Rules than one, and yet cannot be
performed by the double Golden Rule mentioned in the last Chapter.

2. Of these Rules there are diverse kinds and varieties according to the nature
of the question propounded: for here the terms given are sometimes four,
sometimes five, sometimes more, and the terms required sometimes more than one.

3. The particular Rules of plural proportion which I shall here treat of are
these, the Rule of Fellowship, the Rule of Company, the Rule of Barter and
Exchange, and the Rule of Alligation.

4. The Rule of Fellowship is that by which in accounts amongst diverse men
(their several stocks together with the whole gain or loss being propounded)
the gain or loss of each particular man may be discovered.

5. This Rule is either single or double.

6. The single Rule of Fellowship is, when the stocks propounded do all
continue in the adventure, for equal times, that is, the one as long as the
other.

7. In the single Rule of Fellowship, the total of all the stocks must be the
first number in the Rule of Three, the whole gain or loss the second; and each
particular man's stock the third; and therefore the proportion is this.

As the whole stock is to the whole gain or loss, so is every particular man's
stock to his particular gain or loss: and by this proportion you must work as
often as there are particular stocks in the question.

Example, Three Farmers hired a Shepherd to keep their sheep, for 8 pound 15
shillings per Annum.

A committed to his care 357 sheep, B 465 and C 543, I demand how much each man
must pay of the 8 lib. 15s.

Here 357, 465 and 543 are the several stocks propounded, whose total 1365 is
the first term: 8 lib. 15s. the shepherds wages is the second, and 357 the
first man's stock, is the third term, in the first proprtion, and therefore I
say as 1365 to 8 lib. 15 shillings, or to 175s; so is 357 to

357 357 -- 45.77 465 1365 175 465 -- 59.61 543 543 -- 69.62 17500

2. Example, Four Merchants adventured to Sea a stock of 4858 pounds: A put in
2315 pounds; B put in 946 l. C put in 834 l. D put in 763 l. but the Mariners
meeting with a storm at Sea, were constrained to cast overboard as much goods
as did amount to 879 l. The Question is, what each man's loss is? The which is
thus resolved.

A. 2315 2315 -- 418.872 B. 946 946 -- 171.167 C. 834 4858 879 834 -- 150.902
D. 763 763 -- 138.066 878.997

8. The double Rule of Fellowship is, when every man's stock has a relation to
a particular; that is when every particular stock is multiplied by the time,
for which it does continue in Fellowship, and has no other difference from the
single Rule of Fellowship but only this, that the first number is the sum of
these several products, and each particular product is the third, the whole
gain or loss is the second in both Rules, and therefore the proportion to be
observed in the solution of such questions as fall under this Rule is

As the sum of the products found by multiplying each stock by its own time, is
to the whole gain or loss: so is each particular product, to its particular
gain or loss.

1 Example, A B and C hold a piece of ground in common, for which they are to
pay 36l. 10s. 6d. Into this pasture A put in 23 Oxen 27 days, B put in 21 Oxen
35 days, and C put in 16 Oxen 23 days, the question is what each man is to pay
of the said rent of 36 lib. 10s. 6 pence. First multiply each stock by its own
time, and the several products will be as follows.

Products Total lib. s. d A. 23 x 27 = 521 B. 21 x 35 = 420 1309 36. 10. 6 C.
16 x 23 = 368

And hence the particular proportions are

1309 36.525 521 14.53745 1309 36.525 420 11.71925 1309 36.525 368 10.26829
36.52499

2. Example may be this, Three Merchants company for 18 months; A put in 500l.
and at 5 months end took out 200l. and at 10 months end put in 300l. and at 14
months, cook out 130 pound. B put in 400l. and at 3 months put in more 270l.
and at 7 months took out 140l. and at 12 months put in more 100l. and at 15
months took out 99l. C put in 900l. and at 6 months took out 200l. and at 11
months put in 500l. and at 13 months took out 600 pounds, and they gained 200l:
I demand what each man's part of the gains comes to.

In Questions of this nature, two things are principally to be observed.

1. The whole time for Partnership. 2. The respective time belonging to each
man's stock. So here it is evident that the whole time is 18 months, and the
particular stocks and times belonging to each Merchant are as follows.
A 500 lib. 5 Months. 2500 8280 300 lib. 5 1500 600 lib. 4 2400 470 lib. 4 1880
B 400 lib. 3 Months. 1200 10293 670 lib. 6 4020 530 lib. 3 1590 630 lib. 3 1890
531 lib. 3 1593 C 900 lib. 6 Months. 5400 14300 700 lib. 5 3500 1200 lib. 2
2400 600 lib. 5 3000

A. 8280 8280 -- 50.376 B. 10293 32873 200 10293 -- 62.623 C. 14300 14300 --
87.001 200.000

9. The Rule of Fellowship is proved by adding the terms required, whose sum
ought to be equal to the second term in the Question, or else the whole work is
erroneous.

3 Example, There is 20 shillings to be divided amongst 4 men, of which A. is
to have, B., C. and D.. The question is what every man's share is.

To answer this question, and those of the like nature, these fractions and
must be reduced to fractions of one and the same denomination, as has been
showed in the 9th rule of the 12th Chapter; so will be equal to 120/300, will
be equal to 90/^^^, will be equal to 72/300 and will be equal to 60/300. Now
then neglecting the denominators the sum of the numerators will be, and then
the question may be resolved as here you see. 342 120 84. 72. 342. 90 63. 54.
72 240 50. 180. 60 42. 36. which being added make 240 pence.

CHAP. XXVI. Of the Rule for the exchange of Coyns, Weights and Measures.
1. THe rate and proportion between Coyns Weights and Measures of different
kinds being known, either from some good Author, or rather by experience, it
will be easy for such as understand the Rule of Three, to convert one Species
into another; when the question concerns no more than two or three sorts: but
when the comparison is made between more than three, one single Rule of three
without some other help will not resolve the question.

2. Now because there is nothing more usual with Merchants and Tradesmen, than
to exchange the Coin of one Country for the Coin of the like value in another,
and in like manner to Barter for commodities of different weights and measures,
I will here show how such exchange or Barter is to be computed, and then
especially when more is required to resolve the question, than one single Rule
of Three only.

3. The questions of this kind being all resolvable either by one single Rule
of Three, or by the Rule of Three often repeated; there needs no other
directions, than what has been already given in the Rule of Three, to wit,
that care be had to make the first and third numbers of one kind, that is, if
the first be sterling money, the third must be so too; if the first be Flemish,
the third must be Flemish. Example, How much Flemish money must be received for
340 lib. Sterling; every 20 shillings sterling being valued at 34 shillings 7
pence Flemish; here the proportion is. s. Flemish ster. Flemish As 20 34s. 7d.
340 lib. Or reducing the 34s. 7d. Flemish into a decimal. s. Flemish ster.
Flemish 1 1.729166 340 587.916440 That is 587 lib. 18 shillings 4 pence, that
is 45 lib. 12s. sterling.

Spanish Pistolet, ster. Spanish Pistolet 2. As 73/^ 1 4560/^ 6234/^^

But if the terms be placed according to the following directions, this and all
other questions of the like nature may be resolved by one single Rule of Three.

1 Spanish Pistolet = 73/^ shillings sterling. 38/^ shillings sterling = 1
Crown Genoa. 120 Crowns Genoa = Spanish Pistolets.

Which order of placing the said given numbers being observed,

2. Example, If 1 Spanish Pistolet be equal in value to 14 shillings sterlings
and 7 shillings sterling equal to 1 Crown Genoa; how many Spanish Pistolets are
equal to 120 Crowns Genoa? For the more easy resolution of this question and
all others of the like nature take these directions; set down the numbers which
make the supposition in a Column one under another; and the numbers which
answer the supposition right against them in another Column one under another
also; then consider whether it be required to find, how many pieces of the
first Coin, are equal in value to a given number of pieces of the last Coin. Or
whether it be required to find, how many pieces of the last Coin are equal in
value to a given number of pieces of the first.

In the first case place the number that makes the Question under the first
Column, under the several suppositions, and in the last case place the said
number that makes the question, in the second column, under the several numbers
that answer to the suppositions; then proceed to answer the question by the
Rule of three in this manner.

When you are to find, how many pieces of the first Com are equal in value to a
given number of pieces of the last, as in this question you are, The first term
in the Rule of Three must still be one of the numbers in the second Column; and
look how many several numbers there are there, so often must the Rule of Three
be repeated, which in the present question are two: the second and third terms
in the first Rule must be the first and second numbers in the first Column, and
the fourth term in proportion to these three numbers given must be the one of
the middle terms in the second Rule, and so continually, as often as the Rule of
Three shall be repeated: In this question, the terms of the first proportion
stand thus.

sterling Pistolet sterling Pistolets 73/5. 1. 38/5. 38/7^. And then Crown
Pistolet 1 Crown Genoa ^8/73 Pistolets that is 62 34/73 Pistolets. 120 45 60/76

But the terms being placed into two Columns according to the former
directions, this question, and all other of the like nature, how many numbers
soever there be in each Column, may be more briefly resolved thus.

Multiply all the given terms in the first Column according to the Rule of
continual Multiplication, and reserve the last product for a Dividend: again,
Multiply continually all the terms in the second Column, so shall the last
product be a Divisor, and the Quotient arising from this Dividend and Divisor,
shall be the answer desired.

In this present question the numbers in the first Column are, 1 38/5. 120. and
the product of them is 45 60/5 which being divided by 73/^ the product of the
numbers in the second Column, the Quotient is 62 ^4/^^, as before.

But if the question had been, how many pieces of the last Coin were equal in
value to a given number of the first, that is, how many Crowns Genoa were equal
to 120 Spanish Pistolets, the last number 120 Pistolets, must have been placed
in the second Column, as here you see.

1. Column 2. Column

1 Spanish Pistolet = ^3/^ shillings sterling.

3 ^/^ shillings sterling = 1 Crown Genoa.

Crown Genoa = 1^0 Spanish Pistolets.

And then to resolve this question by two Rules of Three in the ordinary way;
the first in the second Column must be the first term, in the first Rule, and
the first and second numbers in the first Column, must be the second and third
terms as before; and the fourth proportional arising from those three numbers
given, must be one of the first terms in the second, to which the second number
in the second Column must be one of the middle terms in the last proportion.

Ster. Pistolet. Ster. Pistolet. ^^/^ 1 38/5 38/75 Pistolet Crown Genoa
Pistolet Crown Genoa. 2. 78/^3 1 120/^ 23.^0/38

Note, That when the same numbers happen to be multiplicators in the Dividend
and also in the Divisor, such multiplicators may be neglected in both, and much
labor in questions of this nature may be many times saved; and then the two
proportions will be as here you see them; and how often soever the Rule of Three
must be repeated, you must proceed as in the former directions till you come to
the last, and then make the ^m fourth proportional, to be the first term in the
last Rule of three, and by that dividing the product of the second and third
terms, the quotient shall be the answer required; as by the operation it does
appear.

Or thus: Multiply 73/5. 1. 120 the numbers in the second Column continually,
so will the product be 876^/5 for a dividend, and the numbers in the first
Column 1. 38/5 being almost multiplied together the product is 38/5 for a
Divisor, and the quotient arising thence is 42^^^/^^^ or 23 20/3^.

3. Example: If 27 Ducatons Florence, be equal in value to 5 lib. 19 shillings,
3 pence sterling; and 4 lib. 5 shil. 4 pence sterling, equal to 16 Crowns at
Lions; how many Ducatons Florence are equal to 43 Crowns at Lions? The numbers
being placed according to the former directions will stand thus.

27 Ducatons = 5 lib. 19 shillings, 3 pence sterling. 4l. 5s. 4d. sterling = 16
Crowns Lions. 43 Crowns Lions = Ducatons Florence.

The which question by two Rules of Three is thus resolved.

Pence ster. Ducatons d. sterling Ducatons 1431 27 1024 19.32075 Crowns Lions
Ducatons Cr^tyons Ducatons 16 19.32075 43 ^1.9^45

Or thus: 1431 multiplied by 16, the product is 22896 and 27. 1024. 43 being
multiplied continually the product is 1188864, which being divided by the
former Product the quotient is 51.9245 Ducatons as before.

But if the question had been, how many Crowns Lions are equal to 27 Ducatons;
the second proportion would have been 19. 32075. 16. 43. 35. 60937: Or the
product of ^431. 16. 43 is 984528, and the product of 1024. 27 is 27648, by
which dividing the former product the quotient is 35. 60937.

4. Example: If Pistolet of Spain be valued at 3l. 13s. 6d. Tournois, 6l.
Tournois at 141 Flemish, 28l. 14s. 7d. Flemish at 24l. 12s. 6d. sterling, how
many Pistolets ought I to receive for 27l. 6s. 9d. sterling? Answer 98 41/^1
Pistolets. For Tournois Pistolet Tournois Pistolets 1. 147s. 1 120^. 120/147 or
40/^^ Flem. Pistolets Flem. Pistolets 2. 168/^2 40/49 689^/12 49728/^^^^^ that
is 33 74/147 Pistolets. Lastly Flem. Pistolets Flem. Pistolets 3. 1970/4
4925/147 5787/^ 48462/^^^^^^ Or 98 ^2/^^ Pistolets.

Or placing the terms according to the former directions they will stand thus.

1. Pistolet = 1764d. Tournois. 1440d. Tourn. = 168d. Flemish. 6895d. Flem. =
5910d. sterling. 17361d. ster. = Pistolets.

The product of 1764. 168. 5910 being multiplied continually is 1751440320. And
the numbers 17361.6895.1440 being multiplied continually, the product is
172373896800; which being divided by the former product, the Quotient is 98
73274544/^^5144^^ or 98 41/9^ as before.

5. Example shall be of several measures compared with one another.

Suppositions, 45 Else of Norimberg = 36 at Vienna* Suppositions, 17 Else of
Vienna = 21 at Venice Suppositions, 280 Else of Venice = 208 at Colen.
Question, 95 Else of Colen = Norimberg.

The numbers in the first Column 4517. 180.95 being multiplied continually, the
product is 130 81500. And the numbers 36.^1.208 in the second Column being also
multiplied continually the product is 157248, by which dividing the former
product, the quotient 83. 1902 is the number of Else at Norimberg, equal to 95
Else at Colen.

6. Example.
15 lib. Averdup. London. = 13 lib. Amsterdam. 60 lib. Amsterdam = 65 at
Bruges. 122 at Bruges = 145 at Dentzick. Dentzick = 112 at London. ^

7. Example, May 1. 1669. A Merchant stocked his Factor with 1000 lib. sterling
and 64 pieces of Cloth, Worcester Whites 38 Else English in every piece, and 16
shillings sterling by the Ell, all which the Factor in way of Traffic
disposes of in manner following.

942 lib. sterling = 2355 Else of Taffity London. 1547 Else Taffity = 045 Pipes
of Wine 015 Pipes of Wine = 0173 pieces of Dowlace 0138 pieces of Dowlace = 55
pieces of Holland 64 pieces of Cloth = 275 Spansh Pistolets. 198 Spanish
Pistolets = 5821 Florins. 275 Florins = 114158 lib. Flemish. 114. 158 lib.
Flem. =

November 17. 1669. The Merchant and his Factor are to come to Balance. The
question is twofold.

1. What the Factor has remaining in his hands? 2. What it is worth in pounds
sterling?
To the first the Factor is Debtor Else Imprimis for London Else of Taffity 808
Item pieces of Dowlace 35 Item pounds Sterling 58 Item pieces of Holland 55
Item Spanish Pistolets 77 Item Florins 5546 Item pounds Flemish 114. 358
To find the value of 808 Else of Taffity. Else Taffity ster. Taffity lib. 2355
942 808 323 2 sterling that is 323 lib. 4 shillings.

Then to find the value of the 35 pieces of Dowlace in pounds sterling. The
terms of the questions will stand thus.

942 lib. sterling = 2355 Else Taffity 1547 Else Taffity = 15 Pipes of Wine 15
Pipes = 173 pieces of Dowlace 35 pieces Dowlace = pounds sterling.

Here according to the Method prescribed; the four numbers in the first Column
942. 1547. 15. 35 being multiplied continually the product is 765053850, for a
dividend, and the numbers in the second Column 2555. 15. 173, being also
multiplied continually the product is 6111225 for a Divisor, and the quotient
arising from these two products is 2^. 1882 lib. sterling for the value of the
30 pieces of Dowlace.

But because that one of the numbers in the first Column is the same with one
of the numbers in the second, according to the note at the end of the second
example, that number may be neglected in both, and then the numbers in the
first Column are 942. 1547. 35, which being multiplied continually the product
is 51003590 for a Dividend, and the numbers in the second Column to be
multiplied are 2355. 173, and their product is 407415 for a Divisor, and the
quotient arising from these two numbers is 125. 1882 pounds sterling as before.

3. To find the value of the 55 pieces of Holland. The terms of the question
will stand thus.

942 lib. sterling = 2355 Else of Taffity 1547 Else of Taffity = 15 Pipes of
Wine 15 Pipes of Wine = 173 pieces of Dowlace 138 pieces of Dowl. = 55 pieces
of Holland 55 pieces of Holland = pounds sterling.

Here the 15 Pipes of Wine, and the 55 pieces of Holland may be neglected in
both Columns, and then the numbers to be multiplied in the first Column are
942. 1547. 138, and the product of them is 201103872, and the numbers in the
second Column are 2355. 173, and the product 407415 as before, and the quotient
arising from these numbers is 493. 6092 pounds sterling, which is the value of
the 55 pieces of Holland.

The Factor then has in his hands.

Imprimis ready money of the 1000l. 58.0000 Item 808 Else of Taffity worth
323*2000 Item 35 pieces of Dowlace worth 125.1882 Item 55 pieces of Holland
worth 493.6092 That is 999 lib. 19 shil. and 11 pence 999.9974
The account for the 64 pieces of Cloth which cost 30.4 pounds sterling per
piece, that is in all 1945.6 lib. ster. is thus: first then for the worth of
the 77 Pistolets.

Pistolet ster. Pist. ster. 275. 1945. 6 77 544.768

Secondly for the worth of the 5546 Florins. The terms of the question will
stand thus.

1945.6 lib. sterling = 275 Spanish Pistolets 198 Span. Pisto. = 5821 Florins
5546 Florins = lib. sterling.

Here the numbers in the first Column to be multiplied together are 1945. 6.
198. 5546, and the product is 21364789248 for the Dividend, and the numbers in
the second Column to be multiplied are 275.5821, whose product is 1600775 for
the Divisor, and the quotient arising from these two products is 1334.6528
which is the value of 5546 Florins in pounds sterling.

Lastly for the worth of 114. 158 Flemish, the terms of the question will stand
thus.

1945. 6 lib. sterling = 274 Spanish Pistolets 198 Spanish Pisto. = 5821
Florins 275 Florins. = 114. 158 lib. Flemish 114. 158 lib. Flem = pounds
sterling.

Where neglecting the 275 Pistolets in one Column and 275 Florins in the other
and 114. 158 lib. Flemish, in both, the numbers in the first Column to be
multiplied are 1945. 6 and 198, whose product is 3852288 for the Dividend, and
5821 in the other Column is the Divisor, and the quotient arising from two
numbers is 66. 1791 lib. sterling for the value of 114. 158 lib. Flem.

So that for the 64 pieces of Cloth the Factor has in his hands.

Sterling Imprimis 77 Pistolets worth 544. 7680 Item 5546 Florins worth 1334.
6528 Item 114. 158 lib. Flemish, worth 66. 1791 And the balance is 1945. 5999
CHAP. XXVII. The Rule of Aligation.
1. ALligation is an Art, by which we resolve questions that concern the mixing
of diverse simples together.

2. Alligation is twofold Medial, and Alternate.

3. Alligation Medial is, when the several quantities and rates of diverse
simples being, we find out a mean rate for which a mixture made of these
simples may be afforded: to effect this, the sum of the quantities being given
with the value of all the simples, the proportion is.

As the sum of the quantities

Is to the value of all the simples,

So is any part of the mixture propounded

To the mean rate that is required.

Example: let 12 Gallons of Canary at 4 shil. the Gallon, 36 Gallons of Sherry
at 3 shillings the Gallon, and 52 Gallons of White Wind, at 2 shillings 8 pence
the Gallon be mixed together; and let the price of one Gallon of that mixture be
required. The sum of 12, 36 and 52 Gallons is 100 Gallons: and the value of 12
Gallons of Canary at 4 shillings or 48 pence by the Gallon is 576d. the value
of 36 Gallons of Sherry at 3 shil. or 36 pence is 1296d. and the value of 52
Gallons of White Wind at 2 shillings 8 pence the Gallon, or 32 pence is 1664
pence; and all these values added together do make in the whole, 3536d. Now
then by the Rule of Three.

100. 3536 1 35 36/104 that is 35 pence, and 36 hundreds of a penny.

For proof of the work, compare the total value of the several simples, with
the value of the whole mixture; if their sums agree the work is true as in this
example.

l s d The value of 12 Gallons of Canary at 4 shillings per Gallon is 2 08 00
The value of 36 Gallons of Sherry at 3 shillings the Gallon is 5 08 00 And the
value of 52 Gallons of White Wine at 2 shil. 8 pence the Gallon is 6 18 08 All
which amount to 14 14 08

And the value of 100 Gallons at 35d. and 36 hundreds of a penny by the Gallon
is 14 14 08 as before.

5. Alligation Alternate is, when several rates of diverse simples being given,
such a mixture is required, as may be sold at a certain mean rate propounded.

6. Alligation Alternate is either partial or total.

7. Alternation partial is, when the several rates of diverse simples, with the
quantity of one of them is given, and the several quantities of the rest are
required, in such sort that a mixture being made according to the given
quantities, and the quantities so found, that mixture may bear a certain rate
propounded.

8. Alternation total is, when the total quantity of all the simples with their
several rates being given, we find out their several quantities, in such sort,
as that a mixture of them being made according to the quantities so found, that
mixture may bear a certain mean rate propounded.

9. In both these kinds of alternation, there is some preparation to be made,
before the Rules by which such questions may be resolved can be well delivered.

10. The preparation to be made does partly consist in placing the given rates
of the things propounded and taking the differences between those rates, and
the mean price you would have them bear.

11. The given rates of the things propounded must be placed one under another
so as that they may orderly increase or decrease, and the mean price that you
would have them bear, may stand on the right hand of the rank about the middle:
For example, let the given rates be 12. 24. 36. 48. and the mean price 28d.
which being placed one under another descending I ^
draw a line of connection, and on the left hand thereof I set 28 by the mean
price by it self, as here you see. The terms being thus ranked in their due
order, link them together by certain arches, in such sort, as that one that is
greater than the mean price, may be still coupled with another that is less, so
in the premised example 12 may be linked with 36 or 48, and 24 may be linked
with 48 or 36, and the work will stand thus. ^ or thus ^

The terms being thus ranked and linked together, proceed to find the
differences, between the given rates and the mean price, and write that
difference just against his respective yoke fellow: thus the difference between
12 and 28 being 16, I place 16 against 48 its respective yoke fellow; and the
difference between 24 and 28 being 4, I place 4 against 36: the difference
between 28 and 36 being 8, I place 8 against 24: lastly 20 being the difference
between 28 and 48, I place 20 against 12, and the work will stand according to
the first way of linking the rates propounded, as here you see them.

But the branches being linked after the other manner the differences must be
otherwise placed; for here 24 has 48 for his Yoke Fellow, and 12 has 36 for
his. ^


12. And many times it so falls out, that one of the given rates, may be linked
with two or more of the other rates given, in which case the differences ought
to be as often set down, as it is or may be diversely linked: thus in the
premised rates given, if you change the mean price to 16, the rates must be
linked and the differences set as here you see them: or being 40 thus. ^
^

13. The given rates being thus ranked and linked and their differences taken,
all questions in Alternation partial may be resolved by this proportion.

As the difference against the first rate

Is to the several differences that are under it,

So is the quantity propounded

To the several quantities that are required.

Example, Suppose a man were to mix 10 bushels of Wheat at 48 pence the bushel,
with Rye at 36d. the bushel, Barley at 24 pence the bushel, and Oats at 12d.
the bushel, so that the whole mixture may be sold at 28d. the bushel, the
question is, how much Rye, how much Barley, and how much Oats ought to be added
to the 10 bushels of Wheat. It is evident by the differences before taken, that
for every 16 bushels of Wheat, I ought to take 4 bushels of Rye, 8 bushels of
Barley, and 20 bushels of Oats, and therefore I say

1. As 16. 4. 10. 28/^^ 2. As 16. 8. 10. 5 3. As 16. 20. 10. 128/^^
And from hence it appears that 2 bushels and a half of Rye, 5 bushels of
Barley, and 12 bushels and a half of Oats being put to 10 bushels of Wheat,
when these several sorts of grain do bear the prices as in the 11 rule, may be
sold one with another for 28 pence, or 2 shillings and 4 pence the bushel.

Or the differences being taken according to the second way of linking them
expressing the same rule, I say

1. As 4. 16. 10. 40 bushels of Rye. 2. As 4. 20. 10. 50 bushels of Barley. 3.
As 4. 8. 10. 10. 20 of Oats, and a mixture being made according to these
proportions, the whole may be sold at 2 shilling 4 pence the bushel.
14. In Alternation partial, the proof is* likewise by comparing the total
value of the several simples, with the value of the whole mixture: so in the
last example of the former rule, the total value of 10 bushels of Wheat 40
bushels of Rye, 50 bushels of Barley and 20 bushels of Oats amounts to 14
pound, which is also the value of the whole mixture at 2 shillings and 4 pence
the bushel.

15. In Alternation total, the several rates and mean price, being so placed,
and their differences taken as has been showed, all questions belonging
thereto may be answered by this proportion.

As the sum of all the differences

Is to the total quantity of all the simples;

So is the correspondent difference of each rate

To the respective quantity of the same rate.

Example, A Goldsmith having diverse sorts of gold, viz. some of 24 Caracts
fine, some of 22 Caracts, some of 18 Caracts and some of 16 Caracts fine, is
desirous to melt of all these sorts, so much together, as may make a Mass
containing 60 Ounces of 21 Caracts fine. The numbers being placed and
differenced as has been showed, and is here expressed, I say ^ 1. As 12. 60.
5. 25 Ounces. 2. As 12. 60. 3. 15 Ounces. 3. As 12. 60. 1. 5 Ounces. 4. As 12.
60. 3. 15 Ounces.


Whereupon I do conclude that 25 ounces of 24 Carects fine, 15 ounces of 22
Carects, 5 ounces 'of 18 Carects, and 15 ounces of 16 Carects fine, being all
melted together, will produce a Mass of Gold containing 60 ounces of 21 Carects
fine, as was required in the question propounded.

16. Here the work is true, when the sum of the quantities found are equal to
the total quantity propounded: thus in the preceding example, the quantities
found were 25. 15. 5. 15. which being added together do make 60, and the
quantity propounded was 60 also.

17. When a question in Alligation Alternate does consist of three ingredients,
it is capable of an infinite Series of Affirmative and Negative answers* and
when the question does consist of more than three ingredients, it is capable of
as many infinite Series of affirmative and negative solutions, as you please to
impose upon it.

18. In Alligation Alternate consisting of three ingredients, (their values or
prices being orderly placed, and the differences between them being taken as
has been already showed) if you take the difference of every two values, and
place them against the third, you shall constitute two continual addends, and
one continual subducend, that is, the two continual addends are outmost, and
the continual subducend is inmost; or if you please, you may let the two
outmost be continual subducends, and then the inmost will be a continual
addend: or any three numbers in the same proportion will effect the same thing:
but it is best to take the three least numbers, that be in the same ratio: for
example, let the value or prices of the three ingredients be 12. 24. 36, and
let the mean price be 16, these prices being orderly placed, and the
differences between them and the mean price will be as here you see them. ^

Now then deducting 12 from 24 the difference is 12, which I place against 36,
toward the left hand, and the difference between 24 and 36 is 12 also, which I
place against 12, lastly the difference between 12 and 36 is 24, which I place
against 24, and because these differences are large and so not so convenient
for this work, I reduce them to the least numbers in the same proportion, and
then they are 1. 2. 1. the two outmost to wit 1. and 1. shall first be
continual addends, and the inmost or middle number, to wit 2, let be a
continual subducend, and then some of the many answers that might be given to
this question will be these following.

^ Of which the first is affirmative and the two last negatives, but makes the
two outmost to wit 1 and 1 to be continual subducends, and the inmost to wit 2
a continual addend; the answers to this question will be these following.

1 16 12 28 27 26 25 24 23 + 2 24 4 6 8 10 12 14 1 36 4 3 2 1 0 1 36 36 36 36
36 36

And thus you may proceed in Infinitum: but the negative answers, being
improper and of no use in practice, it will be sufficient to go as far as they
are affirmative and proper, taking still something of each ingredient in the
question.

19. In Alligation Alternate consisting of more than three ingredients, having
set down the several prices, and taken the difference between them, and the
mean price, you may constitute your runners from any three that are together,
and keep the other proportions for standing numbers; thus the prices of 4
Ingredients being 48. 36. 24. 12, and the mean price 16, the prices and
differences will be.

^ And the runners for the three lower prices will be 1. 2. 1. as before and
therefore, the answers these following.

+ 1 16 48 4 4 4 2 36 4 5 6 + 1 24 4 2 0 12 60 61 62 72 72 72 1 16 48 4 4 4 4 +
2 36 4 3 2 1 1 24 4 6 8 10 12 60 59 58 57 72 72 72

20. In Alligation Alternate the prices of several ingredients being given,
with the total quantity and value thereof, the several quantity of each
ingredient may be otherwise found in this manner: let A. B. C. represent the
prices of three ingredients, and let S. be equal to the proposed quantity of
those ingredients, and F. the value of that quantity: moreover let H. represent
the difference between A and B, let K represent the difference between B and C,
then multiply the proposed quantity represented by S by the price of the middle
ingredient represented by B, and to the product add the difference represented
by K continually, until the difference represented by H being continually added
to the value of the quantity propounded represented by F, shall make those
numbers to be equal: which being done, the number must be reserved for a common
Dividend, I call it D. The unknown quantities of A B and C, I call X. Y. Z, now
then to find X, deduct F from D and divide the remainer by H.

And to find Z deduct B S from D, and divide the remainer by K, the quotients
shall be X and Z, and Y must be the complement of them to S.

Example, suppose the prizes of three ingredients were A 5. B 7. C 10, the
proposed quantity S 50, and the value of that quantity F 307, S 50 being
multiplied by B 7 the product is B S 350, the difference between B7 and C 10 is
K 3, which must be added continually unto B S 350; the difference between A 5
and B 7 is H 2 which must be added continually unto F 307, which being done the
common Dividend will be D 353, as by the work appears.

In this continual addition, you must ^
keep the least side going first, till both be equal. But if both sides will
not be equal by the continual addends, which will fall out in these two cases

1. When both addends are equal, 2. When one side runs on with continually odd
numbers and the other with continual even, you must make them even by taking a
part of one of the continual addends: here the common Dividend is D 353; from
whence deducting F 307 the remainer is 46, which being divided by H 2 the
quotient is X 23.

Again from D 353 deducting B S 350, the remainer is 3, which being divided by
K 3 the quotient is Z 1. Now the complement of these two quotients unto S 50 is
Y 26: the work and proof will stand thus. ^

And to constitute the runners, the difference between A 5 and B 7 is 2, which
I place against C 10, the difference between B 7 and C 10 is 3, which I place
against A 5, and the difference between A 5 and C 10 is 5, which I place
against B 7; and by adding and subducting these runners to and from X. Y. Z.
some of the many answers are these following.

+ 3 A 5 X 23 26 29 32 35 38 - 5 B 7 Y 26 21 16 11 6 1 + 2 C 10 Z 01 03 05 07 9
11 S 50 50 50 50 50 50

21. In Alligation Alternate when the prizes of more than three ingredients are
given, you may set by any three at pleasure, and upon the prizes remaining you
may impose any part of the whole quantity propounded, less than the sum of the
other unknown quantities, and upon the value any sum less than the value of the
other unknown quantities, and let the sum of the three quantities set by, be
the complement of the sum of all the unknown quantities propounded; and the
value of those three quantities be the complement of the value of the whole
quantity propounded; this done you may proceed with the three prices set by as
was before directed.

Example, let the given prices of the several ingredients be, A 2, B 3, C 5, D
7, E 10, and let the sum of all their quantities be S=80, the value of all that
sum F 380; now then setting by C 5, D 7, E 10, impose upon A 2 for its
quantity, T 17, and upon B 3, V 13, both these quantities being deducted from
S8 oath remainer will be X+Y+Z=50

Then multiply T 17 by A 2, the product will be A T = 34, and V 13 by B 3, the
product will be B V 39, and these two products being deducted from F 380, the
remainer is the value of C X + D Y + E Z = 307: but the particular quantities
of X Y Z and their particular values were before found to be as are here
expressed.

X 23 C X = 115 Y 26 D Y = 182 Z 01 E Z = 10 S 50 F 307

The which with their runners will stand thus,

2 T = 17 17 17 17 17 17 3 V = 13 13 13 13 13 13 + 3 5 X = 23 26 29 32 35 38 -
5 7 Y = 26 21 16 11 06 01 + 2 10 Z = 01 03 05 07 09 11 80 80 80 80 80 80

Or placing two sets of runners thus.

- 2 2 T = 17 15 13 11 09 07 + 3 3 V = 13 16 19 22 25 28 + 3 5 X = 23 25 27 29
31 33 - 5 7 Y = 26 21 16 11 06 10 + 2 10 Z = 01 03 05 07 09 11 80 80 80 80 80

If you would have the unknown quantities to be all affirmatives, it is
absolutely necessary, that the sum of all the quantities being divided by the
sum of the unknown quantities, the quotient be less than the greatest, and
greater than the least of the given prices; which quotient is the mean price,
for which the mixture may be afforded.

22. By this last way of working such questions as do belong to Alligation
Alternate, may such sporting questions be also answered, which some refer to
the Rule called Ceres and Virginum; such as are these two questions following.

1. Quest. A Maid being sent to Market to buy fowl did with 20 pence buy 20
Birds, Larks for farthings a piece, Pigeons for halfpence, and Chickins for
groats; The question is how many she bought of a sort?

To answer this question I place the names of the birds with their several
prices in this manner.

A 1 L. 2 2 80 B 2 P. 15 30 C 16 C. 3 48 80

Then I multiply the number of Birds, to wit 20 by 2 the middle price, and the
product is 40, and the 20 pence reduced to farthings make 80; then H=B-A viz. 1
I place under 80 the whole value o^ expense, and K=C-B viz. 14 I place under 40
80 14 1 54 81 28 1 82 82 40 the product of B S as here you see: then deducted
54 from 81 the difference is 27, and twice 14 is 28, which being added to 54
the total is 82; so then twice H being added to F 80, makes that also to be 82,
now then I say that the Maid bought 2 Larks and 3 Chickens which are 5, and by
consequent 15 Pigeons, the truth whereof does thus appear; 2 Larks make 2
farthings, 15 Pigeons 30 farthings, and 3 Chickens 48 farthings which being
added together do make 80 the sum expended.

2. Question, A Gardener paid 20 persons 20 shillings, to every man 20 pence,
to every woman 15 pence, to every boy 8 pence: The question is how many men,
how many women and how many Boys?

To answer this question, I place the persons with their several rates or wages
thus.

A 8 M 10 80 240 B 15 W 8 120 C 20 M 2 40

Then I multiply the number of persons, viz. 20 by 15 the middle price, and the
product is B S 300, and the 20 shillings being reduced to pence do make F 240,
H=B-A viz. 7 I place under F 240, and K=C-B viz. 5 I place under B S 300; he
difference between these two numbers is 60, now 10 times 7 makes 70 which being
added to F 240 the sum is 310, and twice 5 being added to B S 300 the sum is
310 also, now then D 310-F 240=70 which being divided by H=7 quotes 10 for the
number of the Boys, and D-310 B S 300=10 being divided by K 5 quotes 2 for the
number of men, both which make I 2, and therefore the number of women must be 8
as by the work appears.

And here you may observe that so often as you add H to F so much or so many you
must take of the lowest prices, and so often as you add K to B S, so much or so
many you must take of the greatest price, and what these two do want of the
whole number, must be the number or quantity of the third; if there be more
ingredients propounded you must proceed as was before directed.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of the Rule of False.
1. HItherto we have spoken or treated of positive Arithmetic; Negative now
follows, otherwise called the Rule of false position, in which by false terms
supposed, we have a means afforded by which to discover the true terms required.

2. The Rule of false Position, is either single or double.

3. The Rule of single position is, when by one false Position, we may discover
the true resolution of the question propounded.

Example, suppose 400l. were to be distributed among three persons, of which
the second man is to have three times as much as the first, and the third four
times as much as the second, the question is, how much of the 400l. must be
given to each person? Here you may suppose any sum at pleasure, and fit the
proportions to it according to the state of the question: by this sum so
stated, a means will be afforded to answer the question propounded, though the
supposition does not do it. Say then that the first man had 3 pound, the second
man must then have 9 pound, and the third 36 pound, and these three sums in the
total are but 48 pound, and yet by this false supposition, we may by the Rule
of Three find out the true answer to the question propounded.

For as 48 3 so 400 25 9 75 36 300 48 400

The first man then had 25l. the second 75l. and the third 300l; the which sums
do together make 400l. as was propounded.

4. The Rule of double position is, when two false positions are propounded, by
which to discover the true resolution of the question.

5. In this Rule one supposition must be made at pleasure, and examined
according to the state of the queston, whether you have guest right or not.

If this supposition do not answer the question, observe whether your error be
in the excess, or in the defect. Then make another supposition and examine this
second position as you did that first, and if this be also false, observe again
whether the error of this supposition be in that excess or in the defect, that
is, whether you did suppose too much or too little; for these errors will
either be both too much, or both too little, or one too much and the other too
little, and according to this diversity of the errors, a diverse manner of
working must be used for the resolution of the question propounded.

6. If the errors of both suppositions, be both too little or both too much,
deduct the less from the greater, and note the remainer for your Divisor; then
multiply the first position by the error of the second, and the second position
by the error of the first, and deduct the lesser product from the greater, the
remainer being divided by the difference of the errors, shall in the quotient
give you the true answer of the question propounded. Example, if from the half
of a certain sum of money I take away another half, and also a fourth, leaving
13 pound, how much was the whole sum? To resolve this question, first I suppose
the whole sum to be 40 pound, from the half whereof to wit 20 pound, I deduct
another half that is ten pound and there remains 10, and also a fourth of 20
pound, and then there remains 5 pound, whereas the remainer should have been
13 pound, therefore this error is in the defect 8.

Secondly I suppose the whole sum to be 64 pound the half whereof is 32, and
the half of that is 16 and the fourth 8, and the remainer also 8, and therefore
the second error is also in the defect, and the defect is 5. the which being
placed as here you ^
see cross-wise with the errors under each position. I multiply the first
position 40 by the second error 5, and the product is 200: then I multiply the
second position 64 by the first error 8, and the product is 512; and the lesser
product being deducted from the greater the remainer is 312, which being
divided by 3 the quotient is 104 the number sought, whose half is 52, and the
half of that 26, and the fourth of 52, 13, and the remainer 13 also as was
required.

7. If the errors in your suppositions, be one too much and the other too
little, add both the errors together, and the whole shall be your Divisor;
then multiply your first position by your second error, and your second
position by your first error as before; the sum of these products being divided
by the sum of the errors shall in the quotient give you the answer to the
question.

2. Example, the same question being again propounded, for my first supposition
I take 56 pounds, the half whereof is 28, and the half of 28 is 14, and the
fourth 7, and so the first error is 6 in the defect; And for my second position
I take 128 pound, the half whereof is 64, and half of that is 32, and the
fourth 16, and so the second error is 3 too much, the sum of ^
these errors is 9: now the first position 56 being multiplied by 3 the second
error, the product is 168, and the second position 128 being multiplied by the
first error 6 the product is 768, the sum of these two products is 936, which
being divided by 9 the sum of the errors, the quotient is 104, the answer to
the question as was desired.

And thus we have passed through all the chief parts of Natural Arithmetic,
(the extraction of the square and cube roots only excepted, and that purposely
omitted, because it may be not only more briefly but also more plainly showed,
in Specious or Symbolical Arithmetic) and as for artificial or Logarithmetical
Arithmetic, so much as may serve to resolve all ordinary questions, has been
already showed in my scale of interest, only the construction of the numbers
themselves is there omitted, which yet I have showed by the continual
extraction of the square Root in my Mathematical institution, and by
multiplication in my Trigonometria Britanica; since which, there are some
excellent ways of making those numbers lately found out and published in Latin
by Nicholas M^rc^tor: so much whereof as may give thee satisfaction in that
particular. I purpose God willing, to add to a small introduction to Specious
Arithmetic, if the Author himself find not encouragement or opportunity to do
it in english himself; and that I be not suddenly prevented in the other, by
some skilful hand, whose zeal for propagating the knowledge of the Arts in our
own tongue, is at least equal to, if not exceeding mine.

Soli Deo Gloria.
