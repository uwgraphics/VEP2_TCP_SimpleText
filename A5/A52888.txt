A NEW BALLAD To the praise of JAMES D. of Monmouth.
He once was great,
And to this Land did bring
Triumphant Bays
And Lautel to his KING.

To the Tune of Now, now it is in vain.
NOtwithstanding the Frowns
That descends from the Crown,
On my Lord that once was so dear,
Preferred above other,
Undone by a Brother,
And the hate of an Uncle so near;
Yet let them tread on,
And end as begun,
My Love it shall never withdraw;
But in spite of all Fate
In him I Will delight,
For Monmouth's the flower of them all.
Of great Places at Court,
Turned him out for their Sport,
Pretending that he soared too high;
Or fearing he might
At last claim a Right,
Became a great Beam in their Eyes
Cause the Mobely ran,
And admired him each Man,
And Welcomed him with a Hazza,
For who can do less
Than love whom they Bless?
For Monmouth's the flower of them all
These Monsters of Rome
They first hatched his doom,
Because that he stood in their way,
And stopped their carrire
When their Plots did appear
To make our Religion their Prey.
Those other great Lords
Are now all abhorred,
And termed as great Monsters as he,
By that Tory Crew
Who has nothing to do
But to Scandel brave Monmouth's Degree.
May they Shimie like
In Cursing Delight,
Till the Fall on their own Heads Rebound,
And he like the Palms
Suppressed, firmer stand,
And the higher ascend from the Ground:
For who can he be
That Is so happy as he,
Who smilingly can so forgive,
The abuses of Late
Received from the State,
Brave Monmouth be happy and Live.
For the Heavens may grow clear
And Great Charles appear,
With the smiles of a Father as before;
As he promised to me
He Ever would be
And he my Great Monmouth Restore.
To his Places of State
That he may be Great,
And his Enemies unmasked be,
Who Is Endeavored to bring
Him in disgrace with his King,
Brave Monmouth I love none but thee.
May thy Royal Father
Sway the Scepter for Ever,
And flourishing Govern this I and,
May the Turks and the Athiests,
Presbyterians and Papists,
Turn one and in Unity stand;
Then shall be firm Peace,
From our Jars we shall Cease,
In Church Government when we agree,
And in the mean time,
May the Crown keep the Line;
Brave Monmouth we hapier shall be.
FINIS.
