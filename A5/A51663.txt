My Dog and I.
We Write no Fights of Dutch or French,
No courting of a handsome Wench,
No Monsters, Wonders in the Air,
No persons dying in despair;
Nor any thing under the Sky,
But only of my Dog and I.
Tune is, My Dog and I: Or, Bobbing Ione,


YOu that are of the merry Throng,
Give good attention to my Song,
He give you weighty reasons why,
It Is made upon my Dog and I,
My Dog and I, my Dog and I,
It Is made upon my Dog and I.
I of no dogged nature am,
But loving, gentle, kind and tame,
And have no bigger Family,
But only two, my and I,
My Dog, etc.
I lived at home, I lived at large,
A single life, and had no charge,
And if a Wench I chanced to spy,
Thither went my Dog and I.
My Dog, etc.
I loved a maid her name was Nell,
A bonny Lass, I loved her well,
If you would needs know the reason why,
Because she loved my Dog and I.
my Dog, etc.
My Dog and I have got a trick,
It is to cure maids when they are sick,
When the'r sick and like to die,
Then thither goes my Dog and I.
My Dog, etc.
But if the weather prove foul and wet,
My Dog he shall not wet his feet;
But if the weather prove fair and dry,
Then a whiffing goes my Dog and I.
My Dog and I, my Dog and I,
Then a whiffing goes my Dog and I.




If any maiden troubled be,
With overgrown Virginity,
I quickly can two pills apply,
Concealed by my Dog and I,
My Dog and I, my Dog and I,
Concealed by my Dog and I.
If the Green Sickness have possessed,
A dainty dapper Damsels breast,
Ilee cure her on it immediately,
With nothing but my Dog and I,
My Dog, etc.
If Women are in a distress,
By reason of their Barrenness,
I can a proper Prove apply,
Best known unto my Dog and I,
My Dog, etc.

Can give a woman remedy,
But if they up to threestore fly,
Their's no game for my Dog and I,
My Dog, etc.
When Mars commanded, we did go,
Unto the wars in forty two,
We Will never fear in field to die,
But out we will go, my Dog and I,
My Dog, etc.
There was a time when Rebel rout,
did fear Prince Rupert and his Dog,
it is dangerous when two heads comply
Especially my Dog and I,
my Dog, etc.
We night and day do take no rest,
If we can hear of any feast,
And where good fellows I espy,
There go in my Dog and I,
My Dog, etc.
My living lies in every Nook,
My Dog is Caterer and Cook,
For he at every Game can fly,
No fellow to my Dog and I,
My Dog, etc.
My Dog to play the Pimp is taught,
I fear it is many a gallants fault,
Near Hatton wall such whores do lie,
Are fitter for my Dog than I,
My Dog, etc.
Thus have we lived, thus have we loved,
And faithful to each other proved,
Whilst many thieves are hanged on high,
No Law can touch my Dog and I,
My Dog, etc.
If death do come as it may hap,
By grave shall be under the Lap,
With folded arms there will we lie,
Cheek by Iowl my Dog and I,
My Dog and I, My Dog and I,
Cheek by Jowl my Dog and I.
FINIS.
