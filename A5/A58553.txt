all Confessions of Parties, after they have received an Indictment in the Case
of Treason against the Kings Person, or Government allenarlie, emitted before
the Commissioners of Justiciarie sitting in Judgment, and subscribed by the
Pannal, or by the said Judges, in the Case where the Pannal owns the
Confession, as it is reduced in Writ, and yet either cannot, or refuses to
subscribe, shall be considered as a Judicial Confession: and shall be as
probative to Assizes, as if the same had been emitted in presence of the
Assize, notwithstanding of the 90th Act of the 11th Parliament of King James
the Sixth; and that if Assizers Assoilie notwithstanding of such Confessions,
They shall be liable to a Process of Error; and this Law to be of force only to
the next Session of Parliament. And the said 90th Act of the 11th Parliament of
King James the Sixth, is to continue in its full force, as to all the rest of
its Tenor and Contents.
