THE STONE ROLLED AWAY, AND LIFE more ABVNDANT.
JOHN 14.1, 2. Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also
in me. In my Fathers house are many Mansions.


ROMANS 10.17. Faith comes by hearing; The Introduction.
I dare not therefore distrust your attention; So, your heavenly Redeemer
prepare for each of you a Mansion in his Fathers house, as ever ye believe,
that, where His Gospel is preached, there the Power of his Spirit is present to
heal. Even so, Lord Jesus; Time was when the Deuteronomy. 32.8.
Dew, the Pro. 16.21.
Sweetness of Pro. 10.32.
thy blessed lips, once Can. 4.11.
dropped, once Psalm. 45.2.
graced, as well this Text of mine, as other thy Gospels: Oh, that now, (while
it is called to day) the Inspirations, the Breathings of thy Holy Spirit, would
vouchsafe to sanctify, would vouchsafe to bless unto us, as well this
Discourse of mine, as other thine Ordinances.

Beloved, The Method.
that the Sun of Righteousness may at this time delight to arise upon us with
healing in his wings, it is at this time my Duty, therefore to explain these
words, that I may profitably apply them.

First, 1. The Explication of the Text.
then,

Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God: believe also in me. In my
Fathers house are many Mansions. The manner how delivered.


Words all Gospel, and all Epistle, (I mean) full of Doctrines, and full of
Uses too; Words full of Passion, and as full of Compassion; spoken to the
heart, yea and from the heart too; unexpectedly ushered in, and as abruptly
uttered forth. Let not your heart be troubled; A Reproof smiting friendly, a
Reproof pouring out excellent Psalm. 1^1.5. Oil though soft and smooth, yet
fetches out the poison which lies in the stomach. B. Rey^o'ds in his Rich
Man's Charge. p. 7.
oil. Ye believe in God, believe also in me; An Exhortation clothed with
Instruction, clothed with Evangelical Instructions. In my Fathers house are
many Mansions; A Consolation, a strong consolation, a strong consolation far
fetched, fetched even from the highest heavens.

Beloved, The Party speaking.
ye may know the man from his manner of Communication; Surely, the Hand, nay
the Heart of Jesus is in all this? It is so. Compare this verse with that next
above; The same Jesus which answers there, Thou shall deny me thrice; the
same Jesus answers here, Let not your heart be troubled.

The Party speaking we know; Jesus we know; The Persons spoken to.
but, Who are ye? (your heart?) Answ. Some Greek Copies prefix (...), He says
unto his Disciples; Imagine, that Varia lectio Apocryphal, admit it not the
Dictate of the Holy Ghost, but the Annotation of some busy Transcriber:
Nevertheless more then manifest it is, c. 13.22, 35.
who The persons here spoken unto, are: They prove themselves to be Disciples,
Disciples of Christ, the chief of the Disciples of Christ, all twelve of them,
excepting c. 13 30.
Judas, one not worthy the looking after.

The Disciples spoken to, we see; Jesus speaking, The occasion of Christ's
speaking here.
we hear But, Upon what occasion speaks he? Answ. S. Chrysostom, and (from
him) Theophylact, they, therefore repute these former words one Argument of
Christ's divine nature, for that, then when his Disciples here stood silent, He,
of Himself, perfectly knew the secret troubles of their heart. But (saving the
esteem due unto so great Fathers) that Jesus Christ was as well God as man, the
latter clause of this verse Plscator in locum.
better proves; and, that Jesus knew all things, other Scriptures sufficiently
declare; we need not to discompose this Text. Were no other causes manifest,
yet one plain and visible reason, wherefore the hearts of the Disciples should
be the less troubled, may be Maldonat. in locum.
derived from Christ's approaching Resurrection, or rather from his approaching
Ascension.

That our Redeemer here looks quite thorough his Resurrection unto the hour
of his ascending, I demonstrate from c. 13.33. from c. 13.1. and from this c.
14.1, 2.

1. From, 1 Proof from c. 13.33.
Whether I go, ye cannot come. They could drink Mat. 20.23.
of Christ's bitter cup, could be baptized, could be plunged into a Phil. 3.10.
fellowship of his sufferings; but unto the Heavens whither he now went, they
could not now come; neither their souls, while they abode in the flesh; nor
their bodies, until the general resurrection.

2. 2 Proof from c. 13.1.
The hour was come wherein Jesus should go not only out of the world, but to
the Father. All Divines own a difference between that measure of joy which
departed souls now receive, and that consummation of bliss, which they shall
finally participate together with their glorified bodies: But some very learned
Interpreters critically distinguish between that Vide, sis Grotium in Lucae
23.43.
part of Heaven, wherein blessed souls do now abide, and that whereunto (say
they) the same souls shall at the time of the Restitution of all things be
everlastingly exalted. They tell us, That S. Paul's 2 Cor. 12.24.
Paradise was inferior to his third heaven; they affirm, That, during Christ's
death, Christ's soul was only (as the Jews call it) in Luke 23 43.
Paradise; and (as others phrase it). (...), Fuit dives quidem (...) sed sait
(...) etiam Lazarus; nam and Paradisus, and Gehenna, and Elysin, and Taitara
sunt (...). Grot. in Lucae 16.23.
in some blessed estate, but not in that third heaven whereunto they yield that
Jesus then ascended, when he went unto the Father. For my part, so often as I
contemplate the Father Isa. 57.15.
inhabiting the highest heavens, the Son Joh. 14 28.
ascending to the Father, and S^ Paul, even at his 3 Cor. 5.8. Phil. 1.23.
dissolution, reckoning to be present with the Son, I can leave these great
Authors sporting themselves, Job 41. Psalm. 104.26.
Leviathan-like, in their profound depths. Wherefore, I will not urge, that
suppose Christ did indeed ( Luke 23 43.) content himself with some lower part
of heaven, yet he, John 13.1. climbed the highest heavens; no, I leave these
Critics unto their own Paradise. What I insist upon, is, That mention is Joh.
13.1.
here made, not barely of Christ's Departing out of this world, but expressly
also of his going to his Father. Jesus Ibid.
knowing that the hour was come wherein he should depart out of the world unto
the Father, he c. 14.1.
says unto his Disciples, Let not your heart be troubled.

3. 3 Proof from c. 14.1, 2, 3.
That our compassionate Redeemer here eyeth his Ascension, we find within the
Suburbs of my Text, while he says, I go to prepare a place for you. True,
Christ's burial prepares a place for us, makes our graves a bed of rest,
streweth this Mrs. Rutter.
Saints Bride-bed with roses, sweetneth her Sepulcher with spices: His
Grave-cloaths may well Herbert in his Temple: a Poem which Mrs. R. very much
affected.
wipe present tears from our eyes: but a blind man may here see, that our
blessed Savior here reports himself not unto his going down unto the bowels
of the earth, but unto his ascending up unto the Mansions of his Father, viz.
Hereafter Christ c. 14.3, 30.
would not talk much with his Disciples; though he was not yet B. anarows Sermon.
on John 20.17.
ascending, yet a B. anarows Sermon. on John 13.33.
little while, and he leaves them; Wherefore, what he has to say, that he B.
anarows Sermon. on John 14.2.16.1.
speaks beforehand: I say, so full of bowels are the loving kindnesses of
Christ Jesus, that he Maldonat in c. 14.1.
anticipateth his Disciples thoughtfulness; although with himself it was not as
yet Good Friday, with them he makes it Ascension day; He leads their
troubles captive, Let not your heart be troubled. He prepares for them the
gift of Faith, Ye believe in God, believe also in me. He sends their thoughts
on high, In my Fathers house are many Mansions.

I should darken Counsel by words without knowledge, The Troubles spoken of.
should I cite Christ's determined Ascension as the only reason of this his
Dehortation: whether we examine the subsequent, or preceding, the immediate, or
remote Contexts, from all these clear Vide, sis Erasm. Tinnum, Malorat. etc. in
locum.
it is, That at what time our Savior now spoke, there were visible
distractions; of which, some already did, others shortly would macerate these
Disciples hearts: If I can guide you through them in mine Application, well;
loath I am to draw so many troubles upon you at this present. I proceed
therefore to the next.

The next Consolation is, The remedy proposed.
Ye believe in God, believe also in me, (...).

Some read the former (...) not indicatively, Ye do believe; but imperatively,
Believe ye; thus the M. Trostii praefat. ad N. T. Ny^ac.

by the Syriack) the Talton Biblia Polyglotta.

Cyril, and others; but, in thus reading, they seem never the more happy
Expositers: Such as read two Imperatives, double the command, but weaken the
persuasion: Wherefore, with a very filial delight, I adhere to the same
Translation which our judicious mother, the Church of England, here
recommendeth unto us; She reads this first (...), Ye believe; so does the
vulgar Latin; the like do the most, and the best of those Rupertus, Beda, etc.
in locum. Vig lius adversus Eutychem, lib. 4. Augustinus Tract. 67. in Joan.
few Interpreters which I have hitherto met with.

Now read it, Ye believe, and it brings with it, as well a Counsel, as a
Command; as well an Instruction, as an Exhortation: quasi,

Ye cannot believe in God, except ye believe in me, for August n. ubi supra.
I am God; Ye believe in God, believe also in me.

Ye believe in God, That he Zech. 13.7.
will smite the Shepherd; Believe also in me, that I Isa. 53.4, Mat. 26.31.
am smitten for your Transgressions.

Ye believe in God, that he Exodus 14.
requires a Paschal Lamb, believe also in me, that I am 1 Cor. 5.7.
the Passover sacrificed for you.

Ye believe in God, that he Luke 19.10.
sent me to save; believe also in me, that I am Heb. 7.25.
able to save to the uttermost.

These Glosses are wholesome Truths, but wide of our Saviors Scope; they seem
somewhat forced; natural they are not: Wheither ye abide v. 1. by the troubles;
or whether ye step forward v. 2. to the Mansions; obvious it is, That, what
Instruction is here given, is given Gorran. Beza, Jansen. etc. in locum.
by way of consolation and supporrt, both from the nature of Faith, v. 1. and
from the certainty of the reward, v. 2. quasi,

Ye believe in God that he Isa 55.7.
can abundantly pardon; believe also in me, that I 1 John 1.9.
am faithful and just to forgive you your sins.

That I am God, ye Mat. 16.16.
rest satisfied; Ye believe in God, although Goran. in locum.
invisible; believe also in me, though absent.

Ye already Erasm. in locum.
believe in God; Moses he taught you that lesson, he required you to believe in
God; let me instruct you to believe also in me.

Faith Hammond, Beza, Jansen. in locum.
prepares Antidotes against 1 John 5.4.
every trouble; Ye believe in God, a Psalm. 46.1.
ready help; believe also in Luke 8.24, 25.
me; in me ye John 14.27.16.23.
shall find peace.

Many are your vexations, but, Let not your heart be troubled: As ye believe in
God, who Psalm. 9.9.
is a sure Refuge, see that ye believe also in me, who Joh. 14.18.
will not leave you comfortless: And take this for your encouragement, Your
sufferings shall not be in vain: as is the victory of your Faith, such shall
August. uli supra. Aquin. 1 a. 2 e. q. 5. A. 2. Tirin. Erasm. etc. in locum.
your recompense in heaven be; for In my Fathers house are many Mansions.
Rather,

Ye believe in God that he will never leave you; believe also in me, that I do
not forsake you; though whither I go, ye cannot now come, I Maldonat and
Marlorat in locum.
go to prepare a place for you, In my Fathers house are many Mansions.

But here fall in diverse Questions, several little Stumbling-stones, which I
would willingly roll away.

Quest. If Mansions were now to be prepared, Dub.
how sped the spirits of just men departed before this time?

Answ. Solut.
August. ibid. Heinsius in loc.
The spirits of just men departed before Christ's time, had their places
preparted for them by virtue of Christ's future preparation. Christ thereunto
predestined undertook for the security of Gods Elect Mat. 25.34.
before all worlds: And, what he undertook, that his Father Isa. 49.8.
reputed as good as done; say Maldonat what he please on Mat. 3.2.

Quest. Dub.
Why (of all times) must Christ go to prepare a place, now?

Answ. Ever, Gods time is, of all times, Solut.
the best: As there was a Fullness of time, wherein the Gal. 4.4.
Son of man should be made of a woman: so there was a Fullness of time, wherein
He, being made of a woman, should prepare a place for us; the fullness of which
time now was; now was the appointed season.

Quest. What needed any such preparation at all? Dub. Solut.


Answ. Adam, by his sin, had Perkins on the Creed.
shut himself, and in himself us, much more out of the Paradise of Heaven, then
out of the Paradise of Eden.

Quest. Dub.
By what course did Christ prepare for us these Mansions?

Answ. Solut.
First, By way of purchase; next, by way of possession.

First, By way of purchase: For his own part, The Son of God, being the Father
of Heavens John 1 14.
only begotten, has Gal. 4.7.
a right unto these Mansions, as he is Heb. 1.2.
Heir of all things: But, as for us, our sins are a Isa. 59.2.
wall of separation between us and our God: Wherefore, the Son of man dying,
places himself as a door of hope within that wall. There were indeed Cherubims
(terrible with Junius in Genesis 3.24.
fire and sword) placed against us before Paradise; but, God has by Christ,
called back those Cherubims, and has, in their stead, placed not Joh. 20.12.
armed, but gowned Angels, having not swords glittering like fire, but the
white colors of peace, and of free admission. Thus Christ, by his wounds,
sets wide open the Heb. 10.19.
great gates of his Fathers house: When he overcame the sharpness of death, he
opened the kingdom of Heaven to all Believers.

Secondly, By way of Possession: even in this sense, by Christ's flesh Heb.
10.20.
is consecrated a way for us: His body, which the Act. 3.21.
heavens receive, takes Livery and Seizin Heb. 9.24.
for us. Christ ascending, ascends, as Phil. 2 9.
for himself, so Heb. 6.20.
for us: In conceit, we Ephesians. 2.6.
already sit together with him in heavenly places: Had these Disciples, with
that Luke 23.42.
Saint-Thief, petioned Christ, Lord remember us when thou come into thy
kingdom; Christ might then have replied; Let not your heart be troubled; ye
believe in God, believe also in me; In my Fathers house are many Mansions.

(...). Quest. House? Mansions? many Mansions? Dub.
Hitherto our Savior spoke plainly, Tota haec Oration est parabolica. Beza.
Solut.
why speaks he now in Parables?

Answ. This wise Master Builder will leave no stone unmoved: Where Elegancies
may prevail, he Hos. 12.10.
spares no Rhetorique. Of the Disciples here spoken to, the three chief,
Peter, James and John found it good, being there where Christ was transfigured:
so were they transported, that Peter would fain have built there three
Tabernacles: Possibly, Christ here intimates, that he would now prepare for
them, not Tabernacles, but Mansions; not on mount Mat. 17.1. in quem locum
vide, sis, S. Hieron. and Bedam.
Tabor, but in his Fathers house. The Application of the Text.


WHether that Mount were Videas Tirinum in Mat. 17.1.
Mount Tabor, Peculiar unto the Ministers of the Gospel.
or whether the Lord Jesus does here allude unto his Transfiguration upon that
Mount, I need not to dispute, now: neither need I to open unto you more of
these Mansions, until I have first led you unto my Fathers house. It suffices,
for the present, that placed with Moses upon Mount Nebo, we have gained a sight
of the promised Rest; especially, seeing these few words do already multiply
upon our attention; and [seeing they do already] grow upon us as exceeding
Psalm. 119.96.
broad. Every sentence (here) is a Tree of life; every Tree of life (here,)
has several branches; every branch (here,) bears much fruit, fruit which may
abound unto your account. He is no good Orator, who overmuch raises
expectation; but I (who am no Orator) cannot raise your expectation enough.
Chapter 10. Verse 10. Christ came that we might Have Life, and that we might
have it more abundantly; just so he comes in this beginning of this 14th.
Chapter. Luke 24.2. They found the stone rolled away from the Sepulcher;
Christ, here rolleth away every stone. Whether Clergy, or Laity, we do every of
us, (here) receive a Benjamins portion. Wherefore, that both Priest and People
may, as Sr. Edward Turner in his May 19. 1662. speech, p. 6.
one advises, like well squared stones in a well built Arch, each support the
other, and grow closer and stronger thorough the weighty duties which God
lays upon us; I shall begin with our selves, the Ministers of Christ, that we
may from Christ Jesus, the more effectually speak unto you the people of God.

First, Observe. from the circumstance of the time.
then, If there be in these our Duties, amidst our holy Function, any profane
Hophni, any that lightly esteem God, any that feed themselves, and not their
Flock; any too fat to be laborious; any studious more to gain Revenues and
Dignities, then the souls committed unto their charge: As this Text sows no
Pillow under such Elbows, so it wholly removes their scandal from our present
age and Church: For, even those very persons which are upon all occasions so
forward to catch up every stone of offense against us, even they themselves
cannot say, as St. Paul See Dr. Airay upon Phil. 2.21.
did, All seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ's: If some do, a
sore evil it is, but no new evil under the Sun: as in bodies Politic, so in
Churches Militant; Perfection cannot reasonably be expected; Where much Wheat
is, Tares there will be: Among many Laborers, some will wax idle: The Temple
at Jerusalem could never be so exactly repaired, but that some part of it or
other would ever be amiss; Nor is Holiness inherent to the Levite: One Number.

2. manner whereafter, the order wherein, Obser from the the manner, order and
matter of the words.
the matter whereof, the Wisdom of the Father does here speak.

1. As I told you, what is here uttered, is delivered feelingly and
pathetically: What proceeds from Him, proceeds as well from the flowings of
his love, as from the openings of his lips.

2. The Order of the words, makes things temporal, an occasion unto things
spiritual; leads from Nature to Grace; from reason in the heart, to Faith in
Christ; from troubles in the world, to Mansions in Heaven; brings us from
outward troubles, to inward duties; from inward duties, to the recompense of
the reward; guides us, through a world of troubles, into a kingdom of Grace;
from a kingdom of Grace, unto a Crown of Glory.

3. The Matter here spoken of, is not some barren needless Punctilium, but
matter worthy him that preaches, viz. the great concernments of the soul; the
property, and efficacy of faith; the means and certainty of Salvation.

Which three circumstances twisted into one example, fully separate between the
profitable, and unprofitable Teacher: For, while on the left hand, they explode
that sleight of Oratory, which rejects Christ's, but admireth Stultissimum
credo ad imitandum non optima quae que proponere. Piin. lib. 1. Epist. 5.
man's wisdom; on the right, they approve that wholesome method which imitateth
not man Invention, but Christ's pattern, viz.

On the right hand, this commends that great part of our English Clergy,
which are indeed Stewards of the Mysteries of God; Stewards, as faithful, as
able; Lights, as well burning, as shining; meek, lowly, gentle, patient, of a
dove-like innocence, and of a willing compliance; yet valiant for the Truth,
zealous of good works, bold to preach the Gospel 1 These. 2.2.
(...), and very zealous for their Lord of Hosts. In these, the Word dwells
richly, and in all wisdom too; especially in that Prove. 11.30.
choice Wisdom which wins souls; These Prove. 15.2.
use their knowledge aright: exceeding learned they are, and are (because they
are exceeding learned) mighty in the Scriptures. When these speak, they so
speak as the Oracles of their God; when these minister, they so minister as of
the ability which God gives. Beloved, by the Word thus preached, what people
upon earth is exalted so near heaven, as our Island is? What Nation under
heaven can muster up so many Watchmen, which cry aloud, and spare not; so many
Chariots and Horsemen of Israel which fight the Lords battles, as England can?
Blessed, yea blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ for O si

witness unto us, lest we deny the Lord.

On the other hand, For Zions sake, I will not hold my peace: Alas, I cannot
choose but stumble at too many, even of our English Divines, who make it their
utmost endeavor, to preach, learnedly indeed, but, not unto Edification:
Should Job 15 2, 3.
a wise man utter vain knowledge? Should he reason with unprofitable Talk? or
with speech that can do no good? Away then, with that manner of preaching,
which contriveth more to repeat Authors, or to boast languages, then to edify
souls. The Son of God abhorred Affectation of Literature, yet spoke Mat. 7.29.

our Head Christ Jesus, who (so often as he pleased) did (in the days of his
flesh) in all holiness and wisdom exercise the power to him committed, may seem
(unto me at least) to justify unto the Ministers of his Gospel both Dignities
and Revenues.

that, let a Preacher of Righteousness keep close unto the In ea regula

2. Null all these Topics; Descend a while, from Gods wisdom, to man's: What
ye, under the Gospel, sacrifice unto your God, is not consumed with fire, as
under the law it was: No bird, no beast is prohibited as common, or Act. 10.15,
16. Nehem. 10.34.
unclean; the fat of your lambs, of your bullocks, of your hee-goats are no
whit lessened by your devotions: your Groves are not daily cut down, to
continue a perpetual fire in the Sanctuary; Neither does the perfume of your
prayers diminish the quantity of your sweet spices. Again, be our portion
never so large, the National stock is equally the same: Rome sucketh no
Peter Pence from the Protestant; no Cell, no Cloister burieth the treasures of
English Monasteries: On the other side, what from us supplieth his sacred
Majesty's royal Exchequer, eases you of some of your Subsidies, and payments.
Once more, there is the same Charter for our Romans 2.22. Concessimus quod
Ecclesia Anglicana libera sit in perpetuum, and habeat jura sua integra, and

commerce too: as we share with you in the same plenty, so we are a part of the
same Commune socictatis vincislum, mutua indigentia.
Villages, of the same cities, and of the same Kingdom with your selves: The
tribe of Levi is one, although but one, of the twelve tribes; of all which
twelve tribes, I know never a one that does, of her lawful profits, either
impropriate less unto the owners self interest, or refund more unto a common
benefit, then ours does. Cast up our accounts, ye will find whatsoever falls

private Personage wants wherewith to procure, and much more wherewith to
publish considerable Volumns. It is, for the wealthy Prelates, to enjoy spare
hours, to accumulate Books, to converse with the most, and most eminent in
every Science and Language; to maintain Chaplains, Amanuenses, Printers, etc.
whereby they are enabled to countermine the united industry of foreign
Colleges. We owe unto the Revenue, as well as unto the studiousness, of our
most Reverend, and right Reverend, and Reverend Prelates Books, as seasonable,
as religious; as religious, as learned; as learned, as exhausting, and
expensive. The Lord make us truly thankful unto his goodness, for those many
and excellent Treatises, which do every where abound amongst us; mean while,
next unto God, the Author of Holy Writ, and unto his Vicegerent, Defender of
the Faith, we owe unto the Abbot, Aadrews, etc. Bilson, Brumrick, Bradford,

Divinity, whether Polemical or Practical; yea, and our best Translations,
Commentaries and Copies too of the Holy Scriptures themselves. Give God the
glory; had the Reverend Hierarchy of our Church been sacrilegiously deprived of
their Revenues, most of us (for ought that I know) had been unestablished (even
unto this very day) in the Fundamentals of Religion and Truth.

Beside what others have Hooker Eccles. Polit. l. 5. Sect. 15.71.76. B. Gauden
in his Hierasplstes: Answ. to the sixth Cavil. per totum. B. Nicholsons Apology.
learnedly and effectually argued and proved: Church-Revenues (seem to me to)
entitle themselves unto the persons in my Text; whether the persons in my Text
be considered as Sufferers for the Gospel of Truth; or as Messengers of the
Gospel of Peace.

1. As sufferers: We, while we preach, the truth of the Gospel, are, many ways,
sufferers: our names suffer, our quiet suffers, our estate suffers, our
health suffers, etc. first, the haters of God speak evil of us, because we,
as in duty bound, convince them of evil; we gall their consciences, and they
Praedicare nihil aliud est quam derivare in se furorem mundi. Luther. Rom 15.3.
2 Cor. 12.15.
smite us with the tongue: secondly, since we cannot speak peace to their sins,
they 2 Chronicles. 36.16.
endeavor our trouble: thirdly, while ye honestly set out our maintenance,
sons of Belial will rather rob God, then spare us Chi. po^ta il tor cio,

our own; and of what they steal not from us, little improvement can we make;
yea, well is it, if, while we are wasting our selves in our duties, none of our
servants waste our childrens bread: fourthly, where diseases are contagious,
and that contagion is not yet discovered, who visits the sick, and burieth
the dead, seldom escapes infection: however Study is a staff of cotton. ibid.

much studiousnesse, and much health be hardly found in one person. Beloved, I
urge not these as complaints, but as vindications: the sincere Minister has

live as becomes his vocation; they are that oil of the sanctuary, which the
wisdom of the all-sufficient God has made necessary to preserve our light of
life, and consequently, the light of the Gospel from extinguishing: wherefore,
since a Minister can no more subsist without these, then without the air which
he breathes in, stoop he must to take them up for his livelihood, and, seeing
he must of necessity encumber himself with these requisite supplies, very equal
it is, that, what is his right be tendered unto him, not only as his due, but,
as his encouragement, and Philem. 14. Phil. 4.14, 17

If the over-watched Midwife be wearied, and humbled with the loud cries,
doleful complaints and fearful pangs of a woman laboring, and travailing, as
well for her own life, as her infants; your courtesy considers not only this
midwifes handinesse, but, her discomforts; not only her dexterous skill, but,
her irksome watchings. In stead of enjoying the sweets of some pleasant garden,
the Surgeon tieth himself up unto his patients wound; dresseth bruises deep
and putrified; sores, enough (one would think) at once, to affright, and poison
him; in this Surgeon ye regard, not only his art, but, his patience. The
Physician neglects his estate, his home, his ease, his sleep, his health to
attend the groans of a dying man; for these his self-denials, the merciless
soldier would not Dr. Gauden. Hieraspistes. p. 490.

Omitting, then, what we suffer in our name, peace, wealth, and health, is any
revenue or honor a suitable requital for these our frequent, alas, our
constant discomforts? If ye (Parents) have in your hearts any bowels of pity,
over one childs ricated consumption, another angry blaines, a thirds bruised
limbs, a fourth burnt in your fire, or other like calamities (from which God
forefend); ye have (then) a little turning, a little of the melting of our
bowels; a little taste of our inward bleedings; ye will (then) see us in the
same Positure, as was the sister of that forlorn Moses, Exodus 2, 4 or, as was
Hagar when she had eyes, able to weep, but, not able to Genesis 21.16.

wine from either Hagar or Rachel, deserved little himself: either take from us
these waters of affliction, else, mix with these waters some wine of gladness.
Lay ye aside the hardness of your hearts, we will then be content to make Brick
without Straw. Affright us no more with frequent Symptoms of your everlasting
death, and then debar us of what worldly shelters our earthly Tabernacles may
justly demand; either preserve your precious souls from being lost, or grudge
not our bodies the melancholic comfort of a mourning weed: But if our
trembling hearts, therefore, die daily, because ye daily neglect to escape
death, afford us (we beseech you) some of your weak Julips, for Cordials ye can
give us none. Since we must suffer heaviness, because some of you repent not of
your unbelief, allow us that liberty, which was not denied unto the persons in
my Text; The person here speaking was a man Compare Mat. 26.36. and Joh. 18.1.
with Luke 22.39.
of sorrows, ye, therefore, sometimes find him in Ibid.

Manger, spare him your presents. As for the Persons here spoken to, they are
likewise spoken to in the tenth Chapter of St. Mark; where for what they suffer
in verse 29, they receive a hundred fold in verse 30. (21) Mat. 2.11.
I conclude then, so long as the yerning of our bowels beggeth of you, Believe
in God, believe in Christ; In your Fathers house are many Mansions: So long
your Equity, if not your Bounty, will treat us, Let not your heart be troubled.

2. If our necessary Supplies part from you with an Evil Will, we then address
our selves unto you all, not only as Sufferers through your default, but, as
Messengers of your peace, viz. For so much as the Tidings which we bring are
glad. Tidings, the just Lord has Luke 10.7. Gal. 6 6.
ordained, that we should live not upon the Courtesy, but upon the Duty of
Christians; not upon their arbitrary Collation, but upon a Reward unto our
Heavenly Message. The Lord of Hosts, that is, the Psalm 84.1.68.24.134.1.

Noble Rewards: The more considerable the News, the more signal the Recompense
unto him who brings it: When the Person here speaking came as our Isa. 62.11.
Salvation, his Reward was with him, as for us, so for Himself; and that not
only when he ascended up on high, but likewise, when he rode into the holy City
with Mat. 21.7.
Triumph. As for the Persons here spoken to, since they also published the
Gospel, let St. Paul alone to 1 Cor. 9.4, 5.
plead their right. It is folly to expect Esteem from them who understand not
Virtue; therefore unto the righteous man is Praise Psalm. 111.10. 1 Pet. 2.14.
assigned by his God; It is in vain for Evangelists to expect large gratuities
from them who cherish a heart of unbelief; therefore, God himself Gal 6.6.
steppeth in, and allotteth unto these Messengers of his, ((...)) A 1 Cor. 9.14.
suitable Recompense, even, a 1 Timothy 5.17.
Double maintenance or Honor. If then the Revenues of our Church have been,
either for. merly, or, of later days, an eyesore unto any of you; if your Eye
has been evil, because your Lord and Masters eye is good; If any of you
expostulate, what need of all this cost? ye will no more be so heedless as to
stumble at this stone; rather, having Genesis 28.11.
slept upon it, ye will, Genesis v. 18.
upon it, pour more and more oil, until ye have made it a Genesis v. 19, 20.

Be it that they grudge not at your Revenues, yet well may we stumble at your

Answ. As for the Prince in whose favor the Hierarchy of England Prove. 19.12.
finds life, seeing he is The Vicegerent of the person speaking in my Text;
He is (ye know) a Supreme Governor over all persons among us; as well over
persons Ecclesiastical, as over persons Civil: If then, His sacred Majesty's

your eyes be evil, because his gracious Majesty's are good. 3. 3. Answer.
Answ. As for the Names or Titles wherewith our most Reverend Archbishops, our
Reverend Deans, Prebendaries, Archdeacons and Sim. are dignified, I suppose
thou will not stumble at them, until thou can first produce out of Scripture,
the honorable Titles of Lord chief Justice, Sergeant at Law, Bencher,
Barrister, Attornie, Solicitour, etc. 4. Answ. (1) Answer.
As for the Legality of their Constitution, there is the same Law of the Land
for their Authority, as there is for the excellent Magistracy of this Realm:
Now, If thou 1 James 4 11.
judge the Law, thou art not a doer of the Law, but a Judge.
Object. No part of the Laws of our Land, Object.
ought to be contrary unto the Laws of our God.

Answ. Answer.
If any part of the Laws of our Land opposes the Word of God, I humbly, I
earnesty wish it were repealed; for, of right, our Lawgivers can 2 Cor. 13.8.
do nothing against the truth, but for the Truth: But, as for that part of our
English Laws which establishes Hierarchy, it in no wise opposes the Holy
Scriptures.

Object. Object.
It opposes the Holy Scriptures in constituting an Hierarchy not enjoined by
Gods Words.

Answ. Hierarchy is enjoined by Gods Word, Answer.
as it is an 1 Pet. 2.13.
Ordinance of man; viz. Our Lawgivers are themselves immediately Prove. 8.15.
Romans 13.1, 2. Revel. 1.5.
ordained of God; and, being ordained of God, they have an 1 Pet. 2.14. Exodus
18. v. 23. compated with v. 24.
Authority and Warrant, from Scripture, to ordain subordinate Powers.

Object. Object.
Holy Scriptures give us examples of subordinate powers among Magistrates as
Exodus 18.25. and Sim.
Magistrates; but they give unto us no such Examples of subordinate powers
among Ministers, as Ministers.

Answ. Answer.
As holy Scriptures mention subordinate powers among the Magistrates under
Moses and his Successors; so they do also Exodus 28.1. Numb 18.2.3.6, 33.
mention subordinate powers among the Levites under Aaron and his Successors.

Object. Object.
The subordinate power among those Levites was by virtue of Gods Ibid.
express Command.

Answ. Answer.
So were Exodus 18.23.
the subordinate powers among those Magistrates.

Object. Object.
Although in the old Testament, God appointed a Hierarchy among the Levites; In
the new Testament, Christ appointed no such Hierarchy among his Ministers.

1. 1. Answer.
Answ. Although in the Old Testament God appointed a Deuteronomy. 17.15. Exodus 18.25.
Josh. 1.2. 1 Samuel 10.15. 2 Samuel 7.13.
Model of Magistracy for his people; yet in the new Testament Christ appoints
no such Model of Magistracy for them that shall believe his Gospel. 2. Answ. As
the Model of our English Magistracy is acknowledged and proved Prove. 8.15. Romans
13.1, 2. 1 Pet. 2.13, 14. Rev. 1.5.
lawful, though there be no Model of any Magistracy at all in the New
Testament, nor the same Model in the old Testament, as is in this, or in any
other Kingdom under Heaven: So, the Model of our English Hierarchy may be
proved lawful, though there be no such Model of Hierarchy in the New
Testament, etc.

While I commend unto thee these or other Books, better then these, will thou
reply, Such Authors are therefore useless, because the holy Scriptures are able
to make thee 2 Timothy 3.15.
wise unto Salvation? I trow not: Thou will rather say, These (or the like
works) are therefore beneficial, because they Eccles. 12.11.
consent unto the Truth of the holy Scriptures: Just so, must I answer thee.
The Word of God gives general Rules Romans 13.1, 2. As at first God himself im
nediately, Exodus 33.14, 15, 16. 1 Sim. c. 8.7.12.12. ruled his people, so at
first Christ also himself immediately ruled his people, but afterward entrusted
their Government with Kings, and Rulers successively, as God, had formerly done.
for the well ordering of Gods chosen people; Now, while our Parliamentary
Statutes do, in our State Affairs, establish among us at King as Supreme Head
in all Causes temporal, and a Magistracy under that King; A King, as Supreme in
all Causes spiritual, and a Hierarchy under that King; These our Paliamentary
Statutes do manifestly prove beneficial unto the Churches of God, while they
make particular Applications of Gods general Rules.

2. 2. Answer.
Answ. Suppose before John 13.13. Mat. 10.1. Luke 10.1.
Christ ascended from earth to Heaven, He, his Twelve Apostles, and his Seventy
Disciples were, in that Infancy (that new birth) of the Church, a sufficient
number of Church Governors: yet, as the Church increased in the number of
Believers after Christ's Ascension; might not, after Christ ascended, other
Church Governors be introduced consonant and subservient to these?

3. 3. Answer.
Answ. Certainly, as in Deu. 17.15 Ruth. 1.1. 1 Samuel 12.13.
Kingdoms and in Commonwealths, so Isa. 49.23. Romans 13.6. compared with Mat.
28.20.
in Churches, such may be the form of Government; as the Lawgiver, for the time
being, shall see most expedient for the propagation of the Gospel. Christ has
1 Samuel 2.28 2 Cor. 3.61.6.4
his Ministry, and his Ministry has Mat. 16.19 18.18.
The power of the keys, just as his Magistracy has the Romans 13.4.
power of the sword; but ever, the modelling of this Magistracy, and of this
Ministry, belongs unto the Exo. 18.19.
Lawgiver. Moses, that is, God by Moses, may single out Exo. 28.1.
Aaron and his Successors to be Highpriests; the Levites to Number. 18.5
serve at the Altar, to Number. 1.50.3 31.
bear the Ark, etc. David may 1 Chr. 15.11. -17.
appoint Singers, etc. and Solomon 2 Chr. 5.12.
may require them to take their Courses in the Temple orderly like an Host. In
his time, in answer to the heads of the twelve Tribes, Christ had Mat. 10.1
his twelve Apostles. In answer to the seventy Elders, he had Luke 10 1
his seventy Disciples: So after his Ascension, for the benefit of the Church,
were added Act. 6.5. Ephesians. 4.11. Rom 12.6. 1 Cor. 12.28.
Deacons, Evangelists, Pastors, Teachers and Bishops, and why not other such
like, as the benefit of 1 Timothy 5.9. Tit. 1.5. John 3.8. 2 Samuel 6.5. 1 Kings
8.64. 1 Chr. 15.12.16.4. 2 Chr. 29.30, 34. Ezra 6.16, 18. Nehem. 8.9.9.4.
Christian Kingdoms, and Chuches shall require? I conclude then, so far is our
Hierarchy from being a rock of offense unto such as receive a love of the
truth, that they are undeniably a Ephesians. 4.7, 11.

unto the flourishing Nobility and Gentry of this Kingdom: If these rule well,
may God have the Glory, and themselves the praises due; Nevertheless, since
they have been, more for ruling like 1 Samuel 7.15.12.4.
Samuel, then for 1 Samuel 2.18.3.20.
ministering before the Lord like Samuel; since they have stumbled at holy
Orders as somewhat below their quality and birth; with all humbleness and
earnestness I beseech them (and others for them) to recollect how little weight
there is in the Stone of Offense: For, 1. 1. Not unworthy the highest.
Suppose not many mighty, not many noble receive the Saving Faith; Saving Faith
is no whit the less precious: just so, be it that not many mighty, not many
noble minister before the Lord, the Ministry of Reconciliation is no more whit

renowned Princes! May they consider, that Esaias was therefore the more
honorable, because a Prophet. Jehoiada was more famous in being High Priest,
then in his affinity to the Diadem of Judah; nor was Joseph ever greater then

both lived and died. Of the Persons here spoken to, James and Jude his brother,

Joseph, the Virgin Mary's husband; James and Tude were sons of that Cleophas;
and James and John were sons of Salome, the daughter of that Cleophas.
high born, yet gloryed more in being the Apostles of Jesus, then in being (as
indeed they were) of the blood Royal. I have therefore no small hopes, that the
Nobles of England who find it their Esteem to be Ministers of State, will so
train up their excellent Children, that they may within few years, be partakers
in that Isa. 61.6.
promise, and be deservedly called, The Ministers of our God.


We have looked upon the Persons spoken to in my Text, 2. Not injurious unto

with both our eyes. We have noted in them, first, (that which we naturally
epsy in others, and over-see in our selves, viz.) great Failings: next, (that
which we as naturally covet for our selves, but envy in others, viz.) great
Dignities.

And [verily] God himself magnifieth their Office: their Letters credential are
endited by the blessed spirit, and sealed, not with wax, but with blood; with
blood, not of goats or lambs, but of a man; not of a man only, but of Act.

a God. Their Embassy treats concerning, not War, but Peace; not among petty
Provinces, but large Kingdoms; on terms, not dishonorable, but (of all sorts)
the most honorable, namely, that of a successful marriage. Authority they have
to proclaim a 1 Cor. 5.8. Isa. 25 6.
Solemn Festival, and to espouse believers unto the Lord of Lords, and King of
Kings. Yea, lest the sons of men should not duly esteem the servants of the
living God, lest the persons spoken unto in my Text, should otherwise want of a
Reception answerable unto the Majesty of him whom they represent, the Lord of
Glory vouchsafes to entitle them, not only his Ministers, but his
Ambassadors; not only his Ambassadors, but his Angels.

Mean while (such is, if not our Inheritance, our lot) from this accreaseth one
more stumbling stone, a stone cast between Christians, as Clergy and Laity: The
Laity so called for discrimination sake, the Clergy so called for diverse
reasons. One, the Priesthood, once a part of Genesis 25.31.
the birthright of the first born, was Deuteronomy. 10.8, 9. 1 Samuel 2.28, 29.
afterward allotted unto a peculiar Tribe. Another, whereas Moses and Joshua
divided the promised land among the other Tribes; God himself Number. 18.20, 21.
Josh. 13.33. Ezekiel. 44.48.
allotted unto the Levites their Inheritance: A third, the first Act. 1.26.

gives it as a Help and Benefit to his Church. 3. The Holiness of our
Profession we deny not, but we claim unto our persons no other holiness or
heaven, then what the God of Grace indifferently vouchsafes as well unto you
as unto us; in the same sense, that there is neither bond nor free, neither
Male nor Female; there is neither Clergy nor Laity; for we are all one in
Christ Jesus: If while ye give diligence to walk worthy the Lord in your
Callings, we in our Callings neglect so to do; as St. Augustine (admiring
Antonius) told Surgunt indocti, and coelum rapiunt, and nos cum doctrinis
nostris sine cord, ecce ubi volutamur in carne and sanguine.
Alipius, We Clergymen may perish in Hell, while ye no Clergymen become Kings

spirit: We have a spiritual Communion, Clergy with Laity, Laity with Clergy,
both together making up that one Mystical body, whereof Christ is the head: so
are we members one of another, that this discrimination of Clergy and Laity,
like that (in our English Diadem) of the white and red Rose, causes not
difference but Union: I say, it does but mind us of the Unity of the Spirit,
speaking not only our Peace, but our Happiness; While, what diversity, we have,
like that of the corner stones in the Temple, is therefore such, that it may
the more strengthen the spiritual Building of God.


Wherefore we (of the Clergy) beseech you (of the Laity) that there be no
strife between you and us, for we are brethren. Our Lord and Master is not
ashamed to call you brethren, much less we his servants; yea, we your servants
for his sake. We repute you not Ethnic or Heathen, but The Laity, the people
of God; Examples we would be, Strangers we would not be unto Believers. And ye,
brethren, as without holiness, ye cannot see God; so without Peace, ye cannot
cherish Holiness: a body so fitly joined together as this Ephesians. 4.16. Col. 2.19.
body of Christ is, then best edifieth it self, when it most increases in
love. When in sincerity we pray, that God would save you his people; and ye
petition, That God would bless us (...).
His inheritance. When ye pray for us, That we may be endued with
Righteousness; and we for you, That ye may be spiritually joyful; this is
mutually a pledge to us all, that God would give unto us clean hearts, and will
not withold his spirit from us.

Beloved, It is our joy, that while we are a chosen Ministry, ye are a chosen
Generation; Our joy, that while we are a royal Priesthood, ye are a peculiar
people. On the other side, unto so many of you as acknowledge a God of 1 Cor.
14.33.
Order, unto so many of you as seek 1 Cor. 40.
Decency, and Col. 2.5.
Stedfastness, the received distinction of Clergy and Laymen will become not a

9.62. 1 Cor. 9.16, 17.
humiliation, that we are the Clergy. Our true, our spiritual happiness
consists in being such as every one of you ought to be, viz. sound believers,
and zealous Followers of Christ Jesus our Lord. Consider the persons spoken
unto in my Text, that they were chosen Disciples, called to be Apostles and
Ministers, we have already understood; but withal, we may observe, that they
had more troubles then the other Disciples had. We may further note, that
although a chief part of their troubles arose from their office and Ministry,
yet a chief part of their Relief and Comfort arose unto them, not from their
being peculiar Apostles, Disciples and Ministers of Christ, but from their
being such as you (we trust) are, viz. followers of God in Christ Jesus our
Lord. When our blessed Savior comfort them, Let not your heart be troubled,
he does not add, Ye have the credit of being chosen Ministers, ye have the
honor of being great Apostles, but ye believe in God; He does not bid them,
remember their preheminencies, but, believe in me; neither does he tell them,
In the Ministry of the Gospel is no small honor, but, In my Fathers house are
many Mansions. Now, Faith in God, Faith in Christ, the Mansions in heaven, are
not peculiar unto Gospel Ministers, as Ministers, This one name Christian
binds us a together, leads us all hand in hand toward Heaven. G. H. Serin.
on Numb. 17.18.
but common to Gospel-Profsessors, as Believers.

Having therefore so fully considered the persons here spoken unto, as they
were called unto the Ministry of the Gospel; I shall, in the next place,
review them under that Notion which much more concerns their Everlasting
peace. I shall consider them as called unto the Faith of the Gospel. And this
ye may justy expect from my hands: For, we were only in the Context when we
found the persons here spoken unto chosen Ministers; we find them professed
Believers in the Text it self. So many of you as believe in God, so many of you
as believe in Christ, let not your heart be troubled; In my Fathers house are
many Mansions, as well for you his Elect, as for his Apostles themselves.

PArtly because our Savior had with so much ease conveyed himself from the
Jews, Universal, unto the Professors of the Gospel.
Joh. 5.16.7.30.8.20.11.8.10.31, 39.19.11.
whenever the Jews most maliciously attempted to kill him: and partly
because, when at last our Savior did (not Mat. 26.53, 54.
escape, but) suffer death, the Traitors heart was so manifestly Mat. 27.3.5.
overcome with sorrow, some Jansea. Concord. Evan. cap. 140.
[pitifully] conjecture, that had it once entered into his thoughts, that Jesus
might not have delivered himself as well Joh. 18.6, 12.
at this, as at former Joh. 10.31, 39.
times, Judas would not for any Mat. 26.15
moneys have betrayed his Master: Thus some fancy; But,

First, (since Iscariots hand was in) John 12.6.
what moneys he lost in the Spiknard, he was Mat. 26. V. 8. compared with v. 14.
resolved he would gain by his Treason. Secondly, What good affection a John
12.6.
Thief had for an honest Master, I know not. Thirdly, The Traitor could not
Mat. 16.21.
be ignorant, that the same Jews which bought his Master, would with wicked
hands crucify him. Fourthly, as his covetous heart could not brook to see any
cost go beside his bag; so neither could his Hypocritical heart brook it, that
he was John 6.70.13.26. Mat. 26.23, 24, 25.
laid so open before his Fellow-Disciples. Fifthly, Of this I am sure, the
Psalm. 41.5, - 9.109.4, 5, 16.
Scriptures concerning him, could not but be fulfilled. Sixthly, This ye will
all say, 1 Cor. 16.22.
If any man love not the Lord Jesus, let him be accursed. Judas he loved not
the Lord Jesus, he was Joh. 15.25
his adversary without a cause; He Psalm. 41.9.109.5.
rewarded him. evil for good; he lifted up his heels against his Joh. 13.18.
Head, he was a very Joh. 6.70.
Devil unto him: Therefore Judas was not ignorant, but malicious; not upright,
but a Thief; not sincere, but a Hypocrite; not a Convert, but a Caitiffe; he
loved not the Lord Jesus, and was therefore a Joh. 17.12.
son of Perdition.

Now, in as much as Judas is found to be a son of perdition, he is utterly
excluded from the comforts of this Text: When Christ says, Let not your heart
be troubled, he speaks not to Judas who Joh. 13.30.
left him, but unto the Disciples who abode with him: Here is therefore matter
to be applied unto all of you, and unto none of you. First, Unto none of you,
viz. Unto none of you in my Text; unto you that are none of Christ's. Next, Unto
all of you, viz. Unto all of you in my Text; unto all of you who are true
Disciples of Christ, unto all of you Disciples who faithfully continue sincere
Followers of Christ.

To proceed, then: The person here speaking in my Text, is one who is a
Teacher sent from God; To Unbelievers: whom it
one who rightly divides the Word of Truth; one who distributeth unto each his
due portion; one who separateth between the goats and the sheep; between the
chaff and the wheat; between the vile and the precious; as he will not break
the bruised Reed, will not quench the smoking flax, so neither will he speak
peace unto the wicked. Mention a Hypocrite, and he shall have Mat. 24.51
weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth. Find out a Generation of Vipers,
and they shall Mat. 23.32.
fill up the measure of their Fathers guilt. In my Text here Your is exclusive;
ye who abide constant Followers, let not your heart be troubled: But as for
Judas who Joh, 13.30.
is departed from me, well were it Mat. 26.24.
for him, had he never been born; let him do Joh. 13.37.30.
what he lists, let him go Joh. 13.30.
where he will, let his heart be Mat. 27 3.
troubled; let his heart be troubled, till he Mat. 27 5. On which see Hammond,
and on Act. 1.18.
burst again.

Thus the same Gospel which publishes glad Tidings unto you, who continue
Christ's unfeigned Disciples, the same writteth bitter things against you that
forsake your own Mercy. Methinketh the Genius of this present Text is much like
unto that good Angel specified Mat. 28.2.
by S. Matthew; such as seek for Jesus, them it Mat. 28.5.
gratifieth, them it fills with holy Mat. 28.8.
fear, them it fills with great Mat. 28.8.
joy. But as for the enemies of Christ, them it Mat. 28.4.
shakes; of them it makes Mat. 28.4.

Methinketh, I know thy thoughts which come into thy mind, every one of them;
but shall Jer. 16.20.
a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods? or wilt thon Jer. 51.26,
25, 24.
hew unto thy self a stone for a corner, or a stone for a foundation, out of a

view, numbered among the enemies of Christ, thou would (but they are but vain
thoughts) thou would, as one Jer. 17.9.
desperately wicked, sear thy conscience with a hot Iron; thou would give
thy self over unto thine own hearts lust; one (nay, peradventure, each) of
these three evils thou will flee unto (who shall be sorry for thee?) thou will
with the Adder, stop thine ear against God; or, (if thou give him the hearing)
thou will, with the serpent, open thy mouth against God; or, (if thon bite in

Lest they should tingle at the hearing of all those evils which menace thine
unregenerate estate, 1. Subterfuge shaken.
thou foolishly stopest thine ears like the Adder, (a vermin) already, like

of thy conscience, wicked will thou be, even forcing thy self upon Jer. 8.6.

battle: but shall thou Psalm. 56.7.
escape by thine iniquity? No no, (rash soul) this is nothing else, but to leap
from the checks of a frying conscience into the flames of everlasting burnings,
as the guilty soul of Judas did: forlorn wretch, Who Job 9.4.
has hardened his heart against God, and has prospered? Thereafter as a man
fears, so is Psalm. 90.11

watning by Judas; he Mat. 26.24. John 6.70.13.21, 27.

stupidity of him, the deafness of him, whose Prove. 28.9.
end thou dare not think of; do not 1 Cor. 10.22.
provoke the Lord to anger, as he did. If a servant, if a slave spoke unto
thee, thou would vouchsafe an ear even unto him; and dare thou Jer. 5.22.
stop thine ear, dare thou Jer. 32.33.
turn thy back when the God of heaven calls? Be not another Judas; give ear
and hearken unto Christ's words, Mat. 4.17

heathen could pronounce it equal and just, That, who so is willingly led into
sin, should be against his will drawn unto punishment: and Truth 2 King. 7.9.
reveals, That, every sin is a vengeance unto it self; while one and the same
word, therefore signifies the evil of punishment, because it Genesis 4.7.19.15. 2 Samuel 12.13. Isa. 6.7. (...)
signifies the evil of sin; and fitly; for as the disunion of the James 2 26
soul from the body, is the death of the body; so the disunion of good from the
soul, is the Genesis 2.17.
death of the soul; wherefore impossible it is, that a reasonable Creature
should Pro 8.36.14.14. Genesis 20.3. Deuteronomy. 30 15. Numb. 32.23.
choose sin, and refuse death: yet thou, who Joh. 8.24 1 Cor. 2.14.

not upon thine own unregenerate heart, but upon the permission of the holy God,
even of that God who not only Josh. 24.15

reply against thy Lord the King, thy King and thy God! whereas, it is thy

pleasure, murmurest and disputest: why (say thou) why Romans 9.19.

have Isa: 63: 3, 4
chosen death rather then life! He (earnesty endeavoring thy preservation)
vehemently calls out, Why Ezekiel: 18: 31
will thou die? for thy part, answer Rom: 13: 9

3. Now that the worm gnawing thine evil conscience, has smitten this gourd
also, guilt seems to turn bank-rupt, and so whispereth unto thee, as if thy
sinfulness were now so beyond all pardon, that it were now to no purpose to
serve the Lord: Well, I will not extenuate thy guilt; for what Joh 27: 8
is the bope of the Hypocrite? and what is tby strength that thou Joh 6: 11 9:
2, 3
should hope? yet, say not thy sins are more then God can pardon; but (speak
truth) say, thy sins are more then thou will part with. When Israel Jer: 2: 25
exclamed, There is no hope, God drew aside his Vizard, and called unto him,
Withold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: just so,
thou, if thou unmask thy seeming despair, may find that thou art now, more
theu ever, exalting thy heart against the great God; having wearied thy self in
the greatness of thy ways, thou would now lie down in thy shame: I therefore
beseech thee (who so ever thou art that lie under this Temptation) see what
an idle shift this of thine is: It is merely a device to convert guilt into
sloth; to add drunkenness unto thirst; to despise the long-suffering and
goodness of a patient God; to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath I to
blow the coals of Juniper, and to heap those coals upon thy Psalm: 68: 21
wounded head! He that is wicked, let him, Rev: 22: 11
if he dares, be wicked still, says God; it should seem thou dare! but, ere
ever thou leap into the bottomless pit, look a little; for, if Judas could not
undergo the scrutiny of his own conscience, how can thou Psalm: 1.5
stand in judgment? if he were such a Coward that he could not find in his
heart to break off sin by righteousness, how can thou away with unquenchable
flames? I tell thee, that Mat: 25: 26
servant had never been so wicked, had he not been so sloathful: Whether is
easier, to pluck out thy right eye, to cut off thy right hand, and to exercise
a godly sorrow for the present, or to endure weeping, and wailing, and gnashing
of teeth for ever? in one word, had Judas had the grace to have industriously
followed S. Peter's example in Repentance, he had not died in his sins, he had
never been a Traitor unto himself, nor unto his Lord, the blessed Redemer of
lost mankind.

2. This Scripture shakes unbelievers for being so guilty. Ye that are none of
you in my Text, 2 For being so guilty.
ye who have hitherto despised grace, ye who have professed your selves to have
been Christians, who have thought your selves to have been Disciples, but have
refused (unto this very day!) to follow Christ; the whole Genius of this Text
does shake you inside out; it shakes you over and over.

1. 1 In troubling their heart.
Notwithstanding so many perplexities were hard at hand, might not these
Disciples hearts be troubled? Then, woe Isa: 3: 11
to the wicked, it shall be ill with him: the wicked are like a Isa: 57: 20
troubled sea, choked with their own mud: So long as Ahab sorsook Gods
Commandments, not Elijah, 1 Kin: 18: 18
but he troubled Israel: When Achan stole the wedge of gold, it was Josh: 7: 25
his own fault that he was troubled; he himself Pro: 15: 27
troubled his own soul: nor can there be found an excuse for thee, Oh thou vain
man, who suffer the death of sin to be ever gnawing upon thee; thy heart of
unbelief plucketh upon it self the worst of troubles; that of Gen: 4: 7 1 Samuel:
25: 31
sin and guilt. While thou do trouble thy self with every thing, except with
Luk: 10: 42 Phil: 2: 12.
what thou should, thou do take a course to bear thine iniquities.

2. This Scripture may make thee exceedingly shake and tremble, 2 In not
believing God.
for being so unworthy in thy dealing with the Majesty of God: thou can lean
to thine own understanding, but not unto Gods wisdom; thou can give credit
unto the father of lies, yet refusest to believe thy God which cannot Tit: 1: 2
lie; thou have Deuteronomy: 32: 20
no faith for the God of Truth; he made thee, he preserves thee, he provideth
in a plentiful manner for thee; he alone maintains thee, yet thou will not
dread his Pro, 1: 29: Mic: 6: 9
Threats, thou will not believe Psalm: 119: 66 Isa: 56: 4: 65: 12
his command, thou will not 2 Cor: 7: 1 3 In nor believing in Christ.
trust to his promises.

3. The Instruction in my Text reproves thee as for not believing in God, so
for not believing in Christ: This is the work of God, That ye Joh 6: 29
believe in him whom God has sent; but thou art for no such work; thou valuest
not his blood and wounds; he suffered death upon the Cross purposely for thee:
thou will not be at the pains to look Isa: 45: 22 Zech: 12.10
up to him: Hear him, says Mat: 17: 5
God; Hear him not, say thou: It is Mat: 24: 35
decreed, That his words shall not pass away; for thy share, for ought that
thou carest, they may all fall to the ground: He is John 14: 6
neither way, nor truth, nor life to thee; He is to thee 1 Cor: 1: 30
neither Wisdom, nor Righteousness, nor Sanctification.

4. The good Angel in my Text strippeth thee quite naked, leaves thee without
shelter, 4 In not heeding the Mansions.
justly suffers thee to shake again, for not so much as once minding the
house built without hands: Needs must the Luk: 14: 18
Farmer go to see the piece of ground which he had bought: The Inheritance
which is given unto thee, thou have no Contemplation for! When one upbraided
Diog. Laer. de vita Philos. lib. 2.
Anaxagoras for studying Philosophy so much, that he neglected his Country,
Anaxagoras (pointing his finger up toward heaven) replied, Nay the chief thing
which I regard, is my Country; thou, who too much mindest earthly things, that
finger points to thee; he thought himself Ibid. Psalm 8.3
born to behold the Moon, the Sun, and the Heavens; but thou (foolish Wretch)
art for no such Philosophy; thou art Jer: 2.12
encompassed about with the heavens, yet keep at a distance from them!
Ungrateful and heedless Wreth! the God of thy Being has been at the expense of
building for thy pleasure Princely Palaces, heavenly Mansions, but thou art
more for a nastie Dungeon.

5. 5 In all four neglects together.
Bind these several twigs into one Rod; ye that are none of them in my Text,
where is your understanding? How is it, that ye can forsake these Mansions;
yea, and God, and Jesus Christ also, for Eccle: 1.14
mere vanity and vexation of spirit? Is this reasonable, to exchange Gal: 6: 16
Peace for trouble, true Luk: 16: 11
riches for that Prove: 23: 5
which is not? To dote upon earth, Col: 3: 1
and forget heaven? Ah, how unthankful is that soul which would part with the
Mansions of heaven to purchase utter darkness? Again, where are your brains,
Isa: 5^: 13 57: 11. 54: 16, 17 Deuteronomy: 32.18 Jer: 5: 22: 2: 8
while ye trust the world more then God who made it? while ye exchange an
All-sufficient God for a Creature which cannot profit? Once more, is this common
sense to reject a mighty Isa: 63: 10 1.2.
Redeemer, and to entertain that 1 Pet: 5.8:
roaring Lion, which at this very instant gapeth to devour you? ye trust the
devil more then ye trust Jesus Christ who died for you.

Thou, who forsakest thine own mercy, review my Text: Does Christ, does Jesus
Christ use such bowels of affections? such affectionate reasonings? such
impulsive insinuations? and all little enough to remove trouble from his most
beloved Disciples heart? Tremble thou, then, at these two Questions.

1 Quest. 1 Quest.
If troubles were ready to swallow up these chosen disciples of Christ, can thy
Jer. 12.7.25.29.49.12.
heart (think thou?) escape untouched? If the 1 Pet 4.18.

unto the Esa. 57.21.

the horror of thy ruefull estate thou have no God to help thee, no Jesus to
save thee, no mansions to hide thee? If at these two questions thy heart Esa.
66.2. Act. 24.25.

2. Makes a dead man.


Thou who did never yet heartily follow Christ Jesus, if the two last
questions shake thee not, thou art none of Christ's; if thou art none of
Christ's, thou have a heart of unbelief; if thou have a heart of unbelief, thou
art then Luke 9.60. John 11.25.

heart, thine own Tombstone; thou do bury thy self alive; and art therefore
(worse then naturally) spiritually dead, stone-dead: this is a lamentation, and
it shall be for a lamentation; thou have not only cut off thy life in a
dungeon, but, [being in this unclean dungeon, in this pit of destruction, Lam.

thou have cast, thou have plucked a stone upon thy self.

4. stone not only not rolled away from thy dead heart, Finds this stone
sealed at the corners.
but there fixed; thou have set to thy seal that thou would have it so; the
several corners of thy corrupt heart are all of them sealed by thine own
mis-doings.

1. 1. Corner.
Thou have set to thy seal unto thine own natural insufficiency: thou art so
soaked, so dead-drunk in thy sinfulness, that, thou art not able to arise, and
walk uprightly, if Romans 7.18
thou would: even these Disciples in my Text which abode still with Jesus,
could not of themselves lay aside the troubles of their heart; Christ (ye see)
was fain to help them; again, of themselves they had never believed in God;
this was Jam. 1.17 Phil. 1.29
given unto them from above: in like manner, without John. 15.5
help from Christ they could not believe in Christ. As for the way unto Gods
heavenly mansions, they could not know that neither, until John. 14.8
Christ Jesus would first reveal it unto them.

2. As thou can not stir if thou would, 2. Corner.
so (the more is thy guilt) thou would not stir if thou could; thou
can not 2 Cor. 3.5
think of it; thou will not 1 Cor. 2.14
hear with that ear; thy Romans 8.7
carnal mind holds an enmity against God, thou will never be willing if
Phil. 2.13
God work not a will in thee: What draw near unto the pure God? unto the
sincere Christ? inhabit that house wherein the holy Father, the holy Jesus,
the holy Spirit dwell? no mind, no maw to that (thou!) as for thee, thy
delight is in looseness, and in 2 Cor. 6.15, 16
profaneness; as for God, his delight is in purity, and in holiness; small
lust have thou to acquaint thy self with this God, or with this Christ in my
Text: thou have lived hitherto a Ephesians. 4.18 Pro. 17.16
stranger unto all holiness, and naturally (to this very hour) thou alienatest
thy self from the most Holy; thou know neither holy Father, nor holy Son,
nor holy Ghost, that thou should desire them; let them divide their mansions
among themselves for any thing that thou carest: that's a second corner sealed.

3. 3. Corner.
A third seal sixing this stone upon thy dead heart, is this; namely, Had
thou from within thy self a sufficiency, had thou from within thy self a good
will too; nevertheless, the evil which thou have drawn upon thy self,
creates thine own hinderance: thou have contracted guilt, and this guilt has
Psalm. 58.3
made it natural to thee to be a child of Ephesians. 2.3
wrath: a stone Pro. 27.3
is heavy and sinketh downward, and just such is thy conscious heart; guilt
finds thee within a Hos. 13.9
pit of destruction, within a deep pit of self-destruction, and there it
keeps thee: God is 1 John 3.20
greater then thy heart, and knows all things; mean while thine own
conscience condemns thee over and over, and (lo!) the guilt of thine own
conscience keeps thee aloof from Gods presence: thou art rightly Adams brat;
if God call thee, thou Genesis 3.8, 10
hidest thy self. Thy heart reproves thee for not believing the Deuteronomy. 7.9
faithful God; thy heart reproves thee for not receiving the Lords Christ;
thy heart reproves thee for not preferring the mansions of Heaven before the
torments of Hell; and knowing so ill by thy self, thou playest least in sight;
thou have forfeited thine own peace, by troubling thine own soul, yet seek
not for peace in Christ! Yea, thou have so dis-countenanced the Ministry of
reconciliation, so despised the Spirit, so neglected thy Redeemer, and so
defaced the Fathers image, that though (such is their goodness) the Trinity
of Persons would show thee compassion, thou have not confidence to look them in
the face. Thou have repeated contumelies, and obstinacies against Heaven, and
may justly wonder that thou art not already in Hell. True heavenly mansions
there are, but, thou fanciest them too near the Lodgings of a provoked
Governor: (could thou hope for mercy,) alas, thy title Non est censendus
haeres qui non festinat ad haereditatem.
seems lost, thorough want of timely claim; grant thy claim to continue
valid, thou can not knock at heaven gates for pure shame; they indeed are
open, but thy tardie heart blusheth to look toward them: this the third: see,
now, the tri-angle in thy heart opposes it self against the Trinity in thy
God: I mean, there is never a corner in thy stony heart, whereon thou have not
sealed thine own doom, in despite of God, and of his free grace!

5. power, had thou a will, Finds this sealed stone. watched.
had thou a face too to overtake God in Christ at the heavenly mansions,
there yet remains one hinderance, which rendereth this stone of unbelief more
unlikely to be rolled away from thy heart, then did all the three former
circumstances together. Several of the inhabitants could not Genes. 29 8
remove that stone which lay upon the mouth of the Well at Haran; yet Jacob
(then strong in affections) could by himself Genes. 29 10.
alone roll it away: Vehement love may do much; nevertheless, I must assure
the unbeliever, that were his Zeal (although so it is not, but) were his Zeal
as fervent toward Gods heavenly Mansions as ever Jacobs was toward Labans
house, yet still his condition is far short of Jacobs; when Jacob heaved at
that weight, he found no opposers; but the Unbeliever, when he once striveth to
remove the stone from off his heart, he shall meet with as many Oppugners as
Genesis 26.
Isaac and his servants found.

Thou who art dead and buried in trespasses, and sin, as verily as thou
cherishest a heart of unbelief, so verily upon every sealed corner of that
stony heart of thine there is set a strict, a constant watch: look, how often
thou attemptest to undeceive thine heart, to shake off thine unbelief, and to
walk in newness of living; so often (though thou see them no more then
Elishaes servant 2 King. 6.16, 17
saw his friends) so often thou meetest enemies, more then one, or two. That
thou did Genesis 3.7
rashly cast thy self into that Genesis 3.5
pit which thine adversaries dug for thee, was Eccle. 7.29
thine own foolishness; that, being fallen into this open sepulcher thou, like
the Job. 38.30
lost waters under the earth, or like the carcasses in their graves, art hid
with a stone, is from thy self too; that, being Romans 23.32
shut up under unbelief, thou have affixed thine assent, is also thine own
wilfulness; but, now that all these evils are thus by thy self brought upon
thy self, the World, the Flesh, the Devil, they Mat. 27.66
set a strict watch, and keep a strong guard upon thy stone-dead heart.

Men, Fathers, and Brethren, ye have a little seen what a wretch he is, who is
none of you in my Text: by continuing in sin he would Mat. 28.12
conceal that ever Jesus Christ Col. 2: 12
arose from the dead: and, by adhering unto vanity, he would divulge that Mat.
28 13
Christ is Tit. 1.16 Phil. 3.18
stolen from him; but, by this shift, what good plotteth he for himself? Alas
(whether he will or no) he is shaken, he becomes a dead man; a stone of
unbelief lies upon the Mark 15 46
door of his heart, and that stone is Mat. 27.66
settled, fixed, and sealed with insufficiency, averseness, despair; he
wants a power, he wants a will, and says within himself, There is no hope.

We read of stones of Job. 28.3.
darkness, of stones of Ezekiel. 28 14
fire, and of Esa. 34.11
stones of emptiness: and we find them all three in the heart of unbelief.
Wretch! the world circumventeth thee, the world permits thee not to mind
that one Luke 10.42
only thing which is necessary; the world hurleth stones of emptiness at thy
head; the flesh, that 1 Pet. 2.11
warreth against thy soul, that slingeth stones of fire against thee; the Devil
he fooleth thee with delays, he lulleth thee to sleep on stones of darkness;
thou walk in thy sleep; thou walk in Joh. 12.35
darkness and know not whither thou go: (Poor creature) thy heart is
never free from the worst of troubles; and those troubles (alas) are but
forerunners of wrath to come, in as much as thou Jer. 5.3
have refused correction! Thou have no God to trust in, a God to Lev. 26.14 etc.

shut agoinst thee, but the gates of hell Psalm. 9.17 Esa. 5.14.
groan for thee; thou have like Psalm. 22.16
Shebnah dug thine own grave, even destruction, eternal destruction to thy
self; thy soul is among Lions, on whose Den a Dan. 6.17
stone is rolled and sealed; thou have of thine own accord gone Esa. 14.19

thou not Jer. 2.17.

like, thou have forsaken the Lord thy God? Know Jer. 2.23.
what thou have done; for thine own Jer. 2.19
wickednesses shall correct thee: this is thy lot, the portion of thy measures
Jer. 13.25
from the Lord, because thou have unthankfully forgotten him, and have, like
another Judas, trusted in falsehood.

Peradventure the Lord has, Gratifieth
and smite thee; With holy fear.
thy slumbering conscience is (thorough mercy) a little awakened; has, at
length, a little feeling; dreameth, now at last, what an evil thou cherishest
by maintaining enmities against the great God; for, Esa. 59: 18
he will repay fury to his adversaries, and recompense to his enemies?
Possibly, thou beginnest to perceive what a desperate presumption it has been,
to make it thy sport to crucify Heb. 6: 6:
Christ; for, had 2 Kings 9.31.
Zimri peace who slew his Master? Possibly, a foresight of judgment to come
has affected thy soul with present horror; for, the James 2.19.
Devils themselves believe and tremble; Which if thou, according to thy wonted
impenitencie, can not do, be confounded and astonished at the sense of thy
Esa. 1.2: Jude 15.
crying guilt. Except thou repent, and believe, lo vengeance is at hand, lies
ready in store, Mat. 3: 10: Esa. 65.6.
and will, in an hour which thou art not aware of, swallow thee up for ever and
ever! Alas, thou have foolishly and childishly Jer. 4.22 5.21, 25
like one stupid, or Stark madd, with all contempt and heedlesnesse, in the
most unthankful manner that malice it self can suggest, from thy youth up,
despised thy 2 Samuel 12.9 Number. 25.31 1 Samuel 2.30.
Lords pleasure, and thine own peace! No marvel then, if wrath already

2.17 Romans 6.23 Ezekiel. 18.4.
affrighting that from thy body; and will, in the end, seize again upon thine
unclean body, John 5.29
forcing that lump of sin to accompany thy lost soul, as well in suffering
torments, as in contracting guilt. Now, if the Lord has a mind to destroy
thee, Esa. 63.17 2 Chronicles. 25.20 Mat. 13.14, 15. Deuteronomy. 29.4.
he will go on to hide from thee these sore evils: but, possibly, the power of
the Word has wrought upon thee: possibly, thou art afraid of Gods judgments:
I trust, the Lord has caused thee to tremble at his threats: I hope thy heart
smites thee; I hope thou seek for Jesus; If so, then (but not until then)
be of good cheer, The Master calls thee.

I beseech thee therefore, (whosoever thou art) ponder thy life past; the
hours, days, weeks, months, years which thou have spent, not in service to,
but in rebellion against, a God patient indeed, but just, and Nahum 1.2.
jealous: Consider again, and again, that thou can not be at the same time in
a state of unbelief, and in the state of salvation too; (it will cost more then
so, to work out thy salvation:) would thou know in this thy day the things
which belong unto thy peace, thou would (what pains soever it shall cost
thee) watch and pray, and strive, and strive to make thy calling and election
sure. Hell flames are about thine ears, will thou lie still and be burnt in thy
bed? Art thou so foolish a Coward, that thou will wink while the Devil stabbeth
thee? Is it more tolerable to endure torments in hell, then to exercise
repentance upon earth? Are unquenchable flames more to be desired, then the
Mansions in heaven? Is it safer to continue a Judas, then to approve thy self a
sincere convert, and a sound believer? Will thou still refuse eternal life,
rather then accept of it upon Gods terms? I deal plainly with thee: unless thou
can truly say, I (...). Milesius Thales.
am not I: except thou can say, I my self was Joh. 3.7. Tit. 3.3.
such another Judas as is here secluded from these Disciples here spoken unto

thou may escape death; Death, that thou may seek life: I have heard of
one in a Swoon, who was mistaken for dead, laid out for dead, wrapped in a
Winding sheet, coffined, A familiar, but sad story related, and applied.
and buried too for dead; the same person awaking out of his Trance, and
finding himself coffined, by struggling for life, bruised his body to death:
Shall I apply this? He, when people thought him quite dead, was alive; thou (O
unbeliever) have a name that thou live, but art dead; He, when he found his
body buried, bruised it to death; could thou complain that thou art dead,
there were hopes of thy life; true, thy body of sin has indeed been (hitherto)
merely a black Coffin for thy departed soul; the worser Gravestone of the two
remains fixed on thy heart of unbelief as immoveably, as ever the dust of
death lay upon that interred friend; nevertheless, the good Angel in my Text
can, Mat. 28.2.
roll away this stone: He, who Joh. 11.44.
called Lazarus forth of his grave, can speak to thee; the dead Joh. 5.25.

our mothers womb; I acknowledge, that should thou depart this world before
thou art prepared for the next; should thy body die, before thy Soul lives
unto God, should thou be found in thy grave, and not found in Christ Jesus,
(I tremble to mention it) thou were then damned for ever: but such, such is the
forbearance of thy patient God, that Psalm. 95.7.
while he continues life unto thee, he continues unto thee a possibility of
escaping.

Object. Object.
How shall I Heb. 2.3.
escape, if I despise so great salvation?

Answ. Answer.
Salvation, great salvation, so great salvation is freely Hos. 14.4.
offered, that (I trust) thou can no longer despise it, if thou would.

Object. Object.
To me any offers of salvation are bat the savor of death unto death. 2 Cor.

Answ. Answer.
To thee they may be the 2 Cor 2.16
savor of life unto life.

An Offender so notorious as I am? 1 Pet. 4.18.


Answ. Answer.
The person speaking in my Text was Romans 4.5.
delivered for our Offenses.

The person here speaking in my Text, proclaims liberty Isa. 61.1.

Liberty unto Gods Romans 8.21.

Answ. Answer.
If thou Joh. 1.12.

Nay, first thou must partake of his Romans 8.9. 2 Cor. 3.5.

Object. Object.
By what means can so wretched an Unbeliever as I am, ever come to partake of
that spirit which I have so much grieved?

Answ. Answer.
By ordering thy self according to Gods revealed Mat. 7.7.
Will; Ask, seek, knock; in asking, seeking and knocking, rest not upon thy
performance, (make not means, Mediators) but upon Gods Isa. 40.27. 64 5.50.10.
Psalm. 27.14.37.34.
goodness; Wait, I say, Isa. 30.18.40.23.
upon the Lord; His wind blows when and where John 3.8. Prove. 13.12.
it lists. There is in thee no sufficiency, no propensity, no will; but there
is in God Psalm. 130.7.9.10.
plenteous Redemption; if he Isa. 43.13.
will work, who can Mic. 7.18.
hinder him? Look not for any thing from within Job. 14.4. Jer. 10.23. John
15.5. Romans 9.16.
thy self, but from him to whom God Mat. 17.5.
(upon all occasions) sends thee. The same God which gives thee more means
of knowledge then have Psalm. 22.28 Jonah 4.11. Mark 8.1, 2.
those brutish Indians who worship black and white Devils; the same God who
gives unto thee more means of grace then those Isa. 41 2.55.5. Jer. 4.2.10.7.
Zech. 2.11.8.22.
Turks have which worship Mahomet; the same God which, Isa. 38.19 Eccle. 8.113.
Dan. 4.17.
Psalm. 66.9. spares unto thee the breath of life, while Judas, Julian, nay,
while some born since thou were born, are grievously tormented in Hell; the
self same God would have thee Ezekiel. 33.11
escape the everlasting torments due unto thee, and to thy heart of unbelief:
Thy Rebellion Isa. 1.2, 4, 24. Nahum. 2.2, 6.
has been inexcusable, and thou lie wholly at the power of that King against
whom thou have rebelled: yet, lo, he offers Ezekiel. 18.32. Isa. 55.7.
a Free Pardon; yea, he offers terms of Peace every way for thine advantage:
thou Romans 8.7.
art at enmity with him, but, he has Love, free Hos. 14.4.2.19.
love, everlasting loves for thee; though Psalm. 9 17 11.6.
Hell be thy portion, fain would God entitle thee 1 Pet. 1.4.
to an inheritance in heaven. When thou have done all that ever thou can be
able to do, thou will be at the best but an Luke 17.10. compared with Mat.

honor thee with his service; as Deuteronomy. 3.1. Ezekiel. 6.9.
corrupt as thine affections are, God Hos. 2.14. Jer. 3.14. Isa. 54.5.
wooeth thee for them; as wicked as thy heart is, God Genesis 6.5. compared with
Jer. 4.14. and Prove. 23.26.
calls for it; if thou will not believe him, search the Scriptures; in them
he offers thee his Prove. 1.23
own Spirit, in them he offers unto thee his his own Son; Oh, he takes
glory, Luke 19.10. in saving so lost a sinner as thou art: Thou (witness thy
life past) thou have had no Psalm. 14.4.
knowledge of God, let it be Gods glory that he can cause thee to Jer. 24.7.
know him; thou have a stony heart of thine own, let it be the glory of thy
God, that he can Ezekiel. 36.26.
give thee a heart of flesh. The Lord has Deuteronomy. 29.4
not given thee a heart to perceive, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear unto
this day, let it now be his praise that he has gives thee a Pro. 20.12.
hearing ear, a seeing eye, and a believing Phil. 1.29.

putting his fear in thy inward parts; Happily, God has hitherto winked Act.

his free, his unsearchable mercies: the Luke 51.13.25.11. Dan. 9.9.
Lord forgive thy sins, for they are great; the Lord help Mar. 9.14.
thine unbelief, for thy heart is not steadfast; the Lord have compassion upon
thee, for Heb. 5.2.
thou art ignorant. The holy God can write his Law even in Jer. 31.33
thy heart; he can pour upon thee a Zec. 12.19
Spirit of Prayer, and of supplication. In all thy doings Ezekiel. 21.24.
thy sins appear, but, the person speaking in my Text, can take away those
Zech. 3.4. Isa. 64.9.
filthy rags from thine incurable wounds; thou have no Jer. 30.13.
healing Medicines, but the Physician in my Text, is the God of thy health; he
Jer. 30.17.
can heal thee, and all thy backslidings; he can cause thee to draw near, and
to Jer. 30.21.
approach, and to come with Heb. 4.16
boldness unto the Throne of His grace. Sinner, thou have 2 Kin. 17.17.
sold thy self to work wickedness; but, be no longer the Romans 6.16.
servant of a Devil, for Christ 1 Cor. 6.20.
has bought thee (and that not with corruptible gold, but) with his own blood,
his precious blood, his precious, his most precious blood! Greater love has no
man John. 15.130.
then this, viz. that he lay down his life for his friend; but Christ
commends his love toward thee, in that thou being Romans 5.8
an Enemy, a polluted, an inconsiderable, a contemptible enemy; and He being a
righteous, a holy person, (a person, therefore a man, Heb. 2.14
because a God) died, died the shameful death of the Cross, and despised the
shame, because he died for thee.

Who Romans 8.34
is he that condemns? It is the person speaking in my Text, that died: Thou,
who have been so careless of Christ hitherto, happily thou now turnest over a
new leaf; happily, thou will now Ephesians. 5.16
redeem thy time, and amend one; the Jer. 7.3.23.22.
evil of thy doings thou will put away from thee, if thy can; thou will be
renewed, Ephesians. 4.23. Col. 3.10.
(as well as thou can) in the spirit of thy mind; happily, thou art
mortified, and grieved, and full Zech. 12.10
of bitterness for the Eccles. 7.25
wickenness of thy folly; happily, thou resolvest to 2 Cor. 7.1.
cleanse thy self from all filthiness of the flesh, and of the Spirit, to give
1 These. 5.17.
thy self unto prayer, to exercise 1 Timothy 4.7.
thy self unto godliness, and to 2 Cor. 13.9.
strive after perfection all the days of thine appointed time; if so, this is a
good change of mind; in this thy good resolution go on and prosper: this
notwithstanding, (know) unless thou make the person speaking in my Text thy
Refuge, thy practice of Piety will never Heb. 10.22. Tit. 3.5.
quiet thy conscience: the reason is, though a Romans 8.15.
spirit of bondage may restrain thee from evil, and may press thee upon
duties, yet it can Ephesians. 2.9.
never render thee acceptable in the presence of an offended God: alas, the
best works that ever thou can perform, Tit. 1.15. Gal. 2.16.
shall never be able to satisfy the most infinite Justice of a provoked God;
no not Heb. 9.22
for the least of the least of all thine infirmities. Be as upright as ever
thou can, yet of all those innumerable debts due from thee unto thy Lord,
thou shall never be able to pay Mat. 5.26
one mite, that is sterling: if this alone be that Plea by which thou hopest to
Romans 3.20.24.
answer the Law, never, never look the severe Judge in the face: assure thy
self, that the just Judge of all the earth will do right: Judas Mat. 27.4
repented himself of his evil, and yet Judas Act. 1.25.
perished in his transgression, and so may thou, if thou hope to pacify God
by thine own righteousness.

How then shall my Conscience obtain peace with God? Dub.

vile in thine own eyes; let thy sins be always before thee, that thy heart may
always condemn thee; bear thine iniquities, ( viz. the guilt of them, and the
shame of them) the remaining days of thy misspent life; mean while, have an
eye Heb. 9.14 10.22 Rom 15.13, 9 Ephe. 1.7. Col. 1.10
of faith unto that satisfactory blood which the Person speaking in my Text
shed upon the Cross: believe it, (if thou can, for joy, believe it) with that
blood which thou, Judas-like, have trampled under foot, with that blood of
Jesus, (and only Heb. 1.3 Isa. 53.5 63.3
with that blood) is written thy free pardon, thine absolute acquittance, thy
general release Tit. 2.14 Rev. 5.9
from all guilt, debts, and trespasses whatsoever by thee committed, or upon
thee charged from the beginning of the world unto the great and last day, (that
terrible day of the Lord.) Sinner, John. 20.27, 29

Christ Mat. 11.27

spared not his own Son, but gave him up for thy ransom, how shall he not with
him also freely bestow upon thee the gift of faith? Tell me, has God so John

a more Ephesians. 1.7 Acts 20.28. 1 Timothy 1.14.

unto the Heb. 12.2.
author and finisher of thy faith, this man Mic. 5.5.

the whole Law in thy stead; because he never brake the Law, thy transgressions
shall never be called in question, unless on purpose that thou may be
cleared at the general Aszises. And because thou have not wit to speak for thy
self, see the person speaking in my Text, he 1 John 2.1 Heb. 8.6.9.15.12.24

puts in thy Plea not Isa. 53.11 Romans 3.24 1 Cor. 6.11 2 Cor. 6.2 Ephesians. 1.6

And now ( if so be thou have heard the Ephesians. 4.21

reserve a jealous eye over thine unexperienced heart, lest, at any time, that

these following MOTIVES.

MOTIVE. Motive 1.

pleasure; they would seek his pardon, could they avoid his Psalm. 119.4
commands: but, be not thou thus ignorant; Oh consider, that although Joh.

Judas reject Christ still, and still expect damnation, yet still this neglect
of his does no Deuteronomy. 28.58
whit exempt him from homage: Despair is no Mat. 25.27 Mas. 3.13, 14
acquittance from duty: whether we be good or evil, Mat. 4.10 Deuteronomy. 10.12, 20

Lord over us, and we (whether we 1 Timothy 4.16
save our selves or perish) are bound Jer. 10.7.
to obey him. Walk among all the spirits in 1 Pet. 3.19
prison, those souls in hell that are now suffering torments there, they will
all enform thee, that, had they obeyed more, they had suffered less. Were it
utterly impossible for Judas to escape condemnation, yet still it is his
prudence to be as guiltless as he may be: The reason is, God Mat. 16.27
rewards every one according to his works, whether his works be fruits of
faith unto holiness, or of unbelief to unrighteousness. Were I a Reprobate, I
would be beaten with as few stripes as I could: but the 1 These. 5.9 2 Timothy 1.7.
Scripture offers more grace.

MOTIVE II. Motive 2.
Man's perfection before his Fall: When our late Rebellions grew monstrous, and
robbed us of the K. Charles the Second. Lam. 4.20
breath of our Nostrils, forcing the 1 Samuel 9.20
desire of our eyes to see many a sad day, and to 2 Timothy 2.3
endure hardness beyond the seas: as Mic. 7.8
dark as his afflictions were, his Isa. 62.3
Diamond shined in the thickest cloud, his serene Majesty reserved a luster;
how low soever he was brought in worldly exigencies, yet still he cherished
within his royal bosom the soul of a King: how deserted so ever, he did, and
would, live like a Prince. Imitate thou thy most exemplary Sovereign: Leave
sordid actions unto Swine and Vermin, for thereunto they were Genesis 3 14 2 Pet.

created; mean while, consider thou thine extract; be not mean-spirited, for
thou art high Judge 8.18, 21
born. The world was created to serve thee, serve Psalm. 8.6.
not thou the world; neither become a slave unto thy lusts, for God Genesis 1.26
made thee a master of thine affections: during his innocence Adam knew no sin;
abhor thou to be acquainted with it. God made thee for Isa. 43.7
himself, change not so great a Master: He made thee Eccl. 7.29 Deuteronomy. 32.5
upright, do not thou grow crooked: he made thee Genesis 1.31 27.
good, be not thou evil: thou did resemble the King thy Father once, renew in
thee the beauty 2 Cor. 3.18.
of his Image; strive after Holiness, because he 1 Pet. 1 15 Mat. 5.48.
is holy; after perfection, because he is perfect: affect to be like so
heavenly a Father, wear his Righteousness, tread in his steps; follow him Ephesians.
5.1 Phil. 2.15

in Adam, remember thou from whence thou art fallen: Let the world confess that
Alexander is indeed the son of the Macedonian Philip: I say, in all thy
Tran^actions, remember Eccl. 12.1
thy Creator; Adam Luke 3.38

from the roots, with much ado, I planted it again: for why? it may (nay it
September. 1662. Psalm. 148.7, 9

cast into the fire for fuel: In like manner, be it, that Isa 5.24

but devour thee as stubble, the flame can but consume thee as chaff. I say,
conclude it altogether impossible to escape Everlasting burnings; it is but

provision which Adam left, the Famine will consume us; now, therefore, let us
fall into the hands of the all-sufficient God; if he save us alive, we shall
live; if he kill us, we can but die.

Ere we can bury our dead out of our sight, such is our affection, we rub, we

chafe the breathless body, to wit, if by any means our friend may recover life
before he go hence, and be no more seen: just thus deals thy merciful God
with thy soul: thou Psalm. 7.11
have provoked him every day, and every day he has waited Isa. 30.18, 65.2
to be gracious; his sentence though Jer. 4.12 Eccles. 8.11
pronounced, is not executed: between thee and death, there is scarcely one
step; nevertheless God has not given thee over to that death, (I mean that
which enumerateth all the curses due unto thy sins, death eternal;) True, thy
life is as Genesis 47.9 1 Cor. 7.29
short as evil; and although short, far spent, yet quite spent it is not.
Thoroughout the whole year the Malva horaria has but one single hour wherein
to blossom; and from the beginning of ages, unto all eternity, thou have no
more space wherein to bring forth the fruits of saving faith, then is the short
remainder of Psalm. 95.7 6.5 88.11 Eccles. 11.3 9.10 John 11.9 9.4 1 These. 5.5
thine uncertain hour, the fag end of thy fleeting days: should this last
scantling of thy misspent life bring forth no blossom, confess I must, there
would then remain no way for thine escape: then (indeed) thy sad soul would be
troubled, perpetually troubled, everlastingly troubled, troubled so long as
conscience, and horror, and darkness, and brimstone, and torments, and hell,
and devils, and an avenging God shall endure! The patient God he fore-knows all
this: and, fore-knowing all these Judgments to come, such is his goodness, he
has inched out thy Job 21.17
wasted candle unto this very minute; on purpose, that from this instant
forward, thou may 2 Pet. 3.9
redeem thy time and thy self. I say, God gives unto thee Rev. 2.21
space to repent, though but a little space. Before thou return again unto the
womb of the earth, thou, Zarah like, do but just James 4.14 Genesis 38.28, 29
thrust out thine hand; yet, rather then this breach should be upon thee, thy
Mediator imparteth unto thee his scarlet thread: He Romans 2.4^

even the life of grace, and of glory. Redeem Ephesians. 5.16
the time, for thy days have been evil. While it is called today, let the
goodness of thy God lead thee now, at last, unto repentance. Others make the
continuance of their life, and health, an occasion of delays, until their
delays on earth become lamentation in hell; but, what Eccl. 9.10
thy soul finds to do, that do thou presently: One moment now, is worth Psalm.

servant which would be found Mat. 24.45

a true account, the debtour that would honestly pay Mat. 18.26
all he owes, interprets Gods forbearance Romans 2.4
as a very great kindness. What would Dives, Luke 16.28
what would Judas give for the benefit of one only of those few hours which thy
long-suffering God denies unto them, but vouchsafes unto thee? Time Rev. 10.6

choose but take notice; it is a doomsday alarm: Of all those talents wherewith
we sons of Adam are entrusted, there it none of so great moment, Mat. 25.24, 27

MOTIVE V. Motive V.
Gods Sentence. As sure as death, in the grave there is (as I just now told
thee) no Redemption: when once sentence is passed Eccle. 11.3 Mat. 25.46
upon examination had, there is then no repealing. so soon as ever thy farthing

candle is burnt out, thy soul, if it savoureth not sweet in heaven, it is cast
into the fire of hell, and all this in a moment, in 1 Cor. 15.52
the twinkling of an eye, sooner then thou can think of it: At this very
instant, how immediately can thou, (the image of Gods Omnipresence) how
immediately can thou think of hell, although hell be so great a distance off?
how immediately can thy thoughts ascend even the highest heavens? Swift was
that (last) thought of thine; but, thy souls flight shall be swifter then was
thy last thought. Man (for want of consideration) wastes hours, and minutes;
the Dau. 7.9
ancient of days does not so: Unto him, who inhabiteth eternity, every little
time is so precious, that in less space then the space of one moment, he
dispatcheth the soul from this prison of flesh, unto his high Court of Justice;
and again from his high Court of Justice, unto the place of execution, or of
glory, (as Justice shall give sentence:) I say, thy breath of life once
expired, thy winged soul is allowed no time at all to look back, (no) it
forthwith appears before the judgment 2 Cor. 5.10
seat of God, and from thence forthwith unto the joys, or miseries, by order,
appointed: Thy flesh indeed, that is dispensed with until the general John 6.40
Assizes; but (her Proxy) thy spirit that gives her appearance upon the very
first day of the Term. While thy breathless bosom is yet warm (either for thee,
or against thee) sentence is pronounced: I therefore again exhort, that thou
would make thy peace with thy God while life, nay while health continues;
for, with thy dying body dies all hopes of future repentance; When death is
once come, opportunity is gone; Opportunity is therefore gone, because
Judgment is come. Motive 6.


MOTIVE VI. Death approaching: it steals upon thee while thou sleep:
Could thou return into thy first Infancy, and thence begin 1 Cor. 9.24
the race that is set before us, thine advantage were little enough, either for
the running of a race so long, or for the obtaining of a prize so high; but,
alas, a great part of thy life is already consumed; and already consumed in
vanity; thou art almost out of breath, before thou have, at all, buckled Luke
12.35
thy self to thy work: The Affairs which thou in this thy pilgrimage must of
necessity perform, are exceeding great; but, exceeding Genesis 47.9
small is that space of time wherein thou must disspach them: although thy
duties are not easily compassed, thy life is quickly Psalm. 39.5
spanned: thy life is, at longest, but a winters day; thine employment is the
business of a whole age: of this thine employment an account thou must give;
but how soon, Act. 1.7
it is not for thee to know: Thou see on every side many much younger then
thy self, called away to give up their accounts; and of them none so
unexpectedly as those who were the healthiest persons: Such as least look for
him, meet their Mat. 24.44
Lord first; if ever he Rev. 3.3
come upon thee as a thief, it is then when time steals from thee to thy
disprofit: rather then death should overtake 1 These. 5.4
thee, meet it; die daily, if thou would live for ever: if thou would not
forget thy self, Deuteronomy. 32.29
remember thy last end; if at any time thou art more unprepared to give up thy
last account then other, at that time above all others look for, and hasten
unto the coming 2 Pet. 3 12
of the day of thy God; if in that day thou would be found faithful, in this
thy day abide watchful; persevere in well doing, if thou would endure unto
the end; redeem thy time; if thou would enjoy thy Redeemer; and if thou
would not fear death, fear God.

MOTIVE 7. Motive 7.
A seventh Motive inviteing thy soul to hold fast that which is good, is thy
natural insufficiency: At thy first Creation there was in thee the spirit Genesis
1.26
of a God; the light of that spirit Adam quenched, and (in Adam) thou: In
baptism, the same spirit entered into a Covenant with thee; the same spirit
thou have again grieved, and quenched: none of all his mighty workings have
prevailed upon thy heart; carnally minded thou have been, spiritually minded
thou would not be: Of all those graces which the holy Spirit of God may
justy call for, thou can not produce one! Consider now, thou have failed of
Furor est post omnia perdere naulum.
his saving gifts; will thou render the common gifts of that bountiful spirit
useless too? the more ungrateful thou have been in rejecting the one, the more
thankful thou should be in making a benefit of the other; the greater want
thou find of that sufficiency which thou might have had from God, the
greater reason thou have to plow up the fallow ground of thy heart, that thou
may sow to the spirit; if thou have been so unfaithful that God would not
adventure with thee his ten talents; be so trusty, that God may not repent him
of that one talent now in thy hands; or, if thou have embesled that Talent,
yet, at least, restore unto God his napkin: having robbed thy Master of his
moneys, do not keep from him his purses too: thou have cut off thy Jer. 10.23
legs, therefore use Psalm. 25.12 Hos. 6.3
crutches; the more thou have dulled thine Eccl. 10.10
axe, the more pains thou must take in hewing; thou have blunted the edge of
the spirit: it concerns thee to make the best use thou can of thine
affections, thy memory, and thine understanding; the more graceless thou
appearest, the more thou art obliged to use all means of grace: the Word of God
is two-edged; as I cannot hope for salvation, without the help of Gods Spirit,
so neither can I Pro. 1.23 Luke 11.13. Romans 10.17
expect the help of Gods Spirit, unless I wait for it in the use of means: I
Luk 16.11, 12 Mat. 25.23, 28
must be faithful in my natural abilities, if I would be entrusted with
spiritual. Beside, God Luke 1.53.29
fills the hungry with good things; the more empty thy vessel, the more
capacious it is to receive the 2 Kin. 4.6
ointment of the holy One; and the poor in spirit, wax rich in grace.

MOTIVE VIII. Thy natural averseness. There is no such Trewant as the natural
man; Motive 8.
Judas will rather hang himself, then delight in his Masters pleasure: but,
first, mere shame will reduce thee from this ingratitude: no love for thy
father? nor love for thy Redeemer? nor love for thy preserver? fie! fie, for
shame! the ox Isa. 1, 3
knows his owner, and the dog, at thy heels, his master. Secondly, Let thy
heart alone, and thou 1 Cor. 2.14
wilt love thy God less next day, then thou will to morrow, and less to morrow
then to day thou do. Thirdly, Thou must not follow, but Col. 3.1
lead thine affections; we force our selves to delight in such diets, such
exercises, such employments as most suit, not with our pleasure, but with our
real good. Fourthly, What thanks is it, if we place our affections upon that
whereunto we are of our selves addicted? but, herein we know that we love our
God, if we deny Mat. 16.24
our selves, that we may love him. Lastly, remove thine ignorance, and thy
dis-affection is removed; once see the beauty of holiness, Exodus 15.11
and be out of love with it, if thou can; thou will therefore love God,
because God is glorious in holiness, thy Lord most holy.

MOTIVE IX. Motive 9.
A ninth Motive which may stir up thy mind to follow God fully, is thy
desperate guilt. The whole need not the Physician, but, thou do: such a
sinner as thou art, may well cry God mercy all the days of his life; He that
has wallowed in so much mire as thou have done, has great reason to wish
Ezekiel. 36.25
for clean waters; who should thirst after sanctification, if thine Ethiopian
skin should not? the Leopards spots are white to thine: if the blood of the
Lamb can make thy crimson sins whiter then snow, surely, thou have cause
sufficient to bath in that warm blood! thou have sinned so prodigally against
heaven, and against God, that, it is the best of thy skill to make benefit of
Christ merits; Then, then the holy Angels will Luke 15.7.
rejoice indeed, when they see such a lost creature as thou have been, take the
kingdom of heaven by violence, and main force.

MOTIVE. Motive 10.
X. A tenth particular which helps thine unwearied soul to take the kingdom
of heaven by violence, is the present evil world: viz. unless it were better
then it is; thou will no more Jam. 1.27
dirty thy self with it; the cares thereof may choke such as love them, but
thee they drive unto 1 Pet. 4.19
thy faithful Creator; to him that endured temptations in the wilderness,
Canaan is sweet: pleasures upon earth may ensnare fools; they only mind thee of
thy masters joys; thou translatest the whole book of nature into a book of
grace, well knowing, that the things which are seen are transitory; but the
things which are not seen, are eternal.

MOTIVE XI. Motive 11.
The next particular serving to awaken thee unto righteousness, is the
corruption of thine old man: For, first, while Gal 5.17
thy flesh is contrary to thy spirit, his thou Romans 6.16
art unto whom thou yieldest obedience; and if it was thy Romans 8.6.
death to be carnally minded; to be spiritually minded is a sign of life.
Again, sometimes a 2 Cor. 12.7
buffet or two does Saint Paul a kindn^ss; 2 Cor. 12.9
while the flesh 1 Pet. 2.11
warreth against thy soul, thy soul is Deuteronomy. 8.2 Judge. 2.21, 22 3.2
kept upon her guard: Rome is not secure, so long as Carthage is standing: nay,
opposition strengthens the prevailing party; as 2 Samuel 3.1
Saul's rebellions established David in his Throne; for infirmities of nature
excite the power of grace: Corruption is flesh, and Isa. 31.3
not spirit.

MOTIVE XII. Motive 12.
The roaring lion at this instant seeking to devour thee: Among too too many
Ministers, who, during our late detestable rebellions, were most reproachfully
tossed out of their livelyhoods; one I knew, who Mr. Vade of Odington in
Gloucestershire
would full often, with indignation enough, boast himself a person more
beholding unto Committee Men then unto all the kindred which be had; his riddle
was, while he kept house in his Parsonage, diseases, cares and debts grew upon
him; but, so soon as the Committee had once for ever sequestered (from Him) his
Parsonage, they, (from that time forward) eased him of his debts by disposing
his fifths for their payment; they cured him of his disease, while want of a
horse made him walk away his Gout; and, withal, they freed him from his cares,
for he had now no worldly thing to care for: (bear with me) the condition is
thine; I may seriously affirm that, next unto God himself, this Matt. 6.13
13.39.
evil one is (although full Esa. 10.7.
sore against his will) the very best friend whom thou have in the world; if
thou have but eyes of understanding in thy head, this I will clear unto thee in
three particulars. The Devil Ephesians. 6.12. 1 Pet. 5.8.
befriendeth thee, first, By deterring from sin; Ah, Sir, this Bugbear at the
gate will make thee 1 Timothy 3.6 7.
keep within doors; the saucer eyes of this spright will make thee look unto
thy self; epsy once his cloven foot, and adventure Act. 24.16.
abroad if thou dare. Secondly, By Temptations; thou will not trust a
reconciled enemy; The Devil is so Ephesians. 6.11 2 Cor. 2.11
well known, that none of his chaff can catch old birds; if he begin to tempt,
he will make thee glad to cling unto thy father; Thy fear of this Pursevants
Arrest Heb. 4.16
will make thee take Sanctuary; the more stratagems this subtle creature uses
to 2 Timothy 2.26
entice thee toward hell, the more thy holy jealousies will draw thee toward
heaven; and all the while this Avenger lasheth thee 1 Kin. 12.11
with Scorpions, he Gal. 3.24
schooleth thee unto Christ. Thirdly, Ephesians. 6.11
by wrestlings: carnal 1 Pet. 2.11
lusts war against the soul; but we wrestle not against flesh and blood alone;
these are no equal match for him that Psalm. 23.4 27.12
undertaketh to be strong in the Lord; that is a Heb. 22.4 Sine periculo seiget
ludus.
dull skirmish which hazardeth no blood: Surely thou shall see what thy servant
can do, says the 1 Samuel 28.2
Warrior. As the Martyr Juliano kissed the step whereon he stood to suffer
death; so thou, when valiant, wilt kiss the turf whereon thou stand to fight
thy Lords battle. Glad is David, if he may be but allowed to deal with 1 Samuel
17.32
a Goliath: if Jether Judge. 8.20
fear Zebah, and Zalmunna, it is because he is yet a youth; a Gideon will make
make them his Judge. 8.21
ornament.

MOTIVE XIII. To omit many others, Motive 13.
the last Motive which now presses, why thou should return: why, if thou
return, thou should return unto the Lord; and why, if thou return unto the
Lord, thou should return unto him with thy whole heart, is, The compare Ex.
7.13 with Job 23.16. Genesis 19 11. with 21.19. Numb. 22. v. 25 with ^ 31. 2 King.
6.20, ^: 18 17. Luke 24.16, 31 and John 20.14 with Dan. 3.25 Deuteronomy. 29.4. with 2 Timothy 2.21 Deuteronomy. 5.29 with Isa. 59.1, 2 and sim. 6.9.
power of God. Whence was it, that, heretofore, what evil thou were loath to
commit in the sight of man, that thou could boldly perpetrate before the
face of the Genesis 16.13.39.9
ever-present God? Whence was it, that the very same affections of thine which
have been Phil. 3.19
so mindless of spiritual blessings, have been so inordinate unto vile lusts?
or, that the same understanding of thine which is so wise Romans 3.11, 18.
in the things of this world, is so far to seek in the things of a better
world? If thou know not whence this is, I will resolve thee; the thing is of
God, viz. from the power of his justice: Now, the same God which can in justice
leave thee to thy foolishness so far as to make thee fear Romans 3.18
man, more then the face of the most holy: The same God can in mercy bring unto
thee thy right senses, and make thee fear to do evil; if for man's sake, for
Gods John 5.9 Jer. 5.22
sake much more: The same God which could suffer thine affections to go
awhoring after their shame, Psalm. 25.12
can place them upon the things above: and the same God which suffered thy
brains to weary themselves in studying how to ensnare thy self in the world,
the same God can, when he shall so please, make thee Psalm. 51.6
wise unto salvation. True, 2 Cor. 3.5
were there not a power in God able to give unto thee, what he expects from
thee, there were then some cloak for thy backslidings: but the same God which
Ezekiel. 18.32
bids thee turn, is able Jer. 31.18 Lam. 5 21
to turn thee; and therefore he Prove. 1.23
reproves thee to this end, that through his strength, thon may turn unto
him. The same God which calls thee unto 2 Pet. 3.9
repentance, can Act. 5.31
give repentance, and therefore he Hag. 1.5 Rev. 2.5
instructs thee to consider thy ways, that thou may by his help gain
repentance: The same God which requires Deuteronomy. 28.58
thy fear, can Jer. 32.40
put his fear into thine inward parts; and therefore he Deuteronomy. 4.10.17.19 Prove.
3.2 Psalm. 19.7
directs thee to the Scriptures, that thou, by them, may learn to Hos. 3.5
fear the Lord and his goodness. The same God which commands 1 John 3.23
thee to believe; can Phil. 1.29
give thee a power to believe, and therefore Romans 10.14
instructs thee, that faith comes by hearing. The same God which Ephesians. 5.18
wills thee to be filled with the Spirit, is able to Joel 2.28
pour out spirit upon all flesh, and therefore advises thee how Luke 11.13
Prove. 1.23 Gal. 3.5
thou should obtain it. In a word, God who Rev. 22.17
would have thee come unto Christ, is able Joh. 6.44
to draw thee unto him; which that he may do, he Mat. 17.5 Heb ^2.25
calls unto thee from heaven; and a John. 1.37 9.38
smaller invitation then that by far has served to make others deny
themselves, and follow Jesus. Would thou Number. 23.10
have heaven drop into thy mouth? open thy mouth wide, and it Psalm. 81.10
will so; not Mat. 7.21 Qui sicit te sine te, non servabit te sine te.
else.

Wherefore, O thou, who have so Romans 9.32, 33
dangerously stumbled at the rock of offense, that I have hitherto Gal. 4.11
stumbled at thy fall: thou, gone so far Joh. 13.30
from the person speaking in my Text, that I have left my Text it self to
follow thee: thou whom I found with Judas, but would bring back to Jesus; (with
tears I ask thee) What shall I do at the great and terrible day of the Lord?
Shall I call God to witness, that thy Hos. 13.9 2 Pet. 3.9 1 These. 1.10 5.9
perdition is of thy self? Shall I call Judas to witness, that thy damnation is
Joh. 3.19
just? or may I with Luke 15.7
holy Angels, joy at thy conversion? Thy life may end before to morrow; yet, as
short as thy life is, (before it does end) know, One drop of the Lambs blood is
able to dissolve even thine 1 Pet. 1.2
adamant. The Word of thy God is a Jer. 23.29
hammer sufficient to deal with thy Psalm. 19.7
nether-milstone; it can make it a hewn stone, it can carve it into several
Mal. 3.17
Jewels, into Jewels engraven after the similitude of thy 2 Cor. 3.18
Redeemer. Destroy not thou that Romans 14.15
soul for which Christ died.

For my part, what 1 Kin. 19.20
have I done unto thee? if a greater then Elijah has cast his mantle of
righteousness upon thee: What Joh. 13.17. Eccles. 9.10
thou do, do quickly: sacrifie 1 Kin. 19.21 Romans 12.1
thy self unto him: minister unto him of thy Luk 8.3 Mat. 3.8
substance, bring for him thy Luk 23.56 Mat. 25.4
best ointments: See the Luke 23.55. Joh. 5.39
place where he is laid; look Mat. 28.1 Gal. 6.14
toward his sepulcher, and while thou Mark 16.4 Psalm. 32.5
look, thou shall find the stone rolled amay, yea, as undoubtedly as Mat.
11.28, 29, 30. John 6.37.
thou seek Jesus who was crucified, so undoubtedly the good Angel in my
Text, the person here speaking, Jesus whom thou seek, shall number thee
among his beloved Disciples; and as he comfort them, so, with the same
affections, and in the very same words, he shall encourage thee. Let not thy
heart be troubled, believe in God, believe also in me; in my Fathers house are
many Mansions.

THrough a neglect of seeking the Lord while Isa. 55 6 Psalm. 95.7 2 Cor. 6.2
compared with Dan. 3.9.3. Mat. 7.7.22.29 John 5.39
he may be found, To be believers
the unbeliever conceives Mat. 25.24
hard thoughts of his God: conceiving so hard thoughts of his God, he Luke
19.20 24
unthankfully wrappeth his talent in a napkin; at last, forfeiting Luke 19.26
that single talent for want of use, he uses his napkin Mat. 27.5
for want of a halter. In stead of ascending to heaven after Christ, of rising
to a lively hope in Christ, of crucifying it self with Christ, etc. the heart
of Judas could Mat. 27.3
see Christ condemned, and so Mat. 27.5
leave him. Wherefore, Christ will leave the name of Judas for Isa. 65.15
a curse unto his chosen. For, unto Isa. 65.11
such as forsake him, thus Isa. 65.13
says the Lord, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry; behold,
my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty; behold my servants shall
rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed: behold, they Isa. 65.14
that for sake the Lord, shall cry for sorrow of heart, they shall howl for
vexation of spirit: but, unto You in my Text, unto you his constant followers,
he says,

Let not your heart be trrubled; The Text opened.
Ye believe in God, believe also in me: In my Fathers house are many Mansions.

all spoken in a breath, so they do all breath out one, and the same
consolation. This Gospel is a kingdom of heaven in an unexpected sense. Look up
unto the heavens; in them, ye see one glory of the stars, another glory of the
Moon, another glory of the Sun; yet all these together, help to make up but one
Heaven: So, look down upon my Text: in it, ye see the trial of afflictions, the
exerctse of faith, and the expectation of glory; yet do all these make up but
one comfort. The Tabernacles of God, the Son of God, the God and Father of
Mercies, are all of them brought within this Text, purposely to ease the
Disciples hearts.

burden of the former: namely, this, DOCTRINE II. Even great afflictions may not
trouble a chosen Disciples heart.

1. That, even, the hearts of Christ's chosen Disciples are not exempted from
troubles in this life, sad experience evinceth; one Mat. 6.34
day tells another of this truth: our whole Job 14.1
life, the whole Joh. 16.33
world, constantly afford witnesses of this complaint. 2. On the other side,
since Heb. 12.11
no chastening, for the present, seems joyous, but grievous; seeing, as a
Prove. 27.3
stone, so, 1 Pet. 1.6 1 Samuel 25.37
affliction, is heavy; it shall be my care, to ease you of your griefs; and to
remove, if not the stone it self, yet a great part of its heaviness.
Wherefore, not questioning the former Doctrine, the Doctrine implied: I shall
prosecute the later, the Doctrine expressed: while I First, The Method.
State what Doctrine I would propose. Secondly, Prove the Doctrine which I
state. Thirdly, Apply the Doctrine which I prove.


There be many that say unto us, Psalm. 4.6
who will show us any good? but, Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance
upon us. Beloved, let not my weakness be your discouragement: although I of my
self 2 Cor. 4.7
cannot turn your sorrow into joy, or your mourning into gladness, the good

can; Where the word is, the Word of a God, although the voice be the voice of
a man, yet if that voice speak, dry bones Ezekiel. 37.4, 7.
may live. Upon occasion, other Disciples as well as you once asked among
themselves, Mar. 16.3, 4
Who shall roll away the stone from the Sepulcher? And when they looked, they
saw the stone rolled away: the like may ye, if our God shall now vouchsafe to
sanctify unto you this Truth, namely, That even great afflictions may not
trouble a believers heart. I say; DOCTRINE. The Doctrine stated.
viz.

Though, during this life, sound believers are not exempted from great
afflictions, yet those great afflictions may by no means trouble their heart.

Object. At this we already stumble: What? Object.
if the righteous perish, may we not Isa. 57.1
lay it to heart? When great afflictions befall us, may not we well be
troubled? If the Lord strike, should not Jer. 5.3
man grieve? Must we be stupid, must we be Stoical when griefs are upon us?

Answer. Questionless, Answer.
we Mic. 6.9
ought to hear as well the rod, as him who has appointed it: this (...)
forbids no such laying to heart, it requires no such heedlesness. I say,
this Text prohibiteth, not a reasonable sense, but a Rev. 21.8
distrustful fearfulness; not a moderate care, but an 2 Cor. 7.10
unprofitable astonishment: (...) Phil. 4.6
(...), Be careful for nothing: this (...) signifies a carking care, a care
not furthering, but hindering duties. I would have you 1 Cor. 7.32
(...) without pensiveness. Let not your hearts be (...). Luke 21.34
overcharged, weighed down with cares. So here, (...), Let not your heart be
disturbed; let not your fountain of right reason be mudded; make not a
Tartarus, make not a hell of your heart: While our Savior here says, Let not
your heart be troubled, he v. 27. explaineth L. Brugensis ad variant. Lectiones
Lat. notae.
himself, (...), neither let it be dismayed.

Thus resolved; I trust, the longer while our troubles have stuck by us, the
sooner we shall be established in our present truth, which is; DOCTRINE: Even
great Afflictions should not perplex a believers heart.

Not to repeat what ye receive from Dr. Done his LXXIII. Sermon. and Dr. Sibs
his two Sermons on this Text.
others, That even great afflictions may not perplex a true Believers heart, I
shall endeavor to prove unto you from within the confines of the Text in hand.
I shall endeavor to clear it unto you, 1. Negatively, The Doctrine proved.
from the last closing of my Text. 2. Affirmatively: from the first entrance of
it.

Or, whether ye lay aside Paraphrases, and follow the various readings in a

says) the Church of England, etc.

If it were not so, I would have told you.

Whether ye examine the variantes Vide sis, Waltoni Biblia Polyglotta.
lectiones: whether ye follow the most obvious opinions of most Interpreters:
or whether ye keep strictly to the last and best copy and sense too. This one
phrase from the mouth of Jesus Christ our Lord, (this) I would have told you,
Is Law from Zion, Statute Law, stands a good, and a most undeniable proof.

Judge, therefore,

By the mouth of no one of all his servants in the Old Testament: in the New
Testament, neither by his servants, nor by himself, did the Lord Jesus, at any
time, either expressly, or implicitly say, He would have great afflictions
perplex believers hearts: Wherefore the constant silence of the Lord Christ,
calls out aloud; and giving unto this truth his free assent, most
undoubltedly assures every one among us, that, in as much as Jesus Christ our
Lord, requires no such Isa. 1.12
matter from our hands, No afflictions how great soever, may at all perplex a
believers heart. That's my first proof.

My second Proof is from verse the first, Affirmatively.
Let not; From verse first
etc.

Throughout this whole Context these Disciples of the Lord Jesus were, and were
to be under great and sore trials: All this while how does this captain of
their salvation lead them? How does their Lord and Master tutor them? Answ. He
tells them what they must account upon: he forewarneth them how that, In the
world they must Joh. 16.33
expect trouble; in the world they must 2 Timothy 1.8
partake of the afflictions of the Gospel; they must 2 Timothy 2.3
endure hardness; must 2 Timothy 2.12
suffer persecution; must Mat. 16.24 in quem locum vide sis Casparum Sibelium.
deny themselves: must Luke 9.23
take up their daily cross: But, may they at all disquiet? may they at all
perplex their minds? No, (says our blessed Savior) Fear Rev. 2.10

your heart be troubled.

My Brethren, of the clearness of any truths whatsoever, greater evidence has
no man then this, the (...), the precept, the command, the testimony, the
authority of (Him who is the wisdom and the truth; even of) Jesus Christ our
Lord. Wherefore, I beseech you, be your trials never so great, be the removal
of a near friend never so afflicting, yet, remember the words which the Lord
has spoken unto you, Let not your heart be troubled. While ye draw near Mat.
28.1
toward the Sepulcher, (I beseech you) take notice, that the John 20.1
stone is taken away: take notice that it is Mat. 28.2
rolled back by the good Angel in my Text: nay, cast an eye again, and having
Luke 24.2
found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher, behold how this Angel sits
upon that Mat. 28.2
stone. That is the next, viz. uponwhat ground, for what reason it is, that our
most compassionate Redeemer will not here allow no not any afflictions, how
great soever, to perplex his Disciples hearts.

The Reasons are sevenfold. From the whole Text.
But, ere ever I can bring forth my Reasons, I must remove one more stone at
which some few are (peradventure) willing to stumble.

Quest. Dub.
If I would have told you, stands a most undeniable prohibition; then, what
Statute Law have you for Bowing at the name of Jesus; for Bowing toward the
East, and (to instance in no more) for placing Tapers upon the Altar?

Answ. 1. Solut.
Law from Zion: which, therefore, because it nowhere declares these practices
contrary to Gods revealed will, 1 Cor. 6.12 See also, Cases of conscience about
things indifferent. 1662. by an indifferent hand.
allows them to be lawful.

Answ. 2. Thou can not say that they oppose Decency and Order: for, the most
learned Fathers of our Church, to whom it appertains Tit. 1.5 1 Cor. 14.40
11.34
to determine what does, and what does not make for Dececcy and Order, do, if
not enjoin, yet allow them, especially in Cathedrals.

Answ. 3 Thou can not say, We have Tit. 1.16
no such custom neither the Churches of God; for, our learned Fathers receive
these practices from Primitive Antiquity.

Answ. 4. Suppose Genu-flection first arose from a mis-interpreting of Phil.
2.10. Suppose bowing toward the East, proceeded from as gross a mistake of
Zech. 6.12. Suppose wax candles were originally placed upon the Lords Table in
imitation of Jewish, yea of heathenish Rites. This notwithstanding, these
customs being now received, may each of them have, at least, a blameless
continuance: for, First, what evil is it, if a Christian (if a sincere
Christian) bow Ephesians. 3.14

of illustration.
solemnly in words at length, to petition God for a blessing every time
throughout the day wherein thou occasionally drinkest, would probably not well
consist with the duties of thy Calling: thou art therefore the more to be
pardoned, nay, the more to be commended, if, (as a pledge of thy Thankfulness
throughout the whole following day) thou address thy self to the God of thy
blessings, at the first time every day wherein thou drinkest. Just so, sincere
Christians which bow at the name of Jesus, have an equal reverence for See
learned Mede upon Mat. 6.9. viz. his Sanctification of Gods name.
ever Attribute of God; but seeing they cannot so conveniently express this
reverence every time any divine Attribute of God is mentioned. Look what
reverence they would show unto every name of their gracious God, that they
signify so often as the holy Jesus is named. For the second: Where lies the
evil, if he, who Psalm 95.6
worshippeth before the Lord his Maker, bow in the most See Gr gory his Notes

boweth, thou would stoop, we should have no occasion of complaints: that

Thirdly, The Tapers prepared upon the Lords Table, tell us, that, we Gentiles

Answ. 6. To the pure these are not only blameless, but profitable. Does some
one bow toward the Altar? Look thou Eccles. 5.1
to thy feet when thou enterest the house of God. Do others bow at the name of
Jesus? At the name of Jesus depart 2 Timothy 2 19

silent, be Romans 12.18 Phil. 3.16
peaceable: Let not thy heart be troubled; these are no afflictions; if they
were, 1. Reason from the troubles themselves.
even great afflictions may not trouble thy heart, for these Reasons.

Reason 1. From the nature of the troubles: Let not you heart be troubled; for
your grievances are but 1 Pet. 1.7.4.12
trials. Afflictions arise Job 5.6
not out of the dust; they are 1 Chronicles. 29 14 Psalm. 39.9. Amos 3.6
ordered from above, and their use is 1 Cor. 3.21 Romans 8.28
heavenly. A heaviness, I 1 Pet. 1.6
grant, they have: and may, in that regard, be truly compared 1 Samuel 25.37
unto stones, so apt they are to Ibid.
astonish: but (lo) these stones, how great soever, are not Rev. 6.16
mountains to fall upon us, and Rev. 9.6
hide us from God: rather, they are marble stairs to Molleri praelect. in Psalm.
120.
lift us up by steps, and by degrees, while we approach the Heb. 13.10
Altar. So is it with our trials, as it is with our grave-stones: in the grave
there is Psalm. 6.5
no remembrance, upon the grave there Memoriae sacrum.
is: Double is the use of a tombstone; the corruption of the body, that it
Mat. 23.27
burieth, but the memory of the person, that it Pro. 10.7
keeps alive. Much after the same manner, these (great stones, these) heavy
afflictione, are cast upon us for two distinct purposes: they should Psalm.
119.67.71, 75 compared with 1 Cor. 9.27
keep under our corruptions, but they should Psalm. 119.107 Heb. 12.11 James 1.12
advance our duties too; they are brought not to flatten, but to 1 Pet. 5.10
quicken us: to our sins they are Romans 6.11 compared with Col. 3.5. Exodus 20.20
sepulchers; but unto our graces, they Romans 1634 Deuteronomy. 8.16 Genesis 22.18
are Monuments: if once they be sepulchers unto our duties, then this good
Angel in my Text 1 Cor. 10.13
rolleth them away; but, where they are Monuments of his 2 Cor. 12.9.
power in our graces, there he rests, there he [23] sits down upon them.

Reason 2. 2. Reason from the heart.
From the Jer. 4.19
seat of these troubles, the heart: Let not your heart be troubled, because a
heart. Surgeons in their Anatomies phrase such, and such a part a vessel: a
vessel for the brains, a vessel for the urine, for the blood, etc. Now he that
fashioned for himself all our limbs, while as yet there were none of them, he
uses this language too. Man's soul. body, and 1 These. 5.23
spirit, they are 1 Pet. 3.7 2 Cor 4.7
vessels in the hand of the Potter; this vessel he formed for such and such
uses, and for Romans 9.22 Prove. 23.26
none other intents or purposes whatsoever. I say, the Psalm. 2.9 1 These. 4.4
whole man, much more the Mat. 25.4
heart, is a vessel, a vessel appointed, like those of the Temple, for Pro 23.26
Gods service; wherefore the heart may not at all be taken up Luke 21.34
with cares: fill a heart with the Hos. 7.7
scalding waters of lust, or with the Phil. 3.19
muddy waters of an earthly mind, and what Hos. 4.11
room can there be in that heart, for either 1 John 3.3
purity, or Mat. 6.21
heavenliness? So, fill a heart with bitter waters of 2 Cor. 7.10
unreasonable grief, or with the unwholesome waters of Isa. 7.9
distrustful fears, and what room is there in that heart for the exercise of
faith? waters of affliction are of a Job 33.16 Isa. 44.33 Hos. 5.15
cooling, (...) 1.16
clensing, Psalm. 119.67
healing nature, and the heart should be a vessel prepared to receive them, as
Eccles. 7.3
such. Blessed are ye that Isa. 32.20
sow unto the spirit besides all waters; for the Spirit of God delights to
Pro 1.23
move upon these; and it concerns us that he finds a Ephesians. 4.30
quiet habitation. Let neither Jam. 1.4
impatiency, nor Mat. 8.26
distrust, nor Job 33.16 compared with Pro. 15.32 21.11
insensibleness, neither quench, nor grieve in the least any motions of so holy
a Spirit. If we would find our chastisements, chastisements of peaee, let not
the heart be troubled. That a second Reason; as the heart is the seat of the
vital spirits, so it should be the seat of spiritual graces too: It is (at lest
it should be) a vessel 2 Timothy 2.21 compared with Heb. 10.5
prepared for the Col. 2.12
operations of God: It should be filled not with carefulness, but with the Ephesians
5 18
Spirit.

Reason 3. 3 Reason from You.
From you (your heart) Let not the heart be troubled, because yours; because it
is as a vessel, so a Isa. 66.20
consecra^ed vessel. As for the wicked, the heart of the wicked Pro 10.20
is little worth, but the heart of a believer is a Jer. 31.20
dear heart unto her Bridegroom: The heart of a believer is a rich Mat. 25.4
Ephet. 3.19
cabinet, which holds vertu^s more graceful then gems, graces more precious
then jewels. The heart of a believer is a heart not taken up with the blood of
the fabulous Duck at Hales, no nor yet with the blood of bulls, or of goats,
but Heb. 10.22 1 Cor. 2.2 Gal. 2 20 Acts 20.28
with the blood of the sacrificed lamb; it carries within it self the blood of
the Lord Jesus. It is (I say) the mansion Vita est mansio animae in corpore,
rectius spiritus in anima, say I.
where the spirit of God dwells, and is it fit (think you?) that such a
Temple as this? such a Mercy-seat, as this, should be profaned with fears and
jealousies? 4. Reason from God.
with cares, and with destructive sorrows?

Reason 4. From God Almighty; Let not your heart be troubled, for ye believe in
God. The true Christian has a Exodus 34.6 2 Chro. 30.9 Neh 9.17 Isa. 30.18,
Psalm. 84.11 86.15 116.5.145.8
gracious God to believe in; an all-knowing, a merciful, an Genesis 17.1
all sufficient God to believe in, and shall he not endure affliction according
to the Romans 16.25 Ephesians. 1.19.3.28
power of God working mightily Col. 1.29.
in him? shall a believers heart stoop? should such a man as Nehemiah Nehe 6.11
flee? The Disciples were at the Mark 16 5
first affrighted with the sight of their good Angel; but what Mark 16 6
followed? There is (if ye mark it) there is a good Angel in this burning Exodus
3.4. Dent. 33.16
bush; Be not far off, O Lord, for trouble is Psalm. 22.11
hard at hand: Do thine afflictions make thee cry out? Be Psalm. 34.18.85.9 145.8
of good cheer: If once the child cries, the Nursing-mother runs. If
troubles be upon us, be ye sure, God Psalm. 46.1.
is a present help in those troubles. That a fourth.

Reason V. from me also: Reason 5. From Christ.
believe also in me: Let not your heart be troubled; for ye have the Act. 26.18.
Lord Jesus to believe in. True, no man can upon a well-grounded, and a
well-experienced 2 Timothy 1.12
Knowledge say that Jesus is 1 Cor. 12.3
the Lord, but Mat. 3.17. 1 Timothy 3.16. John 6.44.
by the Holy Ghost: nevertheless, where once the Holy Ghost enableth to say of
Christ, My Lord, and my God, there the soul Phil. 4.4.
rejoices in this Lord, as in the horn of her salvation. God reveals much of
his goodness in the 1 Chro. 29 14. Psalm. 57.2
works of his Common providence; thus the Roman Seneca, the Greek Aratus, and
other Gentiles saw that the Lord was good, and that his mercy endures for
ever; More of his goodness he reveals in as in Esa. 41.10.13, 14
his word of promise: five several times is that one promise repeated, I will
never leave thee, nor forsake thee. But the goodness of God is, Hos. 3.5
most of all, revealed in his own Joh. 1.18.14.9, 10, 11
Son; in him are 2 Cor. 1.20
all the promises Yea, and Amen; for, a Son (ye know) resembles his Father:
Hence it is, that Cited by Dr. Don. Sermon. on Joh. 10.10
Justin Martyr denies that ever any understood the true God, until first Heb.
1.3
Christ came: The truth is, In him are hid all St quis baberet librum ubi esset
tota sc eatia, non quaereret, nisi ut sciret llum librit; sic and nos non
oportet amplius quaerere n si Christum. Aquin. in Col. 2.3
the treasures of wisdom, and knowledge; In him is the love of God 1 John 4.9
manifested toward us: God is manifested 1 Timothy 3.16
in the flesh, as manifestly good: Wherefore, if God as a spirit, comfort us
in 2 Cor. 1.324.
all our tribulation, our consolation from Him, does 2 Cor. 1.5
much more abound by Christ. Christ Jesus is one Heb. 4.15
touched, indeed, with a sense of our infirmities! In all our afflictions, he
is Esa. 63.9
afflicted! Wherefore If the Joh. 8.36.
Son make us free from cares, then are we free indeed! for in him dwells both
the Joh. 17.21, 22 23
fellowship of our humane nature, and the Col. 2.9.
fulness of the Godhead too: (He) as he is Joh. 13.3
Lord of all things, so he is Mar. 1.23
one with us; he is Esa. 9.6 Romans 8.32.
ours; and if God be for us in our own nature, who Esa. 9.31
can be against us? We will Psa. 23 4
fear none evil; nay, we will take 2 Cor. 12.10
pleasure in infirmities, viz. God is found in the likeness of Phil. 2.7 Romans
8 3.
men; Christ does not trust us alone under the weight of our troubles, he
bears them for us, and with us.

Reason VI. from these Mansions: Reason 6. From these Mansions.
Therefore let not your heart be troubled, because in my Fathers house are many
Mansions: Should this Gal. 1.4 John 16.33
world last always, a 1 Cer. 15.19
sad world it were with us, but we shall be eased of our troubles Job 3.17
one day: alas, had not God made the night for man to rest in, as well as he
made the day for man to sweat in, the spirit before him might Isa 57.16
fail; but so Isa 54.7
God would have it; we shall soon Rev. 14.13
rest from our labors; Verily there Heb. 4.9
remains a Rest for the people of God: a rest? nay a reward, though not for,
yet according Mat. 16.27

need of patience, that after ye have done the Will of God, ye may receive the
promise: Cast not away therefore your confidence which Heb. 10.35
has so great a recompense of reward; Have an eye (I say) to the Mansions in
my Fathers house.

Reason 7. The last Reason, why even great afflictions cannot greatly trouble a
believers heart, 7. Reason from the End why these Mansions are here urged.
we spell from the ultimate end and cause for which these Mansions are here
thus brought to remembrance. As I, page 6. told you, that various troubles were
the occasions of these words; so page 4, 5, 6. I cleared unto you, that the
chief of all those troubles (if not fore-stalled) would be Christ's approaching
Ascension. I may say of this Text, as one A personis ad res ipsas transit, ut
majus sit pomdus argumenti. Imo etiam a Christo ad Patrem ascendit, ut doceat
in ipso etiam Christo, quatenus bomo est, non idclrco acquiescere, quia nos ad
Patrem usque subvehit; sicut ipse Christus ubique testatur se missum a Patre,
utsvinculo, cum ipso Deo una omnes devinciamur. Beza in 1 Cor. 3.22.
speaks upon a like Scripture: for, (mark it) to comfort his Disciples,
Christ does not urge, After Hos. 6.2
three days I will revive you; but, In my Fathers house are many Mansions.
These Disciples, so Luke 24.17, 21

over-joyed at his Resurrection, how over-grieved had they been at his
Ascension, had they been ignorant of the Mansions in my Fathers house? Jesus he
fore-knew, that as with his crucified body all their joys would be Mat. 26.56
buried, so with his raised body, all their former hopes would Mat. 28.8
revive: Did I 2 Kin. 4.28
desire a son of Isa. 9.6
my Lord? Did I not Luke 24.41
say, Do not deceive me? Less would be the trouble to their carnal, and Mat. 20.
worldly minds, would Christ crucified not rise again; then, if being risen; he
frustrate their secure, their over-joyed hopes, by a most Acts 1.9
unexpected Ascension! What is, if this be not, an astonishing diseomfort? But,
see (now) how the compassionate Jesus preventeth all this! Ere ever he thus
unexpectedly ascends; nay, before his resurrection, nay, before his
sufferings, (he keeps all well!) he here, before hand, timely informs, Were
there no Mansions in my Fathers house, ye would then sorrow most of all, when
ye should, here on earth, Act. 20.38
See my faoe no more; but, let not your heart Joh. 14.1
be troubled; though, whither I Joh. 13.33
ascend, ye cannot now come; I now Joh. 14.2, 3
go to prepare a place for you; to wit, that, whither I go, there ye 1 These.
4.17
may also be; and that, not for the space of your short, natural lives, but
Isa. 54.7, 8
for ever, and ever.

So, then, Against all our Miseries, a comfort it is, that, they are but
Afflictions; that, there is a God that over-mastereth, a Christ that sweetneth,
and Mansions which recompense even these afflictions: but, Christus ipse est
Joan. 4.10 do rum Dei primarium and maxim principale: caetera omnia sunt
taatum modo accessoria: Accessorium autem sequ tur priacipale. S. S.
the principal (and worthily the seventh) Reason why our hearts should not be
troubled here, is, that when (a little while hence) we shall exchange a world
of troubles for heavenly Mansions, we shall then ever, for ever, see this God
who now moderateth our troubles; we shall then ever, for ever, enjoy that Jesus
from whom we are now so loath to part; that Jesus who makes our afflictions his
Love Tokens! Oh my brethren! In my Fathers house are many Mansions! (The soul
of this Mrs. Rutter.
Saint knows it): I say, In my Fathers house are many Mansions; therefore,
let not, let not your heart be troubled; this God who 2 Cor. 1.4
comfort us in all our tribulations, this Redeemer who has done Rev. 5.9
and suffered so great things for us, will, in due time, welcome us to his
Fathers house; 1 These. 4.17
and so shall we ever! ever! ever! be with the Lord! When Psalm. 101.2
shall I come unto thee? I will walk in thy house with a perfect heart. O my

wait for the Lord: wait, I say, for the Lord: O ye Saints of his rejoice in
the Lord, Phil. 4.4 3. The Doctrine applied.
again, I say, rejoice: Hallelujah!

Ye have, I trust, (such is your patience) Mat. 13.51
understood all these things: ye have seen every afflicting stone Mar. 16.4
rolled away: ye have seen a world of Troubles Joh. 14.1, 2
swallowed up in Mansions of glory: ye have seen life in death, yea and life
Joh. 10.10
more abundant too: ye have seen the good Deuteronomy. 33.16
Angel in my Text, as it were, face to face: ye have seen his strong Isa. 41.21
reasons, his seven reasons, his seven spiritual Reasons; I had almost said his
seven Rev. 3.1
Spirits! Our hearts should be troubled, should we neglect Luke 9.44
Application.

O blessed Spirit, Application is thy Jer. 30.21

hearts too: Lord, the stone is rolled Joh. 11.39, 41, 43
away, raise up thy Lazarus; Give us life, give us life Joh. 10.10
more abundant.

AND, now, whether I look back upon the troubles past and gone; or whether I
look up unto the Mansions already prepared, let my tongue cleave unto the roof
of my mouth, and let my right Psalm. 137.6
hand forget her pen, if I prefer not my Sovereign above the head of my
comforts.

Therefore, though I forget not my Prove. 25.6
distance, my first Application shall be

The Lively Pourtraiture of CHARLES the Second, King of Great Britain France
and Ireland, etc.


TO THE SACRED MAJESTY Of our most GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN LORD, in all Causes, and
over all Persons as well Ecclesiastical, as Civil, our Supreme Governor,
CHARLES, second only to (that blessed Martyr, and glorious Saint) his royal
Father; of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, KING, Defender of the Faith; and
next unto God, and his Christ, the Prince of our Peace.
My Lord, O King,
LIve, like your Psalm. 112 6
Name, for ever: live Psalm. 61.6
and be
The same you are, (...) 2 Cor. 3.18
(...).
Great, as was your Psalm. 132.1
Affliction, and our 2 Samuel 15.30
woe:
Good, as late Psalm. 61.8 116.14 2 Chro. 32.25
Vows: Happy, as we Psalm. 144.15 Prove. 13.12
are now.
Thus, thus I Ezra 6.10
pray: But, let Applauses be,
Suppressed by others; and refused by me;
Not as undue; nor, that a zealous praise,
May too too much man's expectation raise:
Nor, that words match not, though, when all is done,
Never yet could pensil fully paint the Sun.
But (lo!) Believers (Sir) should we display
Your brighter beams, would (ravished) sin for joy:
Saw they your soul, they would slight heaven again,
And dote on earth, because on earth you reign.
I blame my fears! From Charles no evils spring;
They walk with God, who follow such a King:
Next unto Christ, this Prince of our Peace may
(If Subjects please) roll every stone away:
Next unto Christ, He does our life appear;
Good Subjects find life more abundant here!
That Truth, that Peace, which with 1 Timothy 2.2 Isa 49.23
His Throne consist,
Lifts us from Earth to Heaven, from Charles to Christ.
But, the Stairs at Whitehall are no winding stairs: Blessed be God, there is
no cause why I should borrow Verses feet to bring me to the Presence Chamber
(there): I need not, there, measure mine approaches, where, blessed be God, the

When I compare the troubles of these Disciples hearts with the Mansions that
are set before them; rather, To the Kings most Excellent Majesty.
when I compare the 30. of January with the 29. of May; and again the third of
September, with the 23. of April; Verily, if ever any Christian in the world
had encouragement to believe in God, and in the only Son of God, your Sacred
Majesty has: I trust, the same God who has delivered, 1 Cor. 1 10
will yet deliver: Nations could not get Dominion over your sacred person; I
trust Romans 6.14
sin shall not: The Lord has raised and removed the many burdens; but (I
trust) not the many Heb. 12.6, 7 Psalm. 94.12, 13 and 132.2, 5 compared with 1
Cot. 3.16.17
blessings of your Majesty's late sorows: Should not afflictions so great as
your Majesty's have been, be more and more sanctified unto your Royal soul;
alas, your heart might then be troubled indeed: Should you desist to believe in
God, who Psalm. 89.27
places your Majesty higher then the Kings of the earth, it might then be unto
you, and your Kingdoms a grief of heart: Should not your Princely soul believe
in that only Son of God, who Isa. 53.8 Heb. 2.10
suffered more for your Majesty, then your gracious Majesty suffered for your
lost people, this might also trouble your heart: Lastly, should your soul Isa.
53.3.
neglect so great salvation, should your soul despise the Mansions in your
heavenly Fathers house; then, then your heart would be utterly perplexed!
everlastingly troubled! and that beyond measure!

But, although King Hezekiah did not render according unto the 2 Chro. 32.25
benefit received, I trust your most excellent Majesty will. True, the more God
blesses his Job 1.10
servant Job, the more the Devil Job 1.11
seeks his ruin; No doubt, where the Lord has multiplied so unparalleld
favors as are heaped upon your dread Majesty, there the malice of Satan will
be very will, very full of 2 Cor. 2 11
stratagems: the Serpent, once enraged, will first 2 Cor. 12.17
buffet, then sting: Nevertheless, while your sacred Majesty figheth, not only
against 1 Pet. 2.11
flesh and blood, but, even against Ephesians. 6.12
Principalities and Powers; the same God who Psalm. 140.7
covered your royal head in the day of battle, the same God your sacred Majesty
has to believe in: The same Christ who delivered you from so 2 Cor. 1.10
great a death, the same Jesus your Majesty has to believe in; yea he who so
powerfully restored unto your birthright your Majesty's strangely revolted
Kingdoms, he can Psalm. 73.
guide you with his counsel, and afterward receive you to glory; He (I say) can
bring you to the Mansions in your Fathers house.

Once more: The bed of love wherein you rejoice over, our most Gracious Queen,
your royal Consort, as a Bridegroom Isa. 62.5
rejoices over his Bride; the love of your Jer. 2.2

heart; I mean, the May 29th.
day wherein the splendor of your glorious Majesty celebrated, therefore the
greatest, because, the happiest Triumph that ever yet was, by mortal Prince,
solemnized; of these, of all these, your prosperous Majesty has tasted. I most
humbly appeal now unto your dread Majesty's bosome-experience: What? yea what
are all these transitory joys, these fugitive felicities, if See what Mr.
Bolton in his four last things, p. 111. illustrateth upon 1 Cor. 2.9
compared unto the Mansions in your Fathers house?

When he that Psalm. 29.10
sits upon the floods, sent Psalm. 18.16
from above, took, and drew you out of many waters; when he that Psalm. 144.10
gives salvation unto Kings, commanded Lev. 25.21 1 Samuel 10.26

the heart of one man; when he that Psalm. 46.9
causes wars to cease, made your patience victorious; when at length your
meekness Mat. 5.5
captivated our afflictions; well might your Subjects shout Psalm. 47.1

God of peace made your Highness (what you still remain) more Romans 8.37

glory, though (I dare affirm) your glory exceeded Solomon's; I say, in the
height of your glory, your sacred Majesty's enlarged heart was never one half
so much transported, as, in the midst of his unsufferable perplexities, your
blessed Fathers most gracious soul was daily, then transported, when,

O Our most Gracious Queen, Queen KATHERINE,
In purity, in meekness, and in all other virtues, your SERENE MAJESTY
excels: Therefore, Kneeling down, and falling prostrate at your SACRED Feet,
I am bold to appeal to your ROYAL Experience, whether many of those Ladies,
whom your Majesty has seen at COURT, be not (in some measure) beside
themselves. Three Instances I give, why I suspect this: First, They procure
Habits, and Ornaments of too great a value for their Qualities; Next, (as
costly as they be) These Habits, these Ornaments, they That shining star,
Fulgentius, so overlooked the fashion of this world, that winter and summer he
ware the selfsame Clothes: for, said he, Christians should change, not their
apparel, but their hearts: but some vain Ladies would imitate not Fulgentius,
but Nero, who would never wear one raiment twice.
lavish upon their waiting-Gentlewomen; Thirdly, (how gay soever their
Trim-servants are) They themselves approach your Sacred Presence carelessly, and
rudely attired: MAY IT PLEASE YOUR MOST EXCELLENT MAJESTY, I do therefore
conclude, that their Habits and Ornaments are of too great value; because these
(if paid for) cost much more then what Revenues the Nobles, their Husbands
possess, can prudently expend: I complain, that, these costly vanities are
wasted upon their Attendants; because Flesh and Blood are (at best) but the
Souls hand-maidens: I likewise affirm, that they themselves abide carelessly and
rudely attired; because these Ladies, how unreasonable soever, are Genesis 2.7. 1
Cor. 15.45.
living souls; I say, living souls; although (alas, poor souls) some of them
are but sluttishly Me thinks A Jewel sparkling in (Pro. 11.22.) a bosom

apparelled, and as slenderly provided for! By them, no Mansions above, no
faith in God, no No garment like unto the garment of Salvation; nor is any
beauty like unto the beauty of Holiness.
Righteousness from Christ, inwardly and spiritually thirsted after! (Good
God!) Do these Court-Ladies ever dream of keeping Court in Heaven? Except,
they, at length imitate the good example of their most Gracious Queen, surely
their careless hearts cannot long continue untroubled.

A Reverend Father of our Church, gravely Bishop Morley, Sermon. at his Majesty's
Coronation, p. 55.
advises that, once a week, Princes should peruse the hundred and first Psalm:
Would some of our Ladies once a week read over the third Chapter of Esaias, it
would be both their benefit, and their wisdom. I profess for my share, I smell
no harm in your perfumes, and other your sweetnesses, if they be not too
luxurious: Rather then put any Countess to the blush, I will not once mention
foreign paints, or home-made Licitis perimus onns. Wherefore, let me advise
you, not to be too presumptuous upon the lawfulness of these; but consider
expedience, that so all may be done that God may be glorified, and your selves
more and more edified in Christ: if you look not to this, that which is lawful
in it self, will be found unlawful in you. Golden Topaz, p. 133.
Patches: I will make the best construction I can of naked breasts, provided
the Soul be not naked too. But, I fear lest, as Trajan was indulgent unto all
his people, saving only unto such of his Subjects as were Christians; so some
Ladies are tender of every part about them, excepting their Souls. Ladies, were
you once so wise, as to maintain, but not exceed your Quality, no Christians
under Heaven would have less cause to trouble their heart, then you your
selves would have. True; A woman and a glass are ever in danger; but a woman
and a Bible are ever in safety. It is said of that holy Martyr Polycarpus,
that, while his body was burning, his scorched flesh sent forth a smell
fragrant as Frankincense it self; just so, the exemplarinesse of that Lady who
is crucified unto the world, has a sweet winning influence upon all about Her;
while the comeliness of her body Gratiorest pulch-oveniens de corpore virtus.
adorneth the loveliness of her duties. Moreover, what the Christian Lady
reserveth from excess, that she improveth unto spiritual advantages: She upon

all opportunities, makes friends of unrighteous Mammon: She disperseth to
the poor, visits the sick, countenanceth the Gospel, and furnishes her
Closet rather with religious Books then with fancy-full Toys: Her very Sex
makes her tenderhearted; Hence it is, that she is more zealous in love of
the truth, in love toward Christians, and in love toward God, then holy persons
of a masculine judgment are. Now, as she buyeth the truth, so she redeemeth
the time: she wears her watch on purpose, because she would not confer more
hours upon that body which must be covered with worms, then upon that Soul
which is a companion for Angels; Chambering she loves, but, it is for
meditation-sake; Her Chamber is her Chapel; and herein she gets the start
of Students themselves; for, as she delights to improve her spare-hours, so
she has more hours to spart then any of any other profession whatsoever: she
is so meek, so obliging, so courteous, so commanding over all her affections,
that, if she were no Lady, you would call her one: It is not by chance, that,
while we super-scribe Lords Honorable, and Knights Right-Worshipfull, we write
their Ladies Virtuous; That person which walks worthy the Lord, leads a
life like a Lady, so naturally do a Ladies Virtues adorn the Gospel of Jesus
Christ: If afflictions be the trials of a sanctified Lady, her sorrows exercise
a godliness: if prosperity be her trial, she remains as good as prosperous:
Such is her moderation in worldly affairs, that you will not find she abounds
with Coin, otherwise then from her works of charity, of liberality, of
hospitality, of bounty, of piety, and of munificence: So full of leisure she
is, that you find her ever busied, but, it is in increasing a spiritual
knowledge, in conversing with Believers, in instructing Heir Families, and (to
speak at once) in rejoicing in Heir God: Multitudes of Believers was St. Jerome
thoroughly acquainted with, but among all his Acquaintance, he found no
Christians so nearly resemble the Saints in heaven, as Elect Ladies did: In the
holy Gospels, more Women then Men are noted for ministering of their substance
unto the Lord; And, if the wisest of Kings, King Lemuel, do, at the last,
undertake to recommend a virtuous woman, he runs on in her praises unto the
end of the Chapter, I had almost said, unto the end of the Book. I conclude
then, that, wise Ladies (like the wise Virgins) therefore keep their hearts
from needless troubles, that they may take oil in their Lamps; They resort so
often to their Fathers house, that they are perfect Courtiers; for, they have
their conversation in Heaven; they do with so much perseverance believe in God,
that they are ever clothed (if I may so speak) with inherent Humility, and
imputed Righteousness. Lastly, while they study mu^^ to please most THE man

against another of Satan's stratagems; Be not, says he, Romans 12.2.
be not conformed unto this world: Beloved, whether our life past has been, or
has not been, consumed in a state of unbelief, this Exhortation of St. Paul's
remains very pertinent and seasonable.

First, If from the womb Esaias 48.8
unto our infancy; if from the days of our Esaias 65.20
infancy unto the years of our youth; if from our youth up unto present
maturity, we have drank in iniquity, as if it Job 15.16
were wholesome water; now that we are of a ripe understanding, it does so much
the more Jer. 13.27
concern us, to provide for the health of our Souls: after, so long, so many
provocations, we are (I say) the more nearly concerned, now, at length 1 Pet. 4
2, 3
to believe in God, and to believe in Christ. It is the trouble of our hearts,
that we have parted from the innocence Matthew. 18.3, 4
of our Childhood; It is the grief of our minds, that we have not improved Pro.
22.6
our education; and, can we fool away our interest in the world too? When we
were Children, we did not 1 Cor. 13.11
put away childishness; while we were youthful, we Psalm. 25.7
served diverse lusts; Now that carnal pleasures have been the trouble of our
hearts, shall earthly cares be our vexations too? we ought to sacrifice our
bodies unto the Father of Romans 2.1
Heaven; and dare we sacrifice our hearts unto the God 2 Cor. 4.4
of this world?

On the other side: If (through mercy) our Childhood has been Ephesians. 6.4
nurtured in the fear of the Lord; or, if God gave us the grace to remember
Eccl. 12.1
our Creator in the days of our youth; how is it that we forget him now? What
iniquity Jer. 2.5
have we found in our God, that we should cast him off now in the midst Psalm
102.4
of our age, in the very Psalm 29.5
best of our estate? In our Infancy, we entered into a Covenant with our God; we
were baptismally engrafted into Christ; in our youth, we blossomed; now that we
are in our Autumn, shall all the fruits of our Faith fall to the ground? shall
we, like the Mat. 19.20
cursed fig tree, fail our Makers expectation.

bread; had we the wit to trust 1 Pet. 4 19
an all-sufficient Creator: if it be better for us to be rich Pro. 30.8

needs Phil. 4.6
none of our shifts, none of our carkings, nor indirect means of ours, to make
us wealthy, great or honorable: the way to Prove. 10.22 1 Cor. 3.22

this world 1 John 2.15
with his first love (if he love it otherwise then for He loves God too

our experience, and understandings, James 4.4
commit so high an affront against the great God? Dare we prefer Mat. 6.31
our vain shifts before his daily Providence? our worldly Genesis 17.1
wisdom before his spiritual instructions? Dare we love the 1 John 2.16
things of this world, before the mansions in our Fathers House? Nay, would any
of us, if we might, occasion the King of Sodom to say Genesis 4.23
I have made Abraham rich? or would we accept of plenty Pro. 15.16 16.18
peace, pleasure, or honor from any hand, but Gods? Commendable Jam. 4.4

Beloved, mine Exhortation is, that this Gal. 1.4
present evil world may not persuade us out of our Christian names: By these,
we (in ordinary converse) call our Children: Why? Answ. Because they had need
be often minded of their Christendom, and of their vow in Baptism. Striplings,
we likewise call by their Christian names, so subject are they to an
inconstancy: But, he that is of full age, he that is stled, and stayed, we
repute him so much a Christian, that ordinarily we term him Good Man, Master,

that he rendered his Infancy, his youth, and his manly stature exquisitely
amiable and pleasant; may what was attributed unto his limbs, be due unto the
virtues of a believers soul; yet, we shall not conclude such a one perfect,
until he has also crowned his gray hairs with spiritual wisdom: Alas, so does
time Psalm 144.4

God; and, if we are alive unto God, 2 Pet. 1.8

hand: we design to make our calling and election sure; but, what we design,
that we delay. Now, the happiness of the aged convert, is, that although other
Christians (most unwarrantably) run the hazard of delays, He (being so aged)
dares not: He wisely considers, that

every house lives a Theif, woe unto that house wherein 2 Cor. 7.1 13.5
is no chideing; for, if Christ be out of doors, there John 15.5
is no body at home; and, if Romans 8.9
no body be at home, the house is dead.

Fourthly, The James 1.14, 15 Heb. 12.1 Ephesians. 4.27 Romans 12.9 Esa. 59.5 Cant. 2.15
death of a young wolf, never comes too soon: as Heresy, so any other sin
whatsoever, is better suppressed at the first, then it is afterward removed:
Every wickedness is at strife Pro. 15.26
with God; the beginning hereof is as Pro. 17.14
when one lets out water; it is best left off, before it be meddled with: The
resolved mind has Luke 17.32 Exodus 16.3

shaken off, the sooner, the better: for the offender never pardons Psalm. 51.3

I have; for, I am deprived of all means of avenging my self, for that great

Fathers, he that has listed himself under the banner of Jesus Christ, has

no such occasions of complaint: we have indeed received a mortal overthrow in
the fall of Adam; great is the misery, great is the reproach, many are the
troubles which that old Serpent has maliciously brought upon us all: But, our
comfort is, that, 1 John 4 4.2.13, 14 5.4, 5
as our shame dies not, so neither dies our Adversary the Devil: No: He is so
full of his stratagems, so good at tempting, that he daily appears in his
likeness, daily gives us fresh opportunities of 1 Pet. 5.9 James 4.7
avenging our selves upon his pride; while through Christ who Phil. 4.11
strengthens us, we daily Ephesians 6.13
withstand him, James 4.7

him to flight: He who resists steadfast in the faith, shall see his desire
upon his enemy. By this we know that God favors us, because our enemy does

Seventhly, The wise Virgin will not, then Mat. 25.4

ostentation: He furnishes his heart Psalm. 119 11

a love unfeined: when chill age Eccles: 12 1

Eighthly, He who Deuteronomy. 28.66 Esa. 33 18.

the more he prepares for rocks: If at any time Nature begins to shrink,

let one main trouble of our hearts be, not so much the evil of our doings, as
the evil of our hearts. Beloved, If Jeroboam the son of Nebat cease 1 Kings

our greatest strength against that original pollution which staineth our
purest actions, while we slay the Amalekites, we preserve Agag alive: When the
holy Spirit has once rolled aside the stone of unbelief, the more abundant our
life of Faith is, the more we grieve under the weight of that stone; David was
ashamed that he had committed Adultery; the murder of Vriah wounded his very
heart-blood; but, that which stuck more close unto him (then even these crying
sins) was, that he was shapen in iniquity, and Psalm 51.5

it be, thy heart mourns, and bleedeth, for that it cannot (not not half

hate every false way, but, thou do hate thy false heart more, viz. for
being so unwilling to have any evil way whatsoever; So often as sin brancheth
out (and that isperpetually) thou should strike at the root, I mean, at the
original sin which Romans 7.18, 20
dwells in thee; If the world is crucified to thee, Gal. 6.14
thou would be crucified to the world (that is) if thou could. Thy stiff

this hour keep thee wretched and low in thine own eyes: Let not sin reign Romans
6.12
in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof; This
obedience is the outward actings of sin: these lusts are the inward breathings
of sin; the sin it self which is so forward to reign, is not some one

Law in thy members, that corrupt bent of thy soul and body, and spirit, which
makes Romans 7.21, 25
thee so subject to revolt from God, and his Christ: Now, if we would not have
this sin Romans 6.12, 14
reign in our mortal bodies, we Pro. 13.5 Job 42.6 Psalm 32.5.51.3.73.22. Ezekiel.
16.61, 63

heart is therefore troubled, because it is not Nahum 2.7 Psalm 31.10 Romans 7.15,

troubled enough: The more the Holy Spirit delivers it from the power of
darkness, the more darkness it Psalm 19.12 25.4.26.2.31.3.139.2, 3, 4, 23, 24
complains of: The more he beats down Satan, the more jealous we 2 Cor. 2.11
are of Satan's stratagems: Heathen Moralists could lop off the Romans 2.14
branches of sin; but, we Christians must Jer. 3.10 Col. 3.15 Romans 8.1.
lay the axe to the root of the Tree; sin reigned in their hearts, the Spirit
of God must rule in ours: We then bethink our selves of the Mansions in our
Fathers House, when we begin to believe in Christ: we then begin to believe in
Christ, when we are turned Acts 26.18
from the power of Satan unto God; we are then turned from the power of Satan
unto God, when the sinfulness of our corrupt mind, is John 14.1, 2. Romans 8,

so the trouble of our heart, that it quickneth us to believe in God through
Jesus Christ our Lord. To conclude: If the Twins do not struggle in the womb,
it is a manifest Symptom of miscarriage: for, the Gal. 5.17 Romans 7.8, 14, 17,

are contrary the one to the other, so that you cannot do the things that ye
would: But if ye Romans 8.15
allow not of your evils; if your sin does not Romans 6.12.
get dominion over you; if you be Romans 8.1, 13, 14

walk after the Spirit; if your 2 Cor. 4.16

Gospel-Professours universally, we have long since perceived; We have heard
him speak Page 55
privatively, to None of you Unbelievers: Page 109
positively, to All of you that believe. I shall now proceed, from the persons
spoken unto, to the matter spoken of; and that (I Page 2. 14
told you) was matter of Reproof, matter of Instruction, and matter of Comfort.
And I beseech you Brethren, Heb. 13.22
suffer a word of Exhortation: lest the Stone rolled away tumble back upon us
again; let us, let us pass, from the Duty here enjoined, unto the means here
recommended; let us (to say no more) make application of our Text. Beloved,
Hitherto, we have heard a Voice Matthew. 3.3
crying in the Wilderness: we now (more fully) prepare the way of the Lord;
Hitherto, we have examined to whom we would apply this Gospel; we now enquire
what this Gospel is which we would apply; Hitherto, we have beheld the Mar. 16.4
Stone rolled away: now rolleth Esaias 48.18
in upon us Life more abundant: namely, First, The Pro. 15.21.6.23.
Life of Reproof; Next, The Pro. 10.17.16.22.
Life of Instruction; Thirdly, The Pro. 3.18, 22
Life of Consolation.


Lastly (that which Psalm 145.1, 2, 3: 7 146.2.147.1.
crowns all our Consolations, to wit,) a Thankful Life. A Life thankful,
while we overcome the troubles of the heart! thankful, while we exercise Faith
in God through Jesus Christ our Lord! thankful, while we expect the Mansions
in my Fathers House! Uses. 1 Of Reproof.


When you read how the Angels of the Lord Mar. 28.2
came, and rolled back the Stone from the door of the Sepulcher, you will not
imagine that this Augel heaved it, lifted it, and shouldered it, as men
shouldered away that other stone from John 11.38, 39, 41
the Grave of Lazarus: No, ( who art thou Zec 1.4.7
O great Mountain which stand before Zerubbable?) The very presence of an
Angel of the Lord caused Mat. 28.2 (...), a great shaking, viz. of that part
where the Grave was. Hammoad, Annot, on Matthew. 27.51
the Earth to quake; now, beyond all peradventure, the earth so quaked, that
the stone unsettled, shook, joggled, tottered, and could not choose but roll;
yea Mar. 16.4
the more weighty it was, the more naturally it rolled backward: So here, Do
not think that this Good Angel in my Text rolleth away your troubles from your
minds by any forced restraint, or interposed violence: (No;) Your gracious Lord
does here move, not so much your troubles, as Esaias 61.1 Acts 16.14, 26, 18
your hearts: I say, In this Text of mine, the John 6.63 Romans 8.11
blessed Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ kindly removes troubles from these
Disciples hearts by 1 John 5.4
the bringing in of Faith; as calmely increases their Faith, by Luke 24 45
enlightening their understandings; and again, as naturally enlighteneth their
understandings by Pro. 6, 23
beginning his Instructions with a mild Reproof, Let not your heart be
troubled: A better Example I cannot follow, then John 13.15
the Example of Jesus Christ; He began with reproves, and so shall I; may the
same blessed spirit which inspired his, sanctify mine.

I foresee that what stones I would remove from others, may Pro. 26.27

marry they care not whom: These 1 Samuel 2.17 Mal. 1.6. Romans 2.24. 1 Timothy 6.1.

are the very reproach of a Gospel-Ministery; the scum, the poison of the
Clergy! Errors in marriage, like those in War, are as remediless, as
pernicious; and shall a Minister of Jesus Christ countenance such errors?
Where inordiate affections make the match, there riot, disobedience, fraud, and
such like sins are iojned together; and is this a marriage for a Minister to
celebrate? Is it a light matter to undermine, betray, and ruin whole families,
and this too, by virtue of a trust in our holy function reposed? So many of us
as do, in this sort, profane our holy orders, deservedly incur our Lord
Bishops, and may justly expect our Lord Gods displeasure! We call such weddings
stolen weddings; Trust me, neither of the married couple is so very a Theif, as
is the Parson who marries them; he sins against his own soul, his crime is
capital. Brethren, let every Minister who names the name of Christ, roll away
this stone from the door of his tabernacle: Never hereafter Where factum valet
threatens a ruin of the persons, there, fieri non debet must be a Rule to the
Minister.
let such gross scandals be the trouble of any Christians heart.

honoring God with their heart, that, they are not at the pains to honor him

wear the Act for Uniformity as a cloak for sloth: These so slubber over the
Liturgy, as if they were hired to 1 Samuel 2.17
make it a Reproach. Brethren, this is not to exercise 1 Timothy 4.7
our selves in godliness; this is not to Heb. 11.39 10.22.
exercise faith; this is not to believe either in God, or in Christ. Who so
believes in that God before Esaias 61.6 1 Samuel 2.11
whom he ministers, will Romans 12 7
be zealous in the whole service: He will distinctly, deliberately, and
solemnly with such due accents, and cadencies read the most holy Scriptures,
that his very voice shall Neh. 8.8
be an interpreter of what he pronounces: He will 1 Pet. 4.11
give the Hearers to understand, that, he is now divulging the Oracles of his
God: He will utter threats, as one Amos 8.8 2 Cor. 5 11
well knowing the terror of the Lord: He will deliver Deuteronomy. 4.6
[ Precepts, as the Wisdom, and] Commandments, as the great Hos. 8.12
things of Gods righteous Law: He will insinuate 2 Cor. 7.1
promises, as who would not only Gal. 1 10
persuade, but charm Psalm 58.5
his people: The now established Pro. 15.4 1 Timothy 6.3 2 Timothy 1.13
set-Forms help his devout Soul to pray more fervently, and to give thanks with
Rejoycings truly spiritual: To wit, while both matter and phrase, are already
prepared to his eye, his heart seeks, not 1 Cor. 14 15
to find out acceptable words, but acceptable desires; his heart is fixed: his
heart meditateth, not matter, but God: as his Heavenly Father Mat. 6.32
knows what things he has need of, yea, and knows Psalm 139.2
his thoughts too long before; so, he himself (long before) knows what words
to Hos. 14.2
take with him. While he makes his request known Phil. 4 6
unto his God; no 1 Pet. 4 7
inadvertency surprizeth his Petitions: No Jam. 1.6
hallucinations stumble his faith: No hesitation, 1 Cor. 14.15
no lapsus linguae, no Mat. 6: 7
tautology mangleth his sacrifice. A Form of wholesome 2 Timothy 1.13
words he is sure of; wherefore, he is now ( in the power 1 Cor. 2.4
of the Spirit) making use of those wholesome and acceptable words, to wrestle
with that God, who is a God that Psalm 65.2
hears our prayers, and accepts Genesis 19.21
our persons: He ever so frames Hos. 5.4
his doings, as, to seek the Lord, the gracious Lord, while Esa. 55.6
he may be found: He is therefore, an 1 Timothy 4.12
example unto Believers: because, while he ministers Romans 12.7
unto the most High, the most High he serves with all Deuteronomy. 10.12
his might, and with all his strength: He has purposed Psalm. 17.3
that his mouth shall not transgress; His prayer goes not out of Psalm.17.1.
feigned lips: yea, his Soul does Luke 1.46 47
magnify the Lord, and his Spirit rejoices in God his Savior: in a word, He
therefore believes in God, because he believes in Jesus Christ the Righteous.

Thirdly, The many Mansions in my Fathers House silence our dissenting
Brethren. For want of comformit
Reverend and Beloved, Many of us deal by Church Government as the Jews did by
the Mat. 28.18 Ephesians. 1.22
Church Governor; They Matt. 2.4 John 1.19 4.29.
accounted much upon the coming of their Messiah; but, when he came, they Matt.

would not receive him: just so, diverse among us have wished, and longed, and
waited for a Church Psalm. 63 2
Discipline: but, now that it is religiously Psalm. 19.17. Acts 16.4
established, we slight it; During late Convulsion-fits, our stomachs have
grown so sickly, that we would 2 Timothy 4.3
now be fed with fancies, and niceties; wholesome 1 Timothy 6.3
food will not down with our Pallats: Our Soul does Number. 21.5
loath this Manna, we are for Number. 11.32.
Quails (We:) Take with you words, says Hes. 14.2

the same Rule; let there be no divisions 1 Cor. 1.10.

same judgment, says ibid.
the blessed Spirit: Nay, (say some of us) let us have a toleration of several
1 Cor. 3.3
opinions, and practices: Reverend and Beloved, Could we Mat. 23.23
swallow down Engagements, and Covenants, and do we Mat. 23.24.
scruple at subscriptions? Could we be flexible Isa. 9.16 Hos. 5.11
at every Will Worship of Olivers, and can we not stoop a little to an Romans
13.1.2
Act of Parliament? When Schisms, Heresies, and Rebellions prevailed, we were
then leading Divines; now that Unity, Truth, and Loyalty prevail, can we not
Heb. 12.4 Romans 12.18
bear with some few Ceremonies, 1 Cor. 14.22
Ceremonies which we our selves have ere now 1 Cor. 11.6.
embraced? Again, Were we so forward Esaias 28.15
in the days of our Oppressors, and now that we Judge. 17.6 Hos. 3.4 10.3.
have a King among us, have we never Exodus 22.28

Decency, Order, and Unity of the Spirit greater offenses, then were Judge. 5.16
divisions, 1 Timothy 6 10
errors, Tit. 1.16
disobedience, and Judge. 11
gain-sayings? Reverend, and Beloved, Does the zeal of Gods House eat us up?
and can we Tit. 1.15
forsake the substance for a shadow? Is a dis-rellish of things (in themselves)
indifferent, warrant enough to Luk 9.62
with hold any of our hands from the plough? Have we solemnly undertaken to
John 21.15, 16, 17,
feed the lambs, to feed the sheep, to feed our flocks, and can we with a
better conscience run John 10.13
away from them, then subject our selves unto the higher Powers? Are we so
wedded to our own Romans 12.16
private judgments, that we forget the 1 Cor. 1.10 Phil. 3.16
injunctions of the Holy Ghost? Are not the many Mansions in our Fathers House,
large enough to hold us all 1 Cor. 11 20
in one place? Shall our populous Congregations say 1 Cor. 14.19.
Amen unto our unstudied, and extemporary petitions, and cannot we our selves
assent unto the premeditated, and Orthodox 1 Cor. 26.33
prayers of our devout, and judicious Church? Were set- Psalms allowed, yea As
appears by the several Titl s of diverse Psalms.
enjoined in the Temple-worship, and are set-Forms grown Luke 11.1.2
of late days, contrary unto a Gospel Worship? Does a Chapter in the Old, or
New Testament cease to be the Word of God, because it is Phil. 3.16 1 Cor. 1.10
not, day by day, of our own choosing? Nay, are the Mat. 28.20 1 Cor. 12.28
helps, the Governments which Jesus Christ Ephesians. 4.12.
vouchsafes unto his Church mere Ciphers? Are their Acts 16.4
decrees of no value? Must whatsoever is enjoined by Authority of the Church
be, because enjoined, 2 Pet. 2.10
an offense unto us? Is this to Pro. 17.14.
leave off contention before it be meddled with? Is this, not to Pro. 4.21.
meddle with them that are given to change? Is this to Mat. 16.24
deny our selves? to condescend Romans 12.16.
to men of low estate? to be lowly Psalm 131.1, 2
in our own eyes? to esteem of others Romans 12.3.13.
better then of our selves? to become all things 1 Cor. 9.22
unto all men? to give none offense, neither 1 Cor. 10.32.33.
to Jew, nor to Gentile, nor to the Churches of God? Is this to Acts 18.18
shave the head in Cenchrea? to circumcise the son of a Acts 16.3.
Greek in the Jewish quarters? Is this to abstain Acts 15.29.
from blood, from things strangled, from things sacrificed to Idols purposely
not to offend the weak? Is this to Phil. 1.18
rejoice in Christ preached any how? Is this 1 Cor 9.19
to advance the Church of God by all means possible? Is this, If she Cant. 8.9
be a wall, to build upon her a Palace of silver? if she be a door, to enclose
her with boards of Cedar? Who are these that Esaias 60.8
flee as a cloud, and as the Doves unto the Windows? Brethren, will it not 1 Timothy 4.16 5.14.
give occasion unto the Adversary to blasphem, if we do not Genesis 8.9
open the window of the Ark, and take in these Doves with the Gal 2.9
right hand of fellowship? Reverend, and Beloved, Let us not therefore pick
quarrels at Jesus Christ's garment, because it is Joh 19 23
seamlesse: Let us not begin Genesis 45.24
to fall out by the way, because that Joseph has Genesis 45.22.
given to all of us change of Raiment: Let us Pro. 23.23
buy the truth with a requisite obedience, and not sell it for Gal. 5.26
a popular ostentation: Love would hide Prove. 10.12
a multitude of sins, would 1 Cor. 13.7
bear all things, would believe all things, would hope all things, could we but
strive Ephesians. 4.3
once to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. O my Brethren,
since dissentions render us unserviceable unto the Churches of God; let not the
Jesuit fool Mat. 10.16 1 Cor. 9.19
us into dissentions: Since our Lords Harvest still Mat. 9.37
continues great, let us still continue 1 Cor. 15. ult.
Laborers, although later harvest-men are preferred before us: If we cannot
rule as Fathers, yet let us Col. 4.11
unite, as fellowworkers: Let us distinguish between obstinacy and
circumspection; between conscience and debate: between 1 Cor. 14.32
sullen silence, and edifying Ephesians. 4.16
of Christ's Church in love. If otherwise, It will be no Luke 16.2 Heb. 13.17
sufficient answer at the great and last Day, (when Mat. 10.36
the thoughts of all hearts shall be revealed) that we might 1 Cor. 7.24
have abode in our holy Galling, might have 1 Cor. 9.16.22
won many of those Souls for whom Act. 20.28
Christ dyed, could have preached the Gospel, could have traded Mat. 25.28
with our ten Talents, but, we were so high-minded that we therefore would not,
because James 3.16
we might not have (forsooth) our own wills and ways: Would we confess a
truth, the Sea Mr. Calamy, upon this subject, and Percz Uzzi, upon that Sermon
of Mr. Calamies.
glory is not departed from Israel, but we our selves are departed from the
glory: The garment Isa. 61.10
of Salvation is the same now which formerly it was: but unthankful, we pick
quarrels about the fringe; if we would but touch the hem Mat. 9.21
of our Saviors garment, we might all of us be healed: We have, I say, the
Ephesians. 4.4, 5, 6
same Lord still, but the strife is Luke 22.24
who among us shall be uppermost. I had rather be Psalm 84.10
a Doorkeeper in the Tabernacles of my God, then Romans 14.15
shut any of the Mansions in my Fathers House from any of the Disciples of
Jesus Christ. The Lord roll away from us his Ministers every stone of Offense;
the Lord preserve, the Lord continue, by us his Ministers, abundance of life in
the peace of his Gospel.

this world, that ye allow Luke 8.14 1 Timothy 6.17
nor leisure unto your neglected souls, to effectually believe in God the

judge of all men, and in Jesus Christ your only 1 John 2.1
Mediator and Advocate. The Trumpet sounds 1 Cor. 15.25 2 Cor. 5.10.
in your ears.

Thirdly, words of my Text speak Reproof unto some Practitioners of Physic;
Unto some Physicians.
not for studying Galen, or Hippocrates, but for not studying the Word of Life.
viz.

First, The house of Eccl. 7.2
mourning reads frequent Divinity-Lectures, especially against the flesh, and
the world: Let Religio medici flatter her self how she pleases; He is not far
from an Atheist, who, while Eccl. 7.4.
he administreth Cordials unto dying bodies, receives no experience for living
Souls.

Secondly, Although Theology be indeed no Col. 3.16.
part of the Physicians profession, yet it is a very requisite accomplishment:
Be the other Ingredients, what Physic shall see cause to direct; godliness 1 Timothy 4.8
should be ever be one of the prescriptions: True, it is not the Physicians
errand to ease the heart from trouble, but it Heb 10.24
lies in his way (though:) He has a constant opportunity to show some
spiritual kindness unto persons sick at the very heart; and, having Gal 9.10.
opportunity, he should do as 1 Samuel 10.
occasion shall serve; he should lead his Patient, from the chastisement Heb.
12.11
of the body, unto the comforts of the soul.

Thirdly, It is not the Practitioner of Physic, but the great God who
disposes of 1 Chronicles. 16.12
King Asa: the sick bed is a Rev. 2.22
summons to Repentance; We are chastened of the 1 Cor, 11.32
Lord, that we may not dye in our sins; the Herb can bring no healing Virtue
which she does not first Mat. 4.4
borrow from her Creator; in short, God is professedly the God both of our
Psalm 103 3
health, and of 1 Samuel 2.6
our life; every of which particulars sufficiently convince us, that the
speediest mean to cure the body is to 1 Samuel 41.4. Matthew. 9 5.
begin with the Soul; so speedy, so effectual a course is this, that every one
who is a good practitioner in Physic, either is or should be like Saint Luke
Col. 4.14
not only a Physician, but an Evangelist.

To conclude, By many Patients, the Physician 2 Chronicles. 16.12
is sooner thought off then the Parson; yea, full often, the Doctor of physic
is admitted, while the Doctor of Divinity Jam. 5.14
is shut out. Consider now, a word spoken in season, Prove. 15.23
how good is it? Pity, pity it is, that, the heart of him who gaspeth for life,
should Psalm 73.26
be almost spent through want of Balm from Gilead: If the Minister cannot be,
may not be, or is not in presence, care Jam. 5.15
must nevertheless be timely had, that, for him, who is just now giving up the
ghost, prayer and intercession be tendered unto the Father of Spirits. Alas, no
Medicines Psalm 94.19 116.8.119.81.42.1, 2, 84.1.62.5.
are healing unto a Soul thus troubled: There is no trusting unto Physic at
any time; a God, a Jesus Christ may, yea must be trusted in: The merit of the
person 1 John 2.1
here speaking in my Text, drank off blood-warm, transcendeth all other
Receipts that can possibly be thought upon: Where the Physician fears God,
there Genesis 21.22 39.5. Psalm 1.3
God gives a blessing for the Physicians sake. Be it that the death of the
Patient Job 7.1 Psalm 31.15
seem to upbraid, if not a want of skill, yet a want of success in the Artist;
yet, O Death 1 Cor. 15.55
where is thy sting? the good Physician finds no reason at all why he should
absent himself from his deceasing Patient; he rather abides, and conducteth
the departing soul toward the many Mansions in my Fathers House.

Fourthly, Mansions in my Fathers House, a faith in God, Unto Tradesmen, and
such as buy and sell
yea and these troubles of heart, do reprove innumerable followers, not of
Christ, but of the world, who most contentedly exchange godliness for gain. In
Queen Mary's days, so strong had nature made Sark-Island, that Sir Walter
Raleighs History of the World, lib. 4. cap. 2. sect. 18.
thirty Frenchmen could maintain it against all the Flemings in the world: This
stratagem was used; Near unto the Isle, with one ship of a small burden
anchoreth a Netherlander, pretends the death of a Merchant in that Vessel,
beseeches the thirty Frenchmen, that the dead body of their Merchant might be
buried in hallowed ground, namely, in Sark-Chappel; unto a Request so
charitable the secure Frenchmen yield; The Flemings bring into the Isle a
Coffin filled, not with a dead body, but with murdering Harquebusses; then,
entering the Chapel, they shut the door upon themselves, take their Weapons
from out of the Coffin, slay every Frenchman in Sark, and immediately possess
themselves of the whole Island: Many, many a covetous Tradesman receives just
such Prove. 1.19 5.22.11.1.22.23.23.4.13.11. Exck. 7.13
a Coffin into his shop: from out of a graceless good will unto himself, he
welcometh false measures, false weights, false wares, false accounts with all
the security that may be: But, note the event: Wherewith this Shopkeeper
deceives his Customers, therewith Acts 5.3
the Devil 1 Timothy 3.6, 7
surprizeth this Shopkeeper; takes 2 Timothy 2.26
possession of his captived heart, and 1 Pet. 5.8
slays his deluded soul. Alas, ill fares the owner, whose shop is the Devils

that is fraudulent: And yet (mercy, God!) What do most of our Markets, and
Faires signify, other then 1 These 4.6 Hos. 4.2

who vote themselves Tit. 1.16
Christians, as very liars as John 8.44
himself? Judas is not the Heb. 13.5 2 Pet. 2.3

face, that ye doom Amos 9.10 Prove. 12.3

shall you be at peace with your own consciences; then shall you find, that
Godliness has the 1 Timothy 4.8
promise of this life; then shall this Gospel Esaias 26.3
say unto you, Let not your heart be troubled.

Fifthly: This, Let not, Of all Christistians.
which at any time Romans 8.1 2 Cor. 1.12
omitteth any Duty; every person who, in performing any Duty, makes not Psalm
52.7

force a Camels Mat. 19.24
back through the eye of a Needle, as remove Gal 6.1
offenses merely by finding fault; The end of rebuke, is 2 Timothy 4.2 Ezekiel. 3.26
to correct: I pass therefore from these Joh. 14.1
troubles of heart, unto a faith in the living God; I proceed, from what our
Savior (here) prohibiteth, unto what he (next) enjoyneth: Dearly beloved, you
will, now at the last, escape reproofs, if, Pro. 10.17 15.31.12.1.
without further troubles of heart, you receive instruction.

I told you, Matter of instruction.
from the Page 2.
beginning, that this seasonable Precept, Believe in God, believe also in me,
was clothed with Evangelical instructions; It is so: Take the words (2)
absolutely, and they are our instruction; they teach us, that, believe in God,
believe in Christ, we must: but, consider them as opposed against the
distractions of the Disciples hearts, you will then learn, that This 1 John 5.4
is the victory which overcomes all our troubles, even our faith.

How great a comfort faith is against the greatest troubles of mind, will
appear from the Sea page 6
various occasions of this Text. Occasion.


One was Luke 22.24
ambition disappointed: The hearts of these Disciples hab been troubled with
worldly interests: They had Luke 24.21 Acts 1.6.
dreamed hitherto, of glorious preferments upon earth: they had been Luke 22.24
striving which of them should sit nearest unto their enthroned Lord; I say,
these Disciples, although they Mat. 16.16 John 6.69
knew Jesus as the Son of God,, yet ( not Mat. 20.9
knowing the Scriptures) they aimed at worldly greatness; they, as yet
fancied, that, Matthew. 20.21 Mark 9.34 Acts 1.6
Surely Christ would, in good time, reign gloriously upon earth: To follow this
( to them Mat. 2.2
known, to others Mat. 27.11
unknown) King of the Jews, they had Mark 10.28, 30
forsaken all, and, in so doing, they had Mat. 20.21 Luke 22.29
promised unto themselves no small advancement. Now, when they John 13.31
learn that God would straightway glorify their long attended Master, not with
Thrones, but with Thorns; not with a royal Diadem, but by (12) sufferings:
when they, in stead of seeing Christ restore the Kingdom unto Israel, hear him
Mat. 16.21 John 13.1.33 14.2.
contriving his departure out of this world; when, instead of being exalted by
their Lord, they must, by him, be Mat. 13.36, 37
shortly left at a loss; this was unto them a consternation of spirit; the
failing of this their long expectation made their Pro. 13.12
heart sick; this, this was one reason, why our Savior minds them, to their
comfort, ye believe in God.

Secondly, these were they which, Occasion.
of all men, had Luke 22.28
continued with Christ in his Temptations; Christ now twitteth them; how, of
them, one should John 13.21
betray him, another should John 13.38.
deny him, all should Mat. 36.31
forsake him; These were Mar. 8.38 Rev. 21.8
hard sayings: Their meek Master had deserved no such uncomely neglects from
them: And now, long at last, that He should pass so hard a censure upon them!
full ill Mat 26.22
could their ingenuous spirits brook these black imputations: this (you see)
was another occasion of their sorrows; another cause why Jesus Christ
encourages them to believe, as in God, so, in Himself.

Thirdly, Occasion.
The Scene was now Erasm. Marlorat. Jansen. in locum.
Tragrcal; a forsaking, a denying, a betraying of Christ could boad no good:
What the issue might be who could tell? if he who has no Sword, is by the
Patient Jesus, Luke 22.36
allarmed to buy one, matters must necessarily threaten some evil; Jesus
himself was John 13.21
troubled in Spirit; well, therefore might his Disciples be affrighted: That a
third reason of this consolation; Ye believe in God. Occasion.


Fourthly, Leoatius, Elsthym. Theodor. Mopsuest. etc. in locum.
They were not now Joh. 2.25
to learn, that, their Master could certainly divine; If Jesus spoke it, they
might Mat. 24.35
believe it: for a while Mat. 26.35.
flatter themselves they might, but, on second thoughts, their hearts might
well mis-give them: Their eyes had already seen Judas turning himself into Joh.
13.20
a Traitor: what was Mat. 20.23
foretold of Judas, that Judas was now Mar. 14.11
perpetrating; By the same rule, what was Mar. 14 16.
presuged of them, that they also should Mat. 26.56
too soon be guilty of: Or be it, that Judas had aforetime Mat. 26.8.
been false, Peter he had persevered; None more John 6.68
zealous, yea none more Mat. 14.29
daring then was Peter; nevertheless, Simon Peter he had his John 13.38
doom: Now, if Simon Peter could not stand, well might they expect to fall: The
Devil had already been busy with Luke 22.32
Cephas; should Satan sift them Luke 22.31.
as wheat too; they, alas, would soon appear but Mat. 3.12 Jer. 23.28
chafe. Fear whispered unto them, what dastards (for ought any courage they
had) they would make of themselves: Guilt, shame, unmanlinesse, were Mark 14.50
John 13.28 18.8.
already at their heels: That a fourth circumstance wherefore our Savior here
uses this supporting Instruction, As ye believe in God, believe also in me.

In the next place, Occasion.
if the young Prophets sought so unreasonably after 2 Kings 2.17
the late Head of their College; loath, very loath might these Disciples be, to
think of parting with Gorran. Tirinus. Maldonat. Jansenius in locum.
their dear Lord and Master: As yet, they walked more by sight, then by faith:
although they knew Christ as John 6.69
a Son of God, they knew him after the Mat. 16.22
flesh too: He had affectionately John 15.16
gathered them under his Mat. 23.37
wings, and it was warm John 14.20
being there: A Master so meek, so merciful, so tenderhearted, so endearing,
so communicative, so infinitely knowing, so miraculously Powerful; Woe Mat.
16.22 John 14.5.
were it with them, should they part with such a Teacher! No living for them,
but, at the Son of Gods Mat. 6.68. Acts 20.38
ell-bowe: Now to hear this their dear Lord talk thus of leaving of them, of
going away, of going away they could not John 13.33, 36 14.5.8.
imagine whether; This a fifth grief of mind; if the Bridegroom was Mat. 9.15
upon going, the children of the Bride-chamber could not Genesis 42.36
choose but mourn: they had no patience (they) to hear of Jesus Christ's
departure; This I reckon a fifth Argument why they were solaced: Believe in
God, believe also in me.

Again, Occasion.
The hour was now almost John 13.1 Matthew. 26.2
come, wherein the Son of Man must be crucified: A long time had been John
16.21. Mark 9.31
spent in preparing these Apostles for this trial; It had been, as warily, as
frequently hinted unto them, that Christ should suffer many things in
Jerusalem, and should after that, suffer death it self: Wherefore, as John 16.33
anon he animateth them. Be of good cheer ( in the world ye shall find trouble,
but, be of good cheer,) so he now comfort them, Let not your heart be
troubled: quasi, B^da, August. etc. in locum.
ye are already startled at late events; but, worse evils are yet to come: if
malice be hot Luke 23.31
against a green tree, it will be set on fire against the dry branches: You my
servants will be more Mat. 10.24 John 15.20.
despitefully persecuted then (am I) your Master: whosoever kills you, will
Mat. 16.2.
think he does his God good service; but, even then when my sufferings shall
portend yours, Let not your heart be troubled, neither be ye Mat. 14.27.
dismayed; but, believe in God, believe also in me.

Lastly, for me then for your selves; Occasion.

thinks.) To conclude, well may the heart of a prosperous sinner be troubled,
since Pride swells and paineth him; Idleness distracteth and wearieth him;
Worldlymindednesse cloyeth and choaketh him; alas, he is sick of himself; his
heart is troubled merely for want of troubles; and y etlet him know, though all
the flames of Hell heat that iron hot 2 Timothy 4.2
wherewith he seareth his shipwracked conscience, though his conscience wax so

unnatural that it neglect to accuse for particular sins; yet, in the general,
his heart 1 John 3.20
condemns him; he has within himself the sentence of death eternal; no
favor he deserves, and none he expects; I say, the expectation of the
wicked is Pro. 11.23
wrath, wrath to come; and, even in this sense, his heart is troubled; I say,
as the Spirit of God witnesses Romans 8.16 2 Cor. 1.22 5.5.

sealed unto the day of Redemption; so the Spirit of wickedness witnesses
unto him who does despite unto the Spirit of Grace, that he has Jer. 7.19
John 3.18.36 Heb. 10.27
rejected God unto his own everlasting destruction.

Secondly, If no sin, says St. Augustine. de Civitate dei, lib. 1. cap. 7.
St. Augustine, If no sin were openly punished in this world, the Divine
Justice would not be believed. Beloved, this is one reason why the same God,
who passes by some foolhardy Unbelievers with a Jer. 2.19

Thirdly, Who so does what is Right, but not with an upright mind, has a mind
to be troubled: If Machiavel has the policy to attain not virtue it self, but
the appearance of virtue, I rather pity thed envy him; fool that he is, while
he fancieth the exercise of Virtue burdensome, but the credit of it beneficial,
he is a contradiction unto himself; Pusillanimity Omnis compositio indigentiae

and comfort for the broken Spirit: Comfort (I say) for the heart of unbelief;
but, for the sound Believer, the Life of Comfort.

First, Comfort even for the heart of unbelief. Of Comfort.


He that believes not, Even for Unbelievers, viz. against their Unbelief.
is John 3.18
condemned already, because he has not believed in the Name of the only
begotten Son of God: yea, but [as desperate a sinner as thou art] this is thy
comfort, that, the very circumstances of this one Text alone, mind thee, invite
thee, nay urge and constrain thee to believe in Jesus Christ as in Esaias 55.7,
8, 9 Ezekiel. 18.21, 22
a Mediator, ready to seek and save even thy lost Soul. Here are four
circumstances, within the compass of my Text, which do, in Christ his stead,
beseech thee to be reconciled unto Him.

1 Circumstance. main occasion of all these troubles, Circumstance.
which thou see thus tumbling in here upon these Disciples, viz. Jesus
Christ's John 13.1
being made an offering for sin: His hour was come: and it was Mat. 16.21
compared with John 13.21, and 14.1
against the sad sight of his ineffable sufferings, that He here engages his
Disciples, Let not your heart be troubled. Sinner, Bethink thy self: Jesus
Christ his sufferings 1 John 22
are thy pardon. Come unto him, thou that art heavy laden Mar. 11.28
Christ will ease thee: Hate sin, that Christ Act. 26.18
may pardon it: Did the Lord Christ suffer the death of his body, and the
fierce wrath of his own Father, all to keep thee from Hell, and will thou again
pawn thy Soul unto the Devil 1 Pet. 5.1
for some trifling sin? Are fire and brimstone Matthew. 25.30 Jude 15. Esaias 30.33
2.19.
and everlasting darkness such flea-bitings? Are Peace and Glory and Rev. 21.7
everlasting Joy so contemptible, that, whatsoever the Son of God has
suffered, should not at all concern thy soul? Cast off thy Dan 4.27 Esaias 30.22
sins, thine unprofitable sins: for, for Thee Christ dyed; Thy, Thy Soul, the
Merciful Jesus would pardon! Thirst, Dan 55.1 Revel. 22.17
thirst after Righteousness; that Christ may impute it: Jesus Christ has Isa.
53.4
born thine iniquities; and will thou pluck them from off His shoulders, to
(again) place them upon thine own? Oh, rather, set thy face toward Heaven; and
look, look up, upon Zech. 12 10
Him, whom Thou have pierced: Let Christ but see once Esaias 53.11
of the travel of his Soul, and He shall be satisfied, and thou too. The Son of
God dyed, and dyed to save thee from thy sins. That is one Inducement to force
Foelix est periculum ad Deum consuge e.
thine heart of unbelief, to seek the Lord while he may be found.

2. Circumstance. Although this was, Circumstance.
the same night wherein he was betrayed, from the beginning of Chap. 13. unto
the end of Chap. 17. Christ takes much thought, not for his dying self, but
for his sinful Disciples. Sinner, it will not repent him that He laid down
his life for thy sake, if, where He has laid it down, there, thou would
take it up: for thy preservation he is solicitous, for his own he was not.

3. A third Circumstance. Evangelists, Circumstance.
three other faithful Penmen Jesus Christ had of his most holy Gospel; but,
such a subject as this; This, the turning of his bowels, the unbosoming of his
loving Kindnesses! so choice a portion of the Gospel. as is this, He peculiarly
reserveth for his fittest Pen man! His bosom Evangelist, his beloved Disciple,
his darling JOHN shall be the Author of this Evangelical Scripture; and (this)
purposely, that, such a desperate Caitiffe, as thou have been, may John 20.31
believe, and conceive hopes.

4 Circumstance. tender compassion of Christ Jesus over the present troubles of
these Disciples hearts. Circumstance.
Sinner, The heart which melts to see a wound lanced, will never have the
power to see a Sword ripping up thine entrails: What troubles these Disciples
here met with, were but only the troubles of this world; yet (see here) the
swooning of Christ's bowels! (Tell me) Would not Jesus Christ endure, that these
should perplex their hearts; and will he take any pleasure in the eternal
torments of thy lost Soul? (Believe it) the merciful Jesus does not willingly
afflict. To, be gracious he waits; at thy death he aims not. Thy Spirit had
long since failed before him, had not He forborne to strike; I tell thee, Thy
case, thy state of unbelief, is so desperate, that, God deferreth his just
anger unto the very last minute! He knows, should Thou to Hell once, thou
art (then) a lost man for ever: After death, no redemption. Thy sins are so
great, that Christ would (if possible) forgive them; although thou imaginest
not so. He would, if thou would assent, heal all thy backslidings, lest
otherwise thy Soul, thy wretched Soul, should, unto all eternity be tormented,
miserably tormented in Hell, in the nethermost Hell. If the Disciples
afflictions move Christ unto compassion, know, the vengeance due unto thy sins
pierces his heart; Should thou to Goal once, thou would be sure to be
condemned and executed; wherefore, ere ever thou art questioned for thy life,
Thy Jesus would procure for thee the Kings pardon: nay, He has procured it,
and wills thee to accept it upon the Kings terms. Sinner, if thou have grace
to believe any one of these Circumstances, these Circumstances will be unto
thee Life from the dead.

Secondly, Life of comfort for Believers. For Believers.


First, against all worldly distresses, Against worldly distresses.
viz. Although the afflictions of the Righteous are Psalm 34.19
many, yet 1 Pet. 4.12
think not that strange. True, [as A Child of God in the anguish of her spirit

replied unto her Minister] A sharp Visitation seems to signify displeasure:
but, Let not your heart be troubled; For First, The very same afftictions are

common unto men, nay, unto Saints. Art thou afflicted? Answ. So were Christ's
chosen Disciples: yea, so. was Jesus Christ Himself, even in the compassions of
this very Text! His heart was troubled, then, when he said, Let not your heart
be troubled; I say, Secondly: So kind a Master, so loving a Brother is Jesus

63.9
afflicted with thee: He, in this Text, forgot his own sufferings (although so
near at hand!) that he might Dr. Sibs Sermon on John 14.1
comfort his Disciples in these their troubles. Thirdly, The same Redeemer who
brings the trouble, lays this command, Let not your heart be troubled: Be
ye sure now, He who John 14.1 Esaias 54.5, 7, 8 40.1, 2 Jerem. 31.20 Hos. 11.8, 9
will not give way that thy heart should be any whit troubled at all, will, in
due time, remove what He Himself dis-liketh. If thy Plaster Romans 8.28 Phil.

hurt, it shall be taken off, and that quickly: Or ever he find out a
temptation for thee, he will out a way for thy 1 Cor. 10.13
temptations escape, rather then thy heart should be overmuch troubled. What
thou can not Heb. 7.25 Matthew. 11.30 12.20
well bear, shall never burden thy feeble shoulders. Fourthly: Suppose thy
distress burdensome; I reckon that the sufferings of this Romans 8.18
present life are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be
revealed in us. What, yea what, are these light afflictions which are but for a

wounds of a Friend. I know, O Lord, that thy Judgments are true, and that
thou in [4] very faithfulness have afflicted me. Sixthly: Believe also in
Christ: In Him thou may find peace: He John 14.29
foretells thee that he has John 16.33
overcome the world for thee: He has John 13.15
given thee an Example of Luke 21.29
possessing thy Soul in patience: His peace he John 14.27
gives unto thee; and what he gives, that he ibid.
leaves with thee: He puts that into thine eye which will make thee see the
better; sows that in thy Psalm 126.5 Heb. 12.11
tears which will bring forth fruit to thine account, even the peaceable fruits
of Righteousness. Once, Jesus Christ does in thy sufferings give thee the
Phil. 1.29.3.10. 2 Cor. 4.11
Credit, the Reputation, the honor of having a fellowship in his sufferings.


A second Life of Comfort here is, Against the death of our Friends.

every side? So were these Disciples: Art thou disappointed of worldly hopes? So
were these Disciples: Is some dear Friend deceased? Lo, these Disciples were

Master, you have viz. p. 235.
already seen; but This was not all: When Jesus had escaped death, was Luke
24.21

them again, for his Disciples then again to lose Him, to lose Him whom Cant. 3.4
their Soul had found, Him who Revel. 1.18
was dead and is alive, and behold he lives for evermore! This, this is much,
very much! One would think, if at Christ his death his Disciples hearts were
troubled, they would have been, at his Acts 1.6,11
ascension, troubled much more. Did I not say unto my Lord 2 Kings 4.28
Do not deceive me? If, when Christ dyed, all their hopes Luke 24.21
dyed with him; then much more, when he arose, their hopes Luke 33.34 Acts 1.11

depart from his Disciples again, to depart from them now no more by a necessity
of death, but, during health and life; to ascend from them Luke 24.9.

chosen us! To love our selves more then we do love him in whom the great God is
so well-pleased! This, you will yield, is a very great defection; He Luke 9.23
Mark 8.38
that takes not up His Cross, his daily cross, neither follows Christ
crucified into whatsoever perils this his crucified Lord shall conduct him
(such a one) is unworthy of so great, so good a Master; Whosoever is ashamed of
Jesus Christ, of him Jesus Christ has just reason to be more (much more)
ashamed! Meek he is, yet the wrath of this Lamb has [as justly as] mercifully
threatened, that, Whosoever denies Him before Matthew. 10.33 2 Timothy 2.12

In one word, Rev. 21.8
Hell is a portion for the fearful; and fearful were these Disciples;
nevertheless, so far was Christ Jesus from not forgiving them their
trespasses, that he most compassionately preventeth them, Let not your heart be
troubled. Wherefore, all ye, who Ezekiel. 6.9 20.43 36.31

more: Alas, no (...).
Toad is so ugly in man's sight, as man's venomous nature is in the holy eyes of
the most pure God: A sinful condition is an Psalm 51.5 Job 25.6

wretched practices; practices, better becoming the Devils who are accursed of
God, then the Disciples who were blessed of the Lord; Mean while, Give God the
glory, -- Haec and alia adduxerunt Gregorium ut clamaret, O Faelix culpa, quae

His arm is not shortened that it cannot save; He can remove from us as well
all our stains as all our guilt; He who delivered us from so great a death,
could (had he seen cause so to do) have quite warded off the lesser wounds; The
Lord Christ could have strengthened his Disciples every whit as much before his
Ascension, as, after his Ascension, he did; and (would he so please) He could,
since Adams fall, make us, every way as perfect, as before that fall of Adam,
we were: yea, he is able to make us both as unspotted of sin, and as gloriously
gracious in this present evil world, as we shall be in the next; This he is
able to do; but he, according to His wisdom sees cause to the contrary; this,
this alone may comfort us against our sinful nature, that God, the infinite
God is wise; His wisdom is a Believers comfort.

And yet, Why have thou made us to err Esaias 63.17

all uncleanness and wickedness soever? It was not, it could not be unknown
unto the most holy Jesus, how that Peter would deny him, or, how that these
other disciples would all of them forsake him: Fore-known unto Him it was,
prevented by him it was not! Behold, O Lord our Redeemer; Thou have dyed for
sin, and yet sin abides in us! Thou have called us unto holiness, and yet we
have no inherent holiness at all; alas, we continue above measure sinful!

We may find comfort from the reasons which he Romans 15.4

magnifieth that John 5.27 compared with Prove. 29.2, and Job 36.22

the world should know it: In the work of his Creation, he John 1.3 Heb. 1.2
shows himself a free agent, forming many Creatures quite void of life, many
capable of life: among living creatures he gives unto some a power vegetative
(as that of Herbs, Trees, etc.) but not sensible; to others (as that of brutes)
a power both vegetative and sensible, but not rational; but, unto mankind he
gives a power vegetative, sensible, and Genesis 1.27
reasonable too: Just thus, the Son of man (to show how absolutely his elect
Vessels are Ephesians. 1.22 Phil 1.10 Revel. 4.11
at his pleasure) His pleasure is, that man before his souls conversion Rom
11.32 Gal. 3.22

The demeanor of Gods Children under their corruptions, Job 1.8, 22 Deuteronomy. 32.5

not with that high hand, not with that greediness, not with the like
presumption, fearlesnesse, shamelessness or impenitency: When we commit evil,
there is (sooner, or later) some regret, some remorse, some compunction, some
mis-givings in our consciences: St. Peter Matthew. 27.75

2. 2 Comfort.
Our continual guilt ever remembers us Romans 6.23 Lam. 3.39 Psalm 103.3, 4

it must be because their lives were given unto them for a prey. The Lords
mercy it is Heb. 12.29
that we are not eternally consumed.

3. 3 Comfort.
Our corruptions mind us from what an Psalm 51.6 Exodus 12.8.11, compared with

Who would maintain an enmity against holiness? Who would make provision for

proves us. What thanks is it unto the Sun, that he daily runs so even a
course? or that his beams are ever glorious? just none at all: for, a
necessity of Nature compels the Sun to be as he is, and to do as he does: I
say, the Sun does never run, nor shine upon choice: But our God (who works in
us all our holy desires) sets before us, as well evil, as good: that. we

may have the comfort of choosing the better part. Since God works in us both
to will, and to do, then, when we loath our mis-doings, we know whom we are
for: Did no sin dwell in us, it would not then appear to us that we follow
after Righteousness for our Gods sake, We should then lose that satisfaction,
which we now partake of. Namely, while our hearts assure us, that, we hate
every false way, [hate sin, as sin; nay, as our, nay, as our Gods enemy] we can
then conclude [we can then unto our Joy conclude] that, while we Romans 7.25
in the mind serve the Law of God, His we are Romans 6.16 2 Kings 9.32

Our demerits Ezekiel. 16.61, 63 Romans 8.5

this we know that Jesus Christ Hos. 14.4 Romans 3.24 1 Cor. 2.12 John 15.16 Esaias
64.6 63.7 Deuteronomy. 9.6, 7 10.15
loves his Disciples freely! Herein is comfort, the Rich Bridegroom of our
Souls, loves His Spouse as well in sickness as in health; He takes us with
all our faults; He loves us, not for our sake, but for his own; He loves us,
merely because he delights to love us.

no Crown; no Victory, no conquest; no fight, no Victory; no sin against which
to strive, no fight; Behold now (O ye mortals) it is a favor if we are singled
out to be of the forlorn hope; a favor, if we are allowed to strive against
that evil which the holy Spirit of our Almighty God overcomes for us; The
gracious and bountiful God fights in us, and for us, purposely that he may
reward and crown us according unto ( our, rather according unto) his Victories.
So deals the most liberal Lord God by us, as we deal by our little children;
We find employments for our very little children, not for any service which

all possible encouragement: We do every minute put them upon duty, that we may
every minute feed them with Rewards. Oh, my Beloved, These troubles, in these
Disciples hearts, are abundantly recompensed within the Quomodo multas

and the same breath, the mighty Jesus, both forewarneth Peter, thou shall deny
me thrice, and forearmeth Peter, Let not thine heart be troubled. Now, as here
is life of comfort against our inherent silthinesse, and superfluity of
naughtiness; so here is strong Consolation against our decay and want of
grace. When these Disciples were John 13.38
foretold, that [as well resolved as they were] they should forsake Christ;
when they had heard, within how small a space, Cephas should, thrice at once
deny his Master; then there arose in their heart fears and jealousies,
doubtings and despair; They then began to suspect, that they should fall more
grievously then Peter; but, Jesus Christ does (you see) support them. Says

Now, that so it may be;

FIrst, I shall determine in what sense God, may be said to be glorified.

Secondly, Since our glorifying of God is the whole Duty of our whole life,
what great reason all of us still have, still to glorisie this King of glory.

Thirdly, That our hearts, obviously review these Kingdoms within my Text,
since, travail through them, I can not.

Beloved, These three generals are the particular limits of my remaining
Discourse; the which our God [the God of all grace and glory] so sanctify unto
us all, that his most blessed Name may be, by every one among us, more and more
abundantly glorified.

GOD is said to be glorified both by Himself, and by his Creatures:

1. In what sense God is said to be glorified.
By Himself.

If we cast into the Ocean one only spoonful of water, By himself.
one only drop of a bucket, we thereunto add; because, although the Sea be
great and wide, infinite it is not: but, unto Gods essential glory none can
add; for his glory is, like Acquaint thy self with God as be is described by B.
ushers folio. Christian Religon, Bishop Baily his Practice of Piety, Mo nay his
Tru^nesse of Christian Religion, Balls larger Catechism, or such others; for,
It is life eternal to know God. viz. Veluntas sequitur intellectum.
every other of his Attributes, every way infinite. It is more impossible,
infinitely more impossible, for any, yea for all the Creatures in the world, to
add either glory, or blessedness (that I may not say delight, or content) unto
the most infinite God, then it is for the darkest Dungeon to augment the
brightness, or for the blackest coal to multiply the beams of the mid day Sun:
There can be no accession unto his essential blessedness, because he is for
ever most infinitely blessed! There can be no accession unto his glory, because
His glory is eternally the same!

In the soul of man the power of the Understanding, of the Imagination, (1) Non
est necesse Deum velle aliquid nisi seipsum: Non est ergo necessarium Deum
velle quod mundus fuerit semper: Sed eatenus mundus est, quatenus Deus vult
illum esse, cum esse mundi ex voluntate Dei dependeat. Tho. Aquinas. 1 a. q.
46.3. c.
and of the Memory, abides equally the same, whether what is undestood,
conceived and remembered, be, or be not, produced in word, or writing: so, after
a most incomprehensible manner, in the divine nature, the glory of the Father,
the glory of the Son, the glory of the Holy Ghost, was equally the same before
all worlds, as ever since the Creation it has been, and for ever hereafter
will be.

The great God who, from all never-begun Eternity unto the beginning of time,
took pleasure in forbearing to make any Creature at all, did not at last Genesis
1.1 John 1.1 Heb. 1.2 11.2
make the Heavens and the Earth, as repenting himself of his eternity of
leisure before; neither did his then Creation proceed St. August. de civitate
Dei. lib. 12. cap. 17. With men, animae quiescendo fiunt sapientiores; it is
not so with God.
from any new intent, neither may we conceive that his Rest affects him one
way, and his Work another; I neither was his Vacation idle, or his working
painful: for, as before the Creation, he rested working; so, since the Creation
he works resting: again, as at first in creating, so afterward in redeeming,
preserving, ruling, sanctifying, etc. neither increases he his essential
glory, neither changes he his eternal purpose; He (in all these) only applies
his eternal Will unto new workings: As Rom 11.36
of him, and through him, so to him are all things; yet, of all those things
which he has made, and does govern, it is His Glory that he Psalm 50.12 Job
12.2, 3
needs none. Wherefore, as it was of his free goodness, that, he, in the
beginning, created the world, so Deus suam gloriam quaerit non propter se sed
propter nos. Tho. Aquin. 22. ae. q. 32. art. 1. ad 1. mum.
of his free goodness it is that he (ever since) glorifieth Himself in them.

Then is God said to glorify himself when he vouchsafes to manifest any of
his excellencies, whether Esaias 6.3 Hab. 3.3 1 Pet. 4.13
universally, by way of Redemption, Creation, etc. or Esaias 60.7 Ezekiel. 43.2
Numb. 14.21 John 13.31
particularly, upon distinct ages, places, or persons.

Romans 11 35
self-glory of the most high God; yet on the other side, such several prints
and degrees of his goodness has the most high God Acts 14 17 Romans 1.20
communicated unto all his works, that all his works glorify him as they
concur with the good pleasure of either his revealed, or his secret Will; thus,
all of them more remarleably set forth the wisdom, etc. of his providence;
some of them; the power and severity of his Justice; others, the Riches of his
free grace and mercies.

First, His Providence.
To say nothing of Psalm 77.19 135.6
unsearchable co-operations, harmonious contextures, regulated contingencies,
and sim. Every creature, as it existeth, and works after its kind, sets
forth Gods Providence; whether Rivers as they Eccles. 1.7
run into the Sea, or the Sun as he knows his Psalm 104 19 148.3, 9
going down; whether the Stars as they keep their due motions, or the Trees
bearing fruit in their season; yea, Angels (whether good, or evil) while they
reserve the nature of spirits; and men, whether regenerate, or unregenerate, as
they partake of body, and of spirit too: For, although Devils have Jude 6.
corrupted themselves with envy, malice, pride, etc. and although man has
Eccl. 7.29
fallen from his integrity; yet, the nature of Devils as it continues the
distinct nature of intelligent spirits; the body of man, as it speaks the
flesh neither of beasts, nor of birds, nor of fishes, but of men; likewise man's
spirit, as it produces the operations of the soul, not of a brute, but of a
reasonable Creature, do (all of them) after the same manner as all other
Creatures do, In quantum sunt res quaedam, Deus est in daemonibus. Tho. Aquin.
1 a. q. 8. 1. c. 4. m. U^^co, and simplicissimo actu, omnia in sua bonitate
vult Deus; licet ejusdem suae divinae voluntatis nulla prorsus sit causa. Idem
1 a. q. 19. art. 5. c.
bring glory unto the Providence of the great God; I say, whether Physically,
or Metaphysically considered, the worst of men and the worst of Angels, by
performing that whereunto their nature was ordained, and in observing (after
their kinds) the ocult laws of their Creator, glorify Gods Providence; that
is, they expose an open view of it unto Psalm 148. per totum. Psalm 139.14
Revel. 14.7
Creatures reasonable and intelligent.

Secondly, His Justice.
as creatures, show forth Gods Providence, although they mean not so; but,
Reprobates, as Reprobates, though even they also mean no such matter, do Romans
9.22
set forth his Justice. St. Augustine rightly St. August. de civitate Dei. lib.
11. cap. 17. and cap. 16.
affirms, that, the Almighty God would never have foreknown vice in any work
of his, whether Man, or Angel, but, that He, likewise foreknew what good use to
make of their bad conditions. His World, like a well composed Poem, is made the
more graceful by Eccl. 33.13
Antitheses, contrarieties, and things opposed. The Omnia propter seipsum fecit
Deus, omnia propter suos. Bernard. Sermon. 3. in Pentecost.
good Mason refuses no stone; The Lord for this purpose Romans 9.17
raised up Pharaoh, that he might upon Pharaoh exalt his power: The World shall
know that he is greater then all Gods: Whereby shall they know it? Ans. In the
thing wherein they dealed proudly, he Exodus 18.11
will be above them. The Lord, he, as he Romans 8.28

out of Flints. While ungodly persons rage as enemies, the Psalm 56.10
wrath of man works Gods praise: The fiercer the Jer. 51.20 Psalm 17.13
Lion, the more serviceable for his pleasure; The blood-thirstinesse of the
Horseleech is 1 Cor. 3.22
subservient unto the skill of this Physician: Then when the Lord Esaias 25.2, 3
reduces strong and terrible Nations unto fear and ruinous heaps, those
Nations, now no more strong and terrible, shall glorify him, viz. they shall
make the severity of his power the more conspicuous: The mighty God, then
appears like himself, when he Obad. 4
over-toppeth haughty sinners: He, as he is the 2 Cor. 3.5 James 1.17
free Doner of good desires, so he is the Esaias 66.18
great Disposer of evil wills: While men and Angels incline their free will
evilly, he uses their evil wills St. August. ubi supra.
rightly and well. As the fruitful, so the dead and withered Tree sets forth
the heat of the Sun. His strength is seen, as upon the melting wax, so upon the
Romans 9.18
hardened mud. It is the Compare the beginning of Bishop Reynolds 3 d. Sermon.

glory of this Sun of Righteousness that he sheddeth light upon those
Creatures from whom he receives no retribution at all; and that, where heal he
does not, there scorch he will. As he drives wicked wretches upon those issues
which they never designed, so he brings upon them that end which he ever
intended; as he hammereth stubborn Irons unto his more immediate purposes, so
out of their obstinacy he fetches praise. Although transgressors start aside
from the order of Gods Precepts, they abide still within the compass of his
Providence; His merciful, his revealed Will they resist; but Romans 9.19
beyond his just and secret Will they cannot go. I conclude then, while the
wicked, by those evil practices which accompany unbelief, draw upon themselves
Hos. 13.9 2 Pet. 2.1
perdition, they, by their perdition Romans 9.22 Revel, 18.20 19.2
glorify the justice of our God.

Thirdly, the works of God, His free grace.
as they are His works Psalm 145.9, 10
generally declare his Providence; and whereas unbelievers, as unbelievers
Psalm 46.10
become a chief object of his severity, Psalm 145.10
and justice; the free goodness of God, that, principally appears toward his
Elect. These, these, voluntarily, and intentionally Psalm 11.12.
honor Him who is above all, and in us all; As the Reprobates are Romans 9.22, 23
vessels fitted by themselves, for destruction; so the true Believers of the
Gospel are made, by God, vessels of mercy; God can Bishop Reynolds ubi supra.
bring light out of light, as he brings the light of the stars out of the
light of the Sun; and God can bring light out of darkness, as at the Creatiou
he did; we may fetch fire out of a flint, and from a burning coal; in the
burning coal there is a meetnesse for such a use, in the stony flint no such
aptness. Now, they best glorify God, who are meetest to set forth his honor,
and such are Psalm 50.22, 23 2 Timothy 2.21
the Elect. From unbelievers God Jer. 16 v. 21. compared with v. 18.
forces his praise; from sound Believers it Psalm 50.15
flows kindly; The dreadful Name of Jehovah they exah upon necessity, these
out of duty; They, unaware to themselves; These upon sincere choice: The
ungodly, although they mean not so, fulfill Gods secret pleasure; the godly,
with full purpose of heart obey his revealed Will. Creatures incapable of
reason, nor do, nor can know that they serve their Maker, while Esaias 66.2 45.18
their Maker they do serve; graceless persons know they should magnify him,
but, to magnify him they Esaias 41.28 26.10
have no heart; but, as for the faithful Disciples of Christ, they (as they
know that it is their duty, so) they Psalm 51.19 9.14 64.10
make it their desire to exalt his Name: Unto the glory of his blessed Name all
the works of God Psalm 119.91
concur: but, the true Believer, he, not only coucurreth, but assenteth, not
only assenteth, but endeavors Esaias 26 8, 9
earnestly endeavors, etc. Beloved, in this sense it is, that the Lord God
does Esaias 24.15 Jer. 9.24
in his most holy Scriptures; and that I (the unworthiest of his Ministers) do,
in this weak Discourse, stir up your pure minds to glorify your God, the God
and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom, also, together with his Spirit of
Grace, be glory for evermore, Amen.

Now, God blessed for ever is glorified by us, in our words, in our works, in
our hearts.

unruly soever this fiery member is, yet, its genuine and proper use, is, to

Angels in Heaven, bless the God of all blessings. In four several Psalms the
sweet singer of Israel calls his tongue Psalm 16.9 30.12 57.8 108.1
his glory; and, of those four Psalms, two are, like the verses of Pythagoras,
Psalm 16. Psalm 57. (...).
entitled golden; so great a value has the Holy Ghost set upon those Psalms,
which enform us wherein our glory lies, viz. in instructing, exhorting and
edifying one another: in calling upon God Psalm. 5 3 64.1 66.19 71.1
with our voice, that is, (11) in glorifying of him with the best member that
we have. We shall Psalm. 31.17 115.17
keep silence in the grave, but, the Esaias 38 19
living, the living they shall praise thee, O God. Guilt Job 7.20
and Job 40.4, 5
fear, Lam. 3.28, 2 9
and extremity of grief may indeed silence our thoughts; but, the Believers
guilt is rolled in the blood of Jesus, his fearfulness is removed by a trust
in his God, and his griefs are swallowed up in spiritual consolations; So long
as Hannah was in bitterness of soul, she 1 Samuel 1.13, 15 2.1
prayed silently; but, so soon as God answered her prayers, presently Her mouth
was enlarged: Happy he, who while he makes his requests known unto God, has
-- recti custos imitator honesti, Et nihil arcano qui rogat ore Deos. Martial.
Qui aperto vivit voto: nec Labra movet metuens audiri. Seneca. Epist. 10.
no need to conceal them from men. And as it is one thing to pray, another
thing to pray with the voice; so to praise is one thing, to sing praise
another: With the mouth Romans 10.10
confession is made unto God; In his Temple does every man Psalm 29.9
speak of his honor; I will speak of thy Testimonies also before Kings, and
Psalm 119.46
will not be ashamed: With my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness Psalm
89.1 compared with Esaias 38.19
to all generations: I have not hid thy Commandments within my heart: His
praise shall be continually Psalm 34.1
in my mouth. In God we boast Psalm 44.8
all the day long. These and the like Scriptures show us how comely and
pleasant a Duty it is, not to stifle our holy thoughts within our breasts, but
to glorify God in our words.

In our words our God is glorified.
First, When we so speak, as they that must Matthew. 12.36
give an account of every idle word.

Secondly, When, in a due manner, we 1 Timothy 5.20 2 Timothy 4.2 Heb. 3.13 Romans 15.14
rebuke, reprove, instruct, exhort, admonish, comfort, etc.

Object. Am I my Brothers keeper?

Answ. Who, except Genesis 4.9
Cain, would have Levit. 19.17
asked that Question? Verily, since we are all members of one mystical body, we
must Romans 14.19 Heb. 10.24
build up one another in our most holy faith; Iron Pro. 27.17
sharpeneth iron; In living water, face answers to face, and a Pro. 27.9.
. faithful Counselor is life. Where is our delight, if not Psalm. 16.3
upon the Saints that are on the earth? In religious Conference, we do not so
much 1 These. 5.14 Heb. 12.12
remove the doubts of others, as resolve our own: we seem unto our selves as if
unto us it were Luke 12.12 20.14, 15
given, in that hour, both what we should speak, and what we should answer:
There is that Prove. 11.24

waters, shall be watered again: I exhort therefore, that in our Deuteronomy. 11.19
household businesses, in the Deuteronomy. 18.20
several works of our Callings, in our mutual Visits, in our Journeys, yea, in
Deuteronomy. 6.6, 7, 8, 9
all our Affairs, our speech may be seasoned with salt (I mean) with Col. 4.6
white salt: And [that, it may be good Ephesians. 4.25
unto the use of edifying, that, good words may 1 Cor. 15.33
confirm good manners] I more especially entreat of you two things: The one,
that you would know, and make known good Books: Meet upon the Road As Philip,
Acts 9.29, 30, met the Eunuch. See Luke 24.15, etc.
a Passenger whom never before thou did, never again thon shall see in this
world, if he learn from thee the Title of some Treatise v. 27
apposite to the welfare of his thirsting soul, he may speed the better for thy
sake, to life everlasting. Holy Books are Good books well read, do make young
men sober, old men happy, poor men rich, and rich men honorable, as Diogenes
spoke of Literature. Legendi semper occasio est, audiendi non semper. Plin.
lib. 2. ep. 3.
abiding helps, daily Counselors, ready Physicians, Manna in a golden pot;
especially, in our Gilead, where Balm excels! Beloved, the garden of Eden,
wherein we dwell, is a Paradise of all healing herbs, of exquisite spiritual
flowers, and of most angelical Roots; [Knew we how to sort them to our use]
there abound among us, almost, as many divine Medicines, as natural
infirmities! My second request is, that, ye would acquaint one another, not
only with other men's works, but with Romans 15.14
your own experiences: being converted your selves, help Luke 22.32
your Brethren; comfort them with the comforts wherewith ye your selves are 2
Cor. 1.4
comforted of God. How do you? How does such, or such a friend? is the form of
salutation most usual among us, yea, and most Christian too; It does or should
argue in us, not only a Phil. 1.5.

earnest desire to remedy, wherein we may, what we can. Beloved, sincere
friendship is inquisitive after the health of the body, but Phil. 1.19
more, far more, after the health of the soul: You that ask me, How I do, if my
3 John 2.4 2 John 4
soul prospers, ye are glad of it: Oh then, what Ephesians. 6.18
sins ye would have most prayed against, enform me; as likewise, what Ephesians. 6.19.
graces you have most need of. What devices of Satan you 2 Cor. 2.11
have found out, what back-doors ye have discovered in your Jer. 17.9
treacherous hearts, what 2 Pet. 2.9
escapes from temptation, what Jer. 31.19
helps to Repentance, what 2 Pet. 1.10
advantages toward Duty, what Psalm 27.13
supports of faith, what 2 Pet. 3.18 1.8.
growth of grace ye have observed within your selves, that, cordially impart
unto your bosome-friends. So many of you as understand what 1 Timothy 6.18 Heb.
13.16
belongs unto the neighbourhoods of Piety, engrosse not that experience unto
your selves, which may benefit others. Freely ye have received, Matthew. 10.8
freely give. The Lord is with them that Psalm 34.4
uphold my soul; Come and hearken all ye that fear God, I will declare what he
Psalm 66.16
has done for my soul. What ye believe, that enjoy; ye believe the Communion
of Saints; in such Communions our 1 These 4.9
God is glorified.

Thirdly, When in the worship of the most holy God our self-accusations,
confessions, complaints, intercessions, supplications, and petitions are, for
the matter and form of them, Scripture Proof, and go not out of Psalm 17.1
feigned lips; then do Romans 10.10 See Matthew. 6.6
our words glorify our God; and more, when Matthew. 18.20
jointly with others, then when separately by our selves alone; more, when in
Genesis 18.19 Josh. 24.15
our open families, then, in our retired closets; more, when in our Psalm
107.32 26.12
public congregations, then, when in our private families. I was Psalm 122.1
glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.

Object. That house of the Lord was erected by Gods immediate command, our
Steeplehouses not so.

Answ. 1. That Command was 2 Timothy 3.16 Romans 15.4
written for our learning.

Answ. 2. As the Temple at Jerusalem was a Esaias 56.7
House of prayer unto all Nations, viz. an Esaias 62.10
Ensign lifted up upon Mount Zion, to draw in all the Psalm 22.27 Esaias 55.5
Zech. 2.11
Gentiles unto the then true worship of the only true God: So among us, Houses
set apart for divine worship are 1 Cor. 14.23, 24 10, 20, 21 11.19 Revel. 14.6
John 15.22 Cant. 1.8 Jer. 13.11
Gods witnesses, and Ensigns set up to leave inexcusable, may to reclaim
Sectaries, Papists, Jews, Turks, Pagans, and Atheists from the error of their
way, unto, pure worship of the God of truth.

Answ. 3. It is fully as Acts 9.20 13.5 15.2 18.4
lawful for us to have our several Churches for the convenience of our several
Villages, as it was for the Jews to have their Psalm. 74.8 Matthew. 4.23 9.35
Mark 1.21, 39 Luke 4.16 7.5 John 18.20
diverse Synagogues for the convenience of their diverse Cities.

Answ. 4. Compare Deuteronomy. c. 17.14. with c. 12.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. In 2 Samuel
7. compare v. 3, 7, 10, with v. 2. and v. 6. with Acts c. 1.13. and c. 2.1.
Compare 1 These. 1.9. When the Temples of dumb Idols are like those Censers,
Numb. 16.37, 38, 39, 40. consecrated unto the living God, they are unto us
memorials of Thankfulness.
with 1 Cor. 11, 17, 18, 22. compare Esaias 66.1. with Hag. 1.4. and, although I
know assuredly that the glory of the Gospel consists not in pomp, but in
truth; not in things carnal, but in things spiritual; yet compare Hag. 1.4.
Prove. 3.9. Luke 8, 3. Romans 15.27. 1 Cor. 9.11. John 12.7. 2 Cor. 8.9, 12. Phil.
4.17. with Psalm 72.10, 15. and with 2 Cor. 3.9, 10, 11. Esaias 60.6. and 61.6.
and 66.10, 11. and Hag. 2.7, 8. compare Philem. 19. with 2 Samuel 19.30.

Answ. 5. In the room of the Levitical Priesthood Jesus Christ Mat. 10.1 Acts
1.8 Ephesians. 4.11 1 Cor. 12.28
ordained a Ministry; in the stead of Circumcision, he brought in John. 4.2
Mark 16.16 Matthew. 3.16 28.19 1 Pet. 3.21
Baptism; and, in the place of the 1 Cor. 5.7, 8 11.24, 25.
Passover he instituted his Holy Supper; Now, those being required, it were
superfluous to enjoin time and place; these are naturally coincident: if God
was solemnly magnified in the Messiah yet to come, the Messiah being already
come, God must much more be magnified. A Testament we still have, and that Heb.
9.15
not the old, but a new one; If God take away the first, it is that he may Heb.
10.9
establish the second: If old things are passed away, 2 Cor. 5.17
new things does he declare.

Object. That Christ ordained a Ministry, Baptism, and the Eucharist, we read;
we read not that he appointed, Festivals, Meeting-places, no nor yet the
Lord's Day.

A. This new Covenant, which the Lord now makes, puts such laws as these Heb.
8.10, 11
into our inward parts; Should we Psalm 30 4
give thanks at the remembrance of his Holiness, and not second Jewish rites
with Christian Festivals; the Sabbath celebrating the Creation, with our Lords
day celebrating the Redemption; their Tabernacle, Temple and Synagogues, with
our Churches set apart for divine worship, we should deny our gracious and
merciful Lord the tribute of Romans 12.1 1 Cor. 14.20, 37 Heb. 8.11 Esaias 35.8, 10
our reasonable service.

Object. Unto a public worship we assent, but not unto set-forms. Dub.


Answ. 1. Divine Worship without set-forms will scarcely deserve the name of a
public worship, so soon will it 1 Cor. 14.26 Romans 14.19 Phil. 2.4
crumble into private sects and factions.

Answ. 3. Examine and you will find, Unto that Congregation which joyneth with
him in prayer, the extemporary prayer of the best gifted Minister upon the
whole earth, is a Yea, what are those Psalms, Hymns, and spiritual Songs,
wherein we should Ephesians. 5.19. speak unto our selves, but professedly set-forms?
set form.

Answ. 3. Such as condemn set-forms, do not consider, that, unto a heart intent
upon spiritual desires, it is one and the same thing to shape, cloth, and word
those As for God, he, Psalm 139.2, 4. knows our thougets beforehand, Matthew.
6.8
spiritual desires in the foreknown phrase of a Liturgy; and in the new found
phrase of an extemporary petition. In all his providence, the mighty God Acts
15.18
applies his eternal Decree unto new workings: in like manner, devout souls
do, in the use of Liturgies Romans 12.11, 12 1 Pet. 4.7 Col. 4.2 1 Cor. 14.15
Acts 1.14 Romans 15.6
apply set and prepared forms unto fresh and new ejaculations.

Answ. 4. That thine heart may not be hasty to utter any thing before the
dreadful God; be not Eccl. 5.1, 2
rash with thy mouth; that thou may not be rash with thy mouth, let thy
words be few; and, since few they must be, find out Eccl. 12.10 Romans 12.1
acceptable words, even words of truth; and such thou will find in the Liturgy
of our English Church. Take with you words, Hos. 14.2
says Hosea.

Answ. 5. I have seen, indeed a cool Discourse Printed 1662. but (...).
of, or rather against the Imposition of Liturgies; but, while it seems to
plead for the glory of the Spirit in Gospel Times, unto me it seems to Romans
16.17, 18 14.19
undermine the glory of the Gospel, and of the Spirit too: for, First,
Lamentable, and So late as our last civil Wars.
late experience evinceth, that, in Gospel Worship, a 1 Cor. 14. v. 26.
compared with v. 1. and with c. 13.1.
want of Uniformity disturbeth Gospel-peace: and we must needs know that a want
of peace with the Gospel, eclipseth the 1 Cor. 12. v. 25. compared with v. 31.
See Hammond upon Revel. 19 6, 7, 8, 9
glory of the Gospel. Secondly, That, in these last days, God pours out more
of his Spirit then he did then, when [taking them by their armes] he Hos. 11.3
taught Ephraim to go, is a truth: Acts 2.17
unquestionable: Nevertheless, a lesser measure of Gods Spirit in the days of
Templeworship, was 2 Chion. 6 41 compared with Psalm 132.8 and with Number. 10.35,
36, etc. 6.24, 25, 26, 27. and with both the Psalms of degrees, and the Titles
of diverse other Psalms.
no reason at all of the set forms therein used: For under the Law, if not Psa.
106.30 1 Samuel 2.27 2 Kings 4.22
their Priests, (sure I am) their Prophets were endued with the holy Spirit in
a greater measure, then since the Apostles days, ordinarily any of us
Christians are: Wherefore, if the duty and ability of Gospel Ministers be a
sufficient bar against set forms under the Gospel; then had the duty and
ability of Genesis 20.2 compared with 1 Samuel 12 23 and with 1 Chronicles 25.1
all their Prophets, and of some of their Priests been a greater bar against
the imposition of Psalms, and of See Mr. John Gregory upon 2 Samuel 1.13
other set forms in their Temple-worship. Thirdly, Whether Primitive Churches
did, or did not make use of Liturgies; we of this Age and Kingdom have seen
what will again quickly befall us, if we do not all of us persist to Phil. 3.16
walk by the same Rule, to mind the same things, yea, and 1 Cor. 1.10
to speak the same things too.


I conclude: While those 1 Cor. 12.28 compare 1 Timothy 3.1 with Ephesians. 4.8, 11, 12
helps, and governments which the good hand of Matthew. 28.20 Romans 13.1
our God places Compare Romans 13.1, 2, 5, and Heb. 13.17. with Deuteronomy. 17.8-12
over us, have, in a form of wholesome words, taught us how to pray, in so
doing, they have imitated no worse an example then that of Saint John the
Baptist, yea Luke 11.1, 2, and John Gregory upon Matthew. 6.13
then that of Jesus Christ himself: and Christ (ye know) is as the Head of his
Church, so the Mouth and Wisdom of his Father.

Hitherto of glorifying God more remotely with our words: properly, and more
immediately we glorify our God with our words, when we sacrifice unto him the
calves of our lips; and then we Hos. 14.2
sacrifice unto him the calves of our lips; 1. When we render thanks for the
(...) est gratum se declarare accepto beneficio, illad agnoscendo, and authorem
ejus praedicaudo. Nam in hoc differt gratulatio religiosa a gratutatiobus
civilibus. In bisce solemus fortaam vel industriam, vel prudentiam illorum
belebrare quibus bonum aliquod magaum obtisse laetamar: at gratulat ^^a (...)
aliud sunt quam simplices gratiarum actiones, quibus celebrant benigaitatem Dei
Patris qui doaavit hominibus bona spiritualia. Davenantius in Coloss. 1.3.
great benefits which we have received at his hands. 2. When we set forth his
most worthy praise: for, praise is the reflection of that which is
praiseworthy. 3. When we tell of the Honor due unto his Name; for honor is
more then praise: praise commends what is good, honor esteems what we
commend. 4. When we bless him as exalted above all blessings: for blessing is
more then honor. Honor admireth that God whom we praise, blessing adoreth
that God whom we admire. Men bless men by their mutual prayers; God blesses
man imperatively, he blesses when he makes blessed; Man blesses God
optatively; then man blesses God, when he rejoices to know and make known how
blessed a God God is. Thanksgiving may be a forced act of mere justice; Praise
verbal complement; Honor the result of a generous mind; but blessing includes
these and more: Blessing includes an unfeigned thankfulness, a serious
praising, a respectiful honoring, and a reverend acknowledgement. Praise may
be matter of complement; Blessing is matter of devotion: ye that fear the Lord,
bless ye the Lord.


But secondly, not ye who fear not the Lord. In works.
He that is one of Psalm 15.1, 2
this Quire, must be clothed in white; for, Thanksgiving consists more in
good works then in good words: Betwixt works and words the Genesis 18.14 (...)
holy language puts no difference at all; Thou, until thou depart from
iniquity, have 2 Timothy 2.19
no right at all to name the Name of Jesus Christ; So long as thou hate
instruction, what have thou to do to Psalm 50.16, 17
take his Covenant in thy mouth? Though thou say Jer. 5.2
the Lord lives, surely thou swearest falsely. Quest. Wherein? Answ. (It is a
disparagement to be well spoken of by an unworthy person;) if thou live not
unto him, little will the world believe, that thy God is a living God, As
praise is Psalm 33.1
comely for the upright, so Pro. 17.7 (...) Nullus fatuus timet peccatum.
excellent speech becomes not a fool. The wicked man's gift has Job 14.4 Psalm
5.9 Heb. 11.6 Gen 27.22
a touch of his Master; and, if the Lungs be corrupt, the breath will certainly
displease. If thou would have thy voice the voice of Jacob, let not thy
hands be the hands of Esau: before thou lift them up unto Gods glorious
Majesty, lift them up unto Psalm. 63.4 119.48
his Commandments first; The pure God has an Jer. 8.6
ear for thy works, and an eye for thy Esaias 59.15, 16
words. Awake up my glory, awake Psalm. 57.8
Psaltery and Harp: Beloved, then when David makes good Music, he moves his
hands as well as his lips. Ah, with what James 3.10
face can an unrighteous wretch speak good of the most righteous Lord? or, a
cursed unbeliever of the blessed God? Know, that man whom the Lord sets
apart, for himself, is Psalm 4.3
the godly man: Would thou, that salvation should be showed unto thee? see,
that thou orderest thy conversation aright; He, and only be, who offers this
sort of praise Psalm 50.23
glorifieth God.

Thirdly, In heart.
until thou keep thy heart Pro. 4 23 first, (...).
with all diligence; True, he that does righteousness, is righteous even as
he 1 John 3 7 3 John 11.
is righteous; but (lo) such a Righteousness must be the work of the
sanctifying Spirt upon thine inward parts. Then will David sing and give praise
when his heart is Psalm. 57.7
prepared and fixed. The God of Psalm. 109.1
thy praise is a God, not of the dead, but Luke 20.38
of the living; He is not for Heb. 6.1
dead works; He accepts of no duty which is not Heb. 11.6
the fruit of faith; and of no faith which is not the Romans 8.9
fruit of the Spirit. The carcasses of good works take not at all Esaias 1.11-19
with God: Therefore, whenever thou would honor him with thy lips, or in
thy deeds, let not then thy Esaias 29.13
heart be far from him. They must be well affected that glorify the Esaias 1.19

God, in the strength of his Spirit, and through the righteousness of his Son,
with Deuteronomy. 28.47
joyfulnesse and gladness of heart, thou do then glorify God. Thus, thus,
O Christian, let us, let us daily give thanks unto that God, who Psalm. 68.19
daily loadeth us with his Benefits! Psalm. 148.13
let us daily praise that God, whose Name alone is Psalm. 104.1
excellent over all the world! let us daily honor that God, who is [33]
clothed with Majesty and Honor! and let us daily, daily let us bless that
God, whom the Angels in heaven joy and delight to Psalm. 103.20 Revel 5.11 15.2
reverence and adore! Thus, yea thus, O Christian, let us, now and ever,
glorify our God, thy God and mine; He that is Our God, is the Psalm 68.20
God of salvation! Who is so great a God as is Psalm 77.13
Our God? Let the Lord, in whose hand is our breath, and whose are Dan. 5.23
all our ways, let the Psalm 70.4
Lord be glorified. Bless the Lord all ye his works, in all places of his
Dominion; Psalm 103.22
bless thou the Lord, O my soul.

How the Lord must be by us glorified, why. Wherefore God must be by us
glorified.

Beloved, To produce many Arguments wherefore we should all of us make it the
whole business of our whole lives to glorify this great and dreadful Name,
The Lord our God, were to question, whether we are endued with reason, or no;
To produce none, were, to deny our affections: a few, then.

First, Seeing he, Reason 1.
who is the Father of us all, is a God, the only God; Why may he not be, by us,
glorified? Might all men, From no reason to the contrary.
and, with them, all Angels, evil and good, lay all their forces together, they
could not, if they would, produce one piece of an argument why the Lord our God
may not be by us glorified. Seriously, then, let this be our first motive:
Therefore, therefore let us glorify our God, because there is Esaias 41.21
no reason in the world to the contrary.

A second reason, Reason 2.
why the Father of all things must be by us glotified, From creatures void of
reason.
I deduce from all creatures void of reason. Reason is entrusted, not with
them, but with us; neither can they, but by us Sola prosecto actio Deum in hac
vita glorificandi gloriosa nobis esse poterat corona, qua meritum nostrum
cumulatissime remuneratum esse credere possemus. Citharistae, citharizaadi
pretium a rege exigenti, sertur respondisse Rex, satis amplum retulisse,
citharizaido; Anius respoaderi potest laudanti Deum, meritum lau. dandi, sola
laudatione, satis superque remuneratum. Mendeza in 1 Samuel 2.30.
speak the praises of their Creator. They are the leaves, the blossoms, the
fruit which prepare a sweetness; we alone are those Bees which ought to
collect the honey. Large Volumns they are, and very learned in the ineffable
Name of the Great JEHOVAH; but, as every other Volumn, so, this Book of the
Creature is serviceable, not unto it self, but unto us; a very fair Edition it
is, an Edition published for the Authors immediate glory; but this glory the
Author expects, not from the Book, but from the Reader; if from so
incomparable a Work as this is, we, for whose sake alone it is published, will
derive no glory unto the Author; the incensed Author will burn, first the
Reader, then the Book. I say, the Sense, Life, Motion, and being of every
Creature whatsoever, are only the materials of Gods praise and glory; the
praise and glory, which God deserves from them, he demands from us; for it,
not they, but, we are accomptable; it is a fearful sin to defraud God of that
which ever was, is (1) and will be his own; we betray our trust, if by us God
be not glorified.

Let profane wretches know, that, the next time, that, the Lord prepares

good? Hear, O Heavens, give ear, O earth; the Lord, he Jer. 23.24 Acts 17.27

entitled Providence, viz. his Church. mihi, p. 109.

Only to man thou have made known thy ways,
And put the pen alone into his hand,
And made him Secretary of thy praise.
Beasts fain would sing, birds ditty to their notes;
Trees would be tuning on their native Lute
To thy renown: but, all their hands and throats
Are brought to Man, while they are lame, and mute.
Man is the worlds high Priest: he should present
The sacrifice for all: while They below,
Unto the service, mutter an assent,
Such as springs use that fall, and winds that blow
He, that to praise and laud thee does refrain,
Does not refrain unto himself alone,
But robs a thousand who would praise thee fain;
And does commit a world of sin in one.
God is Esaias 28.29

pleads for himself) has he not a power to forbear working? Verily he has.

preparation for the welcome of a friend, and for that friend, when come, to
overlook all as altogether inconsiderable; Such neglects were, as uncivil, as
ungrateful; as absurd, as uncivil! How much more, if these neglects proceed,
not from a superior, but from an equal; not from some of our equals, but from

is the same, infinitely the same, and more Omnia omnibus clament se Deum habere

between us and our God.

Man's heart is 1 Cor. 3.19
foolish at the best; but such as Ephesians. 4 18
affect ignorance, shall have even their foolish heart Romans 1.21
darkened; their imaginations shall become vain, and their affections vile;
knowledge is Pro. 14.6
easy unto him that understandeeth; therefore, most equal it is, that Matthew.
14.12 25.29 Mark 4.25 Luke 8.18
from him that has no mind to know God, as God is revealed in his Works,
should be taken away that little benefit of the Scripture which he might have.
So nearly are we concerned in Acts 17.24, 27
all which is before us, that Epb. 2.12
whosoever live without God in the world, do for their part annihilate the whole
Creation at once; nay, what is worse, they do render Tit. 1.15
heaven and earth hurtful unto themselves, and themselves Romans 14.23
offensive unto their Preserver; By God men live, and Acts 17.28
live in the world; yet, so Esaias 1.13
great is their stupidity, they live in the world without God! The world, which
should Romans 2.4 Acts 17.30
lead us toward him, draws such from him; It should be our conduct, they make
it their Hos. 2.12 Romans 1.23
seducement it should be our Remembrancer, they make it their Detainer; Through
a childish mis-usage Jer. 8.7
the same Spectacles which should help their eyes, hinder their sight; By the
things which are made is Romans 1.20
clearly seen the eternal power of the Godhead; clearly seen it may be, but is
not looked after; nay, some there are, who Jer. 8.5 9.6
wilfully look from it.

I cannot marvail to see so many persons given over unto a reprobate mind, since
so few among us like to Romans 1.24, 28
retain God in our knowledge; Judge in your selves, He that is unfaithful in a
little, would he be Luke 6.11, 12, 31 1 John 4.20 John 5.47
faithful in much? He that will not contemplate God as a Creator, will he flee
to him as unto a Redeemer? seek to him, as unto a Preserver? lean upon him, as
on a Comforter? If I have showed unto you earthly things and ye believe not,
how shall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly things? says Luke 3.12
Christ. Friends, if the wide world, and all that therein is, be not sufficient
to put us Romans 1.20 10 18
continually in mind of our God, what is? nay, what can be? To this purpose,
there is 1 Timothy 4.4, 5
no creature to be refused; For this purpose, every creature of God is good, if
it be received with thanksgiving; and with thanksgiving it would be received,
were it sanctified by Gods Word and our prayer. What natural man can 1 Cor.
2.14 Romans 3.12 Quid potest perditus operari? Aug. Euchir. c. 30. Quid tantum de

pretend an ability to discern things spiritual, since he is so far wide from
the scope of things temporal? Verily, if people remember not their Creator when
they find him in the fields; no marvail it is, if they shut their eyes when
they should see him in the Sanctuary; If they regard not the operations of Gods
hands, neither would they regard the operation of his Spirit. Be astonished, O
Inhabitants of the earth, and stand amazed at your ingratitude; your liberal
and bountiful God, flingeth away a whole world upon a sort of persons who
vouchsafe to him not 2 Cor. 3.5 Non dicit perfectum, sed ne aliquid. Aug.
one good thought! The only Recompense which he expects for all his works,
is, man's Psalm 50.15
acknowledgement; this small-pepper-corn cannot God procure. The Lord would
Psalm 8.6 115.16 1 Cor. 3.22 Job 41.11
most willingly afford us the benefit of every Creature which he has; the
profit of his whole Creation he frankly bestows among us; he desires no more
from us then the praise of his workmanship, and of this we rob him; Time was
when Adam Genesis 2.20
gave names unto all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of
the field; but, man is silent now; these Creatures may be uncreated for any
name that God can get from Adam! The Apostles complaint Ephesians. 4.18
of heathens, [O that I could drown this complaint with my tears] must now
bewail Christians, because while they Romans 1.21
know God, they glorisie him not as God, neither are thankful.

But, Beloved, I hope better things of you: When you, with Gen 24.63
Isaac, walk forth, you will walk forth to meditate; When you with David Psalm
8.3.95.4, 5.
behold the Moon, and the Stars, you will consider them as the easy work of
Gods little finger: Unto the altar of your heart you will, with the Psalmist,
Psalm 148.8, 9, 10 65.6-13 96.11, 12
summon fire and hail, snow and vapors, storms and winds, hills and Valleys,
fowl and fish, beasts and creeping things purposely that you may sacrifice them
with the voice of Thanksgiving. Since Matthew. 13 11
unto you it is given to understand that the wisdom, the power, and the
goodness of your God is always presented unto you in every creature, the Esaias
66.18 65.1, 2 40.26 41.20
mind of your Creator you will not neglect. Things void of life, and living
things void of reason, you Psalm 103.22
will not leave at a loss, for want of your voice, of your speech, and of your
reason, to mention their Founders worth: As every creature recommendeth the
love of your God unto you, so you will Psalm 119.91 1 Chro. 16.35
consecrate every creature unto his pleasure and praise; So well stringed, so
well tuned an Instrument, as this Psalm 136.5 104.24
harmonious world is, should never silence the praises of your God, so long as
you have either voice, or hands, or heart; but, as it is your part and duty, so
you will make it your care and delight, that 1 Cor. 15.28 10.31 Prove. 3.6 Col.
3.17
in all these things, your God be by you glorified.

My third reason [ why God should be glorified, Reason 3. From creatures
reasonable, but graceless.
glorified by us, always glorfied by us] is drawn from Creatures reasonable
and intelligent, but void of grace.

I am glad when I read verse the eleventh of Revelations, chapter 5th. For, when I
call to mind how hard a matter it is, to hear of eight Genesis 9.25 1 Pet. 3.20
religious persons in the days of Noah, and, in aftertimes, to hearken out a
faithful Abram in Genesis 11.31
Vr of the Chaldees, a righteous Lot in Genesis 13.12
the Plains of Jordan; one Joseph in Genesis 39.9
the Land of Egypt; or, one Job in Job 1.1

sparrow upon the housetop; and find Elijah 1 Kings 19 9
hiding himself in a Cave, I am very 1 Kings 19 10
jealous for the Lord of Hosts and of glory: When I see of the habitable places
of the earth, so small a part Christian! of Christendom, so great a part
idolatrous! Of the reformed Churches, so few which receive a love of the truth!

Friends; Rivers of tears run down mine eyes, while I perceive so gracious a God
to be so universally disregarded!

I say the truth in Christ, I lie not; my conscience also bearing me witness
in the Holy Ghost; that, I have great heaviness, and continual sorrow in my
heart; for my Brethren, my Kinsmen according unto the flesh, the Inhabitants of
this Isle. O England, What shall I take to witness for thee? Did ever Nation
receive so great deliverances, as, not by might nor by power, but by HIS
Spirit, the great GOD has wrought for us, in restoring unto us our King as at
first, and our Judges as of old? Can WE choose but Jer. 33.9
fear and tremble for all the goodness, and for all the prosperity which the
LORD has procured unto us? Wherefore do we 1 Samuel 2.29
kick at his free goodness, and cast his loving kindnesses behind our backs?
Us only has God chosen Amos 3.2
above all the Churches under Heaven to be unto him a Jer. 13.11
Name, and a glory; and, do we thus Deuteronomy. 32.6, 7, 8, 9
requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? Is not he thy Father that has
bought thee? has he not made thee and established thee? Remember the days of
old, consider the years of many generations: If one man sin against another,
the Judge shall judge him; but, if a people sin, and thus sin against the Lord,
1 Samuel 2.25
who shall entreat for it? The breaches betwixt us and our God are so wide,
that, it will be Ezekiel 13.5 22.30 Jer. 5.1 Numb. 32.23 Ezekiel. 3.26
very difficult to make up this hedge; were Noah, Daniel, Job, and Moses alive
among us, they would be insufficient to stand in these gaps. When Israel came
out of Egypt, rather, When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, then
were they like unto them that Psalm 126.1
were in a dream; we, although the Lord has done greater things for us, are in
no such dream, in a Romans 11.8

excess, and fallen asleep in deadly sins! May God ever have the glory of it,

it not in Gath) our iniquity is greater, neither has Samaria committed half of
our sins: By Hos. 4.2
swearing, lying, stealing, adulteries, oppressions, drunkenness, profaneness,
and covetousness we break forth; shall we say now, that we are Jer. 7.10
delivered to do all these abominations? God forbid. After peace we follow, and
we do well; but we Heb. 12.14
follow not after holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord; We have

we a desire to goodness, we should wish for another cruse of thy white salt, O

because they know him not, John 17.25

excuse, could they pretend that the scepter of God Psalm 45.6
is no right scepter; but, they themselves fully know, how there abides in God
eternally and infinitely a right to reign, a wisdom to govern, a justice to
distribute, a truth to perform, a majesty to overawe, a power to protect, a
mercy to relieve, a goodness to merit, a bounty to reward, a loving-kindnesse

Husband, a dearer Bridegroom, a more absolute Friend, no heart can wish, no
person can have, seek, or fancy; a better God we cannot desire then this whom
we enjoy; neither can we, without vexation and anguish of spirit, take notice
how the foolishness of the world reproacheth this God. Legions of malicious
spirits in hell blaspheme him, and innumerable multitudes of men here upon
earth willingly adhere unto the rebellions of Satan: but, for this God who
bought them they have no obedience! For these things we justly weep, these
reproaches so generally cast upon our God, force us to mourn in secret: in
secret, said I? Have we then an ability to keep our countenances unchanged? Is
the prey taken from God Almighty? Are men led captive at Satan's pleasure? Is
the King of glory deserted as if he were a Tyrant? Do men all the day long run
away from our God, and do not We 2 Pet. 2.7, 8 Psalm 69.9 119.53, 136, 158 Pbil

go mourning all the day long? Have we any voice other then the voice of doves
tabring upon their breasts? We find not rebellion by secret search, but, almost
in every bosom. Not one of a thousand has his heart upright toward our God!
Beloved, these, these evils are goades in our sides, thorns in our eyes;
swords they are, ever piercing our ever bleeding hearts; alas, our God, our
glorious God, is, both at home and abroad, dishonored! our holy, our dear God
is everywhere lightly regarded! Therefore, upon what are our thoughts diverted?
How is it, that while we walk the streets, we are able to bite in our
lamentations? Where, where is our zeal? where are our compassions? the
swoonings of our bowels? and the loving thankfulness, the loving kindnesses
due from our souls to our God? Do we breath any other breath, but sighs? Can
we perpetually sigh without perpetual groanings within our selves? Our constant
affections toward the sanctifying Spirit may constantly melt us into tears,
while we see daily, daily see the most of men, the most of men by far,
grieving, quenching, resisting, rejecting that powerful and blessed Spirit!
Speak, ye servants of the most holy Lord God, speak, [if for weeping ye can
speak] is the Name of our God hourly profaned, everywhere profaned, and can
we look one another in the face with dry eyes? are we not weeping-ripe? are not
our eyes brimeful? do they not gush out with tears? rather, do not our very
heart strings burst? If so, the more sinful, the more rebellious, the more
heedlesse, the more graceless most persons are, the more industrously in our
lives, in our words and in our purest thoughts? let Quod ego modo cum magno

our God be, by us few, glorified.

Fourthly, Reason 4. From grace assisting.
Therefore God must be by us glorified, because, if Christ's Disciples we be, we
have the benefit, not only of reason, but of grace.

As unreasonable creatures want understanding to know there is a God; so
unregenerate creatures want grace to glorify that God whom they know; a
rational power over all which is before them, they may, and Romans 2.8
must exercise; a spiritual, they should, but cannot: As ever they would See
William Fenner his Wilful Impenitency. Mr. Baxters his Call to the
Unconverted; his Now or Never, etc.
obtain that glory which shall hereafter be revealed; as ever they would work
out their salvation, as ever they would escape condemnation, as ever they would
quiet the barking of their guilty consciences; as ever they would entitle God
unto a protection of what they possess, nay, (since the fewer their offenses,
the Mat. 16.27 Luke 12.47, 48
fewer their torments) as ever they would mitigate the severity of eternal
wrath, let the vilest unbelievers see to it, that, they do ever make the best
use which possibly they can of that little understanding they have. David, even
then when he himself was Psalm 109.4

for grace; therefore is his whole life (but) a series of hypocrisy and of
gilded sins: So unreasonable is such a one, that, he is too Psalm. 10.4 Homo

sacrifices, is no more then the cutting off of a dogs neck; and his rejoycings
are much like the shoutings of them who Exodus 32.18
compared their glory unto a molten calfe; Thus, all the honor which God
purchases from the heart refusing grace, is only like unto that drudging work
which just Masters Quod faciunt contra voluntat^m Dei, non impletur nisi

of dangerous poisons. In a word, without faith it is impossible to please God;
for, whatsoever is not of faith, is sin; viz. notoriously short of that
reasonable service which the pure God may justly expect from every person,
since every person has reason enough to thirst after the holy Spirit of Christ
Jesus. Sirs, from those that do, or may, understand, that such a Spirit is to
be sought, but seek it not, all the honor which the Lord procures, is Romans
2.8 Job 21.30 Jude 15. Prove. 16.4 Romans 9.22 Just as the Artist turn^th the

as forced, as that which through his transcendent power and wisdom, he

same) out of Adams disobedience; out of sin, as sin; and out of Devils, as
Devils: Wherefore, the Lord persuade you to pant after the holy Spirit, that
you may with simplicity of mind, endeavor to glorify your God.

Object. To pant after the holy Spirit of the holy God, is a work of
Regeneration; and we are no more able to regenerate our selves, then to beget
our own substance in our mothers womb.

Answ. To regenerate our selves, in our power it is not: we are merely passive
in our spiritual, as well as in our natural birth: It is tho Ut letum Deo
detur, h^minis voluntatem boaa^ and praeparat adjuvandam, and adjuvat
praeparatam. Aug.

observance, and the more thanks is due from us unto that Father of Lights, who
is of his own will, so ready to beget us with his word of truth, that we should
be, any of us, regenerated by his Spirit.

Object. Though the word preached be spiritual, we are Romans 7
carnal and sold under sin; we are natural, and 1 Cor. 2
savor not the things of God.

Answ. Naturally Rat^o communionum opinionum consilii coelestis incapax, hoc
solum putat in natura rerum esse quod aut intra se intelligit, aut praestare
possit ex sese, Hillar. de Trin. lib. 1.
we savor not the things that are of God; but this we may do; a natural man
may be strength of reason, so much as in him lies, with humility and
earnestness, endeavor to know and taste of God, as God is now manifested in
his works, and Word: He may with Plangendae tenebrae in quibus me mea facultas
latet. Aug. confess. l. 10. cap. 32.
the greatest of diligence he can, observe and do the Will of God unto him in
the holy Scriptures revealed; As One most unworthy of so great a Treasure, he
may, in a constant use of holy Ordinances, wait for the Luke 24.49
spirit of Promise; moving causes, for which the Spirit of grace is vouchsafed,
these are not; Antecedent duties, in which this Spirit is vouchsafed, they are;
I say, upon these waters of knowledge the Spirit delights to move. Would a
lost sinner patiently wait, in the use of these appointed means, should he
never receive the Holy Ghost; yet still he had done what in him lay, he had
submitted unto Christ's Scepter, he had glorified his God to his power, he had
made the best of a lost condition: But, the Scripture offers more grace: He
that is faithful in a little natural abilities, shall be entrusted with Luke
119.17, 16 16.10
gifts above nature: True, See Manto^ upon James 2.4
confound nature with grace, we may not; sinful man may not justle the holy
God; may not reckon himself a co-adjutor, in that, wherein God will have the Sea Bishop Reynolds Joy in the Lord, in quarto, mihi page 24. Videatur etiam,

sole glory: Mean while as we desire, with all possible humility to
acknowledge, that the holy Spirit of the great God is infinitely a free Agent;
free as the wind which blows where it lists; so, we are bound, with all
possible gratitude to confess, that this free Spirit has tied himself up Deus
promitteado se facit debitorem.
unto the truth of his Promises; wherefore, we dare not but expect to Esaias 64.5
meet God in those ways, wherein his free goodness has appointed us to find
him. Says one, Mr. Tillian a Dately of Banbury, in his New Birth, cap. 9.
mihi, p. 103.
God has appointed certain things to be done by men, which, they that will not
refuse to do, may do; and the which they that shall do, shall be Regenerate:
For [saith ibid. Nevertheless, Paedissequa, noa praevia, volantas, says St.
Aug. Epist. 106.
he] There is a common work of Illumination which so makes way for
Regeneration, that it puts into man a power of doing that, which when he
shall do, the Spirit of God shall mightily work within him; provided always,
that he damp not the present motions of the Word and Spirit of God with
procrastinations and delays. It is much-what in Regeneration by the Spirit, as
it is in generation of the flesh; the fruit of Sarahs womb is expressly the gift
of God, but, there was first a generation before a conception; As to expect the
fruit of the womb without generation, so to expect the Regenerating Spirit
without the use of means, were to tempt, nay, to contradict, and to control
the wise God.

Object. The wind blows where it lists.

Answ. Most true it is, that the blessed Spirit sanctifies John 3.8
them whom, and them alone whom, he lists to sanctify; but, as true it is,
that whosoever Gal. 6.8
sows to this Spirit, shall of this Spirit reap life everlasting.

Object. He that will sow to the Spirit, must think a good thought; but, it is
not in us of our selves 2 Cor. 3.5
to think a good thought.

Answ. Neither is it of our selves, that we Acts 17.28
live, move, and have a being: Our self-insufficiency is so far from being
Phil. 2.12, 13
a bar against Duty, that it should excite us unto the use of all means
possible: The more we want breath, the more we gasp for it: I opened my mouth
and panted, for, I Psalm 119.131 When Anaxarchus the Philosopher told the
Treasurer, the gist which he expected from Alexander, was no less then an

me aright; he understands that I am both able and willing to give him [Luke
11.13] so great a gist. Plutarch Apotheg.
longed for thy Commandments: Therefore work out your salvation with fear and
trembling, because, he who works in you to will and to do, is God; Therefore
be renewed in the spirit of your mind, Therefore be ye filled with the Spirit,
because God is he which pours forth of his Spirit upon all flesh; God is he,
and he alone, that must put his Spirit in our inward parts: When unto what we
should do alone, the Master himself puts a helping hand, we the servants,
are the more sober, the more circumspect, the more diliget, yea, and the more
confident too; for, if our Master himself begin once to help us, without doubt,
he would have his work well performed, and perfectly finished: Be of good
cheer, arise, he Mar. 10.49.
calls thee.

Object. If he begins! But, Does he, or will he begin?

Answ. He both does, and will, if thou Acts 5.32
wilt not resist: Know, where God freely vouchsafes the ministration of his
Gospel, there Acts 11.18 28.28 2 Cor. 3.8, 9 Velle and currere meum est; sed
ipsum meum sine Dei auxilio non erit meum. Hieron. Tom. 2. Ep. 197.
the ministration of his Gospel is, unto them who obey it, the ministration of
the Spirit.

Object. To obey, is also a gist of the Spirit.

Answ. Until the Spirit first furnishes thee with a sanctified will, and with
a sanctified obedience, he 2 Cor. 8.12
accepts what thou have [even thy hearty will, and real desire;] If thou, in
the simplicity of thy soul stretchest forth the uttermost of thine
understanding and of thine affections after things spiritual, God will Nos

mercifully interpret this a spiritual mindedness, he will not quench this
smoking flax: Reason tells thee, it is as well thy wisdom, as thy duty to
prefer Gods ways, Gods will, and Gods glory, before thine own ways, will and
glory; Does thy heart assent unto this evident truth? If so, I doubt not but
God will sanctify thee by his truth: He that will do the will of his God,
shall John 7.17
know it; and he that coveteth Gods Spirit for Gods sake, shall Esaias 44.3
have what he coveteth.

Beloved, Of free grace it is that Acts 10.45 2 Pet. 1.3
God causes his Gospel to shine among us; of free grace it is, that now while
it shines, we rereive from it any light of knowledge at all; of free grace it
is, that any lght of knowledge raises in any of us any good desires; Habem^s
nos aliqud Dei; sed ab ipso; non a nobis, sed ex gratia ipsius, non ex nostia
propr^etate. Tertul. c^ntr. Hermog.
of free grace it is, if in us, and from us, proceeds any thought, word, or
deed that good is; but then, so abundant is this free grace of his, that, if we
resist not, his free Spirit will succor, strengthen, stablish us in a firm
resolution and practice of glorifying our Lord God. 2 Cor. 4.6


I pronounce therefore, [ and what I pronounce, I vehemently believe to be
true, viz.] that, who so, through Trahitur miris modis ut velit ab illo qui

a desire of the quickening Spirit, applies himself unto prayer, unto the word
preached, unto new obedience, etc. and does [in a diligent use of these, and of
the like Gospel-Ordinances] patiently wait the Lords leisure, in Gods time [and
Gods time is best] he shall obtain the [so long desired] spirit of grace, and
this, as unquestionably, as the spirit of Truth has both offered and promised
this Spirit. Consider, Friends, as faith comes by hearing, so, if Rev. 13.9
any man will, he may hear; By such unlimited invitations, the Father, who sent
Christ, draws us John 6.44.

comes unto us, he stands at the door of our consciences, at the door of our
understandings, at the door of our affections, he stands patiently, and
knocks importunately; he is as glad to hear our voice, as we are to hear his;
if we enlarge our hearts unto him, if we open the door unto him, though a King
of glory Psalm 24.7, 9

fraternity; whatsoever he does, he does it for the praise and glory of his
Father; we cannot please him more, then, when we through his mediation, make
use of his Spirit to glorify our God.

Object. If the holy Spirit may be so easily had, if Jesus Christ be so forward
to seize and seal us; then, may flesh and blood Thus the urgodly, Psalm 36.2
slat re^h herself in his own eye, until his inequity be f^^d to be hateful.
borrow a little more freedom: Some piety and some pleasure, some godliness
and some worldliness, may, the one help out the other; Though we go on in our
practices a while longer, we will be so wise unto salvation, that before death
surprise us, we will settle our selves, once for all, to repent, believe, obey,
live strictly, etc.

God expects glory from man, and man seeks to glorify God?

Answ. Seeing vain man is so selfish, that, though he is not Non nobis so'u^

should not be instrumental unto the service of the chosen of God, there is
indeed implanted in him an affectation of glory; The numerous and excellent
Writings of all heathen and many Christian Authors, the invention and
improvement of Arts and Sciences, yea the most famous Works throughout the
world, may, most of them, be ascribed unto the vain glory of their performers.
But we may See also pages 280, 281, 282, 284; and there N. 5.
conceive no such unworthy thoughts of the infinite God; as there is in him no
defect, so there can be in him no affectation: The great God wills that we
should glorify him, partly in regard of us, partly in regard of himself.

1. In regard of us.
God infinitely delights to communicate good, gives us occasion to glorify
him, that thereby He Himself may take occasion,

First, to relieve Psalm 50.15
our necessities: Many charitable Christians fall to building, planting,
mounding, and sim. for no other cause, but, that they may relieve the needy in
finding work for them: just so, the liberal God Esaias 32.8
devises libera^^ things.

Secondly, to Vere magnum est habere fragilitatem hominis, securitatem Dei.
Seneca.
instruct us: That Children may learn from whom they receive their maintenance,
Parents, before they furnish them with moneys, first, suffer them to write
their wants; and, that his Disciples might know who brought fish to their Net,
Jesus made Them Luke 5.5, 2
cast their Net into the Sea.

Thirdly, To render us profitable unto our own souls: thus, we educate our
Children to better, not us, but them: thus, we place windows in our
mansion-houses to give light, not unto the day, but unto our dwellings: and
thus, God sets eyes in our heads to enlighten, not the Sun, but our selves:
Of what use are all those things which we see, unto the eyes of a blind person?
so, of what profit is the whole world? nay, of what profit are the excellencies
of Him who made the whole world, unto that ignorant wretch who sees not how to
glorify God as God?

Fourthly, To Fidelibus totus mundus divitiarum est.
reward us: Thus Potentates find especial employments for those favorites whom
they resolve to advance.

Fifthly, To endear us: Thus gracious Kings to endear their people, draw not
their Chariot-curtains, but suffer their subjects to have a full view of their
Majesty and Persons. O my Beloved, The 2 Cor. 4.6
face af Jesus Christ may endear us all; and the Psalm 89.15 In eundem hominem
non puto convenire gaudium and silentium. Pacatus in Paneg.
light of Gods countenance may inflame us all, to mention his praises!

Sixthly, To delight us: A Child is highly pleased, if you suffer him to feed
himself with the Nurses spoon; To a man a very great satisfaction it is to view
a house of his own good contrivance, to taste fruit of his own planting, etc.
Now God, who both does all for us, and can do all without us, therefore
glorifieth himself in our duties, that we may be unto our selves the
instruments of our own comforts: Oh, what a delight must it necessarily be unto
a Christian, to have a hand in fulfilling the good pleasure of his Redeemer?
and to be an Uben Alexander saw his Father Philip conquer enemies so fast, he
complained that his Father would leave him no work to do; For, said he, what
will it comfort me that I possess the whole world, if I have no world to
conquer with mine own bands? Plutarch Apolog.
instrument, although a weak instrument, of glorifying the great God?

Seventhly, To encourage us: Little Infants able neither to speak plain, nor to
go high alone, are See page 266. of this Treatise. Vix dici potest quanto
l^bentius imitemur cos quibus favemus. Fab. Instit. lib. 2 cap. 2.
ambitious to be sent upon their Parents errands, and to do for them petty
services: Prohibit them from busying themselves, and you dull them; you animate
them, if you find them business. Oh, what an encouragement is this, that,
such Ephesians. 5.1
infants as we are, may be allowed to walk with the Father of Lights! Be we
holy, be we perfect, as our heavenly Father is holy and perfect.

Eighthly, To honor us: It is a most unspeakable honor unto the lost sons of
Adam, that any of them may be at any time Malim ego cum Christo ruere, quam cum
Caesare stare. Lutherus. Theodosius imperator Ecclesiae membrum esse magis quam
in terris regnare gaud^ bat. Aug. de civitate Dei. lib 5. c. 26.
admitted to observe, obey, worship, praise, bless and glorify the most
incomprehensible Lord God! The meanest Office imaginable about his sacred
Majesty's person, is therefore honorable, because it relates unte a King:
They are Bishops and Nobles who stand before our Prince; and we are Priests and
Kings, if we attend our God.

Lastly, To make us ever mindful of our own felicity: Many subjects are happy
in their Sovereigns, but will not If the Peloponenses undervalued Philip, of
whom they had received favors: (...); Plat.
know it. We, the Children of this generation, we whem the Lord has sorted out
to be the prosperous subjects of so gracious a Prince, and of so virtuous a
Princess, break forth with the Psalm. 144.15
Psalmist, Happy are the people which are in such a case: and yet the more some
Pliny the second shall set forth unto us the praises of Our Charles the second,
the more we his subjects shall perceive how exceeding happy we are: When we set
Psalm. 100.4
forth the praises of our God, we do not add unto the goodness of God, but we
add unto our selves a further Psalm. 9.10
knowledge of Gods goodness: Had Cromwell known, he would not have been the
death of King Charles the first; Had the Jews 1 Cor. 2.8 Jer. 13.11 9.24
known, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory: Did sinners Simul ut
desinunt ignorare, cessont and odisse. Tertul. Apoleg cap. 1.
understand what praise the eternal God deserves, they would no longer be
disobedient unto so gracious a God: Were God set Psalm 48 11 22.3
forth unto us in the praises due unto his Name, we should the less need to be
called upon to glorify him as God. Worship him 1Psalm. 95.6 135.3
all ye people; would we fancy unto our selves a Micah 6 3 1 Chro. 16.10, 31
God after our own hearts desires, were there other Gods beside the only true
God, we could not choose (if any were to be chosen) we could not (if we would)
desire to be protected by a Psalm 148.13, 14 149.9 Romans 1.7 Revel. 15.3 Psalm
145 per totum. Esaias 62.5 63.7 26.3, 4, 12 Jer. 17.12, 13, 14 Deuteronomy. 10.20, 21
more easy, a more indulgent, a mor gracious, a more glorious, a more lovely,
a more absolute God, then is this God whom we serve in the spirit; we can never
enough set forth his glory, we can never enough glory in his protection and
government, we can never Nam cum Deus amat, non aliud vult quam amari. Bern.
Sermon. 88. in Cant.
sufficiently glorify our Lord and King, our King and our God!

2. In regard of Himself.
God has all the reason in the world to require man to glorify his most
blessed Name: for

First, Although from the first minute of Adams fall unto this very instant, we
cannot bring unto God the tribute from us due; nevertheless, it is most just
with God to demand Homo cum sis, id fac semper memineris; Si me arguat Deus,
non redarguitur a me, sed ex me potius just ficabitur. bid.
from us that perfection of praise, which while our first Father stood, we were
enabled to surrender.

Secondly, Seeing then when Adam was found guilty of Treason, the Lord Romans 2.14
seized not upon the whole forfeiture, but left in us remainders of conscience,
of memory, of understanding and of good affections; most equal it is, that
whatsoever he leaves with us, should be, (...). Clem. Alex. Strom. l. 7.
not at our, but at his sole pleasure and command.

Thirdly, God has vouchsafed unto us the blessings of the earth, and of the
heavens; the precious truths of his Word, the rich graces of his Spirit, and
those unsearchable Treasures given unto us his only Son, upon Qui esse vult
fibi, and non tibi, O Deus, incipit nihil esse int^r omnia. Ber. in Cant. Sermon.
20.
no other terms, but that in them and for them his Name should be by us
glorified.

Fourthly, What wise man ever built a house for True, the Tree which cumbreth
the ground, shall be burnt; but the Lord diggeth, etc. about it, that it may
bring forth fruit, Luke 13.8, 9.
no purpose at all? Who planteth a Vineyard, and eats not of the fruit? Who
feeds a flock, and drinks not of the milk? If God be a Lord, where is his
fear? If a Father, where is his honor? etc.

Lastly, Let a Soldier do what becomes a Soldier; and let a Sovereign do as
beseems the Majesty of a Prince: When, upon Darius his large offers, Parmenio
had said, Surely I would accept these offers, were I as Alexander; said
Alexander, Plut. Apothegm.
so would I were I as Parmenio. Beloved, as God ways are not the same with our
ways, so neither are his thoughts as our thoughts: It When Harpalus would have
had his Kinsmans evil words escape unpunished: No, said Philip, for, (...).
Plutarch. ibid.
consists neither with the justice, nor with the wisdom, nor with any other
attribute of God, to dispense with the glory ever due unto his Name: Take the
whole at once, Should the infinite God cease to see himself glorified, he would
un-God himself.

Think upon it Sinners: Ought Jehovah to be glorified as he is absolutely, a
God? as he is relatively, a Lord? and, dare any of you continue a Vessel of
dishonor? Be ye not as things without life, but as living Creatures; be not as
bruits, but as creatures reasonable and well affected; Be not as they unto whom
no Gospel is preached, but as Gospel-professors; O let not the Gospel of Jesus
Christ be hid unto you; but, let it be unto you the ministration of the Spirit.
The Lord has made his only Son a powerful Istam gratiam non habuit homo
primus, qua vellet nuaqua^ esse malus; sed saae habuit, in qua si permanere
vellet, nunquam malus esset. Sed deseruit and desertus; Haec prima est gratia
quae data est primo Adam. Sed haec potentior est in secundo Adam; Prima fit, ut
habe at Homo justitiam si velit; Secunda fit criam ut velit, and tantum velit,
tantoque ardore diligat, ut carnis voluntatem contraria concupiscentem
voluntate spiritus vincat. Aug. de corrept. and great. cap. 11. and 12.
Mediator; he has shed forth the Spirit of his Son; he has prepared
Ordinances to conveigh, has given both an understanding to seek, and
affections to yern after this Spirit of his Son; and, after all these mercies
are even forced upon you, are you as barren, and as unfruitful as ever? Be not,
O be not the thwarting, the cross-grained matter of Gods severe glory; but, be
the pliant instruments of his deserved honor! not only be, but seek his praise.

Object. What if we are already predestined to be Vessels of dishonor? Then
--

Answ. 1. If you come too near Deu. 29.29
unto the inaccessible Light, I say, if you stare the Sun in the face, ye do
but dazzle your eyes: Be Nunquam verecundiores esse debemus quam cum de Deo
agitur. Seneca not. quest. l. 7.
sober.

Answ. 2. Were you assured that you are Vessels fitted for destruction, this
assurance would but Mat. 6.34 John 14.1
torment you before the time.

Answ. 3. Suppose you are See of this Treatise, pages 76, 77, 78, 79, 80.
unavoidably the Vessels of dishonor, yet make the best of a forlorn estate:
dishonor, neglect, provoke Quis coram Deo innocens invenitur, qui vult fieri
quod vetatur, si subtrahas quod timetur?
the just Judge as little as you can; saved or not saved, your Duty is to obey.

Answ. 4. Should all endeavors fail, you can but perish.

Answ. 5. If you will pluck eternal destruction upon your souls and bodies,
thank your selves: As for the most merciful Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
his Gospel is brought home unto you: He proclaims a Dignaris eis quibus omnia
debita dimittis, etiam promissionibus tuis debitorem fieri. Aug. Conf. l. 5
pardon; and that general pardon is now particularly tendered unto you, I say,
unto you.

Answ. 6. Although your day be Matthew. 20.9 Luke 23.43
already far spent; if the Lord will, you may redeem the time; God assisting,
you may run, and so run, that you may Cesset voluntas propria, non erit
insernus. Bernard.
obtain.

Answ. 7. Obtain, or obtain not; forasmuch as the long-suffering God has
prolonged his patience toward you: Do not any longer abuse his patience:
dishonor him Consi^ium futuri, ex praeterito, venit. Seneca Epist. 83.
henceforward as little as Fructuarius nihil facere debet in perniciem
proprietatis. l. 13. sect. 4. F. de usu fructu.
you can; nay, henceforward glorify him as much as you can.

Answ. 8. One way of glorifying your God, is, to Au laciam existimo de bono
divini praecepti disputare. Tertul de poenit. cap. 4. Prior est authoritas
imperantis quam utilitas servientis. Idem.
leave him unto the pre-eminence of his secret counsel: Servants may not pry
into their Masters mind, nor Children into their Fathers will; nor Subjects
into the unsearchble hearts of Princes: It is your wisdom to submit, trust,
and obey.

Answ. 9. His you are unto whom you obey: if you harden your hearts, ye do the
work of a Reprobate; That is, of a Devil; see 1 John 3.8. for, Alterius esse
non possunt nisi Diaboli, quae Dei non sunt. Tert. de Idol. cap. 18.
if you seek to glorify your God, you take a course to Phil. 2.12
work out your salvation, nay, to make your calling and election sure. 2 Pet.
1.10


Answ. 10. Many that have sought to work out their salvation, God has
rejected: For why? They sought themselves, not their Ruler; but, unto him who
unfeignedly sought to glorify his God, as God, God never yet denied his Spirit
of Regeneration. This is a Gospel Truth; God who Modo mirabili and ineffabili
agens. Aug. de praedest. sanct. cap. 20.
does sometimes most freely give of his Spirit unto such as once despised
grace: will never Patrem miserico diarum, esse necesse est etiam Patrem
misirorum. Bernard. Se m. 1. in fest. omnium Sanct.
withhold grace from them who implore his Spirit.

Object. But, do not some who seek Jesus, dye John 8.21
in their sins?

Answ. Yes: very Matthew. 20.16
many: For why? They seek to be saved not Matthew. 1.21
from their sins, but from Hell; They would separate sanctification from
justification; They would partake of mercy, but not Heo 12.14 Vere Christianus
est qui plus amat Dominam quam trmet peccatum. S. Bernardus. Ille autem peccare
metuit, qui peccatum ipsum, sicut gehennas odit.
of Holiness; Flourish under the Crown they would, but would not submit unto
the Scepter; They love Jesus, but not Christ; Would they seek as well Christ as
Jesus; Would they seek him to be as well their Captain as their Salvation; as
well their Governor as their Savior; as well their Wisdom as their
Redemption; as well their Death as their Resurrection, they should not then dye
in their sins: Bradford somewhere says, that The Gospel is a new Doctrine to
the old man; if the old man will, without more hurt then good to himself
receive it, he must become new that he may receive it: If we would seek Christ's
Kingdom, we must also seek the righteousness thereof; If we would have his
Kingdom come, we must let his will be done: If we would be under grace, sin
must not have dominion over us.

Object. They must dye in their sins, if they be Ephesians. 2.3, 2, 1, 4
children of wrath.

Answ. The Psalm 14 7 11 Nihil tam dignum Deo, quam salus homin^s. Tertul.
Lord takes pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.
Such as are by nature children of wrath, cease so to be, if they cease to be
children of disobedience.

Object. Whom he will, God Romans 9.18
hardens.

Answ. True, God withholdeth the Amos 4.7 Deum scire nemo potest, nisi Deo
docente; sine Deo, non cognoscitur Deus. Ireaeus lib. 4. cap. 14.
means of grace from what Kingdom, City, Parish, or Person he pleases: Where
means of grace is offered, there he likewise hardens such hearts as,
Pharaoh-like, refuse to submit; he hardens such as, like the Jews, affect to
be ignorant; such as bend the strength of their understanding and affections
against his revealed pleasure, them he hardens; for, although God vouchsafes
to elect and call us without our wills, sanctisie and save us against our wills
he Illud nescio quomodo dicuur feastra Deum miscreri nisi nos velimus: Si enim
Deus miseretur, etiom volumus; ad eandem quippe misericordiam pertinet, ut
velimus. S. Aug. ad Simplician, lib. 1. qu. 2.
will not.

Object. Who then shall be sanctified?

Answ. They whose affections God Deus sumit ex se matertem, and velut quoddam
seminarium miserendi -- miserendi causam and originem sumit ex proprio. S.
Bernard. Sermon. 5. in not. Dom.
subdueth, and whose heart he Hec gratia quae occulte humanis cordibus, divina
largitate tributtur, a nul'o duro cord respuitur; ideo quippe tribuitur, ut
cordis duritia primitus auferatur. S. Aug. de praedest. Sanct. cap. 8. A Deo
disce^dum est, quid de Deo intelligendum est, quia non, nisi se authore
cognoscuur. Hillar. de Trin. lib. 5.
opens: If hitherto God has neither subdued thine affections, nor opened
thine understanding, do not forthwith give thy self over unto a reprobate mind,
but, give diligence to be found of God, ar and in his Ordinances: Be sure to be
in readiness at the Pool of Bethesda against the good Angel in my Text moves
upon those waters of knowledge; If thou would be a Temple for the Holy
Ghost, wait thou at the gates of his Temple: and, if it be the work of a God,
to command thy stubborn heart, surrender thou thy stubborn heart, that God may
command it, Phil. 2.12, 13.

Object. Deuteronomy. 29.4.

Answ. From v. 3. Had they followed God Number. 14 24
fully, as Joshua and Caleb did, God would Deuteronomy. 5.29
have given them a heart.

Object. John 6.44.

Answ. True: For except the Father had Mat. 3.17 17.5
revealed how well he was pleased with the Son of man, none Esaias 53.2 compare
Luke 24.21. with Romans 1.4
would ever have come unto the Son of man, as unto a 1 John 2.1
Mediator.

Object. John 3.5.

Answ. Therefore let not Nicodemus trust unto that which is born of the flesh;
but, let him thirst after the Spirit.

Object. Esau have I Rom 9.13
hated.

Answ. While Esau was yet unborn, God foreknew that the promised seed should
descend from the loins, not of Esau, but of Jacob.

Object. Not of works: but Romans 9.11
of him that calls.

Answ. True; for He 1 John 4.19
loves us first: First, we must be known of God, before we Gal. 4.9
can know God.

Object. Who has then Romans 9.19 See of this Treatise from page 76. forward.
resisted his will?

Answ. He who mighe have known God, but would not.

Object. It is not Romans 9.16
of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.

Answ. True; for it is the Lords mercy if we Phil. 3.13
either will, or run.

Object. Why say you then, that God never withheld grace from them that seek
grace.

Answ. Because, seek and you Matthew. 7.7
shall find.

Object. May then, any one that seeks grace, receive Christ?

Answ. Yes, Who so Revel. 22.17
Will.

Object. But can any one?

Answ. No; None but John 1.12
such as believe in his Name.

Object. Can any that will believe?

Answ. Any to whom it is Phil. 1.29
given.

Object. How if it be not given to believe?

Answ. They unto whom it is not given to believe, must, as I told you, believe,
First, that John 15.6. Privatio generat appetitnm. 2 Cor. 3.5 Ephesians. 2.9
of themselves they can do nothing; Secondly, that Jam. 1.17
From the Father of Lights comes every good and perfect gift; Thirdly, that
this Father of Lights has appointed ways and means whereby Heb. 11.6
this gift of faith may be obtained; Fourthly, that a Acts 17.30 John 6.29 Esaias

Lastly, that in the use of the means appointed, he shall not Isa. 45.19

seek Gods face in vain.

Object. Where then lies the Controversy?

Answ. In man's pronesse to Romans 9.20 We are like him in Seneca; Dic aliquid, ut
simus duo.
dispute against God: Sirs, Truth John 8.32
would free us from extremes, would we receive a love of the truth: For
instance, Them that are without the pales of the Church God 1 Cor. 5.13
judges; therefore, What have we to do, to 1 Cor. 5.12
judge them that are without? Next, since we of this Kindom are a people near

If the Lord will that John should tarry in the flesh, until Jesus John 21.21,
22
come in his fury against Jerusalem, what has Cephas to do with that? Let
Peter follow Jesus, and leave John unto his Masters pleasure. Thitdly, The good
Angel in my Text would quickly roll away the stone, would we cease to interpose
our thoughts Esaias 55.8, 9
against Gods thoughts: Had the woman of Samaria known the John 4.10

Sir, give me of this water that I thirst not: On the other side, While Naaman
is wroth 2 Kings 5.10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Omnis fessinatio caecaest. Seneca de
Renefic. l. 3. c. 3. Lukc 16.15
to see his opinion crossed, he continues as leprous as ever: The Question was
not, whether had been the better manners in homebred Elisha to send his
messenger, or to come out himself unto Prince Naaman; Nor whether was a more
probable course [like our Princes which heal the Kings Evil] to move the hand
over the place affected, or merely to wash it with cold water; no, nor yet what
was most seemly in a Prophet, whether to send a stranger unto an unheard of
practice, or to stand and call upon the name of the Lord his God; no, nor
whether were to be preferred Abana and Pharpar, or the Rivers of Israel; nor
lastly, whether the waters of Jordan were cleansing waters; No, The state of
the question was, Whether 1 Cor. 1.20, 25, 27, 28, 29 How br^^ish and below our
thoughts is the manner of man's generation? and yet God is pleased from that
brutishness of humane nature, to raise unto himself his own Image, even, a
nature exalted above the nature of Angels. Water in Baptism how common an
element? Bread and Wine are ordinary food; and yet by these God vouchsaseth to
convey his Spirit! ^rby? Answ. The more inconsiderable the means of any mercy
or grace, the more plainly God is seen to be the Author of that mercy and
grace. 1 Cor. 3.7
Jordan could cleanse from the Leprosy then when the Lord said, Wash in
Jordan, and Jordan shall cleanse. Just so, The Question is not, whether a
natural man can discern the things of God; for we are all of us born
spiritually blind; no nor yet whether the Lords Christ can give sight unto the
blind; for, unto God all things are possible; but, whether clay and spittle,
even earthen Vessels may not then help men to their sight, when Christ so
ordains: Sure I am, in every Ordinance of His, the power of his Luke 5.17
Spirit is ready to heal. A leprosy we all bring with us into the world; and
let Gehazi, reprobate as he is, account upon it, that he shall dye leprous;
but, if Christ bid a man show himself unto the Priest, though that man were a
Samaritane, I would not Luke 17.16
question his recovery. Except a man be born ugain, drawn of God, endued with
Christ's Spirit, etc. there can be no entering into the Kingdom of Heaven; It is
confessedly true: And of this truth both the Jews were frequently
animadvertized, and the Gentiles thoroughly informed; and herein great was the
loving kindness of God unto both Jew and Gentile; but, Christian, in the mean
space, what signifies the ministry of the Gospel? Is not the ministration of
the Gospel the 2 Cor. 3.8
administration of the Spirit? Verily it is. Unto them who are without 2 Cor.
4.3
the pales of the Church our Gospel is hid; unto them within hid it need not
be; It is, I say, the savor of death unto death 2 Cor. 2.16
only unto such as choose death rather then life.

Object. Without me ye John 15.5
can do nothing.

Answ. By God thou Acts. 17.28
movest; Tell me, is that a pretense for thee that thou can not stir? Rather
(as I have already answered) it is Phil. 2.13
an argument that thou may stir, if thou will. That which thou sowest, thou
sowest not 1 Cor. 15.37

makes our obedience the measure of his heavenly gifts; the same God which
makes our mortal life, the beginning of life everlasting; the same God, which
uses the blood in our veins to conveigh animal spirits; the same God, which
frames the body for the benefit of the soul; the same God, blessed for ever,
makes use of our natural senses, while he infuseth into us spiritual graces:

Object. But certainly, it is non in man's power to come unto Christ.

Answ. Where Matthew. 11.28. compared with Mat. 14.27, 28
Christ calls, there is hope given that he will John 6.37
give a power; Samuel knew not the Lord at the first and second calls, but
before he could take any rest, he was 1 Samuel 3.5, 10
made to know the Lord.

Object. But assuredly, God has his Romans 9.22
Vessels of wrath.

Answ. He has so: namely, the Romans 9.21
Vessels unto dishonor.

Object. And them he fitteth unto destruction.

Answ. Not so: They See here page 56. forwards. Hos. 13.9
fit themselves for destruction. The Vessels of mercy are prepared unto glory
by God; but the Vessels of wrath draw their own destruction upon themselves.

namely, If he 2 Timothy 2.21

Object. Can a man purge himself?

Answ. Because I have purged thee, and thou wast Ezekiel. 24.13

therefore, ever prepared unto every good work, because ever empty of it self,
and ever cleansed by the Spirit. Then, when Gods will meets with a carnal

flesh and blood, yea, against principalities and powers wrestle we may; but,
little is our victory, because little is our faith, that is, little do we seek

earnestly thirst after the sanctifying Spirit, purposely, that he may be
enabled to glorify his God, as God.

least part of divine worship: If we hear, we hear for our selves, we Esaias 55.3

that Matthew. 7.7 1 John 5.15
we may have: Whereas a chief part of our public Service, is the same with
the chief part of Gods Worship, which is, not merely to hear Gods most holy
Word, but, in hearing, to obey it: and, not so much to pray for more benefits,
as to give thanks for the benefits which we have already received from Gods
hands: For, pure and undefiled Religion before God even the Father, is this, to
seek him more for his own sake, then Esaias 26.8 Non mih^ sussicit quod semel

we have received at his hands, to set forth his most worthy praise, and to

full purpose of heart seeks the glory of this God, does not give a Throne, a
Scepter, a Crown unto the Lord; for his, of right they ever were, and are; but,
this favor that Believer has, he has the honor [if I may so speak] to Psalm

extol that Throne which is the Lords, to hand the Scepter of Gods Kingdom unto
Gods right Hand, and to lift a Crown of pure gold unto the Royal Head of this
King of glory: Then we extol God, when we in our hearts and lives praise and
adore him; And in this sense, the solemn Coronation of our God, is like
Himself, everlasting; he that has the honor to be one of those who magnifieth
God, has this happiness, that he is said to extol God, he glorifieth, he
crowns his God; and this is the Non tam mea sunt, quae mea sunt, quam quae

anticipate life to come. Then is our conversation, like that in heaven; when we
be ever rejoicing in the Lord, ever mentioning the loving kindness of our God.
Verily, we then seem to sit in heavenly places, among Saints and Angels; when,
in the midst of the congregation, we set forth, the praises of our God in
Psalms, in Hymns, and in spiritual Songs. Christians, if ye know what it is to
glorify your God, you will roll away that stone, against which some have
stumbled. It will be unto you no trouble of heart, if, as you believe in God,
and believe in Christ, so, you [through Jesus Christ] celebrate Psalm. 29.9
the name of your God publicly, and solemnly in your Fathers House: Know,
Brethren, if we glorify God here upon earth, They in heaven, can do no more;
The most which They can do, is, [though after a more heavenly manner] to
glorify Our God: We do what the Saints in Psalm. 149.9 Neque ad loquendum digne

as the blessed Spirit does, we do as the Son of the Father does, yea, we do as
the Father himself does, if we glorify our God.
Seeing it is unto us so great a glory, to glorify this God; Seeing it is unto
us heaven upon earth; seeing it is unto us, Life more abundant, to laud,
praise, and bless the Name of our God; I beseech you, Friends, Let us no more
absent our selves from the Liturgy of our Church; but, let the Lord God have
the glory of our open, public, and solemn Thanksgivings: Yea, let us watch
always over our conversations, words and hearts, that at Psalm 34.1 71.6, 8,

Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Solomon, etc. He is glorified in such Scriptures

SIR,

Life more abundant in her looks you see:
Picture her Soul; a Heavenly Saint is She!


Sir, I willingly promise my self this blessing; because it farreth with those
good Christians who bury their Friends, as it does with us Ministers when we
are crucified with Christ: Espy us in the Town, you see us in black, mourning
for the sinfulness of the World; but, meet us in the Temple, you find us in
white, rejoicing at the purity of the Gospel; just so, when good Christians
have buried their dead, if their thoughts reach no further then this World,
well may they cloth themselves in mourning; but let their thoughts follow
their dead unto their Fathers House, and then their grief and sorrows are
swallowed up in Joy and Rejoycings.

From my Study, April. 3d. 1662.

COnsider this dear and worthy Gentlewoman, first, as She was a part of this
world; next, as She was a Member of the Church; and thirdly, as She is present
with the Lord within the mansions in her Fathers House; In every of these you
will see plentiful matter laid before you, for the praises of Our God.

First, In the things of this Life.
It is the glory of our God, that, while he Psalm 17.14.
gives unto the wicked their portion only in this life; He is also in the
things of this life, sometimes bountiful, as well unto the Matthew. 5.45
just, as unto the unjust; thus, he was unto Genesis 13.2, 6
Abraham, and thus he was unto this Gal. 3.7
Daughter of Abraham.

From the Cradle which first danced at the voice of her cries, unto the grave
which now bewaileth her silence; little, very little cause there was why Her
heart should be troubled. For instance;

The more loyal our affections be toward our most gracious Sovereign Lord the
King, the more honor we have for that Sex which gave conception and birth
unto his sacred Majesty's sacred Person. Adam, he Genesis 3.20
calls his wives name Evah: Why? Answ. Because she was the Grandmother of
Christ, in whom all are made alive. Beloved, Let not the community of a
Blessing bury that Blessing in oblivion; The Friend of whom we now speak, was a
Daughter in Israel, to wit, One of that Sex, which had, both the Happiness,
and the Honor, to bring the Great Redeemer of all mankind into the World.

As for her lineage I am no Herald: yet, this I can say, as by wedlock, she
matched into a For she was married unto Michael Rutter of Burton on the Hill,

long descent; so She her Self was no Filia terrae: It is of God, that while
one Family is low and obscure, another is superior and exalted; This
Gentlewoman was of the later, and superior sort; She was the branch, the
offspring of a very Generous Stock; I shall utter more then in other words I
can so well express, if I tell you she was a Of which Family, see Dugdals
Surveigh of Warwicksh.
HALES, a HALES no way overreached by any specious pretenses of hypocritical
Rebels.

Whereas the honesty of some great Ones is rugged, and the seed of their
goodness unformed, for want of an early education, it was not so with this
Friend; she was highly civilized: Indeed, Her education was, as well became Her
Eminent birth, very singular; [Furthermore] it was as successeful-as exquisite.

Her wealth was suitable unto her birth: The blessing of the Lord made her
rich, and he added no sorrow with it.

Her body, that body which now sleeps in Jesus, was, herein a picture of her
soul, upright and graceful.

In the natural endowments of her mind, she surpassed many of her equals: She
had a tenacious memory, an elegant fancy; a piercing judgment, and a deep
understanding.

Her acquired parts were no less remarkable: She read much, and much unto her
benefit: witness her language always apposite; witness her habitual
transcendent elocution; and, from that again, the law of kindness which was
ever in her lips, together with that charity, and that piety which so often
perfumed her familiar Discourse.

Although she could not be born, but, she must be Job 14.1
born to know sorrow, surely, goodness and mercy followed her all the days of
her life: Even, in all his Dispensations toward her, so favorable unto her,
were the providence of her God, that, most usually, her sorrows and mourning
were recompensed with joy and gladness.

True: She knew the loss of Children; but, she never Esaias 47.8
sat as a Widow: Bury some Kindred she did, bury some Kindred [if she her self
would live] she must; but, the God of our life, which removed from her some
Friends, exalted other of her Kindred, as surviving blessings.

instead of her Parents has given unto her (...). Eurip. in Oreste.

She lived to see the captivity During our late Wars.
of our Zion; but, as Moses from Mount Nebo did before his death, behold the
promised Canaan; so, neither did she depart this life, until having, with Heb.
2.1
the Prophet, watched to see what the Lord would say, She did, with Psalm. 85.8
the Psalmist, hear him speak peace unto his people, and to his Saints. As she
prayed for the peace of our Jerusalem, so she saw her prayers answered; She
left not this transitory world, until she had first seen that Deliverance which
the great God has most mercifully, and most miraculously brought unto us, his
most unworthy people.

Hitherto, you have chiefly seen what praises we owe unto the divine Majesty,
in the behalf of this dear Friend for common mercies; Beloved, although the
bountiful God scatters these blessings of his left hand, as well upon the
evil, as upon the good; yet, when these worldly favors are placed in, and
imparted unto an elect Vessel, they then begin to be spiritual Blessings.
Wherefore, as God has had the glory of his Benefits unto this singular Friend
of ours in the things of this life; so, bless we the Name of the Lord for that
large portion of true Riches which she received in things appertaining unto a
better life.

Concerning things appertaining unto the Gospel.
God was very gracious unto this singular Gentlewoman, for she was exceeding
happy in (...).
prudent and religious Parents: By them, not out of custom, but, out of a
religious choice, she was consecrated in Baptism unto their God; By them she
was brought up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord: By them she was
trained up in the way she should walk in, which way of holiness she kept unto
the end.

Hence it was, that she was so great a lover of good Books, of good Scias ipsum
plurimis virtutibus abundare, qui alienas sic amat. Plin. lib. 1. Ep. 17.
men, of Lords days, of holy Festivals, and of holy Ordinances:

But, over and above these outward privileges of the Gospel, as she walked
uprightly, so, the Lord God Her Sun and Shield, had Psalm 84.11
vouchsafed unto her his free grace. I say, over and above these outward
privileges, she had that one blessing which makes all the rest such; for, the
holy God withheld not from her his holy, his blessed Spirit. The most merciful
and most gracious Father of Lights did, by his good Spirit, lead her in the way
that she should walk in: He guided her obedient soul by His Counsel, and has
now received her unto his glory. That is the last,

In the life of Glory.
Of this, what shall I report? Might her blessed soul descend hither unto us,
She would now tell us things, which cannot be by me uttered. What Our eyes have
not seen, what Our ears have not heard, what our hearts cannot conceive, that
would Her glorified Soul reveal unto us: We [I trust] shall go to Her: She [you
know] shall not come to us: only This, This is our Comfort, that, As Solomon
removed the Ark from the Tabernacle unto the Temple, so, the Son of David, even
the person speaking in my Text, He has translated the soul of this Saint from
her earthly Tabernacle unto the mansions in his Fathers house; For this also,
it is our Duty to give much thanks unto our God.

Quest. But, how shall we best express this our thankfulness?

Answ. By endeavoring, as she endeavored, after a sanctified enjoyment of
every of Gods blessings.

This Gentlewoman, whose whole life was a continued thankfulness unto the God
of her mercies, may be unto us both a Motive unto religious thanksgivings, and
an Example.

A Motive; for, (...).
that this righteous Gentlewoman shall be had in everlasting remembrance,
assuring us, that the praise of a Gospel-Conversation endures for ever.

An Example, because she could, and did show us Her faith by Her works, viz.

She made the Blessings of this World serviceable unto the blessings of the
Gospel; and, When at any time troubles arose in her heart, she believed in God,
she believed also in Christ.

The greatest part of her Conversation, I say, the greatest part of it, was,
not only a Practice, but a Pattern of Piety.

Look upon her self-denyals.

She was as I told you, very well descended; But, did any of you ever hear her
boasting her Ancesters?

She had Wealth at will; but, Did she make it an occasion unto pride? With
plenty she possessed the right, the humble, the spiritual enjoyment of plenty.

Others make it their business to be, not Christian, but vainly Gentile: but
she, instead of drowning a Christian in a Gentlewoman, taught Gentility to
adorn Christianity.

Others are more for the broidering of the hair, then for the Ornament of a
meek Spirit; Was she so?

Others are more for the pride of life, then for the beauty of holiness: Was
she so?

She was none of that sort of Gentry, which, like S. Chrysostomes Schoolmaster
When Liban us, who had tought Chrysostom in Philo^o by, was asked, who should
succeed him in teaching? Libanius answered, No one but Chrysostom had not the
Christians won him to them. Platina in vita Zosomi.
repute Christ's Ministers therefore contemptible because Christ's Ministers.

She was very well educated; but, was she more a Courtier then a Saint? Could
any profane Esau keep her by her Chimney-side, then, when health allowed her
to attend Gods Ordinances in Gods House?

She had good elocution: But, was guile found in her mouth? I speak this to her
praise, She detested hypocrisy in another much, in her self more.

On the other side: She was a lover of good persons, because Ut de pictore, aut
de sculptore nisi artisex judicare [non possit;] ita, nisi sapiens, non possit
perspiccre sapientem. Plin. lib. 1. Ep. 10.
good.

Not long since viz. October. 15. 1660.
my very good Lady The Lady Ann Overbury, late widow of Sir Giles Overbury,
Knight.
went comfortably from her own house, unto the mansions in her Fathers House;
Friends, You never heard this Gentlewoman mention that Lady, but, that Ladies
name was ever solemnly attended with a long train of this Gentlewomans just and
real Commendations: Vita est mansio animae in corper^.


As she never spoke evil of the absent, so she never interpreted the praise of
another to be a diminution unto her self.

One thing I ever observed in this Gentlewoman, which I can by no means
conceal: She was an absolute Governesse of her passions: The empty fallacies of
mirth Res severa est verum gandium. Seneca.
deluded not Her soul: Ever cheerful she was, but still sober, still modest.
She was that person, whose passion never, no not in her most retired
familiarity, dissolved into any excess.

No jollities could make Her frolique.

She had so wonderful a command over her lively Spirit, that, her moderation
could not but be known unto all that knew Her manner of living.

Free from exceptiousnesse she was: in truth, Her virtues had no weaknesses to
be jealous of: Small cause had she to suspect the whispers, or fear the
mis-reports of others, being conscious unto her self of nothing, except of
comeliness and integrity.

You could not provoke her unto revenge: A discerning spirit she had, could see
a neglect as well as another; She could see it, but would not see it: Or, if
too too palpable it was, she was so far from being overcome of evil, that, she
would most industriosly seek, I had almost said, steal opportunities to
overcome that evil with good.

You have heard some part of her self-denials: But, She was in many other
circumstances, an Egregia virtutis exempla, veluti lumen in edito ponenda sunt
ut omnibus praeluceant; multosque ad sui aemulationem accendant. Erasm. ad
Archiep. Tolet. Augustini operibus praefix. p. ult.
example worthy the imitation of Believers. All along, She was Exemplary.

Exemplary, even from her Infancy: so pliant, so obedient unto her Parents, so
filial she was.

Exemplary in her minority: Other Virgins marry, she was given in marriage: Her
affections followed her judgment, and her judgment was led by her Parents.

Exemplary as a Subject: Loyal even then, when Loyalty was not only a ruin,
but a seeming disgrace.

An exemplary Friend, more then usually that Sex can be: Her fidelity was,
above the fidelity of women firm and judicious: for, although she enjoyed the
soft virtues of a woman, she wanted not the perfections of a man.

Unto Mistresses of families She was exemplary: How peaceable, how discreet,
how bountiful a Mistress she was, The sorrows of her weeping Hand-maidens
will best resolve you. I am not ignorant, that, Sir Tho. Overbury his Wife.
Contiguous business much that Sex befits. But a truth it is, She, in
understanding was masculine; as she never despised Martha for being busied
about many things: so, she was ever accompanying Mary in that better part which
could not be taken from her.

A notable exemplary Mother she was: For, She reformed her Children, not by
reproofs, but by examples: Witness her Daughter Christiana, a Christian.
that, hitherto miracle of Children. Other Parents suffer their Children to be
the Trouble of their Parents, and the shame of themselves; but, this Parent was
so discreet, that, Her severities were pleasantness, and her smiles,
corrections.

As a Wife, she was exceeding exemplary: like The Beloved in the Cant. 5.16
Canticles, not a Wife, but a Spouse; not a Spouse, but a Friend. Her love was
even, saving that it was daily increasing: Her privacies were, not fondness,
but dearnesse: Such her conjugal Society, that the longer she lived, the more
she was a Bride, a discreet one though! If ever Wife was a Help meet for her
husband, This was she!

She gave very great examples of liberality and bountifulness: There is that
Pro. 11.24
scatters, and yet increases: She was such a one. Her liberal soul was made
fat, and liberal things she devised. She was not alone in this Duty; but, in
this Duty very exemplary she was. No Coin was so good sterling with Her, as
that which testified her bountifulness: Verily, she was eminently generous:
and gave so great encouragements unto the ministry of the Gospel, that, of her
quality I have not known her second. Far from vain glory she was, but most
singularly munificent.

She did so heartily imitate the goodness of our The Lady Hester Overbury, the
virtuous wife of Sr. Thomas Overbury, Knight.
present Lady; that, her pious Charity was no whit inferior unto her
[specified] generous liberality. It is the blessing of these Of Burton on the
Hill, and Morton in the Marsh. of Gloucestor shire.
Villages, that God has brought among us Christians very eminent for casting
their bread upon many waters; Ladies ready to distribute, Ladies ever lending
unto the Lord: Such a one was this Gentlewoman: Under God I can attribute the
lives of some Widows in this Parish, unto that sustenance and relief which
they received from this Gentlewoman: in the mean space, Her right hand knew not
what her left hand did.

Very pitiful, very tenderhearted, very full of compassion she was: She took
it as no small kindness, when at any time I informed her, who among us was in
poverty, or any otherwise distressed. Let me speak it in the audience of this
large Congregation, She professedly took more pleasure in visiting the sick,
the poor, the needy, then in visiting the great, the rich, the prosperous:
Forbear weeping, poor people: Yet [alas] were it not for the The virtuous Lady,
the Lady Hester Overbury, and the
good Lady, and some excellent Gentlewom n, Mrs. Whitlock, Mrs Creswick, etc.
few others amongst us, what would your sick beds do, now, that you have no
Mrs. RUTTER to stand by you? The Lord comfort you: Trust in Him, he will make
your beds in your sicknesses.

As were her fruits, such was her faith: Her heart was therefore exercised with
such charitable practices, because so much exercised unto godliness.

She loved the Gospel in the purity of it: She was an example unto you all in
frequenting the Church: and no marvail, for she frequented the Church as the
House of Her God.

She sat not down in her Pew to read some Historical Scripture, or some private
Book; to talk of vanities, to toss her heels against God, or to sleep in sin,
etc. No, she was truly zealous in her Devotions.

Some sort of friends we have, which are a kind of Trencher-friends, which
visit you more for your Table, then for your Society: In like manner, some sort
of Gospel-professors we have, which [although the chief end of Sermons is, to
fit us, that we may worship our God] come to Church for the food of a Sermom,
not for Inanis potentia, quae non reducitur ad actum.
the worship of their God. No Sermou, no worship with these; except they may
edify their souls by a Sermon, they will not meet here to speak good of Gods
Name, to give thanks for benefits received, to set forth the praises of their
God, and to rejoice in the open, public, and solemn worship of their great and
glorious Lord; I pity such Hos. 7.8
dowbaked, such piecemeal Christians; alas, their own practices witness
against them, that, It is our duty to love our souls; but, it is not our duty
to love our souls more then our God.
they assemble hither more in care of their souls, then in love and duty
toward their God: I say, such are lovers of themselves more then lovers of God.
This Christian, she sought to be edified by Sermons, had a care of her soul,
and yet a reverence, a love for her God: I say, She came hither, not to Psalm
119. v. 161
please her self, but to worship and Psalm. 30.4 31.23 52.9 84.1.42.1, 2. Psalm

Lord: She gave diligence to worship God reverently, to worship God as Her God;
to wit, She ever kept her self ever intent upon every instant Duty, giving
thanks heartily, as unto the Lord; praying fervently; singing cheerfully;
hearing heedfully; I speak this, as having been a constant eyewitness of what
I speak. Verily, I know not that person among you all, which is more instant in
prayer, or more watchful in every kind of Devotion, then constantly, this
Gentlewoman was.

As she rejoiced in the worship of her God, so she delighted to hear the joyful
sound: She attentively hearkened unto Gods Word as well read, as preached; Nor
did she rest here; she sought as well sanctification, as knowledge; even What
was spoken of Origin, may be related of her; Quemadmodum vixit sic dixit;
quemadmodum dixit sic vixit.
sanctification unto obedience; She was none of those who are given unto
pleasure, and dwell carelessly, viz. She kept her heart with all diligence,
endeavoring to adorn her Gospel-profession. You might know the abundance of
her heart from the sweetness of her lips; inasmuch as Her most, and most
familiar converse was principally of the things of God.

Of this, Her sick bed shall be my witness: an evidence beyond expectation; a
testimonial worthy to be recorded! For, at what time her Disease waxed violent;
at what time the violence of her disease grew Mors pio undecunque bona, nec
potest male mori, qui been vixerit. S. Aug. de doct. Christ. cap. 12.
into a distemper; at what time that distemper scattered her thoughts,
intercepted her meditations, and disheveled her speech; even then, then [I say]
her words had a reserve, a taste, a tincture of holiness: I say again, Her
words still savoured of that holy Spirit, wherewith she Christiani sumus, beati

Watchfulness, Immortality, Perfection, Peace, Salvation, Eternity! Faith in
Christ, Righteousness, Hope, Heavenly glory, Joy, Lovingkindnesses! These,
these were the treasures which enriched Her mind, which silvered her Tongue,
which elevated the Air of her notes, and made her voice Musical, I had almost
said Seraphical. Her dying sentences could not be, but her dying words were
like the 2 Samuel 23.1

utterly desert it? How is it, that God, God who Psalm 8.4 Heb. 2.16.
rejects fallen Angels, should have any compassion at all for ever-falling
man? for a crosse-grained offspring of a prodigious Traitor? for a pernicious
brood of viperous Wretches?

Beloved, seeing our first Parents Compare 2 Samuel 12.9, 10. with Genesis 2.16, 17.

lusts after the vilest sins imaginable! We find within our selves Job 4.17,

when all that can be said in our behalf, is fully spoken, all will Romans 3.9,
etc. Lam. 3.12 Heb. 12.29 When Nonius rode in a triumphal Chariot, Catulus saw
cause to say, What a deal of dirt is this Cart filled with! See Genesis 3.22. and

inveterate, malicious guilt! We must be Ephesians. 1.11

the counsel of his own will, before we can obtain an inheritance; Through 1

is made sure and evident unto us; but, it must be 1 Pet. 1.2
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, that we are elected unto

before all worlds: The holy Calling wherewith we are called, is 2 Timothy 1.9

which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began. We differ from other
men, but Romans 3.22

Hell is our portion.

Thus in [our lesser Mapp] Sins microcosm, is found such a world of guilt, such
a world of provocation, such a Genesis 6 5, 6 Romans 3.10,-20 Job 4.17 7.17, 18 9 2
11.11, 12 14, 10 15.14, 16 25.4, 6 34.15
lost world, that, [as he is now encentred in the midst of the Universe,] man
[vain man] justly appears a most inconsiderable spot; less [far lesse] then
the Genesis 32.10
least of thy mercies, O Lord!

Yet [loe] with what a Psalm 32.11
circumference of blessings have thou encircled this vile Malefactor? this most
unworthy wretch, a wretch so Prove. 8.36
merciless unto himself, so Esaias 17.10 43.22 Jer. 2.32

undeserving sinful-we are [on the left hand, and on the right hand] the larger
the globe Psalm. 84.5
of thine Universe, so much the greater praises, blessings, and thanksgivings
are ever, from us, due unto thy dreadful Name, for all thy mercies.

Whether to Unbelievers, or unto Believers. To Unbelievers whether already
dead, or now living.

To them who died in Unbelief, It is the Lords mercy;
First, How long since soever they were cast into Hell, that into Hell they
were not Romans 9.20, 21 Esaias 64.8 Prove. 16.4
sooner cast.

Secondly, How great soever the measure of their guilt and pain is, that Psalm
145.9 103.10
greater it is not.

Thirdly, That, the utmost measure of their punishment is Jude 11. Matthew. 16.27
deferred until the great and terrible day of the Lord.

Fourthly, That their Carcasses which did sin, and shall suffer with their
souls, are respited from Hell John 5.29 1 These. 4.16
until the general Resurrection.

Fifthly, That both their souls and bodies had obtained everlasting mercies,
had they not Eccl. 7.29 Hos. 13.9 Job 34, 11
fallen from that perfection wherein they were created.

To them who live in a state of Unbelief, It is the Lords mercy,
First, That they are not Lam. 3.22
already hopeless, and helpless in Hell.

Secondly, That the present troubles of their heart are not John 3.18 Gal. 3.10
worthy to be compared unto the severe judgments which they deserve.

Thirdly, That, though they deserve no mercy at all, they have Psalm 17.14
Eccles. 9.1, 2 Matthew. 5.45 Psalm 73.3 -7
so large a portion in this life.

Fourthly, For that the long-suffering and Rev. 2.21 Romans 2.4 1 Pet. 3.19
forbearance and goodness of their God, daily inviteth them to repentance.

As for the persons spoken unto in my Text, they find Matter of thankfulness.
First; For the Kingdom of this World.
First, For their very being: for that, they [were] are any part of the
Universe; Friends, It was, it is the Lords mercy that ever there were such
creatures in the world as were these Disciples in my Text. There is one flesh 1
Cor. 15.39
of men; And that is wonder, if we call to mind how, and against whom Adam
transgressed: Be it, that, rather then lessen the number of his several kinds
of creatures, mankind God will continue; One would think, He would sooner raise
up Children as Mat. 3 9
out of these stones under our feet, then, from out of the loins of our first
Father: These stones never offended God as Adam [once the Genesis 1.27
perfect image of his God!] did. That, the determinate Counsel of God should
before time was, decree his own Image; that, at the beginning of time, he
should say, Genesis 1.26
After our own Image let us make man: that, Having made man after his Image,
God should Psalm. 8.6
put all things under his feet; that, Having put all things under his feet, God
should Genesis 2.17 Nehem. 9.6 Job 7.20 Psalm 36.6
preserve the nature of man, who Genesis 3.17 as 2 Samuel 12.8, 9. and Psalm 50.17
slighted all things! Verily, there is no motive, no ground at all for this;
but merely, the perpetual praise of his great Name!

Next, For their not being in Hell: It is the Lords mercy that these Disciples
[for as much as they also were the Sons of Adam] did not [only] just live to
dye in Hell; that, instead of having their heart troubled in their body, their
soul was not flaming in Tophet! But Romans 9.15
God will have mercy upon whom he will have mercy: Although man unto this day
disregardeth his God; Unto this day, God Psalm 8.4
regards man: Man quickly destroyed himself; God patiently continues Job 7.20
man's Preserver.

Thirdly, For being under no more troubles of heart. You have heard of the
calamity of Job; But, what was Jobs misery, in comparison of those See Deuteronomy.
28.15-68
bitter curses and fearful judgments unto which man's sinful nature is most
justly exposed! Horrible was the anguish of Francis Spira; but, was His anguish
equal unto that of damned souls? The fires which Anno Dom. 1662. December. 26.
consumed de Launes House in Louthbury, London [Oh, how amazing! yet] were not
to be complained of, if we call to mind Hell-flames. Feed a condemned person
with bread of affliction and water of affliction all the years of his life, he
will acknowledge it a favor, that the hour of his execution is deferred; Sirs,
the saddest and most forlorn condition upon earth, is a merciful estate unto
him who deserves everlasting burnings. Deliver me not over unto the will of
mine Psalm. 27.12 Matthew. 13.39.
enemy, O God.

Fourthly, For temporal mercies. Nicanor had as hard thoughts of his Prince, as
natural men have of their God; even and anon, like many unthankful English
Subjects, he would be detracting P^u^arch. Apotheg. ubi supra.
from his Sovereign; This his Sovereign knew, yet, took occasion to relieve his
wants; now that he had received Relief, (...). ib.
Nicanor was never so well, as then, when he was speaking well of this King; at
which the King, See [said he] It is in my power, if I please, to hear or evil
or well. Christians, the Lord does not only deliver us from execution, but,
furnish us with food and raiment: Yea Videas Bellarminum De Ascension^ mentis
in delum per Scalas. A Book so useful that I am translating it into English.
he fr^ely gives us all things appertaining unto life! Oh, set it Psalm. 107.4
be in His power to make us speak well of him. The same Sun which stood still
at the Josh. 10.13
command of Joshua, runs a daily Race to give us light; That Moon which
stood still ^ 14,
over the Valley of Ajalon, night by night attende^h us while we steep: God
calls all Psalm 147.4
the stars by their names, and accompteth them all few enough to do us
service: He has placed us in the very midst of whole multitudes of
blessings. His blessings do crowd upon us, as living creatures did upon Noah at
the door Genesis 7.9
of the Ar^; they throng upon us, as they did upon Adam at his, Genesis 2.19
first creation; they swarm about us like Bees, like Bee^ all honey, and See
Psalm. 118.12
no sting. Solomon did well to write of Herbs from the Hysop to the 1 Kings 4.33
Cedar; We want more Aristotle's, more Plinies, more Philosophers, and more
Secretaries of Nature to number up the good works of our God; With what plenty
of water, woods, grass, Cattle, fish, fowl, etc. does God accomodate diverse
unknown Regions Psalm. 50.10, 11 104.30 Acts 17.26 Job 24.5 38.26, 27
of the World, as if his bounty would prepare a Table in the Wilderness,
against man come thither to inhabit his mercies? We, upon whom the latter as
Jer. 23.20 and Hos 3.5
ends of the world are come, enjoy to our ease, the help, the benefit, the
studies, the arts, the experience, and the labors See Genesis 4.20 Josh. 24.13
Prove. 8.12 Esaias 28 23-29 Exodus 35.30-35
of all ages from the beginning of the Creation unto this more then fi^^
thousandth year of the World! For which of all these common mercies can we
neglect to give especial praises unto our God?

It is usual with persons great and Childlesse, to sttle their Inheritance upon
some adopted Kinsman, that so their Lands may be called after their name; but
See Genesis 21.12, 14
seldom do they give their goods and chattels too unto the same person whom
they make their Heir; these they distribute [as Legacies] unto other of their
Kindred: Beloved, that [we may not want matter for our thanksgivings, the Sea
Genesis 25.5, 6
Father of mercies bestows upon us Romans 8.32
land and goods too! We are unto Christ, not only Heirs, but Executors, and
Administratours too. Oh let it be the praise of our God, that, although the
circumference be is wide as heaven, yet Psalm 115.16 1 Chronicles. 28.2 Esaias 66.1
compare. Mat. 5.25. with Psalm 132.7
earth is the Center; and although that be the Throne, yet this is the
footstool.

The portion of the wicked is Psalm 17.14
only in this life; by the same method, the portion of the Righteous should be
only in the next: but, herein is matter worthy Thanksgivings; that, although
the Lord grants unto us his Ephah, he grudgeth not his Exodus 16.36 Psalm
112.2, 3
homer too; that although we partake of the Prove. 3.16
blessings of his right hand, he imparteth likewise the blessings of his left
hand: that, although he has given us a possession in the south-field, he
adds also Josh. 15.19
water-springs; besides the upper-springs, nether springs too: A feather in the
hand is worth a bird in the air; we have the bird in the air and the feather
in the hand too; Though grace and glory be vouchsafed unto us, no good thing is
Psalm 84.11
withheld from us; although there be set before us the Matthew 6.33
Kingdom of Heaven and the righteousness thereof, we are not disallowed the
Luke 16 9
Mammon of unrighteousness.

The heir so long as he is a child Gal. 4.1
differs nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all; Let it be the
praise of our God, that, we here in our minority, are used more like children
then servants; It suffices that we are Joh. 17.3
assured of life to come; nevertheless [over and above that] we have the
promise 1 Timothy 4 8 2 Pet. 1.3
of this life too; Since our Psalm. 62.5
expectation is from God, we may well feed upon the Col. 1.5
hope that is set before us; [yet, see] while we Ephesians. 2.6
sit together with Christ in heavenly places, he has given unto us the Psalm.
115 16
fullness of the earth! He prepares John 14.3
mansions for us in my Fathers House; but [that is not all] he likewise

give thanks, because all things Romans 8.28
work together for your good: As assuredly as 1 Cor. 3.22, 23
Christ is Gods, and ye are Christ's, so assuredly all things are yours; and, if
all things are yours, then all things are matter worthy of your thanksgiving.

Matter of Thankfulness.
Secondly, For the Kingdom of Grace.
Were there no Church of God extant under the whole Heavens, yet, unto man
deserving hell-flames, no small favor it is, if, instead of suffering torments
in hell, he may live a while upon the face of the earth. So, were there no
mansions in my Fathers House, yet, to man unworthy to live in this World, a
very great mercy it is, if he be suffered to live, not in this world only, but
within the pales also of the Id agamus, ut omne tempus nostrum sit, quod esse

First, Were Religion merely a forged invention, were it as mere a device to
overawe fools, as Atheists would [vainly] have it; yet, since most men are Homo
homini lupus. Prove. 30.14 Psalm 17.12 56.1, 2 Micah 7.2 Genesis 10.9
so greedy to devour one another, the awe which accompanies Religion must
necessarily prevent very many and very great inconveniences among us.

Next, All people Micah 4.5

will worship.

Thirdly, In Psalm. 76.1
Judah is God known: I bow my knees to the Lord Jesus, giving thanks often for
spiritual blessings by me received, while I was (long since) of the royal
foundation, as well at Westminster College, as at Trinity College in
Cambridge: In which Trinity College, Unto mine acute Sir Hicks.

brought the gift of ten shillings from a concealed Benefactour; Need enough of
so good an Angel my Chamber-fellow had, and a very ingenious Epistle of Thanks
he wrote; but, I cannot easily forget, how this (my Chamber-fellow) night by
night wracked his brains, and brake his sleep in conjecturing who, or what
Friend he might be, which unexpectedly bestowed upon him so acceptable a gift;
(whether he was the worthy Dr. Cumber, Dean of Carlisle.

would have found it out; but, still the more he conjectured, the more he was to
learn. Beloved, the very same was the case of those Acts 17.21

giver of all good things, is: we need not, now, to be taught, that the only
Potentate unto whom we owe all our thanks, is, the God of our praises, even the
only true God.

Fourthly, The excellence of knowledge, is, that Eccl. 7.12
wisdom gives life unto them who have it. Anaxagoras, rich, as well in
Cattle, as in Lands, unprofitably Anaxagoras potius ovibus quam beminibus

saying; I had not been safe, if these had not perished. Christians, what made
Anaxagoras, and most other of the Philosophers so professedly despise this
worlds goods? What made Cleanthes labor hard night by night that he might
purchase leisure to study day times? What made Democritus, first waste his
whole Estate in travails; and then, that he might be the better disposed for
contemplation, deliberately, and wilfully put out his own eyes? Verily, their
ultimate aim in these their self-denials, was to Socrates erat Homo and

Fifthly, He has showed thee Mic. 6.8. Numa Pompilius. haec omnia quasi monitu

O man: Man is dust and ashes; And that God himself should design to show man
what is good, This is a fifth particular worthy your Thanksgiving: They who
collect the lives of the Philosophers, are very exact in naming whose scholars,
whose hearers they were: It is praise enough for Carneades that Nisi Chrysippus
esset, ego noa essem, said Car^eades.

our praises, if Pythagoras or Plato, Socrates or Solon, Plutarch or Seneca,
Justin or Lipsius, Cook or Littleton, may be able to instruct any of us wherein
we may pass this transitory life unto our best advantage; but more, far more
worthy our praises it is, if the wholesome waters whereof we drink, be pumped,
not out of the head of some mortal man, but, out of the fountain of living
water. The Precepts which we follow, are, like those of Xenophon to Cyrus, they
are Basilicon Doron, they are Eikon Basilike, they are not the scattered
sentences of obscure Sibylls, nor the doubtful responses of Delphick Apollo,
nor the carnal delusions of a seducing Mahomet; no, they are the divine wisdom
of the blessed Spirit, the safe counsel of the Son of God, the immediate
Oracles of God himself: You see (then) a fifth particular, within this Kingdom
of grace, preparing unto us plentiful matter of thankfulness; namely, the
satisfaction that we find, in having so great Christ is truly such a one, as by
Valerius Maximus lib. 7. Pythagoras was ca^^ed, Peafectissimum sapientiae opus;
and as Socrates, Humanae sapientiae quasi terresire oraculum: and as the same

an Author of those heavenly instructions by which we learn to lead a heavenly
conversation while we are here upon earth: we, who walk by Scripture Rules, are
followers, not of men, but of God; we are the Disciples, not of Zeno, or of
Plato, but of the person speaking in my Text. But

Sixthly, Godliness has 1 Timothy 4.8
the promise of this life: St. John has some encouragement then to wish the
John 2.3
health and wealth of Gajus his body and estate, when the soul of Gajus
prospers. The earth is Psalm. 24.1
the Lords, and the fullness thereof: But, what does He with it? Answ. The
precious things of the earth, and the fullness thereof he gives unto Deuteronomy.
33.16
Joseph's seed, even unto the seed of them that delight Psalm. 112.1, 2, 3, 4

12.15 Psalm 37.16
the abundance of things which he possesses; Rather feed me with food
convenient for me, then give me Riches, says Pro. 30.8
Agur. But, presupposing a plentiful estate, of all conditions, the best for a
true member of the Church, a plentiful estate Psalm. 84.11 1 Cor. 3.22
he shall have.

Have it he shall, but shall not be bound to it; I mean, he shall be unto it,
not a Tit. 3.5 James 4.3 Eccles. 4.8

used it not, viz. not Psalm. 52 7
trusting in it, neither Psalm. 49.6
boasting of it, nor Psalm. 62.10
setting his heart upon it. Indeed, herein is one signal difference betwixt a
man that is, and a man that is not a faithful subject of the Kingdom of grace;
He that is not a subject unto the scepter of this Kingdom of grace, is so full
of usurpation, that, like one ill-bred, he applies himself unto

him so much good manners, that he will not once meddle with the Creature,
unless he first obtain the Sea ver. 27.28
leave and good liking of the blessed Creator; Again, he has the wit to make
the most, and the ^est of this worlds goods, namely, while he uses these
worldly Comforts, not according unto his own shallow imagination, but
accordingly as the good Word of his God Phil. 4.8
instructs him: Furthermore, He is so humbly Genesis 18.27 32.10.
thankful, that, in whatsoever he possesses, he seeks to observe, please and
credit, not Psalm 145.11 115.1 1 Chro. 29.11 Jer. 9.23, 24 Matthew. 16.24
himself, but his Lord and Savior; so much duty, so much affection owes he
unto his most bountiful God, that, whether the Job ^. 21, 22
Lord gives, or the Lord takes away, still he patiently, and most contentedly
blesses the name of the Lord. To wit, his care is, not to Matthew. 6.19
lay up for himself treasures here upon earth, but how to 1 Pet. 4.11 1 Timothy 4.5
make the best, and the most sanctifies, use that he possibly can, of every
present Heb. 13.5
portion wherewith he is already entrusted. Mean while, as the more he is
entrusted, the more he endeavors to be 1 Cor. 4.2 Luke 16.10, 11, 12
found faithful; so, the more faithful he is found, the Mat. 25.23
more he is entrusted; whereupon it follows, that wealth and riches shall be
Psalm 112.3
in his house.

It is said, Riches and honor Pro. 8.18
are with wisdom; and justly, for no person is so well able to make the best
of either riches, or honor, as is he who is Pro. 9.10 Tit. 1.15.
spiritually wise: The same Ark which made 1 Samuel 5.6
the hand of God so heavy upon the men of Ashdod, was a 2 Samuel 6.12
blessing unto the house of Obed Edom. That Bishop, who is a Heb. 13.17
spiritual Over-feer of souls, the greater 1 Samuel 1.15, 26 1 Kings 18.13
Lord he is, the greater 1 Samuel 1.40. 2 Chronicles. 23.11-21 24.2 Prove. 11.10
good he does; and He is most worthy to be a Magistrate, who is as Mi^a^. 6.8
holy as powerful. If [when Solomon petitioneth for Wisdome] what Wisdom he
seeks, he seeks, wot for his own, but 1 Kings 3.8-13
for his Gods sake, Solomon shall have wealth at will: once let it appear, that

heaven and earth does Compare Genesis 15.1 with Psa. 23.1 118.9
more for us every minute of the day, then all the Princes of Syria, and Kings
of Sodom can do for us in an age. Philosophers conclude, that wheresoever there
is light, there is heat; Sure I am, wheresoever the Gospel shines as the Sun,
there Compare Matthew. 21.9. with Psalm. 118.25 See also Psalm 36.8 31.19 1.3
the earth it self will be the warmer.

The operations of the soul are Ephesians. 4.23
requisite for the exercise of grace; the health of the body Psalm. 51.8
is subservient unto the operations of the soul; food and raiment Matthew. 6.25 1 Timothy 6.8

all things pertaining unto life are made subordinate unto the things 2 Pet. 1.3
appertaining unto godliness: See, says Isaac, Genesis 27.27, 28
The smell of my Son is as the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed,
Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth,
and plenty of corn and wine: Why all this? Answ. Jacob have Mal. 1.2 Romans 9.13

clear it is, that worldly riches are ordained, not as a snare, but as a
promised blessing; and, that wheresoever Jesus Christ reigns in the Gospel,
there he leads people from barbarism unto civility, from civility to peace,
and from peace to [the fruits of peace] plenty; The holy Spirit teaches man to

lighted upon Him, who Romans 5.6, 7, 8

that Gal. 6.5

Redeemer drank in our stead; In the third place, more Heb. 12.1

for free grace much more Romans 5.20

Christ comes that we may have life, and that we may have it John 10.10

Ye who mourn in Zion, sevenfold are your opportunities of glorifying God, as
God; and yet show I unto you a more excellent way: We shall in Heaven Romans 8:

reign with Christ, true; but, (that which is on our part, the Acts 20.35
more blessed, is this) We, here in this Kingdom of grace, have the honor not
only to Romans 5.17
rule with Christ, but also to Romans 8.17 Acts 5.41 Phil. 3.10 Col. 1.24

Once more: There is Esaias 45.3
a promise of Treasures of darkness: Oh Sirs, The dark grief for the Ephesians. 4.18
darkness of ignorance, the darkness of Jer. 13.16

Treasures the holy Angels cannot, but we sinners Psalm 51.3, 17 32.5 2 Cor.

most unfeigned thanksgivings, that we have by these, our Heb. 5.14
senses 1 Timothy 4.7
exercised unto godliness: Worldly and carnally minded persons have such
passions, but no 1 John 2.15 Romans 8.9

here we (in the Kingdom of grace) daily rejoice in, they in the kingdom of
glory have not; Christians, Let us Joel 56.8 42.3 Jeb 16.20 Esaias 38.5 Jerem.

let us mourn for him whom Zech 12.10

the 2 Cor. 4.18 -- non inferiora secutus.
most principal points worthy our thanksgiving, in these distinctly we glorify
God as God: If from that consolation, Let not your heart be troubled, we have
found so plentiful matter of thanksgivings, what may we expect from the reason
and ground of that consolation, Ye believe in God, believe also in me?

Few there are who Rari suat qui Ph^losophantur. Ulpian de excus. leg. 5.

sweets of Virtue, let his soul delude her self with the common works of the
Spirit, and mistake counterfeit grace for true grace, I confess, no heathen
Philosopher could ever attain so near, no not unto this life's happiness; I
say, the soul that perishes, cannot find a more self-pleasing practice
wherewith to feed empty hopes; yet still this happiness is only in this life,
it is but a perishing happiness. As young as he was, that dying Prince of
Loraine could say O Domine Jesu, quem merito praecepisti mu^di contemptum!
O Lord Jesu, most deservedly have thou required our contempt of this world!
And Philip the third of Spain, Nihil confert regemesse, nisi ut in morte
cruciet suisse. Mendoza in 1 Samuel Tom. 1. Page ult.
protested, All the sweet which I have found in being a King, only serves to
embitter my death. Beloved, it fares not so with the Kingdom of grace; To
believe in God, to believe in his Christ, does as well in death as in life
raise for us

Matter of Thankfulness unto God, viz.
First, For Psalm 19.11
giving us to Genesis 2.17
understand our Romans 7 8, 9
lost condition: Who Genesis 3.11
told us that we were naked? Children of wrath we Ephesians. 2.3
are by nature; but, who has warned us to Matthew. 3.7
flee from wrath? If God say unto Abimelech, Thou art Ephesians. 2.1 Genesis 20.3
a dead man, there is mercy Ephesians. 2.7
intended for Abimelech. Whether we heed it, or heed it not, Guilt dwells in
us; It is (therefore) of thy free mercy, O our God, that the Scripture has
Gal. 3.22
concluded us all under sin. Secondly, For delivering us from so great a death:
Gnashing of teeth, weeping, wailing, This was our portion for ever. Ah who
among us can abide darkness which may be felt? perpetual darkness? perpetual
darkness in a bottomless pit? in a bottomless pit streaming with brimstone,
even with everlasting burnings? With everlasting burnings kindled by the breath
of the Lord? by the breath of Him Horresco resereas. --
unto whom vengeance belongs? even of a provoked Judge! of an enraged Father!
in short, of a jealous, angry, furious God! O give thanks unto the Lord, for
his mercy endures for ever! Thirdly, For redeeming us not only from torment,
but from damnation: Friends, though we must all appear before the judgment
seat of God, yet, there is Romans 8.1
no condemnation to them who are in Christ Jesus. A Malefactor reprieved at the
place of Execution escapes death, yet was he in a peck of cares, in a bodily
fright, he trembled every joint of him, then, when he held up his hand at the
Bar; he looked as pale as that death which he feared, at what time sentence was
pronouncing against him: But ye [Beloved) give glory to the Father of mercies;
Although the ungodly Psalm 1.5
cannot, the righteous shall Psalm 37.33
stand in judgment. That great and last day, terrible to unbelievers, to you
shall be a day of Revel. 12.10
absolution, a day of Ephesians. 4.30
redemption, a day of Acts 3.21
restitution, a day of Luke 21.28
exaltation, yea, of exultation, rejoicing and triumph! Christians, you shall
be so far from dreading judgment, that you your selves shall 1 Cor. 6.2
judge the Angels. Fourthly, For preserving us (as in Judgment, so) in death;
Unto us death shall be, not our fear, but our hope; not our sting, but our
gain; When we shall (like the Priests Luke 1.8
in the Temple) have sinished our course, we shall then Revel. 14.13 Heb. 4.9
rest from our labors; We shall not only rest, but Psalm 127.2
sleep; sleep we Dan. 12.2
shall, and shall sleep 1 These 4.14
in Jesus. Thanks be unto God for our life in death. Fifthly, For begetting us
unto a 1 Pet. 3.1
lively hope. We, who Esaias 48.8
from the tomb unto John 3.3
our new birth have Esaias 1.2 Jerem. 5.23 Ezekiel 2.7
fought against Psalm 2.6 10.16
our King, had high cause to despair of obtaining mercy: Against our dread
Sovereign [even then when He Himself stood at at the door Rev. 3.20
and knocked!] we have shut the door of our Imagination, which should ever
conceive of him, not evil, but good; the door of our Memory, which should never
let him go; the door of our Understanding, which should in all our ways
acknowledge him; the door of our Affections, which should rejoice in him above
all that can be desired; the door of our Conscience, which should ever admit
him a witness unto all our deeds, words, and thoughts; These Psalm 24.7
everlasting doors have we bolted against him; wherefore most equal it is that
he should shut against us every Hos. 2.15 Matthew. 25.10 Prove. 1.26, 28
door of hope; yet (lo) before we call He answers; yea, He expostulateth
Ezekiel. 18.31
Why will ye dye? He says unto us Ezekiel. 16.6
Live! What compassions he bare unto his Brethren, Joseph Genesis 42.17
concealed; How Esau would deal Genesis 32.7
by Jacob, Jacob was not worthy to foreknow; but, for the righteous, light is
Psalm 97.11
sown: Our life, which is given us for a prey, is 2 Timothy 1.10
brought to light, does not hang in doubt before us! Sixthly, For the exercise
of godliness: When the Saper.
King of Persia led about the Roman Valeriames.
Emperor captive, so often as he took Horse, he trod upon the back of this
Emperor; the late Emperor of Rome was now made an Upping stock! Beloved, the
King of Heaven does not like that King of Persia; Upon us he trampleth not: His
enemies he Psalm 110.1 Esaias 63.3
does, his redeemed ones he does not make his footstool: We are not handled,
we are not Judges 1.7
thumbed as were those seventy Kings, whom Adoni-bezek used worse then dogs:
God neither fettereth, nor cageth us, as Tamerlan did Bajazet: He is not to his
elect, as Justinian was to his (sometimes favorite) Belisarius; He is not so
cruel to us, as Nebuchadnezzar was Jer. 39.7
unto Zedekiah; He deals not by us, as Naash 1 Samuel 11.2
would have dealed by the men of Jubesh; He treats us neither as Joshua Josh.
9.21
served the Gibeonites, nor as the Philistims 1 Samuel 13.9

let Paul, for once, be 2 Cor. 11.33

Jeremiah with Jer. 38.11
Old cast clouts, and with old rotten rags: Beloved, although God gives us
quarter, although he spares our lives, yet should he deal with us as we
deserve, he might justly continue us in this life, servants with Romans 6.16
compare Matthew. 1.21 and with 2 Timothy 2.26 1 Cor. 5.5 1 Timothy 1.20 Compare Acts

unto Satan; He might make us like the Jews, wear yellow badges: Oh my
Brethren, God has not dealed with us (15) according to our sins, he has not
rewarded us according unto our iniquities!
He has 2 Kings 6.20
brought us into the midst of Samaria, but 2 Kings 6.23.
he sets bread and water before us: He crucifieth our old man, but, our
inward man he 2 Cor. 4.16
renews daily; He takes from us our filthy garments, but gives unto us Esaias
61.10
robes of Righteousness; He Gal. 6.14
disarmeth us of our rebellious forces, but harnesseth us with the Ephesians. 6.11 2
Cor. 10.4

our strong holds; mean while, He Himself is Psalm. 18.2 71.3 91.2 62.7
our strong habitation whereunto we may always resort: O my dearly beloved
Brethren, The mighty Captain of our salvation does conquer us, but he
conquereth us with kindness!

Behold, He gives us free Gal. 5.1, 13
liberty to Ephesians. 5.16
make the best of our time, of our abilities, nay of his; what Talents we have,
are Matthew. 25.14 1 Cor. 4.7 James 1.17
his goods; with these he permits us to traffic Matthew. 16.27 1 Cor. 15.58
Heb. 6.10
for our selves; He then Romans 2.6, 7, 10 Phil. 2.13 1 Cor. 9.24 Revel. 3.5,
21.21.7
accompteth that we do him the most, and best service, when we work out our own
salvation; he encourages us to procure all the peace, all the virtue, all the
godliness; all the graces, all the present praise, and future glory we can.
Blessed, blessed be the holy God, for that, while we abide here sinners upon
earth, we are allowed to be spiritually minded, to place our affections upon
things above; to have our conversation in heaven; we are not forbid to use,
With 1 John 2.27 compare Exodus 30.33
no not the most precious ointment of the Sanctuary!

Seventhly, For bestowing upon us all things 2 Pet. 1.3
appertaining to godliness. People who never yet head the Psalm 89.15
joyful found, may Psalm 102.22 Revel. 11.15
be religious if they will, that is, if they can: I say, The Gentiles which
Luke 1.79
sit in darkness, are Acts 11.18 17.30
not prohibited light; but, light has not yet shined unto them; Whereas the
day star from on high has visited us; so that we walk (at least we should
walk) as children of the light: Yea It is with us, as Deuteronomy. 4.6, 7 Psalm 147.20
unto us of this age and kingdom, are given of Gospel-priviledges the best in
every kind: We, above all other the Churches of Christ have Matter of
Thankfulness unto God.

First, For his revealed will: Luther was no less worthy rehrehension for
Epistola Jacobi, collata cum Evangelio Johannis, and ejus epistola, prima and
cum Epistolis Paulinis, imprimis quae ad Romanos, Galatas, and Ephesios
scriptae sunt, vere straminea epistola est. See Brochmand, and Luthers German
Bible, printed 1528.
terming S. James his Epistle a strawy Epistle; then that plowman was worthy
to be praised, who for one single leaf of it, gave a whole load of hay. Verily,
if one Oration of Isocrates did cost viz. if not an 133 l. yet 100 l.
twenty talents of silver; if for every verse which Oppianus presented, was
given a viz -- 0 l. 16 s.-4 d.
stater of gold, then is every word of our God more Psalm. 119.72
to be desired then thousands of gold and silver. Sirs, every judgment
denounced, every warning given, every truth related, every prediction and
prophecy, every precept, every command, every promise, etc. abundantly claim
from us our studied thankfulness. A small portion of holy Writ the Pentateuch
is, especially if it be compared unto all the other canonical Scriptures;
nevertheless, great, Psalm. 19.7 119. per totum. 1.2 138.2
very great, was the esteem given unto the word of God, even then when no word
of God was extant, saving only those five books of Moses: Beloved, blessed are
your eyes, for they see those holy Scriptures, which neither Moses, nor David,
nor any of the Patriarchs saw.

Next, For this revealed will of God with Psalm 102.18 compare Hos. 8.12
written: By signs and wonders, and by several other means has the God of
truth given testimony unto the truth of his Word: See du Plessis and Grot. de
veritate relig. Christianae, and Dr. Hammond his Reasonableness of Christian
Religion.
Among which, this is not the least, namely, the harmonious consent of various
Copies in several Nations and Languages transcribed and preserved: And herein,
let our God receive the praise due from us; for, none of the Churches of Christ
can equal their Bibles unto that published by our English Clergy even in Videas
Praefat. ad Waltoni. Bibl. Polyglotta.
perilous times!

Thirdly, For this written Word Deuteronomy. 28.49 1 Cor. 14.14 Revel. 14.16
translated, and Genesis 40.8 Job 33.23 Prove. 1.6 1 Cor. 12.10 14.13 Esaias 50.4
interpreted: Nor has any Kingdom under Heaven so great cause to be thankful
for the purity of Scripture-translations and interpretations, as England has.

Fourthly, For these truths of God wholsomely applied: In England every place
is full of Manna; I mean, of religious Treatises almost in every kind. When the
Reverend Prelacy of this English Church were silenced by The Tribe of Levi.
stands and falls with the Tribe of Judah.
a rebellious power, God gave them a heart and an ability to leave a Monument
of truth in Bishop Waltons voluminous Bible. The Lord stir up the hearts of
those Ministers among us which now silence themselves, to improve their talents
likewise; Whether in publishing their own corrected labors, or in advancing,
revising, contracting, and digesting the learned works of other men. Oh that I
might see Like unto the Hexapla written by Andrew Willet.
in English, Hexapla upon the whole Scriptures: Oh that some Evangelical
Riverius Imitating Riverius his Practice of Physic.
would, out of the best practical Divines, select the case and cure of every
soul.

Fifthly, For See Mr. William Durham his Epistle before his Sermon upon James
5.9
the Gospel preached: What any Minister of Christ delivers according to the
simplicity of Gods holy Word, that, not so much the Minister, as with Exodus
20.19. Job 33.6, 7. and 2 Cor. 4.7. compare Number. 16.5, ii. Deuteronomy. 18.19 Number.
17.10. 1 Samuel 8.7. Mat. 10.40. and Luke 10 16. So long as he keeps to his
Commissiom, and delivers the Counsel of God, you cannot despise the work of
your Minister, but you do therewithal despise the blood of your Savior, Bishop
Reynolds. page 46. of his Pastoral Office.
Christ himself speaks; for Christ by His 1 Cor. 12.28 Matthew. 28.20 Ephesians. 4
11, 12
Ministry, now Heb. 12.25 Ephesians. 2.7 2. Cor. 5.20
speaks from Heaven. O blessed Jesu, Thou did not pray for thy Ministers
alone, but for John 17.20
them also which shall believe on thee through THEIR word.

Sixthly, For every other Ordinance of Christ administered among us: Compare the
purity of our Church with the superstitions abroad; yea, confer 2 Cor. 3.8, 9
Gospel worship with the Gal. 4.9
beggarly rudiments of the Law; or the 1 Pet. 3.21
laver of Baptism with the Curtis Jadaeis. Pers. Genesis 17.11
unsightly circumcision of the foreskin of the flesh; or the 1 Cor. 11.23
Supper of the Lord with the Exodus 32 8
bitter herbs of the Passover; nay, taste the Spirit and life of any Ordinance
of Christ; you will then Psalm. 30.4
give thanks unto God at the remembrance of his holiness.

Seventhly, Let us and all the Churches be thankful, for that the John 6.29 1
John 3.23
whole duty of man is to believe in God and his Christ. When we hear and
believe, read and believe, meditate and believe, then is our heart filled with
joy, and our lips with praises: I believed, therefore 2 Cor. 4.13
have I spoken. The James 5.16
prayer of faith how does it avail? The Hab. 2 4
just shall live by his faith, yet Gal. 2.20
not he, but Christ lives in him! Wisely to Psalm 119.66 Matthew. 13.56
believe, to credit, and to trust, is noble and heroique; then this generous
duty, what duty can be more desirable except to love which is but Gal. 5.6
faith exercised? God he graciously entrusteth the Believer with whatsoever
conduces unto his everlasting good. The believer, he [again] does not only
believe, but Psalm. 62.8 Esaias 7.9 30.15 Prove. 14.26 Ephesians. 3.12 Heb. 3.6
trust his God: He rests assured that the Almighty is so just, so true, that
man may safely rely upon the faithful friendlinesse of every proceeding of his,
and upon his bare word in whatsoever he speaks; no wisdom, etc. like Gods
wisdom, etc. Between learner and teacher, servant and master, man and wife,
etc. there is a necessity of trusting; of these some or other may betray their
trust; But, seldom will we mistrust a person of honor: and, as for the word
of a King, that [ye know] is sacred among us: it were barbarism to give a
Prince the lie: Oh then, where we have Gods word of truth for our warrant, and
that Joh. 17.3
warrant sealed unto us by Gods Spirit of truth, with what full assurance may
we Heb. 4.16
repose a steadfast confidence upon our great and loving God? Most cheerfully
can the Believer Credere Joan. 14.1. in Deum, est fiduciam habere. Zegerus.
trust his God for the pardon of all his sins, for the supply of all his wants,
for the acceptance of his person and of his endeavors, for the reward promised
unto every duty, etc. Things temporal are not more visible to thine eye, then
Heb. 11.1
things spiritual are to his faith. All have Romans 3.23
sinned, and come short of the glory of God; Christians, wherein soever we sin,
therein our faith fails us, viz. We do not Psalm. 111 7 119.66, 151, 86.172
believe the commandment [by us broken] to be so good for us, so advantageous
to us, as Deuteronomy. 6.24 10.13
in truth it is. There neither is nor can be any sin which is not accompanied
with unbelief: On the other side, the greater our faith, the less we disobey,
that is, the less we come short of the glory of God.

Eighthly, If the life of faith Hab. 2.4
be a life so desirable; what thanks is due from us unto our God for that Romans
1.4
holy, that 1 Pet. 4.14
blessed spirit of his by which 2 Cor. 4.13
alone we are enabled to believe? By Him is sanctified the 2 These. 2.13
use of all that is before us: Our Matthew. 5.6
thirst after righteousness makes us to relish righteousness the better:
The waters of salvation which we draw, we draw with Esaias 12.3
joy: The breasts which we suck, are breasts of Esaias 66.11
consolation: We Esaias 38.16
live, and the spiritual life which we lead, is Romans 8, 6
pleasant unto us: We have bread from heaven to feed upon, and a Jer. 31.25
spiritual taste to delight us while we feed: We are a people Psa. 75.1 14.14
Romans 13.11
near unto the Lord: We are not amused as those Disciples were Luke 9.33 Matthew
17.6.
before whom the person speaking in my Text was transfigured, (no) our eyes are
Number. 24.3 Luke 24.31
open, we Phil. 3.12
apprehend that for which also we are apprehended: We are not laid in a
trance, as Acts 9.4 10.10 22.17
Saul was, then, when the Lord converted him: God does not cast us into Genesis
2.20, 21
a dead sleep, as he did Adam, while he raises a Psalm 89.19
help meet for us; rather, he gives us Mat. 13.17 1 Cor. 2.7, 10 Ephesians. 3.9,
10 Col. 1.26, 27 1 Pet. 1.12
free leave to look on, and to contemplate the wisdom of his power: He does
not snatch us from unbelief to eternal bliss in a moments space, but he gives
us leisure to inform our selves of all those mysteries which his holy Gospel
reveals: We are not taken up in a whirlwind, but, we walk with God, and
gently pass from death to life: We are entertained in this Kingdom of grace
with the Psalm 84.2 Heb. 9.28 2 Pet. 3.13 Heb. 13.14 Romans 8.24 Jer. 31.17
interview of glory to come: We are not deprived of the delight Psalm 63.1
119.174.20
which accompanies expectations: As hope deferred makes fruition the Prove.
13.12
more sweet; so, there is a 1 Pet. 1.3
liveliness in hope: A pleasant and amiable practice it is, to Job 22.21 Phil.
2, 1 1 John 1.3
acquaint our selves with that God, whose beatifical vision we long for: When
out Rev. 19.7
marriage with the Lamb shall at length be celebrated, we shall 1 These. 4.17
consummate our joys in the highest heavens; nevertheless, it is no small
satisfaction unto us, that we are Hos. 2.19, 20 Jerem. 2.2 Ezekiel. 16.8 2 Cor.
11.2 1 Cor. 6.17
betrothed here below: While the Bridegroom of our souls Esaias 58.11 Psalm 32.8
73.24
guides us, thorough the troubles of heart, toward the mansions in his Fathers
house, his loving Spirit makes us to Esaias 23.2 36.7, 8, 9, 10
lie down in green pastures, and leads us, as beside waters of quietness,
so, beside Cant. 3.11
Rivers of pleasure! Sirs, although the day of our espousals will be unto us
the eternal day [30] of the gladness of our hearts, yet we would not be
debarred the Jer. 2.2
sweets of wooing, we would not miss the ever Phil. 2.1
endearing communion of his most blessed Spirit: Happy we, that we may Hos. 2.14
take time between Egypt and the promised Rest; Oh, let us John 6.31
feed a while upon Manna in the wilderness: Let us rest Ps. 84.7
our selves upon the holy hill of Sion, before we climb Gal. 4.26
Jerusalem above: By this we know that God has a delight in us to do us good
in our later end, 1 John 4.13
because he vouchsafes unto us his own Spirit: It is the holy Spirit which
Nehem. 9.20
instructs, Psa. 32.8
advises, Revel. 3.18
counsels, Ephesians. 2.1 Psalm 119.93
quickens, and Ephesians. 32 8 73.24
guides us in every duty wherewith at any time we glorify our God: It it the
holy Spirit [that Spirit whom we so long resisted, so ungratefully quenched,
and so frequently grieve!] which makes every Ordinance of Christ Ephesians. 3.7 4.16
1 These. 2.13
effectual unto our souls: It is the holy Spirit which Ephesians. 4.30
seals us as his own peculiar goods against the day of Redemption: This is
that Nehem. 9.20
good Spirit, that John 14.16
other, that Psa 51.6
inward, that ever-present John 14.18, 26 Psalm 94.19
Comforter, which makes every day throughout the year [to us] a Esaias 57.18, 19
Feast of Pentecost, which continually Esaias 30.21 John 14.1
whispereth unto us, Let not your heart be troubled; yea, which graciously With
Heb. 13.21 compare John 14.11
raises our hearts unto a belief in God, and unto a belief in his Christ: Dear
Christians, to be spiritually minded is Romans 8.6
life and peace; be ye Ephesians. 5.18
filled with the spirit, and ye shall be filled with joy: The graces of this
blessed Spirit, are the ornaments with which He who is the desire of our souls
Psalm. 149 4
beautifieth us: This Spirit of grace is that John 3.29
friend of the Bridegroom which gains a good affection in us toward our
Lover, which Esaias 56.7
interprets unto us all his love tokens!) By this Spirit he brings us into
Hos. 2.14 Cant. 7.12
the secret places of the Wilderness; by this Spirit he allureth us, speaks
dearly to us, wooeth us, courteth us, and Esaias 5.1 Psalm 118.14 42.8
sings unto us the whole song of Solomon: By this Spirit he Ephesians. 5.26
purifieth our hearts that we may come with the more confidence unto his
Bride-chamber; He holds a close 2 Cor. 13.14
communion with our spirits by this Spirit; The time of our spiritual life here
is the Jer. 2.2 Tota Christiani vita est Esaias 26.8 desiderium sanctum.
time of loves; We have not patience to stay until he bring us unto his
Bride-chamber; oh let him kiss us here Cant. 1.2
with the kisses of his mouth; The mouth of him who espouseth us unto himself
is this Spirit, even the Spirit of truth, and of love. In every grace, viz. in
the Heb 5.14
exercise of every grace, we enjoy a Phil. 3.20 Ephesians. 2.6
heavenly mindedness which eternity it self shall perfect. This God 1 John 4 8.
of love is a Wisdom 1.6
loving spirit; he leads us into his Prove. 3.17
ways of pleasantness, he walks with us in his garden walks; he fills us
with Psalm 119 20
longings: he ravisheth our souls with Psalm 119 97
spiritual delights, he Romans 8.15
adopteth us children, children of God, and heirs of salvation, he 2 Pet. 1.4.
makes us partakers of the divine naturr, he Jer. 3.14.
declares us the Spouse of Jesus Christ; O let us be thankful for that Zech.
12 10
Spirit of grace, which James 1.17
alone can give us grace to be Ephesians. 5.20
thankful.

Ninthly, Unto us a Esaias 9.6
Son is given. As the Son imparteth unto us John 3.34 7.38 15.26
his own spirit, so the Father John 3.16
gives unto us his own Son; his own Son 1 John 1.2 Ephesians. 3.9, 11
manifest in the flesh! A mystery, a great mystery, a See Bishop Andrews
Sermon. on 1 Timothy 3.16 See Ephe. 3.10
great mystery almost swallowing up our meditations, and making us (not so
much thankful, as) thankfulness it self! For, since this Son of God is both
Acts 10.36
Lord and Heb. 1.2
heir of all things, give Romans 8.32
HIM to us, and we will quickly lay our claim unto 1 Cor. 3.22
whatsoever he has: The work of John 1.3 Col. 1.16
his hands, the worlds which Heb. 1.2
he created, they are Ps. 115.16
our goods and chattels; (Ours Matthew. 6.32 1 Timothy 4 8 Heb. 13.5
during our life, for 1 Cor. 7.31
our use; His for ever, for Psalm 119 91
his glory:) What inheritance he holds by Mat. 21.33
birthright, that, by his Heb. 1.2
purchase is Rem. 8.17 Tit. 3.7 Heb. 1.14 James 2.5. 1 Pet. 3.7.
made ours: The price of his blood is 1 Cor. 10.16. Ephesians. 1.7.
Ours, pays off 1 John 1.7, 9.
all our debts, and that Phil. 2.9.
unto his gain. The Phil. 3.10.
power of his Resurrection is Romans 6.5, 11.
Ours, raises us from Col. 3.1.
dead works, and will John 6.54.
raise us up at the last day; His holy life is Romans 13.14.
our example and Mat 17.5 1 Cor. 1.30 Phil. 3.9
merit: His universal obedience has Gal. 2.16
fulfilled the whole Law Gal. 3.13
in our stead; His 1 Cor. 1.30
sanctification is made ours, [because he is holy, we are reputed holy; because
he is righteous, we are Esaias 13.11
reputed righteous;] n^y, his very Sonship is Gal. 4.5, 6
ours; He is Son of God by Psalm 110.1
nature, we by the Ephesians. 1.5
adoption of his Spirit; for this cause he is not Heb. 2.11
ashamed to call us brethren, and to acknowledge His Father to be John 20.17
Our father. But, though Jonathan keeps 1 Samuel 18.14
his bow, his sword, and his robes to himself, David will love Jonathan for 1 Samuel 18.3
Jonathans sake; True, of the fullness of Christ we all John 1.16
receive grace for grace; and whatsoever duties we owe unto God, them Jesus
Christ performs Ephesians. 5.2 Tit. 2.14
in our name and stead; but, did he neither secure us from wrath, nor procure
us benefits, yet still [Jesus is the Magni Parentis non minor filius.

Chara Dei sobo'es magnum Jovis incrementum.

Or, as Aurelius Symmachus of Boethius, Illud pretiocijsimum humani generis
decus.


gracious Son of a gracious Father] we should love Jesus both for his Fathers
sake, and for his own sake. Mean while, He who spared not his own Son, but has
Romans 8.3
given him up to our nature, to our infirmities, to our sorrows, to the wrath
and death due to us; he that gives to us, and thus gives to us his Son, how
shall he not with him also freely give us all things! Wherefore, thanks be unto
God Romans 7.25
through Jesus Christ our Lord; yea, thandks be unto God for Jesus Christ our
Lord.

The last matter of Thankfulness which I now propose [while we abide here
within this kingdom of grace] is Gods love to mankind. The 2 Cor. 4.6
face of Jesus Christ could never be so full of 2 Cor. 3.18
smiles to usward; but that the God, and 1 Pet. 1.3
father of our Lord Jesus Christ is toward us so John 3.16 Romans 5.8
infinitely compassionate.

We Mat. 18.3 1 John 4.4 John 13.33
little children, conscious of our demerit Jer. 31.18 Zech 12.10 1 John 1.10
bemoan our selves, we cry, we Mic. 4.9
cry out aloud, because we have done Romans 3.23
a very great fault; Mc 5.5
Peace, Ephesians. 2.10, 15, 17
peace, [saith the father of our mercies] wipe Esaias 54.4, 6, 8 30.19
away all tears from your eyes; I will not Jer. 31.34.33.8
punish you; you be Esaias 43.12 44.22
blameless and Esaias 40.2 55.7, 8
righteous, and Esaias 53.11 John 1.29
perfect; You did not Number. 23.21
commit the offense, but, my Isa. 42.1
servant did; with you I am well pleased, I was angry, not with you, but with
my Isa. 53.10
servant: [Ah Mar. 15.28. 2 Cor. 5.2
naughty servant,] I have Isa. 53.3-10
beaten him; but you, be Ephesians. 1.6
good children: Come, turn Isa. 51.11
your sorrow into gladness, and your mourning into joy; Love me 1 John 4.19
John 14.15, 16
little children, I your 1 John 3.16
father love you; kiss 2 Samuel 14.33. Psalm 2.12
and be Ephesians. 2.16 2 Cor. 5.18 Col. 1.20.21
friends.

Other Kings whip their highborn sons upon their Pages back; this King of
heaven and earth, he spares his vilest servants, and scourges them upon the
shoulders of his most glorious Son!

His justice against us, the avenging God must satisfy; but, so he loves us,
that, rather then we should endure everlasting imprisonment, he Psalm 40.7, 8
got his own Son to be Heb 7.22
surety for us: By this advantage, the severity of his just execution he
extends, not against us who brake his whole Law, but Esaias 53.3-10
against him who Matthew. 3.15 5.17 John 19.30
fulfilled every tittle of it! not upon us who deserve eternal death, but
against him who has right 1 Timothy 6.16
unto a Crown of life! not upon us who daily rebel against him, but, upon Him
who John 4.34 5.30 6.38
ever delights to do his will! not upon us the guilty and ungodly, but upon
him 1 Pet. 3.18
the innocent and righteous! not upon us who were Ephesians. 2.3
by nature the children of his wrath, but upon him who is by nature Matthew. 3.17
the Son of his love! So God loved the world that he gave his only begotten
Son, that John 3.16
whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life!

God is of Hab. 1.13
purer eyes then to behold our Zech. 3.4
filthy garments; therefore he Esaias 61.10
adornetk us with the Robes of his only Son; He cannot excuse us while we take
our own courses; therefore he Ephesians. 5.26, 27 Tit. 2.14.
sanctifies us by the Word and Spirit of his own Son; He cannot affect us as
we abide Ezekiel. 16.6
polluted in our sins; therefore he takes the Revel. 1.5 1 Pet. 1.19 1 John
1.9 2.2
heart-blood of his dear Son, and therewith washes away our stains and guilt;
Ephesians. 1.4
He cannot exalt us while we abide strangers and enemies; therefore he electeth
us to be his Romans 6.22
servants, John 15.14, 15
friends, and 1 John 3.1
children: and, to Isa. 54.5
let us see how great a kindness he has for us, he 2 Cor. 11.2 Ephesians. 5.30
Matthew. 25.10 Revel. 21.2
gives us in marriage unto the Heir of all things, even unto his only begotten
Son, whom he ever embraces within his bosom, infinitely loving him; loving
him every whit as dearly as he loves himself! yea, the Lord God Heb. 1.4 2.7
exalts him in our nature Phil. 2.9 Heb. 2.9 Esaias 53.10, 12 49.6 Psalm 2.8
because our nature is by him exalted.

In Jesus Christ, the Wonderful God reveals unto us unsearchable Col. 2.3
1.26 Ephesians. 3.8, 9, 10 1 Timothy 3.16 1 Pet. 1.20, 12
Treasures of wisdom, infinite Riches of Ephesians. 1.6, 7 2.5, 7 2 Timothy 1.9 Romans
3.24 1 Cor. 2.12 Revel. 21.6 22.18
free grace, ineffable bowels of loving kindnesses! I challenge all the Poets
among the Heathens to invent, nay, to imitate 2 Pet. 1.16
either such a Tragedy, or such a Comedy as (in relation, as well unto us, as
unto themselves) is divinely acted by the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost,
three persons in one God for ever blessed.

Let Pharaoh Gen 41.43
make Joseph Ruler of his whole Kingdom, let Nebuchadnezzar Dan. 1.4 2.48 6.3
educate, and advance Daniel the best he can; unto Esther 3.1. 6.10 2.17
Haman, nay unto Mordecai, nay unto Esther, let Ahasuerus show the utmost of
his loving favors, yet none of these Histories are worthy to be borrowed [no
not] as illustrations of that eternal love which the everlasting Father
reveals unto us in his Gospel of Jesus Christ.

Do [Vnbelievers] dote upon the trash of this world: squander away your health,
your wits, your wealth, your time, your talents upon a 1 John 5.19
world of folly, upon Eccles. 1.2
emptiness, upon nothing, upon 1 John 3.4 Romans 7.13 6.23
sin which is worse then nothing; while we, who are made James 2.5
Denizons of this kingdom of grace, bestow Psalm 1.2 104.34 119.97 Phil. 3.8 1 Timothy 4.15
our time, our thoughts, our continual studies upon the sacred mysteries of the
glorious Gospel: We enjoy a fellowship which you (poor fools) are not well
aware of; to wit, the Phil. 2.1 2 Cor. 13.14
fellowship of [that true Comforter!] the holy Ghost, the Phil. 3.10
fellowship of [that endearing Redeemer!] the Son of God, and the 1 John 1.3
4.16
fellowship of [him who is all in all unto us!] God the Father.

In this Kingdom of grace, behold 1 John. 1
what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should [here] be
called the sons of God: Beloved, 1 John. 2
now are we the sons of God, but it does not yet appear what we shall be;
But, this I know, we shall then be like him when we shall see him as he is;
and, we shall most assuredly see him as he is; for

In my fathers house are many Mansions.
HOw amiable are these Tabernacles of thine Psalm 84.1
O Lord of hosts? Blessed are they that Psalm 84.4
dwell in thy house, they will still be praising thee. One thing have I desired
of the Lord which I will Psalm 27.4
seek after, namely, that I may dwell in this house of the Lord all the
endless days of mine everlasting life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and
to enquire in his Temple. My soul Psalm 84.2
longs, yea even faints for the Courts of the Lord.

Beloved, as there is no coming unto these Mansions in my fathers house until
the kingdom of glory be first entered; so, there can never be wanting

Matter of thankfulness unto God
For the Kingdom of glory,
A Kingdom indeed; a kingdom of the great God! a kingdom of the great glory
of the great God! Praise ye the Lord from Psalm. 148.1
the heavens.

Da Christianum and scit quod dico; but, Where no grace is, there the King of
glory loses his right.
Christians, were there no temporal punishments, no death, no judgment, no hell
to be escaped; no Satan to be trodden under foot, no sin to be subdued, no
virtue to be desired, no Gospel-conversation to entertain us while we abide in
the Church militant, no present grace to be the measure of future Reward, no
recompense of Reward at all; nay, were our life here upon earth a continual
Hell, yet, the Tit. 1.2 Gal. 5.5 2.3 3.7 Heb. 6.18
hope that is set before us, the Phil. 3.14
high price of our high calling may justly fill our mouth with the high praises
of our God.

Here, I confess, my tongue is not the Pen of a ready Writer: He needs the
tongue, not of men, but of Angels; the wing, not of an Eagle, but of a Cherub,
that 2 Cor. 12.4
undertakes to soar toward these mansions: My thoughts may, my tongue cannot
ascend the heavens; It is for divine St. Augustine to write of the City of God.

Eye has 1 Cor. 2.9
seen much, ear has heard more then eye has seen; man's heart conceives more
then his ear has heard, yet all is too little, at the best: The visible world
[large as it is] contains not variety enough of creatures, to paint out in
apposite colors, nay to shadow out without colors, nay, without the least
shadow, to delineate an imperfect mapp of this Revel. 21.2, 3, 11
most glorious kingdom.

By the mansions in my Fathers house, Ex pede Herculeme 1 Cor. 13.12
you may attempt some small conjecture of what great thanks we owe unto our
merciful God for the surpassing, infinite, and eternal peace, joy, bliss, and
glory of this heavenly Kingdom.

We find here signified
Matter of joy to us, and Nam gaudio cogendi vis inest. Pan. ad Trajan.
of praises to our God.
First, in the Mansions.
Object. Why Mansions?

Answ. 1. Mansions intimate rest: Because I have said John 16.6
these things unto you, sorrow has filled your heart; but, let not your heart
be troubled: When trouble is nigh, God Psalm 22.11 91.15
is not far off: you believe in God, believe also in me; I John 14.2
go to prepare a place of rest for you. Beloved, all things under the Sun are
like the Moon, full of defects and changes; yea, all things under the heavens
are, like the Air, made up of vanity and commotions, but, verily Brethren, Heb.
4.9
there remains a rest for the Saints.

Answ. 2. Mansions, as they promise rest, so, they intimate Joan. 14.2 Syrus
habet vocabulum quod significat locum pablicum, ut diversorium, sicut etiam
Suetonius Mansionis nomine pro diversorio and hospitio utitur. Ge^hard in Hist,
Harm. Evangel
rest after travel: By the sharpness of death I open the kingdom of heaven,
(not for my self, for I John 6.38.3.13.
came down from heaven, but) for you, I go to prepare a place of John 14.2
(...). Similitudo sumpta ab uno comitum qui in itinere praegressas ad
diversorium, ibi caeteris cubicula assignat and efficit ut venientibus parata
sint. Grotius.
entertainment for you; In my Fathers house are many Mansions.

Answ. 3. Mansions, as they give rest after travel, so, they Ostendit Joan.
14.2 Apostolos hoc nomine Deo fidere debere quod in domo patris sui variae sint
paratae manj^o^^s: A transsug^s sumpla Metaphora, quibus, magno solatio est
habere varia Asyla ad consuglenda: quae promittit Christus, sive praesentem
spectes vitam, sive futuram. Zegerns.
yield refuge against danger: As there is no covert from a storm like ones
well built dwelling house, so, there is no shelter from trouble, like Gods
dwelling house: In Gods house we at once, both escape a storm, and find Psalm
3.2, and 91.9.
a God On Mount Zion shall be a Esaias 4.6.
shadow from heat, and a refuge from storm; I will be unto you a Ezekiel. 11.16.
little Sanctuary: Sirs, when Jesus Christ's Disciples are persecuted upon
earth, they take sanctuary in heaven.

Answ. 4. Mansions, as they import protection, so they imply (...), quasi
Stabiles mansiones.
continuance of that protection. Tents may be soon taken down, soon removed,
Mansion-houses Esaias 33.20
not so. Christians, Upon earth we are all of us Jer. 35.7
Rechabites: we have here H^b. 13.14
no continuing City; the City of God [that] endures for ever!

Answ. 5. Mansions serve, as well for convenience, as for continuance: The
Jewish Temple which was so Psalm 15.1 Revel. 11.19
absolute a Type of the Temple of God in new Jerusalem, was, if Ezekiel. 40.44,
45, 46
duly considered, as well a College, as a Temple: About it were Jer. 35.4
store of Chambers built for those Priests and Levites which ministered before
the Lord: Friends, so many of us as wait upon the Lord Psalm 23.4
need fear no night; no servant of this Lord shall want for lodging; so
professedly are the mansions in my fathers house allotted unto the followers of
Jesus Christ, that, death shall only Esaias 26.20
bring us unto our chambers.

Answ, 6. Mansions comprehend, not only convenience, but delight; and that,
first, in regard of the building; next, in regard of the furniture.

First, Our outhouses are meanly built, of hay, stubble, mud or such like: Our
outward buildings are ordinarily neglected as are those vessels of dishonor
which lumber them, or the cattle which we house in them; may they be warm for
the cattle, necessary for business, or serviceable for out-uses, all is
passing well; not so with See Revel. cap. 21.
our mansion house; that [if any] is of stone-work, if not of Marble, curiously
hewn and carved.

Next, as of the two, the faebrique is more excellent, so the furniture. We
will hardly be at the charge of plaistering our barns or hovils, much less do
we either wainscot or hang them: But, if we have any Bed, Table, Stool,
Candlestick, etc. let them be 2 Kings 4.10
furniture for the Prophets lodging-room; if the world has any Purple,
Needlework, Gold or Pearl, let them be see Exodus cap. 36. cap. 37. cap. 38.
cap. 39.
set apart for the dwelling place of the most High: Unto our Mansion-houses we
bring our household stuff, our substance, our riches, our treasures, our plate,
our furniture, our tapestry, etc. Our Mansion-houses we make and keep as neat,
as pleasant, as delightful, as the condition of our private estates will
permit. Beloved, these mansions in my Text are, all of them, Domum apud patrem
hab^o, came ^ae vobis paratam, to, lodge ^oculentissim ^n amplissimam, bo it is
omnibus instruct^ssi^un. Jac. Capellus in Joan 14.2
furnished, not according unto the lowness of our mean condition, but,
according unto the majesty and honor of the high and mighty Lord of all
things; The royal Treasures, the Princely Ornaments of every mansion, within
this Palace, speak their owner a great king, even a Psalm 24.7
king of glory. Therefore, as you will find them glorious mansions, so you do
find them

Many Mansions.
Jesus Christ had John 13.36
newly informed Cephas, whither I go thou can not follow me now, but thou
shall follow me hereafter; This the other Disciples, who then stood by, John
13.33
overheard; over-hearing this, their hearts were troubled: Thought they, Vide
in Joan. 14.1 T^rinum Mol^^^^t^m. Ja^teni, concord. Even^ cap. 134
what shall become of us? Peter, he shall follow Christ, but poor we may be
left John 14.18
comfortless behind; No [saith Jesus] I John 14.2
deal plainly with you, Were it so, I would have told you; but, in my Fathers
house are many mansions, mansions enough for Peter, enough for my self, enough
for you, and for thousands more besides you.

Object. Many are called, but Matthew. 20.16
few are chosen: Strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leads unto
life, and Matthew. 7.14
few there be who find it.

Answ. 1. Verily, this is one reason why I have openly endeavored to roll
every stone from your heart; Alas, the unbelief of many among us did never yet
trouble their thoughts; They accept an Qui Christiani nominis opus non agit,
Christianus non esse videtur. Salvian. de Dei Gub. lib. 4.2 Tim. 2.19 3.5
Revel. 3.1 James 2.20
idle, fruitless, opinionative knowledge, instead of a firm belief in God and
his Christ; They promise unto themselves these mansions in my Fathers house,
whereas, except they repent, they shall never Heb. 12.14
step toward them: They have a name that they live, but are dead. [By their
Matthew. 7.20
fruits you may know it:] God will not put that into their heads, which they
cast at their heels; if they Acts 13.46
judge themselves unworthy of everlasting life, it is just with God, not to See
Dr. Selater upon 2 These. 1.5, ^1
account them worthy of his calling. But, mine APOLOGY in behalf of my God,
is, that although few there be who work out Phil. 2.12
their Salvation, Christ 2 Cor. 5.15
dyed for all; Though few there be who find that Jesus Christ is the John 14.6
only way which leads unto life, in Jesus Christ is everywhere John 10.10
offered Life more abundant.

Answ. 2. Although in comparison of all them for whom 1 John 2.2 Romans 5.18
Jesus Christ dyed, they that perish Matthew 7.13
are many; yet, in comparison of them whom Jesus Christ might justly Romans 3.9,
23 1 Samuel 2.30
have rejected, they who belive unto salvation, have need of many mansions, for
they are many: Compare the John 10.16
flock of sheep with the Matthew. 25.38
herd of goats, and a Luke 12.32
little flock it is; but, recollect how many of these sheep the 1 Pet. 5.8
wolf would have devoured, and you will then grant, that (over what it might
have been) this little flock abides a John 10.16 Psalm 84.7 Revel. 7.9
great flock. There were in numerably more fishes left in the Sea, then Luke 5.6
taken, yet the ibid.
Text says, They enclosed a great multitude of fishes; Although more are
without the pale of the Church then within it; yea, although more are in the
Church then of it; yet multi udes of Believers there are, whom these Fishers of
men convert. True, many are those unthankful wretches which will torment
themselves in hell-flames; but, blessed be our Savior, many [although not so
many] are the Saints glorified in Heaven.

Answ. 3. No marvail it is, if the mansions in my Fathers house be many, since
the elect of God cannot be few: We find from the East, and from the west,
Matthew. 8.11
many coming to sit down with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, in the kingdom of
heaven: Among the tribes of Israel, we see a Revel. 7.4
hundred forty four thousand sealed: In the beginning of the world Jude 14
ten thousand of the Saints were heard of: If you will allow the seed of
Abraham to be, Genesis 22.17
like that father of the faithful, Gal. 3.7, 8
true believers, you will, as soon number the stars of heaven, as them: For,
although unto the great God, neither Psalm 139.16
they, nor the Psalm 147.4
stars are innumerable, yet unto us finite creatures, they are a Revel. 7.9.
great multitude, which no man can number.

Answ. 4. A multitude of the heavenly host Luke 2.13
seconded one Angel; how great that multitude was, God alone knows; Every
legion of Angels is computed six thousand six hundred sixty and six in number;
of these you may observe twelve legions mentioned Matthew. 26.53
like one single troop: We read of Dan. 7.10
thousand thousands spirits who ministered unto God, and of ten thousand times
ten thousand who stood before him: and again Revel. 5.21
ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands. Beloved, in my
Fathers house, none of all these want their mansions.

Answ. 5. Many, viz. for the Hos. 4.16
greater solace of these Disciples: Some conclude, that one of hell torments
shall be an oppressing and Esaias 22.5
over-crowding one another, thorough the narrow scantnesse of that bottomless
pit: If so, One of the pleasures of Heaven shall be a Mark 14.15 Psalm 31.8
118.5 Matthew. 13.30
spaciousness of room: God will Esaias 54.2
enlarge our Tent. The Saints shall not complain that the place is Esaias 49.19,
20
too strait for them.

Answ. 6. Many, viz. to set forth the Pauperis est aum^rare.
greatness of God their Maker and Builder: Great is the House (and therefore
many are the mansions) which he builds for Dar. 4.30 1 Chronicles 29.1
the honor of his Majesty: Says Solomon, 2 Chronicles. 29
What house I build shall be wonderful great.

Answ. 7. Many, because of No^ male veteres intelligunt cum graduum
differentiis. G ^ot. in locum. (...). Clem. Serom. 6. Quonodo multae mansiones

part, in and about the Temple, was holier then another: A stranger might not
approach the Ally before the Temple: A Priest might enter the Courts, which an
Israelite might not: Between the porch and the Altar no Priest might come,
unless his head were covered; The inwarder part of the Temple was more holy
then the Priests Courts, and within the Vail was the Holy of holies. So in
heaven there be mansions one of a higher degree of glory then another; Hereunto
the person speaking in my Text principally alludeth: Says he, This is the
victory which overcomes your troubles, even your faith; wherefore believe in
God, believe also in me; and, take this for your encouragement; The greater
your faith is, the greater your victory; and the greater your victory is, the
greater shall be your Reward; for, I will reward every one of you according
unto his work of Faith; and that I may reward every one of you according unto
your work of Faith, In my Fathers house are many Mansions (...)

It is not said they shall be, but they [already] are: Thi^ is yet one more
incitement unto a thankful glorifying of God as God, viz. the Beatitudo haec

full assurance, the lively hope which is set before us: There 2 Pet. 3.13.
Revel. 21.1.
shall be new heavens, nay, there Esaias 66.5 17.18.
are.

There are mansions, many mansions, many mansions of many degrees; of degrees
already prepared to recompense the highest degree of faith and love which any
Disciple can possibly reach; wherefore, my beloved Brethren, be ye 1 Cor. 15.58
steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for so much
as you know, your labor is not in vain in the Lord: There are many mansion in
my Fathers

-- house.
Quest. Why is the kingdom of glory compared to a house?

Answ. For the same reason that you here see many mansions; not only mansions,
but many mansions [as I told you]: The glory of the invisible See Bishop
Reynolds. on Hos. 14. Sermon. 5. Sect. 2. in The beauty of Lillies.
infinitely transcendeth the glory of the visible world: Hence, as we are
forced to use many letters to spell one long word, or, many words to compose
one eloquent speech; so, by reason of our imperfect understanding, we are
constrained to borrow many worldly excellencies to represent any 1 Chronicles. 29.1
Revel. 21.2
one glory in heaven.

Be Jerusalem the Psalm 48.2 137.6
joy of the whole earth; yet Jerusalem which is Gal. 4 26
above, if she would make her self known unto us below, she will Esaias 54.11, 12
Revel. 21.19
take up Jewels, and Riches, and Gold upon trust: So immovable is heaven,
that, name Psalm 46.5
Mount Zion, and you say nothing: Be a Throne glorious, and heaven is Psalm
113.4 Flay 66.1
exalted above that glory; The Crown, there is a Crown which 1 Pet. 5.4
fades not away; The inheritance there is 1 Pet. 1.4
undefiled, incorruptible; The substance there is Heb. 10.34
an enduring substance; The peace there Phil. 4.7
passes man's understanding; Life is there, life immortal, life Romans 2.7 1 Cor.
15.54
eternal; There pleasures swim, in Psalm 16.11
whole Rivers, they Esaias 48.18
roll in upon us like waves of the Sea: Call heaven a house, and the builder
and maker must be Heb. 11.10
a God; Call heaven a House, and that house must be as wide as heaven. The
windows must be Esaias 54.12
Agates, the gates Carbuncle, the battlements pleasantness, and whatsoever
else is precious; the pavement love, joy and glory. The azured firmawent, which
our eyes behold, is but as the rough rags, the made-earth, the unhewen, the
lowest, the buried part, of the foundations of this House! The stars of the
firmament are but as so many sandy dusts everywhere scattered within that
azured, that clayie rubbish! The Moon and Sun, which seem so bright unto us,
unto the inhabitants of this House in my Text, do indeed a little glizzen, but
no otherwise then two shells of an Oyster opened under our feet! If heaven be a
house, it is a mansion house; a glorious house, a holy house, the house of my
God, and, that I may speak home,

My Fathers house.
God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is Exodus 15.11
glorious in holiness, Fearful in praises: What sort of 1 Chronicles. 29.1
Palace! What kind of Temple must that be, which deserves to be called Esaias
66.1
The House of God! And yet our rejoicing lies not so much in the fabrique, as
in the builder; not so much in the builder, as in the owner of this house: The
Owner of this House is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; This is

My Fathers house
First, in regard of God the-Father: Heaven is God the Fathers home: He indeed
Jerem. 23.14
fills all places; but, heaven is the Luke 16.9 Esaias 57, 15
place of his habitation, the Palm 26.8
palace where his honor dwells; the 1 Chronicles. 29.1
palace where he keeps his Court; the Esaias 62.9
Court where he exalts his Throne, his power, and his glory.

Next, in regard of God the Son: As to work out our Redemption, he came down
from heaven; so, having finished that work, he ascended up on high: Oh, it was
a John 20.17
comfort to the son of man, as man, to go unto his Father; for his Father is
John 14 28
greater then he.

Thirdly, in regard of us Believers.

First, We Esaias 64.1
fancy great matters, might Jesus Christ here converse among us in the flesh:
Sirs, God the father loves Jesus Christ as his only Son; Jesus Christ
reciprocally loves him as his dear Father: If we love Jesus Christ more then
we love our selves, we John 14.28
rejoice because he is now at home with his own Father. Fools may prate that
Fathers are good friends, but evil company; it was never so with the Son of
man; For the Acts 3.21 7.55
Humane nature of Jesus Christ, there is no such company as the visible society
of his eternal Father. Show him the father, and John 14.8
it suffices.

Secondly, My Fathers house is Matthew. 6.9
Our Fathers house: Doubtless thou art our Father was a high-strained faith,
even then when Esaias 63.16
derived from Gods creation, at most, from Gods protection of us: But, the
person speaking in my Text has now given us a nearer claim; he can John 20.17
send us word, I go to my Father, and your Father; therefore your Father,
because my Father.

Thirdly, Our Fathers house was never built for Spiders: God does not, like
some of our Gentry, first build a great house, and then, ever after, lay all
hospitality aside. No, He Esaias 25.6
feasteth it, he Revel. 19.9
ever feasteth it, like Revel. 19.17 Esther. 1
an Emperor: In the house of my Father, as none serve him Revel. 1.6
under Priests and Kings, so, all, who serve him, fare like Revel. 3.20
Princes. Upon earth this is the infelicity of Kings that to maintain a
requisite State, they [most what] sit at Table alone; whereas, in heaven,
although Kings we are, yet our meat does us no good except we eat it Heb.
12.22, 23
with company.

In our Fathers house, as our Supper is the Revel. 3.20 19.17
Supper of the Lord, so our society is the Heb. 12.22
communion of the Saints; In heavenly places we shall sit Ephesians. 2.6
together with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Abel will there tell us what hard
words and blows he Genesis 4.8
received from Cain; We shall there see Job beholding his Redeemer with his Job
19.27
own eyes: Charles the Of great Britain, France and Ireland, King.
First [the first since that hour wherein Jesus Christ was crucified] that ever
dyed, and so dyed for the good of his people; Him we shall find among, if not
above the noble Army of Martyrs! Yea, we shall there converse with every
glorified soul, with every soul glorified in its own order, in its own
mansions, joying and rejoicing with its own peculiar degree of glory; The elect
of God, which here upon earth were unto us Neighbors, Friends, Kindred,
Brethren, Sisters, Children, Parents, Wives, or Husbands, with these we shall
renew an acquaintance, an acquaintance increasing unto all eternity.

calling and election sure, get an everlasting fellowship in these mansions; in
heaven your knowledge shall be made perfect, nor shall you sit like mutes, but,
you shall speak of the goodness of your God with a fullness of delight, joy
and love.

How happy would some children acknowledge themselves, were the place of their
education adjoining unto the place of their nativity? How much of her Dowrye

her Fathers house? Beloved, in my Fathers house are many mansions, but all of
them in one and the same House; We are there all of us one Society, one Family,
one College, one Household, one Church, one Body: Forget thy Psalm 45.10
Fathers house, and thine own kindred takes no place in these mansions. Duty
and Death separate the nearest relations here, but, in my Fathers house friends
never part.

to us, took of us an especial charge, we shall know by name and by sight in
these mansions.

loving spirit, which did, does, and will continue our preserver, sanctifier
and comforter, will, in Heaven, put life into us indeed! when he once
entertaineth us in my fathers house, then we shall live!

The person speaking in my Text, thorough whom the just God is so well pleased
with us; He who came down from heaven to bring us thither; who underwent for us
the reproaches of men, and the curse of God; who, for our sakes spoke, and
wrought, and suffered wonders; Him, who passed by the fallen Angels, and
exalts our nature above his elect Angels; Him, who did once give himself for
us, and does ever since give himself to us; Him unto whom God has given Nec
patior me quicquam nescire de co quem amew. Plin. Epist.
a name above every name; Him we shall worship, bless, admire, and adore in my
Fathers house!

But, That which puts so great a value upon my Fathers house, is, Bonum
mihi, Domine, in camino habere te ^^^cum, quam esse sine ^e vel i^ caelo.
Bernard.
principally, my father himself; The Refuge, the Rest, the Reward, the Riches,
the Inheritance, the Crown, The Mansions, the many Mansion, the many Mansions
in my Fathers house; The eternal peace, the infinite love, the everlasting joy
there set before us; neither these, nor the fellowship of the Saints, nor the
society of Angels shall be able to Romans 8.39
divert us from gloryfying our God as God: For, as all things appertaining unto
life are therefore bestowed upon us here, that here we may in body, in soul and
in spirit, be Testimonium credibile nimis gustatae sapientiae est esuries ipsa

wholly taken up in obeying, trusting, loving, honoring, worshipping, blessing,
and gloryfying our God as God, so all the peace, pleasures, mansions, joys and
glories which are treasured up for us in our Fathers house, are therefore
freely and everlastingly vouchsafed unto us, that we may with a perfect love,
joy, thankfulness and delight, both admire and adore our everlasting Father.

Lastly, as here upon earth no one mercy can so much require our thankfulness
as the communion betwixt Deus tuus totum tihi crit. S. Aug. in Psalm 26. Et
quem scmper habeat, semper habere volunt.
our spirit and the sanctifying spirit of our most holy God; so, neither can
any thing in heaven more excite our praises and thanksgiving unto him who
sits upon the Throne, then the blessed Vision of our most glorious God, even
of God the Father, of God the Son, and of God the Holy Ghost, ever [for ever!]
blessed and glorified! In His presence is fullness of everlasting joy! To him
be the Kingdom, the power and the glory ever ascribed, Amen.

Dear Christians, hear the Eccles. 12.13

every thought, word and deed misplaced which is not ordered to glorify your
God as God. Oh, let not your heart be troubled, saving that it cannot be
troubled enough for neglecting so merciful a God; stretch out daily, hourly,
stretch out, and stir up your faith; believe in God, he has Esaias 54.8
an everlasting love for you; believe in his Son, he is 1 Cor. 1.30
made unto you wisdom, and sanctification, and redemption, and righteousness;
believe in his Spirit, he is Jude 24.
able to keep you from falling, and to present you to your Bridegroom, and to
his Father, with exceeding joy: Look for, and 2 Pet. 3.12
hasten unto these mansions in my Fathers house; Beloved, this is life eternal,
this will be joy eternal, to see God! Without holiness, it is Heb 12.14
impossible to see God; the Lord Heb 13.21

blessed are the pure in heart, they shall possess these mansions in my Fathers
house, they shall see God!

your duty, make it your business, to glorify the God and father of your Lord
Jesus Christ: so doing, let not your heart be troubled, believe in God, believe
in his Christ, in my Fathers house are many mansions.

Oh thou who speak in my Text, speak Psalm. 33.4

mansions, after that we have 1 Pet. 5.10

who has called us to his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, will receive first our
souls, then our bodies; To him be 11 Pet. 5.11.
glory and dominion for ever and ever, Amen.
