A GODLY and FRUITFUL EXPOSITION Upon all the FIRST EPISTLE OF PETER.

BY That Pious and Eminent Preacher of the WORD of GOD, JOHN ROGERS of Dedham
in ESSEX.

JOHN 5. 39. Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life,
and they are they which testify of me. 2 PETER 1. 20, 21. Knowing this first,
that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.

For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God
spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost.

To the Reader.
THe Name alone of the Author of this Exposition and Commentary, does put a
great price and value on it, yea command thy reading and study of it. It is the
work of John Rogers, Minister of Dedham in Essex, written by his own hand.
Being dead, he yet speaks (...), Heb. 11. 4. in some Copies (...). Oecumen.
ad loc. (...) Theophylact.
; that is, his Name is as a sweet savor poured forth, and his praise amongst
the Saints in all the Churches of Christ; wheresoever he is spoken of, this may
be said of him, That he was a burning and a shining light, having a heart
inflamed with love to Christ, Truth, and the Souls of men; his words were as
sparks of fire. As his light directed his zeal, so his zeal wrought with his
light, and made it powerful: Animum non faciunt, qui animum non habent. Some
Books are like a frosty day, clear, but dry and cold, and leave the Reader in
the same temper. As in preaching, so in writing also, the stirring of the heart
and affections should be endeavored, as well as Information; and such words be
used, and so set, as may rather make a Sermon then a Tract, and beget rather a
love to the Matter (as this Author endeavoreth) then an opinion, or an esteem
of the VVriters abilities. He was a Scribe indeed, taught of God, instructed
and prepared for the Kingdom (that is, the Church) of God, having, yea being a
Treasure of things both new and old (that is, of all sorts of Doctrine, and all
ways of Application of them.) He was a Boanerges, a Son of Thunder Mark 3. 19.
Lucas Brugensis. Beza Grot. ad loc.
, for the power and efficacy God gave unto his Ministry; and a Barnabas, a Son
of Consolation too Acts 4. 36. Consolator, a comitate procul dubio, and eximi^
in crigendis consuentis facultate, etc. Beza ad loc.
: As the Thunder shakes the Pillars of the Earth, overthrows the Rocky
Mountains, causes the wild and savage Beasts to fear; and as the Lightning
powerfully insinuates it self, breaking the bones, but not the flesh: So was it
the pleasure of the Lord to bring down by his Ministry, the high and stout
hearts of many rebellious ones, and to lead them in subjection to his will
through Christ; To throw down, and to build up by him even as high as Heaven.
As the Scriptures give us the Genealogies of the Saints, so many came out of
Adam, Abraham, etc. How numerous are the Children whom this Author has had
given him by God? Many Families, persons of all sorts and ranks, in many
Counties and Nations; even so far as his sound went forth, will and do
acknowledge him to have begotten them to God, and call him Blessed.

Reader, read his Works, and thou shall know him; work what thou read on
thy own heart, that thou may be like unto him, one of his children also:
which is the hearty desire of him who cannot but make this honorable mention of
the Author, and is

May, 1650. Desirous of thy good in Christ, SIDRACH SIMPSON.

A Godly and Fruitful EXPOSITION ON THE FIRST EPISTLE OF St. PETER.
THe general scope and intent of this Epistle, The general scope of this
Epistle.
is, To confirm those Christian Jews whom he had procured to the Faith by his
Ministry, that they might persevere in the same to the end, notwithstanding
any troubles they should meet with for the same.

More particularly he lays before them, The particular scope.
The wonderful riches of Gods mercies vouchsafed them in Christ Jesus by his
Death and Resurrection, whereby they were recovered out of their woeful estate
by sin, and brought to an happy and blessed condition, even Salvation through
him. Hereunto he exhorts them constantly to cleave, and not to suffer
themselves to be withdrawn therefrom by any means; as also* that they would
walk worthy so great mercy in an holy life and conversation; both in the
general duties of Christianity, and the particular duties of their special
Callings; and that they would so do, notwithstanding any troubles they should
meet withal for the same.

The parts of this Epistle are two; The several parts thereof, and matter
contained therein.
1. The Preface, in the first two Verses of the first Chapter. 2. The Substance
of the Epistle, in the following Verses and Chapters to the end. This
contains Doctrine and Exhortation: Doctrine, from the Third Verse of the
first Chapter unto the Thirteenth of the same: Exhortations in all the rest of
the Chapters and Verses; and they be of two kinds: 1. Unto general Duties
belonging unto all Christians. 2. Unto special, to several sorts of men and
women, according to their special Callings.

CHAP. I.
Verse 1. Peter, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to the Strangers scattered
throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bythinia. Ver. 2. Elect
according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the
Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto
you and Peace be multiplied.
THese verses contain the Preface, The sum and parts of the Preface.
in which two things; 1. An Inscription. 2. The Salutation. In the former we
have a description, 1. Of the person writing, and that both by his Name, Peter,
and by his Office, An Apostle of Jesus Christ. 2. Of the parties to whom he
does write, and that both by their outward state to the World-ward, viz.
Strangers scattered up and down in strange Countries, namely, Pontus, Galatia,
Cappadocia, Asia and Bythinia; and by their estate to Godward, viz. Parties
belonging to salvation, which he sets forth by the causes thereof and degrees,
namely, 1. Their Election. 2. Sanctification. 3. Redemption by the obedience of
Christ Jesus, which showed it self in his shedding his blood for them. In the
latter, a brief but pithy Prayer to God for his favor, as the fountain from
whence all happiness was to be bestowed, yea multiplied upon them.

Peter] Three Names are given unto this our Apostle in Scripture: The several
Names of this our Apostle.
1. Simeon of Simon, that he had at his Circumcision. 2. Cephas, by
interpretation a Stone, Acts 15. 14.
which our Savior Christ gave him at his calling, thereby signifying what he
meant to do for him, John 1. 42.
namely, to make him a stout defender of the Faith, on the behalf whereof
(though he was born of Parents of small note) he proved one of notable courage:
This is in the Chaldee or Syriack tongue. 3. Peter, which in Greek is all one
with the former, 2 Pet. 1. 1.
so that these two Names were in effect but one: In his second Epistle he names
himself Simon Peter.

Here learn,

1. Christ's kindeness to Peter, in giving him a Name to assure him of some
grace which he would bestow upon him: Though we cannot do so, What Names
Parents are to give to their Children.
yet it behooves us to give our Children such names as may edify them, and put
them in mind of some good thing; either to imitate some good man or woman
whose Name they bear, or else to follow some good that the Name puts them in
mind of.

2. In that he puts his Name to his Epistle, he shows his godliness and
innocence, Such as set forth Books ought to set their Names thereto.
which makes him bold, for Truth may be blamed, but cannot be shamed: Contrary
to many Heretics, and false Apostles and Teachers, the Devils disciples, which
pen Books stuffed with Errors, either under the Names of the Apostles, that so
they may the sooner beguile and get credit to their Lies; or else without
Names, lest being found out by their Names, they should suffer, and be brought
to punishment for their Errors; or their infamous Names being seen in the
forefront of their Book, should cause any judicious and honest Reader with
indignation to cast it away. The Apostle, I say, contrariwise having the sound
and holy Oracles of God from Heaven to deliver unto them, puts to his Name.
There are many worthy Works, Why some worthy men have not done thus.
I confess, which have no Names put to them (those especially which were
written in the times of Persecution) whereof the Authors, howsoever desirous to
spread the Truth of God hated and persecuted, hereby notwithstanding shunned
the hands of cruel tyrants. This is not for any fault in the matter, but only
avoiding danger in speaking of the truth. This is no disgrace to them, but to
their times, and their enemies; for men need not cast themselves into peril
till God call them.

This condemns the vile practice of the wicked, Use.
which hide themselves in the dark, and in corners, lewdness not abiding the
light: We must do nothing, but that we dare put our hands to it, and our Names.
We must do as the Angel did that rolled away the stone, and sat upon it when
he had done, as if he should have said, Let me see who will control that which
I have done. We must do so, as we may bid our Adversary write a Book against us
for any gross or unlawful thing we have done and stand in. Alas! what a folly
is this, you flee men's eyes, but can you flee the eyes of the Almighty? And if
you cannot abide men's censure, how shall you be able to stand before the
Judgment seat of Almighty God, who is a consuming fire?

An Apostle of Jesus Christ] The word is general, Wherein the Apostles differed
from all other Ministers
and signifies one sent; but here (as elsewhere often) it is taken specially
for one, and the principal sort of Ministers, differing from all others in
these particulars: 1. They were immediately called by Christ own mouth, and
sent abroad: Many were called by him for Disciples, and out of those he chose
his Twelve Apostles. 2. They had a larger measure of the Spirit then others, so
that they could not err in their writings. 3. They had also a larger
Commission, Mat. 28. 19.
Go ye (says our Savior) and Teach all Nations: They were to preach to all the
world; but this Calling is ceased. This notwithstanding it has communion with
all other sorts of Ministers that they were called and sent: No man (says the
Apostle) takes this honor to him, Heb. 5. 4.
but he that is called of God, as was Aaron; and so were also the Prophets.

There are two things required in a Minister: Two things required in a Minister.
1. That he be lawfully called: and 2. That being in, he discharge his duty
faithfully.

Touching a Ministers Calling, He must have an inward calling: and
it must be both inward and outward: 1. He must have an inward Calling from
God; which appears 1. By an aptness and competency of Gifts to teach and edify
the Church of God. 2. By a willing mind to employ the same, seeking not his
own advantage and ease, but the glory of God: This makes the Minister. As when
God calls a King, he gives him the heart of a King: So if he appoint a man to
be a father of Souls, he fits him for it. An outward.
2. He must have an outward Calling from the Church and those that are in place
to allow and disalow Ministers, whose approbation they must have, which is not
to make them, but to approve of them for their further comfort, that they may
more boldly go forward.

The Brownists call us Bishops-Ministers, Use.
because they call us to this Office, but they do but allow and approve whom God
has made.

Both must necessarily concur, the one go along with the other: He that wants
the inward, though he have the outward, is not a true Minister of God (yet his
actions are not to be esteemed nullities and void) and he that in ordinary
times having the inward wants the outward, Perk. Treatise of Callings.
goes not to work humbly as he ought.

Well did Peter declare himself an Apostle, one sent from God, a Messenger, who
was to deal faithfully in his Message; For he publishes not here his own
Inventions, Poets Fables, Heathen Stories, Philosophers Conceits, 1 Pet. 4. 11.
or men's Devices and Opinions, but the holy Oracles of God from Heaven. So must
every Minister of God speak as the words of God; What is the Chaff to the
Wheat, either ones Opinion to establish another Conscience?

But why does he call himself by this great Name of his Office, and put this
high style before his Epistle? Why he names his Apostleship.
Not for vain ostentation, or for his own sake, but for the peoples good, even
to procure with them the more authority to that which he was to write; for who
should dare to refuse that which comes from the Lord Jesus, the eternal Son of
God, the Light of the world, the Savior and Judge thereof? Nay, who should not
with all high reverence submit himself thereunto? So did the Prophets begin,
The word of the Lord, Thus says the Lord, whereby they set their peoples faith
on work to look to God, and not to men.

Hence let the Ministers of God learn to procure what credit and authority to
their Ministry they can, Use.
signifying often, that it is Gods will, thereby drawing their peoples minds
upward from the instrument. They must deliver such soundness of Doctrine, as
may be food it self, not froth, which accordingly they must deliver in a grave
and religious manner; adding thereunto, as Prayer, so also a godly life, and all
little enough, considering the profaneness of our hearts, that so little
regard what we hear, yea hear without preparation or reverence, being of us no
sooner gone then forgotten.

But how dares he call himself an Apostle, Q.
that had deserved by his most shameful threefold denial of his Master, to be
utterly discarded of his Office; and utterly cast away for ever?

By the grace of God he does this, A.
by Faith apprehending the mercy of God toward him; and he does it to publish
his grace and favor, who had upon his true Humiliation and Repentance not only
forgiven his sin, and received him to mercy, but restored him to his Office
again. Mark 16. 7.
Go your way (said the Angel unto the Women) tell his Disciples, and Peter,
that he goes before you into Galilee: And afterward our Savior by a threefold
Commission restored him to his Office, John 21. 15, 16, 17.
from which by his threefold Denial he had shut himself.

Hence note, That

Repentance will wipe away our sins, Repentance wipeth away our sins.
and make them as if they had never been, Joel 2. 12, 13, 14. Mic. 7. 18, 19. 1 John 1. 9. which

1. Shows Gods unspeakable mercy toward penitent Sinners. Use 1.


2. Is a matter of endless comfort to us, Use 2.
which through our corruption fail and sin daily. As verily as we be
unfeignedly humbled with desire of forgiveness, and not to sin, so verily may
we believe our selves pardoned; Mat. 6. 12.
for which accordingly we are enjoined daily to pray; yea if we have been
overtaken more foully for want of watchfulness, yet let us not despair as Cain,
or run from God as Judas, which is worst of all, but address our selves to come
with a heavy and bleeding heart to God, 2 Samuel 12. 13.
with whom there is mercy. David having confessed his sin, Nathan said unto
him, The Lord also has put away thy sin, 1 Ioh. 2. 2.
thou shall not dye. Unto every penitent soul his Son will be a propitiation
for their sins. Luke 15. 20.
As the prodigal was embraced of his father, so will our heavenly father
receive us, if we return unto him.

3. May be a most effectual means to humble such as have run on in their sins,
Use 3.
without humiliation, that at the length they may take this course; Ier. 3. 22.
Return ye backsliding Children (says the Lord) and I will heal your
backslidings: See to this purpose Hos. 14. 1, 2.

Oh, Ob.
but I have been thus and thus bad, will some say.

No matter what thou have been, Sol.
so now thou with thy whole heart turnest to God, and neither art now, nor
hereafter intendest to be as heretofore. Time past shall not be remembered.

Oh, Ob.
but I have committed many great sins.

It Is not that shall stand between God and thee, Sol.
if thou be truly humbled, Gods mercy and the merit of Christ is as well able
to take away and heal great as small offenses. Ezra 9. 6.
Though our Iniquities be increased over our heads, and our Trespass grown up
unto the Heavens, yet if with Ezra we be truly humbled, ibid. 10. 2.
there is assured hope of pardon.

To the Strangers, etc.] Though happily there might be some Gentiles amongst
these, yet it is more probable that they were most Jews, which were principally
his charge, Gal. 2. 7.
as the Gentiles the Apostle Paul's.

They are called Strangers, Why called Strangers.
not as all Christians be, while they be here on Earth, Psalm. 119. 19.
absent from their heavenly Country and Inheritance (for so are we Strangers
in our own Country, Towns and Houses) but Strangers, as being in a strange
Countery, forced by persecution to leave their own and fly into another, which
might be either through the Wars and Troubles which were raised in their own
Country, or by the persecution raised in Jerusalem about the death of Steven.

Here see,

1. That sundry of the Jews received our Savior Christ and believed in him,
Though the body of the Jews did not receive Christ, yet there were among them
sundry believers.
and were soundly converted, though the body of them did not (for he came unto
his own, and his own received him not) those made a good progress in the course
of Christianity, who were contented (even with the loss of their liberties) to
undergo such dangers as might befall them in a strange Land, Ioh. 1. 11.
only that they might keep faith and a good conscience.

2. The estate of the Church of God here on Earth, Gods Church here on earth is
under persecution.
namely, to be under persecution; In the world (says our Savior) ye shall
have tribulation. Always there has been enmity between the seed of the woman
and the seed of the Serpent. Ioh. 16. 33.
Thus was it when the Church was but in one Family, in one Country, one
Nation. The world having Power, Authority, Wealth, is full of malice against
the poor Church, so that were it not that God Almighty defends it, it could not
endure; It Is as a Sheep amongst wolves, or a Ship among the waves. Though God
will exercise it to keep it from errors, and corruptions, which it is subject
unto through much prosperity and peace; though it have need of some peace to
gather it self, Act. 9. 31.
yet if it be long in peace it gathers mud as standing waters, rust as the
ploughshare in the hedge, yea settles it self on the lees, therefore God pours
it out from Vessel to Vessel. Ever mark, after long prosperity grew pride, and
thereupon errors and corruptions, which like a canker brought destruction.
Contrarily, the Church never shines so gloriously as either in, or presently
after persecution; Then life, zeal, sincerity, heavenly-mindedness, and such
like graces appear in their true luster.

It follows,

1. That as we are not to conclude for a company, Use. 1.
because they have so much peace, that therefore they are beloved of God; so
must not we against any, because they be few in number, and outwardly despised
and slighted. 1 King. 18. 19.
Four hundred false Prophets were maintained by Jezabel, whereas Micaiah the
only true Prophet of the Lord was put in Prison; Jeremiah and Baruch were the
true servants of the Lord, whom whole multitudes of proud men and false
Prophets resisted.

2. That we are to prepare our selves for persecution, Use. 2.
especially having had so long a time of peace. To this end we must resolve to
part with all for Christ's sake, and for his Cause and Religion. Thus did these
Jews, thus the holy Martyrs; and great reason: For what would it advantage us,
Mat. 5. 12.
if we should gain the whole world, in the mean time losing our souls by
denying Christ. Iam. 1. 12.
On the contrary, If we forsake any thing for Christ here, Mat. 10. 39.
we shall have a Crown of everlasting glory, Great is our reward in Heaven. But
how far are most of us from any such matter; many are destitute of knowledge,
and how can they suffer? Many have no love to the truth, but are carnal and
profane persons, which never could yet be wrought upon by the word to embrace
it, or be ruled by it, that will not leave their vile lusts for it, and how
shall these leave their goods and liberties! Nay, that which is most to be
lamented, how few professors be like to stand to it, many are more likely a
great deal to flinch! Alas, what poor faith is in most; especially how are most
given over to the world, being too eager and earnest for these things,
neglecting good duties, and slubbering them over for the worlds sake; How will
these forsake it altogether, and leave Houses and Lands, when they will not lay
aside their businesses for an hour or two to hear the word, or a quarter of an
hour for prayer in their Families? O let us therefore labor, as for good store
of Faith, so to come to a contempt of this world; In the mean time, use we it
moderately and in his place, denying our selves by little and little, else we
shall never come to it all at once; but for our livings sake shall be subject
to fall from God, and renounce our Religion, a fearful state.

3. The lawfulness of flying in time of persecution: The lawfulness of flying
in the time of persecution.
The Jews here did it, to save themselves from danger: It Is lawful for a
Minister or any other tied by calling, either when persecution is only or
chiefly intended against him, or having consent for a time to go aside, seeing
it to be best for the rest: It Is lawful for any, either when God makes a way
for them that seems to call them thereto (whereunto if they should not yield,
we are to think they have some extraordinary motion of the Spirit of God to the
contrary, as it is written of some of the Martyrs) or find themselves as yet
not strong enough to endure their rage; Those, I say, may sly to be reserved
as a seed to propagate the Church afterward.

Throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bythynia.] The places
whereunto they fled for habor, were Regions and Countries in Asia the less,
where there were then famous Churches.

Note hence,

1. The large extent of the Church of God in the time of the New Testament, The
large extent of the Church under the New Testament.
that whereas before it was kept within the pale of Judea, in the New, since
our Saviors ascension, it is dispersed over all Nations far and wide, from the
Sunrising to its going down; that it might be fulfilled which God spoke to
Abraham, that in his seed all the Nations of the world should be blessed. Genesis
12. 3.


But what is become of those Churches of Asia now? Quest.


They are all (lamentable to be spoken) under the tyranny of the Enemy of God
and Christ Jesus, Ans.
the Turk; They are now no Churches, but Synagogues of Satan, cages of unclean
birds; so are also the Churches to whom Saint John wrote in his Revelation; Be
we not therefore high minded, Romans 11. 21.
but fear; for if God has not spared the natural branches, take heed lest he
also spare not us; yea considering our luke-warmness, unthankfulness, contempt
of the Word, and such other our crying sins, we have cause to fear the like
judgment.

2. The singular diligence and care of this holy Apostle, The Apostles
diligence and care in his charge.
over the charge committed to him: Not only did he preach to them, being
present with them, but wrote also being absent, being in persecution, and
scattered throughout strange Countries; he encourages them unto constancy, and
that they should not faint under their troubles; of such helps there is great
need in such cases, and at such times. He was careful, not only to gain them
to God and the Faith, but to hold them fast, See Act. 14. 22
that as they were begotten, so they might be nourished up in the faith; as
they were converted, so he was careful to confirm them, this being no less
necessary then that: For Non minor est virtus, quam quarere, parta tueri.
having offended, but again put in trust with the sheep, he is now careful of
his Commission, Use.
which is set down for the example of all Ministers, even as we love Christ, so
will we, must we, feed his sheep and lambs. We must labor by all diligence and
faithfulness to convert and build up, yea in times of sickness or any
affliction, when Satan waits to tempt them, and they be weak, we are to come
and strengthen them, we are to shore them up, that they reel not, to comfort
them that they despair not: But how do they perform this duty, that never come
at their charges, seldom or never preach, put it off to another, though never
so unfit? how also they, that either preach not, or but unprofitably, which
come not to a poor or mean man's house upon any occasion? How shall they be able
to answer the great Shepherd of the sheep, when they shall be called to an
account? See Heb. 13. 17.

Elect, etc.] Here he describes them by their inward estate to Godward. I will
not here handle the common place of Election, I have done it at large, and I
reserve such things to Catechizing; only now of such things as are necessarily
occasioned by the text: whereof this may be one, That

God has chosen out some men to salvation, God has chosen some to salvation.
as he did of the Angels, which are called the Elect Angels. Before the world,
he Ordained and decreed some persons to obtain salvation, 1 Timothy 5. 21.
even the vessels of mercy, Romans 9. 23.
which he had before prepared unto glory; See to this purpose Acts 13. 48. Ephesians.
1. 4. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 9.

This must needs be so, Reason.
for whatsoever falls out in the world, universally or particularly, God in his
eternal and unchangeable decree Ordained the same. And if wise men do not
(especially) great things, whereof they have not before deliberated, much lels
does God.

Let us hold fast this truth inviolable, Use.
according to the Scriptures, casting away all carnal conceits of cruelty or
the like in the Lord, and with the Apostle Paul, Romans 11. 33.
what we cannot understand, learn we to adore and admire.

Q. But how could the Apostle know they were Elect, may one know the Election
of another?

A. For our own we may, How we may know the Election of others.
as we shall hear by an by; for others we may also, though not with the same
knowledge and judgment of certainty, because the heart of man is known to none
but to God only, and a man may go far who yet may fall away; but with the
judgment of charity, which has degrees according to the fruits we see in
them, if they only profess Religion, and be in the Church, we may hope, but it
is but weak hope where we see no fruits; where we see some good likelihoods of
religion, some good beginnings, we may more strongly be persuaded; for to such
a man may say, If these things be in you, in truth you are the very Elect of
God: Now when we see the fruits of faith, sanctification and godliness in men,
and that they show it not by fits, but constantly; not in some things, but in
all; not in prosperity only, but in adversity too, in persecution, and under
the Cross, we may the more, yea very boldly judge of them as the Elect of God;
and so does out Apostle here, as appears by the next words, Unto Sanctification
of the Spirit: He saw good signs of Sanctification in them, and that they
suffered persecution for Religions sake, therefore he so hoped of them, he so
styles them.

We should not only labor to have sound testimonies to our selves of our
Election and Salvation, Christians must so live, as that even others may be
persuaded that they belong to God.
but so live, as we may get a good and full testimony thereof in the conscience
and mind of the Church and Brethren with whom we live; For a good name in the
Church is a precious thing, and much to be desired: The voice of the Church is
the voice of God. Heb. 11. 2.
We are so to live, that whatsoever befalls us, as to die suddenly or
strangely, or to have great and extraordinary afflictions while we live, our
lives notwithstanding may have spoken so well for us, as we may have good
report while we live, and when we be dead; See Pro. 10. 6.
So have many poor godly ones in Scripture, and in our times, when great and
mighty ones that have been wicked, their names be rotten, and so not at all, or
else stinking, and so as a dunghill or puddle, which the more it is stirred, the
more it stinketh: They therefore that live vilely in their lusts, bring an ill
name upon themselves, who can judge they are Elect, or shall be saved? yea many
be desperate, they care not what men say, as bad a sign as can be; such also as
walk hollowly, and by halfs, in some things well, and in some other taking such
liberty as will not stand with Christianity or a good conscience; These cause
that the Church of God cannot conceive so well, nor give so full a testimony of
them as were to be desired, but are forced to speak doubtfully. Oh let us so
walk, that by sincerity and constancy in godly courses, we my get a large and
full testimony in the conscience of those we live withal: It Is a Crown and
Garland to us whiles we live, and a confirmation to us, that we deceive not our
selves; It Is an honor when we die, as the contrary, even to be accounted vile,
a fearful punishment; yea it is a comfort and crown, to our Wives, Children,
Friends, and a provocation to them to follow our steps whom they hear so well
spoken of.

According to the foreknowledge of God] God in his foreknowledge and eternal
decree has (as ye heard) appointed some to Salvation. See Mat. 25. 34


Q. Why did God before all worlds thus decree of men? Why God decreed to save
some.


Ans. Of his own will, Romans 9. 16.
which is the first and highest cause; It Is not in him that wills, Ephesians. 1. 5.
nor in him that runs, but in God that shows mercy. Having predestined
us unto the adoption of children, by Jesus Christ to himself, Romans 9. 2.
according to the good pleasure of his will: He has power over us, as the
Potter over the clay. As he did not therefore choose some, because he foresaw
they would receive grace, so neither is foreseen infidelity the cause why God
refuses any, but because he would; for though he neither hates nor casts
away any but for their sin, yet this was not the cause of the Lords decree, but
his own will, which is that which makes any thing just and good. Our will
indeed being so corrupt, must not be a reason of our actions, but in God his
is, whose will makes a thing good, and not because a thing is good, therefore
he wills it. Beyond this will of his we must not enquire, but in humility lay
our hand upon our mouth, and admire the depth of his wisdom, and be content to
stay for further knowledge of these things in the world to come: In the mean
time sit we down quietly, believing what God has revealed in his Word.

It follows,

1. That if any can prove his election, Use 1.
he must stand and admire at the unsearchableness of Gods free mercy, that he
should think upon him a poor worm before the beginning of the world, and one
that should be of the common stock of Adam, a sinful wretch; think of him I
say, to choose him to life passing by so many. Oh how should this ravish our
hearts, and inflame us with love!

2. That if any be rejected, Use 2.
they must not complain of cruelty in God, for that they are rejected; Is the
clay to say to the Potter, why have thou made me thus? Romans 9. 20.
Beside, thou art not condemned but for the just deserts and sins which thou
have committed against God; all that can be said, is this, He gives not his
grace to them, as he does to his elect, whereof who shall complain? God is
bound to none.

Unto the Sanctification of the Spirit] The end why we were elected, The ends
why we were Elected.
is, 1. In respect of God his glory. 2. In respect of our selves, our
Salvation, which we come unto by Santificaction, See Ephesians. 1. 4
which is the end of our Redemption. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3. 7.
All that were elected, in time he brings into the world; Luke 1. 74, 75.
we come in enemies to God, children of wrath, polluted; but he lets us have
the word, Tit. 2. 14.
whereby he effectually calls us to faith and repentance; Sanctification the
end of our Redemption.
and so purges and washes us by his word outwardly; and his spirit inwardly,
whereby our nature is cleansed from the love of all sin, Romans 8. 30.
and made pure in Gods fight, and we enabled to dye to sin, and live
righteously.

Hereby may every one examine and prove whether he be elect or no, Use. 1.
( viz.) Not by climbing to the top at first, and flying unto the unsearchable
counsels of God (the way to dazzle and confound us) but by the lowest step, our
Sanctification.

Here Is also comfort to them that can prove their Sanctification in truth, Use.
2.
though imperfectly: There Is no condemnation to them, an infallible mark of
their election; which may the more soundly comfort them, because it is
unchangeable as God is, so that all the Devils in Hell shall never be able to
prevail against their Salvation, which is a Bulwark and Castle against all
temptations. Once the child of God and ever so, only labor to walk worthy of
this love, and grow in sanctification, that we may have the more plentiful and
strong argument of our election past, and glory to come.

Here Is also terror to those that walk after the flesh, Use 3.
and the lusts thereof, that lie yet in their sins; they need not make a
question about their election, they may know that as yet they have no mark of
it; such rather carry a mark of reprobation about them.

Break off your sins therefore, Use 4.
and turn to God; who would not leave any sin that would hinder assurance of
Salvation? and who would not do any duty that might assure him thereof? Let
this be a strong and sharp spur to move us to Repentance; and be not
desperately careless, saying, If I be elected I shall be saved let me do as I
will; and if I be rejected, let me do never so well, I shall be damned. These
are flat lies; use thou in humility the ways and means to attain faith and
sanctification, that thou may be assured of thine election, else if thou will
desperately justle against God, see who will go by the worst.

Yea, Use 5.
not only the profane bear a brand of reprobation, but even those that have
some show of holiness, such as like H^rod, hear gladly, and amend many things;
or such as like the Pharisees, make clean the outside of the platter, the
inside being full of filthiness, such as have a show of godliness, yet by some
sins deny the power of it; or such holiness as stands in Ceremony, the
substance being neglected. These kinds of holiness are no marks of Election;
therefore do not we content our selves with these, but labor for true inward
and sincere sanctification, Christ's obedience and sufferings the meritorious
cause of our salv^tion.
which is in the heart, in one thing as in another, in trouble as well as in
prosperity.

Unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ] The meritorious
cause of our salvation is Christ's obedience and sufferings; and his obedience
was chiefly in the offering up of himself: for though the Father had Elected us
to salvation, Romans 5. 19.
and made us happy in Adam, yet we wrought our own overthrow by sin, Phil. 2. 8.
and so deserved the curse of God here and for ever. The only way then to
deliver us from this, and to save us, was by the Lord Jesus, God and man, who
suffered all the wrath that was due to us for our sins, and so discharged us.
To appease this wrath there was in our selves no power; no means else in the
world would serve, even the Angels were unable to help us herein. This has
Christ done for us, and that fully, the dignity of his person being such, that
he is both God and M^n in one person. Of this the blood of the lamb sprinkled
on the Israelites houses was a sign, all Sacrifices tended hereunto, our
Sacraments point thereat; all Scripture lays our Salvation in the Cross, Rev.
1. 5.
Blood and Sufferings of Christ.

Here see,

1. An admirable mixture of Justice and Mercy, Use 1.
so that God is not all mercy, as the world imagines: Therefore, for profane
impenitent ones, they shall bear the just wrath of God themselves, and not by
every late forced, Lord have mercy, have God at command as they imagine: For if
Christ was feign to suffer, and the Father would not be entreated,
notwithstanding his strong cries, but when he stood as our Surety, laid on load
and spared him not at all, shall his profane enemies think to escape as they
list?

2. Gods infinite mercy to mankind, Use 2.
to appoint a way to save some of them, whereas no Angel that fell shall be
saved.

3. It sets out the depth of our misery; Use 3.
therefore they that are still in it have no small piece of work to bring to
pass.

4. It teaches us how to esteem of sin, Use 4.
as being of that weight, that nothing but the blood of Christ will satisfy
for it.

5. Its sets out the infinite and unspeakable love of God, Use 5.
to give us his Son, and of Christ to give himself, seeing no less means would
serve; Who can sufficiently either admire or express the same?

6. Here Is matter of endless consolation to all troubled sinners, Use 6.
when Satan and the terrors of Conscience shall pursue them, to fly to Christ
Jesus and his sufferings. This is their Castle, their quietus est* send Satan
to thy Surety, all is fully discharged in his death: But this is only for
humble bleeding sinners, that turn to God with all their hearts; but as for
proud persons that live still in their lusts, what have these to do to talk of
Christ's death? yet have these it in readiness, Christ has died for us; What,
for such profane ones as make his death a packhorse, and lay on more load,
which is to crucify Christ again? No, let these know, they shall bear the
burden of their own sins; but let the true penitent be of good comfort, and
know, that all his sins (how great soever) be done away: Neither let such
think, that their afflictions are any part of the punishment of sin, for it is
all done away once in Christ, and therefore shall not again be demanded of
them; but they are loving chastisements to humble them for their sins past, and
prevent others for the time to come; both furthering their Salvation.

7. For all that know they have their part in Christ's death, Use 7.
how should this work with them! 1. For sin past, it should vex and grieve our
hearts, for we were the Crucifiers of Christ; Judas, the Soldiers and Jews but
our Servants, whom our sins set on work: It Is our great fault, that we can
think of our sins without being humbled, shall Christ shed tears of blood for
our sins, and we not be troubled for our own? 2. This should make us hate sin
for ever, being as it were the knife and spear that killed Christ; what father
could ever love that knife that should kill his child? 3. How should this
inflame our hearts with love to him again, and carry us on in a zealous care of
obedience all our days? our woeful coldness in Christ's cause and service
deserves to be rebuked. Alas, how little will we do for his sake; we ought to
be ready to leave Goods, Liberty and Life for him; we should herein but do as
he has done for us, yea who began thus to do for us, when we were even his
enemies! How much more any other thing! And may not this stop the mouths of all
profane persons, which will be talking, they hope to be saved by Christ, when
they show no love nor thankfulness to him, but live yet in their sins to anger
him.

8. An exclusion of all feigned and false satisfactions of men's own devising,
Use 8.
whereof the Church of Rome is full, which would strike in for a part with the
merit of Christ's death, which makes a great stir about the Cross, when in the
mean time they make void its efficacy.

Sprinkling, etc.] By this word he alludeth to the sacrifices of the Law, which
all pointed at the sacrifice of Christ; and to show, that as it had been
nothing that a sacrifice had been killed, unless the blood thereof had been
sprinkled upon the people (for so was the manner) so it avails us nothing that
Christ died, Gal. 2. 20.
unless his blood be sprinkled on us by the hand of a true faith, Christ's death
is particularly to be apprehended by Faith.
applying Christ Jesus to our Consciences. Its not Christ that saves, but
Christ's death apprehended by a true and lively faith, for a particular
persuasion hereof are we to labor.

Here also in this verse is an excellent proof of the holy Trinity, A proof of
the holy Trinity.
three persons and one God, which is so to be worshipped; all that do otherwise
worship an Idol, and not the true God.

Again observe, That

Election is attributed to the Father, Election the work of the whole Trinity
Redemption to the Son, Sanctification to the Holy Ghost. It Is not but that
they be the common works of the whole Trinity, as all the works of God toward
the Creatures are, Jude 1.
in which respect Sanctification is also attributed to the Father; but because
of their immediate working. The Father elected in the Son, and by the Holy
Ghost, Father, Son and Holy Ghost elected. The Son is the immediate worker of
our Redemption, he shed his blood, as the Holy Ghost the immediate worker of
Sanctification.

Grace unto you and Peace be multiplied.] The usual salutation of the Jews,
asking the favor of God as the root and peace, that is, all happiness, as that
which flows from thence, for so by peace the Jews meant, Peace be with you,
Peace be to this house, etc.

Hence note,

1. That we should seek the favor of God, Why Gods favor is to be sought.
as that which draws on other things, yea all things, for in love is no lack;
Men may have other things without this, but they will have an ill farewell, as
they that have possession, but no right title to that which they possess.

2. What a Minister should chiefly desire for his people; Ministers must labor
that their People maybe brought into Gods favor.
even that they may be brought into Gods favor by Christ, have their sins
forgiven, Christ made theirs, and they assured thereof, with so much prosperity
as may stand with happiness; So Husbands and Wives each for other; So also
Parents for their Children: The favor and grace of God is the principal and
root of all good. Men may have abundance of outward things, but if they flow
not from Gods love they will have a hard farewell. Psalm. 30. 5.
This brings sufficiency, In his favor is life: yea this were sufficient if it
came alone, but in Gods love is no want of any thing needful; worldlings indeed
do greatly seek after wealth for their children, and rejoice to see them
wealthy and healthy, though in the mean time they see in them no true tokens of
Gods favor, but alas what are these! It should more glad us to see an humble,
godly heart, turned from sin and embracing righteousness, though sickly and
poor, then to flow in all the wealth of the world, and be ungracious, and to
come home in a Gold chain, or to hear that our child were like Joseph, the
second man in the Kingdom, without grace: But men do for their children as for
themselves, labor more for goods then grace. But what shall we say to those
Ministers that check their people for forwardness, and seek to discourage them?
what also to those Parents, that are so far from desiring grace for their
children, as they check and discourage them for their forwardness thereunto?
such would like them rather if they saw them jolly as the world; See Pro. 10. 1.
Oh a hard part of Parents!

Be multiplied.] He desires not that they be once taken into Gods favor, and
his other graces begun in them, but that they be continued, and daily increased
more and more? He was covetous to have his spritual children thrive apace, and
grow very rich in grace; Such covetousness, Ministers must labor that their
people may grow in grace.
even a desire to join grace to grace, is both for our selves and others
commendable. So should a Minister desire that his people may not be a little
better then the worst, but to exceed others by far, that they may answer the
time and means; and to this end, as to pray, so to call upon them continually,
and they not to think amiss of this, but to rejoice in it as a special fruit of
his Love; so must Parents to their Children: God gives us leave to be covetous
in these things, and to join grace unto grace, 2 Pet. 1. 5.
as men do house unto house, so shall we honor him much, for a little grace
will go but a little way. Thus shall we benefit our Neighbors much, when our
branches spread far, and our lips feed many. Thus shall we have a large
Testimony to our selves of our Salvation while we live, and make a wide
entrance for our selves into the glorious Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ. 2 Pet. 1. 10, 11.


Verse. 3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
according to his abundant mercy, has begotten us again unto a lively hope, by
the Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
NOw follows the substance of the Epistle, The sum and substance of the whole
Epistle.
consisting of Doctrine and Exhortation: Doctrine to the thirteenth Verse;
Exhortations in the Verses following. The Exhortations are to continue constant
in the profession of the Gospel of Christ, and to stick close to that Salvation
purchased by Christ, and revealed therein; and that they would lead an holy and
and godly life, answerable to this profession and Gospel, both in their general
and particular callings; yea now in their present troubles, and notwithstanding
any other they might mere with hereafter. Now this being a very weighty
building, therefore he had need lay a foundation fitting for the same, and so
he does, which is this, namely, The singular benefits that we receive by Jesus
Christ his Death and Resurrection, viz. Assurance of Salvation, Hope, Joy,
Peace, etc. and at last everlasting life in the Kingdom of Heaven; all which
are revealed and wrought in us by the Gospel, which is no new Doctrine, but
that which of old was revealed to all the Prophets, though now more clearly and
fully manifested. Therefore seeing God has done so great things for us by
Christ Jesus, and these things are revealed in the Gospel, which is very
ancient, good reason they should cleave to Christ, and be carried after no
other way of Salvation, accordingly walking worthy of the benefits they have
both already reaped hereby, and may further hereafter. The Doctrine sets
forth the great benefit that we reap by Jesus Christ; namely, That we are begot
to a lively hope of Salvation, and of being partakers of such an inheritance,
as is without comparison, which is every way set forth, according to its
excellency; where we have, 1. The benefit, That we are begotten to a lively
hope: 2. The moving cause, The abundant mercy of God: 3. The means whereby,
namely, The Resurrection of Jesus Christ: 5. The end, That we may partake of
Salvation, which he calls an Inheritance, and describes it by several
properties.

Blessed be God] For the manner of speech, Gods blessing man.
we read of three kinds of blessing in Scripture: Ephesians. 1. 3.
1. God blesses man, when he bestows upon him his favors and good things,
Man's blessing man.
earthly and heavenly: 2. Man blesses man, and that either ordinarily when he
prays to God to bless him (Thus Moses is appointed to bid Aaron bless the
people; Number. 6. 23.
and the form of prayer is set down; Mat. 5. 44.
Thus Parents bless their children; and we are to bless them that curse us) or
extraordinarily, when by the Spirit of Prophecy the Prophets of God have not
only prayed to God for a blessing on their posterity, but have pronounced a
blessing upon them, foretelling what their state should be in time to come. As
Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, Genesis 27. 28. and 49. 3.
Jacob also his Sons, and Moses the twelve Tribes at his death: Deuteronomy. 33. 1, 2,
etc.
3. Man blesses God, when he ascribes that honor, praise and thanksgiving
which is due to him for his Mercy, Wisdom, Man's blessing God.
Justice, Truth; not when we give him any thing he has not (that cannot be)
but when we ascribe and give that to him which is most justly due to him
already. Thus understand we the phrase here, as elsewhere often.

For the matter, Being to repeat the great benefits that come to us by Jesus
Christ, he does it not barely, but begins with praise and thanksgiving for the
same, Blessed be God, etc. says he, as if he should have said, For these
unspeakable and great benefits bestowed on us unworthy ones, Oh my soul,
Spirit, and all that is in me, come forth to render thanks to God; Teaching us,
That

When we speak, or have any occasion to think (as we ought often to speak and
think) of Gods mercies, Gods mercies to be thought on and spoken of with
admiration.
especially his special mercies that concern our Salvation, we should do it
with admiration, and setting forth his praise. Thus both David and Paul: Even
his outward benefits ought to stir us up unto thankfulness; how much more ought
we to be stirred up for spiritual favors and deliverances from the bondage and
thraldom of Sin. Psalm. 103. 1, 2.
Satan and Hell; Ephesians. 10. 3.
how can we do any less? 1 Timothy 1. 17.
All creatures, Psalm. 107. 1, 2.
Sun, Moon, Fouls, praise God in their kind, and yet they have only been
created; what we then that have been redeemed when we were lost?

They that have felt their bondage, and find themselves delivered, cannot but
break out into his praise. Indeed, the common sort that have those things but
in their brain only, and never had the feeling of the one or of the other,
they can speak of these things but faintly, and from the teeth outward, and not
from the heart as others; but for any to boast of great matters done for them,
and yet show no whit that they be ravished with love to God, neither breaking
out into his praises in words, nor showing it in their lives, they do certainly
lie and deceive their own souls, Psalm. 116. 10.
for they that have had experience of the sour and of the sweet cannot but
speak. See Luke 1. 46. 47.
I believed, therefore have I spoken, 2 Cor. 4. 13.
says David. Impossible it is for any man to think of his Election,
Redemption, Calling, etc. And not be ravished therewith; It Is our duty then to
stir up our selves often, and from time to time, by the deep meditation of Gods
special Mercies, which, as it will shake off dullness, so will it much revive us
to duty.

And Father of our Lord Jesus Christ] Mark, that he cannot speak of God, Romans
15. 5, 13, 33.
but with some token of reverence and title of his. Thus, as he is elsewhere
styled, 2 Cor. 1. 3.
The God of Hope, the God of Peace, the God of Patience and Consolation, 1 Timothy
1. 17.
the King everlasting; so is he here, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. We
must not think or speak of God but with reverence.
His practice must be our patren, we must never think or speak of the holy and
blessed name of God, but with all high reverence, his greatness compared with
our baseness might induce us hereunto.

This condemns as well the Blasphemy of Swearers, Use.
as the unreverent takers of Gods Name in vain, after what manner soever.

He is termed, Why God is termed the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, not only nor so much in respect of his
Manhood, viz. that he took the lump whereof his humanity was framed, which was
of the substance of the Virgin, and first Sanctified and freed the same from
all stain or blemish of Original corruption, and actually United it from the
first conception thereof to the Godhead and second person, and so framed the
humanity of Christ of this substance, and infused into him a reasonable soul;
but especially in respect of his Godhead, by an unspeakable communicating of
the whole essence of the Father to him before all worlds, which mystery though
we cannot fully understand, we must believe and adore.

Here he is styled, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ (as formerly he was
wont to be called, and known by the name of the God of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob, to distinguish him from all false gods) whereby he shows himself more
clearly to us, and the way how we should get into his favor, namely, by his
son, there being no other way whereby our persons or service can please God.

If therefore we would obtain any thing at Gods hands, Use.
we must not come barely to the Father, as for forgiveness of sins, mercy or
any thing else, but with respect of his son Jesus Christ, by whom only he is
and will be merciful unto us.

Speak we something of his three titles, Gods Son why termed Jesus


1. Jesus a Savior, so called by an Angel from Heaven ere he was born, Mat. 1.
21.
for that he was to save his people from their sins: who is an absolute and
sufficient Savior, Act. 4. 12.
yea the only Savior, neither is there, was there, or shall there be any other.

2. Christ anointed to be our King, Christ
Priest and Prophet, through whom we are made Kings, Reu. 1. 6.
Priests and Prophets. If so, 1. Where be our sacrifices of our selves, of
Prayer and Praise, Morning and Evening in our Families; a Priest must not be
without sacrifice. 2. As Prophets do we teach our Families, do we instruct and
examine them? 3. As Kings do we master our affections? If we be led Captive of
our frowardness, worldliness, and the like, what Kings are we? Look to it.

3. Our Lord. Our Lord.
He is our Lord every way; 1 Pet. 1. 19.
by purchase and by conquest; Col. 2. 15.
He bought us with his precious blood, He also conquered all the Enemies that
held us captive, Heb. 2. 14.
Sin, Satan, Death, and so delivered us. If any great man would by money
ransom, 1 Cor. 15. 26.
or by his sword rescue out of his Enemies hands any captive, he were his Lord;
so is Christ our Lord either way. Whence arises,

1. Comfort to all that know themselves redeemed by him, Use 1.
that he will never lose that which he has so dearly bought, and taken such
pains with every way, to come into the world, to die for us, then so to work,
as we may come to the knowledge of it by his Word and Spirit; Whereby Faith and
Sanctification are wrought in us.

2. Instruction, Use 2.
its our duty to submit our selves to him as our Liegelord, Psalm. 2. 12.
to be his loyal people; we must kiss the son, take up his yoke: He has paid
full dearly for our service and love; Mat. 11. 29.
his we are, being now no more our own. There are too too many that yet do not
so cleave to this Lord and his Word, 1 Cor. 6. 19.
but that they suffer other things, other Lords to carry them away. Many could
be content to have Christ their Savior, but they will not have him their Lord
and King, to rule in them and over them; Psalm. 2. 3.
Let us break their bands asunder (say they) and cast away their cords from us:
Psalm. 12. 4.
And again, Who is Lord over us? Let such to their terror consider that fearful
sentence passed against them ( But those mine Enemies that would not that I
should reign over them, Luke 19. 27.
bring hither, and slay them before me) They are counted Gods Enemies, and
adjudged to be slain before his face; Psalm. 2. 9.
Yea, he will break them with a red of iron, and dash them in pieces like a
potters vessel: Others will let him be their Lord as far as they please, and in
what they list, as if they would appoint their work themselves (as some coy
servants) which the Lord will not endure: Mat. 11. 29.
Well, let us bring our hearts to yield unto him as our Lord, else we shall
never have Salvation by him: There Is no refreshing by him, unless we take up
his yoke, both must go together; they that will not willingly stoop to him, he
will be their Lord and King in despite of them, and that to their confusion.

Now for the afflicted conscience that travels for mercy and pardon, and
desires after Christ more then all the world, do thou as earnestly desire him
to be thy Lord and King; and art thou willing to take up his yoke, and that he
shall rule and reign in thee, and none else, and that in all things; be of good
comfort, thou art one of those whom Christ will save.

Which according to his abundant mercy, etc.] Now we are to observe, 1. The
benefit bestowed for which he blessed God, namely, For begetting us again unto
a lively hope. 2. The moving cause, His mercy, nay abundant mercy. 3. The means
whereby, The Resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead; of which as they lie
in order.

Has begotten us again unto a lively hope] This is the benefit, What means
here by hope.
God has begot them again to the hope of Salvation, for so he means; for by
hope is not strictly meant that grace of hope which proceeds from Faith, which
is that whereby we wait patiently for that which by Faith we believe, but its
here meant of both faith and hope, even assurance of Salvation; Hereunto (says
he) they were begot again.

Whence note, That

We have not the assurance of Salvation of our selves by nature, Assurance of
Salvation comes not by nature.
or by our first begetting; no, by nature we are the children of wrath, enemies
to God, dead in sins and trespasses, having no hope, and without God in the
world: Ephesians. 2. 12.
Nay, to have Faith and hope of Salvation, is the only work of God, as our
Savior unto Peter upon his confession of him, Math. 16. 17.
Flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee, but my father which is in
Heaven: So may we affirm about this particular. See to this purpose Joh. 6. 29.
1 Pet. 1. 7.
Acts 16. 14. Ephesians. 2. 8. Phil. 1. 29. Heb. 12. 2. The titles given unto Faith
show as much, Tit. 1. 1.
as precious Faith, the Faith of Gods elect, Jude 20.
most holy Faith; have we any such thing in our selves?

The means whereby he works this Faith, The means whereby God works Faith.
are, 1. The outward Ministry of the Word. 2. The inward working of Gods
Spirit preparing us by the Law; Romans 10. 17.
then working it by the promises of the Gospel: Father, 2 Cor. 4. 13.
Son, and Holy Ghost work Faith.

God that brings light out of darkness made all of nothing, Ephesians. 6. 23.
and raises up the dead to life, he only works Faith in us, and puts life into
these dead hearts of ours; its a great work of God that we can do nothing
toward it. To be humbled truly in the sight of our sins, is a great work hardly
brought to pass; yet this no part of Faith, but a preparation: Then when we see
them, its a great work of God that we are not swallowed up of desperation, but
that God upholds and works by the Gospel longing after mercy, and so by degrees
gives power to apply it; many that long seek and cannot lay hold, or having,
yet quickly let go, find faith a great work of God.

What shall we say then to the hope that's so common in the world, Use. 1.
almost at every hand? Go through a Parish, and you shall find few but hope to
do well, to be saved, making no doubt of it, having no fears, asking no
questions about it; yea, thank God they have been of this persuasion ever since
they can remember. Surely this is but a false hope, a presumptuous conceit of
their own heads, without ground or bottom in Gods word, an illusion wherewith
the Devil seeks to undo them, getting them to bear themselves fair in hand,
that they might not be troubled till wrath overtake them without help; yea, it
may appear they are not begotten again to it, for being asked, how long it has
been thus with them; they thank God they have ever been of a good belief: and
they have no ground for it, but because God's a merciful God, etc. not
considering that God is as Just as Merciful, and that his justice must first be
satisfied, ere he can show any mercy. Besides, they cannot say it has been
wrought, as God works Faith in his, viz. First, he humbles and brings to the
Gates of Hell, and then lifts up; this is not with them: They also cannot say
nor remember when it was wrought, nor how they came by it, nor that it has
been otherwise with them at any time. Besides, Act. 15. 9.
true Faith purifieth the heart, and he that has it purges himself as he is
pure, 1 Ioh. 3. 3.
which is not in them, but they abide in their sins; at least in the love of
some, and have no Faith for outward things* but use unconscionable shifts: Romans
5. 5.
Therefore whereas true hope makes not ashamed, but in the needful time and
great day will make men lift up their heads with joy; this will be like Egypt,
a deceitful and broken Reed, to lay them under feet that do trust to it:
Contrarily, know we that Faith and Hope are not so easily gotten; they must be
wrought from Heaven, herein both Father, Son and Holy Ghost must join:
therefore woefully do they deceive themselves, that trust to any blind conceit
in stead of the true work of God; as they do desperately that put off
Conversion and Faith till the latter end, as if they had them at command; we
must in time labor for this true work of grace.

But if any can prove themselves begotten truly to this hope, Use 2.
they have great cause of thanksgiving, whereinto the Apostle here breaks out;
Oh what a thing is it, not only to give his only Son to the death for us, but
to reveal it to us in his word, and thereby to assure us that we have our part
in the same, and we poor sinners may come to know our sins forgiven, and that
we shall be saved: Oh unspeakable favor I What is like this? Or what can make a
man miserable that has this? prize we this as a Jewel, nourish we it by all
good means, especially by keeping a good Conscience; rejoice in it, as being of
more worth then all the world: let not a few wants or afflictions daunt us, or
take away this joy. It Is a fault in Christians that they will be heavy if they
want something they would have: Oh! Is it not enough that God loves thee?
Again, a little cross casts us down and quells us, as if we had nothing to
comfort us; Oh, no earthly thing should daunt us, while we know this: He that
said, I could be content to lie as a fire-block in Hell till the day of
Judgment, so I might be sure to be saved then, would have been glad of
assurance in this life though with many crosses.

If any have not yet this hope, Use 3.
let them give no rest to themselves till they have attained it; there is no
peace without it* Sin lies at the door, See B. Halls Heaven upon Earth cap. 4.
and 6.
a wounded conscience will arrest us, though we may still it for a season;
pacify it we cannot, till our sin be taken away and forgiven: Assuredly their
estate is most dangerous which neither have it nor seek after it.

A lively hope] so called, Why termed a lively hope.
not only for that it is the hope of life, but because it does exceedingly
cheer and comfort the heart of him that has is, and puts more life into him
then any other thing can do. Herein it is opposed against all other vain hopes
of the world, in outward and transitory things, which yield no sound
contentment to them that have their part deepest in them. Herein also from the
forged hope of Salvation, that the world fain to themselves, which also has no
life in it, no heartning in it: But true Faith and hope do exceedingly revive
the heart which before was dead without any true comfort, See Mat. 9. ^.
yea being stung by the Law, Psalm. 4. 7 and 51. 7. 8.
and so full of terror and discomfort, joy and gladness comes from persuasion
of pardon. Neither comforts this only in prosperity, See Psalm. 112, 7. 8.
when the world can be merry, but even in adversity and trouble, when they be
dismayed, and dead, as it were, on the nest; Through this they can even in
Prison with Paul and Silas sing Psalms, Acts 16. 25.
as through this the Martyrs endured the fire; Daniel and the Three Children
went cheerfully to suffer: This also makes a Christian lively to serve God,
Psalm. 51. 15.
and in every duty to praise him, as David, Open thou my lips, says he (namely
with assurance of thy love) and my mouth shall show forth thy praise: So to do
good to others, as being fitted to teach them as well the way of Gods justice
against sin, ibid. 13.
as the way of his mercy to them that repent; yea hereby we shall be fit to
every good duty, Psalm. 119. 32:
I will run the way of thy commandments when thou shall enlarge mine heart,
namely, by the persuasion of thy love, and by thy Spirit and the hope of
Salvation.

Its a fault in Christians, Use.
that they be no more cheerful in this hope, but lumpish and soon daunted in
afflictions; a fault I say, that we are no more active and lightsom in Gods
business.

Let every one then labor for it; till this we are not alive, our soul never
prospers, nor sees good day: This, even this, is the beginning of life, and the
first step to eternal life. Would any man live, and be cheerful, and see good
days, and have that which might keep him from being daunted in adversity,
persecution, death at the day of Judgment, let him by all means get this:
Without this, men's hopes are vain; their stout courage will fail them in those
times when God shall frown. Its Faith only, which will carry a man through all
things: Hereby he shall have a heart to serve God, yea, both do and suffer the
greatest things for him and his sake.

According to his abundant mercy] The moving cause of this benefit of our
calling to Faith and hope, Gods free favor the cause of all our good.
is Gods mercy, nay, hit abundant mercy. The cause of all the good that ever
came to us, or ever shall come, is no other but only free favor: Why did he
elect us before the world, Ephesians. 1. 4, 5.
but only of his undeserved love, According to the good pleasure of his own
will? not for works we had done (it was before the world) not for any we were
like to do, as who do none, till he work them in us. Romans 5. 10.
So also, Why redeemed he us, when we were all fallen into condemnation? even
for his mere mercy; was there any thing in us could deserve it, Iam. 1. 18.
when we were utterly unable to do any good, nay, when his utter enemies? why
also has he called us? Did we, or could we do any thing before our calling to
deserve it? We were not only unable to think a good thought, but serving the
Devil with all our power, walking in our lusts, after the Prince that rules in
the children of disobedience. Ephesians. 2. 2. etc.
See our case in Ezekiel. 16. both in respect of our Parents, sinners, and our
selves, or any thing we can do: Nay, to cut the throat of all conceit of any
merit less or more, before or alter, Man could not be saved without abundant
mercy.
he says, His abundant mercy: So that a little mercy, such as is in man, or
some reasonable store, as in Angels, would not serve the turn, nor was
sufficient to save us, or move the Lord to call us to this hope, but an
abundant deal of the mercy of God, which is infinite.

Was it a small matter that moved God to choose thee to Salvation, Use 1.
rather then thousands of others? or was it a small mercy to give us his only
Son, to save and deliver us by suffering all the wrath due to us? What, Not his
Servant, nor his Friend, but his Son, his only begotten Son, the wisdom of the
Father, the Image of the invisible God, the engraven form of his Person, to
stoop so low as to become man! nay in that base estate to be despised of men,
to be hated, spitted upon, mocked, shamefully Crucified, and he that knew no
sin, to stand in the stead of most vile sinners, and so to be dealt with, and
that for us no friends, but enemies; no good persons, but vile and wretched
ones? Was a little love enough to bring this to pass? Ioh. 3. 16.
Oh no, but a love without measure, without example, never such another, even
that any Father gave his only begotten Son to save traitors and enemies.

It was wonder that the Father did not rather suffer all mankind to perish,
Use 2.
then to give his only most blessed Son to suffer the least of these
indignites. And it was no small love of Jesus Christ that moved him to leave
the glory of the Father, and stoop to the estate of a man, and all his
infirmities save sin, and to endure all these tortures of men, and his Fathers
wrath especially? It was no small love that made him give us his heart-blood;
when he shed a few tears for Lazarus, the Jews said, Ioh. 11. 35, 36
Behold how he loved him, but having shed his blood for us, what may we say?

So also is it a small measure of mercy to call us to the hope of Salvation
from our wretched estate, when we went on in sin, and minded no good, See Ephesians.
2. ^.
nay all evil? It must needs be a great deal of mercy to move God to think well
to us, Tit. 3. 5.
when we went on madly in our sins, and did fight against him: so also to
forgive so many and horrible offenses as we had committed; no marvel though
David craved the multitude of Gods mercies: Psalm. ^1. 1.
If they were not infinite our sins could not be forgiven, for our sins come as
near infinite as number can make them; then to cloth such wretches with the
righteousness of his Son; then to forget and forgive all that is past, and take
us into favor, and make us here heirs of all his promises and privileges, and
of life eternal hereafter, who will not admire it? Is not this abundant mercy
to work this hope in us, whom he might have justly condemned; and when he might
also have been glorified in our condemnation, as he was in Pharoahs Plagues? So
also to adopt us for his children, men adopt that have none of their own; God
had a natural beloved Son, Ephesians. 1. 5.
men adopt their kinsmen; God us, nothing of his kin, yea his enemies; 1 Ioh.
3. 1.
men adopt for some good quality, we had no such thing to move God: was it not
a great deal of mercy that moved God to call Paul that ran a persecuting of him
in his members, to forgive Mary Magdalen, Manasses? etc. So every one of us,
What were we when God called us? Must not we say, that it was abundant mercy
that ever we were called, forgiven and saved?

They that have had their part in this abundant mercy, Use 3.
must be stirred up to abundant thanksgiving, Psalm. 116. 12.
saying with the Psalmist, What shall I render to the Lord for all his benefits
toward me? We must testify our love in ^ealous obedience all the days of our
life, Tit. 2. 14.
showing forth the virtues of him that has called us out of darkness into his
mavelous light, and be a peculiar people to him, zealous of good works,
walking worthy of the Lord, Col. 1. 10.
which is by pleasing him in all things; we must be ravished with zeal toward
him, as he has been for our good; 2 King 19. 31.
The zeal of the Lord of Hosts has done it. Oh how this rebukes the scant
duty that God has from us again! We receive abundant mercy, but return poor
sparing obedience; what slender zeal in Prayer, or works of mercy? How quickly
are we weary of well-doing? What small things will we stick at to God, that
stuck at nothing to us? If he should call us to part with our Goods, Country,
Liberty, it were no more then Christ did for us, yea if to dye, did not he even
dye for us?

It teaches us also to show mercy one to another, Use 4.
in giving, forgiving, Mat. 5. 45.
and the like; Luke 6. 36.
herein the Lord himself going before us as a pattern of imitation.

It shows also the miserableness of our estate, Use. 5.
that without abundant mercy we can never be saved; therefore must we seek for
it earnestly and betimes, as becomes those that need such an infinite thing,
which condemns the notable carelessness, and desperate boldness and presumption
of the World, that put off seeking for mercy till the latter end, as if they
had it at command: But do they think abundant mercy is so easily gotten? Heb.
12. 17.
Many have not found it so, nay they shall, with Esau, howl for the blessing
and go without it, because they despised it, Mat. 25. 12.
when it was so often offered: The foolish Virgins sought to enter in when it
was too late.

By the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead] The means whereby we are
begotten to this hope, The means whereby we are begotten to this hope.
namely, the Spirits assuring that Christ Jesus is risen for us, and giving us
power through his resurrection to rise to newness of life. 1 Cor. 15. 3. etc.


The benefits that come to us by Christ's resurrection are many; Benefits
arising from Christ's resurrection.
1. We are hereby assured, that he has fully paid our debt and discharged all;
for if one sin had remained unsatisfied for, the justice of God could not have
suffered him to have risen again. Romans 4. 25.
2. Hereby we receive power to rise to newness of life. ib. 8. 33, 34.
3. Hereby we are assured of the resurrection of our bodies at the last day: 1
Cor. 15. 17.
The same power that did the one, shall be able to do the other; The head being
risen will draw all the members after it.

We should therefore often meditate on our Savior Christ's resurrection, Use.
and the benefits thereof, especially on the Lord's Day, the day whereon he rose
again; by which very day we are put in mind thereof: and among other things,
we must labor by Faith to draw virtue from his resurrection, whereby we may be
more and more enabled to walk in newness of life: for as our Regeneration has
two parts, a dying unto sin, and rising to newness of life, so have these two
springs, Christ's death, and his resurrection.

Verse 4. To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fa^eth not
away, reserved in Heaven for you.
HEre he explains what we are called to, namely, the lively hope of the Kingdom
of Heaven, The Kingdom of Heaven why termed an inheritance.
which as it is here termed an Inheritance, so is it in the next verse
Salvation. This is called an inheritance to show us the nature of it, being
also described by sundry properties, under divers-phrases, as if no words could
sufficiently express the same. Those show the perpetuity and purity thereof, as
also how we shall come by it; its reserved for us, but where? in Heaven, where
its out of danger: but how shall we come to it being here on earth among many
dangers? We are kept for it, and that by a mighty hand, even the power of God,
by the mean of Faith; kept, I say, unto this Salvation, prepared long ago, and
which shall be showed us in the fullness of it, even at Christ's second coming.

An inheritance] Therefore no purchase, no wages of a servant, but an
inheritance given by a Father to his son, not (such as many heirs have)
entailed, or as any natural son, which has it by a kind of right after his
father, See Act. 20. 32
but an inheritance of Adopted children; Luke 12. 32.
taken in as the child of a Traitor, Romans 6. 23.
nay a Traitor himself, and so made heirs, then which what can be freer? This
is said to be given, and what is freer then gift?

This serves to confute not only the gross Opinion of Papists, Use.
that we, God setting us forward, and helping us, can do such things as whereby
we can merit Heaven and Salvation; but that which is more nice, is of those
which say, that we have no good of our selves, but that its wrought in us by
God alone, yet now look for Salvation by their Holiness and Sanctification; No,
God forbid, for our Sanctification being imperfect, God might justly condemn us
for it, and count our works a polluting of his grace; Psalm 146. 2.
therefore David says, No flesh (before nor after grace) can be justified in
thy sight; Romans 3. 20.
not only by nothing of our own, Luke 18. 11.
but by nothing that God works in us. What differ these men from the proud
Pharisee, he attributed his holiness not to himself, but to God, and thankt him
for it; but he thought this would merit (that he was not so and so as others)
and challenge something at the hand of God, and therefore was rejected. True it
is, God not only disproveth not, but likes and accepts of our works, though
unperfect, yea crowns and rewards his own grace in us; yet not for the
worthiness of the work, but for the persons sake that is in his favor by Jesus
Christ, whose perfect righteousness is imputed, to make a supply of our
imperfections and wants.

Seeing therefore it is an inheritance every way free, bestowed upon us only
by right of Adoption in Jesus Christ, which by his grace he has called us
unto; let us so acknowledge it to the glory of God, and like Adopted children,
love our Father, fear him, be zealous for his glory, and take his part.

Incorruptible, 1 Cor. 2. 9.
etc.] Now he describes it, rather setting down what it is not, The happiness
of Gods people in Heaven abides for ever.
then what it is, which no tongue can express; it is without end, perpetual,
called therefore everlasting life: Life for the excellency, Everlasting for the
continuance; God endures for ever and ever, so the happiness of his servants:
no death there to deprive us of it, Heb. 12. 28.
or take us from it; no sin there to provoke God to take it from us, it abides
firm for ever, it cannot be moved. All earthly inheritances are subject to
decay, liable to a thousand perils, alterations and troubles, they may be taken
from us, and we from them by death. How were the Canaanites put out, and the
Israelites succeeded in their places? How did the Chaldeans displace them, as
themselves were by the Medes and Persians? These things below are the meat that
perishes, uncertain riches, a treasure which moth and canker corrupt, and
whereto thieves may break in and steal, whereof also civil or foraign Wars
might quickly deprive us; neither are the smallest inheritances void of cumber,
as being in danger of bad titles, oppressors, tyrants, and the like, or to be
spent and wasted by unthrifty heirs.

Undefiled] There comes nothing to taint it, Why termed undefiled.
its most pure; how can it be otherwise, being the habitation of the most holy
God, who is Holiness it self? Act. 20. 12.
holiness becomes the presence of God, where his holy Angels attend upon him:
This is prepared for them that are sanctified; Apoc. 21. 27.
neither can any unclean person come there: Hereof the most holy place in the
Temple, called the Holy of Holies, was a figure, and this is also called the
holy Jerusalem; Apoc. 21. 10.
pure gold is the wall thereof, and precious stones that have no mixture of any
impure thing in them; the gates That withers not, or fades not away; A
metaphor taken from herbs and flowers, which though fair and fresh, and of good
smell in the morning, yet in a short time fade and wither, lose beauty, smell,
and all. The Kingdom of Heaven always one and the same.
This Kingdom is not so, but continues ever fresh and flourishing, always the
same, alters not through continuance or length of time. There Is nothing in this
world but welks; the older we grow, the more we wrinkle and wither, the more do
we fade both in beauty and strength: so do inheritances; so goodly and fair
houses in time are ready to drop down, or are quite consumed: Kingdoms also
fade and decay, that were sometimes flourishing; so also Cities, yea every
thing is the worse for the wearing: Not so with this, here is an inheritance
indeed, could we but conceive and express the fame.

This sets out the excellency of the children of God, Use 1.
that are beloved of God, attended by the holy Angels, heirs of the promises
here, and of such an inheritance hereafter: If any man knew the excellency of a
child of God, covered with Christ's Righteousness, heir apparent to such a
Kingdom, endued with the Spirit of Sanctification, and who he were that is one
of them, he would fall down at his feet, and kiss the ground he trod on, and
cry out, Blessed be the day that ever thou were born; but twice blessed the day
wherein thou shall die, for then thou shall be blessed, and that eternally: but
this the world sees not, they see us but outwardly, and so our state is mean,
they see not our inward estate. Simile.


If the young Prince should come on foot in his working-day clothes through a
Town, and none knew who were his Father, nor what he is born to, he might go
through the street, and no man greatly regard him; but if in his best apparel,
and known what he is, then every man would look after him, and reverence him:
so the world sees us in our working-days clothes, and therefore neglect us; if
they did see us in our holy day apparel, they would admire us: but being
ignorant of the Father that begat us, and that will give us this inheritance,
how can they take notice of us?

This should stir up them that have attained hereunto, Use 2.
to be highly thankful for the same; and good cause why, for we were begotten
and born at first to a woeful inheritance, to hell and damnation, children of
wrath, but now begotten again to this happy inheritance; walk we therefore as
becomes those that are called to so high an inheritance: Phil. 3. 20.
Kings Sons must not carry themselves like base persons; so neither must we,
Col. 3. 1.
but have our conversation in Heaven, seeking for those things that are above,
and esteeming of this world as vain; so using it, as that thereby we may be
furthered to our true inheritance, not hindered; we must long to be at it: How
do heirs under age, long to be of age to come to their Lands? so should we
(here as it were under age) long to come to our Inheritance; as they that be
long tossed on the Sea, long to come to the Haven, and Pilgrims to be at their
own Country, and Prisoners to be at liberty; so should we desire to be
dissolved, that we enjoy Heaven, our Haven, our Country, the only place of
freedom. A wonderful fault in Christians, that so little think of it, take so
little pleasure therein, are no more thankful for the same; seek after earthly
things too eagerly, and do not so much aim after this: Oh what great
unthankfulness is this! to be called to such an Inheritance, and so little to
think thereof, so little to long after it? Oh how we linger here below! if God
should not drive us out by crosses, as Lot was fired out of Sodom, we would
never be weary, we would still say, Its good being here; say we then out of our
earnest desire hereof, Rev. 22. 17.
Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.

Here we sin, Rev. 7. 17.
and taste of sorrows many ways; then shall we sin no more, feel no more
affliction, pain, sorrow, trouble any way: All tears shall be wiped from our
eyes, then shall we be perfectly both holy and happy; when we come there, we
shall not need to plow, sow, eat, drink, sleep, we shall not need travel any
more to hear more Sermons, God shall be all in all.

This should comfort us against the fear of death; Use 3.
what should we need to fear, since when Our earthly house of this Tabernacle
shall be dissolved, 2 Cor. 5. 1.
we know we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in
the Heavens. To go out of prison to liberty, is it not comfortable? out of of a
miserable world, to a most happy Inheritance, what more desirable? So if we be
deprived of our earthly Inheritance, as these Jews were that were scattered
into other countries for Religion sake, comfort we our selves notwithstanding,
that yet we have an Inheritance (as hard as the world goes) and that a good and
a sure one; Act. 7. 5.
as long as we have this, we are happy: So though we have no Inheritance here,
not one foot; yet if we have assurance of this, we may rejoice, and having
this, bear with the want of other things: Its better, then without this to be
Lord of a Town, Owner of a Kingdom; its our great fault, that if we be somewhat
shortened here, we are so much cast down thereat as if we had nothing.

This should make us count all the labor, Use 4.
pains, reading, hearing, conferring, praying, and all happy that has brought
us to the hope of this Inheritance; we have traveled well, its happily
bestowed. Hereupon for the time to come, we must be encouraged to any pains, to
do any thing, to suffer any thing for the attainment and enjoyment of so
blessed an Inheritance: This Inheritance should we desire for our children
above any other, and use the means accordingly; how do men toil to make their
children rich, how few use means to make them gracious.

This may stir up them that have no hope to labor after this Inheritance; Use.
5.
Lay up a treasure in Heaven; Mat. 6. 20.
Labor for the meat that endures to everlasting life. Ioh. 6. 27.
This is worth our pains and cost, this is good wisdom: Mat. 13. 45.
The wise Merchant spying the Pearl hid in the field, goes and sells all, and
buys it; so every one that is a true Esteemer of this Pearl, prizeth it above
all that he has; But few do thus, because this Pearl is hid from carnal men,
they do not see it, and many among us will not see it, though it be discovered
to us: But O woeful and miserable world, he that would look upon most men, might
think there were no such inheritance: How do some spend all their time in
pleasure, and never look after any thing else? How do most men rake after the
world, night and day (Sabbath and all) by right and wrong, hook and crook, and
suffer no stone unrolled for this pelf and trash of the world, that never set
their hearts once to enquire after any other inheritance for time to come, as
if Heaven were here: poor beasts, they might as well go on all four: Oh base,
that men should spend their time, their thoughts, their pains, and all, for
that which may be lost ere morning, and no whit for that which will last for
ever: Thus with Judas, most sell Christ for Thirty pieces; with Esau, their
Birthright for a mess of Pottage; and with the Gadarens, prefer their hogs
before Christ; others that seem not altogether eaten up of the world, or so
profane, will talk of this inheritance, but how do they hold it? by every
blind conceit; they that cannot even by learned Counsel make sure enough their
Earthly inheritance, can of their own heads make sure their Heavenly: Nay, the
world if they see any take pains in Hearing, Reading, Praying, and the like,
wonder at them, count them fools, say, they will beggar themselves, I wonder
what they mean, etc. Do thou wonder? They desire to attain an heavenly
inheritance, not easily attained: They may rather wonder to see thee so earnest
for this trash, which thou must leave thou can not tell how soon, and have no
care for the time to com, which is for ever; let such leave off seeking for the
body, 1 Timothy 6. 19.
and now care for the soul, Laying up in store a good foundation for themselves
against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life: Oh get good
evidences to show for it against all cavillers; content not thy self with this,
that God is merciful, and Christ died for all men, and the like, but labor to
gain assurance upon good ground, that thou art one of them to whom God has
promised mercy, and for whom Christ dyed: To this end, examine thy Faith by its
undoubted fruits, Repentance and Charity.

If it be an undefiled inheritance, Use 6.
let every one therefore labor to wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb,
and by the Spirit of Sanctification, else can we never come there; none but
such are admitted into Gods presence: what an impudent sawciness then is it in
a number that wallow in the filthy mire of their sins, and yet hope to go to
Heaven as well as the best? Are swine, and such filthy cattle used to be
brought into Kings Presence-Chambers? No, thou must be washed ere thou come
here, and that so, as all the water in the sea cannot wash thee: If such as
thou go to Heaven, then who go to Hell? If you will say Turks and Pagans, then
look into the Parable of the Sower, three sorts of hearers perish; you know and
do not, they know not the will of God: Do thou think that thou can go on in
thy lewdness, and step out of thy filthy life into Heaven? No, then had all
Gods servants lost a great deal of labor: We read of one, and but of one, that
made any short cut, namely the thief upon the Cross; labor thou therefore in
time to be washed, in time for Sanctification, and hereafter (as heretofore
thou have still done) put not off from day to day: But the Apostle contents not
himself with the foregoing description, he yet adds more touching the same;
what then? We notwithstanding must learn to be wise according to sobriety; and
that we (forgetting our weak understanding) mount not up to search more
curiously into Gods mysteries then he has revealed* lest the glory thereof
dazzle and confound us: We are ready, and have a tickling desire to know further
then God has revealed, which breeds rather jangling then godly edifying: It
may be enough for us to know that this inheritance and happiness is such, as
that when all that men's tongues can speak is uttered, yet it is nothing to the
excellency of it: So laying aside all curious questions about it, let us rather
employ our pains and study to get assurance of it.

Reserved in Heaven] This inheritance is here described by the place, not in
Earth, not in Paradise, where Adam was, not in Canaan, which flowed with milk
and honey, but in Heaven.

Hence note, that

Heaven is the place wherein God has appointed to glorify his Saints, God
has appointed to glorify his Saints in heaven.
even the third Heaven, the place of his presence; where he manifests himself
most clearly to his Angels and Saints; that Paradise whereinto Christ ascended
at his death, where also he promised that the penitent thief should be with
himself* the bosom of Abraham, whereinto Lazarus was received.

For where Christ is, there shall all his Saints be; as he himself has
promised, and will perform: See to this purpose, Mat. 25. 34. Joh. 14. 2. and
17. 24. and 2 Cor. 5. 1. This is not every where, as some have imagined, Col.
3. 1.
but above in the highest Heavens: Christ was taken up, Act. 1. 9.
and who knows not that Heaven is above, as Hell is beneath?

This shows the excellency of this inheritance: Use 1.
Oh how infinite odds is there between Heaven and Earth, both for Glory and
Eternity! Therefore its called a glorious inheritance: Ephesians. 1. 18.
If the outside be so decked with Sun, Moon, Stars, and such an excellent
beautiful sky, Rev. 21. 11.
what is the inside? According to our weakness, St. John describes it by things
of most worth amongst us, as pure Gold, and precious Pearls: In this will God
glorify all his Saints, whenever we die, our souls shall be taken up into
it, as our bodies also at the last day.

How does this set forth the unspeakable love of God, Use 2.
and merit of Christ, that we who were worthily shut out of the Paradise on
Earth, should be received into this Heavenly Paradise.

How should this ravish their hearts, Use 3.
that know themselves heirs of this? How should it make them despise these
things here below, when they know and find them experimentally lets hereunto?
How should it make us walk with an heavenly mind worthy of that inheritance?
Out mind and soul should be there, and savor of it, whither at the time of
our dissolution we are to be carried.

How should this stir up all men to seek after this glorious inheritance, Use 4.
this Treasure in Heaven, so excellent, so incomparable? But Oh, the blind
world thinks not of this, because its not seen with the bodily eye: Men labor
and strive to get up aloft here, to fet their nest on high, from which yet they
may come down quickly, as many do, and must do at their death; but how few
labor to get up to this height of glory in Heaven?

In Heaven] Hereby our Apostle meets with, The prevention of a conceit of the
Jews.
and seeks to cure a gross imagination of the Jews, which dreamed of an earthly
Potentate, and thought Christ should come and deliver them from the Romans: See
it in the two sons of Zebedeus; Mat. 20. 21.
yea after three years teaching of Christ, Acts 1. 6.
after his death and resurrection, they were not free of this conceit: our
Savior used to call their mind from this to heaven, Can ye drink of the cup
that I drink of, says he; and, I came to serve, and not to be served.

So Peter draws them to look for their glory in Heaven; we must not therefore
look for an happy estate here below but in Heaven: Here the Cross, there the
Crown; here the Battle, there the Victory; The Crown of Thorns here, the Crown
of Glory hereafter; many would follow Christ and the Gospel, if there came any
preferment by him, Mat. 8. 19, 20.
that now do not; so would the young rich man: But Gods children will serve him,
though they undergo troubles here for the glorious inheritance hereafter.

Reserved for us in Heaven] This meets with an Objection that these Christians
might make: The preventian of an Objection.
Alas, come to this inheritance (it were happy indeed if we could) but what
hope of it? Alas, we are tossed up and down, stripped of all our goods, and
persecuted; we are so far from hope to obtain this eternal inheritance, that we
cannot keep these earthly ones which we have: He answered, this is safely
reserved for us, and is out of danger to be lost; and though they lost their
earthly inheritances, they were but uncertain and transitory things, whereof
God never promised that they should be other; but this is eternal, whereof they
shall be most sure: Mat. 25. 34.
For, has the Father prepared this inheritance ere the world was, and chosen
us unto it? has the Son purchased it for us when we had lost it? Gods children
shall not miss of Heaven.
Has the Holy Ghost assured us of it, and sealed it to us, and given us the
earnest of it, and shall we miss it? God forbid, the Spirit of truth cannot
deceive us; shall Christ lose his death? Oh no, its reserved for us in Heaven,
where no Devil can come, nor wicked men to take it from us.

Let this be a comfor to all the faithful servants of God that are justified
and sanctified, Use.
to sweeten all their afflictions here below, that they may be as sure of
Heaven in the end without fail, as if they had it already: Many children lose
their temporal inheritances, for want of good Gardians and Keepers, they are
often wasted and gone ere they come to years, or are suffered to be recovered
from them by some others; but the Lord is a faithful keeper, we are yet under
age; when we shall come to age and dye, the Father that kept it for us, will
bestow it on us; Christ Jesus our head and elder brother, he has taken
possession of it for us, and tells us, that where he is, there shall we be. But
if we say, we have many ill willers, there can none come into Heaven, but our
Friends: The Devil our deadliest adversary, he comes not there, though he did
into the earthly Paradise: And for the wicked, though they hare Gods children,
so as they could wish, that as they take away their earthly Inheritances, so
they should never be happy, if they could help it; its past their power to
deprive them hereof; they shall go to Heaven do what they can, yea oftentimes
they help them sooner thither then otherwise they should be (though no thank to
them) and at the day of Judgment, to the increase of their torment, the godly
shall be taken up in their sight to Heaven, when themselves shall be thrust
into that place of utter darkness, to be tormented with the Devil and his
Angels for ever and ever: Hereof we have need to be thoroughly persuaded, else
when great afflictions come, they will be ready to overwhelm us, as it did
almost befall both Job and Jeremiah. Oh the afflictions of this present time are
not worthy the glory that shall be revealed! let the assurance of Heaven keep
us from wishing we had never been; whatsoever troubles we do here meet withal,
pray we still, Lord increase our Faith; but more of this hereafter.

For us] Namely, To be particularly assured of Heaven a special comfort.
himself by the judgment of certainty, and them by the judgment of charity.

Here note, that

Its a Christians special comfort, Gal. 2. 20.
that he knows and believes that this Inheritance is for him in particular; Job
19. 25.
I know, says Job, that my Redeemer lives; Ioh. 20. 28.
My Lord and my God, says Thomas: This nature of Faith is signified in the
particular distribution of the Sacrament.

To believe it in general, affords no sound comfort; it may indeed allure one
for a while to the profession of the Gospel, to hear that there be such
excellent things, Heb. 6. 6.
but it will not continue, but will fail and fade away: They that have no more
but tasted of the powers of the world to come, will assuredly fall quite away;
but a particular assurance is the mother of all comfort, and the only
foundation of a true good life, and continuance therein unto the end; The only
prop and pillar to uphold us in Troubles, Dangers, Distresses, Persecutions,
and what not.

Therefore labor for it; Use.
But this were presumption, say the Papists, and to this purpose they abuse
that of the Preacher, The Righteous and the Wise, Eccle. 9. 1.
and their works are in the hand of God, no man knows either love or hatred
by all that is before them; but hereby is meant only, that by these outward
things no man can conclude whether he be loved or hated of God, but that
therefore we may not know at all, its most gross. Indeed if we should say this
of our own heads, it were presumption, but when we speak it from the Word, and
the witness of the Spirit of truth, Romans 8. 14.
then it is not; As many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of
God, 2 Cor. 13. 5.
says the Apostle; And, Know ye not that Christ Jesus is in you, except ye be
reprobate. And the Apostle Saint John tells us how we may know that he dwells in
us, 1 Ioh. 4. 13.
even Because he has given us of his Spirit.

If therefore we find the fruits of the Spirit, an hatred of all sin, an
unfeigned care to please God in all things, love to Gods Word and his people,
grieve that we can serve God no better, strive after more power, and that in
the use of the means ordained to that end; we should be injurious to the Spirit
of God, if we did not believe this inheritance to belong to our selves in
particular; Romans 8. 30.
Therefore if we find our selves regenerate and sanctified, we need not doubt
of glorification.

Verse 5. Who are kept by the power of God, through Faith unto Salvation, ready
to be revealed in the last time.
THey might say its a goodly Inheritance indeed, and reserved for us, but how
shall we come at it, that are lost on the sea of this world? how should a
Mariner come to the Haven in a great tempest through the midst of rocks and
sands, The preventi- of another doubt.
and many Pirates in his way? This doubt the Apostle removes, by showing, That
they are kept by the power of God, through faith unto salvation. God does, as
if a King should lay up an infinite treasure in a most safe place, and bid his
subjects fetch and take it, but in the way are many Thieves, and also Lions,
Wolves and Bears, against whom he promises them safe conduct and protection,
with his gards to go along with them.

Here then is a further benefit that God bestows upon his, that he sets them
not only in hope of Salvation, and in a good way, but so confirms them
therein, that they continue to the end, and that by upholding them through his
mighty power, against all oppositions whatsoever.

Kept] Therefore we have many enemies and hindrances of our Salvation; Gods
children have many enemies to hinder their salvation.
1. The Devil, whose subtilty, malice, power and vigilance is extraordinary;
his names in Scripture, Serpent, Dragon, Lion, and such like, with his
continued practices (there recorded) to hinder our Salvation, evidence the
same: Accordingly does he daily endeavor to have us in one extreme or another,
as either to be of no religion, or a false religion; if of a true, then that
either we may be carnal and secure, or run on to an erroneous and preposterous
zeal; so as he drives some to presumption, he drives others to desperation. 2.
The world; whereof 1. The evil examples therein, like a common stream carry us
away, as sheep or cattle seeing a few go in at a gap, will in too, whatever
come of it. 2. Ill counsel, and that both to young men, What will you in the
prime of your youth give your self to this precise course, never merry more? no
body will care for you. Old men, What will you now be an hearer of Sermons, and
of another mind then heretofore? what is this, but to disgrace all your former
life? you have ever been counted an honest man, do not now discredit your self:
and to rich men, will you go among them, a company of poor despised people? it
will be no small disgrace unto you. 3. The profits and pleasures thereof,
whereby most men are beguiled and enchanted: By profits some are kept from
professing religion altogether, their Oxen and Farms keep them off, they have
no leisure; yea, some that have heard with joy, and (with Demas) gone further,
have been choked by these thorny cares, as others besorted with pleasures to
the ruin of their whole man. 4. Adversities, Persecutions, Mat. 26. 56.
Troubles every where to be found therein: All forsook Christ when he was first
taken, 2 Timothy 4. 16.
and the Apostle Paul says, That at his first answer all for sook him. Romans 8.
7.
And 3. which is the worst, our own corrupt nature, Genesis 6. 5.
the wisdom whereof is enmity against God, and all the thoughts of our hearts
are only evil continually: 1 Pet. 2. 11.
Our fleshly lusts fighting against our souls; Oh the abominable corruption
that lurketh in us! we drink in iniquity like water, we hale it to us as with
cart ropes, naturally we can do nothing else; as a traitor its ready to deliver
us up to every Enemy, Ioh. 17. 11.
therefore Christ had cause to commend us to his Fathers custody.

These be so mighty, as that few can be saved for them: These not only carry
down the common sort, but even such as have made great profession, and have
received great gifts; many of these, with Demas, are eaten up of the world, as
others scared by persecution; yea, hereby even Gods sanctified ones (with David
and Peter) are shrewdly shaken. Psalm. 73. 2.


We should therefore Be strong in the Lord, Use.
and in the power of his might; Ephesians. 6. 10.
Putting on the whole armor of God, that we may be able to stand against the
wiles of the Devil and his adherents. No marvel then, though our Savior still
stirs us up to watch and pray.

By the power of God] We cannot keep our selves; Christians cannot stand of
themselves.
No alas! not for an hour: look on David and Peter, nay Adam in the state of
innocence; yea, as being left for a while, we fall into some one or other sin,
as into security, Psalm 127. 1.
or the like; so we could not but fall quite away, if there were no other help
but our own.

This should make us hang down our heads, Use 1.
and humble our selves, and cling to God: If we trust to our selves we shall
speed like Peter; therefore crave new grace, and continual supply.

And if we be kept, Use 2.
we may know to whom to ascribe the glory and praise thereof.

Though we have many opposites against our Salvation, Use 3.
and we cannot keep our selves, there is one notwithstanding that both can and
will keep us, so that we cannot fall from our happy state of grace, in despite
of all the enemies of our Salvation whatsoever.

He opposes to the mighty adversaries of our Salvation, Gods almighty power is
sufficient to uphold us against all our enemies.
mighty defense, even the Almighty power of God; that is, His Almightiness,
whereby he rules all things in Heaven, Earth, Sea, and all deeps, whom neither
Angels, Men, Devils nor Hell can resist. Whatsoever disguise we see any
Christians to come to, See Rogers his Book of Direct.
we that escape them, are so kept by the power of God; the Father having
elected us, the Son has redeemed us, and so committed us over to his Father to
be kept: so that our Salvation is not in our own keeping, Ioh. 17. 11.
as it was in Adams, for then woe unto us, we should soon lose it; but it is in
a sure hand, which makes our state by Christ much better then our state in Adam.

This is most comfortable Doctrine against all fear of our own weakness, Use 1.
or any other enemies; Psalm. 121. 4.
Though they be strong, yet the Father is stronger, Ioh. 10. 19.
and none can pluck them out of his hands: Our adversary is as a roaring Lion,
See Phil. 1. 6.
but we have the Lion of the Tribe of Judah on our side; Ier. 31. 3.
and being made members of Christ, will be suffer any to pluck and rend us from
him? no assuredly, we are not now enemies as in time past, but Gods sons and
daughters, therefore not like unnaturally to be forsaken of him in our need;
Romans 5. 10.
For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his
Son; much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life, being delivered
from our greatest fear, everlasting condemnation: Objections against this,
answered by Downham. lib. 3. cap. 13.
its most certain, that our combats that remain, shall not be deadly, but only
to exercise our Faith; let us believe this firmly, God who has bestowed grace
on us, will uphold us to the end, so that we may say, Though we can do nothing
of our selves, we are able notwithstanding to do all things through Christ that
strengthens us: Phil. 4. 13.
And, We know whom we have believed, and that he is able to keep that which we
have committed to him, 2 Timothy 12.
whose love also is unchangeable.

Why, Object.
we have known of great professors who have fallen finally, as Judas, and many in
our time.

Yea, Sol.
but not such as were taken into the Divine protection and keeping of God, but
hypocrites: They went out from us (says Saint John) but they were not of us.
Peter was kept by the power of God, though shaken by temptation, yet was he not
overcome. Judas was never but the child of perdition, and had common graces,
and was never justified nor sanctified.

Let us then look we be found, and indeed be such as are taken into Gods
keeping, and then safe enough; then may we triumph with the Apostle, Romans 8. 31.
If God be on our side, who can be against us? And, who shall separate us from
the love of Christ? Romans 8. 35. 37.
Shall tribulation, or distress or persecution, etc. Nay in all these things we
are more then conqu^rers through him that loved us: So must it needs be, except
we think the Lords arm to be shortened, or his power weakened, that he cannot
help, and that there should be any stronger then the Almighty: Indeed if we be
but Hypocrites, and out of Gods keeping, we may fall into any sin, and
miserably fall away for ever, for what have we to stay us? For as if God take
not the care of a man, all creatures are liable to do him hurt; as Cain said
murmuringly, Genesis 4. 14.
Thou have cast me from thy face, and every one that finds me shall slay me:
Noting indeed truly that he lies open to a Thousand perils that is not kept by
God; so is it for spiritual dangers, he that is not kept by God, may fall into
any sin irrecoverably, and perish eternally.

This then confounds that hellish Doctrine of Rome, Use 2.
that the elect and sanctified may finally fall from grace, which is contrary
to the whole Scripture.

Through Faith] God keeps us, Gods people are kept thr^ugh Faith.
but by no miracle or extraordinary way, but by Faith; not without us, but by
working and increasing the grace of Faith, and true belief in us: some would
understand it, through hope, because hereby we wait for Salvation, and indeed
there is great affinity between Faith and Hope, so that in Scripture they are
sometimes put one for another: By Faith we believe the goodness of God toward
us, by Hope we wait till we find and feel him so to us; by Faith we believe
eternal life, by Hope we patiently wait for it: And as there could be no Hope,
if there were not Faith before, so Hope does greatly help Faith; it keeps it
that it makes not too much haste, nor break off in the mid way; for God
oftentimes after his promises deferreth to perform them (so that the wicked
also come to say, 2 Pet. 3. 4.
Where is the promise of his coming) yea ere he come, he hides his face, and
seems as if he would not fulfill the same; now therefore here does Hope her
Office, and steps in, and sustains Faith very well, so that a Christian must
necessarily have both to go along with him: But I see no reason to alter the
Apostles words, but to take Faith properly for the grace of true Faith and
believing: though this is true, that Hope helps well on, but he speaks of
Faith, which includes Hope as a necessary companion.

But how does faith bring us to Salvation? How Faith brings us to Salvation.
It is said by the Apostle Paul, By grace ye are saved through Faith: Now as it
first apprehends Christ and Salvation, Ephesians. 2. 8.
so it holds this hold, and continues our comfort, and still carries us on in
the service of God, and an holy life: This assurance of eternal life makes us
contemn profits, offered to pull us from a good conscience, Heb. 11. 24.
as Moses did Pharaohs Court, and pleasures of Egypt; so to despise the Cross,
and overcome troubles that would draw us therefrom, as the holy Martyrs did
from time to time.

Also Faith apprehending the promise of God for our upholding to the end, rests
upon the goodness of God, which is constant, and his power, which is infinite:
Therefore when any shall persuade us we shall never hold out, we shall be
forsaken, Faith then puts up head, and says nay to it, because God has
promised to keep us unto Salvation.

The wicked come and say, where is now thy God, by reason of troubles which
befall the Godly; so the Devil and their own unbelief assaults them, Psalm. 42.
5. 11.
now Faith helps and says, Why art thou cast down, why art thou disquieted,
trust yet in God, he is my present help and my God: and, Psalm. 23. 4.
Though I walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no ill: and,
the name of the Lord is a strong Tower; Pro. 18. 10.
the Righteous runs to it, and is safe: 1 Ioh. 5. 4.
This is the Victory that overcomes the world, called therefore the shield,
Ephesians. 6. 16.
By which we quench the fiery darts of the Devil: For this purpose our Savior
when he prayed that Peter might hold out, prayed that his Faith might not fail:
Luke 22. 32.
If that fail we are gone, if it hold, we shall be too hard for all the world;
so long as our Faith holds, all the world, with all the Engines it has to
destroy us, can never overturn us: Contrarily, without Faith we can neither
begin nor stand against any temptation or danger.

This teaches men to labor for this true Faith, Use 1.
without it they may fall to any thing, as the second and third sort of ground
mentioned by our Savior in the parable; most people content themselves in being
professors, but labor not for this grace of Faith, and therefore do they fall
away, and never come to Salvation.

It teaches also the Godly, Use 2.
still to say with the Apostle, Lord increase our Faith, Luke 17. 5.
using all other means to that purpose: A little Faith will go but a little
way; the least, if true, shall get to Heaven, but with much ado, as a poor
tattered Vessel may get to shore, especially if there come no storms, Simile.
but if there do, its in great danger, and very hardly attains unto it: but as
a strong Vessel comes safely, though it have strong tempests; so a strong
Faith, though it be strongly assaulted, and put to it (as often it is) both in
life, and in the end of life, yet it conquers.

We have had none but calm times hitherto, but what we may have we know not,
whether common trials, or particular ones, accompanied with pain, grief,
vexation, etc. Labor therefore for good store of Faith.

Unto Salvation] kept not for a while, Phil. 1. 6.
but to the coming of Christ, to the enjoying of Salvation, and not as Moses,
who had only a sight of Canaan.

He keeps us by his power: Christians must not look here for outward prosperity.
whereto? Not that our finger shall not ache in this world, but have all peace
and prosperity, and every bodies good will: No, but to Salvation in the end of
our life, for here we must suffer with him, Romans 8. 17.
if hereafter we mean to reign with him; we must be Baptized with the Baptism
wherewith he was Baptized.

It is true that godliness has the promises of this life, Use.
and of that which is to come, but of this only, so much as God shall see meet.

Therefore let us dream of no tranquillity here, but expect that in Heaven,
where we shall be happier then can be uttered.

Ready to be revealed in the last time. The fullness of our happiness not to be
had here,
] When shall we have it? It was prepared before the world, we shall have a
measure of it in death, but the fullness thereof is deferred till the day of
Judgment, Christ's second coming, Act. 3. 19.
which is called the time of refreshing, and our full redemption.

By the last time, Act. 2. 17
may be understood, in diverse places of Scripture, all the time from Christ's
coming in the flesh, Heb. 1. ^^
till the end of the world, so called, in respect of the former times; and
because they go directly and immediately before the end, and because God has
perfected his will, and the revelation thereof to his Church in his Son, and no
more is to be added.

They under the Law waited for a cleerer and fuller manifestation thereof, but
now we have all we shall ever have; but by the last time here, the worlds end
is meant, for then shall there be no more time, as there was none before the
creation; Genesis 8. 22.
the Sun, Moon and Stars were made for signs and season; Winter and Summer, to
measure days, months, years, etc. but then shall they cease; in Hell the
wicked shall have none, in Heaven the godly shall need none; so there shall be
no more time, no more day in Hell, but all night, no night in Heaven, but all
day.

Well, But at the last day.
our full Salvation we shall have at the last day, and not before; then shall
our bodies (whatsoever in the mean time becomes of them) as they have been
companions with our souls in well-doing, and have been redeemed by Christ, as
well as they be raised up, and set on the right Hand; when both jointly shall
hear this comfortable sentence, Col. 3. 3, 4.
Come ye blessed of my Father, etc. then shall we be ever with the Lord in
Heaven both in body and soul: Now our life is hid with Christ in God; 1 Ioh. 3.
2.
But when Christ which is our life shall appear, then shall we also appear with
him in glory.

We must therefore wait patiently, Use. 1.
not making too much haste; in the fullness of time we shall have our hearts
desire: Christ was promised in the beginning of the world, but came not till
long after, even when the fullness of time came, Iam. 5. 7.
so* shall our happiness in the appointed time.

We are taught to pray, Object.
Thy Kingdom come; and in the Revelation its mentioned that the souls under the
Alter cried, Rev. 6. 10.
How long, O Lord, holy and true, do thou not judge and avenge our blood on
them that dwell on the earth!

True, Sol.
but yet patiently awaiting Gods good time that he has appointed. Use. 2.


Hereby also we may stop the mouths of mockers that shall come to us, and say,
2 Pet. 3. 4.
Where is the promise of his coming? we may answer, it is coming, and it will
be here too soon for you, and God is not slack as you think, but therefore
deferreth, as willing that all men should come to Salvation, even all such as
he has elected, who being once all born and called, the end shall quickly
come: And as this may stop their mouths, so it may make us patient to tarry for
our fellow brethren.

When we therefore make too much haste, what is it, but that we would have our
full, happiness, and leave out some of the elect to be quite put off; Simile.
as if we should desire to be over a water, and then draw the bridge that the
rest shall not come over: And the rather let us be patient, Iam. 5. 8.
not only because of the greatness of the reward when it comes, but also
because it hasteneth; we have the vantage of our Forefathers, which lay long in
the earth, waiting for that day, but now its at hand; we hasten to it, and it
hastens to us, we shall meet ere long, and as our Apostle says, 2 Pet. 2. 3.
The damnation of the wicked sleeps not, so neither the Salvation of the
godly, now ready to be revealed.

Last time.] The coufutation of an error.
Some gather hence, That we shall have no part in glory at all, till the day of
Judgment, but that the souls of the Saints go to a middle place, etc. confuted
by our Saviors speech to the thief, Verily I say unto thee, Luke 23. 43.
To day shall thou be with me in Paridise; the Angels carrying Lazarus of soul
into Abraham's bosom: Luke 16. 22.
See also Eccle. 12. 7. Phil. 3. 13. Rev. 6. 10.

This should make us labor for pure and holy souls, Use.
seeing they must be in Heaven as soon as ever they depart from our bodies,
which we know not how soon it may be: They must be carried up above the Starry
Heaven into the most solemn appearance that ever was.

Verse 6. Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season (if need be)
year in heaviness through manifold temptations.
HAving showed the Inheritance at large, here he shows by what way God will
bring us thither; namely, by weeping-cross, by the rough way of affliction,
which yet shall not be to our hurt or consuming, but to the trial of our Faith,
that it may be (being purified) to our honor at Christ's coming: Therefore
though our afflictions breed heaviness, yet not such, but that the assurance of
our Salvation makes us in the same to rejoice.

Wherein] that is, In which Election, Sanctification, Lively hope, and happy
Inheritance ye rejoice: Here he sets down another benefit bestowed upon us
by the Gospel; namely, Spiritual joy, and rejoicing proceeding from Faith and
Hope, yea, and that in adversity.

He knew they rejoiced in the assurance of their happiness, he knew it by
himself, he did so, and therefore they could do no other, for the same Spirit
works alike in the elect, which makes that they can the better tell how to
speak, to advise, counsel and understand one another.

But in commending them, Phil. 1. 18.
he exorteth them, namely, That they would do so still; We must rejoice in the
assurance of our Salvation.
for being now in persecution, he requires them to rejoice yet in the assurance
of their eternal happiness, as Paul of himself in another case.

Hence note, See Psalm. 4. 7. and 50. 12.
that

Its the duty of all those that be assured of their Salvation, to rejoice in
it, Mat. 9. 2.
which being attained unto, breeds joy, and no marvel; For, Luke 10. 20.


Is liberty joyful to the captive, Act 8. 8. 39. and 16. 34.
health to the sick, sight to the blind, life to the dead? Then must Salvation
needs be so to them that have felt themselves condemned; for them to be the
children of God, that were the slaves of Satan, heirs of Heaven, that were
firebrands of Hell.

Who can but rejoice, that knows that there is no condemnation to him? Though
thousands perish, God loves him, he shall want nothing; such need not fear
though Heaven and Earth should come together, he knows that Heaven's prepared
for him, without which there can be no true mirth.

This rebukes Christians that do no more rejoice in their happiness, Use 1.
so seldom think of it, so little refresh and quicken up their hearts by it.

We could be merry in it, Object.
but our wretched nature and corruptions, that break out so continually, so
many ways damps us, and causes us to go heavily, when we might else rejoice.

True, Sol.
but this is not all the cause, we rejoice too much and too often in earthly
things, and therefore so seldom in the true treasure and best inheritance; and
this is unthankfulness, and too much baseness, and a great fault. If we did
more often comfort our hearts in this assurance, it would sharpen us on much to
duty; the want of this is the cause of our dullness.

This also rebukes the fond world, Use 2.
that thinks the Christian state so lumpish, as that there is no mirth in it;
and that if they should undertake that state, they should never be merry more:
such are afraid of their own shadows, Phil. 4. 4.
they are desperate and mad men, that can or dare be merry till they be
Christians, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 16.
who only have commission to be merry.

The wicked are bidden indeed, but its with a choke in the end, that they must
come to Judgment.

Religion takes not away, Religion reforms mirth.
but only reforms mirth; it takes away the filthy and wicked mirth, that
provokes God to anger, and ends in howling, as the wicked cannot be merry, but
in swearing, drunkeness, ribaldry, mocking the children of God, and the like:
What, no sport but with firebrands and edgetools? with nothing but that which
must anger God, and wound our own souls?

Again, Moderates our lawful mirth.
It moderates our lawful mirth, wherein many rejoice too excessively, teaching
us first to rejoice in God and his love, then in these things, as coming from
thence, and as helps, and for the hope of better things.

Oh that roysters and carnal worldlings would set less by this joy, Use.
for howling will be the end, and labor for the ground of true joy, which may
make their hearts merry here, Pro. 14. 13.
and bring them to endless joy hereafter. Eccles. 7. 6.
The wicked laugh, but in the midst thereof their heart is heavy.

They have many secret stings; its with good and bad men as its with a true man
and a thief, the true man goes home merry, and there sits down quiet, though he
have no great provision; the thief having his purse full of money at his Inn,
calls for great cheer, wine and music, and yet with a trembling heart, a
fearful eye, an ear that lists to every knock, thinking still that some are
come to apprehend him; he is not therefore so truly merry as the poor true man:
so is it with good and bad men.

Ye rejoyce] They were in affliction, Being assured of Heaven we must rejoice
even in our troubles.
yet rejoiced in the hope of Heaven; whence learn, that being assured of
Heaven, we are to rejoice even in affliction, in troubles.

This is often commanded; We are to count it all joy when we fall into diverse
temptations. Romans 5. 3.
For

Our light affliction which is but for a moment, 2 Cor. 8. 2.
works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory: Mat. 5. 11.
And, Iam. 1. 2.
The sufferings of this present time, Reason.
are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. 2
Cor 4. 17.
Therefore our assurance of Heaven should swallow up our heaviness, Romans 8. 18.
and not be swallowed up of it. We must be content with hungry men to eat good
meat, Acts 5. 41.
though it have sharp swace; as others have not been daunted by any troubles, 2
Cor 6. 10.
but amidst them expressed no small mirth; Heb. 10. 34.
so also must we.

Herein there is no small odds between christians and carnal men, Use 1.
for these though they have all that this world can afford them to make them
happy (like Dives) Wife, Children, Friends, and the like; yet dangers and
troubles shall sooner make them weary of this happiness, whereof he is in
present possession, then the child of God can be of that whereof here he has
but the assurance: for example, Take a man and give him what the world will
afford him, yet let a Millstone hang by a small coard over his head, at his
back a fierce adversary with his sword drawn, before his face an hissing
Serpent ready to sting him, on each side ramping and devouring Bears and Lions
ready to tare him in pieces, would not this fear daunt him more then all his
jollity would comfort him? Would he have any joy at all, the case being thus
with him? Dan. 5. 6.
As in Belshazzer: Nay, let him have but the gout or stone, and how will he
take on? But take a Christian that has the hope of eternal life, and set all
these about him, they shall not daunt him, nor make him comfortless; He will
hope and rejoice notwithstanding, as Paul and Silas in prison: As the fear of
Hell will abate all joy, so the hope of Heaven will abate all sorrow and fear:
The assurance of Salvation will comfort one more, then the enjoying of all the
world; what can daunt him that has this? such is the power of Faith. Use 2.


This also shows the difference between the joy of an Hypocrite and a true
Christian; The one can rejoice in prosperity, but not in adversity, neither
fasteth the Hypocrites joy, more then for a season: The wicked cannot bear, but
fret at troubles, because they know no assurance of ease, but rather that they
are forerunners of greater sorrows: As one may be drowned in a small River if
he fall in headlong, and come safe to land in the main Sea, if he have a board
to swim on; so the wicked are overwhelmed in less troubles, and the godly
upheld in the greatest, by the assurance of an happy end.

This also rebukes our daintiness and faint-heartedness, Use 3.
that are straight dismayed at a little trouble: He has not rightly profited in
the knowledge of God, and life eternal, that is dismayed by these troubles; If
thou faint in the time of affliction, Pro. 24. 10.
thy strength is but small: We are ready (like the Israelites) to murmr if we
lack any thing in the way to Canaan; the assurance thereof should have made
them (as it may us) to bear many difficulties: To this end we set before us the
Godly courage of the Martyrs, and many of our Godly predecessors: True it is,
no affliction is joyous in it self, but tedious, yet Faith comforts, Rev. 16.
21.
and even in it affords joy* The wicked then must labor to get assurance of
Gods favor, else they may come to be Blasphemers, or to do in their troubles as
Ca^n, Achi^ophel, Judas.

Though now for a season, etc.] Here he sets out their joy by the contrary that
it was mixed withal, namely, heaviness, occasioned through temptations, which
are aggravated by their number, Manifold, yet diminished again by three things:
1. They are but short, for a season now. 2. The author or sender, God, he sees
it good, if need be. 3. By the end that their Faith may be tried, and so found
to their honor at the last day, as in the ensuing Verse.

Manifold Temptations] They were driven from their Native country, forced to
fly for their lives, and so questio^less met with variety of troubles.

Whence may be noted, that

Even such as are highly in Gods favor, and shall be heirs of Heaven, must
undergo, not one or two, but many troubles: Gods children must here undergo
many troubles.
As the Israelites went to Cannan through the Wilderness, where sometimes they
wanted water, sometimes it was bitter, sometimes they met with Enemies, Psalm.
34. 19.
as at other times were encountered with other difficulties, so shall we in our
journey to Heaven: Acts 14. 22.
Behold it in Noah, though he was saved from the flood, 2 Timothy 3. 12
yet was it as it were by an Hundred deaths; what toil had he in making the
Ark, whilst the world sported? Was he not also shut up in a close place
amongst Beasts for a long time, where questionless there could not be but a
noysom savor (...) when he came out of the Ark, was he not mocked by his own
Son, so that his own mouth was feign to curse him* The same might also be
instanced in Abraham, Jacob, Job, David, Paul, and others; one might marvel
where they should have a breathing time; as one flood calls another, one wave
follows another, one Cloud after another comes over the face of the Sun, so
did their troubles and crosses as it were strive for place, and crowd to
prevent one another, the end of one being the beginning of another.

Reasons hereof may be these, Reasons.


1. To drive them to repentance, 2 Samuel 12. 18.
as the death of David's child begotten in adultery, Genesis 42* 21.
Joseph's brethrens hard usage in Egypt: They are as the Shepherds dog. to
fetch us out of the corn, to bring us into compass again; Psalm. 32. 4, 5. and
119. 67. 71.
which David acknowledged again and again: As they prepare some which have
never repented, so do they ^waken others to the renewing of their repentance.

2. To keep them from sin, Hos. 2. 6.
being therefore compa^ed to an hedge of thorns. Job 33* 17.


3. To humble them; 2 C^^on. 20. 37
we have a proud nature, and while we be in health, we think our heads half
touch the clouds, therefore God pulls us down by troubles; no rule in a house
where children be without rods: so the Lord should have no rule with us, were
it not that sometimes by himself, sometimes by others he chastises us.

4. To make them more holy, Isa: 4. 4.
to scourge off the rust, Heb. 12. 10.
purge out some of the rem^ant of this old man, Isa. 27. 9.
and renew the inner man. Afflictions are like the furnace, like the fan, like
physic, they are Gods pruning knife to cut off our superfluous branches, and
make us more fruitful, as the Gardener prunes the Vine yearly, that it may
fructify.

5. To wean them from the world, to which even the best are too much addicted,
and to make them willing to die, and to be gone hence, so setting them on work
to look after, and make sure of a better inheritance; how loath was Let to come
out of Sod^m, though it were then even ready to be burnt? what would have drawn
him out, if it had not been that? How loath were the Israelites to leave the
fleshy pots of Egypt, and go to Canaan, being there notwithstanding in
bondage* what would they have done* if they had lived there in honor as Joseph?
God was feign to raise up a persecuting Phara^h, whereby they were made to cry
(...) him, and he thereupon sent them Moses and (...), yet even then were they
scant willing.

6. To prove the Devil a li^^, who gives out, That Gods servants do serve him
for wages ( Does Job (says he) fear God for naught) that so they may triumph
in their obedience. Job. ^.


7. To keep them from hell and condemnation. Ioh ^^. 18.


8. To bring them to Heaven; 1 Cor 11. ^2.
no marvel then, Psalm 9^. 1^, 13.
if that man be blessed whom the Lord chasteneth, Heb. 12. 6.
his chastisements being indeed sight of his love. Therefore

1. We should not dream all of peace and prosperity here, Use 1.
but of trouble also; accordingly looking for it one after another; if God
spare us, it is because of our weakness, but look we not long to be spared, but
in the mean time gather strength; if we expect troubles, they prove the weaker;
if they come on us unlooked for, they daunt us the more. In our prosperity we
must think often hereof, thus reasoning with our selves, Well, now I am in
health, how shall I do when long and strong sickness shall lie upon me? now I
have wealth, what shall I do if all be taken away. and I be put to a poor
condition? now I am in mine own Country, House and Land, what should I do if I
were imprisoned or banished among them I know not? This will partly make us use
our present prosperity more soberly, and also we shall be fitter to meet with
adversity when it comes: if it come not, its labor well lost; if it come, well
bestowed.

2. We should bear them patiently, Use 2.
seeing not only we must needs undergo them, but they are so many ways for our
good: We must not then be dismayed at them, seeing even Gods dearest children
have undergone them, they have been their lot: But how loath are we to think of
troubles till they come? They will come time enough we say, but never the
sooner for thinking on them, it may be the longer, and to be sure the lighter.

3. We must be thankful for them, Use 3.
as we would be to one that tames our wild Horses or Steers, or to a Physician
for purging our superfluous humors. Its no matter, so as our souls gain, though
outwardly we smart: Shall we thank and reward the Physician for very untoothsom
Physic, and which makes us sick at the heart, and shall we be unthankful unto
God for healing our souls, what means soever he uses?

4. We must neither think them the better that are without affliction, Use 4.
nor them the worse that are afflicted; the latter may be happy, as the former
miserable.

5. We must make a right use of afflictions, Use 5.
whenever they come upon us.

Temptations] That is, troubles or trials.

But its said, Object.
God tempts none.

There be two kinds of Temptations; Sol.
one, Trials, by leaving us to our selves, 2 Chro. 32. 31*
as Hezekiah; or by afflictions (as here) to bring to light what is in us: The
other, Suggestions to persuade us to evil; of the first God is the author, of
the latter, the Devil and man.

Afflictions, Afflictions ar^ trials.
as Poverty, Sickness, Banishment, Imprisonment, are Temptations; they serve to
try what is in us, not but that God knows what is in us already (he knows
both the heart and reins) but that our selves and others may attain this
knowledge. Sometimes we overprize, sometimes we underprize our selves: But they
sometimes bewray hidden grace; as who would have thought of so much Faith in
Abraham, Patience in Job, Meekness in David and Moses, if they had not been
tried? Sometimes also hidden corruptions; for who could have thought of so much
weakness in Peter, and the rest of the Apostles, if they had not been tried? So
what grace has appeared in some, as weakness and impatience in others in the
time of affliction, neither of which before could have been believed?

Are afflictions trials? then

1. Labor we for such soundness of grace, Use 1.
that when afflictions shall come, they may find us pure gold and wheat, and
not cast us out for chaff and dross.

2. Do we consider that God now tryes us by them, Use 2.
and so look we to our selves, observing what they discover, if it be more
grace then we thought, that we may thank God; if more corruption, be truly
humbled, laboring for more grace: yea, whatsoever shall be discovered, we are
to thank God, as which will tend to our good. There Is therefore no cause why we
should be impatient in troubles, for they try us; and who would be unwilling to
be tried? Its a sign he meant not well that would not have his gold put to the
Touchstone; or he that proffering Land to be sold, would not have his Writings
perused.

In heaviness] Can heaviness and rejoicing stand together? Here on earth
heaviness and rejoicing may stand together.
A. They can in diverse respects and degrees: In Heaven where our joy shall be
in such an high degree and great measure, we cannot mourn, nor the wicked in
Hell rejoice; but here on Earth we may: The wicked be merry, because they have
their will, yet inwardly they are wounded in their consciences, for fear of
that which may come after; So the godly are joyful in the assurance of Gods
favor and Heaven, and yet heavy thorugh troubles which here lie upon them: As a
sick man hearing glad tidings may rejoice, and yet be heavy for his pain; a
Father also may be heavy for his childs death, and yet rejoice for his happy
end and godly departure: Ezra 3. 12, 13.
Amongst the Israelites upon the rebuilding of the Temple, some wept and others
rejoiced; both might have been (and happily were) even in some one.

Gods servants as by their Faith they are not freed from afflictions, so
neither from heaviness, Heb. 12. 11.
but have sense of their miseries, which are grievous to them, 2 Cor. 6. 10.
as Poverty, John 16. 20.
Sickness, Imprisonment, and the like; even our Savior himself mourned and
wept, and so he said his Disciples should: Nay, our Savior himself shed tears
of blood in his passion, saying, yea crying out, My soul is heavy unto the
death: Faith makes us not blocks, neither takes away sense, only moderates our
grief. The Martyrs had pain, but Faith prevailed and enabled them to bear it:
Where there is no pain, there can be no patience; nothing due to blockishness,
else were frantique persons worthy commendation, which feel nothing: Faith
moderates our grief, makes us wait upon God, speak good of him, using no
unlawful means when the cross is upon us.

1. This is contrary to that blockishness of the Stoics, Use 1.
that profess to be moved with nothing so much as to change countenance, but to
be at the hardest tidings, as if the joyfullest news had been brought them.

2. To those half Stoics amongst our selves, Use 2.
which think it too much weakness to complain or make moan in any affliction.

3. This may comfort the servants of God when they are pinchad hard by
troubles, Use 3.
and are affected thereat, and feeling pain declare it: Though they may be
thought impatient, they are not; God knows we be not iron, as long as Faith can
moderate; and we being heavy and pincht to the heart with pain, are yet
upholden with the joy of eternal salvation, Job 13. 15.
and can say with Job, Though he kill me, yet will I trust in him, in the mean
time using no unlawful means, our care is good: Job is renowned by S. James for
a mirror of patience, James 5. 11.
yet he rent his garment, Job 1. 20.
shaved his head, put on sackcloth, and the like.

For a season] Our afflictions are but short, The godlies afflictions are short.
as our life is, as a span long, as a vapor, a Weavers shuttle, a thought; yet
in this short time our good days have been ^o then our afflictions. 2 Cor. 4.
17. Psalm. 90. 9.


We think them long if they have been on us a few days, Psalm. 30. 5. and 125. 3.
but its our weakness, they are short in respect of that we have deserved, in
respect of the pains we be freed from, Isa 54. 7, 8.
and joys we go to.

If our enemy should burst with malice, he cannot hurt us after this life.

Therefore bear them patiently, Use.
think them not long: They that lie in Hell shall have a long task indeed; let
us think of our long eternal joy: we if our afflictions be but very short think
much, but look on Jacob and David, that from their youth were never free.

If need require] That is, See Cap. 3. 17.
as it seems good to God, as it pleases him, as he sees it fit and
expedient.

Hence note, that

Our afflictions come not to us at adventure, Afflictions come by the wise
disposing of Almighty God.
nor by the will of Satan and wicked men, for then woe to us, they would
afflict us too much; nor yet by our own will, for then either we would have
none, or too little; but they come by the will, providence, and wise disposing
of Almighty God, who is infinite in wisdom, and knows what is best for us:
who in love will do for the best to all his. Therefore,

1. We may bear them more patiently, Use 1.
seeing they come from our Master; Nay, from our most wise and gracious Father,
thanking him that he has not left us into the hands of Satan or any of his,
but has the rod in his own hand, and knows when to stay; with him is mercy,
with them none.

2. We must not rush into troubles, Use 2.
and draw them upon our selves, not being called of God thereto; but must be
wise as Serpents, we must save our heads, whilst we may lawfully, and not
exasperate men against us wilfully: Neither must we trust to our great
strength, for then we prove weakest; they have not always proved the stoutest
in the end, that have been forwardest to thrust themselves into trouble^ Our
Savior Christ bade them, when they were persecuted in one city, fly into
another, but if the will of God be that we shall suffer, we must be courageous,
and quit our selves like men.

Verse 7. That the trial of your Faith being much more precious then of Gold
that perishes, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise, and
honor, and glory, at the appearing of Jesus Christ.
HEre also he qualifieth their troubles from the end of them: A quilification
of their troubles.
They come not for our hurt, but for our good; Thereby we are no more hurt,
then Wheat is by threshing, or Gold by fining, they come for the trial of our
Faith, and tried Faith, is better then any tried Gold; For that will perish,
and be lost, but this will abide, and come forth to our honor and praise, at
the great appearing of Jesus Christ: It may be conceived, as if he had said,
The affliction and persecution which you now suffer, bear patiently, as serving
for the trial of your Faith, which (how painful soever the trial thereof may
seem for the present) will be found to your praise at the great day. This being
so, who should not willingly undergo them? If we take pains and toil our selves
to get riches, and so long as we get them, forget our toil; should we not much
more be concent to endure some trouble, that our souls may get the true riches?

Now particularly for the trial of our Faith afflictions come, 1. To try
whether we have any at all. 2. Whether it be so much as we take it to be. 3. To
purge and refine that which we have.

1. To try whether we have any Faith; Affliction tries whether we have Faith.
as God does it sometimes by false teachers and heresies, so does he also by
afflictions, wherein many that have not received the love of the truth have
been carried away; Iam. 1. 3. 2.
whereas others, Deuteronomy. 13. 3.
though happily of less parts, but more soundness, 1 Cor. 11. 19.
have resisted and stood to the truth; for there be false Faiths, and our
hearts are deceitful, and the Devil is subtle to make as believe we have the
right, when we have nothing less. Affliction will prove this, Mat. 4. 16.
as in those whom our Savior terms the stony ground, They went far, yea
farther then most in most congregations go, yet had they not that which would
serve to Salvation; affliction discovered what they were, that they were not
such as before they were taken to be. The Israelites were proved in the
wilderness, whose troubles manifested their unbelief; Heb. 3. 19.
for which they were both plagued in the wilderness, and shut out of Canaan.
Many a one thinks himself a tall man, till he comes into the field with his
adversary, where he proves himself a rank coward; many think they can do great
matters till they come to it: A Mariner is not tried till a storm, nor a friend
till adversity; he that then stick^ to one, is a friend indeed: So afflictions
have discovered many that have thought but too well of themselves: Many talk
that they believe in God, and put all their trust in him, yet when they are
visited with sickness, losses, and the like, they run to witches and wizards
for help, or in poverty, steal, lie, dissemble, or use any other unlawful
courses to help themselves: Many also that in prosperity profess the Gospel
very forwardly, when trouble comes fall quite away, are not only shaken as
Peter, or a good man may be on the sudden, or for a while, but fall quite away,
when many poor souls, it may be of less gifts, have stood out and suffered.

Seeing then that God will try us by troubles, Use.
we should labor to have true Faith against troubles come, How we may1 try our
Faith.
that we prove not dr^ss: Therefore let us try the Faith which we think we have
by the touchstone of Gods Word, Romans 5. 1. 11.
if it will abide that, then will it endure the furnace of affliction. 2 Pet.
1. 6, 7.
It may be tried, 1. By the manner of Gods working it, even through humiliation.
2. By such companions as go with Faith, or follow it, as peace, joy, and the
like; so if we love God most dearly (as they that have much forgiven, Luke 7.
47.
love much) if we love his Saints and people most heartily, Cant. 5. 8.
if we wonder at and admire his unspeakable mercy to us, 1 Ioh. 3. 14.
passing by so many thousands of others, Ioh. 14. 22.
with one hearts and mouths enlarged, Psalm. 103. 1.
praising him secretly and openly for the same; 1 These 5. 14.
if we pity, comfort and strengthen others, if we long to go hence where we are
absent from God, and to be with him; if we mourn for our sins committed against
him, 2 Cor. 5. 6.
who was kind to us when we wandered from him, Ier. 31. 18, 19*
and have an hatred of all evil, with an unfeigned care hereafter in all things
to please him, Romans 5. 8.
they are infallible tokens of a sound Faith: Its needful that we should thus
try our Faith, as being of that absolute necessity, that by it Christ and
Salvation are made ours, without it, no hope of either. In so weighty a thing
we had not need to venture without trial, without it no person or work is
pleasing to God, and its the foundation of a good life, and all true comfort
therein.

2. To try whether our Faith be as much as we take it to be, Affliction ^^^eth
whether our Faith be more or less then we take it.
or more; this affliction will discover: sometimes we think we have more then
we have, as Peter, who notwithstanding his bold and confident protestations to
our Savior Christ, shamefully upon the trial denied him. Contrarily, others
think they have little Faith, that upon the trial appears more, and shines
gloriously, as Jobs and David's. Who also could have believed that there had
been so much in many poor Martyrs, if they had not come to the field and
encountered with Tyrants, and their Torments? as who would imagine such
sweetness in Spices, till bruised?

We should not be against such afflictions as are sent for this end; Use.
for what is more comfortable then to know we have more Faith then we knew of?
and what more necessary, then to know that our Faith is weaker then we
imagined, that so we may labor to have it strengthened? If it appear weaker,
then be we humbled, and distrusting our selves, let us ever fly to God for more
grace and strength against temptations, so will God give us as much as shall
stand with his glory: but if we trust to our selves, and be slack in seeking to
God, then are we like to bewray our own weakness.

3. To purge and purify that true Faith which we have, Affliction ^^^veth to
purify and increase Faith.
and increase the same; this also is most necessary: for though a small Faith,
being true, will save us, yet the more and purer it is, the better it will
carry us to Heaven; and though by a weak Faith and mingled with corrution, we
shall see the face of God, and his loving countenance, ye^ the cleerer and
brighter it is, the more certainly and comfortably shall we see him: As they
that have weak eyes, yet see so as they are directed to their ways end, Simile.
who if they had cleerer, would be there sooner, and with less danger.

As therefore its requisite to have those gross humors purged th^^ dim the
sight, so those, corruptions that dim the eye of our Faith. Beside, such is our
corrupt nature, that much dross and corruption is mingled with the grace of God
in us; so as except it be subdued by continual affliction, it will wax wanton
against God, and hinder his grace in us. Simile.
Standing waters corrupt, and bodies not exercised, are full of gross humors:
So would it be with our souls, were we not continually exercised with troubles;
as the finest Wheat not fa^^ed, will be musty with dust, the finest clothes
catch dust and moths, if not continually brushed; the finest vessels take soil,
if not continually scoured: so our Faith not looked to, is quickly overgrown,
as the (...) with weeds, if the husbandman plucks them not out: As far, brush,
weeding-hook, Psalm. 119. 67. 71.
wisp, furnace, are to these things, so afflictions to the children of God. We
are as an untamed heifer, if not held under the yoke; Ier. 31. 18.
God therefore purges, scoureth and weedeth us, that his graces in us may
shine in their perfect colors: Simile.
As the Vine-dresser shreds his Vine, and cuts off much, which one would think
were against the Vine, yet makes it more fruitful, so does the Lord deal by
afflictions with his servants, which are his Vine branches.

Though the outward man decay (by sickness, poverty, disgrace, imprisonment, 2
Cor. 4. 16.
and the like) yet is the inner man (Faith, Hope, Comfort, etc.) increased
daily; for Faith the more its cut, the more it grows; the more its trodden on,
the thicker it comes up. And by afflictions there is purged away a great deal of
pride, self-love, worldliness, hypocrisy, and the like, which long peace
gathers, whereof Jonah had experience when he was cast into the Sea; those tame
us also: A man that was conceited against his neighbor for small causes in
prosperity, in sickness and affliction will be glad to take every one by the
hand; therefore are the most afflicted, for the most part, fullest of Faith and
Grace, and purer then others; and a man is never better then when he is in, or
newly come out of affliction. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 16.
Hence it is, that we are willed to be thankfulfor them, Iam. 1. 2. 12.
yea to account it exceeding joy when they come, those being blessed that are
so affected.

Being much much more precious, etc.] He sets out tried Faith by comparing it
with the most precious metal we have, 2 Pet. 1. 1.
even gold, preferring it by far before the same, Faith more precious then gold.
which is elsewhere termed also precious, and much more precious is it every
way. 1. Gold comes out of the earth, Iam. 1. 17.
Faith from Heaven, whence every good and perfect gift is. 2. Faith is more
rare, termed therefore the Faith of Gods elect, Tit. 1. 1.
whereas most, even of the most wicked, are not without gold. 3. Faith cannot
be purchased with all the gold in the world. 4. Its hardly gotten and hardly
kept, and has many and strong enemies, our own nature, the world and the devil
are all against Faith, but not so against getting of gold. 5. It apprehends
Salvation and life eternal, and so is the instrument of our happiness; so is
not gold, but the instrument of many a man's damnation, by unconscionable
getting, and covetous keeping the same, many cast away their souls. 6. It will
comfort a man with true comfort in his life, Iam. 5. 3.
carry him strongly through troubles, and boldly through the gates of death. 7.
Gold perishes, here canker and rust consume it; we may be taken from it, as it
from us, but Faith endures till Christ's appearing, to our full Redemption, as
the fruit thereof for ever.

The uses hereof are,

1. To them that want gold, Use 1.
and yet have Faith, know that thou art rich, Iam. 2. 5.
richer then he that has thousands of gold, and has not Faith; thou have
enough, that have Faith, it assures thee of eternal life, and entitles them to
Christ, yea, has the promises even of this life. See thou a worldly rich
man, and would thou change states with him? Oh but both would do well: Thou
can not tell if both would do so with thee; besides, God divides his gifts,
they that have much of the one, have less or none of the other; therefore as
long as we have of the best kind, let us think our selves well dealt with.

2. To the rich, Use 2.
Rejoice not that thou art rich, but that thou have Faith: Again, think all
your pains to become you well, and well bestowed in getting this precious
Faith. If any should say, What you? such wealthy men; its a disgrace to you to
toil so in hearing Sermons, which few do but mean persons; do not these exclude
themselves with their own mouths? But do not rich men travel to London, and to
Markets and Fairs to enrich themselves, and take great pains, and is it a shame
then or a disgrace for them to travel for that which is much more precious then
gold? Hereat if any wonder, tell them, You seek that which is more precious
then fined gold; and that you are so far from thinking your selves too good for
this, that you highly thank God for vouchsafeng you this favor: yea, that you
are so far from thinking that you credit the Gospel, and its beholding to you,
that you confess freely, that its your credit; and that if you have any thing
in you worth the commendation, you may thank the Gospel for it: for, as for
wealth it commends not a man, even reprobates are not without it.

3. To them that have not Faith, Use 3.
poor souls, labor after it, that you may be made inwardly rich; seek for it in
the means appointed, the preaching of the Word. But O poor and miserable
creatures, that regard it not for the most part, but think their poverty here
shall serve for all; but worse in the highest degree remains behind, if not
prevented in time, could any look into your souls, they might perceive them
more empty of grace, then the poorest houses are of provision.

4. To rich men that have toiled for gold, Use 4.
seek this that is so much better: Many toil by Sea and land, and undergo no
small perils to get gold, and to wax mighty, but as for Faith, they will scarce
stir over the threshold for it: But will your gold procure a pardon for your
sins? Alas, its no payment with God for any thing, especially sin: Will it
shelter when Death and Judgment comes? Alas no, it bears no sway in the other
world, see Job 36* 18, 19. Prove. 11. 4. Zeph. 1. 18. No, it will not abate your
pains in Hell one jot: O once consider your folly, and labor for that whereby
you may have comfort when you draw away, and your friends are thinking of a
Coffin to bestow you out of the house, and thereafter you may enjoy life
everlasting.

May be found unto praise, and honor, and glory.] The farthest end of our
affliction that our Faith thereby tried, Faith will be crowned at the last day.
may come forth to our honor at the great day. Tried Faith is better then any
thing that can be set by it, James 1. 12.
for all else vanishes, but our Faith will be crowned at the last day: 2 Timothy
4. 8.
Then will it be said, Well done good and faithful, servant, enter into thy
masters joy; Matthew. 10. 32.
and, Come ye blessed of my Father, etc. They that confess him before men, he
will confess them before God, which shall be no small honor: Matthew. 19. 28.
They which followed him in the regeneration, shall sit upon twelve Thrones, 1
Cor. 6. 2, 3.
judging the twelve Tribes of Israel; and The Saints shall judge both the world
and Angels: what pains soever we have taken to come to our Faith, and to keep
it, it shall not only comfort and honor us here in the Church, but hereafter
also in Heaven.

What an encouragement is this to them that have Faith, Use
and a provocation to all to labor for it? It will not only comfort us now,
and make us please God, but will give us boldness also at the great Day, when
the fearful and unbelievers shall stand trembling, and be cast into the lake
which burns with fire and brinstone; Rev. 21. 8.
yea, though our Faith be tried by afflictions and persecutions, yet we should
rejoice, for they will turn to our glory: Our shame, reproach, infamy,
imprisonment and troubles, will turn to our praise, and honor and glory at that
day; when we are reviled (by private persons) when persecuted by public
Magistrates and false Witnesses coming against us, yet we should not be
troubled, Mat. 5. 11, 12.
but rejoice, For great shall our reward be in heaven; our poverty shall be
recompensed with great riches, our shame with honor, Phil. 1. 28.
and if we be rejected of men, we shall be taken in of God: Yet do not our
afflictions or persecutions deserve any of this honor, as the Papists would
gather from hence, and from 2 Thessalonians. 1. 5, etc. Romans 8. 18.
Alas, no; For the afflictions of this present time, are not worthy to be
compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us: God indeed will crown his
own graces in us, and has promised to reward the sufferings of his servants
with glory; and so he is become our debtor, not by taking any thing of us, but
by promising us all things: We should therefore be comforted in all our
sufferings, and oppose unto the ignominy thereof, the glory and honor we shall
then have, which is infinitely greater: O who would not endure casting out by
men, being a token that we shall be honored of God, and taken in at that day.
Indeed if there were no day of Judgment, nor reward, we might be sorry; but
seeing there is, let us lift up our heads, and wait for that day: As the wicked
shall have a second course to mar all their mirth, so contrarily the godly to
swallow up their sorrow.

At the appearing of Jesus Christ.] Namely, to Judgment: True it is (as we
have heard) our souls enter into glory at death, but our perfect happiness is
not till the end of all; 2 Thessalonians. 1. 7.
besides, that which we have at death is not seen but to our selves, whereas
then it shall be manifest to all. We must be content to wait for our full
Redemption till then; Christ will come on the last day to Judge the world.
on that most solemn day shall we be honored by the Lord himself: Then shall
our Savior come to judge the quick and the dead; and though he defer to gather
his Elect, and be gone into Heaven, yet he will come, and that in another
fashion then he came first; namely, in wonderful majesty, glory and power,
which cannot but be a terror to his enemies.

1. This must needs comfort all that have and do still embrace Christ Jesus as
their Savior and King, Use 1.
for he shall be their Judge, and therefore shall it go well with them.

2. But woe to them that have despised him, Use 2.
where shall they appear? Not to appear is impossible; Psalm. 1. 5.
for He numbreth the stars, and calls every one by their name; he will not be
bribed, for he is more just, and besides, we have nothing to give. To escape
also is impossible, for he fills all places, and whether can he go, that has
this revenging Judge over his head, Hell under his feet to swallow him, on each
side Angels and Devils to torment him, within a tormented Conscience, and
without all the world on fire? And to abide his wrath its intolerable; Psalm.
76. 7.
for if when its but a little kindled no man can stand, then how when its all
on fire to consume his enemies utterly? Nah. 1. 6.
Kiss therefore the Sun, seek to be reconciled, get him thy Savior and thy
King, get pardon of that which is past, not adding more to the score against
thy self.

One thing more. The phrase here used seems to imply, that

The reward of Gods servants shall not be privy, The godly shall be publicly
rewarded.
but seen and known, yea and that of those that have most hated, disgraced and
persecuted them, accounting them mad, and esteeming basely of them; even before
them, I say, they shall be honored of God: As it will be a torment to the
wicked to see Christ whom they have pierced to be in such high dignity and
power; so will it increase their torment to see them whom they so basely
esteemed of, as not worthy to live, to be received into honor, and stand on
Christ's right hand, and themselves, of whom they were so well conceited, cast
out: But its just with God, that they which willingly and of purpose have vexed
and disgraced his servants here on earth, should against their wills see the
glory that he has prepared for them.

Verse 8. Whom having not seen, ye love, in whom though now ye see him not, yet
believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory.
HEre he proceeds to commend these believing Jews (yet withal admonishing and
exhorting them) and that for the great measure of their faith, and the fruits
thereof, love and joy, which are described by that which might have hindered
their faith, namely, that they never saw Christ, and yet believed in him, and
rested on him for salvation, and so loved him, as they were well content to
suffer for his Name, yea and rejoice with such a joy, as for the excellency and
greatness thereof could not be expressed. In that he commends them, its to this
end, that he might encourage and provoke them to go on forward, and increase
more and more. To this end does the Lord commend the good Churches in the
second and third of the Revelation; and S. Paul in all his Epistles, 1 Thessalonians.
4. 1, 10.
even that he might provoke them to go on in well doing: Whereat Ministers
should aim in commending their people.
And this must be the end of all good Ministers in the commendation of their
people, not of flattery (that were abominable, and being men-pleasers, they
could not be Christ's servants) nor out of a conceit that they have gone far
enough, and now may stand at a stay (that were senseless, Gal. 1. 10.
for that we have is nothing to that we might have had, or should have, and
want) but to be a spur to provoke them to go on forward, it being a shame for
them not to satisfy the expectation of such as have a good opinion of them;
and so must the people take such at any time, not being lifted up therewith,
but rather humbled thereby; conceiving, that the Minister rather shows what
he would were in them, or should be in them, then what is indeed in them; and
that he would not have them stand at a stay, but proceed and go on more and
more.

Speak we particularly first of their faith, though last set down, as without
which there can be no true love.

They never saw Christ, yet they believed in him; they saw the Scriptures
speaking of him to come; they heard of him also by faithful witnesses; the
Apostles had preached of his person, birth, life, death, resurrection and
ascension, and that he came to save them that were lost: This they believed,
and so believed in him for salvation, though they saw him not.

This shows the nature of true faith, Through faith we believe even things
above the reach of our reason.
namely, to believe things, not only that we see not, and are hidden from our
sense, but such things as are above the reach of our reason, and which we
cannot comprehend. So Abraham, when a son was promised by Sarah, stood not to
scan this by reason, Heb. 11. 1, 3. and 17.
but believed it, and is accordingly commended for it; So Joshua and the
Israelites compassing the walls of Jrricho: Genesis 17. 17.
Therefore both Zachariah and Sarah failed, Romans 4. 19, 20.
in that they doubted of Gods Promise, Heb. 11. 30.
for that it was against reason: Luke 1. 18, 20.
Hence it is that our Savior rebuked for his Thomas infidelity. Genesis 18. 12.
If all that Thomas had gone and preached to, Ioh. 20. 25, 29.
should have been of his mind, he would have made a poor preaching; Christ
must have come to the earth again, and here tarried: John 8. 56.
No; Faith has eyes, as well as the body; Abraham saw Christ's day, Heb. 11. 27.
and rejoiced; and Moses endured, as he which saw him that was invisible: Yea,
it has a more certain eye then the body, for it depends upon that which is
more constant then Heaven and Earth, even Gods Word, Job 19. 25.
which shall endure when the others shall vanish away; therefore is faith
called a knowledge, 2 Cor. 5. 1.
not a guessing uncertainty.

Hereby we believe the Incarnation of Christ, the framing of his body in the
womb of the Virgin, she untouched of man; so the mystery of the Trinity, and
the Resurrection, the Union of Christ and Believers, the glorification of our
bodies in the Kingdom of Heaven, and the like; yea, we so believe them, that
(as Moses was content to part from the honor of Pharaohs Court for the Kingdom
of Heaven, Heb. 11. 26.
so) for the assurance we have of them, we are content to forego both pleasures
and profits, which we have eagerly followed after; yea, to endure present pains
and losses, Heb. 10. 34. and 11. 35.
and that grievous ones, for the joys to come, not seen, but believed, whereof
we have store of Examples, both in the Scriptures and Church Histories.

1. This condemns Atheists, Use 1.
that reject all that they cannot conceive in their foolish and corrupt brain;
but Religion is not a matter of Reason, but of Faith: Woe were to us, if there
were nothing for us, 1 Cor. 15. 19.
but that which we see with bodily eyes; the wicked were then in better case.

2. It stirs us up to try whether we have faith, Use 2.
or not; If we so believe the things to come, as whatsoever would let us from
the joys of Heaven, we avoid it, and would rather endure any thing, then be
deprived thereof, we are not without faith: The wicked will not do so; they
will provide for the present time, they will have their will, will here take
their ease, enjoy their unlawful profits and pleasures; as for the time to
come, they are ignorant of it, what it will be: If any come after, so it is,
but they will make sure work for the present; a Bird in the hand, is worth two
in the bush: Neither will they suffer any thing for Religion, or the Gospel, or
hope of Heaven; a sign they want that grace of true faith: They have Carnal
eyes to see these things here below, but no Spiritual ones of faith to see the
things to come, and so give no glory to God: Hab. 2. 4.
But the just shall live by faith, and We walk not by sight, 2 Cor. 5. 7.
but by faith; Thus must we do here for maintenance, thus for deliverance out
of dangers. As Historical believing the truth of these things, puts a
difference betwixt Atheists and common Christians; so the particular believing
and applying these things, between these and true Christians. The servants of
God would not lose their part in that which is to come, for all that is here
present: They say, the Bird in the bush is worth two of that in the hand. If
the world count themselves wise that can save themselves from danger, and Gods
servants fools for suffering, See D. Tailor on Acts 10. page 296.
be it so; it shall one day appear who has made the best match: Oh, say they,
we are sure of this, we have it in hand, 2 Timothy 1. 12.
that you look for is uncertain; Well, as uncertain as it is, we will not
change with you, for we know whom we have believed.

If this be so, Obj.
then why may we not believe that Christ's body is bodily in the Sacrament,
under the signs of Bread and Wine, though our sense and reason say otherwise,
seeing our faith goes beyond both.

Though faith believes that which no sense nor reason can comprehend, Sol.
because God has said it, yet it crosses not our senses, and the things which
are daily subject to the same, Ioh. 20. 27.
wherein there is certainty: 1 Ioh. 1. 1.
If we might give no credit to our senses, there would be no end of conceits;
therefore seeing all our senses say it is Bread and Wine, we are to believe it
to be no other.

Whom having not seen, ye love] Now of the fruits of Faith, love and joy; for
its impossible for us to love him, unless by faith we be assured of his love to
us, 1 Ioh. 4. 19.
for we have not loved him, but he us first; so is it not possible, but
believing in him, we should love him, and his love must constrain us, having
done so wonderful things for us. Then

True love is the fruit of faith, True love the fruit of faith.
and it cannot be sundred from love to God, and our brethren for his sake: He
that knows, and believes that he has much forgiven, Gal. 5. 6.
must needs love much. 1 Ioh. 5. 1.


1. This confutes the Papists, Use 1.
which distinguish faith into formed and unformed, and that this latter is
sufficient to the salvation of the people, Charity giving a form to it; but we
must know that there is no true faith without it.

1. It serves to confute that Slander wherewith they burden, Use 2.
not us, but the Doctrine of the Gospel; namely, That Justification by faith
only, is a Doctrine of licentiousness: But while we establish faith, we set up
good works, as who teach that they cannot be sundred: Though works have no
place in our Justification, yet they are necessary to our Salvation.

3. Perceive the force and power of faith; Use 3.
faith made them love Christ, though they had never seen him, as which told
them of so great things done for them by him, whereby they could not but be
exceedingly knit in love unto him, and be content to suffer for him. Its an
increase of love, to love one we never saw; for sight moves much, and draws
the heart: but by faith we love that we never saw; as we love many good
Christians which we never saw, because by faith we believe that they be members
of Christ, and fellow members with us: So we love Christ, because we believe
what great things he has done for us, and that we shall see him one day in his
glory, when we also by him shall be set in possession thereof; so that if we
believe these things, 1 Ioh. 5. 1.
we cannot but love Christ, though we never saw him: How to try both our faith
and love.
Faith is not idle, but works by love to God, and to our brethren; and hereby
we may try our faith, as our love, by the fruits thereof: namely, 1. If we take
care unfainedly to keep his Commandments in one thing, as in another. Psalm. 97.
10.
2. If we love the brethren, Ioh. 14. 15. and 15. 14. and 21. 15.
which are members of Christ, so as we dare not harm them; yea, love them, not
only because they have his image restored in them, but are a part of Christ, 1
Ioh. 5. 3.
as it were, and of our selves. 3. If we be content to suffer for his sake, and
will not be plucked from him, but are vexed to see him dishonored by any. 4. If
we long for his coming, that so we may be with him, and married to him, to whom
we are already betrothed: Its the Churches voice (and should be ours in
particular) Come Lord Jesus. Rev. 22. 20.
If the husband be gone a long journey, his wife does not much love him, if she
never desire his coming home. 5. If in the mean time we desire to hear often of
him, Simile.
and from him; as the wife that loves her husband, will send or be often at the
Carriers to hear of her husband, and receive Letters from him: So must we
frequent the Word upon every occasion, where we may hear of him, and of his
great honor and glory, and of his providing us a place there, and of the glory
there, and how he would have us in the mean time to carry our selves, taking
heed of any other lover in his absence, which also does inform us, That his
coming draws nigh, and is at hand; Thus to hear of him, and from him, as much
and as often as we can, we should be desirous. By this Touchstone we may thus
try both our faith and love.

In whom though now ye see him not, yet believing,] Here Is the object of our
faith, Ioh. 3. 15, 16.
the Lord Jesus Christ.

The common people say, They believe in God, and trust in God; which is in
truth but mere self-deceiving: for though when we believe in Christ, Faith must
directly fasten it self on Christ Jesus.
we believe in Father, Son and holy Ghost; yet our faith must directly fasten
it self upon Christ Jesus, who has wrought our Redemption, and on our behalf
suffered all things; and so he must come in as a Mediator between the Father
and us, else how should we poor worms come to put our trust in that glorious
God, and being vile sinners, dare to look for any favor at his hands, but in
and by him; who without him is a severe Judge? How dare any poor wretch put his
trust in God for all good, that knows not that he is his God, nor how to
bring it to pass?

Here also the Divinity of our Savior Christ may be noted; A proof of the
Divinity of Christ.
for we may believe in none, but in God: If even he be cursed that puts his
trust in any other for outward things, Ier. 17. 5.
how much more for Salvation? Ioh. 1. 1.
He created all things, Tries the hearts, Forgiveth sins, Stilled the Sea with
his word; Mat. 9. 2. and 8. 26.
Raised the dead by his own power; all which point out his Deity: yea, it
appeared even in his greatest abasement; He took upon him the seed of Abraham,
Luke 1. 41.
but in this seed were all the Nations of the earth blessed; He was compassed
in the Virgins womb, yet even then at his presence John the Baptist sprang in
his mothers belly; He was laid in a Cratch, but even therein was he worshipped
by the Wisemen of the East; He was hungry, but he fed five thousand with five
loaves, and a few small fishes; He slept, but at his awaking he caused the
winds and waves to cease; He paid Tribute, but out of the fishes mouth; He wept
for Lazarus, but he raised him from the dead; He was taken by wicked hands, but
then he healed him with a touch whose ear was cut off; He was crucified and
dyed. but at the same time he darkened the Sun, and shook the earth, the vail
of the Temple rent, Mat. 27. 54.
which made the Centurion say, He was the Son of God; 1 Timothy 3. 16.
He was buried, but he raised up his body the third day; He was manifested in
the flesh, but justified in the Spirit.

And it was necessary that he should be both, else had he been no Savior for
us, which shows our great misery, and Gods great mercy: Who should not embrace
him, that abased himself so low for our sins? as if a King should rise from his
throne, Simile.
and row in a galley-slaves room; what then should not we be willing to do for
him? yea, to abase our selves to any service he requires of us on the behalf of
our brethren; but how few embrace him? how few entertain him with an humble and
contrite heart?

Ye rejoyce] The other fruit of Faith is joy; Joy a fruit of Faith.
being assured of so great things done for them by Christ, and so great things
prepared for them by him, they could not but rejoice; for as the feeling of
Gods wrath for our sins is fearful, Prove. 18. 14.
and cannot be endured ( a wounded spirit who can bear?) as may appear by the
heavy cries and complaints of some of Gods servants in agony of conscience, O I
am cast out of his sight, I shall perish, O what shall I do! but especially by
the desperate horror of the wicked, who feel it so intolerable, as that they
cannot bear it, as Judas, who went and hanged himself; for no man seeing and
feeling himself under the wrath of God, and no way to be freed therefrom, but
must needs wish he had never been, or now were not, Psalm. 4. 7.
or were a Toad, or the vilest creature: so contrarily, they that feel
themselves freed from this, Romans 15. 13.
and called to the hope of so great glory, must needs rejoice; as Joseph
doubtless was a glad man, when being delivered out of prison, he was advanced
to honor.

The way hereunto is true Faith: Use 1.
Worldlings indeed think Christianity a dumpish estate, but its the only
estate wherein we may be merry; and whosoever is merry, not being assured of Gods
favor, is a desperate person: as if one were merry that hanged over a deep pit
by a twined thread.

In the midst of their mirth, Use 2.
the wicked have secret gripes; as thieves condemned, though they drink and
play at cards, yet to think that on the morrow they must be executed, chokes
them and their mirth.

The wicked also can be merry in nothing but some wickedness or other, as if
one should be merry when he eats and drinks poison, when he slashes and cuts
himself; for hereby provoking God, they increase their own damnation.

This joy then coming from Faith, Use 3.
comes not from our works, or any thing that we can do: Why no true joy can
proceed from our selves.
These cannot bring sound peace to the mind, or quiet to the conscience, or
joy to the heart; for 1. We have many sins, and therefore can merit nothing of
God. 2. We know by our selves, that even many of them are unto us unknown: who
knows the errors of his life? Psalm. 19. 12.
no man can say, he has found out all his sins, or the corruptions of his
heart, so that he can say, now here be no more. 3. Our best duties be mingled
with much weakness and imperfection; so that though they may appear before men,
and be well accounted of and reverenced, yet when they come before God, then
they must hide themselves; as the Stars and Moon show a goodly light in the
night; but when the Sun appears, they appear not. The Nazarets vow was pleasing
to God, Numb. 6. 13.
yet the time thereof being expired, there was a sacrifice appointed for the
sin of such a one; what, of such a one, as had lived and served God in that
strict order? yea, even they must acknowledge no desert, but as they stand in
need of mercy, earnestly call upon God for it, Who will show mercy to thousands
of them that love him; and keep his commandments: our works then, or any thing
that we can do, cannot bring us sound peace and joy, as being imperfect and
unable to abide the justice of God; but Faith, that lays hold on the all
sufficient merit and satisfaction of Christ, and his most perfect
Righteousness, whereby they are made ours, brings us great joy, as whereby we
dare come before God with boldness and confidence.

Unspeakable and full of glory] What manner of joy is that of believers? The joy
of belivers is unspeakable.
Unspeakable, such as cannot be uttered with the tongue: why? because it is for
glory and happiness, which is unspeakable; for such things as neither eye has
seen, 1 Cor. 2. 9.
nor ear heard, therefore such as the glory is, such is the joy, its an
everlasting weight of glory: a wise man joys according to the object of his
joy, but a fool reioyeth in a trifle of nothing; unspeakable things are
believed, therefore it must needs be an unspeakable joy.

Full of glory] Not a vain, Their joy also is a glorious joy.
carnal or flitting joy; that will fail and shame them that have had it, but a
glorious joy, in the glorious Lord Jesus Christ and everlasting glory; glorious
things believed, bring a glorious joy: Psalm. 103. 1.
What was David's when he said, Bless the Lord, O my soul, Psalm. 116. 12.
and all that is within me bless his holy name, etc. and, What shall I render
to the Lord for all his benefits toward me? What the Virgin Mary's, Luke 1. 47.
when she said, My spirit rejoices in God my Savior? and cannot many a
Christian say, that after long and heavy seeking after God and Christ Jesus,
God has sent down such glimpses of joy into their hearts, as they could not
express; and would think, O if this would always last, it were a little heaven;
and so it were indeed, for its the same joy for quality, that we shall have in
heaven, though the quantity be but small in comparison.

Here then see the happy estate of a Christian above all other men, Use.
and the difference between the joy of all rich worldings, that fat themselves
in their rich comings in, and richly furnished tables, and coastly attire, and
the godlies; for do these bring unspeakable joy? O no! there is indeed small joy
in them, besides much vexation that accompany them; and what a torment is it
for such to think, that they must be snatched from this in a moment, and are
provided for no better? neither is their joy glorious, but base and childish,
that turns into shame in a few days; their joy is in vain things, and not in
things that abide; Phil. 3. 19.
they rejoice in the Creature, not in the Creator; yea, their glory is their
shame.

Verse 9. Receiving the end of your Faith, even the salvation of your souls.
Here Is the ground of their joy, the end and reward of their Faith, the
salvation of their souls: Salvation of their souls, why, was there any danger
of the contrary? O yes! By nature, and through sin, Every man is danger of
utter destruction.
we have deserved the utter damnation both of our souls and bodies, but through
Christ we escape it, and obtain, the salvation of both; every man is in this
danger, neither is there any help to be had, but in and through Christ
apprehended by Faith. Acts 4. 12.


How then does it behoove every man to bestir himself about this so weighty a
matter? Use.
For what shall it profit a man, Mat. 16. 26.
to win the whole world, and lose his own soul? yet the most makes small
account hereof, but rather set themselves altogether about their profits and
pleasures, O madness to be condemned! nay, if they see any earnest about this,
they wonder what they mean; what they mean? they seek salvation; if thou wonder
at that, wonder still; but the time will come, when thou will wonder at thine
own folly, that sought'st not after this, though thou had missed of
whatsoever else: when thou see any grieve and mourn, wondrest thou what they
ail? Its for the want of salvation, as thou art when thou want money; if
thou think their grief and heaviness to be but melancholy dumps of foolish
weak folks, which they may shake off at their pleasure, and be merry as
formerly they were wont, thou art much deceived.

Receiving] He says not you shall receive, but receiving in the present tense:
The godly by faith do even here enjoy salvation.
Whence note, that

The Servants of God by faith do even here enjoy Salvation and Eternal life,
even presently we have glory, though not in the fullness thereof; 2 Cor. 3. 18.
1. Because we are as sure of it, as if we had it, as who have Gods Hand for
it, even his Word, 2 Cor. 1. 22.
his Seal, his Sacrament. 2. Because even here we have the earnest of it, Ephesians
1. 13, 14.
which is his Spirit; when earnest is given between honest men, Ioh. 3. 36.
there is no going back; and shall God say, and not do it? See also Ioh. 5. 24.
shall he promise, and not perform? He is not a man, that he should lie or
repent: He that believes on the Son (says the Son himself) has everlasting
life. 3. Because by faith we are already entered into the first degree of it;
being knit to Christ, and so perfectly justified, we are come to the suburbs of
our glory, and are as it were at the gate, lacking nothing but to be let in by
death: As we say to our friends, having come a long way to a City, and are but
at the walls thereof, Rom 8. 23.
and not entered therein, Now we are at it, ye are welcome to this place; Ephesians. 2.
5, 6.
so having received the first fruits of the Spirit, we may thereupon affirm
that we are in Heaven. Heb. 12. 22, 23
This shows the happy estate of true believers, Use.
that are so sure of their happiness, and as it were entered upon it already:
Thou therefore that believe, be of good comfort, thou art even as sure of
Heaven, as if thou were there already; Rejoice always, serve God cheerfully,
and bear afflictions patiently: Being at the suburbs, thou want but letting
in, when Death as the Porter shall open the gate. Thou have paid the price, and
have good Evidence to show for it, which by thy learned Council is judged sound
and good; God has given thee his own Writings, and thou have sure under his
Hand and Seal, only thou want Livery and Seisin, which thou shall have in
good time, which in the mean time is never the farther from thee.

The end of your Faith] Or the reward which God has promised so often, No
pains too much to get faith.
who would not take any pains to get faith, being so rewarded? The world
wondreth at them that take pains to hear the word, yet this is the means of
faith, which is the instrument of Salvation; yet wonder they not at themselves
and others, that travel weekly as much and more for worldly trash, Use.
who for faith would scarce stir their foot over the threshold: But do not we
rest our selves either upon our gifts of Knowledge, Utterance, Profession, show
of Zeal, outward Civility, Ephesians. 2. 8.
and the like, for nothing will save us but faith, and Salvation is the end
hereof. If a man had lived in the days of Christ, and both heard him, conversed
with him, and seen his miracles, yet without faith he might be damned, as
Judas: Were one the kinsman of Christ, should he handle him in his arms, nay,
were one his mother, what would the same avail without faith? Therefore refuse
no pain to get faith; for though its beginning be bitter, yet its end is happy.

If the Apostle had said, Salvation not the end or reward of our Works.
End or reward of your works, the Papists would have had their mouths made up,
and run away with a full cry, Lo here, whether our Works merit not Heaven and
Salvation, or no: Alas! there is no such matter; Can they not distinguish
between Merit and a Reward freely given? True, the Scripture calls Heaven a
Reward, and promises the same to them that hold out in welldoing; but does it
not also call in an Inheritance? and who knows not that that is free? There are
two kinds of debt, one of desert, and another of promise; Herod made
conscience to keep his rash Oath to the daughter of Herodias, she deserved it
not, but he promised it: And when God promises Eternal life to constancy in
well-doing, is it to puff us up, as if we did deserve it? no such matter, its
only to help our weakness.

He calls us to deny our selves, to wean our selves from the pleasures of this
world, See Mr. Greenham, page 754.
to suffer Reproach, Persecution, and the like; now these be harsh to our
nature, therefore to encourage us, God makes these Promises, and accordingly at
the end of our work, we shall have the thing promised, We cannot inherit heaven.
not because we have earned it, but because Christ has purchased it, and God
has promised it to us. That we cannot merit heaven, may thus appear; 1.
Because our best works be stained with many imperfections; and what is good in
them, is Gods gift, not our goodness. 2. Because there must be some proportion
between the thing merited, Romans 8. 18.
and that wherewith, but here there is none; as a man cannot buy a great Manor
for a trifle, so the things we can do or suffer here, are not worthy the glory
to be revealed. 3. Because that whereby we must merit, must be free, and that
which we are not bound to do; but we are bound to do all that we can, and
having so done, we have done but our duty, and consequently not merited; As if
we had a lame servant, Luke 17. 10.
and as soon as he did a little service, he would think he merited of us, when
if he could do much more, by the state of a servant, he owes us more; 1 Samuel
18. 23.
David said, Seems it a small thing to you, to be son in Law of a King? (yet
hereby should not he have had the Kingdom) howsoever by his Victories he
deserved well; what then should we in respect of God? But as the whole
Scripture labors to beat down our Pride, Arrogance, and any Conceit that we
might have of any thing in our selves, so this place says, The Salvation of
our Souls, is the end and reward of Faith, not of Works; and yet not the reward
of Faith, as if it merited any such thing, as it is a Grace in us, no, but
only it apprehends it an instrument, that whereby we are justified and saved,
and that which meriteth our Salvation.

The Salvation of your souls.] Believers shall have also the Salvation of their
bodies.
Not but that the servants of God shall have Salvation of their bodies also, as
being made by God, rede^r^ed by Christ, and shall be glorified after the
Resurrection; and therefore Christ took not only a soul, but an humane body
also: but he speaks of the soul, as of the principal part, which first
enters into Glory; and for the bodies of Gods servants, wherewith they
endeavor to praise and glorify God, they shall be glorified as well as their
souls.

Be we therefore encouraged even in our bodies, Use.
to take pains in Gods service; never a member that honors him, but shall be
filled with honor at the last day, and for ever.

But what is that we have, and our Faith finds in Christ Jesus? not Ease,
Health, Worldly Honor and Preferment, but Salvation; 1 Cor. 1. 30.
CHRIST was not made these unto us, but Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification
and Redemption: We have by him also right unto outward things, and possession
of as much as shall be meet, but so as we may have and must expect, to drink of
the same cup that our Master did, even to meet with Reproaches, Afflictions and
Trouble.

When must therefore when we follow Christ, What those are to look for that
follow Christ.
or embrace him and his ways, not expect all Prosperity here, and Ease and
Contentment outwardly, but rather think of the contrary, that it may appear
that we follow him not for any by-respect; See Mat. 8. 19.
but Salvation we shall have, and he that thinks not that sufficient, though it
be joined with troubles, knows not its worth. The favor of God, the Kingdom
of Heaven, is great riches, though not accompanied with outward either pleasure
or profit: Ioh. 6. 26.
Many profess Religion for advantage, and many will profess so long as no hurt
comes of it, but if any trouble arise, then they give over.

Verse 10. Of which Salvation the Prophets have enquired and searched
diligently, who prophesied of the Grace that should come unto you.
HAving spoken of Salvation by Christ, laid hold upon by Faith, which they had
obtained; He now commends and sets forth this Salvation and the means thereof,
to be the only true way, and the Gospel revealing it to be the most blessed
and excellent Doctrine that ever was: for 1. Its no new device of any, or first
preached by the Apostles, but that which the holy Prophets that have lived in
all ages (men endued with the Spirit of God) have studied and enquired into,
and found, and have in their writings prophesied of the same; enquiring also to
know the time when our Savior Christ should be exhibited into the world; who
understanding by the Spirit, that he was not to be born in their days, but in
the last ages of the world, yet seeing him afar off, were glad, and took it
thankfully, and so believing in him, were saved by him. 2. That the Gospel and
Salvation by Christ, was preached by the holy Apostles, men set apart by God
for that business, endued with his Spirit that came on them from Heaven; and so
its the same that was known to our Forefathers, and Patriarks, and Prophets,
not varied, but the same Doctrine and constant way of Salvation. 3. That the
very Angels as they wondered at the wonderful mystery of Christ's Incarnation,
and learned (as is very probable) something by the Apostles Ministry, which
they knew not before; so, into the fullness of this Salvation they desired to
see. So we have a commendation of the Gospel, or the way of Salvation therein
preached: 1. By its antiquity; the Prophets knew and embraced it: 2. The
Apostles not of their own heads, but by the Spirit extraordinarily sent upon
them, preached it. 3. The Angels desire further to see into it. In the Prophets
search we are to observe, 1. The substance they sought. 2. The circumstance of
time: for the substance, it was privately for their own benefit, who therefore
enquired into it, and searched it our diligently; and publicly, for the
benefit of the Church, who therefore prophesied of it.

Of which salvation the Prophets have enquired, etc.] In that the Apostle, No
point touching salvation is to be taught or received, but what is grounded on the
Word.
to prove that this was the true way of salvation, produces the writings of
the Prophets in the Old Testament, learn, That for all matters of faith that we
reach the people, and would have them receive, we must ground them on no other
proof, but the Word of God; no point ought to be admitted touching salvation,
whereof God is not the author, and author he is of nothing, but of that which
is in his written Word, 2 Timothy 3. 16.
which is a perfect Rule, able to teach all truth, and confute all error.

1. This confutes the Papists, Use 1.
who lean so much on Councels, as they banish the Scripture as a dumb Judge: Of
those, howsoever the more ancient of them are to be reverenced, and did
worthily oppose and conclude against the Heresies of their Times; yet even in
them some things are left rawly, whether those worthy men intending the
greatest, less regarded smaller matters, or whether they erred as men, that we
might not put too much confidence in them, or give too much to them: But for
many latter ones, they are patcht by the Pope and his Adherents, which will be
sure to do nothing against him, and the greater part overcomes the better part;
Therefore we are not to rest in these, Isa. 8. 20.
but go to that Law and to that Testimony, which alone must Judge and bear Rule
in the Church: For, though Christ has promised, Mat. 18. 20.
that where two or three be gathered together, he will be amongst them, yet
they must be m^t in his Name; which is, when they all submit themselves to the
Word of God, and suffer Christ to be President of their Assembly by his Word,
and not when they will set up Conceits of their own devising.

2. Ministers must learn in all matters of faith, Use 2.
to bring forth the written Word of God, Luke 24. 27.
and not men's Judgments, which are of no force to stablish the Conscience,
Acts 18. 28.
neither Popish Traditions, by them termed Apostolical and unwritten Verities.

3. People also for their part must receive nothing, Use 3.
but that which they see grounded hereupon: Ioh. 5. 39.
To this end they are to search the Scriptures, Acts 17. 11.
and with the Berea^s to confer place with place, to find out the truth: Gal.
1. 8, 9.
If an Angel from heaven should bring any Doctrine contrary to this, we are to
hold him accursed. Assuredly, for want of Catechizing publicly, and reading
the Scripture privately, if a cunning Heretic should in most Congregations
open his pack of Wares, they would go for current, few or none being able to
control him.

Enquired and searched] The words imply the great pains they used herein, The
Prophets took great pains to know the mystery of our salvation by Christ.
as Daniel by prayer, fasting and meditation: They had a little hint from God,
and they found the savor of it, so as they followed it most earnestly to get
out more, and plodded upon it to see further and further. Dan. 9. 3.


What then are all of us to beat our heads, and to set our hearts upon? even
upon the mystery of our Salvation by Christ, that we may 1. Know it, and every
part thereof. 2. Give full assent thereto. 3. Labor for a particular persuasion
thereof by faith. These things belong to us, whom it much concerns to know
this by an effectual knowledge, Ioh. 17. 3.
feeling the power of Christ in us, Phil. 3. 8.
causing us to dye to sin, and live to righteousness; 1 Cor. 2. 2.
and this we should do: 1. For that its the chiefest thing in the world; Its
life eternal to know him, and all is dung to this; yea, we should desire to
know nothing but Christ, and him crucified. 2. Because in seeking we may find
more in one day, then all the Prophets and Fathers could find by all their
diligence all the days of their life.

This condemns the monstrous Unthankfulness of our days, Use.
that make no reckoning of this so blessed Gospel, of those glad tidings that
should be the glory of the world, without which the world is dead in sin, and
comes to confusion. O how few regard to hear the Word? Many run to Sports and
Pastimes, others to Markets and Fairs, but in many places, what thin Churches?
their Oxen and Farms draw them away: Others hear, yet it is without any regard,
any life; Israel never loathed Manna more, then most do the preaching of the
Gospel; O they have had Sermons in many Congregations, until they have even
loathed them! O how few can be brought to see their own misery! how few to
prize Christ, and to whom he is indeed welcome, how few that will stoop to his
yoke! Sundry in show would have him their Savior, and talk that they hope to be
saved by Christ, but that is but a Bawd for their sins, whereby they may go on
the more freely in them; yea, are not the truest and painfullest Preachers and
Professors of the Gospel hated? what this will come to, is easy to see;
assuredly (being like Ch^razi^ and Bethsaida) we may justly fear some judgment
at hand. Time was, when Christ was welcome amongst us, and the kingdom of heaven
suffered violence (as happily it does still in some parts of the land) but O dead
hearts, and unthankful in most places. Those under the Law, saw but a little,
yet took it thankfully; we have much revealed, yet little regard it: To prize
the Gospel, and seek after Christ, will be our wisdom and welfare; then to
enquire for Salvation by Christ, there can be no greater thing, it becomes us
well: if for this we be counted fools, well, we be such fools as the Prophets
were, who enquired and searched after Christ; God be thanked for our so doing,
let us continue in Gods name; this shall bring us comfort living and dying,
when carnal Wordlings shall perish for want of comfort, and go to hell.

But did they only enquire after Salvation, and the way to it, and found it
not? Yes, as they foretold Christ to others, so did they find that in him they
sought for, The Prophets and old Fathers were saved by Christ as well as we.
and were saved by him.

The Prophets and old Fathers were saved by Christ as well as we.

This confutes two pestilent Opinions, 1. That of the Anabaptists, That the
Fathers had no other but earthly Promises and Rewards, Acts 4. 12. and 15. 8.
and there was an end, Heb. 13. 8.
and had no heaven, nor hope of any such thing; most vile; Use. 1.
for 1. God gave them his Word, which was to convert their Souls, Psalm. 147.
19. and 19. 7, 23
and to be an immortal seed, to beget them to eternal life; and the Prophets in
their times were filled with the Spirit of God; Romans 3. 2.
but God did not all this for nothing. Zech. 7. 12.
2. He made a Covenant with them, Levit. 26. 12.
I will be your God, and you shall be my people: Now to have God to be our God,
contains not only Earthly things, but Heavenly and Eternal, Psalm. 33. 12.
For blessed is the people, whose God is the Lord: Our Savior Christ says,
Mat. 22. 23.
God is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, not of the dead, Mat. 8. 11.
but of the living; so that they live not in Soul only, but in Body also to
Godward, Heb. 11. 13.
for he will surely raise them up again: Genesis 47. 9.
Jacob speaking unto Pharaoh, mentioned the days of his Pilgrimage; both he and
the rest confessed themselves Pilgrims: see what construction the Holy Ghost
makes hereof, Heb. 11. 15.
namely, That this was in respect of some other Country; but what Country,
Earthly or Heavenly? If Earthly, then that from whence they came, Caldea; but
if it had been that, they had leisure enough to have returned thereunto, but
they desired a Heavenly, therefore God prepared for them a City, even such a
one as they desired, Job. 19. 25.
an Heavenly one. Job believed that his Redeemer lived, Luke 16. 23.
and Abraham's bosom is put for Heaven.

But such speeches as Jobs, Obj.
are of some few principal men, and not of the people, with whom no doubt it
was as with us, most understood not, neither believed, though others did.

This comes of a false understanding of the Promises. Sol.
The Lord provokes them to keep his Law, and promises them a plenteous Land*
and threatened the loss thereof if they obeyed not; But who knows not, that as
Egypt was a Type of their Spiritual bondage, so Canaan, of Heaven, 2 Cor. 5. 7.
and Heaven promised under it? even as the Lamb in the Passover was a Type of
Christ, the true Paschal Lamb and Christians Passover, as the Apostle affirms.

2. That of those which affirm, Use 2.
That they were saved by some other way (not by Christ as we) and what? by the
keeping of the Law, its otherwise; The Law was not to this end given them, that
they might be justified thereby, more then to us, or that they could keep it
more then we; for never could any keep it, but to show Gods perfect
righteousness, and their own sinfulness, and so drive them out of themselves,
to Christ the true Sacrifice: Notable is that Speech of Saint Peter, Acts 15.
10.
Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the necks of the Disciples,
which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear: He means not here, the
Ceremonial Law, wherein an hypocrite might go as far as another; Mat. 19. 20.
nor the bodily observance of the Moral Law (whereof the young man bragged so
much) but the true Spiritual Rule of Righteousness, which never any could keep;
so they were saved by the Grace of Christ as we: See Romans 3. 30.
Abraham's Faith was imputed unto him for Righteousness, and he was justified
both before he was Circumcised, and four hundred years ere the Law was given.

Who prophesied of the Grace that should come unto you.] The Doctrine of the
Gospel not new.
The Doctrine of the Gospel is no new device of man, nor first Preached by the
Apostles, Romans 1. 2. and 3. 21.
but almost as old as the World: The Spirit has given testimony of it in all
ages, all the Prophets have looked into it; some Promises were given unto
particular persons, some did concern all in general; those especially which
were delivered by the Prophets: This was signified by all the Sacrifices and
Washings in the Law, wherein there was an acknowledgement of guiltiness and
uncleanness, Heb. 9. 12.
and a promise of something to satisfy and cleanse; 1 Ioh. 1. 7.
which was not the blood of Bulls or of Goats, Rev. 13. 8.
but of Jesus Christ, who is therefore said to wash away our sins by his blood,
and to be the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.

This condemns that wicked slander of the Church of Rome, Use.
that style our Religion, The new Gospel, or a yesterdays Religion; Nay, theirs
is a new Religion; who knows not, that though the Mystery of Iniquity began
already to work in the Apostles times, and the Devil had spread some Heresies;
yet alas, Popery was not then hatched, and it was not come to the top, till
within these three or four hundred years bypast, the whole being at several
times patched up with several pieces, by one Pope after another: and new it is,
as being of man's brain, most things therein having no ground in the Word of
God, nay, altogether contrary thereunto.

The Prophets foretold of Christ, The Prophets foretold of Christ.
and that very fully, of his Nature, Offices, Birth, Life, Death, Sufferings,
Patience, Resurrection, Ascension, etc. See Genesis 49. 10. Isa. 7. 14. Isa. 9. 6.
Jer. 23. 6. Isa. 53. 8. Zach. 12. Psalm. 110. 1, 4. Isa. 61. 1. Dan. 9. 25. Mic.
5. 2. Psalm. 22. 16. Psalm. 16. 10. Psalm. 68. 18. Hag. 2. 7, etc.

This shows what an agreement and blessed harmony there is betwixt the Old
Testament and the New; The harmony between the Old and New Testament.
no diverse matters, but the same Christ, the subject matter of both, driven at
in the Law, pointed out in all the Sacrifices: Act. 18. 28.
The Old Testament is the New folded up, the New, Luke 24.
is the Old unfolded and opened, the one proving the other; and hence are these
Phrases, As it is written, And that it might be fulfilled.

1. This condemns them that reject the New Testament and Christ Jesus, Use 1.
and yet retain the Old, as the Scribes and Pharisees did, and Jews and Turks
do; Ioh. 5. 46, 47.
but hold one, and hold both, deny one, and deny both. O the lamentable
blindeness of the Jews, that were so well acquainted with the Old Testament,
which did so foretell Christ! and yet when he came, in whom all was fulfilled,
they could not see it; a forestalled conceit of an earthly Potentate hindered
all.

2. It teaches us to labor to be acquainted with both, Use 2.
and reverence both, the one giving light unto the other; and they especially
that are of better understanding, and have more time, let them read orderly,
not here and there a Chapter, and that most or always in the New Testament, but
going on throughout both; They that are slow and dull, and can read little, no
matter though they hold themselves most to the New; but for the others, let
them be acquainted with both: Are we ignorant of the one? its for want of
acquaintance with the other; Has God set on work his holy Prophets, to
Prophefie such things as be greatly for our Confirmation, and kept them through
so many storms of Persecution, and shall we not be conversant therein? yea,
those Chapters that seem of least use in Leviticus, touching cleansing of many
sorts of uncleanness, have this main use, even to teach, That God cannot abide
sin, but that it must be cleansed through the blood of his Son: the Chapters
also of Genealogies in Numbers and Chronicles, are of good use for the
understanding of the rest of the Scriptures, though but a few understand the
same.

Of the Grace] He calls Salvation Grace, Salvation why called Grace.
and that most worthily, as being freely both Elected, Ioh. 3. 16.
Redeemed, and Effectually called.

poor miserable sinners: 2. Them that challenge part in Christ, and all that he
did, and yet show no part of thankfulness and duty again, but live as they
list, and will not only not part with their lives, but not with their lusts
for his sake, they are liars, and deceive their own souls.

2. It should teach us to acknowledge the whole work of our Salvation to be of
Grace, Use 2.
and thereupon to walk the more thankfully and zealously; The Prophets did
partake of Salvation, though they saw not.
yea, often meditate of this Free Grace and Salvation, whetting up our selves
thereby.

That should come unto you.] Why? were they not partakers of Salvation
themselves? Yes, as we have heard, but they never saw the time of Christ's
exhibiting in the flesh, Christ in the flesh.
nor so clearly; They received not the promises, Heb. 11. 13.
only saw them afar off, and were persuaded of them.

Verse 11. Searching what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was
in them did signify, when it testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ,
and the glory that should follow.
SEarching what or what manner of time] They took great pains to know Christ,
and would gladly have learnd that he should have come in their days, so they
should have had a clearer Revelation; yea seen him whom they so much longed for
and loved. Luke 2. 25.
Simeon waited for the Consolation of Israel, Luke 10. 24.
as many Prophets and Kings desired to see and hear thereof; and this was
lawful, We must endeavor to know what is profitable to be known.
unless God had enjoined the contrary: If then we know a thing to be good and
profitable to be known, we must refuse no pains in searching it out, but Study,
Meditate, Pray, Confer, Read, etc. Prove. 2. 3, 4.
We must call for Wisdom, and cry for Understanding; we must seek and search
for her, as for silver: The Word is like a Noble man, that one must make some
suit, and use some means to come unto; with which being once acquainted,
wherein can it not pleasure us? when we have sued to it by pains, it will be
beneficial unto us indeed: whereas profane Books (easily enough attained unto)
usually work much mischief; many of us read much of the Scriptures, but take no
notice whether we understand the same or not, or take no pains to come to
knowledge: to be inquisitive of the meaning of this or that place of Scripture,
Use.

or both.

As they desired to see Christ's first, so should we long for his second coming.

The Spirit of Christ which was in them] See how they sought into this matter,
not of their own heads, but by the guidance and direction of the Spirit; and
that 1. Because it was a matter so high and above their reach, as in which they
could know nothing without the help of the Spirit. 2. To avoid curiosity,
searching no further then God should see good to reveal unto them.

This teaches us, Use 1.
that when we search into any point of Doctrine, or to know any thing, we must
not go to work by our own head or wit (for that were Pride and the way to
Error) but by the help of the Spirit; and therefore no further then the Spirit
shall guide us: this we do, if we keep our selves to the written Word of God;
for Gods Spirit teaches us according to the Word, and no otherwise.

This condemns the frenzy conceits of the Anabaptists, Use 2.
which boast of Revelations of the Spirit; counting whatsoever comes in their
head, and they conceive (though contrary to the Scriptures) to be a Revelation,
which is wicked; for the Word and Spirit cannot be divorced, either the one
contrary to the other: We must hold us to the written word, searching thereinto
according to sobriety, proceeding no further then it, and there staying where
it stays.

This is also contrary to the Papists, Use 3.
that will have their humane Traditions and unwritten Verities, whereby upon
the point they overthrow the Scriptures. Gods Spirit the Author of the Old
Testament.
Again, in that the Spirit of Christ was in the Prophets when they prophesied,
see the authority of the Old Testament; the Spirit of God is the Author of it,
therefore is it to be highly esteemed as the New, 2 Pet. 1. 21.
and all questions are to stand and fall by the sentence thereof.

Read, Use.
believe and obey it, and be out of all doubt of it, without ifs and ands: As
the Papists most wickedly would have the authority of the Scriptures, to depend
upon the testimony of the Church; and because they say its Scripture, therefore
they believe it, and otherwise would not; they would give no more credit to
Paul's Epistles, then to Esops Fables, if the Church did not give testimony
thereof, which is a blasphemous Opinion: The Scripture is above the Church, and
that whereon its grounded, and has no greater testimony then from it self: we
testify that God is the true God from all Idols, and Christ from all false
Christ's; do they therefore depend upon our testimony? and are we above them?
Though the Church discerns the Word or Scriptures from false writings, and
therefore rejects a great many of Epistles and Gospels, of Bartholomew,
Thomas, Thaddeus, as adulterous; yet this proves not that they depend on the
Churches testimony. Simile.
A Kings Letters come to a City, the Officers thereof, by the style, sign, or
some other thing whereunto they are accustomed, accept of them, yield to them,
and testify that they are not false or counterfeit; are they therefore above
the King or his Letters? A proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost.


Further, here is a testimony of the Divinity of the third Person; for the
whole Scripture is given by inspiration from God, 2 Timothy 3. 16.
and here its said, The sufferings of Christ foretold in the old Testament.
it was by the Spirit; and who could foretell things so long before but God?
confer Acts 1. 16. with 4. 25.

When it testified beforehand of the sufferings of Christ] Namely, That he was
to suffer for us, Luke 24. 26.
and so to enter into his glory: This we find in the Old Testament both
plainly expressed, and under types and figures; as of Isaacs offering, the
Brazen Serpent, the Paschal Lamb, Jonas, etc.

This serves to answer all profane Infidels, Use. ^
that scoff at Christians because they believe in a crucified God, for so do
they contemptuously speak of Christ.

A. He suffered what was necessary for the Savior of the world to suffer, Phil.
2. 8, 9.
and what the Scripture foretold he should suffer; and though he suffered and
was abased, yet he overcame it, and entered into glory: Had not these things
been foretold, they might have been offended at his dejected estate, Luke 24.
21.
for so were the Disciples notwithstanding, but being foretold, they are not;
yea if he had not suffered for us, we had been yet in our sins, yet under the
curse, as if he had suffered, and had not conquered and entered into glory, we
had been never the better.

It was needful that Christ should suffer for us, Why it was needful that
Christ should suffer for us.
for we by Adams fall were plunged into sin, and so in danger of the curse of
God, and liable unto all wrath here and hereafter; This Gods justice could not
suffer him to remit, but the death threatened must be paid: To this end our
Savior became man, and suffering all that was due to us, thereby discharged us:
He was arraigned before an earthly Judge, that we might never be brought to our
answer before the heavenly; accused, that we might be cleared; condemned, that
we might be acquitted before God; counted among vile sinners, that we might be
reckoned among the Angels; spitted on, that we which had deserved that God
should for ever have spitted on our face shame and confusion, might be received
into favor; did undergo the curse, that we might be blessed; dyed, that we
might live, etc. then this, there was no other way whereby we could have been
discharged. See Isa. 53. 1 Pet. 1. 19. and 2. 24. 1 John 1. 7. Rev. 1. 5. Hence
perceive,

1. The depth of our misery. Use 1.


2. The unspeakable love of God, Use 2.
and Christ Jesus.

3. Comfort to all that have their part in Christ, Use 3.
all their sins and punishments are discharged, crosses and death are now
become blessings, no punishments of sin; whosoever do not by Faith take hold on
him, must suffer for their own sins, and that for ever.

4. That as we are to hate sin with a deadly hatred, Use 4.
so must we testify our love to him that has redeemed us at so high a price;
Numbers will talk of Christ, that he dyed for their sins, which yet are so far
from being humbled to repentance hereby, and to turn from sin to God, as that
they seem rather emboldened and heartened to run on in sin, 1 Cor. 15. 14, 17.
and sin more freely; such vile wretches crucify Christ again, neither shall
have any benefit by his death.

And the glory that should follow.] It was necessary that he should have
overcome, else had his death been in vain.

Hereof there were three degrees, Three degrees of our Saviors victory.
1. His resurrection. 2. His ascension. 3. That he shall one day come into
judgment, and bring all his servants into his glory; John 14. 3. and 17. 24.
whereunto may be annexed the consequents of each.

But how shall we come to glory? Through afflictions we also must come into
glory.
even by the same way that our Head, our Lord and Master has gone before us,
namely, by sufferings; for through many afflictions we must enter into the
Kingdom of God, Act. 14. 22.
and God will have the Members made conformable to the Head. Romans 8. 17.
It follows hereupon,

1. That afflictions or persecutions are no ill sign, 2 Timothy 2. 12.
but rather of the way to Heaven and glory; 1 Pet. 5. 10.
it should encourage us to suffer, Heb. 12. 3.
seeing glory follows, Use 1.
and a great reward ensues thereupon.

2. That those which will suffer no affliction nor persecution for Christ and
the Gospel, Mat. 5. 12.
but shifting themselves therefrom, Acts 5. 41.
aim at the glory of the World, Use 2.
are not in the way to glory, but shame hereafter will be their portion.

Verse 12. Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us,
they did minister the things which are now reported unto you, by them that have
preached the Gospel unto you, with the holy Ghost sent down from Heaven; which
things the Angels desire to look into.
YE have heard what the Prophets searched into, and by what guide; now see what
was revealed unto them, and how far forth they were satisfied; namely, that the
things which they sought into, even the time of Christ's coming, should not be
in their days, but in ours; They took the pains, we have the gains; They laid
the cloth, and we come to partake and feed on the dainties; The fruit of their
ministry, was to our benefit: So that we have the advantage of all our
Forefathers of the Old Testament.

Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, etc.] Lo, say the
Anabaptists, the Jews foretold many things of Christ, but had no part in him
themselves, The Anabaptists confuted.
those concerning us; They had Canaan, and temporal benefits, and looked no
further; But how absurd this is, we have already showed, having sufficiently
proved the contrary: And these words are not to be understood of Christ, or of
the substance of salvation, but of the time of his coming, and of the manner and
measure of revealing him to them more darkly, to us more clearly; to them more
sparingly, to us more fully: They believed in Christ that was to come, we hear
of Christ already come, and that he has finished all things, and how; and thus
are we to understand, Heb. 11. 13, 33, 39. where there seems an opposition:
They received the promises, that is, the fruit of them, and salvation by
Christ; and they received not the promises, that is, saw not the exhibiting of
Christ, who was promised to the World: For more plainness, there was never but
one Covenant between God and his people, from the beginning till now, nor shall
be, which is the Covenant of Grace, except we mean the Covenant of Works, which
was between God and all mankind in Adam; the foundation and matter whereof was
our own strength and righteousness, but this was soon at an end; Adam had soon
broken this, and overthrown himself, The Covenant of Grace one and the same
throughout all ages.
and with him all us: The Covenant of Grace then the Lord entered in his great
mercy with Adam in Paradise, which was founded in Christ Jesus, requiring of us
to believe in him, and repent of our sins, and he would forgive us our sins,
and give us salvation and life eternal: This for the substance thereof, was
never altered one jot, only the Lord has revealed his Son more fully to us,
more sparingly to them; more plainly to us, more darkly to them: Herein may be
considered, both the Author, Matter, Form and End.

The Author, The Author,
the same God to them and us.

The Matter, Matter,
Christ Jesus the same to them and us.

The Form was generally also the same, Form, and
for as God required Faith and Repentance of them, as well as of us, so he gave
them the same means for the working thereof, the Word and Sacraments.

The End the same ( viz.) End thereof.
the Salvation of his Elect, and Eternal life.

The difference is in the measure of his giving them, The difference about the
measure given, and persons to whom.
as also in the persons to whom; then was it to the Jews only, who were the
peculiar people of God; now the partition wall is broken down, and the Covenant
is to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews: So also for the measure, he spoke to
them by visions and dreams, to us by his word, and when to them by his word, it
was both more sparingly, and more darkly: Also our Sacraments compared with
theirs, are, as fewer, so more easy, and more significant; and for the Spirit,
they had him more sparingly (except some extraordinary persons) whereas it was
promised, Joel 2. 28.
that he should be poured upon us: And for the common people, they are far
inferior to Christians now; they saw Christ to come afar off, we already come,
yea, that he is dead, risen, ascended, and shall come to judgment: They had
him under Types and Shadows, we have the substance, the body it self; theirs
was as the seed time, our time as the harvest; they had the twilight, we have
the noon day: And there was great reason that the time when Christ himself
should come, should bring more glory with it; as the coming of a King himself,
has more solemnity and privileges, then when the Kings Harbenger comes
before; and that when the sun of Righteousness should arise, there should be
more light then before. Why God sent his Son no sooner.


But why did God send his Son no sooner, and not in their time rather?

A. We must not quarrel with God, we may as well ask him, why he made the world
no sooner, why he put distinction between the summer and winter, day and night:
We must know, that all things are done in infinite Wisdom and Justice by the
Lord, though we know not always the reasons of his dealings: Gal. 4. 4.
He came in the fullness of time, he could come no sooner, nor tarry any longer;
we are to thank God that he is come.

The difference between them and us, is only in the measure of Revelation and
means; therefore we call their time the Old Testament, or Covenant, and ours
the New, not two, but one; only the Covenant to them was sealed in the blood
of Bulls and Goats, Luke 22. 20.
ours in Christ's own blood, as he himself witnesses.

The cause why their time was called the time of the Law, Why theirs was called
the time of the Law, and ours of the Gospel.
ours the days of the Gospel, was not but that they had the Gospel also
preached, as Adam in Paradise, so Abraham, so the Jews in all their sacrifices
and cleansings; but because then the Law was so much preached, and the Gospel
so darkly and sparingly, as now the Law more sparingly, the Gospel more
frequently.

Neither is God to be charged with inconstancy, God not to be charged with
inconstancy.
because he taught his Church otherwise then, then now he does, no more then a
Father, for training his children up otherwise when they be children, Simil.
then when they are men grown; he does both in wisdom. The Lord trained on his
children in their infancy, by those babish rudiments, fit for the time,
reserving greater things for the grown age of his Church; yea, such is his
constancy, that he has never altered the way of Salvation, but has ever been
the same from the beginning, and shall be.

Seeing then that the Lord has honored us to live in these days, Use.
and revealed his will so plentifully, O how joyfully should we embrace Christ
Jesus, and labor to be found answerable in Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Zeal
and Holiness! Our Forefathers saw but a little, and took great pains for it,
and were glad of it; How glad then should we be of that we have? Luke 2. 25.
Simeon waited for the consolation of Israel, and was so glad that he had seen,
and taken Christ in in his arms (though then in his swaddling clothes) that he
was willing to dye; O how joyful would he have been if he had seen his
Miracles, heard his Preaching, known his Resurrection, Ascension and Glory,
Psa. 119. 127.
as we do. David was so glad of the Word, that he accounted it better then gold
and silver, and sweeter then the honey, and the honeycomb; Job 23. 12.
and Job esteemed it above his appointed food: Alas, What a little had David
(especially Job) in respect of that we have? we have the whole Old Testament,
which some of them had not, and the New also, an Exposition and Commentary
thereof, which they had not at all; How cheerfully then may we come to Christ,
and believe in him? How should we walk, that know he is gone up to heaven to
prepare a place for us, and will come again to receive us? But alas, if the
Lord come to look for these fruits, where be they? Alas, to whom is the Gospel
welcome? How many be there that would as willingly there were no Preaching as
any? and are there not many that hear only for the fashion, that will hear but
when they list? The Lord publishes his Gospel, and offers his Son to the
world; but alas, men have more mind to their Oxen, Farms, Pleasures, then to
embrace it; many savor not of the Gospel, many count it rather a burden then a
jewel: yea, of those that hear the word usually, How few are there that hear it
with delight? how few find such need of Christ, as they desire him more then
all the world? as they will willingly stoop to his yoke, and serve him? And as
many have no more knowledge, then if they had never had the means thereof; so
even they that have some measure of knowledge, make no conscience of their
ways, are utterly void of Reformation: Thus do not they take thankfully this
great jewel of the Gospel, the only glory of the World, but most unkindely
requite the Lord; yet what is their saying? They hope to be saved by Christ, as
they that believe steadfastly in him; but how they came by their Faith, or any
good fruits thereof, they can show none: For this God must needs have an heavy
controversy with the Land; and were it not for a remnant that he has to
gather, we should quickly perceive it: O therefore let our conversation be such
as becomes the Gospel, See Heb. 6. 7.
bring we forth meet fruit, to the pains God has bestowed on us: But as for
those that live and make no account of, nor receive any profit by this Gospel,
their condition will be heavy, God will take his Word from them, or snatch them
from it; and not only Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and old times shall rise up
against such, but even the good Souls that saw but a little light fifty or
sixty years ago, and had but a little knowledge (for the means were small) yet
were zealous and godly, and sundry gave their lives for the Truth; even these,
I say, shall rise up and condemn them: Then would they be glad of one of the
days they have had, but shall not have any. Awaken therefore to day, while it
is called to day, for we may fear it draws to night-ward, toward the
Sunsetting of the Gospel.

The things which are now reported unto you, by them that have preached the
Gospel unto you, The same Gospel which was preached by the Prophets, was also
preached by the Apostles.
etc.] The second part of the commendation, The same Gospel preached by the
Prophets, was also preached by the Apostles since Christ, men that were trained
up with Christ all the time of his preaching, and were witnesses of his Life,
Death, Resurrection and Ascension: These have preached this Gospel, and that
not of their own minds, but by the Spirit of God, which was sent down from
heaven upon them, and that in an extraordinary and visible manner. The Prophets
preached of the same Christ, and that by the Spirit (as we have heard) so that
they and the Apostles agree notably in one; but the Apostles received a greater
measure of the holy Ghost, and a more plain and visible sign, not only
perceived of themselves, but of others.

In that he adds, Which the holy Ghost sent down from heaven, he alludes to
that of Acts 2. 17. taken out of Joel 2. 28. And it shall come to pass in the
last days ( says God) I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh etc.

If then the Gospel was also preached by the Apostles, Use.
and that by the Spirit sent from heaven upon them, Hereby may all that hear it
be induced to embrace it; as on the contrary, their case must needs be fearful
which reject and despise it: Heb. 2. 1, 2, 3.
Such is the case of the Jews, though they killed the Prophets, yea, though
they rejected Christ and his preaching, yet were they not cast off, till they
had rejected and resisted the preaching of the Apostles, who with one consent
bare witness of him; confirming also their Doctrine by Miracles from heaven:
Acts 13. 4^^*
having done this, their sin was at the highest, and from them the Apostles
turned unto the Gentiles. Such is the condition of the Turks, utter enemies of
Christ and true Christians. Such is also theirs, who among our selves despise
this Gospel: (...) but none do so: Yes, many in sundry degrees; for all that
receive not the Gospel, embrace not the Gospel, do not believe, obey and
repent, all these despise it; for to believe and repent, are the Commandments
of the Gospel: therefore he that yields not unto them, despises the Gospel. He
that is not with me (says our Savior) is against me; All these have a dreadful
account to make: For, though now it be preached by sinful men, yet it is the
Gospel that was preached by Christ himself, See 1 Pet. 4. 17.
and after by the Apostles inspired by the Spirit, and it has been abundantly
confirmed by Miracle: Heb. 2. 1, 2.
This is that (I say) which we preach; 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8.
let every one therefore take heed, lest they set light by it, as though it
were not the Gospel of Christ, but of men.

Again, The Apostles have left a perfect direction for all things needful for
our Salvation.
in that the Apostles were so filled with the Spirit to preach and write, we
learn, That they have left unto us a perfect Direction for all things needful
for our salvation, and for the good estate of Gods Church, and that therefore
there is nothing to be added, detracted or altered.

1. This condemns them that trust in new Gospels of Thomas, Use 1.
Thaddeus, Bartholomew, etc. and in Traditions and unwritten Verities; which is
to accuse the holy Ghost of want of care for his Church, as not having left
that which is sufficient for salvation.

2. It condemns them also that take away and alter at their pleasure; Use 2.
what is this, but to tax the holy Ghost for leaving something not necessary,
nor profitable for his Church, and by altering or taking away the same, to make
our selves wiser then he?

Which things the Angels desire to look into.] The third commendation of the
Gospel, The Angels defire to see into the further end of that salvation that is
preached therein. They are not ignorant of any thing the Church knows; but
they have gathered some things they knew not of, or not so much till they came
to pass; as, touching the Incarnation of the Son of God, both Natures in one
person, etc. This they desired to see before he came; Exodus 37. 8.
and this was figured by the Cherubims looking down toward the Mercy-seat,
which covered the Ark, which was a figure of Christ, signifying that they
desired to look into that Mystery of his Incarnation; and when they saw it,
they admired thereat, even to see the Eternal Son of God joined to man's Nature,
it to be worshipped without Idolatry, and his Manhood to suffer, the Deity
remaining free without suffering: So also by the Church they learned the
Mystery of the calling of the Gentiles. Ephesians. 3. 10.
But now that which they desire to see, is that which is yet to come, namely,
the fullness, perfection, and accomplishment of the salvation of Gods Church and
People; Why the Angels desire to see the perfection of the salvation of Gods
Church.
namely, to see the day of Judgment, when God shall be perfectly glorified in
his Saints.

They desire this; 1. Because they are enforced to see now a great deal of sin
in the world, yea those duties which the Saints themselves perform, See Romans 8*
19.
full of corruptions and weakness, which after that day they shall see no more:
2. Because that day shall be our perfection; Alas, here we are imperfect every
way, and weak, then shall we be perfect and free from sin, and in a most happy
estate both in body and soul, which for the love they bear to God and us, they
long to see: for as God revealed himself more darkly to the old world, more
clearly to us; so when we shall come to heaven, much more clearly then now:
There shall be as much and more difference between that which we shall know
then, See 1 Ioh. 3. 2.
and that which we know now, as between us and the darkest times before us
under the Law; 1 Cor. 13. 9. 10, 11, 12.
Here (as children) we are weak, and rather stammer, then speak plainly of God,
his Word and Works; but when in the life to come we shall come to man's state,
it will be far otherwise: Here we see with spectacles of the Word and
Sacraments, but there without, and that most perfectly.

1. Is there such an happy condition remaining for all Believers? Use 1.
O how should we rejoice, that are entered into the first degree of it, and
expect the other! How should we bless God for his Gospel, and for the pains
which we have taken herein to attain the same! Yea, how should we walk
thankfully, that look for such a state? how zealously and heavenly-minded, not
defiling our selves with this world, nor sticking here, but mounting up in our
affections, and having our conversation there?

2. How should we long for the day of our dissolution, Use 2.
to enter another degree; but especially for that last day, when we shall be
made perfect? The Angels have what they shall have, yet in love to God and us,
they long to behold our perfection; what should we then do, that shall have the
benefit of it?

3. This should teach them that be yet void of grace, Use 3.
to embrace the Gospel, that they may come to this happy estate, else they
shall go to one as miserable as this is happy; from which the Lord deliver us.

Verse 13. Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope to the
end, for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jesus
Christ.
HEre follows the 2d part of the Epistle, containing matter of Exhortation,
built on the foregoing Doctrine. Being begot again to the hope of such an
inheritance, and to such salvation, whereinto the very Angels desire to look;
they were thereupon to trust steadfastly, (without wavering) to the end,
honoring this hope and Gospel by an holy life and conversation, not only
renouncing the lusts of the time before their calling, Doctrine and Exhortation
must be joined together.
but also living in Sanctification of life, wherein they might resemble God
their Father, who being holy, requires that his children should so be; even
holy, as he is holy: whence may be noted, Mat. 6. and 7.
That for the building up of Gods Church, Doctrine and Exhortation must be
joined together. Romans 12.
Thus our Savior preached, 1 Timothy 4. 1^.
thus also the Apostles; Heb. 2. 1. and 4. 1. and 12. 1.
as the one must inform the judgment, so the other pull on the affections
(which are as much or more corrupted then the understanding part) whereby
Knowledge, Conscience and Practice may go together.

Knowledge without Zeal is blockishness, as Zeal without knowledge rashness;
but better less Knowledge and more Zeal, then more Knowledge and less Zeal or
care of obedience. Doctrine without Exhortation, is to set a dull Horse in the
way, and not spur him on: Exhortation without Doctrine, is to spur a Horse
forwards, before he be put into the way; the one is the Foundation, the other
the Building, both which must go together.

Ministers that would go to work indeed, Use.
must go with their tools, use both Doctrine and Exhortation; as he that would
cleave a knotty Log, must both use Beetle and Wedges, the one without the other
would be to no purpose: We must be like careful Messengers, not delivering
barely our Masters message, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 1.
but earnestly entreating on his behalf: We must not bear the air as it were,
multiplying words, yea good words, without a ground: Neither must we deliver
sound Doctrine strongly proved, so leaving it, but urge and apply it, Practice
being the life of all, and people being unapt to make particular Application;
yea, it is the principal part of our Ministry, to draw on the will, and to
persuade and work upon the affections, for want of which many find but small
fruit in their Ministry; for people are grown to that pass, that it is not the
excellency and weight of the matter that will move (which for the most part
proves but a sound with the most) if it be not whetted by some enforcement of
Exhortation.

People also must not only be willing, Use.
but glad of this kind of teaching, Heb. 13. 22.
suffering (as the Apostle speaks) the word of Exhortation; but too too many
had rather have general Doctrine, then be called upon to Practice and
examination.

In this Verse our Apostle Exhorts to stedfastness in Faith, and to rely and
trust on the Salvation, to the hope whereof they had been called by the
revelation of Jesus Christ, even the Gospel of Christ, and therefore to remove
from them all such impediments as might hinder the same: Those were of two
sorts; 1. Such as were in the understanding part, implied in the first part of
the Verse: And 2. Such as were in their affections, implied in the latter.

Gird up the loins of your mind,] A borrowed speech from those that wore long
garments, which when they went any journey, or were to stir about any thing,
Exodus 12. 11.
they were wont to gird up, lest they might be troubled or hindered thereby. The
meaning is this, As men do thus gird and truss up their clothes, lest they
should be hindered in their work or journey, Luke 12. 35.
so shake off all that may hinder you in going your Spiritual journey to
Heaven, Ier. 1. 17.
and doing the work of the Lord. By the loins of the mind, we are to
understand all lets in the understanding part, namely, all corrupt opinions
about Salvation, contrary to the Word; Those must be reformed, else can we not
trust perfectly, or hope to the end. The corrupt conceits of the Jews about
Salvation.
The Jews wanted not theirs, nor we ours: for the Jews, 1. They looked for
earthly promotion by Christ, as a Potentate of the world; This could not but
much hinder them from trusting in him for Salvation; This they must gather up,
if they would profit by him, knowing that he is made of God unto them not ease,
riches, etc. but Wisdom, 1 Cor. 1. 30.
Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemption. 2. They did still stick much to
Moses his Law and Circumcision: This also hindered them from resting wholly and
only upon Christ for Salvation; This also they must tuck up, acknowledging
Salvation to be by him alone. 3. They prized not Salvation at so high a rate as
they should, and this also was no small let unto Salvation.

For our selves, The corrupt conceits of Christians about it.
How many corrupt conceits be in peoples heads that hinder them from Faith? As
some think that they be no great offenders, and hope to be saved by good
prayers, good meaning, civil life, etc. Others, that its no such hard matter to
be saved, but if that men call to God for mercy, they shall do as well at the
last, as they that make all the stir: These conceits be as it were the strong
Castle of carnal People, whereinto being once got, all that we can say, proves
unable to beat them out; Others hope to be saved by Christ, who yet live in
their sins; Others think that if they should Repent, and go to Sermons, they
should never be merry again: Now these, and such like, must be reformed,
finding these lets, we must gird up our loins, and remove them: Nay, even Gods
good servants that are truly humbled in conscience for sin, and ^it to believe,
hungring after Christ more then all the world, as desirous to turn to him, yet
are held off by some false conceits, O they be unworthy that God should forgive
them! Therefore he will not, their sins be too many and too great; and, O if
they could sorrow as deeply as some, and serve God as well, then they would
hope, etc. and, O they have so many corruptions, and such a rebellious heart,
as they know God will not forgive any such; whereas it is not that will hinder,
so as our hearts be unfeignedly bent to strive against our corruptions, and
serve the Lord in truth.

Neither do the very best prize so highly this Salvation as they ought, The
best prize it not as they should.
we weigh not what God has done for us in Christ: This is the reason why we
walk not more thankfully, joyfully, and zealously; let us gird up these loins,
rid our selves of these impediments, up, and be sound of these points, and
whatsoever thought would hinder us from resting on Christ Jesus for Salvation,
Mark 10. 49, 50.
let us cast it from us, as the blind man did his cloak, when he went to
Christ.

Be sober] Sobriety is a virtue that keeps us not only from things unlawful,
What sobriety is.
but moderates us in the use of things lawful, that we exceed not our bounds
therein: Luke 21. 34.
These may be referred to two heads, Profits, and Pleasures, 1 John 2. 15.
which we are most subject to abuse, and are therefore dehorted from them.

For the former, which is Pleasure, thereto may be referred meat, drink, 1 Cor.
10. 31.
apparel, recreation, etc. All which we must use soberly to the glory of the
giver, our own good, and the good also of others.

1. For our meat and drink, Sobriety about meat and drink
we must neither be excessive, nor over curious, as Dives that fared
deliciously every day, making his belly his God; we must eat to live, and
thereby be more fit for duty.

2. For our apparel, About apparel.
we must not exceed for the matter of it, nor for the fashion, God has given
it for necessity, comeliness and decency; 1 Timothy 2. 9.
it must not be newfangled, 1 Pet. 3.
either we use it to wantonness or pride.

3. For Recreation, About recreation.
it must be sparing in time, place, measure, to make us more fit for our duty;
for God has not set us here to satisfy and pamper the flesh, but to mortify
the lusts thereof; not to play, but to do his work; to this end is Recreation
to be used.

1. This rebukes those that wallow in beastly and unlawful lusts, Use 1.
in whoredom, chambering, wantonness, drunkenness, etc. so in games altogether
unlawful, yet many make a practice of these, to whom Solomon's speech would well
suit, Eccle. 2. 2.
I said of laughter, thou art madness: For a man to sport at Gods dishonor, and
their own destruction, is madness: Can we play with nothing but edge tools? the
Lord will laugh such to scorn; Iam. 4. 9.
O turn your beastly pleasures into weeping and wailing.

2. This rebukes also such as are drunk with lawful things, Use 2.
as some that so glut themselves, and so pamper the body, that they make
themselves unfit for any duty; many waste and consume themselves this way,
Bodies and Goods, yea, Souls and all: Others also are so curious in their
meats, as that nothing can please them, nothing's good enough for them; yea,
are more angry for any want this way, then for any sin in themselves or others;
they have fat Bodies, but lean Souls: O, think they, this is a goodly life, but
indeed it is a swinish life, fitter for beasts then men, most unseemly for a
Christian: So for Apparel, they that follow every new fangled Fashion, and are
so proud and costly, and so over curious, as they spend no small time in
trimming themselves, taking no care to trim their Souls with Christ's
Righteousness and Spiritual Graces, How are they to be reprehended? What
painted Sepulchers are these? may not an image have gay clothes put on? yet how
many spend their precious time and goodly patrimonies about this vanity? So for
Recreations, some are so mad on them, as they think and speak of nothing else,
as if they were set here to eat and drink, and rise up to play; thus spend they
the greatest part of their time.

3. Let us therefore pare away whatsoever super fluity has been in us in these
things, Use 3.
and learn soberly to use these mercies, as the Gospel teaches us, so as
thereby we may ever be made fitter for our duties, and to serve God, and that
they may be as a staff in our hand, to help us on in our journey, and this is
to walk pilgrim like; be we more careful in feeding, clothing and making merry
the Soul.

For the latter, About profits.
namely profits, we must also be sober, both in getting and keeping them.

We must not only use no unlawful means to get the world, but use the lawful
means moderately, not setting our affections upon the world, See Mat. 6. 24.
or being too earnest to compass it, 1 Timothy 6. 6.
filling our selves with too many businesses, Heb. 13. 5.
and following the same too eagerly, lest we neglect good duties, Iam 44.
or be hindered from doing them as we should. 1 John 2. 15*


1. This condemns those that use flat unlawful means to get the world, Use 1.
swearing, lying, deceiving, oppression, usury, false weights, and the like:
Hab. 2. 6, 9, 12.
These pull a w^ upon themselves, Ier. 17. 11.
besides that they heap up but chaff, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 6.
which the wind of Gods wrath will scatter; God is an avenger of all such
things: O what reckonings do these multiply against themselves! What answer
shall they make that sell their souls to hell for pelf?

2. This condemns not those only that get thus, Use 2.
but those that follow the world so eagerly, as they mind nothing else; of
which sort most are, all day long nothing but of the world, no Prayer, no
hearing of the Word; they think and talk of nothing else but the world, Lords
days and all; they think Prayer would be an hindrance, they savor nothing but
of the earth; they make more account of their old Shoes, then they do of a
Sermon, they prize not such things; when they are called to the Wedding Feast,
they have Farms and Oxen to hinder them, or if they come, all runs over, for
they be full already, or as the Pharisees, Luke 16. 14.
mock at that they hear, or if they hear with joy, the thorns (worldly cares)
quickly choke it; O this world undoeth most men! its an enemy, but not of it
self, but by reason of our sottishness and drunkenness, See 1 Timothy 6. 9. and
note the place.
that cannot moderate our selves, but take too much of it, and wound our selves
many ways; What will it profit them in the end to have embraced this strumpet?
she will serve us as Delilah did Sampson, deprive us of our strength, and give
us into our enemies hands, and as Jael the Wife of Heber did by Sisera; thus
will she serve her favorites.

3. Learn we to be wise indeed, Use 3.
laying up a treasure in heaven, and laboring for meat that endures to
everlasting life, Mat. 16. 26.
For what will it profit a man to win the whole world, if he shall lose his own
soul? O that Gods good servants should be so encumbered with the world? O that
that these base things should beguile and ensnare those that are born from
above, to the hope of so great glory! Many good Christians are half drunk, they
are unfit for good duties, cannot mind heaven, from Monday morning till
Saturday night, and it is well if they be sober on the Lords day; many be not,
but let both their hearts and tongues be employed on the world, who yet count
themselves Christians.

O what excellent Christians would some be, were it not for the world! but how
does it mar many, keep them from good duties, weigh down their minds? Heb. 12.
1.
its that wherewith they are too easily beset.

O let us wind up our plummets (as the clock-keeper) once every day, Simil.
keep our minds from being weighed down with the world; we must set apart some
time to draw up our mind, especially Saturday night, not letting them down all
the day following: We must so use the world, as not to run into evil for it,
neither to neglect any duty to God, our Souls, our Families, our Neighbors, the
Poor, or any other, we must use it to further us, as the Pilgrim does his
staff: Learn we to prize Spiritual graces, which are the only current coin in
the Country we are going to; yet is not the seeking of Gods Kingdom the way to
hinder us of that which is meet, but rather the only furtherer: Mat. 6. 33.
would we have more then will do us good? But if we shall have less of the
world, are we not more then enough recompensed, if we shall have more peace of
Conscience, more credit here, more favor with God, more joy in death?

Hope to the end, for the grace, etc.] This is the main Exhortation to
constancy in the Faith, Mr. Esty on the place.
to the which the other two former Exhortations served as furtherances; others
read the words thus, Trust perfectly on that Grace, etc. Where we have three
things, 1. What they are exhorted to, namely, To trust: 2. How, Perfectly: and
3. On what, Grace; That is, Salvation; which is described by the means how they
came by it, It was brought them, and that by the Gospel which reveals Jesus
Christ.

1. They are exhorted to trust and believe in Christ for Salvation; Faith is a
particular assurance, that whatsoever Christ has done, he has done it for me:
What Faith is, with the parts thereof.
This is to put on Christ, to eat and drink his flesh and blood; It has three
parts: 1. Knowledge of the mystery of Salvation. 2. Consent. 3. Particular
Application: John 3. 16.
This is the instrument of our Salvation, and puts a difference between
justifying and temporary Faith, what else soever a man has, there is no
Salvation promised to it; Romans 15. 3.
This the mother of all true joy and peace, The mother of all obedience, Heb.
11. 17.
and good life: See it in Abraham's offering up his Son; Hereby we are induced
to do or suffer any thing for Christ: This we must labor to come to, when we
feel our misery, and desire to come out of it, and hunger after Christ: we
ought to believe that we shall be saved, John 6. 40.
This is the will of God (says our Savior) that ye believe in him, etc. God is
willing and de^irous we should believe; Mar. 1. 15.
The commandment of the Gospel is so, and its commandments are as necessary to
be obeyed as those of the Law, He that believes, 1 John 5. 10.
has put to his seal that God is true: Its therefore our fault, that being
come to the birth as it were, we stand still and do not believe, when God has
made us fit to believe; either raze your selves out of the number of weary
laden sinners, etc. or else believe you shall be refreshed, and are pardoned
in Christ.

2. They are willed perfectly to trust; How they were to trust.
namely, 1. Sincerely without faining. 2. Steadfastly without wavering. 3.
Constantly without breaking off. Sincerely, nor fainedly, but so believe as we
have ground out of Gods Word for it: many say, they hope to be saved, and this
is all; but put them to prove why, and whereon their persuasion is grounded,
they can say nothing: Can you prove it out of Gods Word? What promise have you
thence? if you have, then its well, See Downham, Christ. War.
else its Presumption, not Faith. Try it by the fruits of Humiliation, and by
the fruits of Sanctification, by thy love to the Word and Saints. Steadfastly,
without wavering, we must not be off and on, we hope well, but we cannot tell;
Gods promise is not yea and nay, Heb. 10. 22.
but most certain and infallible, so that we may be out of all doubt: Romans 4.
21.
To this purpose its called assurance of Faith, and (as Abraham) we are willed
to ask in Faith, Iam. 1. 6.
and not to waver: Its true, no man's faith is so perfect, but there may be
sometimes some doubtings, but they are not of the nature of Faith, but being
from our corrupt nature, are contrary thereunto.

1. This condemns the Papists, Use 1.
that tell us we may be of a good hope, but are great enemies to assurance; we
may be assured, say they, in respect of God, but in respect of our selves we
cannot; he being faithful, changes not, but we are weak and variable, may be
well now, but by and by fall; a tormenting Doctrine: If we look to our selves,
we need not doubt, but despair rather; and God has not promised Salvation to
us upon condition of our constancy, as to Adam, John 13. 1.
but of his unchangeable love, Phil. 1. 6.
he will never leave us, but finish the good work he has begun in us; yea, say
the Papists, if we hold out: What a foolish repetition is this? God will do
great things for us, if we continue; what were this to us, if we were left to
our selves? Ier. 32. 40.
nay, he will give us a mind to continue, and so do all these things for us.

2. This reproves even good honest humble Souls, Use 2.
that long after Christ, and hate sin with a deadly hatred, and have many
excellent things in them, and yet stand at a stay; they would not for all the
world, but hope that God will have mercy, but cannot be assured: Why, Is not
God faithful? has he not said, that such and such shall be saved? shall he say
it, and not do it? God forbid.

O am I so unworthy. Object.


Therefore he will have mercy on thee; Sol.
if thou did not feel and bewail that, he would not care for thee.

O my sins be so great. Object.


Is his mercy only able to take away small ones, Sol.
or the blood of Christ only for lesser offenses? take heed.

O but its not for me. Object.


He names thee not; Sol.
but faith he not, All weary and heavy laden ones shall be eased? all that
take up his yoke, shall find rest to their Souls? excludes he any? exclude not
thy self.

O but I have such a corrupt heart, Object.
and offend him every day.

But how do thou like thy sins? Sol.
I hare them, they are as gall to my mouth, I desire to be rid of them, etc.
Why, then be of good comfort, no better sign of a child of God, then that thou
strivest to mortify them, and to please God: There is none free from
corruption, yet if thou fightest this Spiritual combat, thou may believe and
be thankful; therefore this do, strive against thy corruptions all thou can,
and labor to reform more and more, and then shall not thou need to doubt of thy
Salvation. Lay the foundation of thy Salvation once sure, and never raze it
more; if there be any fault in the roof, be mending it, but let the foundation
he still: Imitate thy Father Abraham, Heb. 11. 17.
God promised him a Child, What did he? he neither looked on his own old age,
nor the deadness of Sarahs Womb, but looked on the promise of God: So do we
look, not on this or that, our own unworthiness, or what Satan says, but on
Gods promise; If the Devil do but put into your head, you shall not be saved,
it shall prevail more then all we can say out of Gods Word; fie upon it: Is not
he a liar, and a murderer from the beginning? Does he not tell them that have
no Faith, that they have, as them that have it, that they have none; Cleave to
one testimony of Gods mouth, and let all the temptations to the contrary be
gone: Renounce Thousands of them, and stick to the promise.

O but I feel it not. Obj.


No, Sol.
how can thou, when thou wiltst not believe; believe first, and thou shall
feel after, but though thou should not feel of a good while, yet believe the
promise of God, constantly without breaking off; believe to morrow as to day,
next year as this, we have good leave, God is the same, so shall we with
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, dye in the Faith.

Therefore use all good means to continue it and increase it, Use 3.
hear diligently, receive the Sacrament carefully, pray continually, always
keep a good Conscience* John 15. 10.
Wood is not more necessary and apt to nourish fire, then good works and well
doing to nourish Faith: Also observe the dealings of God, and grow by your own
experience: Many that have believed, and were very earnest in their beginning
till they got it; after, growing secure and worldly, and withal neglecting the
means, have (with David) fallen into some one sin or other, thereby losing the
peace and comfort they formerly enjoyed: A great loss indeed, more then if a
man were stripped of all to his shirt. O lets take heed of this loss, as we are
to be wise as Serpents, so let us show our Serpentine wisdom in this one thing
especially. The Serpent will be sure (so much as in her lies) to save her head;
Simile.
so must we our Faith, for on this hangs all: and if by any means we have
fallen therefrom, recover we our selves by all means possible.

3. That which they are to hope for or trust on, Salvation a most special grace.
is Grace, that is, Salvation: Every benefit is grace, but to be delivered out
of our lost and undone state, and brought again into the favor of God, and
saved, Ephesians. 1. 5.
is a most special grace. Our Election is of grace, Ioh. 3. 16.
so our Redemption, James 1. 18.
so our effectual Calling.

1. This condemns the Papists, Use 1.
that teach partly Grace, partly Works: No, these cannot be mingled, either all
or none; they be as contrary as light and darkness, Romans 11. 6.
honey and gall, else were grace no more grace. Gal. 1. 7.
To join any thing with Christ, is to pervert the Gospel: They now begin to be
ashamed, and mince this Opinion, saying, We be saved most by Grace, yet partly
by Works; and, that these Works be died in the Blood of Christ; and, that it is
most safe to rest on his merits alone: Well, God make them so ashamed, as
altogether to renounce it, and so let us in the mean time.

2. Let us serve the Lord with a cheerful and constant love and service, Use 2.
for his free favor to us all the days of our life.

3. Show we grace and favor to others, Use 3.
not to such as have deserved well of us, but even to such as have not, nay
ill, as we had of God.

Grace] That is, Salvation. See, he calls their minds from looking for earthly
preferment by Christ, whereunto they had a lingering mind, and calls them to
look for Spiritual riches, even Salvation by him. What we are to expect by
Christ.
What are we then to expect by Christ, and by professing the Gospel zealously?
not Wealth, Honor, Peace, Credit in the world, but pardon of our sins, freedom
from Hell and Gods wrath, peace of Conscience, joy in the holy Ghost, that our
persons and works shall please God, Angels to be our guard, our Prayers to be
heard, our Souls at death to be carried into heaven, both our Bodies and Souls
to be glorified at the great day; Will this satisfy us? Hereof we may be
assured, if we believe in Christ, and zealously embrace the Gospel. John 18. 36.
As for other things, his Kingdom is not of this world, he promises not
plenty, peace, ease, etc. He had them not himself, but (contrarily) troubles, 2 Timothy 3. 12.
as all shall have that live godly in him.

This teaches us to lay our hand upon our heart, Use.
when we go about to profess, we know what we shall find, but it may be sorrow
withal; if we can be content so, then may we go forward, else not. Many having
gone on in profession not so advisedly, and after having found the wind and
tide against profession, and reproach, trouble and danger for the same, have
shrunk away, and with Demas, have forsaken Paul, and embraced the present
world: Others seeing how hardly such be dealt with, though in their conscience
they think best of such, yet keep in their heads, thinking that its best
sleeping in a whole skin: But alas, they make but a weak choice; were they not
better have these heavenly comforts and privileges here, and be acknowledged
of Christ, and saved at the great day, though with some sorrows here, then to
make the world their friend, and God their enemy, and to have him ashamed of
them at that day, as he will? for we cannot have it go on our side now and then
too.

That is to be brought unto you] God tarried not till they sought Salvation,
but he of his goodness brought it them, which he uses here as an Argument to
persuade them to trust steadfastly to this Salvation, and look accordingly for
it, because God would bring them to the Faith of it, when they thought not
thereof.

Note here, That

Salvation is not of our own procuring or seeking: Salvation is not of our own
procuring or seeking.
Alas, what could Adam and we in him do? we could fall, but what then toward
our Salvation? we could run and hide our selves, and excuse our sin, and
increase our danger, Ezekiel. 16. 6.
but God was fain to bring him the seed of the woman, Ephesians. 2. 5.
he could not make himself an help, a wife (for God made and brought her to
him) much less a Savior. So, what is the reason he has given us the Gospel in
this Land, and not to our Forefathers, not to many other Lands? we sought it
not, but when Idolaters in darkness, God brought it. So have we not been
brought by marriage or by Service into Towns where we have had the Word, when
we purposed no such thing? So to our hearts, what were any of us when God
called us? Did we seek him? Alas no, we ran from him rather, long ere we
yielded, but he followed us, and overcame us: See it in Saul, Acts 2. and 16.
did he seek Salvation? he was going to Damascus to persecute, Luke 19.
God brought it him; so to Zacheus, the Jailer, etc. so we. Rev. 3. 20.


This teaches us,

1. To be humble. Use 1.


2. To be exceeding thankful all the days of our life. Use 2.


3. To rest confidently on him for the time to come, Use 3.
in the experience of that we have had; as thus, That he that brought us
Salvation, the Word to us, or us to it, and gave us to see our misery, long
after Christ, Romans 5. 8, 9, 10.
have some taste of his love, and some desire to please him that were far from
these, he will continue this, and will never leave us: Thus the Apostle
reasons; But God commends his love toward us, Genesis 32. 10, 11.
etc. So Jacob in danger of Esau, He came over Jordan with his staff, and God
had given him two bands, therefore he was persuaded to rely on God for present
deliverance; for why (might he say) I am persuaded thou have not done all this
for me, to be lost in an instant, as an ox should lick up a flower, or a candle
be put out at once. We use not Gods mercies well, when we grow not stronger by
them for time to come.

4. Comfort to a fearful heart, Use 4.
that fears he shall not hold out, or that God will cast him away: O its
impossible, did he bring thee Salvation that regarded it not? and now has
given thee an heart to prize it above the world, and to walk in the way to it,
will he now disappoint thee? No assuredly: If he would not have saved thee, he
would have let thee alone as thy companions and many others, and never have
done this for thee.

O but the Devil is so strong and subtle, Object.
and I so weak and simple.

He that has plucked thee out of his hands, Sol.
will never suffer him to get thee captive again; It were else a disgrace to
Christ: Except therefore he be stronger then God and Christ, thou need not
fear.

At the revelation of Jesus Christ.] He plucks these Jews from Moses Law, and
the Ceremonies which were out of date, (but they could hardly be so persuaded)
and brings them to the Gospel which discovers Christ: He was in that Law
covered with Vails of Sacrifices and Ceremonies, etc. All these be done away in
the Gospel, where Christ is laid open without any covering. Note,

We have the excellency of the Gospel, The Gospel lays open Christ Jesus unto
us.
that does uncover and lay open Christ Jesus unto us, brings us tidings of him,
who is the Way, the Truth and the Life, and the only Savior of the world; So
that the Gospel is the glory of the World: The Sun is not so necessary in the
Firmament, as the Gospel is to the world: This teaches us Christ, which is
life eternal, and St. Paul desired to know nothing, but Christ and him
crucified, Phil. 3. 8.
and counted all dung for the excellent knowledge of Christ Jesus his Lord: O
how welcome should this be! It is well called glad tidings, so it is indeed:
The Gospel is our pardon. If we should find evidences of great Lands and
Inheritances to come to us, or a Will wherein were bequeathed great Legacies to
us, how glad would we be of the same? How often would we revise and read them
over? The Gospel brings us tidings, and tells us the way to come to an
everlasting inheritance, and therein are bequeathed such blessed Legacies,
Item, I give thee forgiveness of thy sins by my Sons death; Item, Eternal life
by his obedience. Item; I give thee assurance that thou shall be raised here
from sin, and that thy body shall be raised at the last day by my Sons
Resurrection; Item, I give thee assurance of a place in Heaven by my Sons
Ascension.

1. Is it not a marvel then that the Gospel is so hardly entertained? Use 1.
and that the World cares so little for it? Its welcome to most people, not as
if it brought them news of a blessing, but as if it would spoil them of all
they have.

2. How should they that want it be set on work to labor to get it? Use 2.
as without which there is no Salvation; Its light, food, armor, without which
darkness, famine, spoil: If the Sun should be wanting to a Town, and could be
procured, how would all join to get it? Or rain for a dry and barren ground;
who would not wonder at any that should be against it? yet who joins, who
labors for the Gospel.

3. If the Gospel be the revelation of Jesus Christ, Use 3.
then are the Ministers revealers of this blessed Secret, therefore worthy to
be acknowledged for their works sake, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 12, 13.
for the greatness of their work, and the excellency thereof: Pharaoh
reverenced and advanced Joseph for smaller matters; Romans 10. 15.
O how beautiful are the feet of such: Most people either rate them, or at
least set light by them, not reverencing their calling, but esteeming them more
base then the meanest Tradesman; But that grieves us not so much, as that
unkindeness that we meet with from them, from whom we look for most comfort and
encouragement.

Verse 14. As obedient children, not fashioning your selves according to the
former lusts in your ignorance.
TO Faith he adds Repentance and Sanctification, by the one to testify the
other, 2 Pet. 1. 5.
(as in the second Epistle, he wills them to add unto their Faith, virtue) as
if he should say, You that sometimes were the Children of wrath, and are now by
grace made Gods Children, walk obediently as becomes such a mercy.

This Sanctification has two parts: The two parts of Sanctification.
and stands, 1. In renouncing evil, or the lusts, which (before grace) we were
wont to be led by. 2. In putting on, and embracing holiness of life, that we
may resemble the disposition of our Father who is holy, and looks for holiness
in his; yea, holiness in all manner of conversation.

For the order, Obedience and Sanctification follow Faith.
first goes Faith, then Obedience and Sanctification; for as the light and
Sunbeams comes from the Sun, a river from the Spring head, Simile.
fruit from the tree, so does obedience from Faith: Till a man be pardoned and
believe, Heb. 11. 8.
he cannot repent nor obey the will of God, no more then a dead stick can bring
forth fruit. When by Faith we are ingrafted into Christ, then we receive power,
not before; one that has never been humbled aright for sin, cannot hate and
fly from sin as he should: He that sees not the love of God to him, cannot
love God, nor set upon a good life; to deny his lusts, being as dear as his
life, and to yield obedience, is irksom to nature: for this cause the Devil is
such an enemy to our Faith, and labors to shake it, for then he knows he damps
our care of a good life.

1. This condemns Papists, Use 1.
that boast of holiness of life, and yet overthrow the foundation of it, (
viz.) A true justifying faith: They may stir up good moods, and a blind
devotion, by scaring men with the pains of hell, and telling them of the joys
of heaven, but no sound Obedience, godly Life, renouncing Lusts, etc. without
the work of Faith, from that will be Obedience, even to suffering.

2. It confutes them that think Repentance is before Faith; Use 2.
they are indeed wrought at once, and Repentance shows it self first, but in
order of nature, Faith is as the root: Many humble souls hold off, and dare not
believe, O say they, if I could repent so heartily as I see some, and could
serve God as I would, then I could believe.

3. It teaches men, Use 3.
that if ever they will set upon a good life indeed, and in time, they must
begin at the right end, and lay a foundation of true justifying faith; for want
of this, many deceive themselves that have some purpose to do well, being
afflicted, or somewhat stirred at the Word, and fall out of a bad course, to
leave this and that evil, or take up good duties; and many that never had
experience of the work of Faith, that think they live well, or some that upon
some occasion thus promise, You shall never hear me swear more, I Will never play
more, Never come in an Alehouse; yet this lasts not, but they fall to their old
byase by and by, because they took not the right course: Many also purpose to
repent, and do great matters, but this is a greater matter then the world
thinks off; a man must first be the child of God, ere he can obey, and Faith
must be wrought first, ere he can come to true repentance; therefore put it not
off, its not the work of a day, or sickness the fittest time to be allotted
thereto, but constantly to be set upon, till we shall attain thereunto.

As obedient children] Or children of obedience, that is, given to obedience,
and studying thereto with all their might of body and soul, as if you could
imagine obedience to be a creature, and a mother that had children, resembling
her self, Ephesians 5. 6.
so must we be; the contrary hereof is elsewhere expressed, Col. 3. 6.
Children of disobedience, that is, given over unto all disobedience, and in
other places the like phrases, and to the same purpose are used, see 1 Kings
21. 5. Psalm. 50. 18, 19. Mat. 7. 23.

Hereunto the Apostle exhorts, for that they were called to be children, God
calls for obedience.
which strongly enforces this duty of obedience.

Obedience is that which God still calls for, which he does again and again
require at our hands; Ier. 7. 23.
its better then sacrifice, as contrarily, Iam. 1. 22.
rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. 1 Samuel 15. 22.
The Israelites (doubtless) spoke well, Deuteronomy. 5. 29.
But O that there were such an heart in them (says God) that they would fear
me, and keep my commandments always: Neither hearing the Word, See Isa. 38. 3.
nor knowing or speaking of it, pleases God, without obeying; John. 14. 15, 21.
nothing else can comfort our Souls and Consciences in death; nothing else can
approve us to be the servants of the Lord, Mat. 7. 24, 25.
or that we love him, John 10. 27.
or that we shall continue to the end, His sheep hear his voice, and follow him.

For the manner of our obedience:

1. We must obey, We must obey in all things.
not to halves, or where we lift, but in all things, not as Saul or Herod,
Psalm. 119. 6.
Nadab and Abihu; there were the same persons, incense, Luke 1. 6.
censers, altar that should be, only the fire was not the same, who therefore
were punished by fire from heaven. Lev. 10. 2.


2. We must not on the other side run without our errand, Which are commanded.
nor do things whereof we have no commandment; this is no obedience, be it
never so costly or painful, have it never so goodly a show: And here falls to
the ground all Will Worship of the Papist, to whom it will be said, Who
required these things at your hands? as also all good intents without warrant
of the actions: How was God displeased with them that offered their sons and
daughters to the fire, Ier. 7. 31.
having no such commandment from him.

Moreover, Be the commandment never so strange or unpleasing.
we must obey the Commandment of the Lord, be it never so strange, harsh,
unpleasing, or contrary to Nature, denying our selves contrary to custom,
though all the world counsel to the contrary: and that not indenting or
covenanting with the Lord beforehand for wages or success; as to say, I would
do such a thing, so I thought no hurt would come of it, or that I should thrive
in that course, or that I should not meet with trouble: no, we must follow the
Lord, as the blind man follows the staff of his leader, and chooses not his
own way. Thus did Abraham in forsaking his own Country at Gods Commandment in
his old age; it was his Native Country, that wherein he had lived so long, he
was to go he knew not whether: He had questionless contrary counsels of his
Neighbors, What a mad man are you to remove now, and seek a new dwelling in
your old age; you are here known, here are your Kindred, you know the Country,
and have thriven: Its as if one should remove a tree that has grown long in
place, into another place when its old: Well, for all those he persisted in his
obedience to Gods Commandment.

The Jesuits train up their Scholars in strange obedience, The strict
obedience of the Jesuits to their Superiors
as that they must do whatsoever their Superiors bid them, and that speedily
without questioning; as to water a rotten tree, to pour a vessel of good wine
into a gutter, to set trees with the roots upward, etc. when his Superior calls
him to go in an instant, and not to stay to make up the circle of an O; when he
is writing and made the one part of it, he must not stay to make up the other
part: They to justify this, and provoke to obedience, tell a miracle, That one
thus called of his Superior, and leaving his O in the midst half made, at his
return found it made up a perfect O, and so gilded, that it shined, etc. Such
obedience owe we to God, and these rules be very good, so as the Commanders and
Commandments were good. We must obey God directly, and never cast about
beforehand what shall be the end, we must leave it to him, and to obey him must
needs fall out well. Abraham did not amiss, but sped well in obeying God: So
Noah and the rest. Abraham never shifted for himself, but twice about his wife,
and he was like then to have spoiled himself, if God had not helped him out of
the briars; So Jonah: Our own Devices never succeed, though never so likely.
But we have such reaches beforehand, that mar our obedience: Oh, if I were
ruled by the Preacher, I should not thrive by plain dealing, nor wax rich; or
if I should leave such a course, or such a course, I should be poor; If I
should do thus and thus, I should come to trouble: but let us do our duty, and
let the Lord alone for his part to look to us; in obeying him we cannot do
amiss. The wicked will leave their sin a little while it may be, through
Sickness, or Fear, or Counsel, as the Dog that is beat from the Carrion, Simile.
or called away, yet has a Dogs eye back again after it, Mat. 21. 30.
and will be at it again, as soon as one's back is turned; yea, and if happily
they give good words, yet will not their doings be answerable.

3. We must obey without reasoning the case, Without consu1lting with flesh and
blood.
or consulting with flesh and blood; we must bind Reason hand and foot to
follow God (as it were) blindefold, as Abraham in offering Isaac, and Joshua in
compassing Jericho, 2 King. 5. 11.
and not as Naaman the Syrian: Our Reason proves a very great enemy to
obedience.

4. We must obey, Whosoever, or whatsoever be against it.
whosoever or whatsoever be against it: If Profits, Pleasure, Farm, Oxen, etc.
calls us away, and God invite us, we must follow him, else have we no part in
him: If Father, Mother, Friend, See Deu. 13. 6.
nay the Wife of our bosom entice us from him, we must not give ear to them;
nay, if our right hand, eye, or foot offend us, we must cut them off and obey
God. He that hates not father and mother, wife and children, Mat. 5. 29.
yea his own life for my names sake (says our Savior) is not worthy of me;
Luke 14. 26.
yea, if any should command and threaten us contrary to our obedience unto God,
Dan. 3. 17, 18.
we must not yield to them, but rather obey God then them. Acts 4. 19.


5. Speedily, Speedily.
not hereafter, but to day, while it is called to day, etc. not repent
hereafter, when I have taken my pleasure a while longer, hear Sermons when I am
thus rich, have Prayer in my Family when such businesses and lets be over; nay,
thou may be dead, or meet with more ere they be gone.

6. Voluntarily, Voluntarily.
not be haled only by pain and misery, as Pharaoh; God loves a cheerful
servant.

7. Constantly, Constantly.
not for a while, as Joash, but as Caleb and Joshua followed the Lord to the
end, yea when most revolted: See the contrary punished in the Prophet that came
from Bethel. 1 King. 13. 24.
We must not be weary in well doing. Gal. 6. 9.


Reasons hereof may be these: Reasons.




2. His Will a rule of Righteousness.

3. His great mercies every way, even to the worst, but to his children

1. This condemns them that are so far from obeying, Use 1.
and that in all things, and after this manner, See Exodus 5. 2.
that they will obey in nothing, but as if they were set to cross the Lord, Job
21. 14, 15.
what he forbids, they love, what he enjoins, Ier. 6. 16. and 44. 16.
they cannot away withal: They live like masterless men, as if they ought
nothing to any, were beholding to none; What, art thou not a piece of Clay, the
Lord thy Maker? even he that threw Angels out of Heaven, Adam out of Paradise,
opened the Earth, rained down fire and brimstone on Sodom, etc. If his
Sovereignty move thee not, consider, I beseech thee, his Goodness; Who has
nourished thee up? given thee a comely body, a reasonable Soul, and so long
kept thee, that thou art not now in Hell? What Is all this for, that thou
should fly in his face that gives thee bread? He lets thee hear his Word,
calls thee to Repentance, etc. Is it that thou should tread these things
under thy feet? Oh, thou art of thy father the Devil, whose works thou do;
and except thou fall down at the Lords footstool, Psalm. 50. 22.
and humble thy self before him, he will confound thee* O consider this, all ye
that now forget God.

2. It condemns such also as obey God to halves, Use 2.
and in what they list, in the mean time lying still in some beloved lust; So
Pharaoh obeyed, Exodus 10. 26.
so Herod and Saul: But as Moses would not part with one hoof, so will not God
have us cast off any one Commandment; God will have no parting Stakes: 1 King.
3. 26.
The Devil, like the Harlot, would be contented with the one half, but God,
like the true Mother, will have all or none. If God were so revenged of
half-obedience under the Law, what then now? This halving is an Argument of no
true Faith, for that purifieth the heart; Acts 15. 9.
also of no Repentance, for he that repents truly of one sin, repents truly of
all: Whosoever therefore thou art that do thus, thou art in the gall of
bitterness, and bond of iniquity, thou art in the state of damnation. If thou
live in the practice and love of one known sin, profitable or pleasing, this
one shall be enough to sink thee down to destruction, Simile.
as one leak in a Ship may endanger the whole, and one gate in a City open let
in the Enemy.

3. This rebukes the servants of God that yet walk not in that obedience that
were meet, Use 3.
but leave undone this and that duty, slighting over others, and letting loose
their affections and lusts; O this is not the cheerful and constant obedience
that we ought to perform in all things. If neither his Authority, nor his
outward Benefits will move us, consider we his love toward us in Jesus Christ,
that of children of wrath he has made us his children, that by giving his Son,
he has freed us from Damnation, and means to save us: Oh, the Name of Children
calls for much obedience, Genesis 13. 8.
as the Name of Brethren should still all Controversy. And this is the
Argument which the Apostle here uses to persuade to obedience: Oh, we be Gods
Children, Children ought to obey their Parents, there is nothing more uncomely
then the contrary, much more we the Father of our Spirits: Christ the natural
Son was obedient to the death, How obedient then must we be, being but adopted
ones?

Again, What may stir us up unto obedience.
That he has called us to the hope of such an Inheritance, what obedience does
this challenge? For this is the force of the coherence of Verse 13. with those
that go before. Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, etc. That is, Seeing
God has done such and such things for us, let us trust perfectly on that grace
that is brought unto us, and walk obediently: Yea, the more we profit in
obedience, the more comfort we may have, that we be the Lords, and have true
Faith; the more will our comfort be also in our death: So many of us therefore,
as can prove our selves the Lords, do we labor to walk worthy hereof in all due
obedience; and for others that know not they are the Lords, let them try it by
obedience.

Many Covetous, Use 1.
Usurers, Oppressors, Swearers, etc. will say, they believe: no, be tried by
this rule, If your heart stand to obey all Gods commandments, it is so; but
while you live in any thing you know is sin, you are void of Faith.

Other poor humble Christians that hate sin deadly, Use 2.
and unfeignedly desire to please God in all things, yet say, they cannot
believe; Why? who has wrought these things in you? Not flesh and blood, they
are the gifts of Gods sanctifying Spirit, therefore they come from Faith; as if
we see a Sunbeam, we say, the Sun is risen; if an Apple that is good, Simile.
we say, there is a good Tree: Except therefore you will say that men can
gather Figs of Thistles, or Grapes of Thorns, you cannot deny but that you have
Faith; wheresoever Sanctification is, there Faith went before; O but I find it
but weak, yet as long as it is in truth, with desire of increase, it
presupposes Faith: as if we see a Sunbeam, though but dimly, yet we say, the
Sun is up, after it will shine out more clearly: So we say, its a good Tree,
though the fruit be small at first, so long as it is good.

If any shall say, Obj.
I feel in me no such thing now, therefore I have no Faith, what shall become
of me?

Was it ever so with thee? Sol.
Look to the time past, and thou must not deny the mercy of God showed thee:
Thou can not deny, but it has been so, then thou have had Faith, then have
thou Faith still, though it seem raked up in the ashes: Simile.
when thou with the bellows of Prayer and the Word, and God with his Spirit
shall blow away these ashes, it will uncover it self, and burn out again.

Not fashioning your selves, Two parts of obedience.
etc.] There are two parts of Obedience, or Repentance, a dying unto sin, and a
living unto righteousness; a renouncing of lusts, Isa. 1. 16.
and embracing holiness; a ceasing to do evil, and a learning to do well; Romans
12. 9.
an abhorring of that which is evil, Col. 3. 10.
and cleaving to that which is good; a putting off of the old man, and putting
on of the new; he that has the one, has also the other, they are married by
the Lord, and none can divorce them: Therefore if any man seem to have the one,
and not the other, he has neither in truth: If therefore any leave evil, and
do not good, or if any do some good, and hate not all evil, he is but an
hypocrite.

For the order here used, We must forsake evil before we can do good Simile.
he sets renouncing of our lusts first, before embracing of holiness; men put
off their old rags, ere they can put on new apparel; purge the stomach of ill
humors, ere they take good nourishment; dig up the weeds, ere they sow or set
herbs: so in this case.

Where therefore there remains the love of any lust or sin, there is no true
grace in that heart, neither will any grow till that be rooted out, God will
not plant any of his grace there, till the Devils planting be plucked up. Many
think they be Christians, and do many things well, though they keep the love of
some sin; no, mark, the love of grace and goodness, and the love of any sin,
cannot be in one heart, they are so contrary the one to the other; therefore
while thou live in any known sin, and love any lust, as sure as God is in
heaven thou art an hypocrite, and let me perish if there be one dram of true
grace in thee, but thou stand in the state of damnation.

Therefore renounce and bid adieu to thy lusts; Use.
and seeing you make a profession, and do many things, will you lose heaven for
your lust, for one sin? 1 Cor. 9. 24.
so run that you may obtain, lose not heaven for a little, make either
something or nothing of thy profession, banish from thee all sin, that God may
work some true grace in thy heart.

In your ignorance] He fathers their following of lusts on their ignorance;
Ignorance is the cause and root of a bad life.
and ignorance is the cause and root of a wicked and bad life: For till men
know the will of God out of his Word, how can they do it? and what are we prone
to by nature, but to all the evil in the world? Therefore the devil labors by
all means to hold people in blindness, and of all books, has most been an
enemy to the Bible, and to sincere and diligent reading and preaching the
Scriptures, for were those away, he knows all iniquity must needs abound, as
there did in Popery, when people were nuzled up in blindeness; O what abundance
of sin was committed? but it did not so much appear, because they were in the
dark, and the light of Gods word discovers sin, which was then very rare:
Simile.
As if one come into an house at midnight, he ^ees no faults, but when the
morning comes, then he sees a number of things out of order; so in this clear
light of the Gospel, we see the wickedness that then appeared not in the dark.
Whether will not our nature run? and whether may not the devil and world lead
one, when he has no eyes to see whether he goes? The blind eats many a fly,
and a man may lead a blind man into the deepest pit. Simile.
As the Raven first picks out the Lambs eyes, and then kills it at his
pleasure, when it cannot see to escape away, so does the devil by people:
Ignorance is often compared to darkness, and they that go in the dark often
stumble, fall, and hurt themselves: Sampson when blind, was led to any thing,
as to grind, to make Sports, etc.

1. This teaches us to desire that the clear light of the Word may shine more
and more brightly into all places of this land, Use 1.
for there are many places that have either no preaching, or else very seldom;
So as for want of knowledge, people wallow in a number of lusts most fearfully,
the Lords day most grievously Profaned, preachers slighted, etc.

2. Every Minister is to endeavor to the utmost of his power, Use 2.
to bring their people to the knowledge of their duty, that so they may be
either truly converted, or at least hereby restrained.

3. People are to labor for knowledge, Use 3.
else they must needs be captives of many lusts: Think not as many do, because
ye are poor and not book-learned, therefore you shall be held excused; many
think their very ignorance shall be a good plea, because they know nothing, God
will hold them excused: John 3. 19.
Is light come into the world, and shall men's sin (their ignorance) hold them
excused? its otherwise.

4. All parents are to have a special care, Use 4.
where and in what Towns and houses they place their children; they must place
them where they may learn to know God, to discern between good and evil, and if
it prevail not with them by and by, yet there is hope it shall lie as seed in
their hearts, that will shoot up in time.

But how can he say, Why being so well instructed in the Law, they are here
termed ignorant.
In their ignorance, seeing they were well instructed and expert in the Law,
having it read among them daily? and had they not good knowledge in the Law,
and in the Prophets? True, yet he justly calls them ignorant; 1. Because though
they were so cunning in the Law and Prophets, yet they knew not Jesus Christ,
the end of the Law, and so the sum of all. 2. Their knowledge was only in
their brain, and not effectual in their hearts to renew and reform them, Romans 2
17, etc.
but they were carried away by their lusts, notwithstanding of their knowledge.

1. Then all the knowledge in the world without the knowledge of Christ Jesus,
All knowledge without the knowledge of Christ is nothing.
is nothing: If a man could measure the heavens, tell the number of the stars,
had skill in all Arts and Sciences whatsoever, yet without the knowledge of
Christ it were vanity. Paul knew much being brought up at the feet of Gamaliel,
Phil. 3. 8.
But he counted all things else loss and dung for the excellent knowledge of
Christ Jesus; 1 Cor. 2. 2.
He desired to know nothing but Christ Jesus, and him crucified. If a man were
the wisest in a County to arbitrate and compound controversies, yet all this
were nothing without the knowledge of Christ.

2. All the knowledge of the world, Knowledge without reformation is but
ignorance.
if it reform not a man, is but ignorance; So much a man knows as he obeys:
That is not knowledge that is in the brain, but that which soaketh down into
the heart, and transformeth a man into the similitude thereof; so much men
know, as they mortify their lusts: He that lives after his lusts, let him have
never such store of knowledge, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know: what
if a man know he should not Swear, Lie, commit Adultery, etc. yet doing these
is he any whit the better? Is he not rather much worse? Yea, the Devil himself
has more knowledge then any man: The world wonders many times to see men of
great knowledge do such and such things: Alas, Knowledge and Conscience are two
several things, and often sundred in the subject.

1. Then, let no man boast of his Knowledge: Many love to hear themselves talk,
but look what power they have over their lusts, what mastery over their
affections.

2. Do not we labor so much for knowledge, Use 2.
as for the power of it; Therefore when we have heard a Sermon, let us not
content our selves that we can repeat it, have a good memory and utterance, but
by our selves pray earnestly, and travel upon our hearts, that it may
effectually work in us: A little well learned of an humble Soul, craving to be
ruled by it, is better then much that a vain bragger can repeat, that will be
ruled in nothing but when he list.

But he would not have them live now they had Knowledge, Such as have attained
knowledge, must not live as they did before.
as they did in Ignorance, and now God having wrought in them the hope of
eternal life, he would have them walk far otherwise then they did ere they had
this; being called out of the world, they were not to live after the corrupt
manners thereof. Romans 12. 2.
Men and women would be loath to be seen abroad in such attire as they go in on
nights; Romans 13. 11, 12.
were it not a gross thing for any to do their work as badly by day light as in
the dark night? Ephesians. 4. 17. and 5. 8.


People therefore that live under the Word, Use.
must not do as they did before they heard it: Why may we not do this or that,
will some say? we do but as we have done, and as other Towns do? well, is it
not enough if upon your true humiliation God pardon the time of your ignorance,
John 9. 41.
though he now expect obedience? and so must you now obey, else your sin will
be great, and ye must be beaten with the more stripes: will God look that your
work should be done no better then theirs that have no light, Luke 12. 47, 48
when he allows you candle? our conversation must be such as becomes the
Gospel. Phil. 1. 27.


So for Christians that have received assurance of Gods love, and entered
covenant with God, they must not yield to their lusts as others, to whom God
has not showed such mercy, or as themselves did before they knew God in Christ
Jesus: they must not be as worldly now as before they knew God to be their
Father, and that there was a better inheritance for them; as proud now of
apparel, following every fangle, as before they knew the true apparel of
Christ's righteousness, and to be decked with grace to be the best attire; as
froward as before they had the Spirit to refuse these corruptions; they must
not backbite, slander, talk of other men's faults, rejoice in their infirmities,
as they did in the time of their ignorance; they must not talk of worldly
matters on the Lords day, as they were wont ere they knew the holiness thereof,
and what a strict rest and observation God requires; nor follow gaming, as
before when they knew no better mirth; Gal. 5. 25.
nor be so vain in talk, as before they knew it to be a fault, and as carnal
persons be: Then what singular thing do we? We must be now as much altered in
our behavior, as our case, we hope, is altered from top to toe; as from being
heirs of wrath, to be heirs of heaven: Kings sons and daughters must not live
as every ordinary base person, nor Gods Chrildren as Worldlings. Let us
therefore so many as have given our names to Christ indeed, and know our selves
delivered out of this evil world, and are assured that God is our Father, and
we his children, walk as it becomes children of such a Father, and such an
hope of so glorious an inheritance, not avoiding gross and outward ungodliness
only, but resisting our own lusts; for Christians must make an account they
have themselves, their own very hearts to strive against: Our adversary is in
our bosom and bowels, no marvel then if our strife be somewhat hard, for our
crown after our victory is wonderful great.

Verse 15. But as he which has called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner
of conversation. Verse 16. Because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy.
Here Is the other part of Sanctification, Holiness must be added to abstinence
from evil.
namely, Tit. 2. 12.
The affirmative, which shows what we must do; this must necessarily be added
to the former: so that its not enough that we fashion not our selves to our
former lusts, but we must also be holy. Our Savior Christ cursed not the
fig tree because it bare bad fruit, to poison them that came by, but because it
bare none; as that also for which the dresser of the vineyard pleaded: Luke 13.
7.
Every tree that brings not forth good fruit, is hewn down; The bad servant
bound hand and foot, Mat. 3. 10.
not for rioting out his talent, Mat. 25. 30.
but for not well employing it; so on the day of judgment shall it be said,
Verse 41.
Go ye cursed, etc. not for casting me into prison, but not visiting me
therein, etc.

This is the more to be urged, This duty needful to be urged.
because a great many as long as they be not hurtful, think themselves in a
very good case as can be, though in the mean while they do no good: They do
hurt to none; alas, this is but half, God forbidding an evil, commands a
contrary good: what if one do not that which is forbidden, and yet leave the
duty commanded? what obedience is this?

Let a number that think they have repented, Use.
and a number of civil persons try themselves by this: You have left, or do
keep no ill company, but do you care for and delight in good company? alas, a
number have no savor nor mind to such: You do not profane the Lords Day, but
do you carefully sanctify it publicly and privately? You have banished Cards
and Dice out of your house, or never had any, but have you entertained Reading
and Prayer in their stead? banished the Devil, and entertained God in his room?
you are peaceable, and not boistrous and spritish in your Family, but do you
any good? So, its not sufficient that we drive none from God and his Word, and
well doing, by mocking or any other discouragement, but provoke one another to
goodness, Psalm. 51. 13.
the Husband the Wife, Parents their Children, Masters their Servants; and so
on the contrary, Wives their Husbands, etc.

Its not sufficient to say, I hinder them not; this shows only, thou art not
so bad as some, but proves not that thou art indeed good: So many in a Town
think it enough if they do no hurt in it, but they will sleep in a whole skin:
But they must not only haunt no Alehouses, or be disordered, but seek to
suppress such as be; else if they gather not with Christ, Luke 11. 23.
they scatter; if not with him, then against him: Judge. 5. 23.
for this Meroz; was cursed. How a number of rich men in Towns can shift this
curse, Neh. 13. 17.
I know not: O what evil is this that ye do? Too many are content to let
goodness go by; they are no enemies to good Ministers or people, etc. but they
will do nothing to procure the Gospel to a Town, or to hold it where it is, but
if we have any truth in us, we will, though we meet with hard measure for our
labor; Christ has done more for us: So much have we profited in the hatred of
evil, as we have gotten in the love and practice of the contrary good, and no
otherwise.

If this would serve for men, to leave evil, many would be Christians, but this
is but half; he that stands here will come but half way, almost only with
Agrippa to heaven, Acts 16. 28.
not altogether: Repentance has two feet, he that stands not on both is a lame
Christian. If there were a Preferment for a man at London, and he should go
half way, and there stay, would he not lose it? might he not also be justly
accounted a fool, a negligent and lazy person? Such are we, if through lack of
one part of Repentance we deprive our selves of heaven.

But as he which has called you is holy, etc.] Speak we first of the
Exhortation unto holiness, ver. 15. then of the Reason enforcing the same, ver.
16.

Touching the Exhortation, its to Holiness, whose extent is in all manner of
Conversation, which is set out by a Simile, viz. As God is holy; who is
described by a main benefit bestowed on them, Their Calling: But as he that
has called you is holy, so be ye holy, etc.

The Exhortation then is to Holiness; we were made holy at the first, we are
now filthy and unclean; we must have the image of sin put off, Christians must
be holy.
and a new image of God put on; we must be sanctified persons, set aside for
the Lords use, as the Shewbread, that none might meddle with, or put to any
other use. We must be for the use of neither Flesh, World, Devil, but for Gods
use only; we must have no more Body, Soul, Wit, Will, Reason, Hand, Eye,
Finger or Foot, but for the Lords use. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 3.
This is the will of God, even our Sanctification: Angels our fellow servants
be holy, Heaven the place we look for is holy, no unclean person comes there;
Ioh. 15. 3. and 17. 17.
God has also given us his holy Word, and holy Sacraments to increase us in
holiness; so holy Sabbaths, and his holy Spirit.

This the end of our Election, Ephesians. 1. 4.


This the end of our Redemption, Luke 1. 74, 75.


This the end of our Calling. 1 Cor. 6. 20.
Yea, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 7.


As without holiness no man shall see God: Iam. 1. 18.
So, Heb. 12. 14.


The inheritance is prepared for them that are sanctified. Mat. 5. 8.


1. This condemns such as are so far from holiness, Acts 20. 32.
as they give themselves over to all manner of lewdness and profaneness, Use 1.
and mock at those that desire any better, Oh, you be of those holy ones, of
the holy brotherhood: and what are you? of the profane ones, as Esau? Take
heed, you will speed as Esau did. If you be not holy, you shall never see God,
but (as Belshazar saw the handwriting) to your terror: Is it not too much you
be profane your selves, but would you that others also should be so too? Does
not God enjoin holiness? speaks he not to all? Therefore except you will
publish to the world that you are marching in the Devils Rabble, and have
renounced your part in heaven, and vowed your own destruction, break off your
fins by Repentance, and cease to be for the Devils use any longer: Confess and
cry for pardon of that is past, enter a new Covenant, renounce thy old Master,
with whom is ugly works, base scullery, woeful wages. Romans 6. 22.


2. This also condemns all civil persons that rest herein; Use 2.
you must exceed this, else you cannot enter into the Kingdom of heaven. Its
great pity, that many men of very fair carriage are no better for themselves,
and they trust to their honest and just dealing with their Neighbors; but alas,
it will deceive them for want of holiness. Alas, that you will see nothing into
the first Table: How little do most regard the true Worship of God, and the
Spiritual use of it? How seldom do they pray, or have any divine Meditation?
How little regard they the Sabbath? How often swear? and such persons be the
best Papists we know.

In all manner of conversation. Holy in all manner of conversation.
] Not where, when, to whom, and what we list, but at all times, in all places,
toward all persons, and in all things, Psalm. 145. 17.
as God is holy in all his ways and works.

1. This serves to rebuke those that will yield in some things only: Use 1.
what is it if a man be not covetous, if he be proud or unclean, etc. some will
yield in great matters, but in small do as they list; as to swear by their
Faith and Troth, especially in that which is true, talk vainly, play a game or
two on the Lords day, put a little false Ware, deceive a little, etc. Some
again will yield in all small matters, but in some great thing they will not; 2
Pet. 1. 5.
as to give all diligence to increase in every grace, Col. 3. 17.
and that no corrupt communication should come out of their mouths: Ephesians. 4. 29.
though thou have spoke many good words, yet had thou better be silent, then
have no more good to speak. There are some devout in the Church, but Spirits in
their houses at home; In their own Town well ordered, but in strange places as
the company is, riotous, wanton, 1 King. 20. 23.
deep in gaming, etc. as though God were God of the Mountains, and not of the
Valleys, of one place, and not of another. Some must be vain at the Table, and
Christ-tide, howsoever at other times. Some in adversity will be very humble,
good words, golden promises, but in prosperity nothing so. Some in prosperity
carry themselves well, in adversity not stick to run to a Witch: At the
Communion, or a day or two after, Simil.
will be demure, but not so long. Some use their Superiors well, their poor
Tenants or Workfolks hardly: Alas, there is no part of our life, wherein God
gives any license to do evil; in our particular Callings let us show the truth
of our Christianity. Some servants will make a show of Religion, and be
desirous to hear, but are lazy and unthrifty in their Callings: Some men carry
themselves very forwardly, that in their shops and dealings show it not.
Papists seem very devout in some things, yet you shall lightly ever know any
that make Conscience of an Oath, or of the Lords day

2. Let us prove the truth of holiness in us, Use 2.
by the generality of it; keep a constant tenor, an even hand, and let there
be a proportion between every part of our life, not one part as it were devout,
another profane and wicked; Dan. 2. 32.
like Nebuchadnezzars Image, one part gold, another silver, another brass, etc.
These cannot hang together, but let it be in all things, and this will afford
true comfort on our Deathbeds, 2 Pet. 1. 11.
and give us a large entrance into the glorious Kingdom of our Lord Jesus
Christ: True it is, we cannot come to any perfection here on earth, but shall
be subject to offend; yet this were to be wished, that all our actions and
behavior, and all our speeches and thoughts were such as become holiness; and
its that we should endeavor unto, the beginning whereof is simplicity, and
truth of heart, desiring without dissembling, or feigning to walk so as we may
please God in all things.

Wonderful is the weakness of most part of Christians, who howsoever in many
things they do well, yet many of their actions and speeches are not answerable:
Well, let us notwithstanding endeavor it, and that every day more and more; and
lets not be discouraged, though we cannot attain to all we would, but if we can
gain ground this way, though it be but a little at once, yet our labor shall
not be in vain: we must every day exceed our selves a little, and so not
bearing with our selves in our corruptions, but unfeignedly striving against
them, we may receive no small comfort; let us therefore not bear with our
selves in the least evil, Romans 7. 19, 24.
but strive to reform our selves in every thing; in the mean time (with the
Apostle) mourning because of the corruption.

But as he that has called you is holy,] That is, God: This is the Simile,
whereby the Exhortation to holiness is set forth, which has in it also the
force of a double reason to persuade thereunto: 1. From the person calling. 2.
From the calling it self.

The person calling, God is holy.
God: he is holy, therefore must we be so. Concerning Gods holiness, we need
say little; Its his very essence, and uncreated in him, he has been so for
ever, and is so infinitely: Isa. 6. 3.
The Angels cannot cease praising the same, Holy, holy, holy, Rev. 4. 8.
etc.

He is the Fountain of holiness, and conveyeth the streams thereof into his
Creatures, Lev. 20. 8.
Men and Angels: He is holy by nature, whatsoever holiness is in Angels or Men,
is not by nature, but by grace: He sanctifies the place where he manifests
himself, as the ground whereon Moses stood by the bush where God appeared;
Exodus 3. 5.
much more Heaven, where he most clearly shows himself to the Saints.

This should teach us, Use.
as to acknowledge him so in his Word, and in all his Works, and that we should
not dare admit a thought to the contrary, though we cannot see the reason of
all things, so the use hereof is, That we should study after holiness, that so
there may be some agreement between him and us, as we are bidden be merciful,
and perfect, Mat. 5. 48.
as he is, and our Savior faith, Learn of me; not that he requires an equality,
Mat. 11. 29.
which can never be here and hereafter: Here we cannot be perfectly holy as he
is, in Heaven we shall be perfectly holy, but not infinitely as he is, because
we are finite; but so that we labor to imitate him, that we may have his
blessed Image renewed in us daily, Psalm. 84. 7.
and grow more and more like unto him, going from strength to strength, till we
appear before the God of gods in Sion: Can the most holy God abide unholy
persons? Lev. 12. 3.
He has pure eyes, Hab. 1. 13.
and hates sin, Psalm. 94. 20.
abhors iniquity, what agreement between light and darkness? God and Belial?
Therefore the Lord so often called upon the Israelites, to keep themselves from
all kinds of Pollution, and instructed them unto holiness in innumerable
things, whereof some were very small: Therefore as we take Gods holy Name upon
us, hear his holy Word, partake his holy Sacrament, and take his holy Name in
our mouths, let us also study after holiness, else never look to see Gods
face: He can no more endure profane persons, then we to take a Toad in our
mouths. This holiness stands not in coming to Church, mumbling over a few
Prayers without understanding, coming to the Communion at Easter, etc. The
Pharisees fasted often, prayed long, gave Alms, had broad Phylacteries, yet were
rejected by our Savior Christ; It stands in the purity of the heart, and the
whole conversation. But how little does this example of the Lord prevail to
bring men to holiness? most follow after their own hearts lusts, and the
corrupt example of men, we do as we see others do, and why, (say we) should we
be wiser then our Forefathers, then all our neighbors? and thus being willing
to follow such examples, we draw one another to all evil: But follow we not
those in evil, but the blessed example of God himself, as in holiness, so in
sanctifying his day. Thus of the person calling.

The calling it self. A twofold calling.
A great benefit indeed: why, Is it so great a benefit to be called? Yea, as is
here meant.

There is a twofold calling; 1. Outward: When God calls men by every days new
benefits, by every new correction, by his Word, whereby yet they are never aw
hit the better, Romans 8. 30.
nor converted, for many are called, Ephesians. 4. 1.
but few chosen, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 24.
and this is common to Reprobates. 2. Inward and Effectual: when besides and
with the outward means, God speaks inwardly by his Spirit to the Conscience:
The parts of the inward calling.
The parts hereof are,



Lydia's was) when one believes every thing particularly to belong to them,
Acts 16. 14.
and so the promise of Salvation among the rest, till then her heart (as all
ours) was Col. 1. 13.
not able to believe.

3. The change of the whole man: Ephesians. 2. 1, 2.
This is essentially necessary to Salvation, Romans 6. 17.
for by nature we are slaves of sin; 1 Cor. 6. 11.
as long as we continue as we were born, The fruits of this inward calling.
we are far from Salvation.

The fruits hereof are,

1. When a man goes about the works of the same, and labors to walk worthy of
it in an holy life.

2. When a man highly esteems his calling, and the hope of Paul accounted all
dung in respect of the excellency of Christ crucified; and the things he
esteemed highly before his calling, afterward he made no reckoning of.

3. When he will suffer any thing for the same, rather then be

Some are called sooner, some later, as in the Parable of the Laborers hired
into the Vineyard.

Examine we our calling, Use.
for much hangs upon this, Our Election past, Romans 8. 30.
and Glorification to come. Calling is the fruit and proper effect of Election;
2 Pet. 1. 10.
if the one, Marks of effectual calling.
then certainly the other: Notes hereof are both Negative and Affirmative.
Negative,

1. Not to hear the Word, Negative.
and that diligently; so does the Devil, he will not miss a Sermon, nay marks
every point in a Sermon, to

2. Nor to hear joyfully.

3. Nor to reform many things, as Herod.

4. Nor to do some choice duties, as Ananias and Sapphira. Affirmative;
Affirmative.
But

1. To seek above all to be at peace with God, and to have his Spirit

2. That we hate unfeignedly all evil, but especially the special

3. To affect heartily all good, but especially those good things

If by these notes we find we be called, then have we cause to rejoice, and to
praise the Free Grace of God, who for no desert, but his mere mercy, has
vouchsafed to call us that were vile, as Abraham an Idolater, Paul a
Persecuter, Zacheus a covetous person, the Jailer a desperate Ruffian; and has
now put a difference, and that for no goodness in us, rather then in others:
And has he done so to all our companions? No, they abide in ignorance,
unbelief, impenitency: And now our work must be this, even to study after
holiness more and more, being called out of the world, that we should no longer
fashion our selves according to the same, having no fellowship with the
unfruitful works of darkness, Ephesians. 5. 11.
but reproving them rather: As you would be loath to be put back with the
world, and have as they shall, so be not as they, no not in the least things;
and as our hope is in Heaven, so have we our conversation there, as being
called of God to that high Privilege: If you be not effectually called, and
have had so long and so great means of calling, its a fearful sign that you
hearken not, 1 Samuel 2. 25.
because the Lord will slay you. The earth that after much cost, Heb. 6. 8.
yet yields nothing but briars and thorns, is reproved, reprobate ground, near
the curse, whose end will be to be burned. 2 Cor. 4. 3.
If the Gospel be hid, Acts 13. 48.
its hid to them that perish. So many as were ordained to eternal life,
believed; therefore if thou have hitherto stopped thine ear against the Lords
calling, take heed thou provoke him not further, but to day, whilst it is
called to day, give ear and obey: Its more then thou could have looked for,
that he should have all this patience, abuse it no longer, lest it turn into
fury, and the Lord in his wrathful indignation flying away from thee, pronounce
that he will never more speak to thee, and either snatch thee from the Word,
and send thee to Hell, or the Word from thee; or if thou hear, Isa. 6. 9, 10.
that he yet bid the Minister preach to harden thee, and let thee alone: Hos. 4
17.
agreeable to that, He that is unjust, let him be unjust still, Rev. 22. 11.
etc. which is most fearful, and curse thy heart, as Christ did the Figtree,
never fruit grow on thee, never good motion come in thy heart, or if any do,
let them dye presently and not live, and give thee over to be more strongly
tempted by Satan; Devil, take him, and hurry him at thy pleasure, and lay down
thine own corruption unbridledly, which is the fearfullest curse under heaven:
O lets seek to escape it, and tremble, to prevent this fearful judgment, which
lights on many that have long lived under preaching, and are hardlier won at
last then before. Some of you happily having barren Trees in your Orchard, and
having resolved to cut them down, have tried one year more ere you cut them
down: We may fear there be sundry of us in this place going upon our last year
(who they be God knows) If now you listen not, Prove. 1. 24, etc.
the Lord will hew you down, and cast you into the fire; and then will you call
and cry to God, but in vain, he will not answer you then. When God shall cast
such into their deserved place, how shall they then fret and vex themselves?
What beasts were we that we did not yield to the Word of God, which so often
called upon us? Others obeyed, and they are well: O that we had profited at
such a time, when such good motions came in our minds! O that we had yielded
to them, and not cast them off as we did! but then all too late; they may fret,
and gnaw their tongues for vexation, but to no purpose: Endeavor we therefore
in time to prevent this. Thus of the Exhortation.

Now follows the Reason of the Exhortation laid down in the 16 Verse, Because
it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy; where is to be considered, 1. That he
urges still the matter in hand, and cannot have done with it. 2. How he urges
it, even by Scripture, It is written. 3. The Text it self, Be ye holy, for I am
holy.

1. I say, he still urges the matter in hand, much pressing his Exhortation
unto holiness, and is very earnest herein.

The Reasons may be these: Why the Apostle is so earnest in exhorting to
holiness.
1. Because the thing in hand is so excellent and necessary, then which nothing
can be more: Holiness makes us like God and Angels, unlike Devils and our
selves; without which there is no seeing of God. 2. Because we are altogether so
untoward thereunto: Who sees not what a work we have to bring any to turn from
their sins, and to take an holy course? how few such, and with what a deal of
pains? and when converted and brought to a love of holiness, and desire to
please God, yet who finds not what a stir he has to bring himself to any good
Duty, Prayer, Meditation, Examination of his heart, etc. or when we are brought
to do good things, yet to do them in a right manner, but the heart will be gone?
especially in all things, and in our whole conversation; therefore no marvel
though the Holy Ghost dwell long upon it.

1. This teaches us Ministers in weighty points, Use 1.
to dwell as it were upon them, and not sliding from them too quickly, to urge
them again and again, questioning their hearts whether indeed they will do so
and so, or not, etc.

2. People, Use 2.
when they perceive their Ministers so to urge such and such a point, Lam. 3.
40.
they must consider it the more seriously; so when we read any thing, 2 Cor.
13. 5.
wherein the holy Ghost is more earnest or repeats it often, as to search and
examine our selves, we must take knowledge of the weight of the matter, and of
our own dullness, dwelling the more thereon in our observation and attention;
where the holy Ghost is earnest, we must not pass it slightly over.

2. He proves it by Scripture, Ministers must prove their Doctrine by Gods Word
and so must we when we would prove any thing to the Conscience; for Gods Word
is the Judge of all truth and falshhood, good and evil; its the Golden rule,
the Balance of the Sanctuary. Luke 10. 25, 26.
Philosophers prove things by Reason, in Gods School proof must be from the
Scripture: We must not look what this man, or that man, or twenty men say, this
stablisheth not the Conscience; but the Word of God, that bears meat in the
mouth, that is of weight and authority, either to make to yield, or at least to
leave without excuse: One Testimony of Scripture, is of more weight then the
testimony of a thousand men, for that is the Word truth, and all men are
subject to error, and thereto may people say indeed, Acts 12. 22.
The voice of God, and not of man.

A number of people in Cities and great Towns, Use 1.
if Preachers allege, Fathers, Councels, Schoolmen, etc. O how they applaud
them! but if any shall allege Scripture, properly and plainly, Oh, he is a
plain homespun Preacher, he may do well in a Country Town; but Christ's sheep
do otherwise, they reverence and adore above all the Word of God.

This condemns the Papists, Use 2.
that deal most treacherously, and will not have the scriptures to be judge,
but Fathers, Councels, the Church; And who is the Church but themselves? and
the Head of Councels but the Pope? and so upon the point, the Pope is the
Church, and so its like enough to go well on their sides: And in their
Councels, who is any thing but the Pope and his Consistory? as he will have
every thing, so it shall be, as in their last Council of Trent, which they so
magnify as the most sacred Assembly that ever was, which indeed was nothing
else but a conspiracy of Traitors, against the Crown and Dignity of Christ
Jesus, and his Truth; there such were picked as were fast to the Pope and the
Religion of Rome, and such as were sworn to be true thereto; and when some few
spoke somewhat more boldly in some things, then was well liked of, they were
quickly packt out, and this charge they had after they had sat a while, That
they should interpret no Scripture, but such as might stand with the Doctrine
of Rome; this was good stuff, that whereas they should have brought their
Doctrine to the rule of Scripture, they must bring Scripture to their Doctrine,
as if the Carpenter should cut his rule according to the piece, and not the
piece according to his rule: And howsoever they sat there at Trent, disputing
for a fashion, yet nothing was concluded, but such as the Pope and his
Consistory at Rome devised, which being set to them, they were to publish; and
thus the parties become Judges, and they that should stand at the Bar to be
judged, sit on the Bench to judge their own cause, therefore it must needs go
well on their side: They cannot away that the Scripture should be the Judge,
because they then know how it would go with them and their Doctrine, but we
must receive it, and try all Doctrine by it, and stand to the sentence thereof,
as being the only Judge: So here the Apostle enjoining holiness, takes this as
a sufficient proof, It is written, though that was against their nature and
disposition; though by following after it, they might be counted Puritans,
Singular, Proud, Hypocrites, etc. yet they must not stand reasoning the case
with flesh and blood, they must be holy, for so it was written.

If then we know any thing once proved by the Word of God, Obedience is to be
yielded to those Doctrines which are proved by the Word.
we must make no more ado; if the Word command a thing, we must yield and obey;
if forbid a thing as vile, we must dare no more meddle therewith, then to eat
poison.

For the Word of God is the Royal Law, Reason.
that Rule of Righteousness that must command all the world, Prince and people
must stoop hereunto; Amos 3. 8.
This is the Law of his Kingdom, whereby all we his Subjects must be ruled: If
the Lion roar, the Beasts tremble; and if the Lord speak (who is our Sovereign)
is it not meet that we should take knowledge hereof, Deuteronomy. 5. 27.
and yield obedience thereto? this was ever Preface enough to the Prophets in
their Sermons, Thus says the Lord, The Word of the Lord, etc. and his Word not
being left us in vain, to shake it off at our pleasures, the same may command
obedience.

1. This condemns the profane and dissolute world, Use 1.
do men go by any such rule, and try, ere they do any thing what God says of
it in his Word? O that were too much preciseness: But by what rules then? If it
stand with my pleasure, with my profit, with my ease, with my credit, most do
so; I shall be accounted a fool if I do not so: O cursed rules, What? shall
Profit, Pleasure, Mammon, and our Lusts become now as it were our God? dare we
cast the word of God behind us? do we provoke the Lord to anger? are we
stronger then he? Oh let him that thinks, he stands, 1 Cor. 10. 12.
take heed lest he fall: Its written, we must be holy, therefore we must be so;
why, then its written, we may not swear; therefore we must not swear; so,
oppress, deceive, commit uncleanness, etc. because the contrary is prescribed
in the Word: And yet how dare men live in those very sins against the
Scriptures? Has not the world smarted sufficiently yet, whereat to take
warning? What threw Adam out of Paradise, drowned the old World, brought such
variety of Judgments upon the Jews from time to time, if not their
disobedience? have there drunkards enough, swearers, prophaners of the
Lord's Day, Usurers, etc. been plagued, and sent to Hell already? This rebelling
against the Word of God, has made all the racket and havoc in the world, and
has brought to confusion the Proudest and Mightiest: If we had not the Word,
but were left to the light of nature, God might condemn us for our sins, how
much more when by the Word he has told us all his mind? Well, let us look to
it, if the Word may not be a light to guide us, it will be a fire to consume
us; If it be not strong enough to make us yield obedience, it will be strong
enough to throw us headlong to confusion, as whereby we shall be judged at the
latter day: If when God smites any one part of us with pain in extemity, we be
weary of our selves, when yet we have many comforts, and many to pity us, and
hope also of an end thereof, what shall their care be that are smitten and
plagued in all parts of Body and Soul, there being no eye to pity them, nor
hope of an end? which yet ensues upon the disobedience to Gods Word; Then will
they fret and vex themselves, O beast that I was, that took not warning at such
and such a time, etc.

and be it with or (in appearance) against them, are willing to be ruled, let
these be of good comfort: Its a good mark of Christ's sheep, they hear his voice

Again, Gods Word the rule of all Truth.
in that its said, It is written; we note, That the Word of God is the rule of
all Truth and Doctrine.

This condemns the Papists, Use

Prophets and Apostles either would not, or could not, or might not leave a

of Traditions, John 5. 39. and 20. 24.

and bind their Conscience, as much as any of the written Word, Sadael de
verbo Dei Scripto.
and that upon peril of Damnation; which is a fearful Abomination.

They have indeed need of unwritten Traditions, to shore up a number of points
of their Religion, or else they would fall to the ground for all the written
Word of God, as having no authority from thence: But what a Religion is that,
which must thus be maintained without the Testimony of the Scripture? we must
learn to detest all such Traditions, else what a Flood-gate should we let open,
to let in all Errors and uncertainties without end; Yea, were this granted,
every dream of a Friars brain, and any old Custom, would be imposed upon the
people for a Law: Cursed be they that add to the All-sufficient Word of God,
Rev. 22. 18.
God will add to their plagues.

Word is the Rule, the written Word, the Canonical Scripture, that only.

There are other Books called Apochrypha, The use of the Apocrypha Books, with

usually joined with the Bible, which are not Gods Word, nor of equal authority
of the same, but are the writings of men, of good men, and have also good use;
some part for the helping out of the story of that dark time, from Malachi to
John the Baptist, and other parts for instruction in good manners, and to a
godly life, and are therefore to be read of us; yet were not they written by
any Prophet, are not Originally in the Hebrew (as all the Old Testament is) but
in the Greek; neither were received of the Jews, Romans 3. 2.
to whom were committed the Oracles of God, for which they were not blamed of
our Savior Christ, as questionless, they should have been, if they had done
amiss. Further, we find no Testimony of our Savior Christ, Evangelist or
Apostle, cited out of them: They have also their weaknesses and imperfections,
and the best parts thereof savor of a man, and have not the majesty and weight
of Gods Word; Therefore are they not sufficient whereon to ground any part of
our Faith, or to say, This is true, fo^so its written in such a book: No, but
to read them and try them, and where they consent with the Word, then say its
true, not because its so there, but because the Scripture approves it; where
they jar from Scripture, there are we to leave them: we must walk in a middle
path wisely and soberly, as not to match them with the Word of God, so not to
reject them, as some have done, for that they observed others magnify them too
much, hereby running into a contrary extremity. As nothing makes a handmaid so
much despised, Simile.
as when she is set in her Mistresses Chair, so long as she stands as an
handmaid, all like her, and say, she becomes her place well; So when the
Apocrypha is equalled with the Scripture, it is justly to be disliked, when
made to serve it, of good use.

It is written,] But he tells not where, because they were so well acquainted

and every part thereof, reading them diligently, as by our selves, so with our
Families; and great cause: We have a corrupt heart within us, therefore had
need have the Word dwelling in us to subdue it; John 5. 29.
We have plenty of duties, Col. 3. 16.
therefore had need of plenty of knowledge in the Word; we shall have plenty of
strong and subtle temptations from the Devil and World, Josh. 1. 8.

defend us, a Light to guide us, an Apothecaries shop containing all things for
meat and medecin for the food and health of our Soul, Purgations to purge out
our sins, Cordials to comfort us, Preservatives against every poisonful
temptation of Satan: Herein is our Fathers Will, wherein are our Legacies, in
every leaf and line some good.

that regard not to read the Scriptures, and therefore are exceedingly ignorant
therein, so that if a Minister quote a place, he had need name both Chapter and
Verse; nay, if it be amongst the books of the Old Testament, yea, some Epistles
of the New, they cannot tell whereabouts to find them, but are often fain to
turn to the Table of the Book. Rich men are so mad of the world, that they can
find no leisure, Mammon is so mighty with them, as God and his Word have no
time with them: And might they not find that in one leaf of the Bible, whereof
if they could make use, it would profit them more then the whole world? Some
are all for the world, out of one business into another; others can find
leisure to play at Tables, Cards, Bowls, etc. or to stand in shops two or three
hours, spending the time in idle discourses, and unprofitable frothy talk, if
not in hurtful slandering and backbiting their neighbors, and reproaching the
servants of God, who yet can find no time for the Word: Others are very
cunning in their Statute Books, but not so in the Scriptures: As for the poor,
because they be poor and not Book-learned, they think it concerns not them, or
that God looks for any such thing at their hands; and therefore are as ignorant
as if they lived in Turkey, altogether without fruit (as the fig tree whereunto
our Savior came) foolish, and carried away with every temptation, and all for
that they meditate not in Gods statutes: They live ignorantly and loosly, and
dye blockishly and miserably; yea, and they perish worthily, for that being
offered a guide, to take them as it were by the hand, and lead them through
this wilderness, this narrow unbeaten path, from all by-ways, and bring them to
Heaven, yet will not entertain the same. Simil.
If the King should send a Letter to any of his Subjects, and they would not
vouchsafe to open it, or look therein to read it, What a contempt were this?
The Scripture yet is the Lords Letter, sent to us to inform us of his will: O
what shall the condemnation of this Land be, that having the light, love
darkness better? and God having given us his Word, (which he gives not to all)
we make so light account thereof, we will not bestow the searching of it: Nay,
every toy proves sufficient to keep us from it, O woeful unthankfulness! How did
our Forefathers make account of the Word, Job, David, they in Queen Mary's
time, whereof some read it by stealth in Hay-gofes, etc.

O how precious was it to them! See the Book of Martyrs.
Cra threw away his Money, but kept his New Testament when he suffered
Shipwreck: Many poor Christians and dear servants of God in Spain, and
elsewhere, do now read the Word of God, and other good Books with peril of
their lives: O how shall they rise up against us, which may with peace and much
liberty, and sundry encouragements, read and be conversant in the Scriptures,
yet regard it not? God sends his Letter to us, we will not vouchsafe to open
it: What will we regard, if we regard not the Scriptures? I tell you, God has
no greater blessing to bestow on Mortal man: This little Book is the glory of
the world, without which all the world is but a dunghill, and if this were
taken away, it were better for us not to be, then to be, for we should do
nothing but grope in darkness, and be devoured of our lusts till Hell snatch us
away; lets learn therefore at last to be wiser, and that whilst we may:
Casting away our toys and vanities, learn we to be better acquainted with the
Word, then at any time heretofore; all that be strangers to it, be strangers to
true comfort: Yea, resolve we that no day shall pass us, without reading some
part of Scripture for our instruction, else how shall we do our duties each to
other? how use prosperity and adversity? how to learn either to live or dye?
Here (as good householders) we may provide store both for our selves and others.

For the words themselves, Be ye holy, for I am holy: They are taken (as ye
heard) out of Leviticus; Them the Lord used to his people, whom he had chosen
from all others, on whom he bestowed many outward mercies, and betrusted them
with his Word, who thought they should see round about them the Gentiles
abounding with idolatry, and all manner of sin, yet they must not follow them
therein: But as I have set you out from all other, for my self (says the Lord)
so set your selves apart to my use, and service, and be ye holy to me, as ye
observe me to be.

or Corner, or Town, more mercies then on others, he looks they should not be
as other places (that have not had the same favors, but have been left to
themselves) but abounding in holiness, holy as he himself is holy.

Here I might speak of this Land, Use.
what God has done for it, and what he expects at our hands, even that we
should be better then any other Nation; and then, how we are so far from being
more holy then others, that if any Nation have any sin, we get it from them,
and appropriate it to our selves: What should I speak of the common sins of the
times? The last Assizes, and every one shows what state we are in, what
horrible incests, the daughter being with child by her own father, and the
Wife burning the child; another ravishing his own daughter, being thereof
accused by his own child and wife; What cruel murders? besides the common
mother sins, ignorance, extreme worldliness, and that overspreading canker and
leprosy of this Land, the contempt of good persons: If any be more forward,
careful, zealous then the common sort, he is hated, mocked, discouraged all
that may be: Not the simplest fellow in a Town, though he cannot understand one
petition of the Lords Prayer, but will mock at those that be any thing toward
in Religion, or forward to hear the Word, refrain from disorder, and keep the
Lords Day, etc. this sin abounds most fearfully in this Land: In other
Religions, which are indeed false and irreligious, look who is most zealous and
forward, he is most reverenced and regarded; only in the true Religion, if any
be but careful to bring into use and practice, that which he hears and knows,
and dare not do as others, but rather reprove them, he makes himself as a
wondering stock, and is hooted as an howl, and one that shall sure be hoysed up
in charges, hu^cht at, complained of and vexed: This sin (not repented of nor
left) will be the moth and confusion of this Land, as we may justly fear. God is
every year upon us with one new punishment or other, but they prevail nothing,
we are as bad still or worse: what therefore may we not look for? How sped the
Israelites at last? we may fear, lest God make us as famous for judgment, as
we have been for mercies; we may fear, that it shall be said of all that pass
by, How is this famous nation become thus desolate? and answered, Because they
despised the Lord, his Gospel and servants, after many mercies bestowed upon
them, to have brought them in love therewith.

Be ye holy, etc.] Some urge this exhortation and the like to establish
Free Will, The Popish Doctrine of free will, has no ground from this place
but without cause: They show not what we can, but what we should do, and what
God will require of the wicked, or else condemn them, and what he will enable
his servants unto, as give their endeavor thereto; to the wicked they are
commandments of conviction, which God may justly require of them, because he
made them able to do the same; to his servants they are not so, but with the
exhortation he conveys such grace, as whereby they are enabled to do the same.

Lastly, Nor is it against the married estate.
this place is abused by sundry, to cry down the married estate, and to
magnify single life, but there is no holiness in the one, more then in the
other; Tertull.
for neither if we marry not have we the more (as the Apostle speaks about
eating) or marry have we the less, Hieron.
the Kingdom of God not consisting in these things: Romans 14. 17.
The benefit of the one more then the other, 1 Cor. 7. 32.
consists only in this, That a single life has freedom from many troubles and
cares, and so more liberty to every good duty, Ibid. 34*
but this gift is given but to few; therefore rather then they should live
discontentedly, he persuades them to marry: Let them therefore that live
single, take heed they put no holiness therein, or think that thereby they
please God the more, but rather let them use it well, and profit thereby, in
being so much the more zealous and forward in every good work, public and
private, else that their single life will one day be a witness against them;
but especially take heed of a filthy sole life, for many wanting the gift of
continency, yet to avoid troubles, cares, and charges of marriage, and that
they may live easily, proudly, and gather riches, will live singly, though
impurely; Such shall one day know, that they had better been married, then here
to burn with lust, and hereafter in hell for ever: Marriage is no opposite to
holiness, but an help thereto, ordained by God in man's innocence for holy ends,
Heb. 13. 4.
Honorable amongst all men, and the bed undefiled: Hereunto if a man enter
holily, and in the fear of God, beginning with prayer, then choosing for the
fear of God with consent of Parents, and care to know his duty, and praying for
Grace to bear the crosses of marriage, he cannot but find it holy. Thus of the
Reason.

Verse 17. And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons judges
according to every man's work, pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.
HEre the Apostle proceeds in matter not unlike the former: Before he
exhorted to holiness in all manner of conversation, now to pass our time in the
fear of God; the same thing, but in other words, and urged with new Reasons: Or
this may be the intent of the holy Ghost, to meet with a secret corruption of
man's heart, placing holiness in outward observance of duties (as the Jews were
much given that way) thereupon exhorting not to rest in the outward doing of
them, but to do them carefully, and in the fear of God, with desire therein to
glorify God, and to do the most good: And this fear of God is a great help and
fnrtherance to holiness. Herein he wills us to pass our time here in this
world, Why we ought here to pass our time in fear.
using three Reasons for the same; 1. From this Privilege, that we call God
Father, we must then so behave our selves as Children of such a Father, and as
he may not be ashamed of us, when we so call him, saying, Call thou me
Father? away varlet, and bastard, thou art none of mine, I acknowledge thee
not, neither have thou any quality of my Child. 2. From the nature of God, who
is a Judge, and that an upright one, who will Judge every man, and that without
partiality, and give him not according to the outside, but the inside of his
works. 3. From the invaluable price of our Redemption, laid down in the
following Verse. Speak we first of the Exhortation, then of the Reasons thereof.

Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.] This is the Exhortation; and
very requisite it is, to speak of the fear of God, that knowing the nature
thereof, we may the better try whether it be in us; for though most men will
challenge it to themselves that they love, fear, and put their trust in God,
and serve him, yet alas, there is no such matter in them, Hereof see Dr. Tailor
on Acts 10 p. 108.
there belongs more to it then the world thinks, as I hope we shall see ere we
part.

There be three kinds of fear; Three kinds of fear.
1. Natural, being an affection planted in man at his creation, Natural.
as his other affections, whereby he shuns any evil thing that comes toward
him, which is not in man only, but in all sensible creatures: This in it self
is not evil, it was in Adam in his innocence, Heb. 5. 7.
it was also in Christ, who was heard in that which he feared. If a man should
see a beast run at him, or a man with a drawn sword, he cannot but fear; only
the excess of it is a fault, when men having promises of Gods Providence and
Blessing, do not believe them, but are swallowed up of fear, are at their wits
end, made unfit for any duty, or reach out their hand to any unlawful shift or
means. Jacob no doubt was afraid when he heard of Esau's coming against him,
but yet his faith comforted him in his fear, and made him pray to God, and use
wise and lawful means. David, when they of Ziklag were ready to stone him,
feared, no doubt, but yet by faith comforted himself over it, that it did not
swallow him up, which is a thing worthy to be spoken of, because many good
servants of God, are yet fearful to be alone in the dark, fearful of death, of
the day Judgment: The best may be so a little, but we must take head of too
much fear, being in our way, and having Gods Promises, as our Savior to Peter,
when he cried out, Mat. 14. 31.
Save, Master, I perish, so may it be said unto us thus fearing, O ye of little
Faith. 2. Slavish; Slavish.
when men fear God only in respect of his wrath and punishment, and abstain
from sin, not for any hatred thereof; or do good, not for love, but either
because Gods judgments are on them already, or hang over them, were it not for
them, they would not care what they did: As a galley-Slave that rows and toils
but only for fear of the whip, Simile.
and were it not for that, he would do nothing, being in the mean time so far
from any love, as he could eat his heart for whom he works; or as a Trewandly
Boy, that learns only for fear of the rod, not out of any love to his Book or
Master: This may be and is in the reprobate, as in Ahab and Pharaoh, but is not
that (as neither the former) which is meant here. Filial.
3. Filial or son-like fear, whereby the Children of God considering his Power,
See Mortons Threefold estate page 122.
Justice and Truth, and especially his Goodness in it self, and showed toward
them, stand in a reverend awe of him, and are careful to please him, fearful to
offend him, even chiefly for the love they bear him, yea, and would not grieve
him, though they knew they should not be punished for it, as having been so
gracious and merciful a Father to them; as a good and gracious Child would not
willingly grieve his father, though he knew he would not cast him off, or shut
him out of doors, This last often enjoined.
even because he is a loving Father unto him: This proceeds from Faith, and is
that which is here meant.

Hereunto we are often exhorted, Psa. 2. 11.
as may be seen by the places quoted in the margent, Eccles. 12. 13.
which (howsoever abused by the Papists, 2 Cor. 7. 1.
who understand them of slavish fear, Phil. 2. 12.
to overthrow assurance of Salvation, and to maintain that vile Opinion, That a
true Christian may fall finally) are meant of a reverend awe of offending God,
which is not only not against Faith, but stands well with it, nay proceeds
from it, yea, the more Faith, the more such fear.

This proceeds from the consideration both of Gods greatness and goodness,
Whence it proceeds. The benefits hereof, Pro. 1. 7

This is the beginning of wisdom, Heb. 11. 7.

at other times they care not what they do, or at least be as before.

Contrarily the true fear of God is known by these notes; 1. To hate Prove. 8.
13.
but inward corruptions of the heart, Genesis 39. 9.
as Joseph might with uncleanness with his Neh. 5. 15.
but would not, as fearing God. 5. Such as a man may carry out by strong hand,
Joh. 31. 15, 21, 23.
by might and authority, and no body to control him, yet dares not do it,
because there is an higher who has forbidden Isa. 50. 10. and 66. 1, 15.
so is the other.

If it be thus, Use. 1.
then I may too truly and plainly conclude, That there is but a little fear of
God in this Land; for how few hate evil, secret corruptions, all evil, such as
they can go cleanly away with, such as they can carry away by might and color
of Law? How many live profanely, as if there were no God, no Law, no Judgment
day, no reckoning to be made, but do what their lust leads them too; and that
which some would not, nor durst do for a world, they make no bones of.

Another sort live securely and carelessly, not so bad as the former, but such
as look not to God, nor set him before their eyes in their deeds.

Others perform more duties to God, but so as they regard not why, nor in what
manner, but rest in the work wrought, not casting with themselves how they may
do them aright, and thereby taking notice as well of their own weakness, as
Satan's malice.

Others slavishly fear in their misery, but in their prosperity regard nothing
but their own will: These being called out, a few there be remaining that truly
fear God, See B. Halls 3. epistle of his 6. Decad.
for which he may justly have an heavy controversy with this Land, that after
so many happy means, so few should be found that truly fear him, though many
think they do: How few keep Gods commandments all, always with delight? let
every man examine himself carefully by these notes.

If any be loath, and would have a wider sieve, truly I can give no wider, God
has given me no wider to let Hypocrites, Profane Persons, etc. escape through;
I try you but by the Word, and by it you must be judged at the last day.

But for those that do indeed fear God, Use 2.
there is abundant comfort for them, Prove 31. 30.
they have that which is better then all the world; Psalm 112. 1. and 128. 1.
yea, Gods mouth pronounces them blessed. Both the quoted Psalms are a
storehouses of promises made to such; there are others also in Psalm. 25 12, 14.
and 34. 9, 10. and 84. 11. and Mal. 3. 16, 17. which are duly to be weighed:
Such as fear God, need fear neither Man, Death, Devils, Hell, Day of Judgment,
etc. which are indeed the terror of the world, only let them be provoked to
fear him more and more; for even of Gods children, not a few have but a small
measure hereof, whereby it comes to pass, that they hate not sin so heartily in
themselves and others as they should, neither are such enemies to privy
corruptions, but that they break out often, and so pull many a sorrow and gripe
of Conscience upon themselves, which more fear of God would have prevented: Our
often falls argue too little fear, as may appear by our small zeal to duties,
and our little trembling at the Word of God; therefore labor we for more, 1
King. 18. 3^*
that it may be said of us as of Obadiah, That we fear God greatly, Prove. 19.
23.
that so we may be preserved from evil: Oh, this is the keeper of all virtues,
holding all in good order, a watchman indeed to look to our heart; if it be
there, and temptation comes, up starts it, and says, Nay: This will keep the
heart clean, hold out ill, set us on to good.

Means to attain hereunto, Means to attain unto the fear of God.
may be these, Let us often set before our eyes our own baseness, Gods
greatness, power and justice, with the effects thereof on Adam, the old world,
and others; especially do we consider what God has done for us, that so our
care and resolution may grow how to please God: If this religious awe be in us,
O how it will keep our lives from innumerable evils, and replenish them with
all goodness, that having finished them well, we may come to the Lord in peace
at our latter end: O if we did consider the unspeakable mercies of God toward
us, we should see cause enough, though there were no hell, yet to fear more
then death it self to offend God; but because our nature is so exceeding lewd
and prone to sin, its good to think often, that that God under whose power we
live hates all sin, and will not let any go unpunished: What cause have we then
to grow in the fear of God, that have seen his greatness and just displeasure
against sin so much, every year one punishment or other? What cause have we
also to fear God, that have such experiences of his goodness in 88. when he
delivered us from the Spanish Armado, and after from the Gunpowder Treason,
and now of late has begun to relent toward us, A great drought, Anno 1615.
and gives us some showers of rain? But alas, if we will prove our selves by
the notes before mentioned, it will be evident that most have not the fear of
God, which is a fearful thing: As no better testimony can be given of a man
then this, that he fears God, as Job and Obadiah; so none more fearful then
this, There Is no fear of God before his eyes, Mal. 3. 8.
none in his heart, God has threatened to be a swift witness against such;
Deuteronomy. 28. 58. 59, 65, 66, 67.
and such may justly fear all things, even the tiles of their houses, Job 15. 2.
their tools, every style they go over, every crow that flies over their heads,
all creatures, from the angels to worms; they have cause to fear the bread they
eat, the hair of their own face, lest it choke them, yea, the thought of their
own mind, lest it turn to their ruin: And though happily they do not fear, yet
they have cause so to do, epecially lest the Devil pursue them in every corner,
and lest God should give him commission to haunt them and theirs: They have
cause to fear every thing, as Cain doubtless, that every thing would kill him:
a fearful state; yet none so bold as blind Bayard, none fear so little, as
they who should fear most: well, they that fear Gods judgments least, shall
feel them most.

Let them therefore labor to get out of this case, and seek to be reconciled to
God, else they shall fear him in spite of their hearts at the dreadful day,
when they shall stand quaking like Belshazzar, when the Lord shall come from
heaven in flaming fire, etc. when he shall come armed against them.

Pass the time] That is, God requires our whole time for his service
the whole time, for he names no part of time; he will have all, as who made
all, who is worthy of all, if it were more and a great deal better, Prove. 23.
17. and 28. 14.
and we owe nothing to any, but to him; we owe the World, Flesh, and Devil
nothing: What fruit and joy shall we have to do that which we must again undo
or unsay, Luke 1. 35.
and vomit up our sweet morsels: Is there any service to the Kings service? Can
we spend our time better then in Gods? There is no part of it that God allows
to spend in vanity; even our youth must be employed for God, which is the best
time of all, when wit is freshest, and the memory best, yea, the whole man
every way fittest to serve God.

1. This condemns the common sort, Use 1.
which (though they mind to serve God afterward) think their youth too good,
and too soon for Gods service, yea, think themselves hardly dealt with, if any
persuade them to leave their tricks of youth, and turn to God; nay, they think
it unseemly (so vile is the World grown) to be Religious in youth, and that its
never spent in the kind, except it be in Swaggering, Vanity, Ruffianlike hair,
and Fashions, Riot company, Drinking, etc. They think its time enough to repent
afterward, when they have been married a while, and they be groan somewhat
ancient: Thus vile wretches dally with God, and their souls, giving the wine to
the Devil, reserving the lees and Cask for God: But is thy Youth too good for
God, think thou? and is not too good for the Devil and thy lusts? Who is the
better Master? Who pays the better wages? which is the better work? the Devils
Kennel stuff, or Gods service in righteousness and holiness? that which thou
must afterward unsay, and be ashamed of, or this that is pleasing to God, and
Angels? Fond Youth, that promises to thy self repentance afterward, see thy
folly, know thou that thou shall live? can thou boast of to morrow? has
not God cut off many as likely to live as thy self, and prevented their
Repenrance? Nay, what if thou knew thou should live, have thou power to
Repent? do not many after they are grown ancient, find as great a let of the
world, as in Youth they did of their pleasures? and have become so worldly,
that they have been as far from Repen^ance as before? and this is just with
God, because they will take upon them to be carvers of his gifts at their
pleasure: And what if thou knew thou should both live and repent, yet
were it not better for thee to turn to God now, then to follow thy lusts till
then, and so to be long out of the service of righteousness? This were, as for
one to feed on draff and Hogs meat, which might have Angels food: And besides,
thou treasurest up a great deal of sorrow for thy self, and it may be, fasten
some punishment upon thee, such as thou shall never get out of in this life,
though thy soul be saved: Therefore follow the Lords counsel, who knows what is
best for thee. Begin betimes, come into the Lords work with the first, before
the Devil has trained thy wit, tongue, etc. so will it be easy to thee, and
never depart from thee, and (though there be a divelish proverb, A young Saint,
an old Devil, yet) if thou be truly turned to God in thy youth, thou shall
never fall off: Contrarily, they that take liberty to be young Devils, in hope
to be old Saints, if God snatch them away while they be such, they will never
prove either young or old Saints.

2. This condemns those that can afford no part of their time to the fear of
God, Use 2.
but still its too soon: They have spent their time lewdly and vainly, as the
Prodigal, as their middle age in extreme hunting for the world, and yet in old
age its too soon till their deathbed: How many wicked, profane, covetous old
men are there, of fifty or sixty years, and yet as far from God as ever? They
smell of the Spade, but savor not of God, nor any goodness; these be
unreasonable persons, and see what truth is in the Devil: He makes men believe
he will hold them but a while, yet when the time is more then come, he will
hold them still, not let them go; what a fearful answer have such men to make,
that should spend all the time of their life in Gods service, and spend none?
when God shall call them to an account for their time, how they have spent
their youth, how their middle and old age, and find that none was for himself,
all for the Devil, then shall they certainly have their wages, with whom they
have wrought.

3. This condemns also those that having come in late into the vineyard, Use 3.
yet work lazily, do not thoroughly employ themselves in this great work.

4. This may stir up Gods servants to afford God their whole time, Use 4.
for that he requires: Alas, none of us have done so, but spent a great deal in
vanity and lewdness, grievous to be spoken of, some more, some less; every one
of us have come short of that we should have done: what then? This cannot be
called back, it must be redeemed; and seeing we came not so early to the Lords
work as we should, we must now work the harder; The longer it was ere we came,
the more painful we must be, and employ us the faster, and now be as earnest in
goodness, as we have heretofore in vanity; we must now speak as much for God,
as heretofore for Baal, and for goodness against the enemies thereof, as
herefore in defense of Sin. Simile.
As travelers that have loytered in their way, when they see Night approach,
ride hard; so let us be as earnest, and go as far to draw men to God, as we
were wont to call them to vanity; let old men that came in so late, call upon
young men, and give them counsel by their own miserable experience; and if any
call us, let us go as readily and gladly, as ever we did to any pastime, and
the worse we have been before, be now (as the Apostle Paul) so much the more
zealous: What shall we say to those that came not in till the tenth or eleventh
hour, had they not need to work night and day? as also set forward the work in
others all that ever they can, calling on others, and on their Families to this
end, and spending all their affections about this? They cannot but vex to think
how they have spent their youth and middle age, thereupon wishing with all
their soul, that they had spent the same in Gods service.

5. But for those that have long continued in this Christian course, Use 5.
they must not now leave off, but continue therein to the end. There Is no time
wherein we must cast off our care, or lay away our Armor, or be off our watch:
What! must ancient Christians walk in awe and fear of offending still? Alas,
yea: Have they not still an evil and false heart? Will the Devil ever be at
peace? Nay, he laboreth with old Christians most, that he may foil them in the
end, to make them call their estate, and all they have done into question, and
to shame their profession, and open their enemies mouths: The righteous are
but scarcely saved; 1 Pet. 4. 18.
all our diligence, watchfulness, care, is little enough to carry us through
this evil world, wherein so many enemies lie in wait for our souls. Besides we
see such famous Examples as Moses and Aaron, those famous servants of God, who
yet in their old age at the waters of Meribah doubted, and did not glorify
God, Number. 20. 10, 11, 12.
but said, Hear ye rebels, etc. So Noah, that had seen the old world drowned,
himself miraculously preserved, and been a Preacher of Righteousness so long, in
his old age was caught with Wine, and uncovered in his Tent: So Solomon to whom
God appeared twice, and was the mirror of Wisdom, yet how fell he in his latter
time? so Asa and Joash. The Devil will say of an ancient Christian, This man
has done me much hurt, has been constant many years, and many have followed
him, now if I can foil him in his old age it will be worth the while; so shall
I make him call all the time past into question, Prove. 23. 17. and 28. 14.
shake weak ones, make my company cry out, Look on this old professor, they are
all Hypocrites: Be we therefore in the fear of the Lord all the day long, for
happy is the man that fears always: O let ancient Christians look to
themselves now a while, and anon they shall be at their journeys end! so look
to thy self, that as thou have begun and proceeded well, so you may shut up
all well, as Abraham, Heb. 11. 39. and 13. 14
Isaac and Jacob, who dyed in the faith, and had good report in the Church of
God.

Of your sojourning] We are here but for a little while, Doctr.

and must away to our Country and Home in Heaven: Therefore we must pass this
little time so as we may honor God, and so provide for our end, as that dying
we may live for ever; our life is so frail, as that it cannot (as I may so
speak) be set out by things frail enough: 2 Cor. 5. 1.
Its compared to a Tent, set up in the Morning, pulled down at Night; some
booths stand two or three days, some a weak, but easily overthrown, quickly
removed; so to a Vapor, a Bubble, Iam. 4. 14.

whether we be eating, drinking, sleeping, waking, playing, etc. it continually
runs on, and never stands at a stay: The swiftest things have staid, even the
Sun it self at Joshua's prayer, but not Joshua's life, nor any man's: Many dye
the same day they are born, some the same year, some in their youth, and even
they that live longest, yet dye: We are as a Traveller that lodges in an Inn
for a Night, as a Player comes on the Stage to play his part, longer or
shorter, and comes away when its done; or as one that goes to the Market, to
buy one thing, and to sell another, and then home again. Therefore we have
great reason to spend the time of our sojourning here in fear, we should spend
that little time in well-doing to glorify God, do good in our places, and work
out our own Savation; not havocking away our precious time, or spending it
about needless things, Gal. 6. 10.
as God has given us this time, so to do the work that he has sent us hither
for: This the Apostle requires of the Galarians, As we have therefore
opportunity, let us do good unto all men, where is employed, that having but a
little while to tarry, we are to bestir our selves: Whatsoever thy hand finds
to do, do it with thy might (says the Preacher) even whatsoever our duty does
any way require of us: Eccles. 9. 10.
I must work the works of him that has sent me (says our Savior) while it is
a day, John. 9. 4.
so must we: Psalm. 90. 12.
This is the effect of that prayer, Teach us so to number our days (as being
few, flitting and hasting away) that we may apply our hearts to wisdom, even do
a wise man's part, to know the work we came hither for; see we do it, and not
spend our few days in other business and lewdness, that we must after be
ashamed of, such work as we shall never have thanks for: Seeing we are but on
this Stage, to play a part and down again, it were meet we should play an
honest Man's part, the Christians part, the good Magistrates, the good Ministers
part, the good Husbands, the good Parents part; not a Thieves part, nor a
Cousener, nor the part of an idle Person.

for to morrow we shall dye, as if they had said, the Prophets say, we shall be

pleasure because they have had it already, yet) that pain, and that eternal,
will lay hold on them: Sour sauce to their sweet meat.

2. This condemns the common sort, Use 2.
which will not consider of the shortness of their life, though both the
Scriptures and Experience preach it continually, and therefore thinking the
time long, care not how they squander it away, and thereupon follow their
pleasure, as drinking, riotous living, etc. even selling themselves hereto; and
so (to use their own Phrase) drive away the time: Alas, they need not drive it,
it runs fast enough, unless they spent it better: Others are all for the world,
toiling and moiling night and day, scraping together by hook and crook, and
mind nothing else: Is this the work for which God sent you into this world? Is
Lying, Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, Whoring, etc. any of Gods work? pointed he
out any time for this? And did he set you here only to rake for the World, to
Oppress, Deceive, gripe the Poor, etc? No, but to set forth his glory, and work
out your own Salvation; but this lies all undone, you never went about it, as
neither to do good in your places, in the Church, Commonwealth, Town, Family,
etc. where you live: Now if you have done hurt to the glory of God, your own
Souls, Simile.
and to others by your ill example, have you not (think you) spent your time
well? A man has two Servants, and sends them to Market to sell his Corn, do
Errands, buy Provision, etc. The one, when Market begins, gets him to an
Alehouse with his Companions, and there calls for beer by the yard, or by the
dozen, and sits quaffing, and prating, and gaming, and thereafter has his
Harlot, thus holding on till Night, and then is the Market done: The other
being a worldly fellow, pitcheth down his Masters sack, and spying good
Commodities, he falls to look after them for his own gain, and buyeth what is
cheapest, and most profit to be had by, and so he spends the day, wholly
omitting his Masters business: Well, Market is done, and all the people gone:
Being come home, their Master falls a reasoning, What, was it a good Market to
day? how sold the Corn? and have ye sold it all? have you brought Provision?
did you the Errand to such a Man? They answer, they have not done any of those;
No, says he, what then? What have you done, Sirrah? And what you? How spent
you your time? One makes answer, I went into an Alehouse to drink two or three
pots, and good fellows came in so fast, and held me till Night, that I could
not do your business: The other says, he saw there some good Bargains and
Penyworths to be had, and while he followed these for himself, Market was done
ere he was aware: would not the Master hereupon pull the coats of these varlets
over their ears? would he not discard them in his displeasure, yea and get them
punished? yet thus for all the world do most men with God; Some hunting after
their pleasures, as others after the things of this world: Well, let them that
have hitherto misspent and lost their time, let them, I say, yet ere Night
come, bethink themselves and fall to their work, and dispatch it ere Market be
done, and thank God that they be yet alive: Its better to be a living Dog then
a dead Lion; Eccles. 9. 4.
thank God thou have yet an hour, and use it well. There be thousands in Hell,
that if they had the whole world, would give it for one hour here upon earth,
and if it were so much worth to them, its as much worth to thee, that have lost
all the hours of thy life hitherto; O therefore whilst thou have yet an hour,
bestir thee, for the night approaches: Thou have played a bad man's part
hitherto, now ere thou go off the stage, unsay that part, and tell the world
it was not that part thou should have played; now begin the honest man's part,
defer not all thy work to the last, as most men do, that think when they be
sick, and fear they shall dye, Oh, then they will send for a Minister, and as
though we could work miracles, we must teach them in a rice the whole way to
Heaven; and, O I pray you give me some good counsel, I sent for you to speak a
few comfortable words to me, and then either the Minister daubeth with
untempered mortar (which is a just judgment) or if he be faithful, and begin
to wade into his misery, this he thinks to be strange; Oh, I sent for you to
tell me some-words of comfort, not to speak so much and such things to me. And
let all good Christians be wise, let us think of our brittle state, lets ply
us, and be doing all the good we can to our selves or others; and do not we put
off from time to time, I will next year take up prayers more constantly, when
such a business shall be over; I will be liberal hereafter, or at my death, I
hope I shall do my duty in due time; O fie upon it, that a Christian should
say. Hereafter, and be bold to put off time, and in the mean time we dye; Oh,
do all the good we should now, lest on our deathbed with grief we be forced to
say, Oh, I thought to have left this sin, done that duty, etc. if I had lived a
year longer, I would have put off some of my dealings that have clogged me,
given up some of my Farms; I purposed to have got out of the Usurers books, and
never take that course more; I purposed to have done more service to the Town
where I live, more good then ever, and now death prevents me.

And if ye call on the Father] Now we come to the Reasons of the Exhortation,
The first Reason of the foregoing Exhortation.
whereof the first is, Because they called God Father, it was therefore meet
they should walk as children in awe and reverence, and that not when and
wherein they list, but in all things, for he cannot be their Father unless they
be his Children. An impregnable reason, That they which call such an holy God
Father, Doctr.
should walk in fear and obedience as sons: Such as call God Father, must walk
in fear and obedience as sons.
No Father without sons, and the very name of Father calls for reverence and
obedience; Therefore when God would include all Superiors (to whom reverence
and obedience is due) Magistrates, Ministers, Masters, Governors, etc. he calls
them in one word, Exodus 20. 12.
Fathers; even as he that calls one Master, thereby professes service and
obedience, and the King his Sovereign, professes subjection, so calling God
Father, we do thereby make known our filial awe and reverence. See Mal. 1. 6.


By the name of Father (which we ascribe to our Fathers) as we acknowledge one
to be the Author of our Being, 2 Cor. 6. 18.
and that we owe him obedience, What the name Father implies.
so we challenge much of him, as that he should have a care of us, to preserve
us, defend us, and provide for us all things needful, for thus do Fathers to
their children, especially their dutiful ones; in like manner when we call God
Father, we both ascribe so much to him, and profess to look for so much from
him, as that it requires of us to pass our time in a reverent awe of him in
all things.

1. This condemns them that live wickedly, Use 1.
and in their sins, and yet call God Father; they might as well say any thing:
If one should fight against the King on his Enemies part, and say he were a
good Subject; or say he is a man's servant, and yet does nothing that he is
bidden, but is drunken, quarrels with his fellow servants, beats his Master
children, breaks down his windows, rails upon him, should this be counted a
good servant, or the other a good subject? so the Lord defies that such should
call him Father, and counts it a disgrace to him to be called Father of such
miscreants, See Psalm. 50. 16
that live like bastards, that have no care to please God, Ier. 3. 3, 4.
no fear of offending him, Luke 6. 46.
nor delight to be in his presence: We should take it as a disgrace to have
some base and filthy person come in a market to us, and call us father, yet
this may and does befall men, yea, good too, who have lewd children, and such be
like them neither in favor nor condition: yea, there is scarce one child like
the Father, or one like another; but its nor so with God, he has never a
child but is like him, and has his image in him, Psalm. 15. 2. ver. 15. of
this 1 John 3. 9.
like hearted and like handed to him, innocent hands, and a pure heart, holy as
he is holy, hating sin as he he does, loving his Word, People, Righteousness,
etc. as he does, He that is born of God, sins not: Those are true properties
of a child of God; yet even others have a father too, Christ has pointed him
out, Ye are of your Father the Devil, Ioh. 4. 48.
and the lusts of your Father you will do: Such as care for no goodness, nor
for Gods children, but are Liars, Deceivers, Oppressors, and the like, they are
like the Devil; God is not their Father, but their Enemy, with such all the
Angels and Creatures are at defiance, and wait for their destruction; all the
judgments of God hang over their heads, their death will be a passage to their
endless woe and misery.

Therefore never call God Father till thou change thy manners, nor look for any
privilege of a child from him, as either protection or maintenance, no nor so
much as good look: But shall I thus leave these? God forbid; for though we
find them children of the Devil, yet we would be glad to bring them to be
Gods: Therefore humble your selves, confess your sins, as the Publican and the
Prodigal, entreat and sue for Pardon, change thy behavior, and when thou can
feel thy heart effected like a Child, or truly desirous so to be, then call
him Father: In the mean time, if thou would mourn for thy sins, and labor
for a contrite heart, See 2 Cor. 6. 17.
and abstain from every unclean thing, thou should be received, thy sins
pardoned, and God would be a Father unto thee; But if thou go on in this
graceless course, as thou workest, so shall thy wages be.

2. But do thou unfeignedly desire to fear God, Use 2.
1. In thy general calling as a Christian, to walk holily, righteously, and
soberly? Fear thou to offend God thy self, or to see him dishonored by
others? carest thou to please him? love thou to be in his presence? do thou
conscionably hear his Word, and patiently bare his Corrections? 2. In thy
special calling, art thou careful to glorify God, as a Parent, Child, Master,
Servant, etc. not only in ceasing to do evil, but in doing good, yea, and
laboring to do it well? Thou may comfortably, and with good leave call God
Father, and make account of him so to be, 1 John 1. 12.
which is the greatest privilege in the world; Christ is thy Brother, thou art
Heir with him of all good things in this world, and Salvation in the Kingdom of
Glory hereafter: Angels guard thee, nay, are thy Servants; Afflictions,
Corrections, Death no Death, but a passage to Life: O let us be persuaded to
increase more and more in this care, and every time we call God Father, we may
be put in mind, and provoked to labor for the affections of dutiful Children!
We can readily look that God should be a Father to us, that we want nothing,
but we for our parts, can be content to be wanting in our duties many ways, we
neglect this and that duty; yea, in those we perform, how cold are we, little
differing from Hypocrites? how often do we break out into gross evils? how
little grieved, when we offend or see others offend? for these the Lord is
often driven to afflict us. As its between natural Parents and Children, we see
that love descends, but seldom ascends; They look for all maintenance from
their Parents, but care little how small reverence or obedience they give them;
So we deal with God, our head must not ache a little, but he must presently give
ease, but we can be slack enough in the performance of our parts.

Who without respect of persons, judges according to every man works,] Here Is
the second Reason, The second Reason of the foregoing Exhortation.
He whom we call Father, is also a Judge, and that a very sharp-fighted one,
that will not be carried away with shows, and false glosses of good works, but
will look into the inside, and judge accordingly; If they proceed from an
honest heart, he will surely reward them, if not, they shall not only miss the
reward they look for, but have, for all their gay shows, their reward with
Hypocrites: Therefore it stands us in hand not only to renounce evil, and to
do good, but to do the same with a right affection.

Here I might speak how God judges, How God does and will judge of men's
actions.
and will judge men's actions: as 1. In this life he approves the ways of his
Servants by his Word, and by his blessings upon them outward and inward; and
disalloweth the wicked actions of the World, 1. In this life.
and their courses, by his Word, 2. At death.
and by his judgments sometimes. 2. In the end of this life, by receiving the
soul of the one into glory, and by casting down the other to confusion. 3. On
the day of Judgment.
3. And especially at the last day, by receiving the one into everlasting
glory, and throwing the other into endless misery. Which may

1. Make us all look to our ways, Use 1.
to walk in reverence and fear all our days: To this purpose peruse Ecles. 12.
13, 14. Act. 24. 16. 2 Cor. 5. 9. 2 Pet. 3. 11.

2. Be a strong bit to hold back the wicked from running on; Use 2.
nay, to bring them on their faces for that which is past, that it may be here
pardoned, that they meet not with all their abominations at that day: For we
must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, 2. Cor. 5. 10.
that every one may receive the things done in his body, See Rev. 1. 7. and 20.
12.
according to that he has done, whether it be good or bad: Even they that have
been judges of others, they that have been quit, yea, they that have had their
sentence here too, shall appear before a wise Judge that cannot be deceived, a
Just one that will not be bribed, from whom they cannot flee, as being Infinite.

But because this is not the main drift of the Apostle, I pass it over the more
briefly, the chief force lying in this, That God judges according to man's
works, without respect of persons.

The person of man is taken, The person of man how taken.
1. For those outward qualities that be common to good and bad, that yet set
out a man, as Birth, Wit, Deuteronomy. 16. 19.
and yet the same is prohibited of God; He forbids it in others, therefore will
not himself have respect of persons.

Therefore let no man think he shall escape better by his Wealth, Use.
Birth, Learning, Authority, etc. and because of them embolden himself to do
that which a poor ignorant mean man may not; Gods laws be not Spiders-webs:
Nay, for these a man shall escape the worse, for the greater the wages are which
God gives, he requires the more work; the higher place he sets men in, he looks
for the better carriage: where there is more knowledge, there must be more See
Psalm. 51. 6. and Romans 2. 2.
and respects with what heart its done, and from what affection it comes:
Isa. 1. 15. and 58. 4.
The Jews did abound in their outward works and service, yet their hands being
full of blood and abomination, his own Ordinances were irksome to him, See Mic.
6.
and accordingly he did reject their Humiliation, though it was extraordinary:
So he respected not the sacrifice of Cain, Genesis 4. 5.
though he were the firstborn, nor made choice of Eliab, 1. Sam. 16. 7.
for all his outward appearance. John 4. 24.
God is a Spirit, Prove. 23. 26.
and will be served with a spiritual service; My son (says he) give me thy
heart; 1 Chro. 28. 9.
God sees into the heatrs and reins, whom therefore we are to serve with a
perfect heart and willing mind.

To the being of a good work, Four things required to the being of a good work.
these things are required; 1. That the person be justified in Christ, and so
pleasing to God. 2. That it be done in Faith, or a particular persuasion of the
lawfulness of the thing done. Genesis 4. 4.
3. It must proceed from a sanctified heart, Romans 14. 23.
else the fountain being impure, makes the sacrifice or work abominable to God.
1 Cor. 10. 31.
4. It must be done to a good and right end, our own discharge, and the good of
our brethren, as inferior ends, but the main end, the glory of God.

1. Here are rejected all the works of natural and unregenerated men, Use 1.
all the civil virtues in the Heathen Philosophers, their Justice, Temperance,
Splendida percata.
Liberality, Fortitude, contempt of the World, Patience, and the like, which
great works of theirs were but shining sins: So the actions of such as are
merely civil, though never so fair conditioned to the world-ward, these are in
no account with God, nay their hearing, praying, Almsgiving, are abominable,
till their persons please God, and be sanctified; and all such, though happily of
great age, did never in thoughtword, or deed please God, trust nor then to
these things: Oh, many will brag with the Pharisee of their just dealing, but
resting thereon, they shall have the Pharisees reward. Many a poor man will
say, I thank God I have lived honestly, followed my work, earned my living
truly, no man can say, Thus and thus have thou done amiss; but even this not
done to a right end and in a right manner, is sin.

O but Christ loved the rich young man, Object.
though not yet converted.

He loved that seed or good that was in his own work, Sol.
but not the person.

2. Here are rejected all works of Heretics, Use 2.
though never so costly, devour, painful; as their early rising to Mass, their
painful travel on Pilgrimage, their costly gifts to Religious houses: So of
other nations, that coming into the Temples of their gods, throw themselves
down on the ground, smite themselves on the breasts, etc. of all these being
done without Faith, God will say, Who required these things at your hands? The
faster one runs in a wrong way, the further he is out, and the longer ere he
come in.

3. Here are rejected the works of hypocrites and carnal Gospellers, Use 3.
which make a profession, hear, receive the Lords Supper, join in outward
performance of duty, but look not to themselves, their hearts remaining tainted
with their lusts: Such as yet live in some sins, may go to Hell with Water of
Baptism on their faces, and the Bread of the Lord in their mouths. They care
not how works be performed, but slubber them over, so they be out of their
hands, they care not how; these will be paid according to their work: They make
sale ware for the Lord, slight and of no substance, but this the Lord cannot
abide, he will have it substantial: If it come not inwardly from a good heart,
let the outside be what it will, its but like a painted Tomb or gilded Idol,
hollow within, that cannot speak. We are here met to day to hear Gods Word, a
good work, an excellent work, if all came with an upright heart, God requiring
it, and that we should know his will, and in all things be ruled thereby, but
few be such; but when they have heard all they can, yet do as they list, at
least in part: Its true, Ahabs hypocritical repentance was rewarded with a
temporal benefit, but not for love of the work, but for example to others, how
well God would reward things done in truth.

4. Let this teach all Gods servants, Use 4.
not only to have a care to do duties (so can hypocrites) but to do them in a
right manner: Herein lies the difficulty to bring our vile hearts to do them
aright, else the doing of the duty is an easy thing, and no straight way, if
that were all; but we have a wretched heart, full of inwindings and privy
corruptions, that cannot be seen to others when we do our duties, for even
sundry of them are unknown to our selves, pride, hypocrisy, dullness,
earthliness, unbelief, and the like; look therefore when we Hear, Pray, give
Alms, follow our Callings, or whatsoever, that we do it well and substantially,
using all skill and diligence, for we have a God with whom we deal, that looks
to the inside, and hates all slightings; and he will pay well, cares not what
he gives so the work be done well. Commonly men that be good husbands, will
look to have their work well done; so does the Lord, and he pays presently in
hand, Peace of Conscience, Joy in the Holy Ghost, with diverse outward
Blessings, besides the inheritance reserved for us hereafter.

Verse 18. Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible
things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition
from your Fathers; Verse 19. But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a
Lamb without blemish, and without spot.
Here Is another main Reason of the foregoing Exhortation, The third Reason of
the foregoing Exhortation.
drawn from a wonderful benefit bestowed upon us, namely, Redemption, procured
by no less price then the precious blood of Christ; Were we redeemed at such a
rate, and by such a great and unspeakable price? Then we must pass the time of
our sojourning here in fear.

Here consider, The parts of this verse.
1. The benefit, Redemption. 2. From what, Their vain conversation; which is
set out by the Original of it, The tradition of their fathers. 3. The price
whereby purchased: which is set down, first Negatively; where is showed, what it
is not, no worldly thing, such as silver and gold, described by the nature and
quality, Corruptible things; then Affirmatively, where is showed, what it is,
namely, Blood, precious blood, The precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb
without blemish, and without spot.

Forasmuch as ye know,] Here note, Doct.
That

A man may know himself to be a redeemed one, A man may know himself redeemed.
he may know that there is no condemnation to him, and that he is translated
from Death to Life; 1 John 3. 14.
He may know, that he serves not sin as he was wont, but his heart is to serve
the Lord, and that he walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit.

And does a man know himself redeemed, Use.
he must pass his time in the fear of God, and therefore in vain do such boast
that they are redeemed, that live yet in their sins.

That ye were redeemed] Here note,

1. That as Mercy presupposes Misery, Doctr.
so Redemption Bondage and Slavery; Redemption presupposes Bondage and Slavery.
neither is the bondage wherein we stand, such as of Pharaoh, or the Turks, but
Ten thousand times worse, even of Sin, and of the Devil; God indeed made us
free in Adam, Sin nor Satan had nothing to do with us, but we all sinning in
Adam, became subject not only to the Wrath and Curse of God, the first and
second death, and the forerunners of both, but to sin also, and so by nature we
can do nothing but sin, we drink sin, as a thirsty man does water; Its as
natural to us, as for the fire to burn: So fast is our will bound to the will
of the Devil, that for our lives we cannot think a good thought. Now as all
bondage is abhort'd of the nature of man, so the baser person one is in bondage
too, the more odious it is to them that see it, and the more tedious to
themselves that bear it: Now none so base in the world, as sin and the Devil,
the woeful enemies of God and our souls.

This should humble us all, Use.
being in this woeful case, and so would it do if we could be brought to believe
it: John 8. 33.
But (as the Jews) we think we were never in bondage to any, and finding our
bodies at liberty, conceive so of our souls, whereas both be in a spiritual
bondage unto evil: Nay, such is our woeful bondage, as we cannot believe we are
in it, nor can desire to come out of it, but naturally we love and desire it,
and thereupon are enemies to the means of our freedom: most think that if they
may have their lusts satisfied and fetch their flings in all manner of evil,
some of pleasure, some of their unconscionable dealing, etc. O its a little
Heaven! O such Towns and Houses where they may thus have their wills, are the
only places! but for the Towns and Services where they may not thus lash out,
but are restrained, and must be brought to the Word, Prayer, Reading,
Repetition, Catechizing, and the like, O fie upon it, say they, Here Is a
Bondage, a Slavery, who would be tied thus? If my year be our once, I Will lay a
stone there, etc. This is a hard saying, who can bear it? Let us break their
bands, and cast their coards from us: If this Preaching be suffered, we shall
do nothing shortly, we shall not be merry, we shall have our hands bound
behind us: Thus counting Gods service, which is perfect Freedom, to be
Bondage, they hold their woeful Slavery to be the only Liberty, and therefore
are not only willing so to continue, but are against the means of their
Delivery, which is a great depth of bondage: for let one be a slave to the
Turks never so though his body be bound, yet his mind is free, he retains an
earnest desire to be set at liberty: well, men must see it, and feel it, else
they shall never be delivered, and if they dye in this case, they must have
their wages according to the work.

2. That there is a way out of this bondage, Doct.
for our parts we could find none, There Is a way whereby to come out of our
bondage.
we could desire none; nay, God of his infinite mercy having found it out, and
prepared it, we have no desire of it: This indeed is a great and wonderful
mercy; He might have been glorified in our confusion, and has provided no
remedy for the evil Angels, as he has for us. It follows hereupon,

1. Seeing there is away of Redemption, Use 1.
that all that know not themselves delivered, must give all diligence, that
they may have their part in it: Believe Gods Word that thou art now in Bondage,
but abide not in it, seeing there is a way-out: will any of the Turks Slaves
stay in Prison, if the door be set open, and liberty offered and proclaimed?
Luke 4. 18.
Christ was sent to proclaim liberty to Captives, and so does: Do this the
rather, for the redeemeth not all, most shall bear their own burden: He prayed
not for the world; All mine are thine, John 17. 10.
says he to his Father, thine by Election, mine by Redemption.

But is not he the propitiation for the sins of the whole world? Object.


This is to be understood of all Believers, 1 John 2. 2.
of all Nations through the world, Sol.
in this last age since Christ.

2. That they which know themselves delivered from so great Thraldom, Use 2.
both of Death and Damnation, and of Sin also, must now serve God, and that
under the hope of eternal Life: They must study how to show their thankfulness
in all dutiful obedience all the days of their life; If any were ransomed from
the Turk, does he not count himself his that has ransomed him? so should we:
As we have yielded our members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, Romans
6. 13.
so must we now yield them as instruments of righteousness unto God: We have
taken great pains for the world and vanity, forgot our meat and sleep, thought
the time short, feared ever we should come too late, have pleaded for Baal: O
lets now do so for goodness, we have spent our substance on lewd persons, and
to follow our lusts, now let us spend it in the service of God, and on Gods
Children! O lets not serve the Devil and sin in any point more forwardly then
God! we must glorify God in Body and Spirit; 1 Cor. 6. 20.
we must have neither Heart, Tongue, Wit, Will, Eye, Ear, but for the Lord, and
all to be at his command: O that we would often think of our Redemption, both
from whence and to what! This would make us gather up our feet in our Masters
service more roundly, and call home our ranging Wits, Wills, and parts from
following our Lusts, to yield better obedience to God.

From your vain conversation,] Here whence, and from what they were delivered
vain, Iam. 2. 20.
that is, empty, fruitless, unprofitable, as, But will thou know, Psalm. 33. 17.
O vain man (O thou empty Cask) that Faith without Works is dead? And an Horse
is a vain help: Such was the conversation of the Jews, both their worshipping
of God, and the rest of their lives; It was empty, and therein was no
substance, as a blown bladder, that made a great show, but had no substance
therein, which was also unprofitable unto them, even their conversation, I say,
was vain, who were the people of God by name, and his Law, Word, and Worship
amongst them. Whence note, that

Till a man be converted to God, Doctr.
and the work of Regeneration wrought in him, The whole life of an unregenerate
person is vain.
his whole life is vain: None of his actions either please God, or profit
himself; for till a man's person please God, his works cannot.

Be a man an Hundred years old, and not born again, the time is yet to come
that ever he thought, spoke, or did that which pleased God, or shall do himself
any pleasure.

Therefore it concerns every man to try in what state he stands, Use.
and to labor to prove himself a person reconciled to God, and converted.

Received by Tradition from your Fathers. Obs.
] He turns not off the fault wholly from the Children to the Parents, Children
readily follow the evil example of their Parents.
but shows that their Parents giving a bad example, they by their sinful nature
were as ready to follow it; to follow their Parents, I say, which were corrupt
both in their Lives, and the worship of God: Concerning the corruption of their
Fathers, its to be understood, not of all, for God had his among them: Abraham
was a true worshipper of God, and a sincere man in his conversation, Genesis 18.
18.
and so taught he his Family, and lost not his labor: So Isaac, Jacob, Moses,
Joshua, and the Prophets; In this respect the Apostle said, Acts 24. 14.
I worship the God of my Fathers.

But more generally of the whole body of the Jews, Whom we are here to
understand by Fathers.
which was shamefully corrupted in all things: Hereupon what a stir had the
Prophets continually with them for their idolatry, and corrupting of Gods
worship in the first Table, and their unrighteousness toward men against the
second: Mat. 15. 4, 5, 6, etc. and 23. 23.
Afterward it was worse with them, They corrupted the true and sound
interpretation of the Law; They were full of Hypocrisy and Ostentation, and
would set up their own Traditions, and make them equal with the Word of God;
Mat. 15. 9.
They taught for Doctrine (even things necessary to Salvation, and parts of
Gods worship) the commandments of men: Therefore they did often quarrel with
our Saviors Disciples, sometimes for eating with unwashen hands, as at other
times, for not fasting, for plucking of ears of Corn on the Sabbath Day, etc.
Yea, they were so wicked, as they would set up their own Traditions, to the
casting down of Gods Commandments, and so set themselves above God: Mat. 15. 4,
5, 6.
the former was fearful, but this horribly blasphemous, as by their Corban they
set a Son free from any duty to his Parents: Shall not God be master of his own
Worship? has he not left his Word for a light and a rule, 2 Timothy 3. 16, 17.
and that most sufficient? must there be any thing added hereunto?

If any say, 1 Samuel 15. 22.
they did these things of a good mind, let him know, that to obey is better
then sacrifice, and to hearken, then the fat of Rams; let such call to mind
Gods justice against Nadab and Abihu: Lev. 10. 1, 2.
There were the same Incense, the same Censers that should be offered in the
same place by the right persons, only they took strange fire, which yet could
burn well: shall man make himself wiser then his maker?

This condemns the Papists, Popish Religion stands in patches.
for they are nothing but inventions; almost their whole Religion stands in
patches: How have they defiled Gods Ordinances with their wicked inventions?
Baptism with Salt, Cream, Spittle, Oil, Crossing, etc? How the Supper of the
Lord, by taking away the breaking of the Bread, using gay whole round Cakes,
the Priests forsooth for holiness, putting the same in the peoples mouths?
(with their polluted hands they must not touch it) as if their mouths being
clean, their hands could be unclean? How by keeping away the Cup altogether?
how by taking away that plain apparel which Christ and his Disciples used, and
bringing in costly apparel, like that of Aaron, fitter for an Emperor? Not to
speak of their Altars, Music, Elevation, Censing, Reservation, Fastings, Vows,
Pilgrimages, set numbers and stints of Prayers, and that upon Beads, their
Penances, Indulgences, etc. one devised one thing, another another thing, those
that came after not being willing to be behind herein them that went before:
Thus ceased they not, till they had filled all with trash; and then lest they
should be loathed and laughed at, they began to urge them more stiffly, and
enjoin them under pain of great sin to be obeyed.

They also prefer their own Traditions before Gods Commandments: Usually they
count it more heinous to work on an Holy Day, or Saints-day of their own
devising, then on the Lord's Day: So to eat a bit of flesh on Friday, then to
commit whoredom all the days of the Week: So to speak against any of their
toys, when to swear or take Gods Name in vain; The one is punished more
severely, the other not regarded.

Here may be also noted, That

Parents had need give their Children good example, Doct.
and take heed of the contrary, Parents must give their children good example.
which they will readily enough follow: The Parents actions be Copies for their
Children, their examples Precepts, their Precepts Oracles, to evil especially,
whither their nature is prone: See 2 Kings 17. 41.
David would wal'k wisely, in a perfect way, in the midst of his house; 2 Chro.
22. 3.
so must Parents, for in vain do they counsel their Children, if their own
example be not answerable. Psalm. 101. 2.


1. This condemns them that are most cruel examples to their Children, Use. 1.
of Swearing, Lying, Stealing, and all Wickedness, and Cursed speaking, so of
profaning the Lord's Day, railing on Gods Servants, raging in their Houses,
etc. They chalk them the way to destruction, and therefore will be guilty of it.

2. Parents must be careful, Use 2.
not only not to be examples of evil unto their Families, but examples of much
good; that so their Children may imitate their reverence of Gods Majesty, and
his worship, their attendance on the Word upon all occasions, their
conscionable care of the Sabbath, with their daily use and exercise of
Religious duties.

Further, in that they be rebuked for thus learning of their Fathers, learn,
that

Its no good rule for us to follow the examples of our Ancestors: Doctr.
The Word of God is the rule, To follow the examples of our Ancestors is no
sure rule.
whereby we must live; the other being indeed a Leaden rule: So far are we to
follow them, as they follow Christ: Yet are not we to reject a thing simply,
because it was done thus long ago, or done by the Fathers in the old time, but
rather being good and warrantable we are to follow it, because Antiquity has
reverence joined with truth; yet we must not follow a thing simply, because
ancient; evil is almost as ancient in the world, as good, better a new truth
(that is, truth newly revealed) then an old error.

This condemns the Papists, Use.
most of them have no other reason for their Religion, but, Thus did our
Forefathers; So long, and so long it has been, and shall we be wiser then
they; My Father, and my Grandfather (God rest their souls) they did thus, etc.
a poor blind rule: They walked in darkness, and so went out of the way, will
you do so that have the light? Its no more a rule for Doctrine or Manners to
say, Thus did our Forefathers, they were of this mind, and why am not I so to
be? then if any should Swear, Rail, Lie, Curse, and say, I do but as I heard
and saw my Father do; will this go for payment, trow ye?

Not with corruptible things, as silver and gold,] The things whereby we are
not Redeemed, are silver and gold; These he names in stead of all other worldly
things, Pro. 10. 19.
as which answer all, and by them Houses, Lands, yea, the most costly things,
and most precious Pearls are bought.

By these men may be ransomed and redeemed out of bodily Thraldom, Doct.
but all the silver and gold in the world is insufficient to redeem even one
man out of his Spiritual bondage: The things of this world are insufficient to
redeem any out of his spiritual bondage.
See Mat. 16. 26.

The Reasons hereof may be these,

1. God has no need of any of these things, and they are his already: Reas. 1.
The earth is the Lords, and the fullness thereof; The gold of Ophir and
Havilah, Psalm. 24. 1.
as are the beasts on a thousand mountains. Psalm. 50. 10.


2. Our soul is an immortal and incorruptible being, Reas. 2.
a Creature that had a beginning, but never shall have end: Now gold and silver
are things corruptible and vanishing, therefore are not of worth or value to
redeem or countervail the soul; for there must be some proportion between the
thing bought and the price given, so is there not between the world, and the
soul of a man; one soul is more excellent then the whole world.

3. Sin is a transgression against an Infinite God, Reas. 3.
and so deserves an infinite punishment, a death, and that eternal and
infinite: now a death must be paid, Gods justice has set it down, no such
price therefore will be taken, neither are these things infinite, all the world
is not.

4. Many times even for a Trespass committed against men, Reas. 4.
these things will not be taken for a recompense. Prove. 6. 35.


5. These often, Reas. 5.
when God sends some bodily judgment, are unable to do men any pleasure, Pro.
11. 4.
nor can at all pacify God. Ezekiel. 7. 19.


6. These cannot redeem a man's bodily life, Zeph. 1. 18.
and save it from death (for many would give much to procure that) nor can they
prolong a man's (ones own brothers) life an hour beyond his appointed time,
Reas. 6.
much less can they redeem his soul. Psalm. 49. 7.


7. These cannot purchase Wit, Reas. 7.
Learning, Eloquence for those that want them, much less Sanctification and
Grace; as also if a man were born Blind, Lame, Deformed, they cannot purchase
Sight, Strength or Beauty.

1. This condemns those gross Absurdities, Use 1.
nay, Blasphemies of the Church of Rome, they by Pardons and Indulgences, sold
for Money, take upon them to forgive sins; yea, they give those to houses of
Gentlemen, for many years to come, persuading also, that by their Masses (which
they must purchase with their Money) they shall be freed from Purgatory, and
sent to Heaven: Among them, belike the rich are in a good case, they may sin
freely, but the poor are in an hard taking: O cursed Blasphemy! None can
forgive sins but God only; yea, whereas all the Silver and Gold of the world
cannot satisfy for one sin, yet will they set it at such and such a rate of
Money: It may be said to them, as Peter said to Simon Magus, Your Money perish
with you, Acts 8. 20.
because you think that the gift of God (such a special gift as is the
Remission of sins) may be bought with Money.

2. We must learn by any means not to hazard or sell our souls for Silver or
Gold, Use 2.
not for the whole world: If a man should sell his soul for the whole world,
would the same price redeem it again? no, not if there were ten thousand
worlds: Then is it a very hard bargain to sell any commodity at such a rate, as
a man would give a thousand times as much for it again, and yet must go without
it; what shall I say of the common sort, which so basely esteem of their souls,
that they sell them away to destruction for toys of this world: How many sell
themselves to hell, some by Robbery, Bribery, Oppression, Simony, Sacrilege,
Cousenage, Lying, Swearing, etc. others for a bare living and maintenance? O
poor woeful Creatures! They know not what they do: They are like young Heirs,
that know not the worth of their Inheritance, and so part with all to some
couzening companion for a Horse, Dog, or Hawk, nothing to the true worth of it,
and then fret to think that they had such a living whereby they might have
lived in good fashion all their life, and now its gone, and they have nothing,
but like profane Esau's have lost their birthright: O if men knew the worth
of their souls, they would then despise the whole world if it were offered for
them, Mat. 4. 9, 10.
but an Omnia Dabo pulls most of the world upon their knees to worship the
Devil: Many Shopkeepers say, they would not give their lying for Forty pounds a
year; but poor blind Creatures, young Heirs, if they gate Forty thousand pounds
a year, they were great losers, for if they would give it, and as much more to
it, it would not recover their souls again from Damnation thereby deserved; Oh,
the soul lives for ever, and sin casts it into everlasting Woe and Torment: And
for enjoying a few short pleasures of sin, Heb. 11. 25.
shall we throw our selves into everlasting torment? Moses would not thus do,
but left Pharoahs court and the delights thereof, which he could not hold
without sin: O lets be wise at last, and royally set such a price on our souls,
as if the Devil would say as he did to Christ, All this will I give thee, we
may tell him he bids like an higler, and if he would give us seven worlds, Use
3.
we would not part with our Souls.

3. We wust be more afraid of sin, then of any thing else, seeing the price is
so great that must satisfy for it, even more then the loss of all that we
have: If we should commit sin to save all we have, we lose; But how little
account do men make of sin, whereas nothing but Christ's blood can satisfy for
it? If we were set to pay Twenty shillings for every sin we commit, how shie
would we be? but considering that the very greatest sum can neither take it
away, nor pay for it, we ought to be the more careful; but, O Lord, men commit
sin as if an half penny would satisfy for it, nay, a straw under their feet:
Thus do many rap out oaths, others talk ribaldry, others lie, others rail,
curse, backbite, etc. The devil thinks, nay he knows he does us a greater
spite to make us sin, Job 1. 11.
then to pluck away all that we have; see this in his dealing with Job, he
desired to spoil him of his goods, Why? because he hoped thereby to bring him
to blaspheme God; and its true, he does us more mischief by bringing us to
commit one sin, then by stripping us of all the estate we have: O do not that,
which when done, Doctr.
all the world cannot make amends for.

But what are these things? The things of this world are corruptible, vain and
uncertain.
what is their nature and quality? they are corruptible things, vain, uncertain,
of no continuance; fire consumes houses, water wares, death cattle, land is
subject to barrenness, to bad titles, wranglings, enemies, all these outward
things, sick of a consumption: They may hold out for a time, but at length
perish; nay, our selves and our own lives as frail as any thing, 2 Pet. 3. 10.
a bubble, a shadow, a vapor (as we heard larely) yea, Use 1.
the very heavens shall pass away.

1. Therefore be not proud of these things, alas, they be gifts of Gods left
hand, Pro. 23. 5.
common to the bad and good, also they have eagles wings, 1 Timothy 6. 17.
and are uncertain: And yet how do these things lift up men's minds, and make
them contemn their brethren? and so lordly, that they are not fit to be spoke
too, froward, contentious, etc. there is little cause they should so do, but
rather make them the more humble, for the more a man has, the greater account
he is to make: If of any thing, be proud of grace (yet not of that) and disdain
not a poor Christian; James 2. 5.
for though he have no wealth, yet if he have more grace then thou have, he is
the better man, I mean in the sight of God, who therefore is not to be
contemned for his poverty.

2. Trust not in them, Use 2.
let them not be thy strong city; hereof Job particularly acquits himself, 1 Timothy 6. 17.
and so should we. Prove. 10. 15.


3. Esteem of riches accordingly, Job 31. 24.
and seek them in their place: To this purpose peruse Matthew. 6. 19, 20, 33. Use
3.
John 2. 15, 16, 17, and 6. 27.

4. This condemns the common sort, Use 4.
that seek after nothing else, as if there were no other heaven, nor other end
of man's being here: Multitudes seek after them by right and wrong, yea, the
most unlawful and vile courses: Others not so openly evil, yet so seek these
things, as regarding them more then that one thing that is needful, being so
addicted hereto, that in the whole day they cannot spare one quarter of an hour
for prayer in their family; so in the whole week no leisure to break off and
hear a Sermon, nay, Sabbath and all, only coming to Church (and some scarcely
that) but will lose as little time as they can, for they will talk of the world
till they come to the Church door, and in many places in the very Church, and
as soon as they are out again, to it again: With them every little time for God
and the Soul is too much, no time for the world enough; every small measure of
knowledge, a shadow of any thing in that kind is much, but much of the world
seems yet small: Mammon is much beholding to them, God and their Soul but a
little; therein they are wise, and have tongue enough in such things, none at
all in heavenly matters, and so they bring up their children, and so match
them: Thus they set the cart before the horse, and speed in their souls
accordingly; yet is one dram of Faith Repentance, Knowledge, worth all the
silver and gold in the world. Yea, its not only the fault of the common sort,
that they see no better things, but even of Gods children, that have the
substance, and yet will be catching at the shadow; so did not Abraham, Isaac
and Jacob, they dwelt in Tents, and counted themselves Pilgrims, neither
regarded Moses the pleasures of Egypt.

But with the precious blood of Christ] Here Is the true price of our
Redemption: Doctr.
Its true, Christ's blood the true price of man's Redemption.
we are redeemed by the whole course of Christ's obedience, which he performed
from his birth to his death; but its ascribed here particularly to his death
and suffering, being the principal part of his obedience, Romans 5. 19.
whereby he satisfied Gods justice for our sins (by his blood, Phil. 2. 8.
is here meant, all his sufferings from his beginning, and that not only
visible from men in his body, but the inward terrors of God upon his Soul, yea
and death it self) and no less payment would serve the turn for us, for by our
sin we had deserved death of body and Soul, the first and second: Therefore
blood must be shed, death must be paid, else Gods justice cannot be satisfied;
well, be it so, Would not then the death of some Saints have done the turn? All
men are inwrapped in one and the same Condemnation, unable to help themselves,
much less others: Neither could the very Angels help us, for having sinned
against an infinite God, we deserved an infinite punishment, which being
finite, we could never overcome; therefore it must be blood of Jesus Christ,
his that was both man, that he might suffer, and as man's nature had offended,
therein give satisfaction; and God, that he might make his sufferings of
infinite worth and value, and that he might overcome the same; therefore it is
called Precious, by reason of the hypostatical union of the Divine Nature
therewith, and so was the blood of that man that was God, and so after a sort,
the blood of God: Hence he is called The Lord of life and glory, Acts 3. 15.
and 20. 28.
and said to have purchased the Church with his blood. No less would have
served the turn, so precious is the work of our Redemption, and our estate
before so miserably woeful: Isa. 53. 5.
This was plainly prophesied, Acts 4. 12.
Other way of Redemption there was none in the world, Rev. 13. 8.
neither is there Salvation in any other: He is the Lamb of God slain from the
foundation of the world; Heb. 13. 8. and 10. 14.
He is the same yesterday and to day, See Romans 3. 25.
and for ever: This was signified by the Sacrifices of the old Law, Ephesians. 1. 7.
which were types hereof; and this indeed is an All-sufficient way: 1 Pet. 2.
24.
He is the surety that has paid our debt, satisfied the creditor, and freed
us, 1 John 1. 7.
by whom we are discharged from all the wrath of God that we had deserved. Rev.
1. 5.


But how could he in so short a time dispatch that which was infinite, Object.
and we should have lien under for ever?

Because he was God. Sol.
It was more that he should suffer for a moment, then all men and Angels for
ever: As a rich man is able to pay that debt in an instant, that a poor man can
never be able to wind out of; so did he that quickly, which we could never
have done: Therefore let every man trust to this; if this be not a sufficient
way, thou may say, I am content to perish; thou may well enough, and I
with thee for company.

1. This confounds all other false and devised satisfactions by any other,
Use 1.
and shows the most fearful state of all that know not nor embrace Christ; as
1. The Jews that look for another Christ: 2. The Turks that trust in Mahomet,
and do not acknowledge Christ; so the Pagans that are utterly ignorant of him:
The Papists also that make him but half a Savior, and add a number of other
Merits and Satisfactions, with their blasphemous Idol of the Mass, their
Pilgrimages, Penances, etc. yea, not only say they are the sufferings of the
Saints, meritorious for themselves, but even to put something into the common
treasury to help others: These also among our selves that hope to be saved by
their good meaning, good prayers, and civil life, and either do not at all look
to Christ, or but to halves, being as good as not at all; So those that make
God an Idol, all of mercy, and no justice, when as they are both essentially in
him, and he could not be God without both, and the one is infinite in him as
the other; yet by crying God mercy, they think to escape, never considering how
his justice should be answered; but he should not be just, nor God, if he
should let thy sins go unpunished.

2. This shows the fearfulness of sin, Use 2.
such was our case that (as if one had committed a fault, and there were no way
to escape, unless he could obtain the Kings son to dye for him) we could not but
perish, unless the Son of God had dyed for us.

3. This should much grieve and humble us, Use 3.
to think what our sins have done, even that they occasioned all the torment
our Savior was put to: It was not Judas nor the Jews, Pilate nor the Soldiers
that crucified Christ, but our sins, they being but our servants and
executioners; How should this go to our hearts, that our lying, swearing,
whoredom, pride, profaneness, etc. was the cause that put our Savior to all
those indignities: Shall he be pierced, yea to the very heart, for our sins,
and shall not we be pierced with grief for our own sins? Shall he shed Tears of
Blood, and shall we have dry eyes? Shall he say, his soul is heavy to the
death, and shall not our hearts be heavy? could we having a friend that loved
us so dearly as he would take our room, to endure much for us; could we I say,
stand by, and see him tortured for our cause, and look on it with dry eyes?

4. This should make us take heed of sin for the time to come, Use 4.
and avoid it above all things in the world, look upon every sin in blood; no
sin but has a bloody face, when we have committed it, all the world cannot
satisfy for it, it must be blood, the blood of the Son of God; one drop of
which was of more worth then Ten thousand worlds: if it were but the blood of a
man must be shed for every sin were it not fearful? but its Christ Blood,
therefore how careful should we be? But, O Lord, How small account is made of
sin! How does the world make a May Game thereof? How do men think they can
appease Gods Wrath with a broken sigh, or a Lord have mercy upon us, for we are
all Sinners, or by making some counterfeit show in their sickness, or on their
deathbed? And do not the Papists think that it may be done away by auricular
Confession, Penance, Pilgrimages, Holy Water, Popes Pardons, the saying over of
so many Ave-maries, Paternosters, etc. But those that set so light by sin, are
such as never knew the weight of it, nor have part in the remedy; and therefore
in vain do such say, they hope to be saved by Jesus Christ, and he dyed, and
shed his Blood for their sins, and yet they still live in sin: What is this but
to make a light account of Christ's blood? Heb. 10. 29.
a treading of it under foot? an accounting of it an unholy thing? a despiting
of the Spirit of grace? Yea, if even Gods Children did so weigh this
unspeakable price as they should, they would be more afraid to offend then they
are: This also should awaken those that know no part in their Redemption, that
they have the greatest matter in the world to seek; Such should never be quiet,
till they find themselves discharged, for without this, there is nothing but
eternal destruction, they shall bear their own burden.

5. This sets out the unspeakable love of God and Jesus Christ, Use 5.
that when we had plunged our selves into this miserable estate, and could not
only not help our selves out, but not so much as devise a way out, that he did
both find out the way, and was content to bestow his Son on us, to suffer the
curse and death that we had deserved, Simile.
that so we might be freed: What man would beat his Son, to spare his Servant?
What man would kill his Son, to save his Enemy? What Prince would give his
only Son and Heir for a base Subject, nay, to redeem a Traitor? and that not
to bondage, but to death? John 3. 16.
yet all this has the Lord done; God so loved the world: O wonderful, that the
Father did not rather suffer all the world to perish, then that his most
blessed Son should suffer the least of those indignities that he endured! And
was not the love of Christ infinite, that for us gave himself, and did
willingly lay down his life for us, which could do nothing to deserve or
requite it, nay, which were his very enemies? so to endure such base and cruel
dealing from men, who himself was Lord of the world, and could have commanded
the earth to swallow them, so to be spitted on, mocked, scourged, nailed to the
cross, etc. but above all, that he would undergo his Fathers displeasures for
us Rake-hells that had so provoked him.

6. And what does this call for at our hands again, Use 6.
but admiring at the infiniteness of the price, we study all our life how to
walk thankfully before him, giving our Bodies, Souls, Lives and Labors to him
again most zealously, faithfully serving him in all obedience, yea if he should
call us to lay down our lives for his Names sake, to do it cheerfully, as he
did for us: we are not our own, but the Lords who has bought us, and paid
dearly for us, and so must have neither Wit nor Will, 1 Cor. 6. 2^.
Body nor Soul, Hand nor Foot, but for him, and which we are to employ in his
service. If one should redeem us with a great sum of Money, Simile.
we would ever be thankful, and count our selves his; if one should give all
his Substance, more; if one should give himself to serve and be bond for us,
yet more; but to lay down his life for us, a Superior for inferiors, yea for
enemies most of all; so far and all this has Christ done for us, How then
should this dissolve and break our hearts to love, and cause us out of love to
serve him? O woeful dullness in us and unthankfulness, that can say, We have part
in such a Redemption, from such a misery to such a glory, and by such a price,
and yet can be ready to think every thing too much for him! How dull are we,
and slow to do his service, in hearing the Word, Prayer, and other duties? How
quickly are we weary of well doing? How think we every little time too much for
him, that thought not his pains, his abasement, nay his life and heart-blood
too much for us? When we have him asking us in his poor members some small
refreshing, how hardly and sparingly (if at all) does it come from us? nay, we
will not part with our lusts and sinful affections at his request: Will we give
our lives for him, and not our lusts? how shall we ever martyr our bodies for
him, that will not martyr our affections of Pride, Envy, Covetousness, unlawful
pleasure in gaming, etc. O shall we grieve him that has done so wonderful
things for us? It was grief enough to him that he suffered already, though we
grieve him not again by our unthankfulness: O that we would labor to gratify
him by all means possible: To this end do we often meditate of this price, come
we often to the Sacrament, there may we see it, there eat and drink it worthily,
there sprinkle it upon our Souls, and apply it to our selves, that so an edge
may be set upon our care and zeal.

7. In vain do they lay claim to the blood of Christ, Use 7.
that yet live in their lust; O impudent faces and liars that they are!

As of a Lamb without blemish and without spot.] In what respects Christ is
compared to a Lamb.
Here Christ is further described by his innocence and purity, compared
therefore to a Lamb; Where allusion is made to the Lamb in the Old Testament,
used in the Sacrifices, and the Paschal Lamb, which as it signified their own
guiltiness and danger; so yet that there was help (not by their blood, but) by
the Sacrifice and satisfaction of another that was signified hereby, John 1. 29.
namely, Christ, who is termed, The Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the
world: The Paschal Lamb was to be a Male without blemish, of a year old, a pure
and perfect one, signifying the Purity, Perfection and Innocence of Christ
Jesus; so he is called a Lamb, Isa. 53 7.
to show his willingness and patience in suffering both from God and men.

Our Savior Christ was innocent indeed, Isa. 53. 9.
no guile found in his mouth; he was most pure and perfect in his birth, for he
was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and so freed from the least touch and
contagion of Original sin, which was in the Virgin his Mother; as also that
matter of his body was filled with all holiness that it was capable of, and
likewise immediately from the first moment of the conception, united unto one
person with the Godhead, the second person in Trinity: He was so in his life,
John 8. 46.
Who could accuse him of sin? Mat. 27. 4, 24.
so also in his death, for he that betrayed confessed the same, and his Judge
two or three times so pronounced him; Luke 23. 41.
one of the thieves also that were condemned with him, gave the like testimony
of him: and it was necessary he should be innocent, See Heb. 7. 26, 27.
else he could be no Mediator for us, he himself had needed a Savior.

But how could it stand with Gods Justice to punish an innocent? Object.


He being sufficient to pay our Debt, Sol.
offered himself our Surety to his Father, Isa. 53. 6.
who therefore could not refuse him, but imputing to him our sins, 2 Cor. 5. 21.
laid the punishment thereby deserved on him.

1. This sets out his love so much the more, Use 1.
that being innocent, would suffer for us wicked wretches.

2. This teaches us to imitate him, Use 2.
and in all things to be innocent as he was (for this cause are we thrice
termed Sheep and Lambs in our Saviors charge to Peter) we must walk holy in the
duties of the first Table toward God, John 21. 15, 16, 17.
and righteously in the duties of the second toward our brethren; Ephesians. 5. 15.
we must walk so exactly, that we may not justly be blamed: Job 31. 35, 36.
Be we as Job, as Zachary and Elizabeth, and as Daniel, whose enemies could
find no fault in him in respect of his outward conversation, Luke 1. 6.
and therefore were fain to take another course to entrap him: Dan. 6. 5.
Samuel could say, 1 Samuel 12. 3.
Whose Ox have I taken, etc. and though we cannot say with our Savior Christ,
Who can accuse me of sin? being privy to our selves of so many corruptions and
infirmities as the best of us are; yet that we may truly say, Who can accuse me
of this or that gross sin? or of any infirmity that I know by my self, and both
mourn not for and strive against? O its a shame that Christians should hurt
others in their goods, in their names, that they should revile, censure,
backbite, etc. consider that there are many eyes upon us, Gods, his Angels, the
Devils, both good and bad men's.

3. In that Christ being so innocent, Use 3.
was yet willing to suffer and offer his blood, let us imitate him in this
also; let us be patient in bearing troubles and persecution; we must suffer for
his sake (though causlesly) cheerfully and willingly, being called hereto; for
its our honor, and we must reign with him. To suffer with Christ has these
things in it, Romans 8. 17.
To suffer as a Member of him; To suffer for his cause, and to suffer willingly
as he did; we must also suffer patiently such afflictions as are of Gods
immediate sending, as in like manner injuries and wrongs from men, against
frowardness, hastiness, and revenge: Use we meekness and patience, Mat. 18. 15,
21.
these we must follow.

If Christ were thus innocent, Object.
how comes it to pass that he was called a Samaritan, a friend of Publicans and
Sinners, a glutton, a wine-bibber, an enemy to Caesar, and Barabbas preferred
before him?

He might be, Sol.
and was innocent for all this: The holy Ghost says not, he was never ill
spoken of, for the Devil and his instruments will speak ill of the best persons
and things, yea, of goodness it self.

Learn we then not to listen to nor believe all we hear; Obser.
even Elijah will be accused for a troubler of Israel, We are not to listen to,
either believe all we hear.
and the young Prophet called a mad fellow, and that Micaiah never prophesied
good, and that Jeremiah raves, and its not meet that he should live, Paul a
pestilent fellow, Ier. 26. 20.
and a mover of sedition, and now adays, the true servants of God, good
Christians, Acts 24. 5.
called of some Heretics, of others Puritans, Factious, Proud, Singular,
Shismaticks, worse then Papists, etc. And may they not be the good servants of
God for all this? You shall have Elimas's ready to buz in young Gentlemen's and
ignorant persons ears, that begin to set on to Religion, O these Puritans are
the vilest persons in the world, even as the name of Hugenot in France was
enough to help one to his death! But let such take heed, believe not all, its
malice speaks: So take heed we believe not all we hear of particular Ministers,
and Christians, some slandred one way, some another: Is this a new trick, or
rather is it not the old course of Satan to raise up such things to hinder men,
if he could, from profiting by their Ministers, or set men off from the
profession of Religion? Its more to be wondered that he raises not up ten to
one; therefore never condemn them in your hearts, till you have tried them: Do
them that equity, ere you believe it, ere you report it, ask and expect, if
they have so carried themselves as they have deserved to be well thought of
before: Is it not therefore a grievous thing, that even such as profess the
same truth, and that have also good things in them, hearing an ill report of
their Neighbor Christian, shall be too ready to believe it, and report it to
others; but I hope, says he, it is not true, and so he tells it to another,
and so it increases like a Snow-ball, who should rather have stopped it, when he
heard it first, and have used means to have come to the truth.

Verse 20. Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of tbe world, but
was manifest in these last times for you. Verse 21. Who by him do believe in
God that raised him up from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and
hope might be in God.
HE proceeds to speak of Christ, as of one of whom he cannot make an end of
speaking, and describes him, 1. By his Antiquity. 2. By the time of his taking
flesh, and the reason of it: He was foreordained before the foundation of the
world; there is his Antiquity: He was manifest in these last times for you;
there is both the time, and reason of his Manifestation. Those for whom he was
manifested he describes also, 1. By their Faith in God. 2. By the means whereby
they did attain thereto, namely Jesus Christ; where is showed, both why they did
for the time present, and might still also believe and hope in God; namely,
because he raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, both which were for
our good.

Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the world,] The
prevention of an Objection.
Here the Apostle prevents an Objection: He had said, they were redeemed from
their vain conversation, which they had received from their Fathers by Christ's
Blood: why then belike (might they have said) our Fathers lived and dyed in
their sins, and in their vain conversation, or else they had some other way of
being Redeemed and Sanctified, and so God had no Church in former times; yet
says the Apostle, God had his Church among the Forefathers, and such as were
Redeemed, Justified, and Sanctified, as well as we, and that also by no other
way then we; for Christ, though he came not in the Flesh till these last times,
yet he has been the Savior of the world from the beginning in Gods counsel,
and the effic^cy of his death and merit: So that first he answers what they
might have doubted of their Fathers, and then shows Christ's Antiquity, that
they might see he was not a new way devised of late, and that after Four
thousand years it came into Gods mind thus to redeem mankind: Oh, No, says
he, it was ordained before the world, and has been in force in all times: And
this he speaks the rather, because we are ready to suspect Novelty, neither can
we freely fasten our Faith upon any new devised way: He tells then, they may
freely rest upon him, as being the ancient way of Salvation.

But was manifest in these last times for you.] He adds these words to stir up
their hearts to more thankfulness and duty, who being so unworthy, should yet
have the vantage of all the Fathers: Christ was but promised to them, he was
performed to themselves: Now its worth much thanks to have a benefit promised
of God, who is so sure of his Word, and to us so unworthy, but then it deserves
much more thanks when the benefit is performed.

Who was foreordained,] Acts. 1. and 4.
(...) ordained before; The word signifies foreknown, as its elsewhere
rendered, to show that Gods foreknowledge is not idle, nor separate from his
Decree and Will, as some think.

Now that Christ was ordained before the World; Doctr.
he was he that was foretold by the Prophets, Christ was ordained before the
world.
signified by their Sacrifices, promised to Abraham, The seed in whom all the
nations of the world should be blessed; Genesis 12. 3. and 3. 15.
so to Adam, The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the Serpent; Rev.
13 8.
yea, he is termed, The Lamb slain from the foundation of the world; John 6. 27.
neither is this all, He was ordained before the world: Whatsoever God brings
to pass in time (as nothing, Ephesians. 1. 4.
nor the smallest or most casual thing but comes to pass by his Providence)
that he decreed beforetime; for nothing comes to pass without Gods knowledge
(for then were not he infinite in Wisdom) nor without his Will, for then were
not he infinite in Power.

How could this be, Object.
seeing there was no need of Christ till after the world was made, and man was
the last creature that was made, and that in innocence; Was the remedy ordained
before the malady?

The remedy was ordained before the misery; Sol.
was, but not before the misery was foreknown to be: Thus was the Lords order,
He before all time set down this to glorify himself: How? In the Salvation of
some of mankind, and condemnation of others: Well, how could he bring this to
pass? he decreed to make man male and female, and to make them holy; he decreed
also to leave them to themselves, that falling, he might make a way for the
glorifying of his mercy and justice, which if man had continued righteous, had
been stopped up; then he decreed to give his Son to redeem the vessels of mercy.
Now for his decreeing of Adams fall, let it not seem strange; he did not only
foresee, but decree it, yet so, as he is altogether free from any fault
thereof: God, Man and the Devil had all a hand in that action, yet man and the
Devil most guilty, and the Lord most free, as may appear partly by their
diverse ends that they aimed at, and partly by their manner of bringing it to
pass. Their ends; God aimed to glorify his mercy in saving some, and his
justice in condemning others; a good end: The Devils aim was to strip the Lord
of any creature on earth to serve him, and to overthrow all mankind: Adam and
Eve they listened to the Devil, counting God as it were a liar (that had
threatened them when there was nothing so) and envious of their good estate,
therefore thought without him to thrust themselves up into his seat, and make
themselves equal with him; two vile ends: for the manner also there are great
odds; God effects it thus, He makes man an holy and happy creature, gives him a
commandment to exercise his obedience, gives him power to obey, uses reasons
to have him take heed of breaking it, threatens death thereupon, only leaves
him to himself, and to the Devils temptations, yet sufficiently armed to resist
him, only follows him not with new grace, which he was not bound to do: Who
can find any fault in this? The Devil effects it by alluring and tempting them
to do that which God forbade, and that by his vile lies: Adam and Eve they
believe the Devil, and break the Commandment of their Creator: Who can herein
lay any thing to Gods charge, or have cause to complain? Has the Devil?
nothing done but what he persuaded to: Has Adam and Eve? nothing done but what
they voluntarily without any compulsion yielded unto: Have their Posterity?
Neither; for 1. The godly they are restored to a better condition in Christ,
then they lost in Adam. 2. The wicked they are never punished till they have
justly deserved it by their own sins; therefore its without cause to complain:
So is God just, Man and the Devil to be condemned.

What! Object.
shall they be blamed for doing the will of God, for doing that which he had
decreed?

They aimed at no such end, Sol.
but to fulfill their own lusts; therefore are they justly to be blamed.

1. This sets out the exceeding goodness and mercy of God, Use 1.
thus graciously to plot a remedy so soon, which no man could have done, God
like a Father did plot and forecast for us: If we had been left without a
remedy, or must have shifted for one, it had gone ill with us. Now as this
should make us love the Lord for his goodness and care, so what a comfort is
this to poor souls, that seeing their misery, desire above all the world to be
delivered out of the same; Shall these miss of it, if they seek it of God with
humble heart? If the Lord had this care of his Church ere it was, will he
suffer it to want any thing now, that is, if it seek it of him? Did the Lord
ordain a remedy before the world was? was he so careful? and now will he not
bestow this remedy on all that truly desire it? Will a Father be so provident
to lay up corn and necessaries into his house, before there be need of them;
and when need is, and the children call and cry for bread, will he deny it them?

2. This should marvellously provoke all to labor for their part in Christ: Use
2.
Was he foreordained of the Father, and did he come and suffer, and shall we
not lay out for him? O monstrous carelessness and unthankfulness! yet how few
seek him? how few seek him aright? Few seek him as a Savior, fewer as their
Lord and King, most so coldly as that they shall not obtain such a benefit as
this.

3. This shows, Use 3.
that as God ordained some to Salvation before the world, which was the cause
of ordaining Christ, so this was most free; Ioh. 3. 16.
for what could we do to move him before we were, before the world was? No, as
God sent his Son into the world of his mere mercy, so he ordained him of the
same.

4. If Christ were thus ordained, Use 4.
then he is no new Savior, but the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world,
Rev. 13. 8.
by whom all the Fathers have been saved; Ioh. 8. 56.
Abraham saw his day, and believed, therefore none needs doubt or fear to trust
in him: Rom 9. 33.
He that believes in him shall never be confounded, nor make haste. O that the
Jews and Turks would believe this! but they will one day be confounded with
shame, and make haste to seek another Savior, when their former shall fail them.

5. Lay for Christ, Use 5.
ere thou lay a foundation for the world, let him be first sought after: Mat.
6. 33.
Till we have Christ, Ioh. 6. 27.
neither our persons nor works please God, nor have we right to the things of
the world, nor any promise of blessing.

Before the foundation of the world,] Obs.
As the foundation of the world was laid, The world shall not always continue.
so it may and shall be unlaid, and pulled down, and that by him that laid it:
The time will come, when the Elements shall melt, etc. 2 Pet. 3. 10.
when the earth, with all the works therein shall be consumed with fire. As all
things here be frail, and of no continuance or certainty, but subject to many
alterations; so the world it self, that has worn out many generations of
people, it self shall have an end, already waxes old.

Trust not to it, Use.
it will deceive all that do; Its like a great round Bowl, whereon if a man
should offer to stand, it would roll away, and lay him under feet, if not break
his back: Too too many break themselves with the world, only Heaven lies
foursquare.

But was manifest] He is manifested three ways; Christ how manifested.
1. By the Word and Sacraments: 2. By his coming in the flesh: 3. By his last
coming to Judgment. Here the second is chiefly meant; for he was revealed in
all Ages to our Forefathers in the Word and Sacraments, Heb. 9. 26.
but yet not so evidently and clearly as in our times, in these last times,
wherein he was made manifest in the flesh.

Note here,

1. The constancy and unchangeableness of the Lord, Doctr.
who as he Ordained Christ before the world, God is constant and unchangeable.
so he sent him in due time into the world: The Lord is not as man, that he
should lie or repent, his purposes are unvariable, and his promises most
certain and sure; he wants no power to effect his Decrees and Purposes, No
length of time could make him alter or fail, neither the wretchedness of the
Age that he came in, which was woefully corrupt, when even they that bare the
Name of the Church were defiled in Judgment and Conversation, God
notwithstanding would accomplish his purpose: So it is with every one whom he
elected before the world, he will not lose one, but in time afford them
effectual means for Faith and Repentance; Acts 13. 48.
no length of time, no man's badness shall hinder this work. The Lord had
decreed to call and make his Covenant with Abraham, and yet what was he but a
blind Idolater till God called him? What also Paul, who notwithstanding was
ordained from his Mothers womb, nay, before the world, to be a special
instrument in the Church?

1. This may comfort godly Parents over their children that be yet uncalled,
Use. 1.
they may have hope they be in the compass of Gods election, and so that God
will one day have mercy on them: Oh, but they be thus and thus bad! Its
grievous indeed, but that shall not hinder, if they belong to Gods election:
Shall the wretchedness of man make the faith of God of none effect? nay, let
God be true, and every man a liar; wheresoever God has any elect ones, he will
find them out and remember them.

2. It teaches us also to be constant in all our good purposes; Use 2.
Hell is full of purposes, Acts 11. 29, 30
Heaven of performances: Psalm. 76. 11.
How many good purposes in sickness, after the Word, before the Sacrament, etc.
have we, which prove as blossoms without fruit?

2. The constancy of Gods promises they be Yea and Amen; Gods promises are
unchangeable.
no length of time can make him break a promise (as this of sending Christ into
the world) as neither the unworthiness of men: The Israelites as wretched as
might be, yet they could not make him break promise with Abraham to give them
Canaan; one would think he should cut them off in the midway, but he had
respect to his Name: This was the cause that Gods Servants were always glad of
a promise, Neh. 1. 9.
as Nehemiah. So are his threatenings, as that with Adam and Eve, though then
there were no more upon the earth: So even with our Lord Jesus himself, that
innocent Lamb of God, yet standing as our Surety, God spared him not, but
according to the threatening of death, gave him to dye; notwithstanding of his
prayers and strong cries, he abated nothing, but laid it on him to the
uttermost.

1. Here Is a comfort to Gods people, Use 1.
find out, apply, and hold fast the promises in all our necessities: Stand
upon them, on any one one of them, as upon an unmovable foundation; God cannot
fail, who ever trusted in him and was confounded? Happy is the man that
trusts in him.

2. Let the wicked know how small account soever they make now of the Lords
threatenings, Use 2.
they shall find them too true for them: And if the Lord Jesus, the innocent
Son of God, the Surety, found it, shall those horrible monsters, that shake off
all care of God and goodness, think to escape free, and find his Word loose?
No, though they bare themselves upon late repentance.

In these last times] Christ was not exhibited till after Four thousand years
of the world: Obser.
and why not before, Christ was then exhibit it when God decreed that he should
so be.
or all this while? because God decreed it to be no sooner: why decreed he it
to be no sooner? because he would not: If any go yet further, and ask why he
would not? this is Presumption, and curious Pride: we must not ask a reason
further then the will of God, where none is revealed, God determined (as we
shall see after) to bestow a greater privilege on the last age of the world,
then on the former, and who should question him for the same? This then was the
time which God in his counsel had appointed, Gal. 4. 4.
which is called by the Apostle, the fullness of time: when all time was run out
that was to be before, then he came; so that he could not possibly have comed
any sooner, nor tarried any longer: If we respect the Power of God simply, he
could have sent him sooner, but if Gods Decree, he could come no sooner; even
as Christ's bones could not be broken in respect of Gods Decree, though the
nature of them was as other men's, subject to be broken: Nor could Christ have
lived longer in the world in respect of Gods Decree, Doctr.
though he might by the course of nature and strength of body continued many
years. What God has decreed shall be in due time accomplished.


Note we then from hence, that

What God has decreed, as he will effect, so will he do in the due and
appointed time; Acts 16. 6, 7.
whomsoever he has chosen he will call, every one in their time, yet after
Peter writes to the Christians scattered in those places; what is this, but
that the time of their calling was not yet come, Mat. 10. 5.
which afterward was fulfilled? At the first sending out of the Apostles, Mat
28. 19.
they were forbid to go into the way of the Gentiles, but afterward (and that
upon the forementioned ground) bid to Preach to all Nations: Romans 11. 25.
So the Jews shall be called, but when? when the fullness of the Gentiles shall
be come in: Some were called into the Vineyard to work at one hour, some at
another.

1. This may teach us, Use 1.
being truly called, and our time come, highly to praise God.

2. And for those that yet be behind, Use 2.
be not out of hope, wait still, use the means, etc. and when God sends the
means, hope the time is coming: who knows whether God has not some Elect
among the Indians that he will send means unto, which they have hitherto
wanted, and so call them to the knowledge of Christ Jesus? The like may be said
of particular persons: But let none hence cast off care, and say my time is not
yet come wherein I shall be called, and so neglect the Word, and live badly,
but let such use the means with all speed, to day, while its called to day: The
longer any goes on uncalled, its the more dangerous sign of no Election of God.

3. Here see the reason why many a good Prayer and good Enterprise takes not
effect by and by, Use 3.
but the wicked prevail, even because the time is not yet come.

Further, Three differences of times.
observe three differences of times, Before the Law, Under the Law, and After
the Law, or after the manifestation of Christ: Why is this last called The last
times? Why this called the last time.
A. They be so in comparison of former times; and these from Christ onward, are
the next before the end of the world, when there shall be no more time.

God will never speak to his Church after any other manner; Obser.
he will make no new Covenant, God will no otherwise reveal his will, then he
has already done.
no new Gospel, Religion, manner of Worship, Sacraments, Faith, but has
revealed all his will to us in his Son Christ Jesus, he will never alter his
course; we have all that ever we may look for here on earth, Heb. 1. 1.
nothing can be more clear.

This condemns the Turks, Use.
which look for their Mahomet, and the Jews which look for I know not what
Messiah and Lordly Savior: The Papists also, being belike ashamed of what God
has revealed in his Gospel, patch together an infinite number of men's
inventions, so that their Religion is as a beggars cloak, full of pieces, of
diverse colors set on at diverse times.

These being termed the last times, Doctr.
because they be the immediate times before the Worlds end; We now live in the
latter end of the last times.
it follows, that having been so ever since the Apostles, we live in the
latter end of the last times.

1. Here Is comfort to Gods people, that the last day is so near, which
therefore they may wait for with patience. Use 1.


2. Terror to the wicked, Use 2.
that think it will not come, because deferred, and so many hundred years it
has been called the last time; but God is not slack, but patient for his
Elects sake that yet are behind: If it had come one hundred years ago, we had
been prevented, But a thousand years are but as one day with the Lord, and it
will surely come, and that too soon to the wicked, who shall feel the terror
thereof.

For you] The Reason of Christ's coming thus toward the end of the world, Why
Christ came toward the latter end of the world.
because God had appointed to do a greater favor to the last age, not but that
those which went before, both knew and saw Christ, as Abraham, though afar off;
So that here the Fathers are not excluded, but he was manifest for us, that we
might have a fuller sight of him then the fathers; their light was but dim in
comparison of ours.

How much then are we bound to God? Use.
and ought we not to have more knowledge and faith, and show more tokens of
thankfulness then they? But alas, though we have the Gospel and Sacraments so
clearly, never did iniquity more abound: Thus do we reward the Lord for his
kindeness.

Who by him do believe in God] He says, They believed, how came he to know
that? he hoped so, and in charity so judged of them, as who willingly gave
themselves to the profession of Christian Religion, and for the same did
undergo persecution: Therefore I say, he hoped the more confidently of them,
even as we may do of such Assemblies as these on the week days; What we are to
do, and how to carry our selves, that others may think well of us.
a man may hope better of them, then of those which come by commandment (as
others of Custom, not Conscience) especially considering the discouragements
they meet withal, and their constancy notwithstanding; A man cannot but think
they should come for Conscience, and expect better things at their hands then
others; which I desire you would be careful, to declare well at home in your
places and several dealings, not only to Gods glory, your own comfort, and
winning on of others, but stopping up the mouths of the worst, that are ready
to pry into, and speak all evil of the forwarder sort of professors.

By him] We cannot believe in God, Doctr.
but by the Son: For 1. The Father dwells in the light that none can attain
unto; We cannot believe in God, but by the Son.
How then shall we come to him of our selves, we being so poor and weak, and he
of so infinite Majesty? Reas. 1.
As in the Summer we cannot directly look upon the Sun shining in his full
strength, but may view it in a pail of Water; 2 Cor. 4. 4.
so must we see the Father in the Son, who is the image of the Father, Heb. 13.
and the engraven form of his person. 2. God is infinitely just, Reas. 2.
and we extremely wicked, he a consuming fire, and we stubble; How then can we
come to him, believe in him, or take comfort, but only in and by the Lord
Jesus our Mediator? who by his death has made satisfaction to his Father, John
14. 6.
and covered us with his righteousness: Ephesians. 3. 12.
He is the Way, the Truth and the Life, none comes to the Father but by him;
Heb. 10. 19
By him we have boldness and access with confidence: Its life eternal to know
the only true God, John 17. 3.
but how shall that be done? only by Jesus Christ: He therefore that would
believe in God, and have comfort thereupon, must first know and believe in
Christ Jesus, even know him to be for natures and offices as he is, God and
man, and believe in him as the only Savior who reconcileth us to the Father.

1. Therefore Jews and Turks believe not in God, Use 1.
because they believe not in Christ, and know him not.

2. All are Heretics that deny any of Christ's natures or offices, Use 2.
for we must believe him to be such as the Word declares him to be.

3. The Papists, Use 3.
which in effect deny his Humane Nature, by standing for Transubstantiation;
and his offices Priestly, by their Masses, Satisfactions, Joynt-intercessions;
his Prophetical, by their own Traditions; his Kingly, by making the Pope head
of the Church, making Laws to bind the Conscience, to forgive sins, save,
damn, etc. Therefore they cannot truly believe in God, and therefore it stands
them in hand to know Christ aright, and then to believe in him.

4. This condemns a number of ignorant creatures among us, Use 4.
which will come to God, but how? by their good meanings, good prayers, good
serving of God, civil life, and the like; as others which seem better taught,
by their repenting, and crying God mercy: Oh, this goes for current, and in the
mean time take no thought how his justice should be satisfied: These may cry
their hearts out to God, and find no mercy; they must bring Christ their
Surety in their hand, and plead mercy for his sake, and his satisfaction: Such
as were stung by the Fiery-Serpents, could not be otherwise healed, but by
looking up upon the Brazen-Serpent, neither we otherwise accepted of God, then
through Christ: Humble thou therefore thy self, confess thy sins, judge thy
self, know Christ, and plead his satisfaction.

That raised him up from the dead, Obs.
and gave him glory] The Father is here said to have raised up Christ, In
Christ's Resurrection the whole Trinity had a hand.
and yet the Son says of himself, That he laid down his life, and took it to
him again. A. Whatsoever the Father did herein, the same did the Son, and the
Holy Ghost: The work is common to all.

Here I might speak, 1. Of our Saviors Resurrection, and show how carefully all
the Evangelists have recorded it, with the witnesses thereof, and how all the
Apostles in their Sermons stood upon it, and how the Devil and the Jews
endeavored to hinder it, and what great benefits ensue unto us hereby. 2. Of
his Ascension, after forty days being on earth, Phil. 2. 9.
and how he changed his place, and vanished not, and how though absent in his
Humanity, he is ever present by his Spirit, and how he is most highly advanced,
and how his Godhead was not thus advanced (it was impossible) nor his manhood
by it self had such a name, and such glory due to it, but that the person of
Christ, God and man was advanced, and how now he makes intercession, and has
prepared a place for us; but of these I have spoken at large on the Creed.

That your faith and hope might be in God] Every one that believes in Christ
that these things belong to him, The benefits which those reap that believe in
Christ
may boldly believe and hope in God, for all good for this life, and that which
is to come, look for a full discharge of all sins, for power to rise to a new
life, for a glorious resurrection; look also on God with boldness, by the
intercession of Christ, and be assured of, expect and wait for an entrance into
the same glory our Head is entered into.

Verse 22. Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the
Spirit, unto unfeigned love of the brethren; see that ye love one another with a
pure heart fervently.
A Good life is an inseparable companion of Faith and Hope; God having bestowed
upon them the former, the Apostle would not have them to be wanting in the
latter. Generally he exhorts to Sanctification, verse. 14. then particularly,
first to renounce their lusts, ibid. then to embrace the contrary, Holiness,
verse. 15, 16. This he divides into two parts: 1. The fear of God; which
contains all parts of Piety toward God, verse. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. 2. Love to
our brethren; which comprehends all the Duties we owe to them. These two are
knit in a comely order, not to be sundred.

In this verse we have an Exhortation to true and Christian love; wherein we
have, 1. The ground of it, The grace of God, which they had received, namely,
for that they were Justified and Sanctified; which is set out by the part
purified, Their Souls: the outward means whereby, the word called Truth, which
they did obey; and the inward worker, the Spirit. 2. The end of it, which was
as to all good duties, so to true love amongst the rest; as if he had said,
Seeing you are pardoned and purged to this end, that you should love purely,
see that you do so. This ground is a Reason of the Exhortation; where it
seems the Holy Ghost keeps a good order both in his Exhortations and Reasons.
Before he exhorted to the fear and love of God, now to the love of the
Brethren: Before he had used Reasons both from the Godhead in general, verse.
15, 16. and from the first two persons of the Trinity; the Father, verse. 17.
and the Son, verse. 18, 19. Now he uses one taken from the third person, the
holy Spirit of God, who had wrought grace in them, and purified them to this
end.

From the order which the holy Ghost uses, Note we two things:

1. Where there is no love nor fear of God, Doct.
there can be no true Brotherly love, Where there is no love nor fear of God,
there can be no true brotherly love.
that being indeed the root from whence this springs.

1. Therefore there can be no true love amongst the wicked: Drunkards meet
together, and Pot-companionship is common, but this is no love, Use 1.
its conspiracy; Love rejoices in good, not evil. No more is a company of
Thieves and Traitors that conspire together, 1 Cor. 13. 6.
or many or fewer that combine against a good part, they may stick close, and
hold together in evil, but this is no love; nor in those Towns where there is
scarce any, or but mean teaching, where people meet twice or thrice a week to
Bowls, and women to Stool-ball, or other games, thus to spend out their time,
and to no good, is far from love; and yet if one speak against such things, Oh,
say they, You are an enemy to love and friendship; and, It was as a peaceable
Town till such a one came, as any other whatsoever, now there is no
good-fellowship etc. But our Savior Christ says, He came to bring no such
peace in evil, but rather debate: The Devil is content with this peace, because
they strengthen one another in evil; for if any good come to cross this merry
profane world, then will it be opposed: What hold is thereof their love? they
go arm in arm to the Tavern, yet straight ready to stab one another, or betray
each other, Judges 9. 23.
as Joab did Abner, and it was between the men of Sechem and Abimelech; if they
be once out at deadly defiance, its seldom forgiven, never forgotten.

2. Nor can the wicked love the children of God truly; Use 2.
they may be convinced in their conscience (as Saul) that they be the Servants
of God, innocent men, and God may incline their hearts to favor them, as Cyrus
to set the people at liberty to return and build ( For if a man's ways please
God, Prove. 16. 7.
his very enemies shall be at peace with them) and Ahasuerus and Artaxerxes
favored Ezra and Nehemiah; yea, as God kept Daniel among the Lions, so he can
and does keep his children among the wicked; and as he made the Ravens bring
Elijah meat, so he can make even the wicked instruments for his childrens good,
but love them they cannot: They may do a man outwardly some good (and not amiss
to take it) but to do it aright they cannot, as neither to pray, or do any
other duty; and what hold of their favor? If they cry Hosanna now, within a
while they will cry Crucify him; as those of Lystra would have sacrified to
Paul and Barnabas as gods, Acts 14. 15, 16, 19.
but by and by upon a lying report of some, stoned them; and as Herod
reverenced John the Baptist, yet at the persuasion of Herodias her Daughter,
cut off his head: Judas betrayed Christ, and David complained that it was his
familiar friend that did him the greatest hurt. If some great body shall say to
them, I perceive or hear you are a great favorer of Puritans, they are gone,
and hide their heads: if the multitude go the other way, or it be any thing
dangerous, when there is most need of them, they are gone.

2. Upon this coupling of these two together, Doct.
Note further, that Wheresoever there is the true fear and love of God, Where
there is the true fear or love of God, there is also brotherly love.
there will be also love toward our Brethren.

1. Therefore they that declare no love, but that they are void of all bowels
of compassion, 1 Ioh. 1.
being all for themselves, are also void of the love of God. 1 Ioh. 4. 12.


2. They also that malign, Use 1.
mock and persecute the better sort, no worse brand of such that they have in
them not the least dram of the love of God: Use 2.
He that loves him that begets, 1 Ioh. 5. 1.
loves also him that is begotten; Psalm. 15. 4.
and they that love God, make much of them that fear the Lord, Psalm. 16. 3.
having all their delight in such: The contrary is a black mark, and as bad as
may be, as bad a brand as any can bear; as hereby we may know that we are
translated from death unto life, 1 Ioh. 3. 14.
so by the contrary, that we are yet under darkness.

3. They that are contentious, Use 3.
giving or embracing every trifling occasion conducing hereto, and can fret,
and fall out, and live in enmity, and that day after day, week after week,
month after month; let these suspect themselves, either the love of God has
no place in them, or else its in a very small measure, and their corruption
overgrows the same.

Having purified your souls] These words are the Ground and Reason of the
Exhortation; namely, That forasmuch as they were Justified and Sanctified by
the Spirit of God to the exercise of all good duties, and so of love, that they
would do that for which they had this cost bestowed upon them.

This presupposing a former impurity, Obser.
notes the uncleanness that is in Soul and Body: There Is uncleanness in us,
both in Soul and Body
They were created pure, but are now defiled in the sight of God, and that with
sin, which God who is of pure eyes cannot abide; we are guilty of Adams sin,
born in Original sin, therewith tainted throughout, so with infinite actual
sins: Not only are our eyes full of adultery, our feet swift to shed blood, our
mouths full of cursing, etc. but our very souls defiled, and every faculty
thereof, Genesis 6. 5.
the thoughts of our heart being only evil continually, thereout proceeding
Murders, Matthew. 15.
Adulteries, etc. whereby we are defiled: Isa. 1. 16.
This is employed in that of the Prophet, Cease to do evil, learn to do well:
Iam. 4. 8.
and that of Saint James, Cleanse your hands ye sinners, and purify your
hearts ye double minded: Rev. 3. 17, 18.
We are not without filthy nakedness, we are so corrupt, that our nature taints
all our actions be they never so good in themselves, yea, the best and most
holy of Gods Ordinances, the Word, Sacraments and Prayer, making them
abominable in the sight of God: So impure that we cannot cleanse our selves,
nay, nor desire it, conceiving that even our uncleanness is purity, and becomes
us well: So as all the water in the Seas, all the help of Men and Angels cannot
help us; it must be the mighty work of God alone, as the very water in Baptism
teaches us.

This should humble us, Use.
and make us desire speedily to be cleansed, which is by the Blood of Christ
Jesus from sin past, and from the taint of nature by the Spirit of
Sanctification: But how few are thus affected? how few take knowledge of their
uncleanness, and that sin does so defile them? 1. There are even open profane
ones, which yet seek no washing, but refuse it, yea, think themselves clean
enough, yea, hate them that wallow not in the mire as themselves, thinking
strange to see any cleanse themselves by the Word and Prayer, yea, think them
strange that will not go on in their filthiness, by companying and joining with
them. 2. Civil persons can see no such thing, therefore few of them are
cleansed, because few find themselves leprous, and desire to be cleansed; let
such take knowledge of their uncleanness, John 3. 5.
yea, let the civilest know, that if they be not born again of water and the
holy Ghost, they cannot see the Kingdom of God: Seek therefore to be purged in
time, Mat. 5. 8.
that you may please God, and see him, for without holiness none shall see him:
Heb. 12. 14.
He only that has innocent hands, Psalm. 15. 2.
and a pure heart, shall enter into his Tabernacle; else person, service, and
all, is loathsome to God, and what should such a man do living? And the servants
of God that are in some measure purged, must desire to be more purged of these
evils that cleave to them, Obs.
and prevail so much over them, Where there is sanctification of the soul,
there is also sanctification of the body.
and defile even their best duties.

Your souls] Hereby he means the whole man, both Body and Soul, for God
sanctifies throughout, and there the body is Sanctified, where there is
Sanctification of the Soul, as from which comes the Sanctification of the Body.

In obeying the truth] The Word of God is the outward instrument of our
cleansing: Doct.
Thus were Zacheus, Mary Magdalene and the Jailer; The Word of God is the
outward instrument of our cleansing.
thus also are we sanctified. The Law pulling down, the Gospel by degrees lifts
up, working an high prizing of the remedy, vehement longing after it, Ioh. 15.
3. and 17. 17.
at last some persuasion which Faith unites to Christ, whereby guiltiness and
sin is pardoned in Christ's death, and corruption being taken away, the grace of
Sanctification is given, which Faith sucketh from Christ the fountain of life;
so that as he that is out of Christ can do no good, John 15. 5.
so united to him, we receive sanctifying grace; Acts 15. 9.
therefore Faith is said to purify the heart, namely, by uniting us to Christ,
and the Word is the instrument to work Faith: Besides, the Word purges thus,
not only setting before us as in a glass all our faults, and what we should
do, but it works in us care and conscience to be obedient.

1. Therefore thank God for the Word, Use 1.
the instrument of purging: Where it is not, all lie in the mire; O how we
should desire the free passage of it!

2. If we see our children and servants defiled, Use 2.
we must bring them to the Word, and pray and wait thereon.

3. For our selves, Use 3.
we are to try, whether it has been effectual to wash us, both heart and hand,
if yea, then there is comfort, it has obtained the right end; if not, but that
we remain in our filthiness, or in any part of it willingly, its a fearful
sign: Many have been cleansed by it, what has it purged us of? Has it washed
our mouths from swearing, lying? our hands from wrong? our eyes from
wantonness? our hearts from the love of all sin, our master sin, especially as
Zacheus?

They obeying the Word, their Souls and bodies were purged thereby, 1 Samuel 15.
22.
else they could not: This is better then Sacrifice, and disobedience is that
which the Lord cannot away withal, Ier. 25. 12, 1^.
but will grievously punish. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8.
All the stir is about obeying the truth, for men can be content to hear, 1
Pet. 4. 17.
but to obey is death; O how would the Word purify men, if they would obey it!
its just with God to take away the Truth from us, because we obey it not.

Truth] The Word is called Truth, Why the Word is called Truth
not true only, but Truth, the Truth, John 17. 17.
nothing but Truth, and in matters of God and our Salvation, all the Truth,
James 1. 18.
the rule of Truth.

1. Then Traditions contrary to this, Use 1.
are lies, and whatsoever else.

2. Its Blasphemy to speak against this Truth, Use 2.
or any part of it.

3. Let Gods poor people get the Word on their sides, Use 3.
humble persons get a promise, and stay upon it against all contrary
temptations: They are lies, the Word is the truth; yet they suffer themselves
to be more carried away with a temptation of Satan, or that rises of their own
unbelief, then they are comforted by three or four plain promises of Gods Word.

4. Let the wicked that make such slight account of Gods threatenings, Use 4.
know, Heb. 13. 4.
that they shall prove all too true for them; they shall not be held guiltless:
and they go in danger of all Gods wrath and curses every hour, and hang over
the pit of Hell, etc. These things move not, but the Word ought to make their
hearts ache and tremble, as who shall one day find whose word shall stand,
theirs or the Lords.

Through the Spirit, Doct.
] The inward worker is the Spirit, without which all will be in vain. The
Spirit is the inward worker of Sanctification.
Its the Spirit that works all from first to last, opens the understanding,
works Faith, and then conveys power from Christ, to dye to sin, and live to
righteousness; without him we shall have but bind eyes, Acts 11. 21. and 16.
14.
ears stopped, no hearing ears: he opened the heart of Lydia.

We must not then trust to our selves, Use.
or our wit, learning and parts, but acknowledge the very best thing in us, the
wisdom of the flesh, to be enmity against God: Nor must we trust to any
Preacher in the world, Romans 8. 7.
for its God only that gives the increase; but ever come in humility, 1 Cor.
3. 6, 7.
calling upon God, both on our own and the Preachers behalf, that God would
give us his Spirit to make all effectual, that through him we may understand,
believe and obey.

Unto unfeigned love of the brethren;] Hence note,

1. That till a man be cleansed by the Spirit of Sanctification, Obs.
he is not fit to do any good, Till we be cleansed by the Spirit, we are unfit
for any duty.
no not for love; for the heart must first be emptied of the love of all evil,
ere the love of any good can take place: The garden must be rid of weeds and
stones, ere we sow and plant.

For those therefore that declare by their looseness, Use.
that there remains the love of some lust in them, its as sure as God is in
heaven, for all the countenance they make of Religion, and show of profession,
and good things, there is not any dram of true grace in them, and all the
seeming good things they do, are in hypocrisy, and to no purpose; for the love
of evil, and of good, cannot be at one time in one heart. O look to it, will
you lose all your comfort here, and all your labor, yea Heaven it self, for
some one sin?

2. The end of our Sanctification is to be fruitful in good works, Obs.
and to set upon good duties. The end of our Sanctification is to be fruitful
in good works.


Such therefore as profess themselves to be Sanctified, must be more fruitful.

Touching the grace here exhorted unto, Ephesians. 2. 20.
speak we both in general and particular: Iam. 1. 18.
In general; where consider,

1. What Love is. Use.
Its a Sanctified affection of the heart, wherewith whosoever is endued, What Love
is.
endeavoreth to do all the good he can to all, but especially to them that be
nearest unto him. Its an affection seated (as is said) in the heart, as the
others of Hope, Fear, Joy, Grief, etc. are. They were all good and well ordered
in Adam, but ever since his fall woefully corrupted, and utterly disordered and
perverted; as this of love is turned either into an hatred of that we should
love, or into self-love.

Its a Sanctified Affection: For ere a man can love, he must be Regenerate and
Sanctified throughout, which comes by being united to Christ by Faith, whereby
our affections are in some measure purged and restored to their former
integrity, as to hate evil, and love good, God, Gal. 5. 22.
and our Brethren for Gods cause: Love is a fruit of the Spirit, and must come
from a pure Heart, 1 Timothy 1. 5.
good Conscience, and Faith unfeigned, and therefore cannot be in an
unregenerate person; there may be indeed a show and shadow of it, but that's no
true love: They do not love one another, neither possibly can love the people
of God. See Psalm. 41. 9. and 55. 13.
There Is no trust in them, they do but watch their opportunity when to do them
mischief: Mat. 10. 21.
O the wretched condition of such! how needful were for them to be wearied
thereof? And for the people of God, they must not trust them, or too much open
themselves to them: He only that fears God is to be trusted, he dares not
deceive.

Wherewith whosoever is endued, endeavoreth: Though love be in the heart, yet it
must and will show it self forth in the Life, See 1 Ioh. 3. ^7.
Words, and Deeds, to Soul and Body, else its like the love of bad men to God,
who yet keep not his commandments; James 2. 14, 15, 16.
or like the worldlings Faith which is without Works.

To do good: For its the nature of love, it can do no hurt, but what good it
can it will do, to Soul and Body; and wheresoever any true good is done to Soul
or Body, Romans 13. 10.
Goods or Name, there was love, love did it.

To all: For though brotherly kindeness be to the people of God, yet love
reaches to all, whether near or far off, to Strangers, Enemies, such as are
not yet called, under the Turk, Pope, Pagans, etc. for whom we are to pray, and
to do them all the good we can, with the pitiful Samaritan. Luke 10. 34.


But especially to them that be nearest: So God gives leave, nay, commands that
our love begin at our selves and ours, and so go on forward to them that be
nearest by nature: ^ Tim. 5. 4, 8, 16.
Therefore they that prefer Strangers before Kinsmen, and Kinsmen before
Children, are blameworthy, and to bestow upon any, to the undoing of ones
Family, is not love but folly: as in them which will spend in lewd company,
their Wives and Children at home being in want. So must it be to them that ^e
nearest by grace: Gal. 6. 10.
This is often commanded, and highly also commended in the Scriptures: Romans 12.
10. and 13. 8.
This is the bond of perfection, It binds up all the duties that we owe to our
Neighbor, Col. 3. 14.
which are many, holds them together as the bond of a Faggot, and makes every
duty easy, as where this is not every duty is irksome, nothing comes well off
hand; It ties Societies together and Families: O how it keeps out evil, how it
sets up good! By it small things have become great, and for want of it great
things have come to nothing: Its the fulfilling of the Law, Romans 13. 8.
Its a most beneficial virtue; other virtues benefit our selves, Gal. 5. 13, 14.
but this does good to others: Psalm. 133.
Faith draws all from Christ to us, Love lays out it self for others good, as
the Sun that has no light for it self; other virtues be like the Bung of a
Barrel, Love like the Tap that sets it abroach to the benefit of them that
need. If a man be as full of gifts as a Tun of Liquor, if he have no Tap,
others may starve; 1 Cor. 13. 1, 2.
so for Temporal things: without this all gifts are nothing, but as sounding
Brass. We are not born for our selves, but the perfection of all we have is to
employ: This is the lasting virtue, which (when others, as Faith and Hope,
shall end) shall spring afresh, abound, and abide for ever; that virtue that
makes us like to God, for he is Love, and does good to all, even his enemies,
though he have a special affection to his Children: O that I could paint out
the face of this lovely virtue, that every one of us might grow in love
therewith!

2. The properties thereof, The properties of love.
whereby we may try whether it be in us, and in what measure. They are laid
down by the Apostle unto the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 13. 4.
Charity suffers long, and is kind; Charity envyeth not; Charity vaunteth
not it self, is not puffed up, does not behave it self unseemly, etc. Take we
notice of a few of them; 1. Love will interpret things doubtful to the best;
(that is, speeches or actions of men toward our selves or others) and if they
may be taken well, will not take them ill: Our nature is to take every thing in
the worst part, Love does otherwise; the Mother says a pin pricks the Child,
or it breeds teeth, when it may be its of frowardnes that it cries. Thus
Joseph's Brethren sold him spitefully into Egypt, afterward when by reason
thereof they were afraid, what construction made he thereof? God (says he) did
send me before you to preserve life. Genesis 45. 5.
If a thing be plainly evil, yet it will make it no worse then it is, nor say
it was done deliberately, when it may be it was done rashly; or maliciously,
when it may be it was done weakly and in temptation; for one may do injury to a
bad action, in making it worse, and its better to judge a little better of a
thing, then worse then it is: Always provided this be understood, not of
palpable, notorious, foul evils, nor of continued courses in sinning; for what
good or charitable construction can a man make of these? Therefore such say
foolishly, when being informed hereof, they Reply, Oh, ye must not judge; what
can be judged of this case, but only that there may be Repentance? Its a fault
in Ministers and others that will extenuate foul sins in bad persons and wicked
livers, Mat. 17. 27.
rather then break love, as give way in conference, and yield, Genesis 13. 8.
though we know we have the truth, so it be in small matters; after offenses
yield, and sometimes seek Reconciliation, though it were meet the other should
seek to us; for why? it more prizeth and esteems love, See M. Perkins
Christian Equity.
then small matters: It will lay down the bucklers, go on the lower ground,
yield the way or the wall, when there is no whether in life, Romans 13. 10.
chastity, goods, and good name: See it in God, a perfect pattern of love, He
does all good (no hurt) to his Children: It provokes not, but strives by all
means to please all as far as may be with a good conscience; it seeks not its
own things, but others as well. 4. Its not easily provoked, but forbears,
forgives, puts up, etc. It will See Mr. Perkins cases of Cons.
such things as be weaknesses in our brethren, natural defects, not done of set
purpose, or breaking out into extremities: 1. 3. cap. 3. page 135.
As some be a little too quick, some a little too slow; some seeing a fault are
too ready to speak, 1 Cor. 13. 5.
some a little too slow to speak or reprove; some a little too fine, earnest,
negligent, merry, solemn, others a little too homely and plain, remiss, sad,
sullen, etc. If they were not so much on either hand it were better: These love
will cover, or nothing; love will not stand upon them, rebuke or reproach them,
it will not deal hardly with them for these things, but wisely bear them: Thus
will a loving husband bear with his wife, that fears God, though happily somewhat
quick, and cursed, happily not so cleanly, or provident altogether as were to be
desired: So a wife with her husband, though happily not so affable, or whose
nature will not suffer him to use such complements to his wife as some can with
facility: So if a servant be very trusty and careful to please, only somewhat
slow, the Master must not hereupon rebuke him too often, too openly, too sharply,
sometime lovingly in private he may: So a Neighbor confers with a Neighbor, and
the one is a little too quick; love will not see it, but consider its a natural
infirmity, its not much out of the way, though somewhat it is; love will not
exasperate him, or answer him tartly, but go on friendly, in a manner not so
much as taking notice thereof: Love will also cover and put up wrongs done unto
it, not seeing small ones, but forgiving, and putting them up, saying, Thus
ought I to do, he is a man, I am also subject to offend my Neighbor, and would
be forgiven, and stand also in need that others should pardon me: And as a
Christian I must do, For I sin daily against God, Mat. 6. 12.
and so crave to be forgiven of him, as I forgive others: If they be greater
matters, yet love will easily accept of any indifferent conditions of
agreement, and that unto Seventy seven times: If they be so great, that without
great prejudice to our estate and reputation they cannot be passed by, then its
lawful to have recourse unto the Magistrate, and use the benefit of the Law;
but so as there be no malice, and the revenge be not in any case sought after.
Two Caveats to be observed of them that for redressing of wrongs make use of
the Magistrate.
Herein two Caveats must be observed, It must not be for trifles (which ought
rather to be forgiven) and it must be the last remedy, when all other ways of
more peaceable and quiet agreement have been tried, as the cutting off of an
arm or leg, when no ways else will help: Hereto belongs also, that love
covers folks faults from the World, 1 Cor. 6. 7.
except it has cause and calling to speak thereof, commonly it speaks of their
virtues: The contrary is most woefully common, little of men's virtues, except a
word or two to make way to speak of their faults, and these we delight to be
much in; Simile.
As the Crow that likes the Carrion, and the Hog that delights in mire, rather
then to lie on the green grass, or the Fly, that is more on a galled or sore
place of a Horse, then on his whole body, or one that passing by sweet flowers
in a garden, gathers Mat. 5. 42.
adding prayer for all. Temporal; It will give to the poorest that are to be
helped by alms, Deuteronomy. 15. 10.
as it is able; it will give in greater measure on solemn times, Acts 4. 37.
yea of the main stock in persecution or hard times; it will give cheerfully,
and such God loves; it will also give quickly, 2 Cor. 9. 7.
that is to give twice; it will also lend to them that be a degree above the
poorest, Prove. 3. 28.
which having a Trade, Skill and will to follow their Trade, only want a stock
to employ themselves and theirs: These a man is as much bound in conscience to
lend unto, according to their ability, and honestly to pay again, as to give a
piece of bread, or a penny to a poor miserable creature; by this help many have
lived in good sort, and brought up their Families. To the wealthy that have no
need of us, yet we must be neighborly and friendly, communicating in
kindenesses with them, inviting them also sometimes to us, and going to them
being invited; so we must visit them in their sickness and heaviness, and
comfort them in the best manner we can.

Now love being such a thing, Obs.
and these being the properties thereof, There Is little love in the world.
if we try the world by the same, we must needs conclude, that there is little
love in the world. 1. Who takes not things in the worst part, hardly construing
men's words and actions? the doubtful ones (happily not bad) they judge to be
evil; those that be evil indeed, they make far worse then they are: 1 Samuel ^.
14.
Thus did Ely judge amiss of Hannah, when her lips only moved; and the Jews
with our Savior Christ, when he said, John 2. 20.
Destroy this Temple: this is the cause of innumerable contentions and breaches
among men. 2. For departing from right, who does it? who stands not out stiffly
to the uttermost? This is an usual speech, Its my right, and I will have it, I
ask no more but my right, and that I will not lose; this is thought but
reasonable, and he is thought but an honest man that will have but his right,
but its an ill speech and resolution, whether it be in conference: If a man
know he has the truth (though it be but in small matters) yet he will hold it
out, though the other be never so peremptory, till in conclusion, they fall
flat out, this is naught; in small matters it were better to yield: so in
Dealings, Covenants, Bargains, Bonds, men will have their right; herein right
may be extreme wrong, always provided that we give not away another right,
Exodus 10. 9.
especially Gods: Moses would not yield an hoof; yet most men are stiff in
their own, will yield enough of Gods right; as they will not suffer their
Servants to play one hour in the week day, but for the Lords day, they will
suffer them therein to play as much as they will. 3. Whereas love does no hurt
to any, Whence comes all the hurt and mischief in the world? Stabbing,
Fighting, Quarrelling, Railing, Reviling, Scolding, Crying, all the defiling of
men's Wives, Children, Servants? So for Oppression, Bribery, Thievery,
Cousenage, false Weights, deceitful Wares? So Slandering, Defaming, Backbiting,
Mocking? All these abound in the World: I am sure they come not of Love, it was
never at the doing of them, and those that will so readily provoke one another
by words and deeds they care not how, are far enough from love. 4. For being
provoked, O Lord be merciful to us, who can bear any thing, but taunt for
taunt, quip for quip; he shall have as good as he brings, is common with every
one: How do men stand upon every small trespass? Hence the innumerable
Contentions and Suits in the Land, thousands in a year for mere trifles,
wherein ten times as much is spent then is sued for, which is a shame for
England, having had the Gospel of Peace so long: Oh, men's stomachs be up
straight, all their blood in their faces, or looking as pale as ashes, or
secretly practicing to revenge, hand on the Dagger straight, straight on the
top of the house, fly in our Neighbors face by and by; so little love is there
to forgive till Seventy, I may say till Seven times; so short Spirited, as we
can bear nothing; and that which is worse, if we have once taken up a
displeasure, its not easily laid down, but Sun after Sun, Moon after Moon, yea,
Year after Year it continues; quickly provoked, hardly pacified, especially
truly. It may be we live not in open enmity, yet in secret grudging, the heart
not sound, but ready to break out upon every occasion, can abide nothing but
Revenge, which is fearful. 5. Where is communicating of Spiritual good things?
Parents bring up their children brave, but how few Catechize, Counsel and
Instruct them, pray with or for them? So for Servants, They give them Meat,
Drink and Wages, with work enough on the six days, little caring how they spend
the Lords day, neither instructing them, examining them, or drawing them to
hear the Word, or Read, and Pray: What love call you this? show you not as much
to your Beasts? So for our Neighbors, who admonishes them that be out of the
way? do we not rather let them run on, talking of their Infirmities behind
their backs, and spreading them to their grace? Nay, do not many, yea most
rejoice thereat? what consolation to the heavy? who takes it to heart? how few
are able to comfort fitly? but utter vain, idle, if not more hurtful words to
to such, nay, many rather laugh and jest at heavy conscienced persons, every
man says, Is he is Brothers keeper? Nay, alas, so far from communicating
Spiritual grace to them (which they ought) or to call one another to go to the
house of God, as they rather use all means, by jesting at them, troubling them,
etc. to discourage them; yea, how many have given lewd and wicked counsels to
others to the dishonor of God? For outward things, how backward are most from
giving any more then they needs must? What contentions at making of Rates? For
lending, where is this? but rather as if God had never given precept for it, or
as if it were like a Statute repealed, which is of no use, so is this duty:
That cursed Trade of Lending upon Usury, has eaten up, and banished out of the
Country this Christian duty of free lending; What rich man has almost at any
time any thing to lend? Some are so grim and austere, as a poor man dares not
speak to them for such a thing: Some put so much to Usury, as they neglect
their Trading, set none a work, nor have ought to lend at any time, but rather
borrow; and if a poor man happen to do any work for them, they cannot pay him
in a good while, they are so bare; for as soon as any money comes in, it must
out straight to Use, as if it would burn a hole in their Cupboard if it lay
there two or three days, or a week. Others are ever Purchasing, and are ever in
debt, and will be; then wrangle at Rates, grudge at this and that, are never
fit to lend; such bring a curse upon themselves willingly, which is to borrow,
when as they might else lend. Others are so miserable, that though they have
wherewith, yet will not lend: So for Neighborly dealing, Mat. 24. 12.
inviting, visiting, etc. Love is very cold. Here I may add, That there is a
great deal of counterfeit love, Pot-companionship, and joining in vanity, a
deal of fawning, crouching, conguing, etc. a great deal of self-love, 2 Timothy 3.
2.
making others faults great, and their own small or none; nay sometimes
extenuating and making light of the virtues of others, highly esteeming their
own; being ready to provoke and wrong others, but bearing nothing, straight
provoked, seeking their own in all their dealings and courses, so making sure
for themselves, without regard to their Neighbors: These be the times. Now let
every man examine himself, and see how its with himself in these, who finds
not himself ready to take things at the worst? and have we not often done so,
when as afterward having heard that it was nothing so, but quite otherwise, we
have been put to shame, and forced to say for our own excuse, We heard or
thought it had been so: The like might be particularized in the rest.

3. The causes of the want of love: The causes of the want of love.
1. Want or weakness of Faith; when our Savior taught his Apostles this Duty,
they said, Lord, increase our Faith: Assurance of pardon makes us forgive. 2.
Pride, Luke 17. 4, 5.
whereby men think highly of themselves, meanly of others; Prove. 13. 10.
Only by Pride comes contention, but humbleness causes love: Ephesians. 4* 2.
Pride makes men think themselves so wise and good, as every body should say as
they say, and yield in all things to them, when they do not, they break the
peace, as Haman with Mordecai: Pride cannot endure a reproof, therefore could
not Herod abide John, Ahab, Elijah and Micaiah: Pride makes men think so highly
of themselves, and meanly of others, that they will not bear any wrong, but
take the least in scorn. 3. Covetousness; this makes men contend for trifles,
Oppress, use false weights and sleights, as also hinders from inviting and
meeting together. 4. Envy at the Labans sons did at Jacob; Cain, that Abels
Sacrifice was better regarded then his; Esau, that Jacob was blessed; and
Ismael, that Isaac was the son of the Promise. 5. Frowardness and shortness of
spirit breaks

are lamentable every where, both in Church and Commonwealth; O what woeful
breaches and contentions? what wrongs and enmities? So in Families, so among
particular persons, how break they out to the dishonor of God? yea, sometimes
Professors one with another, to the shame of their Profession, the interrupting
of their Prayers, or either the hindering of themselves from the Sacrament (as
many a time it is) or slubbering it over, and coming with festred hearts, and
so depriving themselves of the benefit thereof, nay, provoking the Lord by
their unworthy receiving.

Seeing these things be so, Use.
O let every one of us, finding our selves faulty, humble our selves, crave
mercy, and labor to be reformed herein: To this end learn we to pluck out of
our hearts those noysom weeds, that this precious plant of love may grow. We
must strive against infidelity, and labor for more faith: In humbleness of
mind we must labor to esteem every one better then our selves; we must labor
for a moderate affection to outward things, setting more by peace then them; we
must also avoid envy: We have more then we could have looked for; Is our eye
evil because our Masters is good? we must also cease from frowardness, and be
gentle and meek; and labor we that this love to our brethren may show forth it
self in all good fruits, as in judging the best, departing from our right, not
provoking, or being easily provoked, but forbearing and forgiving: Alas, we
have need that others should forgive us; for who lives, and is not subject to
offend? God forgives us many and great debts, and shall we catch our neighbor
by the throat? Mat. 18. 26, 28
God bids us ask forgiveness on no other condition, but to forgive our
offenders; and there is no better sign that a man is forgiven of God, then to
show mercy to men; none can be assured of that, but they will forgive: Let us
therefore from the sea of compassion that God sheddeth out upon us, let fall
some drop thereof on our neighbors, and not seek revenge, which every bad man,
Pro. 19. 19. 11.
yea beast can do, but pass by offenses, which is the glory of a man: Besides,
revenge is the Lords Office, and to revenge, is indeed to resist the Lord,
without whose Providence nothing is done; this kept David from revenging
himself on Shimei. Not to revenge, is always the best way for us, and the worst
for him that wrongs us: There Is no dealing with a man that commits his cause to
God; more safe to anger a Witch, then an Innocent meek spirited man that has
his recourse to God; thou had better deal with one that will take revenge on
thee to the uttermost. To this end keep we out anger if we can; if not, yet let
it not rest in us, as it were sowring in our hearts: Let not the Sun go down
upon it. This indeed the world accounts a base thing, Mic. 7. 18.
but its honorable, it makes us like God: Neither must we labor for this a
little, or some few times, but for a long skirted love, Prove. 10. 12.
that will cover even a multitude of offenses. And let our love show it self in
giving Spiritual and Temporal things; for God gives to good and bad, and makes
us but Stewards of that he gives us, that we may dispense the same; yea, the
more we give, the more we have, as which increases by giving: and for Temporal
things, Pro. 11. 24, 25.
the highway to thrive therein, is to be merciful; as to beggary, to be
pinching.

5. The general reasons inciting to this duty of love, Reasons inciting us to
this duty of love.
1. God requires it of us, who is love; and if we perform it, we do not so
Isa. 58. 2.
who takes himself wronged in this point. 2. We are all one Genesis 13. 8.
not Natural ones, but a better Brotherhood, a nearer Bond: Now between
Brethren there must be no contention, 1 Cor. 6. 6.
and it were a Ioh. 13. 34, 35.
love God, are Christ's Disciples, 1 Ioh. 3. 14.
and translated from death to life, then this. 5. The beauty See Pro. 10.
as they wept for Dorcas; but a proud, churlish, Acts 9. 39.
close man, he shall live without being desired, and dye without being mourned
for: Many would have Love, and Good Will, and Credit, but will not seek this
way to procure it; they live closely to themselves, neither being useful, or
any way liberal to their Neighbors, let them never look for it: Many care not,
so they may scrape all to themselves (for their good name let it go whether it
will) but these are bafounded, and its a curse so to live. Thus in general.

In particular, Touching the love to the Children of God, which is here
cheerfully called for, consider we both the duty, and the manner how its to be
performed.

For the duty it self, it has these two things in it, 1. That we have
brotherly and tender affections one toward another. 2. That we show it forth
by brotherly actions and fruits answerable; Romans 12. 16, 17.
both which must necessarily go together.

1. Then, Obser.
In vain do any challenge tender and loving affections, except they show the
fruit thereof to their Brethrens Bodies and Souls especially. The fruits of
love toward our brethren must accompany the profession thereof.


2. Its not enough to do brotherly offices, unless they proceed from brotherly
affections: Many a man will give frankly, and do other duties required of him,
but defiles his liberality with insulting over the parties relieved, Obs.
upbraiding them therewith, The doing of brotherly offices must proceed from
brotherly affections.
and thinking thereby to make them subject unto them; whereas a gift should be
given cheerfully, and seeing one that stands in need of our help, we ought
compassionately to tender his estate as our own; remembering Gods commandment
for relieving such a one, and thanking God we may: and though the party ought
to be thankful, yet should not we stain our liberality with any sinister manner
of giving: It must be frank, that's the nature of a gift, and it must also come
from compassion and feeling. So for reproving, admonishing, etc. (an excellent
duty, I would it were more usual) it must proceed from a brotherly affection,
not proudly, imperiously, or harshly: So we must invite from a brotherly
affection, else our brotherly action loses his grace with God, yea, with men
also if they perceive it.

And though we are chiefly to love Gods servants, Love must reach to all.
Christians, professors with us of the same Religion, and our fellow Brethren;
yet we are not to neglect any, we must love all, all that either be, or may be
the people of God, though they be yet Pagans, Heathens, etc. for they are our
own flesh, and have in them (as ye heard) some part of the Image of God, as in
their Soul, which is a Spirit, and Immortal, and the Majesty of their face
above all Creatures: A King, though an Heathen, has a part of the Image of God
in his Sovereignty.

Then we must love the Devil, Object.
as having some part of Gods Image.

We are not, Sol.
because he is pronounced of God as his final and desperate Enemy, appointed to
destruction: So if we knew any such men (as the Prophets did) we ought not to
love them, but hate them; not pray for them, but against them, as David did.
For others, though Infidels we must love them, and if God cast them into our
lot, we must do good to them, to their Souls and Bodies.

They be strangers to me. Object.


So was the Jew that fell among Thieves to the Samaritan, Sol.
and in that Christ taught who is our Neighbor: Luke 10. 33.
Gods Image ought not to seem strange to us, but loved wheresoever we see it.

They never did ought for me. Object.


But God has, Sol.
who bids thee love.

They have wronged me, Object.
and are mine enemies.

This is no sufficient ground for thee not to love them, Sol.
for the rule is not to love for that thou art loved, Matt. 5. 44.
but because the Lord commands it: Romans 5. 10.
God is not our enemy, he deserves well of us, and to him we owe all that may
be; and he has turned us over to pay some of the debt we owe him to our enemy,
and he will take it as paid to him: Note.
O that we could learn this Lesson! And if we must love that small part of the
Image of God where we see it, then where its more, we must love more: Therefore
where we see the very face of his Image renewed in Wisdom, Holiness,
Righteousness, and the Sanctifying Grace of Gods Spirit vouchsafing to make a
man a new Creature, and Holy as he is Holy; Oh, this we ought to embrace, love,
reverence in a high degree: we cannot show a better tokenof our love to God, 1
Ioh. 5. 1. and 3. 14.
then to love his Image, and the more we see it, Zech. 2. 8.
to love it the more, such are dear to God, as the Apple of his eye.

1. Those that make all alike, Use 1.
make one as welcome as another, make no difference of good and bad in their
countenance, help, assistance, they be not endued with the Spirit of God, for
where it is, it will take knowledge of his own work, and make a man love it;
yea, though a carnal man should have some natural parts of civility, Gal. 6. 10.
skill, etc. more then a Christian man, yet we must affect grace most: These
men be neither fish nor flesh.

2. But much worse are those that of all persons like the Children of God
worst, Use 2.
and that for their zeal and forwardness; If It were not for them they could
like them, and therefore choose swearers, jesters, and profane persons for
their companions, and cannot away with the society of Christians, who in their
liberality will rather give to bad persons, fitting in the others light, and
making them fare the worse for their zeal and godliness: Of all men they cannot
away with these Puritans, and had rather their Friends should be any thing then
of that number, their Sons, Daughters, and Tenants, etc. They would love them,
1 John 3. 14. ibid. 10.
if they were not so precise: A bad sign, such are not translated from death to
life, are not of God, are in darkness to this hour; Psalm. 15. 4. and 16. 3.
they are not led by David's Spirit, who could not abide the workers of
iniquity: The more of Gods Image a man sees in another, to like him the worse
is a fearful sign of no love to God: If you will needs hate, hate not them
which God loves, but whom he hates; hate them not because he loves them, and
because of their goodness, Genesis 27. 29.
for God says to them as to Jacob, I will bless them that bless thee, and
curse them that curse thee; Number. 23. 8.
even Balaam himself refused to curse Israel: If they shall stand at the last
day, and be damned that gave them no meat, then what shall become of their
haters, imprisoners, and that for their goodness? Then would they be glad to be
with the least of them, but it shall be far from them, how little soever they
regard them in this world, and then shall their time of glory be, as is their
enemies in this world: We must therefore labor to be religious, else we can
never love them that be so because of their goodness.

Here also observe a difference between the love we ought to bear to the
Wicked, How we ought to love the Wicked.
Pagans, Infidels, etc. we must love them as our flesh, not as our brethren,
for they have not God for their Father, the Church for their Mother, have not
sucked the same breasts with us, the Word and Sacraments: Therefore look how
natural Brethren be affected each to other, so ought Christians, Fellow-heirs
of the same Inheritance, as having a better Brotherhood, as much as the Spirit
is better then the Flesh, and Grace above Nature. Our Savior preferred the
hearers and doers of the Word, before his natural Kindred: This is a more
lasting Brotherhood, which abides longer then this life, even for ever, when it
shall be with a most entire affection each to other, which often in this life
is not, because of the weakness of Grace: Its unseemly for Kinsmen to disagree,
Genesis 13. 8.
much more Brethren, but most for Christians to fall out, See 1 Cor. 6. 8.
to contend, wrangle, and be at odds: Do we not profess we are members of
Christ, and persuade our selves our Neighbors are so? We do; then let Nature
teach us: See how the natural members be affected? Are we not Fellow-Brethren?
When therefore we live in enmity with our Neighbor that is a Christian, we do
as much as in us lies put him out of the Lords Roll, and unbrother him; for is
he our Brother, of the same Father and Mother, and can we jar with him?
especially (though somewhat should fall out otherwise then well) can we suffer
the Sun to go down upon our wrath? God forbid: When we come to Heaven, we shall
love all our Fellow-Brethren, better then ever two Brethren loved in this
World, and shall we not aim at it now, and come as near it as we can? John 15.
19.
and we have need so to do, for the World loves their own, therefore hates us;
shall not we then hold together? shall we be divided within our selves? O what
wrack comes of this in the Church of God in these days? whiles Brethren differ
and contend, the common Enemies, Atheists and Papists multiply.

For the manner of it, Doctr.
It must be without faining, love unfeigned; God hates dissembling in every
thing, Love must be without fainng.
loves simplicity and plain dealing, Romans 12. 9.
as in Jacob and Nathanael: If love, which is the main virtue, be counterfeit
and false, 1 John 3. 18.
what shall become of all the duties that proceed from thence?

Two sorts of persons may be here chiefly taxed:

1. Such as pretend to love, Use 1.
but indeed hate, as Joab to Amasa, Saul to David, Psalm. 28. 3.
Judas to our Savior Christ; such have a mark of Rebrobation, workers of
Iniquity, to whom belongs some notable judgment of God; Genesis 3. 5.
they be like the Devil, who pretended to love Eve, Mat. 4. 3.
and our Savior Christ: of these see Psalm. 12. 2. and 55. 12. and 62. 4. Pro.
26. 24. Jer. 9. 2. 1 Samuel 18. 17, 25. 2 Samuel 20. 9. Those are more dangerous to
them they hate, then if they bare open hatred; as one enemy within the walls,
is worse then ten without: its also worse for themselves, for any vice cloaked
or masked under show of virtue, is double iniquity; such shall receive greater
damnation, yet how common is this? Many will speak men as fair as may be, yet
lie in wait to do them a shrewd turn, and as soon as their back is turned,
raise a slander of them, and do them all the hurt they can: Others happily have
done so with us, but so must not we do.

2. Such as pretend they love, Use 2.
but do not: Many will salute with Good morrow, and Good night, when as there is
no true love; one handful of true hearty love, is worth ten armfuls of their
Court holy water, crouchings, and congees down to the ground. These are clouds
without rain, vessels with false bottoms, that have only a little water in the
top. Such are they who pretend they love the poor, who yet coming to them, can
get nothing of them, but what they are enforced to, and that very hardly. So
many good Ministers have proved the good will of a number that have made goodly
shows, but have found small kindeness at their hands: What love call you this?
its dead, as Faith without Works: James 5. 17.
Such is theirs, who will speak well of such and such, and seem to pity them,
saying, They are worthy men, and pity they should want, but yet relieve them
not at all. If God should so feed and deal with them, they would soon complain.

See that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently.] Here Is the
Exhortation; wherein we have again both the duty required, which is to love one
another, and the manner also, with a pure heart fervently.

Love one another] This notes,

1. A mutual love: Obs.
It must come from one to another mutually, and be at every hand. Love must be
mutual.
As others are to love us, so are we to love others; none free. Many will look
for a deal of love from others, that yet care not how little they themselves
part with; would be visited, but care not to visit others; would have their own
virtues commended, but will not do so by others; have their infirmities
covered, but will not do so by others; would not be provoked, yet will provoke;
would not that others should be quickly angry with them, who will yet be angry
with others: Acts 20. 35.
Alas, this is weakness; Its a more blessed thing to give then to receive, and
we should rather strive to go before, and set others in our debt by love: A
good mind rather remembers the debt that is going from him, then that which is
coming to him. This often comes of pride in some men, to look for much of
others, and perform little themselves: The husband often looks his wife should
walk at an inch with him, though he will break many else out of square; So the
wife will look for much of her husband, not caring how little she perform: This
is no equity; We must do as we would be done to. Its more dangerous for us to
neglect our duty to others, then for them to neglect theirs to us; let us
therefore strive who shall perform most each to other, Husbands, Wives,
Neighbors, etc.

2. A community: Obser.
We must not love one or two, or a few, but all that fear God in the place
wherein we live. In love there must be a community.
Love communicates it self, and is not engrossed to a few.

Many can be content to love one or two, or a few, but they oppose and justle
against many others, and live unkindely with them: This is no true love, nor
ought love so to be; yet in many Towns there is siding, which at the length
turns to its undoing; yea, we must love the meanest that fear God, and not
neglect them, as the meanest member of the Body is regarded of the chiefest; we
must not have the Faith of Christ in respect of persons. James 2. 1.
God has vouchsafed to give his Son to Redeem them, his Spirit to Sanctify
them, and Heaven to be possessed of them, and shall we despise them? Nay, we
ought rather to encourage and hearten them on in well doing, seeing so few of
that sort fear God. If we regard them, they will bear their poverty the better,
and it will be a great chearing to them: There Is nothing more comely, then for
the wealthy to be thus affable and kind to them; Prove. 22. 2.
The Lord is the Maker of both, and being fellow-Brethren and Fellow Members,
James 2. 5.
the one as dear to God as the other, a little wealth must not puff up the ones
mind over the other.

With a pure heart] Every kind of love is not that which is here required;
Gal. 5. 22.
it must be the fruit of the Spirit, 1 Timothy 1. 1.
proceeding from a Sanctified heart, and be agreeable to the pure Word of God.

This has many properties: The properties of pure love.
1. It loves for some good actions, which condemns the common love of wicked
persons, as of the Fornicator and his Harlot, the Adulterer and his Mate, the
Drunkards 1 Cor. 13. 6.
etc. this is cursed love. True love rejoices not in iniquity, a worse note
cannot be, then for one to love them, whom as Rebels and Conspirators against
God, he sees fighting against God. 2. Pure love is that which is grounded on
Grace and Religion, not on Genesis 25. 28.
as Isaac loved Esau for his hunting, and many a man his wife for her beauty:
These are false grounds, when they fail, love fails. 3. Pure love is in respect
of the party himself whom we Mat. 5. 46.
is indeed but self-love, as having a respect only to our selves. Many a man
shows kindeness to others to purchase credit: The charitable deeds of the
Papists were of self-love, for they were done out of opinion of merit: So the
love of worldlings, they have a reach at themselves. 4. Pure love reflects
chiefly on another Soul,

This condemns all impure love: Use.
So to love, as not to tell our neighbor of his fault for angring or disquieting
him; Lev. 19. 17.
this is hatred: So Parents that love their children so well, as they will not
nurture, rebuke or correct them, do indeed hate them, and slay them in
following their ways: He that spares the rod, hates his child. Prove. 13. 24.
Its as if any should be so tender over a child, as not to suffer the wind to
blow on it, and therefore holds their hand before the mouth of it, but holds it
so hard, as they strangle the child; Simil.
or as the Ape, which hugs her young one so hard, that she strangles it. Again,
friends persuade a man to do this or that for preferment, which he cannot do
with a good conscience, Oh, they love him, they would fain see him preferred;
woeful love to the body, by destroying the soul: A neighbor has his Child or
Cattle strangely handled, one comes in of love, persuading to send to such a
Cunning-man or good Witch (one of the Devils worsts instruments) Is this love?
Is he a friend that will do that whereby a penny may be gained, but many hundred
pounds lost? So when a Christian is ready to suffer for a good Conscience, and
a friend comes and says, Oh, I pray cast not away your self, I wish you well,
do as the times are, and as others do: This was the tormentors love to Martyrs
(tormenting love indeed) that by saving their bodies, their souls might perish:
Thus would Peter have persuaded our Savior, Mat. 16. 22.
O Master, these things shall not be unto thee; but if Christ had not suffered,
we had all perished in our sins, yea, the Saints in Heaven must have come out
from thence, for they went to Heaven by Christ who was to be crucified; What
love was this? our Saviors Answer shows, that he gave him no thanks for that
counsel.

Fervently.] This stands in two things, Earnestness and Constancy.

1. For the Earnestness of our love, Obs.
we must stretch it to as many persons as we can, A Christians love must be
earnest.
and to as many duties, as giving, forgiving, etc. and therein we must not be
sparing; as in giving, For he that gives sparingly, shall reap sparingly: 2
Cor. 9. 6.
So for forgiving, it must not be only an offense or two, 1 Pet. 4. 8.
Charity covers a multitude; thus is God to us, in giving for Soul, Body,
Goods, Good-name to us, to ours, day and night, never weary, never upbraiding
us: So in forgiving, how merciful is he to pass by our many offenses, and that
daily? should not we then herein resemble him? Again, a little love is soon
quenched, soon hindered, but we must love so, as if we meet with many
temptations from our selves, or the parties whom we are to love, our love
notwithstanding must last still; yea, we must not only do these things when we
can well do them, or there is nothing to let us, but even forget our ease,
pleasure and profit to do our neighbor good: Love seeks not her own things, 1
Cor. 13. 5.
is laborious; we love our selves fervently, and therefore must so love our
neighbors.

This condemns the cold frozen love of the world, Use.
wherein there is no heat or fervency, a little thing lets: We are so full of
self love, that we will not speak so much as a good word in defense of the very
best, 1 Samuel 30. 23.
whether man or cause, Hest. 4. 16.
if thereby we may be prejudiced never so little; Obs.
so did not Jonathan, so did not Hester, when she adventured her life for her
people. Love must be constant.


2. For the constancy thereof, Heb. 13. 1.
Unity must be kept, we must seek Peace, Ephesians. 4. 3.
and follow after it, and its a part of fervency when it will not easily be
broken off. Psalm. 34.
Gods love is constant, ours must be so; the Devil will assay to break it off,
we must therefore the more stand in it: Oh, its the easiest matter in the world
to break off love, but we must not embrace any occasion moving hereunto.

This rebukes the inconstancy of many men, Use.
that are won with an Apple (as we say) and lost with a Nut, that will upon
every slight occasion break friendship; I loved him as well as could be (will
some such say) till such and such a thing fell out: and what, are you now broke
off? what can worldings do more? If God should so deal with us, how miserable
were we? but his love is constant, yea, he loves us in our adversity and low
estate, nay, best then, and is then nearest with his comforts; so it ought to
be with us, for then our Neighbor has most need of us, and then our love will
appear most free, not mercenary: But how contrary this is, daily experience
shows, while men be in prosperity they have many friends, which in their
affliction forsake them (as Doves, that come to fair houses, not to low
cottages) whereof Job often complains.

Verse 23. Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by
the Word of God, which lives and abides for ever.
THis duty of love is of such use, and we so untoward to it, and so hard a
thing for us to love as we ought, that its urged with a Reason: James 4. 5.
True, it is so, and no more then needs; for the spirit that is in us lusts
after envy. Tit. 3. 3.


The Reason is taken from the grace of Regeneration bestowed upon them, They
were born again, and therefore were to show the fruits thereof, as in other
things, so in this of love. Where might be noted,

1. That such as are not born again, Observe.
cannot love, no more then men can gather Grapes of Thorns, No unregenerate
person can truly love.
or Figs of Thistles, or pour Wine out of a Bottle full of Vinegar; but as
Grapes are gathered of the Vine, so must love come from a Regenerate man, not
otherwise.

2. That the Regenerate man must needs love; Observe.
therefore they that declare no love, Such as are born again, must needs love.
but hate their Brethren, the people of God especially, show they be not born
again, nor of God. But I proceed to the words.

Being born again, 1 Ioh. 3. 10.
] Here Is occasion offered to speak of the grace of Regeneration. Touching it,
consider briefly these particulars:

1. What it is to be born again; What Regeneration is.
Its to be made new creatures, to be cast in a new mold, to have the corrupt
Image of Sin, which we have by Nature (and wherein we were conceived and born)
put off throughout, and the contrary good one, wherein we were at the first
created, put on, to have the understanding enlightened with distinct knowledge
of God, the heart bowed to the obedience of God, etc. new thoughts, 2 Cor. 5.
17.
desires, speeches, actions: In the new Creature all things must become new;
Thus its done to all that were elect before the foundation of the world: They
are changed up and down, from a good state by Creation, to a bad in Adam; from
thence to a good one in Christ, by grace here in expectation of glory
hereafter: For the wicked, they are changed from good to bad, and there remain
the same (but still worse and worse) for ever; we should give God thanks that
made us so good at first, be humbled to see our base and woeful state now, and
seeing there is help, never to be quiet till we recover our first condition.

2. That the Lord is the Author hereof, The Lord the author thereof.
he takes away the stony heart, See Deuteronomy. 29. 4.
and gives a new heart, an heart of flesh; Its his work only, nor Man or Angel
can change the heart, Psalm. 51. 10.
to work a deadly hatred of that which by nature we love as our lives, Ezekiel.
36. 26.
and to love and take delight in those courses, John 1. 13. and 3. 5.
duties, companies, which sometimes were as a Prison: Acts 11. 21.
Alas, the best Paul and Apollos cannot; often even of their Children or very
Friends, 1 John 3. 9.
not a few remain unconverted, though happily in the mean time God bless their
labors to convert many others; Yea, if an Angel should take a man and carry him
to Heaven, and show him the Joys thereof, and thence to Hell, and show him the
Torments thereof, yet this would not convert him, neither all Mercies,
Afflictions, or Plagues of Egypt: Its a great work of God, and so great, as if
all things were not possible to him; he could not do it; Its a greater work
then the Creation of the World: In that, there was no opposition, in this much:
we have not only no aptness to good, or to be wrought to goodness, but a
violent opposition against it; there but to make the things, here both to put
out the corrupt nature, and to put in the contrary good; then he made all of
nothing, now he makes good of naught. Simile.
As its easier making a thousand glasses, then the setting together one that is
broke; so it was easier (to speak quo ad nos, for all things are alike easy to
God) to make the world, then to repair the broken Image of God in man: Its a
miraculous work of God, greater then any miracles that Christ or his Apostles
wrought; our Saviors several miracles upon the bodies of men, are all done in
the conversation of a sinner; sight restored to them that were blind, and
darkness it self, hearing to the deaf, speech to the dumb, feet to the lame,
Devils cast out, yea many, for the Devil possesses us, and all our Parts and
Members, Hearts, Hands, Eyes, Tongues, Feet, etc. as any Captain holds a
Castle, and has it at command. Thus its a wonderful work of God to see a man's
Soul and Life, Acts 3. 10.
his wit, will, desires, John 9. 8.
affections, and all altered from black to white: It was a wonder to see the
Criple go, and for him that was born blind to see; but its more marvel to see
a man converted: for whereas God gave power to work all these miracles (the
raising of the dead not excepted) to men, 1 Timothy 4. 16.
this of regenerating is his own only: If we find it ascribed to Ministers,
as Paul is said to have begot Onesimus, and as a Father the Corinthians, 1 Cor.
4.
we must not conceive as if it were not proper to God only, but know, that it
is; for that God would keep them the instruments by whom he works from
contempt: 1 Cor. 7. 16.
A good Husband or Wife may be a good means each to other, but have no power of
themselves: Adam could easily cast away himself, but none could restore him but
God only; as a Child of half a year old may break a glass, which all the men
in the Town cannot set together again: Its wrought of God by uniting us to
Christ by Faith, through his holy Spirit, which works this alteration, when
pardoning our sins past, he takes away the guiltiness and punishment thereof
in his death.

Let all that can prove it, Use.
give all glory to God, for so unspeakable a mercy, even that when they were
going headlong to destruction, when as vile as any, he yet called them, passing
by thousands which yet lie in their sins: And for them that can prove no such
thing, let them not delay, nor put off to the last, as the fashion is, as
though it could be dispatched in a trice, or with a wet finger, but seek it both
earnestly and quickly in the means appointed: Why do men think they shall
repent on their death bed rather then now? Is it because the pain or fear of
death will make them? Alas, all the Plagues in the world cannot change a man
without God, and will God be near to work then? Nay, he that was rejected in
health and life, will more likely cast off in death; and if he will not bless
his Word, will he work in the end by other means? This is little better then
Saul's practice, to go to the Devil when God would not help him.

3. That the Lords own will is the moving cause hereof; The Lords will the
cause hereof
As he Elected freely, and gave Christ of his love, so this: Nothing in us
could move him hereto, Iam. 1. 18.
but whom he elected before the world, those does he of the same grace
effectually call and convert, John 3. 16.
which should bind our hearts more effectually to praise and serve him all the
days of our life.

4. That the excellency of this grace is such, Without regeneration, all things
else that we have are nothing.
as all things without it are nothing; If we had the wisdom of Solomon, the
strength of Sampson, the policy of Achitophel, the wealth of Ahasuerus, etc. if
we could measure the Heaven, Earth and Sea, and knew the nature of all
Creatures therein, from the Cedar to the Hysope; nay, if we could understand
the Bible, could Preach never so Learnedly, and had all gifts of knowledge and
utterance, yet were we not born again, all were nothing: Besides, its the more
excellent, both because so rare (only the Elect of God are born again) and
because Eternal. In the natural birth we dye, because born of mortal seed, and
nourished by corruptible food, but they that be born again never dye more,
never come more into their former state, as being born of the immortal seed, of
the Word, and Spirit, and being thereby nourished, are joined to the fountain
of life, Christ: Again, by our first birth we are made miserable, by this
happy; by that sinners, by this righteous persons; by that children of wrath,
by this children of God; by that slaves of Satan, by this servants of
righteousness; by that limbs of the Devil, by this members of Christ; by that
heirs of Hell, by this heirs of Heaven: O happy day, O happy birth; before
Regeneration, Sin and Satan wholly ruled in us, but after, Grace and the Spirit
of God.

1. This should teach us, Use 1.
if we can prove it in our selves to rejoice, and remember our birthday. Many
delight to talk of their age, as others, when, where, and what year they were
born; But can thou tell where and when thou were born again? thou can else
have little joy of thy first birth. The older thou art, the more shame and
greater condemnation if thou art not born again: He that is not regenerate is a
Bastard; for though he have after a sort the Church to his Mother, yet he has
not God to his Father; and though in the Natural birth the Mothers side is the
surest, yet in the Spiritual birth its otherwise: Therefore if thou have Wit,
Beauty, Strength, Wealth, and the like, rejoice not in them, but that thou art
born again; yea, though thou art Poor, Weak, Sickly, yet being born again, thou
art happy: If God has denied thee Wealth and Health, or taken them away, yet
if he has given thee grace, thou art to rejoice exceedingly.

2. It may teach us to rejoice, Use 2.
if we know our children new born: We rejoice at their Natural Birth; but alas,
were not for hope because they be of Christian Parents, we might rather weep:
for when a child is born, there is come a sinner, a guilty person into the
World, one that is in danger of all evil, subject to a great deal of sin and
sorrow, and one that has deserved to be cast into Hell; O therefore, if we
know them born again, there is cause of rejoicing, yea, we must rejoice at the
new birth of a servant or any other as the Angels do: The World likes such the
worse, a sign they are the old men.

3. If we know it not, Use 3.
we are to use the means, bring them to Baptism, after teach them what is fit,
that they may make conscience of their Covenant, and bring them to the Word; if
they be any whit forward, further them, if backward or unwilling, use thy
Authority over them.

4. Rebuke them that desire to see them Strong, Use 4.
Fair, Rich, Healthy, and the like, in the mean time not respecting whether
they be born again or not.

5. He that is not born again, Use 5.
has nothing excellent in him, but abides in death, and is the servant of sin.

5. That its so necessary, Regeneration of absolute necessity.
as without which there is no entering into the Kingdom of Heaven, for thereinto
can no unclean thing enter, and they only which are pure in heart shall see
God: John 3. 3, 5.
We are born impure, sinful, Revel. 21. 27.
defiled from head to foot; while we are in this state, there is no possibility
of serving God, Mat. 5. 8.
as either by thinking, speaking, or doing good; we must therefore be washed
and made clean.

The world imagine no such necessity herein, its a riddle to them, few know
what any such work or change means: They think to be saved by their good
meaning, civil life, and living orderly, O this is sound; if these do not well,
God help us all: Again, though openly bad, if they can cry God have mercy on
their deathbed, they shall do well enough: Here Is no dreaming of a new birth,
of any change in the understanding, will, affections, yea, throughout both body
and soul; Col. 3. 9, 10.
but none of the others will serve the turn, therefore try whether ye be new
born: If we live still in sin (as in lying) its a certain argument we are as we
were naturally, 2 Cor. 5. 17.
He that is in Christ is a new creature, and such a one walks not after the
flesh, Romans 8. 1.
but after the Spirit; if thou art thus, thou have put off thy old
conversation, and put on a new.

6. The effects of Regeneration; The effects of Regeneration.
1. An hatred of all sin, a love of all good. 2. A strife and labor to do the
one, and avoid the other. 3. A See also the notes laid down.
grief. 4. Delight in the Word, Prayer, and Heavenly things, whereas we were
wont to delight in vain and worldly things; so to cry, 2 Cor. 7. 11.
Abba-Father, to love the Father, to desire the sincere milk of the Word, and
to live innocently: If upon trial of thy self by these 1 John 2. 29.
thou find thy self not born again, 1 Pet. 2. 2.
thy case is fearful; it had been better then thou should thus dye, that
thou had never been born, or born a Toad, whereof when its dead, there is an
end; but the man that is not born again while he lives, when he dies, the
second death will lay hold on him eternally; yet alas, a number of old folks
ready to drop into the grave, are not yet born again; What shall become of
these? few men are born again when they become old, which I speak not to
discourage you quite, but to awaken you the more earnestly to look about you;
some were called about the eleventh hour, but let them that have day before
them, not defer or put it to the venture.

6. That the life of a Regenerate man cannot be that it was, A Regenerate man
is not the same he was before.
or as is the life of carnal men, for the case is altered; he is now united to
Jesus Christ as an imp to the stock, a member to the head; by Faith on our
parts, but principally by the Spirit of God: by which Faith we draw, and by
which Spirit is conveyed to us virtue from Christ's death to kill sin, our old
man, and the corruptions thereof, whereby it has a deadly wound given it,
which it shall never recover; so from his Burial, his Spirit conveyeth power to
hold under our corruptions, that they get head no more; so from his
Resurrection, power to rise to newness of life: so that now being graft into
such a living stock, by such a cunning hand of the Spirit of God, the
Regenerate man receives virtue accordingly: He was before a branch of the
wild olive, but now of the true olive, therefore the fruits are and must needs
be accordingly; so that though he sins, yet its not as before: before he was
guided by the Spirit of Satan and the world, now by the holy Spirit of God, and
therefore must needs bring forth the fruits of holiness, Gal. 2. 20.
as it is holy, must needs be renewed throughout, though not wholly and
perfectly.

1. Here Is a great comfort to Gods children, Use 1.
and infinite cause have they to praise God, that whereas before they brought
forth nothing but fruit unto death, now they are enabled to bring forth fruit
to God, and to life; before servants to the flesh, reaping corruption, now to
the Spirit, Gal. 6. 8.
the fruit thereof being everlasting life: There must needs be joy in doing
such work.

2. This condemns them that say they believe, Use 2.
and they are converted, and hope to be saved by Jesus Christ, and yet continue
in their course: No, every one that's in Christ is a new creature; its a
disgrace to Christ to say such fruit comes from him.

7. The growth of one that's truly Regenerate, A Regenerate man grows by
degrees.
he is not at his pitch the first day: Its not with him as with Adam, who was
perfect at once in his creation, but he comes to it by degrees; as every thing
that moves from one place to another, does it in some space of time, so in
this motion from sin to righteousness and life eternal, its done in time, and
by degrees, and that not in all alike: But as some men are of greater stature,
some of smaller, and sometimes the younger are taller then the elder; so it may
be in this: but all do and must grow, and that by the Ministry of the Word and
Sacraments, as Corn by the early and latter rain springs up by degrees: and a
Babe first small and weak, yet by good tendance and Gods blessings grows bigger
and stronger in every part, then can go alone, speak, digest strong meat, begin
to bear burdens, and do the works of a man; so must a Christian grow from a
Babe to be stronger, to digest strong meat (higher Points of Doctrine) to be
able to go alone in good Duties, by the finger, as in Prayer, Reading another
Prayer, but now can go alone in it, so in other Duties; then stronger to bear
Afflictions. Temptations, Mocks, Discouragements, and also to put up wrongs,
and go through duty and service.

1. This may rebuke them that are so far from growing, Use 1.
as they go back, and are worse then sometimes they were. These may suspect
that either they never begun in truth, but were suddenly moved, had but some
common gifts, and were but built upon the Sand; or else that they have ill
behaved themselves, beginning in the Spirit, to end in the Flesh: Were you too
well? what fault found you that you are weary, and gone back to your old
Master? If you belong to God, and do not awaken your selves, the Lord will whip
you home, will send you as Runnagates to the house of Correction.

2. For those that stand at a stay, Use 2.
and no difference can be discerned between that they were many years ago, and
now, they also are in a woeful case. Does not a man look his child should grow
in learning every year, and would it not grieve if he should stand always at
one stay? We love to see our children grow, and would grieve to see them
Dwarfs, and no bigger now then they were many years ago; and have we no care of
our own or their growth in grace? As men every year aim more and more to grow
in wealth: and as in a Race men press hard forward toward the mark, so should
we to grow in grace. But why do men grow no faster? Why men grow no faster in
goodness.
A. 1. Some are proud, and conceited they have more then they have, and so
strive not. 2. Some compare spare no time for this. This is the bane of
Religion, and hinders from many a duty public and private, choking the Word in
the obedience thereto, and practice thereof, and causing many a duty to be but
poorly performed. 4. Ill company is as great a hinderance to Spiritual

And whereas many humble Souls complain that they do not grow, A Caveat for
such as complain they do not thus grow.
though earnestly desirous thereof, and diligent in the use of the means, they
must examine themselves, whether indeed they have used the means, and that
diligently with preparation and prayer; If not, they must reform the same; if
yea, they may be of good comfort, for assuredly they cannot but grow somewhat,
though not as they would: They must yet be constant, and that God who has
given them an heart to use the means of growing, See Wilson of Sanctification,
page 11. 12.
will also enable them to grow: we must be growing as long as we live here. If
we had Methuselahs years to live, and still took pains, yet still there would
be work; so hard is it to get victory over, and to subdue this Army of our
lusts, and to draw dry this ocean of our corrupt affections.

Blessed is he that makes this his chief or only work, to mortify more and
more his sinful nature, applying the Word, Promises, Threats, Mercies,
Judgments, general, particular, on our selves or others: To this end God has
given us many means to subdue them, therefore will be angry if we keep them not
under, and grow especially against our strongest corruptions; they offend God,
hurt us, glad Satan, defile the Temple of the holy Ghost, were the cause of
Christ's death, are of long continuance, and therefore must be put away: And as
we must labor daily to mortify our lusts and old man, so to grow in all graces.

8. The perfection of a Christian: There Is no perfection here in this life.
There Is none here in this life we know but in part; there be still remnants of
sin in us: we are indeed perfectly Justified, not, but in part Sanctified. Sin
and Grace is mingled in every part, 1 Cor. 13. 9.
(not sin in one part, and grace in another) as heat and cold in lukewarm
water, Ephesians. 5. 27.
light and darkness in the twilight: God will have it so to be, Reasons hereof
1. That we might be saved of mercy, and by Christ's merit, and not by any merit
of our own: for if we were perfectly Sanctified here, then should Christ seem
only to Canaanites to the Israelites, or Rebels that make Insurrection in a
Kingdom, but have not the Scepter in their hand, but are subdued in time; and
they dwell in us as unwelcom guests. There is always a Civil war in a Child of
God; two men in one man, the old and the new; two laws, the law of our members,
and the law of our mind: the Flesh and Spirit fight each against other, Romans 7.
now the one prevailing, then the other, Gal. 5. 17.
yet so as the old man grows weaker, and the grace of God stronger. It had a
deadly blow at first, and still languisheth, and is in a Consumption; Simil.
as a Serpent that is deadly wounded in his head, yet wrigles with the tail; or
a Soldier deadly wounded in his brain, yet thrusts with his weapon. The
Scripture speaks of the old man in Regeneration, as if it were crucified and
wholly destroyed, because its so wounded that it can never recover his former
strength.

1. This condemns all Anabaptists, Use 1.
and others that dream of a purity in this life.

2. It teaches us to bear with one another: Use 2.
The husband, though godly, must not look the wife should be without fault, nor
the wife the husband; so the Master the Servant, or the Servant the Master;
there are none without Imperfections: we never read of any, but noted with some
weakness, Christ alone excepted; therefore think it not strange, neither
neglect the graces that be in any for one or more infirmities, so as they grow
to no height.

3. Here Is comfort to those that doubt of their Conversion, Use 3.
because they meet with temptation, and feel sin rebelling in them, and their
corrupt nature lusting after evil. Its not so much a sign you are not
converted, because you have sin (for that's common to all) as that you are,
because you feel it, strive against it and grieve for it: This is indeed a sign
you have the Spirit in you. The godly and wicked sin both, but there is great
odds in the manner; the wicked sin willingly and advisedly, yea, delight in it,
are loath to be hindered from it; when they have done, are not humbled, but go
on therein: whereas the Regenerate sin not with full consent, but haled thereto
by force of temptation, and strength of corruption, being thereafter humbled,
ashamed, grieved. If it be thus with thee, be of good comfort, be still
constant in resisting, use means to subdue the old man, and cherish the new, so
shall you every day get the victory more and more, and when you be overtaken
thus, it shall not be laid to your charge, but pardoned in the Death and
Obedience of Jesus Christ: Neither shall your corruption recover it self again
to rule over you as before, but shall still languish; and this is the cause why
the Scripture speaks, as if our Regeneration were perfect, our old man
destroyed: And at last by death we shall get a final and perfect victory, and
never feel sin more, for with laying down our bodies, we lay down our sin, and
not before.

Not of corruptible seed, etc.] Here is set down, 1. The efficient cause of our
Regeneration, both Negatively; where is showed, what it is not, and
Affirmatively, what is not. 2. The instrument thereof, the Word of God. 3. A
description of God, that he lives and abides for ever.

Not of corruptible seed.] Of mortal seed we are born, Observe.
not born again; Regeneration comes not by nature.
by it we are made Creatures, not new Creatures; we are not born holy, but by
being born again we are made holy: The godliest Saints of God cannot convey
grace into their Children, See John 3. 6.
but sin and nature; Psalm. 51. 5.
whence it is, that even Abraham had an Ishmael, Isaac an Esau: Job 14. 4.
As we are born of our Parents, we are altogether corrupt, our understanding
sees little in heavenly things, and our Reason is an enemy thereto; as that
there is one God in three Persons, Christ God and Man, born of a Virgin, the
world made of nothing, Man saved by the imputed righteousness of another, the
near Union between Christ and a Believer, the Resurrection and last Judgment,
etc. Reason sees them not, yields not to them, nay, being much urged, Mat. 16.
17.
laughs thereat; and that which it does understand, it conceives not as it
ought: the will desires nothing that good is, or at least as it ought, for it
is defiled, and so the whole man. Again, mortal seed begets that that is mortal
only, and not immortal; but when we be once Regenerate, we never dye more, but
live the life of grace here, and shall that of glory hereafter; a final fall,
or the second death can never befall the new Creature. 1 Ioh. 5. 18.


Let none therefore trust in this, that they were born of godly Parents, but
desire God as their Father to beget them anew.

But of incorruptible, Observe.
] Namely, by the Spirit of God, which is the true efficient cause, Gods Spirit
by the word does alter and change man's heart.
who does alter and change our hearts, and conveys power to kill sin in us, and
to quicken us to a good life: Usually these words and the next are put
together, and understood of one thing; namely, that the Word is the immortal
seed of Regeneration, 1 John 3. 9. and 5. 1.
and after a sort it may be so called, but properly the Spirit of God is the
seed, John 3. 5.
the Word is the instrument, and we know the Word of it self can do no such
thing, no more then a Tool can work without the hand of the workman. Joh. 1.
13. is a notable Exposition of this place, where by Blood, and the will of Man,
and of Flesh, the same is meant that here he calls mortal seed, and that
which is here immortal, or incorruptible seed, is there but of God: All Men and
Angels cannot do this, whomsoever God uses as the instrument, he himself is
the worker; therefore is the Spirit compared to water, as washing and making
fruitful, and to fire, as through whom our corruptions are purified.

1. This should stir up those that are born again, Use 1.
to labor with all their might, to show themselves thankful to God, that has
done that for them that their own Father, their Preacher, nay all the men of
the world could not have done for them; and to labor to glorify his name in
all holy obedience all their days, Iam. 1. 18.
for therefore has he done it, that they should be as the first fruits of his
creatures, even set apart for his service as the first fruits were.

2. For those that are yet natural, Use 2.
let them not trust to Ministers nor means, but desire Almighty God to open
their heart, and to work in them that work that may be to their Salvation.

3. Here Is an exceeding comfort to all new born persons, Use 3.
namely, That though they have a corrupt Nature, the Devil subtle, the World
naught, and themselves subject to many temptations and dangers, yet they shall
never fall finally from God; its not possible they should perish, for then the
immortal seed (the Spirit given them, and which is in them) should perish,
which is more impossible then that that should perish, Ephesians. 4. 30.
whereby they are sealed unto the day of Redemption.

By the Word of God] Its the mean to make of the servants of sin, Obser.
the servants of God; Gods word is the instrumental cause of our conversion.
of unclean, clean; of vile persons like Lions, Tigers and Bears, to make meek
humble Lambs; to raise up the dead in sin, and to bring to the Kingdom of
Heaven, which is therefore called, The Gospel of the Kingdom: Romans 6. 17.
See to this purpose Psalm. 19. 7. Isa. 53. 1. Ioh. 15. 3.
Romans 1. 16. 1 Cor. 1. 21. Jam. 1. 18. Acts 26. 18. and for examples hereof,
Isa 11. 6, 7.
Acts 2. 37. and 11. 21. and 16. 30. The Law preparatively makes a way for
Conversion and Faith, Ioh. 5. 25.
by humbling and affrighting the heart with the sight of misery; the Gospel
effectively: This works Faith and Repentance, tells us of the remedy, the
sufficiency of it, and how freely it is offered, then works an earnest desire
after it, and an heart to leave any thing that might let us from it; not that
God is tied to this, God does not always tie himself hereunto.
but thus it has pleased him to appoint ordinarily to work: In times of
persecution he can bless, and does reading of the Word to convert, yea, the
report of private men: So also for Infants he has another way (no less easy
to him, then hidden and admirable to us) how to work in them, as he sanctified
John Baptist in his mothers womb: Luke 16. 29, 31
He has not ordained Angels to come and tell us news from heaven, nor any to
come from the dead with tidings, but Moses and the Prophets, Ministers to open
and apply the Scriptures, and this he makes effectual. Its true, God prepares
men sometimes by crosses, as the fire does the iron, but most are moved
presently at the Word; some by sickness or terror outward or inward, sent of
God, have something brought to their conscience that they have heard, and so
are converted; as others thereby prepared to the Word, and thereupon converted
by it, as by experience has been often found. This is the reason that the
Devil has ever been a spiteful enemy hereto, an enemy to true, sound, plain
and diligent preaching; raising so many Enemies against it, laying so many logs
in the way to hinder the course of it, raising up such in the Ministry as
either preach not at all, 1 Cor. 2. 4, 13.
or seldom, or in the fleshly words of man's wisdom, crying down preaching,
under this or that color, etc. for he knows well that its the mighty Engine to
batter his Kingdom; its that which pulls down the walls of Jericho, 2 Cor. 10.
4.
how base soever in the worlds eyes: Its the strong voice of God that casts
Satan out of his hold and possession, his mighty arm that plucks us out of his
power and Kingdom, and translates us into the Kingdom of his dear Son.

1. This teaches us highly to esteem of it above all other means, Use 1.
not preferring or equalling thereto either Reading or Prayer, public or
private; For what were this but to thwart the Lord? has he blessed these alike
to win souls? If thou sit at home and read, when thou should be
hearing, God will curse thy pride, that think to be wiser then he, or
teach any so to do.

2. It teaches us to praise God for his unspeakable mercy toward us, Use 2.
that whereas most of the world sits in darkness, he has given us the means
of the new birth: If thou art hereby Regenerate, thou art happy, if not, thy
case is hard; then will it profit us, when it has wrought this in us;
therefore pray unto God to continue his Word, and give it power to change thee,
and that he would whet this two-edged sword to pierce through thee, and make it
an hammer to break thy stony heart.

3. They that have it not, Use 3.
should mourn for it, and pray for it, as being subject to perish, Prove. 29. 18.
For where prophecy fails, the people perish: we must pity them who do not
pity themselves.

4. Labor to profit daily by it, Use 4.
for its also for our further building up, and whereby we go on to perfection,
praying that it may be so long continued, till we shall have no more need of
it, or our poor children whom we leave behind us.

5. Pray to God to give it free passage every day, Use 5.
to the winning of many souls, to the accomplishment of the number of Gods
Elect, and let every man further it what he can to the utmost of his power,
herein showing himself Christ's true friend: And let all men take heed of
hindering the same; hinderers are enemies to men's souls, and to the Kingdom of
Christ, and friends to the Devils Kingdom.

Here I may speak how God has appointed Ministers to be the bringers of this
glad tidings, The Ministers of the Word, are appointed of God the instruments
to convert souls.
that converts the soul, and that the Lord uses them as instruments to win the
soul, who are therefore called in Scripture by many Honorable names, as, Men of
God, Angels, 2 Cor. 5. 20.
Ambassadors from God, Spiritual Fathers etc. so, Builders, Laborers, Watchmen,
Shepherds, etc. in respect of their pains; They are appointed over the Lords
flock, they have the trust of Souls, the greatest trust that can be; other
callings are about men's bodies or goods, but this their Souls.

1. Therefore for Preachers, Use 1.
we must be faithful, in token of our thankfulness to God, that has so highly
honored us, and deeply entrusted us, Dan. 12. 3.
so shall our reward be great above others; if we be unfaithful, 1 Pet. 5. 4.
we must look for greater damnation, as being treacherous in so weighty a work.

2. For people, Use 2.
how ought they to regard Gods faithful Ministers, that watch over their Souls?
Alas, how little are they regarded! how poorly maintained? every thing too
much, every little enough for them; whereas Lawyers, Physicians, etc. live
wealthily, are much sought to: Its a plain sign men love their Bodies better
then their Souls, and the Earthly Inheritance better then the Heavenly.

Which lives and abides for ever. Whence it comes to pass, that the Word
works Regeneration.
] These words spoken of God, are to show how it comes to pass that the Word is
able to Regenerate and beget us to a new and immortal life; namely, because it
is the Word of him who lives, and gives life to all, and endures for ever:
If it were not the Word of such a one it could not; for as for the word of man,
it can do no such matter. All the wisdom of all the men of the world put
together, and used to persuade a sinner, are not able to change his heart: The
word of a man can but stir up that in a man which is in him already; but to put
any thing into him that was not in him, it cannot.

1. This teaches us to preach the pure Word of God purely, Use 1.
and not our own Devices: for what is the chaff to the wheat? not any word of
man, this or that (how wise or ancient soever) can put life into a man: So, nor
to mingle man's word with Gods; it has no need of help from man's testimony, let
it alone, it shall be able to perform that which its appointed for. The Word of
God is sharp enough to divide between the joints and the marrow, Heb. 4. 12.
though it be not whetted on this or that man's Grindstone. As Pearls need no
painting, so that which is of incomparable power, 2 Cor. 10. 4.
and is pronounced to be mighty, has no need of the help of weak man.

2. Let him that is born anew by the preaching of the Word, Use 2.
be well assured he shall live and endure for ever, as God so lives and
endures; as every one that is not begotten thereby, shall through Gods
judgment live after a sort and abide for ever, but it shall be in everlasting
woe and misery.

Verse 24. For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of
grass: the grass withers, and the flower thereof falls away. Verse 25. But
the Word of the Lord endures for ever; and this is the word which by the
Gospel is preached unto you.
THe Apostle now laboreth to make men labor for their part in this Regeneration
whereof he had spoken, and that is by showing the miserable state of a carnal
and unregenerate man; and that a man without this has nothing that good is,
nothing that can please God, that can stand him in stead, and bring him to
Salvation; for whatsoever is in man besides this, is flesh, is corrupt and
sinful, and so consequently vain and vanishing as grass; yea, the best thing
that is or can be in an unregenerate man, is but as a flower, that fades soon
away, and cannot abide the heat of the Sun; no more can any thing in an
unregenerate man abide the censure and judgment of Almighty God: and this he
does to drive as well carnal men out of themselves, and make them labor for
this grace of Regeneration; as to stir up them that were Regenerate, to be
thankful to God for this mavelous work, and labor to walk worthy of it in all
fruits of holiness and obedience.

Now having laid out the misery of a carnal men, yet he leaves him not so, but
tells him that there is a means to help this, and to bring him to an happy
state, and to live for ever; namely, The Word of God, which endures for ever,
whereby the Soul is converted, Faith wrought, we united to Christ, and fetch
from him as pardon of sin by his death, and favor by his obedience; so, ability
to live the life of grace here, and the life of glory hereafter. But lest any
should say, But where is this Word that is able to do thus wonderfully for us?
and how must it be dealt with to make it thus effectual for our Regeneration?
He tells them, that its among them; and being sincerely preached, and humbly
heard, believed and obeyed, would become effectual to their Salvation.

In the words we have both the Law and the Gospel: 1. The miserable state of
all unregenerate men. 2. The mean to make us live for ever. Both these are set
down in two Propositions: The first concerning the base estate of a carnal man,
has two branches, one a degree above another; The first, that all flesh (that
is, whosoever is carnal and unregenerate) is grass, that is, frail, brittle,
fickle, perishing, which is not only in respect of his bodily estate, but any
thing else in him. The second, that the glory of man (that is, the best things
that be or can be in him) are as the flower of grass, vain and vanishing. The
second concerns the Word of the Lord, that it endures for ever, and that to
make us live for ever, by uniting us to Christ the Fountain of life.

The words are taken out of Isa. 40. 6, 7, 8. (where note by the way, that no
text is ever cited out of the Apocrypha) the Apostle being guided by the same
Spirit that the Prophet was, looking upon the same sense, not standing
precisely upon the very words.

All flesh is as grass,] Though it be not chiefly meant of the frailty and
brittleness of our bodily condition, Psalm. 103. 15.
yet it is also included; of which a little.

This our life is often compared to grass, Wherein man's life may be compared to
grass.
and that fitly: for as grass is subject to come to an end many ways, so we. It
may be blasted with the East Wind as soon as ever it peers out of the ground;
if not that, yet in the spring the beasts will crop and bite it off; if it miss
both these, yet the mower will cut it down with his sith; if it escape all
these, yet there is one thing coming that it cannot escape, namely, the cold
frosty winter, whereby it must needs wither away: So we may be blasted as soon
as we be born; how many have dyed the same day they have been born, or shortly
after? if we escape then, yet some disease may bite us in our youth; or if we
miss both these, death with his sith may cut us down in our middle age; but if
yet we escape, the winter notwithstanding of old age will wither us away, and we
cannot shift it.

Alas, we are as a bubble, a vapor, of no continuance, so vain a thing is man,
Mr. Midman at that time so killed.
lighter then vanity: A little too much heat or cold, * a little blow with a
Horse foot, a bad savor, or the like, can quickly make an end of us: Alas, we
carry the matter of many diseases daily about us, in our bosoms and bowels;
insomuch that all must dye: Its so appointed, Heb. 9. 27.
It cannot be shifted, Its the way of all flesh, high and low: This grim
Sergeant knocks at every door, spares none, will not be bribed by any, Money,
Physic, Wit, Wealth, cannot free us from it; even Methuselah dyed: They that
have been most unwilling, yet have dyed; where are all our Forefathers? where
all the mighty Monarchs? long since gone, and so must we, there is no remedy:
yet we know not when, to day or to morrow, this year or the next; nor where, at
home or abroad, in our bed or in the fields, by sea or land, nor how of a
natural or violent death: Here to day, to morrow gone; The fairest flower may
be soon welked: A few years ago we said, Our Fathers and Mothers are dead, and
shortly our Children will say so of us, Eccles. 1. 4.
one Generation passes, another succeeds.

1. This may well serve to humble us, Use 1.
pull down our Peacocks plumes: Alas, why should we be proud? proud against
God, as most be to shake off his commandment, to stand in no awe of his Word,
but to do that which he flatly forbids, nay, though he threaten never so
severely? O thou poor Worm, thou Snail, what art thou poor Potsheard, that
dare lift up thy self against thy Maker, the mighty and glorious Lord of
Heaven and Earth? Dan. 5. 22, 23.
should thou not fall down at his footstool, and say, Speak Lord, for thy
poor Creature is ready to do whatsoever thou requirest, as its right meet, and
my bounden duty so to do? proud against our Neighbors, what art thou that
liftest up thy self proudly, vaunting of thy Beauty, Birth, Strength, etc.
may thou not be laid full low ere to morrow Night? what art thou that
treadest others down by thy greatness, may thou not be laid where others
shall tread on thee, and that shortly? what art thou, who so proudly deckest
thy self with endless cost and time? why do thou so gorgeously set out, and
take such delight in a piece of clay? may it not lie by the walls this week?
may not a Tuft of grass be cut down this night? O that there should be such
excess, cost, vain fangles, endless and too much time spent in trimming up the
body, and no care of decking the soul! O this curious and long dressing and
pinning is but for a day! and yet what a great deal of precious time is spent
this way? Also what art thou that bear malice against thy Neighbor, and will
not be pacified, but threatnest to be revenged? Alas poor soul, where may
thou be ere that time? lay down thy displeasure to day, lest thou dye to
morrow, and dye in wrath.

2. This may abate our care for the world: Use 2.
O how do men toil and care, Use 3.
as if they were to live here, and never dye, when as dye they shall, How to be
prepared for death
and that happily very suddenly!

3. This should make us labor, always to be prepared for death: To this end, 1.
Labor to be assured of the forgiveness of our sins, and that the book be crossed,
the reckonings canceled, and God at peace with us; woe be to him that dies,
these things being not discharged: But alas, most as if they were not enough
indebted already, run on more and more. 2. Walk ever carefully in the fear of
God, that we may be found well-doing; but how do most live in sin, that they
are unfit to dye. 3. Be we not fettered nor entangled with the profits,
pleasures, Luke 21. 34.
and excessive cares of this life. 4. Employ we our selves carefully in some
measure about the work whereunto we are called. 5. Wait we for the Lords
coming, being always desirous thereof.

4. It should make us (seeing we be but grass) not to promise great matters of
our selves; Use 4.
We will do this or that, We will be revenged of him ere seven years come to an
end, We will go and buy and sell, and get gain, Iam. 4. 13.
and tarry thus long, We will repent seven or ten years hence: Alas poor fool,
art thou not ashamed to show thy folly? Alas poor Creature, whereof art thou
made? Thou think of heart of Oak, Marble or Cedar, remember thou art but
grass: Reckon not without thine Host, boast not of to morrow.

Be we hereby stirred up to do all the good we can, Use 5.
while we may, and work while its day; Eccles. 9. 10.
If thou have to repent, do it to day, hear this Sermon, Gal. 6. 10.
keep well this Sabbath, thou know not but it may be the last; come this
Communion, thou know not whether thou shall live till another.

6. Never trust to any mortal friends, Use 6.
happily they may be gone when thou shall have most need of them, and when they
might do thee most good; Trust in God that lives for ever, who is Almighty,
ever a merciful Father and a Friend to his: So, make the best use of any friend
while thou have him, People of their good Ministers, Husbands of their gracious
Wives, 2 King. 2. 3, 5.
Children of their godly Parents, etc. Thou know not how soon they may be
taken from thee; we shall hear lamentings after the death of such, buts it more
wisdom to make use of them while they be with us: so for thy Enemies, fear them
not too much, Exodus 4. 19.
they are but grass, they may be taken away ere the time come wherein they
should have hurt thee. Matt. 2. 10.


7. For our Children, Use 7.
delight not too much in them for their beauty, stature, growth, they are but
grass; If we set our mind too much on them while we have them, we will be too
excessively grieved when God takes them from us; love them moderately of Gods
blessings: If we bring them up in the fear as God, that they may prove
gracious, and instruments to honor God in Church and Commonwealth, we do well:
Take heed we prank them not up too much, or too much cocker them, and give them
the head, as David to Absalom and Adonijah; as also that we rake not greedily
for them, and so hinder God of his service: If they be perkt up to high, or
regarded more then the glory of God, its the next way to provoke God to pull
them down.

And all the glory of man as the flower of grass:] Not only the glory of men,
as Nobles, Princes, Great-men, Highborn, Wise, Witty, Learned, and the like,
which are the chief, are as flowers, somewhat finer and fairer then grass in
color, and of them some fairer then some, but even the greatest man is but a
flower, that for all the beauty fades as soon as another: But this is the
meaning, that

The glory of a carnal man is but a vain thing, Doct.
and the best part of an unregenerate man is corrupt; The glory of a carnal man
is but a vain thing.
the best gift is but vain, our understanding not dark, but darkness: The
natural man perceives not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can; flesh
and blood reveals no such things to him: Ephesians. 1. 8.
Our understanding is altogether blind in the first Table, 1 Cor. 2. 14.
unless it be for some few general notions, that serve to leave us without
excuse, as, That there is a God, That he must be served, but what, and who he
is, and how to be served, alas, here we dote: Hence have risen so many thousand
Inventions, Images, Idols, so many kinds of Services in all Nations, Romans 1.
23.
Turning the glory of the incorruptible God, into the similitude of a
corruptible man, calf, creeping thing, etc. In the second Table, God for the
preservation of civil society, has left a little more light to discern between
right and wrong, just and unjust, good and evil, as appears by the Laws of the
Heathens against vices and for virtues, yet herein how blind is carnal man? In
the general he holds adultery, murder, etc. to be evil; but in particular,
lust and anger (practiced by himself) not so, or but a little; but for
concupiscence, original sin, the root of them, alas, this is quite hidden: So
for our will, its altogether corrupt and rebellious; it ought to be guided by
Reason, yet often when Reason speaks, and would guide right, it will not only
not be ruled, but will overruled Reason; as the horses draw Coach and Coachman
over hills and dales whither they list, See Genesis 6. 5.
yea all that is in us is only evil; Our Righteousness is like a filthy clout,
Isa. 64. 6.
we are not able to think a good thought; In me, that is, in my flesh (says
the Apostle) dwells no good thing: Romans 7. 18. and 8. 7.
The wisdom of the flesh is not only an enemy, Ephesians 2. 1.
but enmity against God, and our own conversion and Salvation, and we are dead
in sins and trespasses, and so cannot stand before God; our sins must be taken
away in Christ, and Christ's righteousness imputed to us, and put upon us; we
must also be purged and renewed, Mat. 5. 20.
Either must our righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and
Pharisees (who yet were very strict and civil) or we cannot enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven: What if a man could rule Towns, Countries and Commonwealths,
as long as he has no true rule over his own heart according to Gods Word? What
though a man could compound all the controversies between man and man in a
Country, and were reputed the wisest man therein, yet if he know not the great
controversy that sin has made between God and himself, and seek and know that
compounded in Christ, what would it avail him? What if a man were never such a
skilful Lawyer, and could help every man to his inheritance, if he knew not
that hell were his inheritance by nature, and labored for a better, and for the
same show good evidence? What if a man* were so skilful in Physic, as he knew
the cases and cures of all diseases, if he know not the Spiritual diseases of
his soul, and how they must be cured in the blood of Jesus Christ.

This may stir up all men to examine themselves in what state they stand: Use.
If thou have not felt an Almighty work of God in thee, to renew and alter thee
throughout, then art thou yet but a carnal and unregenerate man, then thou art
in a woeful case, thou have nothing that can please God, what shall become of
thee? rest not in this state: O that people could be persuaded of their woeful
and wretched miserable state, then were it easy to persuade them to seek to
have it bettered! The Lord ferret you out of your holes, and muses that you
have to lurk in: Alas, they will not all hide you from the All-seeing eye and
justice of God: O pity thy soul! This is the first step to Heaven, to know thy
naked case: Take out this first Lesson, Thou can never learn any other till
this be learned; Thou that have not learned this (as most have not) thou have
learned nothing to do thee good by all the Sermons which thou have at any time
heard.

The grass withers, and the flower thereof falls away. Observe.
] Even so whatsoever is or can be in a mere unregenerate man, Nothing in an
unregenerate man can abide the Lords examination.
when it comes to the Lords examination, it will not abide, but vanishes away,
as snow on the Sun-fide of the house, and Butter before the fire.

But the Word of the Lord endures for ever;] Having told them of their misery
without Regeneration, he leaves them not there, but tells them of a remedy: To
what purpose were it to tell one of his nakedness, unless he were also told how
to come by clothing? that he is sick, unless he be told how he may be cured? to
rake in the wound and sore, unless a Plaster be applied? This were but to
increase a man's grief; so to Preach man's misery, and there leave, were to drive
a man to despair, were either to make men blockishly careless what they did, or
desperately to rage, and run into the Gulf of all impiety, seeing there is no
remedy: The Apostle therefore does both, teaching Ministers wisely to join Law
and Gospel together; we must not only tell people of a remedy in general (so
leaving them to se^k it themselves) but prescribe them the way by dutiful
attendance to the Word of God; else they are like to do as sick folks, that
having no counsel from the Physician, take things of their own head, which
rather increase the disease then otherwise, even by some blind courses of
their devising seek a remedy, which will do them no good.

The Word of the Lord is the means appointed of him, Doctr.
to make us live that be dead, Gods Word is the means whereby we may live for
ever.
to convert the Soul, to work Faith, whereby we are united to Christ the
fountain of life: Its the Conduit pipe, whereby God conveyeth the life that is
in him into us; without the Word, John 5. 25.
we are sta^k dead, where that fails, the people perish; without the Word,
Prove. 29. 18.
I say, we are but dead men, and we must dye and perish eternally if it help us
not: But if it be carefully heard, believed and obeyed, it will bring us to
everlasting life, to an enduring state in Grace and Glory.

1. O then, Use 1.
wherewith shall this Word be prized? If even a Soul be more worthy then all
the world, what is it worth that saves Souls? O no marvel though David said it
was better then gold and silver, Psalm. 19. 10. and 119 72, 127.
and sweeter then honey: O how thankful should we be to God for this rich
treasure hidden from most part of the world? he has given his Statutes to
Jacob, Psa. 147. 19, ^0
he has not dealt so with other Nations; what if we had this whole worlds
wealth amongst us, if we had not the Word of God? O what are we, that we should
be preferred before so many great Countries, and innumerable people? O how
great is the unthankfulness of this Land, that set so little by it! why are the
people so shie, and so hardly drawn to the preaching of the Word? Is it not
some great hurt it would do them? Its even this, It would make them of sinners
converted persons, bringing Salvation to their house; of dead, make them alive,
and to live for ever: without it we are sure to dye, and that eternally.

2. To answer the profane world, Use 2.
that wonders at people that take pains winter and summer, to travel and take
such journeys to the Word; they think they be fools, and laugh at them, What do
they mean, say they? What mean they? they seek to have their Souls saved; if
you have any greater business in hand then that, or know a better way to effect
it, then the preaching of the Word, you should do well to set about it: But if
ye do neither of these (as I know ye do not) then cease marvelling at them, and
give them leave rather to marvel at you, that can be so careful for toys, and
so careless of your Souls for the time to come.

3. If we have the Word of God, which is sufficient, and appointed to save our
Souls, then how dare the Brownists separate themselves from us? Peter would not
from Christ, when being asked of him whether he would go away, Ioh 6 68.
Master (says he) whether shall I go, thou have the words of eternal life;
yea, though there may be some things amiss, and where at they are offended, yet
seeing there is sufficient to the Salvation of our Souls, we ought to take heed
of departing from those places where such means are; they will go farther, and
speed worse. Again, whereas they call our Ministers Antichristian, and
B^alitical Priests, etc. what gross wrong is this? will God bless the labors of
such to the winning of Souls? Have not sundry Ministers among us through Gods
goodness been the instruments of converting many to God? 1 Cor. 9. 2.
Paul took that as a good Seal of his Apostleship, that he had been so blessed.

Of the Lord] This is to exclude all men's Traditions, false Scriptures, etc.
which have no such power, and to stop the mouths of Enthusiasts, that depend
upon immediate Revelations from God, as though the Scriptures were insufficient.

And this is the word, Doct.
which by the Gospel is preached unto you.] Where is the Word, The word by
preaching is made the instrument of Regeneration.
might they say, and how must it be handled to make it thus effectual? He
answers, If it be effectually preached, as it is among you, this is the
means; its not in heaven, but among you, and by preaching its made the
instrument of Regeneration: For, How shall they believe in him, Romans 10. 14.
of whom they have not heard; and, It pleased God by the foolishness of
preaching to save them that believe: 1 Cor. 1. 21.
The Eunuch having that by preaching opened and applied to him which he read,
Acts 8 3^.
was thereupon converted; See Neh. 8. 8.
that which could not be done by bare reading, was done by preaching. Its true,
the Word read and preached are both alike apt to convert in respect of
themselves, but not in respect of us; as whole loaves, and bread cut in pieces
and made small, have like nature and aptness to nourish in respect of
themselves, but not in respect of us: for whole loaves will not enter into the
mouth, nor into the stomach; or if they could be there, so fit to digest as
when cut small, yea and chewed, for then its fit: So a sentence of Scripture
must be broken, and divided into Doctrine and Use, then its fit, and not till
then to nourish us; so that the cause why the Word read is not so apt to
Regenerate and nourish us as the Word preached, is not in the Word it self, but
in us, in respect of our weakness that cannot conceive it, nor yet apply it to
our selves.

Therefore they that would have bare reading in Congregations, Use.
and that as sufficient for the Salvation of a Congregation, they are Enemies
to the Souls of Gods people. True it is, the reading of the Word, as well
privately as publicly in the Congregation, is an exercise both holy and
profitable, and has ever been used in the Church of God, and is to this day,
but yet not as sufficient (as the other) to Salvation.

Preached] This he adds, that they might not look that God should speak to
them from Heaven, or by an Angel, he has thought good to speak unto us by men,
whom he sends to preach unto us.

Unto you. Doct.
] In that it was preached as to others, so also to them; note, That the Word
ought to be preached in every particular Congregation; The Word ought to be
preached in every Congregation.
They that have it not, must seek it elsewhere, for it will not avail them that
its preached in the same Land, Country or corner, except they also have it
preached; nor yet will this serve for their excuse, We had it not in our Town:
If light be come into the world, we must seek after it, as men go from Market
to Market for provision.

And if the Word be truly preached in any Congregation, Use.
the people ought in any wise to attend there, and wait for a blessing thereon:
They must not discourage their Ministers through their absence, but rather by
their presence and prayers for them in preaching, and themselves in hearing,
help them forward.

And this is the word, etc. Obser.
] Peter boldly avoucheth it was the Word of God that was preached among them;
The Word must be so preached, as that the Ministers thereof may avouch it to be
indeed the Word of God.
and therefore that they which resisted it, resisted not him, but God: So must
we preach, that we may boldly say thus and avouch it.

Those Ministers that broach Errors, and corrupt Opinions, or that plead for
Baal (for this and that Disorder) or they that bend the edge of their Ministry
against the forward and better sort, and so weaken their knees, Use.
and strengthen the hands of the wicked, these cannot thus say, This is the
Word of God that is preached unto you; God would not have said thus, neither
says Gods Word thus: and they that resist not God, but man, nay, the Devil,
that moves him to utter these things. We ought to take heed, not daring to
utter any thing, but that whereof we may boldly avouch; Thus says the Lord, He
that speaks, 1 Pet. 4. 11.
let him speak as the Oracles of God: But if we speak nothing but the Truth,
and as God would, let all take heed how they shall dare to resist or gainsay
it, or not yield obedience thereto; for he that resists it, despises his own
Salvation, and resists not a mean man, but Almighty God, whose Word and
Ordinance it is to save the Elect: and be sure if it save you not, it will
condemn you, For as the rain comes down, Isa. 55. 10. 11.
and the snow from Heaven, and returns not thither, but waters the earth,
and makes it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower: So shall
my word be that goes out of my mouth (says the Lord) it shall not return unto
me void, but shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the
thing whereto I sent it.

CHAP. II.
WE have finished the former Chapter through Gods goodness; many that heard the
beginning thereof, dyed ere we came to the end, many dead since: We set now
upon this second, hoping for the same assistance; and I pray lets all attend to
the beginning with carefulness, for no doubt sundry of us (so frail are we)
shall never live to the end of it, and therefore are to make the best use of
that we shall hear.

In the latter end of the former Chapter, The coherence of this Chapter with
the former.
he had spoken of Regeneration, whereof he was persuaded many of them were
partakers; now he persuades them to declare and honor that state and calling by
a life answerable, even an holy conversation, both in their general and special
callings, renouncing the sins and corruption from which they were called, and
which became not new persons, and performing all the contrary good duties,
beseeming them that are called to the state of grace and hope of glory.

This whole Chapter contains Exhortations; The sum of this Chapter.
some general to all Christians, from the beginning to the thirteenth verse,
some special, from thence to the end.

In the three first Verses he exhorts as well to the laying aside some
faults, The sum of the first three Verses.
as the performance of a most necessary duty: The faults to be avoided and
abandoned, verse 1. The duty to be practiced, verse 2. Whereunto is annexed a
Reason why they should so earnestly long after, and heartily embrace the Word
of God, even because they had already found some benefit thereof, yea the
special goodness of God thereby, verse 3.

CHAP. II.
Verse 1. Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies,
and envies, and evil speakings: Verse 2. As new born babes desire the sincere
milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby. Verse 3. If so ye have tasted that
the Lord is gracious.
WHerefore laying aside, Doctr.
etc.] Sundry things may be hence observed in general: Regeneration and the
love of sin cannot stand together.
1. That Regeneration and the love of sin cannot stand together, it must needs
be accompanied with a new life: This is the end of our new birth. The life of a
Regenerate man must be a continual practice of mortification, Romans 8. 1.
and study to please God; 2 Cor. 5. 17.
this may be seen from the dependence which this has with the former, Gal. 5.
24.
Wherefore laying aside, Romans 13. 1. 2
etc. as if he should say, Seeing you are Regenerate, and God has done so much
for you as thus and thus, therefore we must lay aside, etc.

1. Here Is reproof for those that bless themselves, Use 1.
as if they were Regenerate and Believers, who do yet still live in their old
lusts; Do Vines bear Haws and Brambles? do men gather Grapes of Thorns?

2. Admonition to all that have proof of this work of Gods special grace in
them, Use 2.
which Man nor Angel could not have wrought, and which is given but to a few,
that they labor to show forth their thankfulness, by renouncing all evil, and
setting themselves on the contrary duties to please God.

3. Comfort to them that do thus, Use 3.
They may rejoice in the assurance of their Regeneration, they have cast off
the work of darkness, put on the armor of light.

2. That there is no perfection here to be attained, Doctr.
for men cannot lay away that they have not, There Is no perfection to be
attained here.
but that they have; even the best have remnants of the old man, they have sin
dwelling, though not reigning in them; they are sanctified throughout, but not
perfectly; so that though it be true, 1 John 3. 9. and 1. 11.
That he that is born of God, sins not, its also, That if we say we have no
sin, we deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us; God will have it so to
humble us, and exercise us in his Word, Sacraments, Prayer, etc.

1. This condemns all such monsters as challenge any perfection or purity here,
Use 1.
whereof have been sundry sorts, raised up by Satan at all times, as the
Pelagians, Catharists, Caelestians, Donatists, Anabaptists, Libertines, Family
of love, etc. a dangerous Opinion: 1. To puff up with arrogance while they look
for inherent righteousness to come to heaven. 2. To drive such into desperation
that feel the corruptions of their hearts rebelling, and cannot be rid of the
same, which yet was the case of Paul himself: We are at the best unprofitable
servants, and while we live shall for many things stand in need to make this
Petition, Luke 17. 10.
Forgive us our trespasses.

2. This must not yet quail or discourage us from this Spiritual combat, Use 2.
but rather set us on work more carefully; for though we cannot overcome in
all, yet we may prevail much; and though we shall have cause to say with Paul,
Romans 7. 24, 25.
O wretched man that I am, etc. yet we shall also have cause to say with him, I
thank God through Jesus Christ; and though we shall have cause to grieve that
we can get no more mastery, yet we shall have cause to rejoice, that we have
attained to that we have, wherein though we have gone on but slowly, yet
sincerely: Original sin is not a cistern, if it were, we would never leave till
by the grace of God we had emptied it; Simil.
but its a spring, when we have pumped out all we can at night, at a Fast, at a
Sacrament, yet it will come in again quickly; there will still be more, whereat
notwithstanding we must not be discouraged, and give over, but out with all
again, for the longer we tarry, the fuller it will be, therefore we are to set
upon it both quickly and continually.

3. That its no easy thing to be a Christian, Doctr.
its no plain, nor easy life or work, To be a Christian, is a work of great
difficulty.
but a very difficult, sore and painful life, for a man to renounce those sins
which be so near to him, and he so wonderfully given to, to deny himself, and
take up his cross, therefore we are bid, strive, Luke 9. 23.
labor, study, give all diligence hereunto, mortify our earthly members, pluck
out our right eye, cut off our right hand, etc. so many affections as be within
us, so many armed soldiers we have to fight against; therefore is our life
compared to a warfare, as who are to fight against three sore Adversaries, the
Devil, the World, and our own Lusts, the worst of all: O how hard it is to
resist the multitude and example of the vulgar and most! how hard to despise
the baits of unlawful Honors, Profits, Pleasures! how hard to overcome the
contrary troubles for well-doing! how hard to resist the Devil! but chiefly our
own corrupt heart is a rebellious traitor, subtle and wicked, which few
overcome, and great is their reward which doovercome.

1. They that find themselves in an easy way, Use 1.
are not in the state of grace: Its easy to follow the course of the world,
and our own will, but he that does thus, is in the broad way; but to deny
these, and obey God, we shall find hard, it will cost much labor, many
prayers, sighs, tears, much hearing, meditation, partaking of the Sacrament,
and the like.

2. For them that wrestle, Use 2.
and find themselves beset, and therefore are fain to take pains, let such be
of good comfort; this is the way to heaven, be not discouraged, go on; the work
is hard, but the crown and reward is wonderful eternal.

4. That under those corruptions here named, Obs.
all others are included, Under those here named, all other corruptions are
included.
and the first word may be taken very fitly for all naughtiness in general, the
rest being particular branches thereof, elsewhere more are set down: Therefore
a Christian must not renounce only some evils, but all, all being hateful to
God, he must cast away every thing that presses down, Col. 3. 5.
we must cleanse our selves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit: Heb. 12. 1.
The Spirit of God, 2 Cor. 7. 1.
and the love of any one sin, cannot be together in one heart; and here he
names only those wherein they were most faulty, and which were contraries to
that love exhorted unto in the former Chapter.

Therefore wheresoever there is the love and practice of any one sin, Use.
assuredly the Spirit of God dwells not in that man, neither is there any work
of Regeneration in him.

5. That most of those here mentioned be inward corruptions, Observe.
which we must as well avoid, Most of the corruptions here named are inward.
as the outward, the sins of the tongue, and the like: Its not enough to pare
away the outward sins, but the heart also must be purged; we must be sanctified
throughout, our whole Spirit, Iam. 1. 26.
Soul and Body, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23.
must be kept blameless.

1. This condemns those that will look to the outside, Use 1.
and yet in the mean time suffer their hearts to boil full of Lusts, and swarm
full of Corruptions, of Pride, Envy, Impatience, Unbelief, and the like, making
no conscience of these; This is an ill sign: These happily may bridle themselves
awhile, but they will surely break out one time or other; if they should not,
yet were they but painted Sepulchers in Gods sight.

2. This may comfort Gods Servants who groan under their inward corruptions,
Use 2.
and when men think they have done well, yet they shake their heads at
themselves, at their dullness to good, at their Pride and Hypocrisy therein, at
their unwillingness thereto, at their wanderings: This is the mind of Gods true
Servants, and this also may much comfort them.

Wherefore laying aside] Now of the vices themselves, or corruptions rather as
they are in the Regenerate.

I remember I requested in the beginning of the Chapter to attend to it,
because we knew not whether we should live to the end of it, or no; and is it
not proved true? Some that were at the first Sermon (there being but a little
intermission from the course of my Ministry here) are now at their long home;
The Author was absent at this time three weeks.
not Ancient alone, but Young and Lusty also, that might have lived to see the
most of us buried: Therefore I see we had need take heed not to Chapters only,
but to every Verse, every particular Sermon, this very Sermon, accordingly
making the best use and benefit thereof, seeing no man knows whether he shall
hear another, so vain a thing is man; and I pray God we may so do.

All malice,] The Word signifies very properly all kind of naughtiness, and
so may fitly here, as the genus of the vices that follow, and all others, and
accordingly speak we thereof. Naughtiness: What is that that is naught? Obser.
and what makes a thing naught? That which is forbidden by God in his Word,
That's naught which is forbidden in Gods Word.
as that is good which he approves; for his will is the absolute rule of
righteousness: who does not see a thing first good, then wills it, but
wills and commands it, and thereupon it becomes good, John 3. 4.
and so on the contrary; and therefore sin is said to be the transgression of
the Law.

This teaches us to examine all things, and knowing any thing commanded, Use.
to conclude that its good, and thereupon to do it; contrarily, knowing any
thing forbidden, that thenceforward we know it to be naught, and therefore
abhor it; for what good can come of that which is naught? and what should we
have to do therewith? The Lords will is a rule of Righteousness, all promises
made to the obedience of it, and all the threatenings and plagues upon the world
have come because of disobedience, that God would have his will, and men will
not, but have theirs. This is the trouble of the world, and that which has
cost the world full dear, yet how few knowing Gods will can be content there to
rest, and say, Now I know this is forbidden, I have done with it, I know this
prescribed, I will therefore obey it? O this were a happy world!

But if by this word we understand malice in particular, What malice is
Its an old grudge upon some wrong done, or conceived to be done to a man,
whereupon he waits to do some hurt or mischief to him that did it.

Anger is like a fire kindled in thorns, The difference between it and anger.
soon blazeth, is soon out; but malice, like a fire kindled in a log, it
continues long: This is often forbidden, Ephesians. 4. 31.
and yet as Esau hated Jacob, and Haman Mordecai; so the world hates Gods
Servants, Col. 3. 8.
as being reproved of them, and who run not with them into the same exce^s of
riot.

1. We ought to take heed of the beginnings of unadvised anger, Use 1.
it rests in the bosom of fools; Eccles. 7. 9.
whereas he that is so slow to wrath is of great wisdom: God is slow to wrath,
and so should we be.

2. If we be overtaken (as a right good man may) take heed it fester not, Use 2.
grow not to hatred, heal it quickly, as we do our wounds: The Devil is an ill
Counselor, cast it out to night, how can you else lie down in peace, or pray?
prayers be lost, and that is a grievous loss: Nay further, Cast it out to night,
thou may dye ere to morrow; and then shall thou either dye in malice, or
else forgive per force, when thou can not retain it any longer, nor any cares
for it; for what needs one care for thy hatred, if thou be once dead? Again,
Mat. 5. ^3.
thou art not fit to come to the Sacrament; not fit to offer thy gift at the
Altar: And to be revenged, what a madness is this? It may be thou do but
imagine a wrong, and then there is no cause, thou dealest unjustly: but if there
be, will thou revenge? Its the Lords office; Take heed of perking up into Gods
place, as if he would not deal equally, either not revenging at all, or not
sufficiently; The Lord knows what is best, let him alone, else thou turnest
off his hand from thine adversary against thy self: Nay, what is this but to be
revenged of God, 2 Samuel 16. 11.
as it were? for has not he a hand therein? Is it not by his appointment? Job
1. 21.


And all guile,] What we are to understand by guile.
Its meant of guile, that is between men and men in their dealings each with
other, as in buying, selling, letting, hiring, borrowing, lending, paying
wages, doing work, partnership, and the like; when men would seem to do well,
but do otherwise; when one thing is pretended but another practiced: Prove. 20.
14.
Guile in the buyer is naught, Prove. 11. 1.
as not to pay, or to pay in ill coin; so also there may be many frauds in the
seller: 1 Thessalonians. 4. 6.
These God forbids, and he is an avenger of such things; we are not born for
our selves, but for the good each of other: we must love our Neighbor as our
self, and do to him as we would be done to; we must not lie one to another,
seeing we are members one of another, as it were monstrous in the natural body,
to see the hand beguile the mouth, etc. and yet how common is this sin? how
does one spread a net for another? not caring how they come by their goods, so
they be once masters of them.

The buyer should look to himself, Object.
his eye is his Chapman, he should have had more wit.

Thou should have looked to him, Sol.
and God will say to thee, thou should have had more love, and more honesty.

Yea, Object.
plain dealing is best, but he that uses it shall dye a beggar.

This proverb was never framed in an honest heart, Sol.
but in an unbelieving and profane heart; Its as much as if we should say, men
should speed the worse for obeying God, and they that dishonor him most shall
speed best at his hand.

We must maintain our charge, Object.
and except we use our wit, and the best shifts we can, we shall not do it.

Says not the Scripture, Sol.
A man cannot be established by iniquity? Has not our Savior promised, Prove.
12. 3.
that if we shall in the first place seek Gods Kingdom, Matt. 6. 33.
all other things shall be added unto us; we shall have that which is meet, and
Gods blessing withal, and that's better then never so much with his curse, an
ill conscience, and the loss of our Souls, God will rifle in it, and scatter it
at his pleasure: What if we get not so much, or so hastily, as they that care
not what they do? (and yet God often crosses such, and has ways to defeat
them, as to bless his servants) A Thief robs by the Highway, he steals Twenty
pounds, sooner then an honest man can earn Twenty pence, what then? would the
true man change parts with him, when he sits quiet on his Loom, or is threshing
in the Barn without fear, whereas the other has the Country raised after him,
and being apprehended is haled to the Goal, thence to the Bar and Gallows?
whose part is best? There Is no less difference between goods well and ill got.

All] This is added to show (lest any should think none but guile in great
matters or measure forbidden here) that there is a through-Reformation required;
Obs.
Therefore it will not serve any man's turn to say, Guil is to be avoided as well
in small as great matters.
My shop is not so dark as others; I mingle not my commodities so much as such
and such; I never deceived in any great matters: All guile must be abandoned of
a Christian that cares for his Soul. A Christian must show forth the truth of
his Christianity in his particular Calling, in his shop, Buying, Selling, etc.
that men may take his word, and believe it, as if they had seen it with their
own eyes, yea, count his words as good as a bond, that they dare rest on his
faithfulness, that he will not deceive: O some smile at this, as if there were
none such, I hope there be some, its pity they be so rare; Its but that every
Christian should do, and must, if he will honor his profession, and do as God
requires.

And hypocrisies,] Not that grossest (as I take it) that our Savior Christ
condemned in the Scribes and Pharisees, and that which is so common in the
world, that come to Church and place all their Religion in Ceremony, and make
no account of the power of any part of it in their lives; and yet of this
hypocrisy Gods servants have remnants, whereby oftentimes they draw nearer to
God with their lips, then their hearts; their knee is bowed, when the heart is
not humbled* the tongue goes, when the soul mourns not unto God: But this
chiefly is meant, What Is here to be chiefly understood by hypocrisy.
when a man is willing to be better thought of then there is cause; when he
hates sin indeed, but not so much as he would seem; so loves good, has some
care in his Family, etc. this often befalls good men, and is for want of setting
our selves in the sight of God nakedly, and looking to him with whom we have to
do: Now he sees what and how we do, so that we are to lay away all approving
of our selves to men, that is not joined with as narrow a care to approve our
selves to God that sees our very hearts, and let us rather do more then is
thought of us, or then we desire should be thought to be in us, then less; that
if we deceive the opinion of men, it may be in the better, not in the worse.

And envies,] What Envy is.
Of this I have spoken in handling the Ninth Commandment: Its a bearing ill
will, and wishing hurt, not for any hurt done to us, but because another man
prospers, or does or is accounted of better then we would have him, or we our
selves are; therefore we seek to disgrace him, cannot abide his commendations,
labor his ruin: Thus Cain against Abel, the Scribes and Pharisees against our
Savior Christ. This is forbidden by the Apostle, and reckoned of him among the
fruits of the flesh. Gal. 5. 21.
The more a man clears before men his innocence, the more is the envious man's
envy fed, whereas were he found blameworthy, this would stanch it: Lay away
all envy, save emulating the grace of others, I mean so far as to strive to
reach and exceed them therein, and all good fruits thereof.

And evil speakings,] What we are to understand by evil speakings.
Namely, against our Neighbor, in slandering, backbiting, reviling, etc.
whereof also I then spoke at large; Whosoever bridleth not his tongue (how
religious soever he seems) his Religion is vain: James 1. 26.
Lets desire therefore, and pray the Lord to set a watch about the door of our
lips. See Iam. 3. 5.
The tongue is a slippery member, as little as it is it may do much good if
well ruled, Psalm. 120. 4.
much hurt, if otherwise; an evil tongue is compared to Fire, a Razor, Coals, a
Sword: these things must be laid aside, not to put them on again at any time,
as men do their work adays clothes, but as Joseph laid away his Prison garment
when he went to Pharaoh, at no time to put them on any more.

As new born babes, etc.] Having prepared the ground, he now comes to sow the
seed; and having purged the stomach of ill humors, he comes to prescribe
wholesome food, namely, the word of God, which he would have them seriously and
heartily to love and long after, and the Ministry thereof, being that wholesome
means of nourishment that God has ordained to this end, that they might grow
and increase from grace to grace thereby, till they should come to the full
measure of their Sanctification which they were to attain unto in this life: So
that in this verse we have the Affection, the Object, and the End; or, 1. A
duty required, namely, to desire after the Word of God, which is set down by a
similitude from children new born: and 2. How the Word of God is described,
namely, from the nourishing nature thereof, its called Milk; the purity, its
sincere Milk; and the end thereof, that they might grow thereby.

He had before willed them to lay aside all malice, etc. now to desire the
sincere milk of the word: Hereby implying, that

The Word of God cannot thrive or prosper in an unsanctified heart, Doct.
neither can a man either affect it, The Word of God cannot thrive in an
unsanctified heart.
earnestly desire it, or truly delight in it, as long as he lives in any one
sin: For 1. The Word of God is holy, and will not abide in an unclean heart, no
more then Rose Water will keep good in a musty or foul vessel. 2. It crosses
all our sins and corruptions; whosoever therefore loves any one sin, cannot love
the Word: Hence it is that so few affect the Word soundly, even because it
crosses that which they love, and so few grow by it, because their hearts be
defiled with some sin.

Therefore let us abandon the love of all evil and sin from us, Use.
if ever we mean to find the Word sweet unto us, or to prosper thereby; so far
does any man profit in the love of Gods Word, as he profits in the hatred of
sin: The best nourishment taken into a corrupt stomach, yet nourishes not; so
its with the Word: The most come to Church with hearts overgrown with rank
weeds more or less, therefore cannot the Word thrive in them; and so the carnal
people of the world receive no benefit after long preaching, and they that have
good things in them, yet when they suffer some corruptions in themselves to wax
too rank, do not thrive in grace.

The duty required is, As new born babes to desire the sincere milk of the
word, so being much conversant both in the hearing and reading thereof.

The desire that new born babes or young children have after their Mothers
breast, Observe.
is 1. Earnest: 2. Constant: 3. Impartial: Our desire toward the word must be
earnest.
Such must ours be toward the Word. 1. Earnest; the new born babe has not
only an aptness to suck at the first, but makes aim at the dug, wrings and
turns the head, and gapes, which is the wonderful work of God, nay, desires it
so earnestly, as it will cry for it, yea and if it has it not, Job 23. 12.
nothing else will still it; and after it has been accustomed thereto, Psalm.
42. 1. and 119. 20, 103, 111, 227.
no dancing, rocking or gingling will still it, but the Big it must have, and
that satisfies it. Such must be our desire to the Word, an earnest fervent
desire, so as nothing can satisfy us without it, Psalm. 119. 98, 99.
but we esteem it above all, both profit and pleasure. Such as be new born do
thus desire it; and no wonder, for it made David wiser then his Teachers, 2 Timothy 3. 15, 16.
his Enemies, his Ancients: It makes us wise to Salvation, Iam. 1. 21.
its able to save our souls; its the instrument to convert, to build up, to
teach, instruct, convince, correct, etc. and to make perfect to every good
work: Every part of it is so holy and profitable, the Promises so comfortable,
the very Threatenings also able to subdue our rebellious Corruptions, and the
Instructions thereof to teach us the way we have to walk in: O there can be no
part thereof spared.

1. This condemns those that have no desire at all to the Word, Use 1.
had as leave be at home, as thereat, no Sermon, but for names sake; that care
not to come to the Word, or if they come for company or fear of the Law, yet
its without any appetite or desire, and therefore they come no more then they
must needs for shame or danger: Tell whether Papists or others amongst our
selves that care not for the Word, of profits or pleasures, they like it well,
but as for a Sermon, they have no appetite thereto, find no savor therein;
some had rather be with their Oxen, and at their Farms, some at Bull baiting,
or some Play; some had as leave be in the Churchyard as in the Church, love the
Word as one would love a Prison: This is a certain sign of carnal persons dead
in their sins; as if a child after it were born, or at any time, should lie a
day or two and make no aim for the Big, would not every body say it were dead?
Many other would seem to desire Preaching, and wish they had a good Preacher,
but in the mean time it troubles them not, they seek not to compass it, nor
mourn for the want, nor will they take pains to stir abroad to hear elsewhere
till they have one of their own: Certainly these men have no life of grace in
them, if they had, they would not only wish for it, but earnestly desire it:
Does the child only sometimes make aim for the big? No, but if it be well it
will cry for it: These profit accordingly when they hear, because they hear not
with a desire; others can be kept from the Word by every trifle, and wonder
that others are not: For this sin of the contempt of the Word, God may justly
visit the Land, as he does every year with one Judgment or other, and why
rather then for this mother sin, and great unthankfulness for this most
precious and invaluable Jewel?

2. It may comfort those that long after it, Use 2.
and so earnestly desire it, as nothing can please them without it; a fair
house, fertile ground, wholesome air, a good farm, all this gives them no
content without the Word, which should sweeten and teach the use of all; O if
they had thought they should not have had the Ministry of the Word, they would
never have come there; and now labor by all means, not coldly, but with
endeavor to compass it, going where it is, till they have it, taking great
pains about it, hot and cold, in winter and summer, a good sign of health of
such as are alive, born again, when men are not held away by any small
occasion, are never so glad as when they are at it, Prove. 2. 3. and 8. 17.
never so grieved as when withheld therefrom. These be they that shall profit.

2. Constant; Constant.
A young child having newly sucked, is quiet a while, but by and by will desire
the dug, and cry for it again, and ever and anon must be sucking: Psalm. 27. 4.
So should we always be desirous of the Word, Psalm. 119. 20.
still hungring after it. Regenerate persons or true Christians desire it again
and again; for why, they seek so much to know, that they desire still to hear
more; they find their Faith feeble, therefore desire more still that it may be
strengthened: They find many and strong corruptions, therefore they would hear
that which might subdue them; they find many doubts and much weakness,
therefore they desire to hear still as often as they can, and all too little;
therefore they think the time long from one Sabbath or Exercise-day to another.

1. For them that care not how little they hear, Use 1.
with whom once a Sabbath is full enough, once a month for a need, yea, once a
quarter would serve the turn; Its a sign of clung and starved souls, for as
they that be in health, must eat often; so they that have spiritual health in
soul, must hear often; Therefore they that loath, and are weary of the Word, its
a sign of sick souls, having no Stomach to this food, its a sign they are dead
at the heart.

2. For those that feel an appetite from Sermon to Sermon, Use 2.
and to hear often, its a sign they see their wants, and find the goodness of
the Word.

3. This may stop the mouth of barkers at such as go to the Word, Use 3.
Why, were you not at Church last Sunday? must you go again to day? must you go
on the week day too? Why, know ye not that growing persons eat often, are often
hungry: They are growing, and therefore that they may grow more, must use this
means; they that see no wants in themselves, a Sermon now and then will serve
their turn.

3. Unpartial; Impartial.
As the child cares not whom it sucks, rich or poor so the milk be good, so
must we not look at the man, or at his outward appearance, so as he deliver the
Word of God soundly, truly, and sincerely, that it may appear good milk.

Many look upon pomp and outward complements, Use.
so as they set light by the Ministry of them that want them, counting them
plain men, simple men to see to; let such know, that not painting of the Cask
makes good wine.

These being the duties of the people, thus earnestly, constantly, and
impartially to desire the Word of God, by the way in a word Ministers must
learn their duty, and how to carry themselves.

1. As the People be the Children, Obser.
so Ministers be the Nurses, therefore they must be no dry Nurses, Ministers
must have store of milk for their spiritual Children.
then the people shall desire and miss, but have full breasts, that their
Children may have enough to nourish them: They must Study, Read, Meditate,
Pray, that their breasts may be full, as good House-holders, they must have old
and new for every bodies turn, Mal. 2. 7.
give every one their portion; and as good Nurses that fear they shall want
milk, eat and drink spoon-meat more then they are willing; so must we study,
against our ease to satisfy our spiritual Children, not woo-meal our Children.

2. Ministers as they must have milk enough, Obser.
so must they have love good store, Ministers must have good store of love.
to lay out their breasts publicly and privately upon all occasions, as the
kind mother that sometimes a whole day together does not pin up close her
things, Acts 20. 31.
but lets her breast always be in readiness. 2 Timothy 4. 2.


3. Ministers must have much patience, Obser.
that though the people, some or all be wayward, Ministers must have much
patience
and take not the breast handsomely, yea, sometime fall out with the breast,
when it comes too fast, and fall a crying, 2 Timothy 2. 25.
as Children do; They must I say have patience, and wait, putting it again in
their mouths, though they cag and puke it up again.

Milk of the Word] The Word is here and elsewhere compared to milk (as to wine
and bread, The Word why compared to milk.
this being to the Soul as those to the body) as in respect of the plainness of
it to young children, Isa 55. 1.
which is therefore opposed to strong meat, 1 Cor. 3. 2.
that is, harder Points, and Mysteries of Religion, Heb. 5. 12.
so especially for the nourishing nature thereof.

1. Therefore they that may hear the Word, Use 1.
and will not, starve their own souls, and are wilfully guilty of their own
destruction; They that take away the Word from any place, pluck away the
childrens bread, and leave the people to perish for want of knowledge.

2. Christians must desire it, Use 2.
and hunger and thirst after it, praying God to continue it, and that of all
punishments, he would not send a famine of the Word: The Soul has a life as
well as the Body, bodily food will do it no good, therefore the Word must be
had.

3. This also stops the mouths of those that wonder at Christians because they
hear often, Use 3.
they can never be content; They did hear on the Sunday, must they go on the
week day too? Did not you eat yesterday, yet will dine to day again? and no
marvel, for you cannot live without it; no more can the Soul without the Word,
the Spiritual food thereof: And though your Soul be a small feeder, and little
will content it, indeed nothing at all, because you have no Spiritual life in
you, yet the children of God that are alive, must have it again and again: We
say, They that are growing must eat often, and are hungry, so must growing
Christians hear often.

Its also compared to milk for the sweetness of it; Psalm 19. 10.
nothing sweeter to a child then the mothers breast, so is the Word to a new
born Christian.

They that feel no sweetness therein, Obs.
their mouth is out of taste with sin, Nothing sweeter to Gods children then
the Word
as they also to whom it seems bitter; contrarily, they that find it sweet,
pleasant, delightsom, yea every part thereof, and to whom even the threatenings
thereof are welcome, as whereby their corruption may be subdued, its an
infallible sign that they are Gods children.

Besides, Obs.
as milk is a general food for all Christians rich and poor, so is the Word the
common food of all Christians, The Word is the common food of all Christians.
the means of their begetting and edifying; the greatest must look for no
other, so neither the poorest, none must neglect it, its the common food of all
that shall be saved: Happy is the Land therefore that flows with Peter's milk
and David's honey, they have the best Spiritual complexions that be fed
therewith.

Sincere] That is, The Word why called sincere.
Pure, Unmixt, a borrowed speech from honey that is not mixed, but sine cera,
without wax; and its so called, not only because its the purest thing in the
world (and therefore we o^ght to desire it the more earnestly) but because
there be such as will deal with the Word, as Hucksters that sell milk, and
mingle it with water; so some mix the Word with Errors, and deliver it not
sincerely, whereof accordingly they were to take heed.

Hereof he had great cause to warn those Jews, because there were false
Teachers, that labored to draw them from Christ altogether; others joined Law
with Christ, as if Salvation were not by Christ alone: This was to put poison
in the milk.

1. This teaches Ministers to preach the Word sincerely without mixture: Use 1.
For matter, all must be according to the Law and the Testimony, and the
Balance of the Sanctuary, so that they may boldly avouch thereof, Isa. 8. 20.
that Thus says the Lord, they must speak as the words of God, 1 Pet. 4. 11.
and his Oracles: And for manner, it must not be carnal, in humane eloquence,
and curious words of man's wisdom; such teaching darkens the Word. The Lord has
left us mavelous things in his Word, Psalm. 119. 129, 130.
and yet in a very plain manner, He says they be wonderful in one Verse, and in
the next, That the entrance into them gives wisdom and shows light: So must
Ministers deliver it in an holy kind of plainness, not mingling therewith
carnal and fleshly eloquence, fine conceits, and I know not what witty sayings
out of Heathen Writers to garnish the same, but handle Spiritual things
spiritually, not being ashamed of the simplicity and plainness of the Gospel,
for this foolish and plain preaching shall be blessed, and be the wisdom and
power of God, when that wisdom shall remain unprofitable and vain; What is the
chaff to the wheat? all that vain Ornament does but disgrace the Word, and it
may be seen that God is displeased therewith, for that he blesses it not to
win Souls, as he does that other which is despised of many of the world, and
counted plain English preaching, a good English Sermon.

2. It teaches the people to avoid all vain and humane corrupt mixtures, Use 2.
accepting only that which is sincere milk: For the matter, They must take no
erroneous Points for truth, but be able (with the Bereans) to try all things by
the Scripture, Acts 11. 17.
and so rejecting the rest, keep that which is good; they that through
ignorance slap us all together, will be poisoned in stead of being nourished:
It is the safest and best diet which is most simple, and therefore some render
this as a reason why our Forefathers were stronger, and lived longer then we
do, even because of the simpleness of their diet; this Spiritual mixture has
been the cause of all Errors, wherein some truth is used to help away the
falsehood: So for the manner, They must affect a plain and Spiritual kind of
preaching, when the Text is clearly opened, aptly divided into his parts, the
Doctrines maturely gathered, strongly confirmed for the settling of the
judgment; and lastly, Uses are made of Admonition, Reprehension, Consolation,
Confutation, together with Exhortation, all applied to the consciences of the
hearers; Oh, this is sweet! Many simple people desire to hear Sermons, stuffed
with sentences out of Authors, and that in a strange tongue, and highly commend
it, though they understand it not; and is not this a great folly and judgment
of God upon them? A number of idle and vain curious heads, had rather hear fine
witty conceits, ancient stories, pleasant discourses, serving rather to tickle
the ear, then to edify the Conscience, such are like those that desire sauce,
and leave the meat. But Preaching was never ordained but to work upon the
Conscience, and in such teaching the true Servants of God find no favor, but
grief; when its kindly, naturally and spiritually handled, then its sweet to
them.

That ye may grow thereby.] Why Christians are to desire after the Word.
The end of our desiring after the Word, of our Hearing, Reading, Meditating,
Conferring thereof, is not that we might get some knowledge to tip our tongues
with, and make our selves the better thought of in some companies, as some do,
or that we may be able to discourse, happily eavil against it, but that it may
work effectually in our hearts, to humble us, to work in us true Faith and
Repentance, and being wrought, may be increased and set forward more and more,
and hereat we should aim at all times; when we read a Chapter, or hear a
Sermon, we must come with this mind, that we may be the better thereby: For
the Word is ordained and is apt and able not only to convert, and beget us,
but also to nourish us, that we may grow up from strength to strength. Ephesians. 4.
11. 15.


1. This rebukes the common sort, Use 1.
that come with no such mind and resolution, as appears by their continuance
in their sins; They will be brought to reform nothing, though they hear never so
often, never so plainly: They come only for fashion, and what Hypocrisy is
this? Yea, also if those that have some goodness in them came with this mind,
and cast with themselves to go away gainers, and it would grieve them as much
to make an ill market at Church, as at London or elsewhere, surely they would
grow and thrive faster in Grace; They could not then fit and sleep, for who
sleeps at his Market while profit drops? Its said of Agustus Caesar, that he
thought that day lost, or ill spent, wherein he had done no good to others; so
we should moan our losses, and think that Sermon lost, whereby something has
not been added to the stock of our Faith, Knowledge, and Repentance.

2. Seeing the Word serves as well to build up as to convert us, Use 2.
men o^ght to attend on the Word Preached as long as they live; Acts 20. 32.
yea, though already they be full of knowledge and able also to admonish of
others: Romans 15. 14.
Therefore they that think they have profited enough, 2 Peter 1.
and now may take their ease and let others hear, they have indeed got nothing
as they ought.

Christians must daily grow in grace; Doctr.
For this as the Church of Thyatira was commended, Christians must daily grow
in grace.
even because their works were more at the last then at the first; So the
Church of Ephesus reprehended for revolting from her first love: 1 Thessalonians. 4. 1.
For hereby as greater glory to redound unto God; 2 Pet. 3. 18.
So more comfort to our selves, more good to others. Rev. 2. 19. and 2. 4.


1. For those that are fallen away, and now are nothing so good as heretofore,
Use 1.
let them consider, that relapses are very dangerous, let them weigh with
themselves, whether ever they began in truth or not; If not, then to begin to
lay the foundation, though they may be ashamed at themselves, and say, Shall I
that seemed to be so forward, begin in a new again? yet better so then to
perish; if yea, then let them endeavor by all means to recover themselves.

2. For those that grow slowly or not at all, many things may be in fault; as
1. Pride, when men think too well of themselves: 2. Worldliness, which the
faster it goes up, Religion goes down, like a pair of scales, or as a Dog
that is following the chase hard, and lights on a piece of carrion: 3. Ill
Company, wholly addicted to their Sports and Pleasures: 4. Neglect of the
means, or careless use of them, as those that have slack Markets prove
Bankrupts; O find out those, and use the means constantly and conscionably,
both public and private, whereby being freed, thou must grow in some good
measure.

If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.] The Reason, They had
tasted the goodness of the Word already, therefore to desire it more and more.

By tasting, What we are to understand by tasting.
he means not such as in Heb. 6. with the top of the tongue as it were, and tip
of the lips, which Hypocrites may have, but an experimental taste upon good
proof; as if he should have said, Seeing you have found by good experience,
that the Word has been effectual to enlighten, convert, comfort and sanctify
you, and the instrument working wonderfully for the Salvation of your Souls,
you are the moreto desire it, and continually show your affection thereunto.
Therefore

Who so have at any time found the Word of God powerful to their Salvation,
Doctr.
as to humble them who before saw no danger, Such as find the Word powerful
for their salvation, are the more desirous thereof and affectioned thereto.
to comfort them when they were in woeful distress, to change their hearts, to
be a word of life and Salvation, they will be the more desirous thereof, and
affectioned thereunto; it will draw their hearts to it, as the Adamant does the
iron, it will ravish them with the love of it; so were David and Job, who found
so much profit thereby: as they are most desirous and greedy of gain, which
have felt the sweetness and comings in thereof; as the Israelites after they
had tasted of the Grapes, could not but desire more after Canaan; so they that
have tasted of the Word, can never be satisfied therewith, but still cry for
more.

1. For those that are much affected herewith, Use 1.
its a sign of much good received thereby: Its true, an Hypocrite may hear it
with joy, and have some flashings, but a constant desire after the Word, with
delight, argues an experimental feeling of the goodness thereof; that heart is
indeed drawn thereby, which still desires more comfort, more instruction, and
more grace from thence.

2. For those that have no desire after it, Use 2.
no delight in it, had as leave be absent as at it, at play or in their Shops
then at Church, that are (as most be) strangers from it; strangers in judgment
(as who cannot conceive thereof, though apt enough to conceive of worldly
things;) strangers in their thoughts (for of those many they have all day long,
fewest (if any at all) be of the Word;) strangers in their affections (as who
have no delight herein, though in other things too much;) strangers in their
tongues (they speak not of it;) strangers in their actions (as not being guided
thereby) their condition is fearful, the Word has not been effectual to their
conversation, and so they remain in the state of Damnation to this hour: John
8. 47. and 11. 27.
He that is of God, hears Gods Word (and that both with affection and
obedience) And his sheep hear his voice; they then that do not hear, are not of
God, are none of sheep: These must desire God to make his Word effectual to
their good, that it may convert them, for then will they affect it.

3. This serves also to stop the mouths of carnal people, Use 3.
that wonder at Gods servants for that they are so fond after the Word, and
take such pains, and that so often; O would you know? they have found it a
powerful Word to pluck them out of the jaws of Hell, and to save their Souls,
that before were in the way of Damnation, therefore do they still desire it,
and can never have enough thereof.

Tasted] A borrowed speech from meats which are discerned by the taste.

Their Souls had tasted the sweetness of the Word, Obs.
and therein the sweetness of Christ, Christ is sweet to a Christian, and
sweetens all that he has
in whom is Salvation, yea and in him only: O the vanity of all things without
him! he is sweet to him that has nothing but him, and he also sweetens all
that we have, without whom we could have but little joy therein.

This condemns those to whom Christ is not sweet, Use.
which favor profits and pleasures, but Christ is a sapless and dry thing to
them: To some he is the joy of their hearts, and their very life, to others he
is of no account; such as have not found their sins bitter, cannot find Christ
sweet, or desire after him: Thus are civil persons, thus profane impenitent
ones, thus worldings; these feel no need of Christ, they desire him not, Oh, it
had been good he had never been offered to these swine that tread him under
foot; Oh, they that hear Christ preached, and have him offered daily, and yet
neglect him, how shall they escape? Is this favor granted to all to hear of
Christ? Alas, no, but to a few; I tell you, those that perish in these times,
shall have the deepest damnation in Hell, the furnace will be made seven times
hotter for those that perish among us, then for others.

Gracious] Great was our Saviors bounty, Obser.
in forsaking the glory of Heaven for our sakes, Christ is every way bountiful
to his.
and suffering so much for us here, without which our condition had been
miserable: He was bountiful of his life, of his blood for us; through him we
are delivered from Hell, and made heirs of Heaven, and was not this bounty? and
not this only, but to reveal all this to us in his Word and Sacraments, which
he does not to the world.

O how should this unspeakable bounty affect us? Use.
all that have found their part therein, how should they be stirred up
unfainedly to be thankful for the same, even to the laying down of their lives
for his sake, if need be? and how should it affect all to desire their part in
this bounty, to find that the Lord is bountiful and gracious unto them? O
happy are they that partake hereof! and they that shall neglect and contemn the
same for profit, pleasure, sin, or whatsoever, will have fearful experience of
Gods severity.

Verse 4. To whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but
chosen of God, and precious; Verse 5. Ye also as lively stones, are built up a
spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifice,
acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.
NOw he sets out the bounty of Christ to all that believe on him, and
consequently, the excellent state and condition of such above all people in the
world.

This stands in these things; Wherein Christ's bounty does appear
1. That he gives them leave to come to him: 2. That having so done, he makes
them partakers of that blessed and spiritual life that is in himself, whereas
they were dead before, and makes them which were an habitation for the Devil, a
dwelling house for the Lord wherein to take pleasure; and whereas before they
were unholy and profane, he being once come to them, will make them holy
Priests, apt to offer such Sacrifices to God as he will accept of by Jesus
Christ.

This he sets out in a borrowed speech, taken from the Temple of Jerusalem,
which was the House of God, wherein he took pleasure, and in which he dwelt
after a sort, A comparison between the Temple of Jerusalem, and that which
Christ makes of all that believe in him.
by manifestation of his favors: As that was built of many fair stones in a
magnifical manner, and in it were Priests that offered sacrifices to God, such
as he required and accepted, such a Temple does Christ Jesus make of all that
believe in him, save that its every way more excellent: The foundation of that
was but a dead stone, this a living stone, Christ Jesus; all the stones of that
(though fair, yet but) dead stones, of this all living, answerable to the
foundation; those joined together with mortar, these by the Spirit and Faith;
that was an Earthly House, this a Spiritual House; there were Sacrifices of the
blood of Bulls and Goats, but these be Spiritual Sacrifices; there the Temple
was one thing, and the Priest another, here the Temple and the Priest are all
one; there the Priest one, and the Sacrifice another, here both are one and the
same.

Now this that he has said concerning Christ Jesus, the foundation of his
Church, and of the good estate of those that be built upon him, he confirms out
of Isa. 28. 16. which accordingly he applies, as well for the comfort of the
godly, as the terror of unbelievers.

For this foundation, consider what he is, and how esteemed: What he is, Christ
why compared to a stone.
A stone, so compared for his firmness, stability and continuance; his nature,
a living stone, whereby he differs from all other foundations: How esteemed of
men, namely, wicked ones disallowed, but of God elect and chosen to be
Mediator, and to the godly precious.

To whom coming] The first privilege, Obser.
he gives us leave to come to him, To believe in Christ (which is to come to
him) is a great privilege.
which is to believe in him, and is indeed a very great privilege: He might
scare us from him (as Adam was kept out of Paradise by the blade of a sword)
but does not, and this is the beginning of all good from Christ, till which we
are never the better for him.

Hence observe, That if ever we would receive good by Christ, we must come to
him.

But how can we come to him, Object.
he is in Heaven, and we on Earth?

Not with our bodily feet, Sol.
but with the feet of our mind and heart, when we seeing our misery, and
finding our selves wholly lost, come to him to seek for Salvation, and rely on
him, and are ruled by him: This is to come to him. Such as go on Pilgrimage
from this place to that, and seek him bodily in the Sacrament, do but deceive
themselves, being thus void of Faith; when they think themselves nearest him,
they are as far off as ever.

To come to Christ and to believe in him are all one; Ioh. 6. 35.
and then we come to him, Doctr.
when we go out of our selves, as being utterly undone, and go to him as an
All-sufficient Savior, Christians must come to Christ.
and rely on him, and are willing to take up his yoke, and forsake all other
Saviors and Lords* and this we must do, because

1. Of our own utter misery in our selves by sin, Reason 1.
punishment, and inability to help our selves out, whereof if people were
persuaded, it were as easy to persuade them to come to Christ, as to persuade
a sick man to the Physician, one overloaden to be eased of his burden, an
hungry man to take meat.

2. In Christ there is sufficient to make us as truly happy, Reason 2.
as we be utterly miserable in our selves, 1 Cor. 1. 30.
Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption: The sinner cannot
complain of any thing, but there is help for it in Christ, do but ask the
thing, and its to be had; Oh, I have deserved the wrath of God and Damnation,
but I (says Christ) have dyed for thee, and paid thy debt; But how shall I
come into the favor of God and be saved? Oh, says Christ, I have obeyed for
thee, and purchased it; But I have no power to do any good? but I have enough
(says Christ) to make thee a Sanctified man.

3. Christ is willing to have us come to him, Reason 3.
and therefore also does earnestly call us: Isa 55. 1.
If one know himself poor, and that such a rich man is both able and willing to
help him, and is also invited of him to accept hereof, will he not thereupon go
to him? so is Christ to us, and accordingly we must come to him.

1. For those that are come to Christ, Use 1.
and do believe in him with their hearts, and are guided by him, they may be of
good comfort, having done what God requires of them, they shall find fruit and
benefit thereby, more then they can express.

This serves to provoke on those that are coming and coming, Use 2.
and yet draw back, set one foot forward, and pull the other back again, fain
would believe, and yet cannot, but fear (Oh, its not for me) and cannot be
persuaded that they be of the number of such whom Christ will save: Why, what
would you have Christ say to you? He bids all without exception, that are weary
and heavy laden with their sins, to come to him, that is, believe in him; its
also the end of his coming into the world: You stand in great need of mercy, do
ye not? O yes, above all the world, and cannot endure to think but that I
should have part therein; and Christ has need of some to show his mercy on,
and therefore calls thee: Therefore as in a Market, one having need of a
Commodity, another (that has it) of money, me thinks these two should quickly
agree, the Buyer and the Seller, who both come for that end; so is it between
Christ and the poor sinner, wherefore else does Christ set forth his stall of
so rich mercies, and call people to them? to send them away empty? no verily,
Christ has said the contrary, and so can as soon deny himself, as not save
thee; therefore believe, John 6. 29.
which is the great Commandment of the Gospel.

Oh, Obj.
but I am so unworthy.

If it be so, Sol.
thou art the more fit for Christ, he came for such, he accepts such. Luke 18.
13.


Oh, Obj.
if I could weep as much as some, or had been so long, or so much humbled, or
could repent and serve God as I would.

What God does, Sol.
he does freely, and when thou can do nothing but feel thy misery, Acts 16.
27.
then believe Christ will save thee: What was the Jailer when he did believe?
believing will break thy heart, and bring Repentence; O that we should so much,
so often, and so earnestly be persuaded to believe, and yet do not. If a King
shall call a poor Subject, Simile.
and reach him a handful of gold, will he draw back, and say, I am unworthy
that he should call me, or I should come to him; What am I? I never deserved
any such thing, etc. If it be great, great gifts become a great God; and seeing
he will do it, hinder not thy self, thou shall be the more bound to love and
praise him here and for ever; yet is it no easy matter to believe: If a man
had this Church lying upon his back, it were not so easy a matter to rise and
stand upright; so, when any have the wrath of the infinite God lying upon their
Souls, what can they do? howsoever, do your endeavor, strive against unbelief,
discern between temptations that come from the Devil, and the promises of God;
those (how many soever) reject as lies, but these apply diligently, stand even
upon one word of Gods mouth, and let that comfort thee more then ten thousand
temptations to dismay thee.

3. This Rebukes the most part of men, Use 3.
that will not come at Christ, though he call them, and offer them wonderful
fair; He bids them come, confess their sins, seek to him for Salvation, and be
ruled by him, and he will take all their burden on him and save them: But how
few give ear to this gracious voice and offer? how many go on, and are not at
all moved, though Christ be preached daily? though they need him, he be
sufficient for them, and willing to do them good? and why? few can be persuaded
of their danger: Civil persons, Ignorant ones, and a number of Worldlings are
so glued to these things, that they savor and mind no other life, nor offer of
any such thing; A number of profane people will not part with their sins,
though to obtain such a benefit; And there be such a number of other Comes,
that calls and carry them away, that though Christ call, Come, few follow him;
The Devil says, Come, and they flock after him; The World says, Come, and
they flock after it; The flesh says, Come, and they follow it thick and
threefold, even striving who shall follow it fastest: But if they had wit to
see whether these Comes tend, they would not be so forward; The Devil calls,
Come, as the Fowler calls the Bird into his Net; The World calls, Come, and
serves her followers as Dalilah did Sampson, and Jael, Sisera; The flesh calls,
Come, but all that follow it shall dye; Rev. 8. 6.
The Harlot also has a Come, Prove. 7. 18.
but her Chambers go to Death and Hell, and he that goes in into her, is led
as an Ox to the slaughter; the like might be instanced of others: So that
Christ by his Ministers might cry, Come, but few hear and follow: O what woeful
unthankfulness is this! Did Christ come down from Heaven to us, and will not we
come to him one whit? Has he taken so long a journey, and come to offer
himself, and do we refuse? O horrible ingratitude! Yea, what mischief is this
to our selves? Is it not to seek our own destruction? If a King should send a
gracious Pardon to a company of Traitors that had deserved Death, and they
should go on and set light by it, would he not send an Host of armed Soldiers
to destroy them? So may the Lord justly deal with us. You are told you are
undone without Christ, that he can and will save you, if you come to him; if
you will not, you cannot but perish, and whom then will you blame? O whose
heart should not leap at such an offer, and coming in, yield himself, and say,
O its the first bargain I Will make, the best that ever I shall make! How many
thousands would be glad to hear such things as these, that do not, nor are
vouchsafed the favor? Do you think ever to have a better offer? to make any
better of your sins, then to renounce them, and embrace Christ? O consider of
this, and renounce all other Comes which you have already followed, and at
last, ere it be too late, embrace this most blessed offer: O fall down and
humble thy self!

O but will he ever pardon and receive me, Obj.
who have been thus and thus?

Its no matter what thou have been, Sol.
not number nor greatness of sins can let, Isa. 1. 18.
if thy heart could be truly humbled, there is the greatest doubt: He as the true
Samaritan will pour wine and oil in thy wounds; He is the true pool of
Bethesda, now the water is stirred, step in, and though thou have been Thirty
and eight years, yea Forty eight and more sick of deadly sin, thou shall be
cured; Christ is a perfect Physician, what disease is there, that he cannot
cure? The Urinals that stand so abundantly in Physicians and Apothecaries
houses may condemn the world, seeing there be so few seek to the spiritual
Physician; labor to see thy misery, understand and apply the Law, to make the
soul sick, as some make themselves sea-sick: When thou art touched deeply with
thy misery, come to Christ, he will do thee good; If being burdened with thy
sins, thou go to the Devil for council, he will tell thee thy ^ins be
unpardonable, no mercy, better rid thy self out of the way as Judas: If thou go
to the world, they will bid thee be merry, and put away these melancholy dumps
and thoughts, Ride abroad, go to Cards, Dice, haunt Alehouses, etc. and go to
no more of these Preachers and Sermons, they put folks out of their wits, that's
the good they do: People that were honest folks, and lived at quiet, since they
have used to go after them, are grown full of fancies: But if you come to
Christ, he will take pity on you, ease, comfort, and save you: O be persuaded,
will you perish rather then humble your selves? will you cast away your souls
for love of your lusts? We will hereafter, for we know that else there is no
Salvation: O that's the Devils word, Hereafter, he knows delays to be dangerous.
Accept it whilst it is offered, lest thou never come to it again; If thou
despise it, thou shall hear a fearful, Go ye cursed; If thou will embrace it,
thou shall hear a comfortable, Come ye blessed. The Lord persuade your hearts,
and cause many to come this day, if it be his blessed will.

As unto a living stone,] The next privilege of a Christian by Christ, is,
that being come to him, he conveyeth of that spiritual Life and Grace that is
in himself into every of them; which is here set down under the similitude of a
building, of which there be two parts: 1. The Foundation: 2. The rest of the
House raised and built thereupon, which be so coupled, as they make but one
building.

For the Foundation which is Christ Jesus, Observe.
he is compared to a stone, because as that's used for a foundation in an house
of moment, Christ the Foundation that bears up his Church.
as being sure, lasting, firm and perpetual: So is Christ Jesus the Foundation
that bears up his Church, and by which it is saved, a sure, firm and perpetual
Foundation, Acts 4. 12.
without whom there is no hope of Salvation, he being the way, John 14. 6.
the truth, and the life: He that brings another Gospel, let him be accursed;
Gal. 1. 9.
If he come like an Angel, spit on his face, defy him to Hell: Adam and all
since have been saved by him, and all that are or ever shall be; what he did,
no other could do, and that he did which was needful for our Salvation.

1. This condemns all that build not upon this Foundation, Use 1.
but on another, either in whole or in part; as 1. The Jews, that look for a
Savior in the Air, that will come they know not when: 2. The Turks, that build
on a deceitful cursed Mahomet, that will never come till he be hailed before
the Judgment Seat of Christ for his Blasphemies. 3. The Papists, who though
they acknowledge Christ in word to be the Redeemer and Savior of the World, yet
they so pull from him, and add to him, as they leave him but a bare Name and
Title; for then is Christ the Foundation and so acknowledged, when we
acknowledge Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption, Satisfaction,
Life and Glory to be in him, and in him alone: Contrarily, they attribute part
of these to their own Merits, Masses, Pardons, Satisfactions, and so they rake
together a deal of Rubbish to join with the Foundation, which will not be, for
he is an whole Foundation or none; of them, some few whose eyes God opens in
their end (as finding no certainty nor sure rest in any thing of their own) do
renounce themselves and all in them, and only lean upon Christ Jesus for
Salvation, and so become happy indeed: They also hold that Peter is the head of
the Church and Foundation thereof, who would not wonder at their wickedness,
when as Peter himself says it here of Christ, and attributes nothing to
himself.

But is it not confirmed by that of our Savior, Object.
Thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church? Mat. 16. 18.


The Question propounded by our Savior, Sol.
was moved to all the rest as well as Peter, and answered of all, though by the
mouth of Peter; Christ's meaning is, That on himself whom he had confessed, he
would build his Church; Would he build it on Peter? then either on his Person
or on his Faith: not on his Person; and how weak was his Faith, which was so
sore shaken by the speech of a Maid? that could be no meat foundation to build
on. 4. Those fools among our selves, who though they acknowledge no other
foundation, yet build not upon him, but on their civil life, their bare hearing
of the Word (which yet they do, because its commanded by Law, and stands most
with their safety, and as the Papists, but for their purse, so they would not
come to Church, but for shame or punishment) their doing as others do, etc.
foolish Builders that build on the sand; their house (as every other that is
not built on Christ by true Faith) how fair soever in their own eyes, will fall
on their heads; if any storm of trouble arise for the Gospel, they will quckly
yield, and change as often as Religion changes; and if no such change be, yet at
death they shall drop into Hell for want of a foundation, as the five foolish
Virgins were shut out of Heaven, for that they had no oil for their Lamps, no
stock of Faith to feed or back their outward Profession.

They that content themselves with any thing, with any gift, before they have
got a true justifying Faith, will fall away, will perish, may prove Persecutors
or any thing: They that so hear the Word, as they never give over till it has
humbled them, and brought them to Christ, and they have found sure foundation
on him, and footing, and grace to be changed; these build upon the rock:
Therefore content not your selves with hearing the Word, nay hearing it with
joy, and reforming many things, nay that you have been troubled for your sins
(as some have wept for their sins at a Sermon, but let it go over, and wear
away, ere they came at Christ) so bearing your selves in hand that ye are
converted persons, for afterward by your falling away, or at your death, it
will prove nothing so, and all for want of a foundation: There be even now
thousands in hell, that have heard as many Sermons as ever you heard, or ever
shall.

2. That Christ is a foundation, Use 2.
and the only foundation of his Church, is no small comfort to all that
believe on him: They may quiet themselves amidst the multitude of contrary
Opinions in the world, or temptations of Satan to make them waver; they may
answer, If Christ be not sufficient to save me, I am content to be damned; I Will
never seek other foundation, you may well enough. Again, being built on Christ,
there be many enemies will lay Battery against you to beat you off; but be of
good comfort, they may shake you indeed, but to overcome you, or pull you off
the foundation, its not possible, Mat. 16. 18.
All the gates of Hell shall not prevail against you, all their power shall not
quail you. As in a City the strength is placed at the gates, as the
Port-cullis, and the Canon to keep from entrance, so if Hell should plant all
its force against a Christian, yea the poorest Christian, it shall never be
able to prevail against him, he is so surely joined to the foundation, by the
Spirit of God that lies so fast; Will Christ suffer his Building to be defaced,
or one member, or the least joint to be pulled out of his body? Christ that
prayed that his Disciples might be kept, John 17 15.
prayed also for all that should believe.

Living] Christ is a living foundation, Doctr.
not only because he has life in himself (as he is the Living Bread, Christ
is a living foundation.
the Truth, and the Life) but because he gives life to others, even all that
believe in him. Hence percieve. Ioh. 5. 16. and. 5. 21. and 11. 25. and 17. 2.


1. That Christ differs from all other foundations, he gives life to his, Use 1.
but whosoever trusts on any other, shall dye eternally.

2. An encouragement for all to come to Christ; Use 2.
He is not such a one as can do them no pleasure, but as he can and will save
them, so he will also put life into them; that whereas before they were as dead
as a stock, to any thing concerning the glory of God, or their own good; no
Wit, Will, Memory, Affection, no Hand, Foot, Tongue, but all were stiff and
stark lame to any good, yea dead; being joined to him, he will make them alive,
2 Cor. 5. 17.
give them Wit, Will, and a Heart to that which is good, Ephesians 2. 1.
so a Hand, Foot and Tongue, yea so change them, that they shall be nothing the
same, but new Creatures. Hence it is, that some that were as very wretches as
could be to their lusts, that loved a Sermon, Sabbath, or good Exercise, as a
Bear does the stake, have yet by the preaching of the Word been brought to
Christ; the case is so altered with them, that now they loath what they loved,
love what they loathed. It is not a strange thing, to see a man that loved
money as his life, and had no savor in any good, to set as light by it as his
shoes, and to love the word that wrought this dislike in him? So for a man that
loved a pair of Cards, and Tables, and to ramble abroad on the Lords Day, and
who could not abide to take a book in his hand, or to be in any Religious
persons company, now to abandon the one, and to be earnestly affected with the
other? yet this Christ works in those that be joined to him: O come to this
Christ Jesus, humble thy self, believe in him, and give over thy self to him,
and though thou be as bad as the worst, he will so alter thee, as thou
may prove a worthy Christian.

3. This serves to uncase a number of Hypocrites, Use 3.
that think themselves stones of this Building, and hope to be saved by Christ,
and to be Believers, and yet have no Spiritual life in them: If you can show me
that Spiritual life that you have got from Christ, to dye to sin and live to
righteousness, then you say something; but there be no dead stones in this
Building, but living, answerable to the foundation: Therefore they that remain
dead in their sins and old lusts, or any of them, Christ and they are assuredly
as yet two, and not one: Show your Christianity by renouncing all ill, and by
your love to good, Prayer, good duties in your Families, and places where you
live, and in all good Works.

Disallowed indeed of men,] Here Is showed how this foundation is esteemed, both
of Men and God: He first speaks of men, and that by way of prevention. The
prevention of an Objection.
No marvel you speak of Christ to be such a Foundation, might they have said,
we are sure, when he came into the world, a number cared not for him, would
none of him, and those none of the fools or simple ones, but Wise, Politic,
Learned Clerks: True, says he; but what then? yet I have that which will weigh
it down, namely, that he is chosen of God, and precious to him, and them that
shall believe on him.

Disallowed he was indeed of men; Christ disallowed of whom, and why.
They called him the Carpenters Son, a Samaritan, Wine-bibber, deceiver; They
would have no other King but Caesar, never left him while they put him to
death, with them Barabbas was meeter to live then he: What was the cause? or
how should they disallow him, when it was so plain that he was the Christ,
foretold by the Prophets, who came at the same time, in the same place, and
after the same manner, whose Life, Preaching and Works did well declare him so
to be, what might be the cause hereof? They looked for one that should come as
an earthly Prince, to deliver them out of the hands of the Romans; but his
Kingdom was not of this World: Acts 6, 14.
They looked also for one that should have upheld their Customs, Law, and
Traditions, but the date of them was out. (See by the way what it is to have an
old conceit settled in ones brain, O how hardly is it removed!) Again, How came
they to this height of disallowing him? at the first of ignorance and
blindeness, but after of malice; so men grow (when they desire not to amend and
see the Truth) from one degree of wickedness to another: The Jews disallowed
him, and do to this day, though the hand of God be heavily upon them, Mat. 27.
25.
according to their own Imprecation, His blood be on us, and our children;
whose case is most fearful: So is the case of all others that disallow him,
whereof there be multitudes among us. Why, nay, all we allow him? O most of
Pharisees disallow him and will perish.

Yes, Obj.
most among Jews and Turks, but all we shall be saved, unless it be here and
there an adulterer, or horrible drunkard, etc.

Consider that of four sorts of grounds (Professors) three are naught: Sol.
O most among us disallow Christ, Mat. 13. 3, etc.
while they will not come to him, embrace him as their Savior, and renouncing
all evil, take up his yoke as their Lord; most amongst us allow a kind of
Christ, but not a true Christ: They allow a Christ that will save them, though
they never be humbled, though they live still in their sins; but Christ is no
such, Christ will save no such: O let all such look to it, that will not come
to Christ as he has appointed; you think the Jews, Judas and the Soldiers have
a fearful account to make, so they have; and how shall they appear before
Christ at the day of Judgment? but even thousands in our Parishes are in no
better case, that break his bonds, and despise the offer of his blood; Such are
all Apostates that have professed the name of Christ, and fall away, all fearful
ones, that deny him out of fear, and all that will not embrace him being
offered.

Disallowed] Was not this no ill sign of Christ that he was disallowed? Doctr.
O no: Such things are often disallowed of men, which are allowed of God.
Even that may be disallowed of men, which yet is allowed, and highly accounted
of of God; nay, the more Spiritual any thing, any course, any person is, the
more and the sooner will the world disallow him and it.

For, they be carnal, therefore savor the things of the flesh, not of the
Spirit; they be in darkness, therefore care not for the light; The more
Spiritual any thing is, the higher is it out of their reach: Those courses and
persons that be carnal, the world allow well of; four hundred false Prophets
maintained at Jezabels Table, Heb. 11. 37.
good Micaiah and Elias abused; John 6. 35.
of those that wandered up and down in sheepskins and goat skins, the world was
not worthy, yet did not the world think them worthy to be among them, Acts 4,
etc.
but thrust them among the wild Beasts: See Luke 6. 22, 23.
Others also were racked as the vilest Malefactors, yea, our Savior himself was
so accounted, Isa. 8. 18.
so the Apostles, men wonder at them as at a thief. Use 1.
Hence learn

1. That we are not to esteem the worse either of our selves or others because
of the worlds mislike; many be so weak, that if they see the most, and
especially any great ones, or any learned cry down a man or an action, John 7.
7, 48.
etc. they are carried away, and open their mouths wide against them; but if
that might have gone current, Christ himself had been naught: we must not go
upon any such rule, but examine whether they be allowed of God, or not; if they
be, then are we not to regard what the world says; The world will prefer
Barabbas to Christ, call evil good, Simile.
and good evil: There Is no more heed to be given thereto, then to be judged of
a blind man concerning colors. As they that have sore eyes cannot abide the
clear light and Sunshine, Luke 15. 16.
so cannot the wicked abide that which is pure and Spiritual, yea, the things
that they highly allow, are abominable in the sight of God.

2. That they which disallow that, Use 2.
and those whom God allows, are in a miserable condition, they cross God, and
he will cross them: The time shall come, when they shall find by woeful
experience, that he disalloweth them, when they shall be glad, and desire to be
in the number of those whom they have most despised, but to no purpose.

Ye also as lively stones are built up,] Now of the rest of the building that
is reared upon this Foundation; Every Believer is a stone of this building, a
lively stone, and all together make up a spiritual House for the Lord to
delight in, as many stones go to the making up of a material House.

Now in that Christ is compared to the Foundation, Doctr.
and believers to stones built on him, There Is a near Union between Christ and
Believers.
it shows the near conjunction that is between Christ and them; as stones are
joined to the Foundation by mortar, so are believers to Christ by the Spirit:
Accordingly he is compared to a head, Ephesians. 1. 22, 23.
and the Church to the body; he to the Vine, and the Church to the Branches: 1
Cor. 6. 15.
Such an Union is between Christ and Believers, as is between the husband and
the wife, John 15. 2.
no more twain, Ephesians. 5. 30.
but one bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh: Before a man have Faith, he
is as a dead stick or stone, by Faith he is united to Christ; which is
signified by these and the like speeches, John 6. 51.
eating Christ's flesh, and drinking his blood, which is to believe in him,
showing that as the meat we eat is turned into our substance, 1 John 1. 3.
and nearly joined to us, so are we to Christ by believing in him: and this is
a real and true Union, but a Spiritual one, not that we are thereby united to
Christ's soul, but to his body also, and by his humanity to his Deity, and by
both to God the Father, and the holy Ghost, which is an admirable prerogative:
If any say, How can this be, Christ being in Heaven and we on Earth? It is so
by the Spirit on Gods part, and Faith on ours; Those join things far distant in
place most nearly together. If any say, I cannot see nor comprehend how this
should be; Ephesians. 5. 32.
If we cannot, no marvel, for its a great mystery which we are to believe and
adore in our hearts. The benefits hereof are unspeakable (as the honor most
glorious) for by virtue hereof, we that were as dead as blocks and stones, draw
spiritual life and Grace to become new Creatures, to dye to sin, and to lead a
righteous life; as the members receive sense and motion from the head, and the
Vine-branches sap from the root: Hereby also we have title to Christ and all
his good things; He also bears our troubles with us, and hereby our souls shall
be as filled with Grace here, so taken up to glory with him at death, and the
body remains united to Christ even in the grave; by virtue whereof it shall be
raised up a spiritual and glorious body to be glorified for ever: And this is
yet so much the more absolute and blessed a Union, because its indissolveable;
No violence of Satan, nor any other Enemy can break off the same: Romans 8. 38.
He has not therefore fastened us as stones into this building to be ever
pulled out any more; 1 John 2. 19.
If they had been of us (says the Appostle) they should have continued with
us: What God has joined together, who can separate?

1. This is for instruction to all that are believers, Use 1.
and so members of this body, stones of this building, that they walk in their
conversation answerable to such high Dignity, to such an Union: The Members
must be like the Head, the stones answerable to the Foundation, as the Fruit to
the true Vine: Take heed they disgrace not themselves and their stock by
bringing forth sour fruit, even of the wild Olive, of their own sinful and
corrupt nature, but mortify the same more and more.

But how comes it to pass that they which are graft into Christ should bear
any sour Fruit? Object.


Even because there are some suckers of our own crabbish and sinful nature shut
out, Sol.
and have through heedlesness and want of care grown apace, and which we must
pluck off by any means.

2. Comfort to all believers; Use 2.
O admirable privilege to be joined into one with Christ, and with God! What
grace or good thing can he stand in need of, that is joined to such a plentiful
and living head? He cannot but mortify the strongest Corruptions, overcome the
greatest Temptations, perform the most difficult Duties; Such thou may draw
from thy head, but make no obstructions by sin: Keep open the passages, and by
the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, and other like means, fetch Grace from Christ
Jesus: He also will strengthen thee, and even in the fiery Furnace be present
with thee, and after take thee up to glory; neither shall all the power of Hell
ever separate thee from him: for though Hypocrites that hang on only by the
untemperated mortar of outward Profession shall fall off, thou that art
saudered into Christ by the Spirit of God shall never be plucked off.

3. To discard all those that profess themselves believers, Use 3.
and stones of this building, and yet have no life in them; let such know, they
have no part in Christ, nor fellowship with him.

4. This should persuade all men to labor to have part in this blessed Union;
Use 4.
Till this be, they are quite dead, and have no more Spiritual Life then a
stone has: If thou be not united to Christ, thou can never have Life of
grace here, nor glory hereafter; And if not a Member of Christ, thou art a Limb
of the Devil; If not a Branch of this Vine, thou art a dry withered stick for
the fire of Hell; If not a stone of this Building, thou art refuse and rubbish
to be thrown into Hell.

Q. How to become stones of this building.
But how should we become stones of this building?

A. By suffering the ax of the Word of God to cut off our knobs, to hew and
square us, that thereby we may be humbled, and mortify all our sins and lusts;
for if there be but one sin in us unrepented of, we are not fit to lie in this
building: And though all stones be not alike, some bigger, some less, some more
costly, some less; yet happy we, if we be any true stone of this building; let
us now suffer our selves to be fashioned for it, Simile.
it must be now in this Life, or never. As there was no hammer heard about the
Temple, but all was hewn in Libanus, so must we be hewn in this Life, that we
may rest in the Spiritual Temple for ever: Having a house to build, will we lay
in a stone rough, as it comes from the Quarry, or a piece of Timber as it comes
from the Wood? See 5. H. on Mat. 3. 10 page 6.
much less will the Lord suffer any to be joined into his Spiritual building,
till they be squared and hewn by his Word: Therefore lets be tenderly affected
one toward another, and build up one another, and do all the good we can one
to another, not living to our selves, or having hand in Contentions, Rents,
Divisions, which do so abound among Christians, and that for toys.

Are built up a spiritual house,] Hag. 2. 10.
So foretold by Haggai; Not a materiel one, as was the Temple of Jerusalem, but
a far more excellent, as much as the body is better then the shadow, which the
Apostle speaks, to take off the minds of these Jews from the material Temple
on which they too much doted, and on the promises made thereto (not considering
that it was appointed but for a time, and that it was but a type of this
Spiritual house, infinitely more excellent) and to labor to become stones of
this Spiritual house, which did so far excel the other.

All the Church of God and Believers, Obser.
make together a Spiritual house; The whole Church makes but one Spiritual
House.
as a house, though it has but one foundation, yet has many stones to make up
the building.

This shows the communion that the Saints have one with another, Use.
members of the same Body, stones of the same Building; with this Union that we
have with Christ, we have also communion one with another, as Fellow Members,
Stones, Branches. Besides,

As all the Saints together are here said to be built up a Spiritual house,
Observe.
so else where the like is affirmed of every particular Believer; Every
particular Believer is also a Spiritual House.
that whereas before he was but a Cage of uncleanness, and a Den for the Devil,
and an Habitation for foul Spirits, now he is made the House of God, of a poor
mortal man, Isa. 57. 15.
an Habitation for God; as a King makes a Cottage a Court, John 14. 23.
so does the Lord make a Bethel an House of God, 1 Cor. 3. 16. and 6. 19.
of him that was before Beth-aven, an house of Iniquity; which is an admirable
advancement. 2 Cor. 6. 16.


1. This teaches every one that is such, Use 1.
to take heed he pollute not himself with any sin, thereby grieving and
wearying so happy a guest. The Prophets were profitable to those with whom they
sojourned; The Widow of Sarepta had her oil and meal increased, 1 King. 17. 16.
and her life saved; 2 King 4. 7. and 4. 17.
The wife of one of the Children of the Prophets had her two Children kept out
of the Creditors hands; The Shunamite obtained a son; but much more profitable
is Christ, he brings Peace, Joy and Life: A pitiful thing that sundry
Christians are so hasty, so furious, so full of pride, worldly, negligent in
religious duties, and the like; How can Christ tarry in such an house? can he
abide in an heart full of these?

2. To deck and trim up the house of our Souls with all graces of the Spirit of

therefore take pains, and think no cost too much in Hearing, Reading, Praying,
to trim up this House for the Lord, that he may take the more pleasure therein.
Solomon bestowed great cost on the Temple, and was seven years in building
thereof, and shall we take no pains on this Spiritual Temple? Hag. 1. 4.
The Lord complained of his people that would dwell in fieled houses, and let
the House of God lie waste; much more may he of us, who mind many earthly
things, and mind nothing so much the dressing up of our hearts by Prayer,
Meditation, Watchfulness, and the like, as a Bride prepared for the Lord Jesus:
When we dress up our houses to entertain strangers, it were good to have such
meditations, Psalm. 24. 7.
saying to our selves, Lift up your heads, ye gates, and be ye lift up, ye
everlasting door, and the King of glory shall come in, and thus entertain him
most respectively here, till he shall vouchsafe to entertain us at our death
into that habitation, that is not made with hands, 2 Cor. 5. 1.
but eternal in the Heavens, and when thou art at the best, think that thy
heart is too strait, nothing good enough to entertain such a blessed guest.

An holy Priesthood] Another branch of the benefit that believers have, being
received of Christ, and united to him, namely, That whereas they were unholy,
now he makes them holy; whereas they might not come near God, neither their
persons nor works, now they are advanced to this dignity, to be a Priesthood,
and every of them an holy Priest to draw near unto God, and offer him
Sacrifices; whereas before they did nor could do nothing but was abominable in
Gods sight, now they are enabled to offer such Sacrifices and Services as God
accepts, and takes pleasure in, and are not these great privileges? and all
this comes by the means of Jesus Christ, whom while they were without, they
missed all these privileges, but having him, enjoy them all.

Holy] They that are united to Christ are made holy, Doctr.
that were nothing less before, Such as are united to Christ are made holy.
and draw sap of Grace and Sanctification from him, through whom also they
become new Creatures; which is a wonderful privilege, that such filthy and
unclean ones as we are by nature, Romans 8. 1.
should be made holy; 2 Cor. 5. 17.
for holiness is the greatest gift that can be, a little of it is better then
all the world: God is holy, his Angels holy, therefore he gives us his Word,
his Sacraments, Afflictions, and the like means to bring us to holiness.

1. They that have any measure of holiness, Use 1.
must acknowledge that they have received it from Christ.

2. Let every one try whether he be united to Christ or not by this mark; Use 2.
he is an holy head, and all that are joined to him partake of holiness.

Priesthood] Believers together make a Priesthood, Doctr.
and every Believer is a Priest to offer Sacrifice to God. Believers are
Priests to God


What, Object.
are not Priests and Sacrifices at an end yet? I thought they had been only in
the Old Testament, and now abolished.

True, Sol.
some Sacrifices are at an end: There were under the Law Priests ordained to
offer Sacrifices daily to God, for their own and the peoples sins, all which
pointed at Christ the true Priest, and that blessed Sacrifice of his Body: Heb.
7. 27. and 10. 2, 10, 11, 12, 18. and 12. 25, 26.
All these Sacrifices did but tend and direct to that All* sufficient Sacrifice
of his Death. Now when he had offered himself on the Cross, and dyed for our
sins, he put an end to all Sacrifices propitiatory, John 19. 30.
as who finished all himself, saying, It is finished; so then, there is now no
more need of Sacrifices for sin, Christ once offered being All-sufficient. Which

1. Condemns the Sacrifices of the Jews, Use 1.
and all bloody Sacrifices, which are to the Devils and not to God.

2. Condemns the Blasphemous Sacrifice of the Mass, Use 2.
where (as the Papists say) Christ is by the Priest offered daily on the Altar
a propitiatory Sacrifice for the sins of the quick and the dead: This is to
overthrow Christ's Cross.

But though there be an end of all legal Sacrifices and Propitiatory, yet there
are Evangelical and Gratulatory; and though those Priests that offered blood
and beasts be at an end, yet are there Priests still remaining in the Church of
God, which the Apostle mentions, lest the Jews should think the former times
better then these; thereupon objecting, The prevention of an Objection.
Have we no Sacrifices now to offer to God? he answers, We have, though not
of the same kind: We have no Propitiatory Sacrifices (the date of them being
out, and which yet were not taken away by men, but by him who ordained them but
till this time, who yet is not inconstant in changing them, Christians now are
not without Sacrifices which they must offer up to God.
as having done away sin through the Sacrifice of his Son, of whom the others
were only the types and shadows) but Sacrifices of thanksgiving we have, and
that for the mercy of God in Christ, and all other blessings flowing from
thence: This is no small honor and privilege. It was an honor under the Law to
be Priests, few were admitted to the Office; they represented Christ, they went
near and offered Sacrifice, the people standing afar off; so is it now to be a
Spiritual Priest, to have the honor to come near to God with comfort and
boldness.

1. They therefore speak they know not what, Use 1.
that use this as a name of disgrace, and call Ministers in derision, Priests;
and what is he but a Priest? but its an honor, and a great one, though
Mass-Priests by their filthy lives have brought the same in disgrace; yet is
not this proper to Ministers only (which we speak not as though we were
ashamed of it, Re. 1. 6
but that every one may have their due) its also common to all Believers, and
they that will none of this, shake off the name of a Christian, but they that
are wise will take their part in it. This is signified by the name Christian of
Christ, which signifies anointed; of that anointing by the Spirit without
measure, he was made and fitted our King, Priest and Prophet, and not so only,
but to make us so; so that every one that believes in him, he gives him the
honor to be so: As we partake of the benefit of his Priesthood, and its parts,
Satisfaction and Intercession, so of him we also are made Priests.

2. As we are to rejoice in this privilege, Use 2.
so we must use it, and improve it carefully in offering Sacrifices; What else
becomes a Priest? he were not worthy the name, that did not delight to offer
Sacrifices to God. The Christians Sacrifices.
Now the Sacrifices of the New Testament for Christians to offer, are these, 1.
The offering up of our Bodies and Romans 12. 1.
and all that is in us to serve God, having neither Wit, Will, Memory, nor any
thing else, but for the Lords use: Its meet we should offer this Sacrifice, for
its his by right of Creation, Redemption, and continual Preservation; we owe
neither it, nor any part of it, to any other, all to him, and when we give it
to him, we provide best for it: Its not only never the further from our
selves, but that is the happiness of it, we should give it, and thank him he
will take it of us; and this is the first Sacrifice to be offered: Till this
be, no other will be accepted of, 2 Cor. 8. 5.
Prayer, Praise, or whatsoever; first the person must please God, then the
work, as in Abel: And thus every man may try his Cristianity; Do you give up
your bodies and souls for his Service, and would not with your good wills that
any the least part should be withdrawn from him, no not one thought if you
could help it? thou art a good Christian, this is a good Sacrifice, continue it
still; But how few do thus? how few which give not their Hearts and Bodies to
Profits and Pleasures, to Sin, the World, and the Devil? How many Sacrifice to
these all day long? Christians in name, not in deed: They that give themselves
wholly to sin are monsters, as they that give themselves partly to God, and
partly to their lusts, are like Ananias and Sapphira: Oh, but though we do not
thus, yet we offer other Sacrifices: Isa. 1. 13.
Fie upon thee and them, they are abominable in Gods sight, as is the Sacrifice
of the wicked: O give them no more as weapons of sin, to serve the Flesh, the
World, and the Devil (that were too too base) but employ them for Gods service,
not some part, but the whole, all too little, and wish it were better Psalm. 51.
17.
comforted in Christ, afraid to offend, careful to please God, touched and
grieved at the smallest offense: 1 Cor. 11. 31.
They that offer this, Prove. 28. 14.
escape Gods Judgment; fearing always, they are happy; fearing small sins, they
escape great ones; being troubled at the least, they rise, and fall not into
security: Such as offer this, and would it were softer, grieving and
complaining of their hardness of heart, let such know, that there may be
hardness as they complain, but not such hardness as they conceive, as who could
not feel the same: But there are few broken hearts in any measure, most are not
troubled for their sins past, nor afraid to offend, nor careful nor humbled
after they have offended, being neither melted by mercies, nor moved by the
Word and Afflictions: O the fearful state of an hard heart; all have not alike
tender heart, but assuredly he is no Psalm. 141. 2.
and all benefits by him past, Heb. 13. 15.
present and to come, for Soul and Body: O what a favor is it, that we worms on
earth may come to the glorious Lord of Heaven and Earth? but where are our
morning and evening Sacrifices? What, a Priest without a Sacrifice? Psalm. 14 2.
They that pray not at all, Job 27. 9.
its a sign they are profane persons, as they that pray only in misery are
hypocrites: Has God honored us to make us Priests by Jesus Christ, and do we
neglect the Office, Heb. 16. 13.
4. Alms, mercy to all in hunger, thirst, Phil. 4. 22.
sickness, prison, especially to the household of Faith: This we ought to do;
whenever God prepares an Altar of the necessity of a poor Saint or Church,
Mat. 25. 40.
that then we Priests lay on our Sacrifice: God requires it, its an honor, he
counts it as done unto himself; therefore he promises that he will requite it,
and that not as we, a penny for a penyworth, but as Kings that use to reward a
house largely, where they have found kindeness; 2 Cor. 9. 6.
therefore its compared to sowing: God and his poor Saints are the best ground
can be sown in: O that we had Faith enough in this Point! If we did believe
that we should have penny for penny, it would make us forwarder then we be, but
he will do more: The world savoreth not this at all, and Believers fall too
short in this Sacrifice; but the more we offer it, and the better, the better
Christians are we. Why called Spiritual Sacrifice.


To offer up Spiritual Sacrifice] He calls them Spiritual, 1. In comparison of
the carnal and bloody Sacrifices of the Law. 2. Because they must be done with
the Soul, Heart and Spirit. 3. Because they must be done by the help of Gods
Spirit.

Our services then to God must be done in a Spiritual manner, Obs.
else they please not God; Our services to God must be done in a Spiritual
manner.
They that give God their bodies, and keep their hearts to sin, perform a
carnal and wicked, no Spiritual service and sacrifice: So we must pray and
praise in a Spiritual manner, with our souls and best affections, John 4. 24.
not with labor of the tongue or knee: True, he will have the Body, but
especially he will have the Spirit, which condemns the cold idle wordy Prayers
of men, wherein there is no Spirit: So our alms and liberality must be done,
not out of ostentation, for company, no nor for a natural kind of pity, but
for love to God, Mat. 10. 41.
because he requires it, and to them, because they are the Lords.

Acceptable to God,] It being a great favor to do any thing that may please
God, The prevention of an Objection.
they might object, as any weak Christian would; Alas, I would go and offer
these Sacrifices, but does the Lord regard what I do? will he once look to such
a one, or such service as mine? Yea, says the Apostle, we may offer up
Spiritual Sacrifice acceptable to God: Gods Servants shall not then need doubt,
but being once Believers, their services done Spiritually are accepted of the
most High God of Heaven, yea, of the meanest true Believer; for he that
vouchsafed to bring thee to Christ, to unite thee to him, to make thee a lively
stone, a Spiritual house, an holy Priest to offer Sacrifice, he will also
accept of the same: Let this encourage us much to these duties, what a spur is
this? True it is, if one knew he should not be accepted; or if he did doubt
whether he should or not; this would take off all edge; but when we are sure,
that's a great encouragement: For who would not be glad to do any thing,
wherewith God would be pleased? Art thou afraid that he does not accept thy
Sacrifice, as who have prayed often and long, and art not heard? Judge not
according to that; Dan. 9. 23.
Thy Prayer sent up in truth, was accepted at first, though not granted by and
by, as not being then time; The Lord stays till a fitter time.

Acceptable,] Not that God has any need of them, but it pleases him for our
encouragement so to tell us; for if we serve him never so diligently, he is
never the better, but our selves are the better, and our Neighbors by our good
example; Job 22. 2, 3. and 35. 6.
So contrarily if we do never so ill, he is not the worse, Psalm. 16. 2.
as being most perfectly holy and good at first, and so is and will be.

To God,] Here may seem a secret Antithesis between these words, To God; and
these, To Men: For indeed

Spiritual Sacrifices are nothing to Carnal men, Obser.
but such only as stand in outward Pomp, Spiritual sacrifices are not regarded
of carnal men.
Show, and Ceremony; But its the Spiritual service that pleases God: He cares
more for a broken heart, and for the Sacrifice of praise Spiritually performed,
then for Thousands of Bulls, or all the outside that so much pleases the eye:
He cares not for the Papists going on Pilgrimage, numbers of Prayers, Fasting
days, Pompous service, and curious music, which does more delight the ear,
then tend any way to edification; And because we reject these, they cry out
upon us, as having no Religion: And are there not some among us, with whom its
a foul matter to neglect any outward Ceremony, who yet do altogether neglect
Spiritual services?

By Jesus Christ.] Doctr.
Our Sacrifices are acceptable to God, nor for own-worthiness, Through Christ
our Sacrifices are acceptable to God.
or the worth of the service, but for the sake, and by the means of Christ
Jesus: He only makes them acceptable to God, 1. In taking away our sins by his
Death. 2. Covering us with his Obedience. Reasons
3. Inabling us by his Spirit (who can do no good of

1. This condemns them that do these Duties, Use 1.
and yet are in their sins unpardoned, not having Christ's Righteousness made
theirs, and which do them not by the Spirit of God, but by their own might;
Their services are abominable.

2. Those that come in the worthiness of any Saint, Use 2.
as the Papists which pray for this or that Saints sake, do grievously sin: Oh,
but say they, he is indeed the Mediator of Redemption, others may with him be
Mediators of Intercession: He is belike beholden to them that will leave him
somewhat; but there is no other Intercessor, but the Redeemer, 1 John 2. 2.
he that's the one, is the other also: Oh, but they conclude all their Prayers,
per Jesum Christum Dominum nostrum. A good mends, when they have robbed him, by
joining others with him, to conclude with his Name; So those that come in their
own worthiness, not asking for Christ's: But we ought not to think of God but in
Jesus Christ coming between. Note further, that

Our works, Doctr.
even the best can never attain to that perfection to be worthy of themselves,

as being still full of imperfection, but by Jesus Christ to all that perform
them in Faith, and to their uttermost they are accepted as perfect.

1. This serves as to humble us while we live under the daily sense of the
imperfections of our services; So, to warn us to shroud them and our selves
under Christ's perfection. Use 1.


2. To comfort them that in Faith strive, Use 2.
and yet cannot perform them to their minds; They must not be dismayed, but
believe that for Christ's sake they shall be accepted: This is necessary to be
known and believed, because many a good soul, when they have prayed or done any
service in the best manner they can, are yet discouraged: Why? nothing pleases
God but that which is perfect, and I know (will such a one say) how imperfect
my poor service is, I cannot in any sort pray as I would, I cannot continue a
short Prayer without wanderings, etc. Well, what thou do, do in truth, and
with all thy might; and Christ's perfect obedience shall make it up; Though thy
service be short, yet it is large enough to cover all; were not for this, we
might be dismayed at our best duties: But this is not for the wicked and
unbelievers, they think they will do as well as they can, and there is an end,
Christ shall do the rest: But what right have thou to Christ? and what can
thou do? as good as nothing.

Verse 6. Wherefore it is contained in the Scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a
chief corner stone, elect, precious, and he that believes on him shall not be
confounded.
THe Apostle having already showed both that Christ is the Foundation on which
his Church is builded, and that Believers are built up on him a Spiritual
House, etc. he now confirms both out of the Scriptures; and needful it was
fully to prove them, that so they might be strengthened to embrace Christ the
Foundation of their happiness, and against that common offense of the
multitude, which did not embrace but reject him.

Now that he had said, he shows to be no new thing, but such as was of old
spoken of by God to his Prophets, as the Scripture of the Old Testament bears
witness, namely, that of the Prophet Isaiah, Chap. 28. 16. wherein is showed of
Christ, that He is a chief corner stone; and of Believers, that they shall not
be ashamed, and therefore are accepted of God.

In that he alleges the Scripture for his purpose; Note we, that

That which must confirm and settle us in any Point of Doctrine, Doctr.
is the Testimony of the Word of God. The testimony of Gods Word, is that which
must settle us in any Point of Doctrine.
If God speak to his in his Word, we build that its true, accordingly doing or
leaving undone; nothing else can satisfy, not the mind of this or that man,
or many men, or the practice of such and such, no not of the best; but we must
build our Faith on Gods Word that cannot deceive us, else shall we ever waver,
never be at a certainty: Through men we may be driven hither and thither, but
if grounded on the Word of God, nothing can remove us.

1. This condemns the Enthusiasts, Use 1.
that boast of Revelations, and so neglect the Word; Isa. 59. 3.
No, Gods Spirit and his Word are joined together, and they that have at any
time been most endued with the Spirit, have at no time neglected the
Scriptures, but given themselves to the searching of the same: Gods Spirit
speaks no otherwise then according to the Word.

2. Papists, Use 2.
that thrust in Traditions and Humane Inventions, as whereon people must settle.

laboring by all means that the Word of Christ may dwell in us plentifully,
that so we may be grounded: If we hear God speaking in his Word, we must sit
down by it, all mouths must be stopped; if not, we must not be carried without
it. Obser.


Again, The Old Testament of the same Authority with the New.
He alleges the Old Testament, as Christ and the other Apostles did, for the
Old was the same in substance with the New, and of the same Authority.

Further, Observe.
In that he names not the place, nor the Prophet, it shows their skill, Of
old people were more ready in the Scriptures then they are now.
and rebukes our ignorance, that have not the book of God clasped against us,
as in Popery, but open, if we can take our time; for the place it self, its
alleged with some alteration of the words, though not of the sense: 1. He
leaves out a word or two, and takes that which fitteth his purpose. 2. He
turns these words of the Prophet, He that believes shall not make haste;
into these, He that believes on him shall not be confounded: The Prophet sets
down the effect, the Apostle the cause; for unbelievers being ashamed, it makes
them run up and down in their misery for some other help, seeing themselves
disappointed and deceived.

The occasion of that promise there, See Calvin on the place.
was to comfort the good in respect of the great threatenings against the bad
and contemners, namely, that they should not be destroyed and cast off among
the rest, and that the wicked might not scorn them, and think all Gods promises
made to them fallen to the ground.

Behold] This being a word to stir up attention, implies, that

What the Lord says, Doctr.
he does; He is true of his word,the Almighty, What the Lord says, he does.
and who cannot be hindered: He says not, Such a stone shall be laid, but,
Behold, I lay it, whereby he confirms the good, and puts them out of doubt, who
by reason of the threatenings were grown weak, fearful, and in doubt.

Here see our infidelity in Spiritual things, Use.
especially if we see any things against us, Luke 1. 18.
such was Zacharias; So was not Abraham, he looked not to carnal lets, but
rested on Gods Word, had enough that God spoke it, so should we: If we have any
promise of Gods mouth, we should be of good comfort, and believe, and not be
dismayed at our sins and unworthiness: Mat. 11. 28.
Come unto me, says our Savior, all ye that are weary and laden, and I will
refresh you, etc. What promise more comfortable? and yet many seeing their sins
and danger, cannot be comforted and persuaded: But we must give God the glory
to believe him on his word, and know that nothing can make him break promise or
change his mind, either any hinder him from performing what he has promised.

I lay] Its God that lays the Foundation of his Churches Salvation; Doctr.
All the Men and Angels in the world cannot lay one stone in this building, God
lays the Foundation of his Churches Salvation.
unto this Foundation: Though God use the Ministry of his servants, Men, to
this purpose, yet its God that by his Spirit makes them fit, Psalm 2. 6.
and couples them hereto; John 6. 27.
therefore much less could they lay this corner stone.

Paul says, Object.
he laid this Foundation.

By Preaching the same to the people, 1 Cor. 3. 10.
not otherwise; That Foundation which God had laid before the world, Sol.
and appointed to be Preached, that he taught to the people, and that was all
he did.

If God gave Christ generally for his Church, Use.
then for every humble soul that sees his need of Christ, and comes with an
heavy heart to him, and desires him above all the world, assuredly he will give
him to such.

In Sion] That hill in Jerusalem is put for the Church, whereof it was a type,
See Psalm, 2. 6. 8.
and because the Gospel was first preached there (Christ there revealed) and
from thence conveyed into all nations far and wide; so that now by Gods mercy,
we have him no less preached unto us then the Jews had, and have also our part
in him as largely. O unspeakable mercy!

A chief corner stone,] A chief stone, a foundation stone: This is the
principal point in this first part of the Verse; but of this on the fourth
Verse, where was showed, That he is not a stone as others be in the building,
but the foundation on which they are all built, which sustains and holds them
together, there being no other foundation but he. This the Papists overturn,
and that both in respect of his Kingly, Prophetical and Priestly Office.

For his Kingly Office, The Papists take from Christ his Kingly,
which is to rule over the consciences of his subjects by his Spirit, and to
have power to make Laws to bind their consciences, they take it from him; for
with them, the Pope may also make Laws of his to bind the conscience, as much
as any of Christ's, and does and may repeal some of his at his pleasure.

For his Prophetical Office, Prophetical,
which is to be the only Teacher of his Church, and to reveal all his Fathers
mind, in the Books of the Prophets and Apostles; this they take away, by
adding (as if the Word were altogether imperfect) unwritten Verities, and men's
Traditions, which (say they) are of absolute necessity to be obeyed to
Salvation.

For his Priestly, and Priestly Office.
they abolish both parts of it: 1. His Sacrifice All sufficient, and once
offered on the Cross for all, by their blasphemous Mass, wherein they offer
Christ daily (as they say) as a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the sins of the
quick and the dead. 2. His Intercession, wherein they join many Saints with
him; What Salvation can there be for such? lets pray for, and keep our selves
far from them.

Elect,] Christ is chosen of God to the work of our Redemption, and furnished
for it; therefore make we choice of him for our portion: woe to them that refuse
him.

He that believes on him shall not be confounded.] Hereby is meant a true
particular justifying Faith: Such as have this, shall not be ashamed, or seek
at any time as confounded or deceived of sufficient help and Salvation;
therefore he shall never be put to make haste to seek any other.

The true Believer shall never be confounded, Doctr.
but find enough in Christ to satisfy him to the full, Believers do always
find enough in Christ.
to deliver him from all evil, and make him partaker of all Happiness, Wisdom,
Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption, Romans 5. 1.
and enough to make his mind peaceable and quiet, and to stablish him against
all that his own conscience, or any, yea the Devil himself can lay to his
charge; but he finds enough to answer all at large; As, Thou art a sinner, and
have deserved Damnation, and God is just. R. I grant all, but I have a surety
able enough, Romans 8. 33.
who has born all; Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? Its
God that justifies, etc. His heart is fixed, he believes in the Lord: In his
life he has that wherein he may quiet himself, and never be to seek, but may
draw new life and grace from Christ, to enable him to hold on: In his death he
shall not be comfortless, but find enough in Christ to carry him to heaven,
though through the gates of death; He knows whom he has believed: At the day
of Judgment he shall not be ashamed, but lift up his head with great joy, when
he shall see Christ coming in great glory and power, to save all them that have
embraced him, and to receive them into the glory which he has prepared for
them; then shall he be our Judge who has been our Surety and Savior:
Contrarily, they that believe not in Christ, are never in quiet; as the
Papists, that hope to be saved partly by Christ, and partly by Works, are often
(even the wisest of them) distracted, The miserable condition of those that do
not believe in Christ, and who they are.
and cannot tell when they have done enough to rest in, and so are ever
suspicious and doubtful, tossed to and fro as one upon a ship mast: So the wicked
among our selves that believe not in Christ (though some securely flatter
themselves) are for the most part doubtful, having ever and anon thoughts that
all is not well, and so not knowing what shall become of them; and though they
love their lusts so well, that they will not part from them for Christ, yet
often do their thoughts accuse them of their Whoredoms, Deceits, wicked
Courses, their hearts misgive them; and so indeed their lives be as if one
should lie in a bed too strait, and the clothes too short, and so they cannot
sleep; whereas he that is assured of his happiness, and his heart witnesses his
upright care to obey Gods will, his bed and clothes be large enough, he sleeps
quietly, and rests on a soft pillow, his good conscience: In the hour of death
they are fearful and disquieted, and in death they are confounded, when they
see the Devil ready to carry their souls to hell. At the day of Judgment, how
will the Jews and Turks that altogether reject Christ, be ashamed and
confounded, when they shall find that their imagined Christ, and Mahomet has
deceived them, and led them into a false hope? O what a case will they be in,
when they shall see the true Christ whom they have rejected come to judge them?
O what wailing will there be? how will they run up and down, and what would
they not do, if they knew any way to help themselves? then shall they find it
too late to sue to him: Rev. 6. 16.
Then will they sue to the hills to fall upon them, and the mountains to cover
them; a poor request, which yet shall not be granted them: So all wicked men
among us that have not kissed the Son, but broke his bands, and cast his cords
from them, that have had him offered to them, but have not embraced him, nor
believed in him, choosing rather to continue in their lusts, then to have their
part in him, their condition is fearful: O that all would embrace Christ whilst
they may, who else shall have sorrow and shame for their portion. Obser.


This phrase also implies, Believers can never fall away wholly nor finally.
That

Believers can never fall away wholly nor finally, as the Papists teach, for
then they might come to be ashamed: They may be shaken for the trial and
strengthening of their Faith, but overcomed they cannot be by all the gates of
Hell.

Verse 7. Unto you therefore which believe he is precious; but unto them which
be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the
head of the corner, Verse 8. And a stone of stumbling, and rock of offense,
even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient, whereunto also they
were appointed.
NOw that which the Apostle had cited out of the Prophet, and was indefinitely
spoken of all and every one, he comes to apply particularly to the Jews that he
wrote unto, both believers and unbelievers, showing the happy state of the one,
and the miserable condition of the other, one and the same Christ being to them
diverse: To Believers, precious, and fruitful to Salvation and all good; but to
the unbelievers and disobedient, a stone to stumble at, etc. though not of his
own Nature, yet through their infidelity, so that they should not only have no
benefit by him, but destruction, stumbling at the word that foretold of him,
and now testified of him. But least any should wonder at this madness in men,
the cause is set down, that as God ordained some to life, and so to embrace
Christ unto Salvation, so some others to stumble against him to their ruin:
Besides this, he also removes a common and great scandal and log out of the
weak and common peoples way, and that was, that whereas he had spoken so much
of Christ, they could not see him to be such a one: and their learned Doctors
and Rabbis, Scribes and Pharisees, High Priests and Elders, they could no way
think well of him, they judged him a deceiver, and pursued him also, which they
would never have done, if he had been the Savior and corner stone, as you
speak, etc. But for this, faith the Apostle, If it were a new thing, that you
never had had warning of, it were somewhat; but this is no other then was
foretold in David's time, Psalm 118. 22.
so long ago, therefore it needs not seem strange to you; yet their struggling
was in vain, for in despite of them he was made the head stone of the corner:
This had been indeed a great temptation, if they had been to consult only with
reason; For what should they have thought, but as they were taught and learned
of their gave Teachers, of whom that People had a very great and high opinion;
But considering Gods decree, and that he had foretold it should be thus, and
that God would save his Church by such a way that worldly wise men thought not
of, and would effect his purpose not only without the help, but even against
the will of the great men of the world, it could not much trouble them.

And in that the Apostle does apply that which was indifinitely said of all to
particular persons, Observe.
we may learn how to use the promises of God laid down in Scripture, Gods
promises are to be particularly applied.
even to endeavor to apply them to our selves particularly; This is the nature
of true Faith: Its but a cold and dead thing to believe those things in general
to be true, which Hypocrites, yea Devils do; but this to make them ours, as
David, Psalm. 18. 2.
My Lord, My Castle, My Refuge; and Job, My Redeemer; and Thomas, Job 19. 25.
My Lord and my God; John 20. 28.
and Paul, Who loved me, and gave himself for me, Gal. 2. 20.
is that we must labor for: This particular Faith is that which is to
Salvation, signified by eating and drinking: and Faith is compared to an hand;
and in our Creed every one of us is particularly bound from our hearts, to say,
I believe.

How may we come to this particular persuasion? Quest.


A person humbled, Answ.
and seeking earnestly, God sends his Spirit to witness to his of the same,
Romans 8. 16.
wherewith (that it may appear that its no presumption nor deceiveable
persuasion) he gives also the Spirit of Sanctification, namely, an unfeigned
hatred of all sin, and true purpose to please God; and whose finds these, may
boldy build hereon: And though there will arise, through remnants of unbelief,
sometimes doubtings and fears, yet this grace of Faith rooted in the heart,
will never quite fail; Psalm. 22. 1.
as, My God, my God, why have thou for saken me? The last words savor of
distrust or despair, but yet so, as Faith still held her hold: So is it with
every Believer in their temptations; though they speak some words of doubting,
yet some do come out by and by, that do argue a measure of true Faith: O lets
never leave till we have a particular persuasion, and that upon good ground,
that the promises of salvation especially (and other particulars) belong to us;
some think they do, and are very bold, that yet can render no reason thereof,
but their persuasion is vain: some being put to particulars, can say nothing
thereto, and so can never have comfort or joy while they live.

Unto you which believe he is precious,] He says not only that Christ is most
blessed and good in himself, but that that which is in him is to be
communicated to others, or else what were it to us? nay, he shows also by
what means others may be partakers hereof, namely, by Faith; For what were it,
though there were never so much in Christ, and that for others too, if we knew
not the way to come by it? therefore he tells us, its made ours by Faith: As,
what were it if there were never so much water in a Well, and no bucket to draw
it out? or a very good Medicine, and no knowledge how to use it?

But Christ is precious to those that believe in him; Doctr.
They shall be partakers of all that is in Christ whatsoever, Christ is
precious unto all those that believe.
Pardon, Grace, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, Redemption, Life and
Glory is in him, or to be had by him, is ours by Faith, and no other way: If
there be never so much in Christ, yet to the unbeliever it avails nothing, John
1. 12.
he shall not have a dram of benefit by him; Therefore Faith is compared to an
hand to lay hold on Christ, to a mouth to feed on Christ, etc. As a man's hand
chopped off can take nothing, his mouth closed up can eat nothing, so without
Faith, no benefit by Christ; for Faith is the only instrument that God has
ordained to convey all grace from Christ into us.

1. Here Is comfort to all such as can prove themselves believers. Use 1.


2. Labor we for this grace of true Faith, Use 2.
which intitles us to Christ, and makes him ours, without which he will be a
rock of offense to our condemnation: This Faith is not every idle persuasion of
the brain of a carnal professor without ground, and never humbled, or any whit
reformed, but it must be a work of the Spirit of God, which has so much
depending upon it, which few truly enjoy: And the rather are we to labor for
this grace, because as it makes Christ ours, so all things else to work to our
good, without which all turn to our destruction. Romans 1. 16.
As the Word by Faith is the power of God to Salvation, and the savor of life
unto life; so is it to unbelievers the contrary, even to their Condemnation; as
the sunshine to good eyes is comfortable, but to weak and blear eyes offensive
and hurtful: Thus are all other holy things; Thus the Sacrament; Thus also our
meat and drink, etc. To believers that are not only persuaded by the Word,
that they are Gods creatures appointed to nourish us, but that we be such as
having lost our interest in Adam, have it restored in Christ; we using them
also with prayer, may with good consciences make use of them, whereof those
that have not this Faith are usurpers: Yea, that which is a part of the curse
in its own nature, yet by Faith is made a blessing; as our sicknesses, crosses
and troubles which came in with sin as punishments, Romans 8. 28.
yet to believers, them that love God, all things (even these) work together
for the best; but to unbelievers they are the beginning of their sorrows. And

As Christ in our sense is precious to the Believers, namely, that they make
most precious and high account of him, and so of the means that have brought
them to him, the Word, and the means that yet still bring them tidings of him,
the Word and Sacraments; so also in this, that he is fruitful and blessed to
them: Therefore never leave till we be in the number of these believers.

But unto them which be disobedient, etc.] now to the other sort: The true and
direct opposition had been to have said, But to the unbelievers; Why then not
so, but to the disobedient? namely, to show who they be that be unbelievers,
Obs.
by the effect, disobedience: For as Faith is the mother of obedience, Such are
unbeleivers which are disobedient
so Infidelity the mother of disobedience and rebellion: Unbelief has the seat
in the heart, who then can know it? the Lord who sees it, shows that they
which be disobedient to the Word be unbelievers.

Hereby may every man try himself, Use.
whether he be in the state of unbelief or not; Thou art, if thou be in the
state of disobedience. Thus are they that live in the open breach of Gods Law,
and are tainted with foul sins; See also John 3. 36.
they are in unbelief to this hour, whom (if they should thus dye) this
Scripture would send headlong to destruction: Thus are they, who though they
reform some, yea many things, yet maintain themselves in the love and practice
of some one sin, either by doing some forbidden evil, or neglecting some known
required duty, which they will not reform, nor desire to do: Let these know
(whatsoever they are) that they are in unbelief until this hour, and so stand
in the state of wrath and condemnation: O that this might awaken all our carnal
Professors that bear themselves in hand that they have Faith, when they have
nothing toward it; no, it must cost you more then ever yet it did, ere you
enjoy it, and must be showed forth by better fruits.

Now before he comes to show directly what Christ is to the unbelievers, he
does by the way remove a stumbling block.

The stone which the builders disallowed, is made the head of the corner.] This
Text alleged out of the Psalms, Psalm. 118. 22.
is meant 1. Of David, who by Saul's Courtiers was rejected, whom they would not
have had King, yet God had so appointed, and would have it so. 2. Of our Savior
Christ, whom the great learned men of his time did reject, and would not
embrace as the Savior of the world: Where Christ's Kingdom is compared to an
house, and Christ to the foundation thereof, or corner stone, and the learned
men of Christ's time to builders, who should have built the Church of God (by
their place) but they rejected the best part and foundation of this building:
Therefore were like to make a bad building.

These indeed were Christ's chief Enemies, and could not away with him,
persecuted him, preferred Barabbas before him, crucified him, forbade his
Disciples to preach in his name, yea imprisoned and scourged them for so doing.

How came this to pass? They had a strong conceit that the Messiah should be an
earthly Potentate, Acts 6. 14.
and that he should continue Moses his Law and Ordinances: When therefore they
saw the contrary, they would none of him; but for all they were so expert in
the Law, yet they fulfilled it to their own destruction, in rejecting him that
was the fulfilling of the Law and the Prophets. See what a strong conceit and
prejudicate opinion will do.

Now their rejecting of him was, Why the Jews did reject Christ.
1. To show that God had purposed the Salvation of his Church and building of
his kingdom by a way that the wise men of the world never dreamed of. 2. That
their malice might appear to their punishment, and Gods power in resisting
them. 3. To show, that great men are not always the greatest maintainers of the
Truth, but miss the cushion oftentimes; they be not always friends and
furtherers of the Truth, but often great lets and arch enemies thereunto: Thus
it has been for the manifestation of Gods power, who can do his will not only
without the help, but against the might of great persons. Ier. 20. 1.
Thus was it in Ahabs time; Thus in Jeremiahs; Thus in our Saviors: They that
should have been the first and chiefest entertainers of him, preaching to the
people, John 7. and 9.
hated him, excommunicated him, and persecuted the people for believing in him;
so has it been of long time, and is at this day with the chief of Rome: Oh,
they boast themselves to be the only Church, and all that vary from them to be
Heretics, and that they have all the marks of a true Church, Unity,
Universality, Antiquity, with a perpetual succession of Bishops from Peter;
when yet they are the Enemies of the true Church of God, and have still so
been; a pack of erroneous and pestilent Doctrines they hold, contrary to
Christ's Truth, whose Church they persecute with fire and sword: The Church
never found greater Enemies, nor any so great, as they that profess themselves
to be the Church of Christ. For their succession which they boast of from the
Apostles, its very idle, and makes no more for them, then that Ahab was right
owner of Naboths Vineyard, because he came into the possession of it; or that a
Thief having killed the master of the house, Succession is of Doctrine or
Person.
sits down at Table in his chair, and eats of his meat. Succession is of
Doctrine or Person: Succession of Doctrine is good; Therefore that company that
continues in the Doctrine of the Apostles, and Fundamental Points thereof
(though some errors should be mingled) and has the Sacraments pure for the
substance, that company is a church of God, though there be defects in manners,
for so Christ said of them that sat in Moses chair; for though both Doctrine
and manners be necessary in a good Pastor, yet if he hold the Fundamental Points
of Doctrine (though he err in life and manners) we reject him not from being a
Pastor. But as for succession of Person and Place, its nothing: For Place;
Where has God ever in the New Testament, tied himself or his Church to any
particular place? or does he not call it Universal, as being in the parts of it
spread into all places? Acts 20. 29.
For Person; as though Thieves may not succeed good men, and Wolves faithful
Pastors: Therefore, though they could prove that there has been ever since
Peter a continual succession of Bishops in Rome, yet this would do them small
pleasure; but this their Personal succession they cannot prove, they agree not
among themselves who was first after Peter. Again, it was broken off sundry
times, when some of their Popes were condemned for Heresy, when there were
many Antipopes, and in the days of Pope Joan; unless they will say that these
were true successors of the Apostles: But say they could prove this, yet what
would it avail them, seeing they are altogether degenerate from the purity of
the Apostles doctrine, and are become enemies and persecutors of the same? They
have overthrown the foundation, and almost all the Fundamental Points of
Religion, and left nothing sound, brought in errors, and laden the Church with
an infinite rabble of idle and most frivolous Ceremonies; by their Doctrine
overturning almost every Article of the Faith, and thereby violating every
Commandment of the Law: and for the Sacraments, they have altogether abolished
one, and turned it into a Sacrifice and blasphemous Idol; and the other they
have so besmeared with their filthy inventions, that its nothing like it self.
Not at all to speak of their filthy manners, that besides all other sins, are
wholly sold to blood and murder, as being not from above, but from the Devil,
Who is a murderer from the beginning; we therefore conclude, that they are
none of the Church of God, but a Synagogue of Satan: They be the rightful
successors of the Apostles, that being rightly called, do build upon their
foundation, teaching the purity of Doctrine, and administering the Sacraments
for substance sincerely, whether they have had long succession, or have but
lately come to their places. Thus we see, that they which boast themselves to
be the Converters of the world, the only Church, are the deadliest enemies
thereto; they which would challenge to themselves to be the great Fathers and
Builders of the Church, have not only not built themselves, but (as the
Scribes and Pharisees, Mat. 23. 13.
that kept back the key of knowledge) have been the greatest lets to the
building; whose case is the more fearful, seeing they both may and ought, and
profess to do great matters, yet are so far from doing, that they altogether
hinder.

1. This serves to teach us, Use 1.
not to stand upon great men's opinion, or hang upon their mouth, approving and
disallowing upon their testimony or example: We must herein look only to the
Word of God; yet the common saying is, Do you think that such great or learned
men would say or do so and so, if it were not good and right?

2. To magnify the power and wisdom of God, Use 2.
that has used to build his Kingdom, and uphold it, not only without the

Builders] They would be so called, so reputed; But what did they build?
Errors, their own Traditions, and humane Ceremonies, for which they were very
zealous, being enemies to the true Building and Builders: They are so called,
not because they were so, but because they should have been so, their place and
office did so require: These should have taught the Law, and offered Sacrifice
in memorial of Christ till his coming; and being revealed, they should have
preached him the Foundation, and built up the Church on him: But they did quite
contrary. Hence note,

1. That none will take so great names to themselves, Obser.
as those carnal minded men who do least good of all, Such as do least good,
challenge to themselves the goodliest titles
nay rather do hurt: Yet will these ever challenge most to themselves; as the
Popish Priests, I warrant you, ascribe more to themselves, then the most
faithful Pastors; and so do a number of lazy Ministers at this day.

2. That such have been ever greatest enemies to faithful Builders, Obser.
which have challenged to themselves the name of Builders, Such as would be
reputed Builders, are usually greatest enemies to true Builders.
being indeed nothing less: The Churches enemies are often in her bosom; and
godly Ministers (as Micaiah, Jeremiah, the Apostles) have lightly no greater
enemies, then those of their own coat and calling; so the Popish rabble hate
all good Protestant, but especially godly and painful Preachers: Ezra. 4. 2.
The Jews had no greater enemies then they that seemed desirous to help them in
building.

3. That its the duty of Gods Ministers to be Builders of Gods Church; Observe.
so they are styled, Ministers must be Builders.
they are also called Laborers and Workers.

We must build by all means, 1 Cor. 3. 10.
with both hands, Doctrine and Conversation: 2 Cor. 13. 1.
All must be done to Edification, and not to Destruction in the Church; all
must be done for, nothing against the truth: We must build by preaching Christ
the Foundation, and build thereon not Wood, Hay, Stubble (false Doctrine) but
Gold, Silver, Precious Stones, answerable to the nobleness of the Foundation.
We must daily edify by Preaching, Mal. 2. 6, 7.
dividing the word aright, which was signified by that Urim and Th^mmim written
on Aarons breast, 2 Timothy 2. 15.
light of Doctrine, Exodus 28. 30.
and integrity of Life; 1 Timothy 1. 19.
we must keep the Faith, even soundness of Doctrine in a good Conscience.

1. This rebukes those that build with neither hand, Use 1.
but rather destroy, Prove. 14. 1.
like the foolish woman in the Proverbs: Thus the Papists, who be woeful
Builders: They overturn sound Doctrine, and build trash of their own devising;
as if one would come to an house to build, and would put up the groundsels, and
rear up a house of leaves, sticks and boughs, so do they Toys and Ceremonies:
So also those that would build with one hand, live honestly, but Preach not:
These be willing guides, but know not a step of the way: A man cannot be an
honest man in that calling, that is not an honest Preacher; His goodness must
appear in his particular calling: See Dr. Dounham of the dignity and duty of
Ministers, page 97.
A Minister ought not only to be a Sheep in the Fold, but a Pastor of the
Flock; not only a stone in the Building, but a Builder: So those that build by
Preaching, but pull down by Life, O pitiful people! and O dreadful answer that
such have to make, Ier. 48. 10.
which have undertaken to Build, and yet pull down; The curse will light on
such: No Minister can do this as he ought, Who is sufficient for these things?
O lets labor to Build worthily.

2. There Is comfort to them that unfeignedly strive to build both ways; Use 2.
As its a special work they do to help up the Lords Spiritual Temple, so their
reward shall be great in the Kingdom of Heaven: O happy is he that lays but
one stone into the building, and holds in the rest! Oh, its the greatest honor
in the world; other men deal about men's bodies or goods, we about their souls;
others build houses for men (what though for Kings?) we a Spiritual house for
God himself; who would not be encouraged hereby, against whatsoever
discouragements this world (theirs especially which should most encourage us)
gives us?

3. We must pray to God to furnish and send out many wise and able Builders
into his Church, Use 3.
that may be workmen that need not be ashamed, that may lay the Foundation
well, and build answerably thereupon; See Mat. 9. 38.
The Lord send such into his Church.

But, Observe.
though Ministers be chiefly Builders of the Church, yet we are to know, Every
man must be a Builder.
that every man also must be a Builder, and help the work forward, both of
himself, by working the things that are publicly delivered on himself in
private, Jude, verse 20.
and by other private means; as also one of another, Heb. 3. 13.
by Admonition, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 18.
Exhortation, Consolation, example of Life, Jude, verse 23.
and Prayer: For we are not born for our selves only, but to help to save as
many as possibly we can: Every man must put his hand about this work: Being
converted, we are to help forward the conversion of others: As formerly we drew
others to vanity, so must we now draw them to grace.

But alas, great is the Impiety, and carelessness of the times this way.

Impiety; The Impiety of these times.
How few seek to build up, but rather to destroy by their vile example, yea, by
reproaches, discouragements, and logs laid in the way of any that would come
forward, and desire to do better then they have done? O how few helpers do Gods
poor servants find? There Is none so simple, but has somewhat whereby to
discourage and hinder them; yea oftentimes even Husbands and Wives prove lets
and discouragements to each other: O these wicked scatterers from Christ, That
will neither enter into the Kingdom of Heaven themselves (nor serve God) nor
suffer them that would: If they that win men to God shall shine in Heaven, what
shall become of the enemies of Christ's Kingdom, which do daily turn men from
God? he will be fearfully revenged on them; These be like Devils, that turned
our first Parents out of the way. Herein I may yet go more particularly; thus,
1. By example they destroy altogether. 2. For admonition for any thing amiss,
they are rather content thereat, and if men did otherwise, these would not like
it so well: If any of Gods servants do amiss, their admonition is, to blaze it
abroad in hatred of their persons and profession. 3. For consolation, if any be
afflicted, they can say little to it, but I pray be of good comfort, nay happily
utter much idle talk: If any be humbled for sin, either they give it out that
they are mad, and that through running to Sermons; or at the furthest, bid them
be merry, put away melancholy thoughts, ride abroad to their Friends, Drink,
Play, etc. Miserable comforters inindeed. 4. For Exhortation to them that be
going on well, they do quite contrary; though they loved them never so well
before, now they hate, revile, and discourage them all they can.

Yea the carelessness even of those that profess Religion, The carelessness of
these times.
is to be lamented: Its a very lamentable thing to see how every one casts off
the care of others, as though it concerned them not who admonishes,
comfort, exhorts, etc. And for example, is it not grievous that some that
make great profession of Religion, yet walk so loosly, or have so foul things
fall from them, as that in stead of edifying, the godly are wounded, the weak
daunted, the wicked hardened in their courses against goodness, nay occasioned
to speak ill of the Gospel and Profession, and professors thereof? Such have
lived to an ill pass, it had been better they had been taken away at the best,
if ever there were any soundness in them: These had need not only to repent
between God and their own Souls heartily, but labor to recover by all wise,
godly and most holy carriage of themselves, that which they have lost, Mat. 18.
6.
Else it were better a millstone were hanged about their necks, and they thrown
into the bottom of the sea: O what evil examples are some professors for
promise breaking, ill payment of their debts and work-folks; as others for
extreme covetousness, hastiness, and the like? Christians are as a City set on
an hill, and have many eyes set on them (the Canaanite also and the Perizzite
dwelling in the Land) and therefore must take heed and be watchful over
themselves: Genesis 13. 7.
Oh, God has done great things for them, therefore they ought to shine as
lights in the places where they live, to gain men to God; If they will not, we
have openly discharged the Gospel and our selves of their sin, and testify
that they never learned so in the Word of God: The Gospel is good, let them be
what they will, and we neither defend nor like them.

Is made the head of the corner] namely, The Foundation of his Church, or the
Head, that is, the principal part of the same, notwithstanding Satan's rage, and
his instruments rejecting of him; these great Rabbis and Doctors would none of
him, yet he was the Foundation of his Church for all that, he had still the
place that God appointed him to, though these great men rejected him, and cast
him off. So

God will do with his Church and Ministers, Obs.
and build up his Kingdom as he has appointed, The enemies of the Church shall
not be able to hinder the Lords building thereof.
do his Enemies what they will or can, fret, rage, gnash their teeth, and gnaw
their tongues: There is no wisdom, counsel nor strength against the Almighty;
The Lord will do it, and who can let it? he has decred a thing, and who shall
alter it? Men may account of Gods faithful Ministers as they please, Isa. 8. 9,
10.
and cast them out as rubbish, but God will set them in their own place, and
accordingly account of them. As if a man had a house to build, and a great many
fair well hewn stones to build it with, and the Workman of spite would cast
away these good stones, and build the house with rubbish, will the master of
the house put it up? No, seeing he has been at the cost to get and fit those
stones, he will have them laid in their own place in his building, as is meet;
so will the Lord in building his Church. How often do great men and others
fret, and seek to overturn goodness, but God will do his will in despite of
them: Thus he did in the Apostles time, though the Scribes, Pharisees and
Priests gathered themselves often together, and plotted to stop the course of the
Gospel; but they might as well have gone about to stop the wind, or hide the
Sun, seeing God had set them on work: So in Luthers time, all raged against
him, yet God kept him, and by him gave the Pope such a deadly wound, as he can
never recover; though Turk and Pope and all fret, yet Christ is and will be the
corner stone. So the Papists fret at us, and have sought by many Treasons, and
blowing us up, to overturn our peace and being; yet by Gods goodness we
continue a Church, and if our own sins undermine us not, shall do still in
despite of our adversaries. So in a Town, God will have his Word come and
continue, and prevail to gather out his, and do that which he has purposed,
though hand join in hand to thrust them out; He has the key of David, and
opens, and no man shuts, and till his work be done, no might of men or
Devils can shut the door.

And a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense,] Namely, unto the disobedient,
as its in the former Verse. Now is showed what Christ proves to the disobedient
and unbelievers, A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense, even a let and
hinderance that they should not be saved; and lest they should except against
it, and say, They stumble not against Christ (as many unbelievers will) yet
says he, Ye stumble at the Word and Gospel that preaches and offers him:
Not we, say unbelievers, we stumble not at the Word, God forbid we should; yes,
says the Apostle, that you do, both against Christ and his Word, while you be
disobedient to them both; whereat that none might wonder, he shows that this
came to pass through the wise and just council and providence of God, who had
before ordained that ^t should so be: Even that as some should embrace and obey
them to Salvation; so on the contrary, some should not, to the glory of his
Justice.

In that the Apostle divides the people thus into Believers and Unbelievers,
and shows the note of unbelief, Disobedience; we may see, That

The duty of Ministers is to divide the Word aright, Doctr.
and give every man his Portion, Ministers must divide the Word aright, and
give every man his portion.
not speaking confusedly to all alike; The Word is a fan, that will make two
heaps where it found but one, laying the chaff and corn each by it self: It
sets down certain notes and marks to know one from another; the Regenerate or
Believers, from the unregenerate, and unbelievers: these must be observed by
the Minister, that every man may see his face as in a glass, and know himself
in what state he stands, that none may be deceived, but such as willingly
deceive themselves; that they that be Believers may know it, and walk
cheerfully, and give glory to God by a life answerable; and they that be
contrary may know it, to humble them, or leave them without excuse: Thus did
John the Baptist, our Savior, and his Apostles: And this thus set down in the
Word, and Preached by Gods faithful Ministers, is a certain foregoer of their
righteous Sentence, which Christ himself shall give at the last day to the good
and bad. Those that now the Ministers of God according to the Word pronounce to
be Believers and penitent persons, they shall then be found such, and have the
reward of Believers on the right hand: Those on the contrary, that they shall
thus mark out for unbelievers, shall then be found such, and have their reward
accordingly; for that which is loosed or bound on Earth, is loosed or bound in
Heaven.

1. This condemns numbers which Preach as if all were alike, Use 1.
and seldom show out any (except they be the best) neither set down marks that
every one may know themselves.

2. For people, Use 2.
they must be willing hereto: Oh, naturally men cannot away with it, they love
general Doctrine! A sieve thus to sift the one from the other they cannot abide.

3. Here Is comfort to all such, Use 3.
to whose hearts Gods Ministers shall declare by good and infallible tokens that
they be Regenerate persons, and Believers in Christ; They must not make a small
account hereof, but rejoice and lift up their heads in true thankfulness and
obedience: They shall find that verified, which is now told them, it shall
never deceive them: We speak it to you, not of our selves, but from the Word,
which deceives none.

4. This may terrify those that by just marks are left in the number of
unbelievers; Use 4.
let them not depart as if this did not concern them, or touch them at all, but
fall down and bewail themselves, for they are yet shut out of Heaven, and if
they continue their courses, shall find Gods Ministers words true; where they
set them, there they shall stand.

And a stone of stumbling, etc.] Our life and Christian course is usually
compared to a way, and the stops and lets that hinder us from entering into a
good life, or turn us out of it, or make us slack in it, are called stumbling
stones, by reason of which men are hindered from entering in, or turn out of the
way, are made go back again, or go slowly on; Now Christ and his Word are here
said to be so to Unbelievers.

Q. How can this be, that these should be lets to men?

A. Its not in the nature of themselves; How it comes to pass that Christ and
his Word become stumbling blocks to unbelievers.
for Christ is the way by which we come to the Father, the light of the world
to guide us to him, and the door whom we enter; and the Word of God is that
blessed direction and light to guide men to the Kingdom of Heaven, and shows
us every thing that belongs to our happiness, which is therefore called the
Word of Life, and Kingdom of Heaven; but through the default of the parties
themselves, even the unbelievers and disobedient, some of ignorance stumble,
that know not these things, nor desire to know them, do content themselves that
they be not book learned, and are poor, and think they have a good heart, and
mean well; or if they know some things generally, as that they must love God
above all, and their neighbors as themselves, they persuade themselves they so
do, and as they say, so will, and that further they need not trouble
themselves; others stumble out of notable pride of heart; others of
profaneness, as not a few of malice, as the Scribes, Pharisees and Priests,
who though they were convinced in their own Consciences of the wrongs they did
Christ, yet would not go back from that they had said or done. Note then, that

There is nothing so holy and good, Obser.
but that our wicked nature will thereby take occasion to stumble, There Is no
thing so goo^ whereat our corrupt not: will not take occasion to stumble.
and take hurt; Christ Jesus and his Gospel, nothing more excellent, yet many
stumble at them both.

For Christ, The world has ever stumbled at him, which was also foretold of
the Jews, though some received him, yet the great ones (especially) rejected
him; they stumbled at his (seeming) baseness and poverty, Obser.
misinterpreting the Scriptures which foretold of his Kingdom, as if an Earthly
had been meant therein, The world has ever stumbled at Christ.
whereas the contrary was foretold; and howsoever he was Man, and mean in their
eyes, and so unable to save the world, yet he was God also, and Lord and King
of all, and even in his greatest abasement, Isa. 8. 14.
his Godhead uttered it self notably; when he lay in the Cratch, John 1. 11.
the wise men from the East led by a Star came and worshipped him; 1 Cor. 1. 23.
The Angels also appeared to the shepherds, Isa. 53. 2, 3.
and with songs set forth his Nativity; He was hungry, yet fed five thousand
with five loaves and two fishes; Slept, but when he awaked stilled the winds
and waters; Paid tribute, but out of the fishes mouth; Wept for Lazarus, yet
raised him from death, when he had lain three days in the grave; Betrayed of
Judas, but at the same time healed Malchus his ear, and at his word caused them
that came to take him to fall down backward; At his death the Sun was eclipsed,
the Earth shook, the Graves opened, the vail of the Temple was rent; He was
buried, but rose again the third day, yet for all this they would none of him,
though he himself had told them, John 15. 24.
that if he did not works that none else could do, Romans 9. 32, 33.
they should not believe on him: They trusted for Salvation by keeping Moses
his Law, and so stumbled at him: And as then, so now also both they, the Turks
and Pagans stumble at him, they will not believe in a crucified God.

So the Papists, The Papists stumble at him
For though they give him a Name, and in word acknowledge him, yet indeed
hoping to be saved, partly by their own Merits and Satisfactions, and partly by
Him, they overturn the Gospel, make void the grace of God, and deny Christ
altogether; for he is either a whole Savior, Gal. 5. 2.
or none at all: If ye be circumcised (says the Apostle) Christ profits you
nothing.

And are there not many also among our selves that stumble at Christ?

1. All ignorant persons, So Ignorant persons.
that take no knowledge of the misery or danger they are in, but if they see
any thing amiss, yet they trust by crying God mercy, to do well, and so know no
need of Christ, nor seek after him.

2. Civil persons, Civil persons.
that like the Pharisee trust to their just and true dealing, and honest living
above a great many others; These cannot think that they are so wretched, as the
word says we all are, namely, children of wrath, servants of sin and Satan,
and that there is no good thing in us, and we unable to think even a good
thought: This they cannot away with, nor do believe; but like the young man
think they have kept the Law (though in the mean time, they understand not the
Spiritual meaning thereof) who therefore hearing the judgments of God
denounced, put them off from themselves to Whoremongers, Drunkards,
Blasphemers, etc. and so when Christ is Preached with his benefits (which glad
the hearts of some, more then all the world) they take no comfort therein.
These stumble at Christ, for he came to save the wretched, miserable, poor,
blind, naked, lost, laden mourners, wounded ones, and the like; and as long as
a man has any thing of his own, Christ will not meddle with him.

3. Profane persons, Profane persons.
who hearing that all that will have part in Christ must be truly humbled, and
must be thoroughly changed, renouncing all sin, and embracing the contrary good,
think this very harsh: Some like the Gaderens will not leave their excessive
covetousness, and gainful sins, as that which they get in their shops, by
lying, cozening and deceiving, who cannot find any time for the Word, their
Farms and Oxen carrying them away; others like Esau for their unlawful
pleasures and filthy lusts reject Christ: How often is Christ offered to them,
who yet will not renounce their sins, and turn to God with all their hearts? Is
not this fearful? But were it not an happy change, to lay down and abandon
their sins which will bane them, and take up Christ, who would save them? Is it
not monstrous that sin should be preferred before Christ? Is not this to spare
Barabbas and crucify Christ? Such as will not part with some beloved sin.


4. Such as go yet further, and have been professors and hearers of the word
long, and done some commendable things, who yet have some one lust or sin, that
they will not part with: Thus some stand cheapning many years together; They
would fain do well and be saved, but have something that they cannot find in
their hearts to do away, and so at last come to nothing, perish as unbelievers;
for whosoever shall have part in Christ, must be like the wise Merchant, who
will part with all that he has, to get the Pearl: He will part with any, with
all his sins whatsoever, that he may have pardon in Christ: He will take up his
yoke not in what he list, shaking off some part at his pleasure, but in every
part thereof: O poor fools, that will lose Heaven for some one lust! Are not
such worthy to perish?

1. This is an exceeding comfort to those that are helped against all lets that
hinder most, Use 1.
and do not stumble at Christ, but acknowledge themselves utterly lost without
Christ, that earnestly long after him, prize him above the world, and are
content to part with any thing for him: O you are blessed! Why should so many
stumble at Christ, and not you? O its Gods unspeakable mercy! Flesh and Blood
has not so taught you; well may you rejoice for him, the joy and rejoicing of
your souls: He will be a sure Foundation of happiness to you, that will never
fail you in this Life, in Death, or at the day of Judgment.

2. Terror to all that stumble at Christ, Use 2.
upon what occasion soever, that will not see their need of him, nor part with
any thing for him; To these he will turn to their destruction: For they hurt
not him thereby, but themselves; as one stumbling at a great stone, hurts not
it, but himself; or one running a Ship against a great Rock, hurts not it, but
splits the Ship in pieces: so will it be to all that embrace not Christ, for
missing him, Who shall save them? There is no other to be saved by, but they
must bear their own burden, and shall undoubtedy perish: They shall not escape
destruction; and no marvel, For if they that despised Moses Law, escaped not
unpunished, What shall become of them that despise Jesus Christ himself? O how
happy might we be that have the Lord Jesus, the blessed Savior of the world
Preached to us so graciously, when as few have that favor, but most sit in
darkness and blindeness!

3. Whatsoever has made any of us stumble at Christ, Use 3.
endeavor we to remove the same, that so we may embrace him with both arms as
our Savior, and stoop to him as our Lord and King, who will be to us a sure
Foundation of Salvation that will not fail us: If any will yet go on
obstinately and carelessly, he shall surely bring destruction upon himself
eternally: And is it not a grievous thing that Christ should be a cause of men's
Damnation? and yet he is to all that receive him not, as they that come
unworthily to the Sacrament, eat and drink Damnation to themselves: We say its
pity fair weather should ever do hurt; but is it not wonderful pity that ever
Christ should do hurt? Observe.


Even to such as stumble at the Word, Such as stumble at the Word, stumble at
Christ.
] Some will say, they stumble not at Christ; If they stumble at the Word, that
brings news of Christ, and will not embrace it, or be obedient thereto, its all
one. And For the Word,] Most men take occasion to be offended at it, that
either they will not profess it at all, or at least no more then they must
needs; but to love it, delight in it, attend on it with diligence, and be
obedient to it in all things, O this few do! Why, does the Word give any just
occasion to men to stumble? O no! Its the the Word of Life, and Gospel of the
Kingdom, able to make us wise unto Salvation to save our Souls; Its our Light
to guide, Food to nourish, Armor to defend us, Pearl to enrich us, all in all:
Yet will men through their own default and forwardness, take one occasion or
other not to embrace it, being herein stark fools; for if they take any
occasion to quarrel with this, or to shake it off, or be strange to it, they
must needs perish, yet there are too too many such.

The occasions that men take, are either from the Word it self, or from the
Preaching of it, or the Preachers and Professors thereof, or from themselves.

Against the Word it self, Offenses taken against the Word removed See Downhams
Christ. war. page 329.
Be these, 1. Some say, if they knew indeed it were Gods Word they would (as
good reason they should) believe, and be ruled by it, but that they cannot
tell. But he that has not a profane heart, and willing to doubt, but is any
thing humble and teachable, may see enough, even by the Scripture it self to
satisfy him fully, and such arguments as hell it self is not able to gainsay.
2. Some find fault with the Translation of the Scriptures, for whose
satisfaction Dr. Fulk and others have written largely. 3. Some curious Heads
and nimble Wits, no less profane then proud, stumble at the plainness of the
Scriptures, the homely and low style of the same: But this is one great
argument to prove it to be of God, because there is such fullness of Majesty in
simplicity of words, which is not to be found in any other writing: It savors
of a man, and of weakness, whatsoever else is written; or if any thing work
admiration, it is that which is strained out into some lofty and eloquent Style.

Unto the Prophet Gods Testimonies were wonderful, Psalm. 119. 129, 130.
a giving light and understanding (even) to the simple; yet in some parts of
Scripture is not only admirable Eloquence, able to set down the proudest and
ripest Wit (so also we could have spoke it all) but some be dark and obscure,
as may take up the deepest and greatest Learned; which the Lord has done, that
there might be taken away offense from the wise, as the rest is plain, to take
away offense from the simple. 4 Some stumble at some points of Doctrine which
they cannot conceive of, as of the Trinity, the worlds making of nothing, the
Resurrection, that Christ being Man should save us, that being dead he should
rise again, etc. This comes of Pride, when men will reject that which they
cannot conceive: But we must be fools in our selves, that is, captivate wit,
reason, and all to God, adoring that we cannot understand, and knowing that
Gods mysteries are no more fit to be comprehended in our shallow reason, then a
man can span the whole Earth with his hand; for Christ as he was Man and
mortal, so also is God immortal: He that was God dyed, but not in his Godhead
(that had been impossible) but in his Humanity; and by his Godhead raised up
himself being dead, and in both natures saved us. 5. Again, some points be too
harsh for some, as that of Predestination, that God should appoint most men to
damnation, and that then its in vain to strive, or do any thing, for that we
cannot alter; But of this we shall have occasion to speak in the end of the
Verse: We allow a man to kill a Worm or Fly at his pleasure; Why, may not the
Lord do so by man, who is much less to him, then a Worm to a man? God ordained
to pass by some men, but condemns none but for his willing sin. 6. Again, that
we are the children of wrath, wholly sold under sin, slaves of Satan, having no
good thing, but altogether filled with all evil, have no right to a bit of
bread, that the child in the cradle is the enemy of God, and has deserved
Hell; this man's proud nature cannot brook, but its too true, the whose
Scripture tells it, and we shall find it: And we are worthy to be in this
case, that were so happy in our Creation, and could not hold it; and now we may
willingly acknowledge we be thus vile, which will be the better for us, seeing
all that is wanting in us, is to be had in Christ: We must swallow this pill,
that we may have such a piece of Sugar follow it. 7. Again, that we must
renounce all our sins, and be crucified to the World, and take so strait a
course; this carnal people count bondage, which is indeed true liberty, and
that which they are in (as sweet as it is) is most slavish bondage to Satan:
They think they may not so much as laugh, and that this course ties them so
short that they may do nothing; but it ties us from nothing but evil, and gives
us liberty enough in that use of Gods benefits, so it be without sin. 8. Again,
that they that will be Religious and Christ's Disciples, must suffer
persecution; this they cannot away with, even because they are wholly carnal,
and savor of the flesh, and are so given to their ease, profit, pleasures, and
honors of the world: If they knew what the end of suffering for well doing
were, they would not be so addicted to the world; Mat. 5. 11.
for our Savior himself affirms, that such shall have a great reward in
Heaven; Heb. 11. 26.
hereat Moses aimed, when he entered into this course: This must we undergo; by
troubles we must go to Heaven, for they humble us, make us pray more, exercise
our Faith and Patience, weary us hence, and make us shine brighter, drive us to
God, and that end will be happy. 9. Some again take occasion from the
Scriptures to be licentious, as from the falls of Gods servants, and that
promise in Ezekiel, Ezekiel. 18. 27.
When the wicked man turns away from his wickedness, etc. and the example of
the Thief upon the Cross; thereupon delaying their repentance, and living in
sin boldly, through ignorance partly and profaneness, especially they abuse
the Scriptures (not a letter therein countenancing sin) and wresting them to
their own condemnation: These Examples and Reasons (among others) are only set
down to comfort and uphold them that being oppressed with their sins, are ready
to sink under the burden thereof: If thou be not in this case, woe unto thee
if thou thus medlest with the Scriptures.

Here I will add also some of the scandals of the Papists against the Word;
Scandals of the Papists against it.
for though they will lay it upon our interpreting and preaching the same, yet
seeing we know we preach it according to the true meaning thereof, therefore
they indeed blame the Scripture it self.

They cry out of our Doctrine, that its a Doctrine of Liberty; and that under
the color of Christian Liberty, we establish carnal Liberty, and let every man
do what he list: This is as if the most infamous Strumpet should charge a
modest grave Matron with unchastity; for to be sure theirs is a Doctrine of all
ease and liberty to the flesh, yea those very things wherein they seem most
harsh, feed the flesh, and give liberty to sin; It enjoins outward duties,
which an Hypocrite may perform as well as the best; It appoints bodily
punishments and penances as satisfaction for sin, and that by such and such
works (which an Hypocrite may do) they merit Heaven; and for their Service,
what can be said of it, but that it pleases well the eye and the ear? yet we
cannot be rid of their fooleries.

But why and wherein is our Doctrine to be charged? Why and wherein they charge
our Doctrine.
1. Because we teach free Justification by Faith only, without works of our
own: But is this a foolish slander, we establish works as well as they, and
teach the necessity of them, as inseparable companions, and necessary fruits of
Faith, and that there is no Salvation without them; only their blasphemous
assertion, That we are justified by them, we dare not affirm, do not believe.
2. That we take away Auricular Confession (that notable mean to kill sin, and
to keep the people in awe) and Fasting days, and give liberty to all sorts to
marry. To answer them severally:

For Auricular Confession, About Auricular Confession.
We know no such thing out of Scripture, its but a carnal device, and its so
far from killing sin, that it gives life to it; for having once discharged
themselves of all their sins into the Priests care, and he enjoined them what
penance he lists, thereupon having received Absolution for them, they are
ready to sin afresh, and so do: As a drunken man goes out and vomits, not that
he may be sober, but that he may go to drinking again, even so do they in their
confessing.

For fasting days, Fasting days.
and difference of meat for Conscience sake, We know no such thing in the New
Testament; The Apostle calls them a Doctrine of Devils: They fast indeed from
the Butchers Shambles, not the Apothecaries Shop.

For Marriage, Marriage.
Its the Ordinance of God that he has appointed for all, that they may keep
themselves undefiled members of Christ's body; and since God has appointed to
give the gift of continency but to few, therefore he has appointed the remedy
to be enjoyed of all: And for the Papists, which do herein fight against God,
and against Nature, yet they do most filthily defile all their places with most
abominable Whoredoms: Therefore they are wicked slanderers. Our Religion is too
strict for such Libertines as they be; All theirs is merely in show and bodily
exercises (which the veriest Hypocrite may do) not in mortifying the lusts of
the heart; They meddle not so far. True it is, we have too many licentious
persons of our Religion, but so does not our Religion teach them, which theirs
does: And that Original sin is done away in Baptism, that some sins be Venial,
that man has some good in himself, and that he can take away by penance the
temporal punishment of sins, and can merit, etc. Its impossible therefore for
their Religion to humble a man aright, and make him fit to receive Christ.

At preaching the Word, Offense at preaching the Word.
There be, that either cast it off, or at least hear negligently, and for
fashion, without any serious care to be guided thereby.

1. Some say, they did well enough before there was such preaching,

2. Others say, This preaching brings stirs where it goes, and unquietness; of
Gods Word, and the Truths therein contained; how hard to work upon our crooked
wills and rebellious affections; no marvel though men startle when they be put
out of their byas: But its good when the Devil stirs, for then there is some
hope and likelihood that he will be cast out. And for Divisions, its true our
Savior said, He came not to bring peace (namely in evil) but a sword and
debate; Ioh. 10. 20, 21.
but the fault is not in the Gospel, but in them that embrace it not; for they
that do not, See S. H. on Mat. 3. 10. page 11, 12, 13.
but are obstinate, they fall out and contend with them that do, because they
by word and deed reprove their ill works; whereas if all would obey, Acts 4. 32.
it would make a blessed peace, as it does between good Christians, that were
as Lions and Tigers; but better this Division yet, then that all should go hand
in hand to Hell, as those do that consent easily in evil; better two Souls of
five saved, though they have much unquietness withal, then all five perish.
Where the Gospel is embraced, it breeds not such a carnal love as was in
Popery, to consent in Superstition, in Vanity, Pastime, Good-fellowship,
Belly-chear, and the like, but a Christian and godly love in the Spirit,
furthering one another to Heaven, and in the setting forth of Gods glory;
howsoever, a just War is better then an unjust Peace. Hereto this Objection may
be added, That if a man be never so well beloved before, if he become a
Professor, and goer to Sermons, he shall be hated of most men; therefore I
would be none of those, will some say, I would have the goodwill of my
Neighbors: But let such know, that that is a wicked love and a woeful, which a
man gets by living in sin; John 7 7. and 15. 19.
better be hated of men for good, then of God for ill-doing, yea to be thus
hated is a good sign.

A. 1. The Devil had them who lived in Popery and Blindness so fast in the
main, as he did not greatly strive to bring them to gross sins, because he was
sure enough of them otherwise; now he fears he shall lose them, therefore labors
this way, and the rather, because he would discredit the Gospel: He knew their
civility could do their Souls no pleasure, and that being void of Faith it
pleased not God, therefore he let them alone, and the rather, that that
Religion might be the better thought of; now to disgrace the true Religion, he
persuades many to rest in hearing, yet drawing them to all evils. 2. There is
not more, nor so much as seems, but because the Gospel and Light has
discovered sin more; for a number of things that were counted virtues, now the
Word finds to be vices, and rebukes; as Carnal good-fellowship, idle and vain
spending of time, Idolatty, and blind Superstition: None were counted bad
then, but those that were notoriously so; now the Word descryeth many smaller
things, so that the Gospel is no more in the fault, though it discover faults,
then a Looking-glass is to be blamed, for showing any the spots in his face;
the fault is not in the glass that there be spots, they were there before: If
in a dark night we come into a house, we see nothing out of order, though there
be never so many things amiss, which in the light we do, yet is not the light
in the fault, as only discovering that which before was unseen. 3. No marvel
though there seem more evil, because when men are forbidden evil, and called
upon for good, they are more eager on sin then before; as a melancholy man
has most mind to those meats that his Physician forbids him. 4. No marvel
also though some prove as bad or worse then ever before, through Gods judgment
on them for the contempt of the Gospel: For if God gave up men to a reprobate
mind, Romans 1. 21.
for despising the light they had, though but the light of nature, and that
which they had by the works of God, what will he do for the contempt of the
light of the Gospel? 5. Yet there is no cause of offense at this, though there
should be more sin now: for there be many infinitely amended, who before were
ignorant, superstitious, and profane, but now zealous Christians, True and
Religious worshippers of God, and such as live justly and righteously with
their Neighbors, and are merciful and ready to every good work, and do more
true good by many degrees, then was done in the time of Popery: Then they fed
the bellies of all comers, and nourisht the people in idleness, and now in many
places the poor that can work, follow their calling, and either eat their own
bread, which is best of all, or else are relieved by the contribution of their
neighbors, their souls also, and the souls of their Families being looked to:
where it is otherwise, the people be all for themselves; which the word
teaches not, and so is not to be blamed, but their evil hearts that will not
be ruled thereby: So its no marvel that some be worse since the Preaching of
the Gospel, but its a wonder indeed, and a great work of God, that any be
better, and yet through Gods goodness many thousands are converted by the Word,
that were wretched persons, to become good christians, worthy servants of God;
who do more good, and better please God, one of them, yea in a day, then many
of the best of the Papists in all their lives: Take heed you be not worse by
Preaching, but labor to be converted thereby.

4. Some see not why there should be such regard had of Preaching; A. 1.
Private reading of the Scriptures and other godly Writings, is commendable and
of great use, whereof one branch may be to make men fitter to profit by
Preaching. 2. For public Ministerial Preaching, its ancient and profitable:
But let men take heed how they cast aside Gods Ordinance, to set up any other
in the stead; such pride he will not endure, Gods Ordinance is that which
carries blessing, and from which we must look for good: Men shall thrive by it,
and not otherwise; Exodus 16. 24.
when Israel kept Manna all night, it stank, if on the Sabbath even, it did
not, Why? because of Gods Ordinance: so why does some men's knowledge rot as it
were and come to nothing that they get by reading, See Neh. 8. 8.
and others that they get by reading and hearing comes to good? Mat. 2. 7.
even because the one attend upon Gods Ordinance, the other not: Luke 4. 16.
This is the way he has sanctified in all ages to save his people. Acts 19. 15.
We see how little and slowly people conceive of Religion, notwithstanding our
Catechizing and Preaching never so plainly, What would be without it? and what
though they be the Prophets or Christ's Sermons? usually there is but a small
sum which must be opened and applied: Acts 8. 31.
The Eunuch could not understand without a Guide and Interpreter; Reading is
like a fair Carpet folded up, Preaching is the same opened; Reading like whole
loaves, Preaching as bread cut in pieces for to be eaten: Paul bids that his
Epistles be read in other Churches, and without doubt Ministers did Preach out
of the same, opening and applying the same by Confutation, Consolation,
Exhortation, Admonition, that every one might have their due: And for that
which they say, what became of them that had no Preaching, and yet were godly?
God is not tied to means, and can work in extraordinary times as he pleases,
but in ordinary times he will work by ordinary means: The Israelites in the
Wilderness where they could not Plow, had Manna, but if they had looked for it
when they came to Canaan, they might have starved: Therefore we shall see that
God curses the reading of those that do it with contempt of Preaching, that
either it turns to vain jangling, or if there be any soundness in it for truth,
yet it swims only in the brain, and soaks not into the heart to reform. Again,
if reading in the Church were enough in a Minister, then it were not so great a
work, and so weighty an office to be a Minister as the Scripture makes it, so
might Universities, and a great deal of cost and labor be spared.

A. Its monstrous wickedness for any to put down any Ordinance that God has
set up, Neh 8. 6, 9, 3.
under color of setting up another: These two, Preaching and Prayer, be
inseparable companions, and must go together, and none pray more, then they
that make most conscience, and have profited most by Preaching; and how can any
pray without Faith? and how comes Faith, but by Preaching? The Word Preached
shows men their wants, without which they cannot Pray, but babble: Therefore
its said, Prove. 28. 9.
He that turns away his ear from hearing of the law, even his prayer is
abomination: and what Prayer is it that they talk so much of, but Book-prayer
to serve a turn? which though it be not amiss, as a staff till a man can go of
himself, yet its not as conceived Prayer, much less to be set up with the
casting down of Preaching, See Mr. Hierous Preach. Plea. 220.
whether it be done privately, yea, or reading of Prayer publicly, which is
lawful in it self, but to thrust out Preaching, that were abominable; Pray as
much as you will, but neglect not Preaching.

soundly. Prove. 10. 4. and 11. 14.
A. 1. Soundness and diligence in Preaching may well stand together; Disuse
makes men less willing, yea, less able to Preach; If a man conscionably give
himself to the service of the Church, he shall be fitted indeed to it: Its not
rare Preaching that makes men Preach well, no more then seldom milking of a Cow
makes her give more or better milk; If men be given to profits, pleasures, etc.
they will not much trouble themselves this way. 2. Men have need often to hear,
as being careless to attend, slow to conceive, having bad memories that had
need be helped continually, as also rebellious and untoward hearts to obey;
Therefore we are bid to Preach instantly, in season and out of season; If any
should be weary of often Preaching, it should be we that Preach, but woe unto us
if we do the work of the Lord negligently.

7. Some say the Ministers Preach so harshly, and such fearful things as they
cannot abide; They have come sometimes, but cannot away with such things; They
cannot be content though people be civil, and quiet, keeping their Church,
following their calling, and doing no body hurt, but require them to live so
strictly, and telling them that if they live but in one sin they shall be
Damned; and they call for such duties, and they must be done in a Spiritual
manner; They cannot tell what they would have. A. Alas poor people, they would
fain hear all is well and peace, that they might make an easy matter of being
a Christian, and go to Heaven with ease: Therefore they cannot endure to be put
out of their Byas, especially being Ancient, and having all this while thought
their case good; and withal having been somewhat civil, now to be told all is
out of the way, and nothing as it should be, and to hear such duties required,
and to be done in such a Spiritual manner, and that it will not serve to huddle
them over as they have been wont: O this is such a disquieting that they cannot
away therewith, therefore they count Preaching harsh. But better begin again,
then still go wrong and perish: If any has gone out of his way half the day
for want of asking, and at Noon one tell him he is out of the way, will he say,
Nay, seeing I have gone so far, I will not go back now, but go on? Or though it
be more grief, will he not rather return then go further out, and so never come
to his Journeys end? he were else mad: Our case is such, and it is best to be
told of it, and herein Ministers should deal faithfully, laying this as the
Foundation of all their Doctrine, See Deuteronomy. 27. 15, 16, 17-26.
that in themselves men be utterly lost; Psalm. 9. 17, and 11, 6.
thereupon denouncing Judgment, whereby they may be brought to seek mercy;
They must herein follow those which have gone before them, Mark 16. 16.
the Prophets, our Savior himself, John 3. 36.
and his Apostles: As they must take heed they break not the bruised Reed, Acts
2. 37, 38.
nor quench the smoking Flax, so they must not give Childrens bread to Dogs;
We must not give Pearls to Swine, and lavish out the mercies of God to Proud,
Profane, Impenitent persons. First, the Law must Arrest men's Consciences, and
they must be rowsed up by it, else they will never seek unto Christ for pardon:
It is necessary we should thus Preach, that we may be free from men's blood; and
that their ignorance or slackness in repenting be not imputed to our coldness
in reproving, such as more like or approve others, will one day curse the day
that ever they heard such sweet-tongued flatterers, or unskilful dawbers, and
they shall find most favor at the last that deal most plainly: Howsoever, thus
we shall please God, and keep a good conscience. Neither must thou stumble at
those many marks and signs that they lay down whereby to try Faith, Love,
Repentance, Sincerity, and the like, for Gold fears not the Touchstone: And
they that hear grievous things in the Word, if they would tarry by it, should
hear as comfortable and joyful, whereof in time they might have their part, but
they must taste of the bitter, ere they come to the sweet; Such as are
otherwise, would be as it were lulled asleep, even to their final destruction:
If any shun, and say we would bring them to desperation, they nor we shall not
need fear that, people be not so easily moved; if Preaching humble them, we
fear not, but it will also comfort them: Holy desperation I would we could help
men to, but there is more fear of desperation and horror for not believing and
regarding the threatenings of Gods Word.

A. They that have itching ears to hear the painted words of man's wisdom,
rather then the plain evidence of the Word of God, and seek to delight their
minds, rather then edify their conscience, if ever they receive any good, its
of Gods exceeding mercy, not the course they take: These be commonly such, as
get something into their heads to talk of, but yet live licentiously and at
large; and hence it is that they love such Preaching as is fair and far off,
rather then that which comes home to search their Conscience, and sift them
like a sieve: But whatsoever they would have, Gods Ministers must learn to
distribute the Word as becomes the Word, and to give that which is most
wholesome and profitable for the peoples Souls: They must Preach Christ
Crucified in a Crucified Phrase: The foolishness of Preaching God has
Sanctified; Its better to speak five words with understanding, which may
convince the Judgment and Conscience as it may search the heart, and so edify
the Soul in true godliness, then Five thousand, to no edifying, but to fill the
brain only: Its the true learned Preaching that open the Scriptures soundly,
and gather Doctrines naturally, to confirm them strongly, and apply them
wisely, 2 Cor. 4. 2.
and in all this to be so plain, as that which is in the Teacher, may be
conveyed into the Hearer; Its true Learning to make another Learn, that is
Preaching which may pierce the Heart; we may not deal Huckster-like with the
Word, as men do with their Wares, rather to beguile, then profit the buyer: How
little do most conceive when we speak the plainest? Assuredly for the plainest
Preaching, people ought to be most thankful.

9. Some take offense at us and our assemblies, and refuse to join Eccles. 7.
16.
etc. A. These are they that be too wise, and over just, that either would
imagine a company more pure then is to be looked for on earth, or condemn the
Church of God to be none, because of some wants and blemishes. But

That company that has the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles soundly
preached in all substantial Points, Which the true Church.
and the Sacraments for substance according to Christ's institution, is a true
Church of God, though there be blemishes therein: If it overturn the foundation
it is none; as if one want a head, heart, liver, he is no man, but a carkase;
who though he have scars and moles in his face, yet having the other parts,
nay, though he should want a leg or an arm, yet he is a man. Christ never
forsook the Synagogues of the Jews, though they were greatly corrupted, and
both Doctrine and life was foully faulty: Sometimes two High Priests in one
year, sometimes others of other Tribes then of Levi came to the place by
corruption, yet seeing they held the foundation, Christ forsook them not.
Again, That Ministry which God has used to convert many thousand souls, is not
Antichristian. Ye are the seals of mine Apostleship: We think a great deal more
charitably of them, then they do of us, as that holding the foundation of
Religion, they may be saved: And though we know that numbers of them be proud
and idle persons, and such as look not much to govern their hearts and lives,
and are more cunning in points of Church Government, then in points of
Sanctification; yet we doubt not but some true servants of God have been
misled, and their tender consciences have stumbled, whom God has enlightened,
and brought from among them, and who have had more peace in a day, in coming to
the Word from them, and joining with the Church again, then they had before in
a whole year.

10. Some say, There be so many Religions in the world, that A. A bad excuse is
better then none at all, but this will not serve men's turn: Though there be
many that say, They have the Truth, yet there is but one Truth, 1 Cor. 11. 28.
and this is to be found out of such as are not willing to be ignorant (as
these Objectors commonly be) Its no marvel that there has been ever, and will
be that envious one, that sows Tares where the good husbandman sows Wheat;
There have ever been Heretics and false Teachers in the Church, that they
which are approved may be known; but by the light of the Word, which is able to
show men the Truth, the servants of God willing to learn the same, have found
it out: Zachary, Elizabeth, Mary, Nathaniel, and thousands of others found it
out, though the Jews at that time were rent into many Sects, Scribes,
Pharisees, Sadduces, Essenes, etc. They did the will of God, John 7. 17. and
10. 27.
and were Christ sheep, therefore heard his voice, and were instructed in the
Truth. And it is extreme madness in any to neglect the finding out of the
Truth, because there is some difficulty, seeing without the knowledge hereof
they perish eternally: The more falsehood there is, the more it stands them in
hand to search for the Truth, or else they shall perish in their ignorance,
Prove. 23. 23.
as others do in their error: We must buy the Truth, we must strive both to
find it and maintain it; The Truth must be had, else we dye: In worldly things
men be wiser. As if one dwell some distance from the Market, and in the way to
it, he must go over a great Common, where lie a great number of bypath, some
to one place, some to another; will he for this stay at home, and want
necessaries, and say, I will never go, lest mistaking my way, I lose my Market?
No, but he will rather get one that knows the way to conduct him therein,
whereto he will take good heed, that he may not mistake at any other time; Or
will he neglect to buy necessary provision, because there be so many deceitful
people in the world, and so starve at home? No, but he will say, There be false
wares and deceitful men, but I Will learn skill to know the one from the other, to
discern the good from the bad; so that some difficulty takes not away men's
care, but rather whetteth and increases it: This worldly wisdom will condemn
men's folly and madness in heavenly things; We must therefore get skill in Gods
Word, whereby to try Doctrine, and that by earnest prayer unto God; there be
plain places of Scripture that will confute the errors that shall be broached,
by them we must be judge. These things I speak, because I would have all get
over these logs, if they have hitherto stumbled; and if we have got over, we
may be able by good Arguments to help over others, our weak brethren, that are
willing to learn, that they may be able to confute any caviller, or answer any
that shall kick at these things: And I pray and beseech you look to it, let
there be none here so ill minded toward himself, that having stuck at any of
these, he be willing and still content so to do, concealing the same, neither
desiring to be rid out of the fetters thereof: This is dangerous indeed,
especially take heed that there be not such an ill mind, and vile disposition
in any, as not to be content alone to cast off Religion upon these occasions
and pretenses, but labor to lay them in the way of others to draw them from
God: O fearful thing! Cannot you your selves be content to cast off God, but
will you labor to bring others also to destruction? O these enemies to God and
his kingdom! what will be their end? and where shall they appear? For if they
that win souls shall shine as the stars, Mat. 21. 3.
what shall they do that destroy souls? As the ten Spies that went with Caleb
and Joshua, bringing up an ill name and slander upon the Land of Canaan,
whereby they discouraged their Brethren from going toward it, were shut out and
perished; so they that bring up an ill name upon the zealous Profession of Gods
true Religion, and discourage their Neighbors from it, will assured perish in
endless confusion.

Against the Preachers of the Word Offenses also are taken; Offenses against
the Preachers of the Word.
as

1. Some say, There is a deal of preaching indeed, and crying out against sin,
and calling men to this and that strictness of life, and that it is such an
hard matter to be saved; but you must give us leave A. It cannot be denied but
that some in the Ministry, both of them that do not, and of them that preach,
that yet live so grossly and dissolutely, contrary to their teaching, that they
give a grievous offense to those that wait for such things; yea, and make many
ignorant (with Elies sons) loath the sacrifice of the Lord, 1 Samuel 2. 17.
and think that Religion is no such matter as we tell them of, because they
observe the contrary in their Teachers: But what though they do thus? yet
notwithstanding is the Word of God holy and good. Is Physic naught, because
the Physician is a bad man? or the meat, because the Cook is a swearing hasty
fellow? There is no calling wherein there are not some bad: But there be many
Ministers that make conscience to live according to that they teach, and as
well to be examples to the Flock in holy conversation, as to preach (which is
but one part of a Ministers duty) and who (setting humane frailties aside) may
bid their adversaries write a book against them. For common frailties, who can
say his heart is clean? even between Paul and Barnaba^ arose dissension; and
Paul complains, That when he would do good, Romans 7. 19.
evil was present: But for gross things that are reported of godly Ministers,
usually upon trial they have proved lies, raised of Malice, and not deserved by
them; And shall the whole calling of Ministers be blemished, because some be
bad? And though it were as they say, that Ministers were like Cooks, that
prepare good meat for others, and taste not of it themselves; yet the Word is
good, and it may be profitable to others, as Gods Ordinance, which is appointed
for the Salvation of his people, the blessing whereof depends not upon the
Ministers good life, but Gods blessing. Noah was saved in the Ark, whereof the
makers were (in likelihood) drowned: Mat. 23. 3*
It was our Saviors direction, that the people should be ruled by the Doctrine
of the Scribes and Pharisees, sitting in Moses chair, that is, preaching his
Doctrine, though they were not to do after their works: And though Ministers
know the will of God, yet let it offend none, that they straight do it not, for
knowledge is one thing, and sanctification another, which two are often severed.

A. Its not to be wondered at, if there be differences in some things, for here
the best know but in part, and there still remains scales to be rubbed off, and
God does not reveal all his will in all points at once, but by degrees, and in
time; and if any would tarry to be Religious, till all men jumped in all
Points, they should never be Religious, but perish; and will this serve men's
turns? But what contentions and differences are there between the Ministers of
the Church of England? True, its pity there should be any; and we should desire
God, to cause his truth to break out, and to remove the occasions of strife,
and till they can agree about those few things, to proceed by one rule in
peace: But what differences are they? not about the Essential points of
Religion, or matters of necessity to Salvation, but of matters besides the
main, namely, The Government of the Church, or rather the persons by whom, and
the manner how the same is to be governed, about which indeed there is diversity
of opinions; So about Ceremonies, which are not of the Essence of Salvation,
neither does the Kingdom of God stand in them: So that as the Church is a true
Church that is governed either way, so may they of each and both opinions, yet
be the servants of God, and be saved, both holding the foundation, though
differently building thereon: If therefore they shall agree in all Fundamental
Points, and all things necessary to Salvation, as in the Doctrine of their own
Misery, Christ, Faith, Repentance, and the like, though they leave the other
till God shall further reveal, they shall do well enough; and its more seemly
for Christians to mind the Doctrine of Faith, Sanctification, Love, etc. then
to busy themselves about the Government of the Church. The Devil calls them
from things most needful, to other things less needful, more uncertain and
dangerous: If because of some smaller points of difference, they shall shake
off all Religion, what answer shall they make? What if Clothiers should all
agree in the main points of Cloth-making, till they came to the manner of making
up, and to the Tillers, and herein they should differ, should any need stumble
hereat, and say, I Will be no Clothier, they cannot agree among themselves? Why,
they may be good Clothiers, though they differ in this and that of both
fashions: Let a young man then go and practice as far as they agree, and when
they come to the winding up, do as he is persuaded best, and he shall be
Clothier good enough.

A. Most is his own pains: They have thought longer time but short at Cards,
Tables, Feasts, Plays, and do still; Two or three hours at a Feast for the
body, and as much at play, yea an whole day from one sport to another, as a Fly
from one box to another, is usual with most.

and then contemptible. A. Men will find a very poor excuse rather then none
at all; Mark 6. 2. 3.
so was Christ contemned of his Country men: But can any Minister so walk, but
that some which have no love to Religion, and to be reformed, will cavil
against him, to color over their contempt; Could John Baptist? But he had a
Devil; Could our Savior Christ? No, he was a Winebibber, a companion of
Publicans and Sinners.

Against Professors of the Word, Offenses against professors of the Word.
and their Profession of Religion, there be that take offense:

1. Some say, There Is but a small number of these Professors that be so
precise, most be not so; and such as are usually, are of the meanest, Rev. 7. 4.
hated of all for the most part. A. 1. For their number, its small if they be
compared with the multitude, but by themselves a worthy company; and being such
a small number, its an Argument that they are approved of God, and walk in that
way which leads to Heaven: And has not this been always told, That the way
to Heaven is strait, and few find it; and so on the contrary? The greatest
number have ever been deceived, and joined in evil; most cried against Christ,
Crucify him; for one Elias, one Micaiah, there were Four hundred Priests of
Baal. 2. For their baseness, that is not always true, though the Church
consists most of them that are mean, yet God has had and will have of all
sorts, not excepting the greatest, as David, Solomon, Asa, Jehosaphat,
Hezekiah, Ahikam; and before them, the Patriarchs, Job, and others: So has not
our own Land wanted worthy men of the greatest place, as there are at this hour
many right godly Noblemen, Knights, and others of great state and place: 1 Cor.
1. 26.
If this will draw them to the love of Religion, there be not such wanting,
though their number be not the greatest, For not many mighty are called; Mark
10. 24.
And its hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God, from whom for
the most part heavenly things are hid, and by whom God will not uphold his
Kingdom, but by mean ones, James 2. 5.
that the glory may be his: The poor he has chosen. 3. For their
contemptibleness, they are not the worse, but the better to be liked, for the
Devil and wicked men will ever hate that which is good: They did so by the
Prophets, our Savior, and his Apostles, and will do so by their followers; let
this therefore be a mean rather to draw men on to Religion, then set them off
from it.

2. Some say, They make a great show, and be very hot for a A. You might have
guessed many truer Reasons: Its not that a true Christian is fallen away, or
one that has truly tasted of the goodness of the Lord, and finding no
sweetness in it, returns to his old byas as the better state; but it is, that
he that was but an hypocrite, though he made a show, is discovered now, he hung
to the bark, but was never ingrafted, went out from us, but was not of us; and
Christ coming (as is foretold) shall make the thoughts of many hearts to be
opened: Its the easiest thing in the world to be deceived, and few build sure;
and God will have some such Revolters, both for the good of his servants (which
are thereby made the more wary to build sure, and look to themselves better
then otherwise they would) and for the just falling of the wicked, that they
which will take no benefit by any thing, as by Preaching, and by the godly
lives of the servants of God, but rather seek for lets, may meet with such
blocks falling in their way to their Destruction: If some fall away, what then?
The Word has foretold there shall be hypocrites in the Church; yet there be
some have held out constantly, Heb. 11. 35.
yea to the death, in Prison, and flames, and loved not their lives so well as
the Truth, who have found indeed the sweetness of that Christian life, from
which they would never part: Let us therefore begin in Truth, and we shall
never fall from it, as the hypocrites do; lets look to our selves, there may be
times of trial, wherein many will fall away.

A. I see you can tell how others should live, though you have no mind to it
your selves: True, they should lead their life answerable to their Profession;
and do not a great many so, even their Neighbors that live by them with Eagles
eyes, yea, even their Adversaries being Judges? Why does not this provoke them
and you? and what if some having boisterous natures, and strong corruptions,
which for want of heedfulness and care, prevail over them for a time, and so
they fall to do something uncomely, yea, and for a long time walk not so
watchfully as they ought, is this matter enough for you to mislike Religion?
The Gospel teaches not this, but the contrary, therefore is it not in fault
that you should fall out with it. Does any man dislike a Trade, because some of
the Trade be bad persons, and are at sometimes overshot therein? Christianity
and the denying of our selves is not so easy a matter, as that it should be
expected a man should straightway, as soon as he has entered upon the
profession of Religion, be perfect, although we ought to look and labor thereto
diligently.

and they that have not been so, yet though they were as merry before they went
to Sermons as one would wish, after have been so dumpish and heavy, as that
they would never be merry; and I would be loath (will some such say) to come to
this pass, therefore I do not mean to trouble my head about such matters. A.
Many through Gods goodness be truly humbled, and yet in short time find
comfort; others more deeply cast down, and longer held without comfort, whom
(though they walk heavily as they have cause, yet) God sustains, and in due
time they get comfort; who if they should be held under all their life, and yet
obtain it at last, were much bound to God, and their estate infinitely more
happy, then to live as before in security: Yea, if any should be so deeply cast
down, and for want of means of comfort, living in desert places, wanting
public and private helps, or having them, be troubled also with the humor of
melancholy, and the Devil subtly watching his advantage when both these mere,
should draw them into some temptation, to lay violent hands upon themselves,
yet I had rather a thousand times be in the case of such a one, that being
lost, has sought after mercy and salvation, and had it in chase, and yet were
held off by unbelief, Satan's temptations, and their own distemper: Being in
seeking of it, their state could not but be good, what ever became of the body,
For, Blessed are they that hunger and thirst, etc. Better, I say, is the case
of such a one (though it be somewhat grievous) then either of profane ones, or
civil persons, that never make question about their salvation; but (God be
thanked) such examples are few, and very rare: Many indeed there be that make
away themselves by hanging, drowning, cutting their throats, etc. (of whom we
hear ever and anon) but not one of a thousand of those upon any such cause, but
upon Covetousness, Pride, Discontent, Worldly grief, meeting with such
Afflictions and Persons as cross their Wills; and having no Grace nor Faith to
bear them up in them, they sink under them, and yield to the Devils
temptations, as Achitophel: So that you need not keep away from Sermons, lest
you should be troubled in your wits, and make away your selves, but rather hear
the Word, and labor for Faith, or else you may be more likely a thousand times
for want of Faith, when Afflictions come, to hang your selves, then otherwise:
And is it not strange, that if one of an hundred upon trouble of Conscience
come to such an end, that should be a stone to stumble at, and all the other
should be leapt over, and be no means to provoke people to the Word, and to
Faith? a sign they are willing to stumble: And whereas there are some that are
upon some occasion, or naturally distracted in their Wits, and craized in their
brains, and so miscarry, people must be so wise as to know, that this is no
trouble of Conscience; yet a number are so foolish, that they put no
difference: Therefore never fear, being troubled at the Word, for if thou be
not troubled in this World for thy sins, thou shall howl in Hell for them
eternally. And where you say, They that go to Sermons be so heavy, whiles they
are seeking, and have not yet found, pardon them if they be heavy, having
obtained, they have warrant to rejoice in the Lord, and so both may and do;
though they dare not giggle, and be merry in folly and lewdness, which is
accounted the only mirth with the world: So that preaching is the means indeed
to make men first heavy, but after truly merry for ever.

From themselves also arise lets, Offenses arising from men's selves hindering
their zealous profession of Religion.
why they do not profess Religion zealously; as

1. Some from a supposed sufficiency in themselves, say, They know as much
already as the Preacher can tell them, namely, That they must love God above
all, and their Neighbor as themselves, A. O poor blind creatures that can be
so deluded: If they were not willing withal, it could not be; For is it enough
to know these general things, and no particular belonging thereto? But alas, in
their wilful blindeness they think they know and do all, when indeed they know
and do just nothing. Would not he be accounted a wilful fellow, that being
persuaded to learn the Trade of Clothing, should say, Why, I know that well
enough already, its but to buy Wool, and make Cloth and sell it? But are there
not so many particulars and turn-agains belonging hereto, as they that be
Apprentices thereto seven or eight years, if they give not the more heed, they
are yet at the end but bunglers? So of a Carpenter, Its nothing to build a
house, its but to lay the groundsels, raise up the sides, and set on the roof,
etc. There Is more then so required, as skill in contriving, skill in choosing
materials, and the like; so to the love of God and our Neighbors belong
innumerable things: When we have attained the knowledge of our duties to each,
we have not then done, we must also know our misery; and to help us thereto,
know the Law, and then know Christ, and what he has done; and then know Faith,
and have it wrought in us: These must we have, ere ever we can truly love
either God or our Neighbor; therefore they that content themselves without
these, abide in ignorance, and will perish in Hell, as those that are wilfully
guilty of their own destruction. Thus in these days, do not many say, They know
they be sinners, and hope to saved by Christ, and says not the Scripture,
Whosoever believes in Christ shall be saved, etc. If this would serve the turn,
God then might have spared all the rest of his pains in leaving us the Word
(only those two Precepts would have been enough) and his labor in fitting
Ministers to it, which he calls such a worthy work: No man alive can say, that
he loves God above all, and his Neighbor as himself, only that he endeavoreth
thereto, which endeavors also has and will cost much pains.

A. These bewray themselves to be naught at the first dash, for whereas they
say, they have good hearts, even the best complain of the badness of their
hearts: Thus Hypocrites desire to hide themselves out of men's sight, and having
nothing to say for themselves, they fly to the heart, which they think men
know not; but alas herein they play the fools, for if men do not approve of
them, do they think God will? and that they can stand before him? They think
also men cannot judge of the heart, but the Lord has taught us ways to judge
of it by the outward behavior, as the Tree by the Fruit. Mat. 5. 16.
Besides, grant their heart were good, Is that enough? does not God require a
good outside? Romans 10. 10.
Let such as wanting this, boast of a good heart while they will, its a rotten
and stinking heart they have; for without knowledge the heart is not good:
Hypocrites boast of a fair outside, when as the heart is naught, as others
having no good parts of obedience, say, that all is within, they have a good
heart; but the ones outside, and the others inside (both being indeed stark
naught) will carry them to Hell, not to Heaven: Learn we to submit our selves
to the Ordinances of God, and by the Word Preached to get Faith, that thereby
our hearts may be purged, and made clean.

3. Some say, The world is hard, and they pay a dear Rent, and they See Dr.
Pressed. Saints daily exercise, page 32.
and (to put them both together being near of kin) some be very poor, and say
they have a charge of children, and its enough for them to labor for their
living, and all little enough they think and find; they cannot spare time to
read a chapter, and pray Morning and Evening, much less let their work to go to
Church on the weekday; Nay, I promise you they can scant spare the time on the
Sundays; They must be at home (without it be now and then) to bake, wash, and
mend their things, or go on this or that errand, or see their Friends, lest
they should let their work on the weekday, and therefore they must be held
excused. Mat. 23. 23.
A. These things ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone: Its
needful for you to follow your callings, but there is a time for all things,
and do you think that Religion and serving God is such an Enemy to thriving?
What a fearful crossing of God is this, Mat. 6. 33.
when as unto them that first seek his Kingdom, all these things shall be
added? Is it not the blessing of the Lord that makes men rich? and whether will
he bless, them that serve him, or that cast off his service? Do we not see a
number who trust all to their toil, whom the Lord so crosses, as all will not
do? and others that serve him carefully are blessed, who yet toil not so much?
Psalm. 127. 2.
And if they that cast off Gods service do prosper, yet what profits it them?
That one thing is needful which they have neglected, Mat. 16. 26.
and our Savior says, What shall it profit a man to win the whole world, and
lose his own soul? They have spun a fair thread: But what if the outward state
be somewhat hindered, yet if the soul be a gainer its a good bargain; though you
have less riches then some others, yet if you have more grace, is not your
state better? And would you offer a Sacrifice that costs you nothing? 2 Samuel
24. 24.
or cannot God, who knows what your serving him stands you in, sufficiently
requite it? And for the poor, let them know, their great charge will not excuse
them: Have they not souls? That Is the greatest charge, and to seek the
Salvation of these; and one would think their poverty should be a spur
hereunto: Is there not the same way of Salvation to them that is unto others?
They had need hear the Word to get knowledge and faith, that they may go
through their Temptations comfortably. And first for the Sabbath, let them and
all others take heed they meddle not with it to their worldly uses, God has
sanctified it to himself, and the matters of Salvation: This ought every one to
spend conscionably, which if we would do, we might get a competency of saving
knowledge; woe be to them that dare profane this: God has said, we shall do
all our works on the six days, that which we cannot, God will supply without
breach of his Sabbath; and for the poor that live in the same Town, or near a
Sermon on the weekday, I make no doubt its their duty, without some great let
to attend on it, See Hag. 2. 19.
and God will recompense it, if they do it conscionably; let them thus do, and
thereupon return to their work, and follow their calling with diligence, and
see what they shall miss by the weeks end. Neglect of Religion indeed has
brought want, but I never knew any that heard conscionably and thirstily, that
were put to the more want by their hearing, or any such so miserably poor, as
careless persons: If any shall under color of hearing neglect their business
whole days, and so bring poverty on themselves, they are exceedingly faulty.

A. Have they so much to do for themselves, as God can have nothing done of
them? and so much for the body and this world, as that they have no leisure for
the soul, or the world to come? Remember the end of them who being invited to
the great Supper, Luke 14. 24.
came not, but preferred their Oxen and Farms thereto, they were shut out, and
had no part in that blessed Feast: Others might also pretend it as well, if
they knew not that one thing to be needful: What? are all they idle persons,
and have nothing to do that attend on the word diligently? No, but such as both
have business, and in like manner a Christian care thereof, yea, and those that
dispatch it well enough, and find Gods blessing thereon, no less, nay, much
more then they, that have care of nothing else: If they wanted something of
that they get, yet it shall be better with them in the winding up, when they
shall have that which will stand by them, whereas all that the others have got
shall be taken away; else as they had no leisure, and could find no time to
serve God, so God will find no time to save them.

A. You had need take the more pains in hearing, as also learn and labor to be
book-learned: Its possible, if you will give your mind and endeavor thereto;
If not, yet many that never knew letter in the Book have attained to good
knowledge, and been most excellent Christians, and laid down their lives for
the Truth, and others to competent saving knowledge, and lived well as the
servants of God: But this may be a warning for Parents to bring up their
Children in Reading, as in many other respects, so that they may not have this
block to hinder them from goodness: and rich men should do well to bestow
Learning upon poor men's children, its a mercy indeed to their Souls.

6. Others say, They be so dull, and its such an hard thing to learn A. The
slothful man says, There Is a Lion in the way, but its as easy to learn, as
many other things are: See Psalm 119. 130.
You can learn to play at Cards, you can conceive your own business, Prove. 1.
4. and 14. 6.
and are wise enough to save your selves from being beguiled, if you would
willingly in humility come to learn, knowledge is easy to him that will
understand: And though you get no great measure, yet if you get knowledge of
the main points and Faith, and desire more, and be willing to be ruled by that
which you know, God will accept of the will.

7. Others say, If they should follow Sermons, etc. they should Mat. 5. 11.
etc. A. 1. Blessed are ye when ye shall thus suffer, you may exceedingly
rejoice thereat. Prove. 16. 7.
2. When a man's ways please God, even his foes shall become his friends.

8. The younger sort say, Its too soon; and wealthy ones, That they A. 1. For
the younger sort, they must remember their Creator in the days of their youth.
2. For the rich and wealthy, they are no more exempted from serving God, then
the meanest, nay, are more bound and tied thereto, by reason of the means
afforded them to do good.

9. Others think they do well, and please God, though they be A. This is an ill
argument, Heb. 12. 6.
seeing God afflicts those whom he loves, and suffers his sun to shine, and his
rain to fall even on the unjust; This is but the wicked man's portion: Ishmael
had the fat of the Earth, Esau the dew of Heaven; Our Savior suffered Judas to
carry the bag, but Peter and the rest carried away the grace; Jacob had many
crosses, Esau many blessings, yet was Jacob loved of God, Esau hated: There can
be no worse sign, See Psalm. 50. 21. and 55. 19.
then to live in a careless profane course, and yet to meet with no crosses,
but to have all prosperity: the forgiveness of sins, and a little Faith, and
Sanctification, is more worth then all the world, Job 21. 30.
But the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction, etc.

10. Some say, They have a Minister of their own, though he and does his good
will, and what can one desire more of a man? A. These be notable persons, If
Salvation were put in their mouths, they could be content to take it, but to
seek after it, they see no such cause: It will serve no man's turn to excuse
himself by another man's fault, If the Minister do not his duty to Preach,
people must seek after the light (being its come into the world) compassing
even sea and land to obtain it: Neither would they be so simple in other
things, as to put their Suit for Goods and Lands into ones hands that has no
skill at all in Law, and being so told, make answer. I Will look after no other,
he will do his good will, and I can desire no more of a man: The like might be
instanced in a Physician for our body, nay, a Shepherd or a Keeper for our
Cattle; Nay, will men take it well, if such as through want of skill have
spoiled their work, should say, Why, we did our good will, and you can have no
more? But will you not say, You should not have taken it in hand, except you
could have done it; If I had known it, I would have sent it five miles, or sent
five miles for a Workman, rather then had my Stuff spoiled.

Thus there is no end of devices that the Devil has to put in men's heads, No
end of the Devils devices.
to keep them from regarding the word and matters of Salvation, nay, that
people will seek out for themselves, even to wrong their own souls.

And this is one main cause why so few people be saved, Why so few be saved.
because none so simple but he can find a shift, nor none so worldly wise, but
he can suffer himself to be held back by one of these or the like hindrances.
In our earthly journeys, we love smooth and plain way, and find fault with the
contrary; but as if the way to Heaven were too plain, men seek out blocks to
lay in their own way; but all these things will no more serve their turn when
God shall come to judge them, then a Breast plate of brown Paper against a
Musket Shot: For alas, they be but devices, and false causes in stead of the
true.

For the very reason indeed that people have no mind to Religion, Why people
have no mind to Religion.
is, because it crosses their humor. 1. Discovering their sins which they
would have still hid, and rebuking them. 2. Striving to pluck them from their
sins, wherewith being in love, they are unwilling to part. 3. Laying duties
upon them which they have no mind to stoop to, but count it a being tied, and
shortened to yield obedience to the same, which is indeed the main reason, and
true cause: If it were not for such and such things, will they say, we would
you should know, we would be as forward as the best: Well, let us, as many as
have been thus foolish, learn to be wiser, and devise no blocks: No, though we
meet with some things otherwise then ought to be, let not that make us fall out
with Religion. In worldly things people be so eager, as if they have a mind to
a thing, its no small matter shall beat them off, as from a Lease, Farm,
Purchase, or Bargain; but in Heavenly things, not a cause, but a shadow of a
cause will keep men back: O how happy might we be here in England and in these
parts, if we were wise, that have the Gospel so graciously Preached unto us:
Many Nations have it not, and they cannot be happy; and we have it, and yet
through our own froward hearts, deprive our selves of the benefit thereof: If
we have been weak, lets labor to be strengthened against these, and lift up our
feet over these logs that the World lays in our way, neither rest we content
therewith, as too many are. In our ordinary ways, if any Lewd and Drunken
Companions in the Night should tumble Logs, or lay stumbling Blocks to stop our
passage by horse or foot, we find great fault, and that justly; but we are
content to have Logs laid in our Spiritual way, lest we should be happy: And
lets labor to strengthen others, and help them over, and let none of us be any
longer hindered hereby, much less let there be a mischievous heart in any of us,
to lay them in others way to hinder them, but go on our selves roundly in the
way to Salvation, and help as many others forward as possibly we can:
Notwithstanding these lets, we must not be loath to enter this way, but labor to
bring our hearts to this, to see and confess, and forsake our sins, and be
content in every thing to be ruled by the Word: And what thankfulness owe we
God, that have passed over these Blocks, and are in our way to Heaven, whereas
so few escape them? It was of him alone. O pray we him to help us also against
all those that yet remain.

Being disobedient,] Here he proceeds to show the bad estate of unbelievers:
They are disobedient to the Word of God, which is given them for a rule and
light to guide them to Salvation: And this is indeed the very Reason of their
much stumbling at the Word, because men have no mind to be ruled by it; They
think it ties them too short, therefore they have no mind to stoop to it,
therefore they are willing to take any occasion against it: for if men had a
mind, its not those idle pretenses should keep them from it, as in worldly
things we see. The lesson we learn from hence is, That

God has therefore left his Word amongst us, Doctr.
not that we should only hear it, Gods Word is therefore bestowed on us, that
we may be guided thereby.
or make an outward profession thereof, but that we should take it as our Rule
and Law to guide us, and in all things make Conscience to yield obedience
thereto; what it forbids to count as a cursed thing; what it commands, to
esteem as holy and good, and necessary to be obeyed: This is that which God
evermore requires in his charges. This keeping is not a Legal Observation,
which no flesh can attain (Christ has fulfilled that perfectly for us) but an
Evangelical, How we are to obey the same.
which is, when believing in him that has done it perfectly, Psalm. 119. 6.
we do our unfeined endeavor constantly to be obedient thereto; and that 1. In
one thing as in another, Luke 1. 6.
having with David, Zechary and Elizabeth, respect to all. 2. Freely, and not
by constraint; not as Pharaoh let Israel go. 3. Not outwardly, but inwardly
with the heart and mind, aiming at Gods glory. 4. Constantly, and to the end:
Yet more particularly, 1. We must not give good words only, but follow Christ,
as the Apostles, who forthwith at his call left all to wait on him. 2. Our
obedience must be shaped after Christ's, willing in all things to do Gods will,
as do also the Saints and Angels in Heaven. 3. It must be like Abraham's; as he
left his Country and all when God called, contrary to all temptations, and that
readily and simply, without reasoning or indenting; so must we forsake our
sins, though never so natural, and never excuse it thus, Its my nature, my
Predecessers have done so, I have been long accustomed hereto; He left his
Country so natural to him, and that in his age: We must obey against all
temptations of Profit, Pleasure, Ease, Father, Mother, Wife, Children, though
all these hang about our necks, we must yet readily obey. 4. Thoroughly, not as
the Devils, who if they must needs out of the man, yet would tarry in the
coast: The obedience of the wicked, is like their Fathers the Devil, its but in
part; as the Devil entered into the Swine, so they will tarry in some sin: They
say (as the Olive and Fig Tree in Jothams Parable) Shall I leave my Fatness?
Judge. 9. 9, 11.
Shall I forsake my Sweetness? Usury, Iam. 1. 22.
Deceit, Lying, Fornication, Adultery, and the like? so must not we, Deuteronomy. 6. 1.
we must be doers of the Word; All other duties do but tend to practice, which
is the end and perfection of all.

1. God is our Sovereign Lord and King, Reas. 1.
and we be his Subjects, and these his Laws, and by these means does he speak
to us, gives every body leave to read his Laws and Statutes, yea, requires it,
2 Pet. 1. 21.
and besides, sets Expounders thereof: This is the Word of GOD, This is the
mind of GOD, He that despises this, despises GOD himself; This Bible shall
save or condemn the World, and by this we shall all be judged: He being our
Sovereign, and we such poor Worms, we should count it our happiness to obey.

2. He is exceeding bountiful toward us, Reas. 2.
he who both gave us life, and continues to maintain it by so many mercies,
which all ought to bind us; neither does he thus for us, to strenghthen us to
rebel and fight against him, but to the contrary.

3. His will is a perfect rule of Righteousness, Reas. 3.
and he does not first see a thing good, and then wills it and commands it, but
first commands it and wills it, and so it becomes good: Whatsoever is agreeable
to this, is holy and good; whatsoever is contrary to this, is wicked, and to be
abandoned.

4. All creatures in heaven and earth obey: Reas. 1.
The Sun runs his course ordinarily that God set it at first, and slacketh not;
and not so only, but if it be put out of course, it resists not: If he bid
it stand still, it does; Ios. 10. 12.
if he bid it come back, it does: He appoints the Sea to flow, Isa. 38. 8.
and it does; but if he bid it stand up, and let his people pass, it obeys,
and stands as two Brazen Walls; so when he sets it on work, it rages to toss
Jonah, and whom God will; and when he bids it and the winds be still, they
obey, as to our Savior: Exodus 10. 13.
He commanded the east wind to bring in the Locusts, and another wind to carry
them out; how much more then should we obey, that ought to be best of all,
being Lords of the rest, and all they to serve us? Summer and Winter obey the
Lords Word, and why not we? These may rise up against us.

5. Obedience exceedingly pleases, Reas. 5.
all else is to no purpose, Sacrifices, 1 Samuel 15. 22.
burning of Incense, observation of Feasts or Fasts, etc. Unto the wicked, Isa.
58. 3.
says God, What have thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou should
take my Covenant in thy mouth, Psalm 50. 16.
seeing thou hate instruction, and casts my words behind thee? Nay, its so
far from pleasing him, as it incenseth and provokes him, He that turns away
his ear from the cry of the poor, shall himself cry unto the Lord, but not be
heard; They are blessed that hear the Word and keep it; If ye know these
things, says our Savior, happy are ye if ye do them; yea, such as do the will
of God, he accounts as his Mother, Brethren and Sisters; by this we may know
that we are the Lords: Deuteronomy. 28. 1.
This also opens the storehouses of all Gods blessings, and musles the mouths
of all the Creatures, that they can do us no hurt.

6. Disobedience is that which has ever troubled the world: Reas. 6.
At first in Adam and Eve it put all out of course, and so has done ever
since: This is the cause of all Evils, Plague, Pestilence, Famine, and the
like, Lev. 26. 16.
yea, of the increase and continuance of those and others more grievous; Deuteronomy.
28. 15.
yea, this is that which brought all Judgments, not only upon Israel, Hos. 4.
3.
but upon all the world, and that which sends men to eternal confusion.

1. This is an exceeding comfort to all those whose hearts the Lord has
inclined, Use 1.
bowed, and humbled, to be obedient to his will in all things, and that have no
greater grief, then that they can obey no better, John 14. 25.
but glad when they can obey, and most, when best; let these know, its a brand
of Christ's sheep, and mark that they love God, that they are of the blessed
ones, that hearing, also obey, that they shall never fall, Mat. 7. 24.
as being built on the rock: This is a certain band to tie the Lord to you,
Ier. 7. 23.
he can fail you of no good thing; Obey my voice (says he) and I will be your
God; yea, and a certain assurance of eternal life, is gained by obeying: Herein
continue and increase your care, its perfect freedom it brings, sound and true
comfort here and hereafter; when they that disobey, have a corrasive and
gnawing Conscience.

2. This condemns all sorts of disobedient persons, Use 2.
which are many; and this is the reason that Hell is fuller then Heaven,
because so many are disobedient to the Word, Four sorts of disobedient persons.
and so few will be held within compass; as

1. Those notorious monsters, The profane.
that live in open profaneness, that are set to cross God; what he commands,
they will none of it, and what he forbids, they are mad on; which shake off all
care, and live as they list, Job 21. 15.
as if they were masterless, and no body had to do with them, Exodus 5. 2.
or to call them to any account, as if they ought no duty to any; who will not
learn Gods ways, but with Pharaoh, say, Who is the Lord, etc. Do these poor
woeful creatures know what they do? alas no; Know thou with whom thou have to
do, and against whom thou rebellest? against the Lord of Heaven and earth, that
made the world, that touches the mountains, and they smoke, that thundereth
with his voice: But who art thou that strivest with thy maker, that dare
rebel against thy Sovereign, who is able to cast thee into the Jail of Hell for
ever and ever? O consider this you that forget God, Psalm. 50. 22. and 9. 17.
and 11. 6.
The wicked shall be turned into Hell, upon the wicked God will rain snares and
fire, etc. Do thou think to speed better then thy Predecessors? Adam was cast
out of Paradise, the old world drowned, Sodom burnt, etc. If Pharaoh that proud
hearted Tyrant could not hold it out, nor Nebuchadnezzar, nor Belshazzar, nor
Herod, do thou think to get any thing by wrestling with thy maker, by casting
out thy gantler, and as it were bidding battle to the Lord? O therefore humble
thy self on thy face, fall flat at his footstool, and crave pardon, send out
messengers of Peace, and submit thy self, saying, Lord, what will thou that I
shall do? obey and that gladly, or else he will lay thee where thou shall have
small joy, yea, he will make thee obey in spite of thine heart: There will
come a voice that thou shall nor resist, Go ye cursed of my Father; and if thou
would bring thy mind to obey, thou should find it every way thy safest
course, thou should save not only thy soul which is the greatest, but even
thy body, thy good name, thy goods; for how have many by yielding to the Word,
saved hundreds and thousands this way, that they began to waste, and others do?
How do many bring untimely death upon themselves by wretched courses? How many
do the gallows catch in a year? how many stabbed, and dye fearfully, which might
have lived long, if they would have been ruled? Innumerable sorrows do men
bring upon themselves, for want of obedience to God and his Word, which that
would save them from: At least if thou will not obey thoroughly, and in all
things, yet come into some civil order and course, so shall thou at least if
thou be not saved, yet have the less torment in Hell.

2. Civil persons, The merely civil.
which disobey both commandments of the Gospel, do neither believe nor repent;
and for the Law, they do some duties to men, but of the first Table make small
Conscience, nay they have no skill, neither savor of the spiritual manner of
performing duties: What talk they of giving every man his due, when they give
God no part of his as they should? or of keeping promise with men, if they
shall break their vow with God?

3. Ignorant persons of all kinds, The ignorant.
as the Heathens, that worship they know not what; and Papists, that toil
themselves about their will worship, how good soever their meaning may be, yet
they do not that which God commands; yea, numbers among ourselves, that either
have or might have the means, but neglecting them pull in their heads.

4. Hypocrites, Hypocrites.
that obey in some things, yea some in many, and go far, yet either never
dug deep, and laid a foundation sure, or retain the love of some sin.

3. This may be for instruction to us all, Use 3.
especially that profess the fear of God, that throughout our whole course, and
in all our conversation we cast this with our selves, not what our profit, or
our pleasure, or our mind says, but what the Word of God says: This becomes
Christians, and will bring comfort, and will prove the surest way at long run:
we must not (following our own reason and conceits) cast off and disobey the
Word; we think it may be better thus and thus, or hope its no great matter, or
that its but once: O take heed! This cost Saul dear; 1 Samuel 15. 26.
He would go offer Sacrifice, He said he was bold, so he was indeed, as we many
times; But take heed of being bold with the Word, and taking leave of sin,
though but for once: Thou know not what that once may cost thee: To Travel
on the Lords day has many fair pretenses, but what evils has ensued thereby?
So Usury is a hasty way to get gain, but fair and soft goes far, What if we get
much, and put it in a bottomless purse, and God blow on it and melt it? One man
gets slowly in his Office and Trade, because he dares not lie, Dissemble, break
the Sabbath: Others care for nothing, and they grow rich apace; with the one it
holds, and his Children enjoy it, and he dies with Peace and Credit, but the
other dies with disgrace and a guilty Conscience, and God scatters that he
has; for God will take pity of the honest labors of men, and give of the fruit
thereof to their Posterity, but no pity of that which was got with the price of
his glory: Hereby many a man loses soul and all. So many a man sees not into
some one thing (who is otherwise good) and so happily is too hard to his
workfolks, will make bold now and then with the Sabbath, etc. though his soul
be faved, yet God sets the print of his hand on him in some outward affliction,
Body, Goods, Children, and the like.

Whereunto also they were appointed] The Reason how it comes about, Why Christ
proves a rock of offense unto most.
that seeing Christ is the way of Salvation, and the Word the means to bring
men to Faith in Christ, that yet to some they prove a rock of offense, and turn
to their destruction; its because God in his unchangeable and eternal purpose
has so decreed: This (to let pass other interpretations) by the consent of the
soundest, is the plain meaning of the words; and I come not to tell you what
men say, but what I am persuaded God says; As he has ordained some to
Salvation, so has he some to stumble and come to destruction, which are the
two parts of Predestination: This is that most holy and just decree of God,
whereby he has in himself eternally and unchangeably determined of the final
estate of all mankind, and every particular in the same; Ephesians. 1. 5.
whatsoever falls out is by his decree, and not a^ adventure, Acts 4. 8.
He does all according to the counsel of his own will: The means of effecting
this are, the creation of man in innocence, and the fall of Adam, which was
also of him decreed: It has these two parts, Election and Reprobation; for
though it be put sometimes for the one only, Romans 8. 31.
as for Election, yet is it common to both.

This Doctrine will appear both lawful and meet, to be taught upon these
grounds; Whether it be lawful and meet to handle the Doctrine of Gods decree.
1. Whatsoever is written, is written for our learning, and the whole Scripture
is profitable to teach, etc. whereof this is a part. 2. This is a part of Gods
counsel, the whole whereof ought to be taught. 3. Its of very great use to the
people of God, their strong Bulwark to fly unto, and strengthen them against
all Satan's assaults, Acts 20. 27.
even the unchangeableness of Gods counsel. Romans 9. 11, 12, etc.
4. The holy Apostles have Preached the same plainly to mixed Churches in most
of their Epistles. Ephesians. 1. 4.
5. Many Errors have been broached about this Doctrine, Jude, verse 4.
by Satan and men of corrupt judgment, whereof the Translator of Mr. Perkins
his Treatise speaks in his Epistle.

But its offensive, Object.
and many take hurt hereby, casting off all care, and saying, If I be elect, I
shall be saved, let me do as I list; and if I be appointed to damnation, I
cannot be saved do what I can.

What if some take hurt by this Doctrine, Sol.
shall it not therefore be Preached? What Doctrine almost can be taught, but
man's vile nature and heart will take occasion by it of ill? as of Gods mercy,
whereupon men wax bold and secure, shall not the Doctrine of Gods mercy be
taught? Romans 6. 1.
so of Christian liberty, (which was the reason of those preventions which the
Apostles used) so of the Doctrine of Justification by Faith only; Gal. 5. 13.
yea, Christ himself is a stumbling stone and rock of offense, Shall he
therefore not be Preached? Its not the fault of the Doctrine, but their own
wicked corruption, and Satan's malice, that turn holy and wholesome things to
hurt; as a choleric stomach does good meat into ill juice; and the Spiders
gather poison from the same flowers from which the Bees gather honey, Do we
therefore wish there were no flowers? Shall the Childrens bread be kept from
them, because some unruly Servants will riot and abuse it? Shall the use of a
Knife or a Sword be denied to all sober men, because a mad man will hurt
himself and others therewith? The wicked do abuse the Word and Sacraments and
all to their hurt, Shall therefore the people of God be deprived of them? as
the Papists do most wretchedly keep away the Scriptures from the people, lest
they should read them: The like may be said of the Preaching of this Doctrine,
But who are they that take hurt? even such as would take hurt, and perish
though this were not: But one of Gods people is more to be respected, then
ninety and nine that care for no goodness: And this is of great use to the
people of God; It stays them well when they see great professors fall away,
else they should ever be in a slavish fear, and so it makes the true servants
of God go on comfortably, and strengthens them in all persecutions and
troubles, that they shall never fall finally.

It makes men bold and secure, Obj.
because they know they can never fall away.

Not at all, Sol.
but the more careful to please God; for they know they may fall dangerously,
and that holds them in awe with the conscience of Gods love together: It
further stirs up men to labor to get marks of Election to themselves: Its also
a matter of great thanksgiving to God, that having passed by so many, he has
had mercy on us; so that its profitable to more then its hurtful to: It
comforts many, What if some stumble when they have no cause? Yea, its matter of
Humiliation, that Gods grace, not our goodness is the first cause of our
Salvation.

It will make men shake off the use of all means, Obj.
and say, What need is there of Sermons and Exhortations, if the number be
appointed who shall be saved, and who damned?

What are they but desperate and wilful persons that will so do? Sol.
that will neglect the means, because they know the end is certain and
unchangeable? we fear not to teach men Gods Ordination in other things, as that
he has set the period of man's life, which he cannot pass; yet this does not
make men neglect their meat, nor desperately make them cast themselves from the
tops of houses, or run upon a naked Sword, because their time is appointed;
therefore we may teach it, provided it be taught modestly, and according to the
Scriptures: But its Sacriligious modesty to keep back this or any part of Gods
counsel; this were to be wise above God and the Scriptures: the Papists have a
number of such carnal conceits, which show they be not led by God. If a King
should give unto any of his subjects a goodly Manor, and appoint by what way
he should go to it, would not he be willing to learn the way? accordingly
should we in this particular.

For the Doctrine it self, consider we briefly four things, which are most
material for the edifying of the Consciences of them that are desirous to learn
the mind of God herein, wherein I will rather endeavor to show the truth and
some uses thereof, then by entering into curious questions to please itching
ears, or to stand long in confuting the contrary errors; The first is this, That

God has ordained some to destruction: Doctr.
This appears by plain places of Scripture which cannot be avoided, God has
ordained some to destruction.
as Romans 9. 17. For this same purpose have I raised thee up, etc. Jude, verse
4. Who were before of old ordained to this condemnation, etc. So for Election,
we have Ephesians. 1. 4. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 9. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13. 2 Pet. 2. 12. Now there is
the contrary reason of contraries; If he chose some, then he refused others; If
he had taken all, then no Election; If not all, then some refused: And if the
Lord ordained those whom he Elected to eternal Salvation, Did he not then
ordain the other to destruction whom he refused, or left he them at
uncertainty? Things fall not out at adventure, but according to Gods Decree and
Eternal counsel, What wise Workman does not propound an end to himself, Acts 4.
28.
ere he begin his work? and think we the Lord did not determine the final state
of all men? See Willet on Rom 9. 11. page 4. 16.
Yes; ere he went about the making of a world he decreed the least matters,
therefore much more this.

1. This confuteth that erroneous platform of the Papists and others, Use 1.
which defend universal grace: See Perkins 3, on the Creed and Pred.
This makes the will of God (which is the high and sovereign cause of all) to
be subject to man's will; whereas its said, Psalm. 115. 3.
Whatsoever he will, he does.

But is not the Lord slow to anger and of great kindeness, Object.
and how can this be, Exodus 34. 6.
having ordained most men to damnation?

That Is true, Sol.
yet makes it nothing against this. 1. Its true of the godly, but he is severe
toward the wicked; Both Saul and David sinned, yet was the former punished
severely, the latter pardoned: Neither is he so slow to wrath, but that he is
also just (many examples of either might be instanced) and is as much honored
in the one as in the other. See Nah. 1. ^7.
2. Its true also in part of the wicked, for its of his patience toward them,
that they live and enjoy so many of his benefits in such abundance, with the
Gospel, and that he does not confound them at once, who yet provoke him highly
every day.

Its said in Ezekiel, Obj.
As I live, says the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked,
Ezekiel. 33. 11.
etc.

He does not delight thereat, Sol.
as its the destruction of the creature, but as its a mean to set forth his
glory; For he aimed not at the undoing and ruin of his creature in his Decree,
but at a far more excellent end, even his own glory. Besides, God wills many
things which yet he delights not in, as the afflictions of his servants at the
hands of ungodly men. See Mr. Harsnels Sermon of this point.
As good and merciful Judges, they delight not in the blood and pains of them
that are Executed and by them condemned, which yet must be for the defense of
the good, the cutting off and terror of the bad.

God will have all men to be saved. Obj.


Its to be understood of all kinds of men in this last age of the world, 1 Timothy 2. 4.
by the means of Christ Jesus. Sol.


The Lord is not willing that any should perish, Obj.
etc.

The wicked mocked at Gods promises, 2 Per. 3. 9.
and the godly began to think long; Sol.
therefore the Apostle sets himself (and that is the scope of the place) to
comfort the faithful: So this place of all men to come to repentance, See Rev.
6. 11.
is meant of the Elect only. Is patient toward us, says the Text, showing
that God defers not of forgetfulness, but because he waits till the rest of the
Elect uncalled and unborn be added, and then it shall come at the just
appointed time: Its not deferred that all men should be saved, for then it
should never come, for all men shall not be saved, but for the Elect only.

If God has ordained most men to destruction, Object.
then is his justice greater then his mercy.

We must not measure his justice and mercy by the number of the one or of the
other; Sol.
for if there had been but one only saved, it had been as great mercy, as his
justice in condemning the rest: for if but one had been saved, it must have
cost the death of the Lord Jesus, such was our misery. Now what a mercy it was,
that the eternal Son of God, equal with the Father, and in whom he was well
pleased, should not only abase himself to our nature, but to our infirmities;
yea, to sorrows, and great indignities, nay, to death, yea, a cursed death: O
who can express this love! It was a wonder he did not rather suffer us all to
perish, then his Son to endure the least of these!

Then he has ordained the means of their condemnation, Object.
namely, sin, and so is the Author of sin.

True, he ordained and decreed that there should be sin in the world, as he did
of the fall of Adam; but not as is sin and evil, but as whereby and out of
which God draws glory to himself: and it was necessary that there should he
evil in the world, as well as good, that a way might be made for setting out
Gods mercy in pardoning some, and his justice in punishing it in others, but so
as the Lord is no way faulty: He ordained willingly to permit it, as it has
respect of good in it, but as no actor of it: He put no evil in Adam, nor any
man, but only willingly permitted his fall, etc.

2. This should and may stay our minds, Use 2.
when we see any great Professors, and men of excellent parts fall away: Its no
other, then that an Hypocrite, and one that never was sound nor elect of God,
is now discovered; and let none that can prove their election be overmuch
troubled, only walk reverently, but never be dismayed with deadly fear: They
fell, because they were not elect, and you being elect, shall be therefore sure
to stand: and thus our Savior comforts his Disciples, See 1 Ioh. 2. 19.
That none was lost but Judas, who was the son of perdition; so did Paul the
Christians, notwithstanding the revolting of Hymeneus, Philetus, Alexander,
etc. If it were not for this, what a deadly fear might this breed in weak
Christians, to see those so far their superiors in knowledge and gifts to fall
away. Thus of the first.

The second is this, Doctr.
That

This was of his own will* This was of his own will, and for no cause out of
himself.
and for no cause out of himself; for the Lord infinite in wisdom and holiness,
needs not as man to fetch the reason of his purposes forth of himself: He will
have mercy on whom he will have mercy, Romans 9. 15.
and whom he will he hardneth; He does all things according to the counsel of
his own will. Ephesians. 1. 5.


Is it not said, Obj.
O Israel, thy destruction is of thy self; and, He that beliveth not is
condemned; and, Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.

Cursed be the mouth that says not so, Sol.
even that every man's destruction is of himself, and his own just desert; but
we must put a difference between the decree of God, and the execution of it;
God condemns no man upon his bare will, but his own just desert: Sin comes in
between the decree of God, and the execution of his Decree, as the cause of
Damnation.

If then it be asked, Quest.
Why is any man condemned?

For his sin. Answ.


But why did God decree to condemn any? Quest.


Because he would. Answ.
As no man is saved but by Faith in Christ, and Sanctification of life (which
yet is not the cause why God appointed him to Salvation, but because he would)
so there is none condemned but for his sin; yet God ordained him not thereto
because of sin, but because of his own will.

If any ask further, Quest.
and why would he?

That a note too high for man or angel to sing, Answ.
but there in humility we must rest, and not put the Lord to render a reason of
all his decrees or doings, which even princes will not do to their subjects: he
raised up Pharaoh, etc. even because he would get glory out of him, and by his
means.

This condemns the Opinion of foreseen works, Use.
good or bad, as of this, because he foresaw some would be bad, and refuse
grace, he therefore Reprobated them, etc. but God loved Jacob and hated Esau,
not only before the had done good or evil, but before there was any thinking
of good or ill: If foreseen sin be the cause of Reprobation, then on the
contrary, foreseen grace of Election; but the Epistle to the Ephesians shows
the contrary hereof: See Ephesians. 1. 4. and 2. 11.
Faith and Sanctification follows upon Election, as fruits thereof, therefore
go not before as any causes; so do Infidelity and impenitency follow after
Reprobation: If foreseen sin had been the cause of Reprobation, John 9. 3.
then we should all have been refused, for he could not see us, but all
sinners: But as the blind man was not so born for his own or Parents sin, but
that the work of God in curing him by a Word might be seen, so was it in this
business. Thus of the second.

The third is this, Doctr.
That

The Lord has done this most justly: The Lord has done this most justly.
His will is a rule of Righteousness, and he can do nothing but most holily and
justly; Is there unrighteousness with God? Romans 9.
God forbid; Though we cannot see into the justness of it, yet we ought to
acknowledge it: The Sun may shine, and that brightly too, though a blind man
see it not: Man was made holy, and having free will, by his willing sin lost
his state, and still sins willingly.

It seems cruelty in the Lord to appoint most part of mankind to Destruction.
Object.


He did it not, Sol.
as aiming at their Damnation, but at his own glory, which is more to be
regarded then all the World: And shall the Clay say against the Potter, Why
have thou made me thus, and thus? may not he do as he list? So may not the Lord
get glory by his own creatures which way he will? And do men for their pleasure
hunt the Hare and Partridge, or kill, not only Flies, and baser creatures, but
also Fowls with their grins, in like manner appointing Sheep, Oxen, etc. for the
slaughter, and shall not the Lord have as much Sovereignty over men, the work
of his hands? we cannot make a Fly or Flea; yea, its more reason that the Lord
should be glorified, if he would, with the Damnation of all mankind, then that
the killing of a Hare, nay a Fly, should serve to the honor or pleasure of the
greatest Potentate of the world: What if he had ordained none to Salvation, who
had had cause to complain? Besides, with what patience bears he with them, and
their blaspheming of him every day? What mavelous benefits, and comfortable
good things, bestows he upon them, houses, lands, wealth, health, peace, who
might destroy and send them to hell at the first? Romans 9. 22.
He suffers the Vessels of wrath with patience. Thus though there had been no
sin in the World, God might justly have appointed most men to Damnation, and
cast them away also for his glory; but now God does not cast any man away, but
for his own willing falling away, and sin, for he made man Righteous, but now
sin comes in, and for this is every one condemned, that is condemned. Besides,
is God cruel to them? He never makes their finger ache, till they have deserved
Hell, never condmns man or woman, till they have deserved it a thousand times,
and in the mean time cease not to bestow manifold blessings on them.

But as it were tyranny in a King to appoint many of his Subjects to punishment
upon his will, Object.
so were it in God, said a Papist.

Its a most unequal comparison; Solut.
they be not the Kings creatures, though his Subjects committed to him to rule,
not as he will, but as God commands; but God has power, because they be his
creatures. As if a Potter having made many pots, commits them to a servant to
be looked to, if he burst any of them, at his peril he does it, because they be
not his own, but if the owner should break any, who shall blame him?

But its partiality in God, Object.
and respect of persons, to take some, and refuse others, being all equally
guilty, and in estate without difference.

Not so; Solut.
respect of persons is, when many being in one case, one is preferred: For
what? for something in their own person; as a Judge having two Malefactors
equally guilty, executes the one, and spares the other, because he is his
Kinsman, Countreyman, etc. But a Prince has two Traitors equally deserving
death, and he without respect, but because he will, pardons one, and cuts off
the other, as it may be Pharaoh did by his Butler and Baker; or a man has two
Debtors, and without respect he requires it all of the one, and forgives all to
the other, Who shall let a man so to do? This is no respect of persons: But if
a man be to adopt a Child out of five or six, and chooses one, because he is
Witty, Fair, Proper, etc. this is respect of persons; but so it is not in the
Lord, for he respects nothing in them that he elected, nor in the other, but
because he would. Thus of the third.

The fourth is this, Doctr.
That

The Lord has done this unchangeably. The Lord has done this unchangeably.
Those that are ordained to destruction, cannot possibly be saved, as it is not
possible for the elect to be deceived: Mat. 24. 24.
The foundation of the Lord remains sure, His decrees are as himself, 2 Timothy
2. 19.
without alteration; for if it should be otherwise, it must needs be, either
that he sees further now, and so wanted wisdom, or that he is inconstant,
whereof to think but a thought were blasphemous, or else that he were
overruled by some power which he could not resist, which were as horrible.
Balaam could say, That God was not like man, that he should lie or repent: It
seems to us sometimes as though God did change, as in Nineveh and Hezekiah,
but its not so, for though he concealed it, the threatenings were conditional:
His secret will is ever the same, firm and fast, and no contradiction between
it and his revealed will, though there may seem so to be; yet not so, as if
Gods decree put a necessity upon man of offending: for as Adam, so every man
sins willingly without constraint, and yet necessarily: Gods decree binds to a
necessity of condemnation, but man's sin comes in of his own will: O the
infinite and unsearchable wisdom and righteousness of God!

Seeing they whom God has ordained to destruction can never be saved (who yet
may be enlightened, Use.
go far, and have many gifts and outward benefits) we should never be quiet nor
sleep good sleep till we can prove we are no Reprobates: O its a most fearful
state, able to make the heart ache, yea, the thought of it to torment a man;
therefore we must labor to know we are not such: Hence is that of the Apostle,
2 Cor. 13. 5.
Examine your selves, whether ye be in the faith: prove your own selves. Know
ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be
reprobates? Know ye not, if you have not Christ in you by Faith, ye are
Reprobates? and would be content to be so or so counted? Nay, can you be
content till you know you are otherwise? Therefore shake off, and be sure to be
rid of all the marks of Reprobates; Marks of such as are Reprobates.
Namely, 1. Ignorance, whether enforced (for want of means) or affected, for
knowledge is the ground of faith and other graces; John 3. 19.
Therefore its condemnation* that light is come into the world, See 2 Thessalonians. 1.
8.
and men love darkness: John 10. 4.
Christ is known of his, and knows them again. 1 John 5. 20.
2. Unbelief, Whosoever believes not, is condemned already: Through this were
the Israelites excluded out of Canaan, John 3. 18.
and perished; Heb. 3. 19.
and through this were they broke off: Romans 11. 20.
As many as are ordained to eternal life believe. Mat. 7. 23.
3. Disobedience to the Word, See Romans 1.
to such shall Christ say one day, 2 Timothy 3.
Depart from me all ye workers of iniquity. 4. To stumble at Christ and at the
Word, upon occasion picked, as we see in this Text. So Apostasy, impenitent
living in any known sin, especially after much warning and means, hatred of
Gods servants, hardness of heart, security, and the like. Now is it not fearful
that men can go on, and are not troubled about this? that they can carry their
black marks about them, and yet be merry? O fearful and desperate mirth! If one
should be condemned to be hanged drawn and quartered, and had an iron hanged on
him as a mark of it, and were let go up and down for a few days, if he were
merry and jocund, what would we say? yet thus does the world: O awaken your
selves! Does not this concern you? O come out of your ignorane and unbelief,
and never give over till you get something that a Reprobate never had, cannot
have! See Mat. 7. 22.
I tell you they may go far, and have so gone, therefore look well about you: A
number have not gone so far as a number of Reprobates (in Knowledge, Utterance,
Profession, hearing the Word with joy, reverence to the Preachers thereof,
Reformation in many things, etc.) who yet think well of themselves: O fearful,
that men can be so wretchless in so weighty a matter! Awaken your selves, I
beseech you, Romans 13. 3^
and know one thing is needful; as the Apostle, Will thou then not be afraid of
the power? do that which is good: So if thou would not be afraid of
reprobation, live godly, for such cannot be Reprobates. Faith, true and
particular, and Sanctification throughout, make a man a Christian; this an
Hyprocrite has not: So an humble and contrite heart, a vehement longing after
Christ, an high prizing of him, a vehement desire to turn to God in all things;
these an Hypocrite has not.

But if it be unchangeable, Object.
then what shall I do? I Will never stir and trouble my self, but take my
pleasure, etc. for if I shall be damned, I shall so be whatsoever I do; I Will
never hear Sermon more while I live, for all the Sermons of the world will not
help me, if I be ordained to Damnation.

O the folly and falsehood of this blind and desperate rage! Solut.
Its not possible for him that is ordained to life to live as he list: If thou
give thy self so to do, thou have then indeed a mark to thy self of thy
Damnation; yea, what a desperate wretch is he to resolve himself to live like a
reprobate, before he know whether he be one or no? as if one should run to the
gallows, and put the rope about his neck, before he know whether the Judge has
any purpose to condemn him. Again, know you not that whom God ordains to the
end, he ordains also to the means? Therefore these must be used. As for Gods
decree toward you, the Preacher knows not, therefore he must preach and call
all to Repentance; neither do you know, therefore must you hear and follow the
revealed will of God, and by obeying that, you shall in time come to know his
secret will: We must not live by the secret, but by the revealed will of God;
and we must not stand upon that desperately and blindely at first, If I be
ordained, etc. but meekly hear the will of God in his Word, which being
followed of us, it will be in time an Argument that we not are only no
Reprobates, See a Sermon of Mr. New-house, on 1 Thessalonians. 5. the Epistle to the
Reader.
but such as are ordained to Salvation: But if thou will desperately shake off
the revealed will, and only run upon the secret, and cast off all means that
should do thee good, and run into sin and means of destruction, then thou have
a bad sign of Reprobation: Whosoever stumbleth at Christ, and at the Word, and live
in disobedience, and so continue to the end, its certain they are Reprobate;
and so long as any continues in that state, they can have no other knowledge
of themselves. Thus of the fourth.

Verse 9. But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a
peculiar people, that ye should show forth the praises of him who has called
you out of darkness into his mavelous light.
NOw he returns to the Believers again, and having spoken grievous things of
the wicked, that they stumbled at Christ and the Word, and should perish; lest
they should be dismayed, as if this also might be their case (some of them
having been very grievous sinners) he now endeavors to prevent this their fear,
But ye (says he) are a chosen generation; as if he should have said, They
stumbled, because they were ordained to it, but you shall stand, because you
are elected of God: Thus he comforts them, and reckons up a number of
privileges, whereof Gods election was the ground; as, that they were a royal
priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people; in all which he opposes them to
the Unbelievers; You are a chosen generation, they a reprobate rout; You a
royal priesthood, they a profane and base company; You an holy nation, they
(whether Gentiles or Jews) an unholy company; You a peculiar people, they the
servants of sin and Satan: Then sets down the end of all.

In general observe we two things, Observe.


1. That the Apostle not only divides the people into good and bad, Ministers
must speak comfortably to the good, contrarily to the bad.
and sends the Sheep to their fold, the Fox to his den, but he speaks exceeding
comfortably to the good, exceeding terribly to the wicked; setting forth the
ones happiness, and the others misery; and so must the Ministers of God do.

2. That he delivers the Word so warily, Observe.
that the godly might not be dismayed at the threatenings against the wicked:
They are warily to deliver the Word, that each may take his due portion.
Hence may Ministers learn wisdom, to give every one their portion; and this is
to divide the Word aright, to cut and part it, not to rend it. Thus the
Prophets having vehemently threatened, by and by, lest the godly should be cast
down, add comforts and promises: When they deliver comforts, they must bid the
wicked stand off; so when they speak of judgments, they must so speak, that
the afflicted in Conscience may not be troubled, for people are ready to
misapply that they hear: Wicked men when they catch hold of the Doctrine of
Gods mercy, they snatch that which no way belongs to them; and for humble ones
in affliction of Conscience, Oh, all terrible things they can apply, and they
work on them, but the promises and comforts they cannot fasten on.

In particular consider we the privileges here mentioned, and the end of them.

A chosen generation,] What election is.
This is the first privilege. Election is the decree of God, whereby in
himself, and for his own glory, he has unchangeably ordained some men to
Salvation and life Eternal: Where consider,

1. That God before the world has ordained some men to Salvation: Doctr.
This is plain from these Scriptures, God before the world has ordained some
men to Salvation.
Luke 10. 20. Ephesians. 1. 4. Phil. 2. 12. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 9. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13. His
election is compared to a Book, and the Lord to a General, that books his
Soldiers names, or a Corporation where they book all the Freemens names. Again,
we see some men be saved, therefore were it so decreed; for whatsoever is, was
eternally decreed of God.

1. This sets out the infinite love of God to mankind, Use 1.
who might have been glorified in the Damnation of us all.

2. This confutes that Opinion, Use 2.
That God elected none before the World, but that he generally appointed all to
be saved alike, and therefore gave Christ to dye for all, and when any receive
grace, then God elects them: Does every wise man set down certainly his end,
before he begin his work? and only the God of Wisdom go uncertainly to work?
And did Christ lay down his life for any other but his sheep? vouchsafes he
intercession for any other? nay, excludes he not all others? If Christ had
dyed for them, then they should have been saved, for his death is infinitely
meritorious: If he dyed for any, and they not be saved, he should miss of his
purpose.

Adam and Christ are two common persons, Object.
and roots; therefore as Adam lost all, so Christ restored all.

They are indeed alike in many respects, Sol.
as namely in this, That they communicate to others that which was in
themselves; Adam, sin, and death; Christ, righteousness and life, but not to
both alike: Adam lost all, Christ recovered but some.

Then Adams sin was of more force then Christ's death and obedience. Obj.


Not so, Sol.
for its easier to destroy, then to build: If Christ had saved but one, it had
argued more force then Adams sin to destroy all: A child can break a glass,
which all the men in the Town cannot make up again, yet the child has not
more force then they.

Why then is Christ preached to them? Obj.


Christ must be offered to all, Sol.
for we know not who they be for whom Christ dyed; let us take knowledge of
Gods Ordinance, all be not saved, for there is no Election where all are taken.
Besides, if he did Elect all, and all be not saved (as we know they are not)
then is God hindered of his will, Psalm. 115. 3. and 135. 6.
which were impious to imagine: He does whatsoever he will, and man cannot
overruled his will.

2. That the cause why God ordained some men to Salvation, Doctr.
was, The cause hereof was because he would
because he would; I will have mercy, says he, on whom I will have mercy; Its
according to the good pleasure of his will, nothing out of himself: Romans 9. 15.
He saves no man but by faith in Christ and new obedience, Ephesians. 1. 5.
but this was not the cause of Election, but the will of God only; for we must
put a difference between the Decree of God and the execution thereof.

1. This confutes that opinion of foreseen Faith and Works; Use 1.
Faith and Sanctification are the consequents of Election, See Ephesians. 1. 4. and
2. 10.
and not any thing precedent: God could not see any difference between men,
that some would of their own accord receive grace, believe and obey; for there
is no such thing in our nature, we are all alike: And could no^ the Lord as
well choose men to Salvation freely before the World, as in the World to bestow
grace upon them, denying it to others: and hereof not man's Salvation, but his
own glory is the further end.

2. This ought to bind us to thankfulness and duty to God for ever, Use 2.
that of Free grace has loved us, and to walk humbly before him, acknowledging
nothing in our selves but wretchedness, and that all our welfare, past, present
and to come, is of his free and especial grace; By grace we are saved. Ephesians. 2.


3. That the number of Elect is small; Doctr.
Many called, few chosen: Christ calls his A little flock that shall have the
Kingdom. The number of the Elect small.
True, by themselves they are numberless: The true Israel of Jews and Gentiles
that already are, Mat. 22. 14.
or hereafter to be gathered by the Preaching of Christ and the Gospel, Luke
12. 32.
is to man without count, Rev. 7. 4.
yet if compared to the wicked, Hosea 1. 17.
they are only an handful: As may appear before Christ, when only the little
handful of the Jews was Gods Church, and among them most Hypocrices and
Idolators, few true worshippers of God: Since Christ's coming, and at this time,
what vast Nations know not Christ? What a breadth under Antichrist, that know
him corruptly? and among our selves that have him truly Preached, and offered
in the Word and Sacraments, yet how few believe and obey, and have the inward
calling which should make Election known? And its certain and determined, the
number can be made neither less nor more.

How ought this to whet on our care and diligence to know our selves of this
number? Use.
That which all have, no man greatly esteems; but that which few have, most
strive after, as Wealth, Honor, Offices, etc. so should we in this: If of
Twenty Traitors a Pardon were but for six, what earnestness would be in all to
know whether they were of that small number? Is it not therefore fearful to see
how desperate the world is, that this being so, yet so few lay it to heart, but
rather are so secure, as if very few were appointed to miss of Salvation, and
as if all men's names were written in the book of life? 2 Pet. 1. 10.
But we must give diligence to make our calling and election sure.

4. That they which be Elect cannot but be saved, Doctr.
they cannot perish: God will certainly call them out of the world and their
bad estate, They that be Elect cannot but be saved.
and being effectually called, he will keep them to Salvation that they shall
never perish: He will not lose one, but call them either ordinarily by his Word
Preached, if it be in the Church, or by some extraordinary means, if it be
among Gods enemies: Among our selves they that belong to God shall at one time
or other be brought to the Word, or the Word to them; and hence comes the
removing of the Gospel from place to place. How many have been brought to the
Word upon occasion of a Marriage, or to see their Friends, or to wait on their
Masters, or to speak with some body at Sermon, or to make their Market, or
being provoked by some Neighbor, etc? And hence it is also that when the Word
is Preached, some have their hearts opened, humbled, converted; others remain
blind and impenitent, namely, because God has elected those, not these. True
it is, that the Elect before their calling are as other men, Romans 6. 17.
as bad as the worst; yea, commit any sin that a Reprobate does, 2 Cor. 6. 11.
save that against the Holy Ghost: What were Abraham and Paul? Acts 13. 48.
the one an Idolator, the other a Persecutor? Romans 8. 30.
Hence the World lasts still to gather up the Elect behind; 2 Pet. 3. 9.
Whosoever belong hereto, shall certainly be called.

1. This confutes that blind and desperate speech of them that say, Use 1.
If they be Elect they shall be saved howsoever they live: This cannot be, for
whom God has Elected, he will call, they shall have the means, and they shall
be effectual; therefore thou must come to the means, and pray they may be
effectual: If thou contemnest the means, and wilst not be obedient thereto, its
a certain argument of no Election; for whom he Ordains to the end, he Ordains
also to the means; so also having once effectually called them, he will never
lose them: 2 Timothy 2. 19.
His gifts and calling are without Repentance: The foundation of God stands
sure, having the Seal, The Lord knows them that are his: They may indeed
stumble and fall, but by virtue of Gods Election they shall rise again, as did
Peter and David; Their falling shows their own weakness, their rising the
unchangeableness of Gods Election.

The Apostle speaks to whole Churches, Object.
that they were Elect of God, and yet many fell away.

1. He so speaks in respect of the better part, Sol.
the true Elect among them. 2. In the Judgment of charity, for that they did
outwardly profess the Word of God and live within compass, and so we do, and
must esteem of such till they show the contrary.

Its said, Obj.
Him will I blot out of my book.

Its no more, Exodus 32. 33.
but declare by my Judgment, that they were never written therein, Sol.
by discovering them to be but Hypocrites.

But Moses his wish was, Object.
To be blotted out of the book of life; and Paul's, To be accursed from Christ.
Exodus 32. 32.


These were but to show their fervent affection to the people, Romans 9. 3.
and exceeding zeal to Gods glory, Sol.
not that they could so be.

But says our Savior, Object.
I have chosen you twelve, and one of you is a Devil.

This is meant of an outward choice to the office of Apostleship, Solut.
and not the eternal decree of Gods Election. And

2. This is matter of exceeding comfort to all that can prove themselves of
this number: Use 2.
They must not be dismayed, though they be weak, and see great ones for gifts
revolt and come to nothing: They fell, being ordained thereunto; thou shall
stand, though weak, by virtue of Election: This also comforts when we consider
our own frailty, Satan's subtilty, malice, and diligence, and his great
conquests in the World; though there be matter from hence to make us humble,
and fear, and stand on our watch, yet no cause of despair that we shall fall
finally. True, if we were in Adams case, and our Salvation were in our own hand
to lose, we might so fall; but we are kept of God the Father, he Elected us,
and committed us, and gave us to the Son to be Redeemed, and the Son having so
done, commits us back again to the Father to be kept by his power: John 17. 11.
Therefore we are in a strong hand, and none can pluck us out of it; This
heartens in the service of God, to go on cheerfully in duty. Doctr.


5. That a man may come to know, A man may know and be assured of his Election.
and to be assured of his Election. Hereof see Downhams Spiritual warfare, page
186. where the point is handled. This bewrays the wicked cruelty of the
Papists, See Luke 10. 20.
who for their own gain keep back this comfort from the people, 2 Pet. 1. 10.
making them believe, it were presumption to be assured: but they must be of
good hope (say they) and for the effecting of it, they must go on Pilgrimage to
such and such Saints, do such Works, make Vows to build such a Monastrey,
repair such a Church, and give thus much to the Priest for Trentals, Masses and
Dirges, that if they come into Purgatory, hereby they may be speedily helped
out: O what thanks owe we to God that we are delivered from such Tormentors!
And if any of our Consciences be wounded, we we are led to the Free Grace, and
all-sufficient Merits of Christ, and so are bound up and soundly comforted,
finding that whereon firmly to rest; whereas they leave any in as bad or worse
case then they found them, who having done as they were by them enjoined, are
at as great uncertainty as they were before: So that we under the Gospel save
the extreme toil of our Bodies, the robbing of our Purses, and that which is
worst of all, the discomfort of our Souls (which they under Popery and Popish
Teachers undergo) and are faithfully dealt with by the mercy of God and Merits
of Christ: God has not appointed his Servants to wrestle with Flesh, World,
and Devil, and all opposites, and left them only a blank and uncertain hope,
but an assurance of their Election past, and Salvation to come, which carries
them through all, and is the foundation of a good life.

The Notes of Election are 1. Faith. Notes of Election.
2. Sanctification. 3. Obedience to the Word. 4. Love to the Saints, as may
appear in these Scriptures following; Acts 13. 48. Romans 8. 1. Psalm 15. 2. 2
Peter 1. 5. John 10. 27. with John 3. 14. Epistle the first. These, though some
imagine they have, but have not, as one may dream of great Wealth, yet waking
is Poor; yet as a Rich man may know he is Rich, they that have them, may and do
certainly know they have them; Every of which is required to Salvation.

1. Seeing the Lord has left this to be obtained by the Sons of men here on
Earth, Use 1.
how should this provoke every man with more carefulness then can be expressed
to find out this Pearl? If we upon trial of our selves can prove by these and
the like infallible arguments that we have found it, then may we rejoice above
all rejoicing, yea, more then if we were Crowned Kings to day, for the
privileges of the Elect are most sweet and admirable.

2. O be thankful to God highly, Use 2.
stand and wonder at the greatness and freeness of this favor all thy days,
that he passing by so many thousands as good as thy self, should yet choose
thee!

3. Yea, Use 3.
Covenant to give thy Body, Soul, Life, and all to glorify him in a most
zealous and faithful manner: As a man choosing carefully an Arrow out of his
Quiver, looks it should go right, and fly far over another. O let us do so in
the service of God, and all good works: O what shame is it that such persons as
have this assurance, should be dull and slow If upon trial we cannot find
these notes of Election, What then? Why, what have thou upon trial? O says
some poor soul, if there be no notes of Election but these, I am in a woeful
case, and yet I have been laboring hard about this matter, to make my state
good if it might be possible! Well, you say well, that is a good sign. Are you
utterly lost in your selves? Mat. 5. 3.
Blessed are the poor in spirit: Do thou mourn under the heavy burden of thy
sins? Blessed are they that mourn: Hearing of Blessed are they that do hunger
and thirst after righteousness. And do thou desire

Q. Whether can we be certain of another Election, or not?

A. Certainly we cannot by the same certainty that we may be of our own;
Whether we may be certain of another Election.
but probably we may, and very strongly of some, as we may be sure in every
true visible Church there be some Elect, also we may know particular persons,
Phil. 4. 3.
as John the Elect Lady, and Paul, Clement with others: But for certainty we
cannot, as we know our own by the witness of Gods Spirit to ours, and by the
assurance of Faith; therefore they are proudly conceited; that think they have
so much discerning, as if they be in a man's company a few hours, they can judge
whether he be the child of God or not; fie upon this arrogance: The Disciples
could not do so by living with Judas a good while together, Mat. 26. 22.
but asked, Is it I? There have been some have gone so far, and carried it so
smoothly, as for sundry years they have deceived many, not only of the people,
but of wise and faithful Ministersts; God knows the heart certainly, we may
guess, and the more godly wise any is, the better he can discern; but very
probably, and by the judgment of charity, we may judge more strongly of some
then others, according to the grace of God, and continuance in one duty as in
another, at home as abroad, in prosperity as adversity, yea, suffering for the
truth, abiding constant in a godly course: They that have experience and
knowledge what is necessary to Salvation, will look for these, and rest in
nothing else: This we may have of others, and this every man ought to labor to
lay up in the hearts of his Neighbors. A man must not only lay up good
evidence in his own conscience of his Election, but give as full a Testimony to
the conscience of others as may be: This is a Crown to a man while he lives, an
Honor when he is dead, better then a good ointment, then silver and gold, Prove.
22. 1.
a comfort to his Friends, a credit to them that are left behind.

1. This condemns them that so walk, Use 1.
as charity it self cannot speak well of them, or esteem them in the state of
grace, or any of Gods Elect, What shall be said of these when they be dead?
There Is an old bibbing carnal man dead, a proud young man, a wicked woman of a
very malicious heart, etc. To speak well of these were to sin against
conscience and the truth it self.

2. Them also as walk so odly, Use 2.
as though in some things they give good hope, yet they are either suspected to
abide in some known sin, or take their liberty so much in gaming, or give such
way to some notable corruptions, be so unreasonable hasty, so covetous and
worldly, as men have no sound persuasion; but being asked of them living or
dead, they that are of understanding can give no confident or comfortable, but
a lame and imperfect Testimony. This is indeed a pitiful thing: O leave
something to comfort thy Wife, Friends, Kindred, when thou art dead, that they
may not mourn excessively, as without hope, but may with others be persuaded
thou art gone to God! O leave behind thee a sweet memorial of thy self!

A royal priesthood, Observe.
] Here Is a second privilege of Believers, cited (as it seems) out of Exodus
19. 5, 6. By Christ they are made Kings, Christians through Christ are made
Kings, Priests and Prophets.
Priests, and Prophets: O what a privilege and admirable advancement it is,
that being by nature servants of sin and Satan, they should be made Kings, and
so profane, that they had nothing to do to draw near to God, may now be
Priests, and offer Sacrifices to God? where may be noted by the way, that even
in the time of the Law, Christ and the Gospel was also Preached to the Jews,
Christ and the Gospel preached in time of the Law.
for they could not come to these privileges, by the legal Sacrifices, but by
the Lord Jesus: And therefore wickedly do they, that imagine God fed the
Israelites only with outward benefits, and that they had no spiritual things,
1 Cor. 10. 1, 2.
which is contrary to the Scriptures: John 8. 56.
Abraham saw Christ's day, and the godly also among them saw the Messiah, though
darkly. Again,

What Moses spoke indefinitely to all the people, Observe.
the Apostle here applies the same particularly to Believers, The promises and
privileges laid down in the Scriptures belong only to Gods Elect.
Gods Elect, to whom only the promises and privileges appertain, and they
ought to apply them and make them their own, wherewith the wicked are not to
meddle. To a wicked man there is not a comfortable word spoken in all the
Scriptures, while he so abides: Methinks he should be weary of his part, Acts
1. 25.
and begin to turn in truth to God; for then begins he to come within compass
of these blessed promises and privileges, not before: Nothing belongs to the
wicked, but sin, and thereby the curses of God here, and Hell hereafter; as it
was Judas his own place. Observe.


This privilege flows from our Election, Election is the foundation of all the
good which comes to us.
which is the foundation of all good that comes to us here and hereafter: And
to become Kings, Priests and Prophets, who were by nature slaves of sin,
abominable to God, and altogether darkness in matters of Salvation; we obtain
by the means of the Lord Jesus, Christ how our King, Priest and Prophet.
who was our Mediator, and anointed King, Priest and Prophet, and discharged by
the fullness of the Spirit, which was in him above measure, these offices for
our Salvation: Our King, to gather, guide, defend us, and overthrow our
Enemies, Men and Devils: Our Priest, to offer up himself a Sacrifice to God for
us, and to make continual Intercession on our behalf: and our Prophet, to teach
us all that is necessary to know to Salvation; and not this only, but he was
King, Priest and Prophet, to make us such by conveighing a measure of that
Spirit which is in him above measure, to enable us hereto. As Aaron being
anointed with the holy oil, it ran down on the skirt of his Garment, so did
this from Christ to all his Members; on Rev. 1. 6.
But of these three dignities I have elsewhere spoken.

Only see what kind of persons believers be, Observe.
other manner of ones then the world makes account: Believers are others then
the world thinks for.
They are Kings I tell you, Heirs of a Kingdom, as meanly as the world thinks
of them; and as little as they be in their own eyes, and as Kings they conquer
and overruled those that conquer and overruled the Devil, the World, and the
Flesh: They are also Priests, and may come with confidence into the presence of
God, and bring Sacrifices that through Christ Jesus shall be well accepted of
God* and show their Faces where the wicked may not come, though never so
mighty; They are also Prophets to teach, and their lips feed many.

1. Therefore they are to be highly thankful for this high advancement, Use 1.
and labor to walk worthy of it, not in any carnal pride, but in all godly
humility, but yet with notable courage and all true thankfulness to God: See
Calvin on this place.
This yet remember, that though Kings, yet its Spiritual, and therefore hinders
not subjection and obedience to civil Kings and Magistrates; which I speak,
because Anabaptists do by such colors elude and take away the authority of
Magistrates, and exempt themselves from them: 1 Timothy 6. 1.
So Servants are to be obedient to their Masters, though not yet godly; and to
walk humbly, christianly and wisely, so every Christian is to give men their
titles, and their due according to their place, yea, though they be bad.

2. Let all take heed how they meddle with these: Use 2.
Reproach not, rail not on them: He that defends them is mighty: Abuse not them
whom God has so highly advanced; If thou knew what they were, thou would
fall down and kiss the ground on which they stand: Be not an Ishmael, lest thou
be cast out of the house; I tell thee its an ill mark: Saul, Saul, why
persecutest (said Christ) thou me: many shall be condemned at the last day for
not doing them good, what shall then become of thee, if thou do them any hurt?
I Will tell you a far better way, Take knowledge of their happy estate, and labor
to be one of them, though despised in the world, yet of account with God and
Angels: Prove. 12. 26.
Its well said, The Righteous is more excellent then his neighbor, etc. on the
contrary, consider the woeful estate of the wicked; For what be they? be they
Kings, Priests or Prophets? no such matter, Believers be so: They be Kings,
Priests and Prophets, but the wicked are the slaves of sin and Satan, slaves to
the flesh, to their own lusts, to the world: What though they be rich, yea,
though they be Emperors, and not Believers, they are the vassels of Satan, and
have nothing but their drudgery in sin, and Hell for their own place as their
desert: Neither are they Priests, but profane ones, let them stand off, for
the holy God cannot abide unholy persons; they and their Sacrifice are
abomination to the Lord: They offer no Sacrifices at all of Prayer, Praise or
Alms, or if they do, its abominable, because they offer not themselves soul and
body to God first; but they offer themselves to the Devil, and him they serve
with body and soul, might and main: Neither are they Prophets, but dumb beasts,
not savoring of the mysteries of Gods Kingdom, or if uttering any thing
thereof, yet their ill lives disgrace it again: O that such considering their
own base, and the others happy estate, would have an holy emulation to be as
they; and indeed nothing in this world is worthy to be envied but a Christian:
Humble therefore thy self for thy sin past, turn to God for thy pardon in
Christ, and labor to have thy part in him, and by him, and by Faith in him,
thou shall attain to be a Christian, and so consequently a King, Priest and
Prophet, and be enabled to the duties of the same.

An holy nation, The Jews why termed an holy nation.
] Here Is a third privilege, not meant of all the Jews, but of the elect among
them (and of all believing Gentiles, as Acts 2. 38, 39.) so called, Psa. 147.
19, 20
1. Because they had the Oracles of God, the Word and Sacraments, Object.
which no other had.

This belonged to all the Jews. Solut.


True, but it might be said, that they only had them, which had the power of
them to the conversion of their souls and Salvation; and others had them not,
which had no fruit and benefit by them. 2. Because they were sanctified and set
aside by special grace to be holy ones to the Lords use.

Note then, That

All that be the Lords, Doctr.
are holy persons; that is, Not only having Christ's holiness imputed to them,
All that be the Lords company ore holy persons.
but in whom God works inherent Righteousness and Holiness by his Spirit,
conveying virtue from Christ's death to kill sin, and from his Resurrection, to
raise them to newness of life, See Ephe. 1. 4.
to alter and change them throughout in soul, spirit and body: 1 Thessalonians. 4. 2.
and 5. 23.
This though not perfect in any, yet is sound and upright in them all,
therefore he gives them his holy Word, and holy Spirit to work this, and holy
Sacraments to increase it; and its requisite, Heb. 12. 14.
that as God is holy, so also all his should so be; and these be they shall see
his face with comfort, Acts 20. 32. and 26. 18.
no other, and for these only is Heaven prepared.

O let every man examine himself, whether he be a sanctified person or not; if
yea, Then

1. To thy comfort know hereby, Use.
thou art one of the Lords number, a greater privilege then to be written
among the Potentates of the earth: Comfort and Counsel for sanctified persons.
There Is Consolation to thee, thou were elected, and shall be glorified.

2. Seeing thou art set aside for the Lords use, and sanctified in body and
soul, never defile thy self again, or put any part of thy body and soul to any
common or unholy use of sin or Satan. In the Law it was ever most fearful to
take any Consecrated thing, as the Holy Oil, Shewbread, or Vessels, and put
them to any common use; so is it that we should put Hand, Foot or Tongue to any
use of sin or corruption, for any part of our souls or lives: Oh, many
contrarily can let loose their tongue to impatient, proud, and most unseemly
speeches, yea and their bodies and minds; some to excessive following the
world, as they were wont, and as worldlings do; and some after their pleasures
and vanities: O that we would grow and abound in Sanctification, that here
having our fruit in holiness, we may have the end everlasting life.

If not, but contrarily you either live in profaneness, the open breach of
some of the Commandments, or be only superstitiously holy in some odd
devotions, The misery of those that are unsanctified, with advice to them to
come out of this condition.
and loose in other things; as Papists, and a number of old Folks, or such as
have a counterfeit holiness in the first Table, and make no conscience of the
duties of the second; or contrarily civil persons, that seem very just in the
second Table, but savor nothing of the duties of the first Table: Know you are
yet unsanctified persons, and therefore out of Gods number; you may be members
of the visible Church, Psalm. 15. 1, 2.
where good and bad, chaff and corn are, but not of the invisible who only are
sanctified ones: Let such be what they will be, having Wit, Learning, Wealth,
Wisdom, Civility, all skill of Languages, yea, if they could measure the
Heavens, number the Stars* etc. and be not sanctified, they are of the Devils
rabble, Romans 6. 21.
and shall perish everlastingly: O that you would awake out of your courses;
What fruit have ye had, or look ye to have therein? The end of these things is
death: Come to the Word, crave the Holy Spirit, desire Pardon and
Sanctification; till this be, you are not out of the state of Damnation, and
all things are impure to you, Tit. 1. 15.
Word, Sacraments, yea your Meat, Drink, Apparel, etc.

A peculiar people, Obs.
] That is, a people proper to the Lord, which he himself has purchased, The
Church Gods peculiar people.
and which he now takes as his own, and sets great store by, called therefore
his secret ones, whom he keeps under his protection, Deuteronomy. 32. 8, 9.
to whom also he reveals his secrets, his Beloved ones, his Spouse, his Love,
his undefiled, as the Apple of his eye, the Signet on his right hand, See Isa.
49.
whom he cannot forget. In the flood he saved his Church, when all others were
drowned; he saved Lot, when Sodom was destroyed; he makes more account of one
Christian, then of thousands of others: If one of them pray, its so forcible,
that he says, Let me alone; and if thousands of wicked, its but as the howling
of Dogs, an abomination: They are his glory, all the world are dross to them,
Isa. 4. 5.
vile persons, and base: The wicked though never so many, are but servants to
the Church, as the seven Nations were to make the Land of Canaan fit for the
people of God; yea even then, when they seem to dominier most over them, they
are but their drudges: They as a wisp scour the Church, to make it bright in
the eyes of God, but the wisp is to be cast into the fire; they are Gods rod to
bring it to obedience; when that's effected, the rod is to be flung into the
fire. And

No marvel though the Lord set such store by his Church, No marvel though he
set much by it
seeing he has been at such cost therewith; as to Redeem it with the blood of
his Son, and to give his Spirit thereto to graft and unite it to Christ, and to
sanctify and make it like himself: How dear are our children to us? God has
made us sons, nay heirs; the Lands we purchase be dear to us, we are Gods
purchase; our members be dear to us, God has made us members of his Son.

1. Oh, Use 1.
if we be so peculiar and choice to the Lord, how choycely should we walk? how
should we set as great store by the Lord and his Commandments, as he has done
by us? He has chosen us for his inheritance; we should choose him for our
portion, and make him so, and his Word our Heritage as David did: O how warily
should we walk! Zech. 12. 8.
Every Christians ought to be one of a thousand, the least as David, and the
greatest of the Angel as God: we should shine so among others, as Moses his
face shone when he came down from the Lord, that we may straight be discerned
by our conversation, who and what we are: O how does this tax the coldness and
carelessness of many Christians, in whom who can view any singular thing? but we
ought to be singular persons: They omit duties in their Families, or slubber
them over, as many Hypocrites, who can upon any occasion be as froward,
impatient, worldly, as any other: Is it not requisite that such as the Lord
has been at such cost with, as to Elect them, Redeem them, call them by his
Word and Spirit, Sanctify them, etc. should be extraordinary persons? we
should be much in those duties that the World and Hypocrites do not meddle
with, as private Prayer, Examination, Watchfulness, yea, against secret
corruption, and in those we do, we must perform them after another fashion then
heretofore.

2. This is a comfort that God makes such special reckoning of his; Use 2.
therefore though we have many and mighty Enemies, yet we need not fear: God is
on our side, he is about us, as the Mountains about Jerusalem; they must dig
down God ere they can come at his, overcome God ere they can conquer his.

3. Terror to the wicked; Use 3.
How dare they meddle to hurt or persecute any of these little ones, Judges 5.
23.
lest their Angel be let loose to destroy them? If Meroz were cursed for not
helping them, what shall they be that harm them? They that rail on them, mock
and misuse them, would do further if opportunity served.

4. The wicked are of no reckoning with God, Use 4.
for they be like the Devil, and do nothing but sin against God, and are his
Enemies; The wicked are as chaff and darnel, the godly as wheat; the good as
the fish in the net, the wicked as weeds and frogs; the good as the vine, the
bad as the nettles and brambles; the good as the tree planted by the rivers of
waters, Psalm. 1. 3.
etc. the wicked as barren, nay, hurtful trees; the godly be like good ground,
Heb. 6. 8.
the wicked like that which bears thorns and briars: This should make them see
their base condition, and set less by themselves, seeing God sets nothing by
them, and join themselves to the Lords people, and labor to be such.

That ye should show forth the praises of him, etc.] The end of all these
privileges and this cost is, that we might show forth by word and deed all the
virtues of God, his Mercy, Patience, Wisdom, Goodness, etc. showed in our
Election, Redemption, Vocation, Sanctification, etc. Where note.

1. That God has not bestowed this cost on us in vain, Obs.
but that we might both sound out his praises with our mouths, Gods glory the
end of all the privileges bestowed on us
and throughout out whole life show forth the same: O how infinitely stand we
indebted to him; But where is our zeal any thing answerable to the least of
these unspeakable mercies vouchsafed unto us?

2. That he did not Elect us, Obs.
because he foresaw we would show forth his virtues, We were Elected of God,
that we might show forth his praises.
but that we might so do; If he had foreseen any works in us, we might then
have showed forth our own Merits, as his Virtues, but that's contrary to this
Text and the whole course of Scripture: Ephesians. 1. 4.
Therefore we may say herein, Not unto us, but unto thy name give the glory. 2 Timothy 1. 9.


3. That he Elected us, Obs.
not to be idle, but to show forth his Virtues; We were not Elected to be idle,
etc.
and this confuteth the Opinion of those that hold the Doctrine of Election,
and the unchangeableness thereof to be a Doctrine of Liberty, Use.
and a gap to all licentiousness: But he chose us, that we should be holy, Ephesians.
1. 4.
and that not in show to please men, but before him, even so as he requires
and accepts.

4. That the furthest end of our Election is Gods glory, Obs.
not our Salvation. Gods glory the furthest end of our Election.
True, he propounded that too, but not as the furthest end: So he ordained some
to Damnation, not that simply he takes pleasure in their destruction, See Prove.
16. 4.
but to set forth his glory, even the glory of his power and justice in their
just condemnation; Romans 9. 23.
so would he be glorified in his mercy in the Salvation of the Elect. Ephesians. 1.
5, 6.
Hence learn we

To make the glory of God the end of all our actions, Use.
and nothing else, not profit, not pleasure, not preferment, no not the
Salvation of our own souls; we must not Hear, Meditate, Pray, keep the Sabbath,
fly from Sin, do good to save our Souls, (for then we seek our selves) but
that God may be glorified; the other must be minded in the second place.

Who has called you,] He describes God by a special benefit bestowed upon
them, namely, their effectual calling from sin to grace; and this he does to
confirm them in their Election, whereof he had spoken before, Doctr.
by which they might prove the same.

Note then that effectual calling is a certain argument of our Election;
Effectual calling is a certain argument of Election.
I say effectual calling, because there is 1. An outward calling common to the
Reprobate ( as many are called, but few are chosen) and 2. An inward and
effectual calling, Two sorts of calling, outward and inward.
when the Spirit goes with the outward means, and boars through the ear of the
heart, and opens the eyes, and breaks through all lets, and enlightens and
changes a man admirably, who before was not at all moved when he heard the very
same things: when God deals with the Reprobate, he calls them outwardly, but
when with his Elect, he goes to work with his Spirit, James 1. 18.
which passes the power of Man or Angels; the work is the Lords.

The outward instrument of effectual calling, Obs.
is principally the Ministry of the Word; The word the outward instrument
hereof.
other things may prepare (as the fire heats the iron, but the hammer
fashioneth it) as affections, the good conversation of others, and the like:
Thus the Jailor was by an Earthquake, 1 Pet. 3. 1.
some are gastered, and first smitten (yet rarely) by some fear in the night,
Acts 16. 26.
or at some other time fearful thoughts lay hold on them: But this is not
conversion (its no other then may be in a Reprobate) after they are brought by
counsel to the Word, where it may be they receive conversion, and even that
terror of conscience though it were occasioned by some outward thing, yet it is
the Word that indeed works it, as which tells them both of their sin and danger.

The parts of it, The parts of effectual calling.
are 1. An enlightening of the understanding, with a distinct knowledge of the
principal points of Salvation. 2. The opening of the heart to believe. 3. The
changing of the whole man from that ill nature that was in him to a quite
contrary: The Law prepares and make them see their deadly danger, and by the
Spirit, makes to feel it grievously, and then the Gospel works by little and
little, hope to comfort, and so a change.

The cause that moves the Lord to do this to any, Obs.
is his mere mercy, and no desert, Gods free mercy the cause hereof.
as is Election and Redemption, so is our effectual calling free: And this
inward effectual calling is an infallible argument of Election past, 2 Timothy 1.
9.
and glory to come: They are links of the golden chain of man's Salvation, Romans
8. 30.
that cannot by all the Devils be sundred, 2 Pet. 1. 10.
but have one and have all.

Hereupon me thinks every man's heart should burn within him to prove his
calling, Every one must endeavor to prove his calling.
that hereby he might have a mark of his Election: They that can prove it, may
have exceeding comfort; and they must also beware, Romans 12. 2.
lest being calling out of the world to God, they look any more back, Ephesians. 4. 1.
or be more and more defiled with the fashions and manners thereof; and every
day in hearing the Word, obey every part thereof, and walk worthy of your holy
Calling: Much are they to be blamed that do no more honor their Calling, but
drop into things like men of this world, yea, are overcome of the world and
covetousness.

But happily thou doubtest of thy Calling, because thou find not these fruits,
or not so plentifully as thou would; be not discouraged, though thou be
dull, and full of infirmities, and strong corruptions, yet unfainedly hating
and resisting them, and being grieved at them, and using the means against
them, thou art not to call thy foundation into question; yet must thou humble
thy self, and as occasion requires, set on more earnestly, use the means more
carefully, and daily renew thy repentance. But for those that show no fruits of
their Calling, but though they have had the Word, and been Hearers, yet remain
profane and impenitent altogether, or seeming to go some steps, yet are not
changed throughout through Faith, they are not yet called; for never imagine
that every one that hears Sermons, yea usually, and with joy, and mends many
things, and lives in some good fashion, is straight truly called: not only the
highway ground, but even the stony, yea thorny, which went far, and beyond
most in Congregations, yet were not effectually called; and numbers among our
selves, that think well of themselves, are not truly called, are not Believers,
nor turned to God: Well, let every man examine himself thoroughly; being not
called, I dare not speak a word of comfort to you in this case, you have not
only no mark of Election, but the contrary, when God has by all means called,
as by promises, threatenings, etc. and none have prevailed: O now use the means
with all diligence, and though hitherto you have disobeyed the words of Gods
calling, yet let them now open the doors of your hearts! If you do, Prove. 1. 28.
God will be merciful and blot out all; if you will not, when you shall
hereafter call, you shall not be heard: and you which would not obey this
gracious voice of the Gospel, to believe and repent that you might be saved,
shall one day hear another kind of voice from him, which you shall obey, nill
you will you, to your own confusion.

Out of darkness into his mavelous light.] Here are the parts of calling,
both from whence and whereto. What to understand by darkness.


By darkness is meant ignorance of Christ Jesus, and sin, which are the works
of darkness, and tend to utter darkness; In this case they were.

How could these Jews be said to be in darkness which had the Law, Obj.
and were skilful therein, Romans 2. 17.
and stood not a little upon it?

They had knowledge of the Law, Sol.
but Christ Jesus, John 17. 3.
the accomplishment of the Law, they knew not, to know whom aright is life
everlasting: All knowledge without this is nothing but darkness still; so that
he means not, that they were without the means of knowledge, as the Gentiles
were, for one may have the means, and yet be in darkness; nor that they were
called out of ignorance to some knowledge by the means, for one may have much
knowledge, and yet be in darkness; but that they were called out of darkness,
that is; out of ignorance of Christ and Salvation by him, out of the state of
corruption and sin, and working the works of darkness, and going to utter
darkness.

To his light, What by light.
that is, to know Christ by a saving particular, and effectual knowledge to
Sanctification and Holiness of life, which are the works of the light, and so
to the hope of the eternal light of happiness. Hereunto they were called out of
the state of unbelief and sin, which tend to death; for so sin is called
darkness, and holiness light: Sin is termed darkness, because it comes from the
Devil the Prince of darkness, loves darkness, and goes to darkness: Holiness
comes from light, even God the Father of lights loves and can abide the light,
and goes to light, 1 John 1. 5.
and God the Fountain of Holiness is called light. Here note*

What every man's estate is till he be called, Observe.
even that we are not only darkened, Every unregenerate person is darkness.
but darkness it self: We were all made light in Adam, full of knowledge and
holiness, since the fall we are all darkness, and when God means to save any,
Ephesians. 4. 17. and 5. 8.
he pulls them out of darkness: Darkness has a power indeed, Acts 26. 18.
which were it not for the Almighty power of God delivering us therefrom, Col.
1. 13.
would hold us under for ever; and as long as we be in this darkness, 1 John 1.
6.
we have no right to the Kingdom of God, nay we have nothing to do with God, we
are neither his sons, people nor servants: The man that is not effectually
called and sanctified (what gifts soever he has) is yet in darkness, and never
wrought other then the works of darkness: He may do good things, and the works
of light, but they be not so in him, being darkly performed by corrupt nature,
without Faith or the Spirit, neither tending to the right end: This may be said
of every unregenerate person, though never so old, civil, or of good parts.

1. This confutes the Papists, Use 1.
that teach that there are some such pure Naturals left in man, some Free Will
to goodness, which if God stir up a little and help, can work; and that they
can merit of Congruity, which crosses both this and other Scriptures, as, That
the thoughts of man's heart are only evil continually; Genesis 6. 5.
That the wisdom of the flesh is enmity with God; Romans 8. 7.
and, Ephesians. 2. 1.
That we are dead in trespasses and sins.

2. This should make the world weary of their part: Use 2.
O that a man had but wisdom enough to persuade all ignorant persons that they
be in darkness, and going to Hell; nay, all persons of what parts soever, that
being void of Faith, and not sanctified, they are in this case: Its not because
they are not so, but because they are so deep in darkness, as all that can be
said to them from God about the same, cannot so persuade them, but that they
love darkness more then light, cannot away to be called out of it, think their
case as good as others; Awake thou that sleep, and stand up, Christ shall
give thee light. Who would abide in a dark Dungeon, that might be abroad in the
light? in Egypt, when he might be in Goshen with Gods children? Men think
because they have the light of the Sun, and their eyes to see, they think that
they be not in darkness, but their Souls be in most woeful darkness: Never think
to work the works of darkness, and yet come to the light of Heaven.

Into his mavelous light. Observe.
] This is opposed to darkness; therefore hereby is meant saving knowledge of
Christ, Every true Believer is brought into the saving knowledge of Christ.
which is life Eternal, and true Light, Holiness, and Sanctification, the hope
of Heaven, and the inheritance of the Saints in light: This is not only light,
but mavelous light, either in respect of the contrary darkness, or in respect
of it self. This is the estate of every Believer, of every sanctified person.

1. This shows the infinite odds between the true Christian, Use 1.
and those that be not so; and that not only between Pagans that have no
means, who be deep and every way in darkness, but even between Christians, and
them that have both means, and it may be knowledge, yet are still unconverted
and unsanctified persons: The one is in light, 1 Ioh. 1. 7.
the other in darkness; John 8. 44.
the one have fellowship with God, the other with the Devil: O that men saw the
odds! they would not only not judge their own case so good, and despise the
servants of God as they do, Zech. 8. 23.
but would reverence them, and take hold of their skirt, and say, We will go
with you.

2. It teaches Christians brought into this mavelous light, Use 2.
how to walk as children of the light, and to have nothing to do with the
unfruitful works of darkness, but to reprove them, nor with the workers of
iniquity; But how few thus walk* O let our conversation be honest, and our
light so shine, that we may lighten others: Being herein like God, we may be
assured we are going to everlasting light.

Verse 10. Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God;
which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
HE adds to the heap another mercy to stir them up to the thankfulness he
speaks of; and to the end the mercy and benefit may be seen to be the greater,
he sets it out by the contrary, comparing the time present with the time past,
when it was far otherwise with them; and as he compared them with others
before, so he compares them now with themselves.

Which in time past, etc.] Here the Apostle alludeth to Hos. 1. 10. where the
Lord sets out both the sins and punishment of the ten Tribes under a Typical
marriage of the Prophet with a notorious Strumpet, which was not a thing verily
done, but to set the more lively before their eyes their Sins and Idolatries;
as under the name of those supposed children, were set out the punishments that
God meant to send upon them for the same; as, That they should be scattered
abroad, That God would have no mercy on them, and lastly, which was worst of
all, That they should not be his people; all which were accordingly fulfilled:
For first they were carried Captive of the Assyrians, and there retained some
remnants of the Worship of God in a corrupt manner, and kept together; but after
when the Medes and Persians prevailed over the Assyrians, they were then
scattered over the Nations so far and wide, as they had no part of Gods Worship
remaining among them, but were so mingled among the Heathen, as they became no
people of God at all, but altogether wrapped in all the manners of the Heathen
Nations with whom they lived: This is that here meant, when he says, They were
not the people of God, etc. And lest the good among them should be altogether
dismayed, as though God had broken his Covenant, he promises, That the time
should come, that he would receive them into his favor again, which was now
accomplished, as the Apostle says, When by the Gospel they were gathered to
the Faith of the Lord Jesus.

In that he sets before them the time past, and what they were, Note, That for
a people or particular persons to look to their beginnings, Observe.
is of good and singular use: For a people or particular persons to look to
their beginnings is of good use.
As for us, who since Christ's coming are admitted to the same privileges with
the Jews, have the Gospel Preached, Christ Jesus offered, Grace given to
receive him, the Word and Sacraments to assure us of him, Heaven opened to us
as well as they; for us, I say, being thus, and having the truth, and only way
of Salvation Preached to us by Jesus Christ: To consider what we were will be
of great use, as that we were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel,
Strangers, drowned in Idolatry and all Sin, without knowledge of the true God,
but woshiping the Devil in stead of the true God; that in the days and under
the Tyranny of Antichrist, we were held in blindeness, made to worship Images,
taught to believe that we must be saved by Masses, Man's Merits, Popes Pardons,
scared with Purgatory, thinking that then we did God high service, when we most
dishonored him: So to consider with our selves what we were before our Calling,
Ignorant, in Unbelief, Profane, the servants of Sin, slaves of Satan, in
Darkness, loving Sin as our lives, hating the Word and all goodness, etc. and
what we are now through Gods mercy, will be of great use. For

This serves, Reason 1.
1. To make us humble, and take down our pride: Therefore, when the Israelites
would so brag of Abraham, and Jacob, or Israel, that they were their Seed and
Posterity, the Lord by his Prophets would tell them, and what was Abraham, but
a poor Idolater in the Land of Ur of the Caldees, and a lone man, a dry stick,
and Sarah barren? and what was Israel? was he not a fugitive, as it were, fain
to fly for his life into Mesopotamia, and so poor, as he went only with his
staff in his hand, there served for wages, following the sheep, at his return
ready to be devoured by Esau? what great cause then have you to brag of your
Progeny?

2. To stir us up to thankfulness, Reason 2.
when we see we were most wretched, and miserable, poor, and blind, and naked,
having no dram of any good in our selves; this is a great cause of
thankfulness: whereas if we think we have ever been as now, or that we had some
goodness in us before, as the Papists teach, we cannot be truly and heartily
thankful to God as we should: Therefore the Doctrine of Rome, That man is not
so miserable, See Romans 6. 17.
but that he has some good in himself, 1 Cor. 6. 10.
etc. Tit. 3. 3.
will never humble a man as he ought to be, nor make him so thankful as he
should be: David was put in mind that he was taken from following the Ewes
with young, that thereby he might be the more thankful.

3. To strengthen our faith to believe in God for afterward, Reason 3.
and for all blessings needful to Salvation: Phil. 1. 6.
He that has already done thus much for me, 1 Thessalonians. 5.
will not now fail me.

1. Therefore we should do well oftentimes, Use 1.
especially when we feel our hearts lifted up with pride, to enter into a deep
consideration of our former estate, and what we were before God showed mercy to
our souls in enlightening, converting, and effectually calling us; for we are
ready to be puffed up, as though we had not received it, and lift up our
selves, and contemn others; now alas we should consider, such were we, and once
as far from Salvation as they, and so pity them.

2. When we find our selves dead or dull to duties, Use 2.
do but consider what he has done for us, and from what a base condition he
has pulled us, and into what dignity he has advanced us, and this will make
us shake off all laziness.

3. When our faith is weak, Use 3.
and we begin to fear the time to come, consider, He that freely before the
world chose us (passing by most others) gave his Son to dye for us, his Word to
tell us thereof, his Spirit to assure us thereof, and so Sanctify us, he will
not now leave his work imperfect.

O but our sins be so many, Object.
and we be so unworthy!

If thy sins could have turned away Gods favor, Solut.
he would have kept his mercy away at the first; but seeing they could not keep
God from showing thee mercy at the first, they shall never take away the favor
of God from thee, now that he has vouchsafed the same, they shall never take
it away wholly and for ever.

Here the Apostle alludes (as ye heard) to Hosea 1. 10. Observe.
God there threatened to cut them off from being his people, No privileges can
exempt the contemners of the Word from Gods wrath.
which after fell out. Whence learn, that

No privileges can exempt men from Gods wrath, but if they contemn his Word,
he will take it from them, and cast them off: Thus he did with the posterity of
Abraham; a very lamentable spectacle to see the ten Tribes carried into Assyria
Captives, thence by the Medes chased into many Nations, and dispersed, that had
sometimes been the people of God, and now nothing less, but became no people,
were as the Heathens; thus has it fallen out to many Nations since our Savior
Christ, as to the Churches that the Apostles Paul and John wrote to, and diverse
others.

This may terrify us, Use.
and hereby we may learn to stand in awe: If God did not spare them, Romans 11.
21.
will he spare us? we stand upon our good behavior; the sins of our Land be
many, not only Bribery, Oppression, Whoredom, Drunkenness, Pride,
Covetousness, but horrible prophanations of Sabbaths and Sacraments, fearful
contempt of the Word, and abuse of Gods Servants, and with most, Religion grown
to a mock, and a reproach to those that be any thing forwarder therein then
others.

If any shall say, Obj.
We have enjoyed the mercy of God, and the Gospel, a long time.

Not so long as the Israelites did. Sol.


But what then should God do for a people? Object.


As when God cast off the Jews, Sol.
he took us Gentiles in, which they thought could never have been, even so can
he find him out a people among the ignorant and wild people, which are no
worse then this Nation sometimes was, though he should utterly cast us off.

In making them a people again, see both the mercy, power, and truth of God.

1. His mercy in receiving them in again: Gods mercy in making the Jews a
people again.
Where learn, That Though God should forsake some of the seed of a godly man,
yet he will extend mercies on others for their fathers sakes, and remember the
next or third Generation for the good old father, or Grandfather.

Let Parents be godly, Use 1.
that all their children may be so; or if the Lord should frown on any of them,
that yet he may remember his Covenant to their Posterity.

Again, Use 2.
though God be angry with men for their sins, yet if they unfeignedly turn to
him and humble themselves, he is gracious and merciful.

As this should provoke Gods Servants when they have offended, Use 3.
not to fly from him and despair, but come humbly to him, remembering that
though they have shaken off the nature and part of Children, yet he retains
still the nature of a father; so this may provoke lewd Wretches to come unto
God, Apply 1 King. 20. 21.
hearing he is so merciful. But contrarily, they abuse the same, and go on in
their sins.

2. His power: His power.
Though they were thus scattered, and so unlikely ever to be gathered again,
yet did the Lord effect it. If men say a thing, or have a mind to a thing,
they may hap to do it, but if God mind a thing, he will do it, neither shall
any, or any thing let him.

This may comfort us in all Gods promises of protection of his Church, Use.
against the proud adversaries of the same: See Psalm. 74. 12. -- 18.
And let such take heed how they oppose God in his Church, or stand in his way,
lest they receive that which they shall never claw off again. Though the Jews
at this time be so scattered, as that they be in all Nations, yet God will
find a means to gather them under the knowledge and scepter of Jesus Christ.

3. His truth: His truth.
That was verified and came upon them, which God had threatened in the time, and
by the ministry of Hosea; and whereas there it was foretold, that yet
afterward they should be called home again, and be made the people of God: See
the truth of his promises as of his threatenings; Use.
for his promise to Abraham he took them in again.

Were not a people] He says not, Observe.
they were not the people of God, but, Impenitent persons not worthy the name
of people.
they were not a people; What then? heads of Swine, not worthy the name of a
people or of men, but of Beasts; for such are they which live without the
knowledge of God and Christ; nay, evil Beasts, as Horse and Mule without
understanding, Oxen and Asses may teach them wit: Tit. 1. 12.
The Sork, Crane and Swallow know their times, Psalm. 32* 9.
which they do not, nay worse then Beasts: Hence the Scripture compares them to
Dogs, Isa. 1. 3.
Lions, Ier. 8. 7. and 50. 27.
Foxes, Tygres, Cockatrices, etc. as wicked rich men to fed beasts. If a Horse
have drunk his fill, let him come through the clearest water that is, Amos 4. 1.
and he stays not; but numbers having already drunk too much, must needs drink
at every Alehouse they come at. Its grace that puts excellency in a man,
without which he is worse then a Beast, for he is degenerate from his Creation,
has understanding, but serves not his Creator, but rebelleth against him, and
his end will be a thousand times worse then a Beast: A wicked man is called in
Latin, Nequam, which signifies no body, and so he is indeed in Gods account,
No body; and happy were it with him, if he were indeed no body, but he has a
being here to sin, and hereafter to be tormented.

Do not we therefore rest contented with our natural state, Use
but labor for grace in our hearts.

But are now the people of God] Though scattered, Observe.
yet became they the people of God: No outward affliction does nullify Gods
Church.
So that no outward affliction does nullify Gods Church, as no outward pomp
nor living together in wealth make a Church; Gods Church scattered, is yet one
Household, one Sheepfold. Further, in that he reckons it for a great privilege
and blessing, that they were the people of God, Note, That

Its the greatest blessing in the world for a Nation to be the people of God,
Obser.
even to enjoy the Word and Sacraments, To be the people of God a choice
blessing.
and other Ordinances of God, the means of Salvation: so for a particular
person to be one of Gods true people; Psalm. 147. 20.
for as for all outward things, they are common to the wicked, yea the Beasts
partake of many of them, but the means of Salvation they are happy things: Its
the fearfullest thing in the world not to be the people of God; for if we be in
Poverty, Trouble, Captivity, under Tyrants, yet its nothing, so we enjoy the
means of Salvation; and if a Nation have all Plenty and Peace, yet want the
knowledge of God and Christ Jesus, its nothing: So for a particular person, if
he be never so Poor, Sick, Imprisoned, Hated, yet if the knowledge of God in
Christ Jesus be in his heart, and true holiness, he is not misrable; and if all
Wealth, Honor, Health, whatsoever can be put upon a man, if he be not the
child of God, its nothing. St. James bids the poor Christian rejoice, because
he is made a Christian, exalted; and the rich man to rejoice, because he is by
the grace of God made lowly, not because rich.

1. This may stir up in us thankfulness to God, Use 1.
that has vouchsafed to make us his people in this Land, for which we cannot
be sufficiently thankful: But most regard not that which makes the Land happy,
namely the Gospel; This is that which makes this Land the people of God, and
nothing else.

2. It teaches us particularly to labor to be of his true people effectually
Called, Use 2.
Justified, Sanctified, Zealous of good Works, loving the Word, affecting it,
and finding it sweeter then the honey, and the honey comb, more precious then
gold and silver, delighting in the Sacraments and Prayer, walking in true
Holiness, etc. thus shall we be happier then Kings without it. He that is one
of Gods true people is dear to God, he will protect him and provide for him,
that he shall want no good thing here, and be glorified with him hereafter;
every one will be challenging this to himself, the worst of all will take the
best names to themselves, and be termed Christians, but let them win it and
wear it.

Which had not obtained mercy] What then? were under Gods Wrath and Justice;
and why not under Mercy? because of their sins. So that Sins, Observe.
especially unrepented of, are a wall of brass to keep Gods mercy from us. Sin
unrepented of lets Gods mercy.
Therefore repent of them, for without Gods mercy we are utterly undone for
ever.

But now have obtained mercy. Use.
] This is the same for substance with the former words, and there remain no
several Doctrines our of these, besides those there handled, excepting this;
Namely, that

What God did for them in making them his people, Observe.
was of his mere mercy: What God did for the Jews was of mercy; and so all that
we have.
He had no need of them, they deserved no such matter. Learn then, that

All that we have or have had, is of mere grace; That we Gentiles are called to
be the people of God, John 3. 16.
That this Land has the Gospel, That our selves particularly were Elected, 2 Timothy 1. 9.
was of mere mercy; So were we redeemed, Ephesians. 2. 4.
so effectually called: Nothing in us to move him to show any mercy, Tit. 3. 3.
first or last, 1 Pet. 1. 3.
nay, all to move him to the contrary, nay, it was not only mercy, but
abundant and wonderful mercy.

1. This confuteth Popish arrogance, Use 1.
that teach man's Merits to be in part the cause hereof.

2. It teaches us to walk so much the more thankfully and obediently in all
things; Use 2.
as we especially take kindly the good turns of a Stranger: O say we, I am
exceedingly beholding to him, thus and thus he did, I never saw him before, I
shall never forget it! What thankfulness then owe we to God for his love
toward us, who were altogether ignorant of him? The less desert Mephi^^^heth
found in himself, 2 Samuel 19. 28.
the more he found himself bound to David, so may we to God.

3. We must learn to imitate the Lord, Use 3.
to be merciful as he is, and to do good to those that never deserved ought of
us, Matt. 5. 44.
nay, to do good to those that have deserved ill of us, and this men can hardly
be brought to: O say some, and those not of the worst, I could be content to
yield and to do any thing, but he has thus and thus abused me with his tongue!
But have not we done so by the Lord?

Verse 11. Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, to abstain
from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul.
HAving laid Doctrine for his ground, he follows now with Exhortation; both
these go necessarily together to the doing of good, and may not be sundred: The
Doctrine was about the great things that God had done for them, and therefore
hereupon he Exhorts them to holiness, and purity of heart and life; before he
showed what God had done for them, now he shows their work; before he showed
that the end of those privileges, was, that they should show forth Gods
virtues, now he shows how that should be done, namely, in laboring to be pure
in heart and life in token of thankfulness, and so that being advanced to such
dignities, they were not to be idle, but work for God, and walk according to
the benefits bestowed: In this verse he exhorts to purity of heart, in the next
to holiness in conversation, and these he joins together. Holiness in heart and
conversation must accompany one another.
Holiness in general, is and must be the life of Gods people: These two parts
of it, in heart and conversation, must go together, one as the Mother, the
other the Offspring, that as the Root, this as the Branches; like two Twins
that are born and dye, weep and laugh together. In vain does any man boast of
purity of heart, whiles his conversation is naught; In vain does any man strive
to have a good conversation, whiles his heart is suffered to boil with corrupt
lusts: First, he begins with cleansing the heart, as from whence must come good
conversation, the only true discerner of the purity of the heart.

The parts of this Verse are two: 1. An Exhortation, where we have both the
manner wherein its delivered, namely, by way of beseeching, and the matter
exhorted to, namely, To abstain from filthy lusts; whereby we are to
understand, not such sins as be acted by the body, but the lusts of the heart,
for even body and soul is flesh naturally, that is, sinful and corrupt. Fleshly
lusts, that is, sinful and carnal corrupt lusts; such as have place in the
heart, ere they break out, from those we are to abstain, even to take heed they
prevail not in us, but resist and mortify the same. 2. The Reasons thereof, 1.
Because they fight against the Soul. 2. They were and we are Pilgrims here; not
of this world, therefore not to follow the lusts of this world, but to mind
Heaven and be Spiritual.

Dearly beloved] We must know he dissembled not, but spoke as he thought, and
meant, and felt. Hence note,

What affection of love Ministers ought to bear to the people they have taken
charge of: Observe.
If people have chosen one, Ministers must love and affect their people.
and entrusted him with their souls, he is then to be between God and them: O
what a near conjuction, and what great love must there be! The Apostle writes
to the Corinthians, 1 Cor. 4. 15.
That he was their Father; and to the Galathians, Gal. 4. 19.
That he traveled in birth till Christ was formed in them; 1 Thessalonians. 2. 7, 8.
and to the Thessalonians, That he was affectioned toward them, as a nurse
cherishes her children: He loved them at the heart root, and was content not
only to take any pains for them, but to lose his life for their good, John 10.
11.
as a good Shepherd.

Love also being so necessary a duty in the people, as without which nothing
can go aright as it should, and that most are full of self-love, but very cold
in love to their neighbor; Ministers must be very much and often in persuading
hereto, and the several parts thereof, consisting in giving, forgiving,
patience and forbearance, and doing all good both to their souls and bodies,
and that both by word and deed, and that not only by precept, but also pattern.

But chiefly this is the Reason he should be so full of love to the people,
Reason.
that they may be moved the more by his Ministry, and it may prevail the more
effectually with them; when they see that whether it be admonition or rebuke,
yet it comes from one that entirely loves them in the Lord, and is hungry of
their souls, and desires above all to win and gain them to God, which would be
above all riches to them; if not, our nature is sickly and full of self-love.
If we think our selves not to be loved, we make little use of whatsoever we are
taught, though this be indeed a fault in us, for the matter it self ought to
move us: But as if the sick person knew the Physician to be one, that besides
his skill, bears him good will, it will make him willing to take physic of
him; whereas if he thinks he bears him no good will, he cannot be brought to
meddle with him, or take any thing of him; so its with them that are well or
ill persuaded of their Pastors love toward them: Therefore the Minister ought
to provide for this; for what is the joy of a Minister, but to see the fruit of
his labors, and that he does good, and gains men home to God, sees knowledge
and conscience wrought, and people converted? Oh, what man sows, and looks not
to see it come up, grow, and have a crop? who plants a vineyard, and looks not
for the fruit thereof? and shall we only lose the most precious labor, and
seed, and study, and preach as we care not whether it do good or no, and never
look after it? God forbid.

1. This teaches Ministers their duty to love the people tenderly; Use 1.
them, 2 Cor. 12. 14.
not theirs: By reason of the contrary, there is so little good done; some live
altogether from them, others live with them, but so, that it were better they
were further off.

2. It teaches people to profit by that which they hear, Use 2.
though not delivered happily with such hearty affection as it ought (for its
Gods Word however) but especially look, that being delivered in love, and
unfeigned care of your good, you take heed that you despise not the same, lest
one day it rise up in judgment against you.

He had before described them as Believers and excellent ones, now here he
calls them Beloved, yea, Dearly beloved. Hence note, That

The Saints, Observe.
or they that be endued with Grace and the Image of God, The Saints are to be

are to be the objects of our love: This is worthy love, commands love
wheresoever it be seen.

True, we must love all, because we know not who may be the Lords (happily even
such as are yet bad) and love that part or parts of the Image of God we see in
any; but where we see the true Image of Grace and Sanctification in any, they
be the parties which are chiefly to be beloved: we are to do good to all, but
especially to the household of Faith; we must love all, but brotherly kindeness
is to the godly as our Brethren, yea fellow members; yea, among Christians we
must love them most, where we see most Grace, and be most familiar with them,
affect them most, and most regard them.

that they may get the highest and largest room in their Ministers heart which
be faithful, which howsoever the world makes little account of, yet they that
are wise know, that their sentence and love is to be regarded, as the Testimony
of the Church is a great matter, either for a man, or against a man; so of a
Faithful Minister: and if such a one give a full and large Testimony of a man,
its a Crown to his head above all his wealth; if his Testimony be against a
man, or a weak doubtful Testimony, its an hard case: If a Minister have joy of
a people, and may give a cheerful account of them to God, its profitable for
the people; Heb. 13. 17.
The contrary is grievous.

I beseech you,] He had power to command them, being from God, in a thing for
their own good, and so necessary, but he saw their toward disposition,
therefore chose rather to use entreaty. Whence note, That

Its the duty of Gods Ministers to be wise in their delivery of the Word,
Wisdom requisite in the Preachers of the Word.
and when they see that loving beseechings and entreaties will be as
profitable, and prevail as much, then so to do, rather then use any other
course. True it is, the Minister has power to command the people being in the
person of God, and for their own good to fly from things hurtful, and follow
things profitable for themselves: Paul might have commanded Philemon, Philem.
7, 8.
but being persuaded of his forwardness, See 1 Timothy 5. 21.
he rather entreated; so must we, as they that set in a joint in a tender body,
2 Timothy 4. 1, 2.
stroke, Acts 13. 10.
and stroke softly, and anoint the place, and so put it in the place ere the
party be aware; Mat. 3. 7. and 23. 13. 2.
yet upon occasion we may both command, and threaten, as the same Apostle
elsewhere: and John the Baptist, and our Savior himself; as when we have to
deal with stubborn and disobedient persons, or such as have fallen into foul
sins, or are secure and dead-hearted, or are revolters and backsliders, then, I
say, are we to deal more roundly and severely; knotty logs must have many and
hard strokes, as a rough horse an hard rider; when we have to deal with toward
and well disposed tender hearted ones, or afflicted, then are we to deal
otherwise: and here is required the wisdom of the Spirit of God to discern what
is mere, and this must be considered of before hand.

Abstain from fleshly lusts, What meant by fleshly lusts
] Now of the matter of the Exhortation. By fleshly lusts are meant not only
acts of sin breaking out in the body, but the inward lusts that are in the
heart, though they should never break out, for even the heart and soul is flesh
as well as the body, and fleshly, even corrupt and sinful, as the sinful lusts
of unbelief, impatience, hardness of heart, hypocrisy, rebelling against that
which is good, weariness in well doing, pride, anger, envy, self-love,
covetousness, uncleanness, uncharitableness, and the like: These we must
abstain from, even labor against, that they prevail not in us, yea to subdue
them quite. Now in that he gives his Exhortation to such as they were, whom he
before described, We may learn, That

There are remnants of sin abiding in the best of Gods Servants, Doctr.
and will be while they be here; There are remnants of sin in the very best.
They shall not lay down sin wholly, till they lay down this flesh: They are
sanctified, but in part; through out, 1 Cor. 13. 9.
but not perfectly; corruption is not in one part, and grace in another, but
grace and corruption joined in every part and faculty of body and soul, and
thus it has ever been. Hence it is, that we scarce read of any in Scripture,
but taxed for some infirmity and weakness, as Abraham with some little shifting
for himself, when he said Sarah was his sister; Sarah for her unbelief, Moses
for speaking unadvisedly, Job for cursing his day, Paul and Barnabas for being
stirred the one against the other: And this the wise and good providence of God
has so appointed, for he could sanctify us perfectly at the first, but its
not meet, for then righteousness should not come only by Christ; for if we
were not only perfectly justified by Christ, as we are, but also perfectly
sanctified by his grace, then might we stand before God with confidence, and
boldness in our own righteousness, and need not to have the righteousness of
Christ continually imputed to us. Besides, the Lord would hereby humble us,
that we should not be proud of any gifts or graces that he bestows on us,
more then we had or others have, but be kept still humble: when we see these
corrupt lusts sticking in our nature, which may more justly provoke wrath
against us, then our good actions procure favor; as Paul, lest he should be
lifted up through the abundance of revelations, had a prick in the flesh, 2
Cor. 7. 12.
even Satan working upon his corruption, and strongly tempting, and as it were
boxing him to humble him: Therefore no man has cause to be proud of any grace,
not only because he has nothing but the mere mercy of God, but also because
(if he consider) he has such remainders of sin still in him, as if they be
laid in the Balance with his graces, might be of more force to condemn him,
then all his graces to procure favor to him. Further, hereby we are held
continually in exercise, and made see our need of the Word, Sacraments, Prayer,
and the help we have one of another while we live.

1. We are not to expect the perfection of any here; Use 1.
though Gods Ministers are still to call on the people to grow toward it, yet
they must rejoice even in their proceedings to it, and bear with some weakness
and wants; and people must not think their Ministers can be perfect without
blemish, either knowing or suspecting some infirmity in them, to esteem meanly
of them, or their Ministry, or gifts, so drowning all their graces, God
forbid: Its well, 1. We know no sin our Minister lives in: 2. No corruption he
yields to, but that he is in strife with his corruption, and counts it his
burden; this we should cover with the lap of our love: The contrary is in the
world; If a Minister have any imperfection, though strived against by him, and
seldom or never showing it self, and have never so many good graces, yet the
same shall still be cast in his face, and tossed from one to another, and all his
gifts neglected, and that oftentimes of those that live in soul sins, or are an
hundred times more foully overtaken of the same, or some other: Husbands, look
not for perfection in your Wives, nor Wives in your Husbands; thank God they be
godly, hating all foul sins, and striving against corruptions, look for these,
and cover them, else lovingly help to cure them in time convenient, but look on
their graces: some man that is himself carnal, and has a professing wife, so
narrowly views her, as if he spy the least imperfection, its cast in her teeth,
as if she should be perfect, though he be never so far off from perfection: Let
none look for Christians that profess the Gospel, that they can be altogether
without blame; yet let none take up this as a good excuse and shelter for them;
yea, say they, Its true as the Preacher said to day (which I liked well) that
we are all sinners; some make themselves so holy, and profess such zeal, as if
they were without sin, or wiser then all their neighbors, when they be no less
sinners then others: Well, let not these carnal or profane and civil persons,
think to escape away with this, or be hid in the number of sinners, Two sorts of
sinners.
and escape as well as others; God will find two sorts of sinners, such as live
and lie in sin, indeed workers of iniquity, and such as having been unfeignedly
humbled, and obtained pardon of sin, and truly repented, have yet corruptions
which they hate and strive against, and are heartily sorry when they have been
at any time overtaken thereby; and yet the world bless themselves herein, What,
are not all sinners I pray? yea, and you shall have them that will dilate of
any infirmity that a Christian has, and stretch it on the tenters, when
themselves are polluted with foul sins.

2. We are to labor altogether against these corruptions of ours; Use 2.
against our pride, self-love, unbelief, hypocrisy, earthliness, weariness of
well-doing, Romans 8. 13.
and the like: All that are Christ's, have crucisled the, er; flesh with the
affections and lusts; Gal. 5. 24.
We must mortify our earthly members, and by the Spirit mortify the deeds of
the flesh; Col. 3. 5, 9.
These things become not us that are set at liberty from sin, Romans 6. 2.
and be eudued with the Spirit; Gal. 5. 25.
If we live in the Spirit, let us walk in the Spirit: For us that are
Christians to be led and overcome of our lusts, is base, as for a Prince to be
led of a base person; and here is the power of Religion, and proof of a
Christian, that denies himself and crucifieth his lusts, that not only
keeps his hand, but purifieth his heart, that has it at command in some
measure: We must labor to know these corruptions, and our own hearts, and which
of these we are most prone unto, and discern of them, which many do not, but
are most strangers at home, and have many corruptions which they discern not,
for the heart is deceitful: Know both the ugliness and danger of them, then
repent of them, be humbled for them, crave pardon heartily, unfeignedly, seek
to mortify them, apply the edge of the word against them, even any thing we
read or hear out of the Scriptures to this purpose: Apply also the benefits of
God, as means to subdue them, so also afflictiont; put on the whole Armor of
God, and on every occasion set against them, pray against them also, especially
when we humble our selves upon occasion of the Sacrament, etc. always be
baiting at them, hacking at the roots of them, grieving we can prevail no
further, crying and making our moan to God to help us; so shall we get mastery
more and more (dealing faithfully) even over those that we thought sometimes we
should never have prevailed against: In the mean time lets not be dismayed that
we can get no more mastery, be humbled and yet comforted that we strive: But
here is the great fault of many Christians, that suffer their corruptions to
bear such sway in them, as they break out shamefully, and often to Gods
dishonor, their own shame, and the Gospels infamy; where is our Christianity,
when we be so proud, that we will contend, and being out, will never be
reconciled, but break out into bitter speeches? so being so covetous, so lazy
also in goodness, that either we neglect duty wholly, or slight it over
carelessly.

Fleshly lusts,] Hereby are yet further meant all evil thoughts, and the least
rebellings of this nature of ours, against the holy commandments of God: These
are fruits of this concupiscence and evil nature of ours, Evil thoughts cast in
by Satan or from our selves.
and of the flesh, and are sins against God. But here know that evil thoughts
be of two kinds, 1. Such as be cast in by Satan, as into Judas. 2. Such as
arise from our own corrupt nature, as Christ said to his Disciples, Why do
thoughts arise in your hearts? For the former, they either fasten upon our
nature, and tarry to tickle us with a kind of pleasure, or else are
immediately cast out with deep detestation: If they tarry never so little to
parley with our corrupt nature, they are our sins, as well as Satan's; but if
cast out immediately, they are not, then are they our crosses, not our sins, but
the Devils, and shall also be laid to his charge, not ours; for so he cast in
thoughts into our Savior Christ's mind of distrust, presumption, idolatry, etc.
but they fastened not at all on his nature, therefore he was never the worse;
so for us: for if any shall come and entice me to Murder or Treason, and I
detest the very first motion thereof, Shall I be counted guilty? This is
needful to be known, lest we be too much overwhelmed with grief, for these the
Devil troubles every one withal at all times, and no man alive is free from
many of them daily, if he did take notice thereof; but some men are troubled
extraordinarily this way: God lets Satan loose at some time, and for some space
to buffet them most grievously, and cast in bad thoughts of all kinds, but
especially against God, most foul, unholy, profane, and blasphemous thoughts
not to be named; as that God is not holy, just, good, or deals hardly with some
men, cannot do this or that, with other more vile then is meet to be named,
which is sometimes the state of civil persons, sometimes of the true children
of God, which are cast into their minds as thick as hailstones, and are by
some called the foul Temptation, by some the Temptation of Blasphemies: This
does so wonderfully perplex the parties, that it fills them not only with
fears, but even drives them almost to despair, makes them weary of their lives,
that they could wish themselves as far under ground as they are above; yea,
many to think of making away themselves, haunting them in all places, night and
day, that they cannot rest, so weakening their body and mind exceedingly;
concerning this state, we must know it comes to pass by Gods providence, and
permission to Satan thus to torment them.

The cause may be either to humble them to repentance for some coldness or
slackness they are fallen into in the worship of God, The causes of evil
thoughts from Satan.
and their course which God thus punishes, or else he punishes the barrenness
of their hearts, and idleness of their minds, that care not how they spend
away their time, How to be rid of them.
their minds roaving unprofitably, which God often chasteneth: the way for
these to take, is 1. To examine themselves if there be any sin lies unrepented
of, or not thoroughly repented of, to confess and crave pardon of it, and repent
of it from the heart: If any coldness or slackness, or declining in care, or
idleness of mind, and unprofitableness, then are we to pray against them, and
keep our hearts still in hatred and detestation of them, and therein comfort
our selves, that the Lord knows our hearts, and will not lay them to our
charge. 2. Set light by them, let them go as they come, for the more we strive
with them, the more we snarl and trouble our selves, and if we make a great
matter of them, the Devil will still delight to vex us, but if we set light by
them, he will the sooner be weary. 3. Let them avoid solitariness (which yet
they so much desire) and keep in company rather, wherein the time may be spent
in holy conference, singing of Psalms, and the like; but if they be alone, they
must be very earnest in doing something that's good. 4. Though some may come
after all those means used, yet we are to comfort our selves that God will not
lay them to our charge; as if our Child should be about our business, and some
unhappy Wretches would not let him alone, but throw stones at him, pluck him
away, trip up his heels, and he cry and complain to us he cannot do our work,
will we be angry with him? How to discern them from those which arise from own
nature.
The Lord is much more equal and wise. Now to discern these foul temptations
from those which do arise from our own nature, these notes may be observed, 1.
That they come suddenly. 2. Violently, being even forced into us. 3. By their
multitude, being as thick as hailstones. 4. That they come with such fears, as
often cost sickness, faintness, and the like, which things usually be not of
them that come of our selves, which also come more leisurely, and with more
moderation. 5. Such as be in such a degree of blasphemy against God, See
Perkins Cases of Consc. page 163.
usually rise not of our selves, and seldom but in a Reprobate, or one that
has sinned against the Holy Ghost, as the Devil has. 6. Such as are against
nature, as to kill our selves, our wives or children: For the latter that arise
from our nature they be sins, whether they tarry so long, as that they have got
consent of will or not, or so much, as they have but inveigled the mind with
some bait-like allurement, yea, but so as that either they do presently vanish
so soon as they do arise, or be cast out by us, yet these I say be sins; if
with consent against other Commandments, if without consent against the Tenth,
which ransacketh the heart more narrowly then any of the other: Its true, the
longer they stay, and the further they have prevailed, its the worse; but the
least and first thought against the Law of God is a sin, and deserves the wrath
of God; as all Impatient, Blasphemous, Unbelieving thoughts, all wandering
thoughts when we be at the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, or any good duty, or any
such on the Lords day: all ill thoughts, as that its in vain to serve God, etc.
so also Disobedient, Angry, Revengeful, Unclean, Uncharitable thoughts; God
made us pure without any, and may justly punish the contrary in us: These first
of all come from Original sin, and who can bring good out of evil? These bring
forth bad effects, and withdraw the heart from God, to consent to and commit
evil: These are forbidden in the tenth Commandment; else what? This the heathen
Philosophers never knew, nor Paul himself a learned Pharisee, till he was
instructed in a more Spiritual understanding of the Law.

1. This confutes Papists, Use 1.
which teach, That ill thoughts with consent, be the least sins, and that
without consent, they are none: What is that then which Paul said, Rom 7. 7.
I had not known that lust had heen sin, but by the Law; he knew that ill
thoughts with consent were sins: This Doctrine of Rome does derogate from Gods
glory, and does not humble a man to the purpose as it ought, neither lets it
him see a multitude of such sins for which there is cause he should be humbled.

2. This sets out the absolute perfection and purity of the Lord, Use 2.
who requires the purity of the heart and thoughts, he made us perfect, and
requires that we should love him with our whole hearts.

3. It serves notably to humble us on our knees every day to God, Use 3.
for who knows how often he offends this way? O the innumerable vain, foolish,
idle, and bad thoughts that arise in our minds in a day? how in a Sermon or
Prayer-while, and on the Sabbath? O if God should deal with us in justice, he
might condemn us for the least of these; we should repent us seriously of
these, as of ill deeds: This is that made Paul cry out, O wretched man that I
am; and that makes the dear servants of God hang down their heads, and humbles
them continually; and when others think highly of them for their graces, they
have matter to abase their vile nature and rebellious thoughts, whereof some
tickle the mind, some get consent, and are then cast out as, some presently
are repelled: But how infinite numbers of them come through our heads as motes
in the Sun, as sparkles from a Furnace? The want of the knowledge of these,
makes many a Christian when they look back at night, see little to repent of,
which if they marked, they might find: This is the Reason why civil persons be
not humbled, even because they take no knowledge of these thoughts, whereof
they have thousands on the Lords day, in the times of Duties, and against every
Commandment, whereof they take no knowledge, or scarce of one of twenty; and
those whereof they take knowledge, they think to be no sins, as long as they
break not out into words and actions. Thought is free, as the world thinks, and
judged at no Bar, pay no Tribute: True, not in men's Courts, because they cannot
know them, but before God they are and will be called in question, who knows
the thoughts, and requires to be loved with the whole heart.

4. This sets out the wonderful patience and abundant mercy of God, Use 4.
that upon our repentance pardons so many thoughts.

5. Its our duty to prevent them to the uttermost of our power; Use 5.
and to this purpose we must labor, How to prevent evil thoughts.
1. For the Spirit of God to be more and more abundant in us, to mortify this
corrupt nature of ours, that so this root being more and more killed, may send
forth fewer shoots; this brand more and more quenched, may send forth the fewer
sparkles. 2. To be ever doing some good, to be in our Calling or some thing
answerable thereto; for if we be idle, the mind will be ranging: An idle
person must needs have a corrupt heart, swarming with ill thoughts, for if the
mind be not occupied about good, it will be about evil; its like Quicksilver,
ever stirring: if we be riding, working alone, walking, waking in our beds, let
our minds be on some good: And in duties we must keep our minds earnestly
bent thereto, that being full already, there may be no place of by-thoughts; as
when a vessel is full, no more can be poured in: Let Us covenant with our eyes
and ears, that they let in no ill thoughts, especially in holy duties, and on
the Lord's Day, shut up all windows and doors; so in praying, whether conceived,
or read by our selves, or heard of another, our hearts must be set thereon,
that to every Petition they may say, Amen. So in hearing the Word, we must be
earnestly bent, and fix our eyes on the Preacher; and for the Lord's Day, be
wholly in doing good, and that earnestly: In the time of the Sacraments both
join with the Prayers then used, and withal, have holy thoughts by way of
preparation, and in the mean time have holy meditations about the matter
present, as long as we can, then join in singing; it must needs be a weary toil
to them that cannot. 3. To pray earnestly to God for his assistance, but labor
what we can, all will not be prevented; therefore must we grieve for those that
come, casting them out, and that speedily: They are as a flock of birds, that
we cannot let from hovering over our heads, but may hinder from lighting on our
heads; if we nip them betimes, then we prevent evil actions: The worst action
was at first a thought, which if it had then been resisted and cast out, would
not have proved so deadly, as we now find by woeful experience; for want of
this, sin grows from one degree to another, till it be ripe: If we thus resist
and cast them out, though they be our sins, God will not impute them, but
pardon them in Christ, and this may comfort us; but yet because it were best
not to be troubled with them, or commit them at all, we should even long to be
with God, when having laid down our bodies, we shall be wholly freed from them:
But in the mean time, let us thank God in Christ Jesus, and say, Its not I, but
sin that dwells in me; when we do to the uttermost of our power prevent them,
and those we cannot, yet we resist earnestly: The world make little account of
thoughts, but let them fly out, and the heart range whither it will, whether
on the Lords day, or at other times when duties are performed; and no marvel,
for they make no conscience either of their words or actions, even on the
Lord's Day: But they shall one day be called before a Judge that knows them all,
and made them without them, who will condemn them for them.

Which fight against the soul: The first Reason, and that of greatest force;
that which fights against our principal part, we had need resist manfully,
but thus do fleshly lusts: for 1. They hinder the good thoughts we should have
in stead of them, How fleshly lusts fight against the soul.
and so make us do duties untowardly. 2. They egg and entice us to evil, and
steal away our hearts from God and his obedience; as an Adulterer enticeth Iam.
1. 14.
That they rebelled against the law of his mind, and led him captive, Romans 7.
19.
he was yoked, and made to do the evil he would not, and so on Romans 6. 23.
for the wages of the least of these is death: These not resisted, or not
repented of, will surely cause damnation, and these in themselves deserve no
less.

1. How ought we then to watch against these with all diligence, Use 1.
as they keep watch that be besieged by Enemies?

2. Take away from them all means of nourishment, Use 2.
and starve them, as besiegers do by their besieged adversaries.

3. Mortify them all we can, Use 1.
else they will destroy us: If we live after the flesh, Romans 8. 13.
we shall dye; It will not spare us, we therefore must not spare it, we must
admit of no reconciliation, no ransom; this is holy and lawful revenge: But
contrarily, there are not a few Christians 1. Which do not watch against their
lusts and thoughts, but let them come and go at their pleasure, and take little
or no notice of them, or not as though they sought their destruction; nay, how
few once regard their thoughts, especially such as have no consent? How many
come and go, and no account taken of them? 2. Which rather minister mat^er to
their lusts for their nourishment, as to their pride, to anger, to wandering
thoughts, by letting their eyes and ears be at liberty? 3. Which do not
mortify them, nay, bear with them, and speak favorably of them, and not as if
they were deadly Enemies? Oh, people little think of the danger of these lusts,
else they would otherwise do! If any lie in wait to hurt us in our bodies, we
watch to resist them, and its wisdom; or if any come to rob us, we cry out, Oh,
he seeks to rob me and get away my goods; or if one should sue us for part of
our Land, What a stir and opposition do we make? What a madness is it then,
that these which fight against our souls, we suffer to go in and out at their
pleasure without any check, entertaining them rather as friends then enemies?
If one should strike at our leg, we would fence it if we could, but if he drive
at our head, then much more; If one would thrust us into the arm, we would
avoid all we can, but if he go about to stab us at the heart, then much more;
so should we most of all for our souls: These lusts pretend friendship, but
they are Enemies, fighting Enemies, an Host (as the word imports) against our
souls: O let us be wiser, and deal with them as deadly Enemies! O our fault
herein! If some come and tell us, this night some be pointed to rob us, or
there is one lies in our field armed, threatening to kill us as we come that
way: O I thank you good Neighbor, say we, that you would tell me, I shall love
you while I live; but if any come and tell us of a Lust, Pride, Covetousness,
Hastiness that is in us, he had need behave himself wisely in the doing of it,
that shall have any thanks for his labor, nay, not one of many but will take it
ill, and snuff, and think the worse of him: O what folly is this to bear with
such deadly foes!

4. If these inward lusts fight against the soul, Use 4.
if these ill thoughts, yea the least of them be enemies to the soul, and must
be resisted, What then do the ugly sins and abominable speeches and actions of
the wicked? These wound and pierce the soul most deeply; their Oaths, Cursing,
Drunkenness, Profanation of the Sabbath, Whoredom, Oppression, Lying, gash the
soul most fearfully, and kill it at last eternally: What mad people then be
most of the World, which love and live in the practice of these, thus
murdering their own souls? As the man that was possessed of a Devil broke all
fetters, Mark 5. 4, 5.
so do these; kept among the graves, so do these in Alehouses; cut himself with
sharp stones, so do these with ugly sins: If a man seek to make away himself,
stab himself, or cut his own throat, we say, He is beside himself, its time to
bind him; when the World therefore gash themselves, and stab themselves with
their vile sins, are they not mad, yea so much more then the others, as the
soul is better then the body?

As strangers and pilgrims,] The second Reason. Hereby are meant such as are
out of their own house, out of their own Nation* which he speaks not because
they were out of Canaan, and dispersed in other countries (in that sense he
called them Strangers in the former Chapter) not in a worldly, but in a
Spiritualsence, namely, in respect of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was their
Country, and from which, wandering here in this world, they were absent. Hence
Note, that

All Gods Servants and Believers are Pilgrims here in this world; Doctr.
This is not their Country, Believers are here strangers and pilgrims.
They have a far more excellent one that they are going to: Thus the Patriarchs
counted themselves, and thus David; Genesis 47. 9.
They are not of this World, Here they have no continuing City, Heb. 11. 13.
They look for a building made without hands, Psalm. 119. 19.
They are Passengers going through a strange Country where they be not known:
John 15. 19.
Here is but the beginning of their happiness, Heb. 13. 14.
which they have mingled with much sorrow, 2 Cor. 5. 1.
but they have a fulness of happiness prepared, 1 John 3. 2.
where they shall rest for ever without sin and sorrow, in the perfect fruition
of all that is good. True, the wicked shall not tarry here ever, neither yet can
they not be called Strangers here, because they have no better country nor
place, for they shall go to Hell: Here therefore is all their hope, all the
good that ever they shall have, that which follows is fearful: Therefore no
man needs envy at the prosperity of the wicked, their's that have most, seeing
they have all here they are like to have: But Gods Servants after they have
waded through this world, they shall come home, where they shall be with their
Father and all their Brethren and Sisters in all happiness, and more then can
be uttered.

If we be strangers in this world, Use.
and Heaven our country, then our duty is to behave our selves so as
strangers, for so do all true Citizens of Heaven walk in some measure: Many lay
claim to Heaven, having no right thereto, as by their very walking in this
world may appear. To discern the one from the other, consider these Notes:

1. A Pilgrim follows not the fashion of the Country he is in, Properties of
Pilgrims.
Applied.
What a fool was I? I have cast my self behind; so do Gods Servants, Romans 12.
4.
they follow not the evil guises and manners of this world: The world swear,
contemn the Word, and Ministers thereof, profane the Sabbath, Rail, Curse,
Whore, be Drunk, Backbite, Cozen, Dissemble, Lie, be Proud, and the like; these
they will none of: These be proper to the men of this world, we may not meddle
with these; and this is the Reason in the Text, We must abstain from fleshly
lusts: Why? These be for worldings of this world to follow, we that are
Spiritual may not follow fleshly lusts, but leave them to them that be but
flesh; but our conversation must be Spiritual, Holy, according to the Laws of
our Country, Zealous, Fervent, Pure, Chaste, Innocent, Merciful, Patient,
Godly, and the like; To Love, Fear, Trust in God, Worship him, Delight in his
Word and Saints, These be the fashions of Heaven our Country; therefore these
we must follow, Tit. 2. 11, 12.

So the true Christian Pilgrim, he spends not his time, nor sets his heart on
things of this world, all which he must leave behind, but trades in Grace, and
purchases Pearls of Knowledge, Faith, Repentance, Mat. 6. 19.
Patience, Peace, Joy, and the like, and Trafficks in the fruits of Faith, John
6. 27.
his good works, which he sends before him into his Country, Rev. 14. 13.
and in such Graces as he shall carry with him: Oh, how many have taken much
pains for belly, and back, and earth, but never prized the Pearl with the wise
Merchant, Psalm. 17. 14.
nor the means how to come by it? These have the portion here.

Applied.
they cast away, or meddle not with: So a true Christian uses all that will
help him in his journey, the Word, Sacraments, Luke 21. 34.
Prayer, and all such Spiritual Repasts, good Company, and such baitings and
refreshings as God offers him in his way; Heb. 12. 1.
as for worldly cares, or whatsoever presses down, he avoids, as all sin which
hinders in the way: He takes the benefit of the things of this life indeed, but
sets not his heart on them, neither overloads himself with worldly businesses
and cares, which might hinder him from good duties, or a right performance of
them, much less that make him run into evil: For a man then goes on his journey
to Heaven, when he awakes with God in the morning, as soon as it is convenient
goes to Prayer, then to his calling in Faith, and through the day neglects no
Spiritual duty, much less runs into evil of any kind, but walks on uprightly,
and with a good conscience uses the world as if he used it not: 1 Cor. 7. 31.
Such as regard not these, have no meaning to come to Heaven; For how should
they come there? As men cannot go on in the earthly way without baits and
refreshings, so neither the heavenly without these: They overload themselves so
with worldly business and cares, that they cannot go one step toward Heaven. O
how simply do many Christians walk in these days of Peace, not hasting at all
to Heaven! for if they did, they would not take such loads on their shoulders,
as make them go so stooping and staggering, as they can scarce go a right step
all day long.

4. Pilgrims traveling toward their Country, will be asking the Ier. 6. 16.
and desirous to know marks and notes, Applied.
whereby they may know when they are in their way, Luke 3. 10.
upon the view whereof they are very glad. Acts 3. 37.


So Christians that mind to go to Heaven indeed, will be asking the way there:
They will go to godly Ministers, and experienced Christians, and ask how they
might know the way, and whether they be in the way, and then finding these and
these marks in them; as, an hatred of all sin, a true desire in all things to
please God, seeking God in secret, as well as openly, with a true love to God,
his people and Word, they are not a little glad, but rejoice therein above all
riches: O how many deceive themselves, The way to heaven is straight, and few
find it: Most never ask the way, but go on at a venture; if they be in the
way, so it is, if not, they shall shift as well as others; and most please
themselves that they are in, without asking the way, as if it were a very hard
matter to miss the way to Heaven, and which but few do miss.

5. Pilgrims will in a long dangerous way, through a Wilderness, Applied.
or grieve themselves by going out of the way at all, if it may be: So will
every wise Christian besides asking, get a continual guide, which is the Word
of God, to go along with him, to direct him in every particular through the
day, yea his whole life: This David desired, and therefore did so often study
and meditate in the statutes of God, Psalm. 119. 11.
That they might be a light to his paths, and a lanthorn to his feet, and his
Counselors: This therefore we must read, hear, study, that it may dwell
plentifully in our hearts, in all wisdom, that we step not awry for want of
knowledge, or knowing the way, go contrary to our guides direction: we cannot
in every particular action and our dealings go and ask counsel, therefore we
must have the guide and counselor within us, to teach us to Buy, Sell, Let,
Hire, to deal with our Neighbors in Peace, Equity, Mercy, Truth: Therefore
David prays, Lead me in thy way, Psalm 25. 4.
O Lord, and let thy good Spirit lead me into the Land of righteousness; Psalm.
27. 11.
as one that would not go a step, but as he was led by Gods Word and Spirit.
The common sort therefore that dare do any thing, and never look for guide,
hereby show whether they are going: Gods Servants also herein are wonderfully
to blame, that sometimes for want of knowledge, sometimes for want of care, go
grossly out of their way; one step in the way, another out; in some things like
Christians, in some things like worldlings; some actions good, some nothing
less, When will such come to their journeys end? What traveling is this,
backward and forward, and then backward again?

They that cannot at all endure to be admonished, nor haste to amend, are not

true Christian Pilgrims, Applied.
they love all that set their faces to Heavenward with them, they call in any
wandering out of the way; If any be afflicted in Conscience for sin, or in Body,
or otherwise with any cross, or has met with hard measure from the world, and
begins to be discouraged, when Landlord or some great men frown, or is fallen
into some troubles, they encourage and hearten him with words of gracious
consolation out of the Word, the Aqua vitae of Gods promises; But the world
cannot abide them that go that way.

Its a great fault in Christians that they walk no more Pilgrim-like, love not
one another, are not able or careful to admonish others, but let one another
alone till the wicked cry out on them and the Gospel; and for Consolation, few
are able, few careful to look thereto. The rich encourage not the poor, one
heartens not on another, but every man goes by himself, and so are the weaker;
as when the Brands are plucked one from another, the heat departs: O we should
cleave together as Burs, for we have both Devil and World against us!

if from the hand of God, or for his sake, sickness, losses, crosses, they look
for no other in this vale and Pilgrimage: This comforts them that they shall one
day come to Heaven, their resting place, where they shall live with God in all
blessedness for ever; and if other troubles come one after another, they think
them no other then they made account of, its Gods wisdom that it should be
thus, that Heaven might be the sweeter, we might long the more for it, and be
weaned from hence: If an Englishman should be highly advanced in a strange
Country, he would the sooner forget his own; but in trouble, longs for his
own, and is so glad of it, as many Soldiers having met with much hardness in
other Countries have fallen flat, when they arrived and set first foot in
England again, and kissed the very ground, with O welcome sweet England! If
Christians meet with hard measure from the world, they bear out in hope of
Heaven; John 15. 19.
If they were of the world, the world would love them: They will not deny, but
confess Christ, here suffer for him, that hereafter they may reign with him:
Thus did the Prophets, Thus did the Apostles suffer; Therefore for those that
being put to, and in danger of displeasure, or trouble, flinch, join with the
world, and give over, they be no Pilgrims, they mean not Heaven in good
earnest, for if they did, they would not lose it for a few troubles: Its
therefore a sign they doubt whether they have any resting place or country
provided for them or not, for else they would not lose it, and men cannot have
Heaven both here and hereafter: 2 Cor. 5. 1.
But the true Pilgrim is confident he undergoes troubles constantly and boldly,
as knowing that he has a country which will pay for all.

we are taught to pray, Thy Kingdom come; and the Church prays, Matthew. 6. 10.
Come Lord Jesus; and St. Paul, I desire to be dissolved, and to be with
Christ; and old Simeon, Lord now let thou thy Servant depart in peace: Then
they shall be free from sin, from sorrow, shall be with God in perfect
happiness for ever: O if we were in Heaven but one minute, we would not be here
again to have every one a Kingdom; nay, if we knew what Heaven were, and that
it were for us, we would be sick till we came at it.

The best and precisest are not of this mind for ought I see, Object.
but if they be sick they send for the Physician.

We may, Sol.
nay dare do no other, though we were never so willing to dye, we may not break
the Lords prison by doing any ill to our selves, or neglecting any good to our
selves, or the use of any lawful means; If he set open the door, then we may go
out, but not break away, but be content so long here to stay, as God shall see
meet: The world cannot abide to think of death, or of the day of Judgment,
would buy them off, yea but to be deferred, with much money, an ill sign; nay,
many of Gods Servants be much to blame, some so addicted to the world, as not
willing to part with it: O ye be of little faith! Its base that any thing here
should take up our affections from longing to be with our true Inheritance:
Nay, thus some Christians are held lingering indeed, and that for wife and
childrens sake especially; namely, to see them brought up, and kept from evil
courses, seeing often the contrary, through the want of Parents, the wrack of
many children.

As for the most part, this argues weakness of faith in Gods providence,
especially if their desire be excessive, for God can provide for them without
us; moderately to desire life for this cause, or only to do God some other
service, is tolerable; always provided, that it be the love of nothing here
below that detaineth our affections, but that we so esteem of the world, and
all that is in it, as we see no cause in it, why it should take up our hearts,
and make us linger here: The causes that should make us desire to be hence,
should be sin, and the desire to be with God; sin to chase us hence, and the
love of God and Heaven, the excellency of that place and state should allure us
thither: Some desire to be gone, but its most ignorantly and desperately, for
its only because they be in trouble, full of pain, have many crosses: Thus
many make away with themselves, others impatiently wish to be gone; poor mad
fools, not knowing what is a coming, only looking to be eased of the present
grief: O our poor folly also, and the earthliness of many of Gods people that
are not wearied hence by sin, and by their corrupt nature, and continual spring
of sin, that they cannot be rid of, but annoys them daily and continually!
Therefore God is pleased to send them sorrows and pains, and with a week or
fortnights pain, they are made willing to dye, that were not so before: A great
fault of sundry Christians that have their hands and heads so full of business,
as they cannot desire to be gone, nay, had need of a twelve-moneths warning to
set their matters right: This is not Pilgrim-like, they may hap not have a
week; 2 Cor. 5* 2.
therefore so walk, as you may ever be willing to be gone, and be ever of this
mind, Phil. 1. 23.
that to be gone is most happy, and most to be desired.

advantage, that they have almost past the Pikes; young ones know not what

has brought him safely one days journey nearer his end then in the morning:
Many think they grow old too soon, too fast; if they could make their years

Verse 12. Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas
they speak against you as evil doers, they may by your good works which they
shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
Unto the former Exhortation of purging the heart, he adds this, of looking to
our outward behavior and conversation among men; namely, that it be honest,
good, godly, and every way such as may not only not be offensive, but may be
of good example, yea to the very wicked, that though for a time they speak evil
of us (as our nature is to do of every one that differs from us, thinking our
own courses still to be best) yet at last they looking more narrowly, and
seeing our constancy in well-doing, may be enforced to think well of us; and
whenever God shall touch their hearts with his grace, they may glorify God,
and say, This is the only true way of worshipping God, and thank God for it,
and all the means that have brought them to the sight of it.

The parts are two, 1. The Exhortation. 2. The Reasons thereof. The Exhortation
is to godly life, and that is enlarged by the circumstance of persons or
company, before whom, namely the Gentiles, that is, the Idolatrous, Wicked, and
Unbelieving. The Reasons, 1. That they may be prepared to their conversion, by
beholding our good life, which is set forth by the contrary in former time,
namely, their speaking ill of us. 2. That they may glorify God, which is set
out by the time, namely, when God shall please particularly and in a special
manner to bestow his grace upon them, so that by our innocent godly life led
among the wicked, we shall provide for our own credit, their good, and Gods
glory, which is the thing we should chiefly aim at in all our actions.

Here observe we first our Apostles order: He begins at the right end; as a
wise Builder he lays a good Foundation, then builds on it; as a skilful
Chyrurgion he first purges out dead flesh, then heals; which else would heal,
and break out again.

Reformation (if ever if be good) must begin at the heart: Doctr.
No man can have a good conversation whose heart is Unregenerate, Reformation
must begin at the heart.
and Unsanctified, for from the heart proceeds the life; if sin and lusts be
nourished there, they will break out as fire hid in straw or dry wood; for our
bodies are as apt to execute, See Ier. 4. 14.
as our hearts to broach evil: For one to purge the Channels, Mat. 12. 33, 34
and 15. 19. and 23. 26, 27.
and leave the Fountain foul, were to lose his labor; for one also to pull off
the tops of the weeds, and leave the roots still, 2 Cor. 7. 1.
were to no purpose: Tit. 2. 11, 12.
The heart must be washen, kept, cleansed from inward lusts, else no godly life.

1. This confutes the Papists that talk of good conversation, Use 1.
and yet regard not the heart, Acts 15. 9.
either seek after true justifying faith whereby to purge the same. Use 2.


2. This shows and rebukes the folly of those that think to frame a good life
as civil persons, and yet never knew the corruptions of their hearts, nor what
Faith means that purifieth the heart, nor make Conscience of their inward
lusts: Hence it is, that they shamefully deceive themselves, especially in the
first Table, and in the sight of a true Christian, that can tell what belongs
to good conversation. Numbers think upon occasion they will never do as they
have done, but promise great amendment; as upon hearing something out of the
Word, or after some affliction, or after they have been ashamed with some sin,
O they will do thus and thus, who alas never labor with their heart; Some say,
Give me but a shilling from you, and I Will never come at such a place, never game
more, etc. but alas, its not so soon done as said: They dig not deep enough,
they work not under ground, the heart's let alone all this while; they think to
cut off the sprouts, but while the root is whole, they shoot our again. Many at
variance are made friends, and promise, and think for the present so to
continue, yet not conscionably looking to the beginning and root, Pride,
Self-love, Wrath, and such lusts, but suffering them to abide there still, alas
they break out again presently: Mat. 5. 22.
Our Savior says, He that is angry with his brother unadvisedly, shall be in
danger of the judgment, etc. Hence comes Racha (fool) and murder; now if a
man think to keep his hand from murder, and his tongue from Racha, and such
distempered speeches, and yet suffer wrath in his heart uncontrolled,
unrepented, and unpurged, the other will break out. Hence is it, that many make
such fair promises, but perform nothing nay while together, because they have
not the grace to seek the washing of their heart from all sin.

3. It teaches Christians to be much occupied in searching and knowing their
hearts, Use 3.
and the corruptions and lusts thereof, and still be purging out of these, so
shall we do much work at once; else though we covenant not to be so worldly,
etc. as before, yet if the root of Covetousness, Unbelief and Pride be let
alone, we will to it again: So if one should say, I will not break out, but
live peaceably with my family and neighbors, yet if high mindedness and anger
continue, we shall be deceived, and shame our selves; and thus do many
Christians.

soberly. So that

Its not enough that we have or pretend to have a good heart and pure
conscience, Obser.
but we must also have a good conversation outwardly; Christians are also to
have a good conversation.
we must not only approve our selves before God and Angels, but also before
men; we must have a good outside, as well as a good inside; See Mat. 5. 16.
we must so walk, as men may see by our actions, speeches, and our whole
behavior, Romans 12. 17.
that we be the servants of God, 2 Cor. 8. 21.
and mind to go to Heaven: Isa. 4. 3.
Thus walked Abraham, Job, Zachary, Elizabeth, with others; we must thus walk
both for the winning of others on, and for the good report which we should be
careful to procure to our selves, Prove. 22. 1.
it being better then much silver: Eccles. 7. 1.
not that we must do good Pharisaically for the speech and praise of men only,
which is base and hypocritical, Phil. 4. 8.
for we are first to aim at Gods glory; yet we may desire also so to live, as
we may give good example, and get good report while we live, 1 Cor. 6. 20.
and a good memorial when we dye; and again, God will be served both in body
and soul, Tit. 2. 1^.
as we look to be glorified in both.

1. This stops the mouths of carnal men, Use 1.
that being dealt with for faults in their conversation, either ill done, or
good not done, they straight rid themselves with this answer, and blind them
that deal with them that they cannot see to take them as they think, O we have
as good an heart as you or any, and God knows my heart, and I have a good
conscience, God knows all, and he shall be my judge; yea, he will indeed so be,
and that too soon, except thy conversation be better: for deceive not thy self
by thinking thy heart is good, which affords an ill conversation, a merciful
heart, that has a niggardly hand, a chaste heart, that has a wanton tongue
and behavior, a godly heart, that can profanely spend the Sabbath in worldly
matters: But what if one should grant your heart were good, is that sufficient?
Is it not meet your hand and whole conversation were so? Did not he that made
that which is within, make that which is without also? Numbers care little for
their conversation, are not over nice and curious about that; so that they be
none of the worst, they think their condition good enough.

2. This rebukes those that blame men, Use 2.
and reproach them for their profession of Religion, O you are of these
Professors! O what a wretch art thou, that dare control another man's, nay
Gods servant, for doing his masters Commandments? Has not he enjoined us, that
our light should shine, and that we should confess him in our several places?
If thou be not also a Professor, be it known to thee, the Lord will one day
profess he never knew thee, and bid thee depart as a worker of iniquity: And
what do thou profess thy self, that railest on him for professing himself the
servant of God? The servant of the Devil, and one of the Malignant company, the
son of the Bondwoman, even persecuting the children of the Promise, therefore
one that shall never be heir with them, but shall one day wish to be shrouded
under any of them, but shall not be able: And what is his fault? Tit. 1. 16.
he is a Professor; The Apostle says, They profess they know God, this he
blames not, and take heed thou do not; but the latter part, 2 Timothy 3. 5.
By works they deny him, blame that if thou know it; Having a show of
godliness, this is praiseworthy, and every man must have it; But have denied
the power of it, if thou know this, blame it; but I would wish you to take heed
that you meddle not with their Profession, to discourage them from it.

in one thing as in another sutably: We must have respect to all Gods
Commandments, else shall we be confounded; Psalm. 119. 6.
God spoke all as well as some, Htb. 13. 18.
and so joined them together, that they may not be broken asunder: God can
abide no halving, James 9. 10.
though the Devil be so reasonable and manerly; Whatsoever we do in word or
deed, 1 Cor. 10. 31.
must all be done to his praise: This includes our general and particular
callings, Col. 3. 17.
duties of the first and second Table, all places, all times to serve God in
holiness and righteousness all the days of our life. Luke 1. 75.


This rebukes those that would be counted honest men, Use
and yet do but what they list: Some will yield in all great matters, but in
some small things as they take them; as when they say, By their Faith and
Troth, they must be born with, especially if true; so a game or two at Tables
or Cards, and if it be on the Lord's Day, in company of their equals, especially
of their betters, talk thereon of worldly businesses at their pleasure, Mat. 5.
19.
But he that breaks the least Commandment, shall be little counted in the
Kingdom of Heaven: Some again will yield in little things, the Word shall so
far prevail with them, but in some great beloved sin, Mark 6. 20.
they will not, as Herod; Some cry out against Covetousness, Mat. 23. 23.
and be Proud and Masterful; and so on the contrary, Some seem very devout and
forward in the first Table, and make little conscience of the second Table;
Some in their Shops and Dealings deceitful, hollow, and unjust; Some in the
state of servants, that show some forwardness to good duties, hearing, good
company, and the like, who yet fail exceedingly in the duty of subjection,
diligence, trustiness, and the like; Some profess the like also, and men say,
they be honest persons of good gifts, but they follow no calling, borrow here
and there, and never mean to pay, deal hardly with poor work-folks, etc. A man
must show his Religion in his particular calling: no man is a good man, that is
not a good Minister; if he be a Minister, so a Magistrate, Father, Husband,
Dealer: Some contrarily seem very smooth in the duties of the second Table, and
yet have no savor of the first; as 1. Papists, which are professed Idolaters, and
make no conscience of an Oath, nor of the Sanctification of the Lord's Day, who
yet keep a good house, and seem merciful and liberal, which yet they do
corruptly to merit by; and hence they get the commendation of a company of
carnal people, that measure all by the belly, and can look no further: Its not
possible for an absolute Papist, to be an absolute Christian. 2. Our civil
persons that give men their due, but God can have no part of his in any
Spiritual performance of duty, either on the week days or Sabbath days: Let all
that know its thus with them, know themselves but hypocrites, and let them halt
no longer, but if God be God, serve him altogether, and let him be whole, and
not either quarter or half-master, yet many men be good at plots: Would we like
in our field to have here a taste and there, and a great breadth after nothing?
No, but to stand so as we may spread a sheet and receive the fruit; when men's
obedience comes by fits, such aguish obedience Gods likes not: But if we would
approve our selves sound, and have true peace, let there be some proportion
between our actions; not some very forward, some quite another way; in some
things hot, in some as cold as ice; else like Nebuchadnezzars Image, Dan. 2. 33.
Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron, Clay, these things hang not together; lets not be
hot and cold, but the same in prosperity, adversity, at home, abroad, in all
companies, and the like. Doctr.


Among the Gentiles] That is, Christians ar^ to live godly even among the
wicked.
the wicked; Where note, That

Its our duty not only to live godly among the godly, but even among the
wicked so to do; we must not follow a multitude to do evil, Exodus 23. 2.
but shine among a naughty and crooked nation; Romans 12. 2.
we must not be made crooked by them, Ier. 15. 19.
if we can straighten them, so it is: If we see any go crooked or halt, Phil.
2. 15.
we will notwithstanding go as straight as we can, Genesis 6. 9, 12.
and not go crookedly as they: This is a commendation of Lot, That he continued
just in that filthy City; so of Noah, that when its said, That all flesh had
corrupted their ways, yet he was found Righteous, when they were in security,
he continued in zealous worshipping of God, and sincerity of life; Job 1. 1.
so of Job, That even in the Land of UZ he feared God, and eschewed evil: It
had been no such matter to have lived well in Abraham's or Jacobs Family, but in
such places a great mastery, and yet required of us: God has appointed we
should live among the wicked; In the worst places God will have his, and why.
though some places be worse then some (lets choose the best we can) yea, even
the very bad ones God will have his people, 1. That his power in gathering and
keeping them may be seen. 2. That their Faith and Patience might be proved, and
exercised, and increased. 3. That they might convert the ungodly, as through
Gods mercy it falls out sometimes, Heb 11. 7.
or if not, condemn them, as Noah condemned the old world: Genesis 13. 7.
In such places we must walk squarely, Neh. 1. 9.
as Abraham; and as the fishes retain their fresh taste, though they live in
salt waters, so must we our goodness in bad places, and among them that are set
on evil. True, its no easy thing with the cruel to live mercifully, with the
hurtful to live helpfully, with the profane to live holily, yet it is to be
attained unto, and we must labor for it.

1. This rebukes such Monks and Friars, Use 1.
as severing themselves from all company (because they would not be tainted nor
troubled with men's ill manners) betake themselves to a solitary, Hermits life.
Truly, if a man were only born for himself, it were a good, wise, and safe
way, though not most praiseworthy; But we are not born for our selves, but for
our Parents, Country, Gods Church, therefore we are not to m^w up our selves:
Besides, its no such mastery for a man to avoid all occasions, as to live among
occasions, and not be tainted with them; but let men seek no occasions, but
those that they must necessarily meet withal, and yet not be hurt by them, this
is most worthy: Its not so much commendation for a man to fly from his
Adversary, as to encounter and overcome him, or come away unhurt.

2. It rebukes those that be for all companies: Use 2.
In good company they will be sober, in ill as the company is, drunk with their
friends for company, will swear with swearers, lie also and dissemble when they
be with such, so thinking that they may hold with the Hare, and run with the
Hound; like the Camelion they change themselves into all colors, but these are
none of Gods honest men, they are not for his turn, as if he were not the God
of all places and times; let such know they have rotten and unsanctified hearts.

Q. But how should a man do to live well among such? How to live holy among the
wicked.


A. As they that live where the Plague is, take and use preservatives; So must
we daily pray to God next our heart to keep us in a continual hatred of sin,
considering often of the happiness of them that hold out: Think of Noah, Lot,
Abraham, and their commendation; observe the judgments that fall upon bad men,
and think what will be hereafter. Again, avoid private familiarity with them,
be kind to all, but familiar with no open bad man; we cannot touch pitch, and
not be defiled, walk on coals, and not be burnt; for so we shall be brought
either to like their manners, or at least cooled in our goodness; let them not
breath on us, from them there is great danger of infection. 2 Pet. 2. 3.

walk not so holily as they should, but if they do not approve of, yet consent
to their bad behavior, without dislike, especially being with their betters:
But he that is not with me, is against me, and though often we cannot do good
as we would, no nor stop evil, yet at least let our righteous souls always
grieve thereat, yea, and as much as may be show our dislike, by hasting out of
the company, and silence if we may not speak, and if we be asked our minds,
lets speak, though wisely and humbly; lets not dare to turn our backs upon God
and his cause, for any mortal man's sake, whether our Landlords, betters, or
otherwise; lets come as little in such dangerous places as may be, but being
there, lets take heed we deny not our Master with Peter; and hear goodness, or
Gods Servants railed on, or slandered, and we consent, or not show our dislike.

what would he then in the midst of all good means? what then is their sin, and
where shall they appear that break out, and live badly in the midst of the
means of good, the Ministry of the Word, good company, and the like, wherewith
they are shoared up on every side? what would these do, if they were far from
such means?

5. It rebukes those that professing Religion more then ordinarily, Use 5.
yet remember not with whom they live, but as if they were only among the
good, which would hide all their frailties, or interpret them to the best, not
as if they were among the wicked, that seek occasion against Gods Servants,
Canaanites and Perezites that desire no better booty then the fall of a
Professor, that not regarding this nor the Gospel, by their careless and ill
life, and the bad actions they break into, set open the mouths of ill men, not
upon themselves, that were the less, but upon the holy Gospel of the Lord
Jesus; for that they will fly upon straight, when alas the Gospel is not in
fault: the contrary was in Abraham, 2 Samuel 12. 14.
Woe be to the world, Genesis 13. 7.
because of offenses, but especially, Matt. 18. 7.
woe to them by whom they come: For hereby the good are grieved, the weak
hindered, the wicked strengthened in their dislike of the Gospel, and some of
whom there might be some good hoped, by this means held off: O you that have
thus done, thus hurt, repent heartily, and labor to make amends; and you that
are as yet free, pray God that ye may never live to that day (if it be his
blessed will) wherein ye should shame your selves, blemish the Gospel, and
grieve the rest of Gods faithful Servants; but that living and dying, ye may
credit it.

That whereas they speak against you as evil doers,] Reasons to provoke to a
godly life.
Now follow the Reasons to provoke to godly life; 1. We shall cause the wicked
to speak well of us, and of the Gospel of God, yea, though they have spoken ill
of us and it before, yet upon a serious consideration of our innocent and
constant conversation, they will change their minds. 2. They shall by that
means be brought to glorify God, and both like, and speak well of the truth,
which they shall then do, when God shall graciously visit their hearts, and
work by his Word and Spirit true conversion in them; then being prepared before
by our good life, they shall be made to glorify God for his truth, and for us,
and for opening their eyes, and moving their hearts to embrace it: Forcible
Reasons. We shall by our constancy in a good life, 1. Provide well for our own
credit, the credit of the Gospel, and the wickeds conversion. 2. Which is the
main, we shall provide for the glory of God.

In the first place is set down the nature, Observe.
disposition, and practice of the wicked toward Gods children; The wicked
speak ill of (...) truth of Go^ Religion, a^^ the professors thereof.
as they speak evil of the truth of God and Religion, so do they of those that
truly profess the same: Its in men's nature to mislike all that be of another
Religion and Practice then themselves, for such is our inb^ed pride, we think
best of our selves and our own Religion, and all others to be in error, and to
be deceived: The Crow thinks her own bird the farest; But though men mislike
all differing Opinions, yet none so much as the truth, that we naturally hate;
as black, blew, and green differ, yet not so much as black and white which are
opposite; so wicked ones hate the truth especially, for that is our nature to
do, and the more sincere any is in professing the truth, the more the wicked
naturally hate him; Thus have Gods children ever been ill spoken off: Matt. 5.
11.
Ishmael mocketh Isaac, Genesis 21. 9.
as his brood yet do: Gal. 4. 30.
Elias was reputed, A troubler of Israel; One of the children of the Prophets
counted a mad fellow: 1 King. 18. 17.
Micaiah smitten on the mouth, as one that spoke without God: 2 Kings 9. 11.
Jeremiah, with them is as one that raveth, and fit to be put in the stocks;
yea, they speak ill of the truth and goodness it self: Ezr. 4. 5, 6. ^17.
The Jews were accused for nothing but doing that which God required, and Cyrus
had permitted; namely, Neh. 6. 5, 6.
to build the City and Temple, Ester 3. 8.
wherein to worship and serve God; and they were a poor contemptible company in
the others eyes: Acts 24. 14.
So we read of them that called the Gospel Heresy; sore eyes cannot abide the
light: Matt. 11. 19.
Thus was our Savior Christ, Luke 11. 15.
the most innocent and blessed Son of God, John 8. 48.
reproached and spoken ill off, as if he had been a glutten, a winebibber, Acts
2. 19. and 6. 11. and 16. 20, 21.
was a Samaritan, and had a Devil: So the Apostle Peter and the rest, were
termed drunk; and Steven, that he had blasphemed God and Moses: They cannot
endure the wrath of God, because it crosses their humors and vile lusts which
they set so much by, See Acts 17. 18. and 19. 13. and 19. 6. and 24. 5. To come
down to the Primative Church, were they not most horribly slandered, as if they
had been Canibals, and lived of man's flesh, and eat their own children, That
they met in caves in the night to worship, and that then the candles being put
out, they committed filthiness promiscuously, without respect of Kindred, etc.
and if any plague came, as that Tyber did overflow to great hurt, and that
Nilus did not overflow her banks as it used to do, or any the like, it was
because of them, and by their means, thereupon they fell upon them, and killed
them like Dogs: Thus have they used always to incense great persons against
Gods servants, with such false suggestions, and to make them odious to the
common people: It has ever since been the manner of the Church of Rome, which
has a mouth that speaks blasphemies, to call the Truth, Error, and the
Gospel, Heresy; and with them, we that profess it be all Heretics, cursed to
Hell, and who should have nothing but fire and faggot if they could help it;
and the sincerest Professors, and godliest men, they hate most, and have ever
particularly devised horrible lies against the great men in the Church, whom
God has raised up to be hammers of their false Religion, and defenders of the
Truth, as of Luther, Calvin, Beza, Junius, and others; so in the powder
Treason, they had devised and purposed to spread it abroad by Proclamation (if
their detestable villainy had taken effect) That the Puritans blew up the
Parliament House, This sin rise in these days.
etc. Among our selves also Gods Truth and servants especially have enemies
enough; and none that hate the faithful Ministers and Christians worse, then
such as be in the bosom of the Church; How are they traduced, ill spoken of,
railed on universally in great places, in mean places, Note.
on Alehouse-benches, where not? If they can find any fault of theirs, its
that they rejoice in above anything, and they lie in wait for the same: If they
can observe no sin, but understand of any infirmity, which yet they strive
against daily, yet this shall be set abroad and increased, as some ugly thing,
when themselves and theirs have many filthy sores running on them, horrible
sins, which yet they account nothing: If any of themselves have never so many
faults, if he have but a little odd good quality, as to be somewhat courteous,
a Good housekeeper, and the like, O he shall be magnified as a right honest man
indeed: If any of Gods children have never so many graces, and but one
infirmity, this shall be set on the tenters, all the other hidden: If they can
know nothing, they will devise something; if not, yet if they do but hear any
thing flying, though never so unlikely, and from no ground, yet it goes for
good wares with them, and is received; nay, though they turn their own vices
into virtues, yet the virtues of Gods servants they make vices, for want of
other matter: If they be courageous in a stout cause, they be stout and
stomackful; if they be patient and gentle, then they be blockish; if wise and
prudent in handling their matters, crafty, subtle fellows; if diligent, very
officious; if they take pains in the offices they be called to, they be busy
fellow, meddlers, and trouble their neighbors; If they differ from others upon
never so good ground, they be Scismaticks, Proud, Singular, Humerous, Giddy; If
they dare not run with others into the same excess of riot, then precise fools,
Puritans; Oh, we must have a new world made for you, you are so holy, a company
of proud peevish fellows, etc.

1. Seeeing the wicked are so apt to speak evil, Use 1.
and lie so in the catch, we should give all diligence to look so to our ways,
as we give them no just occasion so to do, 2 Cor. 11. 12.
but take away occasion from them that seek occasion (for is it time for us to
be heedless, and our Enemies as it were lie in wait?) that they may look till
their eyes dazzle, and they be weary of looking, ere they have that they would,
and that if they speak ill of us, it may be unjustly, falsely, as none can
escape their ill tongues, See 2 Cor. 6. 8.
not our Savior Christ, innocence it self; therefore we may look for it, but
let it be without cause; as Hypocrites, yet such as labor for sincerity; hating
Hypocrisy, as troublers, yet such as seek the peace of Church and
Commonwealth.

its the nature of the world thus to do, as for the birds to fly, and we must
not be discouraged at it, and say, I have striven to do as well as I can, and
yet I am ill spoken of, I cannot tell what to do, and so faint and melt as wax,
as some do: O no, but let it be as a whetstone to sharpen you on more, 2 Samuel
6. 22.
as David said to Micol, I will yet be more vile; if spoken ill of falsely,
study innocence the more; being thus used, thou art blessed: Thus were the
Prophets served, Mat. 5. 11.
thus Christ himself; And if they have called the master of the house
Beelzebub, much more will they them of his household.

3. This might make men not too ready to believe reports, Use 3.
and think ill of men by and by upon flying reports, seeing the world are so
apt to speak evil wrongfully, especially of Gods children.

4. For them that be ill speakers of Gods Servants, Use 4.
they cannot bear a worse badge, as ill a sign as can be of any; for if he be
transl^ted from death to life that loves the Brethren, 1 John 3. 14.
what then he that hates them? Psa. 15. and 16. 2.
he is no true member of the Church, nor led by David's Spirit; but is of
Ishmaels generation, and will be cast out as he; worse then Balaam, nay, of
Satan's brood, who is the accuser of the brethren: How shall they escape the
curse threatened, Number. 33. 8.
Isaiah 5. 20. Prove. 17. 15? The Lord has prepared a day, Rev. 12. 10.
when he will judge them of these things: Jude, verse 14.
Therefore if you will not join with them, yet cease to speak ill of them: The
time will come when you would be glad to join with them, but it will be too
late.

They may be your good works, etc.] These words show the inducement whereby we
shall bring these ill speakers to think and speak well of us, Observe.
and of Gods truth, Good works the best way to put our adversaries to silence.
and so glorify him, namely, when they shall see us constant in good works. So
that

The strongest defense of our selves, or confutation of ill speakers, is not by
words, but by good works; for the world will not much regard words, they think
they be cheap, and themselves will speak any thing, and therefore think others
will do so too, and what can words do while the works are not seen, or are
contrary? Thus David confuted Saul, and quitted himself a good Subject: How?
not by telling Saul he meant him no hurt (he might have said so as long as he
would, it should never have been regarded) but by his good works, and innocence
toward him, that he never sought his hurt, no not when he might, as when he
cut off the skirt of his Raiment, and took the pot of water from his head; 1 Samuel 24. 17.
This made Saul say, Thou art more righteous then I, and for the time broke his
heart: This often does good, The constancy of men's carriage, overcomes them
that have thought and spoken ill: Many are carried away easily to think and
speak ill of Gods Servants, that know not why, as upon false suggestions, that
after having observed their lives, have changed their minds; as a Papist
having heard that Junius had a cloven foot (as it was current among them)
coming to the sight of it, and that it was contrary, he began to suspect their
Religion, and it was one means of his conversion therefrom.

This rebukes them, Use.
that being evil spoken of will take it very hotly, and by great words or
protestations clear themselves, or shift, when it may be they are faulty, and
give glorious speeches, when deeds answer not; and such as will be very angry,
and rate others, even before company.

Now if it be a matter of great weight, and that the Gospel hear ill also, we
may so do; but yet that is not all nor the most, we must confute them quietly
by a good life, and by all contrary good conversation.

Which they shall behold,] Observe.
Though the wicked will do no good works, yet they look we which profess
Religion more zealously, The wicked have an eye on the godlies actions.
should, and herein we are beholden to them: If any be forward in profession,
the world looks they should be very innocent in life, and it ought so to be;
and seeing not only God, Angels, and good men, look for good life, Use.
but even the very wicked, let us look to it, they may have that they look for,
and see what will come of it.

Good works,] See Downhams Warfar. part. 2. p. 53. cap. 7.
Here Is occasion offered to speak of good works, but I cannot at large;
consider we only briefly,

1. What good works are; What good works are.
namely, Things commanded of God, done by a Regenerate man in faith to the
glory of God in our Neighbors good. Col. 2. 23.
1. They must be things commanded; Gods Word being our rule, and that which
makes things good, what is forbidden then is vile, and what is of our own heads,
what show soever it has: Popish Religion stands most in such. 2. Done of a
Regenerate man, For who can bring a clean thing out of that which is unclean?
John 14. 4.
we had need look whether we be Regenerate, else we did never good in our
lives, whether in thought, word, or deed. 3. In faith, not only of a man that
has faith, Romans 14. 23.
but in a particular faith, that that action is lawful and warrantable by the
Word of God, let us look to our selves, I doubt many run to those Games, and to
Usury, which they have no warrant and Faith for. 4. The end whereat we must
aim, must not be our selves, nor our own merit, credit, profit, but Gods glory
in our neighbors good; and thus done, not only the duties of Gods Worship,
which indeed are principal, and duties done to our neighbors bodies and Souls,
be good works, but even our eating and drinking, and following our calling are
good works; though Papists make no good works, but such as maintain their
Religion by gifts, and such as fill the belly.

2. How necessary they are: How necessary they are.
They are of absolute necessity to Salvation, Ephesians. 2. 10.
the path to Heaven, yet not as causes of our Salvation and Justification
before God, as the Papists hold, but effects of our Justification to declare
the soundness of our Faith, and that we are persons justified. Papists cry out
of us, That we renounce good works, profess liberty, and set open a flood-gate
to sin, because we teach that works merit not; but we establish works better
then they, even true good works: They merit not.
We dare not yet say they merit, for 1. They are not done by our own power. 2.
They are but our bounden duty. 3. They are imperfect. 4. We are perfectly
justified, before we can do any good work, for we are justified by the
Righteousness of Christ, which is absolute and perfect, then follow good works
to declare we be persons justified, by true Faith, apprehending the
Righteousness of Christ; to declare our Election, our Faith to be living, our
selves justified persons, and in the way to Heaven: And are they so necessary
to Salvation? lets examine our lives; they that can witness to themselves
before God, that they unfeignedly hate all evil, and love God and his
Commandments, endeavoring in all things to be obedient thereunto, Ephesians. 1. 4.
let them be of good comfort, its a sign of Election, Romans 8. 1.
a mark of true Faith, Ephesians. 2. 10.
and one in Christ, and of one in the highway to Heaven: Therefore rejoice
what pains soever you have taken to come to this state, and proceed cheerfully:
This way will bring you to Heaven, may comfort you in assurance of Faith.

Glorify God] That is, may change their minds to think well of you and of the
Truth, be prepared to their Conversion, and when God shall work withal, break
forth into his praise. Hence note, That

If we continue in innocence of life, Observe.
we shall be the means that God shall be glorified, A Christians perseverance
in well-doing, procures glory to God from others.
not only in our selves by well-doing, but also that others shall so do, and
so we shall prepare them to Conversion, and make them like the better of the
Truth, and think they will be hearers too, and doers of Gods will; whereas on
the contrary, if we do contrary to our profession, we shall dishonor God
doubly, both in our selves, and move others so to do, and so set them further
off from the Truth which be too far already, and make them speak evil thereof:
O this ought to be the greatest spur to godliness that may be, we shall hereby
win our neighbors soul, as it were, and provide well for Gods glory, the two
greatest things that can be next our own Soul, and the latter far above it: O
who would not look to himself, when the Soul of our neighbor, and the glory of
God lies upon it, and the credit of the Gospel? so that the life of Christians
is not a little to be regarded, but great things depend upon it; and what joy
may we have of our selves to live to win our Neighbors, and bring glory to God?

O this rebukes the wonderful fault and negligence of many Christians, Use.
that partly falling into foul things, partly yielding unto their own
affections, are carried by their lusts, living as others, as froward, as proud,
as hard, and worldly, some loose of promise, some idle, some living in every
bodies debt, etc. do dishonor God, and beat others back from Religion! O if
there were no more but the single dishonor to God, it were too much,
considering what God has done for us! but, Oh! when so many lies are upon us,
that shall take hurt or good, what a fault is this to be careless? What a
fearful thing is it to live to set men further off from Religion, or open their
mouths against Religion? for they will not think ill or speak ill of you only,
but they will fly upon the Gospel, Genesis 13. 7.
and the name of God which is innocent: O therefore awaken your selves: welfare
Abraham, that knew well the Canaanites and Perizzites dwelt then in the Land,
therefore walk the more watchfully. O beloved, if ever we took good, it was by
the Gospel, and shall we thus require it? and do we profess Gods holy name, and
yet cause others to reproach it? O grievous!

In the day of visitation.] To visit taken two ways.
That is, when God shall in mercy look upon them, and work the grace of
Conversion in their hearts (visitting here is taken in good part, as Luke 1.
68. Isa. 24. 21, 22. as elsewhere in an ill part, as Exodus 20. 5.) when God
shall in his goodness turn his eye toward him that is in the snare of the
Devil, and by his Word and Spirit work Conversion in his heart. Whence note,

1. That Conversion is the work of God: Obs.
All men and Angels cannot change the heart of a man; Conversion is the work of
God.
its a work surpassing all Christ's miracles, and as great or greater then
making the world of nothing, and we our selves have no power, but lie dead in
sins; no, all the means in the world cannot do it without God: but we go on and
on in the Devils service, and hasten to destruction; and when we are thus
going, God says, Ier. 31. 18.
I will go visit yonder poor creature, who will else perish. We are Patients,
Convert thou me, and I shall be converted: No Minister, the best in the world,
has any power of himself; O see how they labor and sigh to do good to their
own Wives and Children, and yet see no good thereof; 1 Timothy 4. 16.
they only save as the Lords instruments, not otherwise.

Let them therefore which have felt this work, Use.
acknowledge God in it, and give him all the glory.

They that be yet without it, let them not defer it, as a small matter to the
last, as if they could couvert themselves when they list, as most men's behavior
is, but that they humbly seek it of God, in attending on his Ordinances
appointed to that end.

2. That its Gods great mercy to convert a sinner, Obs.
Oh, its the greatest mercy that can be bestowed; Its of Gods great mercy.
a mercy to be delivered from sickness into health, from Prison into liberty,
from poverty to riches, from death to life; as of Israel out of Egypt, Joseph
out of Prison, etc. But alas, Col. 1. 13.
these be but toys to this; To be delivered out of the power of darkness, and
translated into the Kingdom of his dear Son; to have his eyes opened that was
blind, raised out of the grave of sin, delivered out of the slavery of Satan
and bondage of sin, from being a limb of Satan, to be a member of Christ, O the
most happy change that can be expressed! This is the happy day for a man; then
Salvation comes to his house, where none was before: Thus was Zacheus, thus
three thousand at one time, thus the Jailer, thus many among us are visited;
Mat. 18. 3.
O happy visitation, and day to be remembered! We never see good day, till this
day come; we may see merry days, sinful days, but never good day till this,
without this undone.

Let those that have felt it and obtained it, Use.
for ever give glory to God.

3. That a man can never glorify God, Observe.
till God thus visit and convert his Soul; No man can truly glorify God till
he be converted.
for so says the Text, That they may glorify God, When? when God shall visit
them.

Therefore labor for this, for what can we do without it? nothing but dishonor
him, Use.
do not at all glorify him: O that this were considered!

4. That when a man is converted, Obs.
then he will glorify God; So soon as a man is converted he will glorify God.
yea, he cannot choose but in heart admire Gods goodness, and love him; in
tongue, break out into his praise of his truth and service; and in his life
seek to glorify him: Luke 22. 32.
Then will he also do all he can to gain others, as Christ to Peter; as good
hide fire in straw from breaking out, and hold oil in your hand, as not thus
glorify him when once converted: They see their case so happily altered, as
they never took so much pleasure in sin, but now it vexes them as much, and
they are as desirous to glorify God.

Therefore when men in heart are not moved, Use.
have no tongue to praise God, speak of his Truth, call upon others, nor in
lives study to please God, let such know they are yet in their sins, and not in
the number of converted persons.

5. That even such as have been ill speakers of the Truth and Gods servants,
Obs.
may yet be converted, Even the slanderers of the Truth may become Converts.
and prove good Christians; for why? God draws his number out of the Devils
rabble, for so we are all by nature: So was Paul, yet proved an excellent
Christian, so no question there are some in this company, Acts 2. 13.
that would not now do that they have done for all the world. Romans 6. 17.


1. Never despair of them that be very bad, 1 Cor. 6. 9.
but pray for them, Tit. 3. 3:
give them good counsel; Use 1.
Who knows what God will do, especially being come of good Parents? Above all,
lead an innocent life before them, which may so work with them, as in Gods good
time they may be happily changed.

2. This may be an exceeding provocation to the worst, Use 2.
that they may prove good and be saved, as unlikely as it is: Me thinks it
should wonderfully move vile wretches to fall down and humble themselves before
God, and never cease till the Lord do as much for them, as for the Jailer, and
others, seeing it is a thing that may be, and God has set down such examples
to that end: 1 Timothy 1. 13. 16.
Thy disease though grievous, yet is not irrecoverable, so thou seek to the
Physician of thy soul in time; Isa. 1. 18.
therefore dispare not: They that seek earnestly, labor, strive, give all
diligence, study, call for wisdom, cry for understanding, and that early, to
day while it is called today; (and when God call men to repentance, and points
no time, he means the time present, as in writings between man and man) They
that thus seek, shall find.

3. Yet let none in stead of good take hurt by this, Use 3.
and heart to go on in sin, seeing vile persons, and the worst may become
converts, and saved ones (so they may, as they may handle the matter, seeking
the Lord humbly and speedily) for if any think they have not done enough
already, and therefore will go on to add new sins unto their old, and that its
too soon, and will put off, and presume that they may repent when they will,
and so shall at last; let such know, they shall find God a just and severe
revenger of all such proud contemners and presumptious persons: O many such
shall rounce at Gods mercy-gate, that shall never come in; Matthew. 25. 12.
as the five foolish Virgins; and Esau, that sought the blessing, Heb. 12. 17.
though with tears: how many be now in Hell, that had thought to have repented
before their death, and so enjoyed Heaven? No, men shall know, they shall not
despise his mercy at their pleasure, and yet have it at command: Prove. 1. 28.
Then shall they call upon me (says the Lord) but I will not answer, Isa. 55.
6.
they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: Therefore, Seek ye the
Lord, while he may be found; call ye upon him, while he is near.

Verse 13. Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake,
whether it be to the king as supreme, Verse 14. Or unto governors, as unto them
that are sent by him, for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of
them that do well.
NOw follows the second part of this Chapter, The sum of the second part of
this Chapter.
containing Exhortations to certain kinds of men, according to their
particular and special callings and places, (as the former have been
Exhortations to duties of Sanctification, belonging to all Christians) and
chiefly of the duties of Inferiors toward their Superiors, namely, of Subjects
to their Magistrates, Servants to their Masters, and in the beginning of the
following Chapter, of Wives toward their Husbands.

These Verses, The parts of these Verses, and that which follows.
with that which follows, contain the Subjects duty toward their
Magistrates; wherein we have

1. An Exhortation, in these words, Submit your selves to every Ordinance of
man, 1. An Exhortation.
That is, whatsoever kind of Government you shall live under, (for all
Kingdoms, Countries, Provinces, Cities, be not governed after the same sort)
termed the Ordinance of man, not because its ordained by man, (for its Gods
Ordinance) but because its proper to man, and is so much for his benefit: This
submission consists as well in our willing bearing their Superiority over us,
and patiently bearing our inferiority under them, as in doing all the duties of
our places to them, and that whether they be worthy of it, or not: Those are
distributed into the Principal and Supreme, the King, or those that are
Subordinate by him, Governors.

2. Reasons to enforce the same: 2. Three reasons to enforce the same.
1. The Lord is the Author of Magistracy, and requires our subjection,
therefore we ought to yield thereunto. 2. They are appointed for the great good
of Church and Commonwealth, the punishment of evil doers, and praise of them
that do well, without which no Society or Kingdom can stand. 3. Its Gods mind
that hereby we should put to silence the ignorance of foolish men.

Before I come to the words in particular, consider we two things in general;
The first from the Coherence: As before he would have them in their whole
conversation to behave themselves as Christians, and exhorted them to a godly
life; so he does now require them to show the same in their particular
callings, and in those special places wherein they were put. Whence note, That

Every man's duty is to show his godliness in his particular calling; Doctr.
As the General of a Field appoints every one their places and standings, Every
man must show forth his godliness in his particular calling.
Horsemen, Footmen, Gunners, Pikemen, etc. accordingly requiring and expecting
of each the performance of his duty in his several place: So has the Lord
appointed some Superiors, others Inferiors; and accordingly every man must show
his goodness as in all things, so in his particular calling especially, and be
faithful in the trust reposed in him therein, as one friend should be to
another, especially in great and weighty businesses: Every place whereunto a
man is called, as to be a Husband, Magistrate, Minister, Householder, etc. has
a special trust going along therewith; so that whosoever will show himself godly,
if he be a Magistrate, he must be a godly Magistrate; if he be a Minister, he
must be a godly Minister, etc. Thus Abraham was a godly man, which he showed in
being a godly Householder; So Joshua, in being a godly, zealous, courageous
Captain; So David, Jehoshaphat Hezekiah, Josiah, in being godly Kings,
suppressing Idolatry, and setting up the true worship of God.

1. This shows and unvizardeth many to be bad which would be counted honest
men; Use 1.
They being Magistrates, do (alas) either take against goodness, and defend
evil, or at least like Gallio, care for nothing: So being Ministers, have no
will, nor skill, gifts or ability to teach the people, nor give example of true
godliness: So Householders, if they be not ill examples of swearing,
idle-talking, profaning the Lord's Day, and the like, yet make no account to
govern their Families aright, in reading the Word, instructing them therein,
Praying with them, and the like: Therefore let none so think of themselves as
of honest men and godly, which be not godly in their special Calling; neither
let others commend such for such, though happily endued with some good qualities:
O he is a very honest man! Its a foolish and lying commendation, whosoever is a
godly man, will be good in his particular Calling: Before they enter thereinto,
they will find themselves fit for the same, or if they must needs take the
same upon them, they will labor to fit themselves, and therein (for all are not
fitted alike) do their utmost endeavor: So if a man be godly, he will be a good
Householder, and where Gaming and the Devils Books were wont to be rife, there
have Gods Books read, and Prayer exercised: Therefore whereas the godliest
Preachers and Christians are wont to be blamed, as men that cannot abide
Government, and would pull the Scepter out of the Magistrates hands, (as Korah
with his companions) this must needs be a foul slander; for be they godly men,
yea in the conscience of their adversaries, then can they not but be good
Subjects, and are indeed the best Subjects, who pay to the King according to
their ability most willingly, that pray for the King most often, and heartily,
that break fewest of his Laws, and they lead a godly life, to keep Gods wrath
away from the King and Realm, whereas others live badly, and thereby provoke
God against both.

2. Its necessary that men labor first to be godly, Use 2.
ere they enter into their particular Callings: O then would they be godly
Magistrates, Ministers, Householders; and the contrary is the cause of so much
wrack in Church and Commonwealth. Why be there so many wicked Husbands, and
lewd and disobedient Wives, so many careless Householders, that care not for the
souls of their Servants and Children, and why so many bad Ministers? even
because they be bad men, and have not first endeavored to be holy.

The second, The reason why the Apostle is so earnest with them for duty in the
place of Inferiors; Its twofold, partly upon a conceit that was in the mind of
the Gentiles, that Christ's Apostles and their followers were Enemies to
Government, and could not abide Caesar (which came to pass as well through
wicked men, raised up by the Devil) which feigning themselves to be holy men,
did rebelliously set themselves against Caesar's Government, Acts 5. 37.
and drew the people away; as Judas of Galilee, who feigned himself to be
Christ, and was an Enemy to Caesar, and persuaded the people, that seeing he
was an Heathen Emperor, they needed not pay him tribute: Hereupon when Christ
came, Matt. 22. 17.
he was asked, Whether it was lawful to give tribute to Caesar, or not; Luke
23. 2.
and notwithstanding of his wise and Subject-like answer, yet at his
arraignment he was accused as an Enemy to Caesar; and because he said he was a
King (as indeed he was, though no worldly King, and his Kingdom and Caesar's
might well enough stand together) they thought he could not but be Caesar's
Enemy; as for that the wicked and Heathen Emperors would try their obedience in
unlawful things, as by commanding themselves or their Images to be worshipped
(so were Daniel and the three Children tried) which they not daring to obey,
though they yielded patiently in the punishment inflicted on them, were
therefore counted Rebels (though to try men in bad things, be no true trial of
believers) and partly, because of a disease of the Jews, whereof they were
somewhat sick, and in part faulty (which notwithstanding was not occasioned
either through Christ, his Apostles, or the Gospel) even that they thought they
should not obey these Heathen Magistrates, and the Roman Empire under which
they now were, and that not only for that they came in wrongfully, ruled
wickedly, and besides were bad men, but by misconceiving of the freedom
purchased to them by Christ: They were made free, therefore (thought they)
ought not to be bound; were the children of God, and heirs of HEAVEN, therefore
not to be subject to bad men: For those causes, I say, the Apostle is so
earnest, even that hereby he might remove as well that conceit of the Gentiles,
as cure this disease of the Jews. Hence note,

1. That its the duty of Ministers to prevent offenses, Doctr.
or remove false conceits out of men's minds; Ministers must labor to remove
false conceits out of men's minds.
and in this particular to teach the people subjection, to provoke thereto, to
practice it in all lawful things; for the world still has this conceit of Gods
Ministers and Christians, and that upon the very like grounds (some having
risen up from time to time, that have either had ill causes, or if good,
handled them very ill, and have been of a railing, scoffing spirit) but let it
be known to all that be so minded, that the faithfullest Ministers and
Christians usually thus slandered, are as true lovers, and as much subject to
Government, as any other whatsoever, and so teach the people, by whose
Ministry people are both brought to be good Subjects, and likewise to continue
in subjection.

2. Ministers must speak to the purpose, Obs.
and apply themselves to the state and necessity of the people they live
amongst, Ministers must apply themselves to the state and necessity of their
people.
observing what duties be most neglected, and what sins be rifest among them,
accordingly persuading to the former, and dissuading from the latter.

Submit your selves to every Ordinance of man,] He says not, Love, that had
been too familiar, Romans 13. 1.
nor Obey, that had been too straight, but Submit (as elsewhere, The duties of
Subjects to their superiors
be subject) which comprehends both, and all other duties of Subjects: Those
may be referred to these four heads, Reverence, Obedience, Thankfulness, and
Prayer; of every of which I have heretofore spoken at large. These we had need
to hear of, for whose heart must not needs accuse him, that he has failed much
in them all? needful they are to be known and practiced, that we may procure
honor to our Profession, when we declare it by subjection in all parts thereof,
and herein exceed those that know not God, nor have had the like means of
Salvation, as we have: And had we done our duties better to our Magistrates, no
question we might have enjoyed more good by their means, and so shall for the
time to come, if we make more conscience hereof; yea, its necessary that women
should hear these things, that being Widows, they may pay such dues as are
required of them, or Wives be helpful to their Husbands in persuading them
hereunto, and that willingly and cheerfully: This condemns the Anabaptists,
as flat opposite to Magistrates and all these duties.

For the Lords sake,] The first Reason to move us to subjection, God requires
the same.
The first Reason to move us to subjection, God will have it to be so, who has
ordained Magistracy; therefore though there be nothing in the person to deserve
it (yet are they very bad Magistrates that be not better then none) and though
they abuse their calling, yet do the forenamed duty, for Gods sake who has
appointed them: Neither must we do the same, either for fear of punishment on
the one side, or hope of reward on the other, but for the reverence we owe unto
God; we must not only do good things, but do them on a good ground, and in a
right manner.

This rebukes the most part, Use.
who, were it not for fear of after claps, and that they should hear of it,
would do nothing, but this is not thank-worthy; Slaves do thus, and they that
thus do, their service may be beneficial to the Magistrate, but themselves
shall have no benefit of their doing, as not proceeding from a right mind: We
ought not to curse (or speak ill of) the King or Magistrate in our thought,
Eccles. 10. 20.
or in our bedchamber, which yet they cannot come to know, for God knows it,
who will revenge it: We must submit our selves for conscience sake. This is
indeed right obedience, and whereof we may have comfort.

Further, How the Laws of Magistrates bind us.
Magistrates Laws bind us by virtue not of them, but of God; we must obey
them, and all their good Laws bind our Consciences; But why, and how? because
they be men's Laws? No; for no man has power over the conscience, but by virtue
of a Commandment of the Lord, who has set them, and given them power to make
Laws for his Worship, and for Civil things agreeable to his Law, and bid us
obey them; so that their Commandments bind not our conscience by virtue of
them, or any power they have over our conscience, but by virtue of Gods
Commandment, and not otherwise. Again, when any that have no authority from
God, shall give Laws, they bind us not, as not being the parties allowed of
God to make Laws: Thus are not we to obey the Popes Laws, we are not to obey
the Laws which a company of Rebels gathered together under some great man (as
say, Absalom) do set forth, they touch not the conscience; yea, if even right
Magistrates that may make Laws, make wicked ones, contrary to Gods Law, those
their Laws do not bind the conscience.

Whether it be to the King as supreme], A distribution of Magistrates.
In these and the following words is a distribution of Magistrates, whereof the
King is Superior and chief in his Realm, as were David and Solomon Kings of
Israel. The King here meant was Caesar, that came in unjustly, ruled
Tyrannously, and was an Idolater, to whom notwithstanding they were to do the
forenamed duties, as amongst the rest to pray for him; How much more then are
good Kings to be prayed for?

A King in his Dominions, A King is supreme Governor over all in his own
dominions, and in all causes.
and as far as his Kingdom reaches, has Sovereignty and Power over all, and
is the principal: None is above him in his own Kingdom, not is any exempted
from his Government: He is under God the chief, its so with no other;
Constables have Justices above them, they Judges, these the Kings Counsels,
above them the King, above him none, as none were above David and Solomon: He
is over all persons, and in all Causes the chief; Persons, whether high or low,
rich or poor, men or women, Ministers or people: He may Tax them, Censure them,
Depose them, Imprison them, yea put them to Death, Ministers (if they deserve
it) as well as others: Exodus 32. 21.
Moses rebuked Aar^n for the golden Calf; Joash found fault with Jehoiada and
the Priests, 2 Kings 12. 7.
for the money no better employed; Solomon deposed Abiathar, 1 Kings 2 27.
and set up Zadock in his room: Causes, not Civil only touching men's goods,
lands, lives, and right and wrong, but Ecclesiastical also, as to make Laws,
and take Order for the worship of God, the Preaching of the Word,
Administration of the Sacraments, the behavior and maintenance of Ministers,
and the like, and accordingly to see them done, as did Asa, Jehosophat,
Hezekiah, and Josiah: So that a King may be well and truly said to be Supreme
Governor over all persons, and in all Causes, yea, and Supreme head in a
borrowed speech, as the Husband is the Wives head, not to make new Laws not
agreeable to Gods Law, but to be keepers of the two Tables of Gods Law, and to
rule according to them.

1. This condemns the monstrous pride and arrogance of the Pope, Use.
that challenges and takes upon him to be Supreme head over the Church, and
that he may set up and depose Princes, he may Curse and Excommunicate, and
command to go to War at his pleasure, and that he may exempt Subjects from
their allegiance, etc. He is a Liar, Usurper, and a Thief, What has he do in
England? who gave him his Authority? He is a Minister if he be Saint Peter's
Successor, and has the Spiritual Sword to fight withal, but he challenges
both Swords, Temporal and Spiritual too, too much in conscience for one man;
for one hand to hold and handle two Swords, whereas each will take up the whole
man.

But how came he by them, especially by this Temporal Sword, and civil
Authority, as to kill, imprison, and do what a King may do?

Oh, Object.
Christ gave him the Spiritual Sword, which is the greater, therefore did give
him the Civil, which is the lesser.

A sound argument: Sol.
The King gives a Nobleman a great Office, therefore has given him one that is
lesser, Does this follow? Yea, to maintain this his usurped Power, they do so
woefully abuse the Scriptures, that it would grieve any heart; as where Peter
was bid, Arise, Acts 10. 13.
kill and eat; Peter might kill Beasts, therefore the Pope may kill men, a
goodly argument; This would rather authorize the Pope to play the Cook, See Dr.
Hillet, Mr. Wiggons and W: Barclay, on this Subject.
then the King: So Peter's dealing with Ananias and Sapphira, and Paul's, with
Elimas the Sorcerer are alleged, but was their's with the Temporal Sword? was
it with force or violence? was it not with the Word of God? This makes nothing
for his Civil Power, Christ refused it, when they would have made him a King,
and when he was desired to divide an Inheritance: So these speeches of our
Savior, Luke 22. 26, 28.
He that has no Sword, let him sell his Garment and buy one; and when they
said, Lord here are two Swords, he said unto them, It is enough: But hereby our
Savior does only put them in mind of the danger of the ensuing times, and
that they should prepare themselves for troubles, not that they should
otherwise resist then with the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God; for
afterward when Peter used his material Sword against the Officers, Mat. 26. 52.
our Savior willed him to put up the same: Whatsoever therefore the Pope, or
any for him can allege, we may safely take the Oath of Supremacy; They that
will not, are not to be trusted for good Subjects.

2. This condemns the Clergy of Rome, Use 2.
that exempt themselves from all Princes Authority, Romans 13. 1.
whereas God has said, Let every soul be subject to the higher powers: If they
have souls they must be subject; But how do they exempt themselves? 1. As they
say, Jure Divino, 1 Cor. 2. 15.
from that of Saint Paul, He that is Spiritual, judges all things; yet he
himself is judged of no man: An horrible abuse of the place, which ayms at no
Civil Judgment, but only at judging by the Spirit of God of things Divine,
which a natural man cannot attain unto; meaning, that as a Natural man cannot
judge of Spiritual things, so none can judge of a Spiritual man, but he that is
endued with the same Spirit. 2. By the Donation of Constantine; but its not in
the power of Princes so to do: They may exempt them from Tribute, if they will,
Genesis 47. 22.
as Pharaoh took not the Priests Lands to gage for Corn; but to exempt them
from subjection, they cannot. This were to make themselves wiser then God, who
has put them under their Authority, yea, the too much indulgence and favor of
Emperors, has been the bane of the Church, and helped up the Pope into his
stirrup; Therefore its wisdom in them to hold their Authority which God has
given them.

Or unto Governors, Subordinate Magistrates are also to be obeyed.
] A King is but a man, and cannot rule a Kingdom by himself, and therefore must
have others under him for the same purpose; in War, Generals, Captains,
Lieutenants, etc. and in Peace, Exodus 18. 21.
Judges, Justices, Majors, Baliffs, Sheriffs, Constables, Deuteronomy. 16. 18.
etc. accordingly was Jethro's Counsel, Prove. 8. 16.
questionless by Gods direction; accordingly was Gods own prescription, and by
him do they also rule: Such did Jehoshophat set throughout all the Cities of
his Land, 2 Chronicles. 19. 5.
City by City: These be the Princes eyes to see, and hands to execute
Judgment, who therefore must be obeyed, even the meanest of them.

This condemns them that are afraid to commit Treason against the King, Use.
but for other Magistrates, they care not for them, set light by them,
sometimes outface them: An Officers gown has been heretofore more feared, then
his person now, so proud and insolent are youth grown in these lewd times, that
with the Judge in the Gospel, Luke 18. 2.
they neither fear God nor man: In Jobs time, the wicked would fly from him,
Job 29. 8.
when they saw him; but now tell a company of drunkards in an Alehouse, that
the Constable comes, what care they; yea, they will not only sit still there,
but with vile speeches outface him: This comes to pass partly through the
coldness and remisness of Magistrates, whereby they lose their authority, which
is Gods judgment on them, and partly through the boldness of youth, over in
times past: Let them look to it, they resist not only the King in the meanest
Officer, but even God and his Ordinance, and shall receive to themselves
judgment, whom God will pursue, though men connive at them: Such contemners of
Magistrates for the most part come to the gallows, or such fearful ends.

As unto them that are sent by him,] Both the Supreme and Subordinate are sent
of God.
This is in effect the same with the foregoing Reason. There is a nature in us
contrary to this subjection, but we must submit our selves to them, for they be
sent of God, both the highest and the lower ones: Prove. 8. 15.
The powers that be, are ordained of God. Romans 13. 1.


1. This teaches all sorts of Officers and Magistrates, Use 1.
to be careful in the performance of their duties, remembering that they are
sent of God, that they bear his Name, and that he will call them to an account:
They that are faithful in this trust reposed on them, shall receive a good
reward; as contrarily, they that do his work negligently, Mat. 25. 26. 30
and are unfaithful, shall hear this doleful sound, O evil and unfaithful
Servant, etc. take and bind him, etc.

2. It teaches them to do their duties courageously: Use 2.
They have a sure back, 2 Chro. 19. 6. ^^
he that sets them on work, is able to defend and maintain them.

3. People must submit themselves to them, Use 3.
they are sent of God; if they do not thus, they shall answer the same at their
uttermost perils.

For the punishment of evil doers, The second Reason.
and for the praise of them that do well.] The second Reason of the foregoing
Exhortation,

Its taken from the end of Magistrates, The end why Magistrates were ordained.
appointed for the great benefit of a Commonwealth, even to punish evil doers,
commend and defend the good, without which no Kingdom could stand; as there
could be no garden, if all the Hogs in the Town were suffered to root it up; no
orchard, if Cattle were suffered to eat it off the buds, and bark of the trees,
etc. so that unless we be vipers, and seek the ruin of our Country, we cannot
but acknowledge the benefit we get by Magistrates, and accordingly perform our
duties toward them.

As they are to make good Laws, Use.
both for the worship of God, tending to his glory, and the Salvation of their
peoples Souls, and the preservation of Justice and Peace (wherein Mercy and
Judgment are to meet together) and are to justify the Righteous, Psalm. 101. 1.
and condemn the wicked (as good gardiners pull up the weeds, Deuteronomy. 25. 1.
but cherish good herbs) whereby virtue may flourish by due encouragement, and
vice may be suppressed by due punishment: So must we accordingly behave our
selves toward them for their encouragement.

For the punishment of evil doers,] God is a just God, who both hates and
punishes sin; Exodus 34. 7.
so must Magistrates do, they have not the Sword for naught: Magistrates must
punish evil doers.
It must not be as a childs Dagger, never drawn out, or rust in the scabberd,
as those hanged up in our houses in the times of Peace: Samuel hewed Agag in
pieces, Joshua put Achan to death, Moses was zealous this way: Exodus 18. 21.
Magistrates must be men of courage, Deuteronomy. 25. 2.
and must punish the wicked according to their fault; Prove. 20. 30. and 29. 15.
This is the ready way to bring them to repentance (as the rod and correction
gives life to a child) and keep others from the like faults. Deuteronomy. 21. 21.
Thus was the stubborn son to be stoned, that all Israel might hear and fear:
Hereby also they stay the cry of sin, and so provide for Gods glory, and safety
both of Church and Commonwealth: If they smite not, God will, as Elies sons and
Agag.

1. This rebukes the wonderful coldness of most Magistrates, Use 1.
that care not whether they have any ill doers brought before them, if they can
shift it off; or if they be brought, yet handle them so gently, that not only
that are not the more reformed, but the more emboldened in their wickedness,
and such as complained of them quite discouraged; See Eccle. 8. 11
a fearful thing. Thus under color of mercy, sin is increased, God dishonored,
the Commonwealth marred: Thus whereas they might do much good, they do much
hurt to others, they hurt also themselves; as Saul in sparing Agag, and Ahab in
sparing Benhadad: How will Magistrates answer this? God calls, Who is on my
side? Psalm. 119. 126.
Who? he looks who will help him against the mighty; assuredly its now time for
him to work: O let Magistrates look to this, they shall provide well for
themselves against the time of need, they may look for help from God, and say
as Nehemiah, Remember me, Neh. 13. 22.
O Lord my God, in goodness, according to all that I have done: This is also
the sin of Headboroughs and Constables, that are not zealous to find out such,
and complain of them, but rather cold, loath to stir for being counted medlers,
Ier. 9 3.
etc. so that we may say, men have no courage for the Truth, Isa. 59. 4.
and no man calls for Justice: And thus they make themselves work while they
shun it, for so sin increases, and will set them on work whether they will or
not.

2. This rebukes also all such as take part with persons and causes; Use 2.
There Is no Town but has vile persons in it; there is none so vile, but lightly
one rich man or other that should join to punish him, takes part with him: If
they cannot escape the curse that help not the Lord against the mighty, Judge. 5.
23.
what shall become of them that help the mighty against the Lord, and all that
seek to punish them? a threefold curse waits for them, and where shall they
appear?

And for the praise of them that do well.] Magistrates should stand for
well-doers
God loves and rewards well doing; so should Magistrates, they must defend and
advance such; their eyes must be upon the faithful in the Land, Isa. 32. 1, 2,
etc.
and with Cornelius, Romans 13. 1.
they should have such wait on them as fear God. Psalm. 101. 6.


1. This rebukes those that hearten not good persons, Acts 10. 7.
when they come with complaints to them, Use 1.
neither show any countenance to such.

2. Much more them that set themselves against those: Use 2.
O its a sickly time, when the best be most afraid and punished! As Micaiah
imprisoned by Ahab, Eliah feign to fly from Jezabel, and Jeremiah put in a
Dungeon, Mephibosheth deprived of his means, Daniel cast into the Lions Den,
etc. Magistrates should not be feared of them that do well, yet its often so;
so it was in Queen Mary's time, the godliest hid their heads in Woods and Dens,
were Imprisoned, put to Death, whereas Idolaters were in request: In such cases
we had great need to pray for redress.

Verse 15. For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
silence the ignorance of foolish men.
A Third Reason of the foregoing Exhortation; The third Reason.
Its Gods will that we submit our selves, that by this means we may stop bad
men's mouths that would, Its Gods will that we should obey.
if we did not obey, speak ill of Professors, and of the name of God, and the
Gospel it self.

For so is the will of God,] That Gods will ought to be that which should lead
and bind us, I have heretofore proved at large on the third Petition of the
Lords-Prayer; which as it should upon all other particulars, so ought to
prevail with us in this duty of obedience.

That with well doing ye may put to silence, etc.] Of good works what they be,
and how needful they are, I have spoken on verse 12. add we here one end more;
Namely, that

Good works, The godly through their good works stop the mouths of bad minded
persons.
or a godly innocent life in obedience to Magistrates, and all things else is
of necessity to stop up the mouths of bad minded persons that wait for
offenses: Every one that professes, must know that he has many eyes on him,
that watch him narrowly, and some very badly minded, our duty is to take away
all matter of ill talk from them; as if the wood be taken away, the fire goes
out; and if the water run not, the Mill goes not: By well-doing we stop up
their mouths, as David did Saul's, and Daniel his accusers: Or if we cannot
stop their mouths, but that they will needs talk, yet that they may have no
just cause to speak ill of us, but though in general terms they make a railing,
yet being urged in particular to tell what we have done, or with what they can
chargeus, or what sin we live in, or what corruption we yield to, which we
strive not against, they may be driven to silence.

This rebukes the wonderful carelessness of some Christians, that walk so
losely, and lie so open, as the wicked have their will, even matter enough to
talk of their covetousness, of their wonderful impatience, and the like; such
had need to repent much, and by the contrary to labor by their well-doing to
stop their mouths, which they have justly opened against Religion and the
professors thereof: O how far are some to blame, who by too severe and sudden
censuring, cause many to loath the professors of the Word, as if they were all
such proud fellows, They are ignorant and foolish which speak ill of the Gospel
and the professors thereof.
and did condemn all but themselves: O its good to have charity, yet I mean not
that we are to call black white, etc.

The ignorance of foolish men.] Here is showed what they be that are ready to
rail and speak ill of Religion, and open their mouths against the Professors
of the Gospel, even ignorant foolish men.

Oh, Obj.
but many be great men for Wit, and Parts, and Learning, that do thus.

Its all one, R.
such they be, and no other; They that will rail at a Trade for the fault of a
Tradesman, and condemn all of a Trade, for the fault of some one of that
Profession, might they not be taxed of ignorance and folly? So what ignorance
and foolishness is it in a number to speak ill of the way of God, and of the
Word Preached, and of the Preachers thereof, and all for the fault of some that
profess Religion: Its true, that some speak evil of Gods people, not of
ignorance, but of hatred and contempt of the Gospel; A good life will stop all
cavils of the former, not of these.

Ignorance] Whosoever speaks ill of God, of his Truth, of his Servants that
profess his Name, are ignorant, know not what they do, as our Savior said of
them that Crucified him; Luke 23. 34.
As the Sadduces, They err, Matt. 22. 29.
not knowing the Scriptures: John 8. 19.
Had the Pharisees known the Father, they would not have hated and persecuted
Christ the Son; Had the Jews known, 1 Cor. 2. 8.
They would not have Crucified the Lord of glory: When men rail on Gods people,
O they know not what they say, nor whom they despise, for if they knew them,
and whose they be, and their great Glory and Dignity, they would catch them
about the neck, and earnestly desire that they may be like unto them! But they
know them not; one brings Religion thus complaining, I Religion am a mere
stranger in the world, therefore I do not wonder that the Dogs of this world do
bark at me, which I do not greatly regard, my Pedigree, my Father, my Brother,
my Country is above, yet I wish that while I stay among you, you would not
speak evil of me, because you know me not: And assuredly if men knew
Christianity and the revenues thereof, they would not only not speak evil
thereof, but all the good they could; yet this is not simple, but affected
ignorance, therefore their judgment will be the more just and fearful.

1. If therefore we hear any, Use 1.
whosoever they be (rich or poor) reproaching the way of Salvation, and calling
it preciseness, and niceness, and railing on the best Preachers, and most
zealous Christians, let us not be much troubled at it; Its but the speech of
ignorant men, that know not what they say; blind, that cannot judge of
colors, but through the darkness that is in them, they call good evil, and
evil good, who will one day see otherwise, though it may be when it will be too
late.

2. While any is of this mind (let him be what he will be, Use 2.
have what knowledge he will or can have) he is but an ignorant man, that
speaks and does he knows not what, and walks in darkness, and knows not how
soon he may fall.

Foolish men.] Every natural man is a fool.
Every natural man as long as he so continues, is but a fool, even till God
the fountain of all true wisdom, do give him his Spirit of grace into his
heart, and make him wise unto Salvation, whose fear is the beginning of wisdom:
Let men have wit to rule a Country, to compound Controversies, contrive
businesses, and to be so deeply fighted in the world, as no man can go beyond
them, yet if they be in their natural and unregenerate condition, they are
fools, the greatest fools that are; such is Solomon's fool throughout the
Proverbs, not he that wants wit, but true wisdom; nor one that wants natural
parts, Reasons.
but grace: For, is not he a fool that prefers toys and bables, before matters
of great and good worth? such are they that are careful for the world, for
Profits, Pleasures, Honors, and such transitory toys, never regarding what
shall become of their souls, having no care of the pardon of their sins, to
escape from Hell, and to obtain the Kingdom of Heaven; Luke 12. 20.
such was the rich man in the Gospel: Were not he a fool, that in the Summer
would neglect to prepare his Winter provision, as having then no use thereof?
such is he that has no care in the Summer of the Gospel, and in the time of
his health, to lay up against the stormy time of sickness, temptations and
death: Is not he a fool that runs on in the score, and takes no care to
discharge it? such are they that go on in sin, and in the abuse of Gods
creatures: 1 Pet. 4. 4.
Is not he a fool that will wallow himself in mire, and think and speak ill of
them that will not so do? such are the wicked that wallow in their sins, even
wondering that others run not with them into the same excess of riot: A fool
will play with firebrands, arrows, and mortal things, so the wicked make a
sport of sin: He is a fool that being condemned of Treason, and yet in
possibility to get a pardon, defers to sue for it till it be too late; such are
the wicked that put off their repentance: He is a fool that will laugh, being
in extreme danger, or being told he is going to execution, does jest at it,
yea, if it were but to the stocks, or house of correction; yet thus do the
wicked every day go nearer and nearer the place of their torment: A fool hates
those that tell him he is in danger, and would help him out of it, and can
sleep soundly, though it be told him the house is on fire over his head; yet
thus do the wicked, being told of their sins, and their danger thereby.

Thus are we to repute our selves, Use.
being unregenerate, and to labor by all means for the fear God, which is the
beginning of true wisdom.

Verse 16. As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness,
but as the servants of God.
HEre the Apostle prevents an Objection that they might make, The prevention of
an Objection.
whereby he would cure the disease they were sick of, even their not yielding
subjection willingly; and that both in respect of their badness which ruled,
and of their own liberty, which they misconstrued and stretched beyond the
bounds: We be freed (might they say) by Jesus Christ, therefore we know no
Reason we should be subject to them: He answers, you are free indeed, I
confess, Christ has purchased, and that dearly, a happy and blessed freedom
for you, but this (as every other good thing) may be abused and stretched
beyond the reach thereof, as you do this; for its not such a freedom as sets
you at liberty to do what you list, or to shake off Government, and live at
your pleasure, and which is not to be used as a cloak of naughtiness and carnal
liberty, but you must use it, as those that be freed from sin and the Devil,
but not from God and your obedience to him, but to be his servants, and so to
obey him, as in all things, so in this amongst the rest, even in obeying
Magistracy, which is one of his Commandments.

Here three things are considerable; The particulars laid down in this verse.
1. The liberty of Christians, As free. 2. The abuse of Christian liberty, not
using your liberty as a cloak of maliciousness. 3. The right use of it, but as
the servants of God; all needful to be known, that in a right manner we may use
our Christian liberty to the glory of God, our own good, and the benefit of our
brethren.

As free,] Naturally we are in bondage
Freedom presupposes bondage: By nature we are all bound till we be freed
through Christ.

1. We are all guilty of Adams sin, Reas. 1.
born in Original sin, infinitely defiled with actual rebellions, whereby we
stand under the wrath and curse of God, and all evils in this world, and that
which is to come for ever: There is no curse in all the Scripture threatened or
executed, or any other that God has in his infinite storehouse, whereunto we
are not liable and daily subject: God is just, and no whit of this can be
called back; a fearful condition.

2. We are all the very vassals of Satan, Reas. 2.
and slaves of sin, taken prisoners of him in the fall, and we have no power of
Soul, nor part of body, but are all fast bound to his will, our understanding
darkness it self, our will altogether averse and rebellious to that that is
good, carried forcibly to all evil, as are also our affections and other parts.
Romans 6. 17.
The Devil holds us, as a Captain does his Castle, naturally he rules in our
hearts at his pleasure, Ephesians. 2. 2.
till through Christ we be delivered out of this power of darkness: Col. 3. 13.
He is the strong man that keeps the house, till a stronger then he comes,
which is Christ alone: We have no power to think a good thought, to stir a
finger in any good, though about the matter of our Salvation; Romans 8. 7.
Our wisdom is enmity against God, All our thoughts are only evil continually:
Genesis 6. 5.
Its as impossible for a natural man to do any good, as for a bramble to bear
grapes or figs; nay, which is worse, and makes up our bondage, we cannot see we
be in this case, believe when we be told it, desire to come out of it, as being
weary thereof; nay, we delight in it, think it the only liberty, spend body,
goods, name, soul, and all in the service of it, the basest master, and most
cruel, the basest work, and most woeful wages, and this yet is worst, that we
like of it, and liberty being offered, we loath it. No vassal among the Turks
that has been there never so long, but yet retains a free mind, he would be
gone if he might or could tell how; but such are not we, we have no desire from
Satan or sin; our bondage being thus made known unto us, we are a little the
fitter to listen to the freedom here spoken of, we being in this most woeful
bondage, John 8. 36.
God of his infinite mercy found out a way, a strange way to free us, Gal. 5. 1.
and that was by Jesus Christ, who has procured our liberty and makes us free.

This is called Christian liberty, Believers are made free by Christ.
because its purchased by Christ for Christians, namely Believers, and no
others: Its a Spiritual and holy freedom, not Civil, such as the Jews looked
for (even great advancement in an earthly Kingdom) or the Anabaptists dream of,
which shake off Magistracy; nor Carnal, such as that of the Libertines, which
live as they list in all silthiness; Wherein Christian liberty consists.
and procured it is by Christ alone, no other could do it: It stands in these
four things, 1. Through Christ we are freed from the wrath and curse of God,
and all the punishment 1 Pet. 1. 19.
having redeemed us, and became also a curse for us: Isa. 53. 4, etc.
He was arraigned before a worldly Judge, Gal. 3. 13.
that we might not be arraigned before the Judge of the whole world; He was
condemned, that we might be absolved; He dyed, that we might live; He has
become our surety, and so freed us from the wrath and justice of God, and his
payment was most royal, because he was God, and by his Resurrection he declared
that it was full and perfect; Romans 8. 1.
So that now to all that believe in him, there is no condemnation: It has
nothing to do with them; for though God be just, and will have it once paid,
yet not unjust to require it twice. 2. We are freed from the service of Sin
Zacheus, the Jailer, and Mary Magdalene quite altered from that they were
before: So among our selves, through Gods goodness, they that understood
nothing to purpose, are now enlightened and ashamed of themselves in respect of
their former conversation, hate their sins and old companions, and are turned
to love God, and to delight in his Word, Saints, Prayer, good Duties, have
tongues that cannot now speak for their liyes as before, but are ready to speak
gracious words, which before they could not; Isa. 32. 3, 4. and 35. 4, 5.
and where before they were lame to any good, now they are active, and can
find their legs now to carry them to goodness; but we are only thus freed in
part: we cannot do what we would, and as we would, and oftentimes also we do
also what we would not, yet shall we draw virtue from God by his Spirit in the
daily use of the Word, Sacraments, and Prayer, to be more and more freed
therefrom, till at last we shall attain the same, even perfect freedom Gal. 3.
24.
4. We are freed from the Ceremonial See Gal. 5. 1.
in all things indifferent, as meats, drinks, days, and the like, which were
rudiments serving for the minority of the Church: Col. 2. 16.
There is now no indifferent thing we are bound in for Religions sake, or from
which we are to abstain for conscience sake; much more are we freed from all
men's Traditions, which serve not to bind the conscience, wherewith
notwithstanding the Church of Rome endeavoreth to hold people in base and
deadly bondage (as the Scribes and Pharisees of old) and that for Conscience
and Religions sake: The Kingdom of God is not meat nor drink, Romans 14. 17.
neither if we eat are we the more acceptable, or if we eat not, the less.

1. This is a wonderful consolation to every Christian; Use 1.
whosoever can prove themselves Believers, they are the only happy persons in the
world, they only are free: Art thou such a one? be of good comfort, there is no
condemnation to thee; though thou have been stung with sin, yet seeing thou
have had grace to look up to Christ Jesus, thou art cured, Christ has dyed for
thee, thou shall not perish, but have life everlasting, Who shall lay any thing
to thy charge? Christ has paid thy debt to the uttermost farthing; when
therefore the conscience of thy sin troubles thee, with the danger thereof, and
the Devil pursues thee with temptations, O then look up to thy Surety, stick
to him, he has perfectly discharged thee! Though there be a Hell wide and
large, and the burning thereof as it were fire and much wood, which the breath
of the Lord as a River of Brimstone does kindle, and wherein thou have deserved
to have thy portion, yet there thou shall not come, Christ has given a
discharge for every one that believes in him: Thou art humbled, the Spirit of
God bears witness to thine, that thou art Gods, and thou find in thy self
the fruits of faith; be of good comfort, God can as soon deny himself, as that
thou shall perish: O what cause have we to thank God for Christ Jesus, and all
the means whereby we came to faith, and to be Christians! we can have no curse
in this world (crosses for good, are no curses) death shall do us no hurt, yea
turn to our especial good: Art thou a Believer? then art thou no longer the
Servant of sin, to be at the command, and follow it in the lusts thereof;
though thou can not do as thou would, yet having thine understanding
enlightened, thy will and affections reformed, and thine heart changed, etc.
thou have a blessed freedom, a pledge indeed of that perfect freedom thou shall
have in Heaven; yet labor every day to be more freed from the bondage of thy
corruption, and set at liberty to serve God; And is it not a wonderful comfort,
that we may offer up Spiritual Sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus
Christ? and that we are enabled in some measure to do the will of God, and that
with delight; and that our works, though imperfect and done in weakness, yet
being done in Truth are accepted of God, Psalm. 103. 13.
who has compassion on us, as a father on his son: He that is indeed a true
Believer, is the only free person in the world, so free as nothing can make
him otherwise; let him be bound with sickness, with poverty, with imprisonment,
let him be tied hand and foot, let him be chained about the neck to a prison
wall, etc. yet is he free; free from sin and damnation, free from the bondage
of the Devil, is a conqueror over temptations, has a free mind to serve God,
and even then with Paul and Silas, and the three children, can sing and laud
his name: O praise God for this, walk thankfully and joyfully, love the word,
and search it, where these blessed prerogatives and privileges be enrolled:
Its a great fault we rejoice no more herein, especially considering the price
that our freedom cost.

2. For them that cannot prove themselves Believers; Use 2.
O let them labor to have a part in this freedom. Acts 22. 28.
Rome had great privileges, therefore many sought and that with great sums to
be free of it: When the Jews were freed from Hamans conspiracy, Ester 8. 17.
and had the Kings favor, many become Jews; O so, me thinks, many should desire
to become Christians, that they may partake of this freedom, which is more to
be desired then the whole world: Till you be freed by Christ, you are in woeful
bondage; John 8. 36.
When the Son shall make you free, then shall you be free indeed, till which
time you are bound indeed, and that in a fearful manner; the curse of God
follows you whithersoever you go or ride; you go not over a style, but you may
break your neck; get up on your horses, but you may receive some deadly blows
to send you to Hell; take tools in your hands, but you may mischief your selves
thereby, you may be swallowed up as Korah, drowned as Pharaoh, burnt with fire
from Heaven as Nadab and Abihu, eat up with worms as Herod: Being unbelievers,
you have no warrant to the contrary, every minute you hang over the pit of
Hell, for whom it gapeth: You are also slaves of the Devil, at his command, and
do base work for a woeful master, whose wages will be accordingly: But this the
world will not believe, they dream not of Spiritual bondage, neither consider
that their hearts are fast locked in unbelief; were they sensible hereof, they
would seek by all means to be rid of the same, they would be afraid even to
sleep this night, lest Hell should catch them ere they awoke, lest their souls
should be fetched from them being in this condition: O never be quiet till you
know your selves freed by Christ; to this end humble your selves, confess your
deadly bondage, bewail it to God, cry for pardon, rest not till you receive a
gracious answer; never leave waiting on God in his Word, and craving his
Spirit, till he change your hearts, and make you free, whence will spring peace
of Conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost: What are Riches, Wit, Civility, yea
the gifts of Knowledge, Utterance, and hearing of the Word with joy, and the
like, without this? This is to be known by Faith especially; But how do most
content themselves to hold the hope of Heaven by sleight conceits of their own,
rather then seek by sound arguments from the Word to be assured thereof? Is not
this fearful? Its time for us to awaken our selves, and to ransack our
Evidences; weak holds will vanish when strong temptations come: (...) 16. 16.
O get we the shield of Faith, which will quench all the fiery darts of the
Devil: He is such an adversary, that we had need be thoroughly armed, being to
encounter with him.

And not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness,] Here Is the abuse of
Christian liberty: They were freed indeed, but he would not they should stretch
their liberty further then was mere, or abuse it any way as a cloak and cover
for any licentiousness or naughtiness whatsoever. Here note, That

Through the evil heart and corrupt nature of man, Through man's corrupt nature
even the most holy Ordinances of God, and best things are subject to be abused.
not only the creatures of God, but even his holy Ordinances, and the very
best things are subject to be abused: The Gospel was foolishness to the world,
and Christ Jesus himself a stone whereat many did stumble: Thus the Doctrine of
Predestination, many turn to a desperate course of doing what they list: The
Doctrine of Gods great mercy most take as an emboldening to sin; so is the
Doctrine of Justification by Faith only, and of Christian liberty abused unto
licentiousness: Even the Apostles writings were by some wrested to their own
condemnation. 2 Pet. 2. 16.


1. Seeing our nature is so apt to abuse such things, Use 1.
it behooves the Ministers of God to pray to God for wisdom, that they may
deliver wisely and warily as all points of Doctrine, so especially those that
are most apt to be abused: They must so handle the Doctrine of Gods judgments
against the wicked, that the godly humble be not dismayed; and so comfort the
godly, that the wicked be not emboldened, but each have his portion that is due
to him.

2. This rebukes as in general all such as shall thus abuse any holy things of
God, Use 2.
so in particular all abusers of Christian liberty, whether such as turn it
into carnal licentiousness (as the Familists and Libertines, and too too many
in this Land, in solemnizing the Feast of our Saviors Nativity) or such as turn
it into civil liberty, and freedom from civil subjection, Acts 1. 6.
as of old the Jews (which looked for earthly privileges and immunities by
Christ) and of late the Anabaptists: How many hearing that we are freed by
Christ from the rigor of the Law, make no more account of it, as though a
believer freed from the curse and rigor of it, were not yet under it while he
lives? How many make Religion a cloak for their naughtiness and whoredoms,
being very diligent at Sermons, and outwardly very devout, that they might be
the less suspected? as the Scribes and Pharisees, which devoured widows houses,
Mat. 23. 14.
and under color made long prayers? How many hearing that the Ceremonial Law
is abrogated by Christ, will not therefore read any part thereof; nay scarce
any of the Old Testament, shaking off the Testimonies cited out of it,
ignorantly saying, O the old Law is abolished. How many now hearing that we be
not under the bondage of any thing indifferent, rush out into all excessive and
vile abuse of the same, without keeping any bounds, or going by any rule? They
will eat and drink excessively at all times, wear what apparel they list,
without respect of their degree for the matter of it, or the fashion for the
manner: So for recreations, they dare run unto those that be unlawful, and use
those that be lawful without all bounds of moderation.

But of the use of things indifferent, Three restrainers of things indifferent.
there be three restrainers, Gods Words, The Laws of Magistrates, and the rule
of Charity: Gods Word, where are rules whereby to guide us in the use of things
indifferent, as that they be decent, of good report, done to edifying, used in
sobriety and modestly, tend to the glory of God; and to make us fitter for
duties.

The Laws of Magistrates, whether Civil or Ecclesiastical; for if they command
in things indifferent, and be so in their use also as well as their nature, and
be according to the rules of the Word, then they are by the Magistrates
commandment made necessary, Acts 15. 28.
as for abstinence from flesh not for Religion, but civil respects: So if they
forbid men to wear silk upon some special causes, or to hunt within such a
compass; these were before indifferent, but now necessary.

The rule of charity; we must not use indifferent things to the offense of our
weak brother, Romans 14. 13, 15, 19.
or to cause him stumble, or hinder him any way in the course of his Salvation:
Indeed for obstinate ones that will not be persuaded, Romans 15. 2.
we are not bound to respect them; 1 Cor. 10. 28.
as Paul, that was content for the week Jews to circumcise Timothy, Acts 16. 3.
would not after, Gal. 2. 3.
because of their obstinacy, consent that Titus should be circumcised.

Our Christian liberty is an holy thing, precious indeed and dear: O let us not
abuse it, let us not suffer our selves to be entangled again with sin, or the
works of the Devil, and fashions of the world, from which Christ has freed us!
Neither let us suffer our selves to be made the Servants of men, 1 Cor. 7. 23.
or to be brought into subjection of men's Traditions, or the superstitious use
of things indifferent (as the Papists thus hold poor people in bondage) it cost
Christ a dear price to purchase our freedom: Col. 2. 16.
Contrarily, Gal. 5. 1.
Take heed we abuse it not to wantonness and licentiousness, but use it to the
glory of God, our own good, and the benefit of our Brother: Remember we also,
that our freedom by Christ does not exempt us from subjection to Magistrates:
Christian liberty, and civil subjection may well stand together; 1 Cor. 7. 25.
Even Christ himself and his Apostles were subject unto the higher powers,
neither has he purchased liberty for any to do hurt, or cross his Fathers
order.

But as the servants of God.] Here Is the right use of Christian liberty, we
must use it as Gods servants, that are freed from sin to serve him in obedience
to all his commandments, and this of subjection among the rest.

A Christian though he be free, A Christian though free, yet is still a Servant.
yet is he a Servant still; He is freed from Sin, Hell, Damnation, and the
Devil, to serve the Lord of Heaven and Earth; an happy service, a most blessed
change: A Christian is of all others the most free, Luke 1. 74.
and yet the greatest Servant: The greatest Christian, Romans 6. 22.
the greatest Servant; He that will be greatest, let him be servant of all: We
must serve God in the duties of his worship both privately and publicly, and
that zealously, and we must serve men to the good of their souls and bodies, by
Admonition, Exhortation, Consolation, Example, and Prayer: This is no bondage,
but the happiest liberty that may be; Comfort and joy accompanies this service
for the present, whereof the end will be life everlasting: Not to serve thus,
but to be under the service of sin, is of all others the basest bondage.

As therefore we would serve the Lord with all our might, Use.
and shake off all tediousness and wearisomness that comes upon us in the
performance of any duties, whether private or public, and would zealously and
cheerfully run the way of his commandments, do we consider our freedom (who
were sometimes the lackies of the Devil) from what, and by what price are we
freed; let us remember what service we have done for sin in the days of our
vanity, and now as much, or rather more for the Lord; we thought it no burden
to sin all day long, and must not now to be godly all the day long; we have
forgotten our meat for play, and yet thought the time short; yea, have sat up
whole Nights at Cards and Dice, and have spent a good part of our Goods, and
taken great pains to do evil, and should it now be irksome unto us to serve the
Lord? far be it from us.

Verse 17. Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the King.
THis Verse consists of four Branches; whereof the former two concern the
duties which we owe each to other, which following upon that which we are to
perform toward Magistrates, implies this much; That

To reverence and obey our Governors is not sufficient, They are good Subjects
which not only obey their Magistrates, but live well one with another.
no not to make us good subjects, except we also live well one with another;
for as the members both of the Natural and Spiritual body are not only coupled
and joined to the head, but also each to other, so accordingly are we in duty
bound to both: Not only do Children obey their Parents, Servants their
Masters, and Subjects their Governors, but they must also live orderly and
respectively between themselves one with another: Prove. 14. 28.
He that does not thus, cannot be a good Subject; He that shall deal
injuriously with his fellow subjects, wrongeth his Prince (whose welfare
depends on the multitude and flourishing state of his Subjects) whether it be
in body, goods, name or life; he wrongeth his Prince, I say, if the party whom
he harmeth be but an ordinary man, much more if he be a true Christian, being
therefore one of his best Subjects.

This therefore condemns all such as will stand in awe of Magistrates, Use.
and keep out of their hands, but for others, they care not how much they wrong
them; How will some profane desperate wretches of brazen faces, by their songs
and lying Libels misuse both rich and poor, Ministers or others, which cross
them in their vile courses? And are there not others close fisted (like the
rich man in the Gospel) that will be careful to keep out of danger of the
Magistrate, Luke 12. 20.
and do their duties to them, but despise all others; partly blessing
themselves in this; that they live of no body, are beholding to none, have no
need of any, and partly of a base mind, only seeking themselves, and
regarding no body else, oppressing and griping whomsoever they catch? Neither
of these be either good Christians or good Subjects.

Honor all men.] See 1 Cor. 12. 26.
That is, have regard, and give due respect unto all (whether they be Jews or
Gentiles, 1 Pet. 3. 7.
good or bad) according to their places, and that which is lovely, and to be
regarded in them; contrary hereunto, is contempt, which (as a thing not to be
endured) we are to avoid by all means.

Touching those whom we ought to honor, We are to honor.
they may be considered both as they are to us, and as they are in themselves:
As they are to us, they are either Superiors, Equals, or Inferiors, all which
we are to honor, yea our very selves also.

Our Superiors, Our Superiors in six particulars.
whether in Wealth, Wisdom, Years: This we must show in these and the like
particulars, 1. To rise up before them. 2. When they are coming toward us,
Lev. 19. 32.
to go and meet them, as Abraham did the three Angels, Genesis 18. 2.
and Solomon rose to meet Bathsheba. 1 Kings 2. 19.
3. To bow, Genesis 23. 7.
as Abraham to the children of Heth, and the rich man to our Savior Christ.
Mark 10. 17.
4. To give them the highest seat or place if we sit, Luke 14. 8.
or the wall and the right hand if we walk: Genesis 43. 33.
Joseph's brethren sat down according to their age. Job. 32. 4.
5. To give them liberty to speak in the first place: Thus did Elihu, 1 Pet. 3.
6.
we must not be full of words in the company of our Superiors. 6. To give
titles of reverence that we owe to them; so did Sarah to Abraham, 1 Samuel 1. 15.
Calling him Lord; Matthew. 19. 16.
as Hanna did to Eli, and the young man in the Gospel coming to our Savior
Christ, called him, Good Master: Romans 13. 7.
We must give every man his due, honor to whom honor belongs.

Our Equals: One equals in two particulars.
1. In esteeming them better then our selves, without contention or vain glory:
This is indeed one of the hardest things in the world, Phil. 2. 3.
because of the pride that is naturally in us, but if we look for this grace of
humility, it may be obtained, even by seeing others virtues and our own
frailties and infirmities, we shall come to this in truth, esteeming others
better then our selves. 2. We must in giving honor go one before another; Romans
12. 10.
modesty is a great cherisher of love, neither is there a more deadly poison to
peace and agreement, nor greater mean to stir up contention and hatred, then
when any shall think themselves despised: What a folly and madness is it in
numbers that so strive for seats and places, or that sometimes they cannot
contain even in the public and holy place, to justle for the wall, or the
way? What deadly hatred arises between many about such things, that they can
never be reconciled? Alas, This is not the way to honor, as which flies
further from those that do most run after it: If in modesty we would yield,
rather then contend, either our adversaries would yield to us, or if not, yet
the wise would commend us, and disallow them.

Our Inferiors; Our Inferiors, and why.
we must without all contempt, in meekness of Spirit respect them as Brethren,
as our own flesh; one God made them and us, and of one mold and matter, they
may belong to God, and be heirs of glory as well as we. Besides, as the meanest
member of the body could not be spared, so could not we be without them; they
toil, dig, delve, card, spin, etc. Thus will they do their duty the more
cheerfully, and bear the place of their Inferiority, when they shall see
themselves, though mean, yet not despised, which else might occasion in them
discontent and impatience, and increase their burden, which they do already
think to be heavy enough; we must be so far from being harsh, cruel, or strange
to them, as that we ought to hear them speak, and regard their counsel; if they
be persons of understanding and good carriage, as often as the Lord-will, let
an Inferior see that which the Superior does not, that the one may regard the
other: 2 King. 5. 13.
Naaman the Syrian hearkened to the counsel of his Servant to his great good;
Job 31. 13.
neither did Job despise the cause of his Servants, when they contended with
him: True it is, Superiors are not to lose the places God has set them in,
neither are bound to set up their Inferiors in them, yet are they to use them
kindly and with respect.

Yea, Our selves.
a man is bound to honor himself, for he is the workmanship of God, he may not
therefore defile or abuse himself at his pleasure: He must therefore keep his
hands free from cruelty and oppression, his tongue from lying, swearing,
railing, mocking, as his whole body from evil and filthiness: 1 Thessalonians. 4. 4.
Its Gods will that we should possess our vessels in holiness and honor, we
must not disgrace or deface the work of the Lord; Rev. 21. 27.
they that thus do, shall not enter into Heaven, for no unclean thing shall
come there: And as we desire to procure honor unto our selves, we must labor in
all things to honor God, and in all our doings aim at his glory; them that thus
do, God will honor: Contrarily, they that seek themselves, and not God, in that
that they do, living even openly to his dishonor, and not regarding at all to
glorify him, disgrace and shame shall be cast on them; the honor they seek
flies furthest from them, yea, such have often fearful and shameful ends:
Dishonoring God, he dishonoreth them; and as we are to labor to be approved of
God, Heb. 11. 2.
so also to have good report in the Church of God; Prove. 10. 7. and 22. 1.
for a good name is greatly to be respected, is of much worth, and an especial
blessing of God. Thus as men are to us.

As they are in themselves, they are either good o^ bad, both which we are to
honor: We are to honor both good and bad according to their places.
Honor all men (says the Apostle) good, bad, Jews, Gentiles, Believers,
Unbelievers, Regenerate, Unregenerate, Christians, Pagans, etc. for the good
there is no doubt, and that is to be spoken of in the next Exhortation, but the
doubt and difficulty is of the bad, how and why we must honor them: We must
have a good respect to all, Even in them that are most bad, there is something
to be regarded.
though not to all alike; and there are none so bad, but there is something in
them to be regarded, some scratch of Gods image; if ancient men, an image of
Gods eternity, reverence that, and speak to them as to aged men; if wealthy, an
image of Gods infinite abundance; if wise to manage matters of the world,
reverence Gods wisdom; if a Father or Master, an image of Gods Fatherhood and
Authority: Besides, they have many active parts of good use, for Peace or War,
by Sea and Land, are skilful in the Tongues, in Arts and Sciences, are Civil,
Kind, Courteous, Pitiful, and the like; for every of which we are to honor
them, to reverence them, to give them their due, Romans 12. 18.
so much as in us lies living peaceably with them: In their prosperity we must
use them friendly in all points of Neighborhood, Lending, Borrowing,
Commercing, Dealing Justly and Righteously with them, to bring them to the love
of Religion; in their adversity we must be helpful to them; if hungry, give
them meat; if thirsty, drink; if naked, raiment; at all times give them a good
example, pray for them, and give them their due for any thing that is in them,
James 3. 16.
that they may see themselves regarded, not despised, and so keep peace,
holding out contention, which is the floodgate of all evil: Thus dealing well
with them, and walking wisely toward them, we may bring them in time to a
liking and love of Religion.

1. Therefore for Christians, Use 1.
let them not reject men altogether whom they see to be bad, but give them
their due, we know not what good may come by our amiable and wise carriage
toward them; but if we shall despise them, we do thereby harden them against
us and Religion too.

2. For them that be yet carnal, Use 2.
let them labor for grace, which deserves true and large honor: If God will
have you regarded for your natural parts, how will both he himself honor you,
and cause you also to be honored of others, having grace? ye see Christians use
you kindly and respectively for your common and natural gifts, O how should
they embrace you, if they saw the lively image of God in you?

Love the Brotherhood.] More especially he now teaches our duties to godly
men, to the true servants of God: These we must embrace with an entire and
hearty affection; we must love all, and do good unto all, but especially unto
the Brotherhood; brotherly kindeness, which is a very natural and entire inward
affection, is due to the children of God. Speak we first of love to their
persons, then to their fellowship and Company.

For their persons; We are to love the persons of Gods children
We must love them with a more then ordinary affection: The more lively we
observe Gods image to be in any, the more we must love such; 1 Thessalonians. 4. 10.
others we are not bound to love with the like affections: Psalm. 16. 3. and 101.
Those did David love, in such did he delight, a fit pattern for our imitation.
We must love such,

Creatures theirs, they live under the hope of eternal glory, the world was made
for them, and abides for their sakes: If a man saw the honor of a Christian and
Child of God, he would fall down before him, and kiss the ground he stands on.

as that of all persons they cannot away with them, but mock them, as Ishmael
did Isaac, and Michol, David, but rail on them as Shimei, tell Tales of them as
Doeg, persecute them as Saul, seek to entrap them, as the Scribes, Pharisees,
and Herodians, yea and like Judas betray them; of this sort all places are
full, neither is there any so base in a Town, or so ignorant that he cannot say
the Lords-Prayer, but he can mock and rail on them that make conscience of
their ways; yea, the Devil is such a cunning Schoolmaster, as that though we
can beat nothing into some men's heads they be so blockish, yet the Devil can
teach them to be very expert to jest at them that fear God; and this has ever
been the fashion of the world: They hate men for their goodness, and the better
they be, the worse they like them; whom whilst they were profane, companions
with them in disorder, they were the only men with them, Why were Abel, David,
our Savior himself hated, but for their goodness? If they pretend that they
mislike them, and speak against them for this or that fault, its but for a
color, for why then do they like and nourish the same things in themselves,
and those like themselves? Neither can such things be found in Gods people, as
are daily palpable in them and their companions; Its therefore because the
light of the godlies good conversation discovers their ill deeds, which (were
the others like them) would not be seen, or taken knowledge of: O the fearful
condition of such! If he shall dwell in Gods Tabernacle, Psalm. 15. 4.
in whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he honoreth them that fear the
Lord, where shall they dwell that honor vile persons, 1 John 3. 10, 14.
and contemn them that fear the Lord? Such (...) not of God, are not translated
from death unto life: As Ishmael was cast out of the Church, God will for ever
Excommunicate all ou^ of Heaven, that continue to be Enemies to his people:
Though ye have no mind to be as they are, yet misuse them not, for he that
loves them and will take their part, is mighty, and has been revenged of
Kings for their sakes: But if you will be wise indeed, labor to be such, who
are therefore set up, either that you should follow them, or else that they
should be your Judges, as Noah in condemning the old world: If you will needs
continue to despise them, yet know that the time shall come, when you shall
desire to be as they, but it shall be far from you: Happily even in this life,
when you shall be visited with sickness, Number. 23. 10.
or in some other extremity and misery, you may with Balaam wish this; but
howsoever, on the great and terrible day of Judgment, when they shall stand on
the right hand, and you on the left, they be received up into everlasting
glory, your selves cast out into eternal torments, you would be glad hereof:
But you must not think to be as Dives in this world, and as Lazarus in the
world to come: O then, love ye the grace of God, wheresoever ye see it, and the
people of God, though never so poor and mean, yea, more then them that are in
gold Chains without grace! Show your inward affection toward them, by
rejoicing in their welfare, grieving at the contrary, living peaceably with
them, doing them all the good you can, or they stand in need of, whether in
soul or body.

Gods people; Is not this monstrous wrong to Christ, to pull one member from
another? and is it not a great distemper, when one member of the body will hurt
another? O that these days of peace should produce such an effect! If God
should send days of trouble, we would be glad one of another: O that wicked
pride and covetousness (the main causes hereof) or any thing else in this world
should be of such force, as to sever those whom God by his Spirit has joined
together! Thus of their persons.

For their fellowship and company; This follows upon the former, for that which
we love, we desire as much to enjoy as may be, as the Husband the Wives
company, and she his; so Parents their Children, one Friend another: They
therefore love not the people of God (whatsoever they say or pretend) that care
not for their company.

But whose fellowship are we to love? We are to love the fellowship not of the
ungodlies.
The Brethrens, even the people of God; we are to honor all, even bad men, but
are not to have society or keep company with such: Enter not into the way of
the wicked ( says Solomon) and walk not into the way of evil men: Prove. 4. 14.

Their company is like an east wind, to blast the tender plant of the grace of

Solomon the wisest man, yet was wonderfully carried away and defiled thus; and
David with being a little among the Philistines, learned to dissemble, making
as if he had been willing to fight against his own people; Peter being but a
while in the high Priests Hall, fell foully; Lot having sojourned in Sodom, did
so far forget himself, as that he proffered his two daughters to be lain with,
and they learned to be monstrous unshamefast; 2 King 8. 27.
Ahaziah did evil in the sight of the Lord (says the Text) like the house of
Ahab for he was the son in Law of the house of Ahab: He was unequally yoked,

This rebukes the monstrous wickedness of our times, Use.
wherein there are none so bad, but others will keep company and join with them
in all kinds of Societies; yea, oftentimes even Professors will match their
children with such, especially if they be wealthy; but what a woeful yoke is it
to have an honest or well minded person, or one of good towardness, to be yoked
with one of an ungodly and vile life, one that is both loose in manners, and
corrupt in judgment, whether Atheist, Papist, or any other? So men care not
where they dwell, nor with what Neighbors, if the ground like them, and it be
for their profit: Our young Gentlemen are scarce complete, if they go not over
to Italy to learn some of Machiavels villainy; A number of our Merchants care
not where they buy or trade, so it be for gain, though they live amongst all
Gods enemies, and often defile themselves with bowing their knee to Baal: Many
care not how vile Servants they have, so they do their work, which yet proves
oftentimes the poisoning of their Children: Most are for all companies; if
good, so it is, they will frame themselves accordingly; if bad, they are also
for them: This is the cause of so much overflowing and overspreading evil in
the world, for one infects another; O how many Youths of good towardness,
falling into vile company, have been spoiled! How loath are we that our
Children should look asquint, or be deformed? Ill company will quickly make
them look quite awry from God; therefore says David, Psalm. 119. 115.
Depart from me ye wicked, for I will keep the commandments of the Lord. As we
love our selves, as we would escape the Judgment of God upon us, such as Pain,
Sickness, Poverty, and such like here, with everlasting Torments hereafter,
keep we our selves far from the wicked, depart we from them in whom we see not
the lips of knowledge. If we be to choose our dwellings, do not we dwell in
Mesech, Psalm. 120. 5.
as we would not cry with the Psalmist, Woe is me, etc. If already we dwell in
such places, yet be we watchful over the pollutions there, lest we be defiled:
Happily the wicked will hereupon tax us for pride; but better it is that they
should speak ill of us falsely, then that God should hate and punish us justly:

frequent the company of Gods people: David made choice of such; Acts 10. 7.
so Cornelius, even of such as did fear the Lord: We must love to have
fellowship with them both publicly (in hearing the Word, joining together in
Prayer for a blessing thereon, and offering up the sweet perfume of
Thanksgiving; where thousands have found such comfort and refreshing, as they
would not give for a world) and privately, conferring one with another,
Admonishing, Exhorting, Edifying, Comforting and Encouraging one another; Thus
we shall strengthen and confirm one another (for he that walks with the wise,
Prove. 13. 20.

(considering our dullness and weakness) we have great need; Thus we may open our
temptations one to another, and accordingly receive both comfort and counsel.
The wicked meet to strengthen one another in evil, hereby making others twofold
more the children of the Devil then themselves; and should not we be as wise in
our generation? Oh! How many have cause to thank God highly for good company,
by whom, upon the discovery of their temptations, they have received both
comfort and strength? by whom (being formerly much daunted by Reproaches, and
other harsh measure used against them for their Profession) they have been
notably heartened; yea, even the wicked themselves have been the better for
good company, as Joash whilst Jehoiada lived, and the Sodomites whilst Let
was amongst them: Two are better then one, and as iron sharpeneth iron, so good
company proves beneficial unto such as make use of the same.

but an Antichristian company, having neither Sacraments, nor Ministers: But we
have not only a true, but a worthy Church, that maintain all Principles of
true Religion as soundly, as any Church in the world, as in our Articles of
Religion appears. We have also Ministers inwardly called of God, with
competency of gifts, and graced of him by the fruit of their labors, in the
Conversion of thousands of souls, which is a good seal of their Ministry from
Heaven; and if these have any good in them, where had they it, but from those
Ministers, and that Church from which they now separate, and on which they most
unchristianly rail as Antichristian? to whom our Church may say indeed, Give me
that which you have had of me, and then go your ways, and see what will become
of you: What an ungracious part were it in a Son (if being grown to some years,
and able to shift for himself) he should turn, and miscalling his Father, spit
on his face, calling also his Mother Harlot and Whore, and then running away
from them, when he should show his thankfulness to them? No less ungracious are
these men.

2. It rebukes those profane ones, Use 2.
that cannot abide the company of Gods people, think an hour there as long as a
day elsewhere, account such a Family a prison, wherein there is reading the Word,
Catechizing, Prayer, and the like duties; yea, when they should be in the house
of God, they will be at home, or in some Alehouse, or walking abroad in the
Fields, or loytering in the Churchyard; or if they come, its to no purpose, as
being against their minds: such straglers are in danger of the Devil, out of
Gods protection, and may fall into any evil; What blind beasts be these, that
count that a prison, that is comfort and joy, true and sweet liberty? Well, if
they will not walk with them while they live, their end shall not be like
theirs; severed in life, severed in death.

But what? have they no company then? Yes, to swagger, swill, swear, game, and
to all manner of disorder, as well on the Lord's Day, as other times: There Is a
great deal of such fellowship in this Land, falsely called good fellowship;
indeed hellish fellowship, whereof not God, but the Devil is the Author, and
Master of the meeting; little brotherly fellowship, except it be as Simeon and
Levi, brethren in evil: O the drunken fellowship of these times! Some are mad
and beastly drunkards, Isa. 5* 22.
others (to whom there is also a woe) strong to pour in strong drink, glorying in
making others drunk, but their glory is to their shame, and their end will be
damnation. How few Gentlemen's houses can you come to, wherein its not the glory
of Serving-men to make those drunk whom they can get into the Cellar, and
thereupon rejoice? Poor woeful Creatures, that little think, that for this they
shall one day come to Judgment, and their jollity be requited with everlasting
torments in Hell: If they must answer for every idle word, and for such
pleasures (though in themselves not unlawful) wherein they have regarded
neither time, place, person, measure, nor end, how much more for their wicked
companionship, in Swearing, Blaspheming, filthy talking, Profaning the
Lord's Day, and the like? Such would one day give the whole world, if they had
it, for one hour to repent, but in vain: They now treasure up wrath to
themselves, and as they now delight in evil company, so shall it be said unto
them, Go ye cursed of my Father, etc. There, there shall they enjoy their
company in whom they have so much delighted, but to their further Torment.

3. It rebukes a mavelous fault in Christians, Use 3.
that so little regard one another, so seldom meet together, or when they do,
spend the time to small purpose, not edifying one another as they should do:
Some through Pride are so conceited of their parts, as if they did not stand in
need of any, as others think themselves too good to converse with any, and
others through covetousness, will not spare any time this way: But time was,
when Christians made much one of another, and often in simplicity and
plain-heartedness, met together to talk of good things, and to further and
strengthen one another, and then Religion prospered, and people grew in grace;
but now, though there be more knowledge, there is less zeal, and
true-heartedness, and this is the cause of the decay of goodness amongst
ancienter Christians; when the brands are pulled in sunder, and the heat
decays, the fire goes out: Welfare our younger Christians which cling together.
Beware, you that have been long professors, lest they that set out after you,
outstrip you, and go far before you, which many may see to your shame: O is it
not pitiful that when Christians meet, the time should be spent in worldly talk
without ne^d, or in vain idle frothy talk of News, or other folks matters, and
things of no edifying! This comes to pass sometimes through want of matter,
their hearts being barren of good things; sometimes for that their hearts and
minds are earthy, and delight not in those things: Hence it comes to pass
that Christians become the worse one for another company, not a few leaving an
ill example and savor behind them to the poisoning of others; this is hard in
Christians, let us strive by all means that this may be amended.

To this end these Rules are to be observed by Christians in their private
meetings:

families (except it be an extraordinary case of heaviness of mind, Rules to be

Fear God.] See hereof on verse 17. of the former Chapter.
This is the fountain whence as well the forementioned duties flow, as those
which follow, and all other must be performed: They must be such as will stand

depart from evil (every sin, the inward as well as the outward, secret sins as
well as open, such as might seem advantageous as well as others, unlike those
which will say thereof, Its naught indeed, and we should not do it, but flesh
and blood is frail, God help, and so living in it) To keep the Commandments

tremble at the Word, as also at his judgments: The want of this is the
floodgate of all Iniquity, Profaneness, Security, Hypocrisy, and hardness of
heart, utter. Enemies hereunto: This is the preserver of the heart against evil
and temptations, a main provoker unto that which is good; when we would yield
unto this or that temptation, commit this or that evil, slubber over this or
that duty, up starts the fear of God, and says, Nay, that must not be yielded
to; O the mavelous privileges and sweet promises annexed hereunto: Such as
fear God, need fear neither Hell, Death, Devil nor Judgment; they need not
fear Poverty, Sickness or Persecution, for either they shall not befall them,

or be sanctified to them: O how should we labor to increase herein, by
considering Gods greatness, and our base poverty, together with his justice
against sin throughout all ages? yea, considering his wonderful goodness in
himself to the Land, to our selves both for soul and body, who is not to fear
such a glorious, such a merciful God? but notwithstanding both of his mercies
and judgments plentifully manifested, who does truly fear him? There Is indeed
little fear of God in the world, in England, in most of our Towns; O the
fearful condition of such! they have cause to fear all things they see, as if
all did conspire their ruin, which also sometimes falls out, Deuteronomy. 28. 65, 66,
67.
as the Lord threatened by Moses: Were not people hardened, bold, nay desperate,
they would not thus shake off Gods fear; O let such haste out of this case! O
labor to get assurance of the pardon of your sins, and so turn to God, and walk
in his fear! Go not away hence to live loosly any more, as heretofore you have
done, but fear the great Lord of Heaven and earth, who is able to plague you
both in Body, Minds, Goods, Children, here and hereafter; rear him that has
made thee, fed thee, and kept thee out of Hell, and has been so good to thee
every way, yea, and will yet do more to thee if thou turn to him.

Honor the King.] The duties of the first and second Table accompany one
another.
For the coherence of these words with the former, Note we,

1. That the duties to God and our Neighbor, the duties of the first and second
Table, are to accompany one another; they must not be sundred, 1 John 4. 21.
God has knit them, and they must go together; He that loves God, must love
his brother also: The second is like the first; promises are annexed to the
performance of both, punishments threatened for the breach of either: He that
commands the one, enjoined also the other.

good-names; whatsoever such make, their Religion is vain: The Prophets cried
down such hypocrites in their times; there is now no less cause so to do: Let
men join both duties together, and justify the truth of the one by the other;
else as we commonly say, He that will swear, will lie; he that will lie, will
swear; he that makes no conscience of his duty toward his Neighbor, makes no
conscience of his toward God.

sure of their word, and kind neighbors, and yet make no conscience of the
duties of the first Table, regard not the Word, Sacraments, Prayer public or
private, the observation of the Lord's Day, and the like; O they delight not in
these, they savor not of such things: Howsoever the world count such right
honest men, yet is God little beholding to them; What though they give men
their due, if they defraud God of his? what though they steal not from men, if
they rob God of his Sabbaths and times of worship which he challenges as his,
converting the same to their private uses? Let the world think as well and as
highly of these as they will (wherein they do well, they are to be well thought
of) they are not such as can abide the trial of the Word, neither shall be able
to stand before God on the great day; but as they have sundered that which God
has coupled, so will he (if they repent not) sunder them for ever from his
Kingdom.

2. That the knowledge and fear of God is the fountain of all our duties to men
in their several places; The knowledge and fear of God is the fountain of all
the duties we perform toward men.
none can be a good servant indeed, a through good servant, one to be trusted
with business of weight, with hope of blessing and success (as Eleazer Abraham's
servant) but such a one as fears God; So (according to the Text) no man can
truly honor the King, and be an absolute good subject, except he fear God; no
man will honor him from his heart as he ought, nor obey him for conscience
sake, nor pay duties cheerfully, venture his life for him faithfully, and pray
for him heartily, but such as fear God: This is the only sure bridle (all
others of credit, fear, etc. will break) to keep people in duty; where this
has been wanting, there have been mutinies and risings, yea, what else can be
expected where this bears not sway? Genesis 10. 11.


1. Let all that fear God, Use 1.

especially of subjection to their Governors, that so they may bring the same in
esteem, and procure credit thereto.

2. Would any be good Subjects, Use 2.
let them begin at the right end, perform their duties in the right manner, even
for conscience sake, as being required of God: Thus shall the Prince be much
the better for them, and they themselves have comfort in the performance of the
same: Thus shall not they dare fail herein for fear of the highest, whereas
worldly men perform theirs merely for fear of men.

which do most fear God, and accordingly to use them kindly and countenance
them, as being indeed their most loyal Subjects; yea, to further the Gospel
what in them lies, whereby people may be brought to fear God, that so they may
prove true and loyal to themselves, and so add strength to the Kingdom: Thus
of the coherence.

For the words themselves, Honor the King, I have already spoken at large of
the duty contained herein: Know we only, that by the King here, is meant
Caesar, who was an Heathen Emperor, one that intruded himself, ruled
tyrannously, and was an Idolater; and by Honor, not Divine and Religious honor
(for that is due to God alone) but Civil worship and honor. Difference between
Religious and Civil honor.
The difference between those is not in the outward gesture of the body, or
bowing the knee, but in the intention of the mind; Divine is, when we bow both
knee and heart, and soul to God, and that for his own sake, as the Lord of
Heaven and Earth, and the Author of all good to us, to whom we pray when we
want it, and whom we praise as the Author of any mercy for soul or body: See
Mr. Perkins Cases of Consc. p. 357.
Civil, is when bowing the knee, yea and the affection of the mind to men, we
do it yet for the Lords sake, and as the Lords instruments, Mr. Allen on
Command. 5.
and whom he has set over us for good, as excelling us in gifts and graces, to
whom we present Supplications, as the instruments of God to convey many good
things to us, and accordingly render thanks for the same; yet must not we
attribute to them any thing proper to God, as Herod's and Nebuchadnezzars;
flatterers did, which the three* Children and Daniel refused. As our duties to
them must flow from the fear of God, so must the same Rule direct and square
them, so that they neither come too short, nor go too far.

Under this honor is understood, What honor comprehends.
the inward reverence in heart to be declared outwardly by obedience to all
their godly Commandments, cheerfulness in payments, prayer and thanksgiving,
etc.

Now if all this be due to a wicked King, If honor be due to the bad, how much
more to religious Kings?
as here, and now to be performed of us, if we had a wicked King, what then is
to be done of us to such a King as God has bestowed on us? a natural Prince,
and of our own Nation as it were, lineally descended of the ancient Kings of
our own Realm, and a Christian King, that maintains the Gospel, and sets
against Popery, a King honored of God with so rare gifts and virtues, with so
peaceable an entrance, and such an hopeful Posterity, etc. O do we honor him,
reverence him, be thankful for him, pray for him, cheerfully pay such Taxes and
Subsidies as shall be imposed on us (for the maintenance of his Royal Pomp and
Charge) to the encouragement of others.

Verse 18. Servants, be subject to your Masters with all fear, not only to the
good and gentle, but also to the froward.
NOw of the duties of another sort of Inferiors to another kind of Superiors,
namely, of Servants (all Servants, whether Menservants or Maidservants) to
their Masters (Dames and Mistresses too) they must be subject to them; that is,
not only content themselves with the place of Inferiority they are in, giving
them the place of their Superiority, but to perform all duties to them which
they may justly challenge, and that from a reverend respect of them and of
their place; and that not only if they be good and gentle (of the best
natures, and that use them well) but also if even they be froward, or such as
use them ill.

Before I come unto the words in particular, note we two or three generals:

1. The exactness and absoluteness of the Word of God, Gods Word teaches us in
all things how to carry our selves.
It teaches us in all things how to carry our selves: No man's place so mean,
no action so common (eating, drinking, sleeping, etc.) none so mean in the
meanest calling, but the Word reaches thereto, and gives direction therein;
Its a Schoolmaster, able to convince, teach, instruct, correct all; Its as an
Apothecaries shop thoroughly furnished; Its like a pure Fountain, that sends
water by pipes, not only into the chief rooms, but even into the meanest; It
does noth only instruct us in our duties toward God, but toward ^o our
Neighbors also, toward our Superiors, toward those that are set over us,
though in an inferior degree.

This teaches every man to search the Scriptures, Use.
and to labor to be acquainted therewith, and to make them their Counselors
and Guides, A light and lanthorn to their feet; They must also hear them opened
by Preaching, for their fuller understanding thereof: If any shall say, What
shall I do at Church? I am a poor Wench in the Kitchen, I am a poor Plow-boy,
its fit for my Master to go, etc. Know, that its fit and needful for thee also
so to do, not only because thou have a soul to save as well as thy Master, but
that thou may learn to become thy place, and do thy duty aright.

2. How Ministers ought to have a care of, Ministers must stoop to the lowest
and meanest of their charge.
and stoop to the lowest and meanest of their charge: The Apostle Paul, in the
midst of all his great businesses, travels and cares, yet in no Epistle lightly
forgets to teach Servants their duties toward their Masters, that so doing
their duty, they may adorn the Gospel. Thus does our Apostle here, and thus
must we do in our places. A faithful shepherd will not willingly lose any of
his sheep, but tender them all; and we must be so careful, Acts 20. 26.
as to be free from the blood of every one.

True it is, Masters must not turn this off themselves.
that Masters must not turn this off from themselves, and put it wholly on the
Ministers; but do their duty to the uttermost, pressing upon them at home what
they hear publicly taught, both which are little enough; yet must the
Ministers also speak to the understanding, and apply themselves to the capacity
of the meanest, accordingly taking care that they come not to the Sacrament
hand over head.

3. That not only the Church and Commonwealth, Even particular families are
to be well ordered and looked to.
but even particular families are to be well ordered and looked to, as from
whence will flow either good or ill: They that be good in their families, will
be good abroad in what place soever they be set; if the Master be godly at
home, he will be a good Parishioner, a good Subject, so their Children and
Servants? What Is the cause of so much disorder abroad every where? even for that
there be so few families in any good order and government. Thus in general.

Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, etc.] Here three things
are observable: 1. The duty to be performed. 2. The manner. 3. Toward whom;
where is the removal of a secret Objection, showing that Servants must be
subject even to them that use them hardly, and deal most injuriously with them.

Touching the duty to be p^rformed, Servants must be subject to their masters.
and the manner thereof, I have heretofore spoken at large, in handling the
fifth Commandment: It proceeds from that reverent respect which they have of
their Masters, See Ephesians. 6. 5.
and the parties set over them by God in his wise and merciful providence: Col.
3. 22.
If they do inwardly reverence them from their hearts, 1 Timothy 6. 1.
and see God in them, and the face and image of God in their face, they will
also outwardly declare the same by their obedience, faithfulness, care,
diligence, and the like.

1. This condemns the monstrous insolency of youth in these our days, Use 1.
which can abide no yoke of good Government, daily bewraying their want of
inward reverence, by the fruits thereof, in their countenances, gestures,
words, behavior, blazing abroad their Masters infirmities, and the like: How
many even of professors, set light by their Masters, vilifying their persons,
slighting their gifts, and use them basely, especially if they be poor?

2. Let Servants repent for this want of reverence, Use 2.
and know, whatsoever is done against their Masters, is against God himself,
whose Deputies their Masters are; yea let them amend this, and learn to
reverence their Masters, so shall they perform all the other duties they owe
them: have you failed: heretofore? make more conscience for the time to come,
and do your duties cheerfully without grudging; for your state is by far
better, then their's to whom the Apostle wrote (of whom many were bondmen and
slaves, whom their Masters might have almost used at their pleasures) or
their's now in other Countries, who besides their want of the means of
Salvation, live in woeful toil and misery: You have the means of Salvation, and
for the most part outwardly live but at too much liberty; your lots have fallen
in pleasant places, walk thankfully, obediently, and cheerfully.

3. Let such as are Masters and Mistresses of families, Use 3.
learn here what duties their Servants owe them, that they may the better
instruct them therein, and look for their performance thereof: And if they have
now ill, stubborn and unfaithful Servants, let them call to mind whether when
they themselves were Servants, they were not such, that so they may repent
thereof, in the mean time acknowledging Gods justice, in paying them in their
own coin, and deal with them, as they dealt with others.

4. For those that are yet young and in their Parents houses, Use 4.
let them mark these things, that when they shall go to service, they may not
be to learn their duties; but ready and apt therein, skilful in the several
branches thereof.

Not only to the good and gentle, The prevention of an objection.
but also to the froward.] These words are a comparison between Masters, or the
prevention of an Objection, that might quickly be made by some, to shift off
the foregoing Exhortation: I would be content to do my duty, if I had a good
Master, or served such a Master as some that I know; but my Master is so cursed,
that one cannot tell how to speak to him, and in correcting, cruel without all
reason, and that as well for no fault, as for a fault, yea, sometimes I am
beaten for well doing, and for my forwardness in serving God: Well, says the
Apostle, you must be subject, and do your duties in all points, even to such.

By good is meant liberal Masters (so indeed Masters ought to be to their
Servants, What we are to understand by good, gentle and Deuteronomy. 15. 13.
both while they be with them, and at their departure from them;) as by gentle,
such as care not what they do to them by Law, but what they may do in equity
and good conscience. By froward, Froward Masters.
are meant such Masters which will be pleased with nothing, 1 Samuel 25. 17.
to whom (such was Nabal) one cannot tell how to speak; yea such as will
afflict their Servants without cause, or color of cause. Whatsoever they are,
Servants must be subject even to their bad and froward Masters.
Servants must be subject to them, must reverence them from their hearts, must
obey them, serve them faithfully, and pray for them: They must thus do even to
the worst Masters, of the very worst conditions, God will have it to be so, and
they represent Gods person and place, Reasons.
though they are of such bad qualites: Hereby they shall show forth their
Christianity in a work of such difficulty (for to serve and do duty to good,
kind and courteous Masters, is no great mastery) which is indeed worthy of a
Christian: If they do not their duties to us, but be bad, we must not meddle
with it, God will call them to an account, we shall not answer for their sin,
but if we do not our duty, we sin also, and make our selves guilty; if in
humility and patience we do our duties, God will take our part in his good
time, as he did Jacobs, Genesis 31. 42.
who served a churlish, harsh, and covetous Master twenty years together: If we
do our duties, though they consider it not, nor deserve it, Col. 3. 24.
yet do we it to God, who accounts thereof, and before whom it shall not be
forgotten: Are they froward? Its the cross God has laid out for us in his
providence, which we must take up and bear; to shake it off by unlawful means,
were to resist the hand of God: It may be its greatly for our good, even to
tame and subdue our stout, sturdy, proud and rebellious nature; knotty logs
must have hard Beetles, and a rough horse, a rough rider. Besides, it may make
us fitter to govern others another day; for as none prove worse then those that
have been Cockneys, and have known no hardship, so they that have met with
much, will be the better to others, as having loathed it so much when it was
their case; yea, this may be a means in time to persuade the mind of such a
Master to a better course, and make his heart to smite him, 1 Samuel 24. 17.
when he sees his own unreasonableness, and his servants patience; as Saul,
who upon this ground acknowledged, that David was more righteous then he.

1. This rebukes the common sort of servants, Use 1.
which if they meet with a little hardship this way, murmr, shake off the
yoke, deal unfaithfully, or run away; What Is their plea? Oh, my Master is such
an unreasonable man, my Dame so unquiet, as that there is no living with them,
etc. Well, well, your Master or Dame is unreasonable, who shall be Judge? If a
number of servants (they are so lazy and illminded) that if their Masters do
but call them to good duties, rebuke them for their ill speeches, or for their
tarrying abroad at unseasonable times, and using bad company, few Masters but
will be counted unreasonable, and such as are not to be endured; yea, to be
held to their business, and kept in, with the licentious youths of these days
will be counted unreasonable: But grant they be somewhat unreasonable, see
whether you by your negligence, crossness, and unfaithfulness have not made
them so (as some do) if so, you can do little if you cannot bear what you have
deserved: But say they be unreasonable, and you have not deserved all you meet
with, yet for all that, its your duty to remember your place, you must not sin
for company; O who can do it? why, is God so unreasonable to require of you
that which cannot be done? best charge God with unreasonableness by and by:
True, its no easy matter, but servants must labor for grace, Phil. 4. 13.
that they may be able to say as Paul, I am able to do all things; But alas,
when we provoke servants to mind goodness, and to spend their time well, they
think this unreasonable; they work hard, and they must have their pleasure, and
they may be godly all in time, and so they be void of goodness: Hence arise
such stirs in families, which were there grace in servants, might be prevented:
Oh! no body can please them, say they; no careless body it may be, whereas a
little more then ordinary diligence and carefulness would please indeed. But
though servants must do their duties to such froward Masters, yet this is no
justification of them that be so, or encouragement toothers to be such; for
though their servants must put it up, God will be revenged of it, They have a
master in Heaven: If therefore they shall abridge them of their necessary food,
apparel or rest, hailing them to work beyond their strength, or shall curse and
ban them, shall beat them without cause, shall be cruel in their correction,
smiting them with what comes next to hand, throwing things at them to spoil
them; or if with things fitting, cruelly, unmercifully, and without measure,
not regarding the offense against God, nor the quality of the fault, not the
best way to bring them to amendment, but following the rage and fury of their
own hearts, God will call them to an account for the same: He forbids
cruelty against beasts, much more against those that are made according to his
own image: They were or are the children of others, though now your servants,
to whom being fatherless, you had need be the more merciful; and may not your
children also be servants: Do you to other men's children, as you would others
should deal with yours; are they not also your own flesh, and it may be as
dearly bought with the blood of Christ as your selves? Though you are to keep a
good strait hand over your servants, yet must it be with moderation.

2. If servants be bound thus to carry themselves toward bad Masters, Use 2.
how much more then to the good and gentle? to such as are careful of their
good every way, to such as give them good counsel, instruct them, bring them to
good duties, give them that is fit for them, teach them their trade, and govern
them with moderation? What shall we say then to the servants of our times, that
have such Masters and Dames, and yet be unfaithful, lazy and negligent? Where
shall these appear? assuredly, its no small favor to be under such Governors;
the times we live in are grown to a strange pass: In times past, about twenty
or thirty years ago, when the light, alas, was dim, what diligent and painful
servants were there, who would tarry at least seven or ten years in an house,
whereas now they are so unruly, that no house can hold them long? they find
fault for the most part when there is no cause: Formerly servants were careful
to please their Governors, and glad if they could and would accept of their
endeavors, and be pleased with them; but now, Masters and Dames are fain to
please their servants, if they can do any thing, they be so teachy and
masterly, as they may not be spoken to; belike the course of things must be
turned, the order of nature perverted, Masters must be as servants to please,
and servants as Masters to do what they list: Has God honored the servants of
these times with the Gospel denied to former ages, and do they thus requite
God, and profit by it? will it not be to their further condemnation? The
monstrous pride of youths is the cause of all this disorder; the peace and
plenty that God has given us, has so lift them up, as they have forgotten the
ancient simplicity and plainnefs that was heretofore, and have their minds so
high set, as their study is to prank up themselves brave, and get gay clothes,
to keep company, and have their swing; this they mind, and not their business:
If they thus continue, they shall never be worth a servant themselves, or else
shall be plagued with such as themselves were, nay, who knows whether for their
pride and unconscionableness, they may not come to rags, and a bit of bread?

3. Now what is here required of servants toward bad Masters, Use 3.
must also be performed by us to those we have any way to deal withal: Thus
Subjects are to do the duties of Subjects toward their Princes, though they
should be Tyrants, or deal hardly with them: Thus, though we live by neighbors
that be untoward and contentious, Romans 12. 18.
we must live quietly; Thus must husbands and wives live together; We must not
be overcome of evil, Romans 12. 21.
but overcome evil with goodness: God has no where bid us do to others, as
they do to us (that is the leaven of the Scribes and Pharisees) but to love our
enemies, Mat. 5. 43, 44.
and to do good to them that hate us, etc. yet must not this hearten any to be
bad, but every man must make his Neighbors yoke as easy as he can, not laying
too much upon him: They must not say (as some husbands to their wives) they
must do their duties to us, whatsoever we be: What! are you so cunning indeed?
know you so well other folks duties, and your own no better? you should know
your own duties best: How great then is their sin, that cannot live with good
Neighbors? How great that wives, that having a kind and careful husband, is
ever fretting, complaining and vexing him? How great that husbands, that having
a loving, dutiful, careful wife, does not use her kindly, but hoggishly, yea
it may be loves others better? He that cannot live with bad ones, and do his
duty, is scarce a good Christian; but he that cannot do his duty to good ones,
is not so good as an Heathen and a Publican.

Verse 19. For this is thank-worthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure
grief, suffering wrongfully.
NOw follow the Reasons to persuade to patient suffering of the hard dealing of
unconscionable Masters (and needful it was to use a great many Reasons to
persuade to such a duty, being so hard to nature, which accordingly he does) If
you do so, and do as you ought, you please God, and its acceptable to him (as
the word is translated in the following verse;) for being referred to God, we
can do nothing thank-worthy to God (when we have done all, we are unprofitable
servants) but we may do that which by Jesus Christ may be acceptable to him.
This is the first Reason: Whence may be noted, That

To enforce the performance of any duty how difficult soever, To be incited to
the performance of any duty, its necessary to know that its pleasing to God.
this is enough, that its pleasing to God, that is to be looked at of us in all
our life and actions.

Hereby the Apostle exhorts Children to perform their duties to their Parents,
as all to do good, and to distribute: What Tenant would not be glad to do that
which will please his Landlord, Col. 3. 20.
or a Subject that which will please his Prince? Heb. 13. 16.
And should not we readily do such things as will please God, yea, if it should
be to the laying down of our lives? Is not he the Sovereign Lord of the whole
world, that made us and all things? Has not he (as he is most holy, pure, and
good in himself) been admirably merciful to us? Is not his will a right will?
Is he not pleased with that which is good? Does any thing displease him but
sin? Should we not do that which is pleasing to him, though difficult? Should
we not fly from that which displeases him, though we might get thousands by
it? If we please him, Heb. 12. 29.
has he not a Kingdom for us? If we displease him, is he not a consuming fire?

Oh! Use.
this may make us hang down our heads, that we are no more careful to please
such a great and good God. Alas! if a thing have any difficulty, we pass it
off, though the doing thereof would please God never so well: Oh! why do we not
pray oftener, and with better affection? why hear we not the Word more
diligently? why are we not more heavenly minded, more patient, more liberal?
would not God be pleased herewith? and is there any thing better becoming us,
then to please God with all our might? Has he not made us? and chosen us to
life before the world? given his Son to dye for us, and save us? given us his
Gospel and Spirit? has prepared a Kingdom for us, and will we not please him?
yea, if a thing stand with our profit, though we know it will displease him,
can we be content to do it? O that we should offend so good a God, and so
merciful a Father as he has been unto us! O do we endeavor to please him,
whosoever be thereat displeased, whatsoever we lose, or whatsoever trouble we
bring upon us! But, O the monstrous course of this world, that of all things
cannot abide what pleases God! that so live, as if God had nothing to do with
them, as if they were neither in his debt nor danger, as if they were not
afraid of them, or he could do them no hurt. Are you not woeful creatures that
thus abuse God? Are you not in his debt? Who gave you these Bodies and Souls?
who fashioned them? whence was it that you were not Toads, Monsters, mad
persons, and fools? who has maintained your lives? who has kept you, that you
have not been ere this consumed, or are not now in hell? Art thou not in his
debt, who has let thee live under the Gospel, the means of saving thee, denied
to most of the world? Should you not then please him? Art thou not in his
danger? Cannot he make the earth to swallow thee, the worms to eat thee up? Can
he not smite thee with an incurable disease in thy bowels? Can he not strike
thee with madness, cast thee upon thy bed, and there forsake thee, and give
thee up to a desperate mind? Is he not able to send thee to Hell ere night?
Can he not make every joint of thy body, every tooth of thy head so to torment
thee, that thou shall be weary of thy life? Can thou promise thy meat shall
nourish thee, or that when thou lie down thou shall have one wink of sleep,
for pain of body or vexation of mind, or shall ever rise again? When there is
the greatest hope of fruit, cannot he in one night by a Frost destroy it all?
Do we not stand at his courtesy for every shower of Rain, for the Bread we
eat, and every thing else? and should we not then please him? If he smile on
us, whose frown need we regard? If he frown, whose smiles can do us good? Who
can stand before him when he is angry? He rendeth the rocks, and makes the
mountains to tremble: O that any through fear, or to procure the favor of any,
or for any other by-respects, should displease him!

For this is thank-worthy, or acceptable,] Whence note, that

The actions of Gods Children, The actions of Gods Children, when pleasing to
God.
done as they ought and may be done, are pleasing to God; howsoever, they are
not (as the Papists from this and the like places affirm) Meritorious: They are
pleasing to God, as being done by such as are justified by Faith in Christ, the
weaknesses of their actions being covered in his Death and Obedience.

1. This is a great comfort unto all such as can prove themselves Gods

and strive to do their duty in the best manner they can; though the same be

greater joy, comfort and encouragement unto any duty can be wished?

2. This may be a terror to all that cannot prove themselves justified persons;
Use 2.
they never did that thing throughout their whole lives that pleased God: A
carnal man can no more make a good action, then a Painter or Carver can make a
living man. The actions of unregenerate men want a soul. Till a man's person

cannot but displease him; Even the sacrifice and prayer of the wicked, Prove.

is abomination before him: What joy can a man have, when being old and full of
years, he cannot truly approve that ever he spoke, thought, or did that which
was good: Did men believe this, they would endeavor with all speed to come out
of their unregenerate condition.

If a man for conscience toward God endure grief, Why servants must do
their-duties to unconscionable Masters.
etc.] Here he shows the manner how servants must do their duty to such
unconscionable Masters, even for conscience toward God, because God so
requires the same; for if servants should bear quietly with such a Master, and
do their duty, because they know no remedy, know not how to help themselves, or
know, that though he be wondrous hasty and boisterous, yet to them that can
bear with him, and let him alone, he will be good and bountiful; whosoever do their
duties, I say, for such respects, please not God, neither shall have any reward
with him: what we do for conscience toward God, See Ioh. 6. 26.
is pleasing to him, not otherwise; whosoever looks asquint at profit, pleasure,
honor, credit, favor of this or that man, or the like, is far from pleasing
God; whosoever does for conscience sake, See Isa. 38. 3.
may with comfort look up to God in life and in death.

This rebukes the common sort, Use.
which do many duties, and abstain from many sins, but not in a right manner;
for carnal and sinister respects, and not for conscience toward God: Such
hypocrites shall have their portion with the hypocrites.

Q. How may we know whether we do our duties for conscience sake, or not?

A. By these Notes: How we may know whether we do our duties in conscience.
1. If we make most conscience of the greatest things first, and then of less
in their place, and so of the greatest sins; for God hates greatest sins most,
as in D^^id, of whom its said, He walked in uprightness all his days, saving in
the matter of Uriah: He had other faults, rashness toward Nabal, pride in
numbering the people, Zibah, 1 King. 15. 5.
yet that against Uriah was the worst of all. Greatest sins rob God most of his
glory, do most disgrace the Gospel, make greatest wounds in our souls, procure
most numbness and hardness of heart, and greatest outward punishment; we must
make conscience of all, but especially of the greatest: Such as seem very
earnest against some small things, and make no account of greater, are
Hypocrites, Mat 23. 24.
like the Scribes and Pharisees which strained at a g^at, but swallowed a
Camel: Mat. 27. 6.
Such were the high Priests, they made conscience of putting the thirty pieces
of silver into the treasury, which Judas returned to them, but made no
conscience of putting Christ to death: They made Conscience of going to the
Common Hall, John 18. 28.
least they should be defiled, and made unfit for the Passover, who yet made no
conscience of shedding innocent blood.

So the Papists stands altogether upon meats, days, and such trifles of their
own devising, making no conscience of Gods great Commandments, of the 2, 3, 4,
etc. So many among our selves will speak very hardly of some small blemishes in
a Professor, and, Oh! is this agreeable to Gods Word? etc. who do yet live in
foul sins. Again, some one has deceived them or wronged them, and they can
speak very hardly against falsehood and ill dealing, who yet can see foul faults
in others (but such as have not touched them) and not speak against them at
all: Some make great account of their truth and honesty, and, Oh, they would
not deceive their Neighbor, nor carry away any thing out of his house, and why?
fie on it, has not God forbid it? who yet will rob the Lord of a great part of
his day, which he says is his: Some also make conscience to give their
Servants victuals enough, but make no conscience to give them any good
instruction, or to pray for them, and with them, etc. These things they ought
to have done, and not left the other undone. 2. If a man have a care of all
Gods Commandments, hate all sin, and do all good, always endeavoring to keep a
good conscience in all things: He has an ill conscience that nourishes any
sin; He that bears with himself in one sin, shuns none for conscience: Some are
very forward to the Word, Sacraments, good Company; ask why, Because, say they,
God requires the same; Isa. 1. 15.
but why follow they not their calling, pay every man his own, deal justly?
does not God require these also? He is an Hypocrite that does the former, but
makes no conscience of the latter: Contrarily, some follow their calling, pay
every man his own, etc. who yet robs God of his due and the times of worship,
Requires not the Lord as well these as those? Again, such a man dares not do
such and such a sin, rob, kill, steal, etc. Why? because of God and his Word,
who yet will swear, lie, rail, break the Sabbath, hate their Neighbors, etc.
Why? has not God as well forbid these as much kindeness to their Wives before
company, whereas he that makes conscience of his ways, is most kind in
private? So a man must make as much conscience of secret sins, as of open sins*
of private sins in a corner, of secret corruptions, pride, hypocrisy,
distrustful, impatient and lustful thoughts; so of wandering thoughts in Prayer,
and at the Word and Sacraments, and of worldly thoughts on the Lord's Day; He
must be grieved for them, pray against them. 5. If a man be not for a brunt,
but hold our constantly, and continue, David, Daniel, and the three Children,
though Princes both spoke, sat, and did against them; most part do contrarily:
Some make a show a little while, but quickly through love of the world, through
fear or favor fall away; as questionless if Religion should alter, most would
go with the strongest side, and many which now come to the Gospel, would as
readily go to Mass, yea, carry a faggot to burn them that now sit with them in
the same seats: These be they that know not the truth, that receive not the
love of the truth, that live as they list, and will not obey the truth.

Examine your selves by these Notes, Use.
and as you are to repent, and ask mercy and pardon for all that's past, even
your best actions, and the manner of your performance thereof, so for the time
to come do not any duty in Hypocrisy, but all for conscience unto Gods
Commandment.

Verse 20. For what glory is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye
shall take it patiently? but if when ye do well, and suffer for it, ye take it
patiently, this is acceptable with God.
THat which the Apostle said in the foregoing Verse, he does in this amplify
by the contrary; and then repeats in the end of this, that he said in that.

In the first clause, speak we first of suffering for faults, then of patient
suffering for the same.

For what glory is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, etc.] Here note,
That

All suffering is not commendable nor comfortable, Al suffering is not
commendable nor comfortable.
to suffer for faults is a shame and matter to hang the head, for all sin has
shame belonging thereto: Matthew. 5. 11, 12.
Therefore when our Savior says, Blessed are ye when men revile you, he
adds, for my names sake, and falsely; and Blessed are they that suffer
persecution, he adds, for righteousness sake: Whosoever suffers deservedly for
his faults, is herein a companion with the Devil and Reprobates, a companion of
the old world, Korah, Achan, Gehazi, etc. who were deservedly punished.

1. This condemns them that boast of their sufferings without cause; Use 1.
The Papists keep a book of Martyrs, executed here in England in the days of
our late Queen and King; Woeful Martyrs, the Devils Martyrs if they be any, like
those which be hanged with us every Assiz, for Murder and Robbery, and the
vilest things; they suffer for high Treason, for their bloody and devilish
conspiracies against their Prince and State: They might be ashamed of such, if
they were not devilishly impudent; its the cause, not the punishment, makes the
Martyr; and as one says, None can dye the death of a Martyr, but he that
beforehand has lived the life of a Christian; so did they never, they put to
death hundreds, yea thousands in former times, both here and in other
Countries, only for not yielding to their blasphemous lies, but not one of
these has suffered for Religion, but for their Treasonable facts; who if they
had suffered for their Religion, Note.
yet had been no Martyrs (for their Religion is lies) and it had not been for
Christ and the Gospels sake; and its possible for an Heretic to be as stubborn
and impudent in maintaining a lie, as the child of God can be constant in the
Truth, yea, to dye also for a lie, though not with the like comfort as the
other for the Truth.

2. Among our selves some will say, Use 2.
I think I have as many troubles as any body, and have been as ill spoken of;
but if it was for thy faults, thou have no cause to boast: Have thou got an ill
name for a Company keeper, for suspicion of uncleanness, for an oppressor, for
an unquiet man with thy wife, for a proud person, rash, censorious, idle, and
one that followest not thy calling (especially being a Professor) and hereof
causest the people of God to speak with grief, thou have cause to grieve and
shame for giving them such cause, who would gladly they had not the cause to
speak thus of thee: Yea, but the wicked speak ill of me, will thou say; But
why? If it be justly and deservedly, whosoever they be, that is no matter, more
shame that thou have discovered thy nakedness to the Chams of this world to
scoff at, and at the Gospel withal; fie upon it: Its too usual in these days,
Christians give too much cause of offense; howsoever, the wicked speak not thus
out of any hatred of the fault, but of ill will to the Gospel: 1 Pet. 4. 15.
O therefore take heed, let us not suffer as evil doers; look we so warily and
narrowly to our conversation, that if they should watch us as narrowly as the
Nobles did Daniel, Dan. 6. 5.
yet they might find nothing against us but in the cause of our God; yea,
might be enforced with Saul of David, 1 Samuel 24. 17.
to acknowledge our innocence: If they will needs speak ill of us, let it be
falsely, and for well-doing. If any should be smitten by Sea or Land traveling
on the Sabbath, On June 16. 1611. being the Lords day, there was such a
grievous tempest of wind, as cast away many Vessels at Sea, amongst others, one
Passage-boat toward Ipswich, with almost twenty persons; and on the 18. day
were thirty two persons trodden to death and bruised at a Play in Norwith.
or any lose their lives at a Play, no cause to rejoice, no comfort in it. Note
further, That

If there be no patience in suffering, Patience in suffering for faults, has
no reward with God.
but when its deserved, its counterfeit patience, and has no reward of God;
its in comparison nothing, its that which reason teaches; but to bear
patiently for well-doing, is a lesson for an high scholar: Howsoever, being
simply considered, its good and commendable; as for any being justly afflicted
or punished by God or man, Mic. 7. 9.
meekly to submit themselves, to confess their faults, Ier. 10. 19.
and be desirous to amend thereby: Aaron held his peace, Eli and Hezekiah were
submissive in theirs, See also Dan. 9. 7.
the Thief at the right hand acknowledged that he suffered deservedly: Neh. 9.
33.
Thus when Delinquents are punished by the Magistrate, people be rebuked of
their Ministers for their sin, servants and children are of their Masters and
Parents corrected for their faults, they must take it patiently, and learn to
amend.

But if it be no great matter, Use.
having done a fault, and then being punished justly, to bear it patiently; are
not those to be condemned which be impatient under deserved corrections? Rev.
16. 9.
Some being afflicted of God, fret, rage and boil, curse, blaspheme, run to
Witches, or use other unlawful means to get out: What a beast art thou? have
thou not deserved the same, and yet wilt not thou be patient? Is not this in
effect to say, What has the Lord to do to punish me? I have not deserved the
same; if I can get out of his fingers any way, I will not abide to be thus
used: thus take they the rod by the end, and pull it out of Gods hand; What do
those but desire there were no God to see them, or that hated sin, or that
would punish sin? Belike they would have God like, but he will be like himself,
who at the beginning joined punishment and sin together, and so will do to the
worlds end; you will not get any thing by resisting, by humble confession,
hearty Prayer, and promise of amending, you may. Again, there are others, who
being punished of the Magistrates for their faults, do as well curse and rage
against those their Rulers, as those that informed against them: Thus when
honest men tending the glory of God, and good of the places where they live,
knowing that Alehouses for the most part are Pest-houses, Devils houses,
Breeders of all mischief, Receptacles of the scum of the earth, and means to
increase the number of sinners, complain of such ryotous persons, as would
there keep Revel-rout, and endeavor to suppress the same; O how do drunkards
and such others, See Eccl. 8. 4, 5
the friends of sin, rage and fume? would not such wish that there were no Law
nor Magistrate to punish, but that all might do as the list? but this would
bring all to confusion: Are there not some also who being reproved by their
Ministers, fret and rail at them, 1 King 2. 20.
fall out with them, and with Ahab, account them for their Enemies? nay,
sometimes will sue them at Law to their utter undoing? And are there not also
such servants and children, which being corrected by their Governors, will
murmr or resist, or run away, a sign of a proud mind, of a lewd heart, and
far from grace: Such resist God, and shall receive to themselves condemnation;
they provoke the Lord to take the rod, nay scourge in his own hand, or give
them over into the hands of the Magistrates: whence it comes often to pass,
Prove. 29. 15.
that not a few despising the rod and correction, which gives life and wisdom,
have been whipped, burnt in the hand, imprisoned, yea hanged up, and that justly:
Thus daily too many seek their own ruin.

But if when ye do well, etc.] Here Is the praise of patient suffering for
well-doing: There Is a suffering wrongfully, and without cause, which yet
differs from that which is here laid down, namely, suffering for well-doing.

Suffering wrongfully, What it is to suffer wrongfully.
is when men are accused of that they are not guilty of, or are punished
without a fault, whether it be only in words, or proceed to deeds: David was
unjustly censured of his brother when he came to the camp, Hanna unjustly
censured of Eli, and John the Baptist of the Scribes and Pharisees; so
Mephibosheth, Naboth, and Stephen were wrongfully both slandered and punished.
Thus in these days days monstrous lies and slanders are raised, especially
against Christians and godly Ministers: Its an unrighteous world, calling the
best of Gods servants, Proud, Hypocrites, and laying vile things to their
charge, which they never deserved; as, that they are enemies to the State,
would put down Kings, etc. Hence sometimes men are punished by Magistrates
without cause, as also Children and Servants of their rash and inconsiderate
Parents and Masters. In this kind Papists are exceeding expert; what lies have
they spread of Luther, Calvin, Beza, Junius, and such others? And had their
horrible villainy in the Gunpowder Treason taken effect, the blame would have
been by them laid on the Puritans. But as God has at no time done wrong, but
judges the world with righteousness, giving every man according to his works;
so will he be revenged of them that wrong others: For them that sharply censure
others, let them know, that what measure they mete to others, it shall be
measured to them again. For Magistrates that punish any wrongfully, if it be
wittingly, they profane the sacred seat of Justice, and what in them lies make
God a wrong doer: for nothing should be there done, but as God would; and lest
they should fail of ignorance or through negligence, with Job, Job 29. 16.
they must search out the matter diligently: For slanderers that devise lies of
men, Prove. 10. 10. and 25. 18.
they are fools; they are a Hammer, a Sword, and sharp Arrow; they are like the
Devil, who both slandred God to Adam and Eve, Rev. 12. 10.
and Job to God, and to this day is the accuser of the Brethren: Such shall not
be established on Earth, Psalm. 140. 11. and 15. 3.
neither shall they come into Heaven, no place fit for them but Hell; yea, not
only the devisers, but spreaders of Lies (so common a thing) is fearful. Thou
shall not walk about with tales among thy people, Lev. 19. 16.
says God by Moses: The receivers also of a false report are excluded out of
Heaven, Psalm. 15. 3.
and they that love lies. Rev. 22. 15.


Oh! let none wrong their Neighbors any manner of way, Magistrates, Informers,
or whosoever; Let none devise or spread abroad lies, no nor truths to their
Neighbors discredit, without a calling: But alas, what more common (all folks
talk) then to talk of other folks matters, and many times of their faults, not
at all of any good that is in them. We must not rashly believe what we hear
against any, especially having before given good testimony of their goodness;
yea, as we would have God deal with us and ours, we must not wrong any, do
right even to our poorest servant.

For them that suffer wrongfully, What those must do that suffer wrongfully.
its their duty to behave themselves patiently, looking up to God (as David did
when Shimei railed) not fretting, or raging, or saying (as its usual) It would
never have grieved me, if it had been so; rather say, It grieves me much less,
because it is not so; I thank God for the same, it might have been, if God had
not kept me; it was of him, and not for any goodness in me, more then in
others; I Will bear it patiently, for though I have not deserved it of men, yet of
God I have, even to be made a threshold for all to tread on, and a byword; and
though I have not deserved it of men in this, yet in some other things I have;
I have been faulty toward my Neighbors good name, and now its come home to me,
I pray God I may make a good use of it. Besides, it may be the Lord sees I
might have fallen into that or some other sin, and has sent this to prevent it
(preventing Physic is good) blessed be his Name, or he does it to keep me
humble, etc. Thus God, that brought light out of darkness, teaches us how to
bring good out of evil: Thus we may make use of a slander. Neither must we
think, that because it is wrongul, we may fret and rage, and make a stir, and
rail (so should we make our selves guilty, who were innocent before) but may
open our innocence, and clear our selves, as Job; yea, if it should concern us
nearly, but especially the Gospel, then may we have recourse to the Magistrate
for redress. Thus of suffering wrongfully.

Touching suffering for well-doing, Its common to Gods people to suffer for
weldoing.
Abel, Isaas, Joseph, Micaiah, are pregnant Examples hereof: So David met with
enemies, because he followed goodness; so our Savior Christ, so suffered the
Prophets, John 7. 7.
Apostles, Martyrs: Thus many at this day, even for their goodness they are
hated, 1 Pet. 4. 3.
and the better they be, the worse they are hated; John 17. 14.
They are not of the world, and the world hates them: As sore eyes cannot
abide the Sun, so cannot the ill lives and consciences of worldlings, who
wallow in their works of darkness, abide the light of Gods Word, or the good
conversation of godly men; it makes their wickedness the more seen, and they
must mislike either themselves or the others; but themselves you are sure they
will not, nay, so wretchedly minded are they, as to hate those that they know
not, but as they have heard of their goodness, and rail on them; and its pity
they live, or are suffered, will they say, who notwithstanding, if they were
put to it, were unable to say one word justly against them. By this time the
Gospel ought to have been so beloved, as that all that have showed any good
countenauce thereto, should have been the better thought of; but now (Oh
fearful!) that's become a Reproach which should be every man's glory, Oh, you are
a Professor of the Word, etc!

For those that thus hate men for their goodness, How fearful their condition
is that are hated of others for their goodness.
its as dreadful a sign as can be: They be like the Devil, are in darkness,
shall not enter into Heaven; they are of Cains generation, and Ishmaels brood.
God loves men because of goodness, and the Angels rejoice at a sinners
conversion; but these hate them for their goodness, and so are unlike unto God.
If such as give but a cup of cold water unto a disciple, in the name of a
disciple, shall not lose his reward, shall not they be extremely punished which
mock and despise them, which hate and persecute them, and that for their
goodness? They that do the least wrong to them in that respect, or eo nomine,
shall not go unpunished: For they that will smite with the tongue now, would
with the fist if they might, yea carry to the Prison, and to the Stake, if
times would give leave: Well, let them know, the persecutors reward belongs
to them, and how has God from time to time dealt with such? The examples of
Cain, Ishmael, Ahab, Jezabel, Herod, etc. witness the same. Besides, when they
would be glad to have part with the Children of God, they shall be banished,
and have their portion with Devils and Reprobates, and that in a fearful manner:
For if they shall stand on the left hand, Mat. 25. 42.
and hear that dreadful sentence, Go ye cursed, etc. that have not given them
meat and drink, etc. What shall become of them, and what place shall they have
in Hell, that take away their meat and drink, that cast them into Prison, and
do there deal cruelly with them? The Papists are notable in this kind, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 6.
who have even been drunk with the blood of the saints: God will recompense
tribulation to them that thus trouble his.

For those that are hated and punished for well-doing, Such as are hated for
well-doing must bear the same patiently
let them learn to bear the same patiently; Its not without Gods will, that
hereby they might give glory to him, and a seal to his truth: We must not
flinch away when trouble comes, as many and most have done, and so save
themselves whole, and leave Christ and his cause to shift for it self; the
world count them fools that will suffer any thing for his cause, and themselves
wise that can carry themselves so as they will be for all assays; but Moses was
not of that mind, He chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
Heb. 11. 24.
then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season: These will prove fools at
last, that for a few days of short life in pleasures and profits transitory,
have sold away their part in that which is eternal: John 12. 25.
For he that saves his life, shall lose it, and they which deny Christ before
men, them will he deny before his heavenly Father.

When we suffer for well doing, we must not suffer frettingly, with raging
against them, and with ill speaking, as it were with revenging our selves, but
in meekness commend our selves, and the cause to God: Its a fault in some
Christians that being hated at some hands for their profession, and forwardness
(and yet some need not be so much if they would walk more wisely and
discreetly) they then fall to taunting of them again, and calling them by^
names, and thus use this carnal weapon of the world; this becomes not
Christians: what would they do if they should suffer great matters? The Martyrs
gave no ill language, Christ and Steven prayed for their Enemies, we must
(abating our ranco^) imitate them: neither must we write bitter and enveighing
things against them in a carnal, scoffing or railing manner, as Martin
Mar-Prelate; but behave our selves patiently, yea joyfully, we are Gods
witnesses, an high honor, few called thereto: Is not the Gospel the truth? Is
not the Word of God the only true Religion? Acts 5. 41.
we must then testify the same to the world, Romans 5. 2.
and set our seal to it, yea to dye for it: O its a great advancement, 1 Thessalonians.
1. 6.
and so have Gods children acknowledged it! Phil. 1. 29.
Its a token of Salvation to them that thus suffer, Mat. 5. 12.
Great is their reward in heaven: Rev. 6. 9.
The souls of them that are slain, lie under the altar: The holy Martyrs went
singing to the stake, and thought that there they were as in a sweet bed of
roses; and St. Paul boasted of his Chain, and of the marks of the Lord Jesus.

Verse 21. For even hereunto were we called: because Christ also suffered for
us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his steps.
FOr even hereunto were ye called:] God has ordained his to undergo troubles
in this world.
Another Reason taken from the Ordinance and wise disposition of the Lord, who
has so ordained that all his shall suffer troubles, therefore we are to look
for them, and bear them patiently: Acts 14. 22.
Through many afflictions we must enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, here in
this world we must undergo manifold troubles and sorrows: All Gods Servants
find the truth hereof (as the Patriarchs Prophets and Apostles did in their
days) less or more, Deuteronomy. 32. 15.
some one way, some another: God knows how ill we can bear prosperity, but
are ready to surfeit thereof, as Children do of sweetmeats: Who can long enjoy
prosperity, and not be the worse? David, that in all his troubles spent his
time so holily, and made many Psalms, in his prosperity foully forgot himself;
so Solomon: Standing waters gather mud; as the Israelites in their journey to
Canaan suffered much, so must we in this wilderness, before we come to Heaven;
thus is God pleased to exercise us for his own glory, and our good. Therefore

1. We must not think the worse of any, Use 1.
because of their afflictions, or conclude them to be bad men and hypocrites,
which was the fault of Jobs friends, and of the Disciples of Christ.

2. We must not think the better of our selves, Use 2.
for prosperity, God can afford the dogs the bones, the things of this world;
Of hated Esau came twelve Dukes; the fatness of the Earth, and the dew of
Heaven is but a Reprobates portion, the Legacy of Ishmael, nay, no worse sign
then to prosper in an ill course.

3. We must not dislike our selves for our afflictions; Use 3.
Its an argument of Gods love, Heb. 12. 6.
and not of his hatred, Whom he loves he chastens, and they are Bastards that
be without affliction; to have afflictions, and to profit thereby, is the sign
of an happy man.

4. We must prepare for afflictions, Use 4.
not dreaming for ease or continuance of Peace, but looking for troubles in
this valley of Tears; they are the better born, when they be looked for, and be
the more grievous, when they come unexpected: In the midst of prosperity, its
good to think of affliction, as in health, how we shall do if sore, or long
sickness, or pain come upon us; so in wealth, of poverty, whilst we enjoy our
liberties, of Imprisonment and banishment, yea, after our affliction we are to
look for another: If we be spared for a while, we must take it for an
advantage, and labor to be better prepared against it comes.

5. We must bear them patiently, Use 5.
as being of God: They come not only from him that has Sovereignty over us,
but from the hand of a merciful father for our good: They are far less then our
deserts, or then others have had, and we have many comforts mingled therewith.

6. We must bear them thankfully, Use 6.
as whereby we are furthered in holiness: Hereby we are was^ed and purged; the
Cross is physic, though not toothsom, Isa. 4. 4. and 27 9.
yet wholesome: We thank and reward the Physician for loathsome pills and potions,
that have even for the time made us sick at the heart, as being the means of
our recovery: Our fault is, that we look upon our troubles, not to the benefit
that comes thereby; our greatest losses are oftentimes our greatest gains.

7. We must bear them joyfully, Use 7.
in respect of the eternal happiness and immortal glory we shall be shortly
brought to: Because we look not at this end, we are so unwilling to undergo
troubles; as one that would go over a water without fear, must fasten his eyes
on the shore over against him, so must we in affliction fix our eyes on Heaven.

8. If the children of God get not to Heaven but through many sorrows, Use 8.
and are often so grievously afflicted in this life, 1 Pet. 4. 18.
what shall then become of the wicked and ungodly? Ier. 25. 29. and 49. 12.
Have those been chastened with rods, and shall not these be tormented with
scourges? Those have been afflicted for a time, that they might live for ever,
and not dye eternally; These shall perish eternally in Hell torments; If they
that serve God night and day with all carefulness, and are zealous in his
service, and yet are grieved that they can do no better, nor as they would,
what shall become of those that blaspheme him daily without ceasing, and their
grief is, that they cannot dishonor him more, and rejoice when they most
despite him.

More particularly and most specially in this place the Apostle means of
sufferings that are for well-doing, In this world the godly suffer for
well-doing.
and for a good conscience, of the men of this world: Hereunto has God called
us; He that will be his Disciple, Luke 9.
must take up his cross; 2 Timothy 3. 12.
All that will live godly in Christ Jesus, John 19. 33.
must suffer persecution; They shall be hated of all men for his name sake: In
the world we shall have trouble; If we be not of the world, the world will hate
us: This way has the Lord sanctified, as the way to glory, and herein have the
Prophets, Apostles and Martyrs gone before us. Reasons hereof.
Its impossible it should be otherwise, considering the implacable malice of
Satan, and of the seed of the Serpent; God also will have it so, 1. That his
true servants may be distinguished from They must needs be, 1 Cor. 11. 19.
that they which are approved, may be made manifest among us. 2. To confirm his
Truth, not in respect of it self, but of men, and to whet on others, as the
seed of the Church is the blood of the Martyrs. 3. To make a way for his
judgments on his enemies, Isa. 26. 16.
and make them bright. 6. To stir them up to every duty Romans 8. 29.


1. When we enter into the profession of Religion, Use 1.
we must beforehand sit down and cast up our accounts, what the same may cost
us* which if many had done, they had escaped the horrible sin and foul shame of
Apostasy: Most profess Religion in the time of peace, but when trouble comes,
they will be gone; one would sit at Christ's right hand, another at his left in
his Kingdom, but will not be batized with the baptism wherewith he is baptized,
neither with him will drink of the bitter cup of affliction: They will save
themselves from any hurt, yea, they think themselves wise persons that can
shift off sufferings, and them fools that suffer for the Truth; but they will
prove fools in the winding up.

2. When troubles come, bear we the same patiently and joyfully; Use 2.
we have the Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, and all the troop of Saints for our
companions: Phil. 1. 28.
To us its a sign of salvation, Mat. 5. 12.
and great is our reward in Heaven; 2 Thessalonians. 1. 6.
Its a righteous thing with God, to recompense tribulation to them that trouble
us; 2 Timothy 4. 7. 8.
And to us that are troubled, rest with him; When we have fought the good
fight, we shall enjoy a Crown of Glory.

Because Christ also suffered for us.] Another forcible Reason from Christ's
example, Christ's sufferings an incitement for us to suffer.
which was done also for our imitation: If Christ has suffered, why should not
we? If he that was God suffered at the hands of wretched men, how much more may
we men, of mortal men like our selves? If he for you, then good reason you
should suffer for him: That he did, was for a pattern for us to follow, and that
patiently as he did, his whole life was no other: Though our salvation come
cheap to us, and of Gods mere gift, yet it came not so to Christ, he paid full
dearly for it; Gods Justice, which would be satisfied, required the same: There
was an infinite wrath due for our sins, which Christ did undergo.

1. If Christ has suffered, Use 1.
are not we to pledge our Master? if the servants do but what their Master has
done before, they have no cause to complain.

2. If Christ the Son of God most holy suffered, Use 2.
is it such a matter for us poor miser sinners to suffer?

3. If he suffered for us his enemies, Use 3.
should not we be much more willing to suffer for him, and think our selves
happy, as who has delivered us from the everlasting sufferings in Hell, by his
suffering for us* and from reproachful sufferings that we might have had for
some foul offenses in this world, and has turned them into a few glorious
sufferings for his name.

4. Consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself,
Use 4.
lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds: Heb. 12. 3.
Consider who he was, and what thou art, and it will much take away the
bitterness of affliction.

For you] (so some read) even for servants, for the meanest, with him is no
respect of persons: Christ suffered even for the meanest.
No rich nor poor, bond nor free in Christ; the one have as good right as the
other, nay (though God have some of all) yet most of the mean are Christ's,
James 2. 5.
they receive the Gospel.

This may make the mean of the world to bear their condition the more
patiently, Use.
and comfortably; they have part in Christ if fault be not in themselves, and
may be heirs of grace: but for the most part, the poorest of all exclude
themselves, and I know not how, the hand of God goes out heavily against them.

Leaving us an example, etc.] We must not set Christ before us, and consider
him as a Mediator and Savior only, Christ a pattern for our imitation.
but as a pattern and example to follow, and that a most perfect one; we must
labor to imitate him, Matthew. 11. 28.
and if we belong to him, we must walk as he walked; we must thus think with
our selves when we are about any thing, 1 John 2. 6.
what would Christ Jesus do if he were in my clothes? So do thou and not
otherwise; so do in thy calling, in patience, forbearance, etc. And in a
doubtful case, ask what would Christ do in such a case? That may we know by the
rule of the word, for accordingly would he do; this is a good image of Christ,
better then Popish Pictures, and Crucifixes: Get we an image of Christ out of
the Gospel, and accordingly live we thereby, 2 Cor. 3. 18.
and be we more and more changed thereinto.

Verse 22. Who did no sin, neither wus guile found in his mouth.
THe example of Christ's sufferings is illustrated, An illustration of Christ's
sufferings.
1. By his innocence. 2. By his admirable patience: Innocence, that he had no
sin, no not so much as ever slipped in his tongue, and so was perfect: Now if he
had no sin, suffered patiently, much more should we that are sinful Creatures,
and do one way or other deserve a thousand times more then that we suffer: His
admirable patience set forth by that he suffered, and his bearing the same
sufferings in word and deed, where is showed both what he did not, and what he
did: He requited not only not ill words, with ill deeds, but not the worst
deeds that were done to him, with an ill word again, and he committed his cause
to God, knowing that he knew what was to be done, and would judge righteously
between him and them.

Who did no sin, Christ was free from sin.
etc.] He had no Original sin, but was conceived by the holy Ghost; 2 Cor. 5.
21.
The matter whereof he was framed, which he took of the Virgin was freed from
all spot of sin, 1 John 3. 5.
and filled with fullness of grace, yea from the first moment of his Conception,
was united into one Person with the divine nature: So did the Angel declare to
his Mother, Luke 1. 35.
That holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.

1. Then he suffered not for his own sins, Use 1.
as they wickedly imagined that put him to death, Isa. 53. 4.
as was foretold, but from ours altogether, which should make us loath our
selves, that put the innocent Son of God to such things, which we had justly
deserved: Oh! How should we hate sin, and love God and Christ Jesus for ever
and ever?

But how could it stand with Gods justice that he should suffer, Ob.
being every way innocent, and we which were guilty persons should go free?

Christ was an able surety to dye, and overcome death, and he was willing, R.
and the Father could not refuse one in our own nature to undertake for us to
satisfy his justice, and free us.

Here also we may see how we stand righteous before Almighty God, How the godly
stand righteous before God.
though we be not perfectly righteous, though not at all till we be sanctified,
and then but in part; How? even by the righteousness of Christ imputed to us,
and reckoned, and made ours by Faith, which is not an imaginary thing, as the
Papists scoff at it, but a true and real righteousness: for as Christ was no
sinner, yet was counted as a sinner, and being so accounted, bare the
intolerable weight of our sins; so we by his righteousness imputed, stand
verily and truly just before God, and shall be saved.

2. This should teach us to labor for innocence of life: Use 2.
The more means we have, and the more show we make, we must be the more careful
to walk warily, as they that have many observers; some that will be grieved if
we do ill, and many, as the Devil and the wicked, that will rejoice: Let the
forwardest Towns and persons take heed to themselves that they be innocent in
their example; you may do much good this way, else much hurt, look to your
selves, you are watched; and that narrowly.

3. If he suffered, Use 3.
and that patiently, who never offended God nor man, but was the most pure and
innocent Son of God, how much more should we, who never suffer, but our hearts
can tell us we have deserved the same, and ten thousand times more through our
sins against God? we have small cause to be impatient, but must submit our
selves hereto; yea, we have not only sinned against God, and so deserved all
evil, and that God should make us a Reproach, a Byword, a Scorn of men, and a
Threshold for all to tread on, but we have sinned against our Magistrates,
against our neighbors, yea against them that misuse us, whosoever they be, for
want of reverencing them, praying for them, doing our duties to them, not
carrying our selves so innocently toward them, nor so wisely, patiently, and
unblameably as we ought; so that though we deserve not to be thus dealt with
for this that we are punished for, yet in many other things we do: Submit we
our selves therefore in all humbleness of mind and patience: What, are we
sinful creatures too good to suffer, when as the Lord of all, and he that was
the Son of God did yet suffer?

Verse 23. Who when he was reviled, reviled not again, when he suffered, he
threatened not, but committed himself, to him that judges righteously.
Here Is our Saviors admirable patience, Christ's admirable patience in his
sufferings.
both in what he did not, and what he did; being reviled (and called a
Samaritan, a friend of Publicans and Sinners, a glutton, a wine bibber, yea,
said, that he had a Devil, that he was a blasphemer, that he cast out Devils
through Beelzebub the prince of Devils, that he was a deceiver, and an enemy to
Caesar; being, I say, thus reviled, and his Enemies having shot such arrows of
most vile, slanderous and cruel words against him, and such as might not only
raze the skin, but pierce him to the very heart, yet) he reviled not again, he
required them not like for like, thereby to be revenged of them. True it is, in
his public Ministry, he told them plainly of their sins, and called them
Blind guides and Hypocrites, and denounced Gods judgments against them, but
that was from conscience of his duty, and of love to win them to repentance, if
it might be, not upon spleen to revenge himself; as the Ministers of God may
rebuke sin severely, and denounce Gods judgments against them that live thus
and thus, and yet not out of any malice or ill will, but from an earnest desire
of their amendment, and therefore they do wickedly that call that railing; yea,
when they posted him from the place where they took him with swords and staves,
Matthew. 26. 57.
and brought him to Caiphas the high Priest, Luke 22. 66.
and then led him into their counsel; and then when they had bound him, they
led him away, and delivered him to Pontius Pilat the Governor; Matthew. 27. 2.
and from him he was sent to Herod by whom being mocked and set at naught, Luke
23. 7. 11.
he was sent again to Pilat; where he was mocked, smitten, scourged, and misused
beyond all measure, yet when he thus suffered, he threatened not; He could have
commanded fire (as Elias) to come down and consume them, or Legions of Angels
to destroy them; He could also have served them as Corah and his Company were
served, but he did patiently put up all.

Here Is a fit pattern for our imitation, Why we must not revenge.
we must take heed of revenge; The Heathens are accustomed hereunto, but
Christians must not be like to them: Romans 12.
This is often forbid; 1 Thessalonians. 4.
say not, I will do to him as he has done to me, Prove. 20. 22.
give word for word, taunt for taunt, blow for blow, etc. Gal. 5. 20.
For 1. This is a work of the flesh. 2. God has a hand in whatsoever is done
against thee: Amos 3. 6.
Job acknowledged it, Job 2. 10.
so David; To use revenge, 2 Samuel 16. 10.
were to resist God, as the dog that bites the staff, would be willing to bite
the man if he could; Its as if a Child should pull the rod out of his Fathers
hand, and break it before his face, What would we say of such a Child? The
Magistrate indeed may take revenge for wrongs done us, we our selves must not.
3. It were in vain to fight with the world with the worlds weapons, they will
be too hard for us; Prayers and patience are our proper wepons, whereby we
shall be too hard for them. 4. Thus we hurt our selves more then them; them a
little in body, goods or name, our selves a great deal in our souls, as the
Be, by stinging loses her own life; we have our wills a little, but the wrath
of God withal, and that is dearly bought. 5. It proceeds of great weakness; If
we had Spiritual strength, we would pass by great things: we do therefore but
proclaim our own weakness, when we revenge. Moses, David, and others of Gods
dear servants, would not give way hereunto, especially, beyond all comparison,
our Savior Christ, who suffered so monstrous things of such base persons, and
that so unjustly, as one that had never the least ill thought against God or
man: French Academy, page 301. cap. 30.
O this ought to move us to great patience, yea of the Heathens themselves,
there were not a few which were admirable in patience.

This condemns the monstrous practice of the world, Use.
that is set upon nothing but revenge, give taunt for taunt, blow for blow,
etc. He is no body that will not revenge himself to the uttermost, from the
least to the greatest: Much is spent this way in Law, only for men's wicked
wills upon stomach and to revenge; Some profess, and are not ashamed to say,
I Will be revenged on him, I Will not leave him worth a groat, I Will fit in his
skirts once in the year, I Will be even with him; who, that they may have their
will of a man, care not what they spend, though they have the curse of God
withal; If they be told thereof, what is their defense? Had he not begun with
me, he should have gone long enough before I would have wronged him, but seeing
he has thus done, I Will serve him as well: He is counted an honest man that
does not begin to wrong another, but he that does but requite wrong with the
like, O that is very reasonable, and it were no reason to require the contrary:
Thus most have no ears to hear any persuasions to put up wrongs, a certain sign
that they are fleshly, and that the Devil bears sway in their hearts.

What? Obj.
Shall I put up abuses? then I shall be counted a fool.

Not of God who bids thee so do, R.
nor of Angels, nor of good men, who count them wise that so do: He that is
slow to wrath, is of great wisdom: For the contrary, none but fools and bad men
will count you wise, neither are they fit Judges, yea, their dispraise is a
praise: He is not strongest that can revenge, but that can up most and overcome
himself; Its beastly power to subdue others, but Christians must subdue their
own rebellious affections and lusts. But alas, even Gods Servants, and they
that have good things in them are yet greatly taken herein, as appears in their
writings about matters in controversy; they break out into personal disgraces,
and bitter invectives one against another, a very unseemly thing, me thinks,
not savoring of the Spirit, but of the Fesh, yea the way to exasperate, and so
to increase sin: The truth may be sufficiently maintained, and error gainsaid
and confuted without such things: That Christians should be stirred one against
another, that they should not bear one with another, that they should rip up
one another faults, that they should disgrace one another, that they should
either fall flat out one with another into bitter terms, or biting them into
worse purposes, not forget wrongs, true or seeming, for a great while: O this
is wonderful, yea monstrous pride; where is love that suffers long? and where
is the example of our Savior all this while? And where is our forgiving one
another, as we would God should forgive us? This hinders not but that
Magistrates may execute justice upon ill doers, so it be upon no private
grudge; and that Parents and Masters may correct the faults of their Children
and servants, so it be chiefly in regard of the sin against God, and for the
good of the party: And a man may take the benefit of the Magistrate, if the
matter be of weight, and cannot be well ended otherwise; yea, if he be set
upon, and violence offered to him, he may be a Magistrate for himself, if he
cannot shift off his enemies, and by defending himself he may be freed of the
danger; and if he must needs wound or be wounded, kill or be killed, then no
doubt its lawful rather to kill then be killed, and yet to be as free from
revenge, as full of pity.

But committed himself, etc.] Our Savior would not revenge himself on his
adversaries, as knowing that his Father was wise enough, and knew what to do to
them, and being just, would also do right judgment. They that revenge
themselves, call into question Gods wisdom and justice.
Whence note, That

They that revenge, think that God either is not wise enough, or just enough to
requite the wrongs done them, or to determine of their cases; for if they so
thought, they would leave it to him whose office it is, and who will do it to
the purpose: He that revengeth, puts God out of his place, Deuteronomy. 32. 35.
and sits down therein; Psalm 94. 1.
Should any having no Authority, Romans 12. 19.
Calling or fitness, intrude himself into the place or seat of a Temporal
Judge, would he not be accounted a Fool or a Madman?

Let us therefore beware of revenge, Use.
seeing it concludes so wickedly on our parts against God, and know we, that we
do always provide best for our selves, when we commend our cause to God, for he
knows how, when and which way to defend his, and revenge them on their Enemies:
Number. 26. 9, 10.
When Moses bare quietly the abuse of Corah and his company, how did God right
his cause? The like may be said of David's, 1 King. 2. 24.
in respect of the wrongs done by Saul and Shimei: If we revenge our selves, we
turn Gods revenge against our selves, and as we become partners with them that
have wronged us in sin, so shall we in punishment.

To him that judges righteously.] God is a righteous Judge.
God is the Judge of the world, he daily judges, and has especially prepared
one day wherein he will judge the world, Acts 17. 31.
and give every one according to that they have done: His judgments are always
righteous, as between Moses and Corah, yea, Moses and Miriam, David and Saul,
Ahab and Naboth, etc. they committed their cause unto God, who accordingly
righted them; so did he right Hezekiah on Senacherib, Peter on Herod, the Holy
Martyrs on their bloody persecuters: Thus does God revenge himself of the
wicked enemies of Gods faithful Ministers; and thus for our weakness, he keeps
as it were petty Sessions, but this is nothing to that he will do: He reaches
out his hand as it were from behind a Curtain, and gives now one, now another
of his Enemies a rap, thereby to relieve our weakness, and strengthen us, and
to curb the wicked that they be not too outrageous; but here is a day coming
wherein he will thoroughly judge between his servants and their enemies: Things
seem to go crooked now, when the wicked tread under foot the poor Saints like
clay in the streets, and insult over them; but as a Turner or Joyner with
crooked tools will make straight and even work, so hereby in Gods wise
providence is set forth, as well the constancy of his Saints, as the malice of
their Enemies, the one being thus prepared to glory, the other to Destruction,
both which shall evidently appear on the great day.

O how notably may this comfort Gods servants, Use.
and make them patient in their sufferings? Iam. 5. 6, 7.
And how may this terrify the wicked, that dare meddle with any that belong
unto God? Prove. 22. 23.
He that defends them is mighty, and he will spoil the soul of them that
spoil them.

Verse 24. Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we
being dead to sin, should live unto righteonsness, by whose stripes ye were
healed.
OUr Apostle having had occasion to speak of the passion of our Savior Christ,
Christ's passion set out by the ends thereof.
thought it too bare to have spoken of it, as an example to move us to suffer,
and that patiently, but continues his speech of it, and sets it out by the ends
thereof, and the many benefits that come to us thereby: 1. That we be thereby
delivered from our sin, and the punishment thereof. 2. Enabled to dye unto sin,
that we might live unto righteousness: Having fallen into this argument, he
sticks in it, and cannot easily get out, but is like a friend that holds his
friend long by the hand, being loath to part with him.

Who] Even Christ himself, Heb. 1. 2, 3.
the Son of God, Lord of Angels and of the whole world.

His own self] In his own person, not by a Deputy, without any help in the
business.

Bare] That is, suffered the intolerable and infinite wait of Gods wrath due
to our sins, bare our sins, and all that was due to them, which would have
swallowed up men and Angels.

Our sins] Even the sins of the Elect, all of them, and the punishment of the
same.

In his own body] Not but that he suffered in soul, and therein his chiefest
sufferings were, but because he speaks of his putting to death, the cruel usage
of his body was evident.

On the tree,] Namely, the Cross, which death he dyed by the especial
providence of God being that kind of death, Deuteronomy. 21. 23.
which God had pronounced accursed; and so fittest for our Savior Christ to
endure, that he might bear what we had deserved, which was to become accursed,
that we might escape the curse which we had deserved, by the breach of the Law:
Gal. 3. 10.
For, Cursed is every one that continues not in all things which are written
in the Book of the Law, to do them: The foregoing words set forth the passion
of Christ. The following,

That we being dead unto sin, etc.] The fruits that come to us thereby.

As a child that has a piece of Sugar in his mouth, is loath to let it go
down, but would keep the sweetness still; so does our Apostle by the Doctrine
of Christ's passion, so sweet, comfortable, useful, and admirable, he cannot get
out of it, but does as it were dwell on it, which teaches us not to be weary
in meditating hereon, We must not be weary in meditating on Christ's passion,
and hearing thereof.
or hearing hereof: it should be still fresh and new to us, as the song of the
Saints and Angels, though the same, yet is ever new: The Angels themselves
desire to see further into this mystery of Gods love to his Church in giving
his Son; They saw somewhat by the Prophets, 1 Pet. 1. 12.
some more when he was come, especially when crucified, and risen again from
the dead, but most of all, when they saw the Gentiles called, and the Gospel
Preached so plainly by the Apostles; yet its said, They be not satisfied, but
stooping down as it were, they pray and desire to see more, yet is the benefit
more to us then unto them, and therefore how much more unwearied should we be?
Herewith our Apostle was so taken, as that he desired to know nothing else but
Christ crucified, Phil. 8. 9.
and esteemed all privileges and advantages that he had of being a Pharisee,
an Hebrew, etc. as dung in comparison of Christ: The Israelites were often told
by the Prophets of their deliverance out of Egypt, how much more should we be
content to hear of our deliverance through Christ, whereof that was but a small
resemblance and type? But alas, how quickly are we weary of this argument?
Because we have heard often of it, its now stale, and people have no more mind
to hear it, then the Israelites could be contented with the Manna which God
allowed them, but lusted after other Food: As they that go to Sea, think it
strange, and for a day or two admire the wonderful works of God, but afterward
cease therefrom; so do we in this matter, though most sweet, comfortable,
admirable, and of daily use to make us grow in hatred of sin, and love of God,
and would also be a spur to our dullness.

But to come to the passion it self; A brief of the sufferings of Christ, set
down at large by the Evangelists.
Its usually referred to that he suffered on the Cross, as here, because that
was a great part, and the most visible to all, and the end of all; but there
were also infinite sufferings before and besides his death: His whole life was
a continual suffering, from his birth to his death, from the Manger to the
Cross, all full of Crosses: His abasement to take our nature was much, and to
become subject to all our infirmities, sin only excepted, and to be in a poor
condition, persecuted as soon as born, living obscurely with his Parents till
about thirty years old, in the exercise (as is supposed) of a mean Trade,
strange abasement for the Son of God; as soon as he entered into his Office and
was baptized, the Devil set sore on him: After this as a recompense to his
continual toil and travel for men's Souls and Bodies, he was not only content to
live in a mean condition without any House of his own, etc. but he was so
vilely railed on and slandered (as is set down in the foregoing Verse) as none
have been more, or so much, yea, as sometimes in policy they sought to entrap
him, so at other times they laid wait, and used means to kill him; At last,
they plotted by one of his own Disciples to take away his life, as burning with
an irreconcilable hatred against him: See Luke 12. 50.
But ere he was betrayed, John 13. 27.
he entered upon his sufferings in a most grievous manner, yea no doubt even
before he thought thereof at sundry times, which did not a little trouble and
perplex him; as a woman thinking sometimes of the pains of her travel before
they come, is set on a sweat, and quakes for fear thereof: But after he had
finished the Passover, and instituted the Supper, he knowing that the time of
his death approached, went into the Mount of Olives, and there entered into his
most bitter Passion, taking with him Peter, James and John, the beholders of
his transfiguration and glory, and therefore the fitter to behold his
abasement; but alas, pitying them, he left them, only giving them a charge to
watch and pray, and went from them a stones cast, for they were not able to
behold his agony, nor hear the grievous dolor that he could not but make, and
then began his pains as of a woman in travel, save that they were a thousand
times greater, he fell on his face grovelling, and cried out, His soul was
heavy unto the death, and was in such an agony that he shed drops of blood (a
thing never heard of) and that through the extreme force of his pain: O it was
the intolerable weight of his Fathers wrath due for all our vile sins, which
was so grievous, as it made him pray to his Father for help, and to remove that
cup, if it might be; which was but the frailty of his humane Nature, without
sin, desiring help, feeling it self almost swallowed up, and having that which
would not only have taken away the bodily life of all men, if it had been on
them, but even have sunk them for ever. Thus he went too and fro to his
Disciples three times (they being in the mean time asleep) and here in the
Mount drunk three draughts (as we may say) of this most bitter cup of his
Fathers wrath, which was infinitely beyond all torment his body was or could be
put to: Then comes his betraying, treacherously betrayed of one of his own
Family, whom he had used kindly; thence carried away with clubs and staves, as
a Malefactor, unto Annas and Caiphas, where he was in the high Priests Hall all
night misused in most shameful manner, some smiting him, others spitting on him;
and because he said he was a King, they pulled off his clothes, and arrayed him
in purple, and crowned him with thorns; and because he was counted a Prophet,
having blindfolded him, and smitten him, they bid him prophecy who had hit
him: But because they have not the power of death in their own hands, they make
use of the secular power, laying many things to his charge, and arraigning him
at the Bar as a guilty person, a mover of Sedition, one that denied to pay
tribute to Caesar, and who said he was a King: But Pilat seeking to rid his
hands of him, because he saw it was nothing but the malice of the Priests,
sends him to Herod, who, as if he had been some Jugler to play feats, was glad
to see him; whereof failing, he and his followers misused him notably at their
pleasures, and sent him to Pilat again.

Before him he was again arraigned, and Barabbas preferred unto him, the Jews in
the mean time crying out against him, that he might be crucified: Then was he
condemned to be scourged, to be carried away and crucified, was made bear his
own Cross, till he could bear it no longer; then were his hands and his feet
nailed thereto, himself hanging between to Thieves, many in the mean time
mocking him (as did one of the Thieves also) and wagging their heads at him, he
being as a But for all to shoot at, and a common Mark for every man's wicked
tongue to aim at; On the Cross he was about three hours: All this while besides
bodily pains which could not but be grievous, he had again a most bitter cup
given him to drink, and he had it poured in so fast, and such load laid on him,
as that he cried out, My God, my God, why have thou forsaken me? Though God did
secretly sustain him, yet his Humane frailty felt himself almost overcome and
gone: Oh! it must needs be so, for it was that wrath we should have suffered in
Hell, though not with the same quality that the wicked feel Hell pains, namely,
with being utterly forsaken of God, and despairing and blaspheming on their
parts: Oh, this was most grievous, that the Son should have the Fathers wrath
poured out upon him! Oh, it was more then all the pains that were ever upon all
men together in this world: And from the sixth to the ninth hour the Sun was
darkened, and our Savior all that while abode in a most grievous perplexity,
during which time he uttered but seven Sentences, and in this while he drunk up
this bitter Cup to the very bottom, dregs and all: Then he gave up the ghost,
and dyed, was buried, and held under death for a space. Behold a little poor
draught of the lamentable Sufferings of our Savior Christ; to express it as it
was fully, no tongue of man or Angel is able: And all these things he endured
for our sakes, and for our sins, for he had none of his own. They were our sins
that brought all this upon him, and had it not been for this, we had all been
damned for ever, as the evil Angels that fell, of whom none shall be saved: He
was arraigned before the Bar of an earthly Judge, that we might not be
arraigned before Gods Tribunal Seat; He was condemned, that we might be
absolved; He was mocked and spitted on, that we might escape shame here, and
confusion of faces hereafter; He was scourged, that we might escape the stripes
of Gods vengeance; He dyed, that we might live; dyed a cursed death, that we
might escape the curse and be blessed: and thus he had the smart, and we the
benefit; our sins the cause of all his sorrow, and his sorrow the mean of all
our welfare; for by this means we are discharged, our Surety has paid every
farthing: Neither could there be any other course taken with our sins, but that
a death must be suffered; for Gods Justice had pronounced Death the punishment
of it, and so required it: He could not remit our sin, but upon a satisfaction;
therefore they that look for Salvation any other way, or by their good meaning,
good Prayers, good serving God, etc. shall miss thereof, for none but by a
payment paid, and death and infinite wrath suffered, can enter into Heaven: No
other person or persons could have undergone this; all men were in our case,
none able to help himself, much less others; all unable to suffer, and to
overcome the least part of this wrath. And for Angels, alas, it was far beyond
their power, for it was an infinite wrath that we had deserved, by sinning
against an infinite God, but their power is finite. This also was a sufficient
satisfaction, being performed by the Son of God; it was more that he should
suffer one moment, then all men and Angels for ever and ever: He like a rich
Creditor paid that in a few hours, that we poor Creatures could never have
overcome; and though the time of his Passion was but short, and that in respect
of the dignity of his person, and for that he was enabled through his Godhead
to perform this great work in so short a space, yet he suffered so much in that
short time, as would have held us work, and kept us under for ever and ever.

1. This sets out the ugliness of sin, Use 1.
and that most woeful case wherein we had plunged our selves by our sins, that
if God had not put forth all his wisdom, as we may so say, we must all have
perished.

2. This sets forth the most unspeakable love of God and of Jesus Christ
toward us vile wretches: Use 2.
That Christ should abase himself so low, Ioh. 3. 16.
to all that he suffered in body, in soul, from men, from his Father
especially, and for us Rebels his enemies, who had no need of us, nay, might
have been glorified in our destruction, O the infinite depth of his love! And
does not this call for wonderful and unspeakable love and affection from us to
God again, to do and suffer whatsoever he shall at any time require of us, to
serve him night and day, on hands and knees, with the whole might both of body
and soul (not a thought being out of his Service) yea, if it were to dye every
day for him? Psalm. 116. 12.
Should we not say with David, What shall I render unto the Lord for all his
benefits? this above all others? Oh! it rebukes our cold serving him, which
will scarce lay down our lusts at his request, who yet laid down his life for
us, our proud lusts, revenging lusts, covetous and worldly lusts, unclean
lusts, etc. O fearful unthankfulness! And how hardly are we brought to do
duties? No forwardness therein, negligence every way; and when we do them, how
cold and careless are we? O lamentable! Is a cold drowsy service suitable to
such a love as this? we may be even ashamed herein: And for suffering, alas, we
have no will, no not to endure a mock, a frown of a great person; we will make
friendship with the world, rather then to endure the least disgrace; we will
forbear many duties, nay, to keep company with Gods servants, only lest we
should be counted Puritans; How shall we then be able to go to Prison and death
for the cause of Christ?

3. To all that mourn in Sion, Use 3.
to all that are heavy laden, hungring after Christ Jesus, and willing to take
up his yoke, and to all other Believers, this is matter of most unspeakable
consolation: Their sins be gone, and all the punishment due to them; no
punishment shall befall them here (as on the ungodly) no wrath or condemnation
hereafter: Their afflictions are merciful corrections to further their
Salvation; To them death is no death, but a passage to life, that whereupon
their Souls are received into Heaven, their bodies committed to the earth, both
which at the Resurrection shall be joyfully reunited; O how should we walk
worthy of this in all holiness and honesty! But to all that shall not have part
in Christ, there remains unspeakable misery, it had been good for them they had
never been born; they must bear their own burden, and sink to Hell, there to
be for ever and ever: This will be the portion of most, because so few receive
Christ, so few are humbled, so many through pride and profaneness refuse to be
guided by him; O how few will cast away their lusts, and yield up themselves to
be ruled by him and his Word! It will be most woeful to the Turks, Jews and
Pagans, that shall perish without Christ; but yet of all others, their
judgment will be most fearful, which have had him preached daily, and by the
Ministers of God have been so often besought to embrace him, and yet have
despised him, would none of him; Oh, it will increase their torment, to
consider that they had offer of Christ, and many believed in him, and were
converted by the same Sermons, whereat they themselves were no whit moved: O
this will fret hearts! O lets consider this, we that live in this happy time!
One would think every man should receive and embrace Christ Jesus, but alas,
how few do this? for them that do not, it will be their undoing: O give no rest
unto your selves, till you can get a discharge in and by Christ, confess,
bewail, crave pardon, cry to God, and resolve to turn to him: The water is now
stirring, step into this Pool of Bethesda. John 5.


4. This condemns all false ways for Salvation, Use 4.
for other then Christ never was any, neither is or shall be; therefore all
that reject him, as Jews and Turks, or embrace him only to halves, as the
Papists, are in a fearful case, as all among our selves that trust to any thing
else besides him.

That we being dead to sin, etc.] Another main end of Christ's death, and
another great benefit redounding unto us thereby, namely, That he dyed for us,
not only to free us from sins, and wrath, and damnation deserved thereby, but
also to kill sins in us, to deliver us from the power thereof, and to dissolve
the works of the Devil in us, that being dead unto sin, we might live unto
righteousness: Of the words, first in general, then in particular.

In general note we thus much, that

For whomsoever Christ dyed, For whomsoever Christ dyed, he dyed to kill sin in
them.
he dyed to kill sin in them, for he dyed not to free us of half our misery,
and leave us in the other half; nor to be at a great deal of cost with us and
for us, and yet leave us in a case fit to do him no service (as if one should
ransom a man out of the Turks galleys, and leave him in the midway) but has
done all this, that we might be fit to do him service, thereupon giving us his
Word and Spirit to humble us, and so to change us, that sin may be mortified in
us, 1 Cor. 1. 30.
and we made live: He is not only made of God unto us Redemption, but also our
Sanctification; as he has redeemed us, Tit. 2. 14.
so has he purged us to be a peculiar people unto himself: Christ affords
both, See 1 Cor. 6. 20.
and from him we may as well look for the one as the other; 2 Cor. 5. 15.
yea, whosoever has indeed his part in the one, cannot be without the other,
Luke 1. 74.
and in token of our thankfulness, we ought to labor by all means to show forth
this latter. Ephesians. 5. 25.


1. This confutes that wicked slander of the Church of Rome: Use 1.
We talk (say they) that we must be saved by Christ's death, and by Faith in him
only, and not by any thing we can do, and therefore that we set men at liberty
to do what they list, and open a gap to all licentiousness; but as the Gospel
is not a Doctrine of liberty, so neither do we by preaching give way unto
licentiousness: See Romans 3. 31.
The Gospel requires as strict obedience as the Law does, to every of Gods
Commandments (though not in extremity) neither freeth it us from any duty to
God or men, yea teaches us, That denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
should live soberly, Tit. 2. 12.
righteously and godly in this present world, and that none have nor can have
part in Christ, Ephesians. 2. 10.
which give not themselves to good works.

2. This sets forth the wonderful goodness of Christ Jesus, Use 2.
that has not only freed us from Gods wrath, and the punishment of our sins
(which is unspeakable goodness) but has appointed to give us his Spirit to
free us from sin (for if we should all our life here have lived after our own
lusts, or under the power of Satan, what a base and woeful life had this been?)
that we might both in heart and body serve him in the works of holiness, and a
godly life.

3. This condemns all those that lay claim to the death of Christ, Use 3.
and yet live in their sins, and old lusts: Numbers in these days have got this
by the end, They hope to be saved by Jesus Christ; They be no Papists, that
look to be saved by their works, but they believe in Jesus Christ with all
their hearts, and yet they are not washed from their old filthiness, but abide
still in security in all or some of their lusts: But let such know, they speak
impossible things, God has joined these two ends of Christ's death, and they
divide them, yea blasphemous things, that Christ dyed to set men at liberty to
live as they list: O woeful wretches, that can say, They hope to be saved by
Christ, and that he dyed for them, and yet can follow every vain pleasure and
wicked lust, to redeem them from which, it cost even the blood of Christ (more
worth then a thousand worlds) what is this, but to set light by Christ's death,
which none can do, who has his part therein? yea, what is it but to crucify
him again, and to make a mock of his death? what beastly unthankfulness is it,
for any to say Christ dyed for me, Acts 15. 9.
and yet to live in sin? nay, whosoever have faith to believe their pardon in
Christ, 1 John 3. 3.
it purifieth their hearts, and the assurance of such a love to us, must needs
work love again in us, and that love will constrain us, yet who uses not this
shift? who flies not hereunto, as Joab unto the horns of the Altar? 1 Kings 2.
28, 34.
but as there he found no shelter from the Sword of Benaiah, so they that fly
to Christ as their refuge, having nothing to do with him, they shall be cut
off, and cast down into Hell for ever: O that the death of Christ, which ought
to be the greatest corrasive to eat out sin out of our hearts (as which cost
such a wonderful price) should be made a bo^ster for sin! As beggars go with
their licenses boldly from place to place, so do worldlings sin boldly, because
they can say, O they believe in Jesus Christ, and he has dyed for them, etc.
but as most of their licenses being found counterfeit, and made under a Bush,
are taken from them, and they themselves cast into Prison; So when God shall
come to examine those, this shall not free them or serve their turn, but they
shall be cast into utter darkness. If you live in your lusts, or have the love
of any one ^in in you, as yet ye have no part in Christ's death.

4. This may be a great comfort to those that can find and feel sin dying in
them, Use 4.
and themselves dead to all sin, and the love of any one, and that they are
renewed to live the life of God, and yield obedience to all his Commandments:
Though this be not as they would, yet if their hearts can bear witness with
them that this in truth, let them be assured they have their part in Christ's
death. Having their part in the latter benefit thereof, its an argument of the
former; For how come they to be now so changed into an hatred of all the sins,
which before they loved, and such a true and earnest care to please God? Romans
8. 1.
Flesh and blood has not so taught them, but Gods Spirit, and that is an
argument we are his, even his Spirit that he has given us.

But many that would not willingly offend God for any thing, and having failed
in the least thing, are more troubled then most be at great matters, yea, and
study and strive for nothing so much as to please God, yet cannot be persuaded
that Christ dyed for them.

Oh! Obj.
I fear that Christ dyed not for me, will such a one say, because I feel such a
corrupt and rebellious nature within me, and I am often overcome of sin and
Satan.

Its not the mark of such as Christ dyed for, R.
that they are freed from sin altogether, but that they hate all sin, that they
resist it, and often prevail against the same; whereof if at any time they be
overcome, yet they rise again by unfeigned repentance, and stand up upon their
watch; for in the best of Gods Servants, there will some of the Canaanilist
brood remain, as pricks in our sides, but so long as we keep them Tributaries,
we must not be discouraged; though our corruptions salley out upon us
sometimes, yet if we make war upon them, and chase them home, and so weaken
them, they shall not prevail over us: The Church is not in this world without
spot, except it be by imputation of Christ's righteousness, Phil. 5. 25.
for in respect of Sanctification, its but begun to be cleansed, and shall be
perfected in the world to come. Thus in general.

In particular, The two parts of Repentance
the two clauses here mentioned, contain the two parts of Repentance, or
Sanctification, namely, Mortification and Vivification, or dying unto sin, and
living unto righteousness.

Dead unto sin*] Its the duty of every Christian in token of his thankfulness
to God that has delivered him from this most woeful state, Christians must
endeavor to mortify their lusts.
to set himself to mortify his lusts, and all manner of evil, and that every
day more and more: Though we cannot be dead to sin at once (it being a work of
our whole life) yet must we be dead to the love of all sin, open or secret,
outward or inward, and so dye daily; as Christ dyed, so should we labor, and be
more and more dead to our lusts; as he was crucified, so should we crucify
them, etc. And can we live in sin, that cost the price of the blood of Christ?
Who would not abhor and cast from him the knife that killed his dearest friend?
Thus did sin to our Savior Christ, it was that which brought him to his death.

1. The thing then that best beseems a Christian, Use 1.
is to mortify his vile lusts, to find them out, to hate and pursue them to
the death, to apply all means to the weakening and killing thereof, ever hacking
at the roots thereof, by continual Prayer and Meditation, applying the Word,
Mercies, Corrections, all to the throat of our Corruptions; for as nothing is
more unbeseeming a Christian, then to be carried away of any lust, so this
should be our continual exercise, to be continually weakening our Corruptions.
This is true Religion, it stands not in hearing Sermons, but in mortifying our
lusts, and bringing our rebellious hearts in subjection to the will of God. And
as we are to labor for the subduing of all, so are we especially of our
strongest corruptions, that have most foiled us, most broke our peace, most
dishonored God, and have been of worst example.

2. This rebukes a wonderful fault in most Christians, Use 2.
that howsoever they have general purposes to resist sin and to do well, yet
think that they are not continually to labor for the mortifying thereof;
wherein failing, they do sometimes yield and give way to their lusts to break
out into open evils, vain speeches, slight oaths, worldly talking on the Lords
day, gaming, and the like: So for their inward lusts of pride, covetousness,
frowardness, security, dullness to duties, unbelief, coldness and customariness
in the service of God; Alas, these they look not after, but almost lay the
reign on the neck of them, so that if they reign not in them, yet they break
out at every turn, and are very rank in them, and show forth themselves grossly
to Gods dishonor, their own discomfort, and the continual breach of their
peace, with much evil example to others. Gal. 5. 24.
As we would prove our selves Christ's, let us labor to crucify the flesh, with
the affections and lusts thereof; let us deal with our sins, as the Jews dealt
with Christ, kill them, bury them, lay a great stone upon them, set a watch
over them.

Should live unto righteousness.] As we must be dead unto sin, so must we be
alive unto God.
Its not enough to be dead to sin, but we must be alive to God, and to his
Commandments in doing all good. By righteousness is meant, the whole duty of
man in all godliness, throughout his whole conversation to God and Men: When
its joined with holiness, See Luke 1. 75.
then it stands for the duties of the second Table, Tit. 2. 12.
but alone, it stands for all, as in that of the Apostle, Being then made free
from sin, Romans 6. 18.
ye became the servants of righteousness; and to this end has Christ dyed for
us, even that we should not live after the lusts of the flesh, but after the
will of God, serving him in holiness and righteousness all the days of our
life: And what should we else do? how else express our thankfulness? we ought
to be exceeding thankful, even for earthly benefits, how much more for this,
Christ dying for us? O happy change! We that were sometimes the slaves of sin,
and drudges of Satan, doing base work for woeful wages, are now become the
Servants of God, employed in holy works, whereof here the fruits are, peace of
Conscience, and joy in the Holy Ghost, and the end everlasting life.

We ought therefore to give our selves to an holy life in all things, Use.
showing hereby whose we are, and to whom we belong, as its said of the
Merindolians, That they were known by their godly behavior, wheresoever they
became. It was a custom among the Romans, that every one should carry some note
of his Trade or Profession as he went in the streets, a Carpenter his Rule, a
Tailor his Yard or Measure, etc. So ought we to carry a badge of our Profession
every where about us, whether we go to Church, be at home in our Families, go
to Market, to our Shops, or Workfolks, etc. even holiness throughout our whole
conversation. In prosperity we must show forth sobriety; in adversity,
patience; at all times the fruits of love, faithfulness, uprightness, etc. Are
we in company? our speeches must be gracious and godly; Luke 1. 75.
if alone, holy and heavenly minded: And this we ought not to do a little by
fits in a good mood, and when we list, but we must walk in holiness and
righteousness all the days of our life; we must be continually ready to every
good work, we must be a peculiar people, Tit. 2. 14.
zealous of good works: If these things be in us, and abound, great profit will
redound unto us, and hereunto must we employ all our endeavors.

By whose stripes ye were healed.] Now he returns again to Servants, applying
the benefit of Christ to them. By stripes, or wales of the stripes, he means
not only the stripes he had of men, but all his sufferings; he uses the word
stripes, in respect of Servants, because they suffered stripes of their
Masters, and that for their especial comfort, as who did not suffer alone, and
whose stripes were healed through the stripes which Christ suffered.

All that Christ suffered for us, All that Christ suffered was for our profit.
was wholesome and saving, his shame, our glory; his condemnation, our
absolution; his curse, our blessing; his strokes, our peace; his death, our
life. The most grievous stripes that he suffered, have healed the most ugly and
deadly sores of our sins, which otherwise had been incurable: We ought
therefore to be content to suffer some stripes for him and for his sake, and
for the profession of his Name; he was mocked and reviled for us, may not we
then be content to suffer the like for him? What are we to him? He became poor,
to make us rich; if we be cut short for his sake, shall we not endure it? Do
thou suffer any thing for Christ? bear the same patiently; and great reason,
Christ suffered much for thee. Christ dyed even for poor servants.


Note further, that Christ dyed even for poor Servants, and that therefore the
meanest are to labor after their part in Christ (and yet who are more negligent
then the poor are for the most part?) and those poor that have their part in
him, are to be highly thankful, and bear their outward wants patiently, and
think that God has dealt wonderfully for them, having passed by so many great,
wise and learned ones.

In the words also these particulars are implied,

1. That sin is a wound or disease; Sin is a disease.
as a disease weakens the body, so does sin every faculty of the soul: As the
former also brings deformity on the body, causes pain, and thereupon follows
death, so does the latter on the soul.

2. That our bodies are subject to many sicknesses, Our bodies are subject to
many sicknesses.
and the diseases thereof are oftentimes very grievous; and if those be such,
what are the diseases and pains of the soul? the one may put us in mind of the
other.

3. That Christ is our Physician, Christ is our Physician.
both for body and soul; He has both skill, will, compassion, heals us
freely, and is ever near us; he has by his Passion purchased all good for us;
he wrought many cures and miracles in the days of his flesh, now he works by
means, and his blessing thereon.

4. That sin is hateful to God, Sin hateful to God.
as for which Christ suffered stripes.

Seek we therefore help in Christ, Use.
we are sick of many diseases, we cannot help our selves by any Medicine we can
devise, Christ only can cure us: This Faith apprehends, for that the wounding
of one should heal another, is above Nature. Oh! how will men being sick in
body bestir themselves, that they may be cured; but being inwardly diseased
through sin, how slack are they? how do they defer it to the last, when its too
late? There be but certain seasons to be cured in, as the man at the Pool of
Bethesda observed; miss we not our opportunity, How we may speed in our suits
to Christ.
lest we perish altogether. And that we may speed at the hands of this our
Physician, 1. We must feel our disease, and be humbled, confess also and bewail
the same to him. 2. Earnestly beg of him to heal us. 3. Hurt our selves no more
as near as we can. 4. Believe he will heal us. 5. Suffer the words of
Exhortation, the preaching of the Word being the means to cure our sinful
Nature. 6. Take heed of dawbers, that cry Peace, peace. 7. Take heed of all
false cures, as by our selves, Masses, Pilgrimages, Indulgencies, etc. 8. Abide
the Lords leisure in the use of the means, though we should be cured by
threatenings of the Word, or by afflictions; yea, being once cured, do we
acknowledge the same to his glory, and be we thankful; Psalm. 103. 3.
for its he alone that has satisfied for our sins, he alone through whom our
sinful Nature is cured.

Verse 25. For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto the
great Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
THese words are a confirmation of those immediately going before, that they
were healed by Christ, by comparing their former state wherein they were, with
their present state: They were once in a poor case, in a piteous taking, in a
miserable and dangerous case; but now through Gods mercy they were come home to
Christ, who most carefully did and would protect them to their Salvation:
Before they came to Christ, their case was woeful and dangerous (as is the state
of all unregenerate persons) but now having taken hold of Christ, their
condition was safe and happy, as its with all believers and penitent persons.

For ye were as sheep going astray;] Speak we first of the miserable state of
all unregenerate men, of all men without Christ, they are as sheep going astray.

1. Every Natural man is like a beast, Every natural man is like a beast.
who is therefore in Scripture compared to several sorts of beasts, for one ill
quality or another; as to Dogs, Psa. 22. 12, 13, 16, 20.
for their malicious barking and biting at them they live with; to Wolves, for
their greedy devouring of the poor; to Lions, for their cruel tyranny; Psalm.
32. 9.
to fat fat Bulls, for their proud abuse of their prosperity; to Hogs, for
their rude and unreverent base esteeming of Spiritual things, Isa. 1. 3.
as the Word and Sacraments, and Gods Ministers; to Foxes (as Herod) for their
craft; Ier. 8. 7.
so to Horses and Mules, for their ignorance and unruliness; Prove. 6. 6.
yea, sometimes the beasts are preferred before them to shame them, and
sometimes they are sent to school to them: nay, all Gods Creatures are more
serviceable then Man, they obey God in their kind, and abide in their first
estate; the Sun, Moon and Stars obey God in their courses, the huge Sea rages,
and is calm at his bidding; if he command it to stand as a wall, it does so, to
let Israel go through, and will return again upon the same warrant and drown
Pharaoh; if God bid the Whale swallow Jonah, and cast him up again, it obeys
him in both; if he forbid the Lions to touch Daniel, they stir not, though very
hungry, as the fire did not burn the three Children, etc. But man, that should
be best of all, and for whom all were made, as he for God, yet walk stubbornly
and rebelliously, omitting what is required of him, and doing what is again and
again prohibited: therefore God calls all Creatures to witness against man;
Isa. 1. 2.
yea, they are many times to set themselves against us (as when the heavens
become as brass, Deuteronomy. 32. 1.
and the earth as iron, etc.) and to groan because of us, as being weary of
doing any further service to such as we are.

O how ought this to humble all that be such, Use.
that know no mark of conversion or change in themselves from their
unregenerate condition, small cause have thou to be proud; the Horse thou
ridest on is far better then thou art, it does that for which God did ordain
it, but thou do not that which the Lord requires of thee; nay the Dog that
keeps thy Yard, and ears bones under thy table is in a better case then thou
art, its serves God in its kind, thou never did any thing that God set thee
here for.

O humble thy self before God, Isa. 11. 6. 7, etc.
and crave of him to work an alteration in thee, for he only can do it, and
that by the Ministry of his word: Thus can he bring it to pass, delivering
thee from thy brutish nature, and turning thee into a Christian man, renewing
in thee his image, and working of grace, that so thou may serve him in a
better manner then other creatures either do or can do; so shall thou be more
happy then they, for they as they have no pain, so they shall have no glory, but
thou shall go from hence to everlasting glory in the Kingdom of Heaven.

But as for all that continue in their Rebellion, as they are worse then beasts
in their life, so shall they be in their end, for their death is but a
beginning to eternal misery: O how happy were it for every man that shall dye
in his sins, if he were turned this day into a Dog or Toad, and no further
account to be taken of him!

2. As a Sheep that wandereth is out of his way, Every unregenerate man is out
of his way.
so is every natural and unregenerate man quite out of his way, out of the way
to Peace and Happiness: Isa. 53. 6.
We were created in the right way, but in Adam all went astray; Romans 3. 12.
we have no mind but of wandering and roaming further and further the longer
we live, till God take us into the right way; so that whosoever dies in the way
he was born in, and lived in first, must needs perish; its the way of
ignorance, of sin, the broad way to destruction: Some go out of the way by
ignorance, some by superstition, some by profaneness, by hypocrisy, by
trusting to civility, etc. naturally we do all go from God and Peace, to Hell
and the Devil. Abraham was out of his way whilst he was an Idolater, Psalm. 58.
3.
so Paul whilst he was a Persecutor: The wicked they go astray even from the
womb, they wander from every good work, and do nothing well or pleasing to God:
They delight to wander and take pleasure in their sins; yea, that they thus
wander, may appear by these signs, Reasons.
They refuse instruction and reproof, whether public or private, whereas the
regenerate account those to love them indeed which tell them of their faults;
they live even in known sins, they are altogether for the world, having no
communion with God in holy duties; they have no love to good company, but
associate themselves with others like themselves, and of their own stamp: If
they do good duties, How they come to be misled.
its for sinister respects, not out of conscience: Thus the Devil misleads
some; Antichrist seduceth thousands by false Doctrine and miracles, as wicked
Ministers by seldom or erroneous teaching and bad lives: So is the world a
great deceiver by bad examples, by false reports of the servants of God, and by
the profits and pleasures thereof; yea, a man's own heart is a great deceiver,
as whereby many think they are in the way to Heaven, when they be in the way to
destruction: Ignorance also of the Scriptures is a great cause of being
deceived; Ye err (says our Savior) not knowing the Scriptures; nay, God in
justice gives some over to believe lies, as Ahab was seduced by false Prophets
to his destruction: Psalm. 95. 11.
they may provoke God so long by their wandering, that he will never reclaim or
bring them home, but swear in his wrath, they shall never enter into his rest;
they may despise the means so long, as no Sermon shall do them good: These are
in a fearful state, marked to destruction, as Trees to be felled.

This also should humble men (for what are they but straggling creatures?) and
make them desire to get into the right way: But how few will take knowledge
they be out of their way, thinking still their case to be good enough, ^ Ier.
8. 6.
as the Lord complained by Jeremiah, I hearkened and heard, but none spoke
aright, no man repented him of his wickedness, saying, Prove. 14. 12.
What have I done? etc. There Is a way that seems good in a man's eyes, but the
issues thereof are the issues of death: To those whom God means to save, he
sends his Word and Spirit, and so opens their eyes to see that they be out of
their way, and that not only profane persons, but also some hypocrites, that
have contented themselves with some common things, as Herod did, and sometimes
civil persons, that thought their state very good, that God opens their eyes to
see it to be woeful, and make them hasten out of it, saying as those in the
Acts, What shall we do to be saved? Acts 2. 37, and 26, 18.
we find we are in the way to damnation; but most men will not be persuaded of
this, but go on with a liking of their way, though it be to their destruction:
To this end Ministers must preach the Law, and show men that be out of their
way, and people must take out this lesson; and this is the first, till this be,
nothing is.

3. As the sheep is most subject to wander, No natural man can of himself come
home to God.
but of all Creatures has least wisdom to find the way home again; so no
natural man can come home to God alone: we can go further and further from God,
but to come home one step we cannot; we are blind and cannot see a step of the
way, have no mind but to wander, All the thoughts of man's heart are only evil
continually, John 6. 44.
and we cannot think a good thought; No man can come to me (says our Savior)
except the Father draw him.

If any be come home to God from his wandering state, Use.
let him give all the glory to God, and know, that there was no difference
between them and those that yet wander, if God had not sought them, and as it
were fetched them home on his shoulders; if God had not thus done for us, we had
wandered to this hour, yea to our dying day, as well as others, therefore wonder
and praise God: And for those that yet wander, let them not bless themselves,
as if they could turn to God when they list, as many think, Oh, they will cry
God a mercy at their end, etc. but while you have life and time with the means,
entreat God to bless the means from Heaven to be mighty, to open your eyes, and
to bring you home from straying, into the way that leads into eternal life.

4. As the sheep that is wandered is in manifold dangers, The natural man is in
continual danger.
so and much more certainly is every natural man in inevitable danger, if he so
continue: He is out of Gods special providence, as the stray sheep is from the
tendance of the Shepherd, his eye is not over him: He has no certain abiding,
as Cain, knows not what to do; he is separate from the company of Gods people,
and what evil may not then befall him? As a sheep is in danger to be carried
away by diverse Lords, into whose several grounds he comes; so is a natural
man in danger of the Devil, the World, his own lusts, in danger to fall into
every sin (what has he to stop him?) into any plague or punishment that ever
fell upon any (what promise has he to the contrary?) yea, as sheep are apt to
fall into the mouths of Dogs and Wolves, so may the natural man fall into the
paws of the Devil, and be turned into Hell, he knows not how soon: Is not he in
danger that is naked in a field, and beset with Bills, Bows and Guns, all bent
against him to destroy him? Prove. 4. 19.
so is it with every wicked man, as being subject to all the plagues of God: Is
not he in danger that hangs over a pit by a twig? so is every wicked man by the
thread of his life over Hell: When a wicked man rises in the morning, does he
know what may befall him ere night? can he tell but he may fall even into the
foulest sins? can he tell but that the earth may swallow him, a thunderbolt may
strike him through, he may have any curse befall him or his? can he tell but he
may be in Hell ere night, and at night, ere morning? and is not this danger
enough? Thus hundreds of this Land drop into Hell every day, and in every
corner some, at one time or another, by one means or another the Devil lays
hold on them.

This may make every wicked man weary of his condition, Use.
and to have little joy of himself, till he be out of this state, who can abide
to live in a continual danger? For them that be gone, and of whom Hell has
already caught hold, there is no hope or help: You that are alive, look to your
selves, were you out of this condition, you could not be overcome, you could
not be plucked from God by Angels or Devils, all the world could not prevail
against you, being under Christ's keeping, he would keep you unto the end.

But are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.] Here Is the
safe state of Believers: They are now converted, not by any power or goodness
in themselves, but by the mighty power and goodness of God, to the Shepherd and
Bishop of their souls, Christ Jesus, who having redeemed them, will not now
lose them, but safely preserve and keep them to life eternal both in body and
soul. So that

All that are come to God in Christ Jesus, All Believers are in a safe
condition.
be in a most safe state; for besides that they have pardon of sin (the Robe of
Christ's righteousness being put on them) they have the Spirit to sanctify them
from the power of sin, and to enable them to please God in a new life: Neither
can they fall from this estate, nor can fall into any sin unto death; there is no
condemnation to them, neither the Devil nor World shall be able to draw them to
their old state, Christ that has redeemed them will never lose them; Who will
lose a purchase dearly bought? but so are we to Christ; Who will not keep his
Limbs? we are made Members of Christ; Will he suffer one to be pulled off? God
forbid: John 17. 11.
Christ having redeemed us, commits us to his Fathers keeping, and who being
under his protection, is not in a safe Castle or impregnible Fortress? Not
only they are sure they can never, fall finally, but also Christ has a care
of every sheep, to keep him in the right way, to fetch him in when he wanders,
to comfort him being heavy, See Psalm. 43. 1. and 46. 4.
and to bind him up being broken: What Christian finds not this by daily
experience, that God preserves him daily by his grace from many falls, comforts
him in many heavinesses, reduces him from many wanderings?

1. Here Is matter of unspeakable comfort for those that be come into Christ's
sheepfold; Use 1.
If we look to our selves, or our Enemies being so strong, we have cause to
fear, but as Elisha said to his Servant, There are more on our side, 2 Kings 6.
16.
then they that be against us: We have much opposition against our good and
standing, but we are not left to our selves; Our Salvation now is, not as it
was in Adam, but its in Gods keeping, and we are by him kept as in a Castle, we
are kept by his power, which is Almighty, above all power, but how long? for a
few years, and then left to our selves? O if we were left the last year, last
day, last hour, we would fall from God if occasion were offered, but kept we
are by the power of God to Salvation, till we come to Heaven. O let us be
thankful to God for this safe and happy state, and keep our selves close to
him, and continually seek him, and commend our selves to his keeping, and then
we be safe. Here is no cause indeed of security or boldness, for though we
cannot fall finally, yet dangerously, and to our hearts smart we may, if we wax
careless, as many times even Christians come to the sheepfold, yet keep not so
close to their shepherds voice as they ought, but are bold to be straying into
one by-way or other; as of pride, covetousness, contention, and the like, and
this costs them dear, who if they would have been ruled by their shepherds
voice outwardly in his Word, or inwardly in his Spirit, no question they might
have spared this.

2. Let those that be yet wandering, Use 2.
hasten to come home to Christ, and be in this most safe and happy estate; let
them confess, and humble themselves, and seek for pardon, and listen to the
voice of their blessed shepherd Christ Jesus, who calls them to him; if they so
do, they shall make a happy change: But when we require this of a number, they
set light by it, and think they are well enough, and better already; now they
may have their will, and be merry, and speak what they list, and do what they
list, and get gain as they can, but if they should be convert, and be ruled by
the Preacher, they should then be tied too short, as they should do nothing,
have no liberty, but be in bondage, etc. O poor Creatures, that think that
liberty which is deadly bondage; little do those consider, that their sweet
meat (Sin) will have with it a great deal of sour sauce: And the service of
God is perfect freedom, tying from nothing, but from sin, and to nothing, but
that which is good and holy, to our comfort here, and Salvation hereafter, and
does not this shrewdly hurt us? Do not therefore let the foolish and beastly
pleasures of sin keep you from turning to God, for it will be woeful in the end:
If we saw a man going to Execution in brave apparel, with music, and his
companions bringing him bowls of wine, would we delight herein, or count him
happy? would we not rather pity him for all this? more need have they of pity
that will needs run on in sin, and following their lusts and pleasures, refuse
to return unto Christ the Shepherd and Bishop of their souls.

Shepherd, The Ministers of the Word are Shepherds under Christ.
etc.] Christ performs the office of a Shepherd and Bishop to his people,
outwardly by the Ministry of his Servants, the Ministers of the Word, and
inwardly by his holy Spirit: His Ministers be the inferior Shepherds, under the
chief Shepherd Christ Jesus; He uses them to feed his people with green
Pastures, to lead them to the still waters of comfort, to fetch home the
wandering, etc. who are therefore called Watchmen, Ezekiel. 32. 7. 34, 8.
and Shepherds. Its the duty of all Ministers that have the charge of souls,
Their duty.
to be most vigilantly watchful, and exceedingly careful over the people
committed to their care: As watchmen must be careful in keeping the City from
their Enemies; as those shepherds to whom the Angels appeared in the Gospel,
were watching over their Flocks by Night; yea, as Jacob in tending his Flocks,
endured both the cold by night, and the heat by day; so much more must they,
See Act. 20. 28.
in Preaching in season and out of season, praying, holy living, and by all
means seeking to gain men to God, fetching home the stray ones, binding up the
broken, comforting the feeble, etc.

1. This rebukes those Ministers, Use 1.
that in stead of watchmen, are blind, and careless, sleepers, that delight in
sleeping, in stead of shepherds are wolves, devouring the flock, eating the
fat, and clothing themselves with the fleeces: Those as either they cannot
feed, or come not at their flock to feed them; so do they not care to fetch
home them that are astray, but rather by their ill example keep them from
returning; and so far are they from comforting the weak, and binding up the
broken, as they have no skill herein, or list hereto, but rather set themselves
against such: There are but few that make Conscience to hear the Word abroad,
when they have it not at home, yet those are more baited at for going to the
Word, then all they that sit in Aleho^ses, or are gaming or ryoting on the
Lord's Day: Those are also to be reproved that feed with froth in stead of sound
meat, as those that are negligent in feeding, feed them to halves, and half
starve them: O Lord, what shall become of those, when the great Shepherd Christ
Jesus shall come to Judgment? where shall they stand? for even they that have
been most careful, yet are far short; of all men's answers that I know, I would
be loathest to have the answer of a wicked and unfaithful Minister to make.

2. As the Ministers must do their duties, Use 2.
so ought the people like sheep that wander, suffer themselves to be brought
home into Christ's flock and sheepfold, and not let the Ministers labor with
them year after year, and yet they never the nearer being brought home to
Christ: And those that be brought home to Christ, must be careful that they be
led out still, and fed in the green Pastures, that they listen to their
shepherds voice, and follow it carefully, that so the Ministers may yield up
their account with joy, and not with grief, and that is good for the people,
Heb. 13. 17. Thus if we do, God shall have the glory, Ministers the comfort,
and the people shall save their own souls; And the great shepherd shall say to
us, Come ye blessed of my Father, and set a crown of immortal glory upon our
heads.

CHAP. III.
THe Apostle proceeds in his special Exhortations, The Contents of this
Chapter.
belonging to special persons, namely, to Wives and Husbands, showing the
duties which they owe each to other, from the beginning unto the eighth Verse:
Thence unto the eighteenth, he heapeth up diverse general Exhortations to sundry
Christian duties, belonging to all Christians: Thence unto the end he
entreats sweetly of the Passion and Sufferings of Christ, with the benefits
redounding thereby, not only to us, but to the Church in former Ages.

CHAP. III. Verse 1. Likewise ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands,
that if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be won by the
conversation of the wives.
IN this and the following Verses, unto the eight, the duties of wives and
husbands are laid down, and enforced with many fit and weighty Arguments.
Whence note,

1. That Marriage in Gods account is an high and honorable state; Doctor.
all things prove it, Marriage in Gods account is an high and honorable state.
Author, Time, Place, Persons, etc. God has said it; and who can tell the
worth of things so well as the Author and Maker of them? Such are blameworthy
that disgrace it, Heb. 13. 4.
as they are that live basely and dishonorably in it.

2. That both husbands and wives must learn to know their duty, Use.
How else shall they teach their children and servants? Doctor.
God puts children and servants to us as Apprentices, Both husbands and wives
must learn to know their duty.
to be trained up in the trade of Christianity, whom we teach very much by our
good Example. If husbands and wives should not learn their duties, they may
live like a pair of Creatures, not like a pair of Christians.

Touching the wives duties, The duties of wives.
he exhorts them, 1. To subjection, ver. 1. 2. To chastity and reverence,
ver. 2. Then having dissuaded them from curiosity, and over much setting out
themselves in apparel (faults whereunto naturally women are too much addicted)
ver. 3. he persuades them on the contrary to deck themselves rather with
grace, especially meekness and quietness, as not only being in the sight of
God of great price, but that which will hold out; whereas the outward adorning
is corruptible and vain, ver. 4. Those he further presses by the examples of
ancient godly women, ver. 5. and particularly of Sarah, whose daughters they
were if they did perform their duties to their husbands as she did to hers, in
a right manner, namely, for love and conscience sake, and not moved thereto out
of any slavish fear, ver. 6.

Herein our Apostle insisteth the more largely, Why the Apostle insisteth so
largely about the duties of wives.
for that upon his and the other Apostles preaching, That Believers were not to
marry with Infidels, and that some wives which were converted to christianity
brake off society with their husbands because of their beastly and strange
lusts; a slander arose, that the Apostles taught, That wives were not to be
subject to their husbands, especially if they were Infidels; against this our
Apostle here clears himself and his Doctrine.

Thus has it been with Gods Ministers from time to time (even Christ himself
was slandered) and therefore when the like befalls us, Obs.
we must not be discouraged. Gods Ministers have been at all times liable to be
slandered.


But let people take heed how they slander a Minister; for if it be a wicked
part to bear false witness against any man, See 2 Cor. 6.
how much more against a Minister, Use.
being a public person, and whereby much hurt may redound? Such slanderers
work Journey-work for the Devil in an high degree; take heed that you slander
them not out of ignorance, but especially out of malice: Neither censure before
you know the matter fully; Prove. 18. 13.
for, He that answers a matter before he hears it (that is, advisedly
considers thereof) it is folly and shame unto him.

Likewise, etc.] There Is subjection required of Inferiors toward their
Superiors, so of Servants toward their Masters, and here of Wives toward
their Husbands; The prevention of an objection.
but this must be considered according to their places. This I note, because
some base minded husbands do insult over, and abuse their wives in most
tyrannous manner, looking for as much subjection of them, as of any servant or
drudge, which is not the mind of the holy Ghost.

Ye wives, Doctr.
be in subjection to your own husbands,] Here Is required of wives, Wives must
be subject to their husbands
subjection toward their husbands; though God made them in many things equal,
yet in wisdom he thought meet to make some little inequality, and appointed the
husband to be the Superior and Head, and so to rule, 1 Cor. 11. 8, 9.
and the wife to be subject to him; yet not so, but that he has his Rules to
bound his rule, 1 Timothy 2. 13.
that it exceed not. It was Gods will even in the state of innocence, that the
wife should have been subject, though it should have been more willing, free
and pleasant, then it is now (for now its not done without difficulty) but
after the Fall, 1 Timothy 2. 14.
God laid it on her as a punishment, for being deceived, she was first in the
transgression.

This is often required, Ephesians. 5. 22, 23.
and hence it is that the husband is called the wives Head, Col. 3. 18.
and for this cause was the vail, betokening her subjection. Neither is this
without Reason; Reasons.
for if all were equals in the Commonwealth, there would be confusion; and if
all Bells were of a bigness, and all the strings of an instrument of one size,
there would be a harsh sound, and no melody: So were there not some small
inequality between husbands and wives, there could not but be contention. Its
Gods order that wives be subject, as its his order the Sun should shine, the
Earth bear fruit, the Heavens cover us: If these things should not do thus, it
were monstrous; so, unless wives will be Monsters, they must be subject.
Accordingly God has provided to make man the stronger, the woman the weaker
vessel, that he might be the fitter to rule; she (feeling her own weakness) the
more willing to be ruled. This she ought to account an especial mercy, as
having a Head to guide her, who else, having had the rule in her own hand, had
been unable to manage it aright; yea, as this is no servile or base subjection,
but joined with equality in many things (which is signified in her making, not
of man's head, lest she should be superior, nor of his Foot, lest she should be
much inferior, but of his Ribs, to show equality:) So hereby they are freed
from all other subjections, as of Parents, Masters, etc. yea, in many things
are not subject as it were to Law, as for whom their husbands must answer.

This subjection must guide the whole Conversation, Wherein their subjection
consists.
besprinkle the speech, and cause a right Affection and quiet Spirit. This
stands in reverencing their husbands in their hearts, and showing it in words
and behavior, as its in the following Verse: She must also submit her self to
the advice, counsel and direction of her husband for her diet, apparel, etc.
not doing things of her own mind, but with his counsel.

As the Moon has all her light from the Sun, Simil.
so must she have her direction from her husband; and as the great Wheel of the
Clock must guide about all the rest; so must he be to her, and she must not
have a proper motion by her self: If he do any thing, she must take liking, and
not thwart or control the same; nay, if she should know a thing to be better
then that he is about (as concerning removing to this place ot that, buying
this, or selling that, etc.) yet being not in a thing simply unlawful, she must
not cross him (gently persuade him she may) much less stand upon her own wit
and will contrary to his mind: And if she should see him impatient, yet is it
not her part to requite like for like, neither to carry her self unreverently;
nay, though she see he does that which is unlawful, she must not check him at
her pleasure, but by fair means endeavor that he may see and leave the same;
she must also be obedient to all his lawful commands, and frame herself to his
nature and liking, so far as she may with a good conscience: Indeed to consent
to his evil, or to do evil at his command, Acts 5. 29.
that she may not by any means ( for God is to be obeyed rather then man) yet
even in these she must refuse with humility and due respect to her husband:
Though she have a good cause, yet she may handle it ill.

This rebukes the contrary unreverence and base esteem which too too many
wives have of their Husbands; Use.
O how unseemly and stout is their behavior toward them? Not a few having many
good qualities in them, yet are cursed, snappish, stand too stiffly in their own
conceit, will carry away the day, and have the last word, especially if they
have a good cause; such do grossly forget themselves: Whatsoever parts a woman
has, yet if she be not subject and dutiful to her husband, Simile.
they are nothing, she is as a cursed Cow that gives a good pail of milk, and
kicks it down with her foot: Let such endeavor to see this fault in themselves,
and repent thereof from their heart, striving against their froward nature; let
such know, that as subjection is Gods Ordinance, Simil.
so its the very being of a wife. What Is an hand, if it have no power of
handling? or any eye, if it see not? so a wife without subjection: Though there
may be Parentage, Portion, Beauty, Housewifery, etc. yet if this be wanting,
there is nothing of a wife: There are also others which be so unreasonable, so
froward, so mad, and bedlem-like, which do so scold and brawl, as they care not
what they say, Prove. 12. 4.
being a vexation to their Husbands hearts, and corruption to their bones, that
are as it were a whipping stock and house of correction to them continually:
the contention of such is a continual dropping, Prove. 19. 13. and 21. 9.
and it is better to dwell in the corner of a house top, then with such in a
wide house: But hereof I have heretofore spoken at large.

That if any obey not the Word, Doctr.
etc.] Not only must wives be subject that have good Husbands, Wives must be
subject even unto bad husbands.
but even they which have infidel husbands, cross, unkind, and most
irreligious Husbands; for they are their husbands whom they have chosen, and
are now in covenant of God withal, and which God has laid out for them as a
blessing or cross: See Mat. 5. 41.
if any shall say, This is very hard, let such know, that Christians mnst do
difficult things, and such as no other can do, whether Papist, Simile.
Hypocrite, or Civil persons; every Bungler can make good work of good straight
Timber, but he that can make good work of that which is crooked and knotty, is
worthy commendation.

1. This rebukes those that except against their husbands: Use 1.
Oh, will some say, if my husband were as such a woman's husband, kind,
courteous, religious, etc. it would not grieve me to do any thing for him, I
could lay my hand under his feet, but mine is thus and thus. Ans. Ye must not
look what others be, but what your own is; though they fail in their duties
toward you, yet must not you in yours toward them, stoppage is no payment,
Gods Word must be your rule.

2. If they that have such ill husbands, Use 2.
yet must do their duty willingly, how much more they that have loving, godly,
careful husbands? How great is their sin that do not their duty to such, but
are ever finding fault, complaining, murmuring, unquiet? such may justly fear,
lest God take away those, and send them such as will be a cross to them: If any
have found it so, let it lead them to repentance, and let others take heed by
their example.

But howsoever it be necessary for wives to do their duties to unbelieving
husbands, Doctr.
yet it follows not that they may lawfully match themselves with such: Wives
are not to marry irreligious husbands.
This were an unequal match, which is often spoken against in the holy
Scriptures; This were to make league with the wicked and Gods enemies, See Genesis
6. 2, 3
This were the way to pollute our selves; Ezra 9. and 10.
Thus was Solomon himself beguiled: This is the means of a corrupt and sinful
generation, 2 Cor. 6. 14.
for commonly children do follow the steps of their parents; 2 Chronicles. 19. 2
Such as were thus born, Neh. 13. 24.
spoke half the language of Canaan, and half of Ashdod: When both Parents be
godly, their children for the most part prove gracious, God vouchsafing to draw
the thread of his election through the loins of the faithful; when both be
wicked, their children are for the most part ungracious; yea, if but one of
them be wicked, most children prove after the worse side.

Let therefore Parents as they regard their own comfort, Use.
and the well-doing of their posterity, be careful with whom they match them;
and those that intend to marry, let them in their matching not so much regard
wealth, beauty, birth, etc. as Gods fear; yet how many are carried away with
those, not caring to please God herein, matching themselves even with such as
are most irreligious?

But how does our Apostle decipher an unbeliever? Doctr.
by his fruit, disobedience, Such as live in disobedience are unbelievers
he is such a one as does not obey the Word: Whosoever he is that lives in
flat disobedience to any of Gods Commandments, is yet an unbeliever, and
without Faith.

In vain therefore do they boast of Faith, Use.
whosoever they be, that live in open disobedience and known sins.

May without the Word be won by the conversation of the wives.] Doctr.
In general note we, Good examples are excellent preparatives to conversion.
that

Although the work of conversion is to be ascribed to the preaching of the Word
( For faith comes by hearing, and its the Interpreter one of a thousand, Romans
10. 17.
that must declare unto man his righteousness) yet are good examples excellent
preparatives hereunto (as fire that heats the iron, Job 33. 23.
and makes it fit to be fashioned) by them a man may be brought to a better
liking of Religion, Simile.
and of the Word, See Deuteronomy. 4. 6.
and so to the hearing thereof, Mat. 5. 16.
whereby he may be converted. James 3. 13.
David's constant and true carriage of himself toward Saul, 1 Pet. 2. 12.
made him confess he was more righteous then himself. 1 Samuel 24. 17.


Do not we then content our selves with forwardness in profession and other
good gifts, but look that our conversation be such, so holy, modest, godly,
etc. as that we may stop the mouths of the bad, and draw on the backward,
Doctr.
so much as in us lies, and thus shall we adorn the Gospel; Wives professing
religion, must show it by their behavior toward their husbands for their
conversion.
but the contrary in most is every day too too manifest.

In particular, that Wives professing Religion show it in all meekness,
subjection and good behavior toward their Husbands, according to the rule of
Gods Word, may in time be a means to bring home their Husbands to God ( What
know thou, O wife, whether, thou shall save thine Husband? 1 Cor. 7. 16.
says the Apostle) If not, yet they shall so restrain them, as that they shall
be nothing so bad as else they would be, or at least they shall procure their
own liberty to hear, read, pray, etc. when their Husbands shall observe, that
no hurt comes thereby, but rather that all things prosper well.

O therefore let wives labor to be humble and meek; Use 1.
that as David was renowned for delivering Israel out of Goliah's hand, 1 Samuel
18. 7.
they may be much more, by delivering their Husbands through their godly
conversation out of the hands of Satan and Hell: O this is the happiest gains,
to gain men unto God! Thus to put out our talents, will be to our Masters
greatest advantage, and turn most to our glory: some Christians scatter away
from God, through whose ill and undiscreet carriage, God and the Gospel lose
much; Assuredly, such can have but little joy of themselves.

And for Husbands that have such good and godly Wives, Use 2.
let them be careful to be bettered by them, and won to God, else they shall be
brought against them as their Judges; yea, and against such also as live near
them, Heb. 11. 7.
and yet are not bettered by them: They shall condemn them, as Noah did the old
world.

Verse 2. While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.
THis Verse is an exposition and opening of the former, How bad husbands may be
won.
showing how their Husbands should be won, even by beholding their behavior and
life, to be pure, holy, honest, and good, and that not at some times, nor in
some things only, but at all times, and in all things (the neglect whereof
does occasion that their Husbands do often despise their forwardness and
profession of Religion, even because they do not observe them alike
conscionably in every thing, and at all times) as also that they are of them
reverenced and regarded, and that there is in them a loathness at any time to
displease them; These things considered, do much prevail with them: So then,
our Apostle requires two things of Wives, Chastity and Reverence, and that for
that their Husbands would look into these things, and that diligently.

While they behold] A good reason to persuade wives to those virtues; Chastity
and reverence why required of Wives.
they professing Religion, may be sure their Husbands which do not profess the
same, will look narrowly into their behavior, measuring their Religion thereby:
Thus they that be of diverse Religions, look into the lives one of another, as
the Papists do into ours, and we into theirs; we disliking their Religion,
because they make no conscience of an Oath, of the Sabbath day, of soundness in
any duty, etc. as they ours, for that they see many that profess our Religion,
to be dissolute and notoriously wicked (yet have there been at all times some
professors, 2 Timothy 3. 5.
which have denied the power of godliness) so the common sort among our selves,
pry into the conversation of those which seem more forward and eminent in
duties then others.

1. Therefore, Use 1.
It behooves us all to look well to our selves; We are as a city set on an hill,
Matthew. 5. 14.
many eyes be open upon us, the eyes of all the Canaanites and Perizzites in
the Land; when such observe our conversation, not to be answerable unto our
profession, it sets them quite off from the love of Religion, which though it
be their fault, yet we give the occasion.

2. Let Wives that have ill Husbands look to themselves; Use 2.
Their Husbands observe them at an inch, and pry into their conversation, to
take them tardy, for want of subjection and reverence, for want of patience, or
of careful looking to household affairs, etc. that so they may reproach them for
Profession, and cut them short of their liberty: But when after long looking
they find them sound and careful every way, it overcomes their hearts, and
makes them have a reverent opinion of them, and thereupon by little and little
they are wrought upon, and come to the Word, and through Gods blessing grow
unto a love thereof: Happy are those Wives, thrice happy those Husbands that
have such.

Your chaste conversation] Chastity is a part of temperance, What Chastity is,
and by whom it is to be observed.
whereby we keep our bodies and souls pure and undefiled Temples of the Holy
Ghost, and Members of Christ Jesus; This is to be observed through our whole
life, whether in single or married estate: In single estate there must be
abstaining from all uncleanness, not only of the outward act natural or
unnatural, but from all uncleanness of the ear, delighting to hear beastly
speech, of the tongue to utter it, of the eye, so to behold any object as to
lust after it, as also a diligent use of all good means to preserve from these,
till God call to Marriage, and then to embrace that holy and honorable remedy,
which God has appointed for many good uses and ends: In married estate,
Chastity must also be preserved; Wives must be chaste, not only avoiding all
outward and detestable acts of uncleanness with strange men, but even of tongue
or heart, and all the least shows and appearances of immodesty in Countenance,
Gesture, Apparel, Speech, Company, or the like, which might cause suspicion or
jealousy.

This condemns, Use.
as all immodest behavior in Wives, rolling eyes, naked breasts, laying out the
hair, painting the face, wanton talk, and delighting to be in company of
strangers at home or abroad, etc. so especially that foul and odious sin of
Adultery; when the Wife breaking the Covenant of God, and forsaking the guide
of her youth, gives her self to Strangers, O how do such wrong God, Gods
Church, their Husbands, their own Souls! O the Judgments whereunto such are
liable here, and which shall be inflicted on them (if they repent not)
hereafter! As they have burnt in vile lusts against God and his Commandments,
so they shall burn in Hell for ever and ever: Prove. 7. 25, 27.
Their paths tend to death, their houses to Hell and destruction.

Coupled with fear.] How wives ought to fear their husbands
Not a base fear, as to do what she does for fear of his anger, who else would
do as she list, and cross him if she durst (this is forbid in the end of the
sixth Verse) but a reverend regard of her husband, as being her Head, and from
the love she bears to him, being loath to grieve him in any thing, but willing
and careful to please him every way.

This rebukes those wives that set lightly by their husbands, Use.
neither regarding how much they themselves do grieve them, nor how much their
servants do, affording as it were continual matter of grief and unquietness
unto them: Well, be the husband rich or poor, wise or unwise, the wife should
so carry her self, as whereby he may receive most content.

Verse 3. Whose adorning, let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the
hair, and of wearing of gold, or putting on of apparel. Verse 4. But let it be
the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the
ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which is in the sight of God of great
price.
INasmuch as those that be given to pride and excess in apparel be none of the
most dutiful wives, but rather are so puffed up with a conceit of themselves, as
they often fail in the duty of subjection, and are none of the chastest; A
preservative of subjection and chastity.
therefore as a preservative of subjection and chastity, our Apostle forbids
excess and pride in apparel, commanding (for so much is included) modesty and
sobriety in attire. They must not set their minds on plaiting the hair,
wearing of gold, etc. so setting out themselves as it were to sale to the eyes
and view of others, but endeavor to have their souls garnished with grace,
adorned with a meek and quiet Spirit.

Whose adorning, What apparelling it is that the Apostle forbids.
let it not be that outward adorning, etc.] What? does the Apostle forbid
apparelling themselves, or decent clothing themselves, and would he have them
go carelessly and sluttishly, no matter how? 2 Timothy 2 9.
No: he allows decency and moderation in attiring; it must be comely and
decent, how plain soever, but withal, forbids to set their minds too much
thereon, or to be too curious and quaint, or too costly therein.

Of plaiting the hair,] For curled hair, laying out the hair, setting it up
aloft, going naked in it only, and using others hair, not ones own, I leave
the same to be handled and discussed by others, who do daily view the same: In
Country Parishes these are unusual, and rare.

And of wearing gold, Quest.
etc.] Why? is it not lawful to wear costly apparel?

Ans. No doubt its lawful to wear costly apparel, Ans.
Gold, Silver, Pearl, Silk, Velvet, etc. these be the good creatures of God,
not made in vain, Genesis 24. 23, 30
but to be used and worn. Abraham sent Rebekah an abilement, and bracelets of
gold, and she ware them: The Israelites had jewels and golden earrings. Exodus
3. 22.
and wore them by Gods appointment, which they afterward pulled off, and made a
golden Calf thereof, for which they were condemned: Psalm. 45. 9.
The Queen is brought in a vesture of gold of Ophir; Mat. 6. 29. and 11. 8.
and our Savior does not blame, but approve of the Royalty of Solomon, as also
of costly garments in them that be in Kings houses; for as God has ordained
diverse Degrees and Callings, Kings, Nobles, Judges, etc. so that their apparel
should be answerable.

Neither does the Apostle Paul in the forementioned place, How far costly
apparel is forbid, and to whom, and when.
or our Apostle here, simply forbid costly apparel, but the setting of their
minds so much thereon, as that it causes a neglect of decking the soul, as
may appear by the opposition which the Apostle here uses; they set more by
outward apparel, then inward grace, and for this were condemned. Again, they
wrote to Christians which were for the most part but of mean estate in the
world, 1 Cor. 1. 25.
and therefore in them it was riot to wear costly apparel. Besides, these were
times of persecution, when costly apparel did no ways fit; for then their
humiliation was to be declared, as in other things, so even in their attire,
and they were not superfluously to spend what might profitably be bestowed on
the poor members of Christ, whereof there they were great store.

But does not the Prophet Isaiah in his third Chapter condemn the same? Obj.


The Prophet reckoning up their knacks, Sol.
does not simply condemn them all (whereof as there were some mere toys and
vanities, so there were others both good and lawful) but cries down the abuse
of them, their curiosity therein, together with their excessive setting their
minds thereon, where he particularly mentions their pride, haughtiness,
stretched out necks, etc. So that costly apparel of it self is not a sin; Note.
nay, if some should not wear such, according to their ability and degree, they
should sin; as some miserable Misers that go basely, out of covetousness not
affording themselves good clothes: So they that out of Superstition affect to
go raggedly and slovenly, as the Cynicks of old, and the Friars of later times,
who notwithstanding were no less proud then others; as Socrates said to
Antistenes, I see pride through the holes of thy Cloak. Excess then in apparel
is that which is here forbid; which that we may find out, and what it is, let
us lay down some general Rules about apparel, and that will direct us, and be a
ground for that we shall say against excess.

1. We must wear our apparel for necessity, Rules about wearing of apparel.
in respect of the weather.

2. For honesty and comeliness, to hide our nakedness.

3. For honor of the body. 1 Cor. 12. 24.
Our apparel also must be

1. According to our Sex; Deuteronomy. 22. 5.
a man must not wear a woman's, nor a woman a man's apparel.

2. According to our ability; we must cut our coat according to our cloth, so
as we may have whereby to maintain our Families, and relieve the poor.

3. According to our Office and Calling, both to distinguish us from others,
and grace our Calling.

4. Such as may express the virtues of our minds, especially our modesty, 1 Timothy 2. 9.
frugality, and shamefacedness.

5. Framed not after the lighter and vainer sort, but after the example of the
gravest and most sober of our order, Phil. 4. 9.
calling and degree; briefly thus, The matter thereof considered.
it must be for costliness, according to our ability, and as may stand with
discharging all other duties: But even they that may wear rich apparel, yet
ought not to do it daily, because it savoureth of too much pride and vanity,
and disableth the more to do good; it was the Gluttons fault, Luke 16. 19.
That he went gorgeously every day. The manner has bin, to use some more costly

For the manner and fashion of our apparel, The manner.
it must be sober and comely; Women's must not be too near the fashion of Men's
apparel, nor whorish, nor garish: we must not affect this or that country
fashion, whether Italian, Spanish or French, etc. God thereatens to visit all
such as are clothed with strange apparel; Zeph. 1. 8.
they that will not cover their naked breasts, but lay them open to the view of
all, seem thereby to publish and make known the unchastity of their hearts.

This condemns the monstrous excess of these times, Use.
wherein all in a manner have forgot themselves, Gentlemen going like Noblemen,
Yeomen like Gentlemen, Farmers like Yeomen, Cottagers like Farmers, the Maid
like her Mistress, Subjects like Princes: All are out of order, as if pride had
dazzled every ones eyes, whereby mistaking their own, they put on other folks
apparel: This is not the sin of the profane only, but even of professors,
(who with their wives and children are tainted herewith) not of Harlots only,
but even of honest women, who attire themselves like strumpets, so that you can
hardly discern the one from the other: How many spend all they have on costly
attire? yea, numbers pinch their belly to go gay clothed; and now in a manner,
the meanest do in attire exceed the wealthiest in former ages.

And for the fashion (though it be scare lawful at all to take up another
Country fashion, except it be upon some special Reason, and that not too
suddenly, and then to hold it so constantly, as to make it our own by
continuance) what new-fangledness is there? now the French is in request,
within one quarter the Italian, not long after the Spanish, Dutch, Polonian,
etc. so that one were as good make a garment for the Moon, as for our Country
women: How garish also and gaudy are most in their attire, thereby declaring
the vanity of their minds? How immodest are some, going so mannishly, that
they can scarce be discerned from men? as others by their naked necks and
breasts, do as it were set their own honesty to sale. And whereas costly
apparel should be used but seldom, with most its made their every days wearing:
Isa. 2. 11, 12. and 3. 24.
And thus has our plenty and peace bred a great deal of pride and wantonness,
and that is the recompense which the Lord has at our hands, Ezekiel. 16. 49.
which may justly make us fear some heavy hand of God against us (this being
one of the sins of Sodom) as every one that thus sins in particular may fear
Beggary, Deformity, See Christ. Warfare, part. 2. c. 15. p. 375.
or some grievous sickness: Let us therefore repent of that is past, and labor
to reform our selves herein, and for those that be as yet free, let them so
keep themselves.

For 1. God has forbidden garishness and excess in apparel, Reasons against
excess in apparel.
and therefore except we will show our selves not to regard his word, we must
take heed of it: A grievous thing it is, that people can come into the very
house of God, and there sit and hear what is said against it, and

2. If we consider the coming in of apparel, we shall have little Genesis 2. 25.
Besides, we were naked, and not ashamed, when apparel would have been to man's
body as a cloud to the Sun, not to deck, but to darken it (for the beauty of
Gods workmanship had been better then the Tailors workmanship) but when we by
sin had wounded our selves, God was fain to cover it with a plaster; our
apparel then is a badge of our sin, and ought to humble us in the remembrance
of sin: Simile.
Its as a plaster, that shows there is a sore underneath; now who is proud of a
plaster, but rather humbled upon the sight of it? A grievous thing it is to
turn that into sin, that is given us to put us in mind and humble us for sin.
Simil.
If any were adjudged to wear a halter all the days of his life, would he be
proud of it, thought it were of silk; or boast, if he were to wear a silver or
gold shackle? Apparel is a badge of sin, small cause have we to wax proud
thereof how gorgeous soever: They that thus do, are proud in their own shame.

3. Its a most unseemly thing for Christians to put excellency in apparel, Mat.
6. 32.
seek after the same, and the like; but Christians should think themselves best
when they are modestly and lowly attired, attired with grace. We professing our
selves Pilgrims here, ought to live as Pilgrims, and not follow the fashion of
this or that Country in every fangle or garish apparel, and so live as
Citizens or Courtiers of this world: We professing our selves to be traveling
to Heaven, Maa. 7. 13.
must be humble, and stoop low, for the gate is straight, we must not load our
bodies and minds with these things, for they will hinder us in our journey.

4. Its absurd to place excellency in such a thing as apparel, for we Simile.
or if he were put to such a shift, would he be proud of it, or not rather be
ashamed? seeing we be put to borrow of the creatures (so far our inferiors) for
our clothing, having nothing of our own but nakedness, we should not be proud
of it: Besides, when we have done all we can, there be sundry Heathens have
better then we, and many Players, Dancers and Strumpets have as good and
better; Mat. 6. 28.
yea, there is put upon Horses, velvet, gold, etc. and when all is done we are
not so fine as the lilly of the field.

Simile.
Presents of good worth are often lapt up in papers, and so sent: They that
give themselves most to gay clothes, have no leisure nor care to deck
themselves inwardly, therefore are like painted vessels, having a fair outside,
but an empty and mean inside; Simil.
like a Jade with a velvet saddle and gilded trappings: Will any man esteem the
Horse because of them? or will he not rather pull these off him, and then try
what metal he is of? In many men and women their outside is fairest; but if an
house were neatly painted without, and like an Hogsty within, who would not
mislike it?





deck themselves beyond their degree, as that no man of wisdom, or that is
careful to live, dares meddle with them; and so where they might have been
honestly and well bestowed if they had gone decently, their garishness has
made them stay without Husbands, till being ashamed and wearied hereof, they
have at last cast away themselves upon some swaggeres. 3. Against their
Neighbors, in provoking them to the like by their bad example; for when some
begin, others quicklyly follow after, and Pride once begun spreads quickly,
especially where Religion keeps it not down: Hereby also themselves become so
disabled, that their rich Neighbors are not so often invited as before, nor
their poor Neighbors in any good sort relieved.

Seeing then that excess in apparel is so dangerous and prejudicial, Use.
let all such as are faulty this way, endeavor to see their folly and silliness
herein, and accordingly reform themselves; and for those that are modestly
attired, let them so continue: Thus shall they bewray more virtue in their
minds, have more time to serve God, and have better ability to do good upon
every occasion, with more peace to their consciences.

Here I may add such defenses as some women make. Objectious answered.


1. Say they, The 1.
We are not proud, though we delight to set out our selves in apparel as others
do, we are as humble as others, and so we would pray you to think of us.

A. I would we had cause to think so, but how shall we judge of that which is
within, but by the outward fruits? but say it were so, we must not provide for
things honest before God only, Romans 12. 17.
but before men also; Acts 24. 16.
and the Apostle witnesses, that he endeavored to have a conscience void of
offense both toward God and men: Matthew. 5. 16.
Our light must shine outwardly, that others may behold it.

2. Herein we please our Husbands, they will have it so.

A. If any Wives have such vain and foolish Husbands, The 2.
somewhat more is to be yielded to them then to others, but let none make this
their excuse, especially doing the same to please their own minds, neither go
too far, lest they displease God, but rather let them please their Husbands by
their low and dutiful subjection, their modest and sober carriage.

3. We do, The 3.
but what most do. Exodus 23. 2.


A. We may not follow a multitude in evil.

4. We would be content to lay it aside, The 4.
if others would so do.

A. We ought not to tarry for others, we must begin, though none would follow,
which in likelihood they will by our example.

To conclude, as we are to cast away this folly of priding our selves in
apparel, and learn to be modest herein; so let us take occasion of good by
putting on and off our apparel, accordingly making a Spiritual use of the same:
A useful meditation upon the putting on of our apparel, and putting off the
same.
When we put it on, think we of our Spiritual nakedness, and of putting on
Christ; and when we put it off, of putting off the old man, and laying away our
filthy corruptions.

But let it be the hidden man of the heart,] Having forbid carefulness and
curiosity for outward apparel, now he tells them, what they should be careful
to cloth, namely, their inward man, the hidden man of the heart. A remedy for
excess in apparel.
This is a remedy and cure for the former disease; such as set themselves about
this, will spend but a little time for outward bables and toys; Grace will make
them see the baseness of these outward things, and excellency of the other;
yea, this Exhortation is also profitable for those which through covetousness
are not addicted this way, and are ready to cry out against fineness and pride,
who in the mean time being tainted with other sins, have no less deformed and
naked souls; Inward purity required.
the Apostle does not only forbid costly apparel, but requires the inward
purity of the heart, not only that we should leave evil, but do good.

His exhortation is, To deck and clothe the hid and inner man with grace,
whereof he names one, A meek and quiet spirit: The Reasons, 1. Its
incorruptible and lasting: 2. In the sight of God of great price.

The hid man of the heart] Our chief and principal care must be, Our chief and
principal care must be to clothe and adorn the soul.
for the soul to clothe and adorn the same; the soul is the principal part: To
clothe the foot in costly apparel, and the upper parts with rags, were absurd;
so to bestow cost in clothing the body, but none on the soul: The soul is
immortal, Reasons.
must live for ever, either in joy or misery; it was created according to Gods
image, which shined most of all in the soul, and now the soul is most deformed
and ugly with sin, and so has need of clothing, especially seeing God who is
of pure eyes cannot behold it, but with detestation. The Church is all glorious
within, and such as would be indeed members of Christ, and heirs of Heaven,
must look for inward Sanctity. Naturally our souls are defiled with sin,
neither can any thing cover them from the sight of God, but the white raiment
of Christ's Righteousness; Rev. 3. 18.
if we put on this, then shall not our filthy nakedness appear, then shall we
abound in knowledge, wisdom, zeal, humility, patience. This is Royal apparel,
this will keep us from the Storms and Tempests of Gods heavy wrath and
displeasure, that will break out like a whirlwind against the ungodly, who will
be found naked; The more we have of this, we shall appear the more comely and
beautiful before God, his Angels, and all good men; This is the most costly
apparel that can be, of Gods own making, and which none but his children wear;
This is apparel for all Sexes, ages, degrees and callings whatsoever, and which
does well become and fit each of them; neither are great ones to despise it,
for that mean ones wear it, for this does not derogate from its worth, only
they that are Gods people wearing it; This is never out of season, (as serving
both for Summer and Winter) never out of fashion: It fits in Youth, in Age, in
Life, in Death, and is to be worn as well by night as by day, in sickness as in
health, yea, is then in great account, when other apparel is laid aside, and
not regarded; yea, this apparel we carry with us out of this world, when we
leave our gay Robes behind us, and this apparel lasts ever, being the better
for the wearing.

yet have no care of their soul, their minds being altogether led away with
covetousness; there be more ways to Hell then one, even these shall no less
perish, then those which are wholly addicted to costly apparel: As also
This will not serve their turn, Oh, we be not proud, we go plainly; What then?
if thou be covetous, if thou art not careful for the decking of thy soul,
what art thou the better?

It rebukes also those that are very curious and careful for outward attire,
The curious.
but are altogether careless of this inward. How many wear brave clothes, which
have no inward adorning? They savor not of this, they have no leisure for it;
its the inside, and so not seen, but God sees it; men also see it by the
outward, and it will be seen and found naked, when God shall come to Judgment;
such, though outwardly brave, be inwardly base; their souls are not only void
of good, but filled with all evil and noysom lusts; they are like a dead Corpse
stuck with flowers, Simil.
and like painted Sepulchers; yea, like the Heathen Temples, especially the
Egyptians, whose Proches were curiously carved, painted and engraven with gold,
and all the bravery that might by, but within nothing but the base Picture of a
Cat, Crocadile, or some ugly Serpent: How gorgeous soever they are outwardly,
they have not inwardly in their souls the image of God shining in Spiritual
graces, but rather Crocadiles and ugly Serpents, even noysom and beastly lusts,
and so are like a dunghill covered over with Snow: They wanting the inward
beauty of grace to commend them, set out themselves as gorgeously as they can
in apparel; as the Painters servant, Simil.
who being set to make the Picture of a very beautiful woman, and wanting skill
to make the face beautiful, dawbed on a great deal of gold on her clothes.
Those, howsoever they please themselves herewith in their prosperity, yet in
sickness their deep Ruffs must be laid aside, and all their costly toys, and
then what shall comfort them? O their misery at death, but especially on the
day of Judgment! Then shall they for ever be clothed with shame and confusion,
as not being here clothed with grace.

2. Let all therefore be wise, Use 2.
and moderate themselves for outward apparel; if it be comely, and according to
our degree, its well. Herein lets be careful, even to advance and enrich the
soul: This becomes us well, and will assuredly afford comfort in sickness, in
trouble, in death, and on the day of Judgment.

In that which is not corruptible,] Grace is of an incorruptible nature.
Grace is of an incorruptible nature, and abides for ever, and is not taken
away from any that is possessed thereof; it abides in sickness, tarries with us
at death, and we shall carry it with us into Heaven, and wear it there for ever
and ever. This he lays down by way of opposition to outward apparel, that is
vain, transitory, subject to Moths, to be stolen, lost, burnt, worn out, worn
by them that are corruptible, who know not whether shall last longer,
themselves or their clothes, so vain a thing is man.

Such as prefer Grace, Use.
take hold of the substance; as they that prefer costly attire thereunto,
embrace the shadow, take hold of vanity.

The ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit.] A meek and quiet Spirit the proper
ornament of a good wife.
This is a particular virtue most fit for wives: The very proper ornament of a
good wife, is a meek and quiet Spirit; This is the mean to comfort any husband,
and to draw on those that be backward, to a love both of their persons and
profession.

Oh! what a comely thing is it in a wife, not only not to provoke her husband,
but not to be easily provoked by him, winking at small unkindenesses, and
bearing with their natural infirmities; passing by some occasions of grief with
silence, as others with a soft answer? O how pleasing is it for an husband to
have such a wise? how comely is it also for them to be quiet with their
neighbors? no meddlers, no talebearers, or talehearers, void of contention,
gentle and peaceable? so with their family and servants, not to be always
chiding and complaining to their husbands, but governing them in as mild and
peaceable a manner as may be, and especially to be peaceable and quiet with them
in their husbands hearing: They that are thus by grace (for some are of a soft
and still disposition by nature) and so slow to wrath, are of great wisdom:
They are endued with that wisdom which is from above, James 3. 17.
and their meekness is out of the fruits of the Spirit; Then this, nothing
becomes them better, Gal. 5. 23.
if they were clothed with beaten gold and pearls, it were nothing to this.

This reproves those that be cursed, Use.
cruel and vexatious to their husbands, through their continual unquietness:
Such are fit to keep Bridewel, or be Dames of some house of correction, there
were fit objects for their chiding and fighting: Some there are who having no
children or servants to bait at, work their teen upon their husbands, and weary
them not only out of their houses, but out of their lives: Wives were
appointed helpers, but these help their husbands no way, except to their grave:
These certainly have no goodness in them, not refraining their tongue, James 1.
26.
their Religion is vain: They are right fools, for anger rests in the bosom
of fools: Eccles 7. 9.
Let them therefore fight against this vice, mourn under it, and endeavor to be
of a meak and quiet spirit.

Which is in the sight of God of great price.] Here Is the main Reason of the
Exhortation: 1 Pet. ^. 4.
A meek and quiet spirit is of greater value then all the gold of Ophir; its
precious in the sight of God, and therefore must women endeavor for it: The
worth of grace.
None makes or gives it, but God only; no Preacher, Prophet nor Angel can give
grace, can bestow a meek Spirit, it comes from above, whence all other graces
come; its bestowed on none but the Elect people of God. Gold and Pearls are
bestowed on Heathens and profane people, enemies of God, but grace on none but
Kings sons and daughters, and such as shall be heirs of Heaven: As for other
(outward) apparel, its of no worth, trash, dung to this; such is of no account
in the country we go to, no such base stuff enters in at Heavens gate.

But with whom is it of great price? Its of great price in the sight of God.
even with God, and before him in his account, who can rightly value things:
Costly apparel indeed is of value with men (vain and carnal men) but grace is
in account with God, Angels, and all good and wise men: God sees not as man
sees; God beholds all our actions, we must therefore so carry our selves in
our places, as that what we do, may be pleasing in Gods sight, and accepted of
him.

Verse 5. For after this manner in the old time, the holy women also who trusted
in God adorned themselves, being in subjection unto their own husbands. Verse
6. Even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him Lord, whose daughters ye are as
long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any amazement.
HEre are Reasons to enforce the former Exhortations unto subjection, sobriety
in apparel, and attiring themselves with grace, 1. From the examples of godly
women of former ages and times, Reasons of the forementioned Exhortation.
who were thus qualified. 2. From the example of Sarah, who thus behaved her
self toward her husband, whose daughters all such women shall be accounted, as
do imitate her, and that for conscience, doing their duties in a right manner as
she did; such shall be counted among the Saints of God in this life, and in the
life to come shall have the reward of such.

The former is amplified and strengthened by sundry circumstances: The
amplification of either reason.
1. Of the number that so did, not one, but many women. 2. Such as are worthy
to be imitated, as not being of the common sort, but holy women. 3. Their
antiquity, not of yesterday, as though it were new, but ancient, in times past.

In the latter is set forth the manner how this duty is to be performed, namely,
Not for fear of displeasure, but for conscience toward God, and love to their
husbands.

For after this manner, etc.] From the force of the Reason, holy women have done
so, therefore so must you. Note, that

The examples of Gods servants are to be followed in all their virtues: The
examples of Gods servants are to be followed in all their virtues.
The way of Gods Precepts is like an uncouth and bushy way, the way of examples
a beaten way; and herein by setting up his servants as lights to direct us, God
has condescended to our weakness: Were it not thus, See Luke 7. 32
we would say of precepts, Its true, we should do thus, 1 Cor 10. 6.
but who ever did so? God shows us every where who they were: Heb. 11. 4, 5.
and 12 1, etc.
All examples are written for our good, the examples of the godly (as Abels
offering in Faith, Enochs walking with God, Noah's obedience, Moses his
mildeness, Jobs patience, etc.) for our imitation; the examples of the ungodly
and their punishment for our evitation; yea, even in our own times God
presents diverse unto us, that they which belong unto him may be drawn on by
the light of precepts and examples together, as others left without excuse, who
do not such and such duties, which are to their knowledge by others performed.

This rebukes those that follow the evil, Use.
but do not imitate good examples, neither are any whit moved by them: Those
can make use of the frailties of Gods children mentioned in Scripture, to
encourage themselves in evil; Did nor David commit adultery? was not Noah
drunk? and did not Rebekah cause Jacob to lie? etc. will they say: Such wrest
the Scriptures to their own destruction. So among our selves, if any be bad and
licentious, they shall have enough to follow them; but as for the examples of
the godly, they little prevail, nay, people are so far from following them,
that they mock and disdain them, yea, term them Hypocrites, Precise fools, and
the like: Well, let such make as light of them as they will, God will not lose
his labor, and his light set up: They that make them not now their pattern for
imitation, shall find them one day their Judges to condemn them, Heb. 11. 7.
as Noah did the old world: As the Ninivites against the Israelites; Mat. 2. 41.
so many a husband shall rise up against his wife on the day of Judgment, and
many wife against her husband, as many a man against his neighbor; and justly,
for its clear that those love darkness and to wander, which will neither be
guided by precept nor example, whereas God might only give us precepts, and
yet require obedience: Its true, all shine not alike; some have their light
dimmed for a time, through some unbeseeming act; howsoever, there is not the
example of any whereby we may not receive some profit.

In the old time,] The Antiquity of the examples, are an enforcement or
inducement to follow them; but how, simply because they be ancient? No: but
holy men did thus, and well they did, and that long ago; He does urge them to
follow examples only upon Antiquity, but because they were good also. Note
then, That

Antiquity joined with verity, Antiquity joined with verity, is reverend, and
to be followed.
is reverend, and to be followed: If a truth in judgment or practice of life
be ancient and gray headed, its the more honorable, and to be followed; but if
an opinion or practice be wicked, though never so ancient, its vile, and to be
detested, and is not the better, but much the worse for the antiquity of it:
The older, the more time it were quite banished out of the Land, Town, House and
Heart.

This condemns the Church of Rome, Use.
and all such as plead bare antiquity only, it has been thus and thus long,
will they say; ours is the old Religion, and yours is the new: No, ours is
ancientest from the beginning, whereof were the Patriarchs, Prophets, Christ
and his Apostles: Their stories mention when and how theirs began, increased
and grew, out of an heap of Ceremonies of the Jews and Gentiles mingled
together, one Pope devising one thing, another adding another; Though error and
wickedness may be very ancient, yet truth and goodness has the start of it,
the truth was before sin entered into the world, this therefore is no good rule;
this is ancient, therefore its to be followed, nay, is it also good? Its else
nothing: Many Papists have nothing to say, but thus did our Fathers and
Grandfathers, etc. but they never enquire by the Word, whether they did well or
not, 1 Pet. 1. 18.
whereas our conversation may become wicked through the tradition of our
Elders: So among our selves, if any be reproved for this or that, they will
answer, It has been done thus these forty years; It was so ere you came, and
will be when you are gone; If it be a wicked and unlawful custom, why plead you
for it? Its more then time it were banished, it stinks; because thus they did in
darkness, therefore we should so do in the light, what folly were this? They
will not do so in worldly things, as apparel, diet, building. They were wont to
go in hose and stockings all of one, and have no chimneys in their houses, who
will now do thus? yet better retain those, then bad and unlawful customs.

Holy women] There has always been a company of holy women in the world as
well as of men, There have been always holy women in the world as well as men.
and why not? both were made after Gods image, at first equally good, and in
the fall, both are equally corrupt, and the children of wrath, and in the
recovery have equal right to Christ, to the Gospel, to Grace, to Sanctification
and Holiness. Reasons.


Men have no privilege this way; Grace had been as well bestowed on them, (as
in the Old Testament, on Sarah, Rebekah, Rachel, Deborah, Jael, Hannah, Naomi,
Abigail, etc. and in the New, on the three Mary's, Elizabeth, Lidia, Dorcas,
with sundry others) as on men.

Women also were as forward to maintain Christ, to follow him, to bury him, and
Christ after his resurrection first appeared to them. Our own experience also

Shows, Why women are as forward as men.
that in most Congregations women be as forward as men in frequenting the Word
and Sacrament: And why not? 1. They are of a timorous nature, and so more
easily wrought upon by the Word, and by Gods Judgments. 2. They keep at home,
not seeing or hearing the abominations that be abroad. 3. They have many
crosses and pains, sicknesses, and Childe-bearings, putting them in mind of
death, and drawing them near to God, and so furthering their Salvation.

1. This serves to stop the mouths of such idle heads as take pleasure to
disgrace women. Use 1.


2. It serves to encourage women and to comfort them: Use 2.
There have been ever good women, women therefore must stir up themselves to
increase the number, especially having more means then those had in former
times.

And needful it is that there should be good women as well as good men; Its
needful there should be good women.
1. For their own sake, who have souls to save or destroy. 2. That there might
be an holy seed to make up the number of the Elect; good Mothers bringing up
their children well, and good Wives being helpers to their Husbands both in
soul and body.

As for those women that be wicked, unclean, profane and ungodly,
notwithstanding the fearfulness of their nature, their keeping at home, and
their manifold crosses, What would they have been if they had been men? They
would have been monsters, and of such women-monsters, Hell is as full as of
men-monsters.

Note further, Holiness is that which commends one
That he says not, wealthy women, fair women, but holy women; Here Is the
ground of his commendation: A little holiness is better then a great deal of
riches and beauty; Prove. 31. 30. and 20. 15.
That that is to be desired of a man, is his goodness; Beauty fades with
sickness, wealth has many ways to take it away, but grace holds ever to life
eternal, and commends before God, Angels, and good men: Therefore when God
threatened to take the wealth from the rich men of Jerusalem, Isa. 4. 3.
and gay clothes from the women, yet says, he will make them amends, How?
Every one shall be called holy; They shall so profit by their affliction, as
where it might have been said, Yonder goes a rich man, yonder goes a fair
woman, a woman in costly apparel; now, Yonder goes a godly man, a virtuous
gracious woman: This is commendation indeed, and for this we ought to labor,
that we may have our part herein.

Again, Marriage no hinderance to godliness.
He calls them holy, though they were married; Marriage hinders not holiness,
nor is single life more holy then it: Its the holy Ordinance of God, Heb. 13. 3.
and the bed undefiled: The gift also of continence and single life, is
sometimes given to carnal worldlings, and profane persons, but denied to Gods
dear Servants, by whom he will increase his Church and Kingdom.

This condemns the Church of Rome; Use.
Oh, they extol single life, and disgrace Marriage, as if it were a living in
the flesh: O their vile hypocrisy! they would seem holy, and yet maintain
Stews openly; yea, some of them have written in defense of Sodomy, and for
Fornication and Adultery; the infinite skulls of murdered Infants (the fruit
of their Whoredoms) found near the Dens of their abode, witness how unholy they
are. The Pope would be Peter's Successor, yet was he a married man: Till God
call us to marriage, we are to live in single estate purely; Luke 4. 39.
when we are married, soberly and holily: If we be single, we are not the more
holy, or if married, the less holy.

But how could they be holy in those days? Holiness comes by Faith in Christ.
By Faith in Christ, whereby their hearts were purified, they severed from the
world to the Lords use.

There Is no Sanctification, no Salvation, but by Christ: Now Christ is more
clearly revealed then he was in those days, more holiness is therefore now
expected; all ignorant, unbelieving, impenitent, and unholy women are in a
fearful case, especially considering the means. The Lord will one day present
these holy women, Look you here, here be women, that in the dawning of the day
saw Christ, and you have lived in the Sun shine of the Gospel, and have not
believed.

He calls them holy, Holiness may be where there are weaknesses.
though they had their weaknesses, as Sarah had; so that we are not to account
those as not holy that have imperfections, for God accepts of Believers in
Christ, and pardons their imperfections.

This therefore corrects the over harsh spirit of those, Use 1.
which cry down our Church as unholy, and a Synagogue of Satan, and no Church,
because of some blemishes: Our Savior did not so, but more charitably calls
Jerusalem, Rev. 11. 2.
The holy City, which indeed was the Church, though stained with many blots of
error and bad life.

It comfort also those that be truly sanctified, Use 2.
and upright in heart, notwithstanding their imperfections and failings, God
accounts you Saints and righteous persons.

Adorned themselves, etc.] Of those duties which they did perform, I have
already spoken; observe we only this, how they came to do their duties thus;
he shows they were holy and godly women, and so performed the same. Note
then, that

Wives cannot perform their duties aright, Wives cannot perform their duties
aright, unless they be holy.
unless they be holy; no being a good wife, till a good Christian; no building
of a godly life on any foundation, but upon Faith in Christ: Whosoever would do
their duties aright, to Gods glory, their own comfort, and another good, they
must fetch and draw grace from Christ by Faith; they that think to do
otherwise, build in the Air, build that which will fall on their heads, and
which will never hold or continue.

Even as Sarah] He speaks of many, Why more good men be mentioned in Scripture,
then good women.
and yet names but one, yet such a one as they could not but acknowledge worthy
of imitation: Though more good men be mentioned in Scripture then women, that
was, because of Genealogies, and their public places, not that their number
was greater then the others; yet of neither of both are so many named by
multitudes, as were in all those ages: God said, he had Seven thousand which
had not bowed their knee to Baal; and its said, That at our Apostles Sermon
Three thousand were converted, yet none are particularly named. Heb. 11. 32.
In Heb. 11. some are named, with their actions and commendations, but that
there were multitudes of others, is there also employed.

When therefore we read the Scriptures, Use.
we must not think that there were no more good people then we find there
named: Oh! there were many thousands more; only so many are Registered as might
be for our good, Simil.
all could not: As when we come out of a City or great Town, looking back, we
see the tops of a few Steeples and great houses, but when we were near we saw a
great many more; so when our backs are turned upon an Age, alas, its but a few
we can see then, in comparison of them that lived in that age: Howsoever, be we
of men remembered or not, if we be holy men and women, we shall not be forgotten
of God; our Names are Registered in Heaven, whether one day our bodies shall
come, as well as our souls.

Obeyed Abraham, Gen 18. 6.
calling him Lord,] That she obeyed him, the story shows; for whithersoever he
went and flitted, she went with him; and when she was bid make ready for the
strangers, it was done, and that speedily, not a word against it; and her
calling of him Lord, is here mentioned as an usual thing done by her,
proceeding from a reverend regard she had of him, as her husband appointed her
of God.

In all things lawful, Wives must imitate Sarahs obedience and reverence.
wives must be like Sarah, therein (though happily somewhat against their mind)
they must frame themselves to their husbands disposition: They must not speak
to them snappishly, currishly, curstly, nor over familiarly, calling them by
their Christian Names, but respectively and reverently.

Whose daughters ye are, Reasons hereof
as long as ye do well,] Such women as live godly, purely, be subject, adorn
themselves with grace, and are patient and meek, they shall not lose by it, but
shall have peace to their Consciences, and a good Name in the Church, as Sarah,
and be heirs of Heaven, as she is; being like her, they shall speed as she did:
As men Believers are called, The Sons of Abraham, he being the father of the
faithful; so all godly good wives, The Daughters of Sarah that holy Matron,
that had a good Name in the Church while she lived, Use.
and is now in Heaven.

Let this be a provocation to women to perform these duties: I hope we give you
no bad counsel, neither wrong you, in requiring of you but what Sarah did, and
to do what may make you like her here and hereafter; what answer shall those
make that are no whit moved hereby? ungodly, impatient, immodest women are not
daughters of Sarah, Neh. 7. 64.
but of that wicked one the Devil, and with him shall have their portion: As
they that could not prove their Pedigree had no portion in Canaan, so they that
fetch not their Petigree from Sarah, and be not her daughters in subjection,
pure conversation, sweet speech, quietness in spirit, are not good wives, nor
shall have the blessing of such.

And are not afraid with any amazement.] It may be Christian wives were afraid,
that if they did not set out themselves in bravery of apparel, their
unbelieving husbands would not care for them, but seek after others: For this
the Apostle prescribes a remedy; let them not yield to do evil for avoiding
that, but trust in the Lord, not being afraid with any amazement. Its not
enough to do duties, but we must do them in a right manner.


Its not enough to do duties, but we must do them in a right manner; that makes
or mars. Hence many in doing duties to God, do them not; in praying, they pray
not; hearing, they hear not, because not from the heart, in Faith, but out of
custom, and in ceremony and formality: Wives must not be dutiful, because else
they should lead a woeful life, their Husbands would cut them short in their
will, etc. These are carnal respects for Heathens to be moved with; but
Christian women must be dutiful, out of conscience toward God, and love to
their Husband, as they whom God has appointed to be their heads.

Verse 7. Likewise ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, giving
honor unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of
the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.
NOw he comes to the duty of Superiors, particularly of Husbands, whom he only
names; for that he that is a good and godly Husband to his Wife, will be also
a good Magistrate, or Minister, if he be called to those places. Superiority
exempts not from duty.
And in that he teaches Superiors their duties, we may note, That Superiority
exempts them not from duty; every honor carries a burden along with it: The
more high any is in place, the more is expected of him, as more was of him that
had the five, then of him that had the two talents; as they look for much duty
from others, so not a little is required of themselves: Every Superior should
make his Inferior more beholding to him, then he can possibly be to his
Inferior, even Inferiors may be as dear unto God as themselves are; Col. 4. 1.
And they themselves have a Lord and Master in Heaven to call them to an
account: The Word also does no less ininstruct them in their duty, then the
others in theirs: No man holds his place to be idle, but the greater it is, the
more is required of him; The Word must guide them in their places, they must
not do as they list.

Likewise ye Husbands, Wherein the husbands duty consists.
etc.] In other places the Husbands duty is set forth by love (no love, no
husband, a man, not an Husband) but here by the fruits, which are, 1. To dwell
with their Wives. 2. As men of knowledge and understanding. 3. To give them
honor; and that, 1. Because they be the weaker vessel. 2. Heirs with their
Husbands of Grace and Salvation. 3. The contrary would breed unquietness, and
so interrupt and hinder their Prayers together, which were grievous.

Herein he instructs Husbands (as before he did the Wives) they standing in
no less need of instruction, Husbands stand in no less need of instructions
then Wives.
and no less failing in their duty then Wives, who therefore must humbly,
patiently, and christianly hear their duties, with a desire to be ruled
accordingly.

Dwell with them] The Husband must forsake Father and Mother, Husbands are to
dwell with their Wives.
and cleave to his wife; they must keep together for all the marriage ends, the
procreation of Children, the avoiding of sin, and keeping themselves chaste,
and for the continual comfort they ought to have each of other in prosperity
and adversity, for body and soul; and this is for the continuance and increase
of love. True it is, In what caces they they may be absent.
the Husband may be absent from his Wife, either by the commandment of his
Prince, being employed in any service, whether in Church or Commonwealth, or
upon his own necessary affairs, as Merchants and Mariners, or upon mere
necessity, as many dwelling in one place, do yet work in another, yet must not
he fail in his absence to pray for her, to keep himself chaste, to have her as
it were still present with him, sending to her as often as he can, and
returning as speedily as he may: Also if any contagious disease should be, they
may (with mutual consent) part for a while; It must be matter of weight must
keep them any time asunder, not any unkindeness, yea, though both be willing to
dwell asunder; Matthew. 19. 6.
For whom God has joined together, no man must sunder: And as they may keep in
one house, so one bed and board must hold them; therefore it is that she is
said to lie in his bosom, and, Let her breasts satisfy thee at all times.
Prove. 5. 18, 19.


1. This condemns all unlawful partings of Husband and Wife, Use 1.
as of the Jews which put away their Wives when they took dislike of them,
Matthew. 19. 8.
by giving them a Bill of divorcement; This came of the hardness of their
hearts, but was not so from the beginning: Of sundry in our times which live
asunder, as have been married young through some sinister respects of their
Parents, or rashly or inconsiderately, though come to years of discretion,
which afterward they have disliked, neither party loving the other according
to Gods Ordinance; of those Husbands that idly give themselves after marriage
to travel to see Countries and Fashions, thus exposing as well themselves as
their Wives to Satan's temptations: 1 Cor. 7. 5.
Of those that for the most part haunt Inns, Alehouses, and Taverns, Gusling,
Gaming and Whoring, being but seldom at home; If the Husband is to leave Father
and Mother, much more such places, to cleave to his Wife: Of those which
following their Recreations and Pleasures, put all upon their Wives, chiding
them for whatsoever is done amiss by Servants or others; those prove cruel
taskmasters to their Wives, like Pharaoh's to the Israelites: were it not
better for such (their businesses being over) to read, confer, and lovingly
converse with their Wives? and should not their company be better to them then
all companies in the world?

2. This condemns those that part boards (the Husband being either so proud,
Use 2.
as he thinks his Wife not good enough to sit with him at Table, or she so
unquiet, that he eats by himself, each Hog in his own Trough) yea and beds too,
and that either continually, or upon discontent for some time, or upon
surliness, and overmuch coyness; when the Husband will not be troubled with the
childs crying, etc. as if he were not sometimes to bear such marriage
troubles, but lay all upon his Wife.

3. This condemeth the marriage of Children, Use 3.
who must be kept asunder many years; This comes from the excessive haste of
Parents, which dare not trust God for a marriage rich enough, till they come of
years, but thus prevent the Lord: Such think they work wisely, but for the most
part, its but foolishly: They think thus to build their houses, but for the
most part it proves their ruin, such seldom loving one another. Husbands must
be men of understanding.


According to knowledge,] Husbands must be men of understanding and knowledge
in the Scriptures, and grounds of Christian Religion, that they may do good to
their wives and whole family: They are the head, therefore must be able to
guide; the eye, therefore must see: Mat. 6. 22.
If the eye be dark, all must needs be dark; as the ointment on Aarons head ran
down on his beard, Psalm. 133 2.
and thence to the skirt of his garment, See 1 Cor. 14. 35.
their knowledge must be exercised for the good of their wives, and the meanest
in their family. In what particulars the same will appear.
They must be men of knowledge: 1. To instruct them in the ways of God, to pray
with them, and (especially when through weakness or sickness their wives have
been forced to stay at home) to inform them of such Points as Adam, Sampson and
Ahab failed, but Job in rebuking his wife, showed he was a man of knowledge. 6.
To bear

1. This condemns the common abuse of this Land; Use 1.
How few husbands be men of knowledge, able to instruct, comfort, advise,
govern or admonish their wives? how few able to pray with them, repeat a sermon
to them, or comfort them in any of their heavinesses? Hence it is, that they
burden their wives with needless things; Hence many women of some good parts
and towardness, matching with such Worldlings and Ignorants, have been undone;
Hence so many jars and contentions in families: How many wives would perform
their duties, if their husbands would go before them in performing theirs? O
what evils might be avoided if husbands had but discretion! but most are void
of understanding, cannot give a reason of their Faith, cannot pray in their
families, scarce give thanks for their meat, check and discourage their wives
from goodness, if they have any inclination thereto: Alas, in these days, if
they get a little hair on their faces, and their portion into their hands, they
think themselves fit to marry, though they have neither wit nor understanding;
or if they stay some years, its to get goods to set up with, not that they may
be furnished with knowledge. Parents enquire after wealth, and how their
daughters shall live, but do not much regard their living with men of knowledge.

2. This condemns the Papists, Use 2.
which forbid the Layety to read the Scripture: But where is knowledge to be
learned, if not by them? Its enough with them that their Priests have
knowledge, yet must not they marry.

3. For those that are married, Use 3.
and have failed herein, let them redeem the time: 1 Timothy 5. 8.
If he be worse then an infidel that provides not bodily maintenance for his
family, then what is he that provides not spiritual?

For those that are to marry, let them beg for wisdom, and labor for knowledge,
that being married, they may live Christianly, and according to knowledge.

For parents, let them instruct their sons in knowledge, and before they
provide them wives, let them know indeed that they are men of knowledge; and
for those that have daughters to marry, let them not so much aim at wealthy
husbands, as with those which may live with their daughters according to
knowledge.

Giving honor unto the wife,] What honor the husband is to give to his wife.
The honor which is here prescribed, is not Divine honor ( Peter would none of
it at Cornelius his hand, nor the Angel at John's) nor that honor which an
Inferior is to give to his Superior (whereof we may read in the fifth
Commandment) but such as a Superior may give to an Inferior (so is the wife in
some things) but as anunequal to his equals, Acts 10. 26.
so is the wife in many things. Rev. 22. 9.
This comprehends diverse things:

1. That the husband is to respect and esteem his wife, Sundry particulars
employed herein.
as of a most comely, necessary and profitable instrument, appointed of God as
a

Genesis 31. 4.
yea oftentimes (that he may not despise her) she more then he: Jacob sent for
his wives into the field, and conferred with them about his journey: Many
husbands have confessed, that if they had taken their wives counsel, it had
gone better with them. Naaman heard his servants advise, 1 King. 5. 14.
and followed it, much more should the husband the wives: Genesis 21. 14.
Abraham heard, and yielded to Sarah about Hagar and Ishmael; such are indeed
injurious to their wives, that will never make them of their counsel.

3. That according to his ability he is to allow her competent maintenance

4. That he is to give her a fit employment for her place: It were

5. That he do not over burden his wife, or require more of her

6. That he must not reprove her before company, no not before her

7. That he ought not to take part with Child or Servant when she

8. That he is to use her lovingly and kindly, Reasons hereof
not proudly, tyrannously, Ephesians. 5. 25.
yet is he not to use it as he list, but as God prescribes.

What may not incite husbands hereunto? God requires it, they are their own
flesh; Col. 3. 19.
Christ loved his Church dearly, as accordingly they are to love their wives;
She has forsaken all for him, and he has chosen her from all others; Her
Friends entrust her with him, and expect kindeness at his hands; He promised
the same at the time of his Marriage, before God and the Congregation: This
also will provoke her to her duty, and so further a comfortable living
together. Whosoever then regards the Commandment of God, and will suffer it to bear
^way with them, or their Covenant and Promise, must thus honor their wives.

This condemns 1. Those Monsters which not only lade their wives with Curses
and Railings, Use 1.
but abuse them also with blows and heavy strokes, Sundry sorts of husbands
reproved.
oftentimes in their drunken fits shurting them out of doors; these be bruit
beasts (when knew you the Cock spur the Hen?) Devils in the shape of men: Its
marvel their Neighbors take them not and bind them for mad men; for none but
mad men beat themselves and their own flesh, whom Bedlam or Bridewel would fit
better, then to be at liberty, unless they could use it better. 2. Those
(though not altogether so bad as the former, yet) can lend their wives a box on
the Ear, or a dowse on the Neck, or a spurn with their foot. 3. Those which
though they can rule their hands, yet are so hoggish and churlish to their
wives, as they know not how to please them, ever unquiet, 1 Samuel 25. 17.
and like Nabal, so wicked, that one cannot speak to them, yea, will both rail
on them, and revile them. 4. Those that sometimes be pleasant, and use their
wives well, who yet at small things will be so hot and angry, as they break out
into unseemly, harsh and bitter words, that vex and grieve the spirit of their
wives: This argues much weakness in the heart; Eccles. 7. 9.
Anger rests in the bosom of fools; and, He that is hasty to wrath, Prove. 14.
29.
exalts folly, as, He that is slow to wrath, is of great wisdom. Such sharp
and unkind speeches fall out sometimes between those that love well, and be
good Christians, but its their fault, and matter of humiliation. Neither let
any please themselves with this, that they are quickly pleased again, for they
may speak such words in their fits, as can hardly long after be forgotten, they
may pierce so deep, that the wounds made thereby are not soon healed, and when
healed, Objections answered.
not without scars; yea, its a matter of reproach among men, to be counted
hoggish and unkind to one's wife.

Obj. Oh, but my wife is froward, and speaks to me otherwise then she should;
thus and thus provokes me, not without cause I do thus and thus to her.

A. If our wives had no infirmities, The 1.
they were worse then beasts that would misuse them (and yet there be some who
have very good wives, whom notwithstanding they use but untowardly) and if they
had no imperfections, what need had we of patience? Having imperfections, shall
we take hold of every little frailty? Its presupposed that husbands should be
stronger then so; and does not Christ bear with the infirmities of his Church?
Beside, wives have many times occasions to distemper them, as frowardness of
children, untowardness of servants, sickliness, etc. and they are otherwise
good wives, love us well, be careful for our state, bring up our children well,
and so should be born with; nay, have not we our selves some one or other
infirmity that they are feign to bear with?

Obj. Oh, then we shall have enough of it, we shall never have done; therefore
better hold them to hard meat, and make them smart for it, etc.

A. This lesson was not learned in Christ's, The 2.
but in the Devils school; for God bids us bear with one another infirmities;
Gal. 6. 2.
and, James 3. 17.
The wisdom from above is peaceable and gentle; mildeness also and loving usage
shall prevail more, and do more good, then cruelty and severity: Many a good
man that has had an impatient wife, by his grave admonitions, godly life,
patience and Prayers, has obtained, that she has proved a very good woman.

Obj. Oh, but my wife will not yield to any good order, cares not for prayers,
neglects her Family, brings up her children idly, etc.

A. Here Is wisdom, The 3.
as not to see God dishonored by suffering evil, so, not to break love, or
disturb peace: We must in Gods matters hold our authority and Gods right,
though in all our own matters we yield; Exodus 4. 14.
the contrary had like to have cost Moses dear: We may not buy peace on such
hard conditions, yet in such cases we must rather persuade then enforce, show
what the Word of God says, use Reasons and Arguments to this purpose; yea, if
need be, denounce Gods wrath and judgments, which notwithstanding ought to be
done in private and love, without carnal bitterness: We may be earnest, yet not
impatient; and if we perceive any little amendment, take knowledge of it, and
thereupon encourage them, pray for them, instruct them with meekness, waiting
while God give them an heart to repent, and in good sort to comply with their
husbands.

As unto the weaker vessel,] Wives are the weaker vessels.
Here Is the first Reason to enforce the former duty, Wives are the weaker
vessels: They are weaker in body then men, weaker also in mind, timorous, and
fearful, soon discouraged, soon provoked, quickly take hurt, and are quickly
out of temper.

God has done this a purpose, Reasons.
it was so from the beginning, that the wife might the more willingly submit,
and its necessary for peace and order, that one rule, and the other submit,
which that the Wife may do, and be glad of an head and guide, she is made the
weaker vessel; yet are not Wives so weak, but God has given them competent
ability of body, and mind to go through with their duties, and as they be the
weaker, so they have the weaker works (except bearing of children, which they
brought on themselves by sin) then men, theirs being for the most part within
doors.

1. Hereupon let Wives submit themselves the more willingly, Use 1.
and the weaker they find themselves, let them trust the more on God, that
they may be strong in him.

2. For Husbands, Use 2.
let them use their Wives kindly, being weak; they must not grieve them, nor
disquiet them to their undoing; they be good, costly, and very profitable
vessels, for excellent use, but easily cracked, therefore had we more need have
the more care of them, as we have of some choice glass. Simil.
A Gentleman will not put his Watch or Clock into the hands of Children or
Fools, nay, he thinks that he is scarce wise enough to handle it himself, What
discretion then and wisdom is needful in Husbands about their Wives?

3. This rebukes those that use their Wives ruggedly, Use 3.
and curstly, sometimes railing at them, other times beating them, whereby many
good Wives are spoiled. Simil.
A Venice glass well used and looked too, may last long, so may a good Wife, but
some use them so hoggishly, as they are not like to last long; some vex and
grieve their Wives, that they pine away with sorrow, What an account have these
to make? justly may God punish such, by taking away their good Wives, and
sending them such as may be scourges to them.

And as being heirs together of the grace of life.] Wives be no less heirs of
the grace of life then their Husbands.
The second Reason, from the honor whereunto God has advanced them; They be
Kings daughters, Heirs of eternal life no less then men; They have the same
right to Heaven that men have, and so to the means, Christ Jesus, the Word,
Sacraments, Prayer, Faith, Repentance, Sanctification: God has herein made
them equal, so as that there be holy women as well as men; so all believing
women be the daughters of God, and so his Heirs, Heirs of the grace of life:
Among men, sons (not daughters, if there be any sons) be Heirs, and not all
neither, but one; but God, though he has many sons, yet does also make all his
daughters Heirs. But of this on verse 5.

1. This should make women content with their state, Use 1.
and thank God highly; though they be appointed to be subject to their
Husbands, and be also the weaker, yet seeing God has made them equal in the
greatest matters, they may rest satisfied, especially seeing even those things
also, wherein they might seem abused, are much for their good.

2. It may provoke them to labor for their part in grace, Use 2.
and means of glory, God has not excluded them, they must not exclude
themselves: A grievous fault it is in a number of women, that they regard not
goodness, as though being poor women especially, little were required of them;
But have they not souls to save as well as others? must they not come to Heaven
the same way as others? and as they be wives and mothers much is required of
them.

3. For husbands, Use 3.
let them use their wives exceeding respectively, seeing God has so honored
them: To abuse Gods daughters, his heirs, is grievous. If a man had an Heathen
woman to his wife, he ought to use her well, much more being a Christian: The
more grace any woman has, the more kindly must she be used; such are Kings
daughters, heirs of the King of Heaven.

That your prayers be not hindered.] The third Reason: Using them ill will breed
Contention, and so make them unable to pray at all, or pray amiss. Here note,

1. That the husband should pray with his wife (God takes it here for granted)
and that also constantly; Husbands should pray with their wives.
the course of their prayers must by no means be broken off.

This is their daily homage to God; Reasons.
they have daily need of pardon, grace, protection, direction in all their
affairs, all which must be prayed for: This has promise of blessing, and
herein all Religion is contained.

This condemns most husbands, Use.
that never pray with their wives; they have no skill nor will hereto, Psalm.
14. 2.
an argument of a profane man, void of all Religion, dead in sin; for where
there is the least spark of grace, there will be crying to God. How do these
live? as much Religion in their Hogs-coats, as in their houses, they live like
Swine; most Families, in stead of being little Churches, be Herds of Swine,
which live as if there were no God: How do these look for a blessing? God has
promised none but to them that ask it; what common blessings they enjoy, they
enjoy not as fruits of their Prayers; If we desire to be accounted religious,
and would have any blessing of God, let us learn to pray.

2. That whatsoever would interrupt our Prayers, Whatsoever may interrupt our
prayers is to be avoided.
is carefully to be avoided: Thus as we are to avoid worldliness, an ill
conscience, and the like; so also contention and wrangling, both with our
neighbors, and wives: That party is unfit to Pray, whose heart is poisoned with
wrath and malice; the Prayers of such are loathsome, being thus, our Sacrifices
will not be accepted at Gods altar: O what a grievous thing is it to lose our
prayers? What else have we to help our selves with? What judgments does not
prayer remove? What blessing does it not obtain? greatly does he lose, that
loses the benefit of his prayers.

Therefore let us beware of contention and strife, Use.
especially with our wives: Let us always keep our hearts calm and fit to pray;
Who knows what need he may have of prayer, and that more then ordinary? As men
keep their Horses for service in plight and breath, so keep we our prayers in
good tune; Simile.
keep we them as a Pinnace ready to send out speedily, and come home laden,
else we may miss many a good purchase.

Verse 8. Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of another,
love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous, Verse 9. Not rendering evil for
evil, or railing for railing; but contrariwise blessing, knowing that ye are
thereunto called, that ye should inherit a blessing.
NOw he comes to certain general Exhortations, that concern all sorts and
states whatsoever, and they tend to love, and a peaceable and comfortable
living together one with another.

Be ye all of one mind,] Not that he would have these Jews to be of one mind
with the Idolatrous and profane Gentiles amongst whom they lived, but that
being converted and believing Jews, they would all consent and agree together,
in the matters of Faith, and Religion of Christ, that they would all embrace
the Lord Jesus, the only Foundation; and that some only should not look for
Salvation by him, some by the Law, and some by both, but that all should seek
unto him alone: And as they were thus to agree in matters of Faith, so also in
their Civil affairs, avoiding contention and strife. The virtue then which is
here exhorted unto, See 1 Cor. 1. ^0
is Unanimity, a joining together in one mind, and one heart, in one
judgment, and one affection.

For Unity in Religion, There must be between Christians unity in Religion.
though Errors be many, yet there is but one Truth, which every one must know,
believe, and walk in to Salvation: Other foundation besides Christ there is
none; all that believe in him shall be saved, 1 Cor. 3. 11.
as they that miss of him, building beside the foundation, fall to the ground,
shall be ashamed and confounded: We were all created in the Truth, John 14. 6.
but since the fall become prone to error; Prove. 23. 23.
Christ is the Truth, the Way and the Life, and this are we to buy; this is
contained in the Scriptures, for which we are to search: Some foolishly
imagine, that every one shall be saved by his own devotion, but its life
eternal to know God, John 17. 3.
and Christ Jesus whom he has sent.

To be thus in one judgment in Religion, Reasons.
is a great mean of peace, as the contrary a great cause of dissension; even
disagreement in small matters, makes alienations of affections, much more in
Religion. This Jeroboam knew well, 1 King. 12. 27.
he would not suffer the ten Tribes to come up to Jerusalem to worship, as God
commanded, lest agreeing together, they should fall from him, but chose to set
up a new kind of worship at Dan and Bethel, thereby to set them at odds.

Its lamentable that so many are distracted into diverse and innumeral Heresies,
Who disagree from the truth in the foundation.
and but a very handful have the Truth, and be of one mind: Some disagree from
the Truth in the very foundation, as, 1 John 2. 23.
acknowledging the Father but not the Son; but he has

Some, Who holding the foundation, do yet err from the truth.
though they differ not in foundation, yet err from the truth; Such were the
Donatists, Novatians, and such like of old, as in our times, the Lutherans
beyond the Seas, and amongst our selves, the Separatists; Those are led with a
Spirit of pride and preposterous Zeal; They were bred up in the Church, and as
soon as they were able to shift for themselves, they spit in their Mothers
face, and call her Strumpet; These be ungracious children, they were never thus
taught of Christ or his Apostles: As we are to pity and pray for the former,
and that the Lord would deliver his poor people from the tyranny of the Turk
and Antichrist, giving the Gospel a free passage among them, that with one
mind and mouth they may glorify God in Christ Jesus; so for these: Seeing
there is little to prevail with them, as having a proud conceit of themselves
and their opinions, lets take heed we be not led away with them; for herein
they hazard their souls greatly, that they forsake the means, the Ministry of
the Word, and so may revolt, or at least stand at a stay: Whiles they be so
quarrelling about matters of Controversy, they neglect matters of
Sanctification and Government of their lives.

Besides, even among our selves that tarry in the Church, there is odds and
difference, and thereby carnal worldlings and profane persons excuse
themselves from embracing Religion, but this shall not serve their turn: 1 Cor.
13. 9.
There is odds indeed, and no marvel, For we know in part, and believe in part.

But wherein is the difference, not in the grounds of our Religion, but in
matters of Ceremony and Circumstance: Difference amongst our selves for matter
of Ceremony.
So far as the Ministers of the Church of England agree, let them embrace,
believe and obey, and it shall be sufficient to bring them to Heaven; as for
the things about which they differ, they little concern them: we are to desire
God that these controversies were at an end, and that we may be all of one
mind about these things; till which time we are to desire, that there might
not be such Separation of affections for these things, Note.
but as both may be saved and be good Christians that be of either of both
minds, so there might be a consent and agreement, and not one rent asunder in
affection from another; for as it were extreme uncharitableness for any to
judge any for these things, whom they see to live godly, and Preach diligently,
so to censure those over sharply that are not altogether of the same judgment.
The evils which ensue hereupon.
This does much hurt, for as it was said, The war of Heretics, is the peace of
the Church; so it is now too true, That the contention of the Church, is the
peace and increase of Papists among us: Hereby also many fall to Brownism, and
sundry no doubt hereupon shake off all care of Religion, and are little better
then Atheists.

Some there are even also amongst private Christians, Differences amongst
Christians about private opinions.
that having somewhat better gifts of wit and memory, and some more knowledge
then others, fall to curious questions, and maintain strange and singular
opinions, as, That they can discern Spirits, and in an hours talk with a man,
know certainly whether he be a child of God or not, etc. whereby they draw
parties to themselves, fall into wrangling and strife with such as oppose their
fancies, becomes strange unto them, discharge them behind their backs; whence
the godly are grieved, and profane ones take occasion to exclaim against the
profession of Religion, yea, their Ministers become ill thought of as teachers
of such Novelties: Such are of a proud Spirit, as who take up Opinions not
grounded in the Word, and maintain them also to the breach of unity and love:
If any scruple arise in our minds, we are in humility to resort to those, Mal.
2. 7.
whose lips are appointed to preserve knowledge.

For unity in civil affairs, There must be also unity between us in our
conversation.
or outward conversation: We ought to be of one mind in every good thing in
our families, and places where we live, husbands and wives, neighbors with
neighbors, must be like-minded one toward another, Ephesians. 4. 2.
according to Christ Jesus; any other is a conspiracy, Romans 15. 5.
no true agreement. In Towns men ought to join together to suppress evil
persons and places, and set up goodness so much as in them lies; where two or
three thus consent, there is God in the midst of them: But in most places, men
set themselves to cross one another, and Baal has them which plead for him,
and against God and goodness; Simil.
as if one Horse were set at the one end of the Cart, and another at the other
end, and each put to draw, they would trample the ground, tire themselves, and
do no good to the owner: so is it in many Towns, where dissension bears sway,
nothing is done to the glory of God or good thereof. Acts 4. 32.
And for particular persons and neighbors, they must be of one heart, and live
lovingly together, not offering occasion of offense, nor readily embracing any,
but forgetting, Ephesians. 4. 26.
forgiving, and passing by injuries, not giving place unto wrath, nor suffering
the Sun to go down thereon. We are brethren, members also of one body, Isa. 11.
6.
we must live like Lambs one with another: O how good and comely a thing is it
thus to live! Psalm. 133. 1.
but alas, how do men wrangle and contend for every trifle: Genesis 13. 8.
Welfare Abraham, he would rather yield to Lot then contend, we are his
children if we follow his steps; What a shame is it, that they which are
baptized with the same Baptism, profess the same Faith, and say that they are
guided by the same Spirit, should yet be at strife and variance? O fie upon it,
How do these stain their Prayers, hinder themselves from the Sacrament? How
can thou look God in the face, who thus break his Commandments? Hereof pride
and covetousness are the main causes: Take we heed to these duties, 2 Cor. 13.
11.
that living in peace, the God of love and peace may be with us.

Having compassion one of another,] Christians must be of like affection each
to other.
Another virtue required, is to be of like affection each to other, in their
prosperity rejoicing with them, and desiring the continuance thereof, as in
their heaviness to be grieved; Romans 12. 15.
yea, we are to rejoice in their prosperity, though we our selves were in
affliction, Psalm. 122. 6.
to rejoice, I say whether in respect of the Church in general, or of the
particular Members thereof: Such shall not prosper that have ill will to Sion,
that envy the prosperity of the Church, nor such as are envious at the good
estate of particular Christians, or Ministers, their welfare, credit, peace,
liberty; nor such as have an ill eye at their Neighbors thriving in wealth,
credit, gifts, or any other blessing: Through the Devil (justly styled the
envious man, as being the author of envy, they become thus envious: What, shall
we have an ill eye, because God is good? what is this but to find fault with
God? Gal. 5. 21.
How was envy punished in Cain, Psalm. 37. 1.
in Esau, in the Edomites, etc. Its a work of the flesh, which God cannot away
withal; nay, we are not to envy at the prosperity of the wicked, for they shall
pay full dearly for it: Naturally we are addicted hereunto, but we ought to
hate it, and strive against it: And for them whom God blesses above others,
they must walk very warily in all humbleness and care to do good, and kindly
use their Inferiors, else they put them upon a temptation of envy, whereas on
the other part people will say, His wealth and place is well bestowed on him,
he is loving, affable, does good, etc.

And as we are to rejoice with them that do rejoice, Gal. 6. 2.
so must we mourn with them that mourn, we must help to bear their burden; we
must pity them in our hearts, pray for them, visit them, and otherwise relieve
them if need be; we must not be altogether for our selves, as those who were
not born for our selves alone. Heb. 13. 3.
In the natural body, 1 Cor. 12. 26.
if one member suffer, the rest suffer with it, much more should it be so in
the spiritual: If the foot get a thorn in it, the back bows down to it, the eye
looks upon it, the hand searches it, the heart grieveth, the tongue
complains; should not we be thus affected at the hurt of our fellow members?
See Acts 9. 4.
Our head is a living feeling head, and accordingly we should be feeling
members: If we shall do thus for others, shall not they do the like for us?
Herein Nehemiah may be our pattern, though he were in great prosperity, Neh. 1.
4. and 2. 1, 2, 3, etc.
yet hearing of the miseries of Gods people, he so mourned, that it was seen in
his face; he used his best credit with the King, and by his permission
undertook a painful journey with much hazard to remedy the same.

1. This rebukes those which rejoice at the destruction of the Church and
members thereof, Use 1.
as the Papists would have done had their Powder Treason been effected, and as
carnal people do when the godly fall either into any trouble or sin: Psalm. 137.
7.
Thus did the Edomites in the day of Jerusalem, Prove. 17. 5.
but he that is glad at calamities, Job 31. 29.
shall not be unpunished: Job rejoiced not at the destruction even of him that
hated him; Pro. 24. 17, 18.
who so thus does, the Lord will not turn away his wrath from him.

2. It condemns those which instead of grieving at the afflictions of their
Brethren, Use 2.
are the only authors thereof, by Oppression, Bribery, Extortion, and such
cruel dealing; so was Pharaoh unto the Israelites, as Paul a cruel persecuter
till he was converted: Now if they that grieve not with them, and help them not
in their miseries will be found guilty, and condemned at the last day, what
shall become of those men of blood that have been the cause of their overthrow?
The cries of Gods poor servants ascend against them, and will bring destruction
upon them, as the Israelites upon Pharaoh.

3. It condemns those that whatsoever be the case of the Church, Use 3.
or Christians, or Neighbors, have no regard thereof, but give themselves over
to Ease, Pleasure, Belly cheer: Thus did Ahasuerus and Haman, Amos 6. 4.
thus the rich Glutton in the Gospel, but there is a curse prepared for such;
others are like stocks and stones, neither grieve in heart, pity in tongue, nor
afford any comfort to those that are in distress, they may sink or swine for
all them: They think it well if they hurt no man, but this will not serve their
turn, O what comfort can such look for either from God or men in their
extremity! yea, its also a great fault amongst Christians, that they mind so
much their own matters, that they are little affected this way, seldom pray for
such as are in distress, slowly visit them, and slenderly relieve them: Who
knows what temptations they may meet with? Its no easy thing to go alone
through trouble without help; its an Argument such have shrewd obstruction by
Self-love and Covetousness, wherewith they are much benumbed, half dead through
want of Spiritual moisture: We must labor to put away those, to be purged and
rid of them, and labor to find our souls to be in a good state and plight, by
our sensisible sympathizing at our brothers miseries: Are we guilty herein? It
concerns us to be much humbled for the same, and to labor for Reformation; then
shall we with comfort look up to God in our afflictions, and may be assured,
that if God shall lay his hand upon us, not a few will help shore us up, and
that's no small comfort in affliction.

Love as brethren,] Love as children of the same Father, love each other as it
becomes Christians, love one another with a brotherly love. Hereof I have
spoken on Chap. 1. ver. 22. That Christians may love one another.
Here only consider, wha^ Christians are to do, and what to avoid, that they
may love one another.

1. We are 1. What they are to do.
To provoke one another unto the duties of love. 2. In all we do to or for the
Saints, 2 Cor. 16. 14.
we must strive to do the same in a loving manner. 3. We must hide our brothers
infirmities, not blazing them abroad to their disgrace, not estranging our
selves from them for wrongs they do us, but gently rebuking them for the same.
4. If our brother trespass against us, we must show our selves easy to be
entreated upon his acknowledgement thereof.

2. We must avoid, What they must avoid.
1. Familiar society with the wicked of the world. 2. Take heed of such as sow
discord. 3. Not desire worldly greatness, whether in Church or Commonwealth. 4.
Not be wise in our own conceits, but esteem of others judgment as well as our
own. 5. Not be altogether addicted to our own worldy affairs, thereupon
affecting retiredness from the society of others.

1. This reproves those that love, Use 1.
like, and use all alike; the loose and profane, give them as good content, as
the good and virtuous.

2. It reproves them, Use 2.
that like the godly worst, or could like them well, were they not so precise.

3. It reproves the contentions between Christians; Use 3.
we should love one another with brotherly affection, and show the same by
brotherly actions, but how do many fall out for trifles? What a fearful thing
is this? How monstrous and prodigious for one member to offer violence unto
another? To see brethren contend before God their Father, in the face of the
Church their Mother, and before their fellow-brothers and Christians in Christ
that grieve at it, yea, before the wretches of the world that laugh at it, how
strange is it? When two Christians fall out and be at variance, do they not
unchristian and unbrother each other? O the strength and violence of our
corruption breaking asunder this band! What shall tie men together, if the
Spirit of Love be not strong enough? Genesis 13. 7.
O that we could remember with Abraham, that there are Canaanites and
Perizzites in the land! O that the unregenerate would labor for Sanctification,
whereby they may begin to love God and their brethren, and the regenerate labor
to pull out all these weeds of Pride, Covetousness, Envy, Frowardness, etc.
that this tender plant of Love taking root in their hearts, may so thrive, See
2 Thessalonians. 1 2.
that it may fructify in their lives and conversation, and they may abound
more and more therein.

Be pitiful,] What pity is.
Pity is an holy compassion of the heart, whereby we are ready to relieve them
that are in misery, whether our selves or others.

Herein there must be both the affection of the heart, and help of the hand.

For our selves, We must pity our selves.
we are by nature in a most woeful and fearful condition, we are sinners, and so
under the curse of God, and subject to eternal condemnation hereafter, and
therewithal the vassals and slaves of Sin and the Devil. Now we are bound to
love our selves first, therefore to pity our selves in any misery: If we be in
any bodily misery, as pains, poverty, or the like, we moan our selves,
complain, and grieving, seek to relieve our selves, so ought we to take
knowledge of the miseries of our souls, and labor to get our selves out of the
same: We must not be quiet till we have got the assurance of the pardon of our
sins, and that there is no condemnation unto us; we must give no sleep to our
eyes, nor slumber to our eyelids, till we find our selves thus delivered: And
considering that of our selves we have no strength to any thing that is good,
we must endeavor to live under the Ministry of the Word, where we may know the
will of God, and be thereby directed unto Salvation.

This condemns the most unmerciful hard-heartedness of the world, Use.
that have no pity on themselves for their Spiritual miseries, nay will not
take knowledge of them, but hate those that would help them out of them, or
knowing them, yet are content either to abide in the same without any regard,
or bless themselves in their condition, as if either it were not so bad as it
is, or they might come out of it when they would: Would we not pity our selves
if we were blind, lame, naked, diseased in our bodies? Such are we in soul,
but where is our pity? Who would live in a place where there were no bread? or
in a Town besieged by Enemies, wherein there were no Watchmen to give warning?
Simile.
but not a few live where there are neither Preaching nor Preachers. As Peter
bade Christ favor himself, so may we bid these pity themselves. O consider of
the worth of your souls, and of the misery wherein they now are, and (if not
now prevented) hereafter shall be: How do we take on if our finger be but a
little burnt with a Candle? Should we not therefore stand in fear of the
everlasting burning in Hell? Who will pity you, if you pity not your own souls?
or who will commit unto you their souls to be cared for, that have no pity of
your own? If God cast you into eternal torments without pity, yet you must
needs blame your selves, as those who had no pity of your selves: O pity your
selves, though it be with some pains to your bodies: If your bodies do your
souls a good turn, as by bringing them to the Word, being profited thereby,
they will requite them a thousand fold.

Pity toward others, We must pity the souls of others.
is either in respect of their souls or their bodies.

In respect of their souls, It must be our care and labor to help them out of
such miseries and bondage as they lie under: Isa. 49. 23.
Thus must Princes be careful of their subjects souls, Psalm 78. 72.
be unto them as nursing fathers and nursing mothers, feed them, guide them,
and with Asa, Hezekiah, Josiah, Jehoshaphat, etc. provide that they may be
instructed in their duties: Romans 13. 3, 4.
Thus must Magistrates of the people among whom they live, encouraging the
good, and punishing the bad: Thus Ministers, as Watchmen, tell people of any
danger; as Shepherds, feed them; See Eze. 34. 4.
and as guides, lead them: They must preach to the capacity of the meanest, 2 Timothy 2. 15. and 4. 2.
going in and out before them by an holy example: Thus Patrons must have a care
in bestowing their livings in pity of the peoples souls; 1 Pet. 5. 2.
Thus Parents of their Children, bringing them up in the narture and fear of
the Lord; Thus Husbands of their wives souls, Ephesians. 6. 4.
Masters of their Servants, all of us each of others: Help them that live in
ignorance out of it in what you can, bring home the impenitent, comfort them
that are afflicted; yea, we are even to pity those that are further off, or
dwell in other Countries, who are yet without the knowledge of God and Christ,
as also to pity their souls, who do not yet pity themselves. Reasons.
What may not enduce us hereunto? God is full of compassion and mercy: Psalm.
103. 13.
Such an account made he of our souls, John 3. 16.
as to save them, he gave the blood of his own Son: Christ Jesus so pitied us,
as he was content to abase himself to the state of man, Phil. 2. 8.
taking upon him the form of a Servant, yea, to undergo the ignominous death of
the Cross: O how he wept over Jerusalem! How moved he was with pity, Luke 19.
41.
when he saw the people scattered as Sheep wanting a shepherd? Mat. 9. 36.
and as he himself Preached most diligently, so as the Doctor and Prophet of
his Church, he furnished the same with able men, as the twelve Apostles, and
seventy Disciples. Add hereunto, See Mat. 16. 26.
that the soul is of more worth then the whole world, and that if the soul be
lost, it must lie in unspeakable and endless torments, and thither also will it
draw the body.

This condemns the unmercifulness of the world toward souls, Use.
as of those which establish false Religion, and bind their people thereto, 1
King. 16. 26.
as Jeroboam, who made the people sin; such poison and murder the soul: So of
ungodly Magistrates, who hinder the preaching of the Word in what they can; So
of ignorant, Heretical, corrupt Teachers, ravening Wolves, such starve or
poison souls, They cloth themselves with the fleece, but care not for the
flock; So of wicked and unconscionable Patrons, that for kindred, favor, or
money, put in such as God never called, being no way fit for that weighty
calling, utterly unapt to teach, having neither ability nor willingness
thereto, being such as seek their ease and pleasures; So of wicked Fathers,
that buy livings for their Sons, though never so unsufficient; So of careless
and ungodly Parents, that have no care of the education of their Children,
providing for them food, gay clothes, and great Portions, but no good
instruction. Simile.
If they were taken Captives of the Turk, they will mourn, but are no whit
moved with pity, though they be indeed Slaves unto Satan; If but their finger
ache, they are grieved, what should they then be, seeing so many ugly sores of
deadly sins running upon them? So of Neighbors that little regard those they
live by, though ignorant, impenitent, etc. they are not troubled at it, show
little mercy this way; So if any be afflicted in conscience, few take the same
to heart, few do either regard or pity them. Assuredly such as show no mercy to
the souls of others, especially them that be under their charge, shall have of
God no mercy showed on their souls, but as it was said, Exodus 21. 24.
Eye for eye, tooth for tooth; so will he make them pay soul for soul; their
blood shall be required of them: There shall be judgment without mercy, James
2. 13.
to them that show no mercy, yea, God will especially unconscionable and
unmerciful Ministers, See Ier. 20. 6.
not only in themselves and their goods so gotten, Hos. 4. 6.
but also in their children. Contrarily to those that have pitied souls, Matthew.
5. 7.
God will show mercy: Godly Kings and Magistrates, 1 Timothy 4. 16.
with Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, and Nehemiah, God will bless and remember them in
goodness: Dan. 12. 8.
Also godly, painful and merciful Ministers, shall both save themselves, and
them that hear them; They shall shine as the Stars, and receive an
incorruptible Crown of glory: 2 Timothy 4. 8.
Being careful in their places, they are (what effect soever their labors have)
a sweet savor to God. 2 Cor. 2. 15.
The like may be said of Parents, who are careful in their childrens education,
and of godly Neighbors, which seek the good of their souls with whom they live,
God will requite it into their bosoms, as having done a great work: O let us be
provoked to have more regard and pity of the miseries of souls then ever! If we
be careful of our own, we will also be careful of the souls of others; when we
have once felt the misery of our own souls, and found mercy of God to be
delivered therefrom, then will we know the worth of souls, and be pitiful over
others. No marvel though so few be careful of the souls of others, being there
are so few careful of their own; whenever you see any negligent in their
places, its because the work of grace has not been as yet wrought on their
souls.

In respect of their Bodies; We must pity the bodies of others.
To those that be sick, in pain, poverty, debt, prison, or any outward
distress, we ought to be inwardly compassionate, See Isa. 58. 6.
and outwardly relieve them as we may; we must have bowels of mercy, Luke 14.
13.
right bowels toward them; we must have such tenderness of affection, Romans 12.
15.
as if we were in the same case; Heb. 13. 3.
we are not born only for our selves, we are but Stewards: God sends poverty
on them, as for the trial of their faith and patience, so of our love; we have
cause to thank God, who has thus honored us to be givers, what have we
deserved more then others? Simil.
God as a mighty Prince and Housekeeper, has called us all to his Table,
setting some at the upper end, others at the middle, as others at the lower end
thereof; It were no manners in them that sit above, to keep all for themselves,
they must distribute to them that sit lowest of that that is set before them:
Reasons.
God is merciful, and so should we be, yea, this is the note of a good man,
Psalm. 112. 9.
and such were Job and Cornelius, such Dorcas; yea, how pitiful was our Savior
this way, when he fed the hungry, gave sight to the blind, healed the lame,
etc. God has also made gracious promises hereunto, all which may induce us to
the performance hereof. Signs.
And thus are we affected indeed, when we are ready to hear the cries of the
poor, and to relieve them cheerfully; wherein notwithstanding we must not look
for too much beholdingness, we must show mercy to those that have most need,
and of those to the household of Faith; we must give out of goods well gotten,
laying aside somewhat thereof for such uses; we must abound more and more,
being full of mercy, and not weary of well doing: So when we lend freely, not
looking so much to save our selves, as to pleasure them to whom we lend, and in
buying and selling, do unto others as we would be dealt withal: Whereunto may
be added, our dealing mercifully with those which fall into our danger, by
forfeiting their Bond, not fulfilling their Covenants, and the like.

1. This condemns all unmerciful men, Use 1.
whether such as will part from nothing but even by constraint, hard-hearted,
having no bowels, giving no more then needs must, not lending at all, or for
their own advantage to the undoing of the borrowers; or such as do hurt,
oppress, gripe by Usury, by cruel letting of Leases, selling after unreasonable
Rate to the poor, buying of them half for naught, grinding their faces, and
flaying their skins by Forfeitures, etc. so feeding themselves on them, and
working on their necessities; Let all such know, That they have no grace in
them at all, 1 John 3. 17. and 4. 20.
no soundness in Religion, no true love of God, James 1. 27.
God also will shut up his mercy from these, neither shall they partake of
blessedness; Prove. 21. 13.
Though they cry unto him, he will not hear them, Matthew 5. 7.
he will be revenged on them in their goods, names, children, souls, here and
hereafter: See Job 20. 10, 15. Prove. 22. 22, 23. Jer. 17. Mat. 25.

2. This may be a comfort to all merciful minded, Use 2.
and liberal handed men: They are herein like to God, who is merciful, and
requires of us so to be, Luke 6. 36.
because he is so; as good and faithful Stewards, they shall be made Rulers
over much: They shall be blessed every way, for they cause many thanks to be
given to God, Pro. 11. 24, 25.
and they have also many Prayers; Eccles. 11. 1.
they are blessed in their goods, as which not only increase more and more,
but descend from them to their posterity; they are blessed in their names, they
live in credit and reputation, and being dead, Acts 8. 2.
they are much lamented for; they are blessed in their children, they are
blessed every way, outwardly, inwardly, in body, in soul, Psalm. 37. 26.
here and hereafter: Matthew. 5. 7. and 25. 21.
The merciful shall obtain mercy, The good and faithful servant shall enter his
Masters joy.

3. For those that be not cruel, Use 3.
yet withal not so merciful as they should be, let them labor for this grace of
pity; and to this end both remove the lets and impediments thereof, namely,
Prodigality (whereby they waste all, become unthrifts, unfit at all to do any
good) and Covetousness (whereby they think all lost that goes besides
themselves, which is indeed the cutthroat of pity) and use the means conducing
hereunto, Means conducing hereunto.
namely, 1. Labor for a feeling of Gods mercy to themselves. 2. Visit the poors
houses, look into their Cup boards, observe their cold fare, their thin and
hard lodging (this cannot but affect them, as the Samaritan upon his view of
the man fallen among Thieves, Luke 10. 33.
had compassion on him.) 3. If they themselves cannot see them, let them take
informations thereof from others. 4. When they are in any affliction, as in
pains, or sick, let them consider the means they have for their recovery, as a
warm house, a good bed, wholesome Diet, the Physicians advice and direction,
etc. all which the poor want: Whosoever does thankfully acknowledge those, cannot
but be pitiful. We must be pitiful to our beasts.


There Is yet one further branch of pity; We must be pitiful to our Beasts,
Prove. 12. 10.
we must use them mercifully, and keep them sufficiently, yea be pitiful not
only of our own, Exodus 23. 4.
but our Neighbors, nay our Enemies. God is pitiful this way, Psalm. 104. 21.
and 147. 9.
He feeds the young Ravens that cry unto him; and, The Lions seek their meat
from him: Deuteronomy. 25. 4.
He opens his hand, and fills all things living with plenteousness: He will
not have the mouth of the Ox to be musled; Exodus 20. 10.
and will have the beasts also rest on the Sabbath day.

This rebukes those which (though they pamper them not as some do their Hounds,
Use.
giving them that which many of the poor want, and others their Horses) are
cruel persons to their Beasts, as rank Riders, which are all on the spur (yet
in Princes Affairs, or cases of necessity men may take liberty this way)
covetous Misers, that keep their Cattle bare and poor, Servants that deal
unconscionably, through their idleness and laziness suffering poor dumb
creatures to perish; all which hurry up and down by unnecessary journeys, or by
their journeys on the Lords day, whether for profit or pleasure.

Be courteous,] What courtesy is, and that Christians are to be courteous
Courtesy is an affable, mild, and lowly carriage of our selves toward our
equals and inferiors (for its reverence and duty we owe and do perform to our
superiors and betters) this is in countenance, How it shows it self.
gesture, words and deeds; our countenance must be amiable, not too cloudy and
austere; we must kindly and lovingly greet one another ( Greet one another
(says the Apostle) with an holy kiss; Romans 16. 16.
and in another place, 1 Pet. 5. 14.
with the kiss of charity, Psalm. 129. 8.
both speeches be to very good purpose:) This has been of ancient standing,
even to greet one another at meeting or passing by, Romans 12. 10.
and hereof we have examples in the holy Scriptures: Luke 14. 8.
We must also give the upper hand, and highest seat in our Meetings, which also
our Savior does require: We must also be affable in our speeches, whilst we be
in company, not too strange or dark, but free and cheerful; this is required in
Scripture under the name of Meekness (even the smallest duties that we owe one
to another are here set down) and for this is Moses commended; Ephesians. 4. 2.
so our Savior Christ, Col. 3. 12.
he was so affable, Number. 12. 3.
as poor ones, yea poor women durst speak to him; his disciples also asked him
questions from time to time, which he refused not to answer; yea, even unto him
that smote him he spoke courteously, John 18. 23.
If I have evil spoken, bear witness of the evil.

This tends greatly to peace, and to procure love: What force was in Absoloms
courteous speeches, 2 Samuel 15. 6.
to steal away the hearts of the people? The contrary breeds heart-burnings,
evil surmisings, contentions, what not? Our Nature can abide nothing worse,
then to see our selves contemned or neglected by others; what can we do less,
then greet and use them kindly? If they be our equals, is it not reason we
should use them as courteously as we would be used of them? If our inferiors,
its noble for us to use them kindly, as its a point of a base mind to insult
over, or trample them under. Thus would they murmr against God, and envy us,
whereas our courteous behavior would be a means to make them contented with
their place; yea, though we are not to be familiar with the wicked, or open our
hearts to such, or join our selves in near communion with them, or bear with
them in their evil courses, but speak earnestly against the same; yet are we to
carry our selves courteously toward them, that thereby we may win them the
more.

This rebukes those that fail in either extreme. Use 1.


On the one part, there are some 1. Which are proud, scornful, and disdainful
in their looks and carriage toward others, passing by them without saluting
them, or once speaking to them; such have base minds: And what can be more
strange, then that any mortal man which is but a Worm, should thus deal with
one that is his own flesh, the image of God, yea happily one better then himself?
2. Which strive and justle for the highest rooms, wall, or seats in the Church,
and elsewhere, which strive for the way upon the Road, etc. Hereby they display
their pride, and in stead of honor, bring disgrace upon themselves. 3. Use
cursed and cruel speaking, like Nabal, who was so wicked, that none could speak
to him, or carry themselves so high, as their inferior cannot speak to them:
Hence is the common Proverb, They had rather speak to the greatest Gentleman or
Nobleman in a Country, then to such a mean man, and have a better answer;
Naaman and Job would hear their Servants speak. 4. Such as for frowardness and
heart-burning cannot speak when they meet, nor salute each other, but pass by
each other, as if they were dumb and tonguetyed; a goodly matter, if they could
wound and kill one another as good cheap, would they not do it? and is not this
sin before God? does not God behold the same?

On the other, there is 1. Counterfeit courtesy, in low crouchings and
greetings, etc. wherein (being void of love and kindeness) men do altogether
seek themselves, 2 Samuel 15. 6.
as Absalom did. 2. Treacherous courtesy, when men salute kindly, but intend
devilishly, under a fair vizard bearing mischief in their hearts; Thus Joab in
killing Abner and Amasa, and Judas in betraying Christ; thus many will speak
very friendly to them against whom behind their backs they will by and by
rail, and plot mischief. 3. Excessive courtesy, when men be too full of it: If
some in humility and true simplicity, show a great deal more courtesy toward
their Superiors then they would have, its not much amiss; but when men exceed
in it toward their equals, it does often carry much falsehood with it,
according to the old Proverb, Much courtesy, much craft; its also seen often,
that there are none more hollow, then they that seem most courteous; God for
the present sees their hypocrisy, and man in time will, and loath both it and
them: Its a fault among Christians, that at their meetings they stand striving
who should take the place, or sit down first, etc. to the great disturbance of
the whole company; modestly to refuse the place at the first is commendable, as
its also in them that offer it, but for either to stand long complementing
about it, ridiculous.

Not rendering evil for evil, Christians must not revenge themselves on their
enemies.
or railing for railing,] Now of our carriage toward wicked and injurious men:
They are naturally bent to speak evil of us, especially being the servants of
God, but we must not requite them with the like, we must not revenge our selves
on them: They that make a trade hereof, are but carnal, and have naughty
hearts: Its also a vile thing, fittter for Turks and Heathens, then such as
know God; as we would be forgiven of God, we must for give one another. But of
this already on Verse. 23. of the foregoing Chapter.

There Is lawful revenge on our selves, Lawful revenge on our selves.
as in Zacheus the Publican, Mary Magdalene, the Apostle Paul, the Incestuous
person, etc. Thus we are to revenge our covetousness by more large giving; our
riot, by more sparing from the body; our earnestness and pains in evil, by the
like or greater in hearing the Word and holy Exercises. There Is also an holy
revenge upon others, On others.
which is rather upon sin then their persons, being zealous against the same in
whomsoever we find it, whether our children, servants, or others, accordingly
avenging the glory of God, by bringing those to punishment that hinder or hurt
the same.

But contrariwise blessing,] Gods children in respect of their outward
conversation, must differ and be contrary to the wicked.
The lives and language of Gods children should not only be differing from the
world, but in many things they must be quite contrary, for they are led by
contrary principles, the one by the flesh, the other by the spirit; the one
minds only earthly things, the other heavenly: This is a step higher, an
harder lesson then the former, to requite evil with good: The wicked render
evil for evil, so must not we, as light and darkness, Christ and Belial, we
must be herein contrary to them: Some weak Christians there are that come too
nigh the fashions, behavior and speech of the wicked; many too much set upon
the world as the wicked are; fie upon it: To be easily provoked, and hardly
entreated to be reconciled, is the fashion of the world, but such must not ours
be.

By blessing in this place we are to understand praying for our enemies, We
must requite evil with good.
speaking kindly to them, giving them kind answers, and doing them all the
good we can.

Observe. Its not only our duty to be free from revenge of evil, See John 31.
16, 17, 18.
but we must requite evil with good: Romans 12. 20, 2
If our enemies speak ill of us, or to us, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 1^.
we must speak well of and to them; if they do ill to us, we must do well to
them.

Obj. But did not David and Jeremiah pray against their enemies, and Elisha
cursed the children that m^ckt him?

Ans. Enemies be either private to us, Mat. 5. 44.
or public to God and his Church, An Objection answered.
and these either curable or incurable: For public incurable enemies, if we
knew them, we might hate their sins directly, and their persons indirectly, as
the Devil, which these holy men of God did know by an extraordinary measure of
the Spirit wherewith they were led, and not otherwise, and so they were rather
prophesies of the destruction of bad men delivered in the form of Prayer: But
we have no such warrant, therefore may not we do so; but for private enemies,
or for public that be curable (as who are not for ought we know?) we must love
their persons, and wish well to them, and do them good, though we hate their
sins.

Obj. God commanded to kill the Amalekites and Canaanites, and how stands that
with this Precept of loving our Enemies, and doing them good?

Ans. We must love our enemies in God, and for God, and not against God;
Another Objection answered.
therefore he having commanded to kill them, they were bound so to do, who yet
in the mean time might wish well to their souls: Exodus 17. 14.
Thus if we war against Gods enemies, and be enforced to kill them, we must yet
pitying their souls, do the same with a kind of pity, hating the bad cause
they maintain, and wishing there were no such occasion against them; we must
must, I say, in an holy revenge, as of Gods enemies, and set on work by the
Magistrate, oppose our selves against them.

Quest. Reasons why we are to requite evil with good.
Why are we to requite evil with good?

Answ. 1. God requires it, Christ also who has done so much for us, does
enjoin it, But I say (says he) love your enemies, etc. 2. We Mat. 5. 45.
his Sun shines as well on the unjust as the just. 3. This is to do some thing
worthy of a Christian, even the Heathens and Publicans can love those which
love them. Mat. 5. 46.
4. We must Adam, he found a way to save us. 6. This Prove 15. 1.
and to melt the heart of our adversary, 1 Samuel 24. and 17.
if he belong to God, or leave him without excuse; yea, cause them to speak
well of us, as Saul did of David. 7. This is a good 2 Samuel 1. 24.
8. We have for this the examples of Joseph toward his brethren, See Psalm. 35.
13, 14.
Moses and Aaron praying for the people, David mourning for Saul, Acts 7. 60.
and provoking others so to do, so of Steven, but above all of our Savior
himself, Luke 23. 34.
who even on the cross prayed for his enemies.

1. This may humble us in respect of the vile corruption of our hearts, Use 1.
that count this an hard saying, and have in our practice been so far from it:
Most are scarce free from revenge, much less can be brought to requite good
good evil; Oh, its an hard thing! but does it not become Christians of such
standing as we are to do hard things? and have we not been told, that the way
to Heaven is straight? O but he has deserved nothing of me but all ill, will
some say: but so have we of God, who yet does not thus requite us; and though
he have deserved nothing, yet God has deserved all love of us, for his
infinite love to us; Well then, he sets us to pay over some of that love we owe
to him, to our enemies, and is it not reason that we should pay the same? He
may assign over his debt or part of it to whom he will; If our Creditor bid us
pay some part of that we owe him to another, will we refuse, and say, He is a
stranger to me, I owe him nothing, I Will pay him nothing, etc. much less should
we herein; yea, when we are bid to do good to our enemies, its but as we make
our children do, even to kiss the rod, and this is but to pull down our
stomachs, and we have more blows sometimes with the rod then we need, would we
yield sooner, and kiss the rod: This to a natural man is impossible, but to him
that is truly assured of Gods love, and sees his daily goodness, contrary to
his ill deserts, and is endued with some measure of Faith, its easy: And if we
are to requite good for evil, how much more ought we to render good to them
that do us good? 2 Samuel 9. 7. and 19. 38.
David was notable in this kind, he required Jonathans kindeness and
Barzillai's on their sons, Genesis 40. 23.
for the contrary, Pharaoh's Butler is branded for ever.

2. This condemns those that requite not good to them that have done them
good, Use 2.
as Children that relieve not their Parents in their age, much more those that
requite evil for good; Thus do many ungracious Children, Servants, and people,
to their Parents, Masters and Magistrates, as the Israelites to Moses and
Aaron, the People to Jeremiah, See John 7. 7. and 10. 32.
Ahab to Elijah and Micaiah, Joaesh to Zechariah, Herod to John the Baptist:
Hereof also our Savior had experience. So in these days, even of those that
have some show of goodness in them, yet not a few being faithfully dealt withal
by their Ministers, and told of their faults, they think the worse of them, and
cannot well away with them.

Knowing that ye are there unto called,] Whosoever finds himself effectually
called, what will he not be willing to do for God?
Here is a reason to enforce the forementioned duty; Its one thing that God
requires of all his, when he takes them to his favor, even to take up his yoke,
whereof this is one part, then which nothing more yokes our flesh and corrupt
nature; He that will be Christ's Disciple must deny himself: Luke 9. 23.
If we perform this, we have hereby an argument of our effectual calling, and
who would not desire to know indeed that he is in the way to Heaven? An
unregenerate man cannot possibly do this, at least not aright, but he that has
tasted and felt abundantly of Gods love to him, he will so love God, that for
his sake he will do this, or any thing which he commands: God chooses whom he
pleases, and refuses others; He calls by the voice of Christ in the Gospel,
He calls from darkness, sin, this evil world, He calls to the state of
grace, and all the privileges thereof here, and to eternal glory in the world
to come, He calls especially the weak and despised ones, for the further
manifestation of his glory. The excella^^cy and worth of effectual calling.
This is an high and honorable calling, taking hold of election before the
world, and of glorification after: we are called to live holily as well as to
be saved, never happy hereafter, except we be holy here: This a Christian may
know, and is bound to labor to make it sure; Its our best riches, it gives us a
right unto all Gods promises, it furthers our Sanctification, it stays our
heart in the evil day, it enables us to suffer persecution, to set light by the
world, and cheerfully to do such duties as God requires of us; but this is no
idle thing, How to discern hereof.
it has hard work belonging thereto. He that is called, must requite good for
evil, being cursed of others, bless; He that does not thus is not called: Thou
art effectually called, if thou groanest under the burden of thy sin, and
desire more to be rid of it then of affliction; If thou receivest the Gospel
in the power of it, if thou art inwardly quickened in thy spiritual senses, if
thou forsakest the society of the wicked, if thou art renewed throughout thy
whole man, Why many Christians are often unsettled herein.
and become a new Creature. And though a Christian may be assured of his
calling, not a few notwithstanding are often unsettled; the grounds are, for
that either they are false Christians, or as yet but weak, or careless and
lazy, or for that they are doubtful and full of unbelief, or for that they be
too worldly, or for that they give way to some corruptions, or for that they
conceive afflictions befall not Gods people, and the like.

That ye should inherit a blessing.] Another Reason, Its for our profit, we
shall be so far from being losers hereby, as we shall be great gainers; If we
shall lay aside our own wills, and do good to our Neighbors according to Gods
will, we shall have Gods blessing both here and hereafter. The Word always
persuades us to our good.
The Word ever persuades to our benefit, and will be so found in the winding
up, howsoever, for the present we can hardly believe the same: O that we should
lose our part in Gods blessing, rather then yield up our will, and obey God! O
who would not hereby treasure up blessings to himself! Note further, That

Christians are a blessed people, Christians are a blessed people.
none like them; Therefore should Christians rebuke themselves when they be
discouraged, or think basely of themselves: The blind world judges Gods
Servants miserable because of trouble, but they are of all others blessed.
Hereunto they are called, being by nature children of wrath; neither shall any
partake of this blessedness, but they that are called, and such are heirs of
blessing: The godly bless them for their graces, pray for them, and praise
them; The loins of the poor bless them for their liberality: Their own
consciences also comfort them; They are also blessed of God, which may swallow
up all the crosses they meet with. This in a restrained sense may be his
comfortable speaking to them, Psalm. 85. 8.
He speaks unto his Servants peace; and as God speaks thus unto his, so should
Gods Ministers thus speak unto them; and as God speaks not only comfortably to
them, but well of them, so should we also. In an enlarged sense, They have Gods
blessings on themselves, on theirs, on all they take in hand; He blesses his
Ordinances for them, he blesses them with grace: Many a poor Christian carries
more Treasure in his heart, then all the great ones in the world have, being
without grace: The Church is glorious within, though black without by reason of
affliction; for his blessings in the life to come, who can express the same?

Would thou be blessed of God? Use.
attend on Gods house, let the rain of the Word soak into thine heart; Turn
from thy sins and evil ways, fear God truly: Art thou now blessed of him? walk
so as thou may enjoy it, make high account of it, endeavor that thy children
and servants may fear God, and so partake of it.

Verse 10. For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain his
tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile. Verse 11. Let him
eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace and ensue it.
ANother Reason in these and the following verse to persuade to patience and
requiting ill with good, Why we ought to be patient, and requite ill with good.
We shall procure to our selves a longer and a more comfortable life in this
world; besides, it will be the way to eternal life in the world to come. This
he proves by a testimony out of the Psalms, Psalm. 34. 12.
which is here by the holy Ghost very fitly applied to this special, which is
first affirmed, then proved; Affirmed. That if any man desire life, with
comfortable and peaceable days, he must refrain his tongue from evil, etc.
Proved, For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open
to etc. their prayers. So we have 1. A Proposition, The parts herein
considerable.
That the patient and loving man shall live and see good days: 2. The proof
thereof, from the care that God has of such: 3. The same illustrated from the
contrary disposition of God against the wicked. In the Proposition, we have the
blessings to be desired and obtained, Life and good days, with the means to
compass the same, A Christian and patient conversation, consisting partly in
the shunning of evil, and partly in the doing of good. In the Proof we have the
love and care of God toward such, set out by two actions of the Lord, His
looking to them, and hearing them; the contrary being affirmed of the ungodly.
We will speak first of those in general, then of the several branches thereof
in particular. In general, Note, that

A patient and peaceable man shall live the longer and the quieter; A patient
and peaceable man shall live the longer and the quieter.
See for the proof of this, Prove. 21. 21. Isa. 29. 19. Mat. 5. 5. Such take the
way to stint strife, and as wood being kept away, the fire goes out, so by
this means contention cease: Thus also are the parties vanquished who would
contend with us, therefore we see, that of all sorts of men, such have fewest
to trouble them. Besides, God takes the care of such, has an eye to them,
preserves them, notwithstanding all their enemies can do, as may be seen in
Jacob and David: On the contrary, such as are not thus, they do either shorten
their lives, or at least make them full of trouble; for thus they stir up
strife, and make more work for contention, and so shorten their days, as is
seen by quarrellers, and such as vex themselves by Law Suits, Evil hunts the
violent man, Psalm. 140. 11.
to overthrow him; Isa. 29. 20.
The terrible one is brought to naught, etc. Genesis 16. 12.
whosoever has his hand against every man, every man's hand shall be against him;
yea, if men would let such alone, God will not, he will set his face against
such quarrelsom and shameless persons, to destroy them.

1. This confutes the common Conceit of the world, Use 1.
which is, That thus to put up wrongs, were the way indeed still to have more
and more wrongs put upon us; as if they should precisely follow the Rule of the
Word in their dealings, poverty and beggary could not but quickly come upon
them, both which are and have been found contrary.

2. Whosoever desires to live, Use 2.
and that peaceably, let him take this course, hating and avoiding trouble and
vexation so much as in him lies: Let us learn to be wise, and thus provide for
a quiet life, that we may be the fitter to serve God, and do good to our selves
and others; if we do not believe and practice the same, we shall do him less
honor then we do a Physician, whose prescripts we use for procuring health, and
when trouble comes upon us, we may justly blame our selves for the same: O be
guided by the Word, how else shall you live a comfortable and quiet life? David
and Peter, who here urge the same, knew this by experience: What is herein
required of us, has been throughout all ages, long taught, though not much
learned. Thus in general.

For he that will love life,] Life and long life are blessings of God, and
which Gods children may desire.
Life and long life are blessings of God, to be desired and delighted in of
Gods children; See to this purpose Genesis 25. 8. Exodus 20. 12. Job 5. 26. 1 Chronicles. 29. 28. Psalm. 128. 6. Prove. 3. 16. yea, the Apostle counts it a mercy of
God that Epaphroditus was restored to health. Phil. 2. 27.
To be taken away untimely, is as an apple pulled from the Tree before it be
ripe; Reasons.
by living long, we shall get to our souls an assurance of Gods love, with more
and more evidences thereof, to the increase of our joys; hereby also we have
time and means to grow in grace and sanctification, and to have the image of
God restored in us more clearly and fully; hereby also we shall do God much
service in Church and Commonwealth, and that better at the last then at the
first, as being bettered through experience; and hence it is that Gods servants
have sometimes prayed against death, and desired still to live, as David and
Hezekiah.

Quest. How is this to be counted a blessing, seeing many of Gods dear servants
go without it, and are taken away betimes?

R. Its but a Temporal blessing, An objection answered.
and so Gods people may be debarred thereof, Why the godly are at sometimes
taken away by death.
as of health, wealth, and such like, and that sometimes for correction of sin
(howsoever God saves their souls) as on the Corinthians for their unworthy
receiving of the Sacrament; so good Josiah going to war without Gods command, 1
Cor. 11. 30.
was killed in the battle; so many a Minister is taken from his people, for
their making no better use of him, 2 King. 22. 19.
as many a husband from his wife, for not regarding him, Isa. 57. 1.
or trusting too much on him; the like might be instanced in other, sometimes
in mercy, that they may not see the evils to come, and thus also amends is made
them; they are paid weight in gold, for weight in silver; in stead of long life
in this world, they have longer time in Heaven.

Q. How is long life a blessing, Job 21. 7.
seeing even many of the wicked enjoy it?

R. Though it be in it self a blessing, as whereby they enjoy many good
comforts in this life, Long life unto the wicked might prove a blessing, but
does not.
and are not so soon in Hell as they deserve, and besides, have space and time
to repent, yet as they handle the matter, its no blessing, but contrarily
proves a means of the increase of their sin, and so of their condemnation.

Quest. How is life and the continuance thereof to be desired as a blessing,
Phil. 1. 23.
seeing it has been the desire of Gods people to be dissolved, and to be with
Christ?

R. We must not desire to live, In what respect it may be lawful to desire to
live.
because we would live, but because we would live to Gods glory, our own and
the good of others; neither must we desire to dye for it self, for that is
against nature, nor because of our crosses and troubles, but that we may cease
to sin, and be with God in his heavenly Kingdom, perfectly both holy and happy:
We must desire to be with God, but yet we must not be so importunate, as though
we would prevent the Lord, and make away our selves wittingly, or negligently
shorten our lives. Again, we must not so love our life, as that we should be
unwilling to yield it up if God will, or to redeem the continuance thereof with
an ill Conscience, and denying God, for he that so loves his life, shall lose
it, and his soul too: Both then may be desired, but because we know not what is
best, we must not be our own carvers, but commend our selves to God to be
disposed of: Its a base thing to desire life, to be great, enjoy pleasures, be
revenged of our enemies, and the like.

Q. Whence is it that most men are strongly carried after long life.

R. 1. Through the corruption of nature: Whence it is that most men are
desirous to live long.
To love life is natural, but to love it so exceedingly, is of corruption. 2.
Through ignorance and unbelief of the things of a better life. 3. Through the
love of worldly profits, 1 John 2. 15.
pleasures and prefermentss: That such fail herein, may thus appear we should
not love the world, nor the things thereof: Job 14. 5.
The whole world cannot satisfy the soul; our life is but a breath, a blast,
our days are determined, beyond which we cannot pass; we are here but strangers
and pilgrims: So long as we live we are liable as well to sin, as crosses by
reason thereof: Of the things here wherein we place happiness, what certainty
is there? friends may forsake us, fail us, remove from us, dye, wealth also and
honor are uncertain: There Is no small labor both in getting and keeping them,
as there cannot but be grief in parting with them; yea, for the most part they
prove hurtful, and drown men in perdition: In a word, the commodities of a
better life are infinitely beyond all those in this life.

1. Seeing long life is a blessing, Use 1.
we ought to be heartily thankful to God, that we have lived thus long, and do
yet live.

2. When we crave of God the continuance thereof, 2.
we must so use it, as that it may be a blessing to us, wherein we may get the
assurance of our Salvation, grow in grace, and do good: They that do thus, may
account their life a blessing, for those that do otherwise, it had been good
they had dyed long ago.

3. We must take heed that we do not shorten our lives, 3.
and so deprive out selves of this blessing, through Whoring, Drinking, Gaming;
too too many thus do, as if they should not be ni Hell time enough.

4. We ought to use all good means for the continuance of their lives that be
dear to us, 4.
be careful especially not to provoke God to deprive us of them; so should
Subjects of their Prince and godly Magistrates, People of their faithful
Pastors, Husbands and Wives each of other, etc.

And see good days,] What we are to understand by good days.
That is, enjoy here in this world prosperity and welfare, inward and outward,
in body and soul.

Quest. In Heaven indeed there shall be days, without night, good without the
least mixture of evil, but can good days be enjoyed in this world?

R. In comparison we may, but not absolutely good without evil; for as the best
man is not without sin, In what respects days may be said to be good here.
so he cannot but have inward sorrow of heart, and likewise be subject to
afflictions, every day bringing grief enough with it; yet in comparison of
worse days of horror of conscience, of troubles outward in the Land, of
miseries and vexations that may befall us, we may see good days, that is to say,
Inward peace of Conscience in the assurance of Gods love, and our care to walk
faithfully before God; also we may enjoy Peace in the Land, Plenty, the Gospel,
Health, Wealth, Friends, Wife, Children, etc. and when these are, there are
good days, days freed from calamities and sorrows, and wherein we may
plentifully enjoy comforts and blessings. The day also of a Christians
conversion is a special good day, so the days wherein we do enjoy the purity of
Gods Worship in the Word and Sacraments, so the days wherein we see Gods Church
flourish, so when the Sabbath is duly sanctified, its a good day, so when a
Christian after sin comes to repentance, so the days wherein a Christian walks
with God, and has recourse unto him.

And as thus days may be termed good, In what and to whom evil.
so may they in other respects evil; evil to the ungodly without exception, to
whom even in their greatest prosperity their days be evil; evil also to the
godly, when they cannot enjoy the means of salvation in the life and power of
it, when God seems to hide his face from them, when they have conflicts with
spiritual wickednesses, when the wicked prevail over them; such, I say, (and
are there not such now?) are evil days: yet withal, there is great difference
between the ill days of the wicked and the godly, for the godly are even in the
worst times blessed, even then blessed when they are chastened; Psalm 94. 12.
God also will deliver them in due time, Hos. 6. 3.
yea, will make them glad according to the days they have been afflicted. Here
note,

1. That men's days be usually evil, Men's days be usually evil.
and that both in regard of sin, and the effects thereof.

2. That our life is short, Man's life short
set out here, not by years, but by days, which is elsewhere compared to a post,
grass, a vapor, a Weavers shuttle, etc. Thus is it to the godly in mercy, God
will not have them to be long here in this wicked world; Thus is it to the
wicked in justice, as spending the time here allotted them to Gods dishonor.
Good days are a blessing of God.


That good days are a blessing of God to be delighted in, and desired of Gods
Servants, Deuteronomy 29. 9.
God has promised it, as an encouragement to obedience, Psalm. 119. 165.
they have also prayed for it, Psalm 118. 25. and 122. 7. and its made a sign
of Gods favor and presence with his servants. Genesis 39. 2, 23. 2 Samuel 5. 10.


Obj. But the wicked often enjoy the same.

1. Sol. The wicked may live long, yet have not good days.
Outward prosperity they have, not the inward assurance of Gods favor. 2.
Though they abound in the outward blessing, yet wanting the right hold, and the
right use of it, nay, abusing it to contrary ends, it will prove in the end
through their own sin a curse to them; Their table will be a snare to them, and
their prosperity their ruin; the more outward blessings they enjoy, the more
have they to answer for.

Obj. Why is it often denied even to Gods children, who go through many sorrows?

Sol. Prosperity why denied for the most part to Gods Children.
Though prosperity be in it self a blessing, yet through the corruption of our
nature, it often turns to our hurt; for whereas hereby we should be made more
mindeful of God, to love, praise, and serve him, See Deuteronomy. 32. 15.
and walk more obediently and carefully, through our poysonful nature we are
usually made forgetful of God, proud, secure, worldly, 2 Chronicles. 12. 1. and 26.
16.
contentious, and not only untoward to goodness, but apt to any ill: Isa. 1.
and 5.
The fattest ground is most slippery, fed Horses fling their riders, full
bodies are subject to the Plurifie: Prove. 1. 32.
Adversity has slain some, but prosperity many thousands more: In great
Houses, there is swaggering, swearing, drinking, gaming, etc. whereas in mean
places, there is Reading, Praying, etc. nay, in adversity you shall have the same
persons humble, which in prosperity forgot themselves, as David and Hezekiah:
So that adversity is of singular profit, to drive us to a sight of our sins
with Joseph's Brethren, to keep us from sin, as an hedge of thorns keeps Cattle
out from spoiling the Garden, to abate our pride, and mortify our corruptions,
to wean us from the world, to show us that we are not to look for our portion
here, but set our affections on Heaven, Isa. 5. 17.
where our inheritance is indeed reserved for us. Hereupon the Scripture
pronounces them happy that be afflicted; yet does not this prove, that
adversity in it self is better then prosperity: To us indeed it may be better
through occasion of our corruption, as blood-letting, or the taking of loathsome
Physic may be to diseased bodies.

1. Be we greatly thankful to God that has given us to see so many good days
in the enjoyment of peace, Use 1.
plenty, See Deuteronomy. 8. 10.
the Gospel, Job 62. 9.
particular favors, etc. Our sins have deserved all ill days, and assuredly
such we shall see, if we be not thankful for good days.

2. Crave we of God to continue his goodness toward us, Use 2.
as also grace to use it well, else it will be no blessing, will not abide with
us; we are at all times to walk warily, but more heed is to be taken in time of
prosperity, then adversity, then are we to suspect our selves, lest abusing the
same, we prove unthankful.

Q Whether may we pray for riches, Whether we may pray for prosperity.
and great prosperity, or not?

A. We have no such Warrant in Gods Word, neither commandment, promise, Genesis
28. 20.
nor example; of moderation we have, as in Jacob and Agur: Prove. 30. 8.
And for great wealth without admirable grace, its exceeding dangerous: Mark
10. 23.
Its hard for a rich man to enter into Heaven, not many such are called; to be
thus is no mark of a child of God: If God send it, we are not to refuse it,
but to be thankful, and crave great grace to govern it, and our hearts
therewithal, but we have more cause to fear it, then desire it; but for
competent prosperity we may pray, yet conditionally, because being an outward
thing, we know not but it may prove hurtful, we are to leave it to God that
knows what is best for us; therewith we must also crave the right use thereof,
and to be bettered thereby.

3. When God shall be pleased to lay his hand upon us any manner of way, Use 3.
let us bear the same with patience, God sees the same to be needful for us, as
lanching for a sore, blood-letting or purging to a full body; If God take away
our prosperity, be content, its but one of Gods common blessings, and that
which the wicked have as well as the good, yea, rarely does any man enjoy very
great prosperity in this world, and happiness in the world to come; yea, be we
thankful to God, that (seeing need does so require) he will rather chasten us,
then suffer us to perish in our sins; we are thankful to our bodily Physician,
how much more should we express our thankfulness unto the Physician of our
souls? Neither must we grudge at the prosperity of the wicked, though we be in
trouble; for its better to be here held in awe, thereby that we may rest with
God for ever, then prosper a while here to our minds, and perish hereafter. A
thief on the ladder with the halter about his neck has elbow room, and sits
aloft at his ease, whereas the people below stand crowded and sweating, but
which of the two is in the best condition, who knows not? Thus is it in this
particular.

Q. May we then pray for afflictions?

A. No: Whether we may pray for afflictions.
we have no commandment nor example for it; we may and ought to pray when a
cross is on us that it may be sanctified, but to desire that a cross may befall
us, we must not, as being in it self evil: God turns our sins to our good
oftentimes, yet may not we pray to sin; If God send adversity, we may know that
its needful, which yet through care we might have prevented, as through
profiting by one, we may prevent another trouble. Besides, adversity has no
power in it self to do us good, neither are we very fit to bear the same.

Let him refrain his tongue from evil, etc.] Now of the duties to be performed,
for the compassing of the forementioned blessings, they are eschewing evil, and
doing the contrary good, both in tongue and hand: By evil we may understand,
blasphemy, mocking, lying, cursing, swearing, etc. and thus even Gods children
out of humane frailty, and through the remainder of sin in them, are subject at
some times to sin: Moses spoke unadvisedly, Job cursed the day of his birth,
Peter swore and cursed, etc. but its not their practice, its not their mind so
to do, they are heartily ashamed thereof; Therefore must not their example be
urged for the justification of the wicked, whose continual practice is to use
their tongue to evil. The point from hence observable is this, That

Whosoever would have a good conscience, Whosoever would be happy here and
hereafter, must refrain from evil speaking.
enjoy Gods blessing, and partake of good days here, and eternal life
hereafter, he must refrain his tongue from evil, we must labor to have a good
tongue; The Law of God binds the tongue, as well as the hands, neither can a
bad man or ungoverned tongue enter into Heaven; If any man seem Religious,
James 1. 26.
and bridleth not his tongue, Rev. 21. 8.
his Religion is vain. Again, no unsanctified person can enter into Heaven (the
inheritance there is for the sanctified ones) but whosoever is not sanctified in
tongue, is not sanctified in heart.

1. This condemns the most horrible abuse of the tongue, Use 1.
by the most of the world that make no conscience what they say: Psalm. 12. 4.
Their tongues are their own, who should control them? Multitudes abuse their
tongues to Blasphemy, quarrelling with Scripture, jesting out of the
Scriptures, Swearing, Forswearing, Cursing and Banning, idle, vain and wicked
talking on the Lords day; so in railing, reviling, brawling, miscalling, in
ribaldry, filthy talk, singing bawdy songs; so in backbiting, Matthew. 12. 34.
slandering, See Prove. 10. 20. and 23. 33.
talebearing, guibing, mocking, etc. Such declare unto all, that they have
rotten and unsavory hearts ( for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth
speaks) their Religion also is vain, they want a good conscience; Iam. 3. 6.
Their tongue is set on fire of hell: By their words they shall be condemned,
Mat. 12. 36, 37
for even of every idle word that they speak they must give an account, See
Jude 14, 15
and therefore much more of their blasphemous oaths, etc. yea, even in this
world they may look for some fearful judgment, See of these examples in the
Book of Martyrs.
as befell Denis Benefield for blaspheming, the Gentleman of Cornwall for
swearing, the Sheriffs man for slandering James Abbs, one Leaver for railing on
Mr. Latimer, etc. They that have any spark of grace, let them lay to heart all
their rotten vile communication which God has registered, say not, Words are
but wind; true, in some sense they are wind to blow up the fire of Gods
judgments against us; otherwise, think not they vanish, but know they are all
upon record, and repent, that they be not laid to your charge, else as the
tongue is set on fire of Hell, so will the whole body go thither, as sure as
God is in Heaven. If any have been such evil tongued persons, as, Swearers,
Mockers, Blasphemers, etc. but now from their hearts truly repent thereof, and
do wholly abstain from such speaking, its a good sign that all that is past is
forgiven: O repent of all thy vile words, and for the time to come, use thy
tongue as a Trumpet to sound out Gods praise.

2. As we desire to enjoy Gods blessing and good days, Use 2.
with a good conscience, Means whereby to bridle the tongue.
let us have great care of our tongues and words: To this end 1. We must get a
good heart, for what the tongue speaks, the heart indites. Psalm. 141. 3.
2. We must pray unto God with David, To set a watch before our mouths, Psalm
39. 1.
and to keep the door of our lips. 3. We must take heed thereunto, Reasons
inducing thereto
and watch over the same, for speech is a goodly blessing: The want of it in
any declares it, no creature has it but man, therefore ought it not to be
abused, to the dishonor of God, the hurt of our neighbors, or damning of our
selves; God made our tongues good at first, and fit to praise his name,
therefore must we labor that they may be brought to their first plight: By our
words also we shall be justified or condemned; yea, if we look well to our
tongues, its a sign we have good hearts, and that our Religion is not vain, but
powerful. Again, our tongue, though a little member, yet can do a great deal of
good if well looked to, as, To praise God, Instruct men, Pray, Counsel, Advise,
Admonish, etc. therefore it should be well employed, as the Rudder for the
Ship, and the bit for the Horse; contrarily, if not well looked to, James 3. 3,
4.
it can do a great deal of hurt, as fire or poison: Oh, it can dishonor God,
hurt, poison, vex men, damn our own souls, and was our speech given us to such
ends?

O let none make a small matter of words, for God does not so account of them,
neither let any say, There Is no need of such persuasion to look to the tongue,
its but a little member, therefore easily ruled: James 3. 7.
No, its an unruly evil; Lions and Bears have been tamed, but never man ruled
the tongue, God only can rule it by his Spirit: It will do prodigious and
monstrous things, bless and curse God and men; it daily affords such
contraries: He is a wise and happy man that can hold it in any compass, look to
it narrowly, carry we a straight reign over it, as over an unruly Horse: If at
any time hasty, vain and unsavory speeches have passed from us, lets make
conscience, and repent hereof; neither rest we herein to keep our tongues from
evil, but let our tongues be ready instruments to praise God upon all
occasions, as also to instruct our families, to give good counsel, to speak
plainly, lovingly, and faithfully, to utter gracious words, tending to Gods
glory, and the edifying of our selves and others: So shall we make it appear,
Mat. 12. 35.
that our hearts are good, For a good man, out of the good treasure of his
heart, See Psalm. 37. 30, 31.
brings forth good things; So shall we not only escape many evils from God
and men, that an ill tongue would procure, but we shall see good days, have
peace to our selves, glorify God here, and be glorified with him for ever in
his heavenly Kingdom: This God enables us to do, that thus doing we may enjoy
the blessing.

And his lips that they speak no guile,] Here that evil of the tongue is
prohibited, which is more close and covert, when the words agree not with the
heart nor deeds.

Its not enough to keep the tongue from notorious and open evils, We must
abstain from such evils of the tongue as be close and covert.
but even from guileful, from false deceitful speech: Such as are addicted
hereunto, can have no good conscience, but a guilty heart, and they cannot
prosper, for God sets himself against such, neither can such (so continuing)
come into Heaven.

Of this guile there be many kinds, all naught, yet some worse then others:

1. In Religion toward God: Guile to be avoided in religion toward God.
When men pretend great zeal and forwardness, talk well in good company, and to
be well thought of speak against ill, professing that its the only thing to be
in the favor of God, and that we ought in all things to be ruled by Gods Word,
whose hearts notwithstanding are false, and who dare do many things contrary,
when they can carry them away close: This is an argument of a false heart,
which God hates, for he loves a true Nathanael, and his eyes are upon the
truth, Psalm. 51 6. and 32. 2.
and he loves truth in the inward parts; a certain argument that their sins
are not forgiven them: All their fair words will not serve their turns, they do
merely blind their eyes, their saying Lord, Mat. 7. 21.
Lord, will not save them; their fair goodly words will be but a Rod for
themselves: Deuteronomy 5 28, 29.
O evil servant, out of thine own mouth I will condemn thee: They say well, but
O that there were an heart in them so to do! Psalm. 78. 36, 37
They do indeed but flatter with their mouth, and lie with their tongues, for
their heart is not right.

2. In their carriage toward men; In carriage toward men.
as 1. When through fear, favor or advantage they sooth up and flatter their
Neighbors and Superiors, making their faults small or none at all, nay happily
terming them Virtues, Acts 12. 22.
and extolling them beyond measure; thus did the people to Herod: Prove. 27. 14.
But he that blesses his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the
morning, it shall be counted a curse to him. These speaking against their
knowledge, as they wrong themselves, so do they much hurt to the parties
flattered, keeping them from reproof, and puffing them up, by showing them a
false glass wherein to view themselves; therefore one being asked which were
the worst Beasts, answered, Of wild Beasts, the Tyrant, of tame, the
Flatterer; and that such were worse then Crows (which feed not on the living
Beast, but dead Carrion) preying on them which were alive: If such may be
gainers, they will set their tongues to sale, the Devil may use them to what
speech he will. To speak truly and plainly (men are so proud and impatient)
often breeds hatred; Veritas odium parit.
if we dare not thus speak, yet rather then flatter, lets be silent and say
nothing. 2. When men speak others exceeding fair, and make great promises of
kindeness, but its only for some advantage, or merely in show; for being put
to it, they forget their fair proffers: thus do many wicked Usurers smooth men.
3. When men speak very fair, and courteously salute others, and yet mean not
well, nay ill in heart; salute them kindly, and as soon as their back is
turned, flout at them, rail on them, slander them, yea do them any mischief, of
which the Psalmist complains, Psalm. 28. 3.
The poison of Asps in under their lips. 4. When men speak fair, but intend
mischief, as the Devil when he spoke to Eve, Mat. 22. 16.
Joab when he spoke to Abner, the Pharisees when they spoke to Christ; Psalm.
55. 21.
of such both David and Jeremiah complained. 5. When men speak falsehood, Ier.
9. 8.
and lies in stead of truth, and thereby deceive their Neighbors. See Down^. on
Psalm. 15.
But hereof I have spoken elsewhere at large.

Obj. I have a great charge, therefore I must do thus and thus.

Sol. Two objections answered.
A man's house cannot be established by iniquity.

Obj. Plain dealing is good, but it brings beggary.

Sol. Psalm. 34. 13.
A speech of a profane and unbelieving heart.

As therefore we love life, Use.
and would see good days, let us refrain our tongues from evil, and our lips
that they speak no guile.

Let him eschew evil, etc.] The things to be performed of them that would enjoy
the forementioned benefits:

Evil is of sin or punishment, Amos 3. 6.
of this last God is the Author; called Evil, Isa. 45. 7.
partly because it came in with sin, as a punishment thereof, and partly
because (being tedious, howsoever God turns it to the good of his) it seems
so to us: This we are ready enough to eschew, without bidding (though we be not
wise enough to avoid the cause thereof) yea eschew it by unlawful means, What
sort of evil is here meant.
being rather willing that sin should rest on us, then a cross: But the former
is here meant, whereof not God, Iam. 1. 17.
but the Devil and Man is the Author; for he is that Fountain from whence
comes all good, 1 John 3. 4.
and out of one Fountain cannot come good and evil.

What is this evil of sin? What the evil of sin is, and that we must avoid it.
Its the transgression of the Law of God, For his Law is a perfect Rule of
Righteousness: Whatsoever he requires, is good, whatsoever he forbids, as
contrary to his Law, is thereupon wicked and evil; so that whatsoever is
contrary to Gods Commandment, either by way of Omission or Commission, is evil
and sin: This we must eschew, as the Bullet shot out of a gun, or to be
stricken with a sharp Sword, we must abhor it, as a Toad or Poison; we must
hate it as the Devil, and Hell fire, we must hate and abhor it with a deadly,
an utter hatred, and accordingly avoid it most carefully.

Reasons. Reasons.
1. God is thereby dishonored; Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft: When his
Commandments are obeyed, then is he glorified; 1 Samuel 15. 23.
and who should not glorify him, our Maker, Redeemer, Preserver, Psalm. 106. 29.
Landlord, Lives-lord, Lord and King? 2. Gods wrath is provoked, Ier. 7. 19.
and that must needs be dangerous: Who would stir up a Who can stand before the
Lord when he is angry? 3. God hates it, Psalm. 5. 4.
and such as commit the same. 4. It brought misery into the world, Deuteronomy. 28. 15.
with shame and confusion upon us all, Lev. 26. 14.
and has always been Adam out of Paradise, the old world drowned, and Sodom
burnt, etc. yea, it wounds the Conscience, which God has set in us as a
Monitor, Romans 6. 23.
O who would not hate that Mother which brings forth no better children?
Besides, we shun lesser things, therefore should shun this much more; we shun
crosses exceedingly, which yet are so far from hindering our Salvation, as that
they further the same, but sin is the destruction of our souls.

That sins is worse then all crosses, The evil of sin worse then the evil of
punishment.
appears by the Devils practice, who is that subtle one; he had rather draw
Job to commit sin against God by impatiency, then have power to take away all
his goods: he did this, to bring him to that; and its true, if a man should
break an Arm or Leg, or lose all he has, it were not so bad, or so much to be
shunned, as is sin. Psalm. 97. 10.
To eschew this, is the note of a man that loves God, of a man that fears him;
Job 1. 1.
for eschewing this are Gods Servants commended in Scripture, as on the
contrary, the wicked branded for committing the same.

We are to Eschew all evil, All sins are to be eschewed,
even the least; we must not give way unto any one, Mat. 12. 36.
no not the least idle thought or word, even one is able to destroy us, yea,
and he that breaks one is guilty of all: Yea, and

All persons are to eschew the same, Of all persons.
not the greatest excepted; Gods Law binds them, be they Princes, Magistrates,
Ministers, Householders, etc. They should eschew it most, for by their example
they do most hurt; and as no man's greatness will bear him out, so will not any
man's meanness excuse him in doing of evil. And as all persons are to eschew it,
so must they shun it.

At all times: At all times.
Amonst all the times which the Preacher sets down, Eccles. 3. 2, etc.
there is none for sin; we must serve God in holiness and righteousness all the
days of our life: Luke 1. 75.
Some things be in season at one time, some at another, but sin is never in
season. Many make the Lords days the times of disorder; and they that will be
orderly all the year, yet at Christide they take liberty to riot, gaming,
drinking, etc. as if those times were not to be as well, if not better employed
then others. We must also eschew it.

In all places: In all places.
God is the God of all places, neither can any place change the nature of sin;
thou must eschew sin as well abroad as at home, in thy House, Chamber, Shop, as
well as at Church.

All kinds of sin are also to be avoided, With all the kinds thereof.
Error in judgment, and wickedness in Conversation, evil against God, our
Neighbors, or our selves.

We must also shun and avoid evil, Under what color soever it comes.
under what color or pretense soever it comes (as Usury is pretended to be
lawful on the behalf of Orphans, to kill ones self to preserve Chastity, to
separate from the Church, Dan. 3. 16. and 6. 10.
lest they partake with the wicked, etc.) whosoever does command it (as appears
by the examples of the three Children, Daniel, Acts 4. 19. and 5. 29.
Peter and John) whose example soever we have for it (for we are not to follow
even a multitude (though of great learned men) in evil) though it be never so
gainful (What got Achan, Exodus 23. 2.
Gehazi, Judas by their booties? Our Savior would not listen to the Devils
proffer, that of fered him All the Kingdoms of the world; Mat. 4. 8.
and we should be losers, Mat. 16. 26.
if we did gain the whole world with the loss of our souls) never so pleasannt
(for though it be sweet in the mouth, it will be gall afterward, bite like a
Serpent, and sting like a Cockatrice; for a vain short pleasure to sell our
souls to everlasting pain, were folly indeed:) yea, though we could bring to
pass some good thereby, (we must not do evil that good may come thereof; better
that good be left undone, then that it should be purchased with Gods dishonor,
as to steal, or take usury, that we may do good to the poor, etc.) nay, we must
so hate and eschew evil, With the appearance thereof, and Occasions leading
thereunto.
as we may eschew the very appearance thereof (as to go to a place that is of
ill report, though having no ill purpose, etc.) and must avoid the occasions
leading thereunto (as going in the twylight by the Harlots house, anger,
multitude of businesses, the company of angry persons, multiplying of words,
etc.) yea, if even things good and lawful in themselves be an occasion of evil,
and cause us to offend, we must forbear them (as some in using their
recreations, break out into impatience, and anger, and others cannot leave the
same in any time, better for such to pluck out this their eye, cut off this
their right hand) and to eschew this, we must eschew the persons and places,
where in likelihood we are to be drawn thereunto (as the company of bad
persons, and private familiarity with wicked doers) and that not for any
sinister respect, but because its evil (though happily we may be hated for our
labor) eschewing especially those sins that be most incident to our nature,
complexion, and calling, and whereunto we have been most accustomed.

1. This condemns them that be so far from hating and eschewing evil (though it
be as poison, Use 1.
as the Plague) that they love it with their hearts, live in the continual
practice thereof, drink it down like water, running thereunto, as the horse
rusheth into the Battle: This is the state of most, they are workers of
iniquity, the whole world lies in wickedness, they love not the means nor
persons whereby they may be pulled out of their sins, but eschew them and
goodness, as much as they can; What Rebels be these against God their Maker,
Preserver, Deuteronomy. 32. 6.
and Sovereign? Being made to honor him, will they do nothing but dishonor him,
and so requite all his blessings? will nothing serve those to play with, but
swords, and firebrarnds, and mortal things? nothing please them, but to cross
God? and nothing like them but their own poison? Have they sped so well
formerly that have done thus? Do they provoke the Lord, and not themselves to
the confusion of their faces? If they have vowed, they will have their
pleasures and lusts, whatsoever comes of it, then it must be so, what remedy?
These have no love of God, neither is there any fear of God in them: They are
profane and godless persons, which may look for wages answerable to their
work, shame and the wrath of God in this world, and eternal destruction in the
world to come; For life is in the way of righteousness, but death is in the way
of sin, and the paths thereof tend to Hell: O that these persons would hear the
counsel of Daniel to Nebuchadnezzar, Dan. 4. 27.
even that they would break off their sins by repentance! O turn ye! why will
ye dye? acknowledge I beseech you all your rebellions and treacheries against
God, and that you have deserved hereby to be cut off, entreating yet for pardon
and mercy through Jesus Christ: Turn to God with your whole hearts, and learn
to know that sin is odious, bringing dishonor to God, and destruction upon your
selves: O shun all evil, little and great, shun it at all times, in all places,
how gainful or pleasing so ever, and whosoever commands it, or whomsoever you
see practice it, together with all the appurtenances and occasions of the same.

Means to evil may be these, Means whereby to eschew evil.
1. Labor to understand the ten Commandments, and so what is good and what is
evil. 2. Labor for faith, Watch and pray, Job 31. 1.
that we enter not, neither be led, into temptation. 6. Make we a Covenant
against evil, Psalm. 39. 1.
as Job and David. 7. Call to mind the fearful

2. This also rebukes them that eschew some evil, Use 2.
but not all, nor at all times, or in all places: Being commanded, what will
they not do? What not, for profit, pleasure, preferment? The sins of their
complexion and trade they will in no wise leave; they run upon things, because
lawful, though they cannot use them lawfully; If they can sin secretly, they
make no conscience thereof.

3. This may serve for instruction, Use 3.
with rebuke to most Christians, and to us that be most ancient professors,
that though we have a general purpose against evil, yet we neither hate it so
deeply, nor shun it so carefully as we ought, nor are so much humbled when we
have been overtaken, and have fallen thereinto, as we ought; we complain of our
crosses, Simil.
but grieve not so much that we have fallen into sin. If one should threaten to
run at us with a naked sword, or shoot at us, whenever he could find an
opportunity, we would be wary and watchful upon our going abroad, having an eye
in every corner, etc. O do we thus against sin, which watches but an
opportunity to do us mischief: If we would thus do, we should not be so often
overtaken as we are, we should see better days, escape numbers of crosses, have
more peace to our consciences, more joy in our death, and a freer passage to
Heaven. But alas, we judge even that which is a great evil, to be but a little
one; it pleases us, if we have any color for the same, as that we have but
once committed it, that others do so and so, etc. Thus do we profane the
Lord's Day, despise his Ministers, and run upon all sorts of evils.

4. This affords consolation to all such as do indeed eschew evil, Use 4.
and that out of an unfeigned hatred thereof, rejoicing in nothing more then
when they prevail against it, grieving at nothing more then when they are
overcome thereby; such do indeed love God, such fear him in truth, and so are
beloved of God, and shall be everlastingly blessed; these shall live happily
here, in joy and bliss hereafter: O go on in this Christian course, though the
world hate you, because ye do not as they do, though they call you precise
fools, because ye dare not swallow such goblets as they do, yea, though
hereupon ye pull danger upon your selves, yet must ye eschew evil, and so let
us; Its no matter though we have the worlds frown, as long as we have Gods
favor; and what if we shall miss many a sweet morsel of profit, pleasure, and
promotion, if we be free from the gripes and vexations of conscience, and the
wrath of Almighty God? they that now have their sweet meat, would one day vomit
up their morsels, if they could, as Judas did; who though he rid himself of the
money, yet could not be rid of his wound of Conscience, nor of the Judgment of
God upon him; were they ever the worse, or had they any cause to grieve, that
they had not a share with him in the thirty pieces?

And do good,] Whosoever avoids not evil, cannot do good.
This necessarily follows on the other: No man can have his heart truly nor
aright set to do good, whose heart is not first purged of the love of all evil,
for they cannot stand in one heart and at once; and that man that lives and
bears himself in the practice one sin, never did good aright in his life,
neither ever pleased he God; Who can serve God in one thing, that serves the
Devil in another?

This may serve to rouse up some, Use.
that fain would do well, and many good things they do, but some one old
accustomed sin, which they know is a sin, they cannot leave: Well, there is no
hating sin, it will not do well; the end will not be good, its but to be almost
Christians: Acts 26. 28.
Some will say, Such a Preacher has prevailed much with me, and done me much
good, but as long as one known sin is lived in, all is nothing worth to
Salvation. Its true, a child of God through strong temptations, may be
overcome of the same evil which he hates, but he both covenants against it, is
careful that he may not fall into it, having fallen, he is much grieved: He
that is not grieved, but does again upon the next occasion fall to it, is
indeed in a grievous condition. Thus from the order.

To do good is sometimes taken in a strict sense, for the performance of the
works of mercy, Acts 10. 38.
whether for body or soul, Heb. 13. 16.
or both: Here more largely for that good we are to do to our neighbor, Isa. 1.
17.
enemies that do us hurt, Romans 2. 10.
or yet more largely, for whatsoever God has commanded in his Word, Whose will
is a perfect rule of Righteousness, and makes that good which he requires.

Whosoever would see good days here and hereafter, Doctr.
must set himself in body and soul to the obedience of Gods will in doing good:
Christians must be doers of good.
No other shall be saved; good is the way leading to this end: To come to this
end, John 5. 29.
we must walk in this way.

Reasons: Reasons.
1. Its good and amiable of it self, as the Lord is. 2. God Thou shall do thus
and thus (says he often throughout the Scriptures) for I am the Lord thy God.
3. All promises in Scripture of good things, here or hereafter, are made to
well-doing; as in Levit. 26. and Deuteronomy. 28. may appear. David rejoice when they
offered willingly to the Temple? Isa. 38. 3.
Hezekiah, when such care was used in keeping the Passover? and the Eunuch,
when he Mat. 7. 21.
5. This brings us to eternal happiness in the world to come. John 5. 29.
6. Its the glory of a man when he is dead: The godly Kings are yet commended,
Romans 2. 10.
That they did that which was good in the sight of the Lord; this was their
Crown, and that which is to be desired of a man, is his goodness.

For the extent of this, we must do all good that we can, and our places
require, Psalm. 119. 6.
having respect unto all Gods Commandments: Thus did Josiah, Luke 1. 6.
He did according to all the Law of Moses; 2 King. 23. 25.
He that commanded one, We must do all the good we can.
commanded another: Whosoever does willingly pass by any one duty, declares himself
an hypocrite, And who so lives in any one sin, is guilty of the breach of the
whole Law.

We must do good at all times: At all times.
Aguish fits of goodness, as before the Communion, or in afflictions, etc. God
cares not for; he will have us to be ever doing some good, and ever fitting our
selves to do more.

We must do good in all places; In all places.
not in the Church only, but at home in our Houses and Shops, yea, when we are
furthest from home.

So in all companies we must do good, In all companies.
or take good; if we cannot do what we would, we must do what we can; its some
good to keep away evil.

We must do good to all persons, To all persons
all duties toward God, publicly, privately, on his Sabbaths, on other days,
so toward our Families, Neighbors, Friends, Superiors, Inferiors, Equals: We
must do good as occasion offers it self, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 15.
yea, toward our enemies that do us hurt, as to our selves also, In our
general calling.
and that in respect of body, soul, goods, good name: We must do good in our
general callings as Christians, In our particular calling. Though it be hard
and difficult.
by our holy conversation agreeable to our profession, and by our Counsels,
Exhortati^ns, Admonitions, Reproofs, Prayers: We must do good also in our
particular callings, as, Magistrates, Ministers, Husbands, Wives, Parents,
Masters, etc. This is so necessary, as that he which does not good in his
special calling, is no good man: We must do good also, though it be hard and
difficult so to do; naturally we are prone unto evil, and it comes off hand
easily, but to do good is harsh; Gods Commandments are as a yoke to the flesh,
though easy to the Spirit, a burden to the flesh, but light and comfortable
to the Spirit: To pray, read, instruct our families, is painful; so to study,
preach, hunt out disorder, set up goodness, see the poor set on work, and the
like; but as we would partake of the reward, which is indeed great here and
hereafter, we must not shrink at this labor: If one way will not serve the
turn, whereby to bring to pass our Religious purposes, we must set upon
another, Luke 5. 18.
as they that carried the man of the Palsy, not being able for the preass to
enter in at the door, uncovered the roof of the house, and through it let him
down: We must do good, though we have no thank for our labor (as Moses and
Aaron on the peoples behalf whom they conducted out of Egypt, though they were
unthankfully dealt with) yea, though we have ill will and hard measure, as they
that seek to punish sin shall have of evil doers; Dan. 6. 10.
nay, though the greatest be against it, as Daniel prayed to God, though the
King forbade it, and danger was to follow upon it: Thus the Prophets spoke the
truth, though with danger of their lives, Elijah, Micaiah, John the Baptist,
etc. Thus the Martyrs confessed the faith boldly, though with loss of their
lives: Josh. 24. 15.
We must do good also, though we have few encouragements, and small company
(such was Joshua's resolution) nay, though we be as it were alone, as Noah in
that generation, Lot in Sodom, Elias, etc. we must preach still, though we see
but little fruit of our labor: We must do good, Eccles. 9. 10.
while we may, Gal. 6. 10.
while life and means last, yea, and constantly; Romans 2. 7.
and to that end (many take up Prayers in their Family, but quickly leave them
off) neither must we only do good, And in a good manner.
but we must do it well (for even the best things in the world may be marred in
the doing, Isa. 1. 11. and 58. 2.
as Alms and Prayer by hypocrisy and opinion of merit) and therefore we must
be regenerate persons, and by Faith be reconciled to God in Christ: We must
also do the same in a particular Faith, Josh. 24. 14.
and in uprightness of heart, 1 Chronicles. 28. 9
declaring the same by the reformation of our lives; and this must be in
obedience to God, aiming at his glory, 1 Pet. 5. 2.
and not seeking our selves, 2 Cor. 8. 12.
either in our profit, pleasure or credit, etc. all which must be done
willingly.

1. This shows the wretchedness of our corrupt nature, Use 1.
that good being in it self so lovely, and there being so many great Reasons to
persuade us thereto, yet our nature is most averse therefrom.

2. This condemns those which are so far from this, Use 2.
that they be enemies to goodness: The more Spiritual and holy any duty is, the
less they can away therewith; as Prayer, Meditation, Conference with the godly,
etc. nay, they hate goodness in others, whether Magistrates, Ministers, or
private Christians; yea, are so wholly opposite to good, as they are wholly
given over to evil.

3. This condemns those, Use 3.
who though they be restrained, and break not out into evil, yet have no heart
nor love to that which is good: They be no swearers, nor disordered persons in
their Families, yet they do not pray, instruct, and do good in their Families;
they neither profane the Sabbath, nor yet keep it holy; they keep not bad
company, yet love not the company of the Saints; they spend not on wicked
purposes, and yet do no good with that they have; they be no enemies to
Religion, but they be not zealous friends; they be no maintainers of disorders
in Towns, yet do not zealously set themselves against such.

This is not sufficient to make a good man, nor to see good days; for, Every
tree that bears not good fruit, Mat. 7. 17.
shall be hewn down; and, Mark 11. 21.
the barren Figtree was cursed; Luke 19. 22.
and, the Servant that did no good with his Talent (in the mean time he had
done no hurt therewith) was cast out; It will not go for payment, nor bear out
any, that they have done no hurt, but what good have they done? even we our
selves will scarce keep a Cat or Dog, merely for this, that they do no hurt,
except they do some good; neither will we think well of those Servants, who
being negligent in our absence, shall say, We have done you no hurt, have not
robbed you of your goods, railed at you, wronged your children, etc. for that
which they should also have been diligent in their work; It will be demanded of
us, whether Magistrates, Ministers, Householders, or others, what good we have
done.

4. This condemns all those that fail in the doing of good, Use 4.
or in the manner thereof, and so lose their labor, and have no comfort of
themselves; as they that will do some good duties, not others; as Read, not
Pray; come to the Word, not to the Sacraments; come to both, but omit Family
duties: They that do not good duties at all times, but take liberty to shake
them off and banish them (so did not David) nor in any places (happily devout at
Church, Psalm. 119. 20.
careless elsewhere) nor in all companies (doing good only as Saul among the
Prophets) nor to all persons (some will seem to give God his due, in the mean
time dealing unjustly with men, as some (with civil persons) are careful in
this, careless in that: Others also will do well to strangers, but not to their
Families; as others to their friends, but cannot away with their enemies; and
others though submiss to their Superiors, yet are harsh to their Inferiors;) so
they that will then only do good, when they find it easy to be done, who yet
in the mean time take great pains to do wickedly; so they that will not do any
good, except when they may be commended for it, and have good will for their
pains; so they that still say they will, and they will do good, but defer the
same so long, that death takes hold on them; so they that think to do good in
their end, who should do it in their life, the present time is indeed the time
wherein to do good; so they that do good for a while, but after break off; See
Isa. 1. 11.
so they that do good things, but in a corrupt manner, without Faith, and
seeking themselves therein, or merely in hypocrisy: All these (mark me well)
that make their practice of doing good in this fashion, its as good never
awhit, as never the better. I deny not, but a good man may herein at some times
fail through weakness, or by reason of some temptation; but whosoever usually
thus does, does bewray himself to be but an hypocrite, and as he thus works,
so accordingly shall he have his reward with hypocrites.

5. This serves for consolation to all those whose hearts are unfainedly
affected to good, Use 5.
and which are ready to every good God requires of them in their general or
special callings, at all times, in all places, toward all, even in things most
difficult and dangerous, desiring unfainedly to do them in a right manner; 3
John. ver. 11.
they do what is good in the sight of the Lord, hereupon they shall have comfort
for the present, and hereafter life everlasting: Such are indeed of God.

6. This is also for instruction to us all, Use 6.
that we give our selves with greater diligence to that that is good, and to do
much good in our general and special callings, taking pains thus to do both
publicly and privately; such as join not with us herein, shall want their part
in our comfort: This shall be our Crown, and will accompany us to life eternal;
the more good we do, the more joy shall we have in our lives, the more comfort
in death, and the greater glory in the world to come.

Let him seek peace and ensue it.] Another duty to be done of all those that
would live long, and see good days, They must seek peace and ensue it.
Christians must seek after peace.
Men that seek not peace, shall not find it; and without peace, what comfort
can any have of their life? Neither can any enjoy eternal life, that seek not
after peace; for God is that God of peace, and all that are his must love
peace, and therefore has God given us his Gospel of peace, as to reconcile us
to himself in Jesus Christ, so also to teach us to live in peace one with
another: We must therefore not only keep it when we have it, See Acts 4. 32.
and accept it, being offered, but wanting it, 1 Cor. 1. 10.
seek after the same, 2 Cor 13. 11.
seek after it, as covetous men do after Money, Gal. 5. 22.
the hungry after meat, Hunters after their prey; if it run or fly from us,
Ephesians. 4. 3.
we must run and fly after it: 1 Thessalonians. 5. 13.
This is again and again both commanded and commended, James 3. 17.
is a fruit of the Spirit, and of the wisdom that comes from above.

Now we must seek after peace, How we must seek peace.
1. By living innocently and harmlesly with our Neighbors (such as harm them
either in word or deed, are enemies to peace.) 2. By living helpfully, and
doing good in our places, as Magistrates, Ministers, etc. 3. By passing by such
small wrongs as are done unto us, not so much as taking notice thereof, and for
others of more moment, to compound them of our selves, or refer them to
indifferent neighbors, which notwithstanding (if they must needs be determined
by Law) must not break off peace, or occasion the omission of any neighborly
duty. 4. By parting with some of our right to have peace: Herein we must not
stand upon terms, though happily it were fit our adversary should come to us, as
being Younger, Inferior in place, or who first gave the cause of offense, yet
rather then contention should continue, we must pass by all those, and go to
him; Genesis 13. 8.
even Abraham yielded to Lot: And this we must do, nor with some persons only,
but even with all; not with the rich only, but the poor also, as being our
fellow servants, members of Christ, as we are, and such of whom we may stand in
need both in prosperity and adversity; neither with the meaner sort only, and
not with the rich and wealthy (as if it were of a brave mind to stand out with
them, and not to regard them) but with the one as well as the other; yea, nor
with the good only (though with them chiefly) but with the bad also (even
Abraham maintained peace with Abimelech) yet so, Genesis 21. 32.
as that we may keep our peace with God, not consenting with them in their
evil, nor doing evil, or neglecting our duty for their good will. A just War is
better then an unjust Peace: 2 Chronicles. 18. 1. and 19. 1.
A Nation may have with Infidels a League of Peace, though not of Amity; so we
must have peace, See Romans 12.
but not with ill conditions, to yield to unlawful things: Woe be to that peace
that makes partition with God, Heb. 12. 14.
and breaks the peace of our own Conscience; Mat. 10. 34.
our Savior Christ came not to bring such peace, but the Sword. It will be
better by being faithful, to have favor with God, and peace in our selves,
though we reap the ill will of our Neighbors, then that God should curse us for
our unfaithfulness, and the wicked* also in Hell for following their ways. Thus
must Husbands and Wives, Ministers and People, etc. keep peace one with
another, otherwise we must be contented rather to be counted troublesome, Ier.
15. 10.
and breakers of peace.

This we must seek after, Reasons.
1. Because its so pleasing to God, he is Mat. 5. 9.
On the contrary, the Devil delights 1 Timothy 2. 8.
Our hands must be lifted up without wrath, whosoever is addicted hereunto, can
neither pray aright, nor duly partake Psalm. 133. 3.
like the ointment which was poured on Aarons head (which was made of most
fragrant sweet things) and to the dew upon new mowed grass: O how sweet is it
to them that do enjoy it! how sweet to the lookers on? what a comely thing is
it, to see a Land agree in it self, so a Town, a Family? Its as an instrument,
whereof all the strings be in tune: Prove. 17. 1.
Better is a dry morsel with this, then an house full of Sacrifices with
strife: and 15. 17.
Better is a dinner of herbs, where love is, then a stalled Ox and hatred
therewith: Prove. 21. 9.
Better to be in the corner of the house top, then with a contentious woman in
a wide house. 4. Great is the profit hereof, See Ier. Lam.
so is peace exceeding fruitful: O how does a Land increase by peace, and how
do Wars, Concordia parvae res crescunt, discordia magna dilabuntur.
whether civil or foreign, waste and consume the same! little things by
concord wax great, great things through discord come to nothing; when there is
peace in a Town between the Pastor and People, what good may be done? what evil
avoided? where there is not, neither can evil be suppressed, nor good
established. A Town knit together in peace, is like a faggot fast bound, that
cannot be bent, but divided, like the several sticks of the faggot, which may
easily be broken; the like may be said of Husbands and Wives, Masters and
Servants, Mat. 12. 25.
Parents and Children, A Kingdom, City, or house divided against it self cannot
stand. 5. If we live in peace we are fit to do

1. This condemns all contentious and quarrellous Spirits, Use 1.
that regard not peace, but their own will, are never well, but when they are
contending, are so far from seeking peace, as they cannot keep it when they
have it, Psalm. 120. 7.
nor accept it when its offered; and so far from following it, as they fly
from it, as those of whom the Psalmist complained: Others regard it not as they
ought, will fall out and break the peace even for trifles, offer the occasion
of strife, and harm their Neighbors both by words and deeds, in goods and good
name; yea, if the least wrong be done them, they will hear of no
reconciliation, but break off all love, 1 Cor. 3. 3.
quarrel, go to Law, etc. Every place abounds with such: These bewray
themselves not to be led by Gods Spirit, Iam. 3. 15.
nor endued with the wisdom from above; nay that they are carnal, and filled
with devilish and fleshy wisdom; these either never pray, or lose their labors,
for as good not pray at all, as pray in wrath: These in stead of good days
here, shall have vexation, neither shall they hereafter inherit the Kingdom of
Heaven, Romans 2. 8.
but shall meet with indignation and wrath.

2. This rebukes those that live at peace, Use 2.
but its after this manner; they will have peace with some, but not with others;
whereas we ought to be at peace with all, not with the poor only, but with the
rich also, nor with the good only, but with the bad also; some there are that
fail every of those ways, as a number that will be at peace with the bad, See
Prove. 1. 10, etc.
not with the good, and have peace with the wicked in their wickedness (which
is indeed fearful) yea, buy peace with hard and ill conditions, as consenting
to evil, or neglecting good: Some that they may be counted peaceable men, will
not stir against any disorder; woeful peace! let men give of their own right for
peace, but not of the Lords.

3. This serves to comfort them that love peace, Use 3.
and desire it with all their hearts, and can be content to seek it in any
honest and lawful way, and that for conscience, and that they may serve God the
better, and for that God requires the same, in the mean time being careful to
avoid wrangling, and jarring, etc. assuredly such are at peace with God, and
howsoever the world deals with them, enjoy the peace of a good conscience.

4. Let this encourage us all to set more by peace then pearls, Use 4.
to seek it diligently, and to be content rather to lose any reasonable thing,
then this: This is pleasing to God, is also comely; so shall our Prayers be
accepted, so shall we be strong to all good, and against all evil, so shall we
see good days here, and eternal peace with God hereafter. To this end we must
avoid all the enemies of peace, The enemies of peace to be avoided.
and labor for the contraries, as, 1. Pride, which breaks peace many ways, as
when men have not more honor then is indeed their due, Pride.
as Haman, or when any is honored besides themselves, as Saul, when David was
commended in the dance; Pride also makes men think so highly of themselves, and
meanly of others, as they will be ready to offer injury, and yet think it
small, and if the least wrong be done them, think it so heinous, as no
recompense can be made for it: They must forsooth by no means be blamed in any
thing, else they swell, break peace, and part company; this we must avoid, and
labor for humility, Covetousness.
which is contrary hereunto. 2. Covetousness, the covertous man is angry if he
have not every good bargain, or if the least trespass be done him: If but a
Goose of their neighbors grase in their ground, O its such a loss, such a
wrong, that they must not put it up: Frowardness.
They will part with no piece of right for all peace. 3. Frowardness, Prove 16.
28.
For a froward man sows strife, we must labor for a meek and patient spirit.
Talebearers;
4. Talebearers; A whisperer separateth chief friends: They be the Devils
Pedlers, let them not open their packs, nor unlade their wares in our ears,
thereby to infect our minds; He that listens to them, shall never have peace:
The world is full of such, yea, such as on both sides are Tale carriers, which
with some few truths intermingle numbers of lies, they are the Devils seedsmen
to sow strife: If God pronounce the Peacemakers blessed, Mat. 5. 9.
then woe to those Make-bates; of this number we are not to repute those which
inform Parents and Masters, of some abuses in their children and servants,
unknown unto them, provided it be done in love, and that for the redress of the
same.

5. If we must labor to have peace with men, Use 1.
then much more with God, who is at enmity with us because of our sins, and
that through Christ alone, who is our Advocate with him: This will afford more
true joy, 1 John 2. 1.
then the world either knows, or can: Till we procure this, we can have no
true peace with our neighbors, no true peace of conscience.

Verse 12. For the eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous, and his ears are
open unto their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.
THat those which perform the forementioned duties shall have long life and
good days here and hereafter, and that the contrary shall befall those that do
not thus do, our Apostle here proves: Such as thus do, God will have a care of
them, and watch over them for good, and for the others, God will set himself
against them; where an Objection is prevented.

Oh, The prevention of an Objection.
might some say, that such as live most harmlesly, and do most good, and be
best disposed, and love peace and quietness, should of all others be most
hated, and lie open to manifest dangers, and they that will scamble and shift
for themselves by right or wrong, not caring whom they wrong, do yet wax great,
and prove rich in the world: True, says the Apostle, If peaceable and good men
were here left to themselves, they would be soon thrust to the walls, and be as
sheep among wolves, ready to be spoiled; but God does not so leave them, but
has a continual care over them, to defend them from dangers, as much as shall
be fit for them; and if they fall into any, he is ready to hear their prayers,
and to help them: and for the others, they may prosper a while (which yet some
of them do not) but it shall not always so continue, God will set his face
against them, and his fury root them out.

By Eyes we are to understand the diligent and watchful care that the Lord has
over his people, See Deuteronomy. 11. 12
as the mother whose eye is over the young child that it take no hurt.

And by Ears is meant, his great readiness to hear their Prayers, and grant
their requests.

By Face is meant, Psalm. 25. 16. and 27. 9.
sometimes his favor and love, as in the Psalms; sometimes his wrath and
displeasure, as here; for a man's favor or displeasure is seen by his
contenance: Thus are other parts of man ascribed to the Lord, as, his Hand,
Right hand, Arm, etc.

Q. But why are these attributed to the Lord, not being in him?

A. Because if the Lord should speak unto us weak men of himself, Why Eyes,
Ears, Face, etc. are attributed to God.
and as he is in himself, we were utterly unable to bear it, but being willing
that we should understand him, he speaks according to our capacity, as the
nurse to the child. Because we know not how one should see without eyes, or
watch over any for good, therefore God ascribes eyes to himself; and because
our power lies in our right hand, therefore does he ascribe a right hand to
himself, the like may be said about his ears, etc.

1. This should greatly provoke us to the reading and exercising our selves in
the Scriptures; Use 1.
for that we may so do in them, the Lord vouchsafed to stoop very low for our
understanding: If we do it not, it must needs be great neglect and
unthankfulness, wherein notwithstanding too too many fail.

2. Ministers, Use 2.
whose office it is to teach the Lords people, must be careful to frame
themselves to their understanding and edifying, and not to soar aloft, thereby
stirring up admiration in their people without profit: If God stoop so low,
must any so far seek themselves, as not to follow such a pattern? O its a
greater mercy to edify and convert one soul, then that a thousand should go
away merely commending them for learning and eloquence.

By Righteous we are not to understand such as be so in their own conceit, Whom
we are to understand by Righteous, and why they are so called.
but such as are in Gods account truly Righteous, perfectly by imputation of
Christ's Righteousness, and imperfectly by inherent here begun and increased,
but which shall hereafter be perfected: Righteous, I say, 1. By imputation of
Christ's Righteousness to us by Faith, For Christ which knew no sin, 2 Cor. 51.
21.
became sin for us, that we might be the Righteousness of God in him. 2. By
inherent Sanctification of the Spirit conveyed from Christ, which though it be
imperfect, yet is of the better part of their Righteousness, and the rather,
because they are desirous to do well, and do it willingly, but sin against
their will, as an heap of corn is so called, though it be not without chaff. 3.
Because of their endeavor to be more and more Righteous, as a young Apprentice
is called by the name of his Trade, Simil.
because of his endeavor and purpose, though he can do but a little in it; so
that they which be such, may be of good comfort notwithstanding their
imperfections remaining, God accounts them Righteous and holy persons,
howsoever the world esteems of them.

By them that do evil is not meant, Use.
such as fall into sin through weakness and infirmity, Whom we are to
understand by them that do ill.
but such as give themselves thereto, and make a trade thereof, living and
lying therein without repentance, against such does the Lord set himself.

The eyes of the Lord are over the Righteous,] The Lord cares for the
Righteous.
That is, God has an especial care of his righteous servants; he loves them
dearly, and watches over them for their good; Deuteronomy. 11. 12.
They are his portion and inheritance, Psalm. 33. 12. and 146. 8.
they are his Spouse, they are his children, whose care exceeds both the
fathers and the mothers; Psalm. 103. 13.
when both these forsook David, the Lord did not leave him, Mat. 6 9.
Psalm. 27. 10. He causes all creatures to do them good, Isa. 49. 15.
and serve their turns: He appoints the Angels to preserve them, as Elisha;
destroy their enemies, as it befell Senacheribs host; bring them good tidings,
as to the Shepherds; defend them, etc. Judges 5. 20.
The very Stars in their courses must fight for Israel, the Hailstones slay his
enemies, Josh 10. 13.
Frogs, Lice, Caterpillars, etc. plague the Egyptians for Pharaohs
disobedience; yea, he will cause all things to go contrary to the course of
nature, rather then they shall miscarry, the waters must divide themselves, the
Sun stand still and go backwards, the stony rock yield water, the fire must not
hurt the three children, nor the Lions Daniel. He that cared for man, and
provided all things necessary for him before he was, is now no less careful for
his reconciled ones; his care is effectual, continual, he both preserves them
from evil, Psalm. 33. 18, 19 and 121. 8.
and provides for them good things; the very hairs of their head are numbered,
and he that touches them, touches the Apple of his eye: Mat. 16. 30.
How did he preserve Noah, Lot, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, David, Zech. 2. 8.
Elijah, Peter, etc. which of us also has not escaped thousands of dangers
through his eye over us?

But do not the righteous fall into many troubles, Obj.
as the examples of Abel, Micaiah, Jeremiah, the Apostles and Martyrs clearly
show.

Gideon indeed by reason of the troubles of Gods people in his days, Sol.
thought that God was not with them, Judge. 6. 13.
but it was otherwise: Gods eye is not so over them as that he promises to
keep them out of all danger, but so to dispose, as that nothing shall fall out
to their hurt; he keeps them from man, and disposes so, that when any do befall
them, the same tends to their good: Thereupon they become humbled, thereby
their Faith and patience tried, in the mean time they are enabled of God to
bear them, See Psalm. 32. 6.
and through him delivered in due time therefrom, Isa. 45. 2.
if not, thereby the sooner they enter into Heaven.

God does preserve the wi^^ed also, Obj.
and provide for them.

Though they are preserved from some, Sol.
yet into how many do they fall? especially how do they fall into sin daily?
and how soon they shall fall into Hell who knows? Psalm. 37. 19.
The Lord also provides for his own, as for the Israelites in the wilderness,
for Elias in the time of famine, for Jacob in Padan-Aram, etc. many have had
experience hereof, beyond that they could have looked for.

1. This serves to comfort all those which can prove themselves righteous; Use
1.
such may safely depend on God, Psalm. 23. and 27.
in the very midst of dangers: How many or great soever they may be, 1 King. 6.
16.
had we but the eyes of faith, we might perceive that there are more with us
then against us? He that is Almighty and All-sufficient cares for us; He also
takes our cause in hand, so that being wronged, we need neither be impatient
nor revenge our selves, but commit it unto him that judges righteously; He
also will provide for us things needful, and therefore must not we murmr,
grudge, or use unlawful means; He that feeds the Ravens, and clothes the
Lillies, will assuredly be careful of us, only we must not be wanting unto our
selves, through neglect of our callings, or trusting too much therein, but
commend our selves therein unto God by Prayer.

2. Let such as are not as yet righteous, Use 2.
get into the number of righteous persons; till then, they lie open to all
danger, are outlaws, have no right to any promise, neither are under Gods care
or protection: Oh! could they see their condition, they might perceive it to be
most fearful; but happy is the state of the righteous, happy are they whom God
loves and cares for.

And his ears are open unto their prayers,] Here note,

The readiness of the Lord to hear his Servants prayers, God hears the prayers
of his Saints readily.
and to grant their requests; the like is elsewhere often expressed. They are
acceptable to him, Psalm. 145. 18.
as incense and sacrifice; yea, he prefers them before those: Isaiah 65. 24.
They are available before him; Psalm. 141. 2. and 50. 15. and 69. 31.
the Examples of Abraham, Jacob, David, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Daniel, etc. manifest
the same: They are available to prevent dangers, as Hezekiah's Senacheribs
Army: Available to remove dangers entered, Iam. 5. 16.
as the prayers of Moses and Aaron stayed the Plague; therefore when God was
not purposed to grant a thing, he bade his Servants that they should not pray;
as Jeremiah, Ier. 7. 16.
Pray not for this people; yea protested, that though Noah, Job, and Daniel
should pray, Ezekiel. 14. 14.
yet he would not hear them; he is a Father, merciful, Matthew. 7. 11.
gracious, full of pity and compassion: If earthly fathers can give good things
unto their children asking them, how much more will the Lord unto his? He
cannot deny the prayers of his own children, endited by his Spirit, and offered
in the Name of the Lord Jesus, who sits at his right hand; yea, he hears
not only the eloquent and large prayers of his Servants, Isa. 38. 14.
but even their stuttings, as Hezekiahs; and when there is no voice, 1 Samuel 1.
13.
but sighs and groans, as Hannahs, and Jonahs in the Whales belly: Jonah 1. 2.
For prayer is the labor of the Spirit and Heart; and God delights in such
prayers, though he will have the voice when it can be, and looks that men
should pour out their hearts and wants at large, yet he will accept of such
prayers as come from the sincerity of upright hearts.

But every kind of prayer will not pierce the clouds, What prayers prevail
with God.
and come into Gods presence, and prevail with him, but such as are according
to his own will; prayers made in understanding, not like those of the Papists
in an unknown tongue, or those amongst our selves which use the Creed and ten
Commandments as prayers, or theirs which mark not what they say, whose Prayers
are mere bablings; Prayers also in sincerity, Prayers in faith, knowing that we
are reconciled unto God through Christ, Prayers in repentance, in love, fervent
Prayers, continued Prayers, with fasting, not prescribing the Lord either the
time, means, or manner of our deliverance; See Psalm. 145. 18. Jer. 29. 13. John
5. 15. Mark 11. 24. Psalm 66. 18. Proverbs 28. 9. 2 Timothy 2. 19. John 9. 31.
Isa. 58. 9. 1 Timothy 2. 8. Isa. 1. 15. Psalm 51. Daniel 9. James 5. 16. Luke
18. 1. Romans 12. 12. This has been the strength and defense of this Land, and
if it were not for Prayer, and the remnant of the righteous, that cry to God
night and day both publicly and privately, and stand in the gap to avert his
indignation, we could not but have looked for some heavy judgment on this Land
ere now, the iniquities thereof do so fearfully abound, and that in every
corner, such as are the contempt of his Word, Sacraments and Servants, horrible
Blasphemies, Sabbath-breaking, and the like; yea, which of us having prayed
aright, have not had experience of the truth hereof, even that God has many a
time, and in many particulars, given ear unto our desires, Psalm. 73. 25.
and granted our poor Prayers? There is none that can hear or help but he, and
its his honor to right the cause of his poor Saints and Servants. How it may
appear that God hears their prayers readily.
This his readiness to hear their prayers, appears diversely, as that 1. He
makes a way for them by his sons blood to come to him, which else they durst
not. 2. He gives us his Spirit, to work faith in us, and to wash us clean, and
to embolden us to call him Father, Romans 8. 26.
and to pray aright, who knew not how to pray of our selves; Its a sign that he
has a mind to hear us, Hos. 14. 3.
who puts a Supplication into our mouths. Prove. 50. 15.
3. He commands us, Matthew. 7. 7.
and sets us on work so to do. 4. He has also promised for our better
encouragement to hear us, and grant our requests.

Obj. Psalm. 22. 1.
But have not Gods Servants, with David, complained that the Lord has not
heard them? Why the Lord hears not nor grants not sometimes the prayers of his
children.


A. True, But not in respect of any unwillingness in him, but sometimes because
they pray not aright, or that they pray the more carefully, or to try whether
they will continue, or break off by and by (as our Savior did by the woman of
Canaan) or for that he would have us set the more short by it, Matthew. 15. 23.
when we have it, and be the more thankful, and use it the better, else soon
gotten, and soon forgotten, lightly come, and lightly gone; sometimes also
because the time is not yet fit. Simil.
A Child would have the milk, though but newly come scalding off the fire: The
unruly Patient would have the Plaster taken off, as soon as it begins to
smart; such are we, but God will hear and help in the due, in the best time:
Sometimes the Lord grants not at all what his righteous servants crave, Why?
because he cannot, or is not willing, nay, because its not good for us; as if a
child should ask a knife of his Father, he would deny it: If for matters of
soul, as deliverance from temptations, the Lord answers not our petitions, 2
Cor. 12. 9.
he yet gives strength to resist them (as to the Apostle Paul) which is far
better; for its no mastery to have no temptations, but to overcome temptations,
and to have no hurt thereby: If for outward things, craving freedom from
crosses, sicknesses, loss, etc. the Lord does not free them, but gives them
some Spiritual grace, profitable for their souls, Simile.
this is far better then that they asked. If one should ask silver, and have
the weight in gold given him, what wrong were done him? So if one in stead of
health and long life here should soon dye, yet to be translated into Heaven,
and there to live for ever; sometimes we ask a greater measure of outward
things then the Lord grants, but yet gives us a contented mind, and assurance
of eternal riches in Heaven; either then he grants the thing we desire, or
gives us a better in its stead, and so not break promise with us.

1. This sets out Gods wonderful goodness and mercy, Use 1.
that will vouchsafe to stoop, to look so low, as to look to such poor unworthy
Creatures as we are, what are we? dust and ashes, sinful men and women; and
what is he? The infinite immortal God, the Lord of the whole World, most holy
and most pure: This comes by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we are
accepted.

2. This is a singular comfort to the righteous, Use 2,
that God has not left us in this world of trouble, without any means to help
our selves; No: he has left a mean in our hands, to help us in whatsoever
distress; he sets us on work to pray, and has promised to hear and help.
Hereunto has God annexed his promises, neither is there any case, wherein
prayer cannot help us: O this is a wonderful encouragement to us in all times,
and in all necessities! If by prayer we fly unto God, there is remedy; If we need
any grace (as we do continually) God upon our asking has promised to give it:
The like may be said of patience, meekness, humility, a tender heart, and the
like; O that we should be so often wanting unto our selves! how much grace, and
how much good have we lost for want of asking? God has infinite store, neither
is he loath to part therewith, he has it to bestow, and its his glory to
bestow it: He has made the way, offers to teach us to pray, and promises to
hear us, and yet what dullness is in us? how seldom pray we? Many of us can go
out in the morning without prayer, neither have recourse unto God all the day
long: He is more forward to give, then we to ask, and yet who has the benefit?
not he, but our selves; we shut out our selves, when God has opened the door;
we know not what we have lost, when we have lost a prayer, when we have
neglected it upon every trifling occasion: We feel not our wants, we prize not
grace, we consider not the worth and excellency of prayer. We trade to the
Indies, and other dangerous places for gain, and that with great hazard;
there is no hazard to Heaven, send but out a well prepared prayer, it never
returns empty: If we be in sickness, we rest too much on the means, and too
little in prayer: so for our callings, as also for deliverances out of dangers,
we make friends, but pray not at all.

3. Be we hereupon stirred up to be more frequent in this duty, Use 3.
and to make more account of it, for Grace, for Wisdom, for help in danger, for
a Blessing in any thing we go about, what other means soever we use, let prayer
be one, let not that be left out: This can do as much, much more then any
other, only keep our prayers in good tune, as horses be kept in breath: If we
thus do, we shall assuredly obtain, only we must wait Gods good leisure; if we
obtain not that we pray for, we shall have better in the stead of it: If we
find them granted, we must, Dan. 2. 20.
with Daniel and his fellows, return praises; yea, besides our own prayers, we
should have a stock going in sundry godly friends hands, to get their prayers
for us always, but especially when we are in extremity: If any thing in the
world help, its this; But need we go seeking to Saints departed? Simil.
If the King should call us to him, and encourage us by promises, were it not
folly in us to seek up and down for a Nobleman to help us to speech with him?

4. This sets forth the difference between the righteous and the wicked: Use
4.
Those are dear to God, his Favorites, near, great in the Court of Heaven: Pro.
15. 8, 29.
These he cannot away with, their persons are odious, Psalm. 14 4.
and so is their service; they either pray not at all, which is usual with
profane wretches, or pray without understanding, as Papists and ignorant
persons, who do not mind what they pray (and how should God mind their
prayers, if they do not mind them themselves?) Isa. 29. 13.
or come in hypocrisy, their hearts being in the mean time far from God; John
9. 31.
or come in their sins, and so God abhors them, for he hears no sinners; or
never come but in their misery, and that neither out of love to God, Hos. 7. 14.
or hatred of sin, but fear of punishment, or delay the time so long, See Prove.
1. 24.
that its too late ere they come, as Esau, and the five foolish Virgins: These
be Rebels, they live at staves end with God, stand out, and will not come in to
the pardon; How should God hear them? nay, their prayers (if they make any) are
abomination: Whatsoever befalls the wicked (as evil enough may befall them every
day) yet they have no help; What shall they do in their misery? They may
murmr and rage against God, bear out for a while by head and shoulders, as it
were, or lie like blocks and languish, or run to Endor to the Devil for help,
but God they have none to go to, nor prayer that will be accepted, whatsoever
become of them.

Contrarily the righteous cannot be miserable, Gods wrath and the fruits
thereof are always bent against the wicked.
as long as he can pray; put him down into a Dungeon, and chain him by the neck
to the ground, yet as long as he can pray, he is happy, and shall have comfort,
and that deliverance which shall be best for him: He has Gods promise for the
same, and that will not fail him.

But the face of the Lord is against them that do evil.] The point is this,
That Gods wrath and the fruits thereof are continually bent against the wicked
that live in their sins, Levit. 20. 3. and 26. 14. Numb. 11. 1. and 22. 22.
Deuteronomy. 28. 5. and 32. 21. Josh. 7. 13. Isa. 42. 24, 25. and 57. 17. Jer. 5 9.
Ezekiel. 14. 8. Zech. 7. 13. Luke 14. 21. John 3. 36. Col. 3. 16. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 6.
To these Testimonies diverse examples might be added, as of the Angels cast out
of Heaven, the old world drowned, Sodom and Gomorah burned, Corah, Dathan and
Abiram swallowed up quick, the houses of Jeroboam, Baasha, Ahab rooted out,
etc. so of Gods judgments upon the bloody Emperors, Nero, Domitian, Julian,
etc. so of Gods judgments upon the persecutors of his children, largely laid
down in the Book of the Martyrs; so of Gods judgments daily inflicted on
several sorts of sinners, which are as it were real sermons, and justifications
of Gods Word and our preaching, 1 Cor. 10. 6.
and are for our admonition, and of especial use to us: This must needs be so,
for sin is against his nature, Reasons.
against his commandment, yea, it were against his nature, See Psalm. 9. 8, 16.
to let the wicked go unpunished, and he is as much known and glorified in his
justice, as in his mercy: He that teaches and commands Magistrates to reward
well-doers, and not to bear the Sword in vain, Romans 13. 3.
but to draw it out against the wicked, will not suffer his own Sword to rust
in the Scabbard.

Obj. Many notable wicked men go on in their sins, and be not plagued.

A. True, Why the wiced are not always plagued here.
God keeps but his petty-Sessions as it were, here in this world, bringing now
and then some few unto judgment, and reserves multitudes to that dreadful day,
wherein it shall be rendered to them according to their works. Again, if he
plague them not outwardly, yet are they plagued with a worse judgment; He
gives them up to the blindeness of their minds and hardness of their hearts,
and will of the Devil, which is the most fearful thing that can be, and at the
day of Judgment he will avenge them all at once, when he shall come in flaming
fire to this purpose, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 8, 9.
who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the
Lord, and from the glory of his power.

1. This may terrify and awaken all those, which (as if there were no God, Use
1.
or no God which did regard or were able to revenge himself on them) make a
trade of sinning; whilst they are thus, the wrath of God is upon them, and he
sets his face against them, and how can they then prosper? he has throughout
all ages found out and plagued others for their wickedness, and do they think
to escape? The mightiest and proudest has fallen before his wrathful
vengeance, and are they privileged? It were their wisdom to send forth
messengers of peace, and to humble themselves in time, least he tear them in
pieces, when there is none to deliver them; they should fear and be wise by
other folks harms: But O the monstrousnes of the times, and hardness of men's
hearts! that seeing their companions plagued before their eyes, yet run on in
the same excess of riot. And for those that are as Lions and Foxes, subtle,
and shifting by unlawful courses, though happily they may think to get up and wax
mighty, yet assuredly, God will set his face against them, as he daily does
against Oppressors, Couseners, Shifters, Covetous and Troublesome persons: Then
shall the Lambs be quiet, when those Lions are killed; the godly be refreshed,
when they shall be rid of their cruel oppressors.

2. This may persuade us to avoid the ways of the ungodly; Use 2.
though they seem pleasing for a while, yet are they most dangerous: Be advised
in time, especially you young ones, that are now to choose your way: walk not in
the way of the wicked, for believe it, you may else peradventure repent thereof
(as others) when it will be too late.

Verse 13. And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which
is good?
TO requite evil with goodness, is a weighty and difficult point, many reasons
have been already laid down about it: Here Is also another reason to enforce the
same, It will be the way to save us from may harms in our life, which he takes
from experience, and sets out by way of interogation, that none almost, not one
of a thousand will be so vile, or so without all grace, and good nature, as to
hurt us, if we follow ever that which is good, that is, if we live profitable
toward our brethren in all the duties of love, with relation to their bodies,
souls, goods, goods name, places, callings, and the like, and when any wrong is
offered us, not only we do not revenge it, but on the contrary, overcome it
with well-doing, none almost will be so wretchedly minded as to harm us.

Note then, That

Patience and innoceny of life, Patience and innocence of life, are the way to
escape harms from men.
are the way to escape harms and wrongs from men; This must needs procure quiet
to those that are endewed herewith, Who can harm such a one? As grievous words
stir up anger, so a soft answer turns away wrath: Thus Gideon pacified the
Ephraimites, Prove. 15. 1.
and thus did David overcome Saul: Contrarily, Judge. 8. 1, 2, 3.
such as requite word with word, wrong with wrong, suit with suit, 1 Samuel 24.
18. and 26. 21.
etc. they do but stir the coals, and blow the fire of dissension, and may look
to be harmed of every one; experience shows that if any shall harm the
innocent, there is none almost but cries against it (as Jonathan blamed his
Father, 1 Samuel 19. 4, 5. and 14. 45.
for setting himself against David; and the people the same Saul, when he would
have put Jonathan to death, 1 Samuel 24. 18. and 26. 21.
for tasting the honey, yea, he himself was convinced of his own Conscience for
wronging David) but that the covetous, contentious, hasty, and hurtful, and
that in wrongs are impatient and given to revenge, are continually talked of,
ill spoken of, and railed on; yea, meet with adversaries, that do and will
oppose them, so that most of the ordinary wrongs that come to us from our
Neighbors, have their beginning from our selves, who do not that good in our
places which we might, or are impatient when we are wronged: None is hurt but
of himself, whatsoever others do to us, we are not hurt thereby, so we be
innocent and sin not; yet does not this justify them that do harm us, but
teaches us by what means especially we may avoid being harmed.

1. This rebukes our folly, Use 1.
that would fain live without harm, and yet cannot be wise enough to use the
means to bring it to pass, but take the contrary course: either we do not
perform our duties to our neighbors as we should, and so catch harm and are
evil spoken of, which is the case of some, or we be impatient in wrongs, apt
and given to revenge, which is the case of some others; we must therefore labor
to do our duties in our places, and live profitably, endeavoring withal for
such humility, meekness, and patience from the Lord, as we may be able to
overcome evil with goodness; Hereupon must ensue much good.

2. When any have harmed us, Use 2.
and the same proves grievous unto us, let us examine our selves, whether we
may not justly lay the blame on our selves: If we have been in fault, then are
we to be patient, to humble our selves, and to acknowledge Gods hand on us, to
teach us more innocence, and more patience, and not to stand out so bitterly
against them that have done us wrong; thus shall we find comfort in
afflictions, which else (bringing the same upon our selves) we cannot expect.

Verse 14. But and if ye suffer for righteousness sake, happy are ye, and be
not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled.
NOw the Apostle makes an exception, that howsoever for the most part the
course prescribed will save us harmless, yet some there are that be so wicked,
as they will wrong a man, though he be never so innocent and godly, nay, will
wrong him the more for his goodness, and for that alone: They will injury men
for righteousness sake, that is, wrongfully and without cause, or for Religion
and godliness sake; yet be not you (that meet with such wrongs when you be
innocent, nay for your goodness) dismayed or faint concerning this, for this
shall not turn to your hurt, but to your great good, for you are blessed if you
suffer any thing whatsoever in this kind.

But and if ye suffer for righteousness sake,] Here Note, That there are

1. Some which are so bad, Some are so bad that they wrong the innocent.
as that they wrong the innocent, even them by whom they have been at no times
wronged, from whom they have received no harm: Thus was Abel hated and killed
of Cain, Moses misused by the Israelites, Prove. 22. 22. and 23. 10.
David railed upon by Shimei, and persecuted of Saul: This is against all
equity, and that which the Lord must needs revenge, for its his honor to defend
the innocent; yea, if he will not bear doing wrong to them that have wronged
us, much less will he endure that the innocent should be wronged.

O take heed of wronging such, Use.
whether in words, by slandering them, backbiting them, or bearing false
witness against them; or in deed, by oppressing them, griping, grinding their
faces, and the like.

2. Others which are worse, Some hate the godly merely for their goodness.
even such as hate Gods servants for well-doing and their godliness: Thus
Ishmael persecuted Isaac, for that he was the son of the promise: Gal. 4. 29.
Thus Ahab hated Micaiab, as both he and Jezabel Elijah: Numb. 23. 8.
Thus was Jeremiah hated, so John the Baptist, the Apostles, Christ himself:
How many thousands of such were persecuted unto the very death, under the
bloody Emperors of Rome? and since has not Antichrist been drunk with the
blood of Gods Saints; See Rev. 17. 6.
yea, amongst our selves there be, that hate men for their forwardness and
zeal; Some Ministers think their people too forward, some people their
Ministers, O they could love them well, were it not for their preciseness:
Psalm. 16. 3.
These be not led by David's spirit, nor can have any mark that they are
translated from death unto life, 1 John 3. 14.
or that they are true members of the Church: Psalm. 15. 4.
They are of the brood of Cain, of Ishmaels generation, worse then Balaam, yea
of Satan's company, who is the accuser of the Brethren.

O be not of this number, Use.
add not unto the measure of your sins, by hating those whom God loves, and
esteems as the apple of his eye! O what fearful judgments have been inflicted
on such, especially having thus done against their own knowledge! Neither only
will the Lord be revenged on bloody and hateful persecuters, but he will not
suffer the least of their disgraceful and hard usages to go unpunished, but as
a cup of cold water given to a Christian, in the name of a Christian, and
because he is so, shall not go unrewarded; so shall not their small indignities
go unpunished: Matthew. 18. 6.
If whosoever shall offend one of these little ones, it were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of
the sea; then how fearful is their condition that misuse them, abuse them,
backbite them, persecute them, etc? If men do not like and approve of such, yet
may they let them alone: Cannot they be content to follow the world,
Alehouses, Whore-houses, etc. but that they must hate and trouble them that do
not? you like your course, so do they theirs; you should rather love them that
will take pains to do good and be good, whereas your selves will not.

Happy are ye,] Such as suffer wrongfully, or for Religion and Conscience sake,
are happy.

1. Such as suffer wrongfully or without a cause; Such as suffer wrongfully, or
for Religion and Conscience sake, are happy.
for 1. To suffer justly, is an hundred times worse, sin giving more cause of
grief then the cross. 2. In such case we have our conscience on our side, and
that is a feast. 3. We may go to God and make our moan to him. 4. God will make
a good end, he will make our innocence break forth as the light, and our
righteousness as the noonday, which will be the more taken knowledge of, then
if it had never been oppugned. 5. God will take the matter into his hand, and
requite to them according to their works, ridding us out of their hands.

Its then our duty not to be dismayed, Use.
if we meet with hurt without cause, for the innocent to be harmed, its no new
thing; lets be thankful for the same, say not impatiently, What a vile thing is
this, that one should be so misused? as if we were too good to be served; or,
If it were true, and I had deserved it, I would never have cared; for then
should thou have had much more cause of shame and grief, as having deserved
the same: O let us keep our innocence still, so shall we either have no harm,
or at least, not such as whereat we need be much troubled.

2. Such as suffer for Religion, good conscience sake, for the whole truth of
God, or any part of it, the profession or practice thereof, the omission of
evil prohibited, or performance of duties enjoined, etc. Such, Matthew. 5. 10.
I say, as thus suffer, are happy: So says our Savior, so the Apostle Peter. 1
Pet. 4. 14.


For 1. This is an argument we are not of the world, Reasons.
but are chosen out of the world. John 15. 19.
2. That we love the truth, as who can be content even to suffer for it: Many
will profess it in fair weather, but how few stick thereto in adversity? 3. Its
to be made like unto Christ our head. Phil. 3. 10.
4. All the Prophets and Apostles have walked in this way to Heaven; Acts 5. 41.
we are shrewdly hurt to be companions with them. Phil. 1. 29.
5. Thus to suffer is no small honor. Matthew. 5. 10.
6. Their reward is great in Heaven: Herein flesh and blood can see no
happiness, Luke 12. 32.
such as live at ease, or in wealth and pleasure are with them happy indeed,
James 1. 12.
but Moses had respect hereunto, Heb. 11. 26.
and did clearly discern the same.

Q. May we then offer our selves to trouble?

A. Ordinarily we must not; We must tarry till God call us to suffer:
If any in extraordinary times should feel an extraordinary zeal, and desire
hereto, as it seems the Apostle Paul had, Acts 21. 13.
when he would needs go to Jerusalem, questionless they should have joy in
their sufferings; we must tarry till God call us.

Q. May we flee persecution?

A. If God make make us a way, Whether we may flee from persecution.
we may, as who happily are not as yet so fully fitted and resolved to suffer, as
were meet, or who know not whether God will have us scatter his truth further,
or remain to be as feeds thereof for afterward, but if we see that its Gods
mind we should be s^ffer, then its our duty willingly and cheerfully to put
forth our selves.

This confuteth the foolish world, Use.
that judging it to be a most miserable thing thus to suffer, will therefore
never come at it, either not professing Religion at all, or else revolting
therefrom in time of trouble; yet would they be happy, but they take a contrary
course, they being ashamed of Christ here, he will be ashamed of them
hereafter: In saving a transitory life, Mark 8. 38.
they lose life everlasting; yea, how do we our selves shun sufferings, as if
they were miserable which do suffer? whereas the Spirit of God has pronounced
them blessed: Happy are they that suffer for a good cause, for righteousness,
for Religion, for conscience sake; such as stick fastest to the truth, provide
best and most wisely for themselves, what can their enemies do to us? If they
take away our goods, Mark 10. 30.
we shall have a thousand fold more in this world, and in the world to come
life everlasting; If they mangle our bodies, God will raise up the same
gloriously; If they separate our souls from our bodies by death, the Angels
will carry them into Abraham's bosom; Matthew. 5. 10.
If our cause be good, we have cause to rejoice in our sufferings; Acts 5. 41.
and 16.
so are we enjoined, so did the Apostles in their sufferings, Heb. 10. 34.
so also the holy Martyrs. I might to this purpose allege the story of Alice
Driver, of Priests wife in Exeter, of the Christians in Edessa, etc. but that
they may be read at large in the Book of the Martyrs: O that we should be so
discouraged at a mock, at a frown of our betters! O that we should be as soon
ready to give over, as to begin to do well! though the more religious we are,
the more we esteem of the word, the better both God, his angels, and people
like us; yet is it not so with the world, they liked us better before, but do
not now approve of our course: howsoever, this is our duty, hereof shall we have
the benefit; yea, to be disliked, to suffer for this, will be our honor, our
advancement: 2. Sam. 6. 22.
As David being mocked of Michol, resolved to be yet more humble, so should we
be so much the more for goodness, as we see the world oppose it, and set
themselves against us because of the same: We must not be discouraged at the
very greatest, much less at small trials: Heb. 12. 4.
We know not what we shall suffer, For yet we have not resisted unto blood;
only let us be careful that we suffer for Righteousness, and for a good cause;
for though we have some good things in us, yet happily we may be brought to
suffer for some fault in us, and therein we can have small peace: Beware we
suffer not as Separatists, that fly out against and from the Church; that we
suffer not for contempt or usual neglect of our Ministers, if they preach the
Word truly; that we suffer not for rash, heady, hasty and violent carriage of
our selves; that we suffer not for our censuring, for our meddling with things
or persons wherewith we have nothing to do; or for passing our bounds in things
beyond our reach. Servants must beware that they suffer not for their
carelessness in their places, as those which having liberty granted them to hear
the Word, upon their not profiting thereby, are restrained therefrom; so if
they shall suffer for being negligent, untrusty, sloathful, stout in answering
again, etc. they suffer deservedly, not for righteousness sake; yea, this their
carriage makes the godly householders to grieve, and those that be not so well
seasoned, to think ill of the profession, and it makes the name of God and his
Gospel ill spoken of; and hereupon many say, Oh, I Will never meddle with these
Bible-wenches, etc. fie upon it, what a fearful thing is this? The like may be
said of the poor which neglect their callings, and are caraless of their
Families, etc. Note further, That

A godly man is blessed, A godly man is happy in what condition soever.
happy in what condition soever: He is happy not only in prosperity, but even
in sufferings, even in the very lowest abasement, nothing can make them
miserable; having God and a good conscience, See Psalm. 1. 1. and 32. 1. and 112
1. and 126. 1.
though they meet with affliction from God, or persecution from men (as here)
yet are they happy: Imprison him, fetter him, let no creature come at him, put
Lions to him, etc. yet he is still, and shall be the child of God, the member
of Christ, the heir of Heaven, a Kings son, etc. and how can he be miserable
that has the Comforter within? For the wicked, nothing can make them happy;
let a wicked man have Sampsons strength, Absoloms beauty, Ahasuerus his wealth,
Nebuchadnezzars stately Babel, Dives his costly apparel, etc. yet is he
miserable, he is under the curse of God, there is but a step between him and
Hell: Jonah 1. 6.
As Jonah was asleep whilst God was offended with him, the winds raged against
him, the Whale was ready to swallow him, so do the wicked eat, sleep and are
jovial, while God is offended, Heaven is shut up against them, Hell gapes for
them, and the Devil waits on them as his prey: Their security will end in a
fearful wakening, they shall be snatched from their beds of ease, and cast into
everlasting torments.

1. This may encourage Gods servants to suffer for righteousness: Use 1.
They shall not be the less happy; let the world do its worst, it cannot make
them miserable: They are every way happy, in poverty, sickness, persecution,
and the like; O who would not labor to attain this honor and happiness?

2. It may dissuade the wicked from their mischievous plotting against Gods
servants; Use 2.
For why do they pursue them? To make them miserable, its impossible: They may
indeed make them the more to shine forth through their constancy in Faith, and
increase their glory in Heaven, and so make them more happy, but to make them
miserable they cannot: O that they would break off this their course, and be
weary thereof! for so long as they be wicked, how rich soever, or how high a
pitch soever of honor they have clambered to, they are miserable; yea, these
and the like make them more miserable, as being fuel to their lust, being to
them occasions of sinning; cease therefore to be wicked, else shall thou never
cease to be miserable.

Be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled.] To comfort them in their
sufferings for Christ, he removes the enemy of constant and patient suffering,
namely, Fear: Be not (says he) afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;
Fear is an enemy to constant suffering.
that is, Either be not afraid with the fear of ungodly men, and such as have
no hope in God, who in the very least danger are altogether dismayed (as the
words in Isa. 8. 12. (whence these seem to be taken) do imply, or, Fear not the
things wherewith they seek to afright you, the Apostle using the words but to
his own sense, Fear not their faces, big looks) threats prisons, censures and
tortures) neither be dismayed at them; fear is an enemy to constant suffering
(as a coward can be no true Soldier) and therefore are we often diswaded
therefrom: Matthew. 10. 28.
This hindered Nicodemus from coming unto Christ by day, Luke 12. 4.
and multitudes from confessing him, Rev. 2. 10.
even for fear of the Scribes and Pharisees; made Peter deny his Master: and
because of this, in all alterations of Religion, most turn with the time: And
would not many be more forward in goodness then they are, if it were not for
fear of displeasing.

O strive against this fear, Use.
and be courageous; so were Daniel, the three Children, the Apostles, Moses,
the holy Martyrs, etc. Their Faith overcame their fear; we need not fear men,
or what they can do to us, for God will stand by us, we must fear him, fear to
sin against him; for unbelievers and fearful, they shall have a fearful
portion: such as fear man more then God, Rev. 21. 8.
fly from the stroke of a child, and fall into the hand of a Giant, from a
straw to a sword.

Verse 15. But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to
give an answer to every man that asks you a reason of the hope that is in
you, with meekness and fear.
Here Is the true means of constant and patient suffering, even faith resting it
self confidently on God.

But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts,] What it is to sanctify the Lord
God.
We sanctify God, or his name (as its in the first petition of the Lords
prayer) not when we add any holiness thereto, which is holy beyond comparison,
but when we acknowledge and give that holiness which belongs to it:
Particularly, herein we sanctify the Lord in our hearts, John 3. 33.
when we believing his faithfulness in his promises, Romans 4. 20.
do thereupon rest on him in time of our troubles, and this is to glorify him.

Faith is the mother of constancy in suffering; Faith, the mother of constancy
in sufferings.
I know thy faith and thy patience: Be thou faithful unto the death, etc. By
faith, those worthies mentioned in Heb. 11. did undergo all their sufferings:
This is the victory that overcomes the world: Rev. 2. 2.
The want of faith makes the world fly from God and his cause; 1 John 5. 4.
weakness of faith causes fear to overflow us, as in Peter and Cranmer, as
soon as we see some trouble to arise, Luke 8. 24.
then are we ready to say with Peter, O Master, we perish! If we do believe our
selves to be the Lords, and that our cause is just and good, and that he has
all power in his hand, and that none can stir further then he pleases, and
that he will strengthen his servants to endure, and after this transitory life,
translate us unto life everlasting: O this will encourage us indeed.

Labor we therefore for a good stock of Faith now in this time of peace, Use.
and let us in our daily trials, reproaches, and afflictions, exercise the
same, and make good use of it: If in these we can give glory to God by
depending on him, we may trust our Faith will not fail us, when greater trials
shall befall us: to believe God of his Word, is to give glory to God; as on the
contrary, to faint, tends to his dishonor, and as to believe on him is great
ease to our selves, so not to believe but faint, very troublesome.

And be ready always to give an answer, etc.] He proceeds to another duty, as a
fruit of the former trust in God, exhorting us in token of our Faith in God,
that we be ready with courage to acknowledge and make confession of our Faith,
to those that shall demand a reason thereof: This we must be ready at all times
to do, and so often as we shall be called thereto, and to all men that have
authority to call us, and to any that shall demand it with a desire to learn,
or whenever and wheresoever we shall see it meet and requisite so to do (as
the Spirit of God will direct his servants where, when and to whom) yet so as
we do it with courage, meekness, and godly reverence.

Our duty then is, As we must believe Gods Truth with our hearts, so must we
profess it with our tongues.
not only to believe the truth of God in our hearts, but we must be ready
outwardly to make profession thereof, and confess the same with our tongues,
when God shall call us thereunto: Abraham, Isaac and Jacob walked as Pilgrims
here on earth, professing themselves Gods servants; and Joshua professed, That
he and his would serve the true God: Romans 10. 9.
Accordingly must we, both by our speeches and actions declare whose servants
we are, so walking, as that men may see we are not ashamed of God, or his Word
and way, whatsoever others do, most do, yea rich and wise men do, the great
ones of the world do, yet do we thus walk, daring do no otherwise, and not
caring who know our carriage and behavior; and though they scoff at it as
scruplous, too strict, and precise, and call us fools for our labor, and ask
us, Why we do not thus and thus as we see most men do, yet need not we be
dismayed, as being warranted by the Word of God: So in all Companies we must
make known what we are; If we hear any rail at goodness, speak ill of good
duties, oppose any part of Gods truth, reproach the professors of Religion,
whether unknown or known unto us, we must take the cause in hand, standing for
the defense of Gods truth and servants: If by our timely answer any good may
come to the Gospel, we must not through our silence betray the same; but if we
be among scorners and dogs, we must show our dislike by departing from them:
Thus must we do being in company with profane ones, so if we be among Papists
or other adversaries to the Truth, we must have the zeal of God in us; so if it
be in the times of persecution, that we be called forth by Magistrates, or
their authority, we ought not to flinch, nor be ashamed or afraid, but show
what our Religion is, what our Faith and Hope, giving a Reason thereof out of
Gods Word; or if they demand us about any point of Religion, we must in the
defense of Gods cause speak our consciences freely: Thus if the Jews or Turks
should call us to know, through whom we did hope and look to be saved, we must
acknowledge Christ Jesus, and our Faith and Hope of Salvation in him, as of
whom the Prophets foretold, and who did every way for time, place, manner, etc.
fulfill their prophecies of him: This we must believe with our hearts, and
confess with our mouths, in this Faith we must both live and dye: The like
might be instanced about Justification, if by Papists we should be called to an
account. Thus Moses came often before Pharaoh to justify his demand; thus
Elias did acknowledge and maintain the true God, and his pure worship, against
Ahab and his false Prophets; so Daniel and the three Children, so the Apostles,
so the Apostle Paul, Rev. 2. 13.
so the Church of Pergamos, so the holy Martyrs, they could not be drawn from
the truth, either by promises, threats or torments; so in this Land in the days
of Queen Mary, Gods servants showed good skill in the Word, and made known
their Christian courage.

Reasons hereof may be these: Reasons.
1. That it may appear God has some Acts 26. 18.
and may also (if possible) win others to the truth, as Paul had almost done
Agrippa: No doubt many standers by were won by Paul's defenses, and the Martyrs,
and not a few weak ones confirmed, the rest being left without excuse.

1. This condemns that horrible wicked practice of the Church of Rome, Use 1.
in keeping the people in miserable blindeness, and holding it a deadly fin for
them to read any part of Scripture, in a tongue they understand, or any book
touching the true Faith and Religion, nay, read both Scriptures and Prayers to
them in an unknown tongue, and lock up all knowledge from them, and means
thereof, like the Scribes and Pharisees, that took away the Key of Knowledge:
How shall they then be ready to give an account of their Faith? They must
believe as the Church believes, and that is all they can get, only they preach
to them in their own language, which yet is but lies and errors for truth: This
is most gross robbery of the people, Christ bid Search the Scriptures, John 5.
39.
they charge the contrary, and curse them that do: Its cruel tyranny and
murder of their souls; they take away their weapons that they may make a prey
of their souls, 1 Samuel 13. 19.
as the Philistines did from the Israelites, to keep them under: Those are not
of Moses his mind, that wished, Numb. 11. 29.
That all Gods people might prophecy; Col. 3. 16.
nor of St. Paul's, That the Word of Christ might dwell in them richly in all
wisdom, etc. None have need to be discouraged from seeking knowledge, for most
be too careless and lazy.

2. This rebukes the gross ignorance of most part of people, Use 2.
that notwithstanding this light that we have, and so many helps of preaching,
liberty of reading, and so many Books of all kinds, and of the grounds of our
Religion, yet know not what they hold, nor what be the points of their
Religion; but as Market news, they hear they must serve God, and come to
Church, and must be saved by Jesus Christ, but to prove that he is the true
Christ, or that they must be saved by him, and by no other, in whole nor in
part, or that the Scripture is the Word of God, they are altogether ignorant,
and so might be carried away to any Religion: This is an horrible sin,
especially considering the helps and liberty which we enjoy; What notorious
carelessness is this? must we not buy the truth, prize the truth, know it, hold
it fast, not part therewith? Most have such skill in worldly businesses, that
they are altogether unskilful in the Word, regard not the means of their
Salvation: John 3. 19.
This is condemnation, Hos. 4. 6.
that light is come into the world, and men love darkness more then the light:
O how many perish for want of knowledge? yet are there some which having
knowledge, but not the love of the truth nor Faith in God, will flinch from it
if ever they be tried, for there is no hold of him that loves not the truth,
though he have never so much knowledge, as we may read of Dr. Pendleton and
others in Queen Mary's time: Such, if they be in company of Papists, of
Cavillers or Railers, they can stand or sit still and say nothing; How would
these confess the truth with peril of their lives, Matthew. 12. 30.
when they be affriad of a great man, etc? Let such know, Mark 8. 38.
that Christ esteems them as his enemies, For he that is not with him, is
against him; they being ashamed of him in this world, he will be no less
ashamed of them on the last and great day.

3. O then let all of us labor for knowledge, Use 3.
and to be grounded in our Religion, and to know the points of Catechism, and
be able to prove them by some place of Scripture, so as we may be bold to
believe them, and stand to the defense of them: To this end, we must give ear
to Catechizing, read the grounds of Religion, and study the Scriptures in
humility and with Prayer, having a care to know the will of God, and to be
guided by it, and to stand in the defense of it to Gods glory, against such as
oppose it: This is the glory of a man, of a Christian, to make confession of
his Faith in Christ, and stand to the defense of it; this God may justly expect
of us, it has been performed by them which had not the hundredth part of the
means which we have: O let us both love and live in the Truth, sticking close
thereto, whatsoever it cost us! And if at any time we shall hear it spoken
against, we must have the zeal of God in us to stand in the defense thereof:
Luke 12. 8.
Thus confessing Christ here among men, he will confess us before his Father in
Heaven and his holy Angels.

Of the hope that is in you,] We must believe with our hearts before we can
confess with our mouths.
Faith and hope must be rooted in our hearts ere we utter the same with our
tongues; In vain do we talk of things whereof we have not the inward feeling.

With meekness and fear,] Here Is the manner (for good things must be done in a
right manner) we must temper our courage and zeal, Our speeches must be
accompanied with meekness and fear.
in setting out the truth with meekness and fear; we must avoid pride and
insolency by forgetting our places, or those we have to speak to, or breaking
out into violent speeches, mockings, gibings, or such like, for so we may do
much hurt, and this is unbeseeming the Spirit of Gods Servants. Besides, the
things we speak of, being the matters of God, our speech and behavior must be
suitable thereunto.

This rebukes the preposterous zeal of some, Use.
which defending the truth and a good cause, forget duty and respect to their
Superiors, and break out into violent and unseemly speeches, and be at defiance
by and by, and straight condemn all that are not as they should be, whereas
they should by a wise, meek, and moderate defense, and kind persuasions win
credit to the truth which they defend, and so do good; they on the contrary
cause them to speak evil, and to think that its but a preposterous hate and
pride of heart in them so to speak, and so do hurt: Some sober Christians do
much good, and win on many that at first were opposite, when they hear the wait
of their reasons, rather then the bigness of their words, and seeing they do it
in the fear of God, and for conscience sake: Some are not so mild as others,
but of an hotter nature; this must in any wise be tempered with wisdom, yet are
not we to part from any part of the truth, but to stick as close thereto as we
may.

Verse 16. Having a good conscience, that whereas they speak evil of you, as of
evil doers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in
Christ.
TO our constancy in the confession of our faith, we must have a good
conscience, not so only as it may be known to our selves, but we must so walk,
that others, even our adversaries may perceive the same, that thereupon
changing their minds, and being ashamed that they have spoken so evil of us,
they may cease to blame such as walk in so good a conversation, as becomes the
Servants of Christ: Before I come to handle the points particularly laid down
herein, I will show, 1. What conscience is. 2. The offices thereof. 3. Resolve
some questions about it: and 4. Treat of the kinds thereof.

For the 1. Conscience is a faculty or power, What Conscience is.
placed by God in the soul of a man, which determines of his thoughts,
desires, words and deeds, either with him or against him in the sight of God: I
say, Its a faculty or power, not a bare act, for many actions are ascribed
thereto, as to accuse, excuse, comfort, terrify, etc. Placed by God; for God
being the creator of the soul, he must accordingly be the creator of all the
faculties of it: In the soul, called also the heart, and the Spirit of a man:
Herein there be diverse faculties, as the understanding (whereby we conceive
what is true and what is false, what is good and what is evil) the will
(whereby we will or nill, choose or refuse any thing, whereto are joined the
affections, joy, grief, love, hope, fear, etc.) and the memory, whereby we hold
fast things conceived, or else call to mind, and remember things past: So also
is conscience another faculty thereof, whereby the soul reflects upon it self,
whereby I know that I do know such a thing, that I think this or that, that I
affect or desire, love or hate this or that; for its one thing to know a thing,
think a thing, remember a thing, etc. and another to know that I know it, think
it, remember it: Now in which part of the soul it has its place, as whether in
the understanding or will, or in every part of the soul, I will not stand; its
enough for us to know that there is such a faculty in man's soul. True it is, it
not only gives witness of all the faculties, and tells what I think, desire,
affect, etc. but it uses and works upon all the faculties as the
understanding; for by it, it directs, and according to it, it does accuse, so
as if the judgment be well informed, the conscience will give right witness,
if ignorant or ill informed, then it gives wrong testimony: So the memory,
accusing or excusing for things past; so it works upon the will, by provoking
it to choose or refuse this or that; so it works upon the affections, raising
up in us comfort and joy upon well doing, fear and grief upon ill-doing: Now
though it have to do with all, yet it may have its proper place in the
understanding and mind, according to the judgment of most Divines: Of a man,
for no Creature on earth has Conscience, but man. True, the Angels are not
without it, the good having a good, comfortable, excusing, joyful Conscience;
the evil, a woeful, ill, accusing, and tormenting Conscience, which is so much
the worse, for that they know so much, and be so maliciously bent against it,
so that even when they be not in the place of torment, but have leave to range
the world, yet they carry Hell with them, even a tormenting Conscience, whereof
their trembling (according to Saint James) is an evident testimony: James 2. 19.
But no other Creature has it, for having no Reason, they have no Conscience;
therefore we say in our speech of a bad and unconscionable man, he has no more
Conscience then a Dog, or as much Conscience as an Horse, whereby we mean none
at all, for these Creatures have none: Man then has a Conscience, yea every
man, yet as the use of Reason may be lost, by folly, frenzy, etc. so the use
of Conscience in such: So by notorious wickedness, a man may lose the use of
his Conscience for a time, whereupon we say of such a one, he has no
Conscience: yes, every man has a Conscience, though as the use of Reason is
taken from one deeply drunk; so custom of sinning has taken away use of
Conscience, so that it does not admonish him before he do ill, nor check and
accuse him after, or has such an erroneous judgment, thinking good evil, and
evil good, that he has also an erroneous Conscience: But this benumbed or
beguiled Conscience will be awakened at one time or other, in life or death, or
at the day of Judgment; Rom 2. 15.
for no man's Conscience dies, but lives, and shall meet him at the last day:
and though his sins be now as words written with the juice of Lemmons, nothing
to be seen, yet when their Conscience comes to the fire of Gods Judgments,
then every little dash, idle words, vain thoughts, etc. will be perceived:
Though men choke and smother Conscience, though they strangle it, or so drown
it in their cups, yet it will and does abide still; what made Joseph's Brethren
troubled in Egypt, but Conscience, which told them of the sin committed by them
twenty years before? So Conscience told Pharaoh that he and his people were
wicked, which determined of his thoughts, desires, words, and deeds, or more
briefly, bears witness either with us or against us in the sight of God: It
meddles not with other folks actions, for that is science or knowledge, but
with our own, and that is Conscience: Conscience, that is knowledge with
another, that is, either another knowledge, when I knowing any thing, do know
that I know it, and so know my self and what is in me, or another person that
knows with me what I know, and that as well as I, or rather far better, namely,
God, who made the Conscience, and will judge it, and is privy to all that is in
it; for so is no other, neither man nor Angel, Acts 24. 16.
and accordingly the Apostles Paul and John join both together: Great is the
force hereof: 1 John 3. 20.
as both being within us, and so more able either to comfort or terrify us
then any other thing (as the wind that gets within the earth, shakes it most
terribly) and likewise so inseparable, that a man cannot get from it.

1. This shows plainly that there is a God, Use 1.
who has set Conscience on work thus to admonish, warn, comfort, accuse,
terrify, etc. Having done evil, why should a man's Conscience accuse or
terrify him, but that God has ordained it should so do? and accordingly it
does cite him before God, and judge him before hand; for not man or Angel can
take the accusation of Conscience, it bears record in the sight of God: Why
have the most unbridled despisers of God, when any token of Gods wrath has
appeared, run into holes and cellars under the ground; yea, and such wicked
monsters after some foul offense, though so secretly done as that they needed
not to have been afraid of men, yet been so much vexed and disquieted, but that
their Consciences informed them of God against whom they did sin? and that his
wisdom and knowledge did far surpass that of men or Angels, as knowing not
only what is done and spoken in the world, but what is in every man's heart.

2. This confuteth those which affirm, Use 2.
That we cannot be assured of our Salvation, and why? because we cannot know
whether we believe or not, etc. But as we may know a Tree by the fruits, so may
we our Faith: James 2.
God gives us not grace, that we should not know whether we have it or not: 1
John 2. 3.
wherefore serves Conscience but to witness what is in us? 1 Cor. 2. 12.
Thus what Conscience is.

For the second, The Offices of Conscience.
The Offices of Conscience, they are to bear witness, and to give judgment.

First, To bear witness.
I say, To bear witness, and that 1. Of our thoughts, whether they have been
proud, distrustful, unclean, wandering at the hearing of the Word, or in
Prayer, worldly on the Lords day, etc. for the understanding has two
faculties, one whereby it conceives or thinks this or that; the other, whereby
it doubles upon it self, and knows that it did think it: The mind thinks a
thought, the Conscience goes beyond the mind, and knows what the mind thinks;
so that if a man would hide his thoughts from God, his Conscience can bear
witness of them: Ier. 17. 10.
Thus it discovers the very bent and sway of our hearts. 1 Cor. 2. 11.
2. Of our will and affections, whether the same be set on good, or that which
is evil. Romans 9. 3.
3. Of our speeches, whether they be agreeable to Gods Word or not. 4. Of our
actions, though never so secret: Thus David's Conscience told him that he had
sinned in numbering the people, 1 Samuel 24. 10. and 24. 15.
but that he had not conspired against Saul, Psalm. 7. 4, 5.
howsoever he was by him persecuted; Job 42. 3. and 31. 5, 7, etc.
so Jobs Conscience witnessed against him, that he had spoken somewhat
impatiently, but for him, that he had not eat his morsels alone, etc.

1. This sets out the great mercy of God to man, Use 1.
God has not here left us alone, but besides his Word and Ministers, every man
has a keeper still going along with him (who is to pry into our actions, and
to bear witness of them all, and when we have done amiss, to tell us secretly
thereof, that so we may ask pardon and amend, and may not complain that we had
none to tell us of our faults, etc.) and that is our conscience: Hereby such as
belong unto God are stirred up to have recourse unto God for mercy, and
thereupon are pardoned; after their conversion, they are also hereby kept from
many evils, and through the checks of Conscience we are driven to repentance:
Happy are they that have tender Consciences, and turn not the deaf ear thereto:
Does our conscience tell us of any thing amiss? if we do thereupon amend, we
make good use thereof; but if we do not, whereas it now speaks softly between
it and us in our ear, it will roar out one day, when it will be heard, whether
we will or not, namely, Both at the hour of our death, and on the day of
Judgment. Most men count their conscience a common Barretor, one that troubles
them (as Ahab said Elias did Israel) therefore is it just with God to give them
benumbed consciences, that they go snorting to Hell.

2. It sets out the Equity and Justice of God, Use 2.
that condemns no man till he has given him both a law to guide him, and a
conscience to admonish him, Psalm. 51. 4.
yea, to accuse and condemn him: When God judges, every man's conscience shall
justify God for so doing; when God shall awake the conscience, then it will
speak true, give a righteous verdict, and condemn the civilest for want of
Faith in Christ, and not performance of the duties of the first Table.

3. It teaches us to beware we sin not, Use 3.
whether in thought, word or deed, either out of hope that none shall know it,
or that we shall escape for lack of witnesses, or that we may allege that we
knew not that so and so to do were sins: Thus we should but deceive our selves,
for there be witnesses enough, thine own conscience is as a thousand, and God
as ten thousand: Lets do no other thing but that whereof we would hear again,
for conscience will bear witness; do not we bless our selves for our sins done
in secret, as if none saw them, or could witness any thing against us: The bird
in the breast knows, and God knows; hang down thine head then, and ask mercy of
God, and confess thy self to him; if not, even thine own conscience may break
it out in this world, as Judas's in accusing himself, whereas he was not taxed
by others, and many have confessed Murder, Adultery, Theft, etc. some with
repentance, others in hellish horror: Do not any thing in hope of secrecy,
unless you can keep God and your consciences from being present, neither be we
careful for eyewitnesses of our well doing in the performance of duties: Its
enough if our conscience tells us we have done well; yea, if we be taxed for
Hypocrites, See Acts 23. 1.
or otherwise be slandered, its sufficient that God and our own conscience can
bear witness of our sincerity and uprightness; 2 Cor. 1. 12.
its more then if every one should speak well of us, Heb. 13. 18.
excepting our own conscience: Thus was Job, thus Hezekiah comforted. Isa. 38.
3.


2. To give judgment, and that whether things be good or bad, To give
judgment before our actions.
whether they be well done or ill done, and this judgment is given either
before our actions, or after them; before, Conscience gives judgment thus, it
tells us what is good, and what bad, and not so barely, but with some
furtherance, This is good, therefore do it; This is ill, therefore do it not;
so Pilate knowing Christ to be innocent, his conscience moved him to seek to
loose him; so Reuben when his brethren would have killed Joseph, apprehending
that to be ill, and that from his conscience, he dissuaded them therefrom; so
David's conscience told him that he should do ill to kill Saul, and thereupon
would not give ear to those that persuaded him hereto: Thus being tempted to
Lie, See Isa. 30. 21.
Deceive, Swear, Profane the Lords day, etc. the conscience tells us that its
evil so to do; Psalm. 16. 7.
Again, being called upon to any good duty, the conscience tells us its good,
and provokes us to do it.

Why, Obj.
then Conscience is a Puritan if it do thus, is not this corrupted as well as
the other faculties?

O yes, Sol.
therefore it gives judgment very weakly and imperfectly in all, but
especially in the unregenerate, and especially in the most ignorant and most
wicked, yet it retains some part of her office and power, and will be doing as
its enlightened, and therefore it will give this judgment in foul and gross
things in the worst of all, as when they go to commit Murder, Adultery, etc.
or tell them on the other side, they should go to Church, etc. but in the
regenerate it does much good work, its as a guide to conduct us in our way, and
whereby we shun all by paths; Its a bridle to keep us from sin, and a spur to
goodness, its joined in Commission with the Spirit of God, they are obeyed or
rejected together.

1. Our duty then in token of our thankfulness is, Use 1.
That we listen to the voice of Conscience, and be ruled by it; we must take
advice thereof ere we do any thing: If we will not be ruled thereby, but do
contrary thereto, it will one day exclaim against us, when God shall judge us
for our disobedience; Why, did not I give thee a Conscience to tell thee of
these things, will God say? Yes, Lord, shall Conscience answer, I told him it
was naught, and yet he would do it; I told him such and such a thing was his
duty, and urged him to it, and yet he would not give ear, but put off the time
from one day to another; he would not repent, have prayers in his family, etc.
such shall then be stricken speechless: Most are so eagerly carried after their
passions and unruly affections, as that they do not hear the voice of their
conscience, the noise of those drowns the voice of this.

2. Even natural men have a light of conscience urging them to good, Use 2.
and restraining them from evil: None so evil, but they have in them some
light, by which conscience is set on work to advise or counsel to the doing or
avoiding this or that good or evil; its therefore no note or sign of grace in
any, because their conscience does thus and thus: This is in mere natural men,
from the light and knowledge that conscience has of things good or evil, yea,
oftentimes so forcible are those stirrings of conscience in them, as that it
keeps and restrains them from many sins which they are inclined to, and would
otherwise commit, and puts them upon many good things which it urges them to,
which of themselves they have neither will nor power to do; not from the love
they have of the good, or hatred of the evil, but beca^se they would please
Conscience, which will not suffer them to be at quiet till it be obeyed; this
they may do, and yet in the mean time may be only in the state of Nature; for
though here they obey Conscience, yet they do it not for Conscience sake: Their
obedience arises not from the purity and holiness of the Law of God, but from
fear of men, from discredit or shame, from hope of reward, desire of ease or
the like: If there were no other cause to move them to enter upon good duties,
or to restrain them from doing evil, but the Law of God, they would not yield
that obedience to Conscience, which now they do: And thus conscience gives
judgment before things be done.

For its judgment after our Actions: After our actions.
It then gives sentence, This was well done, This was ill done, and not so
only, but with an Absolution or Condemnation: This was well done, therefore
you are innocent in it, and deserve neither guilt nor punishment; This was ill
done, therefore you are guilty, and have deserved Gods wrath hereby: 1 Samuel 12.
3.
Samuels Conscience spoke for him, Exodus 9. 27.
Whose Ox have I taken, etc. Pharaohs against him, Prove. 28. 1.
I have sinned, etc. Thus is Conscience as a Judge acquitting or condemning us,
2 Cor. 1. 12,
yea, 1 John 3. 21.
a little God as it were in the midst of man, giving sentence beforehand, as it
shall be at the Tribunal seat of God on the last day: If it acquits us, then it
works Peace, Joy, Comfort, Boldness; if it condemn us, especially forcibly, O
then it causes shame (as in Adam, when he fled and hid himself in the thicket
after he had offended) so also fear, yea, in the midst of all jollities, as in
Belshazzar, and at small things, as the shaking of a leaf; so also sorrow
(which the world judges to be melancholy, whereas it is far otherwise, and yet
both may and do often meet together) yea, desperation as in ( Cain and Judas)
and an universal distraction of body and mind: Isa. 57. 20.
the accusation of conscience are wounds to the heart; Acts 2. 37.
David's heart smote him: Prove. 18. 4.
A wounded Spirit who can bear? Mark 9. 48.
They are as the gnawing of a Worm that never dies, but lies continually
gnawing at ones heart.

1. If our consciences do excuse and acquit us, Use 1.
bearing witness of the truth and integrity of our hearts, of our hatred of
evil, our delight in Gods word, and endeavor to please him above all things,
etc. then may we rejoice and be of good comfort, the same being an infallible
mark of our Salvation, and may be bold in believing the same against Satan and
all his discomforts: There Is a great fault in many Christians, though (as the
Apostle says) They know nothing by themselves, 1 Cor. 4. 4.
but that their hearts bear witness with them, of their care and faithfulness
in all things, yet are never the more comforted, but are still cast down
through Satan's suggestions and lies, and their own unbelief: If thine own
conscience well informed according to Gods Word acquit thee, why should thou
not be of good comfort? you may be humbled for your failings, yea, deeply for
your strong corruptions, and yet for the main, be of comfort; if in any
particular we have done well, we may be comforted.

2. Let us always keep our selves in well-doing, Use 2.
that we may hear our consciences speak comfortably, so may we keep a continual
feast.

3. If we have any thing lying on our consciences, Use 3.
for which they boil within us, and accuse and pronounce judgments against us,
let us not make a slight matter of it; but seek to God for mercy, and to be
discharged of it, that so we may still conscience, which then may be done, not
before: Stop not the mouth of conscience, as many do by mirth and toys, this is
but to delude thy self and delay time; others let it alone, and think to wear
it out in time: O no, conscience will still cry louder! Simile.
What if one should make the Bailiff drunk, and so get away, the debt is never
the more paid, he will come again; though the evil Spirit in Saul went away by
the Minstrels playing, yet it returned to him again; the like may be said of
conscience: I wonder at the horrible madness of some people, though their
consciences do already accuse them and condemn them for many things, yet are so
far from seeking to disburthen them, that they daily add more and more
thereto: How justly may these fear, lest the terror of conscience come so
fiercely on them, as even to weary them out of their lives? But howsoever they
sleep now, there will be a time when they will awaken and cry to the purpose.

4. Let us take heed that from henceforth we do not burden our consciences,
Use 4.
they will be Witnesses, Accusers, Judges, Tormentors, If this be against us,
what shall be for us? and if this condemn us, who who shall clear us? Simile.
If we have eaten too much, or some unwholsom thing, and it lie on our stomach,
we cannot be at rest, till we be emptied thereof, and accordingly thenceforth
are more careful to abstain from the like; so should we do in respect of sin,
yea, in our places, as Magistrates, Ministers, Husbands, Parents, Masters, etc.
we must discharge our duties, and for the same have the testimony of our
conscience, and enjoy the peace thereof; then which, what is more to be desired?
and which not gain, pleasures, honor, etc. can procure: Because thy conscience
does not now accuse thee, thou do happily conceive that all is well, but assuredly
hereafter it will, though it may be twenty years hence, and that when thou shall
be least able to undergo it, as in sickness, etc.

5. This clears Gods justice, Use 5.
he will nor needs not bring other witnesses or occasions against us, then our
consciences; they will testify with us, or against us on that day. Before I
leave this Point, consider we, that the Word of God is that which tells us what
is to be done, and what left undone, and that this binds the conscience to
obedience; when any thing is done agreeable to the Word, the conscience says,
its well, and excuses; when any thing is done contrary to the Word, the
conscience says, its ill, and condemns: As for them that have not the Word,
their consciences judge by the light and Law of nature, which was left man
after the fall (for there remain some general notions in man's heart both of the
first and second Table, as appears by the Laws which the Heathens have made
about the worship of their Gods, and against perjury, murder, theft, adultery,
etc.) Romans 2. 15.
These I say, are judged by this: Its true, that men's Laws, an Oath, a Vow, do
bind the conscience, but its by virtue from the Word; now if the mind be
enlightened with the true knowledge of the Word of God, then will the
conscience give right judgment, but if it be ignorant of the Word, then it may
make the conscience erroneous, or scruplous and doubtful.

An erroneous conscience, An erroneous conscience, what it is.
is when it accuses where it should excuse, or excuse when it should accuse,
which comes from an erroneous judgment, which judges good to be evil, and
evil to be good; hence the conscience of some men excuse them in doing things
that be flatly bad, See John 16. 2.
and accuse them for doing good things: Thus a Papist thinks he does well to go
to Mass, Genesis 30. 18.
and that he should do very wickedly to come to Church with us.

A doubtful conscience is, A doubtful conscience what it is.
when a man is not persuaded of the lawfulness of a thing, or the unlawfulness
of it, but is as a man that holds a Wolf by the ^ars, he knows not whether he
should let him go, or hold him still, Romans 14.
whosoever thus does any thing, sins; both this and the former proceed from the
want of the knowledge of Gods Word.

We must therefore labor to be well instructed in the Scriptures; Use.
ignorant persons must needs fill their lives with swarms of offenses and sins,
for they not knowing many things to be sins which be, swallow them, and never
accuse themselves for them; as we say, the blind cats many a fly, and do many
things which they have no faith of the lawfulness of, but do them for custom,
example of others, and the like, and so sin in them; people think if they be
free from murder, whoredom, theft, etc. they be in a good case, but being
ignorant, Psalm. 119. 105.
their lives abound with sins: O therefore let the Word be a light unto our
feet, and a lanthorn unto our paths: Thus of the offices of conscience.

For the third, Three questions here offering themselves, require resolution.

Q. 1. Whether does a man sin, Whether a man does sin that does according to
his conscience.
that does according to his conscience: As a Papist thinks he serves God highly
well in going to Mass; one in the Primitive Church, thought Fornication a thing
indifferent, and so committed it; A man thinks he may lawfully travel homeward
on the Lord's Day, being in a journey.

A. He does ill that does any of these, or the like; for his erring conscience
cannot make that good, which God has before pronounced to be evil, by
forbidding it in his Word; our conscience is not our rule, but Gods Word: Thus
every one should be saved by his own devotion, and it were lawful to go to a
cunning man, to sell as dear as we can, to deceive them that deceive us, to use
the Creed and Ten Commandments as a Prayer, See Acts 26. 9.
etc. which who can justify? Whether a man do any thing against his conscience
being erroneous,


Q. 2. Whether it be lawful for a man to do a thing against his conscience, I
mean, though his conscience be erroneous and deceived: As if a Papist be
persuaded that its a sin to come to Church with us, and yet for fear comes; an
Anabaptist holds it unlawful to take an oath before a Magistrate, and yet
through fear he does?

A. They do ill, not simply for doing these things, as being good, and such as
God requires, but for doing them with an ill conscience against their
conscience; so that if they do not these things being required, they sin; if
they do them, they sin, what then? They must labor to be informed, and
persuaded of the lawfulness of them, and then do them: So that though (as in
the former question) our persuasion of the lawfulness of a thing being indeed
unlawful, makes it not good; so the doing of a good thing against ones
conscience, makes it unlawful: If a man think himself bound in conscience to
pray three times in a day, he ought so to do, though God has left it
indifferent: An erroneous conscience must be followed till it be better
informed, Romans 14.
but how vile is it to commit an evil against the checks and light of
conscience, 1 Cor. 8. 7.
and yet what is more frequent?

Q. 3. Whether is it lawful to do a thing with a doubtful conscience. Whether
it be lawful to do a thing with a doubtful conscience.


A. By no means, a particular faith must be had for all our actions; we must
forbear a thing till we be persuaded, and such ought to be born with that seek
resolution: A scruplous Conscience is, when a man is inclined to think a thing
lawful, and yet has some scruples and doubts, by reason of many difficulties
that he has heard of, which he knows not how to answer or resolve: Here our
rule is to labor to suppress all difficulties that make us doubt; but if it
cannot be done, then its lawful to follow conscience notwithstanding those
doubts and scruples, as Deuteronomy. 13. when the people were settled in a true way of
serving God, if one should come and teach them a contrary way, confirming the
same by a sign, this must needs breed some scruples in the peoples minds;
nevertheless, conscience enclining to the truth of the former Doctrine, they
are bound to stand to it: Thus of these three Questions.

For the fourth, The several kinds of conscience.
There are good and bad consciences; Man's conscience was only good in the
Creation, since the fall all men's consciences are corrupted and perverted,
whereof some are renewed and sanctified from Heaven, and so become good, though
not perfectly, because of the remnants of corruption: Tit. 1. 15.
Whosoever is not sanctified, has an ill conscience of one kind or other.

An evil conscience is either a still and quiet evil conscience or stirring,
either by accusing, or excusing wrongfully; for the true property of a good
conscience, is to excuse altogether for well-doing: Now when the conscience is
either number and dead, and lies still, or otherwise accuses for sin, or excuses
wrongfully, this is an ill conscience.

Of a still quiet ill conscience there be three kinds, The kinds of a still
quiet conscience.
namely, sleepy, secure, and seared.

The first, Drowsy.
a sleepy drowsy conscience, that lives and lies in many sins, and yet
accuses not by reason of ignorance in the Word of God, as the common sort
neglect many a duty, and commit many a sin, that conscience never checks them
for, because they be ignorant of Gods Law, for which another that knows the Law
of God is humbled, with them are omnia been; they hope to be saved by their
good meaning, and crying God mercy at last; they are not troubled at wandering
thoughts, worldly talk on the Lords day, to go to bed without prayer, Simile.
and the like: They are like one that comes into a sluttish house in a dark
night, and sees nothing amiss, but when the Sun shines perceives the foul
corners, yea, the very moats that fly in the Sunbeams: Some such have come
under a lightsom Ministry, and have wondered and been ashamed of themselves,
and have been humbled and converted; Thus was it with Paul before and after his
conversion.

The second, Secure.
A secure conscience, that is stirred only at foul and staring sins, hates
murder and fighting, but in rash and unadvised anger is not moved at all; is
somewhat troubled at swearing by wounds and blood, but makes nothing of By my
faith, truth, this bread, fire, Sun that shines, and the like; such have wide
throats, that can swallow all small things: So there are that make conscience
of oppression, cruelty, in justice, but none of neglecting the Word,
Sacraments, and Prayer, or profaning the Lord's Day, which be greater then the
former, though they do not so think; and partly the commonness of them makes
their conscience not accuse in them, or that they be never awakened for their
sins, till some great cross do befall them, or after some rowsing Sermon, then
their consciences work; therefore they cannot abide such Preaching, though it
were happy for them, if they might hear such still, till they were wearied out
of themselves.

The third, Seared.
A benumbd, brawny and seared conscience; benumbd, as a member in the dead
Palsy; brawny, as a laboring man's hand; seared, as with an hot iron, which is
worst of all: when men go on and make conscience of nothing, but do what they
list, and their hearts scarce smite them, being (as Nabal) like blocks and
stones, daring do any thing, and committing most horrible foul sins, and yet
not being troubled thereat: This comes by the custom of sin, and refusing the
checks of their conscience, and Gods giving them up to a reprobate mind, and
an hard heart, to work wickedness, and that with greediness: Ephesians. 4. 18.
great sins also lain in without repentance, do harden and benumb the
conscience, as a part of the body that is seared is past feeling: They not
only doing against the light of Gods Word, but even against the light of
nature, and their natural conscience, God gives them over, and so they go on in
sin, without sense of any thing.

The cause of these, especially the two first, is chiefly the want of a
faithful Ministry, for where this is, though they be not converted, yet they
be convinced, and sin not so quietly as others; or if they live under such a
faithful stirring Ministry, and yet have drowsy and secure consciences, its
because they come not to the Word, or regard not what they hear, or understand
it not, or sleep thereat: But there are some more notorious, which will not
lightly abide a zealous or powerful Ministry, but will get away from it, else
if they tarry, through long contempt of the Word, and hardening their hearts,
they grow past feeling, having set down with themselves, they will never be
moved with whatsoever is said: This is a great plague, it takes from a man the
only means under God of his repentance; he is as one under a grave stone, that
cannot rise: These are lusty and merry, they think their case happy, they say,
Peace, peace, they thank God they were never troubled in conscience, and marvel
at them that be, thinking them out of their wits, or else that they have been
some great offenders, etc. but they are troubled, not because they be out of
their wits, but because they now begin to come into their right mind, as its
said of the Prodigal, Luke 15. 17.
They be troubled not because they be greater sinners then the others, but
because they see that the others see not, which if they saw (as it were happy
for them if they did) they would see cause enough to be wounded to the purpose:
But do they think their conscience will ever lie thus still? No, let them be
assured God will set all in order before them, and their benumbed conscience
will prove a raging conscience. A Bankrupt makes a great show at first,
afterward breaks, and is arrested and imprisoned; many make fair promises unto
Delinquents, that they will speak to the Judge for them, etc. Simile.
but do indeed prove their chief adversaries, such are the consciences of these
men: If it be once awakened and stirred, it will roar as a Lion, and tear out
their throats; a sleepy conscience is like a starcht Ruff, that stands up brave
in fair weather, but falls quite down in a storm: The peace of such a
conscience is naught, it comes not after humiliation, nor proceeds from
apprehension of Gods love, but from a false imagination, having no true
reformation of life accompanying it.

Now that the consciences of such may be awakened here, See Ioh. 3. 20, 21.
whilst there is help (though usually most shun the same) they must 1. Labor
to be acquainted with Gods Law, Means whereby the conscience may be awakened.
wherein they shall as well see the smallest as the greatest sins: Therein they
shall perceive their own See Deu. 29. 19
and are not a whit moved by all the threatenings of Gods Word) that thereupon
they may be humbled and terrified, and fly out of themselves to God for mercy,
which is the only way to come to good: To this end let them make use of the
most stirring sermons, meditate of Gods judgments, go to such as are
afflicted, or lie on their death beds, consider that there be thousands in Hell
which have not committed the tithe of their sins, and that if they themselves
should dye suddenly (this night) their condition were miserable: If any shall
say, My conscience has been quiet all this while, I do not mean to call my
estate into question; let such know, that many go snorting to Hell, and that a
troubled conscience is better then a drowsy secure conscience, for that may
come to good, the other is out of all possibility of mercy: See Acts 2. 37 and
16. 29.
Indeed, to stay in terror of conscience is fearful, yet not worse then to have
a benumbed conscience; there is hope of them that be troubled, Simile.
of the others but a little. Physicians prescribe their Patients sometimes to
go to sea to be sea sick, and that to purge away some ill humors, for the
health of the body; no less needful is it to be soul sick for the welfare of
our souls; yet is it a common speech of most, at the visitation of the sick,
Oh, I pray do not trouble him, he is in a very good mind, etc. but the
Prodigals condition (though he had ragged clothes and a rent heart) was better
then his elder brothers; and the Publican justified, not the Pharisee: Thus of
the quiet ill conscience.

The stirring ill conscience, The stirring ill conscience.
is either when it stirs by excusing, or by accusing.

Excusing, Excusing.
upon the doing of some evil, whereof John 16. 2. or the omission of some duty,
as the hearing of the Word, Prayer, and the li^e: Thus was it with Saul when he
was questioned by Samuel, for not obeying Gods Commandment; thus has it been
with some Papists, when they have practiced Treason against their Prince and
Country. A good conscience does excuse indeed, but rightly, not amiss, in all
things, not in some only, for the manner as well as the thing it self.

Accusing, Accusing.
and that 1. When it should not, as an Idolator is troubled in conscience for
leaving undone some piece of idolatrous service.

Who so find their consciences accusing them for their sins, Use.
and know no pardon, but their consciences still tell them of their sins, and
that their course is bad, let such know, that they have evil consciences, which
being let alone, will accuse them worse: If their consciences accuse them, God
is greater, and knows more: Therefore let them seek to pacify God and their
consciences too. To this end, consider, That God has provided in his infinite
mercy an all-sufficient remedy in the death and bloodshed of Jesus Christ, 1
John 3. 20.
then which there is no other way to satisfy Gods displeasure, nor to stanch
the terrors of conscience; let such bewail and lament their state to Almighty
God, confessing their sins, and judging themselves as the Prodigal for the
same, See Psalm. 32. 5.
thereupon craving of him with strong cries and humble prayers, Prove. 28. 13.
the pardon and forgiveness thereof: To such as thus come in the truth of their
hearts, Isa. 1. 18.
God has made many gracious promises; Ezekiel. 33. 16.
Thus suing to him, Mat. 11. 29.
he will in his own good time send down a comfortable answer: This is the only
course to come to good (to still conscience with forgetting our sins, and
mirth, is but to deceive our selves, to wear it out by head and shoulders; its
but as the putting away of the tooth-ake with cold water, which will still it
for a little, but after it reboundeth more violently) this is the way to get
peace: After this will our consciences begin to be quiet, and thereupon excuse
and comfort: Then will Faith purify the heart, and work an hatred of all sin,
with a continual care to please God in all things: Then shall we be quite
altered and changed from that we were. I cannot but wonder at a number of men,
whose consciences witness against them, who yet seek not to pacify them by
assurance of pardon, but add more daily unto their sins; whose consciences
bear witness, That they have no care to please God, but their way and works be
naught, assuredly their consciences will one day cry louder; O lay up no new
matter of accusation, all the profit and pleasure that comes of it will be dear
bought: Simile.
Its as to drink pleasing poison, it goes down pleasantly, but afterward wounds
the bowels: If a man had never so much wealth, yet if he have an ill
conscience, what shall it profit him? It were as if a man had a costly banquet,
rich apparel and attendance, etc. and one with a sword drawn were standing
ready by him to kill him: This is a Bailiff to arrest, a Jailer to keep safe, a
witness to accuse, a Judge to condemn, an Executioner to torment, etc. Its of
all foes the worst, they accuse to men, this to God; one may go from them
sometimes, but not from this: Its an evil help in adversity, which like Jobs
friends troubles us more then all the rest; It will be a woeful companion at the
hour of death, and day of Judgment: Its like a woeful contentious wife, when a
man has had trouble enough abroad, coming home, he finds more there: O their
life is no life, that live with a worm gnawing within! Thus, what joy will
there be of health, wealth, or whatsoever else? yea, as we are to take heed of
this, so also are we of a benumbd conscience, the end of both being bad, the
one no less dangerous then the other; Thus of a bad conscience.

A good conscience, is an excusing and comforting conscience, that speaks on
ones side, and that for well doing: Thus have the Angels in Heaven a perfect
excusing conscience; So had Adam in his innocence, and we shall one day have in
heaven: Now our conscience is but so in part, as all our other faculties; Some
corruption remains therein, even in the best, and therefore does sometimes
accuse, or excuse when it should not, but for the most part it excuses and
witnesses comfortably on our sides; this is either a good quiet, or a good
troubled and trembling conscience.

A good quiet conscience has these two parts, A good quiet conscience.
an heart witnessing to us, 1. The pardon of our sins past in the blood of
Jesus Christ Jonah's casting into the Sea, Heb. 9. 14.

26. 2. and Isaiah 38. 3. Acts 23. 1. 2 Cor. 1. 12. Heb. 13. 18. They that
believe most assuredly the pardon of their sins, and walk most steadfastly with
God, they have the good quiet conscience, at least so far as is here to be
attained: This is a wonderful Jewel, 2 Cor. 1. 12.
a continual feast; Ioh. 30. 20, 21.
This causes joy; This causes boldness to come to the Word, 1 John. 3. 21.
boldness before God, boldness also toward men (let men say what they will,
Acts 23. 1.
we care not, if our consciences witness truly on our sides) yea, boldness
against the Devil, who will lay much to our charge, sifting us to the full: O
thou art a damned Creature, will he say: No, Satan; yes, an horrible sinner,
and who have deserved Hell fire: I grant (Satan) but Christ Jesus has paid my
debt, and delivered me; If thou shall escape Hell, yet thou shall never get to
Heaven (will he say) for none come there but such as keep the Law: O Christ
has kept it for me! But he has dyed but for a few, whereof thou art none;
yes, I am: He dyed for none, but such as truly believed in him, so do not
thou: Yes, I do believe, and do lay hold on his gracious promises: But Christ
dies for none, to whom he gives not power to become new Creatures, so art not
thou: Hereunto will a good conscience answer boldly, and so put Satan to flight.

This differs from a bad quiet conscience, Wherein it differs from a bad quiet
conscience.
that comes from ignorance of their danger (as a blind man standing before a
Canon) this out of knowledge of Gods Word; This is quiet upon examination, that
because never examined; This is quiet upon good grounds, that upon nothing but
upon bear conceits; This has joy adjoined therewith, which that has not: That
leaves one in deadness, this quickens the heart to every good duty; This holds
at all times, that driven away by the terror of the Ministry of the Word, or
by afflictions, especially it fails at death and Judgment day.

A good troubled and trembling conscience is, A good troubled conscience.
when one is persuaded of Gods love, and the pardon of sin through Christ, but
cannot hold it firm and fast; and this not in the beginning of their conversion
only, but after they hold it with a wavering hand, so doubtful and full of
fears, because of their unworthiness, and the greatness of the mercy, so that
ever anon they are to seek, and ready to faint: And for the other, their heart
witnesses the true hatred of all sin, and care to please God in all things,
but herein they think they do nothing as they should, and that they can do no
good, and even when they have done duties very carefully, yet are they still
troubled, as if they did all for fear of pain, and Hell, and not for the love
of God, or out of self-love in hope of Heaven, and to save their souls: And
because they find some corruptions and rebellions, they think that these spoil
all their duties, and that they themselves are vile wretches, yea, though they
hate them deadly, yet this does not satisfy them, they hate them not so much
as they should. Again, they are so timorous and fearful, whether they may eat
this or that, or thus much, wear such good apparel, do this or that, go this
way or that, all which notwithstanding are lawful for them, but they are so
afraid to offend God, that they often accuse themselves, etc. This is a good
conscience, though not so settled as were to be desired, and as the other is:
This may appear by these Notes;

Such would not part with the comfort they have for the world, Signs declaring
the goodness thereof.
nor be utterly out of hope, and are glad when they can believe best: They
resolve to trust in God, and serve him, though he would kill them; They are
humble, and both much and servent in Prayer; They hang upon the Ministry of
the Word, hunger after the Sacrament, long for the Sabbath, delight in the
Saints: There Is no Physician more welcome to a sick body, then a godly Minister
to them in time of trouble; They walk usually more strictly, then they that
have more comfort, and are more zealous, and more afraid to sin, and more
grieve at sin in others; So that this is a good conscience no less then the
former, Both go to Heaven, the one in sharpness, the other in sweetness run the
way of Gods Commandments; Simile.
They be like to two Travelers through a Wilderness, or in a dark night, one
of good courage, afraid of nothing, the other of a fearful nature, afraid of
every thing, both which get well through: So do these, the one has experience
of Gods goodness in not being troubled and tempted, the other of his power in
being upheld, that he is not swallowed up and overcome of fear and grief: O
that there were many such consciences! And yet it cannot be denied, but that
the other is better, as having more comfort in themselves, and being more fit
to do good unto others, and yet they may escape some checks the others may meet
with, as Peter; yea, God seems more to tender these then those; as a Father
having two Children, both beloved of him, the one sick, the other in health, is
most careful of him that is sick, that he may recover: To have a tender
conscience, checking us for the least sin (idle words, vain thoughts, and the
like) as David's, for curting off the lap of Saul's Garment, 1 Samuel 24. 5.
is a singular blessing, and therefore to obtain it, we must both see the
odiousness of sin, judging aright thereof, and must bring our hearts to mourn
even for the smallest sins.

1. Let every man examine himself whether he has a good conscience or not, Use
1.
whether art thou assured of the pardon of thy sins? whether does thine heart
bear witness that thou hate all sin, and art truly desirous to please God in
all things, as well great as small, secretly as openly? at least in the deep
sense of thy misery, art thou wearied under it as an intolerable weight?
hearing of the only remedy, do thou long after it above all the world? art
thou as willing to turn from sin, as to have sin forgiven; to take up his yoke,
as to be refreshed by him? If not, thy case is fearful; What have we, if we
have not this? The great benefits of a good conscience.
Its our duty then to labor for it, and not rest till we obtain it; What may
not incite us hereto? It procures Joy, Peace, Comfort, Boldness before God and
men; such are bold to pray unto God, bold to crave others to pray for them: See
Pro. 14. 10
Its comfortable in prosperity, Heb. 13. 18.
a sweet companion at home and abroad, night and day; its a sweet companion in
adversity, like a good wife by her kindeness chearing her husband when he comes
home, who has been much turmoild abroad, another Simon to bear a piece of our
cross, yea in the greatest crosses, this assures us, that yet God is our
Father: he visits us in love, he will assist us, and at last deliver us: Its a
Castle of comfort, an armor of proof, a continual feast, an Heaven upon earth:
It makes a man embrace the flames, kiss the stake, and being in the fire,
accounts as if he were on a bed of Roses: In death its comfortable when all
things else forsake us; then when our eyes are shut up, yet through this we
shall with Steven, Acts 7. 56.
see Christ Jesus ready to receive us, and shall say, Lord, now let thou
thy servant depart in peace: In the day of judgment it will make us lift up
our heads with joy, when we shall see our Savior Christ come to receive us into
his heavenly kingdom: O they that have a good conscience should make much of
it, as of their jewel, and labor to keep it: It may be easily lost, and is
hardly recovered, as may be seen in David and Peter.

The first part of it, How it is kept
namely, The assurance of our Salvation is kept by daily renewing our
Confessions, Supplications and Thanksgivings: To this end we must labor to know
the will of God, and daily to grow in knowledge, by our diligent perusal of the
Scriptures.

The 2 part of it, namely, our care to please God is kept and maintained by a
daily and constant resolution not to offend God, and so we must both strive and
watch against our frowardness, worldly-mindedness, etc. and covenant and vow to
do the will of God to the uttermost of our power: Hereupon we must walk
carefully, as in the presence of God, avoiding all occasions of sinning, and
using all good means to keep us in a good course publicly and privately,
being diligent and careful in our particular calling, to the glory of God, and
good of our brethren.

2. This reproves those that having a good conscience, fail as much in
laboring to keep it, Use 2.
as the World does in not laboring to obtain it: How do Christians go on
carelessly, without renewing their exercises of Faith and Repentance, and so
their assurance is to seek, or else hold it at a venture, and coldly? our worst
day in the week might be better then our Sabbath, had we but the grace to use
our time aright: O how many are careless, watch not, give way to their lusts?
therefore fall into many evils, and so wound their consciences very often,
which is dangerous. A place often wounded or hurt, will not at last be healed:
We dishonor God much, disquiet our consciences, give evil example to others by
our frowardness, impatience, worldliness, hard dealings, etc. Hence it comes,
that the Word pincheth us, evil tidings amaze us, we are loath to dye, and the
day of Judgment is fearful to us.

3. This may encourage and comfort those that have good consciences, Use 3.
though they be timorous: What, God shows mercy, even to men unworthy, and
though thy sins be many and great, ye^ have thou to deal with him that is able
to pardon them: Lose not that thou have; when we lose good consciences, all
Gods graces diminish and vanish away, neither can we thrive any whit, as is
seen by daily experience: But nothing can do us hurt as long as our consciences
hold good; then are we fit to live, and fit to dye; fit for the Word and
Sacrament, fit for death and judgment: Thus of the kinds of conscience, and
so of conscience in general.

Having a good conscience, A godly conversation is to accompany the zealous
profession of our Faith.
etc.] Now of the Words in particular, whereof I have laid down their coherence
with the former, and from whence may be noted, That a godly conversation in all
things, is to be joined to a bold and zealous profession of our Faith; to our
knowledge and profession, See Josh. 1. 8.
gifts, utterance, and the like, we must add a good life; Mat. 5. 16.
these two be two Twins (St. Paul often joins them together) neither must they
be parted, John 13. 17.
saying and doing, Iam. 1. 22.
the tongue and hand must accompany one another.

Reasons hereof may be these: Reasons.
1. God expects of us, that where Luke 12. 47.
Where God finds this, Isa 41. 8.
he delights in it, as in Abraham, who is called, The friend of God; in David,
1 Samuel 13. 14.
whom he calls, A man according to his own heart; so in Joh, in Zachary and
Elizabeth, Isa. 1. and 58.
etc. we find the same commended: The contrary God loathes, Ezekiel. 14. and 33
as in his own people, whom he did again and Acts 15. 9
but its only Faith that purifieth the heart) and that our knowledge is not
swimming in our brain, James 2. 18.
but sound and saving knowledge, purging both heart and life, when we dare
compact with any other, and say, Show me thy Faith by thy works, as I can. 3.
This not only Gods children look for, when we have got knowledge, and come
forward in profession more then before, then we should live answerably, that
they may boldly converse with us, but the common sort of the world also, they
expect it, for though they will take liberty themselves, yet they look that we
Ministers and Professors of Religion, should lead a strict life in all things:
If we do otherwise, we shall hear of it; and surely we are beholding to them
for this (though they do it of no good mind) and may make good use thereof to
look to our selves, as questionless Abraham did, when in the matter of variance
which arose between him and Lot, Genesis 13. 7.
For that the Canaanite and Perizzite were then in the Land. 4. Its an honor to
our profession, when with Job, we dare bid our adversary write a book against
us; Job 31. 35.
and the contrary is a disgrace, 2 Samuel 12. 14.
not to our selves only, but to our profession, yea, our Religion it self in
the account of the wicked, whereat they blaspheme, yet ought not they to judge
ill of all for the fault of some, but especially of Religion it self, though
the professors thereof were naught: No man blames the Trade for the fault of
the Tradesman, nor all for the fault of some, yet here they do it, when they
see men make a show of Religion, but denying the power thereof: If professors
differ not in their lives from others, it makes the world think that there is
nothing in profession, and yet they may perceive some few walk without
exception.

1. This rebukes some, Use 1.
that having good knowledge, and are very ready to speak, yea, and to censure
and blame that that is not good, and are very forward in profession, yet halt
foully in their lives; as the Brownists, that are very hot, and so holy, as
they not only censure others, but condemn the Church it self, not only as
impure, but as no Church, and yet themselves, besides that, they are Proud,
Scornful and Obstinate (not to speak of their living out of any Church, and
their spending their Sabbath) they foully sin against the second Table; they
borrow what they can, not caring to pay again, are breakers of their Word and
Promise, think to live of other men's labors, and yet that herein they should be
born with, as being extraordinary persons, they would say, in being idle and
negligent in their callings; yea, there are some of them which will swear,
steal, and break the Sabath: A woeful Generation.

2. It reproves such among our selves, Use 2.
which place all Religion in hearing Sermons, and talking, as some servants do,
which yet perform not the duties of their calling, are idle, untrusty, lazy,
stubborn, disobedient, as if all should be born with because of their hearing
sermons, whereas on that very ground more is to be looked for at their hands:
And this is grown to such a pass, that many of the common sort of people say,
of all they will not meddle with these Biblewenches (of which before) Is not
this a good report you have brought upon the Word? yea, many godly Christians
are weary of such (not but that I know there be godly servants of both Sexes,
that have learned to show the fruit of their hearing by all good carriage in
their particular calling, and are as jewels to them they be with, but these be
rare) Do these things agree? as well as Harp and Harrow: Does God take pleasure
in this, that you should hear his Word, and yet not mind to be guided thereby?
How can you approve that there is any more in you then in Hypocrites and
Reprobates? can you show your Faith by your works? Dare you bid your adversary
write a Book against you? Do you not set men off from Religion, and make them
speak ill? You all that usually resort hither to the Word, I bescech, to show
the fruits of it when you come home; your neighbors look for it, your lives be
pryed into, it may do you good; we see your faces only, and think well, that
you will hear, but your neighbors they see your lives, and God sees your
hearts; and if your faces were like Angels, and your hearts corrupt, and lives
unreformed, you shall have your portion with Devils. And here I think it
requisite to speak of an abuse amongst us, that they which bring in here
(because of the concourse of people) their commodities to sell, raise the
prizes, and sell dearer then in any of the Market Towns round about us, whereby
they wrong the poor here, and raise the prizes elsewhere (for if a price be up,
its a president straight) yea, and also raise an evil name on the Gospel: I do
not mean yet that Christians going to Market are bound to sell at lower rates,
then the ordinary, though I take them so bound at home in dear times to their
own poor Neighbors, yet is it not the part of a Christian to be the raiser of
prizes, especially in dear times; Its indeed a note of a wicked worldling.

3. This rebukes even good Christians that walk not so wisely toward them
that be without as they ought, Use 3.
nor yet so strictly in their lives, but are too forward, hasty, strict in
their dealing, slack in paying their work-folks, are careless of their words,
etc. O let all such professing themselves the Servants of God, show forth the
same by all good conversation in their particular Callings: Thou must not be a
zealous woman, and yet an unquiet wife; a zealous man, and yet a cruel husband;
a zealous young man or maid, and yet an unfaithful Servant; a zealous man, and
yet a false dealer in your Shops and Trades.

Good] This is fitly added, A godly man will stand by the truth.
and well required, for one of wicked life will never stand to the truth, but
fall from it, for Heresy is the punishment usually of foul sins, but a godly
man will stand most to the truth.

They that speak evil of you, as of evil doers] Here note, That

The wicked are very apt and much bent to speak ill of Gods Servants: The
wicked are apt to speak ill of Gods servants.
Thus Elias was said to trouble Israel, Elisha termed a mad fellow, and called
bald-head; Micaiah said, that he never prophesied good; and Jeremiah, that he
raved; so Steven was said to have blasphemed, as Paul to be a pestilent fellow;
nay, the perfection of innocence, Christ himself was most foully spoken of,
termed a Samaritan, a friend of publicans and sinners, one that had a Devil,
etc. Thus was it in the Primitive Church; thus is it still: If the godly do any
thing amiss, how do they toss and increase it? If they do but groan under an
infirmity, they will be sure to set that abroach against them; if they know
nothing, they will devise some evil of them, or if they hear of any from
others, though never so unlikely, or on never so a bad ground, yet shall it go
for payment, and current; yea, though they can make their own vices go under
the name of virtues, yet they will call their virtues by the name of vices: If
zealous, then hot and rash; if courageous in a good cause, then stomackful; if
patient, then blockish; if wise in their matters, then subtle fellows; if
diligent in their place, very officious, busy, medlers, troublesome; if they
run not to the same excess with others, then precize fools, etc. Thus even for
their godliness do they speak evil of them, and so call light darkness, and
darkness light.

1. Therefore, Use 1.
Gods people must walk wonderful warily.

2. They must not think it over-strange, Use 2.
nor be discouraged, if notwithstanding all their care of well-doing, they be
ill spoken of.

3. Use 3.
We must not readily believe of men that have carried themselves well, all that
we hear; but try it out, ere we censure, or change our mind.

4. For ill speakers; Use 4.
Its a woeful badge of Ishmaels generation, that shall be shut out of Heaven,
Isa. 5. 20.
and of Satan's brood, Prove. 17. 15.
who accuses the Brethren: Cursed are they, Jude, verse 14.
God has appointed a time to judge them for their cruel speakings.

Nay, the world will not only speak ill of Gods Servants, but do ill to them,
slay them, as Cain dib Abel; imprison them and pinch them, as Ahab did Micaiah;
cast them into a dungeon, as the people did Jeremiah; into the Lions den, with
Daniel; spoil them of their goods, as those in Heb. 10. 34. rack them, torment
them, torture them; even such as the world is not worthy of, and that for their
good works; so Herod dealt by John Baptist, and thus were the Apostles served,
and after, the Martyrs in the Primitive Church, and since, multitudes under
Antichrist.

If therefore we meet with hard dealing, and doing as well as speaking, we must
not think it strange: If we can hardly bear a few ill words, how shall we bear
stripes? how Imprisonment, and loss of all, yea, toturings and death? ye have
not yet resisted unto blood, or undergone the fiery trial: Heb. 12. 4.
we have infinite cause to be thankful together for our governors, for if they
were so minded as many particular persons, there would be no peace for any
zealous Christian: If I had authority, will some say, I would hang up all these
Puritan knaves, etc. Neither must we think the worse of those that be troubled,
for the the very best have been thus dealt withal.

They may be ashamed, A godly conversation stops the ungodlies mouths.
etc.] The best way to stop the mouths of the world, and to make them think
well that they have done otherwise, is not by goodly great words, but by a good
and constant godly conversation: Thus David convinced Saul, for he spared him,
when he could have once and again killed him: Thus have many who have thought
very hardly of such and such upon reports which they have heard of them, upon
the view of their godly and innocent carriage been much grieved that they were
so far abused: See Acts 16.
Thus were the Martyrs thought well of by the common people, yea, by great
ones, yea, by their very Jaylors.

1. As therefore we would muzzle and stop the mouths of our adversaries, Use 1.
that they may have nothing to say against us, nay, may be brought to
acknowledge and love the truth, and be converted and glorify God in the day of
their visitation, let us live holily and innocently; else if they find us
halting, we set open their mouths to speak ill, continue them in their ill
mind and hard conceit, and set them further off from all goodness: Too too
many professors fail this way, either they fall into foul sins, or live not so
christianly, or else at least, with zeal they are very rash and indiscreet, by
every of which, much hurt has been done from time to time.

2. This shows them to be odd persons, Use 2.
that knowing and seeing the innocent conversation of Gods Servants, yet cannot
be satisfied nor quieted, but still speak evil of them; a sign of a very bad
heart, who therefore will hate them, because they be good, whereas those that
be but indifferently minded and civil, seeing their good conversation, 1 John
3. 12.
will think and speak well of them: Cain had no other cause to kill Abel, Gal.
4. 29.
but for his godliness; nor Ishmael to mock Isaac, but because he was the Son
of the promise; nor these to speak evil of those, but because they are godly:
Assuredly, a life agreeable to their profession should stop their mouths.

Verse 17. For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
well-doing, then for evil doing.
NOw follow some reasons to persuade to willing suffering for righteousness
sake (which was then common, Why we ought willingly to suffer for righteousness.
and the profession of the faith dangerous) 1. For that this being a world
wherein we must suffer, its better a great deal to suffer for well, then for
ill doing. 2. Because the Lord will have it so, to whose will we must be
subject.

For its better, Its better to suffer for well then evil doing.
etc.] Naturally we will choose the better, if we know it, so should we in this,
seeing we are subject to suffering, and that we are apt by nature to evil, and
so to suffer for it; we must choose rather, as being far better, to suffer for
well, then for ill-doing: Its every way better; Reasons.
better, as being more pleasing to God, he delights in the one, Mat. 5. 10, 11.
not in the other; pronounces those blessed, these accursed: Besides, Acts 5*
41.
its no credit to suffer for ill doing, but matter of shame and reproach, Phil.
1. 29.
whereas its honor to suffer for a good cause: That of the penitent Thief seems
to import so much, we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward of our deeds
(and so have cause to be humbled) but this man has done nothing amiss: Luke
23. 41.
Again, there is no comfort in suffering for ill-doing, as there is for
well-doing. Suffering of it self is ill and grievous, therefore there had need
be somewhat to mitigate it, but if it be for well-doing, a good conscience will
bear it out; its for Gods sake, its that wherewith all his servants have met,
and hereof the conscience takes notice, and that to this there is a reward, none
at all for the other.

1. This rebukes those that suffer for their foul offenses, Use 1.
Theft, Adultery, and the like; howsoever they be punished, yet have they cause
of hanging down the head, not for the punishment, but for the cause: O how many
refusing to be ruled by God and his Word, bring misery upon themselves and
ruin? The Gaols are full, the gallows catch many: Its a fearful thing when
they go to their punishment impudently, and be not ashamed and humbled, its but
the forerunner of fearful judgments: When therefore men have brought themselves
into trouble justly, their best way is to be humbled, and repent, so shall they
find favor with God and men: We must avoid evil, as we would avoid suffering
for ill-doing, avoid the sin, if we would avoid the punishment: We are also to
be careful that we suffer not for Railing, Slandering, Backbiting, Meddling
with other folks matters.

2. This may comfort them that suffer for well-doing; Use 2.
its pleasing to God, they are fellows to the Saints, Prophets and Apostles;
the honor is great, the cause is good, how base or grievous soever the
punishment be: Both John the Baptist and Barabbas were imprisoned; Achan and
Steven stoned; and Witches and Martyrs be burnt; the cause was not the same,
and in the cause the shame lies: If a Christian (as Paul) be a prisoner, and
have chains on him, and being demanded why he came there, and is there so used;
if he can truly say, Its neither for Treason nor Felony, I thank God, but for
preaching the truth of God to the world, then its well; yea, this will quiet
his conscience, when he knows its Gods cause, who will take care of him,
strengthen him, and receive him to glory.

If the will of God be so,] Here Is the other Reason: We must be patient and
comfortable in suffering for well-doing, for its Gods will it should be so.
Here note, that

No affliction or persecution comes to us, No affliction comes to us but by
Gods* will.
but by the will of God: Whatsoever was done to our Savior Christ, was done by
Gods determinate counsel; not an hair falls from our heads without our heavenly
Father: Acts 2. 23. and 4. 28.
Christ foretold Peter of his bands before they came, and so Agabus forewarned
Paul of his, Mat. 10. 17, 18.
which shows that they came by the will of God. Acts 21. 11.


Obj. How can this be by the will of God, seeing its a wicked thing, and
displeasing to God that his servants should be persecuted for well doing, and
he has both forbid it, and will punish the same.

Answ. As it comes from the Devil and persecutors, How far God has an hand
therein.
its a sin, and they do wickedly, and its forbid, but God has an hand in it so
far forth as it is good, and he that brought light out of darkness, can and
does bring good out of the evil of the wicked: They intend evil, but God good,
as in Jobs losses; so in crucifying Christ, Judas, the High Priests, the Jews,
Soldiers and Pilate did evil, yet all this was by the will of God, even so far
forth as it was the mean of our Salvation, and thereupon Peter that gave
counsel against it, Mat. 16. 23.
was rebuked sharply; so in the affliction of Gods children by the ungodly, the
devil and they of spite punish them for their goodness, and to discourage them
quite, but God wills this for many good reasons; James 1. 12.
as, to try his, that they which be approved might be known, Rev. 2. 10.
and to exercise and try their faith and patience, and show, that they serve
not in show, and for wages; to confirm the truth, not for it self, for their
sakes which are weak ones, and to leave the others inexcusable; to manifest the
wickedness of the wicked, and make way for the manifestation of the glory of
Gods justice in plaguing them, as the glory of God is made manifest by the
constant and patient suffering of the Righteous, which they could never have
done of themselves.

1. Here Is a comfort to Gods servants, Use 1.
that we are not left here to the will of the Devil and wicked men, to do what
they list against us: O no, they are set their bounds, beyond which they cannot
pass: The Devils could not enter into the Swine without permission, nor go one
whit further with Job then God gave Commission: A Sparrow falls not to the
ground without his providence, Mat. 10. 31.
and we are of more value then they: The Lord appoints out our troubles, and
measures them; they shall not be as little as we would, for then should they be
too little (our tender nature loathing troubles, and being unwilling to undergo
the same) nor so great as our adversaries would (for then would they be too
great) but as God will: Simile.
The wicked are but the Lords drudges to scour us and make us bright; They are
his Landresses to wash us white, not so little as we should be never the
better, nor so much as should rend the Lords linen.

2. When we be ill dealt with in word or deed by the men of the world, Use 2.
we should sit down quietly and bear it: Its the will of God it should be so,
and he does all things in infinite wisdom, and lovingly for the good of his;
accordingly when Paul would needs go to Jerusalem, Acts 21. 15.
where he was to be in great danger, his friends said, The will of the Lord be
done; thou may say, If the Lord has sent this to try me, I pray God
strengthen me; if to chasten and purge me, then to awaken me out of security
and love of the world: I thank God for it, if he will any way have glory by me,
I am glad, blessed be God, its his will, I am content to wait upon him; not but
that we may with our Savior and the Apostle Paul, plead our innocence, as also
use lawful means for our freedom, if God see it good.

3. But yet let the wicked think never the better of themselves, Use 3.
nor look ever the more to be freed from punishment, because its Gods will, for
they do it to no such end, and therefore he will cast the rod into the fire
when he has chastened his children, as he did by Ashur, and the enemies he
used to punish his people: Did Judas, or the Priests and Jews, aim at the
Salvation of the world in Christ's death? Nothing less; Covetousness drove on
the one, malice the other: If God brought good out of it, what thanks to them?
He is to be praised for his goodness, they to be plagued for their sin.

4. We must not bring trouble upon our selves, Use 4.
for in that we can have no comfort, but if God bring us into it, we may
comfortably look up to him.

Verse. 18. For Christ also has once suffered for sins, the just for the
unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but
quickened by the Spirit.
ANother Reason to persuade to courageous suffering for righteousness sake,
from the example of Christ, Christ suffered, therefore need not we shrink or
think much: He that was just, yea, that just one, therefore much more may we
that be sinners, and by infinite degrees deserve more grievous things then we
suffer: He for the unjust, for us wretches, and to take away our sins, and
reconcile us to God, therefore ought we to bear somewhat for his cause, that is
most just, and has done so much for us. Speak we first of the words briefly,
as they are the reason of the point in hand, and then more particularly and
largely of the matter contained therein, namely, The Sufferings, Death and
Resurrection of Christ.

Christ suffered] Suffered every way, Christ's sufferings an encouragement for
Christians to suffer.
in Body, Mind, Name, at the hands of men, wretched and base persons misused
him, railed at him, slandered him, spit on him, smote him, scourged him,
crucified him between two Thieves, John 13. 16.
etc. Now, The servant is not greater then the master; If they misused Christ
so, what may we look for? In thy sufferings, help thy self with this
meditation, Christ Jesus suffered, and what am I to him?

The just] He is the just one, Acts 3. 14.
as God, How Christ was just, how we.
holiness it self, as man filled therewith, above Men and Angels. Just, not as
Job, Zachary and Elizabeth; They were Righteous by his Righteousness imputed to
them, as Abraham also, but he by his own; they by Sanctification imperfectly
Holy and Righteous, he most perfectly; nor as Adam, who though perfectly Holy
and Righteous by his own Righteousness, yet was mutable therein and lost it;
not so in Christ, but immutably so: There was no guile found in him, none could
accuse him of sin; nay, he was the light and glory of the world, yet suffered
he gross things: We then, though never so just and innocent, must not think
much if we suffer altogether without cause: Its the better, its but as Christ
did.

But alas, Use.
we are very faulty before God, and deserve far greater things then we meet
with, yea, cannot be innocent toward men, how much less toward God? The
meditation of this point, will much help us in our sufferings.

For the unjust,] Another help in our sufferings.
That is, for us wretched and miserable sinners, and his enemies, who could do
nothing for him to deserve such kindeness: How much rather ought we to suffer
for him that just one, and for his sake, especially considering our sufferings
are nothing to his; The meditation of this also, will much help us in suffering.

For sins, Christ suffered for our good.
that he might bring us unto God,] Christ's sufferings were altogether for our
good, and if it had not been for them, we had been utterly lost: But for ours,
they be nothing to him, he is never the better for them, neither be they for
his benefit, but for our own, even the purging of our souls, the trial and
proof of our faith and patience, and the preparing of us to the greater glory
in Heaven.

Let Us think of this also, Use.
and it will make us suffer the more willingly and patiently: Lastly, as he
after his sufferings and death rose again, and entered into glory, The godly sow
in tears but shall reap in joy.
and sits at the right hand of God; So if we shall sow in tears, we shall reap
in joy, having fought the good fight, we shall receive an incorruptible crown
of glory.

1. This reproves our notable tender daintiness, 1 Timothy 4. 8.
that can endure nothing for Christ, Use 1.
but as if we were too good to suffer* though in company we should hear never
so much spoken against Gods Servants, and sincerity of Religion, we can be
silent and pass by the same; and there are many that would be forwarder, but
for fear of being counted Puritans: O cowardly fearfulness! No wonder if such
be never called to that honor to suffer for Christ, What if to please the world
we be lukewarm, and God vomit us out of his mouth? What if for our zeal the
world hate us, and God approves of us? what do we lose? James 4. 4.
Shall we make friendship with the world? Know we not that its enmity with God?
2 Cor. 10. 18.
He is praised that is allowed of God.

2. Let us take heed of all preposterous zeal, Use 2.
and rash unwarrantable causes, whereinto some run^under color of zeal, and be
zealous for God; we cannot hate sin too much, nor love goodness too much, nor
the Word too much, nor keep the Sabbath too carefully, nor govern our families
too religiously: Let us go on in a zealous godly life, and if this offend any,
let them pardon us, we would do no other then God requires, and for this we
must pray our Landlord or whosoever to give us leave, we have served the Devil
a great while, tell them, Its time now to begin to serve God, and to look about
us for our souls good; thus in suffering for well^doing, we may be comforted,
and by these reasons kept from being discouraged. Now of Christ sufferings,
death and resurrection, particularly.

Christ has once suffered for sins, Particulars here laid down about Christ's
sufferings.
the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God,] In handling the
sufferings of Christ, observe, 1. The circumstance of time, or how often he
suffered, once, 2. Who he was, or the quality of the person suffering, Christ
the just. 3. For whom he suffered, for the unjust. 4. Why he suffered, even for
sins; and 5. To what end, that he might bring us to God; and hereinto our
Apostle is again willing to fall, as we should be to hear and often meditate
thereof, as has been already showed in the end of the last Chapter; namely,
from verse 21. to verse 24. Much profit follows on it.

For 1. It sets out a notable mixture of justice and mercy. Profit arising from
the meditation hereof
2. It shows what a mighty Savior we have, in whom we may trust, and to 2 Timothy
1. 12.
and accordingly of all that have assurance of their part therein, requires
Sion. John 3. 16.
7. It provokes us to labor to know whether Christ has dyed for us or not,
Ephesians. 2. 4.
and for our assurance thereof, 1 Pet. 1. 3.
to find that we are truly humbled,

Use.
that all civil persons which trust to their own righteousness, that all
worldlings, whose hearts are altogether glewed to the things which are here
below, and do not so much as mind those things which are above, the same being
out of their element, that all profane persons which go on in open notorious
lewd courses, and that all Hypocrites (not to speak of Turks, Jews, and
Papists) which content themselves with shows and common gifts, would but duly
meditate on Christ's sufferings, that so they might have part in Christ!
Assuredly, all they that believe not, shall be condemned, but of all others,
they that have lived under the Gospel, shall have greatest judgment; and to
make up all, it will increase their torment, to think that they had offer made
of Christ, and yet had not the grace to apprehend it; that they were so near,
and yet missed, and that some that sat with them were converted and are now in
Heaven, and they careless or wilful, are now in irrecoverable damnation: This
will make them gnash their teeth, gnaw their tongues, and curse themselves and
the day wherein they were born: Let such see, feel, confess, and fly to Christ,
there being no other way of Salvation besides him. I come to the particulars
propounded.

The first concerns the time, All Christ's sufferings make up one perfect
suffering.
how often he suffered, Once: Its true, Christ suffered throughout his whole
life, and that diversely, but all make up one perfect suffering; and he suffered
so, as at once he finished al, never to suffer again, wherein his suffering is
opposed to the sacrifices of the Law, which were continually renewed, because
of their imperfection; Heb. 9. 26.
whereas he suffered once for all, for being God as well as man, he both
endured the infinite wrath of God, and besides, his person was of such infinite
worth, as gave such value to his sufferings, as fully satisfied the justice of
God.

1. This confutes the Papists, Use 1.
who make Christ's sufferings imperfect two ways, namely, by teaching that we
our selves must suffer the punishment of our sins (hence are all their masses,
penances, pilgrimages, almsdeeds, and charitable Works, to take away the
punishment of their sins after Baptism) and by their renewing of Christ's
Sacrifice in the Mass, which is (as they say) a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the
sins of the quick and dead: Their distinction of bloody and unbloody is but a
shift.

2. This is a wonderful comfort to all Gods children, Use 2.
that our debt is so fully dischaarged, that there is nothing remaining for us
to suffer. Thus of the first.

The second concerns the quality of the person which suffered: The quality of
the person that suffered.
He was that just one, the Lamb of God, which was undefiled and without spot,
Heb. 7. 26.
conceived by the Holy Ghost in the womb of the Virgin; had he not been such a
one, he could not have been our Savior: Though he was innocent, yet were our
sins imputed to him; and though we have not suffered, neither of our selves
have Righteousness, yet as verily as he had pain and sorrow, we shall have
mercy and Salvation through him: what can be more comfortable? Thus of the
second.

The third concerns the persons for whom he suffered, For whom Christ suffered
The unjust, not the Devil nor Reprobates, but for the Elect, which yet are by
nature unjust and wretched, servants of sin, and children of wrath, as well as
others: He has suffered for them that be never so unjust, provided they feel
their misery, and have course unto him for help.

1. Then, Use 1.
for them that be in great distress for their sins, and think they be so many
and so great, that they cannot or shall not be forgiven, let them be comforted,
Christ came to dye for the unjust, to call sinners to repentance, to seek and
save that which was lost: If being weary you will come unto him, Matthew. 11. 29.
as he invite you, you shall be refreshed: Isa. 1. 17.
Though their sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they
be red like crimson, they shall be as wool: Paul was a great sinner, yet
forgiven.

2. Let such, Use 2.
as bad as they be, yet come to Christ, and be truly humbled; He came to save
such as thou art, as Mary Magdalene, Zacheus, the Jailer, and such others: His
mercy on them, may put thee in hope, and provoke thee to seek unto him. Thus of
the third.

The fourth, Why our Savisuffered.
Why he suffered for sins, for our sins, to take them away, for they only are
our woe; our sins caused all Christ's sorrow, and his sorrow is our happiness.
Thus of the fourth.

The fifth, To what end he suffered.
To what end he suffered, that he might bring us to God: Ever since Adams fall
we are gone from God, and born strangers, nay enemies to God, and therefore
further and and further off from God, and are gone to the Devil indeed: Now
Christ by his death reconciles us to God, and him to us, and makes a blessed
peace, so as we may look up to him as to our Father, and come into his presence
with comfort: He also gives us grace by his holy Spirit to be renewed,
sanctified, and so to do works pleasing unto God, and when we dye, brings our
souls to God, as afterward possesses both body and soul of Heaven.

1. Then how infinitely are we bound to God? Use 1.
how welcome should Christ Jesus be to us all? One would think all should flock
unto him, for as none are with God, but such as came by him, so neither shall
there be: All that mourn for their sins, come to him, believe in him, and obey
him, he will bring them to God; such as continue in their enmity against God,
shall for ever be separated from him: Many hope to go to God, that were never
reconciled to him through Christ, nor sought after it, but its as possible for
a dog, for the Devil to enter into Heaven, as for us, without being reconciled
to God by faith in Christ: Is it not lamentable that Christ should have so few
that enquire and search after him, nay, that reject him, being offered again
and again!

2. How welcome faithful Ministers should be to the world; Use 2.
The worst hurt we wish you, is but to bring you to God, we are appointed
Christ's instruments herein, we must Preach him, and persuade you to embrace and
believe in him, by whom you may be brought unto God; we have a worthy task and
work, and so must not either be idle, or by false teaching, and wicked living,
drive you from Christ, but be faithful, that your Salvation may be our Crown;
yet of all persons and kinds of people, the world thinks we may be best
spared, and are unto most, Isa. 2. 2.
of all others most unwelcome: John 1. 40, 45.
But not alone Ministers, but even every private man, must help men to God as
much as he can: They that by vile counsel, bad example, or otherwise, drive men
from him, are not Christ's, but the Devils instruments and Factors. Thus of
Christ's sufferings.

Being put to death in the flesh,] This clause concerns his death, as the
following his resurrection: He was put to death concerning his Humane nature;
for as for his Godhead it could not dye, and he was quickened and raised again
by his Divinity and Godhead: John 1. 14.
By flesh is meant his whole Humane Nature, 1 Timothy 3. 16.
as in the following; By Spirit, his Divine Nature.

Our Savior suffered not only in body and soul things intolerable, That
Christ must have dyed, and so did.
but he also dyed, gave up the ghost, as all the Evangelists set down, and
other Scriptures testify, as they also that speak of Christ's blood, of his
offering himself a Sacrifice for our sins, of his bearing our sins on his Body
on the Tree, Isa. 53. 9.
and the like: Dan. 9. 26.
This was prefigured of all the Sacrifices of the Old Law; The Prophets also
foretold that he should be slain: Neither could it have been otherwise, or
otherwise he been a Savior for us, for our sins deserved death, and God had
pronounced that death should be the reward thereof: This his death was
voluntary, Romans 4. 25.
accursed (as we had deserved it) for our sins, and for a common good.

Which meets with that wicked opinion of the Jews, that neither think it
voluntary, nor that it is a propitiatory Sacrifice for sin, as it is indeed,
and wherein our happiness lies, and without which we must all have perished
for ever.

The benefits ensuing to us hereby are diverse: The benefits ensuing by Christ's
death.
1. We are delivered hereby from all kinds of evil, from the first and second
death, and all forerunners of both, 1 John 1. 7.
and from our sins the cause of all; Its the blood of Christ that cleanses all
our sins: Rev. 1. 5.
So from all Spiritual enemies; Luke 1. 71, 74. Col. 2. 15. Heb. 2. 14. 1 John
3. 8. So from the second death, Romans 8. 1. Gal. 3. 13. as from the first, so
far forth as its a punishment and piece of the curse, and the nature of it is
changed to believers, for whom Christ has dyed; its become a Serpent without a
sting, yea a blessing, as being hereby freed from sin, and not before: Hereby
the soul is let out of the prison of this body, into the liberty of Gods
Servants, and put into the possession of life: Hereby also the body is freed
from all toils, labors, infirmities, and pains, waiting in the Grave for an
happy and glorious resurrection: In which respect death is termed a sleep, an
advantage to the Saints, and is better in the day wherein they were born: So
from all forerunners hereof, which are curses, plagues and punishments, in
body, mind, goods, and name, all which Christ has born; what crosses we meet
withal, they are to further our Sanctification and Salvation, but not
punishments for sin, or parts of Gods judgment, as they be to the wicked. 2.
We are hereby made partakers of all good, God is David, who though he staid his
wrath from Absalom at his return home to Jerusalem, yet was not fully
reconciled to him of two years: See Romans 3. 25.
The Creatures also are at peace with us; Col. 1. 21.
The Angels become Servants and ministering Spirits for our good, 1 John 4. 10.
in life, to direct us, Hosea 2. 18.
protect us, comfort us, etc. and at death, to carry our souls to Heaven; Psalm.
91. 13.
so all other Creatures: the very Devils and wicked men shall do us no hurt, we
have also right and title to this life, we lost it in Adam, but have it
restored in Christ. 1 John 3.
3. Hereby he conveyeth power into

This is a singular comfort to all that believe in Christ, Use.
who only partake of the benefits of his death; we need not fear Hell,
condemnation, nor any enemy of our Salvation, nor any curse or punishment in
this life, all shall be for our good; we need not fear the first death, but
rather have cause to desire it: O the happiness of such! God is at peace with
them, all Creatures in Heaven and Earth are their friends, they have right to
whatsoever they have, little or much, therefore may they rejoice: O happy that
ever we were born, what pains soever we have taken to come to the knowledge of
Christ Jesus, by whom we obtain such unspeakable things! whatsoever the world
esteems of believers, they are the only happy persons in the world, yea, we
shall have power to mortify our strongest corruptions and lusts, fear it not,
beg it, and use the means, if all these be put together, O how happy is a
Christian! who can value his riches? On the contrary, they that have not their
part in Christ's death, are most miserable; their sins are not removed, they lie
under them, so under the curse of God in this world, and the world to come; so
in danger of the first death, which will rend the soul and body asunder, that
the soul may be cast out into Hell; so also of the second: O that such would
labor for their part in Christ, Christ came into the world, Christ is now
Preached and offered unto us, men be in a woeful case, and are told of it, and
yet how few regard to embrace Christ, how few customers has Christ? one would
think that all that hear of Christ, should be heartily glad of him, and embrace
and fly unto him; but alas, most men for profits, pleasures, or love of their
vile lusts, are content to let go Christ, and he lies as a dead commodity, and
they that bring him to the world be unwelcom, and so indeed few have part in
Christ.

The consideration hereof, might make us mourn for our sins, the cause of
Christ's death, might be a corrasive to eat our sin, and make it odious to us,
might make us serve God zealously and faithfully all our days, yea, to suffer
for his sake, and rather to dye with the Martyrs, then any way to dishonor him;
and besides, to labor to find the virtue of Christ's death, working mightily in
us the death of sin, and sinful lusts. Thus of his death.

But quickened by the Spirit,] Now of his Resurrection: His body and soul that
had been sundred, were by the power of his Godhead reunited, and he made alive,
so continuing with his Disciples until his ascension into Heaven.

Touching it, consider, that it was so, the Reasons thereof, the place, manner
and time, with the benefits flowing from thence, and the duties thereupon to be
performed.

That Christ rose again, Christ rose again from the dead.
is so plain, that none needs doubt thereof: The Angels that rolled away the
stone, the Soldiers that watched the Sepulcher, Mary Magdalene and the other
Mary that came to see the Sepulcher, the two Disciples going to Emmaus, the
eleven Disciples being together, etc. all were witnesses hereof: So his
appearances were many, as to Mary Magdalene, then to her and that other Mary,
then to two Disciples going to Emmaus, then to them all save Thomas, then both
to Thomas and the others; another time to Cephas, another time to seven of them
at the Sea of Tiberias, 1 Cor. 15. 5.
as at another to Five hundred Brethren at once; so when he was to ascend, he
was taken up in the sight of all those there present; all which are so many
evidences of his Resurrection.

Reasons: Why he rose again.
1. That it might appear he had fully discharged our debt. 2. Because being the
Son of God, and Author, and Lord of Acts 2. 24.
3. By reason of the second part of his Priesthood, which was yet to fulfill:
One part was, to offer himself a Sacrifice Propitiatory Rev. 1. 28.
to make intercession for his Church, and to apply the virtue of his death to
those for whom he dyed: This he could not have done, if he had not risen again.

The manner: The manner of his Resurrection.
When they had rolled a great stone to the door of the Sepulcher, sealed it,
set Soldiers to watch, yet he rose: They could as well have hindered the rising
of the Sun in the Firmament, as his rising; An Angel was sent that caused a
great earthquake, and rolled away the stone, etc. No counsel or strength can
hinder the work of the Lord.

Place: The place from which he rose.
The same where he was laid, which was by Gods providence to avoid cavils, in a
new Sepulcher hewn out of a rock, wherein never man had been laid.

Time: When he rose.
It was the third day, early in the morning, on the first day of the week, the
third day, as was foretold by Christ himself, for he was buried the evening
before the Sabbath, and rose the day after; so long between, to approve the
truth of his death, and no longer, that he might see no corruption: Early in
the morning, to show that he was the light of the world, the Son of
Righteousness, a light to be revealed unto the Gentiles, Psalm. 16. 10.
one that was to lighten every one that came into the world, namely, that is
lightened, even us that are by nature darkness it self; from hence must every
man fetch light: On the first day of the week, for so God disposed of it: This
first day was answerable to the first day of the world; it was the morrow after
the Jews Sabbath: As he began to make the world the first day of it, when
before it was not, so now that it was decayed and corrupted by sin, he now came
to make it up again, which he did by his Death and Resurrection.

Hence the Reason of the alteration of the Sabbath, Why the Jewish Sabbath was
changed.
from the Jews Sabbath to the day following, which is ours, to keep a memorial,
as of the Creation of the world, so especially of the renewing of the world, by
the work of Redemption; and as the first Sabbath continued from the Creation to
Christ's Resurrection, so no question ought this to abide to the worlds end.

The benefits ensuing hereupon are, The benefits hereof.
1. To assure us that Christ has fully paid all our debts: 1 Cor. 15. 17.
If Christ be not risen (says the Apostle) we are yet in our sins, and our
preaching is in vain. 2. To give us power to rise

Use.
nay, rather which is risen again, for whom therefore there is no evil
remaining: They shall have power given them to walk in holiness of life, as the
Syon, graft into a stock, receives juice and life therefrom; yea, they shall
enjoy a comfortable and joyful Resurrection: Contrarily, miserable is the case
of the wicked; their debt is all on the File against them, they shall rise but
to their cost and smart, to a dreadful judgment, when they shall stand
trembling, and wishing that the hills might fall on them, on them the second
death shall have power: Now they lie snorting, neither will be awakened by our
preaching, notwithstanding their present and approaching misery.

The duties which are hereupon to be performed, The duties to be performed.
are, 1. In imitation Ephesians. 5. 14.
to a new and holy life: O awake thou Heb. 11* 35.
rather then to be deprived hereof: The faithful in Heb. 11. endured racking,
and would not be delivered therefrom with an ill conscience, Col. 3. 1.
Thus of his Resurrection.

Verse 19. By which also he went and preached to the Spirits in Prison: Verse
20. Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long suffering of God waited
in the days of Noah, while the Ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight
souls were saved by water.
THe Apostle proceeds to comfort the faithful that suffer for Righteousness
sake: A further comfort to them that suffer for Righteousness sake.
He had said before, That as Christ rose again after his sufferings, and had a
good end of them, so shall all that suffer for his sake: Now, lest this should
be doubted of, he shows how it comes to pass, namely, by the help,
assistance and power of the Spirit of God; who as he showed himself mightily in
Christ's person, so has and will in his members: and for instance, he looks
back a great while ago, when long before Christ's coming, the Spirit showed
himself to the confusion of the wicked and disobedient, and to the comfort and
deliverance of Gods servants; as Noah, whom as this Spirit enabled to preach
the to wicked world, so they disobeying and mocking him, the same Spirit
preserved and saved in the common destruction: And therefore if the Spirit of
God showed himself so in the people of God, for their good so long ago, then we
need not fear, but that he will much more show himself in and with us, inasmuch
as now the Spirit is bestowed in a larger and fuller manner, then before our
Saviors coming into the world: Now he reckons this, rather then any other
example, because it was a famous one, both of convicting the wicked world, and
preserving the servants of God in such a bad time, and because it was so long
ago. I come to the meaning of the words.

By which (his Spirit) namely, The meaning of the words.
his Godhead and Divine Nature, which raised him from the dead, He went and
preached, namely, by the mouth and ministry of Noah, To the Spirits in prison,
even them that be now and were in Peter's time Spirits and Souls in Hell, but
when Noah preached, were disobedient men and women, when God seeing the
notorious corruption of the times, threatened to destroy the world with a flood,
if they did not repent: To them Noah preaching, both by word, and by deed also,
in preparing the Ark, they not being moved hereat, nor at the long suffering of
God, were at the length drowned, Noah only and his wife, with his three sons,
and their three wives being preserved in the Ark.

This Scripture has suffered (as Mr. Luther says of the Lords Prayer) much
Martyrdom by false interpretations, and erroneous constructions, whereof that
of the Papists is most gross.

They understand it thus, How the Papists understand them.
that Christ being dead, in his soul went down to the lower parts of the world,
where be four several places together, one above another, Limbus patrum, Limbus
puerorum, Purgatory, and Hell, which is the lowest and hottest of all; that
Christ went into Limbus patrum, to fetch out all the godly Fathers that dyed
from the beginning til his coming, and all such as in Noah's time seeing the
flood come, indeed repented, and went to Purgatory, and had there suffered all;
and so were gone into Limbus patrum also, to deliver the souls then in
Purgatory; and into the lowest part, namely Hell, to Preach to the convicting
of the Reprobates there, etc.

But though in truth Christ had done thus (which yet he never did) this proves
no such matter, Reasons against the same
will afford no such sense: for 1. By Spirit, which has relation, is not meant
Christ's soul, but his Godhead; not his soul, for then it was, that Christ was
quickened in his soul, or by his soul, but neither can be true; not in his soul,
for his soul never dyed, nor was mortal; not by the soul, for it was not the
soul that raised him again, but the power of God that joined them both
together, as the Scripture testifies: and that his Godhead is hereby meant,
will appear by the like places, as Romans 1. 3, 4. 2 Cor. 13. 4. 1 Timothy 3. 16.
where that which our Apostle calls flesh, Saint Paul calls infirmity; and what
he calls the power of God, our Apostle calls the Spirit, both which are in
effect one. 2. Hereby Noah's time, and no other age of the world. 4. This
Prison Abraham's bosom, nor the place of the Fathers. 5. Even after our Saviors
Resurrection, when had not delivered them, nor fetched them out, but they that
had been there, were there still: And where they say he went to Preach to the
Reprobates, this will not stand neither; for he speaks here only of the
Reprobates of Noah's time, and why should Christ in his soul go unto them,
rather then unto any other? Besides, to Preach to them, and do them no good,
nor intend any, is against the nature and end of preaching.

But that there are any such places as Limbus patrum, Limbus puerorum, That
there are no such places as Limbus patrum, and puerorum.
or Purgatory, the Scripture gives not any inkling. 1. That the Fathers went to
no such place, is certain, but that their souls loosed by death, went to
Heaven; Jesus Christ, yesterday, to day, and the same for ever: They had the
same benefit by Christ (as we) Abraham saw my day and rejoiced: John 8. 5, 6.
They ate the same Spiritual meat, and drank the same Spiritual drink, 1 Cor.
10. 3.
and so were partakers of the same benefits of Christ. 3. Their Spirits went to
God that gave them; they Abraham's bosom into which Lazarus was carried by the
Angels, Eccles. 12. 7.
was above, Isa. 57. 2.
not beneath,

For Purgatory, The Popish opinion about Purgatory.
they say, there is such a place in the brim of Hell, where the pains be almost
as bad as Hell pains, and the fire as hot, into which are sent the souls of the
godly, that dye in faith and repentance, but yet have not suffered the
punishment of their sins in this world, therefore must make up their sufferings
in Purgatory (for they teach, that for our sins and punishments both committed
before Baptism, Christ suffered, but for those after Baptism, though Christ
takes away the sins, yet the punishment must be suffered by our selves, and
that partly in this life by penances, etc. and the rest by suffering in
Purgatory; and that for every sin is due seven years of payment in Purgatory,
and therefore the Pope gives Pardons, sometimes for fifty, sometimes for an
hundred years, etc. and therefore they say Masses for the souls of them that
have been dead many 100 years; and when they have suffered for all their sins,
and paid the utmost farthing, then come the souls out; and after they have been
a while refreshed in a fair green field, full of pleasant flowers, which is hard
by Purgatory, then they go up to Heaven; notwithstanding, oftentimes through
the mercy of the Popes, those pains are mitigated. Reasons against it.
We say, 1. That as they themselves do not agree about the place, etc. So
neither is it otherwise grounded, but on unwritten Luke 2. 29.
all the Scriptures sound; with Simeon, they depart in peace, go not to
Purgatory, scorching pains; Christ is to them, as in life, Phil. 1. 21.
so in death, 2 Timothy 4. 8.
advantage: Having finished their course, henceforth there is laid up for them a
crown of righteousness: 2 Cor. 5. 1.
They have, after the dissolution of their earthly Tabernacle, John 17. 24.
a building of God, an house not made with hand, eternal in the Heavens; Christ
has prayed for them, Luke 23. 43.
that they may be where he is, even in Heaven: The thief on the right hand had
as much need to have gone to Purgatory as any other, yet on that day wherein he
dyed, he was with Christ in Paradise. Rev. 14. 13.
Blessed are they which dye in the Lord, says the Spirit, for they rest from
their labors: After death, presently comes the judgment, that every man shall
stick to. Among all those things which God spoke to Moses, there is not a word
of this; among all the Sacrifices that God ordained, there were none appointed
for souls in Purgatory; and amongst all the cleansings and purifyings of all
kind of impurities of Leprosy and Issues, etc. there is not a word of this:
What, was God so unmindeful of his Church and people then? Neither is there in
all the new Testament any word for it. 2. What a wretched thing is it to hold,
that our sufferings should satisfy the wrath of God, and punishment of our
sins, when the least sin deserves eternal destruction both of soul and body.
And for their distinction, that Christ's death gives power to the pains of
Purgatory to satisfy, is an idle and ridiculous conceit. 3. To say that Christ
should satisfy for our sins, and take them away, but not our punishment, is it
not a wicked abuse of Gods justice? where he forgives the sin, does he not also
forgive the punishment? True, he chastens his servants, but they are no part of
satisfaction of his justice, only a means to prevent sin to come, and humble
for that which is past; as if I had a quarrel against a man, I might forgive
him, and yet if I see him in an Appoplexy or Swoon, I may hit him a blow to
fetch him again. The truth is, Why Purgatory was devised.
Purgatory was devised, partly of a blind and curious devotion of some Monks,
that thought that they that had some beginnings (as they thought) of goodness,
and so dyed, it were no reason they should be damned, etc. who were therefore
to be purged in Purgatory, and so come to Heaven; and that seeing most men have
much sin in them, even when they dye, it were unreasonable they should go
straight to Heaven, for no unclean person shall come there, and therefore they
must suffer and be cleansed in Purgatory: Who does not see the absurdity of
these conceits, when the Scripture says, Whosoever believes in him shall not
be condemned; John 3. 18.
and that whosoever dies in the Faith, all their sins and corruptions are done
away, and they received into Heaven: But principally the Pope and his Clergy
out of covetousness, were chief founders hereof; for hereby they did infinitely
enrich themselves, and every where enjoyed the very fat in the Land: It was
devised for the pampering of the living, not the punishing or purging of the
dead: Through their covetousness, meeting with the peoples ignorance, Purgatory
was hatched.

But what a cruelty is this of the Pope, who has power, as he says, to
deliver as many as he lists out of Purgatory, and yet will suffer so many so
long to lie there frying? But he knows well what he does; if he should make it
too common, or let out too many, then would the people care the less, and say,
Though I go to Purgatory, yet the Pope of his clemency will deliver me, and so
I mean to give my goods and lands to my children, and not beggar my posterity
by giving them for Pardons or Masses, etc. Thus indeed their trade would go
down.

1. This may stir us up to give thanks to God for his mercy, Use 1.
in delivering us from those cousenages, and revealing unto us his truth: We
ought to be so much the forwarder in every duty toward the worship of God, the
Ministers maintenance, the poor, etc. you save it an hundred times over,
through the preaching of the Gospel truly: Its a foul fault in people, that
they cannot be content thus to enjoy their goods and lands, and leave them to
their children (which they could not do) but pull and rake from the Minister,
care not how little they allow him; yea, and are so miserable, as they will
scarce allow their part to keep the house of God upright, or in decent sort,
neither give the poor without grudging, or upon necessity.

It may comfort the godly; Use 2.
There is no delaying place by the way, to keep them from the joys of Heaven.

3. It may teach men in any wise to look to themselves how they live, Use 3.
for as soon as the breath is out of them, they go presently to the place where
they shall abide for ever; Eccles 11. 3.
as the Tree falls, so it shall lie.

Neither went he down to Hell to preach to the Reprobates; That Christ went not
down to Hell to preach to the Reprobates
for as its absurd for one soul to preach to another, so preaching is to do
some good, and thereby only to do hurt is against the end thereof: But, say
they, he only went and preached experimentally by his presence, and showed
himself to them to convict them, but they were already sufficiently convicted,
condemned, and put in their place of torment; if Christ should have gone
thither to convict them again, they were not sufficiently convicted before: But
if they say he went to triumph over the Reprobate there, etc. it may be
answered, That he triumphed on the Cross, and shall triumph over the Reprobates
mightily on the day of Judgment. I proceed unto the Doctrines of the Text.

By which also he went and Preached,] Here note,

1. That when Gods faithful Ministers Preach, Gods Spirit preaches in faithful
Ministers.
its the Spirit of God that preaches in them: Holy men of God spoke as they
were moved by the holy Ghost; He that hears you ( says our Savior) hears
me. 2 Pet. 1. 21.


1. Therefore Ministers must endeavor so to preach, Luke 10. 16.
that it may appear unto all, Use 1.
that its the Spirit of God which Preaches in them; their matter must be
sound, and wholly agreeable to the will of God; and for the manner, 1 Cor. 2. 4.
it must not be with enticing words of man wisdom, but in demonstration of the
Spirit, and of power; we must not seek our selves, but Gods glory in the
Salvation of our people: Such as for their matter Preach contrary to the Word,
its not the Spirit of God which Preaches in them, but the Spirit of Error; and
for the manner, such as use a dark kind of Preaching, or curious and quaint
terms, or in such sort as the people cannot understand or profit, do they woo
for Christ, or rather do they not speak for themselves? Such kind of Preaching
is blasted and cursed of God, and the Preachers thereof shall have their reward
accordingly.

2. Let people know, Use 2.
that when they come to the Word, they come not to hear such a man (whosoever
he be) but to hear what the Spirit of God says to them; a great privilege: we
must therefore prepare our selves rich accordingly with all reverence and fear
(as having to do with God himself) laying the same to heart, and endeavoring to
be profited thereby, in yielding obedience thereto: O how many come hand over
head, sit sleeping at Church, and are no whit moved with whatsoever is said?
Did we but believe that it were Gods Spirit that did Preach to us, we would
give better heed. If we speak according to the Word in rebuking you for your
sins, you are not to fret, and say, O some body has told him hereof, or he
does this of ill will; but acknowledge, See 1 Cor. 14. 25.
that its Gods Spirit which rebukes you, and that God is there indeed.

3. Gods people may be comforted by the promises delivered in the Word (as the
wicked may be terrified by the threatenings thereof) They shall come to pass,
Use 3.
for that the Spirit of truth has uttered them.

2. That God will find a time to right things, God will find a time to right
things when they are disordered.
when they be disordered: Though the wicked may prevail for a time, and
iniquity abound and overflow, yet will the Lord in his due time come to visit
and reform all; Thus did the Lord deal with this people.

Let the godly have patience, Use.
and wait Gods leisure; and for the wicked, let them be never the lustier for
that the Lord is patient, and defers for a time, for he will come to give every
one his due, and will come too soon for their turn.

In prison,] The woeful condition of the wicked.
That is, Hell, the place appointed for the souls of the wicked, a fearful
place, of Gods own preparing, and whereof the Devil is the Jailer. For the
wicked,

1. They shall be separate and cast from God, in whose presence stands Matthew.
25.
that as they regarded not his presence here, so hereafter they shall not enjoy
it.

2. They shall be cast into the society of Devils and Reprobates,

3. Not in their company, to be with them in jollity and merriment, Though
Israel be as the sand of the Sea, yet but a remnant shall be saved.

O how might this cool the wicked, Use 1.
the proudest that live in jollity, and set all others at naught! Now they are
lusty, and swear, and curse, and do what they list, poor woeful creatures: There
is a prison prepared for them, that will pull down the proudest of them; sour
sauce to their sweet meat, but most live as if there were no such matter. O
what fools be they, that for a few short profits ill gotten, or only sought
after, or some transitory pleasure or honor, sell themselves to this woeful
place. These count themselves wise, and Gods servants fools; but the contrary
will be seen one day, and that they themselves were indeed the mad fools.

2. How should this stir up them to be thankful to God, Use 2.
that know themselves freed from this woeful place, and to Christ that has
suffered for them? O what cause have they to rejoice, to walk obediently, and
to bear their few short afflictions patiently? and for those that know it not,
me thinks they should never be quiet, nor sleep good sleep, till they know they
are delivered from this prison.

3. This should make us all, Use 3.
not only careful to save our own souls out of this place, but to do all our
endeavor to save others, especially them that be committed to us; as, Ministers
to preach diligently, zealously and plainly, 2 Cor. 5. 11.
to save their people out of Hell, and pull them out of the fire; such as do
otherwise, are merciless and cruel; so Magistrates to punish sin zealously,
that they might not be condemned hereafter; so must Parents toward their
children, by prayer, counsel, education, correction; so must every neighbor do
what he can to save his neighbor: If thou do them no good, yet shall they
wish one day that they had been ruled by thee.

Which sometimes were disobedient,] Disobedience the cause of Gods judgments
on the old world.
Here Is the cause as well of their bodily punishment by the flood, as their
eternal judgment in Hell, even for that they were disobedient to the
Commandments of God, and among the rest, to the Ministry of Noah: This is
aggravated from the length of Gods patience showed toward them (though God
told them how long he would wait, yet did not they hereby become the wiser) and
by the real sermon which they had, which was, the building of the Ark: They had
both time and means to have repented, but not repenting, their sin was the
greater, and so was their judgment.

Q. Were all, save those eight here mentioned, drowned?

A. The Text is plain, that all were drowned.

Q. Were all those that were drowned damned? Whether all those which were
drowned were damned.


A. It is said, That the earth was filled with cruelty, they are also termed
the world of the ungodly; and its likely that if any had been openly known to
have been good, the Lord would have preserved them that they should not have
perished in the waters with the rest; yet its possible that even among them
that were drowned, there might be some good, and it were hard if we conclude
that all were damned; some were youths, some infants, not capable of sin, some
not born, whereof some might belong to God. Again, it might be (though not very
likely) that some might repent in truth when they saw the flood come. However,
most no doubt were utterly cast away for ever, yet some might be saved
eternally, though they had part in the bodily punishment; as Cain a Reprobate
had part in the temporal deliverance, and yet perished eternally. Hence perceive

1. The exceeding and almighty power of God, Use 1.
that was able thus to take vengeance of the impiety of the world, even of such
an infinite multitude, by such a judgment; there is no power nor counsel against
him: He is the Lord of Hosts, and has all Creatures in Heaven and Earth to use
to preserve his, and to destroy his Enemies; even from the Angel which
destroyed Senacharibs host, to the very lice and worms, fire, air, earth, hail,
blasting, mildew, lions, bears, etc. are at his command; See Act 12. 23
there is no Creature so mean, which he cannot use to destroy the very proudest
Tyrant: How should this strike terror into the heart of every wicked man, and
make him humble himself at the footstool of the Lord, and break off his sins by
unfeigned repentance. The people of Tyrus and Sidon feared Herod, Ibid. 20.
because he could hurt the Land, who yet himself was worms meat; God can plague
and destroy a thousand ways: What art thou that rebellest against thy Maker,
the Lord of the whole world, who has Heaven and Earth, and Hell at his
command, and all Creatures in them? He is able to plague thee which way soever
he will, every hour of the day: He is able by the greatest, by the meanest also
of his Creatures to destroy thee, as he can also immediately by himself: But if
he let all these alone, he is able to find enough in thine own bowels to
torment thee, some ill humor in thine own body or bowels to vex and weary thee;
any tooth in thy head may drive thee to extremity of pain, Dan. 4. 5.
thine own thoughts may take away sleep from thee; yea, drive thee into
desperation, Simile.
as it befell Judas. Most Princes if a great many be in a transgression or
rebellion, either cannot resist them, or if they could, dare not put them all
to death, for fear of rising, or want of Subjects; its not so with the Lord, he
has no need of men; if they rebel against him, he will cut them off, if they
be never so many, he fears not: O let none sin with the multitude, thinking to
be hidden or escape, for God has judgments enough, and has prepared Hell
large enough, though there be never so many that rebel against him.

2. The wonderful justice of God, Use 2.
and how he hates sin, that thus revenged it upon the whole world: This is a
part of his name; he will not account the wicked innocent: Psalm. 5. 4, 5.
He is a God that hates and abhors iniquity, Leut. 26. 14.
and has showed it in all ages of the world: Deuteronomy. 28. 15.
He has storehouses of judgments here against the wicked, and has prepared
for them a prison and place of torment for them hereafter. This should now make
them tremble and fear, hate sin and repent of it: He has done justice on the
whole world, and do thou think to escape? The world makes an Idol of him, all
of mercy; such examples as this, and that upon the Israelites in the
Lamentations, and many other, show his justice; and this is such a dreadful
example of Gods justice, as should make all the world to tremble. If we should
see an hundred men executed together, how would it daunt us? what will it then
to consider, that thousands thousands are sent into Hell?

If any shall think that of those which were drowned there might some be saved
eternally, Two necessary considerations.
because oftentimes Gods servants be taken away in common calamities, let them
learn, 1. To judge charitable of men taken away in such cases. 2. Not to
promise themselves any certain freedom from outward calamities; howsoever, we
must not voke God hereunto, but yet herein to commend our selves to God, as
which shall not hurt our souls: Though we be wrapped among the wicked in some
bodily affliction, yet lets be of good comfort, we shall not be so at the day
of Judgment, we shall be delivered from eternal punishment.

But disobedience is as the forerunner of destruction, Disobedience is the
forerunner of destruction.
its as the sin of Witchcraft; he who is the Lord of the whole world, and
requires obedience of all, cannot endure that men should contemn and disobey
the admonitions of his Word, whereby they are called to repentance: This is
men's destruction, see 2 Chronicles. 36. 16. Isa. 1. 5. Hos. 5. 4. Mat. 23. 23.

This may serve to awaken this woeful world, Use.
that is set upon disobedience. Most men do what they list, and follow their
own lusts, as if there were no Law, nor any had to do with them; yea, though
God call upon them, and send his Ministers unto them, yet they will not give
their minds to repentance, but harden their hearts: Oh, those carry a badge of
their destruction, and a mark whither they are going, a certain forerunner of
judgment here, or to be sure of eternal destruction hereafter: He that lives
in a flat disobedience of any Commandment, John 3. 36.
and in any known sin, is in the state of damnation: He that commits sin is
of the Devil. 1 John 3. 8.
If thou live in impenitency under the Word, know that thy judgment sleeps
not.

For their particular disobediences, their licentious living, their security
and carelessness, their following of their lusts, their intemperancy in eating
and drinking, their oppression and cruelty one toward another, The sins of our
times like those of the old world.
etc. they be the common sins of our times, and therefore we may justly fear
some heavy judgment, which in likelihood for those few sakes amongst us which
fear God, has been all this while kept off us. What marrying now only for
beauty, there being no regard had of Religions, and whence this Gyantly
generation (not in stature, but lewdness) springs? How are some set only
upon pleasures, some upon their profits; and what wrestling and clambering is
there to get preferment? most care not whom they tread under, so they be aloft.

When once the long suffering of God waited] This aggravates their sin, Gods
Patience toward the disobedient aggravates their sin.
that they continued disobedient, notwithstanding God did both wait for their
repentance, and set them a time of One hundred and twenty years, but nothing
would do them good: Thus did he to them, thus to this Nation, thus to every
particular, person of us.

1. They that have received grace and are converted should be thankful to God
for his great patience toward them before their calling: Use 1.
Oh, every one of us have much cause of thankfulness this way: Oh, if God had
cut us off in our sins, and days of our vanity, yea, after many a warning that
we despised, we had now been howling without hope, with the damned spirits in
Hell; yea, if God had taken away his Gospel and Peace from us but within these
few years, nay happily within this twelve months, in which time God has shined
into our hearts, and has had mercy on us, how miserable had been our condition?

2. Others that are not as yet converted, See Psalm. 50. and 55.
must make use of this patience, through their timely repentance: But alas,
most do abuse it to the quite contrary; Isa. 57. 11.
O how fearful will their case be, which having had experience of Gods long
suffering these twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years, yet abide in their old
sins? If their judgment was the greater by the abuse of this patience, then
what shall those amongst us, which have had longer patience, and a thousand
times more means? The time allotted them, an hundred and twenty years, was not
above the third part of the life of a man then, which being compared with that
has been allotted us, and the usual time wherein men now live, it will appear,
that by way of proportion, we have had far more; and besides the sermons of the
Prophets, of Christ and his Apostles, we have had faithful sermons from the
faithful Ministers of God: Those of the old world shall rise up in judgment
against us, as also Sodom and Gomorrah, and shall speed far better then we. O
therefore, lets abuse the patience of God no more, Heb. 2. 13.
but to day, whilst it is called to day, not to harden our hearts, etc. Oh, do
we this the rather, because God has set the time how long he will bear with
us, which if it should once be out, it would be then too late for us, he would
bear with us no longer, but would either snatch the Gospel from us, or us from
it by death, or give us over to hardness of heart, never to be moved, or to
feel our misery, but when it is too late, as it befell Esau, and the foolish
Virgins: Therefore it is said here,

Once the long suffering of God, etc.] That is, it being out, there was no
longer time to be granted, nor though they had cried, would God have heard, and
so we may suspect, that there were but a few (if any at all) which either
repented when they saw the flood come, or whom (though they cried) the Lord
regarded, for that the time set was then expired.

In the days of Noah,] Here Noah's name remaining up record, honorably
registered: He says not in the days of any of the Giants, whose names are all
buried, but in the days of Noah; God vouchsafes not so much as to name them.

In the Scriptures the godly are spoken of to their honor, The names of the
godly mentioned to their honor.
but the wicked are either not named at all, or else to their disgrace, and
their brand: Jeroboam that made Israel to sin, Ahab that sold himself to work
wickedness, 1 King. 15. 34.
wicked Athaliah, See Prove. 10.
that cursed woman Jezabel, Judas that betrayed him, etc. or with their sins at
large to their eternal reproach: But how sweet is the memorial of the godly
mentioned in Scripture? as of Mary Magdalene, Lazarus, etc. In Stories also we
have the names not only of famous Ridley, Latimer, Cranmer, etc. but even of
meaner men, and not only of men, but of women also, yea, and of those, even of
poor ones, who are worthily reported of; whereas the names of their
persecutors, are either altogether unknown, or if they be spoken of, as Bonner,
Gardener, and others, its with stopping the nose, etc.

How may the servants of God be comforted? though happily they are mean in the
world, yet their names be written in Heaven, and shall abide, when the names of
the wicked shall rot: Labor then to be Religious and godly, that ye may be well
reported of alive and dead; else if ye be wicked, ye shall have an ill report
in the Church of God whilst ye live, and leave a stinking memorial behind you
when ye are dead, both which are fearful.

While the Ark was a preparing,] The old world then most disobedient, when they
should have been by Noah's making of the Ark feared therefrom.
Another thing whereby their disobedience is aggravated, that it was even then,
while they saw Noah busy in making an Ark, which might have admonished them of
the flood, for he in Faith made it, obeying the Commandment of God: He believed
what God had threatened, but so did not they.

1. Note here, That if Noah because of the flood threatened, made an Ark to
save himself from it, Christians must use the means whereby to be freed from
Hell and destruction.
as God had commanded; its our duty much more, as I may say, to prepare an Ark,
and use the means to save our selves from drowning in Hell, the pit of
perdition. There is a certain flood of destruction, whereinto all such shall
fall, as have not before got into the Ark, as all that were out of this Ark
perished. The making of this in likelihood, was a matter of great cost, of
great toil, and without doubt he had many a mock for his labor when he went
first about it, and whilst he continued working at it, yet went he on: Faith
and Repentance an Ark for the soul.
As that was for the body, so are Faith and Repentance for the soul; whosoever
have these shall never perish, but have everlasting life: For these we must
labor, whatsoever pains they cost us; yea, and if it were to hinder our outward
estate hereupon, and expose our selves to mockings and revilings: Whosoever
misseth of these, whatsoever else they have, shall questionless perish; the
word tells it, and we are to believe it.

1. This rebukes the monstrous folly and madness of the world. Use 1.
Gods Ministers, his Noah's, preach the flood, and persuade every man to make
ready his Ark; but alas, how few look after any such matter, nay (as in the old
world) they rather mock at those that do, or that take pains to hear the Word,
which is the way to get Faith, or that take pains to lead a godly life; O these
precise fellows, they be so holy, and these Scripture fellows, they be so holy,
as they will be in heaven ere their bones be cold, etc. whereby it appears,
that (as Lots sons in Law about the destruction of Sodom) they believe no flood
at all, Genesis 19. 14.
no judgment at all to come; or else happily they think it an easy matter to
make an Ark at any time, either thinking that some easier and nearer may be
found then by Faith and Repentance (as those that hope to be saved by their
good meaning, good prayers, civil life, etc. which will assuredly deceive them)
or that they are easy to be obtained: Was Noah One hundred and twenty years in
making an Ark to save him from drowning in the waters, and can they at
pleasure, and on the sudden, make an Ark to save them from Hell, and to get
into Heaven; as most hope by Lord have mercy upon me to be saved? But as no
doubt, many used sundry shifts to save themselves when the flood came, and none
prevailed but the Ark, so shall it be with all such: O what if the flood should
now come (as it may ere the morrow) is your Ark ready or not? If it be not,
defer the time no longer: No man knows that he shall live One hundred and
twenty days, or a quarter so long; yet though Noah knew he should live so many
years, he did not defer the time, delay the making of the Ark: It will not be
done on the sudden, and after this life there is no making of any; 1 Kings 6. 7.
as there was no hewing of timber or stone in the Temple, but all in Mount
Lebanus: Look to it therefore betimes, regard neither the costs nor pains you
may be put to: Its no matter so you be saved.

2. This may comfort them that have their Ark prepared, Use 2.
though thousands and ten thousands perish, yet they shall not do amiss, but be
preserved and saved as Noah; then shall not we weigh what pains we have taken
to make it, to hear the Word, to humble our selves, to repent, etc. And have
not others taken as much pains for transitory things, that will vanish and
never do them good? and though you have been mocked, yet will the time come,
when those mockers will change their note.

Again, in that they saw and heard of this Ark a building, which ought to have
been a real Sermon to them, yet were not moved, their sin becoming hereby the
greater.

2. Note, How useful Examples and occular sermons are.
That when God adds to his Word Examples, and to the Ministry real Sermons
also, these ought much to prevail, which when they do not, as well the sin as
the judgments of the Delinquents become the more fearful; for the more means
men have, if they profit not thereby, See Luke 17. 32
the greater will be their judgment, as our Savior said of Corazin and
Bethsaida. 1 Cor. 10.
When God threatens to plague wicked men, it should make them stand in awe, but
when they see the same, it cannot but pierce more: To this end, though God has
left some part of Scripture in Precepts and Doctrines, yet has he left most in
Story and Example, Ezekiel. 12. 3^.
accordingly the Prophets used both: Therefore when God in his Word exhorts to
diligence in laboring after Salvation, and to lead an holy life, this ought
much to move; but when men see Examples of such people before their eyes, Iam.
5. 10, 11.
this ought to move the more.

This condemns the notorious obstinacy of our times, Use.
that notwithstanding the Word God adds so many examples of his judgments on
wicked men, more by far then we could have looked for in the days of the Gospel;
as untimely ends upon Drunkards, and notorious profane persons, etc. that
would take no warning; yea, happily of a dozen of them which have been in a Town,
Dan. 5. 22.
cut off by one judgment or other, yet who fears? nay, do not others continue
in the same state (as some old Drunkards) without amendment, as other new ones
grow up every day? The like may be said of other sins: Belshazzar profited not
by the judgments of God on his Father, as most do not by any judgment on
others: What answer have they to make, and what judgment waits them, that
have had many examples, and yet never the better? so of notorious covetous
gripers, oppressors, rakers, how blockishly and fearfully they have dyed, with
the miserable end of their goods? either woefully wasted by drunkards, or
dispersed to those that never sweat for them, yea oftentimes to their very
enemies; who sees not? yet who are moved hereat? let these look for greater
judgments; so when God raises up many godly Christians, that earnestly labor
after their salvation, taking great pains to hear the Word and to live godly,
most receive no profit by these real examples and Sermons, but some mock at
them, and think them more precise then needs; as others are blockish, and are
no whit moved thereby: They might think with themselves when they see some such
take such pains, that there is somewhat in it, some ill to be avoided, some
good to be obtained, some great matter that should move these people to take
such pains; surely (might they say) its not for nothing, they have business as
well as we, which they could tend if a greater thing were not in the way; its
not for nothing that they thus weary themselves. But most do not understand or
consider thus much with themselves, and yet God has raised up such as lights
to draw on others; and they that be not won by the Word, nor moved by the
examples of the godly, their answer will be fearful: Little do these people
think that those that have traveled by their doors, wet and dry, and come
through their grounds to hear the Word, shall one day be their Judges; It had
been happy for them, if they had dwelt further off.

3. In that this ark did betoken the judgment of God to come, Wicked men fear
not Gods judgments.
and yet they feared nothing; Note, that wicked men fear not Gods judgments,
Thus was it with the Sodomites, with Lots sons in law, with the Israelites:
Prove. 14. 16. and 22. 3.
This is indeed a token of a wicked man, as being an argument of unbelief,
Atheism, and hardness of heart, and that they are mad on their sins; and 28. 14.
These are sure to fall into destruction.

This condemns the common unbelief and impenitency of most men, for though they
hear Gods judgments denounced against sinners, and that they hang over the pit
of Hell, and that he will judge Whoremongers, and Adulterers, etc. and that no
such shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, and that they are thieves for every
bit of bread they eat, and that if they come to the Sacrament without their
wedding Garment, they shall be bound hand and foot, etc. yet they fear no
colors, but go on like blind Bayard. People were of old afraid of Purgatory,
but these are not, whatsoever can be said of Hell, or the day of Gods dreadful
judgment: But they that now fear them least, shall one day feel them most;
whereas Gods Servants, which tremble and humble themselves, with David,
Habakkuk, and Josiah, hiding themselves with God, shall escape, and they that
fear them least before they come, and are boldest in sin, See Mr. Dod on Psalm.
14.
they are most stricken with horror, and most cowardly, when they come, as
Ahaz, Saul, Belshazzar, etc.

Wherein few, that is, eight souls, were saved by water,] Here Is the proper use
and end of the Ark, The preservation of Noah and his Family from drowning: By
souls we are to understand men and women, and by being saved, their temporal
deliverance.

1. In that the Ark preserved them, and was not overturned with the raging of
the waters, and that Noah with his were not choked, being so long there with
beasts. Note, That

What God will have a thing to do, Weak means are sufficient through Gods
blessing for our preservation.
though it seem never so weak, or unlikely, yet it shall be sufficient to
effect it, as Sampsons jaw bone, the compassing of Jericho, Daniels pulse which
he eat, the Whales belly for Jonah, Jordan to cleanse Naaman; so by the
foolishness of Preaching, by the Ministry of a few mean men (to speak of in
comparison) to convert the Gentiles, etc. If God shut up Noah in the Ark, he
shall be safe enough; yea, and how many poor live and prosper with a short and
bare allowance, and many of them in sickness, get up with poor help and means?
O the happy condition of Gods Servants, what means soever they have, if God
bless the same, they shall suffice to do them good! Hereof, how often in time
of danger when means have failed, or weak means only were to be had, have we
had experience?

2. In that Noah with six other righteous persons besides himself were
preserved. Note

Both the reward of righteousness (though not for merit, Righteousness shall

but Gods mercy) and what a dignity and privilege it is to be righteous; one
such is more worth, 1 Timothy 4. 8.
then ten thousand others: As they are the glory, the wicked are the dross; so
do they find, that godliness has the promises both of this life, and that
which is to come.

O what a provocation and encouragement ought this to be unto us, Use.
to labor to approve our selves to God, to be righteous in Gods sight, and to
walk with him! Such shall be preserved from all evil of body and soul; for
those that be otherwise, they lie open to all judgments here, and to eternal
destruction hereafter: O that men could believe the odds between the one and
the other!

Cham, being with his Father in the Ark, was preserved from the Flood, but
after was cursed and condemned for his sin, and is in Hell. Note, both that

Its good to be near the godly; Its good to be near the godly.
The place, and they that be with them, fare the better for their sake, as
Laban for Jacobs, and Potiphar for Joseph's, wicked Jehoram for Jehoshaphats,
all in the Ship for Paul's, No man can be saved by the goodness of another.
and here Cham for Noah's, and none can be saved by any other bodies goodness:
The soul that sins shall dye, and every one shall be saved by his own Faith:

who was such a good man. Note further, That

Though the wicked both may and do often escape bodily dangers (as Cham did)
yea live, The wicked however they escape bodily dangers, shall meet with
everlasting judgments.
wax old, and grow in wealth, etc. yet they shall not escape the everlasting
judgment of God for their sins: While they continue their sins, (whatsoever
their prosperity be) their judgment sleeps not, neither does their damnation
slumber.

4. In that of those which were saved from drowning, being but few, yet one was
not saved eternally. Note, That

It ever has been, There are but a few which shall be saved
is and will be, that a very few have been or shall be saved; thus you see it
was in the old world: So was it under the Law, when all the Nations lived
without God in the world, only God was known in Jury, yea, though Israel was
as the sand of the sea, yet but a remnant of those were saved: How few in the
wilderness, but were disobedient? how few under the Prophets, but were
idolatrous and stiff-necked? In the days of Christ, where was faith to be
found? and now (not to speak of the Jews, Turks, and Pagans) even among
Christians, does not the love of most wax cold? Narrow is the way to Heaven,
and there be few that find it; Many are called, but few are chosen. Gods
people are a little Flock; Faith and Repentance (without which none can be
saved) be so difficult things, as few attain them. An Hypocrite and civil man
may go far, but come far short: If indeed to speak two or three good words at
ones death, were a sign of repentance (as numbers hold) or Heaven were so
easily come by, in vain did Gods Servants humble themselves, and labor to
cleanse themselves in innocence. I would never care for coming into Heaven, if
it were so easily obtained; as the Arrian at Norwich, about to be Executed,
said to one standing by, The speech of an Arrian at his death.
Do you think Christ would forgive me, if I did confess and believe in him, and
acknowledge him? O says the party, without all doubt he would: To whom the
Arrian, If your Christ be so easily to be entreated, Matthew. 7. 21.
I Will never believe in him: But not every one that says, Lord, Lord, shall
enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: Faith and Repentance, with the change of a
man, is the greatest work in the world. Though we cannot judge the precise
number of those which shall be saved, neither yet who they are, yet generally
this is true, That in the visible Church, but a few shall be saved.

We must not therefore content our selves to do as most do, Use.
or the rest of our Neighbors do, but rather as the fewest do, else we can
never enter into Heaven, or be saved; we must crowd, and strive hard, and labor
to be of the number of those few which shall be saved; we must give all
diligence hereunto, seek after this, cry for this; we must not content our
selves with any shadows of grace, but seek after true grace, which is to
salvation; we must not content our selves to be of the family of the righteous,
but must labor and find that we our selves are righteous.

5. In that he terms those eight which were saved Souls (by which word also
elsewhere men and women be meant) which is not at any time given unto any other
Creature: Genesis 46. 27.
Note, Romans 13. 1.
that

Men and women be more excellent then all other Creatures; Men and women be
more excellent then other creatures
they have reasonable souls, and so capable of the mysteries of God, of the
image of God, of the graces of his spirit, and immortal souls, and so capable
of living in glory for ever.

1. If God has bestowed infinite more cost on man then on all other Creatures,
Use 1.
how should we by serving God with our reason, and having our souls adorned and
filled with the gifts of the Spirit of God, labor to excel them? O the
miserable and base madness of most men, who though being endued with reason,
they are apt to serve God best, and may observe all Creatures serving them in
their kind, yet rebel against him, and so become indeed void of reason! And
how do most let their souls lie unfurnished of saving knowledge, and other
graces, like bruit beasts: Happy they had been beasts, God made them men, but
they live like beasts that perish.

2. Our care must be more for our souls then our bodies; Use 2.
Those be immortal, shall live even when parted from the body: O the folly of
most people, that toil and care for transitory things, as profits and
pleasures, food and raiment, but have no care for any thing that is eternal;
God gave them souls capable of immortal glory, and they have so neglected the
seeking hereof, as that they must dye eternally, and be in woe for ever.

Noah and the old world were a right picture of the good and bad in our age;
Noah and the old world a right picture of the good and bad in our age
while he was carefully workiug, they took their pleasure, but in the end he
was saved and they drowned: So now the servants of the Lord, they knowing their
sin and danger, they spend their time in mourning and humbling their souls, and
in making of an ark of Faith and true Repentance, wherein to save themselves
from the flood of Gods wrath, which they know they have deserved: They take
pains to hear, read, pray* mortify their affections and lusts, abridge
themselves of many profits and pleasures, having many reproaches from men, and
hard measures, yea, it may be crosses and afflictions from God to further them
in a good course; while in the mean time the common sort they follow the swinge
of their own hearts, and do what they list, they follow their profits and
pleasures like Esau, and often escape afflictions, and have great prosperity,
so that one would think their case happy in comparison of the state of the
people of God: But mark the end, time will come, that the people of God shall
be saved, and escape drowning, when the jolly world shall fall into the pit of
eternal perdition: So the children of God begin in tears, but they end in joy,
whereas the wicked begin here in jollity, but must end in eternal howling;
which of these is the best, choose the first or the last, that which perishes,
or that which endures to life eternal.

Verse 21. The like figure whereunto, even Baptism, does also now save us (not
the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience
toward God) by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ.
HEre the Apostle shows, That those of old had Types of their Salvation as
well as we; for the preservation of Noah in the Ark from the flood, when the
world was drowned, was a Type and Figure of their eternal Salvation from the
flood of Gods wrath, by the Messiah to come: To which Type of theirs, we have
another correspondent answering Type, or Antitype, a Type fitly answering, and
like theirs, even Baptism, which is a sign and seal of our eternal salvation,
and so is said to save us. It saves us, that is, seals up our salvation; not
that the outward Baptism, that is, the washing of the body with water, does
save (for that Hypocrites may have) but the inward, that is, the pardon of our
sins in Christ's blood, and purging our nature by Sanctification; whereof being
assured by Faith, we have a good conscience, and hereby have boldness to make
demand, and challenge of God eternal Salvation, which God cannot deny, having
so covenanted in Baptism to the believer; and hereunto we attain, not by the
work wrought, or our being Baptized, but by the death and resurrection of Jesus
Christ, his death purchasing it, and his resurrection witnessing the same;
whereof this last, which is the complement and finishing of the other, is only
expressed in this place.

The like figure whereunto, etc.] Here note, That

Throughout all ages the godly have been saved by the same means that we be;
The godly throughout all ages are saved by the same means.
we by faith in Christ who is come, as they in him to come: They are the same
spiritual meat, and drank the same spiritual drink, only we have a more fuller
and clear revelation of him.

Even baptism, 1 Cor. 10. 3.
does also now save us, etc.] This is the first Sacrament of the New Testament,
Baptism what it is, etc.
and is ordained in the room of Circumcision, as the Lord's Supper in the room
of the Passover; as Circumcision did precede the Passover, so does Baptism the
Lord's Supper; that being a sign of our ingrafting, this of our growing in the
Church; and as amongst the Jews, even Infants were to be circumcised; so
amongst us Christians, are Children to be Baptized: Hereof the outward sign is
water, whereby the blood of Christ is fitly resembled, which is that effectual
water which does wash and cleanse our souls: It must be pure, not mixed water,
in respect of great personages, neither must any thing be added thereto, as
salt, oil, etc. And the person Baptized, must neither be marked with an hot
iron, as amongst the Ethiopians, nor Circumcised, as its the practice of
others: In ours, though some things be retained, which some good men have
stumbled at, yet they that be so shie of them as to forsake the Church, as the
Separatists do, or neglect and omit Baptism, or break the peace of the Church,
by seeking to have their Children Baptized elsewhere, they are too bird-eyed,
and I think its ignorance and weakness in them; if they were retained, as the
Papists used them, putting holiness in them superstitiously; yet if there were
no other cause but this, we should not forsake the Church, nor refuse Baptism;
much less seeing our Church does altogether protest against superstition in
them, and retains them for order only: The thing signified, is the inward
cleansing of the soul, which being impure through sin, is filthy before God,
till it be washed by the blood of Christ, and Spirit of Sanctification; yet as
there are some which will see no filthiness therein, so are there others, which
are so far from seeking to be purged, that they wallow still in the mire of
their lusts. By this Sacrament also, there is an inward and Spiritual thing
sealed, and grace conveyed, though an unbeliever sees it not, contrary to the
opinion of the Katabaptists, which teaches it to be a badge only of a
Christian profession, and no further; yet are not the sign and the thing
signified always and necessarily tied together, and so Baptism does not save by
the work wrought, as the Papists would: Even Reprobates may have the outward
Baptism, which yet does them no good, but rather is a witness against them.

For not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good
conscience toward God does save us,] The uses of Baptism.
To believers indeed, both sign and thing signified go together, and they may
receive much comfort from their Baptism; as by it make a confident demand of
Salvation from God, for they believing and desiring to obey God, there was
sealed up in their Baptism, the pardon of their sins and sanctification, both
which they may confidently challenge at Gods hand, and therewith eternal life:
This Sacrament also is our badge and livery of God, and of our holy profession,
whereby we differ from Pagans, Turks, Jews, etc.

This is also an instruction to us, Use.
to lead a holy life, Romans 6. 4.
as we did profess and promise when we were Baptized: This is an help to keep
us from sin for the time to come, being provoked thereto, we may answer, that
we cannot in respect of our Baptism; yea, this also is useful to raise us up to
repentance after we be fallen; and as no doubt it did Noah good every time he
saw the Ark, so seeing Baptism saves us, that is, is a sign to us of our
Salvation, we should often meditate thereof, Who is to Baptize, and who to be
Baptized.
and be glad to be put in mind of the same.

For those which are to Baptize, they must be lawfully called hereunto, and for
those which are to be baptized, they are not all men, but they that be within
the pale of the Church, neither are beasts, or dead things to be Baptized: The
Popish Baptizing of Bells, is an horrible profanation of this Sacrament:
Baptism is a sign of Regeneration, neither does it profit without Faith,
therefore none may have it, but they which be capable of Regeneration and
Faith: but of these particulars, as also of the Baptism of Infants, the time of
Baptism, who are to be present thereat, who to present the child to Baptism,
the witnesses, the name, the form and manner, whether Baptism be of absolute
necessity to Salvation, whether John's Baptism, and Christ's were all one, or
diverse, with diverse the like; I have largely spoken by way of Catechizing.

By the resurrection of Jesus Christ.] See Romans 4. 25. and 8. 34.
Here he shows that we are not to rest in one Baptism, to find Salvation in
it, but to look to the death and resurrection of Christ, whereby our Salvation
is purchased and procured, though it be sealed up by Baptism: He puts one for
both, his Resurrection, being the accomplishment of our Salvation, and
Testification thereof, containing his death under it.

Verse 22. Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God; angels,
and authorities, and powers, being made subject unto him.
HEre follows another Reason to comfort Christians, in suffering for Christ's
sake; namely, that he for whom they suffer, and who is their head, is advanced
into most high dignity, being ascended into Heaven, and there at the right hand
of God, etc. that is, has all power in Heaven and Earth committed to him in
his Church, all Angels, Principalities and Powers, both good and bad, being
made subject to him, who therefore can make the good to serve our turn, and can
repress the bad, much more can he repress the violence and rage of men, that
persecute his people.

Touching the Ascension of Christ, What our Saviors ascension was.
I have showed you what it was, namely, that our Savior having sufficiently
manifested the truth of his resurrection, and confirmed his Disciples by the
power of his Godhead, and partly by the supernatural property of a glorified
body, he left the Earth, and was taken up into the highest Heaven, and there
is, and so shall continue till his coming to judgment.

1. That he did ascend, That he did ascend.
the Scriptures declare unto us, He himself foretold it, Luke 24. 51.
first, more darkly, afterward more clearly; then most clearly, Acts 1. 9.
when it was at hand: Neither was it without cause, partly because as his
Manhood had suffered the lowest abasement, John 6. and 14. 19. and 20. 17.
so it might be advanced into the highest glory, Why he did ascend.
and partly that he might also perform such things as were to be performed for
the good of his Church, namely, the Application of his death and merits, to
those for whom he suffered, and the sending of the holy Ghost, etc.

2. The persons before whom be did ascend, Before whom he did ascend.
were not the Scribes, Pharisees, and Jews, but his Disciples; those had seen
enough already, but not profiting thereby, they were left to themselves; these
were to Preach his ascension to all, God having ordained, men rather by hearing
then seeing should be saved.

3. The time, The time when he did ascend.
not till he had sufficiently proved his resurrection, Gods goodness appearing
herein, that would have all main points so clear, that they that will not stop
their own eyes and ears, might believe. Neither did he ascend till he had
comforted his Disciples, against all the troubles they were to meet with, and
instructed them in the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God; They that have
charge over others must be careful to leave them in good plight.
hereby teaching that all which have charge of others, must be careful to do
all the good they possibly can to them that be under their charge, while they
be with them, and after to provide to leave them in as good state as possibly
they can: Thus should Magistrates (with Moses, who trained up Joshua, to
succeed him) Thus should Ministers (with the Apostles Paul and Peter) Thus also
should Householders, Parents, Masters do, that when they themselves shall dye,
others may succeed them, which may do as much, if not more service in the
Church of God, then they did: But who do thus employ their talents for the good
of souls? O what a fearful answer have most to make!

4. The place from whence he did ascend, The place from which our Savior
ascended.
Bethany, or the Mount of Olives, both which were close together; that which
was often the place of his mourning, and most sorrow, was now the place of his
greatest comfort: Even there where Steven had such mighty adversaries, Acts 7.
56.
he had a most clear sight of Heaven open, and of Christ standing at the right
hand of God: Even on the bed of sickness, in Prison, in strange countries, etc.
where Gods people have powered forth most supplications and groans, God has
revealed himself to them more plentifully and clearly then at any time.

5. The benefits are, The benefits of his ascension.
1. To lead captivity captive. 2. To give gifts to men. 3. To prepare a place
for us. 4. To send his holy Spirit into our hearts. Ephesians. 4. 8.
5. To make intercession for us.

And is on the right hand of God,] John 14. 2.
In general, Three observations in general.
1. He gathers his Church by raising up Christian Kings and Governors, where he
has any Elect. 2. He governs and keeps the same, defeating all subtle plots
of his Enemies, Isa. 49. 23.
and confounding all their devices; Thus did he on the behalf of the Church in
Egypt; Thus also by overthrowing Hamans conspiracy; Thus did he by dissipating
the Spanish Armado, and defeating the Gunpowder Plot. 3. Exercises his Church
with crosses, to scour off the rust, which usually long Prosperity brings
thereon. In Particular, for the Members of his Church that shall be saved, he
gathers them, guides them, and exercises them to obedience by crosses, and
represseth a great part of the rage of their Spiritual Enemies, strengthening
them against the same; and for the Enemies of his Church, he brings confusion
upon them, as on Pharaoh, Senacherib, Haman; Herod, etc. Thus do we also see
many Enemies of Christ's Church daily cut off, what else would become of the
Church?

Angels, and authorities, and powers, etc.] That is, both good and bad, the
good willingly, the others against their will, are subject unto Christ.

1. For the good Angels; The good Angels are subject to Christ.
If such glorious Creatures be subject to Christ, then

1. How great a one is he, Use 1.
and how glorious is his Kingdom? He that has Kings and Princes under him, is
an Emperor; What Is he then, to whom angels, and authorities, and powers, are
subject?

2. The greater honor and dignity our head has, Use 2.
the more joy and comfort may we have, which are his members.

Again, They watch and guard us.
In that he appoints them to watch and guard us, then

1. What a great honor is this to us? as if a plain Country man should dine at
a Noble man's Table, Use 1.
and have great Gentlemen with gold Chains to attend him?

2. How may we hereby be comforted and encouraged against Satan's malice. Use 2.


3. We must keep within compass, Use 3.
and walk carefully in Gods ways: we must take heed we do no uncomely thing,
lest thereby we make the Angels loath to attend on us, or to carry ill tidings
of us to God, or be Messengers of some displeasure against us; They themselves
are very zealous for God, and accordingly look that we should so be.

2. For the evil Angels, The bad Angels are subject to Christ.
I shall not need to speak of their number, power, subtilty, malice,
watchfulness to do hurt, as neither of their office and work, which is to
hinder all good, and further all evil. Note we only, Col. 2. 15.


1. That all these are subject Christ, Use 1.
and he has triumphed over them.

2. That as its no small honor to him our head to have all these under him; Use
2.
so the meditation hereof cannot but be comfortable to us, both in regard of
him and our selves.

3. That those evil Angels cannot do that evil they would, Use 3.
and if they cannot, much less can their instruments; If even the Devils be
subject to him, that they cannot do what they would, much more can he repress
the rage of wicked men, notwithstanding both of their malice and power: But of
these points I have spoken at large by way of Catechism.

CHAP. IV.
THis Chapter consists of three parts: The contents of the Chapter
1. An Exhortation to Sanctification in general, being the common duty of all
Christians, and belonging to all that shall be saved, from Verse 1. to Verse 7.
2. An Exhortation to some particular duties of Sanctification, from Verse 7. to
Verse 12. 3. A comfort against persecution, or an encouragement to the
suffering of affliction for Christ's and Righteousness sake, from thence to the
end of the Chapter.

Verse 1. Forasmuch then as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, arm your
selves likewise with the same mind; for he that has suffered in the flesh,
has ceased from sin: Verse 2. That he no longer should live the rest of his
time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
HEre is 1. An Exhortation, The parts and meaning of these two Verses.
and 2. A motive to persuade thereto: The Exhortation is, to resolve to
mortify and subdue the lusts of our corrupt nature, and to cease from sin;
namely, living in any sin, which is both explained and amplified; explained by
setting forth the parts of Sanctification severally, where is showed, 1. What
must be laid away, the lusts of men; these we must not follow, nor walk in. 2.
What we must do, even walk according to Gods will; amplified by the
circumstance of time, even so much time as remains in this life behind. The
motive to persuade hereto is, For that Christ has suffered for us in the
flesh, namely, in his humane nature, both in body and soul (for that are we to
understand by flesh in the first place; as thereby in the second, the
mortifying of our corrupt nature, or that sinful disposition which is in us,
called flesh, which spreads it self both over our bodies and souls; and in
the third, this natural life of ours, while the soul lives in this body of
ours) for us, not for himself, but our sins; for us, not angels, who are
reserved undereverlasting chains of darkness, but for us men; for us, even me,
and thee (whosoever thou art) that believe; for us, the Apostle himself being
one (for every man must labor to know it to be for him, and the rest of Gods
elect) Forasmuch then, I say, as Christ has suffered for us in the flesh, we
must arm our selves with the same mind, even not only to bear afflictions
patiently, and if it were to suffer persecution for his cause, but also to dye
unto sin, not living any more to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. As
Christ has dyed for sin, so should we dye to sin, and not live in that for
which Christ paid so dearly, and God so hated, and from which we are freed; but
rather in token of our thankfulness for our deliverance, we must labor by all
possible means to mortify these our wicked lusts, and to lead an holy life, to
the glory of our Redeemer. Our Note may be this, That

The passion of our Savior Christ ought to be a mean to mortify our lusts,
Doctr.
and to kill sin in us; The passion of Christ is an especial means to stir us
up unto mortification.
for who can love the knife that killed his dearest friend, or that would have
been his own certain destruction? neither can any man have any persuasion (upon
good grounds) of his part in Christ death, except he dye to sin; for as one end
of Christ's death was to free us from condemnation, Tit. 3. 7.
so another was, to kill sin in us, 2 Cor. 5. 15.
for he purges those whom he redeemeth: He is a perfect Savior and Redeemer,
not setting us free from some, but out of the tyranny of all our enemies,
therefore of sin as well as wrath; again, would Christ dye for a company, and
have no use of them, but leave them still to live in sin?

As therefore we would not live in sin, Use.
let us often meditate on Christ's passion: Romans 8. 7.
O its a fruitful mother of many children! To know that sin is enmity against
God, 1 Pet. 2. 11.
fights against the soul, brings death with it, is not so available to kill
sin, as to know and meditate on this, That

Christ has suffered for us in the flesh] From the necessity of Christ's
sufferings (whereof I have already spoken in the foregoing Chapter) Note,
Observations from the necessity of Christ's suffering.






John 11. 36.
The Jews said, He loved Lazarus well, because he wept for him; much more may
we say, That he loved us, 2 Samuel 18. 33.
because he has dyed for us. David loved Absalom well, who wished that he
might have dyed for him; how much then has Christ loved us, having indeed dyed
for us? O what love do we owe for this so great love?





Christ having suffered, we must also bear afflictions patiently.

Arm your selves likewise, etc. Christians are to labor for mortification.
] The duty whereunto we are exhorted, is to suffer in the flesh, to mortify
our flesh, that is, our corrupt and sinful nature, and the lusts and sins
thereof both inward and outward. But

1. Most are so far from mortifying their lusts, Who do not.
that they follow them with greediness, and cannot endure any to speak against
them: These

2. Some it may be refrain some lusts, but others they live in and

Do we therefore labor for mortification, Use.
applying the edge of the Word of God to the throat of our lusts: That we may
not give way hereto, lets often call to mind the threatenings of the Word, the
Sacraments of Baptism and the Lords Supper, what God offers us there, and what
we convenanted with him for, the crosses which our lusts have drawn on us, Gods
manifold mercies unto us, but especially meditate on Christ's death and passion,
which is indeed a strong corrasive to eat out sin; for our corruptions remain
too rank, and through want of care and too much yielding thereto, be not
subdued as they ought: Let us know, that he is the best Christian, not that
hears most, or knows most, or can utter most, but he that has most power over
his affections and heart. Note further from hence,

That as our lusts fight against us, Christians must furnish themselves as
Soldiers, that they may prevail.
so we must furnish our selves like Soldiers, that we may prevail against them:
Its no easy thing to get out of sin, or to get the Mastery thereof; its to
mortify our members, to pluck out our right eyes, and cut off our right hands:
Its easier to take any pains in offering sacrifice, Isa. 1. 16. and 58. 5.
nay, fast extraordinarily, and to part with our goods, Micah. 6. 7.
with thousands of Rams, and ten thousand rivers of oil, yea, with our first
born, then to part with one beloved sin: Iam. 4. 1.
They that would overcome their lust, must not stand still, or be without
weapons; 1 Pet. 2. 11.
we have that within us which rebelleth against the Law of God, Romans 7. 23.
and would lead us captive to the Law of sin which is in our members: Hereunto
the Devil adds his power, the world also joins herewith, by ill examples, bad
counsels, mockings, revilings, etc. and therefore we must be resolute and play
the Soldiers, if we would get out of our bad course: Through want hereof, some
even under a powerful ministry, be never converted; some get a little way, but
hang behind in sin; some are a great while ere they can get out, whom the Word
having called and awakened, the world, the Devil and their own lusts do again
freshly assault; nay, some being truly converted, yet fall back again into foul
security, and have yet strong corruptions, and many odd qualities, etc.

1. This rebukes most of the world, Use.
who do indeed join with these enemies; few fight against them, but fewer
resolutely, and therefore are led captive of them to their destruction.

2. This may provoke us to put on the whole armor of God, Use 2.
to arm our selves on all occasions, and in all temptations, with good
thoughts, and meditations of the ugliness of sin, Ephesians. 6. 13.
danger of it, its hatefulness to God, with the passion of our Savior Christ: O
how few arm themselves, or when they do, its but to halves? O this must be put
on and kept on continually, night and day, we shall sleep never the worse;
there can be no truce between us and our enemies: This must be kept even in the
times of greatest prosperity. Simile.
Ships usually are cast away in storms, but Christians may miscarry when its
calm. Thus was it with David, he abode constant in all Saul's storms, but in the
time of peace, was carried away with Bathsheba's beauty: It must be kept on
even in our old age, and till death, for then will the Devil set himself most
against us; and both Noah, Moses, and others, did then catch worse foils then
ever before.

Suffered in the flesh, To mortify our corrupt nature, why called suffering in
the flesh
] To mortify our corrupt nature is called suffering in the flesh; and the
truth is, its hard to say, whether is harder to suffer bodily torments and
pains, or to mortify a man's lust: O its a death to part with them; yea, when
in a man after long strife between the grace of God and his corrupt nature, in
the work of his conversion grace prevails, Mark 9. 20.
its even as the pangs of death; as when the Devil went out of the child, he
threw him down, and he lay foaming as if he had been dead: O its not so easy a
matter as the blind and profane world imagine.

Has ceased from sin,] That is, living in any sin, For he that is born of God
sins not; 1 John 3. 8, 9.
and, He that commits sin is of the Devil.

That he no longer, The whole time of our life after our conversion must be
spent holily.
etc.] The whole time of our life that remains after we are called to
repentance, ought to be spent in the service of God, and practice of
Repentance, and a new life: We owe all our life to him, all the days of our
life, the whole time, we owe all to him who has made and preserved us, Luke 1.
75.
nothing to any other: What time therefore we have spent in sin, 1 Pet. 1. 17.
we have robbed God of it, and so ought willingly to give him the remainder,
redeeming that is past with all diligence: The time past we know, but what is
behind we know not how little it may be, and therefore must make use of the
time present, in turning to God and providing for our own souls.

1. This rebukes those that have spent a great part of their life in sin, Use 1.
and yet being called to repentance, cannot afford this remainder to God; as
young men that think it as yet too soon, etc. much more horrible and wicked are
they, that have spent half their life, their young time in pleasures and
vanities, and now are as mad of the world as ever, with whom even yet its too
soon to turn to God.

2. Let this be a provocation unto all sorts to turn unto God: Use 2.
Let young men repent, Psalm. 119. 9.
they be called, and invited hereunto: O now it would be acceptable to God when
their wit is fresh, Eccles. 12. 1.
their memory good, their body and mind able; it would be like Abels
sacrifice: As for old, torn, lame Sacrifices, God has no regard to them: If we
begin betimes, we shall prevent a number of sins, and so a great deal of smart
and sorrow. Besides, we shall learn goodness with much more ease, if God should
from our youth turn our hearts after it: If we delay, we shall thereupon see
not only how wretchedly we have spent our time, and misused our wit, memory
and strength, but how dull we be when we are old, and unfit to learn, it will
much vex us; an old Convert lightly never gets knowledge, and sees but dimly
the way, Mat. 8. 24.
as he that saw men like trees. If one should defer to learn a trade till age,
he might easily perceive that his wit were dull, his fingers and joints stiff:
Let the middle aged repent, nay, let not even the oldest despair, but hasten to
repent, that if possible they may crowd in. Heb. 11. 13.
And for those that have long walked in the ways of God, let them hold out to
the end, do so still; many of Gods servants have been tript in old age, yea,
and then the Devil labors most to entrap them.

Should live in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.] We must
neither live in gross actual sins, wherein most men live, that lust after them,
as a woman longs after a thing when she is with child, nor give way to the
inward corruptions of our hearts, proceeding from that old man, Lusts, Original
sin, concupiscence that is in us; we must not live after the lusts of carnal,
natural and unregenerate men, called in the next Verse, The lusts of the
Gentiles, of which as being enemies to God, and to our own souls, and bringing
death along with them, I have already spoken: Its an argument, that they which
live after them, Gal. 5. 24.
be not Christ's: To those now living after their pleasures, and following their
lusts, it will be said hereafter as to Dives, Luke 16. 25.
Thou have had thy pleasure, as Lazarus pain, now is he comforted, thou
tormented.

But we must live after the will of God; Gods will must be the rule for all our
actions.
To whose will should the servant be obedient, but to his masters, the subject
but to his Princes? God is our master and sovereign: His will also is a most
holy, pure and perfect will, and a rule of righteousness; he requires no
uncomely, no hurtful thing of us, but that which is holy and profitable every
way: The Angels in Heaven, they do the will of God, our Savior came into the
world to do his will: John 15. 10. and 17. 4.
In his passion he had respect hereto, Not my will, but thy will be done, says
he; all the Saints do it, Mat. 7. 21.
and the godly on earth are and ever have been careful hereof, as being a note
of such as shall be saved: All creatures in their kind obey the will of God,
and do that they were appointed for; we are taught to pray, that this may be
done: To do this in all things willingly, Mat. 6. 10.
brings comfort and peace along with it.

1. This rebukes those that will not be brought in subjection to Gods will, but
of all things that's most irksom to them: Who made thee? who gave thee this
comely body and reasonable soul? who has preserved thee? whose will should
thou be subject to? art thou a masterless person? such should be sent to the
house of correction: Whose will do thou follow? what fault find thou with
Gods will? is it a better will which thou followest? O no, its a most corrupt
and sinful will. Use 2.


2. It rebukes those which will be ruled by the will of God in some things
only, and at their pleasure; this is not to do Gods will, but our own: Such
was Pharaohs obedience, Saul's, the Devils: About this there is no small stir in
the world; God would have his will, and men would have theirs; Ministers call
for Gods will, and people will have their own, though they dye for it, say who
will against it: And indeed oftentimes, what is it, but their will that they do
oftentimes? Its against their profit, their credit, prejudicial both to soul
and body: Why do men follow drunkenness and riot, but because they will? This
is the cause why Preaching is so little regarded of most, so much opposed by
many, even because it would set up Gods will, and pull down man's: If any
Preacher shall speak against profaning the Lord's Day, Oh, he is a troubler of
Israel, hinders people from their wills and old wonts: They enquire not what
Gods will is in things, but what their profit and pleasure leads them to; not
what is the way that God would have us increase by, namely, by diligence in our
calling, by equal and righteous dealing, etc. is Gods way asked after and
followed? No, but shorter cuts are sought after, as by deceit, oppression, and
the like; its a sign that such shall never come into Gods Kingdom, every
Creature is better then they, and have a better end except they repent* If they
will have their wills, they must have that belongs to it, they must pay dearly
for them, as many do: Israel would have flesh in the Wilderness, would have a
King as other Nations had; they had their wills, but it had been better for
them they had been without; Ahab would have his will in going to Ramoth Gilead,
he had it, and there perished: God will have his will of such in their
condemnation, as who will resist his Sovereignty, and he will not cease to be a
King, though they refuse to be Subjects? O (considering the filthiness of our
own will, and the the dangers thereof, and the holiness of Gods will, and the
benefit that comes thereby) that we would renounce our own, and follow Gods
will.

3. It rebukes the Servants of God, that be not so careful of the will of God
as they ought: O how often do we suffer our own wills to bear sway, in omitting
many a good duty, or doing it coldly; so in doing that is evil, in wrath,
impatience, worldliness, etc! Its his will that we should forget wrongs, but we
do often nourish and retain them in our thoughts; Its his will that we should
be patient, but we burst out upon small occasions; Its his will that we should
keep holy the Sabbath day, but we do for the most part profane the same:
Herein we do but foolishly, for if we mark it (as we do, if we be of God, and I
speak to such) we have ever checkings of conscience, and smart for it, as peace
in cleaving close to his will: O how often do we lose our comfort, and pull
crosses on our selves?

Note we further from these words, Gods will and men's lusts be opposite each to
other.


1. That to live after the lusts of men and to the will of God, be opposite
each to other; our inward lusts, with the desires and fruits thereof, are
enmity against God, and as contrary to the holy will of God, as light and
darkness, God and the Devil; for the Devil and our corrupt hearts be much
alike: no marvel then if we think so well of our selves, and make so much of
our lusts.

2. That we cannot at one and the same time, No man can at one and the same
time live unto both.
both walk after our lusts, and live to Gods will; or live to Gods will, and
walk but after our lust: God and Satan can never dwell in one heart together,
as neither the love of sin and goodness: This well considered, would discover
some to be in a worse case then they think; they think, seeing they have
renounced many lusts and most sins, and are in many things obedient, one sin is
not so much, but though they love that, they do love God and goodness too.
Deceive not your selves, its impossible it should be so: one lust loved, is
sufficient to prove a man unconverted, sufficient also to condemn him, and all
his other obedience is vain: James 2. 10.
If thou would indeed please God and be saved, renounce the love of every
lust, and walk in obedience to all Gods Commandments.

3. That in the course of Sanctification, Till we renounce our lusts we cannot
be holy.
we must begin at renouncing our own will, and the lusts of men: None sow or
plant, till weeds be pulled up; None put on new apparel, till they have put off
their rags: Simile.
So must we abandon all the love of evil, ere we can entertain any good.

This rebukes the common course of the world, Use.
that set upon goodness, ere they have bid adieu to their lusts; All their
service is abomination before God.

4. That its not sufficient that we do renounce our lusts and evil, Having
renounced our lusts, we must yield obedience to Gods will.
except we yield obedience to the will of God: Thus the Scriptures run, Cease
to do evil, and learn to do well; abhor that which is evil, and cleave unto
that which is good; deny godliness and worldly lusts, and live holily and
soberly, etc. dye to sin, and live to righteousness; put off the old man, and
put on the new; cast off the works of darkness, and put on the armor of light:
Its nothing, or at least but half, if a man has renounced ill company, if he
has not taken up the love of good; Its not for il-doing that men shall be
condemned, but for the not doing good: Matthew. 3. 10.
Every tree that brings not forth good fruit, shall be hewn down, and cast
into the fire. Its not enough we have no disorder in our families, or be no
ryotors, or ill example givers therein, except we take up good orders in stead
thereof; Its not enough we do no hurt, if we do no good: Matthew. 12. 30. and 44.
45.
He that gathers not, scatters; and he that does no good in a Town, does
hurt: An house empty and swept, if it be not garnished with goodness, its fit
to be possessed of Satan again; yet how many think highly of themselves, because
they have done no hurt, have not wronged, oppressed, defrauded any, who yet
have done no good.

5. That its not one action or two, A man's constant course of walking,
discovers what he is.
whereby a man is discovered what he is, but his constant course of walking or
living: The best man may be and is overtaken, as Noah, Lot, David, Peter, doing
according to his own lusts and will, not Gods, but such is not his constant
course; yea, when he does otherwise then is fit, he is grieved, and humbled,
unfainedly repents, and earnestly desires to be more watchful over his own
ways: We must not because of some corruptions conclude against our selves that
we are not the Lords, if in the mean time our hearts bear us witness, that what
we do is contrary to our intent and purpose, our course and drift of life; on
the contrary, its not one good action or two that makes a good Christian, if a
man's course be contrary thereto; for even a Thief will be sometimes in the
Kings highway when its for his advantage, Simile.
whereas usually he keeps in back lanes, and blind ways: Thus many a bad man
will come to hear the word (this is one of Gods ways) but all the day after he
will be in his own course, even lying, swearing, drinking, deceiving, without
any reformation either in heart or life.

Verse 3. For the time past of our life may suffice us, to have wrought the
will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness, lusts, excess of wine,
revellings, banquettings, and abominable idolatries.
HEre are more Reasons to persuade to holiness of life: More Reasons to
persuade unto holiness.
They had already spent a great deal of time in the service of sin, and
following their own lusts, and therefore were not now to continue any longer
therein. Again, whereas before the Gospel they lived in ignorance, now having
the light thereof, another manner of behavior, judgment and practice was looked
for of them.

But one would think a few words might serve to dissuade men from such filthy
lusts, The necessity of frequent Exhortations hereunto.
so odious in themselves, so hateful to God, so harmful to the doers thereof,
and to persuade to holiness of life, so beautiful in it self, so acceptable to
God, and so profitable to those which did seek after the same. True, if we were
as we should be, or as we were in Adam, but we are altogether corrupted and
depraved, and now we have no mind to that which is good, nay, its death and
bonds to us, but that which is evil we eagerly mind and seek after; whereunto
may be added, that hereunto the Devil and the world egg us on, as they hang on
us to hold us back from goodness. Hence it is that so few are converted, that
men count goodness a prison, naughtiness their heaven, that they mock at
goodness, and only except against some men because they are good, whom they
could love for all other things, but for that they hate him.

1. Let us take knowledge of our vile disposition, Use 1.
lets not follow the bent thereof, lest we perish: It misleads us altogether;
let us use all diligence to mortify our lusts, and to strengthen us to good,
for its no easy matter to attain this.

2. Let us be persuaded that there is continual need of preaching, Use 2.
and all other good means to bring this to pass, and not say with most, What
need all this preaching, etc?

3. Let Ministers be most earnest, Use 1.
and labor by all possible means to win men to God; when we have done all that
we can do, we may find by woeful experience, that all is too little: When we
see the holy Ghost going from a matter, and to it again, and dwelling upon it,
and pressing it with manifold reasons, know we, That diligence and carefulness
is required in us about the same.

For the time past of our life may suffice us, etc.] He does not here approve
of their former living, as though that might be born with, or speaks as we do
in a lawful thing, as meat, drink, recreation, etc. Its enough now, leave off:
O this would have been a plausible Doctrine, that men might have taken a time,
till they had had their fill prettily well in sin so they then returned! Our
Apostle has no such meaning, but rather schools them, that the badness of the
time past should humble them, and make them careful to spend the rest better,
and to hasten thereto. Whence thus much may be noted, That

The time past of every man's life misspent, The consideration of our former
misspent time, is an especial furtherance to repentance.
ought to be a great spur to repentance.

Reas. 1. The time spent in sin, we know how much it is, but what is behind we
know not: The Devil is sure of his part, but what God shall have, whether half,
or a quarter so much, is uncertain: If we knew we should live twenty years more
to serve God, Reasons.
as we have done twenty years in sin, God should have but the half, but we
Eccles. 12. 1.
all the days of our life: We must remember our creator, even in the days of
our youth: Therefore having robbed him of some of his due, is it not well he
will take this that remains, and put up that wrong at our hands that is past,
though we add no more? 4. Whatsoever time is spent till we return to God, is
all going

1. This rebukes those youths, that being called on to repentance, yet think
its too soon, and that that is not sufficient which they have done already,
What? Have they not yet spent time enough that way, do they know there is so
much more behind? you would repent ere you dyed, would you not? you would:
Must you not then do it to day, for you know not but that you may dye to
morrow? Have you squandered away already so much precious time, as that some
would even give the whole world for one day thereof, and will ye yet go on in
that course? O do it not, lest God snatch you away suddenly; lest God give you
up unto your hearts lusts, and so ye fulfill the measure of your iniquity!

2. This rebukes also those unreasonable people, Use 2.
as middle aged folks, of forty or fifty years, which are now as deep in the
world and their profits, as before they were in their pleasures, and yet its
not sufficient for them; they can find no time of thinking truly and thoroughly
to turn to God.

3. It rebukes also those that do still defer till toward their end, Use 3.
and then they will turn to God; Is not God much beholding to them? O let these
sluggards know, that poverty will come upon them suddenly and strongly: If they
will needs stay till almost Sunset ere they set out, shall they not with the
Levite and his Concubine be benighted, Judges 19. 15.
and shut out of doors? Their condition shall be the same with the five foolish
Virgins. Matthew. 25. 10.
If a man had a long journey, Simile.
and had gone out of the way all day, till three of the clock in the afternoon,
would he being informed thereof, go on still, and say, When its almost Sun set,
I Will turn into the right way? yet thus does the world: Men defer till they think
they shall dye; then have they to come back all the way of their life, and then
must they lead the contrary good life, and ere they can do this, the night of
death overtakes them, and they be shut out with Dogs and Inchanters, etc. O let
such be wise in time, ere it be too late, and let them think it more then high
time, to turn head, and to ride hard too, to redeem the time! Its past Noon
with many of us, nay, past three of the clock in the afternoon, it draws
toward night with some: O then is it not time for us to draw near to God! Note
further from hence, That

Where God bestows means of Salvation, Where God bestows means of Salvation,
he expects answerable fruit.
he expects fruit answerable; while a place lies wild and common like a Heath,
there can be nothing expected but Briars and Thorns; but if it be paled in, and
dug and planted, then may fruit be expected therefrom: when a people want
the means, See Isaiah 5. 1.
especially the Gospel, what can be looked for at their hands? Luke 8. 7.
having it, their life and conversation must be answerable. See Romans 13. 12.
Ephesians. 4. 17. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 5. and 5. 4.

1. This discovers the woeful state of this Land, Use 1.
which so abounds in iniquity, notwithstanding the clear light of the Gospel
amongst us: Our sins are more then in times of Popery, then among Turks and
Pagans: Our Saviors woes denounced against Chor azin and Bethsaida may well fit
us, it shall be easier for them, then for us: Do we so requite the Lord? bring
we forth nothing but sour Grapes? Assuredly, were it not for an handful, for
some small remnant yet left amongst us, we might have looked to have been ere
this as Sodom and Gomorrah; our wine being as theirs, Heb. 6. 8.
for our sin is as theirs: Most are like that ground which bears thorns and
briars, whose end is to be burned; the means they have, will but increase their
sin and damnation.

2. This rebukes many whose fruit is nothing meet for him by whom they be
dressed, Use 2.
we live not as if we were in the noonday, but in the twy-light; Phil. 1. 27.
our conversation is not such as becomes the Gospel.

3. For such as have received special favor from God, Use 3.
and made their Covenant with him of true obedience, they must walk far
otherwise then the men of the world: They must not be covetous, as they that
know no better inheritance then the world: they must not be proud, as they that
know no better garments then these rags and clouts, being altogether ignorant
of Christ's righteousness: So we must not talk of worldly matters on the
Lord's Day, as heretofore; we must not spend our time in gaming, John 14. 17.
sport, or too much merryment, or idleness, as before: If we be guided by the
Spirit of God, which the world knows not, let us show it by our fruits; and
so much as we hope to differ from them in our latter end, so let us differ now.

To have wrought the will of the Gentiles,] This is not meant of every
particular person of the Jews that were written to in this Epistle, that they
thus walked as the Gentiles, and it may be some of the Gentiles were restrained
and lived soberly; but this he understands of the body of them both.

But how came they to live after the lusts of the Gentiles? They lived amongst
them, and so became as bad as they. Whence note, That

Bad company is very dangerous; Bad company is very dangerous.
Solomon forbids it, and so does St. Paul; David also clears himself of it, he
could not away therewith: See Prove. 1. 10. See Downham Spirit. War. cap. 17.
part 2.
and 23. 20. and 24. 1. 2 Cor. 6. 17. Psalm. 26. 4. and 119. 63, 115. In the Law
its forbidden to touch a thing unclean, as a dead corpse: Luke 7. 21.
This did morally signify meddling with sin and sinners: Using bad company we
can neither keep a good course, nor a good conscience; we shall quickly learn
their evils, we being apt scholars hereto, and our nature like tinder and
gunpowder readily set on fire. None can walk in the Sun but shall be tanned,
Simile.
nor touch pitch but he shall be defiled, nor be in a Mill but he shall be
dusted, nor dwell with a Collier but he shall be smutted; so cannot any
frequent the company of wicked men, but he shall be harmed hereby; yea, how can
any converse with such, and not be accessory to their sins (at least through
their untimely silence, not reproving or admonishing them for the same) and so
consequently partaker of their plagues.

O then, Use.
as we would avoid the company of those that have the plague, lest we be
infected thereby, so lets shun the company of those which are tainted with foul
sins, 2 Cor. 6. 17.
lest destruction come upon us: The Lord calls upon us to come out and depart
from such; 1 King. 22. 32.
Jehoshaphat escaped narrowly with his life for being with Ahab, and
questionless not a few have smarted for being familiar with the wicked.
Lasciviousness and lusts, what they are and how common.


When we walked in laciviousness, lusts,] Hereby is meant all sorts of
uncleanness, and the provocations thereto, as fidling, dancing, mixed sports of
men and women, filthy talking, ribald jesting, unclean songs, lewd ballads,
whorish apparel, idleness, etc. These are so common, that its even a death to
people to be held from them; we can scarce see a young man or woman in whom some
one or other flag of wantonness hangs not out; Are not these works of
darkness? shall such inherit the Kingdom of Heaven? O that the disorder of such
were pulled down, and that they would in time repent of their wantonness and
lusts, which will else cost them full dear one day, and was never so sweet, but
it will prove as bitter.

Excess of wine,] Another lust of the Gentiles which we are to avoid, the
immoderate use or rather abuse of wine and strong drink: Wine is the good
creature of God, made for good use, and God has given us liberty to use the
same, and that both ordinarily (according to our ability, See Psalm. 104. 15.
so as it may be for the health of our bodies, and strengthening the same the
better to serve God in his worship, Prove. 31. 6.
and our callings, 1 Timothy 5. 23.
and in time of weakness of body or mind) and extraordinarily, as in times of
great and solemn rejoicing; so of thanksgiving to God for deliverances and
mercies, and at marriages, or such meetings of friends, wherein not only what is
for necessity is allowed, but also what is for delight, and so a more liberal use
thereof then at other times; yet even then, moderation and christian sobriety
must be retained; John 2. 10.
we must no further make use of wine, but as thereby we may be fit to praise
God, Drunkenness an abominable sin.
or otherwise to do good: But the excessive use of it to drunkenness is
abominable, and often prohibited. Besides, its not only odious to God, Isaiah
5. 22.
and so all good men, but its even vile in the eyes of the Heathen, Luke 21. 34.
insomuch that they have made many severe Laws against the same, Ephesians. 5. 18.
and uttered many excellent sayings against it: It puts God as it were ou^ of
place, and makes one's belly his God, for that he serves more then God, cares
for it, seeks to please it more then God, nay, to satisfy it, he cares not to
dishonor God; Its also a wicked abuse of Gods benefits, and a means to dishonor
him, which ought to allure us to love and serve him, it makes a man also unfit
for Gods service; we be unfit at the best, but when the head and heart are
oppressed with drink, we are then as blocks and beasts, unfit for any good work
in Church or Commonwealth, unfit to govern or be governed, Lev. 10. 9.
unfit to follow our Callings, yea, unable to cover our own nakedness, Prove.
31. 5.
as it was with Noah. Psalm. 69. 12.
Hence it is, that Magistrates and Ministers, whose callings are of greatest
use and necessity, do flatly forbid it; it makes a man also fit for all evil,
as to swagger, swear, curse, rail, mock; to talk filthily, to scoff at
Religion, and the Servants of God; to commit whoredom, (as Lot) to quarrel,
fight, stab, kill, (daily experience showing most frays proceeding from the
pot) to thrust their wives out of doors, beat their Children, play the mad men,
fill all places with filthy vomiting, etc. Its reported, that one being tempted
to whoredom, murder, and drunkenness, and thinking that he must needs yield to
one of them, for that adultery was dishonorable and dangerous, and murder most
odious and fearful, he gave way to the third, which was drunkenness, but then
when he was drunk, fell into both the other; for having committed folly with
another man's wife, the husband coming in, he killed him. This puts out the eye
of the soul, and takes away the use of Reason for a time, even that whereby a
man differs from a beast, and indeed, makes a man, so that being drunk, See
Pro. 23. 35.
he knows neither what he does, nor what is done to him, as it fared both with
Noah and Lot: For a man to cut or hurt his own flesh, were bad, but to hurt the
principal part, the soul, how dangerous is it? That were but as if one should
kill a Subject; this, as if he did take the Prince, and bind him hand and
foot, and turn him out of his place of Government: Who would put out his bodily
eyes? but too too many do thus put out the eyes of their soul. This disguiseth
the body, which is Gods workmanship, and comely, and ought to be preserved in
holiness and honor, 1 Cor. 6. 13.
and kept as a Temple for the holy Ghost, and makes it the stye of the Devil:
From hence are red eyes, an inflamed face, a swollen body, the hands quiver, the
feet reel and stagger; yea, it not only disguiseth, but endangereth it; it
dulls the wit, spoils the memory, breeds diseases, Dropsies, Imposthumes,
Palsies; oppressing and drowning the natural heat before the time (as a Lamp
with too much oil, Simile.
or a candle thrown into the water, ere it be half burnt) and so bringing
untimely death: They that are addicted hereunto, are self-murtherers, and
though they had need to prolong their lives while they can, Hosea 4. 18.
unless they were fitter for death, yet do they long as it were, and hasten to
be in Hell: This is a stinking sin both to God and all good men; Its a wicked
abuse of Gods Creatures, appointed to be received with prayer and thanksgiving
to the glory of the giver thereof; 1 Timothy 4. 4.
Its a wasting of the portion which God has given us, whereby we might live
comfortably, and do much good to others in Church and Commonwealth: O how many
do hereby squander all away, rob Church, Commonwealth, Poor, yea, their own
Families, their Wives portions, and Childrens Patrimony, all going down their
throat! 1 Timothy 5. 8.
What cruel murderers be these? If he that provides not for them is worse then
an Heathen, then what is he that having already wherewith to maintain them,
thus pulls it as it were from them? This also is a wicked mispending of our
precious time; This brings infamy and reproach with God and men; This brings
beggary along with it: many having spent all on strong drink in their youth,
are fain to drink water in their age; This has woe, sorrow, and wounds
attending thereon: Prove. 23. 29.
Many in their drunkenness have been stabbed, as others have come to the
gallows for that they have done in their drink; yea, custom and continuance
herein, breeds not a delight only, but from thence another nature, and a kind
of necessity upon the body, that they cannot leave it; they swallow not the
wine so much, as the wine swallows them up, and they are buried in wine, and as
unfit for any good, See Deuteronomy. 21. 20.
as one that is buried, to do the work of a living man. Hereunto may be added,
Isaiah. 5. 22.
that as there are fearful judgments threatened against this, 1 Cor. 6. 10.
both in respect of this, and the life to come (for the cup of the fierceness
of Gods wrath is prepared for such to drink to the bottom, and the full Vials
of his judgments will be poured out upon them eternally) so amongst others,
this is the main, that they seldom or never repent: I have known some touched at
the Word because of this, weep for it, promise, yea, vow against it, who have
yet again fallen into company, and could never get out.

1. If this be so horrible a sin, Use 1.
what shall we say to the Land wherein it is grown to such an horrible height,
and to abound in such a fearful sort? It was wont to be the sin of other
Countries, now we have got it, and may we not boast of our gettings, think ye?
It was wont to be rare, but is now common in all places; wont to be done in a
corner, and the parties ashamed thereof, now it staggers abroad in the open
streets, none being ashamed of the same; wont to be the sin of base ones,
according to the Proverb, He is as drunk as a beggar, but now its the sin of
Gentlemen, and herein our Yeomens sons exceed, Acts 2. 15.
to the wasting of their Revenues: St. Peter's argument were now a very slender
one, for men rise early to drink strong drink; yea, men are now grown into such
an horrible height of impiety, as that they labor and strive to excel therein;
they get Beer of extraordinary strength, and call it by names, Snapdragon, and
(which is most horrible Blasphemy) Hosanna in the highest, etc. drink by the
yard, by the dozen, in pails, in crooked horns that cannot be set down, make
matches who shall drink each other drunk under the Table: O fearful! Is this
the fruit of the Gospel, and of this peace and light? Its indeed a work of
darkness, though it abounds in the light of the Gospel, a lust of the Gentiles,
and so not beseeming Christians: Do we marvel at unseasonable Weather, at
Famine, and Scarcity, etc? we may rather wonder at Gods patience: And were it
not that our Governors and the chief of the Land have taken it to heart, and
Enacted good Laws to suppress it, both by prescribing a penalty upon it, and
preventing it by diminishing of Alehouses, the sinks of all disorder and
mischief, and by forbiding excessive strong Beer, and enjoining a moderate size
thereof, etc. We might have looked for some notable judgment of God; but when
men of authority take sin to heart, and seek to punish the same, then God takes
it well, and is pacified: Contrarily, when Magistrates have not grace and
courage to put life into his Laws, by the due execution of Justice, the Lord is
enforced to take his rod into his own hand.

2. This condemns those which are addicted unto this sin of drunkenness; Use
2.
What? Think they that God gave them their souls and bodies, their goods,
health, wealth, his good creatures, and their precious time to use thus? has
he bestowed on them the days of the Gospel, that they should make themselves
Beasts, unfit for any good^ what answer and account think they to make to
Almighty God for these things? They may justly fear some notable judgment from
God to be inflicted on them, as of late there has been on diverse, and do not
these things affright you? dare you go on in the like? were they not sent for
your admonition, and to be warnings unto you? Awake therefore you Drunkards,
and howl, humble your selves on the knees of your soul, confess your horrible
wickedness to Almighty God, cry for mercy and pardon, and if it be possible,
turn from this base vice, renounce, hate, detest, vow, covenant, swear against
it, pray also to be kept therefrom, avoid all company of lewd ones, which will
either by flattery allure you, or if you yield not to them, reproach and mock
you: But what do I speak to them that have lost their wits, Is there any hope
of repentance for such? Well, yet nothing is impossible to God, The harder it
is, labor the more, and weep and lament for that is past, redeem the time to
come, give your souls and bodies to please God in all good life and sober
conversation; you have spent your goods and time hereon, do so no more: If thou
wiltst not be persuaded, but go on still and hate to be reformed, thou may
look for some one or other dreadful judgment to be here inflicted on thee, and
at thy death to be cast into utter darkness, who have wallowed in the works of
darkness, See Psalm. 75. 8.
and for thy drunkenness to drink off the full cup of Gods judgment for ever
and ever.

Neither are common drunkards only to be rebuked, but such also as will now
and then drink with their friends, and sit so long talking and bibbing, or
gaming and drinking, that they be caught, and are scarce wise enough to find
the way home; they may count themselves wise men, Prove. 20. 1.
but Solomon says nay to it; they shall not be counted innocent.

Nor are those only to be condemned that be so drunk as they be like beasts,
but even such as take delight to quaff and to carouse, and spend their time in
swilling, having yet strong brains to bear it, and herein they glory that they
can drink others under-board, and because they be never so drunk, but they can
carry it away, therefore they think themselves no such persons, but they are as
bad drunkards, and as guilty as the other; they waste as much time, as much
wine or strong drink as the others; they waste also their substance, and
delight in this course, nay, happily they drink much more then the others, for
some are so weak brained that a little t^rns them over: Isaiah 5. 22.
There Is a woe denounced against such, their brain was not given them for this
end, but for the service of God; they should prove their strength in good
things, and strive to exceed others in goodness, not in dishonoring God by
abusing his Creatures.

There are also that delight to see others drunk, that allure or enforce them
so to do; to delight herein, how horrible is it? how ill a sign? no child can
delight to hear or see his father misused, he is else a bastard, not a son:
Gods Children delight in his Commandments, in his Sabbaths, in his Saints, in
the public performance of his worship; Psalm. 112. 1
contrarily, they are grieved and vexed (as David and Lot) at the dishonor
which is done unto him; Isaiah 58. 13.
so are not the wicked, but God will laugh at their destruction, Psalm. 16. 3.
and 122. 1. and 119. 143.
and mock when their fear comes; when judgment comes, those mourners for sin
shall escape; when as these rejoycers therein shall not go unpunished, 2 Pet. 2.
8.
and who indeed could laugh to see a man running on his own sword, Prove. 1. 26.
or casting himself in the fire? Ezekiel. 9. 4.


To make others drunk, enticing them hereto, and to this end, under color of
kindeness to drink to them often, as is usual in Gentlemen's Butteries, and
Cellars, in Inns, and Taverns, etc. where men will be at great cost to dishonor
God, this also is fearful; these be zealous Servants of the Devil: But if one
should allure another to go in such a way, where he were sure to fall into a
pit, or be drowned, or be robbed, etc. would not every one cry out of such a
treacher? no less treacherous are those which make others drunk: We are willed
indeed to provoke each other to love and good works, to call one another to the
house of God, to exhort and edify one another, but in no sort to destroy one
another, as those allurers and enticers do.

To compel others to drink till they be drunk, or to drink more then they can
bear, is usual; to refuse, is accounted of sundry ruffians in our days, a
matter of great disgrace, which they will not put up, and therefore stab, or
challenge to the field, those that will not drink as many and as big carouses
as they that have begun them: What inhumanity is this? what folly? has nature
made all alike? can one of low stature reach as high as he that is far taller?
can a weak man bear as heavy a burden as a strong man? Besides, what greater
wrong, then to force a man to do that which will hinder his health, shorten his
life, wound his conscience, and destroy his soul? But especially what an
outrageous wickedness is this against God? cannot we our selves be content to
do wickedly, but as ringleaders we must enforce others? whosoever escape, such
traitors shall not: What woeful wretches are those? have they not sins enough of
their own to answer for, but they must needs desperately pull other men's sins
on their heads, whereof they themselves are the principal cause? For those, See
Heb. 2. 15, 16.
they shall answer on that dreadful day: Against such shall Ahasuerus his
injunction (though an Heachen) rise up for their condemnation. Hest. 1. 8.


Its the duty of all those which as yet are free from this sin, Use 3.
to be truly thankful to God, for keeping them therefrom; They must also
endeavor for the time to come to avoid the same, with all the occasions
inducing thereto. God gives us his benefits to provoke us to well-doing, we
must not use them to sin, like the Mastiffs, that flies in his face that gives
him meat: Wiltst thou so foully dishonor God? shall thy body and soul appointed
for Gods service, be for the service of the Devil in this base sin? Wiltst thou
thus make thy self unfit for any good, in danger to run into any evil? Wiltst
thou so disguise thy self, as to make thy self a scorn? so abuse Gods
creatures, to hazard thy health, bring diseases and untimely death on thy self?
Wiltst thou so wound thy conscience, and provoke the Lords judgments against
thee here and hereafter? O God forbid. Be earnest always with God to keep thee,
see the ugly face of sin, think of the judgments denounced, and lighted upon
many that are past help; how pleasant soever it be at the first, in the end it
will bite like a Serpent. Fly from Alehouses and Taverns, as from infected
houses, think it an odious disgrace to be seen in any such house, except in
travel, See Prove. 4. 4.
or for necessity; flee the company also of such as are addicted to this vice,
as infectious and dangerous, together with their enticements and provocations;
follow also your calling diligently, whereby both this and other sins may be
prevented, together with the judgments due thereto.

4. Its the duty of all those which are in Authority, Use 4.
to set themselves against this sin, whether Ministers, Magistrates, or others;
they should disdain that this outward and base sin should thus insult and
prevail, and Goliah-like defy the host of Israel: O if we had David's spirit,
to set upon it and knock it down; it would be easily done, if all would join
hands: But whereas some have put down Alehouses, other Justices to gratify
some friends, have set them up again, and are so cold and remiss herein, that
few drunkards come to any punishment: Belike they have no leisure, no zeal for
God, neither will afford him any help against the mighty: But though these and
their Officers were faulty, yet if householders would bestir themselves, Judge.
5. 23.
and put on Joshua and David's resolution, the number of drunkards would not be
so great as it is; Josh. 24. 25.
but if one put away such a servant, Psalm. 101. 4.
another is presently ready to entertain him: O what a goodly Church and
Comon-wealth should we have, if householders would do their duties thoroughly!

Revellings,] (Gluttony) This is an abuse of our meat; God of his abundant
mercy has left us the use of his Creatures, and that not herbs only, as before
the flood, but the beasts, fishes, fowls, etc. mavelous varieties out of his
three great storehouses, and that not only for necessity, but also for
delight, as well in the plenty as variety of them: Those he has appointed us
to receive in due time, measure, and manner, with thanksgiving in a sober and
temperate sort, as becomes Christians: Contrary hereto is the sin of gluttony,
which is committed in respect of the quality, Gluttony how committed, with the
odiousness thereof
quantity and time.

For quality; namely, when people be too nice, curious and dainty in their
fare, and are never satisfied herewith, and give themselves to devise new found
dishes, cates, and sawces, so fulfilling the lusts of their flesh; a common
fault in great Towns and Cities: Most are a great deal more careful herein,
then to please God; and more angry if it be not to their tooth, then for any
sin against God; Its good to have things cleanly and wholesome, but not curious:
There are some also that this way exceed their ability, being too much given to
bellycheer, whereby want creeps upon them and theirs; men and women must be
content, and do as they may: Some will not be restrained by the Civil
Magistrates command, but even in their health will follow their appetite,
whereas we ought to obey the Magistrates commandment (our health giving us
leave) for conscience sake; Romans 13. 1.
Conscience, I say, not of the meat (that were a Doctrine of Devils) but of the
commander, whom we ought to obey.

For the quantity; when men exceed measure, and eat more then does them good,
or makes them fit for the business God sets them about: there are some beastly
monsters, that of set purposee at in a bravery more then two or three men, yea,
for a wager will eat so much; a goodly glory (to their shame) wherein a hound
will match them, some such God has branded: Others there are that at feasts
and such times forget themselves, and by variety of meats are beguiled; this is
the fault of feast-makers, occasioners of gluttony, who provide too excessively
and curiously, costly and dainty dishes, when men are filled with wholesome and
sufficient food before; Its good there should be plenty according to every man's
ability, that so the poor may be remembered, and some variety too to show Gods
bounty, and because all love not alike, but overmuch costliness is not meet;
That which in the end of feasts is oftentimes wastfully spent, would go a great
way with the poor, and much comfort them, if the charges were employed this
way: But many that stand not at many shillings this way, would grudge at as
many pence to give to the poor; Its a good feast where the poor are remembered:
Luke 14. 13.
Its also a great fault in Guests to be tolled on further then is meet, See
Prove. 23. 1, 2.
whatsoever provocations there be; they hereby hurt both their bodies and
souls: But especially those are blame worthy, that make the Sabbath day a
Feasting-day, quite contrary to all good order and reason; that is a Feasting
day for the soul, but if the body be overmuch pampered, the soul shall fare the
worse: we are therefore sparingly to eat that day, especially till night, as
being to go about spiritual duties, whereunto we are so unfit, in the
performance whereof, through excess of food, we become sleepy, and drowsy,
which is most unseemly and wicked in Gods service; therefore as when we serve
God extraordinarily, we fast altogether; so when ordinarliy, we must be very
temperate and sparing.

For the time; It must not be at unseasonable hours, as either too soon, before
men have done God some service, or been about some good business, See Eccles.
10. 16, 17.
nor so late, as when men should be at rest, such banquettings, junkettings,
and late Suppers, be not for strength, but for lust; sundry servants be wanton
in this kind, watching their unseasonable times, when their masters and dames
be forth or asleep; This, as its a sin in it self, so does it many times bring
on other wickednesses.

Wherein we have offended either way, Use.
lets repent, making conscience for the time to come: O what woeful Creatures
are we that cannot tell (as wise as we think our selves) what, how much, or
when to eat, Gods Word must be our rule, and we must suffer our selves in all
things to be guided thereby.

Banquettings] (Drinkings) that is, needless, excessive or untimely bibbings,
when there is no cause; This is here condemned as a lust of the Gentiles,
because else they that are addicted hereto, would have been at defiance with
them that had spoke against this, and told them they were not drunk, might do
thus and thus: Many upon every idle occasion be bibbing and sucking, and love
to sit with the pot in their hand, telling a tale, and then they think
themselves as wise as a great Counselor: But do they become hereby more fit
for Gods service? Does this tend to Gods glory? nay, hereby become they not
often drunk ere they be aware?

To stir you up to sobriety, Means stirring up to sobriety.
1. Find that you have right to the Creatures, else you can have no comfort in
the use of them, but shall answer for them: Carry your evidences to the Lords
Lawyers, who What Idolatry is.


Abominable idolatries,] This is a sin aginst the first Table, forbid in the
first and second Commandments, though most in the second: Its either inward or
outward, and its either the worshipping of false gods, or the true God in a
false manner, both which are most detestable and abominable before God, and
therefore to be hated of us in a deadly manner, as that which is the flat breach
of the marriage Covenant between God and his people; Its a turning our heart
from God, a forgetting, yea a forsaking of God, a setting up another in his
stead, who will have no partners: Hereunto we are naturally prone, as may be
seen throughout all ages; even those that know the true God in some sort, set
up something before him to worship him in and by: Hereof the Israelites were
wonderfully guilty; though they had many strict charges against it, yet they
were woefully carried away with the Idolatries of the Heathen; sometimes they
did worship the very gods of the Heathens, as Baalim and Ashtaroth, etc. and at
the best, they used to worship God in Images, as in the golden Calf that Aaron
made, and in the two Calves at Dan and Bethel, for those the Prophets did
vehemently reprove them, and threaten Gods judgments against them, which
accordingly were inflicted on them, as appears this day: and if when they lived
in their own Land they were so tainted with idolatry, what were they now,
having so long conversed with those profane Heathens? This therefore the
Apostle warns them now to leave and abandon, as having already continued too
long therein, and having repented thereof, he would not have them go back
thereto any more.

I shall speak a little here of the Idolatry of the Heathens, of the Idolatry
of the Papists, and of the Idolatry of our own people, all which are either in
worshipping a false god, or the true God in a false manner.

For the worshipping of false gods; Idolatry in worshipping false gods.
so did the Heathens, who worshipped the Sun, Moon, and the host of Heaven,
yea, any thing what soever, and according to their countries were their gods,
nay, they had their city and country gods, and household gods: There was no end
of their abominations, Psalm. 115. 2.
having this in their heart, that there was a God, and not knowing him, Isa.
44. 9.
they worshipped any thing, which the Lord does deride, Hab. 2. 19.
and whereat he is angry, for he will not give his glory to another, nor his
praise to graven Images. O what cause have we to bless the name of God that
have the light of the Word, whereas most throughout all ages have been ignorant
thereof, and so worshipped they know not what, and worshipped not only in
vain, without any profit, but to the dishonor of the true God, and their own
condemnation: Neither is this the sin of Heathens alone to worship false gods,
but even of the Papists, who have the Word for their Rule, whose sin therefore
is greater then the Heathens; they worship the breaden god, they bow down to
it, and call it their Maker, what difference is then between them? See Isa. 44.
17.
as those fell a Tree, and with some part make a fire, with some bake, and of
some make a god and worship it; so these sow Corn, reap it and grind it, and
of some part thereof make bread for themselves and theirs, and of another they
make a god which they worship; they also worship the Cross, and Relics of
Saints; they also worship the Virgin Mary, calling on her oftener then on God;
so they worship Saints and Angels, their Pictures also be common, whereunto
they give Divine worship, they dedicate Altars, Offerings, Temples, Priests and
Days to them, which are proper to God only; yea, they make the Pope (that Man
of Sin) a god, not only calling him so, but ascribing that to him which is
proper to God, as, To make Laws to bind the Conscience, to open and shut
Heaven, Hell and Purgatory, as they say, to forgive sins, to add and take from
the Scriptures, etc. O horrible! What King will endure his Royalty to be given
to another? If Angels and Saints were to appear to us, as they were wont
formerly, we ought not otherwise to worship them but with civil worship (the
excellency of the Creature does not change the kind of worship, but only the
measure) but now seeing they appear not to us, we owe them no worship at all,
but only to reverence them, and thank God for them, and imitate them in what
we can. Rev. 22. 9.
The Angel would not suffer John to worship him, Acts 14. 14.
and the Apostles Peter, Paul and Barnabas refused also that to ^ob God of his
due.

For worshipping the true God in a false manner, Idolatry in worshipping the
true God after a false manner, whether Inward* or
it is either inward or outward:

Inward, as when we conceive in our mind otherwise of God then he is, and has
revealed himself, as to conceive of God without consideration of the three
Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, as do the Turks and Jews, and they
amongst our selves, which conceive that God is only merciful, and not just; so
to conceive of Christ as God only, or man only, and not as God and man in one
person: The Papists though in word they profess either, yet in deed they deny
both, and so make an idol, and no true Christ of him.

Outward, Outward.
as when men worship God in Images, Stocks, Sons, Pictures of gold, silver,
stone, graved, or painted, or howsoever: This is flatly forbid in the 2d
Commandment, as also in diverse other places. To make a Picture of God like an
Oldman, or of Christ like a Man hanging on a Cross, what lies be they? Be these
like God? not so like as a Fly is, or as a Fly is to a King.

Ob. But God so appeared in Daniel. Dan. 7. 9.


A. What then? it follows not we may so picture him, especially seeing he
has forbid it: Is the picture of a man like Christ? His Godhead is the
chiefest part of him, how picture they that? O they do it in a good meaning;
but our intention is not the rule of Gods Worship, but his own will: As for
their shift, that they worship not the Image, but God in the Image, its indeed
a mere shift, that will not serve their turn; so said some of the Heathens, so
said the Israelites; assuredly God is displeased with both.

Let us therefore detest Popery, Use.
as being abominable before God, let us never be drawn to their Religion, for
its to renounce God, and quite break the Covenant: Join not at any time with
Papists in their Idol-service, bow not the knee to Baal, come out from among
them, and touch no unclean thing; let neither Fear, Covetousness, or wanton
curiosity to see new fangles, draw you aside, for ye cannot be partakers of the
table of the Lord and of Devils: Have no Society with them for marriage; Joram
and Ahaziah were bad, for that they married into Ahabs stock: Have no league of
Amity with them, to have common friends and enemies, as to help them against
their enemies, or crave their help against ours.

There be some that speak minsingly of the Religion of Rome, as that there be
indeed sundry differences between them and us, but that they are petty and mean
ones, and of no great moment, but such, as if we would yield a little, and they
a little, there might be a reconciliation made: Woe be to such dawbers, that
would go about to reconcile God and the Devil, Light and Darkness, etc. There
are sundry differences which are main ones, and against the foundation, and
such as except they will renounce, we neither can, nor must ever join with
them. So of the Papists themselves, some will speak very favorably, O they be
good honest men, and many good things they do, if it were not a little for
their Opinions, etc. Do such speak wisely? they be abominable persons, for they
be Idolaters (and those God calls abominable) worshipping other Gods, and the
true in a false manner, namely, in Images: If they were Murderers, and would
take away our lives; Adulterers, and would abuse our wives; Thieves, and would
take away our goods, O we would cry out upon them, and say, They be abominable;
but we have no feeling of any thing which hurts our souls, nor of that which is
foully against God and his glory; its an Argument of self love and little
grace: It should go more to our hearts, that its against GOD and his glory,
then any thing that were against our selves any way: We ought to pray to God to
convert them or remove them, and that they may be curbed, and their eyes may
fail ere they have their desire of Toleration of their abominable Religion.

For the Idolatry among our selves: The several sorts of Idolaters amongst our
selves.
Some conceive of God, as of a God only merciful, and not just; which
emboldens them to go on in their sins without fear or care, supposing that when
they have abused him at their pleasure all their days, if in the end they utter
but a few* good words to him, he will be as well pleased, as if they had served
him all their time: This is to conceive an Idol, and not God; for he is as just
as merciful, the one no more then the other. Sundry also among us make a god of
their Belly, Profits, Pleasures, Honor, Children, Ease, etc. seeking only
these, setting their heart and delight in these, trusting in these, yea, to
compass these, not caring though they offend God; for whatsoever a man loves
more then God, or trusts in besides God, he makes it his god: Thus the glutton
makes his Belly, as the covetous man his Wealth, his god; O vileness, and
extreme baseness! We that live under the Word preached, should learn to know
God to be All-sufficient, and to labor to make him our portion and inheritance,
our joy and our castle: He that has God, has all; he that wants him, in the
midst of all has nothing. Psalm. 33. 12.
Blessed is the people (so the person) whose God is the Lord (not who are
wealthy, have great friends, etc.) and who accordingly love him above all, set
him up in their hearts, trusting in him only, satisfying themselves in him,
yea him alone, and loving all other things in, and for, and under him. Others
there are that profess Religion, and worship God indeed, but in a false manner;
they pray, but depart not from iniquity; hear the Word, but hate to be
reformed; are baptized, but keep no Covenant; receive the Lords Supper, but
without Knowledge, Faith and Repentance; but God he is a Spirit, and therefore
will be worshipped in Spirit and Truth: They that worship him as most do, they
worship an Idol, namely, Such a God as is content with the outside, with
Ceremonies, but so is not the true God; the service of such is abominable,
against such judgments have been both denounced and inflicted; See 1 Samuel 15.
23. Psalm. 50. 16. Isa. 1. 11. and 58. 5. Jer. 7. 4. Ezekiel. 14. 33, 27. Mic. 6.
7. Our outward worshipping of God must proceed from our inward Knowledge, Love,
Fear, and Trust in God, and must be joined with obedience and Reformation: Hos.
6. 6.
If thou repentest not of thine Hypocritical service, thy wages will be
according to thy work: This makes Gods enemies speak ill of our Religion, and
hold off, even because (though indeed we worship God, and profess well, yet our
peoples lives be so far wide) we that enjoy the Gospel, and the true means of
the right knowledge and service of God, ought not to worship the true God
only, but in a right manner. What though we be not Idolaters, we cannot almost
be so though we would, yet we may, and without repentance shall certainly
perish, for our ceremonious and Hypocritical serving of God: and so much the
rather, because we had the means to bring us to the true knowledge of him,
which is denied to the common sort of the Papists: Assuredly we shall lose all
our labor, if we use it to no better purpose, and our souls too among the
Hypocrites.

Verse 4. Wherein they think it strange that you run not with them to the same
excess of riot, speaking evil of you.
Here Is the prevention of an Objection: The prevention of an Objection.
If we should now break off, might some say, and no longer live as we have
done, but take the course that you prescribe, we should be wondered at as an Owl
among Birds: They would think strangely of us, as of fools and mad folks, and
hate us, and speak evil of us, that we should not be able to abide it: Others
also might say, We which have followed your counsel, have made our selves a
gazing stock, and pulled all men upon our tops; even those that liked us well
before, speak ill of us, and what we shall do, we know not: The Apostle
Answers, I know it is so with some of you, and will be so with the rest, but
be not dismayed, for (as its set down in the following Verse) they shall answer
for this wickedness at the time which God has appointed, when we shall receive
the Crown of glory for our well-doing, and constant continuance therein.

In this Verse note, 1. The mind of the wicked toward Gods children, their
course seems strange to them. 2. The effect hereof in their words, They speak
evil of them. 3. The ground or reason hereof, For that they run not with them
into the same excess of riot.

Wherein they think it strange] Hence note, that

Such as mean to renounce their sins, Such as live holily shall meet with
opposition.
and take an holy course, shall find much opposition, undergo the hatred and
ill will of most. Lot was wondered at in Sodom, as doubtless the old world
wondered at Noah for making the Ark, and Pharaohs Courtiers at Moses his choice,
Michol mocked and despised David in her heart when he danced before the Ark,
Nebuchadnezzar wondered that the three children refused to bow to his Image
which others did, Festus thought Paul mad; In time of Popery they wondered at
the Martyrs, that they would not at some times yield a little, as to speak a
few words, etc. Thus it is now (for the world lives still, and is like it self)
If any dare not play or riot, or talk of the world on the Lords Day, they are
thought to be mopish fools, who had rather be poring on a book, then doing as
others: If any care not to get by Lying, Deceiving, and the common ways of the
world, they are wondered at as fools; so if any now and then omit some of their
businesses, and go to hear the Word, they are accounted idle (as Pharaoh said
to the Israelites) and such as have little to do: If any be humbled for their
sins, they think them melancholy, and that they will be out of their wits, and
they would not be in their case for no good, and would have them be merry, and
play it away. If any at the hearing of the Word, perceiving it to be high time
to forsake his old wont, and take a better course, now dare not do as he has
formerly, they wonder at him: What! art thou turned Puritan, will they say?
Wiltst thou forsake thy sports and merriments (which they think a little
heaven) cast off thine old companions and sworn brethren? etc. What, wondrest
thou at them for thus doing? What, for coming out of the fire? for taking pains
to save their souls? for not daring to wound, poison or destroy themselves by
provoking God? for taking pains to do that which must keep them by Gods
appointment, with all needful graces? for being troubled about their sins, and
the danger thereof? for longing to be in the favor of God, etc? Assuredly thou
have small reason so to do; but its for that they savor not the things of the
Spirit of God, for that they perceive not the things that are of God, are
blind, and cannot see afar off. Simile.
If we should see one of a strange Country come through our Town, we would
wonder at their strange attire, nothing like ours: The children of God be not
of this world, but chosen out of the world, and may not fashion themselves like
the world, but be of the fashion of Heaven, the world therefore wonders at them.

1. Therefore let none think, Use 1.
that if they turn to God, and take a good course, that they shall be generally
beloved and well thought of; of God, Angels and good men they shall, but of the
world they shall be wondered at and hated; ere you begin, make account hereof,
even to have the ill will of those which have loved you, yea, it may be, the
displeasure and frown of Father, Mother, etc. yet let not this hold you off,
nor keep you still in your old course; as long as God and good men love you,
Luke 6. 26.
what need you care? Woe be to you, when all men speak well of you; better be
wondered at and hated of the world for well-doing, then condemned of God for
ill-doing.

2. For those that are entered into a good course already, Use 2.
and find it thus, let them not be discouraged; its no new thing, the worthy
servants of God have been counted fools and madmen for well-doing: We must have
an Heroical courage not to be daunted herewith; we must not think the worse of
our selves, because the world thinks basely of us, who know us not, nor our
course, which of them that be very fools indeed, is counted foolishness; we may
wonder as much (and much more) at them, that be so desperate to go on in their
sins, and take no thought for death, Simil.
or day of Judgment, that hang over a pit, and yet can be merry; that run on
in the score, and never think of reckoning; that dare buy a few short profits
and pleasures at so dear a rate, at the loss of their souls, that deprive
themselves of the inward and true comfort and peace they might have in God and
spiritual things, as the Word and Sacraments, for the short and vain pleasures
of honor and deceiveable riches; that prefer Hogs meat before Angels food: We
have cause, I say, to wonder at their folly and madness, and to pity them,
thanking God that has not left us in their woeful blindeness, and miserable
estate: If thus by wondering at them we can do them any good, so it is, but let
not their wondering hurt us.

3. For those that think strange of Gods servants for not doing ill, Use 3.
or for well doing, they bewray themselves to be of the world, and so to be
carnal: They that mislike the fashion of Gods children, its a sign they be of
another Country, not of Heaven, and that they be none of wisdoms children,
Matthew. 11. 19.
for all they justify wisdom wheresoever they see her, and in whomsoever:
Labor therefore not only not to think their course strange, but to acknowledge
it the best course in the world, and accordingly to follow it.

That you run not with them] This shows, that

Though we be dull and dead, Man's proneness to evil exceeding great.
and slow to that that is good, yet our proneness and eagerness to that that is
naught is exceeding great: We can run to Play-sports, Vanities and Follies
please us, but we come to the Word, Prayers and good Duties with a leaden heel;
at this we are drowsy, but at the other watchful enough. Many run so fast in
the ways of sin, and make such haste, that they run themselves quite out of
state and credit with God and man, and out of their health too, and have
brought untimely destruction upon themselves; they have made such haste, that
it seems they thought long till they were in hell: Too too many also are now
a running (but its in the broad way) wherein the faster they run, the sooner
they come to destruction; if it were well considered, they can see small cause
to make such haste: O that they could be persuaded to turn head, and enter into
the way of good men, Heb. 12. 1.
and then let them run as fast as they will, run the race set before them, 1
Cor. 9. 24.
so run, that they may obtain; and as before we rejected all counsel that might
do us good, so now let us shake off all impediments, whether within or without
us, that would hinder us in our Christian course, or from running the way of
Gods Commandments: The faster we have heretofore run in vanity, run we now the
faster in the right way; we could then take great pains, think the time short,
spend our money in vanity, now after the same manner lets do the contrary; its
our great fault, that we did run apace after the world, See Romans 6. 19
with the profits and pleasure thereof, but now our fault is, that we go a foot
pace, nay, a Snails pace in goodness.

To the same excess of riot,] The ungodly follow after sin eagerly.
When men give way to sin, and their hearts are set on evil, there is no hoe,
but they will run over head and ears; Simile.
As the Sea if it break over a bank, it can scarcely be stopped, it runs so
violently; so small beginnings in sin, grow to excess quickly, and by degrees
till they are past hope.

Let no man therefore give way to them, See Job 31.
stop them at first: If Peter a good servant of God, having made a breach in
his conscience, and sinned once in denying his Master, was thereby stirred up
to add another breach, and another thereto, what shall become of the wicked?
Do not therefore say, Is this such a matter, etc? for one sin draws on another.

Speaking evil of you.] Its the nature of the ungodly to speak evil of Gods
servants.
It is the nature of the wicked to speak evil of Gods servants, they not only
think ill, but they speak ill too, it shall out: It were good that we were so
wise, when we have good things in our mind, that we would utter them; we
sometimes mislike things that be amiss, but we will say nothing, though we both
might and ought.

Verse 5. Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and
the dead.
HEre is the answer to the objection, whereby he heartneth on the good, not to
be discouraged at all for the wonderments and ill speakings of the world, even
for that they shall one day answer for this, when they shall not be able to
stand; though they can now abuse Gods servants at their pleasure, yet they
shall answer it before him that will judge quick and dead at the last and
dreadful day, when they shall receive the dreadful sentence of eternal
destruction for their labor. From the whole note we thus much, that

The enemies and hard dealers with Gods servants, The enemies of Gods children
shall not escape unpunished.
shall not escape unpunished, nay, even they that do but speak ill of them,
shall not go scot-free; Michol mocking David, was stricken with barrenness, and
David often comforts himself in this case, that God would take the matter into
his own hand: If he that calls any one fool and Raca, deserves Hell fire, See
Ier. 18. 18.
what do they deserve which speak evil of Gods children? Jude v. 14, 15.
If they shall answer for every idle word, then much more for every railing
reproachful word against the Saints of God; its to speak ill of the way of God,
to speak ill of them that walk in it for so doing; as he that calls one an
Heretic, calls his Opinion and Religion Heresy; and he that calls men fools,
calls their course foolishness; Its to hinder men from coming to God, or to
drive them away being come: Now this must needs be fearful, for if they that
win souls to God, shall be rewarded in Heaven, what shall become of them that
do the contrary? And if he that gathers not, scatters, and he that brings not
to God by words, counsel, encouragement and example, is counted as an enemy,
and such shall be punished at the day of judgment, how much more they that
have professedly hindered men from heaven? what are those but Factors for the
Devils Kingdom? deep enemies they are to God, that will not only not serve him
themselves, but mislike, and would hinder them that do, like the Devil, who
fell himself, and then would persuade man so to do, that God might have no
Creature to serve him: He were an odd servant (and whom his Master would
assuredly call to an account) who neither would work, Luke 15. 9.
nor suffer his fellows. The conversion of a sinner makes the Angels rejoice,
James. 5. 20.
therefore the putting them from God makes them heavy, See Acts 9. 4.
and the Devils merry* He that converts a sinner, saves a soul, Heb. 11.
as he that puts men from God destroys them: Besides, whatsoever is either done
or said against any of Gods children, Mat. 25. 42.
its accounted as done to God himself; and if they that have done them no good
shall be condemned, much more they that have injured them.

1. Let those repent in time that are guilty this way, Use 1.
else they shall be called to a reckoning when they have forgot it, and where
shall they appear when God shall come to judgment? O they shall wish the hills
to fall on them: Its a fearful thing to fall into his hands; he is a consuming
fire, woe unto them if his wrath be kindled but a little. They that have not
been helpers of the servants of God, have a fearful answer to make, what have
they then that have misused them? assuredly a deep place in hell.

2. Let all take heed that they never give their tongues leave, Use 2.
no, nor move their lips against a child of God, as to mock them, revile them,
term them precise fools, humerous people, Puritans, etc. Do it not on any
ground, for lightly God suffers not such to go unbranded even in this life, but
to be sure, there is a day they shall not escape.

3. This may well stay the minds of God servants, Use 3.
not only not to be discouraged, See Heb. 10. 14 and 11. 10, 26, 35. and 12. 2.
but to persevere, God will take their parts, and right their wrongs; their day
is a coming, when both before Angels and men they shall be arraigned, convicted
and condemned, and we shall lift up our heads, and receive our full reward: It
would be no small comfort and encouragement to us, if we would thus live by
faith.

Ver. 6. For for this cause was the Gospel preached also to them that are dead,
that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to
God in the Spirit.
HEre he returns to his former matter, his Exhortation to Sanctification,
pressing the same by another reason, from the end of the Gospel, and the
preaching thereof, that wheresoever and whenever it has been preached, this
has been the end thereof; to bring men to Sanctification and holiness of life,
to dye to sin and live to God by the Spirit of grace.

By Gospel we are to understand Christ Jesus, and the only way of salvation by
him. By Dead we are to understand their forefathers, that lived before Christ's
coming, who were then dead when the Apostle spoke this; not that the Gospel was
preached to them when they were dead, but when they lived here. By being judged
according to men in the flesh, understand dying to the flesh, namely, the lusts
and corruptions of their sinful nature. See 1 Cor. 5. 5.
As by living according to God in the Spirit, to live a spiritual and godly
life to Gods liking, by his regenerating and sanctifying spirit.

For this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead] Here note,
The Gospel was preached before Christ's time.


That the gospel was preached before Christ's time, as to Adam in Paradise, Acts
4. 12.
so to Abraham, so to those under the Law in their Sacrifices, Washings, John
14. 6.
Sacraments, etc. See Genesis 3. 15. and Joh. 8. 50. 1 Cor. 10. 3, 4. Heb. 11.
Heb. 13. 8.
Those then, and we now, are saved by one and the same Christ, He is the Way,
the Truth, and the Life; Yesterday and to day, and the same for ever. There was
never but one Covenant since the Fall, God never altered his mind: The
distinction of old and new is not in respect of substance, but of the manner of
Administration, to them more darkly, to us more clearly; then more sparingly,
to us more plentifully; then under types, to us the body is revealed.

1. This confutes those that think that those before the Law were saved one
way, Use 1.
they under the Law another, and they under the Gospel another.

2. It confutes them that hold, That every man is saved by his own devotion and
religion, Use 2.
whatsoever it is, so he be zealous in it, and live orderly: This they would
prove hence, namely, That the Jews were saved by observing of a few Rites and
Ceremonies; a false foundation must needs lay the building under foot: Do not
we see, that when they were even most zealous in Ceremonies, that yet the
Prophets cried out, that God was not content, but called both for Faith and
Love. Besides, what a folly is it to think that every man shall be saved by his
own Religion? Is any thing pleasing to God, but that which himself has
appointed in his Word? not our conceit, but his will is the rule of his Worship:
The Word sends us to Christ, in whom alone God is well pleased, without him
there is no Salvation for any.

3. It confutes those among our selves, Use 3.
which hope to be saved by their good meaning, good prayers, civil
righteousness, by their repenting, and crying God mercy, etc. All these are
blind Sodomites, they grope for a door where there is none, and will but hit
their heads against the wall to their destruction: O how happy are we, that
(there being but one way of salvation, known but to a few) it should be so
clearly made known to us, were we so happy as to make it good to our selves.

That they might be judged according to men in the flesh, The Gospel calls for
sanctification.
etc.] Here note from the end of the Gospel, that

The Gospel calls for sanctification, Matthew. 11. 27.
and all the parts thereof, for as the Law has Commandments, Tit. 2. 11.
so has the Gospel; it calls for faith and repentance, Differences between the
Law and the Gospel.
and in this latter, obedience to all the Commandments of the Law: The
differences are, 1. The Law requires obedience, but gives no power, the Gospel
does both. 2. The Law requires strict obedience to the utmost, the Gospel
requires an upright endeavor only, and to believe in him who has performed it
perfectly. The Sacraments and Sacrifices of the old Testament called for this,
even for truth of heart, for faith and repentance. See Exo. 12. 15.
God bade them circumcise the foreskin of their hearts, 2 Chro. 30. 21.
and under that Law of purging all leaven out of their houses, the people were
called to repentance. So Baptism and the Supper of the Lord, the appurtenances
of the Gospel, call for Sanctification: And does any thing more call for
mortifying of our lusts, and living to God, then the death of Christ for sin,
wherein we see how heinous a thing sin is in Gods account, as also the
unspeakable love of God to us, in giving Christ thus to dye for us? The death
of Christ should be a great corrosive to eat our sin: 2 Cor. 5. 15.
This was the end of Christ's suffering for us; Will Christ dye for a man, Luke
1. 74.
and yet have no use of him after, but that he may live as he list? assuredly
God would never cause his Gospel to be preached, but to bring men to
Sanctification.

1. This confutes as well the Papists for affirming, Use 1.
that we preaching Justification by Faith only, See Romans 3.
preach a doctrine of liberty to sin; but on the contrary, this doctrine does
notably establish good works, as those among our selves, that cry out upon
going to sermons; O, say they, we see none worse then they, they will deceive,
they will cut their neighbors throat; but of most this is a lie: but if some be
so, let them know, that the Gospel teaches them not so to do.

2. This rebukes those carnal wretches, Use 2.
which live under the Gospel, yet abide still in their sins: They think the
Gospel brings only tidings of salvation, but requires no amendment or
mortification. If Paul, Tit. 2. had gone no further, but stayed at Bring
salvation, we should have had a number of Christians, but his other words,
teaching us to deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, etc. O
this part they cannot away with; so they could willingly hear, Come unto me ^ll
ye that are weary, etc. but not take up the Cross, but God has joined them
together, and they cannot be separated; he that has the one must have the
other, as he that was to have the inheritance, was to marry Ruth. Hence it is,
that multitudes have in their mouths, They hope to be saved by Christ, and yet
remain in their lusts, without mortifying the same, or giving up themselves to
God in an holy life: Thus is it with ignorant persons, profane persons, civil
persons, worldlings and hypocrites; What impudent wretches are these? They hope
to be saved by Christ, and yet live in their sins, thus making Christ's death to
be a license to all evil. Sundry deceive themselves in these days, some content
themselves with an outward profession, some are happily at some times humbled,
and thereupon conceive themselves to be converted, etc. but let every man try
himself by his Sanctification: If this was required of them that lived before
Christ's coming, who had dimmer light, and more sparing means and promises then
we, then think what is required of us that have heaven set open to us, and all
the Fathers mind revealed, yea, Christ dead, risen, ascended, and all
fulfilled.

3. For Gods children, Use 1.
which do indeed hope for Salvation by Christ, and have yielded obedience to
the Gospel in some measure; there is nothing that can become us better, then to
labor to profit in mortifying our lusts, and to show the fruits of the Sprit
more plentifully and powerfully in our lives: Every Sermon and Sacrament should
put new life in us; For what is the profiting by the Gospel, but to dye to sin,
and live to righteousness daily, by an effectual knowledge of Christ Jesus: O
its our great fault that we grow so slowly, that we get not a full mastery of
our lusts, that sometimes we shrink at the yoke of Christ, as thinking some
part of it too strait, and desiring more liberty, who yet thought we could
never do enough for the Lord: O that our actions should favor so much of the
flesh, and so little of the Spirit; O that we might increase in our zealous
affection to God, for his love in Christ, and for the Gospel, and that our
behavior may be daily more answerable thereto, as our Salvation does more
nearly approach.

Verse. 7. But the end of all things is at hand, be ye therefore sober, and
watch unto prayer.
THe former part of this verse may be either a reason of the exhortation past,
and that from the shortness of the time to come, or of the Exhortations ensuing
unto sobriety, watchfulness in prayer, charity, hospitality, etc.

The end of all things is at hand,] There shall be an end of all things.
The end of all things, not of men only, or of some creatures, not such a
destruction and desolation as has been of some particular Cities and Nations,
nor a destruction of some Creatures in all places, as was in the Flood; but the
end of all things, that is, All things shall come to that end that God has
appointed them to come to, many and most Creatures to an utter end, the heavens
and earth to be purged by fire, men and women not to come to an utter end, but
to live immortally in joy or woe, but to be at an and for living here; so that
as the world had a beginning, it shall have an end, the same God that created
it shall destroy it.

Is at hand,] 1 Cor. 7. 29. and 10. 11.
That is, draws near, therefore these are called the last times; and the
Apostle says, Time is short; and, That upon them the ends of the world were
come. James 5. 8.


Obj. How could this be true, that it was near, when now 1600 years are past
since, and yet it is not come, did the Apostle speak as he thought, or only to
scare the people?

Answ. He spoke as he was persuaded, and that truly, 1. Either in respect of
the times before Christ, it was nearer then to those under the Law; Psalm. 90. 4.
or 2. In respect of God, to whom 1000 years are but as one day; or 3. In
respect of eternity; a thousand years are nothing to the time to come, which is
for ever, its as little as a drop of water to the whole ocean Sea.

Obj. But did the Apostle think that it was thus far off, and should last thus
many years as it has since he spoke this?

A. Its likely he thought it nearer, for Christ Jesus being come, and all the
Prophesies of him fulfilled, the Gentiles called, and the mystery of iniquity
begun already to work, why might he not think this? and though some things were
yet to be accomplished touching the calling of the Jews, yet might he think
that that might quickly be dispatched: Heb. 1. 1.
Howsoever, that that time was the last time they knew, and that God would
never speak after any new manner to his Church, as he had done before from time
to time; 2 Thessalonians. 2. 1.
and the Apostle Paul, though he would often signify the end to be
approaching, yet he knew it was not to be by and by, but that some things must
first fall out, though happily he conceived that the same might have been
dispatched in lesser time then it has been: But we have the advantage of them,
because we have the Book of the Revelation left to the Church, by the Ministry
of John, the last living Apostle, containing things to come, from that time
till the worlds end, whereof many things be already accomplished, which makes
the Book more lightsom, and other things are yet to come touching the ruin of
Antichrist, calling of the Jews, destruction of the Turks; but in what time the
Lord will finish these things, we know not: What if the day be yet some scores
of years off, yea, some few hundreds, as we may well think that is the utmost,
is it not then near by? It was near in the Apostles time, much nearer now; then
began the last time, now is the end thereof: But that is not so much the force
of the Reason, as this, That we live in the last times, nearer the worlds end
then our Forefathers before Christ, therefore ought to mind earthly things
less, and seek more after heavenly, and lead an holy and godly life: But say
the day of Judgment were not so near as it is, yet every of our particular
ends is at hand, we know not how soon, when, where, how, to day or to morrow,
and that is to us as if the world were at an end for any use thereof; and for
our state, it shall be with us at the last day as when we dye.

1. This may provoke us to Sanctification, Use 1.
and a godly life, seeing we live in the clearest times, when the last day
draws near: They that lived long ago were to live godly, much more we, having
so short a time; we must so live, that when our Master comes, he may find us
so doing; If death or judgment take us in our sins, how miserable is our
condition?

2. It may reprove such as so live here, Use 2.
as if here they were to live for ever, eating and drinking, and beating their
fellow servants, etc. others also that go on carelessly, either making no
profession, or contenting themselves with a show thereof, as the five foolish
Virgins; every one must prepare himself; that he may be found in peace at Gods
coming.

3. It may comfort the godly in bearing the Cross patiently, Use 3.
yet a little while, and we shall be in heaven from the same; yea, that day
draws near, wherein God will be glorified in the sight of all his enemies.
See Phil. 4. 5. Heb. 10. 36. James 5. 8.

4. We should not set our minds on these transitory things, Use 4.
but on them that endure for ever: Mat. 6. 19, 20.
The things of this world are vain, John 6. 27.
uncertain, perishing; the world it self shall be consumed, and our selves be
most frail of all, we must therefore be sober in seeking these earthly things,
laboring after grace, life everlasting, and the means thereof.

Be ye therefore sober,] Now of particular duties, one helps another. The
former reason strongly enforces these duties. From the coherence, note,

1. That as before he exhorted to Sanctification in general, so he does now in
particular, for we are subject to deceive our selves: Many be good in the
gross, not so in particulars; they think they love God above all, and their
neighbors too, and that they live holily, but come to particulars, its nothing
so.

2. That as he forbade the forementioned lusts and vices, so he now exhorts to
the contrary duties; the one must not be without the other, see Acts 26. 18.

In particular, we are to be sober both in the use of riches, and in the use of
pleasures, but of this last with the appurtenances thereof, Meat, Drink,
Apparel, Recreations, we shall speak afterward.

For sobriety in Riches: Riches good in themselves.
Riches as Gods creatures be good in themselves, See Psalm. 112. 3.
and promised by God to his servants as blessings, nay, given to some of them
as blessings, Prove. 3. 16.
as to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Job, etc. They are encouragements to duty and
well-doing, and may be great helps and furtherances to us, in and unto many
good duties, and that both toward our selves (for we may spend the more time,
and have more freedom about matters of our soul) and to others, in showing
liberality and mercy; and to the children of God that use them well, they are
as pledges of better and everlasting good things, as Canaan was to the godly
Jews a type of heaven: But it may seem needless to speak of the goodness of
riches, seeing most men count them the only good; but the truth must be
taught, we speak of the things themselves; yea, some have utterly hated them as
evil, as Crates; and among the Papists there be some that profess voluntary
poverty, but our Savior bids us not cast them away, but make friends of them,
See Ephesians. 4. 29.
even employ them well to the glory of God, the giver thereof, and our own and
others good.

Obj. But our Savior calls them thorns, which choke the good seed, snares to
entangle and drown us in Perdition, and riches of iniquity, and shows that
its an hard thing for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.

Ans. He speaks not of riches as they be in their own nature, nor as they be
well used by godly men, but as they be wickedly abused by wicked men, either in
the ill getting of them, or wicked using of them to pride, and such bad
purposes; and our Savior explaineth himself, Matthew. 19. 23.
That its hard for a man that trusts in riches, or sets his mind upon them (as
indeed most do) to be saved: Its certain that few rich men be saved, but its
not the fault of their riches, but the abusing of them.

Obj. We must do as Christ's Disciples, who forsook all and followed Christ.

Ans. 1. We are not bound to do as they did, for they were called to a special
and extraordinary calling to follow Christ, and go into all the world preaching
him, which could not stand with worldly business. 2. They left not these things
in respect of their right to them, but only in the use of them; They took off
their minds from them, and were content to part with them for Christ and the
Gospels sake, and so ought we, Matthew. 9. 10.
but they retained the right of them: Matthew after he followed Christ, feasted
Christ, and with him many Publicans in his own house: Matthew. 8. 14.
So Peter had a Boat and Nets, and went a fishing a little after our Savior
Christ was taken from him: So that a Minister is not bound to spend that which
his friends has left him, much less are private persons.

Obj. But the young man was willed to sell all.

Ans. It was but a particular trial of that rich young man that thought himself
so righteous, Matthew. 19. 21.
whereby our Savior would let him see how far off he was of that he thought was
in him, in that he had not profited so far as to prefer God and his Kingdom
before his wealth, but would rather forsake God then his riches, if he must
needs part with one, that so he might be humbled.

Though riches in themselves are good, How riches are good.
yet 1. They are not so in an high degree, but in a very mean and low degree,
in respect of God, Spiritual Graces, and the Kingdom of Heaven; In comparison
of these they are but dross and dung: The leavings of the love we bear to
those, is too much for the world; fervent love to these, lukewarm to the world
is good enough. 2. They are not good absolutely, but as they are used; to the
godly they be good, when they use them well, else not, but they are at no time
good to the ungodly, because they cannot use them well: Therefore concerning
riches its required, 1. That the party who would use them must be in the favor
of God, a Regenerate person, restored unto Christ by a right thereto, which we
lost by our sin in Adam: Else we shall taint Gods blessings by our sins, we
shall be ready to use them to bad purposes, if we be bad our selves, and the
things which be good in themselves, shall be turned into sin to us; for unto
the unclean, all things are unclean: Extremely foolish is their practice that
labor to have all good things about them, House, Land, Corn, Cattle,
Household Stuff, Money, etc. they themselves remaining bad, for these be never
good to them, till they themselves be sanctified; and hence it is that as most
men go to work, they use riches to the hurt of their souls, yea, to their own
destruction, which could they have sobriety in them, they might easily avoid.
2. That he use them a right, even with sobriety.

For sobriety in riches; Wherein sobriety in riches consists.
Its either in the desire and seeking them, or using and employing them, we
must seek them soberly, we must also use them soberly when we have them.

Sobriety in seeking or getting them is in many things: 1. We must seek them
according to their worth, first, Heavenly and Spiritual things, then these; we
must not in our judgment value them equal, much less above Grace, the favor of
God, and Heaven; we must not in our affection so love them, nor in our practice
seek after them so earnestly as for grace; every thing is comely in his place
and time: A Servant whiles he keeps his place is a comely necessary help, but
if he begin to control his Master, to usurp his Masters Chair, to woo his
Mistress, Simile.
etc. its intolerable: So while riches be content with the place of Servants,
to be at their masters appointment to good uses, its well; but when they shall
perk up above Spiritual graces, and heavenly things, and get away the heart
from God, and our heavenly Husband Christ Jesus, then they are to be turned out
of doors, and stamped under foot, for in comparison of these, they are as the
basest pibble stone to the most precious Stone or Diamond. 2. We must not set
down with our selves that we will be rich (for then if lawful means should
fail, we would use any other, transgress even for a piece of bread; 1 Timothy 6. 9.
they that will be rich, fall into diverse temptations and snares) but herein
show a moderate mind. Prove. 28. 20.
3. We must not make haste to be rich, but must be content to stay our time,
and wait the Lords leisure, till he bless our labors with fruitful increase: A
man must not run out as soon as he sees a booty, See Prove. 20, 21. and 28. 20,
22.
lest there be Enemies by in ambush, which may make us a booty, but must
consider well ere we go about it; happily it was only held out as a trial from
God, or a trap by the Devil to catch us: They be thorns, if we rush upon them
hastily, unless we be well fenced and prepared we shall hereby harm our selves.
4. We must seek them with a quiet and contented mind, and not with an
unsatiable appetite, such as can never be satisfied, but thirsts continually
after more. 5. We must seek them only by lawful means, and not otherwise; not
with the neglect of good duties to God, our Souls, or Families, etc. or hudling
them up, much less by committing evils, as by Lying, Swearing, Sabbath
breaking, Deceit, Oppression, See Mat. 16. 26.
etc. nor by Gaming, etc. This were to seek them with the dishonor of God, and
loss of our souls for trash. 6. We must not affect, seek, or desire after
abundance and superfluity, but for things necessary, not for necessity of
nature, but for necessity of a man's estate, condition and calling: Thus a
Prince, Nobleman or Magistrate, requires a greater Portion to maintain their
Estate, and those that depend on them; So a Minister, to maintain himself and
his, and that he may follow his Study, and buy Books; and herein we may desire
so much as may be competently sufficient, as well for our selves, as for all
that belong to us, and that not only to maintain them while we live, but to
leave them somewhat according to our state when we dye; yea, and that whilst
we live we may be enabled to do some good in our places toward the relief of
the poor, Acts 20. 35.
it being a more blessed thing to give then to receive: To ask or desire more
to spend superfluously, we have no warrant, yea, so to ask or desire, were a
sign of distrust: Not but that the things themselves are good, how great a
portion soever we have of them, if we could use them to good uses; but our
corrupt nature is subject, both to dote upon them, trust in them, be lifted up
by them, and the Devil to fasten many dangerous temptations on us, by the means
of them, and therefore we should not desire such abundance of them: See Prove.
30. 8.
If God should cast such abundance on us, by honest labor in following our
calling, or otherwise, we ought humbly to beg a great deal of grace and fear,
our stewardship and account being now far greater: Genesis 28. 20.
Jacob asked food and raiment; and we are willed therewith to be content, they
be not good absolutely, and to every man; and many have taken hurt by them, few
at any time made better; where poverty has slain a thousand, riches has slain
ten thousand: They be never almost mentioned in Scripture, but with one check
or other (as thorns, snares, uncertain, deceitful, meat that perishes,
unrighteous Mammon, etc.) that we may not be in love with them.

1. This condemns the common practice of most men in the world, Use 1.
that be stark drunk with these things, and seek them without all bounds, which
is also the fault even of some of Gods Servants: O how many seek them before
grace and heavenly things, do altogether labor for the meat that perishes! O
how many will work all the six days long, but in the mean time do nothing for
their soul, yea, on the Sabbath do no more then an outward performance of duty
to satisfy Law, and for fashions sake, their tongues and hearts running after
the world! God and grace are not in their thoughts: A little of this is enough,
yea and then only, when they can follow the world no longer; and thus with
most the greedy desires after the world eats up all thought of any goodness:
Hence it is that they are wise for the world, but stark fools in matters of
Religion; of that they can talk all the day long, but cannot speak three words
savorly of any good thing; They abound in wealth, but have not so much as a
dram of grace, nor look after none; rich in the world, but to Godward,
miserable, poor, blind, naked souls.

2. How do numbers set down with themselves to be rich, Use 2.
and thus much to give to such a child, etc? how also many are even mad in
making haste to be rich, up early, down late, by right, wrong, etc. yea, make
such haste, as they break their shins, nay, make waste of their souls? What,
will they fly before they be fledged? must they needs get up all at once?
cannot they tarry, and rise as God will have them, but by getting other men's
goods into their hands, or running into the Usurers books, undo both themselves
and others? what purchasing is there before men be fit, when happily they have
not half the money to lay down, but for the rest must be beholding to the
Usurer, and so fall into the Kites paws? Thus some have lost their own livings
which have been competent, by reaching at more before they were fit; others,
though they have not thus undone themselves, yet much straiten themselves,
shame and disgrace themselves, are still in debt, live barely and miserably,
who might else live at elbow room and comfortably: How many are so unsatiable
and greedy, that like Hell and the Grave, they still cry, Give, give; they have
the dropsy, and their thirst can never be quenched: They are like a great
Hound standing at the tables end, give him one piece of meat, he swallows it
down without chewing, looking on your face presently for another: There Is no
end of Lying, Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, Deceitful and false Weights and
Wares, Oppression, Wrongful dealing, etc. and all to be rich in the world; nay,
when men have both competency and sufficiency, yet do they still eagerly follow
it, with as hot a pursuit as if they had nothing: O how odious this is in Gods
sight! this Covetousness is Idolatry; yet, as if one should have told Nabal,
after he had so blockishly sent away David's servants, that he was Covetous, he
would have said, Nay, but a good husband; so who can persuade these hereof?
This is a kind of drunkenness, as the moderate seeking of riches, soberness;
neither can two things be more like, then are drunkards and covetous persons.

1. Both be insensible, A comparison between drunkenness and immoderate seeking
of riches.
ye cannot beat any good thing in either of their heads: Though the one reel as
he goes, and cannot so much as speak a wise word, yet you cannot persuade him
that he is drunk; and though the other does both pinch himself and others, yet
he will not believe that he is covetous.

2. Both be insatiable; The drunkard must have pot after pot, is never
satisfied, but still dry; So the covetous man must join Farm unto Farm, House
unto House, Land unto Land; The one calls in dousens of beer, yards of beer,
pails of beer, beer by the Hogsheads; So if a covetous man had a whole Town, he
would desire another, and then a third, etc.

3. Both be inserviceable; who will put a drunkard in any office? what
employment is he fit for? So a covetous man, he will so look to his private
gain, Exodus 18. 21.
as he will neglect the public; he will have something clear to himself, 1 Timothy 3. 3.
of that is committed to him, or will take bribes, or extraordinary fees;
Therefore it is, that both Magistrates and Ministers are willed to avoid this.

4. Both be incorrigible; There Is no hope of an old drunkard, few of them
repent; so of a covetous man, its a rare thing to see a Zacheus: That story
begins with a word of Note, Behold: The vilest drunkard is not more odious to
God, Ephesians. 5. 3.
then is a wicked covetous man: God would not have covetousness to be once
named amongst us; 1 Cor. 5. 11. and 6. 10.
yea, he forbids to keep company with one that is covetous, and pronounces
that such shall not inherit his kingdom. Covetousness is the root of all evil,
the breach of all the ten Commandments; it takes away our Love, Fear, and Trust
in God, and gives it to Wealth, yea, it hinders from the very knowledge of God:
Through it many have society with Idolaters; because of it, how many thousand
oaths are sworn daily? how many daily forsworn? what regard bear such to the
Word? either because of their Farms and Oxen they will not come thereto, Luke
16. 14.
of if they do, they are so toiled by the world, Ezekiel. 33. 31.
that they sleep thereat; or if they do hearken, they do but mock, at least go
not away much the better, their minds being all the while ranging, and they
hearing only as one in a dream. Hereby also they neglect prayer, and are
either kept from the Sacrament, or come profanely; hereby also do they
infinitely break the Sabbath, as in buying, selling, riding, talking of worldly
matters, etc. Thus also many Parents through niggardliness, spoil their
children for want of education, Migistrates take bribes to prevent Justice,
Ministers ingross livings, people pull away their Ministers maintenance,
servants deceive their Masters, Princes pole their Subjects, See Prove. 1. 19.
and Subjects withdraw their taxes and dues from them: Through this many lose
their lives, as Naboth: There Is much contention both within doors and without
for trifles; so many women prostitute themselves, and their husbands wink
thereat because of advantage; and many to avoid charge, which as they think
would come by marriage, live in uncleanness: From hence also what cousenages
and deceivings do arise in buying, selling, letting, hiring, borrowing,
lending, partnership, etc.? what simony, sacrilege, bribery, usury, etc? how
also are lies multiplied hereby? and how many Tale-carriers are there merely
for this respect? yea, there is no villainy in this world so odious to God and
man, which through covetousness men will not commit, and therefore it was no
wonder that David prayed that his heart might not be inclined hereto. Psalm. 119
36.
O what a folly and madness is it, for men to seek so greedily after these
things, which yet oftentimes are the further from them; but admit thou
obtainest them, are they able to purchase for thee a pardon of thy sins? Can
they pacify Gods wrath? Can they prolong thy days one hour? Does thy Salvation
stand in these? may thou not soon be deprived thereof? Shall thou tarry long
with them? Is there not vexation in them? If thou should long enjoy them,
yet having no grace in thy heart, no assurance of Gods favor, no hope of a
better life, woe unto thee, and yet this is the state of thousands: They only
mind earthly things, having no regard of Heavenly or Spiritual Grace, and so
living here basely for a while, without enjoying the benefit of that they have,
they are at the length snatched away, and then the world strives for their
goods, and the Devil for their souls. As an Ass that caries Plate all day, at
night is turned into a foul stable, or bare Pasture to nob on Thistles, and
that with a galled back; so are they turned out with a galled and guilty
conscience, Simile.
and a soul laden with innumerable sins, and so sink down to Hell, there to be
for ever and ever.

Art thou guilty hereof? Repent, endeavor to see thy folly, confess, cry to
God, make restitution of that which thou have taken unjustly, seek for pardon,
for grace, for sanctification: O that it might be said to thee, Luke 19. 9.
as to Zacheus, This day is salvation come to thy house* Art thou free of this
poison, beware thou be not tainted herewith, of all evils its the most
dangerous and damnable, and most hardly rooted out: Esteem of these things as
they ought, but chiefly labor for your part in those true riches, which shall
never be taken away.

Its the fault of Christians, that they seek the world too eagerly, and neglect
many good duties for it, run into unwarrantable courses, are unquiet,
contentious, etc. whereby they make themselves and their Profession to be ill
spoken of: O how ill does this beseem Christians which have God to be their
Father, and Heaven for their inheritance and portion! Fie upon it; Is this to
behave our selves Pilgrimlike? we should carry our selves so moderately in
these things, that we may make the world see and say, John 4. 32.
we have riches that they know not of, as our Savior said, He had meat his
Disciples knew not of; we must labor to grow in grace, and covet the best
things.

For the second part of sobriety, which is in the use of riches when we have
them, it has relation either to our mind, when we esteem of them; or our
practice, when we employ them as God requires.

1. We must esteem of them but as they are, We must not set our minds too much
on riches.
and not set our minds overdeeply on them, as if the having of them were our
happiness, the want of them our utter misery: Neither must we think the more
highly of our selves, Psalm. 62. 10.
because of them; for goodness is that only which makes us of account with God
and good men: when we go down to the grave we be all fellows, nor ought we to
trust in them, as though they could be a Castle and Tower against whatsoever
may come upon us, Plague, War, Famine, etc. This is the common sin of the
world, yea, even Gods Servants may partly perceive that their hearts rise as
their wealth increases: O its hard for a man to keep down his heart that it
swell not! Nor must we be excessively loath to part with them when God sees it
good, nor cast down when we have any loss, as if we had lost happiness: O how
many are thus grieved, which were never grieved for their sins, nor wept for
fear of Gods wrath and condemnation! we should grieve indeed for our sins, or
if we do not feel Gods favor, or observe any decay in our love to God and
goodness, but not as worldly losses, especially enjoying Gods favor, and having
through Christ an assured hope of a better life.

2. We must employ them as God requires, We must employ them as God requires.
and that both on our selves and others; our selves and ours, For he that
provides not for himself and his family, 1 Timothy 5. 8.
is worse then an infidel: and Solomon says, Its a good and comely thing for a
man to take part of that God has given him: Eccles. 5. 18.
Jacob after he had served Laban many years, Genesis 30. 30.
began at the length to think of his own house: Genesis 30. 30.
But what base misers are they that cannot afford themselves or theirs
necessaries in food and raiment? They are diseased with an evil sickness; They
are Thieves to their backs, bellies, families: neither are those prodigal
rioters in a better case, which waste and consume all in sports, company
keeping, and belly-cheer; they rob their wives, their children, their friends,
the poor, and usually dye in the Goal, leaving their children to misery.

Others, Prove. 3. 9.
as upon the worship and service of God, and maintenance of the Gospel and
Ministers thereof, for the good of our own souls.

So upon the King and Commonwealth, under whom we enjoy Peace and the Gospel,
as also upon the Poor, especially the Saints, See Deuteronomy. 15. 10. Psalm. 37. 25,
26. Psalm. 112. Prove. 11. 23. Matthew. 5. Luke 14. Heb. 13. And this we must do,
Act. 4. 34, 37.
not only of our superfluity, but in some cases even of our necessity, of our
very Lands; we are not Lords of our goods, but Stewards for which we must be
countable to our master.

This rebukes those that are all for themselves, as for any other, either they
will not bestow any thing at all, or no more then needs must, and most
Christians are too nigardly: For the worship of God, some think that any thing
bestowed this way is too much, that this is the worst and idlest money bestowed
this may be; they could be content with a blind Sir, that would live of
crusts; and if they can pull away the Tithes, and make a bargain with a
Minister half for naught, they think it well gotten; and many that might
procure the Preaching of the Word to them, only the want is, their hearts are
so glued to the world, they had rather have their Hogs, then Christ's company
among them: The blind devotion in times of Popery to build Churches and
Religious Houses, will condemn the wretchedness of our times; If a Church be
but decayed in our days, there must be a Collection all over the Country, if
not many Shires, for the reparation hereof: And how do men hide and conceal
their Estates, that they may be freed from the paying of Subsidies and Taxes,
and so deceive the King of his due? And what wincing is there for the payment
of the poor, the true poor? If it were not out of the fear of Law and Justice,
they would pay nothing, or as good as nothing: Has not God made many promises?
what unbelievers are these that will not take Gods word? Their goods thus
spared prosper not long, for God will be true; hence come so many changes of
owners, even because men get and keep their goods unlawfully.

Thus many instead of wealth, leave their children an heap of chaff that blows
away: God will rifle in such goods; and besides at the last day, what account
and bills will these be able to bring in? that they spent all on themselves, or
wasted all in riot, or spared all from those good uses they should: Their bills
will not be taken, they shall hear this sentence, O evil and unfaithful
servant, thou have been untrusty in a little, who shall trust thee with more,
take him hence, bind him hand and foot, etc. but to those that have employed
them well, it shall be said, Come ye blessed of my Father, and. Well done good
and faithful servant, thou have been faithful in a little, enter into thy
Masters joy.

O then let us learn this sobriety: We have an enemy to resist, who if we be
drunk with the love of the world, will assuredly have his will of us; and is
not the end of all things at hand? If we be drunk when our Lord and Master
comes, what shall be our portion? we must dye; we dye daily in our neighbors.

And watch unto prayer,] This is not to be understood of the bodily waking of
the eye from sleep, though the Papists so transfer it, and therefore keep
certain Vigils and Watches for Saints, certain nights of the year (though upon
occasion, Psalm. 119. 148.
we ought with David to keep our eyes waking in the night, that we may praise
God, and pray unto him) but its meant of a spiritual watchfulness, whereby we
have an eye to our hearts and ways, that we do nothing against the will of God,
but may ever be doing that which is good and acceptable in his fight, which is
a notable help to further a man in a godly life to the kingdom of heaven; and
this is performed by those only, who having obtained mercy of God, and
assurance of pardon, see cause why they should turn to him, serve him, and give
themselves wholly to him.

This watchfulness is well put after sobriety, Watchfulness why set after
sobriety.
as sobriety is set before it to make way for the same; for as a man drunk with
wine, cannot keep awake, but sleeps like a Hog, so he that is drunk with the
cares of this life, cannot watch spiritually.

This watching is a looking to our hearts and all our ways, What watchfulness
is.
that we may be always kept from evil, and ever in a good course. Therefore as
Watchmen use to examine all Passengers, and accordingly deal with them, so
ought we to watch against all enemies, which are, evil thoughts, evil words,
and evil deeds, which do either directly proceed from our own ill heart, or by
the temptation of Satan and the world. To prevent evil thoughts, we must keep
the heart with all diligence: Prove. 4. 23.
This is the fountain that sends forth such streams; the furnace from whence
comes such sparks. If our thoughts be wicked, impatient, unclean, proud, etc.
we must suppress them, and beat them down; but if good, holy and pure, let them
pass for true men; so we must take heed to our ways, Psalm. 39. 1.
that we sin not with our tongues. Our tongue is a slippery member, James 3. 2.
an unruly evil, able (as little as it is) to do much hurt, and he is a perfect
man, and able to rule all his body, that can rule his tongue; we must therefore
set a watch before the door of our lips, and examine all our words. And for
evil actions, we must also beware of them, we must take heed to our ways, watch
all parts and members of our bodies, that no ill action break forth, and
accordingly as Job Covenanted with his eyes, Job 31. 1.
we must with every member. We must examine every action at our going about it;
if any evil one pass from us, and break, as it were through the watch, we must
be grieved and repent, and thereafter be more watchful: As the eyesight and
eyelid are necessary in the body, so is watchfulness in the soul; we are
continually in danger of falling, the Devil, the world and our own lusts be our
enemies; if we suffer them to break in upon us, we dishonor God, and spoil our
selves of our peace and comfort: And as we must watch against all evil, so must
we especially against those we be most subject to, as wise and careful Watchmen
will have most care of the weakest parts of their City: And as we must watch to
keep out evil, so must we to do good, and that both privately and publicly,
toward God, our selves, and our brethren: And not this only, but watch that
we do good as we ought to do, in a right manner; we must look to our hearts in
our callings, and in our best duties, for even then they will beguile us, and
the right manner of performance is all in all: Thus in prayer we must watch
against private pride, hypocrisy, wandering thoughts, etc. so in the Word,
against Infidelity, prejudicate Opinions, etc. this must be all the day
through, and in our particular actions; for its not enough to have a general
purpose of well-doing, Heb. 3. 12.
or of a godly life, Prove. 23. 17. and 28. 14.
but we must look to every particular action through the day; we must not be
good by wholesale, Col. 1. 10.
but by retale; not in the sum and gross, but even in particulars; there must
not at any time be an evil heart in us, we must be in the fear of the Lord
continually. As in journeying (suppose to York) we ask not only whether it be
East, West, North or South, but through what Shires we must go, nay, by what
great Towns, nay, by what Villages, nay, we ask what turnings there are from
such a place, to such a place, nay, what marks we shall meet withal, as
Windmils, Crosses, etc. And as a great man's servant, sets not down only
received 100 or 500 l. and laid out so much in the gross, but particularly,
what he received of such a one, and what of another, and what he laid out for
this, what for that, Luke 1. 75.
etc. so should we observe every particular, and that throughout the whole
course of our lives: 1 Pet. 1. 17. and 4. 2.
There Is no time for security or sin, we must not at any time give way either
unto evil, Why we ought to be watchful.
or that evil one.

That we ought to be thus watchful, may appear; 1. For that we have within us
corrupt and wretched hearts, which continually lust after evil, and are
untoward to any good, being also subtle and deceitful above all things. 2. The
Devil a most malicious and watchful adversary, Zech. 3. 1.
is at our elbows always, yea, in our best actions, as he was at Joshua's right
hand to resist him: The world also affords many provocations. 3. The love of
God toward us in Christ, pardoning our sins, and calling us to the hope of
eternal happiness, being so wonderful and unspeakable; must we not therefore so
watch in all things, as that we may do nothing to grieve so good and merciful a
Father, but be careful in all things to be acceptable in his sight. 4. Our
Lords coming is uncertain, we must therefore be like the diligent servant, with
our loins girded, and lights burning; we must be like the five wise virgins,
with oil in our lamps, attending the coming of our Bridegroom: This is no more
then Gods requires of us, no more then Noah, Henoch and Abraham performed; they
walked with God, set themselves continually as in Gods presence, in an heedful
care to all their ways: This is no more then needs, if either we consider the
price of sin, the inclination of our own hearts, and what enemies the Devil and
world are to us. Neither does this watchfulness hinder us from any thing but
sin; from no liberty, but that that is naught and hurtful, and that we may as
well spare, as water out of our shoes; it hinders not from our calling, only
requires us to pray first, now a whet is no let, we shall speed the better all
the day after; it only teaches us how to be in our calling, not as drudges to
the world, but the servants of God; it hinders us not from buying and selling,
but from Craft, Covetousness, Corruption in the same; not from company, but
from vanity and unprofitableness in company; not from mirth, but from vain
wicked mirth; so that its so far from being a bondage, that its blessed
liberty: Some think that thus we shall pinion and bind our hands behind us,
and that this is too strait: Its true, to our nature that has been used to so
much liberty, Simile.
it will seem strait at first, till we be accustomed to it, and then it will be
found easy and pleasant; even as a new suit of apparel, though never so fit,
yet will seem strait at the first putting on, which afterward it will not:
Such pretenses are but as a Lion in the way of a Sluggard.

The benefits ensuing hereby are diverse: Benefits of watchfulness.
1. It keeps from many sins, whereunto else we must needs fall ere we be aware,
and so consequently Psalm. 119. 17.
from many heart-smarts and wounds of conscience: Whatsoever is a mean to keep
a man from sin, is a blessed friend of his. 2. It keeps us from lying still in
any sin, and is a mean degrees. 8. It makes us fit both to live and dye, to
live and perform the good duties that God requires, for a heart well ordered
is fitter to pray, to hear, to come to the Sacraments, etc. our accounts be the
sooner made, and so it being done daily, its done more easily, then if it be
put off to a great deal together. To dye, as being always fit and ready for our
Lords coming.

1. This being a thing so necessary and profitable, Use 1.
we have cause to lament that we have known it no better, nor had acquaintance
therewithal: for alas, not to speak of the common sort, which look after no
such matter, but will do as they list, though they smart for it eternally, even
among the people of God, how little is it known that God requires such a
particular care and watch? that its a thing possible, but rather impossible, or
at least most irksom, and therefore content themselves with a general purpose
to do well; and if they be careful on the Sabbath day to look to their heart,
tongue and ways, and keep within compass, yet that they ought and must thus do
on other days, few think. Hence it is that we fall into so many evils to Gods
dishonor, our own discomfort, the ill example of others, and reproach of our
profession: What though we have no purpose in the morning to do ill (as some
wicked have not) yet may we not through want of watchfulness fall ere we be
aware, as David and Judah.

2. Seeing this is a part of Gods Counsel, Use 2.
and he that bids we should not steal, should keep the Sabbath, etc. bids us
watch; let us know, its not safe for us to neglect it, when God has made known
the same to us: Is it not pity that such a blessed mean to further us so
sweetly to heaven through this world, should be so little known, and so few
have help by it? O if we would once enter upon it, it would save us from many
dangers, it would make our life fruitful: it would bring us so much unwonted
peace, as we would be so far from being weary of it, that we would be grieved
that we have been strangers from it so long, and came to the acquaintance and
use of it no sooner. O let us grieve and crave pardon for neglecting such a
necessary and profitable duty so long, and for the time to come be careful to
redeem the season.

Unto prayer.] Prayer must be added unto watchfulness.
We must add prayer to watchfulness, else what if we spy temptations coming,
and setting upon us? of our selves we have no power to resist the least of
them: We must therefore upon every occasion have recourse unto God by prayer;
Simil.
as Watchmen, if there come enemies in the time of War that be too strong for
them, they raise the City for help; and in our ordinary watches, if naughty
wretches come and set upon the watch, and be like to beat them down, they cry
out for help, and so subdue them, so must we: Temptations at some times come so
strong, as that we cannot deal with them, and therefore must cry to God for
help.

O that we could be much exercised in this duty of prayer! Use.
It keeps us in sobriety, helps our watchfulness, turns away evils, furthers us
in good, is the only mean to supply our wants, whether for soul or body. O
what a privilege is this! O the force and fruit of prayer! They that be much
in Prayer, obtain much grace and peace here, and shall find a large entrance
into the Kingdom of Heaven hereafter.

Verse. 8. And above all things, have fervent charity among your selves: for
charity shall cover the multitude of sins.
THe Apostle proceeds to other duties; for Christianity is a Tree that has
many branches, Simile.
and a true godly man must have respect to all; As a Tradesman must have a care
of every part of his Trade, and every point thereof, though happily he may be
more expert in some particulars then in others.

Above all things,] Not above the duties of the first Table, for that is the
first and great Commandment, but above all duties of the second Table, have a
care of love, which is a main and most necessary duty, without which there is no
society or living; have a care of it, as of a mother-duty, from whence others
will arise, as upon the wanting thereof, they also will be wanting; or thus,
Above all things, that is, Of all the loves that we owe, have a care of the
main, namely, Love to the Saints; for though we must love Strangers, Wicked
men, our Enemies, etc. yet must we must love the Saints above all.

Here we have 1. An Exhortation to love: 2. The manner of it. 3. A Reason to
enforce the same.

The Exhortation affords us this note, that

Love is a most excellent and necessary duty: Love is a most excellent and
necessary duty.
Hereof I have spoken at large on the 22 Verse of the first Chapter, where was
showed, both what love is, the high commendation thereof by its several
properties, with the means whereby to attain the same, etc.

Fervent] The manner or kind of love required, Love must be fervent.
a large, continued, stretched-out constant love: Simile.
As a cloth folded up is in a little room, but when it comes to be cut, is
stretched out into many men's uses; so our love must be stretched out to many
persons, to many duties; as in giving and doing good to body, soul, goods,
good-name, and that not sparingly, but liberally, so in forgiving both much and
often; neither must this be only when we can well do it, or when we have
nothing else to do, but when its against our profit, pleasure, ease, etc. so as
we neglect not our selves too much, and thereby more pleasure may be done our
neighbors, then hinderance come to us.

Reasons hereof may be these, Reasons.
1. Gods love toward us is fervent, and reaches out into innumerable favors,
for our bodies, souls, goods,

This is not such a love as that whereby the fornicator loves his harlot, Use.
one enemy to goodness loves another: This is not grounded upon any transitory
thing, or common gifts, but is for grace: We love thus, not for any
by-respects, but because God requires of us so to love; this is agreeable to
the Word of God, and therein we must principally aim at the good of our
neighbors souls: to persuade ones friend to that for preferment, which he
cannot do with a good conscience; or being sick, to persuade him to send for a
Cunningman or woman, or to dissuade him from suffering for a good conscience,
etc. is rather hatred then love: Had our Savior followed Peter's advice, and not
gone up to Jerusalem for to suffer, we had all perished eternally. But of this
before.

For charity shall cover the multitude of sins.] The Reason,

There will be through our corruption and frailty of nature, many offenses one
against another, therefore must we labor for love to cover them.

The Papists interpret the words thus, That our love to our neighbors will
merit at Gods hand forgiveness of our sins; but we are justified before God by
Faith in Christ Jesus, before we can do any good work; neither can we love God
or our neighbor for his sake, till we be assured of his love to us in pardoning
our sins. True, the more we love our brethren, the more we may be assured of
Gods mercy to us, and that we be pardoned, and that he will still show us
mercy, but not by desert: That opposition Prove. 10. 12. Hatred stirs up
strifes, but love covers all sins, shows plainly, that this is not the
meaning.

Faults that love covers, What sins love covers.
be of two sorts, namely, sins against God, and wrongs against our selves.

Against God, Sins against God.
whether they be natural infirmities or others, so they be not notorious acts,
or continued wicked courses of bad men; as love will not be suspicious, but
hope the best, till it know an evil committed, and interpret things charitably;
so those that be faults, yet love will not blaze them abroad, but keeps them
in, and admonishes the party; it utters them not where they be not known, to
his disgrace, and so uncovers his shame and rejoices therein, as Cham.

Against our selves; Sins against our selves.
for those that be small ones, it passes them by, takes no notice of them, but
treads them under foot; for those that be somewhat greater, it will be content
with any reason; for those that do touch us to the quick, in our names, and
goods, it will forgive the wrong and the revenge, but yet it may seek his own
right and due, and that by the benefit of the Magistrate; where note, that he
must see, 1. That it be not for trifles. On what respects we may seek redress
by the Magistrate
2. Not till all other ways more peaceable have been offered and refused. 3.
That its then without revenge to the party, or hatred, and without denying any
Christian duty to him; love will cover a multitude of these, committed by
sundry men, or ift be by the same party: As God covers our infirmities, and
accepts of our true desires; and Parents put up much at their Childrens hands,
and do not revenge themselves by beating them by and by; so must we by love
cover the infirmities one of another.

By both these its evident and plain, Use.
that there is but a little love in the world, and that our selves are very
short in this duty, whether we try it by covering of faults against our selves,
or of men's faults against God: O how the world rejoices to talk of the faults
of Professors! how will young Professors be censuring whom they like not? and
what censuring, and backbiting, and slandering is there of one another? what
telling tales and talking one of another?

That we may cover men's faults committed against God, How we may cover faults
committed against God.
we must 1. Mind our own matters. 2. Think of better things. 3. Rebuke the
tellers of such things, and stop our ears from hearing the same.

That we may cover their faults committed against us; Against our selves.
call to mind, 1. That we be subject to offend them, and need their
forgiveness. 2. That God requires it, who forgives us a multitude of sins. 3.
That there can be no better argument that our sins be forgiven, then our
forgiving of others; as there can be no better motive to God to show us mercy,
then for us to be merciful. 4. That Christ forgave those that wronged him.

If we can bear nothing, Use.
its a sign of little love: O that we could think it a glory to forgive and
pass by offenses, whereas we now count it a disgrace, and that we are no body,
if we revenge not: This hinders not, but that we may admonish each other, but
that the Magistrate may punish faults committed, but that the Minister may
preach against sin: Neither does this warrant that we should slatter or daub
one another, yet must not we point out a particular person, unless it be upon
an extraordinary occasion.

Verse 9. Use hospitallity one to another without grudging.
THis is an exhortation to a particular duty of love, we must be kind and
helpful to strangers, especially such as are in affliction, and persecuted for
Religion, we must harbor, receive, and comfort them at our houses, or otherwise
relieve them, if it be most profit to them; we must also be kind and helpful
to our own poor, especially the best disposed of them, comforting their bowels,
and refreshing them sometimes at our houses; we must also lovingly invite one
another to our houses for the further increase of love, and all this must be
cheerfully, without grudging.

In the exhortation, Use hospitallity one to another: we will speak of the
three preceding branches.

1. For strangers, We must be kind to strangers.
we must be kind to them, that being of other countries are in want or fly
for Religion, and come to us for shelter, which do either forsake their
Country for their conscience, or be thrust out of their Country, house and
home, especially for Religion: This is often commanded, as Exodus 22. 21. and
23. 9. Lev. 19. 33, 34. and 23. 22. Heb. 13. 2. Hereof Abraham, Let, Job, Booz,
Obadiah, Acts 11.
Rahab, the widow of Sarepta, the Shunomitish woman, Cornelius, Lydia, Romans 15.
27.
Gaius, Onesephirus, etc. were notable examples; so we read of some that
gathered for others, and sent unto them in their necessity: This Land has done
commendably this way, in relieving the French and Dutch.

Reasons. 1. God who requires this duty of us, is merciful, and accordingly
Obad. 10.
that is not to be endured; but we must help bear their burden, comfort their
hearts, refresh their bowels; Its enough for them that they are fain to forsake
Land, House, Friends, and all for Matthew. 10. 42.
He that receives a Prophet, etc. shall receive a Prophets reward; that is,
such a reward as a Prophet may be like by his office to help them to from the
Lord; so such a reward as a righteous man may help them to; look upon all the
forementioned examples, and they clear the same: Matthew. 25. 34.
But were there none here, that Scripture, Come ye blessed of my Father, would
suffice to draw us on to the performance of this duty.

O let us be ready in performing this duty, Use.
let us put to our helping hand, let us shore them up, that they s^ink not:
Neither must we thus do only to strangers of other Countries, but even to
those in our own Land, in the time of persecution; So also if we hear of their
great losses by fire, or otherwise (especially being authorized) let us extend
our charitable benevolence on them for their relief, and though we our selves
do not harbor them, yet if we help to build up or repair their Houses, etc. we
perform this duty: Sundry among us do something tollerably that way, but for
the mercies of others, they are cruel; Its a sign that those never tasted of
Gods mercy, which are altogether without the bowels of mercy.

Obj. O but if I could happen upon Angels in entertaining strangers, then would
I like well of it.

Answ. We do after a sort entertain Angels, for they attend about those whom we
harbor, and the House is the stronger that night, as Lots was; yea, we
entertain more then Angels: For he that receives one of these little ones,
receives me, says Christ: Who would not be ready to lodge Jesus Christ, if he
were here?

If I could obtain a Son, Obj.
having none, or being dead, to have him raised from death to life, as the
Shunamite, by the means of strangers, or have my friends and servants restored
to health, I could like well to entertain them.

Gods Servants may obtain for us as great things as these, Sol.
nay greater, even such things as may be for the good, both of our own souls
and theirs.

And if even those which in likelihood have done thus only in civil courtesy
have not been unrewarded, how much less shall they, which do it for Conscience
sake?

2. For our own poor: The regard we are to have of our own poor.
Its best to maintain them at their own houses, with that which their own labor
will not attain, and not suffer them to go from door to door, except when they
bring home their work, or come out upon occasion of some sickness, to make
known their necessities: But many are forced out, as being neglected at home.
Besides their maintenance at home, its meet also for them of ability now and
then to bid them home to their houses, to warm them at their fires; and that
not only at the Festival time of the Nativity of our Lord Christ, but upon
other occasions, as the day of our deliverance from the Powder Treason, etc. So
its meet, that every Lords day we should take home with us a poor body or two,
who are best minded, most diligent in their Callings, bring up their Children
well, etc. to encourage them in goodness, Luke 14. 13.
and that they may bear their burden the more cheerfully: Isa. 58. 7.
This is even in special enjoined to us, and required of us; Job 31. 17.
and thus doubtless did both Abraham and Job.

But how are the poor by most in most places neglected? Whence it is that the
poor are so much neglected.
Hereof there are two chief causes: 1. Wicked Covetousness, which has so
prevailed with some, that they are mad for the world, and insatiable, thinking
all lost that goes besides themselves: Some rich keep no house; some have many
Farms, and for any good they do, it were better they had none; some live basely
and miserably, etc. 2. Pride in building, apparel, sumptuous diet, whereby they
are drawn so dry, that nothing is to be had of them: For the former, they covet
an ill covetousness to their own house, it being the way to pull it down; and
for the latter, their bravery will be turned into rags: God blesses not the
Children of either the one or other; The Fathers being ill Tenants, and not
paying their Rent, God will turn out the Children. O how many, by sparing more
then is right, come to poverty? James 2. 13.
Being merciless, they shall have judgment without mercy; stopping their ears
at the cry of the poor, Prove. 21. 13.
they themselves shall cry, and not be heard: They send away the poor, as Nabal
did David's messengers, and bid them Go, etc. and it shall be said to them at
the last day, Go ye cursed, etc. If thou would be merciful to the poor, thou
might be blessed in all thou put thine hands unto; if thou would sow
liberally, thou might reap liberally; thy Children might be blessed, Acts 9. 29.
thou might have a good name, and be mourned for, as Dorcas; thou should
not partake in the evil to come, thou should hear a joyful Sentence on the
last day.

3. For inviting one another: Inviting of one another, how useful.
Its a means for watering love, much good comes by it, and the contrary
strangeness does hurt: In many places its neglected, and that out of pride; for
they cannot or will not meet, but with so great cost and variety, that men be
the worse for it a quarter after; if Christians would meet like Christians, for
society, and not for meat, and be content with one dish or two, it were much
better, and then it might be oftener.

This duty is required of Ministers (and that elsewhere particularly) as well
as others: Ministers must use hospitality.
for, they be fittest to counsel and comfort strangers, are easily found out,
and must go before their people in the practice of that they teach, and shall
thus both provoke others the better, and make a way for their Ministry in the
hearts of the poor.

If it be thus, Use.
then it was doubtless Gods mind, That a Minister should have wherewithal,
even a competent maintenance for himself and his, and to do good to others.

Its the conceit of some, That a Minister should live but meanly, and as it
were from hand to mouth; and accordingly they do so pole from him, that he can
do no good this way. But though they should not be pompous nor sumptuous, nor
rake after farms and wealth, yet they must and ought to live in good sort, as
well as themselves: Such as have skill in the Scriptures, or have profited by
the word, or reverence the Calling of the Ministry, will not otherwise judge:
For us, if we cannot do as we would, we must do as we can; nor having ability,
must we bid set on the great pot, in the mean while starving our peoples souls.

Without grudging,] God looks no less on one manner of doing, then on the duty.
The manner; This is all in Gods account: He will have the work done after his
fashion, else its to no purpose, though happily it be as costly and painful as he
requires; to come to the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, be good duties, none
better, but the heart wherewith they be performed, and manner of doing, is all
in all: See Isa. 1. 11. and 58. 5.
As the Gallants of our times, though the matter of the Garment be never so
good or costly, Simile.
regard it not, if it be not of the fashion; so in duties, the Lord looks to
the manner how they are performed.

This of mercy must be done without grudging, Works of mercy must be done
without grudging.
that is, willingly, cheerfully, without murmuring or repining: God loves a
cheerful giver; Romans 12. 8.
He respects the widows mite thus given: The people offered freely to the
building of the Tabernacle and Temple, 2 Cor. 9. 7.
and accordingly should we do in these works of mercy.

Its a great fault, Use.
not of the world only, but even of Christians, that are brought very hardly
and heavily to perform these duties; we ought to be so far from being grieved
at them, as we ought to be glad when any occasion is offered this way.

That we do the same cheerfully, How we may thus do.
let us do it in faith, even be assured, 1. That its pleasing and acceptable to
God. 2. That he will reward it abundantly; were this increased in us, we would
be glad of any opportunity to manifest the fruits thereof.

Verse 10. As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same one
to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
OUr Apostle yet proceeds in the argument of love, and because it were too
long to exhort particularly to every duty of love, he puts here all together in
one, requiring that every one do communicate what gifts soever he has, and in
what kind or measure soever; He must not keep it to himself, but distribute it
to the good of his brethren, the Church and Commonwealth; and seeing God has
given us those gifts for this end, and made us not owners, but stewards and
dispensers of them, and such as must give account of the same, which well
follows upon the former Exhortation, That nothing be done with grudging, we
have no cause to grudge at what we do.

This Exhortation is general to all sorts of men whatsoever; though in the next
place he instanceth in some particular duties of Church Officers, as Ministers
and Overseers of the Poor.

Here we have, 1. An Exhortation, to minister, to be doing service. 2. The
manner, according to our gift whatsoever it be, which is described by the author
of it, or means how we have it, we have received it. 3. The generallity of
persons which are thus to minister, every man. 4. A Reason, because we are but
Stewards.

As every man has received the gift,] Here note,

1. That every one has some gift or other to do good with, Every man has some
gift or other wherewith to do good.
and whereby he may be profitable, as authority, wisdom, wealth, knowledge, and
the like; as there is no member in the body, but has his gift fit to do good
in the body, Simile.
not a finger, or toe, nay, the least joint of the least toe serves for the
more steady walking, without which the body were lame, Simile.
we could not go so firmly. As every one of the Servants had some of the
talents, and he that had least had one; So, though one may have a more
excellent gift, or greater measure thereof then another, yet every man has
some or other.

Let none then be discouraged as some be: Use.
O I do no good, there is no use of my being in the world, I am a poor man or
woman, have neither Wealth, Wisdom, Knowledge, nor Authority, and so live like
an unprofitable burden: Deceive not thy self, if thou were even a carnal
person, yet there were use of thee; but of every one that fears God, there is
special use, and thou do and may do good many ways; Thou do good in
following thy Calling whatsoever it is: Also thou have some Children, or a
little family, if thou bring them up in the fear of God, that they may prove
profitable instruments in the Church or Commonwealth, herein thou art of good
use. Besides, a poor man may give as good a lift at Prayer, as the rich* Thou
may also do much good by thy good example, patience i^ adversity, diligence
in thy calling, contentedness in thine Estate, and the like; so by counselling,
admonishing, exhorting, comforting, and visiting thy poor and sick Neighbors:
Be not discouraged then, but lay out the gift thou have, and thou shall please
God as highly as they that have more. There are, indeed, some profane minded
men, that say, For these poor folks, what use are they of? they do no good; if
there were a thousand of them out of the way, it were a good turn; they do
nothing but spend that other folks get: Thus will some miserable minded men
say. But if they were carnal, yet are they of use, have skill one way or other;
neither should thou grudge at their life, but rather wish that they may live
and mend: If they be godly, they do more good then thou do, notwithstanding
of all thy riches; therefore let none despise any, as the eye despises not the
hand or foot.

2. That every one has a several and diverse gift, Every one has (as it were)
a several or diverse gift.
as it were; some for Magistracy, as Courage, Wisdom, Policy; some for the
Ministry, as Knowledge, Interpretation of Scripture, the gift of utterance,
Exhortation, Love, Zeal, etc. Some to be householders, some skill in Physic,
Husbandry, Law, Merchandising, etc. Every one has not the same, Simile.
neither has one man all: As a General of a Field disposes of his men, all be
Soldiers, but not all of one kind; some be Horsemen, some be Footmen, and of
these some Pikemen, some Musketeers; so has God disposed of men severally: And
this God has done, for the knitting us together in love, that none might be
lifted up above all others, nor despise any, each being of use in his place:
None can live of himself, none without the help of others; The Prince not
without the Subject, nor the Subject without the Prince; Ministers have their
maintenance from the people, people through their preaching attain Faith to the
salvation of their souls; The rich wants skill, neither are able to do their
own work, therefore employ the poor about it, and relieve them; The Lawyer
cannot be without the Clyent, nor the Physician live without Patients; The
Merchant cannot be without the Clothier, nor the Husbandman without the
Tradesman, each must partake of the others gift.

As therefore we should praise God for such variety of his gifts, Use.
and for his wisdom in distributing the same; so we should not be lifted up, or
wax insolent, to the despising one of another: If thou have some gift that
others have not, they have also some that thou have not; If they need thee,
thou also stand in need of them; say not of thy Minister, He lives of us;
if thou be as thou ought, thou live by him: so, as the poor cannot be
without thee, thou can not well be without them.

3. That whatsoever we have fit to do good with, God bestows gifts on us
freely.
its a free gift of God; we came naked into the world, without any goodness,
even the least good is of God, any thing that may be called good: They were all
freely given Adam, See Iam. 1. 17.
much more now, since our rebellion and sin; Dan. 5. 18.
if it be honor and authority, Psalm. 65. 6.
its God that gives it; if gifts to rule and govern, that's also of God; if of
the Ministry, Christ ascended, See Ephesians. 4. 8:
and gave gifts to men; Is it wealth? Job tells you That he had his from God;
Job 1. 21.
yea, to have a heart to distribute it well, is Gods gift: 1 Chronicles. 29. 13, 14.
So to be skilful in any Trade, as about gold, silver, brass, wood, stone (as
were Bazaleel and Aholiab) is the gift of God.

Let us not then stand in Gods light, Use.
by arrogating any thing to our selves; as if the poor man should say, or any
other, I have nothing, but what I have got with my fingers end, never any
friend I had gave me a penny, etc. what thou have is Gods gift, many a one has
taken as much care and pains as thou have, who yet have mist of that thou have
got. So if any Gentleman shall say, My Lands have been in one stock since the
Conquest, I am beholding to no Prince for it, therefore none ought to require
of me to give out of it, but as I list my self: Alas, what if it be so as thou
say, yet its Gods free gift; for thou have made many forfeitures, whereby
thou have deserved to have it taken away: for any thing thou have, any Land,
Living, Place, Skill, give glory to God for it; thou have no cause to be proud,
what have thou which thou ha^^ not received? were it not absurd for one to brag
of a borrowed suit of apparel, as if it were his own, and he were able to
maintain the like: He that gave it thee, found thee without it, unworthy of it,
and could have given it to any other, and can yet take it from thee, and give
it another; nay, rather be humble, because of of the account: As the Master of
the Talents called his Servants to an account, so will the Lord call thee; To
whom much is given, of him is much required: The more gifts and the greater,
the more is thine account; thou art the farther in debt, and therefore should
be the less proud.

As every man has received the gift, even so minister the same etc.] Here Is
the main duty required; every man must be faithful in communicating the gift
which he has received, and after that measure that he has received it.

For the kind; Christians must communicate their gifts for the good of others
Though a Christian be the freest man in the world (as being freed from Satan,
Sin, Hell, the Law, etc.) yet is he to be of all others the most serviceable;
He must employ his gifts as a member of the body for the good of the whole; He
must not put his light under a bushel, nor hide his Talent in a Napkin: The
Magistrate must administer justice duly and truly, relieve the oppressed, judge
the fatherless, defend the widow, break the jaws of the wicked, etc. as he who
bears not the sword in vain: The Minister must do service with his gift,
Preaching in season, out of season, etc. The Householder must instruct and train
up his Family, employing all the wit and knowledge he has to this end, See
Deuteronomy. 6. 6.
as Abraham, he must pray with them, and go before them in an holy example: The
Husband must minister his gift, by living with his wife as a man of knowledge,
etc. The wife must live in subjection and build up her house, and as a mother
lay out her breasts for her young ones, if God has given her milk and strength:
The Servant must put out his gift in his business, and not be idle, untrusty,
an eye-servant, etc. He that has knowledge must teach the ignorant, admonish
the disordered, exhort them that begin to slack, comfort the heavy, etc. If any
has wealth, he must distribute thereof as need requires; If any have skill in
Physic, or in any thing that is useful to man, yea, or to beast, they must
minister it; nay, there is not the meanest work done in faith and for
conscience, which pleases not God, as a Preacher in the Pulpit, or Magistrate
on the Bench.

Reasons. 1. As the Sun shines not for it self, nor the Earth bear for it self;
so have not we our a gift for our selves, but for the common 2 Cor. 9. 6.
shall reap liberally. (...)

1. This rebukes those that employ not their gift at all, Use 1.
and that either through discontentedness, because its not so great as they
would, or others have (but he is unworthy of more that will not make use of one
talent, one well used would increase) or through envy, as desiring to be
singular; or through laziness, both Magistrates, Ministers, Hous-holders, etc.
failing this way; these are warts and scabs, no true members of the body,
droans; and not true laboring Bees.

2. It rebukes those which employ their gifts, Use 2.
not for the common good, but merely for their own private advantage; as most
men would not work, or employ themselves in a calling, were it not for their own
ends, and to grow rich; thus were it base and mercenary in a Minister to Preach
for filthy lucre: thus many do their work, and make their wares so slightly and
deceitfully, that others are thereby cousened, though themselves be enriched.

3. It rebukes such as do hurt with their gifts; Use 3.
as if a Magistrate by his authority would pervert judgment, See Mic. 7. 3.
oppress the righteous, maintain bad causes or persons, Ezekiel. 13. 8, 9, etc.
etc. If a Minister would by his preaching discourage the godly, and strengthen
the hands of the wicked; If a Lawyer would employ his wit and skill to find
quirks and quillers to hinder a good cause, or make good a naughty matter; If a
Chyrurgion would keep his Patient long in pain, and keep back his cure, that he
might gain the more by him; If a strong man would abuse his strength to pour in
strong drink; If a wealthy man would abuse his means to oppress his inferiors,
hunt good men out of their places, set up disorder and riot, etc. If such as
have wit, would abuse it in devising mischief; If any having knowledge in the
Scriptures, would cavil against the truth, defend sin, give ill counsel to
others, etc. might they not be taxed for ministering their gifts cursedly? It
had been happy not only for others, but even for themselves (as whose
condemnation will be the greater) that they had never had these gifts; If even
he that hid his talent, doing no good therewith, was so severely punished, and
if even the fig tree was cursed that did ba^e no fruit, then what shall become
of them that bring forth bad fruit, that employ their talents for the hurt of
others? Even here judgments do attend them: They shall not be established upon
Earth; Psalm. 140. 11.
they shall hot live out half their days, evil shall hunt them to destruction.

For the measure*] Every man must minister according to the measure received.
Every man must minister according to the measure he has received; having
received much, he must not minister a little; he that had five Talents, was
called to an account for five; to whom men commit much, from them they look for
the more.

Obj. Obj.
The Apostle says, If there be a willing mind, God accepts of a man, 2 Cor.
8. 12.
according to that he has.

Answ. True, Sol.
it is not beyond that he has, but according to that he has, he does and will
account with men.

This rebukes those that having received much, Use.
yet care not how little they distribute: Many men of great knowledge, yet
preach very seldom; many rich men by concealing their Estates, or by
friendship, are but a little in taxes and subsidies; so also they can hold some
down in rates, though they put up others, and yet think all this clear gains;
its clear theft and wrong, will God take an unequal account? will he take
account of men without regard of what he put into their hands? He will not:
Simile.
Most men's accounts will be as if a Steward should receive Five hundred pounds,
and bring in his layings out but half that or thereabouts, would it be
received? it would not, neither shall theirs.

As good stewards,] We are but stewards of the gifts we have.
We are but disposers or stewards of the gifts we have; therefore must not we
keep them to our selves, or count them ours, Use.
as stewards we must employ them, and that cheerfully, why should the steward
grudge to lay out that he has taken in, seeing its his masters appointment,
whose the money is? Thou have wealth, and do account it thine own, and say
that thou may do with thine own as it pleases thee; 1 Cor. 4. 7.
but thou art deceived, what have thou which thou have not received?

Good,] We must be faithful in our places.
Men love to be counted true in that they are trusted with, we therefore must
so minister, that we may be found faithful stewards, that when the day of
account comes, we may hear that sentence, Well done, good and faithful servant:
Such as let their gifts rust, or employ them to the hurt of others, are far
from being good Stewards, and will indeed be rewarded as evil and unfaithful
servants: Use.
O look to it, all of us must give an account, Magistrates, Ministers, etc.
that it may be to our comfort.

Of the manifold grace of God.] Gods gifts manifold.
Though God be one, yet his gifts and graces be manifold; common gifts, as
Authority, Wealth, Wit, Knowledge, etc. How many Creatures have we for food,
Beasts, Fishes, See Psalm. 104. 24.

Verse 11. If any man speak, let him speak as the Oracles of God: If any man
minister, let him do it as of the ability which God gives, that God in all
things may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom be praise and dominion
for ever and ever, Amen.
THe Apostle descends from general, to particular Exhortations, and
instanceth in some main and principal gifts, which be of greatest use; namely,
Gifts and Offices in the Church, toward the souls and bodies of the people of
God: and that not only for their good, but that God might be glorified in all
his gifts, through Jesus Christ; of whom, and his gifts bestowed upon us, when
he speaks, he cannot but break out into a hearty thanksgiving, desiring, and
that fervently, that all praise and dominion may be given to him for ever and
ever.

Here we have an Exhortation, a Confirmation, a Conclusion.

The Exhortation is unto Ministers by name, to preach the Word of God, and as
the Word of God; and to other Church Officers, under a general term, that they
are to dispense their gifts, according to the gift bestowed upon them.

Now in that the Apostle contents not himself with the general Exhortation in
which Ministers were included, but names them particularly, we may note, that

The Office and Calling of the Ministry is of all others the most needful and
necessary: The Calling of the Ministry is of all others the most needful.
Its the gift of Prophecy to understand the Scriptures, to be able to open and
apply the same, is an excellent gift, as in respect of him that has it, so as
the Ordinance of God to work Faith, and convert Souls. It were pitiful if
Magistrates should neglect their Office, Householders theirs, or any other, to
employ his gift for the good of his brethren (for then would all things come to
confusion) but the neglect of the Ministry were yet worse, as being the means
whereby those may learn their duties: The souls of people depend on the
Ministry; and where Prophecy fails, the people perish. Hence it is, that
when the Lord promised great favors to his people, Ier. 3. 15.
he promised them faithful Ministers; Mat. 9. 36.
and our Savior, in love to his people the Jews, See Ezekiel. 3. 36 and 7. 26.
sent his Apostles among them, pitying them as sheep which were scattered, and
wanting a Shepherd: where on the contrary, Amos 5. 13. and 8. 11.
no greater judgment could befall them, then the want of such faithful
Shepherds, Zech. 11. 16.
or the having of unfaithful: Can Laborers, Husbandmen, Plowmen, Builders,
Watchmen, Shepherds, and such others, be spared in a Commonwealth? Who knows
not the use of them? Such are Gods Ministers in respect of our souls.

This teaches Ministers to be faithful and painful in their places: Use.
The honor is great, the trust much, to be the Lords Ambassadors in such high
matters, and to have the charge of Souls; Here is no dallying, the greater our
place is, the more must be our diligence; we are employed about a worthy work,
and accordingly must labor in the Word and Doctrine, for the gaining of Souls:
Hereupon follows an incorruptible Crown: Contrary, if we be unfaithful and
negligent, as we sin in the highest degree, in so deep trust, and do so great
hurt, our answer must needs be fearful, 2 Cor. 2. 16.
which made Paul say, Who is sufficient for these things? And godly men have
been in this Calling with much fear and trembling; without doubt wicked
Ministers as they are the Factors for the Devils Kingdom, they have more to
answer for, then either unfaithful Magistrates, Householders, Lawyers,
Physicians, etc. nay, then those that rob and murder by the Highway; for
these kill a few, and but men's bodies, but those murder many, and their souls,
their peoples blood will be required at their hands; were this considered, men
would neither so rashly and unadvisedly run into the Ministry, nor so loosly
and idly live therein.

2. It teaches people to esteem the Ministry as the most necessary gift of
all others, Use. 2.
as that whereon the winning and losing of their souls depends, and which is
appointed for Salvation; and accordingly they must regard it, make use of it,
and endeavor to profit by it, for their Humiliation, Conversion, Sanctification.

3. It rebukes numbers of blind people in the world, Use. 3.
that think of all gifts, the Ministry might be best spared, especially those
preaching Ministers, that have (as they say) a deal of Tithes and maintenance,
and that they could like as well a Reader, that would be content with a small
stipend, etc. O these unsavory Earthworms know not the worth of their souls,
and therefore savor not the things that pertain to the salvation thereof: Thus
indeed our Commodities in most places are deadest, and of least price and
regard; some few wise Merchants thank God for our Ministry, and highly value
it: Well, know that thy foul, the best jewel thou have, depends on the
Ministry of the Word; if ever it shall be saved, it must be by means hereof,
whereby thou may as well renounce thy felf, as lay hold on Christ for
Salvation.

If any man speak, Whosoever is in the Ministry ought to preach.
etc.] Whosoever is in the Ministry, ought to Preach; no gift makes a man a
Minister allowed of God, but the gift of preaching, even to be able to open the
Scriptures soundly, and apply the same wisely to the peoples edifying: Romans 10.
14.
How shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? (says the Apostle)
and how shall they hear without a preacher? and how shall they Preach, except
they be sent? That is, gifted and quallified by God for the place, even being
able to do that which is apt to convert souls, which no gift else can do, but
that of preaching the Word; Simile.
The Scriptures read, are but as a goodly Carpet folded up together, Matthew. 10.
7.
but by preaching, 2 Timothy 4. 2.
the beauty thereof appears; This our Savior enjoined his Disciples, and the
same did the Apostle Paul require of Timothy.

1. This rebukes those, Use 1.
which (howsoever having an outward calling, they stand in the room of
Ministers, and therefore their actions are not to be counted void or nullities)
run before they are sent, are blind watchmen, Messengers without an errand,
dumb Dogs, as Idols, having mouths, but speak not, etc.

2. This rebukes a number of silly people, Use 2.
which conceive it sufficient if their Minister be but a Reader: We have a very
honest man, will such say; true, he cannot preach, but he does his good will,
and we can desire no more of a man, and a very fellow-like man he is, etc. But
if it happen they have a godly Preacher, what is their note then? we have a
Minister, I would we had never known him; some say he is learned, and he
preaches indeed, but he is so troublesome, he has spoiled our Town quite, we
were all as quiet as could be till he came, but now there is such finding of
faults, and bringing up new Orders, as we cannot tell what to say; a good many
of the best of the Parish will do what they can to remove him, etc. Thus the
world loves reading Ministers; They say of Scholars, they be the most
conscionable; They care not how little they have for their money, but its true
also of a number of silly miserable people; They can have no more of a man then
his good will, they say: But they would not say so of a Carpenter, or any
Workman or Servant they hire; if they do not the business they are set about,
they would have others.

Let him speak as the Oracles of God,] That is, both Preach the very Truth and
Word of God, and as its meet, or as it becomes the Word to be handled.

Ministers must Preach the Word of God, Ministers must Preach the Word of God.
they must not deliver any thing to their people, but that which they have
received of God; So did both the Prophets and Apostles, they stand in Gods
room, and are to bring his Message. neither must they deliver any word, whereof
they may not truly affirm, Thus says the Lord, This is the Word of the Lord:
Nothing else feeds the soul, other things are poison or chaff; yea, we may
answer for what we say before God, upon our salvation or damnation.

1. This reproves diverse, Use 1.
as namely, such as by their erroneous Doctrine destroy souls; they give in
stead of an egg, a scorpion, and for food, poison; Such as by telling strange
and forged miracles of this and that Saint, endeavor to uphold one lie of
Popery or other; Such as teach men's traditions, or their own devices and
opinions, contrary to Gods Word; Such as wrest the Word of God, and discourage
the hearts of the godly, and strengthen the hands of the wicked, making their
Text speak what God never meant; Such as Preach Gods Word, but so mingled with
man's inventions, as they Preach not Gods Word but their own fancies: Thus many
stuff their Sermons with Authorities of men, as of Heathen Poets, Philosophers,
Historians, and that in strange tongues, which though turned into English, yet
what a loss of time, what a breaking of the peoples attention must there needs
be hereby? what thrusting upon people men's authority? use indeed may be made of
those in private, and humanity serves as well as an handmaid to Divinity, but
its Gods Word only which can stablish the Conscience; If we use them
publicly, the same must be done sparingly, to special purpose, on some
special occasions (as when we have to do with Atheists, etc.) and not to the
common people.

2. This may instruct people, Use 2.
that they hear nothing, at least receive nothing but the Word of God; John 10.
17.
My sheep hear my voice, says our Savior, 1 Thessalonians 5. 21.
and a strangers voice they will not hear: 1 John 4. 1.
Therefore they must be able to try what they hear; we must not be like
children, carried about with every wind of doctrine: Solomon counts it the
property of a fool, to believe every thing; if we should, in stead of being
fed, we might be poisoned: Acts 17. 11.
we must, with the Bereans, search whether the things we hear be so and so;
they were neither curious nor captious, yet they would receive nothing but the
truth. A man may tell money after his own Father, not because he thinks he
would deceive him, but because he may be deceived: we take not upon us to have
dominion over your Faith, that you should believe whatsoever we say, because we
say it; but if it be not according to Gods Word, take it but upon exchange: All
that we hear, and Ministers deliver, must be according to the Scriptures, which
is the rule and touchstone; and when people have knowledge, and can try what we
^each, we should be far from being angry, and saying, It was never merry world
since every Tailor and Shoemaker could talk so much of the Scriptures, and
find faults with men's preaching; would we have the peoples eyes out? True, the
Papists cannot abide it in the people, but tell them, They must believe as
their Ministers believe, etc. This is as bad a sign in them as may be: But
alas, we have cause to complain of peoples ignorance; it were even just with
God to let them fall into the hands of deceivers, as having got no knowledge
all this while.

Ministers must preach as it becomes the Word of God, Ministers must so preach
as it becomes the Word of God.
even with all reverence and authority, with all courage and boldness; yea so,
as that they declare by their lives, that they believe it to be Gods Word, even
by being first in the practice thereof, and obedience thereto.

1. This serves to reprove diverse; Use 1.
as namely, those that mingle tricks and conceits to tickle the ear, and are
all in their Inkhorn terms, riming, and running on the letter, etc. together
with those that have itching ears, and delight in such things. Its a sign of a
sickly ill disposed stomach, to whom the wholesome food of the Word is not
sweet, except it have some such strumpetly sawces. Those that through sear keep
back Gods counsel, not revealing his whole will; those that live daily in the
same sins which they rebuke in others, not fearing those judgments which they
denounce on others, nor doing those duties they call for of others; these, as
the Scribes and Pharisees, are blind guides; these make the people think,
Preaching is but for a fashion, and they must speak somewhat when they be in
place, but its not to be regarded; for if it were, they would not do thus and
thus themselves: Thus, as Eli's Sons, they make the Lords people loath the
Sacrifice of the Lord; yet must not people thus stumble: Do as they say, See
Psalm. 50. 16
take the good, and leave the ill: men will take up money out of the dirt. Romans
2. 21.
Miserable is the condition of such Ministers as give this foul offense, weak
are those people that take it.

2. This may instruct people, Use 2.
1. To be duly prepared by prayer, ere they come to the hearing of the Word;
being come, they must with all reverence attend thereto. Its Gods Word they
hear, the Lord himself with whom they have to do: O how few come thus! nay,
most men behave not themselves so well as they should, to a man advising them
of good will: Acts 10.
There are now few such as Cornelius; want of preparation is one main cause why
so few profit by hearing: How many hear unreverently, or as if they were weary
and sleepy? Is this to hear it as the Word of God? Hence it is that men, not
taking notice of their miserable and damnable state, or that the way to Heaven
is so strait, content themselves with their present state; Would not men be
thrust out of doors, if they did so before their Prince, should he speak unto
them? 2. People must not be afraid to frequent and attend on the Word preached,
they must not be ashamed hereof. 3. They must show their account hereof, by
their obedience hereto: O look to it, you have not to do with us, that cannot
tell when you be gone hence, whether or not you practice the same; but you have
to do with God, whose Word you hear, who will go hence with you, and knows your
sitting down, Psalm. 139. 3.
and your rising up, yea, and all your ways, and both can and will deal with
you accordingly. In the fear of God let us look better to this, and resolutely
set down with our selves, That whenever we come to hear the Word, See Exodus
20.
we come to hear God himself speaking to us: If it were not so, we durst not
speak it for our lives; the matter concerns us no less then you.

If any men minister,] He proceeds to other Offices in the Church, and ayms,
no doubt, at them whose Office it was to distribute and look to the poor: The
word minister, signifies to do service, and so may be taken more generally;
even every man in his Office and Calling must be a minister to his brethren:
The Magistrate is so called, Romans 13. 4. and so the Exhortation also may
concern them: However, the point may be this, that

All that have Office one way or other in the Church, All that bear Office in
the Church must do the same faithfully.
must do the same faithfully; we have them that answer in some sort to the
Officers in the Primitive Church, Churchwadens must look to men's Manners, and
spy what is amiss, who profane the Lords day, neglect the worship of God, be
idle and riotous, etc. These they must admonish, and if thereupon they amend
not, complain of them; Constables must suppress filthy houses, break the knots
of lewd persons, prevent and root out disorder to the utmost of their power;
The Overseers of the poor ought to be wise and faithful, and not think it
enough to take money with one hand, See Acts 6. 3.
and pay it out with the other; but they must distribute it with wisdom to
every one, Acts 11. 29.
according to their need, to the best, Romans 15. 26, 28
most, and with best encouragement, to the other, with gentle rebuke and
admonition; even those of best quality, report and credit have been entrusted
with this business: There are prophaners of the Lords day, such as then lie in
bed, and regard not the House of God; There are Swearers, Railers, Riotous
persons, such as bring not up their Children in any Calling; There are idle
persons, etc. these would be well looked to, and often admonished, and no more
given them, then needs must; There Is a company of idle Wenches which keep at
home with their friends where there is no need of them, or crowd into one house
or other, and live at their own hand, and that either because of idleness they
refuse to go to service, or having been in service, because they may not do as
they list, they will no longer be Servants, but live by themselves; This is a
foul and dangerous abuse, not to be suffered in Towns: Headboroughs and chief
men in Towns ought to provoke Officers to their duty, and encourage them doing
well, yea, countenance and stand by them, as whom God has lifted up for this
end.

1. This rebukes the exceeding coldness and carelessness of Officers that take
no pains to prevent or redress disorder; Use 1.
Thus Overseers think it enough if they gather and pay out the money, and bring
in a true account, what is this? It were hard if men should rob the Poor, a curse
would follow it, but for looking into their state and manners, and with
relieving their bodies to do good to their souls, Who does this? This is rare
indeed; But if we have an office, we must wait on our office, we are not
altogether born for our selves: Every office is an honor, Romans 12. 7.
and carries a burden along with it; we must bestow some time thereon, its not
lost, God will requite it; and cursed is he that does his work negligently,
Ier. 48. 10.
though others have been careless, and though happily you may be counted more
busy and curious then needs, yet whether your office be great or small, set
your selves with care and diligence about it: Hereby much good will come to the
Town and Poor in particular, God shall be glorified, and you shall reap much
comfort, with a good report in Gods Church.

2. This bewrays a great fault in Towns, Use 2.
for making choice of such to Offices, as be no way fit nor careful to execute
them; A common practice; The chief men shift them from themselves: Solomon
says, Prove. 26. 6.
He that sends a message by the hand of a fool (that is, one unfit for it) it
as he that cutteth off the feet; That is, as he that cuts off a man's feet, and
then bids him go, when he has not wherewith.

As of the ability which God gives,] Ability to discharge ones calling is of
God.
All ability to discharge any Office or Calling, comes from God; we have no
wisdom or ability this way of our selves, every good gift is from above: God
gave Saul another heart, that is, fit to rule, which he had not before; and
Solomon craved of God a wise and an understanding heart; and as Magistracy is
of God, so the Ministers Office, so the Deacons, so others.

1. Call upon God for endowments for such places as he calls thee to. Use 1.


2. Having any ability for the discharge thereof, Use 2.
give the glory to God the giver thereof. 1 Chronicles. 29. 14.


That God in all things may be glorified,] The Confirmation, or Reason why we
ought to do our duties faithfully, even that we may thereby glorify God. Hence
note,

1. That God is glorified in the careful performance of our duties in our
places; The conscionable performance of our duties tend to gods glory.
He is glorified by a Magistrates wise, zealous and impartial execution of
Justice; for hereby sin is curbed, sinners it may be brought to repentance, the
poor and innocent comforted, and so stirred up to praise God for his Ordinance
of Magistracy: So when Ministers are faithful in their places, the ignorant are
enlightened, the wicked humbled, the heavy in heart comforted, the weak
strengthened, the drowsy awakened, and so have cause (as many do daily) to
praise God highly for the ministry of his Word; Thus Householders in their
places, husbands and wives in theirs, the rich by their liberality and
hospitality; See 1 Timothy 6. 1.
nay, even Servants by their conscionable discharge of their places, may
glorify God.

1. This should provoke us much to faithfulness in our places; Use 1.
not only others shall have good, our selves comfort and a good report, but
God shall be glorified, which is most of all, and the end of all things, and we
may think our selves happy that God will be honored by any thing we can do.

2. How much are those blameworthy, Use 2.
which do not at all regard the faithful discharge of their places, whether
they be Magistrates, Ministers, or others? whosoever cares not for Gods glory, God
will set as little by them and theirs; nay, there are some which can see God
dishonored before their faces, and might redress it, but do it not; yea, some
which do even dishonor God with their gifts, and in their offices: assuredly
God will meet with these in his due time.

2. That the mark whereat we must aim at in our places, We must aim in our
places at Gods glory.
is to glorify God.

This rebukes those that are wholly for themselves, 1 Cor. 10. 31.
aim altogether at base, Use.
sinister, carnal ends, profit, pleasure, credit, and the like, They are
thieves robbing God of his due; They are treacherous, as if one sent to woo for
another, and had Jewels given him for that purpose (as Abraham's Servant) and
should make suit for himself: All waters come from the Sea, Eccles. 1. 7.
and return thither; so should all our gifts be employed to the glory of the
giver.

Through Jesus Christ,] All glory comes to God by Jesus Christ.
All glory comes to God by Jesus Christ, for its by him that we receive all
grace, and whatsoever good we enjoy; He having suffered for our sins, and
reconciled us to the Father, has thereby purchased for us whatsoever is good,
grace and glory, to whom alone we are beholding for all.

1. This teaches us to be exceeding thankful for Christ, Use 1.
as without whom we could not have right to any thing we enjoy, without whom it
were even fearful to think of God.

2. It teaches us to labor to be united to Christ by faith, Use 2.
that whatsoever good we need we may receive, as the members from the head.

To whom be praise, etc.] Having instructed others in the faithful discharge of
their duties in their places, and that especially that God might be glorified;
He now wishes and prays that all glory and praise may be given to him, and
that for ever, testifying the servency of his affection, and his assent thereto
by the word Amen.

But of this hereafter.

Verse 12. Beloved, think it not strange, concerning the fiery trial, which is
to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you. Verse 13. But
rejoice, in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings, that when his
glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy.
HAving exhorted us to be good Christians, he now arms us to the Cross, the
inseparable companion of true godliness ( for all that will live godly in
Christ Jesus, shall suffer persecution) and that both patiently and cheerfully,
which accordingly he backeth by many forcible Reasons.

Each of these Verses contains an Exhortation, with a Reason to enforce the
same.

In the former Exhortation, consider both the manner how its propounded, and the
matter therein contained.

Beloved,] Here Is the manner; He writes lovingly to them, and that doubtless
from an entire affection and love which he bare them. Here note two things:

1. What entire love should be between Ministers and people, There must be
entire love between Ministers and people.
they should love one another as fathers and children, mothers and children,
Nurses, and such as have sucked their breasts, Brethren, etc. See 1 Cor. 4. 15.
Gal. 4. 19. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 7. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13.

Reasons hereof may be these, 1. God has committed them each 1 Thessalonians. 2. 19,
20.
and so they be nearly knit. 2. Such as be won by the Ministry,

1. This teaches both Ministers and People to be most tenderly careful to
preserve mutual love, Use 1.
and avoid all occasions of unkindeness or dislike, removing them speedily when
at any time they do arise (for oftentimes of a small spark neglected, arises a
great flame) of all unkindenesses and contentions, those between Ministers and
People be most unprofitable and hurtful; whosoever has a hand herein, and goes
about to alienate the minds of each from the other, that the one cares not for
the other, work journey work to the Devil in a high degree.

2. This condemns that common and most woeful abuse in this Land, Use 2.
even the miserable want of love on both parts; not a few Ministers care not
how seldom they come among their people, and when they do, how little pains
they take, how often do they sue them for mere trifles? on the other part, what
light and base esteem have people of their Ministers? How unkindely do they use
them? How pole they them of their maintenance? Where its thus, God is not, for
God is love, John 4. 16.
and there is no good done to be sure. Here the Devil may sleep till he snort,
he shall not be hindered; but where Ministers and people live in godly love,
there let him look to himself.

2. That we should love men never the worse for their troubles, Christians are
not to be the less, but more loved for their troubles.
but rather the more, as who are worthy to be honored for their Faith,
Patience, Constancy, and being paterns and means to confirm us in our
sufferings for Christ: The Apostle Paul used this as an argument to move
Philemon to grant his request, for that he was aged, and a prisoner for Christ.
Hereof this our Apostle informs them, even that notwithstanding all their
troubles (whereof happily some might have conceived him careless) they were dear
unto him.

This rebukes those that make account of men, Use.
while they be in prosperity, and the world smiles on them; but when the times
frown, and they be discountenanced, and in disgrace and trouble, then cast them
off, or shrink from them, showing them no countenance nor kindeness; a sign
either of mung^els, or at last of dastardly Christians.

Think it not strange concerning the fiery trial,] Here Is the matter exhorted
to: By fiery trial is meant, All kind of persecution, in what degree soever,
compared to the fire; for that as the fire tryes the gold, so persecution tryes
men. Think it not strange, wonder not at it, as at some strange think come out
of a far Country, whereof the like was never either seen or heard of; it
behoved you to have prepared for it before, and now make a reckoning of it,
that so you flinch not from it when it comes. Here note, that

The want of fore-thinking of trouble, The want of preparation for troubles
before they come, make them harder to be born when they are come.
makes it the harder to be born, and the stranger when it comes: When a man
has time to put on his armor, or draw his Sword ere the Thief come, he is more
safe, then if a Thief should rush upon him on the sudden.

As those which are not used to sickness, bear it worst; so, such are most cast
down in the time of trouble, which in the time of prosperity do not so much as
think thereof.

1. This teaches us, Use 1.
even in the time of prosperity, to think of troubles; in the midst of health
we must think of sickness, and how we shall bear it, and accordingly provide
for it; so in the time of wealth, of poverty; so having Children, if God should
take them from us; of our Friends, if they should hate us, how would we behave
our selves? How could we do as such and such a Christian, etc? So in life, we
must think of death; and when any one dies, think that we may be the next, and
thereupon find out how we are prepared for it: These thoughts are profitable,
they will make us use our prosperity the more soberly and thankfully while we
have it, and walk more humbly, and be better prepared for troubles, if God
shall lay them upon us: Neither will they come the sooner for thinking of them;
howsoever, we shall be the better enabled to bear them, when ever they come:
What Is written of the Basilisk, that if it see us before we see it, we dye for
it, but if we see it first, we live, is true of troubles: If we see them ere
they come, we be much better, but if they come on us unlooked for, they prove
the more dangerous. Now every man sits under his own vine, and under his own
figtree; Now we go to the house of God in peace; Now we profess Religion with
good liking: But what if the case alter ere I dye? should thou say; What if I
be haled to prison, lose my goods, be convented, condemned, tortured, banished,
etc. what shall I then do?

2. This rebukes most, Use 2.
that seldom or never have any such thoughts; May not we have changes? why do
we not then think of them?

Oh such sad thoughts do not well, Obj.
lets be merry while we may, sadness will come time enough.

Thou wrongest thy self, Sol.
thy case will be the worse, thy condition the more fearful, if either
sickness, poverty, pain, or any other calamity should take thee unprovided: For
persecution, who is there that now thinks of any such matter? most think that
they shall never be moved, Psalm. 30. 6.
and that they shall dye in their nest, whereas, alas, it may fall out far
otherwise: Job 29. 18.
Have we not many enemies? and what does not our sins deserve? God has indeed
wrought for us many deliverances, as from the Spanish Invasion, and Gunpowder
Treason, etc. but are we sure he will do so still? Has not our grievous
unthankfulness deserved the contrary? Do we think that our enemies do not now
plot mischief against us? No doubt they make use of peace, to prepare for war,
and they will plot now toward their latter end, to uphold their tottering
Babel; Simile.
and do as fishes, feeling the water almost gone from them, flush and make a
stir; and when death draws near men, they have strong pains: So what now at the
last the Lord may suffer them to do against us, we know not. Its the more
likely there will be some judgment, because all men cry Peace and Safety, and
are so senseless; if there should be any such, alas, how unprovided are we? nay,
what were all our provision, strength, multitude of men, etc. if God should set
himself against us? See Ier. 37. 10.
On the contrary, if we have God on our side, as he was with Gideon and his
three hundred, with Jonathan and his Armor bearer, we need not fear them,
though never so many so strong. Now if any such judgment should come on the
Land (which the Lord turn away for his mercies sake) wherein multitudes should
be slain with the Sword, others made Slaves, and carried away, our Wives and
Daughters abused before our faces, our houses and chests rifled, the godly
imprisoned, and brought forth to torment, except they would forsake their
Religion: O Lord! how far are we unfit for any such matter; and the rather, for
that we never think of it? Never would any Land think trouble and misery more
strange, then we which have been used so delicately. O then let us think and
provide for this before, that if it should come, it may not be strange unto us.
If we look to our selves, have not we cause enough to be humbled, and purged
from our dross: and for the world, shall we wonder if they hate and persecute
us? Happily we think because we be honorable persons, the Sons of God, they
should not so deal with us: Its true, but alas, they know not our Father, much
less know they us his Children: 1 John 3. 2.
Happily we think because we be now godly, and make conscience of all our ways,
and love God, and live with our brethren Christianly, and desire nothing so
much as to please God, that therefore all should make much of us. True, God,
Angels, and good Men, will do so, and that must content us; but the world is
the world, and will hate us the more for our goodness, which has been thus
ever since Cain hated Abel; we need not think it strange, for may not the Lord
justly after long schooling us, now call us out to try what we have profited.
Again, hereby he would have the wickedness of the wicked break out, that he
might get glory in confounding them: Also he will hereby confirm the hearts of
the weak to believe the truth, See Phil. 1. 12, 13, 14.
and be bolder to defend it. Again, if we look to the state of the Church, and
faithful Servants of God in former ages, we need not think it strange, for its
the way that they have all gone, Abel, Isaac, Jacob, See Heb. 11.
the Prophets, Christ, his Apostles, the Primitive Church, thousands under the
Roman Emperors, not a few even in this our Land in the Reign of Queen Mary,
etc. Indeed the Devil is ready to make us believe that our case is worse then
any bodies, and that there were never any as we, which is, that he may make us
murmr, and drive us to desparation or to flinch, whereas its a very lie, for
we are in no such case, but the Saints of God have been in as bad, in the same,
in worse; This duly considered, will be a means that afflictions shall be
better born.

Which is to try you,] Afflictions are trials.
Here Is the Reason of the Exhortation; The end of persecution is not to destroy
the good, but to make them better, as the gold is tried by the fire,
afflictions (persecution chiefly) are sent to try what we be, and in what
state; not but that God knows it already, but he would have us also and others
to know to our comfort or humbling. They are of great use, As

1. To try whether we have any truth of grace in us, Above the truth of grace
in us.
whether we be any thing or nothing, sound or hollow, true friends, or
hypocrites, such as are built on the rock, Read the story of Pendleton and
Saunders in the Book of the Martyrs.
or sand: Many that now think well of themselves, will never be able to stand,
and many mean in their own and others eyes, would hold out: A man is never
tried till adversity comes, as a Soldier is in the Battle, a Mariner in a
Storm, a Friend in time of need; Who would have thought the seed in the stony
ground would have flincht? few so good as they in most Parishes: If these would
not abide, what shall we think of most amongst us? persecution, as the fan, of
one heap makes two, and as the fire, separateth the gold from the dross.

Labor then for a true faith of the right stamp, who knows but that God will
send a trial, let us labor to be so provided, as we may be good wheat, to abide
by it, and not chaff, that will fly away; that we may be gold fit to be
Vessels for the Lords use, not dross to be burnt up with unquenchable fire:
Only true believers will hold out, all others will flinch; lets now look to
our selves, lest we making a fair house, not only in the sand, it fall, and
our fall be great, and we having begun a piece of work, leave it in the mid
way, to our perpetual shame: But they that are proved to be sound, and to have
true Faith, its a great Comfort and Crown to them. Who would not have his Sword
or Gun tried ere he went to the field? A little tried Faith is better then much
tried Gold, then much Faith in men's tongues and conceits.

2. To try what measure of grace we have, About the measure of our grace.
whether as much or more, or less then we thought; for some over-prize
themselves, and some do on the contrary. Who would have thought Peter had been
so weak, after such bold protestation? Who would have thought Abraham's Faith so
great as it was, or Jobs both Faith and Patience? Though the Lord would kill
him, yet would he wait on him: What do thine afflictions bewray? Use.
If more grace then thou thoughtst, be thankful; if less, be humbled, and apply
thy self to the means more carefully.

3. To purge, They serve to refine that measure we have.
purify, and refine that measure of true grace that's in us: In the days of
Peace and Prosperity, the best men are subject to gather soil, as standing
waters putrify, bodies without exercise prove full of gross humors: In
prosperity we gather pride, security, teachiness, self-love, too much love of
the world; these God purges away, that our Faith and Grace may show themselves
in their bright colors; as the Vine, having the superfluous branches cut off,
proves the more fruitful: Never do Christians shine so bright, as in
affliction, or presently after it.

But rejoice,] We must rejoice in afflictions.
Here Is the second Exhortation: We must be so far from thinking it strange when
we are persecuted, as that we are then to rejoice. See Iam. 1. 12.


But how can this be? Q.
will some say: To rejoice in mockings, imprisonments, Heb. 12. 11.
cold irons, tortures, etc. seems impossible, and the rather, for that no
affliction for the present is joyous, but tedious.

To the flesh these things be tedious, A.
yet there is cause to make us rejoice in them: Though a natural man cannot do
this, as being impossible to flesh and blood, yet grace, and a good measure of
faith, and an heart mortified to the world, and taken up with the desire of a
better life, will do the same. A man may both grieve, and yet rejoice in the
same thing, in diverse respects; as them that saw the Temple re-edified, Ezra
3. 12.
some wept, namely, the ancient men, some again rejoiced, namely, the young men;
the one, because it was no better, the other, because it was as it was, both
which might have been in either of them: As a man may be glad that he has a
child departed in a godly manner, and yet grieve at the loss of his child; so
if at the fall of a Scaffold, where many lost their lives, we have had a child
that broke his Arm, we are sorry at that, but glad that he escaped with his
life: Thus the Apostles rejoiced, Acts 5. 41. and 16. 25.
thus Paul and Silas, thus the Thessalonians, thus the Christian Hebrews, thus
the Martyrs throughout all ages: Such a thing is Faith; 1 Thessalonians. 1. 6.
its not a Conceit, Heb. 10. 34.
but that that makes things absent, so present, as that we can be content to
endure present pain for joy to come, and to lose things present, for happiness
hereafter: Thus have many of Gods Servants done, so that God requires nothing
of us, but that he has enabled many to do, yea ordinary Christians like our
selves, nay, not a few even of the weaker Sex.

1. This rebukes the woeful unbelief and hypocrisy of most of the world, Use 1.
which though they profess the Word in prosperity, yet in adversity they shift
for themselves, make friendship with the world, and will suffer nothing for
Christ's sake or his Religion; they are ashamed of Christ here, of them will he
be ashamed hereafter; now saving their lives with an ill Conscience, they shall
lose life eternal.

2. It rebukes even the Servants of God, Use 2.
who are so loath to suffer or abide any hardness: We can hardly abide a frown
of our Superior, or an hard word, or a railing speech, but we are cast down,
and disquieted about it; yea, many pull in their heads, and step back, and
think its not good to be forward, and so come to Jesus by night: How will we
suffer imprisonment, and loss of all we have? how endure the fire, and
especially with joy? This is too much tenderness, its through too much
earthly-mindedness.

3. Lets labor for such grace, Use 3.
as whereby if God call us forth to suffer, we may not only not flee back, but
endure any thing, and that with joy. To this end, we must 1. Endeavor for a
sound Faith and assurance of Gods love to us in Christ, that so we may so love
him again, as we may suffer for his Name, and being assured of our deliverance
from everlasting pain, and that he has freed us from shameful sufferings,
which for our sins he might have brought us to, may endure these glorious
sufferings for his Name joyfully. Being thus assured of his love, and thereupon
of eternal happiness in heaven, we will be content to suffer any thing to
obtain it. 2. Withdraw our minds from earthly things, and set them on heaven
and heavenly things, as our only treasure. 3. Mortify and subdue our lusts
and affections, bringing our hearts in subjection to God in all things, and
bearing our present afflictions quietly and comfortably. This joyfulness in
sufferings does well become Christians, daunts their adversaries, and puts a
difference between them and all others, whether hypocrites, civil persons, or
Time-servers, who will never thus do: Christians must be like David's Worthies,
even excel others, do more then ordinary men. If we do only love our friends,
what singular thing do, Mat. 5. 46.
do not even Publicans the same? If we profess Religion in prosperity, what
great matter do we, do not even Hypocrites the same? We must learn to take out
higher lessons, and be perfect, as our Father which is in heaven is perfect.
Its an easy thing to rejoice in prosperity, but so to do in adversity is a
good hard lesson, and so the more worthy a Christians labor.

Inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings, Why the sufferings of
Christians are called Christ's sufferings.
] The first Reason of the Exhortation, We are partners with Christ, therefore
we may think our selves advanced, and so rejoice. The sufferings of Christians
are called Christ's sufferings, 1. Because they are suffered for his sake; 2
Cor. 1. 5.
which may be no small comfort to them that suffer for Religion, Gal. 6. 17.
for its for Christ's sake, and so he counts it: therefore he will put our tears
in his bottle, Col. 1. 24.
take our part, defend, and reward us; as David took care of Abiathar, 1 Samuel
22. 12.
having lost his Father for his sake. 2. Because he bears a part of them with
his Saints; there is so near a conjunction between him the Head, and the Saints
his Members, as what is done to the one, whether good or ill, is counted as done
to the other; as the godly hearing Christ railed on, are so grieved, that they
had rather themselves had been so used: much more does Christ Jesus account
their troubles his, Acts 9. 4.
which as it may terrify their adversaries, so it may much comfort them. But
here they be called Christ's sufferings in another sense, namely, as his own
sufferings, which he bare in his own person, whereof we partake, when we also
suffer the like things; we are set up to be like our Master Christ Jesus,
Christians suffer with Christ.
and is it not cause of rejoicing, that he vouchsafes to make us like himself,
to bring us into his order, to pledge him of the same Cup he began to us?

He suffered, his whole life was nothing else: They misconstrued his words, and
mistook his deeds, and said, He cast out Devils through Beelzebub the Prince of
the Devils: How often was he railed on? how hardly used, especially toward his
latter end?

If we be so dealt with at any time, Use.
we need not think hardly, but rejoice, not think hardly: He was the glorious
Son of God, we poor mortal Creatures, dust and ashes; He most holy and
righteous, and perfectly pure, we miserable sinners, which though not at men's
hands which wrong us, yet at Gods have deserved all evil, both here and in
Hell. If God turn our opprobrious sufferings here, and perpetual torments of
Hell, into a sew short and glorious sufferings, we have no cause to think
hardly; yea, he having suffered all for us, we may well suffer for him, we can
never lose hereby, nor can ever suffer so much for him, as he has done for us;
nay, not only we must not think hardly at our sufferings, but we have cause to
rejoice, that we are advanced to be like our Master, made conformable to our
head Christ Jesus: He is a bold Servant, that is not content to fare as his
Master fares; Those Worthies that have gone before us, have accounted it their
honor, and a special favor that they have drunk of this Cup.

When therefore we do at any time suffer for Religions sake, let us thus
encourage our selves, I am herein made like all the Prophets, Apostles, Ioh.
15. 18, 19.
and chief of Gods Friends and Saints, yea, as his only Son, and thus our
Savior comforted his Disciples.

That when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding
joy.] The second Reason, our sorrow shall be turned into joy, as in part when
we dye, namely, in our souls; so perfectly when he shall be made glorious in
all his Saints, whilst he was here in the world, he was put to an ignominious
death, but he rose again from the dead, and ascended into Heaven, and shall
come one day to judge every man according to his deeds, even to bring into
happiness all those for whom he dyed, and to confound all his Enemies; He came
the first time in meekness, because he came to suffer, but the second time he
shall come with glory and magnificence, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 9.
even with thousands of his Angels in flaming fire; Jude 14.
etc. which, as it may comfort all those that have believed in him, Rev. 1. 7.
and stoopt to his yoke; so it may terrify all those that have not believed or
repented, through obeying the Gospel.

The end (I say) of the afflictions of Gods Servants will be joy, The godlies
afflictictions end in joy.
for Christ will receive them all into eternal glory; They that suffer with
him, shall reign with him, and their joy shall none take from them: See John
16. 33. Romans 8. 18. 2 Cor. 4. 17. 2 Timothy 2. 12. Jam. 1. 12.

O how should this not make us patient only, Use.
but joyful in persecution: Psalm. 126: 5.
If we sow in tears, we shall reap in joy: If we suffer for Christ, we may
rejoice and be glad, Matthew. 5. 9.
for great is our reward in Heaven: If we forsake father, or mother, or house,
or land, etc. for Christ's sake, we shall have life everlasting: See Heb. 10.
34. and 11. 35.
Is not this an happy change? This made the holy Servants of God set light by
all they had, not that they were fools, and knew not what they did, or were
senceless; no, the assurance of an eternal joy and inheritance in Heaven,
swallowed up all, and so should it be with us.

Verse 14. And if ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye, for
the spirit of glory and of God rests upon you; on their part he is evil
spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.
A Third Reason to persuade to rejoice in persecution, because its a blessed
thing, and who would not rejoice in that that will make him happy? and though
he instanceth in one kind, and that which may seem no great persecution, yet
he is to be understood of all others whatsoever; That such shall be blessed, he
proves, because thus to suffer is an argument that the Spirit of God, even the
glorious Spirit rests on them; who, howsoever on the adversaries part he is
blasphemed and ill spoken of, yet is glorified by them that suffer patiently
and joyfully for Christ's sake: Here then, besides that suffering for Christ we
are happy, we may be induced thus to suffer for him, for that his Spirit
rests on us so doing, and hereby also he is glorified: In the words we have a
proposition, and the confirmation thereof.

If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye,] There Is the
proposition; This may seem to be but a slender thing to be reckoned among
persecutions, and that which may be easily born; No, its that which many have
found harder to bear, then loss of goods, blows, yea death it self: Some which
have suffered torments courageously, and endured the loss of all with
joyfulness, yet have almost sunk under slanders and ill tongues: David much
complains of his adversaries, that they made Songs of him, that they spoke
words like the prickings of a Sword, and like sharp Arrows: Sampson could not
endure to be mocked of the Philistines, had rather pull down the House on
himself and them; Job. 30. 9.
Job also complains of such; Ishmaels mocking of Isaac is termed a persecution;
Gal. 4. 29.
The most ingenuous minds can hardliest bear reproaches. Here note,

1. That a good name is a tender thing, A good name is a tender thing.
which is and ought to be dear to us; As we are forbid thus to wrong others, so
the Lord appointed those to be severely punished which should so do. Prove. 21.
1.


1. This rebukes those that make no account of a good name, Use 1.
though it be better then good ointment, Eccles. 7. ^.
but live so badly, as they pull an ill name on themselves; some indeed would
yet have a good name, though they deserve the contrary, but they must first win
it, and then wear it; Such as are desperate, and care not what men say of them,
its a sign they are so bad, as no man can speak worse of them then they
deserve; These cannot be discredited.

2. It condemns those that care not how they raise lies, Use 2.
spread tales of their Neighbors, and seek their discredit, or rail on them and
revile them, Prove. 10. 18.
they do worse then if they stole away their goods, Psalm. 15. 3.
or wounded their bodies, for the name is more tender and dear, and hardlier
cured and recovered, if it be wounded or lost; they that give themselves over
hereto, are fools, neither are they Citizens of Sion: Such are as a Maul, Prove.
25. 18.
and a Sword, and a sharp Arrow, and such was Ziba, See 2 Samuel 16. 3.

2. That railers, Slanderers of Gods Servants are persecuters.
mockers and slanderers of Gods Servants are persecuters; David in the person
of Christ complains of such: Such also are they that revile them by the name
of hypocrites, Psalm. 22. 6. 7.
precise fools, humerous, singular, fantastical Puritans, etc. I mean those
that revile the true Servants of God, who for their zeal are often thus dealt
with, whom those slanderers would no less smite with the hand, then they do
with the tongue, if times did but bear them out; They would be no less forward
to hale before Magistrates, cast into Prison, etc.

1. Let them that have been and be such, Use 1.
repent hereof as of persecution, Gal. 4. 30.
else with Ishmael they shall be cast our, Numb. 23. 8.
and as they be worse then Balaam, so shall they speed worse.

2. Let all others avoid this as a fearful sin, Use 2.
for its to be like the Devil, See Jude 15.
the accuser of the Brethren, who shall answer for this at the last day.

3. For those that be railed on, Use 3.
are slandered, or have lies devised against them, let them know, they are
Martyrs before God, and suffer persecution, which is an honor; let them bear
this patiently, and go on constantly, and not be discouraged, and there is good
hope they shall bear greater persecutions if they come, which else in
likelihood they cannot.

3. That it has been an usual custom in the world to reproach, To slander Gods
Children for their godliness is usual.
revile, and slander Gods Servants for their godliness: Sore eyes cannot abide
the light, and there is an enmity between the seed of the Woman and the Serpent;
and when other weapons have failed them, they have used this of their tongue,
whereby indeed they prevail much to the disgrace of Religion.

1. Being so now we must not think it strange, Use 1.
for the Devil is now as malicious as ever, and has instruments as fit for his
turn as ever; If now endeavoring carefully to serve God, we be counted proud
fellows, factious, Enemies to the State, etc. we must not be too much
disquieted, were not the Prophets, the Apostles, Christ himself thus reputed?
we are not too good to go hand in hand with them; its a piece of our livery to
be thus dealt with.

2. When we hear any reports against Gods Servants, Use 2.
know them well ere we believe them, we should else condemn the innocent; even
Christ was slandered for a Conjurer and Traitor, and the Apostle Paul for a
pestilent fellow, yet who were more freer? who more wronged?

4. That such as are reproached for the name of Christ, Such as are reproached
for the name of Christ are happy.
are happy; I say, for the name of Christ, or for being true Christians,
believing in Christ, and serving him; for not the punishment, but the Cause
makes a Martyr: How can this be will some say, and what blessedness can there
be in being railed upon and slandered? why, thus says our Apostle, Matthew. 5.
11.
and he knew what he said, having learned the same of his Lord and Master, whom
he heard so speak.

Its a blessed thing to be a Christian washed in the blood of Christ, reconciled
to God, whom the Angels protect, who is the heir of Gods promises and blessings
here, and of eternal salvation hereafter: Even an Emperor without this, is but
as a man in great jolity to night, that must to execution to morrow: But to be
railed on for being a Christian, is a greater blessedness, Phil. 1. 29.
a special honor: Its honor to be a Princes Servant, but to be about him, and
to have the guard of his own person, and to stand in his defense against an
Enemy, or to be called forth to justify his lawful Title, is far greater.

Again, Its a blessed thing to be willing and able to suffer for Christ, flesh
and blood cannot; we might have been of the persecuters, or of them that regard
no Religion at all, or to suffer any thing for it, or making profession of
Religion, should yet shrink from it, rather then suffer for its Cause; Phil. 1.
28.
Therefore to suffer for it is a blessed thing, which is to us a token of
Salvation.

1. Therefore we must not only not be dismayed, Use 1.
but bear these things patiently, yea joyfully, for should we not rejoice in
that that makes us blessed? If therefore we shrink at the least of these
things, and pull in our heads, where is our faith? labor, that if we should be
mocked and railed on, it may not be for nothing, but for true grace, faith
wrought in us by the Word, etc. If we have these things, no matter though we
have some mocks withal.

2. See that wicked persecuters make Gods Servants happy, Use 2.
yea, more happy then they should be, so that in seeking their hurt, they do
them good many ways; They purge and try them, make them the more dear to God,
and set the greater Crown upon their heads: what a privilege have the Servants
of God, that all things, even their persecuters should work together for their
good; Its not so with others, yet are not we to thank the wicked for this, who
intend no such thing: The Caldeans and Sabeans were an occasion that Job had
twice as much goods given him as he had before, but no thank to them, for they
took from him what they could; Its God who blesses the more those whom the
wicked curse.

5. That the judgment of the world is contrary to Gods; The judgment of the
world is contrary to Gods.
They think not any blessedness to be in being railed on for Christ's sake, but
that blessedness stands in Health, Wealth, Honor, favor of Princes, etc. Alas,
poor vanishing vanities to be lost every day, but blessedness is in being a
Christian, and suffering for the same, Gods thoughts are not as man's; The
blind world cannot judge of colors, and Carnal men savor not of things
Spiritual.

1. Therefore look that we never esteem, Use 1.
nor be carried with the judgment of the world, no not of the wise men of the
world, which is a crooked rule to go by; They say, its not good to be too
forward is matters of Religion, but go so far, as they may come back when they
will, and save themselves from danger, and have two strings to their bow; but
let us know this to be cursed policy, this amity with the world, to be enmity
with God.

2. If we think troubles for a good conscience, Use 2.
base, vile, and accursed, and so shun them, though with an ill conscience, we
are then of the world, and either wholly carnal, or in great part; Shall we
account that cursed, which the Lord calls blessed? True, we must not bring
troubles on our selves, nor desire persecution; yet if God call us to them, we
must not count them base, but glorious; not cursed, but blessed: So if we think
basely of them that suffer, or are in persecution, and shun them, then are we
carnal and of the world; nay, we ought to esteem highly of them, and think them
glorious persons, because they be honored of God, and greatly graced of him.

For the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you,] He proves what he
affirmed; If ye suffer for Christ's sake, its an argument ye have the Spirit of
God in you, which is a glorious Spirit, and makes you glorious, notwithstanding
the ignominy and reproach the world casts upon you, as though you were of all
others the vilest; whereupon you must needs be blessed, which Spirit is on
their part ill spoken of, but on yours that suffer is glorified; So that as the
Spirit makes you glorious, you glorify it by your constant and joyful
suffering. Hence Note,

1. That to suffer for Christ's sake, To suffer for Christ's sake an evidence of
Gods Spirit in us.
is a sign that we have the Spirit of God in us; for 1. The world would not
hate us except they saw some work of Gods Spirit in us, for if we lived after
the manner of the world, they would let us alone. 2. Such have the Spirit of
Adoption, John 15. 19.
assuring them of Gods love, of pardon and Salvation, which makes them willing
to suffer. 3. Its the Spirit that comforts, and heartens to such weighty
things; flesh and blood will endure nothing for Religion, neither can it, but
through the Spirit we are enabled: Steven a comfortable Martyr, John 16. 3. 7.
Why? Its said, He was full of the Holy Ghost: It was by the Spirit of God
only that the Martyrs endured so constantly, not a few of them being weak,
sick, tender, feeble of nature, and fearful; It was of the Spirit that Mr.
Glover spoke when he came to the Stake to be burnt, He is come Austin, he is
come; having been very heavy and comfortless the night before: In ill I confess
some may be as stiff, as the best can be in the truth, but they cannot suffer
so joyfully as the Servants of God; Matthew. 10. 20.
for its through the Spirit of God that they suffer.

1. Therefore if we have had, Use 1.
or find any power to endure persecution, we may know that we have Gods
Spirit, and thereupon ought to be both thankful and joyful.

2. As we would suffer with comfort and joy, Use 2.
let us labor for the Spirit, and for a greater measure thereof daily.

3. As for those that neither can nor will endure any thing, Use 3.
its a sign they are carnal, and without the Spirit: And indeed, none can
suffer much or joyfully, but such as have the Spirit, and therefore so few
having the Spirit, there would be but a few to stand for the truth, if there
should come a time of trial.

2. That such as are endued with Gods Spirit, Such as are endued with Gods
Spirit are blessed.
be blessed; for such as have and are led by the Spirit of God, they are the
Sons of God; and they, yea they only which be sanctified here, shall be
glorified hereafter; Romans 8. 14.
The Spirit is given to the Elect, not to the world, its the earnest of our
salvation, and seals us up to the day of Redemption. Again, such are freed from
the bondage of sin to serve God, such also have God abiding in them, yea, and
hereby the Word, the Sacraments, Prayer, Afflictions, all things are profitable
to us; Hereby we are enabled to every duty, and armed against temptations.

1. This may comfort those that can prove they have the Spirit of God in them;
Use 1.
they are comforted, sanctified, and guided thereby: This is the earnest and
pledge of eternal life; they are blessed, though but mean; they may come into
Gods presence boldly; they shall want nothing that is good.

2. It may be a terror to those that live after the flesh; Use 2.
They have no mark whereby to free them from being reprobates; for if any man
have not the Spirit of Christ, the same is none of his, Christ never dyed for
such, they are yet under the bondage of sin.

3. This should teach us, Use 3.
having the Spirit, to beware of doing any thing whereby to grieve or weary
such a guest (sin is a filthy thing, and that wherewithal the Spirit cannot
away) yea, to use all means to cherish it daily, suffering our selves to be
guided thereby, as that which will not be there where it may not rule.

3. That the Spirit is glorious in it self, Such as are endued with Gods spirit
are glorious.
and makes them glorious before God and man that be endued therewith; it makes
them shine more gloriously then the Sun: And this the Apostle opposes to the
ignominies and reproaches wherewith the world does besmear them; Its as if he
should say, Though the world reproach you as vile, yet know, that you are
glorious in Gods account, because of his Spirit that dwells in you.

1. Therefore be not dismayed, Use 1.
though the world stain us, and accounts us vile, yet are we glorious to God.

2. We must esteem of the Servants of God, Use 2.
in whom we see the Spirit of God, as of glorious persons, yea, though the
world disgrace them, and count them as off-scourings, and not worthy to live,
we must count them as Gods worthies, and Warriers, as his principal Servants;
we must count them such, as the world is not worthy of: They that esteem basely
of them, See Ioh. 15. 21.
do not consider that Gods Spirit is in them, 1 John 3. 24.
and rests on them. Psalm. 15. 4. and 119. 199.
Contrarily, they that have not the Spirit of God in them, are base and vile,
let the world make what reckoning of them it will.

4. That there is no small difference between the common gifts of the Spirit
that the Reprobates have, The gifts of the Spirit which the godly have, cannot
be lost.
and the Spirit of Sanctification, which is bestowed on Gods Elect; those may
be lost, this cannot, it rests on them, yea, abides and continues with them.

On their part he is ill spoken of,] Here note, that

They that rail upon, They that speak ill of Gods servants for their welldoing,
speak ill of Gods Spirit.
and revile the Servants of God for their welldoing, they speak ill of the
Spirit of God; they think they have but to do with the men, and them they will
be bold with, to speak their pleasure of; but they deceive themselves, in
speaking ill of Gods Servants, they speak ill of the Spirit of God; as the
Israelites, when they murmured against Moses and Aaron, Exodus 16. 18.
murmured against God: He that despises you (says our Savior) despises me.
Luke 10. 16.
Therefore when TURKS and JEWS mock and reproach us for believing in CHRIST,
they reproach both the Word, that so teaches us, and the Spirit that thus
guides us, and assures our hearts herein; as he that reproacheth a Servant
for doing that his Master commands, or a Scholar for speaking as he is taught,
reproacheth the Master and Teacher: So when the Papists call the Doctrine which
we preach and profess, Heresy, and us Heretics, do they not reproach the
Word that so teaches, and the Spirit that so assures us? So they among our
selves, that rail on men for their zeal and forwardness in hearing the Word,
keeping the Sabbath, shunning some sins and corruptions, that the world swallow
up, etc. What do these, but reproach Gods Spirit? We do not these things of our
selves, but by the warrant of the Spirit.

Take heed therefore that that be evil which thou speak against, Use.
else whilst thou reproachest goodness in thy Servant, Child, Neighbor,
Tenant, etc. thou art a caviller against God.

The common sort, that cannot abide the true obedience of Gods Commandments,
nor that any should be more precise then they list to be, 1 King. 22. 13.
despise the Word and Spirit; they be like Ahab to Micaiah: Would thou have
God to make new Scriptures, more loose to serve thy turn, or to be like thy
self? No, know, these Scriptures shall stand firm, as to the comfort and
salvation of all that are willing to be guided thereby, so to the confusion of
all that kick against the same, or hate to be reformed. If therefore you list
not to be ruled by the Word and Spirit, yet speak not against the same, for so
you shall increase your sin, and make your judgment greater, which howsoever
will be great enough. If you will not walk in obedience to Gods Laws, yet
suffer others that would.

On your part he is glorified.] By our suffering of persecution God is
glorified.
Another Reason to move us to joyfulness in persecution, Thereby we glorify
God, we honor the Spirit, when undaunted we stand constantly against all our
enemies: Hereby we show, that the Spirit of God is of puissance and force to
make the weak strong; We glorify him also, when we so love him, as we will
suffer for his sake; so we give glory to him, when we trust him of his word,
who has promised eternal life to them that hold out; so when we obey him, and
do that willingly he calls us to; so many praise God for our constancy, whereby
they be strengthened, and God is honored, See Ioh. 21. 19.
that they cannot prevail against us, but though they take away our lives, yet
they cannot make us yield to them.

We should therefore willingly and joyfully suffer, that so we may glorify
God: we may think our selves happy, if by any means, whether in life or death,
we may effect this.

Verse 15. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as an
evil doer, or as a busy body in other men's matters. Verse 16. Yet if any man
suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God on this
behalf.
LEst any should think that he commended suffering in respect of it self, so
that all suffering should be blessed, and were to be rejoiced in, he tells us,
That there is another kind of suffering, then that he has been speaking of,
which is not to be rejoiced in; namely, when men suffer reproach and
punishment, or whatsoever else for evil doing, for their just deserts: Those
sufferings are base and shameful, whereof Christians must beware; but for the
sufferings which are for Christ, for Righteousness sake, for a good Conscience,
there is no shame belonging to them, but rather glory and rejoicing.

Here then are two kinds of sufferings laid down, Two kinds of sufferings.
the one forbidden, whereto shame belongs, namely, to suffer for ill-doing,
which is to be avoided; the other enjoined, and wherein we are to rejoice,
namely, in suffering for well doing.

But let none of you suffer as a murderer, etc.] Not that if any be a
murderer or thief, etc. he should not suffer the punishment due thereto, but
fly from it; for that herein he resists the Magistrates Sentence on his
deserts, sets himself against God: but he would not have men do any such evil,
as to procure or deserve any such sufferings.

Obj. But none can walk so circumspectly, but that he may and shall do evil,
and so deserve punishment at the hand of the Lord.

A. True, but he speaks of foul vices, and punishable by men, which Christians
should be far from; and for the frailties of Gods Servants, he will not impute
them to them.

The words afford this Doctrine, that

Sufferings for ill-doing are not glorious, Suffering for ill-doing are
shameful.
but shameful: Sufferings are good only in respect of the cause; if that be
good, then they be good; if that be evil, then they be shameful: The same
sufferings for kind and measure may be to one person glorious, to another
infamous; the one may have cause of joy, the other to hang down their heads:
Both Abel and Jezabel were killed, but he for his goodness, she for her
badness; both Joseph and Pharaoh's Officers were imprisoned, but he unjustly,
they justly: Such as are reviled, are blessed, provided it be for the Name of
Christ, and for Righteousness sakes.

1. This rebukes all that suffer for ill-doing, Use 1.
especially such as rejoice therein; as 1. The Papists, who keep a Calendar of
Martyrs, I warrant you, that have suffered in our late Queens days, and since;
but they be the Devils Martyrs, if they be any: If they had not impudent faces,
they would be ashamed of them; for why have they suffered? for their Religion?
no such matter: Have they been asked, what say you to the Mass, to Worshipping
of Images, to Justification by Works, etc. if you will not recant these, you
shall dye? no such thing; but they have been convicted by Witnesses, or their
own Confession, of Treason and Mischief against the Prince, State and
Commonwealth; and for these have they, according to the Laws of all Countries
and Kingdoms, as pestilent instruments, been cut off: Yet if they had been put
to death for their Religion, they had been no Martyrs, for it had not been for
the Truth or Gospels sake, but for maintaining Lies and Errors. None can dye
the death of a Martyr, who has not first lived the life of a Christian, which
they did never; they are even as good Martyrs as those of our own, that be
executed for their theft and murder: They have a multitude of Saints in their
Calendar, that be Firebrarnds in Hell. 2. Such as for their crimes and faults
bring sufferings upon themselves, as thieves, murderers, etc. woeful wretches,
they have cause to hang down their heads, both in respect of their sin, and the
punishment that does befall them; they are herein companions with the Devil and
Reprobates, that they suffer for their sins: Others bring punishments upon
themselves for their Drunkenness, Whoredom, Cousenage, Oppression, Quarrelling,
Idleness, etc. Others bring an ill report upon themselves, being noted and
ill-spoken of for Liars, Backbiters, Slanderers, Tale-tellers, Covetous
Pinehers, Hard Dealers, Gamesters, Company-keepers, etc. 3. Such as are
professors of Christianity, and it may be have some good things in them, which
yet are justly blamed for some faults; for one may be a Christian and be
blamed, and yet not for his Christianity, but for something he did before he
was a Christian, or for some fault that is yet in him: As some be justly blamed
for being such deep censurers of others, so for separating from the Church,
living in no Church at all, but setting up any ignorant persons to take upon
them the office of Preaching: So some among our selves are justly blamed, for
being too proud, given to censuring, and meddling with matters that concern them
not: So some poor men that have nothing but their Labor, and a Family depending
upon them, that yet be negligent in their Callings, and look to live of others,
and it may be go to three or four Sermons in a week, and tarry abroad a day or
two here, three or four there, or, as some, go from house to house, and live of
others, who though they can talk well, yet must not be negligent in their
Calling, or of their Families: So a number of Servants that profess Religion,
are very desirous to hear every Sermon, who yet are idle, lazy, careless and
untrusty, thinking that a little profession of goodness should bear out all;
when as thereupon there is more required at their hands: These cause the Name of
God to be ill spoken of, fie upon it; it is your Masters duty to let you come
to the Word, and is it not as well your duty to give them an account when you
are come home (which some of you do not at all) and to show the fruit of your
hearing, by your faithfulness in your particular places?

2. Let all beware of these kinds of sufferings, Use 2.
and those that have besmeared themselves thus, seek to wash themselves clean
again by repentance to God, and better conversation to men; let us walk so
warily, that we may not in any case grieve the Servants of God, and that the
wicked may find nothing justly to speak ill of us (as thus, He is a Professor,
Dan. 6. 5.
but covetous, idle, proud, etc.) as the Princes, though they watched Daniel
narrowly, could find nothing against him, but in the cause of his God.

Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed,] Now of the
other kind of sufferings, whereof no man ought to be ashamed; If a man suffer
for Christ's sake, his Christianity, godliness, for that very cause, and in that
only respect, for his goodness, for holding the truth of the Gospel, for
yielding obedience to the Word; Hereof none need be ashamed, but rather thank
God for the same. Here note, That

Sufferings for godliness be glorious, Sufferings for godliness are glorious.
they be the marks of Christ; Christ's sufferings, no shame belongs to them, for
no shame belongs to Christianity; The Cause is good and glorious, accordingly
must the sufferings so be: No shame belongs to goodness, no shame among Turks
to be counted and known a Christian, among Papists to be a Protestant, among
common Protestants to be a zealous server of God, that desires to bring into
practice that which we outwardly profess; we need not care who know we be such,
shame came in with sin, and belongs to sin; to suffer for goodness, whether it
be by word or deed, as to be Apprehended, Imprisoned, put in Irons, Whipped,
etc. is not shameful, but glorious; the Apostle Paul might have boasted more of
his iron Chain, then others could have of their golden Chains; No suffering is
base, if it be for a good Cause: If one should be put in a vile Dungeon,
dragged at an Horse tale, etc. yet being for the Cause of Christ, he needed not
be ashamed.

1. This rebukes all such that are ashamed of goodness, Use 1.
and to be ill spoken of for it; not only the common sort who are ashamed of
no evil (as of Covetuosness, Swearing, Sabbath breaking, etc. but do even
strive who should exceed others therein) are ashamed of the least goodness, and
would not be seen with a Bible in their hand, or in good company, or to speak a
good word, lest their companions and betters should upbraid them: No, beware;
well, they are not worthy of the honor, they shall not need to fear it; But
others that have some goodness in them, as one would hope that are yet so
ashamed of being seen to be too forward, would hear oftener, but for fear they
should be counted Puritans, have their Landlords frown, etc. and accordingly
grieve if they have a rebuke for their forwardness: Alas poor Creatures, that
see not what is their glory, are ashamed of that they should glory in, namely
their goodness, which is the thing that commends every man; even Kings in the
Scripture are not otherwise commended but for their goodness: Others as great
as they, are either branded with reproach, or passed by in silence that had no
goodness.

2. Take heed therefore you be not ashamed of God here, Use 2.
lest he be ashamed of you another day: Do as Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, they
built here and there Altars, and were not ashamed to call on the Lord, neither
was he ashamed of them to be called their God: Art thou called Puritan? Answer,
I am not so pure as I should be, I pray God make me pure; you must be pure,
else you shall never see God: we must also take heed that we esteem not basely,
nor be ashamed of them that suffer for Christ's sake, shunning and avoiding
their company lest forsooth it should be known wear friends to Puritans; to
those the world so calls and counts, and that for their goodness; woe be to us
if we be not friends and favorers of them, this being indeed a main mark of our
Regeneration. 1 John 3. 14.


But let him glorify God on this behalf.] To suffer for well-doing affords
matter of Thanksgiving.
As sufferings for God are a benefit for which we are to praise God, so they be
a great honor which the Lord vouchsafes his: Hereby we are tried, made
Partners with Christ, the Prophets, Apostles, and Martyrs, that be now in
Heaven, are like our head in suffering, Acts 5. 41.
and so shall be in glory, and shall rejoice at his coming, Phil. 1. 29.
and for ever: This is an argument we are none of the world, but chosen out of
it, yea, that we are blessed, and have the Spirit of God in us; hereby also we
glorify God: And might not God have left us to our selves, and brought
shameful sufferings upon us for foul sins, as upon many others; yea, might have
cast us to Hell, to have most just and woeful torments for ever and ever: Now
seeing he vouchsafes to change our shameful sufferings here and hereafter for
our sins, into a few glorious sufferings for his names sake, it is a
privilege: Therefore though there be some tartness in the afflictions
themselves, yet consider how they might have been, and now the cause why they
be, what Partners we have, what good they will do us here, and what an happy
end we shall have hereafter, we have great and unspeakable cause to praise and
glorify God, which I pray in Gods name let us labor (by faith) to bring our
hearts unto.

Verse 17. For the time is come, that judgment must begin at the house of God;
and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the
Gospel of God?
HEre are more Reasons to the same purpose; 1. From the time; God will now
since Christ's coming, exercise his Church with greater trials and trobules,
then the ages before his coming in the flesh. 2. The necessity of it, Judgment
must come. 3. By making comparison between the state of Gods children
persecuted, and their persecuters; yea, and all the wicked, for though these be
chastened a while, yet the end of the ungodly will be most fearful, which he
sets not down affirmatively, but with much more vehemence and earnestness, by
interrogation, What shall the end be, etc?

For the time is come, The Churches troubles are more now then heretofore.
etc.] The Church is appointed to more crosses and trials since Christ under
the Gospel, then before. True, it has been persecuted even from the beginning,
and every true believer has had crosses and trials, and the people of God have
been persecuted both of the profane among themselves, and of others, yet never
so sorely nor commonly as since Christ, witness the ten bloody Persecutions,
with those which the Church has since suffered by Heathen, Turks, Papists.

Reasons. 1. Because this time has clearer promises, and a more fuller
revelation of Gods will, and Heaven as it were set open, and Christ and all his
benefits so set before our eyes, as we have much more means of comfort and
believing, and so of love to God, and courage, and therefore may well undertake
greater tasks; the time of the Law, was the time of the infancy of the Church;
the time of the Gospel, the time of the maturity thereof: Therefore well may
God require and look for more obedience, and not in doing only, but suffering;
Acts 2. 17.
for God will not have the graces of his Spirit in his Servants to rust. 2. The
Lord has promised great things of the people in time of the Gospel: Isaiah 4.
2. 27. 9.
He will pour out his Spirit upon them, knowledge shall abound, young men shall
see visions, Heb. 12. 10.
etc, Now seeing its foretold, we should be holy in these times, the Lord
therefore must use the best means to effect the same, whereof afflictions are
one.

1. This confuteth that opinion of the Papists, Use 1.
that teach, That the Church in the New Testament should always so prosper and
flourish in wealth, and be conspicuous and glorious, and have victory over the
enemies thereof, which is rather the mark of the synagogue of Satan, which is
ever greater in number, and more pompous, for though God give his Church
breathings to be gathered, and to edify themselves, yet is it scarce at any
time free from troubles.

2. It rebukes those among our selves, Use 2.
that the Gospel should bring all peace and ease, and therefore when they see
any troubles come for it, Amos 9. 9, 10, etc.
they are offended: Its true, God gives peace and plenty, as handmaids to wait
upon the Gospel, yet either for chastisement for the contempt of the Gospel, or
trial of his Servants profiting; the Gospel has troubles, and men must be
content, and take the Gospel with whatsoever troubles, and thank God too, and
think they be gainers: But many would have the rose, not the prickle, follow
Christ for loaves, and in hope for preferment, but hearing that he has no
where to rest his head, they will be gone; These be but Hypocrites, and such as
never tasted indeed of the Gospel, for if they had, they would part with all
for it.

3. It should teach us all in these days, Use 3.
not to conceit of ease, credit, etc. for the Gospel brings a Sword, and
therefore we must prepare for hardship, yea, the Gospel brings enough with it,
to make us willing to suffer for it; The not thinking hereof, causes
unpreparedness, and both either a flying from God, or else to bear them
impatiently.

That judgment must begin] By judgment is not meant plagues or punishments
for sin, as pieces of Gods wrath, and forerunners of condemnation (for such are
those laid on the wicked) but merciful chastisements, 1 Cor. 11. 32.
and loving corrections, whereby we are moved to judge our selves that we be
not judged of the Lord, and condemned with the world.

1. These afflictions must begin with Gods-Servants; Afflictions must begin
with Gods Servants.
Jacobs house first, afterward the Egyptians felt the Famine; first the
Israelites were oppressed, but afterward the Egyptians themselves plagued; the
Jews were first carried into captivity, but afterward the Assyrians were
destroyed by the Medes and Persians. 1. In respect of their sins, they are full
of terror and anguish of Spirit ere they can get any comfort, and when they
have obtained it, its often eclipsed, and they go mourning. 2. They are subject
to many sicknesses, grievous pains, diseases, losses, crosses, disgrace,
persecution at the hand of the wicked, etc. And thus will God have his Church
afflicted, either by his own hand, or by the wicked. 1. To humble them for sin
past, as Joseph's brethren. 2. To fetch them into the way from wandering, and
teach them obedience, as David and Jonah. 3. To humble them. 4. To mortify
their lusts, wean them from the world, and quicken them to duty. 5. Hereby also
God shows that he will not bear with sin in his dearest Servants, as he did
not in David, Moses, Miriam. 6. To confute the Devil, and show that Gods people
serve him not for wages. 7. To show them their happiness is to come, and that
if God thus school his Servants, that then he will deal severely with the
wicked, so that this may be a looking-glass to them.

1. Seeing God will have it thus, Use 1.
and that his course is to begin with his Children, we must not refuse the
chastening of the Almighty, neither conclude against our selves, that we be
none of the Lords, because of this, as Gideon, but if we can prove it by other
reasons, let not this dismay; This is rather an argument we are the Lords,
though not of it self (because the wicked are also thus met with) yet to be
taught hereby to labor to see the Lords mind, and to make use, and be patient,
is a good sign, and know, seeing we be chastened here, we have happiness
remaining for us.

2. That none bless himself to be in Gods favor because of his great
prosperity, Use 2.
or for that his eyes stand out with fatness: Psalm. 73. 7.
For Ishmael had the fat of the Earth, Job 21. 7, 8, 9, etc.
and Esau the dew of Heaven, and Judas carried the bag: They might rather
conclude, seeing they live wickedly, and be not punished but prosper here, that
therefore there remains a fearful answer for them, and so there does, as in the
next clause appears.

3. Neither ought Gods children envy or be discouraged at the prosperity of the
wicked; Use 3.
for they may from thence conclude, that judgment is coming on them; but for
themselves, that there is happiness laid up for them; for if God can afford his
enemies the blessings of this life (which oftentimes even his own have in a
scant measure) how great happiness will he bestow upon them in the life to come?

2. Its of necessity that Gods Servants must here suffer troubles; Why Gods
children must here suffer afflictions.
and that 1. In respect of Gods will, he has appointed us thereunto. 2. In
respect of our necessity: Sin is so rivited into us, and in our very nature, as
it must be no small nor easy thing to pluck it out from us: O our infidelity,
pride, hypocrisy, self-love, frowardness, etc. how near do these cleave to us,
Psalm. 32. 3, 4.
and how fast do they hang on? nay, what a while is it ere an affliction works
any thing to the purpose, which therefore must either be long continued, or
have another joined therewith: Who has not need to have his heart more
mollified? to be weaned from the world, to be quickened to his duty etc. how
soon do we forget an affliction, and therefore who has not need to be
remembered?

Therefore let us not be against the Lords chastning: Use.
Its better to have a strong purgation, then to fall into spiritual diseases
and dangers, whereunto we shall else be subject; there is no rule in the world
among children without rods: Neither use we untimely means, or make over much
haste to get out of them, but crave rather to be better renewed and increased
in Faith, Patience, Humility, etc. our care is comfortable.

At the house of God;] Gods Church is his house.
that is, The Church of God, as its said of Moses, Numb. 12. 7.
That he was faithful in Gods house. God walks in the midst of the seven golden
Candlesticks: Rev. 1. 13.
He is among his people, and in his Church, to direct, comfort, protect and
provide for it, as a careful householder for his family: He is with us to the
end of the world, and dwells in every Believer by his holy Spirit.

1. This serves for instruction to duty, Use 1.
both to God our Householders and other our fellow servants: Toward God, 1. We
must behave our selves, as such as belong to such a Family; Joshua and
Cornelius had godly Families, God will have none that shall behave themselves
unseemly, or not be subject to the Orders of his House; we must not be away at
meals, when the Family meet; If God find our place empty, when it should be
full, as at Word and Sacrament, he will be much provoked; if the second time,
beware, etc. 2. We must follow our work hard, that our Master sets us about,
for he has no idle persons in his Family; we must therefore know what is our
work in our general calling, as that we must walk holily, righteously and
soberly; what in our particular, as a Magistrate, Minister, Householder,
Servant, Husband, Wife, etc. He will pay well, and therefore looks to have his
work done well and faithfully; neither must we refuse any work he sets us
about, as some skemish Servants do in our time, but do whatsoever he requires,
knowing that he appoints no work but what is fit and meet; and we must be at his
hand always, not as retainers, (God has no such) but household Servants,
up-rising and down-lying. 3. We must bear patiently the rebukes of our Master,
and his corrections when we have done amiss; yea, learn to amend there by, not
murmuring nor answering again. 4. We must take our Masters part when we see him
misused, or his goods imbezeled, he will else pull our coats over our ears as
unfaithful ones.

Toward each other. 1. There must be no contentions between us, an honest
Householder will not endure it in his Family, much less can the Lord away that
there should be in his; How shall then the work go forward? 2. We must love and
join together against the Enemies, and defend one another in goodness; not
hinder, but further one another works, and not envy that any of our
fellow servants do more work then we; let us do what we can, and when we
cannot, yet be glad that our Masters work go forward.

2. It serves for comfort to all that be of the Lords Household; Use 2.
They shall want no good thing, no direction, comfort, strength against
temptation; If we use the means, and make known our wants to God, he that
requires us to work, will not suffer us to want wherewithal; yea, for outward
things, we shall not want what is meet: He that bids us provide for our
Families, and says, he is worse then an Infidel that does not, will not fail
us in our lawful endeavors: Happily he will not always give all we desire, but
what is meet; and hereafter we shall be taken up to his other house in Heaven,
when we have been sufficiently purged here.

3. It may be for terror to all that misuse Gods Servants, Use 3.
or reproach and buffet them, when they be at their work; God will not put it
up, but defend even the meanest Servant in his Family.

4. It may be for direction; Use 4.
let us prove our selves his true Servants, Covenant-Servants, and no
hang-by's; for as about Princes and great Men's Houses, be many that be not in
Covenant for wages, nor are settled Servants, of whom any charge is taken: So in
the Church, the Lords House, there are a number that work not the Lords work,
but the Devils, and are of his Family; for he has two Families, one of
reprobate souls in Hell, the other of unbelievers and wicked here on Earth:
These work earnestly for the Devil, yet they will come into Gods House, and the
Devil is content they should, so long as they keep their heart and life to him;
yea, they will put over their leg, and sit down at the table to eat of the
bread prepared for the Lords Family, but he will come in and view them, and
finding them without a wedding Garment, and such as be not in Covenant with
him, he will cause them to be bound hand and foot, and cast into utter
darkness; These shall have their wages where they have done their work: Have
thou been such a one? humble thy self before God, bid adieu to thy old master,
and come in good earnest, and enter Covenant, and purpose to be a true and
dutiful Servant to God, and he will have mercy on thee, and take thee into his
Service, and then may thou have comfort, and challenge the privilege of the
Family.

If it first begin at us, etc.] Here note,

1. That the Apostle puts himself in the number of such as were of Gods House;
Assurance of Salvation possible.
So that its possible for us to come to be assured that we are of the Lords
Family.

Labor we therefore to attain hereunto, Use.
else what joy can we have of our lives? 2 Pet. 1. 10.
we are bid make our calling and election sure, and why do we it not? would
thou know to what family thou do belong, thou may by the works thou do:
If we work the works of God, John 8. 44.
of Holiness and Righteousness in our general callings, and be faithful in our
special callings, then are we of Gods Family; if the works of sin, then are we
of our Father the Devil: You may come into Gods House, as many an hypocrite and
Beast does, but of his house you be not; try whose work thou do: Thou do
some work of Gods, and some of the Devils; no, if we do any work willingly for
the Devil, we do none for God aright, nor that he accepts. Again, if thou do
not believe nor repent, thou art none of Gods Family; if thou art an
unrighteous person, thou art none of his, yea, if we be of Gods house, we
cannot abide to hear our Master ill spoken of, nor any of our fellow servants
for their goodness, but our hearts will rise against it; contrarily, if we be
such as dishonor God, reproach the sincerity of the Gospel, and power of
Religion, with them that desire so to walk, yea, or can hear them ill spoken
of, and are not grieved thereat, its a sign we be none of Gods Family, but the
Devils.

2. That there is no small difference between the state of Gods children and the
wicked; The state of the godly and ungodly much different.
even the state of the godly, notwithstanding the many troubles wherewith their
life is filled, is to be preferred before the state of the wicked,
notwithstanding their present jollity: The state of the godly is infinitely
better then the wicked's, both in this life, in death, and at the day of
Judgment: Those are freed from the curse and wrath of God, and all evil, are
reconciled and made the children of God, and are covered with Christ's
righteousness: These are in danger of all condemnation, remain children of the
Devil, Enemies to God, altogether in their own filthiness; all Creatures both
in Heaven and Earth are at Peace with those, but all at odds with these; Angels
guard the one, the other are a prey to the Devil; the one working the works of
holiness, are acceptable to God, and shall have eternal life, the other the
filthy scullery of the Devil, Psalm. 11. 6.
shall have Hell; the one are beloved of God, the other hated; the person and
prayers of the one are acceptable to God, the others abominable in his sight;
of the one all things, their afflictions, Romans 8. 28.
yea, their sins turn to their good, to the other, the mercies of God, Isaiah
4. 5.
yea, his holiest Ordinances turn to their hurt: Those are called the glory,
Psalm. 1. 3, 4.
these dross; those are as a tree planted by the rivers of waters, etc. these
as the chaff which the wind drives away; those are as wheat for the garner,
these cockle and tares to be bundled up for the fire: the wicked seem more
excellent outwardly, but they are like painted Sepulchers, like rotten wood
shining in a dark night; the godly are like a plain leather Casket, with a
precious Pearl therein of unspeakable worth: Turn them which way you will, if
both in prosperity, infinite odds, one being the child of God, the other of
the Devil; the godly has more joy and peace in well-doing, then the wicked of
all their jollity; the ones prosperity is a pledge of better things in Heaven,
the others is sent in wrath to fat them to their destruction: If both in
adversity alike, yet infinite odds; the one chastened of God, as a Father does
his children, for their great good, the other pursued in vengeance, by a just
Judge, as fore-goers of greater plagues; for the one Gods arrows are dipped in
poison, for the other, the poison is taken away in Christ's Sufferings; On the
one God has promised to lay no more then they are able to bear, the other have
no such promise; the one have Gods promise to comfort and uphold them in them,
as also assurance, as of good by it, so of a good and happy end, and after this
life their joys to begin, that never shall end, but the other have no such
promises; nay, when this life ends, then shall begin their Torments, which
shall never end; nay, put the godly in the greatest misery that can be, and the
ungodly in the greatest jollity, like Dives and Lazarus, or if ye will chain
the one in a Dungeon about his feet, middle and neck, and let the other ride in
all pomp, and with all the attendance and honor that the world can afford, yet
the one is infinitely more happy then the other. In death the Righteous have
hope, the wicked none, but are either full of horror or blockish: After death
these go to Hell, those to Heaven; the children are taken up into the Chambers
of Christ, the Dogs and ungodly are cast out of doors: At the day of Judgment,
the one shall stand with comfort on the right hand, the other with terror on
the left, both being raised up: The wicked shall have the wound that death gave
them healed up (as Traitors be healed of their hurts, that they may come to
execution) and thereupon both in body and soul shall be cast into Hell fire;
though the one begin with joy, yet they end with woe; and though the other begin
heavily here, yet they end with joy in Heaven, and this life is nothing to
that is to come: Could we discern this, we would reverence the one highly, and
no less pity the others; yea, should the ones troubles here, infinitely exceed
the others jollities, or the troubles of the godly be here greater then they
are, as also the jollity of the wicked, we would not change with them.

1. This confuteth the blind world, Use 1.
that esteems basely of Gods servants, and of their state; but let us never
think the worse of our estate for them, as a plain rich man does not, when a
vain bragging fellow in brave apparel goes swaggering scornfully by him.

2. This may and ought wonderfully to comfort Gods servants, Use 2.
that has advanced them to this high dignity, passing by so many others: O
that we would walk worthy hereof in an holy and pure conversation.

3. This may be a choke to the wicked, Use 3.
notwithstanding all their jollity, and make them weary of their condition,
laboring to become godly, and of Gods house, that so they may be truly happy.

What shall the end of them be that obey not the Gospel of God?] Here Is employed,

1. That though the afflictions of Gods people be many and great, yet they are
nothing in respect of the miseries which shall befall the ungodly: The
afflictions of the godly not comparable to the miseries of the ungodly.
The Lord is Judge of all the world, and he will deal justly and equally, even
give every one according to their works: If therefore he afflict his children
with rods, he will plague his enemies with scourges; Genesis 18. 5.
if he will not bear with sin in his own servants that are careful to please
him, Romans 2. 6.
and stand in awe, and yet be overtaken, then he will be dreadfully revenged of
those that make a trade of sin; if his children in their conversion, and often
afterward upon any sin committed, have gripes of Conscience, and suffer the
terrors of God, See Psalm. 78. 55. 65.
then shall the wicked have a gnawing Worm that shall never dye; Isa. 27. 27.
if those be brought, as it were, along by Hell, these shall be left and
swallowed up of Hell: Ier. 25. 29. and 49. 12.
The Lord began with the Israelites in Captivity, but ended with the Egyptians,
in drowning them in the Red Sea; the three Children were put into the fiery
Furnace, not burnt, but fire seized on them that put them in; Daniel was put
into the Lions Den, but his Enemies and Accusers were devoured; Israel was
carried Captive, but Ashur destroyed; the children are beaten with the rod,
thereafter its burnt; God chastens his for a few days here to their amendment,
but the wicked shall be cast into eternal fire. In reading, hearing and seeing
what grievous things the Lord has laid on his own children, the wicked may
see, as in a glass, the woeful state that abides them.

2. That the torments prepared for the ungodly in death and at the day of
Judgment, The ungodly's misery cannot be expressed.
are such as cannot be expressed: The Apostle knew that they should have a
fearful end; but utter the further end of it, and lay it out to the full, he
could not, therefore is forced to say, What shall be the end? 1 John 3. 2.
Its a wonderful love of God, that he has made us his Children, but yet its
not manifest what we shall be, that is, 1 Cor. 2. 9.
it cannot be expressed what happiness is prepared for us: Eye has not seen, nor
ear has not heard, what God has prepared for his children: So cannot any
decypher the fearfulness of the woe prepared for the ungodly: Such shall be
separated from God and from his Saints, and have their portion with the Devil
and damned: O the universality of their torments, both in respect of their
bodies and souls! O the greatness of their pangs, tormented with fire and
brimstone! O the eternity of them! They shall be world without end: If a man in
pain should shed a tear or drop of water from his eye once in a thousand years,
and no more, yet sooner should he make a whole Sea, before this time will end.

1. O what an iron scourge should this be to drive the wicked to repentance,
Use 1.
not resting till they know they be freed from this woeful lake! O let them
never glory in their prosperity, as long as they are in danger hereof! If any
will not break off their sins and fear, they will prove costly profits and
pleasures; and they that will not believe and fear here, shall feel them to
eternal destruction hereafter.

2. How should this glad the hearts of all Gods people, Use 2.
that know themselves freed from this fearful lake, and make them walk
cheerfully and obediently all their days, to the honor of him that by his
sufferings has freed them therefrom; yea, should we not bear our few
afflictions patiently, being freed from these endless and easeles ones, and not
to envy at the prosperity of the wicked, seeing it shall have such an end? let
their beginning be what it will be, if this be their end, God keep us from
having any part therein.

That obey not the Gospel of God.] Disobedience to the Gospel a grievous sin.
The wicked are described by their disobedience to the Gospel, and these are
indeed the most wicked, and and have the fearfullest answer to make, and the
lowest or worst place in Hell; they shall speed worst, for their sin is
greatest: For what a favor of God is it, not only to give Christ to the world,
but then to publish him by the Gospel, being the glad tidings of Salvation, to
all of what sort soever, though never so mean, never so great sinners, there is
mercy upon their unfeigned humiliation, and such God sends his Ministers to
beseech men to be reconciled: O this is an unspeakable f^vor, as that the
contempt thereof must needs deserve a fearful damnaton! That men should
continue yet in their sins, and have no mind ^ Christ as a King and Savior,
Simile.
is fearful: If a company of Rebels^ad a pardon proclaimed, and sent out to so
many as would come in, fany would stand out and refuse the Kings grace and
favor, were he ^t worthy to be cut off? It shall be easier for Sodom and
Gomorrah in ^e day of Judgment, then for these people: Heb. 2. 2.
If they that despised the^aw were not unpunished, how shall they be dealt
withal that desp^ the Gospel? The higher they are lift up, the lower they shall
be casdown.

1. This rebuts the most part; Use 1.
Howsoever they talk of the Gospel, and come^t Church, and cry, The temple of
the Lord, the temple of the Lord, yet ^ey yield not obedience thereto, but
continue in their sins: There are ^w that come to see any such need of Christ,
as highly to prize him, a^ most earnestly to seek him; though some would have
Christ the Savior, and will have Jesus Christ in their mouths, yet few will
sto^ to his yoke, to renounce all their lusts, and yield up themselves in
abbedience to his will, but either will live in all their sins, or only yid in
what they list, and so trample the precious blood of Christ unde^^eir feet, and
despise the gracious offer of mercy: One would think th^very man hearing such a
gracious voice, and offer of a Savior, sh^ld fly to it, and that it should
suffer violence, every one saying, O ^me embrace it, let me, as they did at the
Pool of Bethesdai: John 5. 4.
O ^t at the stirring of the water some might step in; There might b^ne at
once, but here if an hundred would, they should all be closed.

2. O then me your benefit of the Gospel, Use 2.
by yielding obedience thereto; Belie and repent, and then happy are ye that
ever ye heard, else you shall c^t the time that ever you heard the Gospel: O
ungrateful world! unhappy company! It will vex them, and increase their
torment, ^ee that mercy was offered so often, and yet they like woeful caytiffs
despise the same; to obey the Gospel, is the note of a good christian: let
appear by thy hearty obedience thereto, that thou art such a one.

Verse 18. And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and
the sinner appear?
HE proceeds still in the foregoing reason, taken from the comparison between
the good and the wicked; whereof the former, though they have many troubles and
afflictions, yet they shall in the end be eternally blessed, and saved in
Heaven, though with some difficulty; the latter, though they flourish and
prosper for a while, and many of them persecute the former, yet they shall end
their life with misery that cannot be expressed, and have a fearful appearance
before God on the last day: If the righteous Servants of God get hardly to
Heaven, the wicked, how glorious soever in this world, shall never be able to
appear in Judgment before God, but in a most fearful manner, which is not set
down by a bare affirmation, but by way of interogation, for the greater force:
where there is comfort for Gods Children, notwithstanding their troubles, and
the wickeds prosperity, they shall be saved, and terror for the wicked,
notwithstanding all their present jollity, their end shall be fearful.

Speak we first of the position; The righteous are scarcely saved; then of the
comparison, if it be so, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?

If the righteous] Hereby we are to understand, not such as be perfectly
righteous in themselves, and without sin; for if there be any such (as there is
none) they should not scarcely, and with difficulty be saved, but according to
that, do this and live, easily and without stop: Even the most perfect have not
been without their own failings; there was impatience in Job, Mat 9. 13.
infidelity in Zachary, etc. not meant the righteous in their own conceits, for
these shall never be saved, as for whom Christ came not; nor such as having
attained some common gifts, as of knowledge, to profess to reform some things,
etc. seem to themselves and others righteous, Whom we are here to understand by
righteous.
but yet are not so truly, but as the seed sown on the stony ground, and the
house built on the sand; but such as be truly righteous, though not perfectly,
yet in some respect perfectly to; See Ezekiel. 28.
namely, 1. By the righteousness of Christ Jesus imputed unto them by Faith:
They that have their sins pardoned in his death, and his righteousness imputed
to them, are truly righteous, yea, and perfectly too, as ever they shall be in
heaven. 2. By inherent righteousness, wrought in the hearts of Gods Children
and Believers, by the Spirit of Sanctification, whereby they be sanctified
throughout, though not perfectly, yet those God vouchsafes to call righteous,
though they be but so in part, and have remnants of corruption abiding in them,
yet they are so called from the better part, as an heap of corn that lies on
the floor, though there be chaff in it, and that much. 3. For that they
endeavor, and daily labor after more righteousness; as one is called a
Scholar, or by the name of the trade he is entered into, though happily he can
do but a little, only endeavors for skill and knowledge therein: Of which
elsewhere.

1. This sets out the exceeding goodness and mercy of God, Use 1.
that vouchsafes thus to come and call such poor and sinful creatures as we
be, pestred with such a deal of blindeness, and so manifest corruptions; yet
seeing he sees an heart in us to hate them, and suppress them, he will not
reckon of us after them; and though we have but a little grace, yet because it
is true, and of his own working that we have, and that we would fain have more,
he accounts of us according to that we would be, and not that we are.

2. This is an exceeding comfort to Gods true Servants; Use 2.
can we believe Christ's righteousness imputed to us, and feel we an universal
and true change in us, then may we rejoice; God calls us by glorious names,
Saints, Holy ones, Righteous, let us not then be dismayed at our imperfections
or corruptions, which we labor to mortify; lets not say with some, because of
them we are none of the Lords, we have such sinful hearts, etc. Neither let us
suffer the Devil to pluck our Crown from us, or rob us of our comfort, making
us believe that we be none of the Lords; as some few be thus in danger,
especially at first, though many Christians make too light of their sins; as
long as God speaks so graciously, let us not believe what Satan our adversary
says, only let us care to grow more and more in grace.

3. This rebukes those wretched mockers that reproach the Servants of God, Use
3.
that labor to please God, and dare not do as they: O you be of the righteous,
you be so righteous, etc. Is not this right like Ishmaels mocking of Isaac? O
you be the Son of the promise, you are the dainty one, etc. Such shall be shut
out with Ishmael, unless by repentance they prevent it: Why say you thus?
because you think it to good a name for them? Is thine eye evil, because Gods
is good? what have thou to do, seeing God calls them so? or is it because thou
would not have them so? 1 Cor. 6. 9.
Yes; but if thou be not also so, thou shall never inherit the Kingdom of
Heaven.

Scarcely be saved,] Hereby is not meant rarely, or that but a few righteous
ones shall be saved; Acts 10. 4^.
For whosoever believes shall be saved; and to every one that does good shall
be glory, Romans 2. 7. and 8. 1.
and honor, and immortality; and There is no condemnation to them, or any of
them that are in Christ Jesus: Nor is it meant, that there will be difficulty
at the day of Judgment, whether they should pass or no, have or miss
Salvation; no, for God knows who be his, and their names be all written in
the Book of Life; Mat. 7. 22.
and if they were righteous here, and had the Spirit, the seal of their
Redemption, and earnest of their Inheritance, as they pass to it at death, so
shall they have no stop at the day of judgment. Among earthly Judges, when a
cause has gone current on a man's side a great while, yet at last, either by
corruption of Jury or Judge, or by some evidence come to light, not seen
before, all may be dashed and turned the other way: It shall not be so at Gods
judgment seat; Its an hard thing for a man to get to Heaven.
there will be question made of the damnation of some, but no question made of
the salvation of any of the godly: But the difficulty is in this life; its an
hard thing for a man to get to heaven (called therefore a Straight gate, Mat.
7. 14.
and Narrow way) a hard thing to come to be a Christian, a converted person,
and an hard thing to continue therein, and grow forward. God has much ado to
bring us to grace, and then much ado to hold us therein; as he had a great deal
ado to get his people out of Egypt, and into Canaan, sometimes themselves by
murmuring, lingering, etc. and sometimes others, as Pharaoh, the Red Sea, etc.
proving hindrances thereto; so has he to get one of us out of the bondage of
the Devil; out of the Egypt of sin: The Devil holds, the world hinders, yea,
our own wretched nature is not willing to come out: What a stir has he? how
many Sermons, Threatenings, Promises, secret gripes of Conscience, Warnings of
the Spirit, purposes to come out, and yet keep in still, ere we will yield?
yea, how is God fain almost to pull us out by some crosses or sharp
afflictions, as the Angels pulled Lot out of Sodom; how hardly are we thoroughly
humbled for our sins? when cast down, how hardly comforted? when we have got
it, how hardly do we keep it? what a stir with our hearts to leave our old
courses and take new? and when we have begun, yet what ado to hold out? what
revolting and backsliding hearts have we? ready to wax cold, and to linger
after our old lusts, so hard it is to do any good duty well. The Devil, like
Pharaoh, pursues us, and labors by all means possible to hinder us from all
good altogether, or from the right performance of it, so also to draw us to all
evil: Then the world like Pharaohs Soldiers, labors to hinder us by their ill
example, by ill counsel, by vails of profits and pleasures, and if these not,
by reproaches and troubles that it will raise up. Our own Nature is worst of
all, as having a lingering after our old sins, as the Israelites after the
fleshy pots of Egypt; sometimes we think like them, we shall never hold out,
there be such lets in the way, high walls, and Anakims, etc. so that we get
forward hardly; as a man that were to go up a steep hill, and had three great
weights hung at his back; so that we have such continual need of the Word,
Sacraments, Prayer, Meditation, Conference, Watchfulness, that unless hereby,
we wax cold, and grow out of order; nay, notwithstanding all these, yet what
ado to keep our hearts and lives in order, and our selves within compass, but
we slip and stumble, and grieve, and up again, and down again; yea, if the Lord
to all these means should not add some one or other affliction, it would be
yet more hard: The Lord is fain to pull us with that strong cord also, and this
is chiefly meant here, they are scarcely saved, even because they are forced to
be brought through many troubles; so that as a man that is to climb such a
steep hill, as he cannot fasten his feet, but is fain to get Daggers in his
hands, and sticking them into the ground, etc. may be said hardly to get up;
Simile.
and as when two Armies fight for a Town, one while one part prevails, another
while the other, at last the better side prevails, but notwithout much pains,
many wounds, shrewd blows, and continual labor, we may say, They got the Town
hardly; the like may be said in this particular: Who knows not the truth
hereof in his own experience? how hardly can thou be humbled? how hardly
drawn to renounce thy lusts? how art thou fain to wrestle before thou can do
any good? what continual need have thou of prayer, good company, etc. yea, who
knowing any thing, sees not he has need of his crosses, and that it was good
for him that he was afflicted?

1. This crosses the most gross, Use 1.
and yet most common conceit of the world, that its an easy matter to be
saved, that there is no need of such preciseness, but that if men mean well, God
will be content, and though one have lived badly, yet at what time soever they
repent (for which a quarter of an hour is enough) it shall be well with them;
and hence it is, that the Word and our Preaching is of such small account, and
that so few take any pains to be saved, but take pains for the belly and back,
and to grow rich, etc. Ignorant persons look not out, but content themselves
with a blind good meaning, without any part of a good life; so profane
persons, so worldlings, so civil ones: Though the Scripture requires us to
labor, strive, give all diligence, study, seek, yet will not they take any
pains; nay, not only so, but they laugh and gibe at them that labor herein, as
fools or idle persons: What art thou woeful wretch, that dare cross the Lord
so directly? He says, Its a strait way, and few find it; and to this end,
bids Strive; Thou say its no such matter: If it were as thou dotest, Christ
might not only have spared those speeches, but indeed the whole Scriptures;
for what use of any, but to bid people live as they list, and at last cry God
mercy, and all is well: No, God must make new Scriptures, and chalk a new way
to Heaven, ere ever thou shall find that thou look for: But what art thou,
that neither wiltst take pains to save thine own soul, nor can be content
that others should? Do thou think that they be idle persons that take pains
to hear the word? O, they could follow the world, and that too hard, but that
they know one thing is needful: Could they not sit at home in their chairs, or
keep their beds, as well as rise and toil, etc. but that they know that they
cannot so get Heaven, but that they have need to use all means, and that little
enough, though thou see no such thing: Indeed, to lead a careless life, to do
good if it come in the way, and if ill come in the way, to be as fit for that,
etc. a few Sermons, and little hearing may serve for such a life, but this is
not the way to get Heaven: If ever thou would be saved, thou must change thy
mind, and practice and believe the Scriptures, that its a strait way, and
accordingly bend thy self to begin to take pains, to see and confess thy sins,
to labor for faith, to turn to God, to strive against the Flesh, the World and
Devil; thus as hard as it is, thou may prevail. O strive whilst thou may,
for many shall strive that shall not enter in, and thank God a thousand times,
that thus striving thou may obtain.

2. Let every man prove whether he be in the strait way or not: Use 2.
Many say, They thank God they have ever been of a good belief, and never
doubted of Gods good will in their lives, and that they thank God they have a
good mind ever, and can serve God with all their hearts, and that they are not
troubled with any such temptations as they hear some complain of, and that they
thank God they be not so wicked, that they should need so many Sermons as some
do; and that they have ever prospered, and have had as few crosses as any body,
etc. These will think ill of me to unsettle them, but their state is too
smooth, and too easy to be the way to Heaven, its rather the broad green way
to Hell: They that never doubted, never believed, that have been ever good,
were never good; so they that have had no dumps nor fears at any time: For
Christ calls none but sinners, but the heavy laden; they that can serve God
with all their heart, without any trouble, the Devil has them sure some other
way, and therefore troubles them not in their duties, because he knows they be
but lost labor, done in hypocrifie, or else he draws away their minds, and
they feel it not: Those that can do well without resistance, be better then St.
Paul, Romans 7. 19.
who could not do the good he would; its a sign they be all flesh, for were
there any Spirit in them, there would be opposition; let such know, their state
is naught: This way will never bring them to Heaven; what would you have or
lose all this time? better begin twice, then be damned once.

On the other side, some say, They have gone a troublesome way, and full of
labor and difficulty, have much ado to be humbled, much to get comfort, then
much to hold it, so that they have had much strife with themselves for some
lusts, and to take up some duties; much ado with their old companions, and that
they can do no good but with such opposition and pain, as Pray, Read, Hear,
etc. and what a stir they have to bridle their nature (and have had no more but
needs) many crosses, etc. Simile.
let these be of good comfort; this is a sign of the way to Heaven: and as a
man that is going to some Inheritance, being before informed of the rugged miry
and troublesome way he must go through, finding it so, though it somewhat
trouble him, yet it more joys him, that hereby he knows he is in his way; so
cannot it but rejoice those that thus labor, as knowing that they are in their
way: let us be of good comfort, and strive still, and we shall at last get to
Heaven, and be saved, though it be thus scarcely and with difficulty; for
faithful is he that has promised, who shall separate us from his love? He that
that has begun the good work in us, will perfect it; The gates of Hell shall
not be able to prevail against us, we shall get to Heaven in spite of the
Devil, the World, and our own Lusts: Our Father is stronger then they; That Is a
racking uncomfortable opinion of Rome, that men may strive all their days, and
at last lose all: No, woe were then to us; If our Salvation were in our own
keeping, it might and would be lost.

3. This teaches all Gods Servants to take pains, Use 3.
and strive hard to get to Heaven; even Gods Servants are herein faulty, that
they think it not so hard to be saved, and therefore are the more secure and
lazy, take too little pains, watch not, put not on their armor, labor for no
more grace then they had seven years ago: O lets strive more against our lusts,
labor for more strength and grace, pray, hear, meditate, watch continually,
etc. Its not praying once a day will serve us, but as often as we have need,
else if we spare our pains herein, and be negligent in these duties, we shall
smart another way, fall the more into sin, have the more discomfort, bring more
labor and charge upon our selves, as he that lets his house go out of
reparation to avoid trouble and charge; nay, how often meet we with crosses
upon neglect of these duties? O whilst others are increasing their iniquities,
and making more rods for themselves, let us these holy days and vacation time
take pains to further our selves to Heaven; And as Travelers cheer up one
another, lend one another their hand to help them up, if they be down, or an
high or slippery place; so let us help one another to Heaven all that we can:
Neither let us be unwilling to undergo afflictions, nor impatient under them,
but rather bear them quietly and thankfully, seeing they help us up this hill
of Sanctification to Heaven.

Where shall the ungodly and sinner appear?] If they that take great pains, yet
get hardly to Heaven, then what shall become of them that lay down the rein,
doing what they list, and taking no pains at all; Here Is the comparison,
showing the woeful state remaining for the wicked at the last day: By ungodly,
we are to understand such as live wickedly, and indeed as if there were no God.
Heaven or Hell; and by sinners, such as go on impenitently in their sins,
whether ignorants, profane persons, 1 John 1. 8.
civil persons, or Hypocrites: All are sinners, and if we say we have no sin,
we deceive our selves; yet there be of them, which have sin in them, whom God
will call righteous; but of the workers of iniquity, of those that make as it
were a trade of sin, and return a great deal, being great dealers therein, our
Apostle is here to be understood.

These two, He that is not righteous is ungodly and a sinner.
ungodly and sinner, be opposed to righteous, so that whosoever is not righteous,
is an ungodly one and a sinner: If such being reproved shall say, Are not all
of you sinners? are you without sin? and shall think thus to hide themselves;
let them know, that the righteous (though not without sin) do both hate sin,
and purpose against it before, strive against it at the present, and are sorry
after they have committed the same, none of which are found in these ungodly
and sinners.

Where shall they appear?] He asks not because he knew not, for he knew they
should and must appear before the Judgment seat of Christ, 2 Cor. 5. 10.
and knew also that they should be set on the left hand, to hear that dreadful
sentence pronounced against them, Go ye cursed of my Father, etc. but speaks
thus to show the fearfulness of their state; for its more then if he had said,
They shall appear to condemnation, Where shall they appear? The fearfulness of
the ungodlies condition on the day of Judgment cannot be expressed.
as if he could not express what a fearful appearance they should have: To flee
therefrom they cannot, whether should they, all being on fire? To resist they
cannot, they have nothing wherewith, they are naked of their pomp and retinue:
Hide themselves they cannot from his all-seeing eye; to abide the presence of
this Judge, is impossible: O they will then call to the hills to cover them! we
think that the Jews, Judas, Pilate, and the Soldiers, shall have a fearful
appearance, but many among our selves shall have a worse then some of them: Do
not we prefer our lusts before Christ, as the Jews did Barrabas? Do not many
among us pierce him with their sins? Crucify him again, persecute him in his
Members? This will not be the state only of poor snekes, or of the common
multitude, but of the greatest and mightiest potentates, Nimrods, Giants: O
these shall wail before him, beating their knees one against another!

They that have sit as Judges of Gods Servants in their Velvet coats and Gold
Chains, shall now stand naked before this Judge: Here they dare appear any
where, yea, where Gods Servants oftentimes care not for appearing, but we shall
one day appear with joy, where they shall not show their faces.

O that this might strike terror into wicked men's hearts, Use.
to think of this day, and might be a choke to all their ungodly profits and
pleasures: O this day will pay for all! O that they could be persuaded now to
kiss the Son, now to humble themselves before him, now to stoop to him, and
embrace him as their Savior; yet how many wicked wretches be there, that will
hope to be saved as well as the best, even notorious ones? O fearful impudency!
you saved, then who shall be damned? The Turks and Heathens that know not God.
True, but not with such a destruction as shall befall you, your stripes shall be
worse and more then theirs, your day is coming, you have had the start of Gods
Children, you have been first in prosperity, as they in trouble, but ere long
their mourning shall be turned into mirth, your joy into everlasting misery.

Verse 19. Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit
the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful Creator.
THe conclusion, containing an Exhortation to commend and commit our selves and
our state in all our troubles to God, holding on our good course, and keeping a
good conscience, without turning awry one way or other, who both can, being our
Almighty Creator, and will, being faithful in all his promises, whereof he has
many of protecting and defending his Servants, who will either deliver them out
of their troubles, or give them strength to bear them, and when their life
shall end, will take up their souls to Heaven, keeping their bodies to a joyful
resurrection.

This also has the force of another Reason to persuade to the point in hand,
namely, patience and joyfulness in troubles, and may be gathered thus: If we
may in all our troubles (as long as we keep a good conscience in them)
confidently commend our selves to God, in assurance to be cared for, as shall
be best for us, then ought we to be joyful in our troubles; but the former is
true, therefore the latter. Here Is an Exhortation to commend our selves to God
in our troubles; those are described by the efficient cause of them, they come
by the will of God, whereunto* Reasons are annexed to move us to commend our
selves to God in them. 1. Because of his omnipotency. 2. Because of his
faithfulness; To all which is added a caution, how far forth we may commend our
selves to God in our troubles, namely, in welldoing, even so long as we be
careful to continue in our uprightness without swerving.

Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God,] Here note, That

Whatsoever troubles befall us in this life, The troubles of the godly are by
his appointment.
either afflictions from the hand of God, for chastisement or persecution from
the world, for our trial, etc. that they come not to us by chance, or the will
of the Devil or man without God, but by the determinate purpose and counsel of
God: But of this before.

Commit the keeping of their souls to him, etc.] Here note, That

God has a care and special regard of his Servants in the time of all their
trouble and adversity of what kind soever: God is careful of his children in
the time of their troubles.
He cannot forget them, they be as the apple of his eye: There are infinite
promises of God to this purpose, Isa. 49. 8, 15.
in the Psalms and Prophets: He will either deliver them out of their dangers,
as Let, Noah, Daniel, etc. or comfort and provide for them, as for Joseph in
Prison, whom at last he advanced, as he did also David and Jeremiah; else he
will strengthen them to bear their pains, give them faith and patience to bear
all the malice and torments of their Enemies, as he did Steven, and the holy
Martyrs, that had such invincible courage and constancy, as they wearied their
tormentors, even in the middle of their torments singing Psalms: See Rev. 6. 9.
And their souls and bodies being parted, he takes their souls to himself into
Heaven, in the mean time reserving their bodies safely to a joyful
resurrection: Neither is it any wonder, For

He has created them, Reasons.
redeemed them with his Sons blood, sanctified them, preserved them, and
prepared Heaven for them, ere the world was.

This teaches Gods Children in all their troubles, Use.
of what kind or degree soever, See 2 Timothy 1. 12.
to commend themselves into his hand, with confidence and assured trust, that
he will take care of them, and dispose of them to the best, etc. Let Us never be
dismayed, but cast our care, and roll our selves upon the Lord: be we assured
that he will be with us, and not fail us: He is Almighty, and can do it; He is
also most loving, Rev. 2. 10.
and has made many promises in his Word so to do: Be we faithful unto the
death, Heb. 10. 23.
and he will give us a Crown of life: Faithful is he that has promised: He
loves that we should rely on him: If it be poverty, sickness, Psalm. 9. 10.
pain, persecution, etc. say not, I shall never be able to get through it, but
cast thy self on God, who never failed any that put their trust in him: Do not
we rely on our selves? for this were the way to fail, like Peter and Origin,
who fell shamefully; but trust in God, Pray, use all good means, and set thy
faith on work to depend on God, to be well carried through thy trouble to the
end, and from death to Heaven: Thus did our Savior, and after him St. Steven,
commend their Spirits into the hands of God: O our unbelieving hearts, that
fail as soon as any great trial comes, as the Israelites upon Pharaoh's
pursuing them; yea, are ready to sink, to be dismayed, to put our hand to some
unlawful means: If we had faith enough, what Victories might we get, what
Conquerors might we be? we shrink and are dismayed as if we had none to trust
in, or as if God were not Almighty, or had made no promises, or at least were
not faithful: O let us rebuke our unbelief, and gather up our selves and Gods
promises, and examples of his goodness to his, and rest upon them, as on an
unmovable foundation.

In well-doing,] Such as continue in well-doing, may comfortably commend
themselves unto God.
While we continue in a good course, without turning out of the way, we may
comfortably commend our selves to God, but not otherwise: If we falter and
shift for our selves, and put our our hands to unlawful means, then God takes
no charge of us, then have we cut off our selves from all hope and comfortable
commending our selves to him; with what face can we so do, and what promise
have we when we have broken our faithfulness?

1. Therefore be we persuaded, Use 1.
that our greatest comfort in our trouble must be to stick close to God, and so
long God has tied himself to us; but if we shall do otherwise, we defeat our
selves of this: Therefore in what danger soever we be, let us never put out our
hands to unlawful means, as to run to wizards, in poverty to steal, in any
danger to forfeit a good conscience: Our comfort is then gone, and Gods promise
belongs no further to us, at least till we humble our selves, and be reconciled
upon our repentance for it.

2. No ungodly man in any strait can have any warrant or comfort to commend his
soul or case to God, Use 2.
where has God made any such promise to such? nor can they in their death; A
bad man cannot say, Lord, receive my soul; upon what acquaintance? God knows
not this soul; Its not redeemed, washed; It has not used to serve him, no such
unclean souls ever came, or shall come to Heaven; No, they go to him whom they
have served: they that have given their souls to God in believing and obeying
here, may with comfort yield up their souls, and say, Lord, The soul thou
gave me, and have redeemed, sanctified, preserved, and with which I have
unfainedly served thee, or which now in suffering, I have sacrificed for thee,
I do now commend it to thy keeping: This soul God will most readily take, its
more his then thine, he loves it well: But for a wicked man, either he cannot
have the face to commend his soul to God, as wherewith he has at no time
served him, but the Devil his Enemy, or if he be so impudent, God will take no
knowledge thereof.

In well-doing.] Such may confidently commend themselves to God, which labor
for the good of their persecutors.
This may be taken particularly for patience, and freeness from revenging our
selves of them that persecute us; for should we so do, God would not take
charge of us; but if we pray for them, love them, wish their good, we may the
more confidently commend our selves to God: O then rely we on God, and in all
constancy in well-doing commend we our selves to him in much assurance, as unto
a faithful Creator. Use.


CHAP. V.
THe Apostle proceeds in holy Exhortations to sundry excellent and necessary
duties and virtues, from the beginning of this Chapter to the tenth verse, from
which to the end; The Contents of this Chapter.
there is the conclusion of the Epistle: The Exhortations be either Special or
General; Special, to some special kinds of persons, as to Ministers, and to
the younger sort; Ministers, from the beginning to the fifth verse, young folks,
in the fifth and sixth: The General belongs to all, being to Faith, to rely on
God, to sobriety, watchfulness, etc. of which in particular, when we shall come
unto them.

Verse 1. The Elders which are among you, I exhort, who am also an Elder, and a
witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that
shall be revealed.
THe Apostle knowing that there are three vices incident and very hurtful to
the Ministry and Ministers of the Word of God, The duties of Ministers, with
reasons to enforce the same.
namely, Idleness, Covetousness, and Pride, seeks to prevent these in all
Ministers, by exhorting them to the diligent and faithful performance of their
duties belonging to them; namely, 1. To feed the flock of God, that is, to
Preach the wholesome Word of God diligently to them. 2. To take the oversight
thereof, that is, to have a special care of them, and regard of all their lives
and behavior, applying themselves to them accordingly. 3. To be examples to
them of pure, humble, and godly conversation; nor does he only exhort to the
doing of these, but to the right manner of performing the same: They must be
done, 1. Not by constraint, that is, out of fear of Gods wrath, or force of
men's Laws, but willingly. 2. Not for filthy lucre, but of a ready and free
mind, seeking Gods glory and the peoples Salvation. 3. Not being lordly or
haughty in their carriage, but examples of humility and godliness: The Reasons
whereby he urges the same are diverse; The 1. taken from his own person, verse
1. where are three motives to persuade them to obey his counsel, even for that
he was a Minister as they were, a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a
partaker of the glory to come in Heaven. The 2. For that the people were Gods
flock and his heritage. The 3. For that they did depend on them for instruction
and means of Salvation. The 4. For that hereupon they should receive a Crown of
glory that fades not away.

Speak we first of those duties in general, then in particular.

In general, Ministers being here instructed in their duty as people elsewhere:
Note,

1. That the Scripture is not partial, The Scriptures inform every one of their
duty.
binding some to duty, and leaving others at liberty, but indifferently
teaches all; yea, the greater place that any is in, the more duty it requires
(every honor carrying a burden of duty) and the more need have such to do
their duties for the example of others: Above all others, Ministers have most
need both to be instructed in their's, and also to perform the same; for on
theirs depends the well-doing of the people, both in their general and special
callings: for how shall the people have these things, if they receive them not
from the Ministers of God put apart for that end? how shall they else be either
good Christians, or good Magistrates, Simile.
Husbands, Householders, etc. If the great wheel of the clock that should turn
all the rest do stand still, so also must all the rest.

1. When people are informed of their duties, Use 1.
and amongst others, of their duties toward their Ministers, as of love,
honor, reverence, obedience, maintenance, etc. they must yield thereto, not
think much hereof, for God has laid as great a burden on their Ministers,
which they are charged with, yea, they must be thankful to God, that has had
such a special care of their souls, as so weightily to charge Ministers
therewith; as its no small comfort to the poor, that God has taken such order
for them by so many commandments, so many promises also, and threats to the
rich: People also ought in any wise to be careful of their own souls, and join
with the Lord in care, who is so careful of them: Heavy is the state, and will
be the answer of many people, who though they see this care in God to command
his Ministers to preach diligently, to care for them, to give them good
example, which according to their charge they do, yet they mind nothing, nor
are ever the better, by feeding, care or example.

2. For Ministers, Use 2.
they must take heed, that having gotten into this calling, and a living on
their backs, they do not think themselves at liberty to do what they will,
something or nothing, or but a little, and that when they list, and look for
much reverence, obedience, and maintenance, and care not to do their part, and
to procure this, and deserve it from the people; but to know that they are as
much tied to their duty, and shall be countable to God: Its an easy matter to
look for much, Acts 20. 35.
but its more worthy of a Minister to perform much: Its a more blessed thing to
give then to receive: Let us therefore know we stand charged deeply by our
office, and by how much our calling is more excellent, and the trust more that
has been laid upon us, so much the stricter account we must make.

2. That the calling of the Ministry is a very painful calling; The calling of
the Ministry a painful calling.
The duties here exhorted unto imply the same. Hence it is, that its called a
work, a worthy work, a laboring in the Word and Doctrine, yea, its a most high
and honorable calling: Hence it is, that Ministers are called Stars, the light
of the World, the salt of the Earth, Angels, Ambassadors, such as are employed
about the highest things, the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, etc. for the gaining of
men's souls, whereas Physicians take care of their bodies, and Lawyers of their
Estates; They are appointed of God, as instruments to open the eyes of the
blind, and to translate them out of the power of darkness to the power of God,
and of children of wrath, to make them the children of God; Here Is honor
indeed, but not without labor: Their titles of Builders, Husbandmen, Soldiers,
Watchmen, Shepherds, etc. do also imply the same: This burden of the
Ministry, was after a sort prefigured by the burden of the Ark which was
imposed upon the Priests, See Downham of the duty and dignity of the Ministry,
page 17.
wherein was the golden Pot with Manna, Aarons budding Rod, the two Tables of
the Covenant, and upon the Ark, the propitiatory overshadowed with the glorious
Cherubims: By the Manna, we may understand the Sacraments; By the Rod,
Ecclesiastical Discipline; By the budding and fruitfulness of it, their
fruitful conversation; By the Tables, the Preaching of the Law; The
Propitiatory signified Christ, understood the ministry of reconciliation,
committed to the Ministers of God, both in respect of Prayer, and also of
Preaching. Again, to Preach painfully, what preparation is required hereto?
what Reading, Meditation, Prayer, Labor of the mind, etc? and for the delivery
thereof, it spends not only the outward, but the vital parts, and wastes the
Spirit, which being hurt, is hardliest helped. Again, to teach the ignorant,
convince the gainsayer, comfort the heavy, admonish the disobedient, exhort
them that be in a good way, pray for all, publicly and privately, watch to
withstand all the Devils assaults, rebuke the stubborn, have an eye to
heretics and deceivers, that creep in to beguil and lead away, especially new
converts that be in their first heart of love, persuading them (as some
Brownists have out of a proud discontented Spirit) that we are no Church, and
that Christ does not reign among us as King, etc. who will not accouut this a
laborious, hard, and difficult task?

1. This rebukes the common and base opinion of the world, Use 1.
that the Ministers calling is an idle calling, and that they do nothing for
their living, and that of all others they might best be spared. A. This is true
indeed of those which fleer, but feed not the flock, being mere drones and
ciphers, who should not eat, because they labor not, whose account shall be
fearful in respect of their idleness, and the taking of wages for which they
work not at all: But because some are such, are all so? Is the calling it self
an idle calling? have not men souls as well as bodies, and as much need of help
for the good of the one as of the other? Is there need of Physicians and
Lawyers, and not of Ministers? Has God ordained any other means whereby men
may come to Knowledge, Faith and Repentance? And is there not a labor of the
mind as well as of the body? Do the Prince, Counselors, Magistrates, etc.
nothing, because they work not with their hands? Their work is great, in
foreseeing and preventing dangers, in ordering things well: Simile.
Its in vain to pump the Ship, or for the Mariners to run up and down the
hatches, unless there be one that sits at the helm to guide it aright: And if
it be thus painful, then according to our Saviors testimony, Luke 10. 7.
The laborer is worthy of his hire; who goes on warfare at his own charge? 1
Cor. 9. 7.
Maintenance indeed is the thing the world grudgeth at; they could be as well
content with the Sexton, or some base person to read a little for five or ten
pounds a year, as a godly Preacher, who (say they) must have such a deal.

2. It rebukes them that live idly in this calling, Use 2.
evil beasts, slow bellies, mere idols, having eyes, they see not, etc. blind
guides: Woe be to them that live at ease in this painful work, it will be turned
to endless woe; when the laborers shall rest in Heaven, as having been good and
faithful Servants, the evil and unfaithful shall be bound hand and foot, and
thrown into utter darkness.

3. It teaches Parents what children to dedicate to God, Use 3.
for the service of the Ministry, even the best and fittest, not the weak and
lame: Genesis 4. 4.
Herein God is little beholding to them; Abel offered of the best in sacrifice:
In this calling there will be use of all the parts and strength of body and
mind; whosoever takes notice of this great work, finding his own inability to
Study, Preach, etc. through weakness, sickliness, etc. if he have a good
conscience, it cannot but be a great grief and trouble to him: And if they
intend their sons for the Ministry, let it be with this mind only, even that
they may prove painful and profitable laborers herein; there are too many which
have carnal ayms, that therein they may grow rich, live at their ease as
Gentlemen, etc. O woeful Parents, to bring up one to be a drone, a deceiver, a
robber, a murderer of souls, a ravening wolf, etc. Better thou had brought
him up to the basest lawful trade in the world; better thou had followed him
to the grave being young, for then, though he had gone to Hell, he should not
have been the means of many others ruin, to the increase of his damnation.

4. For those that would enter into the Ministry, Use 4.
let them beware what they do, and consider well, and tarry till they have a
calling, and let them not intend to live at ease, to follow their pleasures, to
gather riches, etc. but let them make their reckoning to prove Laborers, The
first Reason of the following duties taken from his own person, being one every
way fit to exhort them.
Soldiers, Watchmen, etc. else no coming here. Thus in general.

The elders which are among you, I exhort, etc.] This verse contains the
first Reason of the following Exhortation, which is taken from his own person,
being one every way fit to exhort them; namely, 1. An Elder and Minister as
well as they (for the name Elder, is of dignity and office here, and not of
age) who therefore knew what belonged to his place, and did what he required of
them to do. 2. A witness of Christ's sufferings, and so well acquainted with his
mind. 3. A partaker of the glory that shall be revealed, who therefore would
not exhort you unto any thing, whereby either I my self may be deprived hereof,
or you hindered from attaining hereunto.

1. In that he an Elder, exhorts them Elders, note, That

Ministers are fittest to teach Ministers, Ministers are fittest to teach one
another, and judge of one another actions.
and to judge of their actions. True, people may and ought try our Doctrine,
modestly and humbly; they may also dislike, and speak against foul things in
our life and conversation, but of things not so apparent, people must not be
ready to censure, 1 Cor. 14. 32.
much less think to teach their Ministers: For the spirits of the prophets are
subject to the prophets.

This rebukes the too much rashness and pride of some this way, Use.
ready to control every course of a Minister that is not pleasing to them, See
Hosea 4.
yea, their manner of teaching, profanely calling it railing, and that they
should have spoke thus and thus; when such dislike any thing in a Minister, it
were their wisdom to ask the judgment of some godly Minister, before they
censure or give judgment against him.

2. In that he requires nothing at their hands, but what he himself did, note,
That

The most forcible and profitable way of teaching, To practice the duties we
teach procures obedience thereto.
whether private or public, is, first, to do that in our own persons which we
require of others: Jesus did and taught: Parents may not rebuke swearing in
their children, and swear themselves: Householders bid their Servants go to
Church, Acts 1. 1^
and stay at home themselves, having no necessary occasion to keep them from
thence: Abraham was circumcised with his Household, Joshua and his Household
served God, the Jayler and his Household were baptized: He is not the best
Husband that puts over his work to be done by others, saying, Go: but who puts
his hand thereto, saying, Go we, etc. He is an ill Captain that bids his
Soldiers go fight, himself in the mean time tarrying behind; Its woeful
teaching by Ministers that do quite contrary: Shall we not condemn our selves,
while we call for that in another, which we our selves do not observe? Neither
is there likelihood that in such a case any will give ear unto us.

3. In that he besseecheth, Note, as his modesty and humility; So that

Peter was no Pope, Peter was no Pope, neither challenged any Supremacy.
had no Supremacy; was not Christ's Vicar, as the Pope of Rome affirms of him,
and challenges of him by succession: Had it been so, there had been no fitter
time wherein to have showed it, then this: Howsoever, what had it been to the
Pope, who has woefully degenerated? He calls himself a Pastor, yet challenges
authority over all the Church, not Kings themselves excepted: He is an hideous
Beast and Monster: If he send any commands, its not, I that am a
fellow-Minister, and that take pains in the same calling, do beseech you, but
he proudly thundereth and threatens, etc.

A witness of the sufferings of Christ] So be we, How Peter was a witness of
Christ's sufferings.
its an Article of our Faith, and we look thereby to be saved; but we are
witnesses only of that we have heard, he of that he saw; he was with him when
he was apprehended, when he was brought before the High Priest, etc. he was a
witness by seeing them, preaching them, imitating them. Now in that he urges
this as a reason to back his Exhortation, we may note,

1. That if we have any Credit, All that we have must be improved for the
Churches good.
Honor, Favor, Dignity, we ought to improve the same to the benefit of the
Church, and furthering of Gods cause.

2. That Ministers must use all Spiritual wisdom and skill to persuade unto
obedience; Spiritual wisdom to be used to procure obedience.
as cunning Chapmen, they must use many reasons to persuade Customers to buy
their Commodities.

3. That the troubles of Gods Ministers are so far from disgracing them, The
troubles of Gods Ministers procure them more respect.
as they honor them, and make their persons and counsel the more to be
regarded; for their sufferings are a seal to their Ministry, and show their
faithfulness; for those we should respect them the more, See Col. 1.
not think the worse of them.

And also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed.] Philem.
Here note briefly,

1. That we should much regard those and their counsels, Such as are heirs of
glory, should be much respected
whom we see much graced of God, and like to be heirs of glory.

2. That such as are Partners with Christ in suffering, shall also partake with
him in glory. They that suffer with Christ, shall reign with him.


3. That God has prepared glory for his Saints in Heaven.

4. That a man may come to know in this life, that he shall be partaker of the
glory of Heaven; whereof whosoever is as yet ignorant, he must endeavor by all
means to make it sure. Glory is laid up for the Saints in Heaven.


Q. How shall we come to know this?

A. If here we partake of grace, we shall hereafter partake of glory; on the
contrary, How we may know whether we shall be heirs of glory.
no grace, no glory, Lassure you: This knowledge is that which does here uphold
us amidst our many troubles; it is Mount Nebo, whence we see the Land of Canaan,
all the Grapes we have to comfort us in the wilderness of this world.

5. That Faith makes things invisible to be seen, Through faith Gods children
are even here possessed of Heaven.
things absent (as the glory here spoken of) to be present: Through this a
child of God has Heaven already in possession; whereinto his Soul shall enter
immediately after his death, Heb. 11. 1.
as his body also being coupled to his Soul on the day of Judgment: John 6. 47.
He that believes (says the Scripture) has eternal life; Romans 1. 30.
and, Whom he justified, them he also glorified.

Verse 2. Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready
mind.
THe first duty required of Ministers, is laid down in these words,

Feed the flock of God which is among you,] Feed, namely, by preaching the word
soundly and diligently; The flock of God, namely, The whole company which is
under your charge, which is not yours, but Gods, and that whether by creation,
as all are, or by redemption, as some are. Which is among you, or depends on
you for Instruction, Comfort and Direction.

Feed] This implies diverse things, as

1. That Ministers must preach the Word of God: Ministers must preach the word.
Now preaching is an opening of the Scriptures (wherein as many things be dark
and hard to be understood, which God has done in his great wisdom, to stir up
unto the search hereof; 1 Cor. 14. 3.
so there are wholesome instructions to be gathered, 2 Timothy 4. 2.
which every one cannot find out) and an applying thereof, for doctrine,
conviction, instruction, correction, comfort, etc. this preaching is feeding.
Ioh. 21. 16, 27
This is often required, as Mat. 28. 20. Mark 16. 15. 2 Timothy 4. 1, 2. 1 Cor. 9.
16.
its the note of a Ministers love to God and Christ Jesus; and the Apostle
calls for a woe on himself if he did not preach: Ephesians. 4. 11.
This is the Ordinance of God to convert souls, by working Faith and
Regeneration, Mat. 13. 24.
Acts 26. 18. Romans 10. 14. 1 Cor. 1. 21. and 3. 5. 1 Pet. 1, 23. This is the
means to edify and build up, Neh. 8. 8.
and therefore called the Kingdom of Heaven. This is the ancient Ordinance of
God, ever since the people so desired it, Exodus 20. 19. whereof we have
examples both in the Old Testament, as of Ezra, etc. and in the New, Acts 2. 41.
as of John Baptist, our Savior Christ, the Apostles, etc. This has been
powerful to this end, and by this was the world subdued, and this God is
pleased yet to use.

1. This condemns the Church of Rome, Use 1.
which makes a company of Ministers, but not to preach: If they can say Mass,
and therein offer Christ (as they say) as a Sacrifice Propitiatory for the
quick and the dead, that is enough.

2. It condemns all among our selves (whereof there yet remain too many in
this Land) that are in the room of Ministers, Use 2.
but feed not, either cannot or will not preach the Word; such are no feeders,
but starvers, See Hos. 4. 6.
blind leaders of the blind, Soul-slayers, blood-suckers, yea, worse then
Cannibals, as living of the blood of Souls, whereas these live on man's Flesh;
David's abstaining from drinking of the water of the well of Bethlehem, for
which he longed so much, as being purchased at such a rate, may condemn these
men: How can they escape the forementioned woe, 1 Cor. 9? shall they not have
the reward of the idle and unprofitable Servant, to be bound hand and foot,
etc? Howsoever they are to be reputed as Ministers, and their actions be not
nullities, but may be sanctified to the people of God; yet not being sent of
God, that is, gifted, and apt to teach, they are no true Ministers of God;
neither can they be said to be good men, unless they be good in their special
calling: They are indeed in the room of Watchmen, but are blind, and cannot
discern the enemy, therefore suffer the people to be surprised; Husbandmen, but
have no skill to plow up a fallow ground-heart, to sow, weed, etc. Builders,
but cannot tell which way to hew a stick or stone for the Lords building;
Laborers, but take no pains; Soldiers, but rather betray their people to the
Enemy, then fight for them: Some of them be good fellows, and set on the great
pot, and keep a good house (which yet all do not) and so think all well; but
what though they fill men's bellies, if in the mean time they starve their
souls? nay, though they live quietly, keep hospitality, make peace among their
Neighbors, yet they do not their duty if they Preach not: O that they would
give themselves to be feeders, or else take to themselves any other calling,
rather then for a little advantage, lose their own and peoples souls! what a
foolish bargain make they for a little piece of the world, See Matthew. 16. 26.
a mite in comparison, to damn both their own and the souls of others?

Object. But they read the word, Obj.
and is not that sufficient?

Ans. Reading both private and Ministerial, Sol.
is of great use, but there is no small difference between the same and
Preaching; when the Word is only read, people neither understand it, nor have
they power or will to apply it to themselves. Acts 8. 31.


Reading is as a rich and costly garment folded up, Differences between Reading
and Preaching.
Preaching when its open and held out by the four Corners: In reading we see it
full of Majesty, but when its unfolded by Preaching, we wonder at so much
matter in so few words: Of this argument read Attersol on Phil. page 208.
Reading is as the whole loaf, Preaching as the cutting of it in pieces, where
every man has his portion divided; The Preachers Plea, p. 114. to 180.
Greenham on Heb. 13. 17.
Its as the cracking of the nut, and finding out the kernel: This difference
will appear plainly by comparing the knowledge and practice of those which live
under those which are only Readers, with theirs which live under faithful and
diligent Preachers.

3. For people, Downham of the duty and dignity of Ministers.
1. If they have not this feeding at their Ministers hands, they must count
themselves grievously wronged, and complain to God, as being ready to starve,
and pray earnestly, and complain to them that be in place to right such things,
Gibson on 1 Cor. 9.
yea, and that much more then if they were wronged in respect of their Temporal
Estate: But woeful world! Use 3.
most people care not for this, are well enough content, complain not hereof;
The 1. branch.
If their Ministers do but use them well in their Tithes, they can swallow down
any thing else, nay, in numbers of places the people like such best; we may
know by the Market folks, how the Market goes: Ask of those you meet with as
you travel, what Ministers they have; what is their usual Answer? If he be a
Reader, We have an honest peaceable man; true, he does not Preach, but he does
what he can, and we can desire no more of him, etc. but if he be a Preacher,
then, We have a troublesome man; some say he is learned, but howsoever he has
troubled us all, we were as quiet as could be till he came, but now there is
such finding of faults, and such new orders, as we are even weary of both; and
thus they had rather have one that will let them go on snorting in their sins,
not reproving them, then a faithful Minister that seeks to pull them out of the
fire; pitiful Creatures! If the King should make weekly allowance to a Town,
and the under Officers should defraud them of it, would they not complain? God
has appointed the preaching of his Word for the food of souls; This is not
distributed by diverse, who would seem entrusted herewith, and yet who opens
his mouth in this case? God would have us to be Seers, but the world would have
us either to be stark blind, that we should see nothing amiss to reprove in
them, or purblinde at least, to see nothing but foul sins that stare men in the
face; Isaiah 58. 1.
for their pride, covetousness, or neglect of duties, they must not meddle
therewith: God would have us cry aloud, and set the Trumpet to our mouth, and
rebuke the world of sin, but the world would have us either dumb dogs that
should not bark at all, either in hope of a crust, or fear of a blow, or else
at least to bark at none, but strange and monstrous sins. The 2. branch.
2. If they be fed, they must look to profit thereby; If their Ministers
prepare for them good and wholesome food, they also must prepare themselves, and
bring a good stomach, and take it in well, by diligent hearing, digesting it by
meditation and conference, that they may grow thereby: O woeful people in many
places, that have excellent Preachers, and as good feeding as may be, and yet
have lean ill-favored and misshapen souls (being inwardly as Pharaoh's seven
kine appeared outwardly) as if they had never had a good meals meat; whence is
this? some will not come to Church, where the food is; some come, but presently
fall asleep; some have their stomachs so cloyed, that they have no appetite;
others put it out like wanton children: These are authors of their own woe,
their blood shall be on their own heads, what answer will they make to God,
when they shall be called to an account for this? what a grief is this to Gods
Ministers? when they have made their provision, they are gladest if their
guests come, and have good stomachs, that nothing be lost. 3. While their
Minister is feeding them carefully, The 3. branch.
they must be careful to feed him with necessary and convenient maintenance,
that he may not be troubled or distracted: Simile.
If a sitting Hen should go much from her nest to seek for food for her self,
the eggs could not but chill: If Ministers should not be maintained, how could
they go on in this great work? contrarily, how many purloin from their
Ministers? how many endeavor to get their Tithes at an under-rate, etc? Does
their Minister feed them carefully, and should not they allow him to the
utmost? should not they be as careful of him, as he is or ought to be of them?
how else shall he maintain himself and his family? how else keep hospitality,
and be helpful to the poor? how else succor poor Christians, Scholars, and
Strangers that resort to him for succor? A good Minister had need be a
Treasurer helping to so many good uses.

2. That Ministers must preach the Word soundly, Ministers must preach the Word
soundly.
they must not give stones instead of bread, for an egg, a Scorpion, for a
fish, a Serpent, for food, Poison: Not only they must not teach erroneous
Doctrine, but also not brackish and unsavory points, that jar with Scripture,
though not in the highest degree: They must not Preach men's inventions and
Traditions (what is the chaff to the wheat?) not idle things, frothy stuff,
etc. to the discouraging of the good, and heartening of the wicked: See John 10*
This were not to feed the flock, neither are we to follow or embrace any such
Doctrine.

3. That Ministers must Preach diligently, Ministers must preach diligently.
in season and out of season, watching every opportunity to do their people
good, and that in regard of their manifold wants and great weaknesses. 2 Timothy
4. 1^*


1. This rebukes them, Use 1.
that having flocks, feed them but seldom, happily once a year, quarterly or
monthly Sermons, they think more then enough.

2. It rebukes the woeful backwardness of many people, Use 2.
that howsoever wisdom cries and lifts up her voice in the streets, Luke 14.
18.
yet for their Oxen and Farms will not intend this Market, count her wares but
as dead commodities; How many worthy Ministers have been forced to give over
their preaching for want of company, as others to preach to a few? O what lets
have without us, besides our own untowardness to call home the uncalled at one
time or other, to build up by little and little the good: Alas, even they that
have been somewhat forward, are subject to decay, and to become worse again. A
Ministers work is not like a Carpenters or Masons, Simile.
as they leave it, they find it, but he may leave some in a good mind, who
yet within a while after are cooled or turned away.

The flock of God] These words are a reason, The second Reason Christians are
Gods flock.
whereby he enforces his Exhortation. The people are the Lords, not ours; all
are his by creation, but he has a company in the world, who are his by another
right, Acts 20. 28.
namely, of Redemption, as being bought by the precious blood of Christ: O
unspeakable price! They must therefore be dear to him, for such things as costs
us much, we much set by: If God gave his Sons blood for them, his Spirit to
them, and prepares Heaven for them, then they be dear to him; therefore he
will call to a strict account for Souls, not one shall perish, but he will have
account how, and by whose default. The King will have account of every of his
Subjects (even the meanest) how he comes to his end, so will the Lord of Souls.

1. This teaches all men to take heed of Souls, Use 1.
they meddle with Jewels, with costly Ware, when they meddle with them: Woeful
is the state of all unconscionable Patrons, that to incroach a great part of
the Livings in their gift, put in of Jeroboam Priests, when the Souls of
Congregations were at their mercy to save or destroy them; woeful also is the
state of such, whom they thus put in.

2. Let Ministers do their duties, Use 2.
as they that must be called to an account, John 21. 16.
for their flock be the Lords, his Sheep, his Lambs, but ^ost use them not as
if they were the Lords. See Ezekiel. 34. 10.


3. This teaches people to submit themselves to the guidance, Use 3.
direction, teaching and government of their Shepherds, whom God has set over
them: They must be content to be kept within the fold, to be kept from rank
places that would rot them, to be kept in bare pasture, John 10. 27.
to be often dressed, etc. As sheep follow their Shepherds voice, Heb. 13. 17.
so must Gods people the whistle of Gods Word by his Ministers.

3. This rebukes numbers which will not be kept in, Use 4.
but stray where they list: These straglers will fall into the Devils mouth,
they will run into the rank rotten places of unlawful profits and pleasures; do
what Ministers can, they will not be dressed, etc. Thus thousands dye of the
rot, and of other deadly diseases, notwithstanding all the care of the most
diligent Shepherds; these be none of Christ's sheep, his follow the mouth of his
under-Shepherds, and lose nothing by it, as who shall have eternal life; but
these be Goats, and its easy to know their place, where it will be, even on
the left hand, to hear their doleful doom.

Again, By Flock, the whole company that is under a Ministers charge being to
be understood, thus much may be noted, that

A Minister must have regard to all his people, Ministers are to regard all
their people*
even to the meanest, from the one end of the Church to the other: No Shepherd
will willingly lose the least sheep of his fold; and good Husbands and
Housewives do not only look to their Silver Vessels, but to those of Brass,
Pewter, Stone, Wood; so must we take care of all, look to all.

1. This rebukes those Ministers which preach so loftily, Use 1.
and in diverse tongues, and after such a fashion, as is quite beyond the reach
of most, and only apply themselves to a few of the chief, rather in
ostentation seeking themselves, then Gods glory, or the peoples souls: It were
unreasonable for a Minister to preach, if his voice could not be heard of the
one half, so is it to be heard, if not understood; five words are better being
understood, 1 Cor. 14. 19.
then many in an unknown tongue. A Ministers glory is to stoop to the capacity
of the meanest; what is the end of preaching, but that people may understand and
be affected? have not the poor souls as well as the chief? yea, it may be they
are most dear to God, for the poor receive the Gospel.

2. This teaches all to give ear and yield obedience to the Word; Use 2.
This must the poor do, this also the rich: But O the woeful carelessness of the
one, contempt of the other! for the poor, they sit at the lower end, and regard
nothing, come but seldom, and think their poverty excuses them, which should
indeed provoke them more unto obedience; They live as if they had no souls, all
for the belly and back, but regard no good thing universally; for the rich,
they think their greatness may excuse them, and that this subjection does not
become their place and rank, whereas the more riches, the more greatness, etc.
they should be the more obedient.

Which is among you,] Or depends upon you. Here note,

1. That its Gods mind, Every Congregation is to have a several Pastor.
that every particular Congregation should have a several Pastor over them, and
so did the Apostles take order in their times.

2. That a Minster must attend to that charge over which the Holy Ghost has
made him overseer; Every Pastor is to look to his own charge
He is not bound to other flocks, but to his own; not but that one Minister may
help another in case of special need, not neglecting his own, but his main care
must be for his own.

1. This rebukes those that lying in Universities, Use 1.
Cities, or great men's Houses, regard not the people that depend on them; Their
people depend on them for instruction, comfort, direction, etc. and their lips
should preserve knowledge, now if they be dry Nurses, Wells without water, they
do but deceive their people, their people trust to a broken reed.

2. People must respect those Ministers which are set over them; Use 2.
If their gifts be competent, and they teach them the truth, they must not
dishonor them, but pray for them, hearten them, frequent their Sermons, etc. As
Ministers must attend their own people, so people must attend their own
Ministers; even a Minister that is sincere and careful, though of meaner gifts,
may yet be fitter to do good in his own place then a stranger, because he knows
their state and condition best, and we may also look for Gods blessing on the
labors of such: As poor folks Children with their plain and slender diet,
Simile.
are yet as lusty, well liking, strong and comely, as they that are rich,
having all abundance and variety: Men must not say, I can edify better by
another, or I cannot edify by him, they must labor to edify, and God will
give a blessing; If at other times other helps are offered, people are to
embrace them, and be thankful for them, but without contempt of their own
Minister.

Taking the oversight thereof,] Ministers must oversee and look into their
flocks.
Another duty of the Ministers of God: Its not enough to preach, yea soundly
and diligently, but they must besides take a particular view and oversight of
their flock, marking and looking into (by themselves and others) the
conversation and behavior of their people, See Prove. 27. 23.
and applying themselves to them accordingly in admonition, John 10. 3.
exhortation, Acts 20. 28.
comfort: As Watchmen, they must continually look to prevent, Simile.
descry, and disapoint the Enemy: As Nurses, they must not only feed their
Children, but have also a careful eye over them; should they leave them, they
might peradventure go together by the ears, scratch one another, fall into the
fire, wander out, fall into the water, etc. No, they must have continual work
with them; as to take them up, being fallen; wash them, being soul; chide and
part them, when they wrangle and fight: As Shepherds, they must not only drive
or lead out their Sheep to Pasture, but view and mark them at going out and
coming into the Fold, having also all day long their eyes on them, fetching
home those that wander, binding up those that are hurt, etc. If a Minister know
any of his people riotous or profane, he must rebuke them; If any out of the
way, admonish them; he must hearten them that be in a good course to go on
still, and must comfort them that languish under their sins, temptations and
fears; in a word, deal with every one as the cause requires: As they say of a
Beggar, he is never out of his way; so its true of a Minister in his own
Parish, he is never out of his way, but wheresoever he goes, there is some
work, and whomsoever he meets with, he has something to say to him: If he be
a riotous son, a disobedient servant, an idle person, one that comes not to
Church, or that behaves himself rudely therein, there is occasion offered to
rebuke and admonish: But if it be some zealous Christian, or some beginning to
wax faint, or some in affliction, there is occasion offered to exhort and
comfort: The like may be said when he goes to see or sit with any of his
people, whether poor or rich, and amongst those he may find some staggering in
judgment, ready to be seduced by Brownists, Papists, Anabaptists, etc. whom he
must have an eye to: Thus he may help his public Ministry: Thus prevent and
remedy many things amiss; Thus their peoples consciences cannot but be
convinced, whereas what is spoken in the public Ministry, many take not to
themselves: Thus Ministers shall know the better how to Preach aptly, according
to their peoples necessities, who else shall but preach generally and
uncertainly: his Ministry is also the more like to prevail, when he comes home
close to the peoples hearts, and touches their very faults; thus also shall he
know the better whom to admit to the Sacrament: All the discommodity is, that
having rebuked or admonished men of any faults in private, and coming to
reprove such things in public, they think he points at them, and galls them,
and so they stomach him, and cannot away with him; but its only thus with some
few proud persons, or rich men, who therefore must have the less said to them
in private, and that they shall get by their frowardness.

1. This rebukes those Ministers that be absent from their people usually or
continually: Use 1.
How can these take care of them, that come not at them above once in a
Quarter, except they could indent with the Devil, never to trouble their
people, or tempt them in their absence, or tell them when he would be busy
with them, etc. If they say they care for them by another, so they shall go to
Heaven by another, but be in danger to go to Hell in their own persons.
Besides, either he is fit to care for them (and then why has he not the wages
that does the work?) or he is not fit, and then how will they answer that to
God?

2. It rebukes those also that living among their people, Use 2.
yet care not thus, but think themselves discharged that they meet them at
Church on the Sabbath, and then preach them a Sermon, whereas all the week
after they consider not of them, nay, scarce visit the sick, but either are so
entangled with cares and businesses of the world, See 2 Timothy 2. 4.
that they cannot, or so addicted to their pleasures, that they will not mind
this; Thus they are less fit for Preaching, do the less good, and receive all
at a venture to the Sacrament, which is a fearful thing.

3. As people must be careful for their Ministers (who had need of no worldly
care hanging on them) that they may attend on their care of them; Use 3.
so they must be willing that their Ministers have a care of them, and deal
privately with them and theirs.

This many cannot away with, but would that the Minister should content himself
with seeing them at Church, but not to look into their behavior in their
Families, or to pry into their lives, or deal privately or particularly; who
yet if they have a shepherd, look that he should diligently tend their sheep
all day, and look to them particularly, as well as feed them; they should be
glad when the Minister will come to their Houses, and sit with them, conferring
with them and theirs of heavenly things, etc. But if they should know when he
would come, they would be sure to be out of the way; this is a sign of an ill
conscience, that they cannot abide the trial, and (which is worse) of a bad
heart that is not willing to mend.

But there is another extremity, when people will expect too much at the
Ministers hands, as to visit them at their houses more often then the largeness
of the place, and his strength and time will permit, which though it be a good
fault and a rare, and therefore to be much born with (for there is nothing more
comely in the world, then to see Ministers delight in their peoples company,
and people in theirs, and thereupon to be much together) yet it must be done as
it may stand with the public; There must be convenient time to Preach, that
we may not come unpreparedly; and if a Minister Preach also on the week days,
he cannot have much time for private, especially in a great and wide Parish.

Not by constraint but willingly,] Ministers are not by constraint, but
willingly to perform their duties toward their people.
Now for the manner; A Minister is not to perform the forementioned duties by
constraint (as for fear of Gods wrath, men's Laws or shame, etc.) but willingly:
To do by constraint is base and servile, what any does thus, they do but
homely, no better then needs must; and besides, what hope of Gods blessing can
they expect upon such work? 1 Cor. 9. 17.
God loves a willing heart, and a cheerful doer: 2 Cor. 5. 14.
There Is a constraint that is good, whereof the Apostle writes to the
Corinthians, The love of Christ has constrained me, etc. namely, because
Christ has pardoned my sins, dyed for me, has called me to this high and holy
calling, to be his Ambassador to his people, has entrusted me with the souls
of his People, etc. I will therefore in all and every these respects* do my
duty in the most faithful and careful manner that I can, neither can I do
otherwise; other constraint is base: A man cannot endure his Servant should
thus do his work, much less the Lord, who has no need of any man; and if one
do it not, he can set up another at his pleasure.

1. This rebukes those that never Preach, Use 1.
but so often as they are bound by Law, once a month, or once a quarter, as
also those who for avoiding the shame of dumb idols, step up and do a little,
but like hirelings, who have no love to their work, are at it in body, their
minds being far therefrom.

2. It may persuade all Ministers to readiness and willingness in our duty
private and public, Use 2.
when we find any loathness to our study, and drousiness therein; lets think
what an honorable Calling ours is, and that whereas others are employed on
earthly things: ours is in the Scriptures, searching in the rich Treasures of
the Word, and dealing altogether in Spiritual and Holy things; and again, what
a trust is laid up with us, and what weight lies upon us, and what a reward
remains for us; we serve a good Master, in an excellent work, in the
assurance of most rich wages.

3. People must learn also to do their duty, Use 3.
not by constraint but willingly; Thus must they reverence their Ministers,
hear them, obey their Ministry, allow them maintenance; but how grudgingly do
most pay their Tithes, which is for want of finding good by the Word; They
should so take part of the Ministers Spiritual things, as they may put
themselves into his debt, and see cause to allow him means: O suffer not any of
the tenth part to cleave to your fingers, neither seek to enrich your selves
hereby, but by the remaining nine parts: whosoever think to enrich themselves by
working on the Lords day, or keeping back their Tithes, deceive themselves,
they shall not prosper: Be the Minister good or bad, give him willingly all the
Law gives him; If he do not his duty, he shall answer for it: Be not you
Trespassers also, stoppage is no payment; but if he be a sufficient and painful
Minister, your custom will not privilege you from paying him his due by Gods
appointment, you must give him his due to the utmost, and he is worthy of it:
But O the woeful covetousness and corruption of men in this behalf! They think
any thing enough for a Minister, though it be but from hand to mouth, whereas
they look to increase themselves, and think their Trade bad, and themselves ill
Husbands, if they leave not store to their Posterity.

Not of filthy lucre, Ministers must not perform their duties for filthy lucre,
but of a ready mind.
but of a ready mind,] Its not enough to do our duty willingly, for so we may
do for filthy lucre and gain, but it must be of a ready mind, even the love of
God, and zeal of his glory, and the care of the peoples Salvation, and winning
them to God; It were a base thing that lucre should set us on work, or any
thing else, but those high and holy ends.

Obj. None would preach but for their maintenance, Obj.
they look for it.

Sol. Suppose it to be so, Sol.
yet many preach, and have not half the maintenance they spend where they live,
but either spend of that little God gave them by their friends, 2 Cor. 11. 8.
or else rob other Churches (as the Apostle speaks) to preach to them: but
its one thing to be set on work for gain, and another to expect an honest and
necessary mainteinance, which is a necessary help to the doing of the duty, and
without which it cannot be well done; It comes in, I say, by the by, as a
necessary help to the duty, 1 Cor. 9. 10.
not as the end that sets on work thereto: And its Gods Ordinance, that they
that preach the Gospel should be maintained thereby; yea, if a man had
maintenance of his own, he were not bound in these days, See Isaiah 56* 10, 11.
and among an able people to preach of his own cost, Ier. 6. 13.
but might expect the recompense of his labors, and ye^ do not this duty for
filthy lucre. Mic. 3. 5.


1. This rebukes those that heap living upon living, Use 1.
that they may live wealthily and at ease, doing little of the work, and taking
small care of their calling.

2. Those which do no good in their places (who yet are very cunning to gather
in their commodities, Use 2.
and to make as much of their peoples as they can) but follow Farming and
Lawing, as if they were mere Farmers, Grasiers, or Atturneys; they eat the fat,
and cloth themselves with the fleece, but do not at all regard their peoples
good.

3. Such vagabond and vagrant rogues that go up and down with a set Sermon or
two which they have got by heart, Use 3.
and coming into by places, offer themselves to Preach, falling in the end of
their Sermons to make known their necessities, by reason of great losses, as by
fire, or the like, all being notorious lies; These be notorious rogues, fitter
for the Whipping-post then any place else: O but you disgrace that calling! No,
I speak against these scabs and scurfs that disgrace it, for some of those were
never in the Ministry, but boldly have taken this course without calling or
warrant; some it may be have been in the Ministry, but for their base and
detestable behavior, have been cast out, and now take this course; Those are
notorious drunkards, Gamesters, Whoremasters, as has been proved.

4. Such as desire to preach at many Funerals, Use 4.
and there for a little see set their tongues and consciences to sale, in
saying they care not what, sometimes without, sometimes against their knowledge.

5. Such as having a great man in their Parish, Use 5.
dare not displease him by preaching the truth, but double and faulter, serving
their turn for advantage.

O that we would set Gods glory and our peoples good before our eyes, as the
mark whereat we are to aim; covetousness is a base sin in any, but chiefly in a
Minister: How shall he teach others to depend on God, or teach the Doctrine of
Gods providence, that is himself perplexed with worldly cares? how can he
preach against covetousness in others, who is himself covetous?

6. For People, Use 6.
they must not reverence and make much of their Ministers, for filthy lucre,
and because they let them good penyworths, but for their Office, Gifts and
Care. Note we further, that

As we are to do good duties after a right manner, Duties are to be done with a
willing heart.
as in hearing with an honest heart, praying, with lifting up pure hands,
without wrath or doubting, Isa. 1. 11, etc. and 58. 3.
receiving the Sacrament after due preparation, etc. (else how glorious soever
the outside be, they are abomination in Gods sight, and increase our
condemnation; So we must particularly do the same with a willing heart; so were
the offerings of the people toward the building of the Tabernacle and Temple:
All our duties to God, his Ministers, the poor, all works of mercy, etc. must
be thus done.

Again, No man is to follow any calling merely for gain.
that no man ought to do the duties of his calling, or go to his work merely
for gain, so that if it were not for it, he would not follow his calling: These
be servants and drudges to Mammon, so do Heathens and Turks, but Christians
ought to go to their work, because God has so appointed, Eccles. 1. 13.
and for the good of the Church and Commonwealth, his gain must come in on the
by, as it shall please God to send it; but we ought to follow our calling, as
the means God has appointed to keep us from idleness, and to humble us
thereby, and we might be instruments of the common good.

No doubt most men offend God greatly this way, Use.
yea, good Christians go not to their work in Faith, as they ought, nor so
single-heartedly as they should, but are carried along by profit; therefore
some when they cannot increase as they have and would, then give over their
callings, and live idelly of the sweat of other men's brows, by Usury, etc. most
never regard the common good, but their own private advantage. Most of the gain
of the world is filthy gain.


Filthy lucre,] Not that all gain (for so lucre signifies) is evil or filthy,
yet so he calls gain, to show us, that most of the gain of the world is filthy
gain; though to the most of the world, all is fish that comes to net, and
gotten by hook or crook, right or wrong is cleanly enough, though never so
filthy: Indeed, hungry dogs will eat dirty things, and draff is good enough for
swine; we must learn to keep our selves clear of filthy lucre.

What is filthy lucre? What Is to be accounted filthy lucre.
whatsoever is got basely by the neglecting any good duty toward God, our
souls, our families, our brethren, is filthy gain; So whatsoever is gotten by
any unlawful means, gain gotten by the breach of any of Gods commandments, as
by society, and conversing familiarly with Idolaters against the second
Commandment; so all gain gotten by oaths, charms, etc. all gain gotten by
travel or working, or bargaining on the Lords day; all gain gotten by
defrauding the Prince of his Taxes and Customs, or Ministers of their Tithes
and Dues; all gain accrewing by oppression, withholding Corn from the poor,
upon forfeitures, etc. all gain gotten by Whoredom on the woman's part, or on
the man's by winking thereat, so all of gain gotten by any kind of fraud or
deceit, as by bribery, gaming, and the like: So by selling things not useful,
as Cards and Dice, or things not sellable, as Church livings, or things naught
or mixed, or at unreasonable rates, or by false weights and measures; so in
buying, taking hold of the necessity of a poor man; so in borrowing, not
paying, whereof those subtle and wicked bankrupts are guilty, which break to
enrich themselves; so lending upon usury, to the poor especially, letting rackt
Rents; so in doing work, but not truly, or not at all, and yet taking the
wages, whereof many Ministers are guilty; so in not paying wages, whereof not a
few rich are guilty; so in Partnership, all unjust and unright gain by secret
fraud or open violence; so all gain, by lying, and dissembling, and falsehood,
the common course of gaining in the world; so of Lawyers, pleading and setting
a face upon bad and foul unjust matters for their fees, etc.

Do we examine our gain which we have had: Use.
If it be filthy lucre, confess, Col. 3. 6.
repent, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 6.
and cry to God for mercy, and restore, else look for Gods vengeance, 1 Cor. 6.
9.
God will pursue it in themselves, and curse it that it will not abide to their
posterity; and besides, they shall have no part with God: Matthew. 16. 26.
And then what shall it have profited them to have won the world, with the loss
of their souls? yea, the time will come, either in the torment of their
conscience in this world, or else at the day of fearful account, when they will
be as glad to be rid of it again, as ever Judas was of his thirty pieces; he
thought if he could get money, he were made, but when he had it, he was never
so ill in his life as then: So was it with Achan, Gehazi, Ananias and Sapphira,
etc. And for the time to come, let us beware lest any filthy lucre cleave to our
fingers. Note further, That

Lightly the Scripture speaks not of riches, Usually the Scriptures mention not
riches but with some check.
but with some checks; If but two words, one of them is to take off our minds
therefrom, as uncertain riches, deceiveable riches, unrighteous Mammon; Its
hard for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, and here filthy lucre:
The Reasons.
This is, that we should not set our hearts too much on them (whereunto we are
very prone) but taking heed of covetousness, neither too greedily desire them,
nor be insatiable in our desires, nor too sparing from our selves and families,
nor niggardly to good and holy duties, nor having them, to set too much by
them, or put our confidence in them, or be too much cast down in the loss of
them, etc.

To this end, Means to help against covetousness, or the too much love of
riches.
1. Consider, That covetousness is idolatry, and so a most hanious sin,
withdraws our heart from God, is the root of all evil, will make a man break
any Covenant; the bane of godliness,

Why then are many Christians covetous?

Ans. Sol.
Its not their goodness; If they had more faith, they would be less careful of
the world, but if these be so, being assured of Heaven, Heb. 13. 5.
and cast our selves upon God, believing his promise; He will not fail us,
neither forsake us.

Obj. Obj.
But the world is hard, we must therefore follow it earnestly, which if we
should not do, we should leave but little for our posterity.

Answ. Sol.
If we have faith to depend upon God, he will give us by our lawful and
moderate seeking, that blessing that shall be best and sufficient both for us
and ours, and shall continue longer with our Posterity, then more gotten
greedily.

Verse 3. Neither as being Lords over Gods heritage, but being ensamples to the
flock.
NOw follows the third duty of the Minister, namely, to give good example of
an holy life to his people; where pride is forbidden, they must not rigorously,
cruelly, or over imperiously rule them: speak we first of that which is
prohibited, then of that which is enjoined.

That which is forbid Ministers, is pride and lordly carriage of themselves;
whereunto a reason is annexed, even because the people be Gods heritage and
portion.

Neither as being Lords,] Ministers must not exercise any temporal power over
their people.
Here note,

1. That Ministers must not exercise civil authority and temporal power over
their people, but use a spiritual rule over them, by teaching them, and
denouncing the judgments of God against them that do evil, John 18. 36.
and ruling them by the Word of God, and by spiritual censures to correct the
stubborn and disobedient: Luke 12. 14.
Our Savior Christ's (our Masters) kingdom was not of this world, and so not
ours: He would not be a Judge or Divider between two at variance about their
inheritance; Magistrates must rule by the Sword, and we by the Word; they by
the Temporal Sword, we by the Spiritual; we must teach the people, exhort,
persuade, and commend men to God, and pray for them; and if any be obstinate,
to admonish them more seriously; and if they reform not, to debar them from the
Sacraments; yea, if they have committed any notorious sin, and live without
repentance, to cast them out of the Church, 1 Cor. 5. 5.
and deliver them up to Satan: These be more weighty and fearful censures, 2
Cor. 10. 4.
being rightly performed, Matthew. 20. 25.
then any bodily punishment; John 2. 15.
we must leave other things to the Magistrate, whose power is of God to rule
with the material Sword: Thus did our Savior Christ, only once, as he was the
King of his Church, and not as a Minister of the Gospel, he whipped out the
buyers and sellers out of the temple: So the Apostles exercised no other but
Spiritual authority, except Peter by special and extraordinary direction, on
Ananias and Sapphira, and Paul on Elimas the Sorcerer; In those times God
showed extraordinary works and miracles for the confirmation of the Gospel,
which we need not now: And this was not usual, for then they could not have
served Demetrius, Tertullus, with all their Enemies thus.

A Reason hereof may be this, The Reasons.
one calling is sufficient for one man; As the Magistrate must not encroach
upon the Ministers office (as Uzza did) either a private man to expound the
Scripture and administer the Sacraments; 2 Timothy 2. 4.
so must not Ministers on theirs: The action of Phineas was extraordinary,
Numb. 25.
and so no fit president.

1. This rebukes the notorious usurpation of the Pope of Rome, Use 1.
who not only challenges to be the Head of the whole Church, and to have
Supremacy over the same, but also Temporal Jurisdiction over Princes and
Potentates, to set up and cast down whom he pleases, to set them together by
the ears, to impose Taxes on them, to exempt their Subjects from their
Allegiance, etc. But upon what ground does he challenge this Supremacy? from
Peter, whose Successor he alleges himself to be: But he is quite fallen from
the Faith and Doctrine of Peter, and if he did succeed him aright, yet could he
have no such authority, for Peter himself had no such thing, neither do any
places of Scripture (used to this purpose) prove any such thing, much less had
Peter and Civil Jurisdiction over Princes and People, which the Pope also
challenges from him: But of this heretofore, only let us know that our
Christian King, and all other Kings in their several Dominions are Supreme
Governors, and that the Pope has no authority to meddle with them; all that
hold otherwise (as all right Papists do) are Traitors in heart at least, and
can be no good Subjects; let us pray that all other Kings may shake off his
yoke, both in Spiritual and Temporal things, and stoop to Christ's yoke: And let
us know that God has given no Civil authority to Ministers to rule the people
by, what Princes in their savor may bestow upon them, and what they may
lawfully receive from them, and enjoy and exercise: I mean not now to discuss,
neither indeed can it be well decided; this we are sure, that there is no more
weighty part of any Ministers duty, nor none like unto it, then to Preach the
Word of God, about which the Pope with his Popelings have no mind to take
pains; Those that have been godly Bishops have exercised themselves diligently
in the same.

2. It condemns the lawless freedom of the whole Popish rabble from the Civil
Magistrate, Use 2.
which is wicked; for though our Ministry be above Magistrates, and all, even
Princes are to be subject thereunto, and our duty is to discharge our duty in
rebuking sin in all, yet as we be Citizens, so we are under the Magistrate, and
he has power to punish faults in Ministers, as well as of any other.

2. That Ministers must not carry themselves proudly, Ministers must not carry
themselves proudly and disdainfully.
highly, and disdainfully, accounting of others as a company of Clowns and
simple fellows, but account them the people of God, and such as they must care
for, serve and attend in all painfulness, for the Salvation of their souls,
carrying themselves so lovingly and amiably, as that the meanest may be bold in
good sort to speak unto them. Nor

3. Must a Minister rule them rigorously and with violence, Ministers must not
use rigor toward their people.
and subdue them with suits or strong hand, God cannot away with such
Shepherds: Neither will any rule more Tyrannously over people, then those that
take least pains to seed them, Ezekiel. 34. 18.
but they must win men by the Word: If any be obstinate, they must deal more
roundly with them, yet still after a Spiritual manner, and no carnal kind of
violence, which is not so fit for a Minister, nor so like to do good; if they
be unbridled and unruly, let the Magistrate deal with them: A Minister must be
kind to those that have any good; they that be not as he would have them, yet
must not be cast off, but wait with patience, showing all good desire of
winning them; for though a Minister is over the people, yet not so as that he
may do with them what he list, but as God requires: Ephesians. 6. 1.
So is the Father over the Children, Col. 3. 19.
yet must not he provoke them to anger; and Husbands are over their Wives, yet
must not they be bitter to them: Simile.
The Minister is over the people, as a Shepherd over his sheep, he must feed
them, catch them with his hook, see what they ayl, dress them, bind their legs
being unruly, if they range out, fetch them in, if they come not at his
whistle, set his dog at them to scare them, but he must not pend them up all
the day and starve them, break their legs or their backs, worry them with his
dog, Simile.
sell or change them away, etc. The Minister is over the people, as the Nurse
over the Child committed to her, namely, to feed it, tend it, and take pains
about it, but not to hurt, maim, starve it.

1. This rebukes the contrary in some Ministers, Use 1.
who because they are over the people, therefore (like some young Husbands, that
having married before they were wise, misuse their wives because they be their
heads) carry themselves haughtily, what are they but a company of Clowns,
Swains, a company of simple fellows? what are they? They are those you are
appointed to tend, and such as you must give an account of to God, such as may
belong to God as well as you, happily rather then you; Members of Christ, as
dearly bought as you, and Heirs of Heaven, such as must put a Crown upon your
head at the last day, such as maintain you of their labors, that you may attend
their souls; you must win them by the Word, by public and private
persuasions, by a good life, and not by a strong hand, by suing them at Law,
and contending with them.

2. If Ministers must not Lord it over the people, Use 2.
then much less people over them; a Minister has some color, they none: To
set light by him, to check or control him, to insult over him, use him at
their pleasure, because they have purses, etc. is wicked; what is he, will they
say? he is but a Minister, a Parson, a Priest, etc. what is he but a Minister?
Is that a disgrace to him? Is that a base Calling? Is there any more high and
honorable? what is he? He is the man you must depend on for the means of your
Salvation, by whose Ministry you must be pulled our of the jaws of the Devil,
and power of sin, and converted to God; Its he that has power to bind or
loose you, and as he does, so shall it be done in Heaven; he has power to open
the door or shut it against you, as he sees your behavior: To the good that be
converted, he is their Spiritual Father, to whom they owe more then to their
Natural Father, of the one they had a being, of the other a well-being; of the
one born into the world, a man, and a child of wrath; of the other born again
into the Church, a child of grace; To these also a Nurse to cherish them,
confirm, strengthen, and comfort them, and an helper of their faith to the
Kingdom of Heaven: But for the wicked, he has power to shut them out as dogs,
from partaking the Childrens bread, yea, to deliver them up to Satan, if they
deserve it; Luke 10. 16.
therefore say not, who is he? or what is he? For he that despises them, Psalm.
105. 14,
despises Christ himself: Touch not my Prophets, and do mine anointed no harm:
He has rebuked Kings, and the greatest for their sakes; nay, even the least
(as those Children that mocked the Prophet) have not escaped free, yea, to
misuse them in body, goods, or name, and offer them indignity, is the ready
means to provoke the Lord to wrath and indignation.

Over Gods heritage,] The third reason Christians are Gods Heritage.
A reason against Lordly and Tyrannous dealing, People be Gods Heritage: The
word signifies elsewhere a lot, because Heritage used to be divided by lot: The
word is of the plural number, whereby is meant particular Congregations, over
which God appoints particular Ministers, as being parts of the Heritage of
God, which is the whole Church of God in Heaven and Earth, and every particular
Congregation is a part of it, and as a Farm or Manor committed to a Spiritual
Husbandman, to yield the Lord the fruit thereof.

The word here used, the Papists apply only to Ministers, but improperly; for
the people also be the Lords lot, portion, and the rod of his inheritance,
though indeed Levi was Gods part in a special manner, set aside for Gods service
in his Temple, yet then and now all Gods Church are his Heritage.

The people is the Lords Heritage; He has bought his Church at a dear rate, he
plants it, waters it, and hedgeth the same in.

1. This rebukes those Ministers, Use 1.
that use them at their pleasure, kill them, sell them, misuse them, etc. but
they shall be countable to God for them, as Jacob to Laban for those sheep that
were lost or torn: We must use them as Gods Sheep, husbanding Gods Heritage
carefully, that it may yield fruit in abundance to the owner the Lord; we must
not use them as we list, but as we will answer for every sheep: They be dear to
God, and he will have account of every sheep in our fold; we should be thankful
to God, that has trusted us with such a jewel, as a part of his Heritage, and
therefore be faithful to him and them.

2. If People be Gods Heritage, Use 2.
and every Congregation as a particular Farm, they must look they yield fruit,
that God may take delight therein, and may say, Its the fruitfullest Farm that
I have within a great way, I have more obedience yielded to my Word, my
Sabbaths better kept, my Sacraments better resorted to, Families better
instructed and governed in that Town, then in many others, more love, Simile.
mercy, zeal, etc. As an Husbandman that has a rich piece of ground, and which
bears a great crop, he will delight to be much in it, looking on it, walking
about it, looking that no damage come to it, etc. but if it prove barren, he
cares not for coming at it; So where theirs a fruitful piece of ground to the
Lord, he will delight in it, boast of it, bless it, fence it, and continue his
favor to it, and to their posterity after them, they paying the rent of the
Gospel, and fruit which is the obedience thereof, and outward mercies as he
sees best, etc. But in Towns where there is no fruit, no obedince yielded, no
Prayer, no regard of Sabbaths or Sacraments; but on the contrary, Profaneness,
Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, Contention, Whoredom, Drunkenness, etc. God will
take no pleasure in such a Farm, but if it has had a good Husbandman, will
take him away, and put it over into the hands of some hireling or base person,
See Heb. 6. 8.
good enough for such a place.

But being ensamples to the flock,] Now of the duty exhorted unto, which is the
third and last; the two former are not enough, to those this must be added;
Though it may be said, Better Preach well and live naughtily, then live jollily
well, and preach not, or altogether without edification, yet indeed, both ought
to go together.

Ministers must not only teach well, Ministers must not only preach well, but
live well.
but also do the same, be paterns unto their people, go before them in
practice; they must not be like Statues in a highway, like Noah's builders
which framed the Ark, but were not saved therein, or like the Scribes and
Pharisees; which laid heavy burdens on others, Luke 11. 46.
which they themselves would not touch.

This was signified under the Law, Lev. 21. 18.
none that were to minister before the Lord, Acts 1. 1.
were to be deformed: Matthew. 5. 16.
Our Savior both taught and did, 1 Timothy 4. 16.
Ministers must be as shining Lights, they must be unrebukeable; as people must
join doing with hearing, so must Ministers doing with Preaching.

Reasons. Reasons.
1. Hereby it shall appear that they mean in good earnest, and require nothing
of others, but that whereunto they themselves are Matthew. 23. 2.
but whether they be good or bad, sitting in Moses Chair, they are to be
followed and obeyed in those things which they teach truly. 3. Hereby they
shall procure themselves a good degree and great Luke 4. 23.
If they do, will it not be replied, Physician, heal thy self? 4. Ministers
have such a Calling,

1. For Ministers. Use 1.
1. They must live among their people, else how can they give them good
example, and so win them? 2. They must look exceeding warily to their lives,
yea, to their Wives and Childrens behavior; we must watch over our own hearts,
bridle and beat down our corruptions, avoid all appearance of evil, all the
least occasion of evil, for a mote in us will be counted a beam, and do more
hurt then a beam in another; yea, we must not only beware in things evil, but
even abridge our selves in lawful things, of something we might do, and that
for the peoples weakness, as of our lawful recreation or refreshing, so that we
wrong not our selves too much herein, and in the matter of the maintenance,
seeking our own, or providing something for Wife and Posterity, which we might
and ought to do, yet we must forbear somewhat for the peoples weakness, who are
ready to think a man covetous, if he has any thing more then from hand to
mouth, or looks to save any thing, as they do for theirs: And yet people must
here again be admonished, that they stand not too much upon their Ministers
life, but look to his Ministry, and labor to profit by it; the Word of God is
holy, and ought to be of power with us, whatsoever the life of the Minister be.
But alas, how many Ministers be as bad as the worst in the Parish, as ready to
run to the Alehouse, to play on the Lord's Day, to be Gusters, Swearers, unclean
Persons, Usurers, what not? O we ought to bewail the state of the Land in this
behalf! Such with Eli's Sons, make the people loath the Sacrifice of God: They
pollute the holy things of God, what answer shall they be able and to make?
even out of their own mouths they shall be condemned, as who having often
preached others, yet have hated to be reformed.

2. For People. Use 2.
1. If Ministers must give good example, then must people imitate and follow
the same, for even to this end also are Ministers enjoined to live well; Matthew.
11. 29.
our Savior says, Learn of me, etc. the Apostle Paul, Ephesians. 5. 1.
Be ye followers of me, etc. But 2. There be some that will either be catching
at somewhat to keep themselves in their old course, or if they can find no
just ground, then will they say, he is an honest man indeed, and there is all,
but for following his example, they mind no such matter; some again will bear
with themselves in pride, vanity, ignorance, why? what, we be no Ministers,
therefore need not be so holy; we are beholding to them, that they think we
should be holy, but so must they too (else woe unto them) especially after so
long teaching: Some will be prying into a good Ministers life, and if they can
see or hear by any that he has any infirmity (which yet happily is not so) they
judge amiss thereof; nay, though it be his burden, and he labors against it,
yet this shall be sufficient for some proud profane men to set light by all
his Ministry (which is approved and powerful to many others) and by all the
rest of his godly conversation: what, do these think to have a Minister perfect
without infirmity? James 5. 17.
none ever was; Elias (as St. James says) was a man subject to the like
infirmities that we are; Acts 15. 39.
Paul and Barnabas also were stired up the one against the other; Samuel, Eli,
and the rest, were not with out their own frailties: Some Ministers are a
little too fine, some a little too worldly, others somewhat too quick and
hasty, etc. But will this discharge people from regarding and profiting by
their Ministry and example: This is not spoken that any Minister should bear
with himself in any weakness, but for them that hereupon think they may cast
off the regard of him and his Ministry, saying, What are they, or what is he?
he is a man, and has infirmities as well as others: But as Noah condemned the
world by making the Ark, so shall their Doctrine you, if ye amend not thereby:
If you be so sharp sighted, that you can spy what infirmity is in your
Minister, then look you follow all the other good things you observe in him,
and shun that, but they will do thus with a Minister, yet will nourish many
gross things in themselves: Oh, if Ministers were like the Angels, perfect, and
could do miracles, and heal their sick, and live (as Moses did, forty days)
continually without meat, then they would like well of them; but seeing they
must have maintenance, and can do nothing but Preach to them, and Pray for
them, and go before them in a good example, and have infirmities, they make no
reckoning of them, but such show themselves carnal and foolish; even such
Ministers must be such as must save us, and no other.

Verse 4. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of
glory that fades not away.
THe last Reason taken from the commodity, The fourth Reason from the reward of
faithful Ministers.
and happy event, and rich reward that will be to all that shall thus
faithfully discharge their duties, wherein the Apostle does, like the Devil
with our Savior Christ, though to a better, yea, contrary, and leaves the
Reason from profit till the last, as likely to be of most force.

And when the chief Shepherd shall appear,] Christ the chief Shepherd
Jesus Christ is meant by the chief Shepherd; John 10. 11.
He is that good Shepherd, the Shepherd of Shepherds, Heb. 13. 20.
the great Shepherd of his people; we be Shepherds also, but inferior to him.

He is worthily so called, 1. Because the sheep be his, not ours, he Acts 20.
28.
and they cost him full dearly; for us, we are but set to tend and feed them.
2. He appoints us under him, and gives Ephesians. 4. 11.
He sets us on work. 3. Its he that gathers and keeps the sheep, and heals
them; we indeed use the means,

1. This condemns that notable usurpation of the Pope of Rome, Use 1.
who arrogateth unto himself, that he is the chief Pastor and Arch-Shepherd
over all the Church: But there is no other chief one but Christ on Earth, who
is present with his Church to the worlds end: A Shepherd; a devouring wolf he
is, that destroys all souls; A Feeder; he poisons the people by the dunghill
dirt of false Doctrine, and his own Traditions, he feeds all for the Devil, but
brings none to Christ to be sure.

2. It teaches us that are Ministers to look to our Calling by the chief
Shepherd, Use 2.
whether besides the outward allowance of men, we have received a competency of
skill and gifts to manage the business we are set about, the gaining of the
peoples souls; as also to crave his direction and blessing upon our labors, and
so to use our people, Heb. 13. 17.
as for whom and every of them we must make an account to their owner, our
Master; we must not starve them, or half starve them, be cruel unto them, buy,
sell, chop or change them away, as if they were our own, when as we are but
Servants; This is little believed or regarded.

3. For people, Use 3.
if they want a Shepherd, and be scattered, they must crave one of the chief
Shepherd; yea, generally, that he would furnish many, and send them abroad
among the lost and forlorn sheep; They must also submit themselves to their
Ministry and Government, as to those that be set over them by Christ, knowing
that if they despise them, they despise their Master; and if they be not won by
their Ministry, they despise the voice of Christ Jesus himself.

Ye shall receive a crown of glory that fades not away.] The great reward of
faithful Ministers.
Here Is the reward of faithful Ministers; They shall attain a state of
happiness, which God has provided for his in Heaven; its not to be uttered nor
conceived what it is: Its described, according to our weak conceit, by a feast,
a marriage feast of a Kings Son, a City whose Walls and Streets are Gold, and
Gates Pearls, etc. Its a State free from all evil; whereas here there is nothing
but crying and complaining, one of his head, lungs, back, etc. another of his
unruly children, losses by sea, by Bankrupts, etc. There all tears are wiped
away; there also there is no want of any thing, no need of any thing, whether
for body or soul, but a perfect enjoying of all good, for we shall enjoy God
himself, the fountain of all goodness; we shall also enjoy the society and
fellowship of the Lord Jesus, who has so loved us, and who is the joy of our
hearts: So of the holy Ghost the Comforter; so of the Angels, of the Patriarks,
Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, of our godly Friends, Children, Ministers, that
begat us to God, etc. where we shall be so filled with all comfort, as we shall
joy continually, for we shall sing night and day; the place also adds unto our
happiness: Needs must Heaven be excellent, as being prepared by God for himself
to set forth his magnificence; what its within, appears by its glorious
outside, and the glory thereof, by the fairness of the world, given to dogs and
Gods Enemies; this also is eternal: The glory of this world, as its not worthy
to be so called; so its inconstant and fickle (see it in Nebuchadnezzar,
Belshazzar, Herod) one day, yea, one hour knows us often, Dan. 12. 3.
both happy (as the world accounts) and miserable; 1 Timothy 4. 16.
but such is not the glory of Heaven, 2 Timothy 4. 8.
it endures for ever: This is here (as elsewhere) promised to faithful
Ministers, they shall enter into their Masters joy.

1. This may exceedingly encourage Ministers, Use 1.
to take all the pains that possibly they can in their calling; we serve a good
Master: O how men strive for a corruptible Crown, how much more should we for
an incorruptible! how careful should we be in Studying, Preaching, living well,
etc?

2. It may serve to uphold us in the midst, Use 2.
and against all discouragements; our office is not only painful, but
oftentimes fruitless, thankless; and perilous: A Minister shall have to do with
such dull ones, as he must teach them as a child new weaned, with line upon
line, precept upon precept; others are so wretched, as that by no means they
will be reclaimed; yea, oftentimes they may receive unkindeness where they
least expect it; people count our labors nothing, which yet we find such as we
are scarce able to undergo; others grudge at our maintenance, otherwhile we
shall (having delivered things never so carefully) be taxed by some of
ignorance, by others of malice; Ier. 20. 7.
others will raise up lies and slanders against us, and so requite our pains;
others will persecute us, as Demetrius, and Alexander the Copper-Smith did the
Apostles; yea, the more painful we are, the harder we shall be dealt with: Now
against all those and the like, has not a Minister need to have something to
comfort and hearten him? This will do it fully; the incorruptible Crown will
pay for all, we must look up to that: Contrarily, what will be the reward and
end of all unfaithful Ministers, that starve and mislead their Flock, that live
in jollity and at ease, etc? Oh, their reward will be with the unfaithful
Servant, to be taken and bound hand and foot, and thrown into utter darkness:
Then shall they pay for all the wages taken without doing any work; so for all
their ease, which will be turned into pain and woe; They shall then give an
account for all the souls that they have caused to perish. At what time they
shall receive their reward.


Q. But when shall Gods Ministers have their Crown?

Answ. When Christ shall appear and come to Judgment: O then, if he never
come, we shall never have our Crown! O doubt not once hereof! He shall
certainly come to Judgment: Its an Article of our faith, and which is often
mentioned in Scripture, See Matthew. 25. 31. Acts 2. 11. 1 Thessalonians. 4. 14. 2 Thessalonians.
1. 10. Rev. 1. 7. Therefore let neither the good doubt hereof, to become slack
or faint, nor the wicked, to continue careless. Obj.


Obj. But when will it be, Sol.
It will be long first?

Answ. It cannot be long ere it be, for we be in the latter end of the last
times; but if it were, our life is not long, and in the end thereof we shall
have one half of our Crown, and our bodies shall rest for the other until the
day of Judgment; therefore live by Faith, and wait, and be not short breathed:
If one part tarry a while, it will be so wonderful when it comes, Use 3.
as that it will abundantly pay for all.

3. For People; If they be good sheep, brought from their wandering, turned from
goats to sheep, and be ruled by the government of their godly Pastors, 2 Timothy
4. 8.
they shall also have this incorruptible Crown of glory: For the stubborn and
disobedient, that will retain their goatish qualities, that will not be brought
home by any means that can be used, their condition will be fearful; but in
death, when their souls shall be carried into Hell, and on the day of
Judgment, when they shall stand on the left hand; they which here would not
hear that voice that called them so often to him, shall then be charged to
depart from him: As this day will be joyful to the godly, so shall it be
terrible to the wicked,

Verse 5. Likewise ye younger, submit your selves unto the elder; yea, all of
you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility, for God resists
the proud, and gives grace to the humble.
THe Apostle proceeds to the duty of another special sort of people, namely,
the younger ones, showing what duty they owed to their elders, and then goes to
Exhortations to sundry particular duties.

Likewise ye younger, submit your selves unto the elder;] Although I use to
trouble you little with diverse interpretations or men's judgments, taking it
that my duty is to show you, rather what God says, then what men say; yet at
this time it will not be amiss to propound foam: Elders may be taken as in the
preceding uses, not for elders in years, but by office; and so by the younger
may be meant, not the young in years, but inferior in place, namely the people;
or if young in years are to be understood, What we are to understand by the
younger and the elder.
then a part for the whole is meant: All the people must submit themselves to
their Ministers, whereof a great part are young ones, and they commonly the most
unruly, and so the duty of people toward their Ministers is here taught, as
the word likewise seems to imply: Or Elders may well be taken for Elders in
age properly, and so the younger in like sort for the young sort of people, and
so the duty of youth toward them that are aged be here taught, as it may well
be, and the more likely in my mind: But I will not spend any time to approve
or disapprove the one more then the other, but speak something of both, as in
some such cases is not unusual nor amiss, when both may very well stand, and it
be difficult to say which is the true meaning of the place, this or that.

For the first; Wherein the duty of people toward their Ministers consists.
The duties of people toward their Ministers laid down in the fifth
commandment, stand in these four things: 1. They must reverence them for the
dignity, highness, and excellency of their Calling, in which respect they are
termed Angels, Stars, the light of the world, Heb. 13. 17.
Gods Ambassadors. 2. They must yield obedience to them in their Ministry. 3.
They must willingly allow them a sufficient maintenance, that they may wholly
without distraction attend on their souls. Ephesians. 1. 16, 17.
4. They must pray for them, both that their Ministry may be fruitful, Heb.
13. 18.
and that they may long continue amongst them, of those the second is the
principal; Namely, that

People must submit themselves to the Ministry of the Word in the mouths of
their Ministers; People must submit themsel^^s to the Ministry of the Word.
as we stand bound to preach, so do you to hear and obey: For, Blessed are they
that hear the word of God, and keep it, Luk 11. 28.
that are doers as well as hearers: God has not appointed us to Preach in
vain, but for the conversion of people; The Ministry is ordained to work
faith, to convert souls: it was the peoples request with promise to hear and
do; Exodus 20. 19.
God has yielded and sanctified it to be the only ordinary means (not
reading, 1 Cor. 1. 21.
not preaching by an Angel) even the foolishness of Preaching (by the hand of
men) to save them that believe.

If Ministers must be called to an account for Preaching, shall not the people
how they have profited? and if a woe to us if we preach not, Matthew. 11. 20.
is there not to them if they repent not? For this cause our Savior upbraided
those Cities wherein his mighty works were done, not because they would not
entertain him, nor hear him, as the Gadarens, but because they repented not: we
have done you no good, nor have you heard well, Romans 6. 17.
till you have repented and be converted, till you have obeyed from the heart
the form of Doctrine delivered you: The Law humbles, the Gospel wo^^th Faith,
both bring to a reformed, new and godly life; we hear aright when we go away
pricked in our hearts: Acts 2. 37.
Till then there is no good wrought on us, as appears by the Prophets
complaints, Acts 13. 48.
Isaiah 49. 4. and 53. 1. Jer. 6. 10. else no mark of Election, 2 Pet. 1. 10.
faith being a demonstration hereof; we make sure our Election by our effectual
calling: 1 Thessalonians* 1. 4, 5*
The Apostle also terms the Thessalonians Elect of God, because the preaching
was not to them in word only, but in power, and they received the word in much
affliction, and became followers of us, etc. and that they received his
preaching, not as the word of man, but as it is indeed, the Word of God; not to
hear and obey, is rather a mark of reprobation, as in Eli's Sons; 1 Samuel 2. 25.
If we be Christ's sheep, we hear his voice in the Ministry and follow him:
John 10. 27.
O what an excellent harmony would this make, if Ministers preach faithfully,
and the people become converted, and then built up in all obedience thereby!

1. Then this rebukes the woeful contempt of the world at most hands, Use 1.
for how few yield obedience thereto? look in all Towns, how many ignorant
persons that have no knowledge, neither will have any, give their minds to
none, but pull in their heads that they might not see the light that would
glister in their faces; who so blind as he that will not see? John 3. 19.
These are far from conversion: This is condemnation, that light is come into
the world, and men love darkness rather more then light: So how many profane
persons that live in some known sin (though some more outragiously then others)
as in Drunkenness, Whoredom, Malice, etc. That hear not, though the Charmer
charm never so wisely, and do even stop their ears; God knocks at the door of
their hearts, but they will not open; his Ministers cry out against their sins,
yet they rush on every one after his own hearts lust, and hates to be
reformed; having a pardon brought and offered them, if they would come in, they
stand out: What will become of these? having refused to hear a gracious voice
offering mercy, they shall hear a fearful voice denouncing judgment, not
hearing a voice calling them to him, they shall hear a voice commanding them
from him, and as he called and they refused, so shall they call, but not be
heard or regarded: What shall these have to say for themselves? Their iniquity
shall stop up their mouth: How many civil persons are there also, that be not
converted if they so continue, they shall perish, unless they be born again,
truly humbled, planted into Christ; obey in all things, not in the duties of
the second Table only, giving men their due, but of the first also, giving God
his, they cannot be saved: What should I speak of worldlings that are so glued
to the world, as they savor not at all of Heaven, or heavenly things? no such
thing can enter into their hearts, either they hear not the Word at all, or the
thorny cares of the world quickly choke that seed: What of Hypocrites, some
professing outwardly, and yet living in some known sin; others not so bad, that
yet fall far short, having gone some steps, and hoping that all is well? These
were never as yet truly humbled, and so not converted, and so had not that that
accompanies Salvation; these hear, but not aright: Every man therefore must
examine himself how he has heard, and whether the Word has been a means of
his true conversion, and whether he make conscience to submit himself to the
precepts thereof? They that can prove themselves thereby converted, how
comfortably may they go on, walking in obedience thereto? Contrarily, the care
of others is dangerous; for, think not that our preaching will go away
unregarded, or that its no matter how you have heard: Oh! Preachings and
Sacraments be dangerous things, life or death can do a great deal of good, or
as much hurt: to them that obey, its Salvation, but to the disobedient, its the
savor of death unto death: This is a fearful sin in this Land, and the cause of
all our plagues, Matthew. 11. 21.
by reason whereof we may fear worse: Remember the woe pronounced against
Chorazin and Bethsaida.

2. This may be for exhortation to all, Use 2.
that as they come and hear, so to submit themselves, Isaiah 11. 6.
and pray God to make his word effectual by his Spirit; Acts 26. 18.
So shall God be glorified, if of Lions we become Lambs; If won from Satan to
God: The Ministers shall rejoice, as having the greater Crown; The Angels in
Heaven will rejoice, having new fellow Servants; yea, God himself will rejoice,
the Father as having a new Son, Christ as having another member, the Holy Ghost
another Temple; only the Devil will be sorry, as who loses all, but your
selves shall have the benefit both here and for ever. Further,

Being converted, we should still listen and stoop to whatsoever commandment we
have thence of renouncing and forbearing this or that evil, or doing whatsoever
good, without reasoning, delays, excuses, saying, Now I see what the Word
says, I have done, I will yield and become obedient: Thus it ought to carry us
contrary to our profit, pleasure, ease, custom of our selves, fashion and
example of others, which yet but few do.

Thus of the first sense.

For the second, The duties of youth to the aged; As the Apostle has been
before in hand, with Subjects, Wives, Husbands, Servants duties, and now with
Ministers, so does he proceed to inform the younger of theirs toward their
elders. Gods Ministers must particularly inform every one of their duty.
Gods Ministers must not only teach things generally belonging to all, but
even special things belonging to every age, sex and condition of persons: They
must not only labor that people may become Christians, but that they may be
good in their special calling; like good husbands they must be in every corner,
instructing each in their duties, they must find out what be the special
faults of youth, as rashness, pride, unconstancy, speaking against them, and
laboring to prevent or cure them; so what be most needful for them, as
sobriety, humility, discretion, stayedness, accordingly calling for these; thus
must they do with the aged, speaking against their testiness and covetousness,
and calling upon stayedness and soundness in all good judgment and
conversation: So they must take notice of the faults most incident to women, as
niceness, curiosity, loquacity, accordingly endeavoring to cure them thereof;
for even in those that be good Christians, yet there may be some such
particular and special failings, as whereby the name of God and his Gospel may
be ill spoken of: Thus did the Apostles, being herein good and wise stewards,
to give to every one of the Lords Family their portion of meat in due season,
workmen that needed not be ashamed: The Scripture teaches every man his duty,
wherein accordingly (revealing every piece of Gods council) we are to instruct
them; for want of this the Gospel hears ill, even of those that have some good
things in them.

Therefore as Ministers must be wise, Use.
prompt Scribes taught of God, and careful herein; so people must be content,
nay, like well hereof; not repining nor finding fault with their Ministers, for
such weaknesses and faults as our nature is prone to: Neither must people
dislike, and say, What, cannot the Minister be content to open his Text, and
teach us general things, but he must meddle how we Husbands live with our
Wives, we Wives with our Husbands, how we behave our selves in our Families,
how we Servants should do our work, etc? This is an ill sign; a good hearer is
desirous the word should come home close to him and tell him of his duty, yea,
ere thou come to the hearing of the Word, pray, O that the Minister may come
home close to my corruptions! O that I may be so instructed in my duty, that I
may please God by performing the same! yea, if the Minister come not home so
close as we would, Luke 3. 10, 12, 14.
we should go and enquire of him of our duties, and what shall we do?

In particular; Wherein the duties of the younger toward their elders consists.
The younger must honor their elders (as its in the fifth Commandment) here
called submiting themselves, under which be these duties: 1. They must
reverence them inwardly in their hearts, and declare it by countenance, gesture
and behavior; and this they must do, because old age is a piece of Gods image,
and of his eternity, Ancient of days: See Lev. 19. 32.
If there be gray hairs alone, Dan. 7. 9.
they require reverence, See Prove. 16. 31.
but if with godliness, then double honor, for that is a great piece of the
image of God. 2. They must haste toward them when they are called, Job. 32. 4.
and looking on them reverently, Job 12. 12.
etc. for which the ancient is wisdom. 4. They must be obedient to them, to
their good councels, admonitions, Simile.
As if one that had passed a dangerous water with much difficulty, should tell
another Travellor which way to go safely through. 5. To pray for them, to have
all graces increased in them, and they fitted more and more to do good to many,
and that they may live long to that end, and to help on young ones. Alas, if all
were Colts in a Plough or Cart, what work would be there? usually therefore old
ones are joined to hold in and guide the young: Simile.
So does God in wisdom and mercy by those that are old, guide and direct them
that are young; so that youths must not behave themselves rudely or saw^ily in
countenance, word or deed, neither babble nor prate, nor shake off their
counsel and example which God has given them to follow.

1. For Elders; Use 1.
If the younger must honor and reverence them, then they must be such as deserve
it and procure it; they must speak so wisely and profitably, as young ones may
willingly lay their hand on their mouth and be silent; they must also give them
godly and good counsel, and an holy example, which the younger may follow: when
they see you dissolute, disordered, given to this or that vice,
Sabbath-breaking, lewd company, riot, they must advise and persuade them to
beware, telling them from their own observation how many have by such means
brought themselves to ruin; so about their matching, that they are to be ruled
and guided by their Parents; so when they see any trifle out their time, and
defer their repentance, and live riotously, they must thus from their own
experience expostulate with them, O make use of your time while you have it!
This is your freest time, if I had not got somewhat in my youth, it had been
bad with me now, being so dull and forgetful: or if we lost our time then, and
God has since brought us to repentance, let us tell them from our own
miserable experience, O take heed, do not as I did, I lost my time, and spent
it away foolishly, when I should have learned goodness, and now how dull am I?
Alas, I shall never come to any great matters, now I am past (and have lost) my
youth; if it had not been Gods unspeakable mercy, I had perished, and he lets
in a little light into me, but alas, how slow of capacity am I? what a bad
memory have I? So if we see them that will not be advised by counsel, we must
rebuke them, yea, carry such a gravity and godly hatred of sin, Job 29. 8.
as the wicked may stand in awe, and not dare abide our sight when they do
evil: But the most part of old folks are so silly and ignorant, that they have
no good counsel in them, nay, are blockish and unteachable; they spent their
own time badly, and never made conscience thereof, therefore do not they call
on others, not being converted, how can they strengthen others? Many also are
so far from rebuking them for disorder, and making the wicked afraid, as they
will sit still on their benches, and look upon youths rioting, dancing, etc.
and laugh at them, and so they strengthen them in their naughtiness; and if a
younger man reprove them, whether Officer or other, they do not make any
reckoning* thereof, for why, such an ancient old man will stand and look on us,
and when they see such coming, they are so far from fleeing as were meet, as
they are the more emboldned, because they know they shall be countenanced by
them; yea, these do in effect as Saul, who held the garments of those that
stoned Stephen; others there are, who though they will not stand looking on
them, yet will pass by, and say nothing to them, but rather bid them God speed,
and so are partakers of their evil: These also should give good example, be
paterns of piety, godliness, hatred of sin, zeal for Gods glory, love to the
house of God, etc. as those that have had much time, many means, and now have
but a while to live: If their example be good, it may do much good, Tit. 2. 2.
if ill, then no hoe; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob were godly old men; so Noah, Job,
Samuel, Simeon, their example did much good: But Oh, how vain, frothy and
unsavory are the words of some, being so profane, as youths might rather open
their mouth to reprove them, then give any attention to hear them: Some talk as
filthily, as if they had never repented of the whoredom of their youth; some
talk and tell to youths, and laugh at the lewd pranks of their youth, so
reading their Lectures of evil; they show themselves zealous to do evil, that
not only will do so themselves as long as they can, but would that others
should after them; the contrary is a good sign: Some also even aged, are
Swearers, Sabbath breakers, Al^househaunters, etc. some also, though for the
time they might have been Teachers (though not public ones, yet of the
youths) had need to be taught even the easiest Principles of Religion; they can
only tell you of old Stories, they can remember since King Henry went to
Bulloign, and can remember the old learning, and that they helped the Priest say
Mass many a time: If they could remember that they had repented of it, it were
well; or could remember of any good they did forty years ago; or that they were
greatly moved at a Sermon, and ever since have made conscience of their ways,
took such and such pains to hear, such delight to read in the Scriptures, and
other good Books, have sat up half nights in doing good, O this were well: If
they could talk of our Saviors birth, life, miracles, death; of his Apostles
and their acts; of the Israelites carrying into captivity, coming out of Egypt,
so of the Flood, of the Creation, etc. these things indeed would become them;
See 1 John 2. 13, 14.
as they can tell you how old they are, and in what Kings Reign they were born;
so if they could tell you when they were born again, and how old they are in
Christ, it were happy: But alas, in such things they have no more skill then
Nicodemus had when he first came to our Savior: They are dumb when they are put
from their old Stories, I knew his Grandfather, his great Grandfather, Isa.
65. 20.
etc. the older a man is, the worse he is, if he be not godly: O that such
would consider why they came into the world, how near death is, what good
counsel or good example they have given, whom they have kept from evil, or
furthered in good, what good they have done for their own Souls, how they
should have served God in holiness and righteousness all the days of their
life, and that they have not thus served him, for which they have a fearful
answer to make, Though there be no great hope in respect of your dullness, as
also that God will not accept such a lame Sacrifice, and the Devils leavings,
who requires the firstlings, and lest the Devil will not be put out, nor sin
accustomed unto be done away, yet nothing is impossible to God; therefore
despair not, only ply you with exceeding haste, lest you be shut out; and that
you may turn to God, get some assurance of his love, redeem the time, make some
amends, do some good ere you dye, as the good Thief that rebuked his fellow. If
old folks would not live, without being desired, nor be a burden, nor dye
without being mourned for, let them live to good use, and do good, so shall
their age be honorable and honored: There be some good old ancient men, but
alas, their ^umber is but small, and they not so zealous as they should be; old
men also in Towns must use their power and place to the good of the younger and
Church wherein they live, and not to ease their own bodies or purses, laying
the burden on their inferiors; See Tit. 2. 3. 4.
and as old men, so are old women also here meant, who must give good
instruction, and do good also by example; they must speak graciously, and to
good purpose, not given to Tale-telling, Malice, idle Talking, etc. as most are.

2. For youths, Use 2.
it rebukes the notorious pride and malepart boldness of the youths of our
times, in their gesture, carriage, speech to their elders, whether in public
or private; what a universal complaint do men make of their children? what a
complaint, especially of Servants, that there were never the like for pride,
idleness, untrustiness, etc. never looking for more maintenance, never less
duty. In former times, when they had not the tithe of the means they now enjoy,
servants were plain, diligent, trusty, careful to please, painful, etc. What a
shame is this? Hereupon they that be ill minded blame us and the Gospel, never
good servants since so much preaching: O woeful mouth, is our preaching or the
Word of God in the fault? Is there one word in the Bible, or does any one come
from us at any time, that teaches them so to do? Do not we teach them the
quite contrary? and do not you give God a good mends for the Gospel? There are
some which do even profess Religion, that yet suffer civil servants to go
beyond them in diligence, and trustiness, and gentleness, and good behavior:
Oh, what may we not fear upon the Land, for the ungraciousness of this
generation, seeing they will not bear the easy yoke of Government of their
Elders, they may look for some heavy yoke or other; God will set up houses of
Correction for such. How few youths make any account that it belongs to them to
be Religious? or that their youth should be otherwise spent then in vanity; but
the Scriptures call for Religion, even at the hands of young men. There are also
Reasons to dissuade young men from tainting their young years, and laying up
matter for their age, to roar for the sins of their youth, from losing this
freest and fittest time: The fittest, because they be fresh, and apt to
conceive, remember, and are strong, which way they set themselves to good or
evil: 1 John 2* 13.
The freest, as not being encumbered with cares, worldly businesses, etc. old
age also is dull, and unfit to learn; the trade of Christianity is to be
learned betimes: You young men and maids, and younger women, show your humility
in being ready to listen and follow any good council or example: If you have
seen God go before you in your Elders, and follow them not, your judgment will
be great, and sin without excuse: There be indeed Religious and sober good
youths, and young folks, married and single, and such as shall enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven before their Elders, children before their Parents, and
Servants before their Masters, and young men which be able to instruct, and be
paterns to the aged: 1 Timothy 6. 1.
These are comely persons, but how few be of these? These also must remember to
reverence their Parents, Masters, Elders, though they should not be for
knowledge or grace as they ought, and themselves have more then they.

All of you be subject one to another] He lays not this duty on the young only,
as in the former words, but now requires it of all, even of Superiors to
Inferiors, and equals each to other; not that he forgets himself, or would lay
all common, and make a confusion, as if the Superior ought as much submission
to his Inferiors, as they to him, and so equals each to other; not so, but they
must submit themselves to them in another kind, as Superiors to Inferiors, to
care for them, and seek their good, and bear with them; and equals to stoop to
do each other good, and to bear one with another, and yield and give way to
each other, not standing stiffly upon terms.

For Superiors, How superiors must be subject to their inferiors.
they must submit to their Inferiors, even Princes. Counselors, Nobles,
Judges, etc. must beat their heads, study and take pains for the good of the
Subjects, as the Subjects must submit to them in reverence, obedience,
tributes, etc. So they care for them, put themselves to pains to do them good,
for God has appointed no Calling to take all and pay nothing, but every honor
has a burden of care going with it. Simile.
As in the Members of the the natural Body, not one is allowed to be idle, but
every one works for the good of the whole; the eye looks, the tongue talks, the
foot walks, the hand works, etc. Now some may think that all these work, and
the stomach and belly in the midst lie still and be idle, doing nothing; but
its not so, for though they work not as the other, yet their work is as
profitable and necessary, without which they could not long stir; namely, they
concoct the meat, and nourish the whole body; the like may be said of Princes
and Magistrates: So Ministers, even the greatest must stoop low, and take care
publicly and privately of the meanest in the Congregation: Luke 22. 26.
He that is chief, must thus be servant of all: So the chief men in Towns, must
take care for the good of the poor; they must visit them into their poor
houses, and look in their cupboards, etc. its their glory thus to do; The
Angels tend on us, and scorn not, yea, God stoops to take care of us poor
Creatures; He numbers the hairs of our heads, and makes all our beds in our
sickness; So our Savior Christ, being rich, became poor for us; and the Holy
Ghost takes up us miserable Creatures for his lodging; Householders also, as
they look for submission from their Families, so must they submit themselves to
have care not of their bodies only, but to instruct, teach and admonish them
for the good of their souls; so Husbands must bear with their Wives weakness,
and not stand strictly upon every word amiss, when they are at sometimes
disquieted: Neither is it any disparagement for a Superior to yield to his
Inferior, but a commendation, for so did Abraham to Lot; let every one know we
be the Lords Stewards, and therefore must lay out as well as take in.

For equals,] How equals must be subject one to another.
There must be a doing good each to other, being not born for our selves: The
useful man is the man that will be beloved and have comfort, we may stand in
need one of another, and therefore must do good one to another; also we must
yield each to other, not as they that will strive for the wall or way, and lay
each other in the dirt; in reasoning we must not be stiff, and seek to have the
last word; in fallings out, if our adversary will not come at us, we must go to
him; In matter of commodity, if he will not yield an inch, we must; if he be
angry, break off, be silent, or answer mildely, etc. This is so far from being
any disgrace, as that its our honor and credit, what though we could master and
subdue another? we are far wiser if we can overcome our selves, and subdue our
own hearts to the word and will of God: Matthew. 5. 9.
This also tends greatly to peace, and blessed are the peacemakers, Simile.
without this no peace. A flint and steel being the one beat against the other
make fire, not so if we strike it against a cushion: The world thinks, shall I
yield to him? O this great courage to stand out, but its carnal and beastly
courage of Bulls and Bears, not of Christians; How many might have saved an
infinite deal of trouble and charge, yea, happily their lives, if they would but
have yielded a little at first, which afterward they have wished, when it was
too late.

Be clothed with humility,] Humility the fountain of submission.
He exhorts to another virtue, which is the mother and fountain of this
submission; would you thus submit your selves, then be humble: whence as we may
note, that where this submission is not, its for want of humility, and pride
bears sway, (which its needful we should take knowledge of, that we may the
better seek the cure) so we may learn, That

Whatsoever submission proceeds not from humbleness of heart, Whatsoever
submission proceeds not from humility, is hypocrisy.
is but dissimulation and hypocrisy; as Absalom, that behaved himself so lowly
to all the people, which yet had a most proud heart in him, to aspire to the
kingdom in his fathers life time: 2 Samuel 15. 5.
So the Pope calls himself Servus servorum Dei, when yet he lifts up himself
above all, makes himself head of the Church, to have Supremacy over Princes, to
set up and cast down at his pleasure, etc. So the Monks and Friars that pretend
great humility, in fasting and punishing themselves, which yet proceeds from a
proud heart, thinking hereby to merit at the hand of God: So they that profess
voluntary poverty, which yet live in abundance of all things; so many among us
use low conges and crouches, which yet have all ensigns of pride upon them; so
some that be mean enough in apparel, and will speak so lowly, and give so much
to others, even more then is fit, and abuse themselves too much, which yet do
it but in cunning and with a proud heart, as may appear by their gibing and
jesting at those whom it may be they have thus spoken to and preferred; as also
their jesting at others, whom if you shall stir a little, you shall find them
more like Lions, and unappeasable, which is the sign of a proud heart; yea,
some will put down themselves too low, that all may advance them the more, and
dispraise themselves, to have others set out their commendations.

The clothing which is here principally meant, is the inward: The filthy Soul
must be clothed with the white raiment of Christ's Righteousness: The soul
(behang'd with the filthy rags of beastly lusts) must be adorned with the
sanctifying graces of Gods Spirit; The Church is all glorious within: Psalm. 45.
13.
Thus must both men and women of all sorts be adorned, and herein be paterns
unto others. Here is not now present any naked body (you would be ashamed that
there should) but I am afraid that there is here many a naked Soul, nay worse,
even defiled with many noisome lusts of Pride, Ignorance, Hypocrisy,
Profaneness, etc.

In particular, What humility is.
the virtue exhorted unto, is Humility, which has his place in the heart, and
shows it self outwardly by fruits in the countenance, gestures, speeches and
actions of the life: This is a virtue and grace of Gods Spirit, whereby a man
not out of cunning, melancholy, carelessness, or discontent with himself, but
from a true knowledge of God, himself and others, does with an unfeigned,
voluntary, free meekness of mind, set a low value of his own worth, or does
esteem meanly of himself: Matthew. 11. 29.
Though the natural man may seem more humble, Romans 12. 16.
then some Christians, Ephesians. 4. 1.
yet the proudest Christian has more humility then the humblest carnal man:
Phil. 2. 3.
This is often called for in Scripture, Luke 14. 10.
and taught by our Savior Christ in the matter of the guests, and is also
commended much in the Proverbs: Besides, pride, which is opposite to it, is
continually forbidden and condemned, all which are of many commendations of
humility.

To point it out the better, see it by the fruits thereof, and then by examples.

The fruits may be considered, The fruits of humility in respect of God.
either in respect of God or men. In respect of God, 1. It makes a man, seeing
his own woeful state by nature, by his guiltiness in Adam, by his actual sins
also, and bondage under sin, and all the curses due thereby, to renounce and
abhor himself, See Luke 9. 23
as the poor Publican and Prodigal child, the Patriarchs showed it in
sackcloath and ashes: This is the first step to Heaven, and without which there
is no coming to the Kingdom of God. 2. It makes a man acknowledge himself
unworthy of any Abraham, Jacob, Peter, with others: See Genesis 18. 27. and 32.
10. 2 Samuel 7. 18. Psalm. 8. 4, etc. 3. It makes a man Dan. 2. 27. Act. 3. 12.
and 14. 15. 1 Cor. 4. 7. As they in an Hospital, Simile.
they are not ashamed of the Founder thereof, but keep the memory of him;
neither are they fit to receive any thing, who will not acknowledge it:
Nebuchadnezzar was seven years in David, Open mine eyes, stay my feet in thy
ways, ^ead me forth, forsake me not, teach me, quicken me, etc. so that the
humble man is full, as of thanks, so of Prayers. See Ier. 43. 2.
Thereupon he says, Speak Lord, for thy servant hears. Iam. 5. 21.
Humility is the mother of Obedience, as pride of disobedience; therefore we
are willed to receive the word Ahabs Sam. 3. 18. 2 Samuel 15. 26. Psalm. 39. as in
respect of our own unworthiness, Iam. 3. 22.
as Mic. 7. 9. knowing that we have deserved a thousand times more, and that
its of his mercy, we are not consumed. If we be reproached or wronged by men,
we will bear it quietly, as David being raised upon by Shimei, 2 Kings 6. 33.
because we know we have deserved to be made a threshold for all to tread on,
and therefore we will wait patiently on God for deliverance; when the proud
will withdraw, and lift up their minds, and wait no longer; or mur^^^^ as the
(...), or blaspheme, as those mentioned Rev. 16. or (...) means, as Ahakia and
Sa^t: If poverty seize on them, they will stoop to it, See Job 1.
and only use diligence and prayer: If their Goods, Children, Friends be taken
away, humility will say, He has taken but what he gave or lent me for a
season. 8. It makes

of men.

not dissemblingly, but ingenuously; so inwardly, to esteem others better then
our selves, knowing our own faults, and looking Abraham to Let, not standing
stiffly upon terms, I am his b^^ters let him come to me if he will: It makes

which will not only serve to persuade us thereto, but show us further the
nature thereof. Heb. 11. 7.
Noah an humble man, moved with a reverend fear, without any contradiction,
Genesis 18. 27.
went about and finished that tedious and troublesome work of making the Ark.
Abraham acknowledged himself to be but dust and ashes, and followed Gods
command he knew not whither, yea, Exodus 4. 14.
was ready to have sacrificed his only Son. Moses was very humble, refusing to
be made Ruler over the Israelites, till he saw God was angry; also he followed
the counsel of his Father in Law, and would have had him gone with him into
Canaan, which would have somewhat darkened him, to have an Equal or Superior to
go with him: So when the people murmured against him, Exodus 17. 4.
and were ready to have stoned him, he prayed to God on their behalf. David
acknowledged all his confidence to be from God, being continually in
thanksgiving, or admiration at Gods bounty, or praying for grace, bearing the
hand of God patiently: 1 Samuel 18. 23.
So to menward, What am I (says he) that I should be son in Law to a King,
etc. This grace also was eminent in Hezekiah, Gideon, John the Baptist, The
Virgin Mary, Cornelius, The Centurion, Paul and Barnabas: Mat. 11. 29.
but the most absolute pattern of all, was our Savior Christ; Phil. 2. 8.
who as he bad us learn it of him, 1 Pet. 3. 18.
so the Apostles Paul and Peter do often set forth his example to be followed
of us. He was born of a woman of low degree, in a mean place, laid in a Cratch,
subject to his Parents till he was of the age of thirty years, once only he
showed himself among the Doctors when he was twelve years old: At thirty years
old he came to John the Baptist to be baptized of him: He chose mean Apostles,
and who lived in a mean degree: He had not whereon to rest his head: Usually he
went on foot, yea, till he was weary: Mat. 21. 7.
When he did ride (which was but once as was foretold) it was meanly, on an
Ass: He refused to be a Judge or Divider, or to be made a King: He eat his meat
sometimes in the fields; he washed his Disciples feet; he humbled himself for
our sakes to the death, even the death of the Cross; Humility an excellent
virtue.
all which show forth his humility. This is a most excellent virtue, greatly
pleasing to God, and greatly accounted of by men: Mat. 18. 9.
Every man loves and likes them that are humble, though many will not so be: As
its of absolute necessity to Salvation, so its greatly behoofful for a man's
well passing his time: Hereby he shall escape many dangers and evils, and pass
his time more safely, with more favor of God and men: The humble man has this
privilege, that he cannot fall, he makes himself so low; he judges himself,
and so shall not be judged of God: Humility gives glory to God, and God gives
honor to the humble; its a beautiful Ornament wherewith we are to deck our
selves: its the Ornament of all graces, have a man much or little: Let a man be
empty and proud, its most odious, as often it falls out, the emptiest vessels
make the loudest noise: If a man have but a little, yet walking humbly he is
esteemed: Ephesians. 41, 2.
If a man have never such good parts, if he be puffed up with them, its a
disgrace to them all, as dead Flies in a precious box of ointment. This is an
helpful virtue, also a peaceable virtue, tending greatly to a quiet life.

1. This should teach us to examine our selves by the forementioned notes, Use
1.
that we may find to our comfort that we have attained the same in some good
measure: He that has it, has an ornament, has a jewel indeed.

2. As those that have it are to labor by all means to increase therein; Use 2.
so for those that want it, they must labor for it: To this end we must pray
for it, we must set the forementioned examples before our eyes, and often think
of them: We must look into our own vileness and wretchedness, by reason of our
many great sins, and the curse due thereto, and this will drive us to God; into
our own baseness, and this will make us thankful into; our own inability to
good, and this will make us pray; into our own meanness, and Gods greatness and
goodness, and this will make us stoop to his Commandments, and to his Cross:
Also to men-ward, we must look on our own faults and others virtues, and
aggravate our evils above theirs, and the good things in them above those in
our selves. O let us walk humbly both in respect of God and men: Let us not be
proud of our gifts, not trust to our selves, nor despise, reject and condemn
others; else whereas great honor might redound to our profession, and we might
do much good, we shall do much hurt.

For God resists the proud, etc.] The Reason of the Exhortation taken from
the benefit, and illustrated by the contrary. Pride and Humility are like Esau
and Jacob, Ier. 42. 8. and 48. 11.
hates the one, as much as he loves the other: The proud man either gives Gods
glory to another, or detains it from God, which cannot be without his wrath:
This is in respect of God and men, as was said of humility, and by the notes of
that, this may be discerned. The fruits of pride in respect of God.


In respect of God, 1. Pride makes men think themselves not so bad, but they
have something in them, and can do something to commend them to God, and
whereby to be saved; these be the whole and righteous whom Christ came not to
call: Rev. 3. 17.
These are like the young man in the Gospel, like the Church of Laodicea: Thus
the Papists think they have some natural strength in them to deserve the first
grace, and with the help of that to merit the next, and eternal life: Thus many
boast of their Civil Righteousness; Thus ignorant persons hope to be saved by
their good meaning and good prayers, and that they have a good heart in them,
and that they love God above all, and their neighbors as themselves. This is
most detestable pride, for a base and woeful creature, a lump of misery and sin,
to think himself good See Prove. 28. 14.
goes to the Word and prays not; so into ill company, etc. 5. Pride makes Ier.
13. 15. and 43. 2. and 44. 16, 17.
yet many living in sins, even contrary to their knowledge, think they be not
proud. 6. Pride makes men that they are as the Israelites, that would go out
and seek Manna on the Sabbath day, though they were told before they should
find none. The men of Beth-shemesh would pry into the Ark: Some there are that
delight in curious questions, some meddle with matters beyond their reach, some
with things out of the compass of their calling, some also will not rest
satisfied, when they see what Gods Word says in a thing, but cavil and make
objections against the same. Thus in respect of God.

In respect of men: In respect of men.
1. It makes men prefer themselves before others, thinking more highly of
themselves then of others, looking on their own virtues, and on other folks
faults: It makes men look for great Titles, high Places, and to be preferred
and set up, and strive, and be discontent if they have not the same, as Haman
was vexed that Mordecai did not stoop to him. The Scribes and Pharisees did
love greetings in the Marketplaces, and to be saluted, Rabbi; Saul would have
Samuel honor him before the people, the Disciples strove who Prove. 13. 10.

stricken with thunder* or overturned with winds: This is odious to men; humble
men see and mislike it, even proud men cannot abide it in others; Yonder, say
they, goes one will not give his head for the washing, that thinks better of
himself then all the Parish besides; He has a good wit, but he knows it; She
is very fair, How hurtful.
but ye need not tell her thereof: It makes a man run into many sins, into many
absurdities, and draws on many punishments: It disgraceth all good gifts, and
so stains them, as they become unprofitable: It makes us incapable of the grace
of God, as the hilly ground shuts off the rain, therefore those profit not by
the Word, nor by the Sacraments, nor can pray, etc.

This is naturally bred in our hearts, Whence it comes.
and very hardly rooted out; it comes much, either of abundance, or of conceit
and opinion of much; usually or abundance: If any have more Beauty, Wit,
Strength, Skill in any Calling, Knowledge, Gifts, Wealth, Authority, or the
like, this makes the heart swell, in a base or mean condition under affliction
or misery to be humble (at least in show) is nothing, but in abundance of gifts
to be humble, this is a great grace and rare.

This is not only in the common sort and wicked, The very best not free
therefrom.
but haunteth even the Servants of God, and rises of the ashes of other sins;
when we have got the mastery over them, and grace and ability to do good
duties, then pride thrusts in to make us think well of our selves, as if we had
done them by our own power, and so even in our best duties; there is most danger
of this. Hence it is that the Lord leaves corruptions and infirmities in the
hearts of his Children to hold them under: Therefore are they so often foiled,
when they seek themselves most. Hence many Christians of good parts are held in
a poor estate, See Job 33. 17
lest they should wax proud; yea, if it prove very rank, and bear a great
stroke in them, he lets them fall into some foul sin, or some notable disgrace,
to cure them of pride: for desperate diseases must have a desperate cure. Its
the Devils practice, if he can no way else prevail with a man, to win him to
evil, or to live in any sin, but that he has got good gifts, and is careful in
the use of them, then he seeks to blow them up with pride; as Enemies when they
have long laid Siege to a Town, Simile.
and can by no means win it, at last they undermine it, and seek to blow it up
with Gunpowder.

1. Let us examine our selves concerning this sin; Use 1.
this may be generally said, and too truly, that this Land is universally
overspread with the same in a fearful manner. How is Christ preached, and how
few embrace him, at least in their hearts, and stoop to him? How few use the
gifts they have to Gods glory, as acknowledging they come from him, but seek
themselves only; using their wealth, wit, skill, etc. as they list?
Universally men obey not, nor will stoop to the word of God, but do what they
list, whatsoever God says. How generally do men use unlawful shifts in their
crosses? what contentions, stirs, ^usts, are between some about places? what
notorious pride and excess is there in apparel? whereby we may justly fear the
Lord has a quarrel against us; yea, though we are in such a fearful state, we
think highly of our selves, and as if our care had never been better, cannot
endure to be told that these are dangerous and evil times, yea, its dangerous
to say that these are dangerous times: What measure soever we have of pride,
its both dangerous and damnable. If men trust to something in themselves; if
they stoop not to the word; if they use unlawful means in their afflictions, as
good have Ratsbane in their bellies, as this pride in their hearts: If we be
conceited of the good things in us, take too much to our selves, set too light
by others, think too well of our own strength, lift up our selves above others,
be contentious, censurers, such as will bear no reproof, proud in our speeches
and apparel, the least of this will provoke God against us.

2. Let us labor to be purged of this deadly sickness: Use 2.
The consideration of our matter, See Job 17. 13.
Dust and Ashes, our mortality and frailty, that we may be under the clods ere
the morrow; our sinful state whereby we deserve that curse and all evils; our
readiness to fall into any evil, the glory, power, justice, goodness, holiness
and purity of God, may dissuade us from pride. O take heed of pride, the worm
and canker of any grace, and that which hinders the good our gifts might do.

God resists,] God sets himself against the proud.
A warlike word; is up in arms, makes open war, and professedly sets himself
against the proud, as the Angel that stood with a sword drawn to resist Balaam
in the way: See to this purpose Prove. 6. 17. 16. 5. 18. Psalm. 119. 21. Luke 1.
52. and 14.

Reasons. Reasons.
This stands in Gods light, and robs him of his glory; its not Caesar's friend,
the arch-Traytor: Will God suffer himself to be spoiled of his glory by a poor
creature? God delights to disgrace them that think so highly of themselves, and
so lift up themselves above others; so, lest they should do too much hurt, for
if proud men get wealth and authority, there is no hoe. This also will be more
taken knowledge of, then if many inferior ones were cut off; and will also
prevail more, for if God has crossed and cut off those, others will beware.

God resists them, How God resists them.
sometimes by taking away that they be proud of, wit (sending them frenzy)
beauty (sending them deformity) gay clothes, sending them rags, etc. Sometimes
he makes their pride become them ill, and so they be noted and disgraced
thereby: Sometimes he makes their gifts unprofitable, and blasteth them, that
they dye, foils them, when they seek themselves most, lets them fall into some
foul sin, and so shames them, or crosses them by some punishment or other,
etc. God will cast dung in their faces, and besmear them; he delights to
disgrace such. Call to mind the forementioned Examples, of the evil Angels,
ths Builders of Babel, Pharaoh, Adonibezek, etc. and how God set himself
against them.

1. If we observe any to be very proud, Use 1.
do not we envy them, but rather pity them; Prove. 16. 5.
for God is their enemy, and their destruction cannot be far off.

2. As we would avoid destruction, let us take heed of pride, and labor to be
purged of it more and more; let us resist it and stamp it down. God will not
give his graces to those that will rob him of the glory of them. If we strive
not against this, but yield hereto, God will either let us fall into some foul
sin, and so shame our selves to cure us, or at least he will thwart us with
many crosses, which by humility we may avoid.

And gives grace to the humble,] The direct Reason to move us to humility, See
Ier. 57. 15. and 66. 2.
Unto the humble, God gives the gifts of his Spirit, temporal deliverances and
favors, Luke 1. 53.
respect among men, favor with him self; How God gives grace to the humble.
he dwells with such, and fills them with good things. This may be showed in
all the properties thereof before mentioned: 1. They that be vile, and nothing
in their own eyes, and be poor, mourning, Luke 18. 14.
and do any thing at Gods command. 2. Such as acknowledge themselves unworthy
Abraham, Jacob, the Centurion, the woman of Canaan* with others. 3. They that
acknowledge, Psalm. 119. 100.
as the thirsty ground with rain. David prayed to be taught, and got more
understanding then the Ancients; to this end also they will hear, read, come to
the Sacraments, etc. as knowing the need they have of help, and so are helped.
5. They that humbly submit themselves Psalm. 25. 9.
These shall save themselves from many a sin and sorrow, Ioh. 7. 17.
which else with David, Jonah and Peter, they may bring upon themselves. 6.
When having sinned, they humble themselves, God is Josiah. 7. Them that humble
themselves under David from Saul, from Absalom. 8. Them that keep themselves
humbly within

The Use follows in the following words.

Verse 6. Humble your selves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he
may exalt you in due time.
THe Apostle having showed that Humility is an ornament to be labored for, and
given a Reason thereof, he does here press the same with an Exhortation,
teaching both us how to preach, and you how to hear: We must deliver sound
Doctrine, prove it strongly by Arguments and Reasons, and then urge the
practice thereof, to the avoiding of evil, and performing good, else we do
nothing. People also must thus hear; How Ministers ought to preach, and people
to hear.
when they know a thing, then must they yield to the obedience thereof, else
all is nothing. We must be cast into the mold and shape of the Doctrine
delivered; we must follow the sample and pattern of the Word; we must write
after our copy, though happily we do it not so fairly as were requisite; we must
be like the echo that answers the same sound to the voice, Psalm. 27. 8.
though not perfectly: Our lives must in some measure be answerable to the word.

Humble your selves therefore.] Humility is the way to Gods grace. If in seeing
our own vileness and sin, we do humble our selves, God will have mercy on us:
Shall not the grace of God allure us, which is more worth then the whole world?
what else will? But of this before.

Under the mighty hand of God,] Two other Reasons persuading to humility.
Now follow two other Reasons to persuade to humility; One from Gods power,
with whom we have to do; the other, from the preferment whereunto we shall
attain in due time, he will exalt us.

From the 1. The mighty hand of God, either to lift us up being humble, or cast
us down being proud. Note, that

The consideration of Gods Almightiness is a good mean to make us humble: The
consideration of Gods power a good means to persuade to humility.
See this in Peter, at the great draught of fishes, Depart from me, for I am a
sinful man: So Abraham, I am but dust and ashes: So Isaiah, Woe is me, I am
undone, etc. Hence God gave his Law in such terrible manner, and humbled his
Servants whom he was to send unto his people with fearful visions; Isa. 6. 5.
so when God would somewhat take down Job, he did it by showing him his power
in his creatures. Gods hand indeed is mighty, that made the world of nothing,
divided the Red sea, opened the earth in sunder, made the mountains to tremble,
and will raise us out of our graves in the last day. This ought much to affect
us, that so we might seek to get into his favor, stoop to his Word, submit our
selves under the cross, and be humbled: The want of this is the cause of pride,
and that we do not stoop before the Lord: We think because we can make our part
good one with another, we can do so with God: But O potsheard, who art thou
that strivest with thy maker? What is the potsheard to the bar of iron? whether
it give or take the blow, it breaks into pieces; the proudest Giants have not
stood before him when he has been angry: If the Lion roar, Simile.
the Beasts tremble. If a Giant should take an ordinary man in hand, what could
he not do? would he not fling him against the ground, and make the earth to
ring? so does God by many a proud man in a year, he flings him on his back
against the ground, and makes all the Country ring of the fall.

O then consider this, and humble thy self for thy sins past; labor to get into
Gods favor, stoop to his Word when he speaks, yield and bow under his
afflicting hand, lest he tear thee in pieces, whiles there is none to help,
Psalm. 2. 12.
if his wrath burn but a little: Oh, Kiss the Son lest he be angry, and ye
perish in his wrath: Little did Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, and others, think God
had such a mighty hand: Be wise by their harms, stoop in time, lest he make
thee have woeful experience of his Almightiness to thy confusion.

And he will exalt you,] Namely, with grace here and glory hereafter. This is
the second Reason, from which note, that

Humility is the way to glory: Humility is the way to glory.
This may be showed in the forementioned properties of humility: If a man
confess and humble himself in the sight of sins, God will exalt him with
comfort; so will he outwardly advance the humble and dejected. Leah being
despised, God made her fruitful, Genesis 29. 31.
as David from the Ewes to be anointed, and after he was humbled under many
afflictions, Psalm. 78. 71.
God exalted him to the Kingdom in his own time; See Job 5. 11. and 22. 29.
so were Joseph, Esther, Mordecai exalted; so will he exalt to glory in Heaven
all his that have humbly walked before him amidst their sorrows, Prove. 29. 23.
and the many afflictions of this life, as Lazarus.

Labor we therefore for humility, Use.
if we would be indeed exalted.

In due time.] God does all things in due time.
Though Gods servants be not always advanced or delivered when they will, yet
shall they in due time: God is not only able and willing to exalt his humble
servants, but infinitely wise to know the fittest time: Ier. 5. 24.
He does all things in due time: If he deal with the insensible earth (if our
sins hinder not) he sends rain, Psalm. 145. 15.
the former and latter in due season: If with bruit Creatures, he gives them
meat in due season, on whom they wait for it, much more will he give unto his
own servants: Deuteronomy. 32. 35.
He that teaches men to do things in due season, to sow, plant, reap, fell
timber, all things to their best advantage, will do his in season. As he pulls
down the wicked in due time (though often not when we think good, or so soon as
we would, but when it shall be most for his glory, the comfort of his servants,
and the greatest shame and astonishment of his adversaries, as it was with the
builders of Babel, Haman, and others) so will he also exalt his own, as were
Joseph, David, Moses, with others.

Let us wait upon God patiently, Use.
think not long, use the means diligently, and pray, but murmr not, use no
unlawful means: We must not despair, though we be not helped by and by, knowing
that the due time is not yet. Sarah and Rebecca failed herein, and used
unlawful shifts, the one to obtain a child by her handmaid; the other, the
blessing for the Son she loved. Isaac would not do so, but waited and prayed
twenty years together for a child, and never would meddle with any handmaids
bed: We may not appoint the Lord the time, whose are times and seasons.

Verse 7. Casting all your care on him, for he cares for you.
HEre he exhorts to another necessary virtue, even Faith and Confidence in God,
whereby laying aside all superfluous and excessive care, we depend upon God for
the welfare both of body and soul: This is of very great use in our life, and
that which will make it much more comfortable then most men's lives be. It may
depend on the foregoing matter thus, The prevention of an Objection.
as an Answer to an Objection that might rise from the former point, which
concerns humility: If we should be thus humble toward men, then should we be
misused of all, and made a threshold whereon to tread: No, says the Apostle,
cast your care on God for that, do that you are commanded, and commend your
selves to God, he will care for you; Will he suffer them that obey him to be
trodden under foot? No: What will he do then? take the care of them, and that
both for body and soul: Here then we have an Exhortation and a Reason.

Casting all your care on him,] Christians must neither be careless, nor too
careful.
What, would he have us altogether careless, and have no regard what becomes
of our bodies and souls, but leave all to God? No, there are two extremes to be
avoided, too careless, and too careful; a Christian must go in the midst.

By All, They must not be careless
he means all superfluous and distrustful care. God bids we should labor,
strive, seek, give all diligence in the matters of Salvation, to get Knowledge,
Faith, Repentance, etc. therefore must hear, read, meditate, pray, confer, etc.
for though God work both the will and the deed, yet he will have us work out
our salvation with fear and trembling; he will not save us without us: So for
this life, we must be painful; as Adam both before and after his fall: Every
man must have an honest calling, and therein take pains (else he must not eat)
that he may be a profitable member in his place: Prove. 10. 4.
As the wise man commends diligence, so does he as well speak against
idleness; yea, we must have an honest and moderate lawful care; therefore is
the sluggard sent to the Ant to forecast, Pro. 6. 6.
and save somewhat in youth against age, Genesis 41: 48.
in health against sickness, as Joseph in the time of plenty saved for the
years of famine; All this God likes well: When these two meet, as they did in
that good woman, Pro. 31. or when one is husbandly both for soul and body, as
either of them is better then nor, so both of them are excellent: Who may tend
upon the good of their souls, better then the diligent and provident? Who may
do more good to others then they? for idle persons and unthrifts, are neither
good for themselves, nor any body else.

1. This rebukes slothful Christians, Use 1.
that have no care of their souls, regard not the Lords Market Day, the
Sabbath, care not for the Word, or else come coldly unto it, without buying, or
laboring to make provision of those graces needful to Salvation; care not for
Prayer, the Sacraments, Religious Company, etc. Hence it is that they have
ragged, beggarly souls, void of any true riches or spiritual graces, and so
will be cast out with Dogs: This will be fearful condemation, that so few wise
Merchants purchase the Pearl, lay up treasure for their souls, or seek the true
riches in Christ; few labor for the meat that endures to life everlasting: O
the soul is little regarded, and yet what profit is it to win the whole world
with the loss thereof?

2. It rebukes idle persons, Use 2.
that have no Calling, no skill in any, no mind to follow any; or if they do,
then do they unthriftily waste their time in drinking, gaming, etc. and when
they come home, either through their own pride and unthriftiness or their
wives, they lash out as long as their means lasts, without any frugality or
moderation, whence poverty takes hold on them, whereof they should take
notice, and reform: Oh, its an ornament in a Christian to be diligent and
frugal.

The other extreme which is forbidden, They must not be too careful.
is, Excessive care; and this is for soul or body: Soul, when we cast
distrustful thoughts, or have cares out of our own reach, About their souls.
and which be in Gods power; as thus, If one that has been a notorious bad
person, hearing the Gospel preached, and Mercy proclaimed to such, should be
held off, because he never looks that any such thing should be done to him, but
thinks it impossible he should ever come to good, that has been thus and thus
bad, and so hold off, and thinks as good never being to seek to God, for it
will never be. This partly must use the means that God has ordained for
miserable sinners to come unto him, and find mercy by, and commend the success
to God. Another having begun to find some comfort, and enter upon a good
course, is held off, hearing he must renounce all sin, and labor to please God
in all things, else no salvation; now he has one sin or corruption he thinks
verily he shall never prevail against, therefore as good never go further: He
must use the means of subduing this by the Word, Prayer, the Sacraments, etc.
knowing that as God gives him strength against some, he can also and will in
time against all corruptions; in the mean time, take it. Another having begun,
hears, that he only that endures to the end shall be saved, and he thinks he
shall never, but shall fall either finally, and perish, or at least most foully
into some error in judgment, or sin in life, and shame all, and therefore as
good go no further: But God bids us use the means, and look for good success,
and cast our selves on him. I grant indeed, if we should look upon the world,
the Devil, our selves, we might fear; as also considering that many great ones
have fallen; but its like either they trusted to themselves, or neglected the
means; which if we do not, God will keep us: If we should use the means, and
yet torture our selves with care, how miserable were our lives? Another says,
he shall never be able to abide persecution and the fire, let such labor for
faith and love, and yield to God in what he calls for; bearing present
afflictions patiently, whom God will enable to greater, if he shall call them
thereto: So some are afraid they shall dye a raving death, some that they shall
be bedrid and lame, some that if they should have the Stone, or such a grievous
torment, they were never able to endure it, etc. Its good in some sort to hove
some such forethought to quicken our care, but not distrustfully to discourage
our selves. Again, if a man should be so careful for his soul, as to neglect
his Calling, and think he should not follow it, this were excessive care.

Excessive care for the body; About their bodies.
its either for fear of evils, or for obtaining good things: For the 1. O what
if I should lose all I have, and come to misery, by Bankrupts, fire, etc? What
if I should fall into such a cruel man's hands, he would undo me? Also what if I
should for my well doing and profession have my Landlords displeasure, be put
into Courts, brought into trouble, etc. we must labor for grace to bear us out
in such things, and for heaven, doing our duty wisely and godly, as Daniel, and
leaving the issue to God, on whom we must cast our selves and our care.

For the 1. Its either when we take care for the successes of things, which is
Gods part, or when we use excessive care, that makes us sin, by neglecting some
duty, or committing some evil: For successes, as when we have made a bargain,
and used the means, then we fall to take thought for the success too; but Oh,
if it should not prove well, I should be hindered or undone, but we must use the
means, and leave the success to God, when we have used the outward means, and
prayed, and so sanctified our labors, then ought we to live by faith, and be
assured that we shall have that success that God shall see best. If it shall
fall out to my desire, I shall desire to be thankful, if otherwise, Hest. 4. 16.
I know God will dispose it to the best, as Esther, If I perish, I perish. For
excessive care for worldly things, when men will for these neglect good duties
to God, their own Souls, Families, Poor, Word, Sacraments, Prayer, etc. or
shall commit evil, by stealing, oppressing, dissembling, defrauding, breaking
the Sabbath, etc. This is wicked. Would God have us provide for our selves with
his dishonor, with the wounding of our own souls, and hurting our brethren? or
cannot he provide for us sufficiently without these? When we follow our
Callings (all duties discharged) and be provident and thrifty that nothing be
lost, this is as far as we must go, further we must not, any further is too far.

1. This rebukes the universal sin in this Land: Use 1.
Poor people take such thought what they shall eat, etc. that they lie, steal,
etc. The richer sort use all unconscionable courses, dare not come to the Word
for fear of wanting, nor read nor pray in their Families, but dare do any evil,
or at least be so excessively careful, as that thereupon they use lying,
deceit, oppression, racking rents, etc. and this is not the fault of the bad
only, but even of Gods servants, who be tainted with too much care, under the
the color of lawful care going too too far: They are careful oftentimes about
the successes of things, when they might by faith rest quietly on God: They do
often neglect good, or post it over, and do evil with more care.

The root of this in the men of the world, is want of Faith, for had they any
persuasion of Gods love and care, they would not be thus careful; so also the
want of prizing, seeking and regarding Heaven and Spiritual things. In Gods
children, the weakness of Faith is the ground hereof; as also their too little
esteeming of heaven and heavenly things: For if we were assured of Gods
particular caring for us, and that heaven (so excellent a place) is ours, and
did more highly esteem of Spiritual graces, with the means thereof, we would
spend much time in them, and so be kept from so much worldly care.

2. Let us therefore labor to be purged of this distrustful care, Use 2.
or being free, to keep our selves so: To this end we must labor for faith, and
to increase therein, and highly to prize grace; and the rather must we thus do,
because as this vice has so ill roots, so the fruits are as bad. Excessive
care for the world hurts the body, brings gray hairs, distracts and rends the
mind asunder, makes a man unfit for any good, unfit to be a good Magistrate
(as who will never tend or regard the public good) so to be a good Minister,
nay, to be a good householder, as which will justle out or hinder Reading,
Prayer, good Duties, etc. It hinders a man from the Word, or if he does come
thereto, he is already so full, as all runs beside, or falls asleep, and so
cannot meditate thereon, Luke 14. 18.
or receive any comfort thereby; it choaks the Word, Luke 21. 34.
yea, in time makes a man mock at it: It makes him unfit to pray or perform any
other duty, yea, unfit to dye, and for Christ's coming; but fit for all evil,
for its the root of all evil, and easily leads a man to the breach of any
Commandment: The Devil can fasten any temptation on such a one.

Let us therefore take heed of it, Why we ought not to be too careful of
worldly things.
and the rather for that 1. These things be good in a very mean degree, cannot
breed contentment, nor make a man happy. 2. They are base, bones for Dogs, such
as Reprobates have more in plenty, then Gods Children, more meet as wages for
slaves, then portions for Children, even the wicked have these, but the godly
have spiritual graces here, and hereafter eternal life. 3. They be very vain,
subject to many losses and changes; yea, and we are as vain as they, which if
we should never lose, yet might be taken from them not twenty or forty years
hence, but ere to morrow; and whether we shall leave them to our children, we
cannot tell, happily it may be to strangers, yea enemies; if to our children, we
know not how they will spend them. If some miserable men that have robbed God,
stolen from the poor, sold themselves to the Devil, had but leave to look out of
their graves a little, and see who dwells in their houses, and have got that
they left, it would increase their torment to see they were such fools:
Therefore to be excessively careful, is neither good for our selves nor our
children, we must follow our calling and be thrifty, and go as far as we may
lawfully, and no further: We must give our children good education; and if we
can do that by good means, all duties discharged, then there is great hope of
Gods blessing, and if they fear God, it shall be blessed, and that shall be
sufficient; and if they fear not God, the more we leave them, its the worse,
and the more hurt they will do: how happy would it have been for many a youth,
if he had been left at a trade hard at work, etc. he should not have run into
many sins that his abundance has led him into: If we leave them the poors
part, the Ministers part, etc. God will rifle in their pack, and have so many
quarrels against them, so that a little by lawful means gotten, shall do them
more good, then a great heap of Lambs grease, when the heat of Gods wrath
begins to beat upon it: A man's house cannot be established by iniquity. In all
these respects, let us take heed of distrustful and excessive care: O how
sweetly might a Christian live, if he would follow his Calling diligently and
thriftily, and go no further, but leave the rest to God: Thus might we be freed
from a world, nay, rather an Hell of cares that now distract us, and make us
unfit for good.

For he cares for you.] God cares for his own children.
A main Reason; we may spare all our care, any more then the lawful use of the
means; for why, if God care for us, we are well enough; He is infinite in
power, therefore nothing impossible to him, nothing can hinder him; He is
infinite in love and mercy, therefore ready enough to do us good; so in wisdom,
therefore knows what we need, and is good for us: Its not so with the children
of any earthly Parents, for they sometimes would care and do for them, and
cannot; some can, and will not; some both can and would if they knew, but
through distance of place, and such like lets, they know not their state.

Now that God does care for his, appears, for he chose us before the Foundation
of the world; In Adam He created us happy, and fully furnished us with all
things needful for us; In our own Creation, he gave us our shape in our mothers
womb, and kept us that we were not stifled: So in our birth, infancy, wanton
youth, and wild time, when we cared not for him nor our selves, he provided
for us, as ever since by his Spiritual goodness: He has provided us a
peaceable Land, Magistrates to rule us, Ministers to teach us, given us his Son
revealed in the Gospel: He chose us ere we were, therefore will not forsake us
being his; gave us his Son, therefore with him will give us all good things;
called us of his own free grace without our desire, and will he not fulfill his
good works, now we desire it above all things; he gave us life, therefore will
give us food and raiment for the preservation thereof: He gave us those without
our either care, help or pains, and will he not give us the lesser with our
pains? Matthew. 6. 26.
He feeds the fowls of the air, and clothes the Lillies of the field, and are
not we much better then they, Use 1.
and can use means more then they?

1. For so many of us as know God to be our God and Father, let us rest our
selves on this promise, and help our selves against this world of cares, which
through the want of faith does so much distract us: O the state of Gods
Children, is a safe happy state, if they knew it, which through faith they
might. Use 2.


2. For the world, no marvel though they ca^k and use all unlawful means,
seeing they have no Father to care for them, and are poor Orphans: If a poor
fatherless boy should run up and down, toil and moil, Simile.
and be careful to please every body, every one would say, Alas, its a
fatherless child, etc. but if a rich man's Son should so do, and whine and
drudge, and pilfer, geting into one bodies cupboard, and stealing a loaf, into
another cellar, and stealing drink, into another field, and stealing his
hedges, would not every one cry out on such a one, See Matthew. 6. 32.
and would it not be an horrible disgrace both to the Son and Father? So it is
with the godly and ungodly about these worldly things, etc.

Verse 8. Be sober, be vigilant, because your adversary the devil, as a roaring
Lion walking about, seeks whom he may devour.
HEre follow two other most necessary Exhortations, the one to sobriety, the
other to watchfulnes, and that from the danger that else we must needs fall
into, by reason of a most dangerous adversary that seeks by all subtilty and
diligence our destruction: fitly are these joined together, that before this;
for as a drunken man cannot hold open his eyes, so cannot an intemperate man in
these things keep a Spiritual watch.

Be sober,] What Sobriety is.
Sobriety is a moderation and right use of our lawful liberties which are given
us of God, not to be used as we will, but as may stand with these three main
ends, the glory of God, our own good, and the Salvation of our Brethren: Our
lawful liberties are meat, drink, apparel, recreation, mirth, use of marriage
and riches, all which may be reduced to these two heads; namely, Pleasure, and
Profit. But of this heretofore.

Be vigilant,] What watchfulness is here required.
He means not of the bodily sleep (that is not prohibited, so it be in fit time;
the night not the day, so it be in fit place; our Chambers, not the Church, in
fit measure to enable us the more for the duties of our Calling) but of the
sleep of the soul, for there be many that be awake in body, rising early, and
go late to bed, which yet are in a spiritual sleep in respect of their souls,
fast asleep in their sins, and lie snorting in deep security of sin. What
Spiritual watchfulness is.
Watchfulness is a diligent and continual looking to our selves, that both in
thought, word and deed we may resist evil, A man must be awakened before he can
watch.
and do the good we ought. This is the work only of a good Christian, who
being awakened out of his sins, has obtained the pardon of them, and assurance
thereof, and therefore has set his heart to lead a godly life, Ephesians. 5. 14.
and to please God in all things: Its requisite then that a man be awakened
before he can watch, as we bid not a man fast asleep look to this or that, but
first to wake, and then look to it; we bid not a man that is down, run, but
first to get up on his feet, and then run.

By nature we are asleep in sin, By nature we are asleep in sin, which is
diversely proved.
yea dead therein: For 1. As in the bodily sleep all the senses are bound up;
So in the Spiritual, a natural man hears not the voice of God, hears not the
alarms either of mercies or judgments: He sees not one step of the way to
Heaven, nor the danger he is in; Though he wallow in the mire of foul sins,
that a good man will stop his nose at, yet he smells nothing; he cannot taste
good and evil asunder, but calls sweet, sower: The Word, good Counsel, good
Company, etc. wherein Gods people take most delight, are bitter to him: Though
the word hit him never so hard blows, he feels not, as neither, though he wound
his own conscience with never so foul sins. And 2. As a man asleep loves not to
be awaked, so a natural man out of his sins, and to be called upon to repent.
3. As in sleep men dream of that they have not, so a natural man dreams he is
in a very good case, has faith, repentance, love, etc. when its nothing so,
and when he awakes he confesses it. 4. As a man in sleep speaks some good
words, but knows not what, and by and by is out; so a natural man in good
company will speak good words, but has no feeling of them, and will again be
quickly out of them. 5. As a man before he sleeps, gives direction that none
awake him, and turns from the one side to the other, sleeping now on the one,
then on the other; so a natural man will not be called upon to repentance,
having slept long enough on the one side in prodigality, will happily turn on the
other, and lie as long in covetousness. 6. As a man that has been in a long
deep sleep can hardly be awakened, though it thunder, though the winds be ready
to blow down the house he hears nothing; so its hard to awaken any out of sin,
especially when they have lain long, and lived therein, no Preaching or calling
on, no Judgments of God, though never so apparent, can awake them from their
security. 7. As sleep is an image of the first death, so is sleep in sin of the
second.

Therefore we must endeavor for faith, Use.
and set upon a good life, we must learn to watch and keep us well while we be
well: John 5. 25.
To this end, we must make use of the Trumpet of the Word daily sounding in our
ears, and take notice of Gods Judgments, both on our selves and others: What
may not induce us hereunto?

Reasons are many. Reasons for watchfulness.
1. We are of the day, and the light of the word shines in our faces: Its
enough for them in the night of Popery, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 5.
to sleep in sin; he is a sluggard indeed that sleeps, when the Sun shines his
face: Some of you have slept till nine Prove. 10. 5.
is the Son of confusion. This is the plentiful harvest of the Gospel: Now
there is good to be done, good gathering See Jonah 1. 5.
the house burning over their heads, or in an hideous Tempest, ready to be cast
away, but every natural man hangs as it were over the pit of Hell by a I would
have awaked with all my heart; we are called by Sermon after Sermon, by this
Preacher, that Preacher, the other, etc. to whom the Lord will say, Did not I
send you and you to awake such a man, etc. you are now come under the means of
awakening; O that it might please God to bless his Word, in piercing the ears
of your soul to this end: And be not half awaked, and afterward when you be
gone hence, fall asleep again; as a man in a deep sleep, being called upon, he
begins to stir, and lift up an eye, and it may be his head from his pillow, but
hearing no more, he lies down again, and falls again as fast asleep as before;
let it not be so with us. Some, I doubt not, begin to think with themselves
about awaking, and that it were good for them so to do; but beware when you be
gone hence, you lay not your head down again, but come and hear again and
again, till you be soundly awakened, that you may not hereafter sleep any more;
if you be not awaked, you must perish for ever. A man would be loath to dye in
his Natural sleep, having gone well to bed, and thinking of no such thing, yet
this cannot hurt a good man; but to dye in the Spiritual sleep is damnable. And
I beseech you young men and women be awakened betimes, defer no longer, the
longer the worse: Come to a man newly gone to bed, ye may easily awake him;
come an hour after, more hardly, but come at midnight, and then though you call
and shout, you can scarce awake him: Sleep not till your middle age, you can
hardly be awaked then, but if till your old age, with exceeding difficulty, if
at all. But of this also I have spoken before.

Because your adversary the Devil, as a roaring Lion, walks about, seeking
whom he may devour.] A Reason of the forementioned Exhortation: By yielding
thereto we shall take away advantage from the Devil, who else will draw us into
manifold temptations: He is here described by all things that make a dangerous
Enemy; as Malice, called therefore Our adversary, the Devil; Strength, called
therefore A Lion, A roaring Lion; Subtilty, That he walks about, seeks by
all ways and means, as by violence and craft to draw us into evil; Diligence,
That he walks about, etc.

His malice is exceeding against God, Satan's malice exceeding great.
and man especially, Gods people, and against all goodness: It has been so
from the beginning; from his fall he was filled with malice against God,
laboring by all means, that no reasonable creature might praise him on earth:
His envy also against mankind continues, he is still a most deadly enemy
against all goodness and means thereof, against good persons, good duties, good
meetings, the Word, Sacraments, Prayer, Fasting, etc. laboring to hinder these,
and the good success of them; as the good Angels are filled with love and zeal
to God and goodness, rejoicing at the conversion of a sinner; so is the Devil
on the contrary, yea, his malice is deadly, nothing will content him but our
blood, and destruction both of body and soul; therefore called Satan, An
Adversary, The Envyous man, The Accuser of the Brethren, A Murderer from the
beginning; and because there is no man so vile, but has some relics of
humanity in him, he is compared to the Beasts without reason, and so termed
here A roaring Lion, as elsewhere, A red Dragon, etc. he it is that first
tempts, and then accuses us to God, and ready to be the executioner: Let him
suck the blood of never so many, Rev. 12. 12.
yet is not his malice the more satisfied; he has been so from the beginning,
but now more by much, because his time is but short.

Strength: Satan's strength.
He was strong by Creation, which though it be diminished, yet continues it
exceeding great: He can do mavelous things, though no true miracles. Through
Gods permission he were able to do infinite mischief, see in Job, what havoc
he soon made; his names declare it, The strong armed man, A Lion, yea, A
roaring Lion, his strength being doubled with hunger, A great red Dragon,
Principalities, Powers, etc. Prince of this world, bearing a great sway, and
having many at his command; The God of this world, yea, that does almost what
he list, and who in respect of man's power to resist, has as it were an
Omnipotent strength to do what he list: And as he is wonderful in strength, so
he knows it well enough, and is audacious and bold to put it out to the
outmost; when he may (as to Job) he will set upon any the greatest and worthiest
servants of God, and sometimes foil them: He set upon David, a man according to
Gods own heart, and foiled him twice shamefully, and again got him to number
the people: He winnowed Peter that was so courageous, he buffered Paul that
valiant Champion; yea, he set upon our first Parents in their innocence, when
he had no great likelihood of prevailing; yea, upon our Savior Christ himself,
having no likelihood at all, and that again, and again, and again; and when he
had been so often foiled, yet he departed from him but for a season, who no
doubt was busy with him in his passion in the garden.

Subtilty: Satan's subtilty
He was made exceeding wise by Creation, which is not lost, but perverted and
turned to evil; much has been revealed to him, and wonderful much he has
gotten by his almost 6000 years experience, which would make a simple body
wise, yet he has not an absolute knowledge; He knows not our thoughts and
hearts perfectly, nor things to come, but he can guess very shrewdly and nearly
at them by signs, and comparing things past with present, as at our thoughts by
observing our speeches, actions and desires; So at future things, by knowing
and seeing further into the nature of things, and of men's bodies, then men can,
but he is exceeding cunning to do evil and compass his purpose; He was so at
first, much more now, therefore called, Matthew. 4. 3.
not a Tempter, but the Tempter, by way of excellency; he that has the Art and
Trade of Tempting, Rev. 12. 9.
that is the Master thereof, all others learning of him: So the old Serpent,
which was subtle at first, Genesis 3. 1, 3, 4, etc.
but now much more; How cunningly dealt he with Eve? 1. He goes to her, not to
Adam. 2. When she was alone. 3. Pretends great good will. 4. Takes away the
fear of all danger. 5. Tells her of great benefits which would come by eating
of the forbidden fruit, yea, such a benefit as she most desired, and was most
fit to tempt her, she wanted nothing but to be as God, etc. 6. He shows her the
beauty of the fruit, and how like it was to be good meat, and so perverted her:
So dealt he with our Savior Christ, when he had fasted forty days, Matthew. 4. 2.
and was alone in the wilderness, then he tempts him to trust; and not
prevailing therein, to presume; wherein failing, he propounds wealth and honor:
So now, he tempts some to be Atheists, and of no Religion; if not so, then to
be of a false Religion; if not so, then to be careless and idle professors of
the true; if not so, but that men will be somewhat careful, to read, hear, get
knowledge, be forward, then he labors to lift them up with pride, and blow them
out of the Church to Amsterdam, make them too forward, etc. yea, some he will
not leave there, but provoke them further, to be Anabaptists, nay Sebaptists,
as Mr. Smith, who Baptized himself: If he cannot tempt men to keep from Church,
then will he go with them, to hinder them from receiving any good there, and
there bring them asleep, if they be inclined that way; or if not, then fill
their heads with worldly thoughts; if not so, then he brings in good thoughts
of some good things, that at another time were good, but now out of season, as
thoughts of some other Sermon; so in Prayer, he fills the head with odd and
strange thoughts, or else with thoughts of the Sermon, to keep them from
lifting up their hearts wholly to God: If he cannot keep men in presumption,
but that they be troubled about their estate, then he seeks to drown them in
despair: Bad men he will incite to those evils they be most apt to; Civil men
he will keep in a coldness in Religion, and carelessness in the matters of
Salvation, as about the Word, Sacraments, Sabbath, Prayer; Good men he will
incite to do good things, but to ill ends, or if they propound good ends to
themselves, to compass them by unwarrantable means; Thus is he a cunning fisher
and fowler? He has baits and nets for all kinds, high and low, rich and poor,
learned and unlearned, men, women, young, old, he will spread them, and so lay
them, that he will not lightly miss: He has for every sex, age, constitution,
complexion, state and condition; he will make his shraps of profits, or
pleasures, or honors, and then get in some, especially of the fairest marks,
and set them up as a stall, and by both together tills in many.

Diligence.] Satan's Diligence.
He will spare for no pains, he rests neither night nor day, but goes about
continually; His occupation is to compass the Earth: If he prevail not at one
time, he will come again and again; yea, he will not leave a man as long as he
lives; and though there be such an infinite number alive at once in the world,
yet what with the multitude of Devils, and with their most exceeding diligence,
and unwearied pains, no man is free: So that he is armed on all sides to do
mischief: If he were malicious and had no power, we might despise him; if power
and no malice, or but a little, we might the less fear him; or if malice and
strength, yet if he had no wit nor cunning, there were much less danger, for he
were as a Giant without eyes, one might keep out of his hands; or if he were
all those, and yet were lazy, and could take no pains, we might be free most
what, but put altogether: O Lord, who shall escape him?

1. No marvel that most men go the broad way, Use 1.
and perish, and so few be saved, seeing there is such an enemy, and so armed,
and so followed, that has sworn all men's destruction; he so malicious, and we
so careless of our Salvation; he so strong, and we so weak; he so subtle, and
we so simple for our souls, and in Spiritual things; he so diligent, and we so
retchless and lazy in the great matters of our soul. Every man by nature loves
sin, and carries along with him as ready a disposition to yield to
temptations, as Satan is to tempt him: Marvel not that so few, but that any are
saved; and if thou have any hope and assurance, wonder and praise: If God were
not infinite in wisdom, power, love and care over us, we should certainly
perish.

2. See what wonderful need there is of diligent, Use 2.
continual, zealous, earnest and plain preaching of the Word; its that must
cast the strong man out: Acts 26. 18.
This is the mean to scale his walls, batter his Kingdom; were it not for this,
he would do what he list in the world, and carry all to destruction: Where this
is not, he may sit and sleep, for his work and will goes forward; What should
let? therefore its no marvel he is such an Enemy to it, and the Preachers
thereof. O what should become of Gods people already plucked out of his Kingdom,
if they had not the Word to show his subtilties, what is the will of God, what
good, what evil, how to do it, what be the advantages that Satan takes, and how
we may be able to resist them? Hence Gods servants are made wise, and
strengthened against his Temptations; they come weak to the Word, but go from
thence mightily strengthened: What do they then that seek the hinderance of the
faithful and zealous preaching of the Word, but gratify the Devil in an high
degree, and work journey-work to him in the best manner; its to learn the Devil
to have his will, to devour what souls, and as many as he lists.

3. We may wonder and praise God, Use 3.
that seeing there be so many Devils, and such as we have spoken of, that the
Church of God can be upon the face of the earth, that it is not rooted out and
swallowed up, the Devil having so many and such armed instruments in the world:
A wonder the Church has any abiding, but that God Almighty has a care of it,
and will defend and preserve it; Christ Jesus the Husband thereof, will not
suffer his Spouse to be trodden under: We may wonder we be yet a people under
this peace of the Gospel, there being so many Papists within and without the
Land; and such an infinite number of most subtle and malicious Jesuits, that
like the Devil, go up and down compassing the earth to work mischief: That poor
weak men and women in themselves, sinful and poor creatures, should yet be got
out of Satan's power, and then defended from his malice; not in body, goods and
name only, but from his deadly temptations, and to escape them, and get safe
to Heaven. O this is Gods Almighty power and goodness; so may every poor
Christian man say, and wonder.

4. This rebukes 1. Such as make a League with the Devil to obtain their
purposes; Use 4.
It was death by the Law of God, Exodus 22. 18.
and so ought to be still: What fools be these? They think the Devil serves
them, and is at their command, when indeed he has got them to serve him, and
that in an high degree of sin to their destruction. 2. Such as seek to such for
things lost, or for cure from them, for them and theirs: Those woeful Creatures,
seeking to the sworn Enemy of mankind for help, are like to speed, as if a
Lamb should run to a roaring Lion to be kept from harm. Simile.
Think they that he will do them any little pleasure outwardly, unless to
fasten deadly on their souls to work the ruin of them? His help is as the milk
which Jael presented unto Sisera. 3. All such as live in sin, and so serve the
Devil; These count him not a deadly Enemy, if they did, they would not be at
his beck, as the most part be; Though they stop their ears against God, their
Parents, Magistrates, Friends, yet they open them to all his temptations; no
Servant can serve his Master so diligently, as the world does the Devil, even
with all the might both of their bodies and minds, speaking, and writing, and
employing both their goods and pains on his behalf, and for sin, and that both
night and day: What he bids them do, they do, Lie, Swear, Curse, break the
Sabbath, Oppress, Cozen, Mock, etc. who yet (for that their humor likes it, and
its agreeable to their own mind) observe not Satan's policy herein, nor suspect
him for an Enemy: They will say, they hate the Devil as much as any, and defy
him; alas, he can give them leave so to do, as long as they serve him, and do
his works; This is as good as Popish holy Water, and crossing themselves. 4.
All civil persons that say they never found the Devil so troublesome as they
hear folks talk; They never doubted of their Salvation, were ready to make away
themselves, were never troubled with such wicked and blasphemous or troublesome
thoughts, were never so troubled but that they could go to Church, and serve
God quietly, etc. True, the Devil tempts them not to despair, because he has
them fast enough in pride and presumption: He tempts them not to foul sins,
because he sees God has restrained them, and so that there is no great
likelihood he shall prevail, neither cares he, seeing he has them fast enough
in the main; namely, in ignorance, unbelief, or carelessness of the first Table:
He troubles them not with thoughts it may be when they go to good duties,
because he knows they are likely not to do any good duty; yet he tempts them in
things, which through blindeness they discern not, as being none of the foulest
things as they think: Though in the hearing of the Word they have many wandering
by-thoughts, they feel not that the Devil is at their elbow, and at work with
them, because they make no account of such small things; also about worldly idle
speeches on the Sabbath, they see not Satan going along with them, because they
count them small, whereas a good Christian in these espies Satan, and is
troubled thereat: when the strong man has and holds his Possession, all things
are at peace, the Devil having these fast enough, he cares not for troubling
them; but let him be about to be cast out, and then I Will warrant you he will
bestir himself, and they shall have trouble. Let a civil man that lived never
so quietly before, be smitten in conscience for his sins, and begin to be
converted, he shall find his case altered, and that the Devil will do him all
the mischief he is able, and this is a great deal better then before; and men
should labor to be at enmity with him, and must pray that the stronger man,
even Christ, would put him out of his possession.

5. This should rowze up the servants of God out of security and intemperance:
Use 5.
Have they need to be drunk with the world, or be asleep, having such an Enemy?
ought they not rather to be sober, and continually to watch to save themselves
from his deadly enmity.

Against his malice let us have Christian resolution, and earnestness to seek
after salvation.

Against his power let us set the power of God, and be strong in his might,
craving his assistance continually, for we have no power of our selves; he that
should trust to himself, should speed as this our Apostle; we must always have
recourse to God, saying with David, God is my Castle, Psalm. 18. 2.
Rock, Tower of Defense, in him will I trust.

Against his subtilty, Col. 3. 16.
let us labor to be wise in the Word of God, read, hear, meditate, confer, that
it may dwell plentifully in our hearts in all wisdom, and labor for the wisdom
of the Spirit of God, that thereby we may spy Satan's subtilties, and be helped
to avoid them; and let us have the fear of God always in our hearts, and before
our eyes, which is true wisdom: Through this alone we avoid Satan's snares, and
are not ignorant of his wiles; who so Achitophel like, think by worldly policy
to resist the Devil, the Devil will make fools of them, and ensnare them at his
pleasure.

Against his diligence, let us be as diligent and watchful; we must not be
weary, or give over our watch at any time, if we do, we must prepare our
throats for destruction; Satan gives no truce. Not a few Christians have no
such fear of this enemy as they should, neither do they furnish themselves
against him as they should, but are careless, silly and negligent. Hereby it
comes to pass that the Devil has his will too much, and too often of us, and
catches us here and there; as to neglect one duty, to do another untowardly,
and to fall into this or that evil, and so makes us to dishonor God, to wound
our own consciences, and to give ill example to others: If we had a bodily
Enemy thus armed, how would we fear? If there were a great Lion in our fields,
and which did haunt our grounds, how afraid would we be? but there is a roaring
Lion, a red Dragon, an old Serpent, lies in wait for us, who may do us more
mischief then all the Lions, Dragons or Serpents in the world, and yet we are
careless. Here he is not thus fearfully described to discourage us, or make us
cast away all our weapons, as though there were no resisting, but to watch and
be careful; and then, though he be as he is, we may be preserved from his
anger; for though he be malicious, yet God is most merciful and careful for us:
Though he be strong, yet God is stronger: His power is limited, he cannot do
what he will to the godly (as to Job) nay, not to reprobates, as to Saul and
Ahab, the Devils had leave, before they could do their feats, nay, till they
had leave they could not enter into the Swine: And though he be so subtle, yet
the wisdom of God is far beyond his craft to catch him in it, as he has done
many a time; as in the fall of our first Parents, he thought the same should
have been to Gods utter dishonor, and that he should not have a Creature on
earth to serve him, which yet turned to Gods greater glory; the like might be
instanced about the death of Christ: So he can turn his temptations to nothing,
to folly, to our greater good: And though he be diligent, Psalm. 121. 4.
yet have we a God that keeps Israel, who neither slumbers nor sleeps. Rev.
5. 5.
The Devil is a Lion, but we have a Lion of the tribe Judah to fight against
him: He is strong, but God is stronger then all; they be innumerable, but God
is greater then all together; and to help our weakness, we have the good Angels
to take our part, more with us then be against us: He is a Spirit, but the
Spirit of God is in us more active, nimble and wise then he; we have no cause
therefore to be dismayed: Let us hold our Faith, Hope and Confidence, and go on
in a godly course, and in the end we shall get to Heaven. Praised be God,
praised be God alone: To God only be glory for this.

Verse 9. Whom resist steadfast in the Faith, knowing that the same afflictions
are accomplished in your Brethren that are in the world.
HEre are the means set down, whereby we must oppose the Devil; and through the
use of which we may prevail against him; namely, By being steadfast in the faith.

Whom resist] The course to be taken with an Adversary, Satan is to be resisted.
is either to make peace with him, to yield to him, to flee from him, or resist
him. To flee from Satan we cannot, from men we may; but not from him, as who
will be with us whithersoever we go: To yield to him we may not, then we spoil
all, that were to be his servants to our destruction; to make peace with him we
must not, for his malice is unquenchable, and he will still seek our
destruction, therefore we must resist him, and herein only is our safety.

1. We have a warrant and command for this. Reasons.
2. We promised so to do in our Baptism. 3. If we resist not, we can never come
into 1 Cor. 16. 13.
for none come there, Ephesians. 6. 10, 11.
but such as overcome, such as are conquerers, Iam. 4. 7.
who have palms in token of victory: See 2 Timothy 4. 8. James 1. 12. Rev. 2. 26.
and 3. 10. and 7. 14. 4. If we do not fight Romans 16. 20.
who has bruised and broke the Serpents head in it were a disgrace to him if
we should be overcome; nay, most certain it is, that no Soldier of Christ
Jesus, resisting by the armor of his appointing, can ever be finally or wholly
vanquished.

1. This rebukes all those that resist not Satan at all, Use 1.
or as they ought; as 1. The profane sort that live in sin; these resist not,
but rather serve the Devil: They resist God, his Word, the Spirit, good
Counsel, all the means which are used to draw them from their sins; but Satan's
temptations (as serving their humor) they resist not; this is the cause that
Hell is so full: If the Devil persuade them to any evil, they are as ready to
yield, as he to tempt. 2. Civil persons, they resist not the Devil, as
conceiving their case to be good enough, for that they are not (as they
conceive) so bad as others, though to neglect all duties in their families, and
toward their souls, and to pass the Sabbath in worldly talk, and to be little
at the Sacrament, or without any preparation, be frequent with them. 3.
Hypocrites, who though they resist him in some things, yet in others yield,
which is enough to their destruction. 4. Backsliders, that resisted him a
while, and seemed to be well minded, and to be sorry for time past, and were
fully purposed to take a new course, and seemed so to do for a time, that yet
afterward returned to their old vomit, and yielded to his will and temptations,
as they did before: This resisting was nothing, unless they had so continued to
the end, and until they had overcome; for not they that make a flourish, and
strike a few blows, and then fly or yield themselves to the Enemy, shall be
crowned: O let all such repent of their baseness, and yielding themselves into
the Devils hands, and to his temptations, as also of their breach of promise in
Baptism; and for the time to come, let them learn to know what is the will of
God, and which be Satan's temptations, and resist the same, and that constantly,
and in all things; so shall the second death have no power over them, but they
shall conquer here, and be crowned eternally hereafter.

2. This reproves weak Christians, Use 2.
yea, sometimes even them who have well profited, and yet will show themselves
weak in this, that if the Devil have any temptations against them, telling them
they be hypocrites, and that they shall not be pardoned, their sins being so
great, and their hearts to sinful, what do they but consent, and say as he
says, against themselves, and so yield; what a folly is this? Is not the Devil
adversary enough, but that you must also be an enemy to your selves? and do you
know its the Devil, who is a liar, and yet suffer your selves to be carried
away by him, and say as he says? a murderer, and yet yield to him? fie upon
it, you ought to resist, and have recourse to your friends for aid; even seek
unto God by prayer, search the promises laid down in the Word, listen to good
counsel, etc. yea, when a man has spent a good time in laboring to comfort
them by the Word, they yet are at the same stay, and yield more to a temptation
which is a lie, then to all that can be said against it; also, many and most
Christians, alas, how little do they resist? how often do they yield? If he
tempt them to lay aside prayer for trifles, or to keep them from the Word,
there being this or that to do, how quickly do they yield? Many also are so
filly, that they see not one of ten of Satan's temptations, and are so careless,
that they fear them not: Thus sometimes they omit good duties, sometimes mar
a good duty in the doing, are sometimes overcome in small things: What if they
be not great things? The least sins be against God, hurt our souls, hinder our
peace, make our comfort the less. If Satan come with some great thing, we fear,
and look about us, he would wound us at the heart; but would we be willing to
be hurt in the leg or arm? we must not yield at any time, in any thing, how
small soever, but manfully and constantly stand in opposition.

Steadfast in the faith,] Faith gives Satan the foil.
Faith is a principal piece of our Christian Armor; Ephesians. 6.
Gods Armor is Spiritual not Carnal, and though here one part be prescribed,
yet we must not content our selves therewith, But put on the whole armor of
God; for so we shall overcome: The Armor of Gods making shall prevail.

1. If none can resist nor overcome but they that have these weapons, Use 1.
What shall become of most, who have not so much as one of them, not Faith, nor
Hope, nor Righteousness, nor Truth, etc? They must needs be a prey to the Devil
as unarmed Creatures; They have been told of this Enemy, and that there was a
complete Armor of Proof, which they might have if they would take pains; they
neglecting the same, their condemnation will be of themselves.

2. It rebukes Christians that put on their Armor to halves, Use 2.
leaving off and neglecting this or that piece, and so are often overcome; we
must get it all, and buckle it well and close to us every morning, yea, never
lay off any part of it; we may do any thing in it, work, ride, lie down, sleep,
do any good, etc.

More particularly, Ephesians. 6.
faith is a principal piece of this Armor: Above all, 1 John 5.
put on the shield of faith, that will quench all the fiery darts of the wicked
one: This is also the Victory that overcomes the world, even our Faith: This
takes hold of the promises laid down in the Scriptures, of Providence,
Provision, Preservation, Salvation, and is found by experience to be a notable
means to resist all temptations in any kind, as worldliness, fearfulness, etc.

They then that are void of faith cannot resist the Devil, True faith rare.
and how rare is true faith among men? The world imagine that its easy to
believe, but Gods Servants find the contrary.

Steadfast,] What faith it is that prevails over Satan.
Its not a small or weak faith, but a strong and steadfast faith, that must
resist and overcome the Devils Temptations, especially great ones: Such
Christians then are to be blamed, which content themselves almost with a show
of faith; so that when they come to lie on their death beds, after long
profession, their hope is so faint, and their persuasion so weak, as that its
to be wondered at, who then might have been triumphing in assurance.

So in their lives, Use.
their faith is so weak, as that every temptation shakes them, Matthew. 14.
as the Disciples at a little Tempest: O that Christians can hold the hope of
their Salvation so slenderly, and have such poor evidence, when as they should
be able to prove it by many infallible Arguments.

Obj. But the least measure of true faith will save. Obj.


Answ. True, Sol.
but poorly. A weak tattered ship may come safe to Land, Simile.
but with how many dangers and fears, whereas a strong and well rigged Ship
comes with more assurance and content to the Passengers.

Knowing that the same affliction, All Gods children are liable to Satan's
temptations.
etc.] A Reason to persuade us to resist the Devil, and not to be discouraged,
because its not our case alone to be tempted and molested by Satan and his
Instruments, but of all the Servants of God every where: Satan spiteth not some
few, though he does them most, which most oppose him, but he hates and seeks
to mischief all the Servants of God whatsoever: As Pharaoh pursued not some few
of the Israelites, but all of them, to fetch them back again; so does the Devil
set himself against all the Israel of God: There Is enmity between the seed of
the Woman, and the seed of the Serpent; He set upon David, resisted Jeshua,
etc. tempts all, 2 Timothy 3. 12.
spares none: All that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall suffer
persecution: There Is none so tempted, but others have met with the like; Thus
will the Lord have all to be humbled, thus prove them, thus set their graces on
work, yea, thus increase grace in them.

We must therefore be the more comfortable, Use.
seeing we have so many, and such Companions, would we go to Heaven an easier
way then all the Servants of God have gone? we are well if we go the same
Sanctified way; And as we go in no harder way then others, so we must not look
to have a soft and fine way strewed out for us alone, this were too much
daintiness. True, it is the Devil that will persuade us, and we are ready to
think no bodies case like ours: O I have had such temptations. That there is no
God, that the Scriptures be false, innumerable blasphemous thoughts! so to
rebel against God, to hurt my self, etc. O be not discouraged, others of Gods
Servants have met with all these: So we are ready to think our pain, or cross,
or kind of life, to be more painful then any others, whereas it is nothing so;
and this the Devil persuades to, that we might conceive that God has picked us
out for his Enemies, and so might move us to distrust, and put us out of
comfort.

Are accomplished,] God enables his children to overcome Satan's temptations.
That is, both suffered and overcome by them. Hence note, That

God lays no temptation on his, but he enables them to overcome it; They have
no power of their own, but by his they are able to do all things; yea, even
such as our selves have gone through the fire it self.

This may encourage us to fight and resist manfully, Use.
for as others have overcome, so shall we, who do no more fight in our
strength, then they did; we have had many a temptation, that we feared
sometimes we should not have prevailed over, which yet through Gods goodness we
have now outgrown; So shall it be with the rest.

Obj. But seeing they knew this before, Obj.
why does he urge this as a Reason to comfort and hearten them, and not rather
some others which they knew not?

Answ. Because though they knew it, Sol.
yet they had not so the use of it, as to be heartened by it: Its one thing to
know a thing, another to be able to apply it, and make use of it, according to
our need: The common sort know many principles, and many truths, whereof yet
they make no use of their lives, and live as if they knew no such thing, whose
knowledge does but procure them the more stripes.

1. Its therefore the Ministers duty, Ministers must endeavor as to inform the
understanding, so to work on the affections of their people.
not to inform the understanding only, but to labor and work upon the dull
affections, and to bridle the unruly lusts of the heart, and bring them to
stoop: If people could make use and apply a thing as soon as they knew it, a
Ministers life would be more easy then it is; but the wisdom and skill is to
wind into the peoples hearts, and to work a love to that they know is good,
and an hatred to that that is evil.

2. People must not content themselves to know, People must join practice to
their knowledge.
but look they put in practice that they know: If ye know these things (says
our Savior) happy are ye if ye do them: O how many promises do Gods people
know, whereby yet they are not comforted.

In your brethren,] There Is a near conjunction between believers.
There Is a near conjunction between believers: They are fellow-brethren, of the
best brotherhood; God is their Father, the Church is their Mother, they are
begot of the same immortal Seed, nourished by the same food of the Word, Heirs
of the same Inheritance, are Members of the same Body.

1. This rebukes them that scoff, like Ishmael, at the term of Brethren or
Brotherhood, who yet can be content to have a Brotherhood between themselves in
swaggering, lewd companionship, etc. such scoff at the language of the most
High.

2. It teaches us to embrace each other with brotherly entire affections, Use
1.
and express them by brotherly actions; as good counsels, admonitions,
exhortations, prayer, example, rejoicing with them that do rejoice, and weeping
with them that weep, etc.

3. This rebukes not only the want of these (which is very common) but also
and especially the contentions and jars that are often between Christians: Use
2.
If Parents should have of their children some going together by the ears, and
that before the rest of their Brethren and Sisters, yea, before the servants
and strangers, how would it grieve them? so does it God, if we shall before his
face, and our Mother the Church, our fellow Brethren and Sisters, to their
grief, yea, before the Canaanites and Perizzites, who will laugh thereat: If, I
say, we shall thus contend and strive together, how monstrous is this? either
we must unchristian our selves and one another, or else we offer violence to
Christ's body, pulling one member from another, which he will not endure. What
if there be a sudden offense or falling out between any, is there not a time to
forget, to be reconciled, and to heal up all?

That are in the world,] Gods Church is dispersed throughout the world.
That is, dispersed here and there in the world. Hence note, That

God has his Church far and wide in many places. In former times indeed it was
hemmed within the compass of Jury; but since our Saviors time, its spread into
all Nations, though not into all at once: This in some Countries more visible,
in others less, because of persecution, wherein yet no doubt are Seven thousand
that never bowed their knee unto Baal.

We must therefore pray earnestly for all Gods people that be in other
Countries; Use.
they have as much need of prayers as we, and as many, yea, the same
temptations with us, yea, most of them far greater: They love the same God and
Jesus Christ that we do, are led by the same Spirit, look for the same glory,
have the same hearts to God, have the same Devil for their enemy; therefore
pray for them, for so we may do them good, though they be thousands of miles
from us, and love we them when we hear of them, for they be our Brethren.

In the world,] The Saints in Heaven are free from temptations.
As if he should have said, There are some of your Brethren indeed, that are
not under these temptations, namely, They that be out of the world, they which
be triumphing in Heaven: They rest from their labors, and are blessed: They
triumph with palms, are out of danger: No temptation, no trouble touches them,
but all that be in the world be in the same troubles.

1. Therefore whilst we are in this world, Use 1.
do not we look for any time of truce; we may be foiled in our old age, if we
look not to it, as many worthy men have been: We must not therefore lay away
our weapons, we may hap to have a sore combat on our deathbed.

2. Long to be with God, Use 2.
and so to be out of temptations, though not so earnestly, but that we be
content to tarry the Lords leisure, and work ere we look for wages, in the mean
time doing him the best service we can: Some offend in impatient haste, they
would be crowned ere they have fought up their fight; some again linger here
too much, not for the right ends (for we should be content, and desire for some
respects of Gods glory and others benefit, to tarry here still) but for worldly
respects, which we must carefully avoid.

Verse 10. But the God of all grace, who has called us into his eternal glory
by Christ Jesus after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect,
stablish, strengthen, settle you.
HEre follows the conclusion of the Epistle, in which the Apostle prays for
them whom he has taught, and desires an effectual blessing upon that he has
written to them: Thereafter he commends to them his Epistle, and lays down
the sum of it, next sends his salutations, then wishes them to love each
other, and testify the same, and lastly with a short prayer for them, takes
his leave of them.

In this Verse he prays for them, even that God would daily increase them in
all grace toward perfection, and at last perfect them, after the few
afflictions that he has here appointed them to go through; and in the mean
time, that he would confirm, strengthen and stablish them in knowledge,
obedience and faith, that they might not be removed nor shaken through their
troubles, from their good beginnings. Hereof also he renders some Reasons, 1.
Because he of whom he begs the same, is the God and Author of all grace; not of
every kind of grace only, but of every measure of grace. 2. He has already
showed them mercy, and bestowed grace on them, and called them out of the
world, and from their corrupt estate of blindeness, unbelief, impenitency, to
the knowledge, faith and obedience of the gospel, and of Jesus Christ,
therefore he will go on and finish his work: And in this 2d Reason are sundry
others couched; as that he has called them to his eternal glory, and therefore
will not leave them in the mid way; that he has called them in Christ, and
therefore that its firm and fast, and cannot be shaken; so that this is a most
excellent and sweet comfortable prayer, worthy to be remembered of us all, Note.
and laid up with us for ever. Herewith a couple of ancient good Christians
(that I knew, and who were as full of troubles, and as deeply tried as ever I
knew any) did wonderfully comfort themselves, and were so affected therewith,
as I never visited them (as I did often) either together, or when God sundred
them, but they had this in mind, and would utter it so feelingly, as they
declared themselves much sustained thereby.

From the coherence, in that the Apostle prays for the people, and for a
blessing on that he had taught them, note, That

Its the duty of Gods faithful Ministers, Gods Ministers must further their
peoples Salvation by all means.
to seek to advance and further the Salvation of Gods people by all means: Thus
must they do by Preaching, Example, Prayer, etc. Thus did Moses and Aaron,
Ezra, Number. 6. 24.
Jeremiah, the Apostles, etc. so ought we for the gathering of more to God, for
the edification of those that be won, for the comfort of the feeble, the
rowzing up of the drowsy, the reformation of what is amiss, the daily increase
of that that is good: This is no small forwarding of the work, of no small
avail with God: Thus shall we manifest our zeal to the glory of God, our
unfeigned and hearty love to the peoples souls, and this will be for our own
discharge, that we may have boldness and a good conscience.

Hereupon people must do for their Ministers, Use.
both for love to him, and to requite like for like, and for their own benefit,
for increase of knowlede in the Word of God, Wisdom, Zeal, Love, Patience, and
all graces that may tend to further the work of Salvation in them, the fruit
whereof shall redound to them; for according as the Minister is, much after are
the people, and for direction and assistance every time he is to preach to
them: This no doubt is much neglected on both hands; and the Ministry of the
Word must be followed with prayer, for the success thereof depends upon Gods
blessing, and therefore is to be obtained by hearty prayer: It depends not on
the Preacher, if he could speak with the tongue of men and Angels, he could not
of himself open the eyes or convert the soul: The Apostles had power to work
miracles, to heal the sick, cast out Devils, etc. but to convert the soul, 1
Cor. 3. 6.
that God reserved ever in his own hands: Paul may plant, and Apollos water,
but God gives the increase: The best Preacher in the world cannot with all his
skill, grace and pains, change the heart of his wife, sons, daughters, or
dearest friends. True, the Minister may help or hinder by the manner of his
preaching and living, as if he Preach ignorantly, confusedly, coldly, or mingle
unsavory and galling speeches, or live badly, he may hinder the likelihood of
good by the word; and if a Minister preach understandingly, orderly, feelingly,
zealously, and live thereafter, he provides the medicine the better, and more
fit to work, yet he cannot convert a soul; If we meet with any speeches
sounding that way, 1 Timothy 4. 16.
as to Timothy, Thou shall both save thy self and others, etc. we are to
understand them to be meant instrumentally: See also Acts 26. 18.
The work is the Lords, and above all created power, yet a greater work it is,
then the making of the world: Nor does it depend on any hearer, be he of what
wit, memory, dexterity, education soever, for even such have long lived under
the Ministry, and yet are as far from conversion as ever; we are by nature
blind, dead in sin, not only not apt to any good, but full of Rebellion: See
Deuteronomy. 29. 4. Jer. 24. 7. Acts 11. 21. and 16. 14. Therefore the success of the
Word depends on blessing, which is to be sought by humble and hearty Prayer,
the same being all in all.

Its a good sign in the Minister that he has a desire his Ministry should
prosper; when he is not content to Preach only, but follow it with Prayer.
Simile.
As women having set herbs or sown seeds in a dry ground, following them with
the watering Pot, have a mind they should grow; and as we sow not our seeds in
the field, but we ask Gods blessing thereon, so much more should we on this
precious seed: Thus shall it appear that they trust not in themselves, and that
they are desirous that their Preaching should not be in vain.

So ought the people; for the blessing of the Word, namely, the fruit of it is
all in all; what though we hear never so much, if the same be not made
effectual to us, the threats to humble us, the promises to comfort and quicken
us, the sins forbidden to bring us into an hatred of them, and love of the
contrary duties, and we be so altered by that we are: This is the end of all;
See Jonah 3. 5, 6, etc. Acts 2. 37. 1 Cor. 14. 25. Therefore they should, as
pray earnestly before that the Word may be made of force and efficacy; so
afterward must their minds run on the things delivered, and their Prayers in
their Families by themselves, relish of the same: But what neglect is there
this way? How few pray before, and how many after they have heard, suffer
worldly business or pleasures to put out the same? Oh! there is no such care
that this precious seed should take root and fructify; we complain of our bad
crops, but not of this, yet here there is not only a loss if it do not take
root, but it turns hurt; by to every Sermon a step ^igher Heaven or Hell: What
Crop can we show to God of all the Sermons we have heard? we crave Gods
blessing upon our bodily food, how much more ought we on this Spiritual?

The God of all grace,] God is the author and give^ of all grace.
He is so called of the effect, because he is the Author and Giver of all
grace; he is the Author of all that may be called good, which may be divided
into gifts and graces in this world; gifts of all kinds, as of body, mind,
etc. In him we live, he makes the Sun shine on us, etc. also gifts of health,
strength, beauty; so of the mind, See Exodus 31.
as natural virtues, also gifts to rule Kingdoms, as to Saul; so of Trades,
Arts, Sciences, nay, of gifts yet higher then those, knowledge, understanding
of the Scripture, Prophecy, Prayer; yea extraordinary too, as of miracles: So
is he also of graces, which are such as accompany Salvation, and he bestows
only on his Elect, as saving knowledge, Rom 15. 13. and 16. 20.
faith, peace of conscience, joy in the Holy Ghost, repentance, love, meekness,
patience, etc. 2 Cor. 1. 3.
Hence it is that sometimes he is termed the God of hope, sometimes the God of
peace, sometimes the God of all comfort, so here the God of all grace: He gives
every good gift and grace, and not that only, but every measure of every
grace, John 1. 16.
the beginning, continuing, and finishing grace: Whatsoever grace is in Saint
or Angel, Ephesians. 4. 7.
is the gift of God, either by Creation, as to the Angels and Adam, or sin by
restitution: What grace is in any man alive, of what kind or measure soever,
is only of God, for we are so far from having any of our selves, that we have
nothing but the quite contrary, even Opposition and Rebellion, none else ever
did, or can give grace: The best Parents cannot convey grace into their
Children by generation; nor can the best Minister into any by preaching or
counsel, God alone is the giver hereof.

1. Every one that has grace, Use 1.
in what measure soever, must be humble and thankful, acknowledging the same to
be only from God, and giving him the praise thereof: O be exceeding thankful
for it, that he has given it to thee, denying it to most; and to thee, as
unfit to receive grace, as the worst in the world, and who did no better
deserve it, then they that shall never have it; and especially be thankful for
it for the worth thereof, one dram of grace is of more worth then the whole
world, its the quintescence of Gods favor, and like Pearls of great value in a
little room. A true humble heart in the sight of thy misery, a little true
faith in Christ, and Sanctification, with an hatred of all sin, and care to
please God in all things, is worth a Kings Ransom, and an honest upright heart,
careful to be be ruled by that it knows, is better then all knowledge without
this.

2. Every one that is without it, Use 2.
must endeavor for it: Whether goes a woman with her pot or pail for water,
but to the Fountain? so must thou have recourse unto God; there is grace enough
in him, and he has it to bestow, and its his honor so to do: But how shall we
come by it, the Well is deep? God has opened the Fountain of his grace in
Christ Jesus, and conveys grace by the Conduits of the Word, Sacraments,
Prayer, etc. so that its not locked up in Heaven; would thou therefore have
thine heart humbled and broken, God can do the same, come to him, wait on him
in his word for it? would thou believe thy sins are pardoned through Christ?
would thou be changed, and have thy heart altered to hate every sin, to love
whatsoever is good? would thou have grace against thy strongest corruptions,
that thou could never master, and do duties to thy thinking impossible, as
to love thine Enemies, abide persecution for the Truth, etc? come to him in the
same word, and by prayer; he can do these things for thee: Why then is the
world so graceless, seeing there is abundance in God? Psalm. 4. 6.
Its because men see not their emptiness of grace, and know not the worth
thereof: They desire Health, Wealth, Honor, Pleasure, true grace they regard
not, prize not: O that men did see themselves woeful naked Creatures, without
grace! They would not then content themselves with any shadow of grace,
hearing, profession, a little restraint, some few gifts, etc. but labor indeed
for grace.

3. The Servants of God that have obtained some measure of grace already, Use 3.
should be provoked still to wait upon God for increase, for he gives all
grace, the last, as well as the first and the middle: According therefore to
our proceeding, let us beg fitting grace of God; Why, are there all kinds and
measures of grace in God, and we have so little? we beg not earnestly, we open
not our mouth wide, that God might fill it, we have not hunger-bitten hearts,
we prize not grace.

Who has called us,] Another Reason to persuade himself and them, that they
should obtain this request of being confirmed to the end, even because God had
already begun with them, and called them, that is, had pulled them out of the
state of ignorance, unbelief, impenitency, into the state of grace, knowledge,
repentance, etc.

Whom God means to save, Doctr.
he calls them out of their sinful state to grace; Whom God will save, those he
does effectually call.
There Is an outward calling, and there is an inward calling: This last, through
the operation of the Spirit going along with the outward means, is made
effectual, as to Lydia.

This stands in three things, enlightening the understanding to conceive,
opening the heart to believe, and changing the whole man from that it was
before; not only he calls them, but awakens them; not only invites them to
come, but gives them an heart to come: of this you may read Romans 8. 30. 1 Pet.
1. 15. This is proper to Gods children, and is the work of God, none else can
do it; without this there is no Salvation, as those that have this shall be
certainly saved, this being a mark of their Election past, 2 Pet 1. 10. and of
their glory to come, Romans 8. 30.

Let every man examine himself, Use.
whether he be effectually called (heretofore I have laid down the marks
hereof) if thou find thou art, then be of good comfort: Be thankful, for
that God has called thee, leaving others, there being no more worth or aptness
in thee then in them; and study how to walk worthy of this high and holy
calling, even in all zealous and godly conversation, not fashioning our selves
like unto the world, from which we be called, but differing as much in our
behavior, as we hope to do in our end, not defiling our selves with any evil,
not yielding to our lusts, not doing any thing unbeseeming our holy calling;
but as he is a holy God that has called us, and its an holy Gospel whereby we
are called, so we may be holy in all manner of conversation: Ephesians 1. 4.
This is the end, as of our Election and Redemption; Luke 1. 75.
so of our calling: Iam. 1. 18.
So that we must not serve God coldly, who has singled us out from the world,
but look we be singular persons, a peculiar people to him.

On the other side, if our hearts tell us, that we be not effectually called,
then is our case bad: Gods callings, which we have not obeyed, will be
accusations against us. O how few be truly called? most hold on in a profane
and bad course; others having reformed some things, and thereupon counted
themselves in a good estate, nay, given some good hopes, yet have after fallen
shamefully; some to the world, some to open profaneness, for there is no stay
of a man till he be effectually called: O then entreat God now to work on your
hearts, you know not whether you shall ever be called more or not: To day if ye
will hear his voice, harden not your hearts; listen to Gods voice, call upon
him to open thine eyes, and change thine heart. When thou come to the Word,
pray, O Lord, strike that stroke that may truly convert my Soul; yea, let all
Gods mercies, and thy several afflictions and crosses, be as so many voices
calling thee to God, count them so, and listen and yield to them; and though
heretofore thou have turned the deaf ear to God, yet now let it be so no more.

Into his eternal glory,] Such as are effectually called shall partake of glory.
The end why and whereunto they be called, even that they might have glory, not
vanishing, but eternal glory, so that it was not possible, but that they should
be saved: See 1 Thessalonians. 2. 12. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13, 14. 1 Pet. 1. 3.

1. He that is effectually called is an happy man, Use 1.
and of high dignity.

2. Let such walk worthy hereof, Use 2.
glorifying God with all their might.

3. It should when on others to listen to the voice of the Lords call: Use 3.
What shall they lose? they shall come from sin and shame, from wrath and
damnation, and shall be admitted into Gods favor, partake of grace here, and of
glory hereafter. No marvel people be so loath to yield, and we have so many
delays, and hard answers of them. Are they not shrewdly hurt to be called to
this estate?

Now in that the Apostle uses this as an Argument, that the Lord would
confirm, strengthen and stablish them, even for that he had called them, we may
note, that

Whom God has effectually called, God will not forsake them whom he has
called.
he will never forsake, but continue them to the end: His nature is
unchangeable, whom he loves once, he loves always to the end; we are indeed
apt to fall away daily, Romans 11. 29.
but Christ has prayed for us, 1 Thessalonians. 5. 23.
and our salvation is not now in our own keeping. John 17. 11.


By Christ Jesus] Christ is the way by which all good comes to us, All good
comes to us by Christ.
as our Election, so also our effectual calling.

1. Its therefore not from any merit of ours, Ephesians. 1. 4.
but for Christ's sake that we are called; Use 1.
we must not be proud of our selves, but thankful unto God through Christ.

2. This also may comfort us, Use 2.
we shall never fall, our calling has such a sure foundation.

After that ye have suffered a while,] He prays that God would make them
perfect, etc. but in the due time, even when they had passed the few
afflictions and trials he had appointed. Here note,

1. That we must go through troubles, Gods children must here suffer, before
they can partake of heaven.
ere we come to our perfection in Heaven. There Is a time for all things; a time
for Soldiers to fight, and a time for them to rest and enjoy the spoil after
victory: The cross is the Christians companion. Many are the troubles of the
Righteous, Psalm. 34.
and we must look for such in this world: It has been the Kings-road and High
way to Heaven, John 16. 33.
that sanctified way, Acts 14. 22.
wherein from Abel until this time, 2 Timothy 2. 12.
all Gods Worthies (the Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Reasons.
Christ himself, etc.) have walked: Neither is this without cause, for
afflictions serve to humble us for sins past, and fetch us from wandering (as
the Shepherds dogs does the sheep) whereof David had experience, Job 33. 17.
Psalm. 22. Isa. 27. 9.
and 119. They serve also to mortify our lusts, tame our pride, subdue and kill
our rebellious old man, helping us against it, which would else be too strong
for us; so to hold us in compass when we be well, as an hedge of thorns.
Children must be washed and made clean, Simil.
though they cry, so must we from our sins; and as they by mustard, or the
like, must be weaned from the dug, so must we by afflictions from the world,
which we love too well; and as as there were no rule with children without the
rod, so would we be unruly, were it not for afflictions: They also make us
heavenly minded, and hereby our Faith, Patience, and such other graces are
tried, as whether we have such or not, whether more or less then we thought;
yea, they serve to purify and increase that measure we have, for as standing
waters gather mud, and bodies without exercise wax unhealthful, so but for
afflictions we should be in a bad case. Hereby grace is made more active and
fruitful, as the vine is by pruning.

1. Therefore we must be content to go this way to heaven, Use 1.
and glad to: We must not think to have a new way strewed and paved, and
covered, as it were, with carpets, when as the other Worthies of the Lord have
waded to the ankles in blood.

2. How can they that give themselves to all jollity, Use 2.
and put away all hearts grief, and do wholly give themselves to profits,
pleasures, feasting, etc. How can these, I say, think they are going to
Heavenward? They will have their will here, whatsoever befall them hereafter.

3. If any should hereupon doubt that they are not in the way to Heaven, Use 3.
because they have no troubles, etc. What, have you no troubles? Are you not
troubled with a rebellious and sinful heart? and fight you not with
Principalities and Powers, and Temptations, that make you cry our sometimes, O
wretched man that I am, etc? and do you never meet with ill tongues for the
profession of the truth? you do: Then are not you without troubles, though it
may be you have not had so great troubles as some: Well, thank God, and use
prosperity well, and store your selves with grace against troubles come; It may
be God has spared you hithertil, because you are old vessels, too weak for new
wine, in time you shall be met with. Besides, all are not in trouble at once;
neither our whole life troubles, but God gives many breathings: Therefore
discourage not your selves, neither pray for troubles, God knows what is best,
we know not how fit we should be to bear them.

2. That the afflictions of Gods Children are but small; The afflictions of
Gods children are small.
They are so in respect of quantity and continuance, not so in respect of us,
or of our strength; for small ones would be too great for us, if God did not
assist us, and they be small in respect of that we have deserved Hell torments,
or the joys of Heaven we be called to. Alas, they are not a flea-biting that
any of Gods children endure here, Romans 8. 18.
to that they deserved, 2 Cor. 4. 17.
and the wicked shall suffer in Hell, nor to be compared to the least part of
the joys of Heaven. And for the continuance, our life is but short, a span
long, and in it we have many respices; See Psalm. 30. 5. Isaiah 17. 14. and 54.
What are sixty years to Eternity? as a drop of water to the whole Sea, as a
Mote in the Sun to a Mountain: Isa. 4. 5.
God moderates the afflictions of his Servants; if he deal with his Enemies he
lays it on, let them bear it if they can, if they cannot, Rev. 2. 10,
choose them, as Judas: The just time is set down for the godlies troubles; It
shall not be as we will, nor as the Devil and his Instruments will; If as we
would, then should they be so small, as we should be never the better; If as
they, we should be spoiled: God will rule the matter, it shall be neither too
much nor too little, but just enough for our best good.

We should praise God for his mercy and goodness, Use.
that respects our weakness thus, and has delivered us from the eternal
torments we had deserved, and turned them into a few merciful afflictions for
our good: If they press us any thing hard, then they are but short and small,
and laboring for a good measure of faith, they will be the smaller? They are
nothing to that we have deserved: Turn thine eyes downward to the torments of
Hell, then lift up thy thoughts to the joys of Heaven, these will make us
account them but small, and bear them quietly.

Make you perfect,] That is, lead you on daily toward perfection more and
more; perfect is taken in two senses in Scripture, for upright, that has
perfection of parts and absolute, which is perfect also in degrees and measure;
for parts, as a child new born, so is a Christian in his first conversion: 1
Cor. 3. 9.
Absolute none can be here, Phil. 3. 13.
aim at it and toward it they may, yet comparatively some are so called and
counted, Gods people must labor for perfection.
namely, they that have well profited in respect of novices.

We must labor to grow forward daily, and forgeting what we have attained, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 1.
run forward as they in a race: we must neither be so proud, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 3.
as to think we are perfect by and by (as some in their conversion do, not
knowing they are but babes) nor yet so lazy, as to content our selves with any
measure, how small soever, but join measure to measure (as a covetous man does
house to house) coveting Spiritual gifts, and growing in grace more and more;
what man is content if he have but from hand to mouth, and scant that to live
on, but desires rather a little elbow room, and to have a competency to live in
some good handsome fashion, and to have for himself and his friends, and
wherewith also to relieve the needy? and wiltst thou rest satisfied with any
measure of grace, especially having the means of growing?

1. This rebukes them that be grown worse: Use. 1.
O fearful! either they never began in truth, nor laid a good foundation, which
is most to be feared (whom therefore it now concerns to begin right and lay
sure, for better begin twice, then perish once) or if they did, then it much
concerns them to repent and amend, Rev. 2^ 5.
etc.

2. It rebukes such as stand at a stay, Use 2.
like an Apple Tree in a cold clay ground; that lives, and it may be every year
bears two or three shrunk Apples, but shoots not out her branches, nor bears
plenty of good fair fruit as we desire; what is the reason? when we see a Beast
in good Pasture, which has not cast the old coat, we say its surfeit, it must
have a drink; so are these surfeit with the love of the world, then which there
is no greater bane to godliness: Its like a great high Ashtree, that will
suffer no tender plant to grow thereby or thrive; another reason may be, for
that they compare themselves with them that have less, or nothing in them;
another, for that they neglect the means, or live under lean means, or they use
the means carelessly, What a shame is this? we might have with care attained a
far greater measure, so as our worst time might have been as good as our best
was wont, as it proves with thrifty persons, who through Gods blessing come to
have better fare any day, then they had at first on their best day: If a man
should have an Apprentice many years, and he be worse and worse, or learn
nothing, what would he say? were he likely to attain skill in his Trade? If God
should call most of us to an account, alas, we have but small skill in the
trade of Christianity.

3. It may comfort those that desire to grow forward and use the means
carefully, Use 3.
and mourn that they can do no better, and grow so poorly, surely they are like
to thrive apace.

Stablish, strengthen, settle you,] Here he prays for their perseverance. Hence
note, That

Its not enough for us to begin well, Christians must hold out to the end.
but we must hold out to the end; neither is this either less necessary, or
less difficult then the other.

Use all means diligently to this end, Use.
and pray earnestly to God, for we shall have many opposites: Confirm your
judgments in the truth, and keep you from Error; strengthen you in faith, that
you be not removed from your stedfastness and faith in Christ the rock;
stablish you in your good course and godly conversation: we shall meet with
subtle deceivers, that will seek to ensnare and withdraw us, as the Galatians
were misled, Gal. 3. 1.
and those mentioned Acts 8. 10. They of the Separation trouble many honest
people of a tender conscience, and in their first love, and yet have not
sufficient knowledge to try what they say, but come with a great color of
zeal: Its a great trouble to be distracted in mind, therefore use the means,
resort to those whose Ministry God has blessed to convert your souls: And is
not the Church and Gospel as well able, and as like to confirm you, as it has
been to beget you to the faith: Let us take heed of being removed from our
Faith, either in general or in particular; let us take heed of being shaken and
put from our good course, and drawn into evil through prosperity, or of being
choked by preferment, or daunted by affliction and persecution.

Q. If a man having begun in truth, do use the means carefully, may he be
assured of perseverance?

A. Some think that no man can have any such assurance, or hold out to the end,
considering what man is in himself, what the Devil, what the World, etc. but
though we be subject to fall away every hour, and if we should compare our
selves with the oppositions of our Spiritual Enemies, we might even utterly
despair, yet we are in a strong hand to be kept: Col. 3. 3.
Our life is hid with Christ in God, we are kept by the power of God through
faith unto Salvation: 1 Pet. 1. 5.
Those that are justified and sanctified, though of mean parts, yet are sure
and safe; The least measure of grace shall stand, when the greatest gifts
without grace shall fall away.

Verse 11. To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
HAving had occasion to speak of Gods mercy in Christ Jesus, Our Election and
vocation should move us to praise God.
he cannot but break out into praise and thanksgiving. Whence we may learn, That

Upon the consideration of our Election in Christ, Rev. 4. 8.
as also our effectual Calling, etc. we must at no time cease praising the
Lord; thus do the Saints and Angels in Heaven, and it will be our work there,
which therefore we should begin here: We must labor throughout our whole course
of life to glorify God, yea, seeing Dominion and Power belongs unto Christ,
herein is our comfort, herein the welfare of the Church of God, and every
particular Christian, Christ bears the sway, else woe were to us.

Verse 12. By Silvanus, a faithful Brother, unto you (as I suppose) I have
written briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God
wherein ye stand.
ANother part of the conclusion, namely, A commendation of his Epistle: 1. From
the Messenger he sends it by, Silvanus, whom he commends for a faithful
Christian and Minister, and one that loved them well, and was careful for them,
as he was persuaded, and saw cause to move him so to think. 2. He sets down the
sum of his Epistle, consisting of two parts: 1. His testifying by infallible
Arguments, That that was the true Religion and way of Salvation, which they
believed and yet stood in; though there were other false Religions, yet was
this the only true Religion. 2. His exhorting of them earnestly, not to suffer
themselves to be removed from the same by any means whatsoever; so that he
wrote not about trifles, but about the main, namely, To signify and prove to
them the true Religion, and to persuade them to constancy therein.

By Silvanus,] The Apostles had some to attend them, and assist them to write
and send to the Churches; not for pomp, but necessary use and furthering of the
work: This grew after to pomp and state under Popery; but pomp and state
beseems not the Ministers of the Gospel, howsoever, its meet that they should
have necessary furtherance.

He sends this Epistle by this Silvanus, whom he so highly commends, he picked
him out of purpose; for he would not commend such a jewel, a prime piece of the
Churches treasure, to every ordinary person; he also was fit to certify them
of the Apostles mind therein, and preach out of it to them.

Its meet holy things should be in the handling of holy persons: Holy things
should be handled by holy persons.
See 1 Timothy 3. Eli's sons made the people loath the Sacrifice of the Lord: Even
the meanest Officer in the Church is to be of some understanding, and of sober,
honest conversation, not a base person, Swearer, Drunkard, etc. its a loathsome
thing to see such, having any thing to do with Church-businesses.

A faithful Brother,] He was a good and faithful Christian, and a faithful
Brother in the Ministry, good both in his general and particular calling; the
one is the ground and trial of the other: He that is no good Christian, Note.
can be no good Magistrate, Minister, Householder, etc. and he that is no good
Magistrate, etc. is no good Christian: In that the Apostle gives him such a
good commendation,

1. It teaches every one of us to labor for a good name and report in the
Church of God, A good name is to be labored for.
as Job, Zachary and Elizabeth, Barnabas, Obadiah, See Heb. 11. 2.
with others had: This is better then good ointment, then much gold and silver:
Eccles. 7. 1.
What a blessing while we live, and after death a fragrant memory? Prove. 22. 1.


2. It rebukes those that live so badly, as the Church nor Charity it self
cannot speak well of them; as also such as live so doubtfully and suspiciously,
as in some things they give some hope, in others they dash it again, so that
there is none can give any full testimony of them: Such provide ill for
themselves.

Unto you] He was very loving and faithful to them, Such as are faithful in the
Ministry, draw their peoples hearts to them.
hereof the Apostle informs them, that they might esteem the more of him, and
profit the better by him: Such as are faithful in their Ministry, draw their
peoples hearts to them and their Ministry, whereby they receive much comfort,
as their people profit.

1. This rebukes the great unfaithfulness of numbers of Ministers, Use 1.
they have little care or conscience for their peoples good. But

2. If Ministers be loving and faithful to them, Use 2.
then ought they again to regard them much, lest else they discourage them in
their Ministry.

As I suppose] The Original word signifies more, as by casting mine accounts I
find, or by laying things together I can gather; yet not such a confident word
but kept within bounds, whatsoever might fall out. We ought to speak and think
so well of others as we have ground for.
Here note,

1. That we ought to think and speak as well of Ministers and others, as we
have cause, and as we have grounds to warrant us, not keeping from them their
due regard and commendation, much less speak evil of them that deserve well.

But herein great numbers fail, Use.
with whom one infirmity in their brethren, shall drown their many good graces;
yea, are ready to hear ill reports and believe them, though they be never so
uncertain or ungrounded.

2. That we ought to be wise and wary in our commendations: We ought to be wary
in our commendations.
Many have repented that they have so largely commended others, when as they
did not walk answerably; much hurt has come this way: We had need be wary,
except we have more then ordinary experience, for the heart of man is
deceitful, and many good beginnings to the eye, have not proved so well; yet if
any should not prove well, it can be no great disparagement to them that have
spoke well of them, so they have been moderate therein, for all the Apostles
were deceived in Judas, as Paul of Demas.

I have written] The Apostles great care of their good: Having entered them, he
would confirm them; and now, that he could not preach to them, he writes, which
would stick to them, and whereunto they might resort again and again at their
pleasure.

Hence I might speak of the profitableness of writing Epistles, The
profitableness of writing Epistles.
how much good Gods servants may do to each other being absent, by Prayers, by
Letters: How much good has been done by the Letters of the Fathers, and of
godly men in latter times, as of Calvin, Beza, the Martyrs, etc. who knows
not? what a fault is it that its no more used, as Parents to their Children
being absent, friends to friends, etc. whereas wanton Letters, and Letters
about worldly businesses are frequent enough.

Written] Thus God moved the hearts of his Servants, and assisted them
extraordinarily to pen the parts of holy Scripture: O what a a benefit it is
that we have the whole, and most holy Word of God written and before us, and
how should we in token of thankfulness be exercised therein? But most busy
their heads with other matters, namely, Their worldly profits and pleasures,
fools bables, in the mean time little using or regarding the Bible.

Briefly,] 1. Because he would have them the oftener in it, and take the more
delight to read it over. 2. Because he sent Silvanus to open and unfold it at
large, Heb. 13. 22.
by preaching out of it, and making application thereof for their good.

Here see how God in his infinite wisdom has provided us his Word, Gods wisdom
in providing for us his Word, and goodness in ordaining Ministers to rereveal
unto us his will therein.
wherein is all his mind, and that in few words, to provoke us to be exercised
therein; for if the Word had been written as large as we had need for our
understanding, the world could not have contained the books that must have been
written; but the Lord has revealed his will briefly, laid down much in few
words; yet for our further benefit, God has Ordained the Ministry of his
Word, and given gifts to men to preach it, expound it, apply it to every bodies
use, so that both together do most happily: How should God have provided better
for us? If therefore people profit not, their answer must be heavy.

Exhorting and testifying, etc.] These words afford sundry points; as

1. In that the Apostle testifies by sound Arguments that they were in the
right way, People must particularly know that the Religion they profess is the
truth of God.
note, that

Its needful for every one to know and be well assured of the Religion he
professes, that it is the truth of God, for there be many Religions, yet but
one truth, miss that and perish; we must not go by guess in our Religion: Its
not enough that we have the true Religion, except we know it to be so, that we
be not wavering, and carried about with every wind of contrary Doctrine.

1. This rebukes those that take occasion, Use 1.
because there be so many Religions, therefore they will meddle with none, but
take their ease, and tarry till all agree.

2. It rebukes those that profess a Religion, Use 2.
as all do, but know not whether it be truth or not, but believe as the Church
believes, as they be told, but have no ground from the Word for the same: Turks
may not, its death to question about their Religion; Papists may not,
especially the Laity, who are forbid to read the Bible, or any good Book that
way, but we may; yet how do the most in this Land profess the Gospel, which by
Gods goodness is the truth indeed? alas, how few know and are able to prove it?

3. As its our duty to testify and prove our Religion, Use 3.
to be the only true way of Salvation; so its yours to know and acknowledge
it, that if an Angel should come and inform you otherwise, you might not give
ear to him.

2. In that the Apostle thought it not enough to prove to them that that was
the true Religion they were in, Christians must persevere in the truth.
but exhorted them to continue constant in the same, note, that

They that know the truth, ought so highly to esteem it, and be so thankful to
God for it, Prove. 23. 23.
as they never suffer themselves to be removed therefrom, whether for hope of
gain, or fear of trouble, etc. we must buy the truth, not sell it. The Martyrs
would rather lose their lives then the truth; if we let that go, we lose our
Souls.

3. In that the Apostle takes such care and pains with those Jews that now
stood in the truth, to hold them therein, we may note, that

Its an hard matter for those to hold out steadfast, Constancy in well-doing
difficult.
that have begun to do well, for our heart is deceitful, the Devil is subtle
and strong, and there are also many Seducers, many baits, many discouragements,
etc.

What are they then that say, Use.
there is too much Preaching and Reading? They know nothing that belongs to true
Christianity. A little means may serve to keep men in a loose, carnal, and
profane course, but to keep us in a good course, there must be precept upon
precept, line upon line, etc. and all little enough.

Therefore Ministers ought to continue with all diligence, not only to gain
home more, but even to hold on and confirm them that be gained, that they fall
not away into error, sin and security, and people have also need to use all
good means to this end.

4. In that his Epistle consists in testifying by sound reasons, for the
confirmation of their judgments, and then of the Exhortation for the whetting
on of their affections; Note, That

Both parts are necessary in Preaching, Doctrine and Application must go
together.
the one still to accompany the other.

1. Ministers therefore must labor in and for both.

2. People must make use and account of both, Use. 1.
regard Doctrine for knowledge, Use 2.
and suffer Exhortation for practice: Some cannot endure Application and
Exhortation, but are all for knowledge and to feed the understanding, and it
appears in their lives, for they cannot endure, but to live at elbow-room, as
they list, notwithstanding the profession some make in hearing Sermons.

Verse 13. The Church that is at Babylon elected together with you, saluteth
you, and so does Marcus my son.
ANother part of the conclusion, consisting of Salutations from the whole
company of the faithful with him, and particularly from Mark.

The Church] The company of the faithful that were at Babylon, knowing of our
Apostles writing to these his dispersed Brethren, entreat to be remembered to
them, and pray the Apostle (for he would not send their commendations without
their knowledge) that he would signify to them, Christians must be mindful one
of another, how far distant soever.
that they remembered them, loved and reverenced them, and were glad of them,
praying to God for them, etc.

Gods people though far distant one from another, yet must be mindeful one of
another.

Which is at Babylon,] God has some even in the worst places.
Namely, a City of Assyria, whither the Jews were carried Captive by
Nebuchadnezzar, and there abode for Seventy years: There were here now sundry
believing Jews, as God has his Church in the worst places, where Satan's Throne
is, and though most of the Jews rejected Christ, yet some here and in other
Cities embraced him.

The Papists will needs have this meant of Rome, This place not meant of Rome
but upon what ground they know not; there can be no reason rendered why Peter
should hide the name or dissemble it: But this is that they might get some
place of Scripture proving Peter to have been at Rome, but if they can get no
plainer then this, the Pope may sit besides his Chair: They have no place to
prove it by, See Dr. Willets Synops.
and yet they say, he sat there as Bishop five and twenty years, which that it
was not, the Learned have proved by diverse Reasons.

But thus the Pope comes by his Supremacy, Peter had it, and he left it to his
Successors, the Bishops of Rome: But neither had Peter any such Supremacy, or
if he had, it was not tied to place, but to Truth and Religion; now the Popes
is clean contrary to Peter's, hating and persecuting the same.

But where by Babylon, Rome indeed is meant, as Rev. 14. 17, 18. (so called
mystically for the likeness to Babylon in Idolatry, and vexing the Church and
Servants of God) that they cannot away therewith; See Dent on this Question.

Thus Heretics wrest Scripture at their will to their own purpose; Heretics
wrest Scripture.
where it may make for them, though it have no such meaning, it shall yet be
used; where its against them, though it be never so plain, yet it may not be
allowed: This is a vile taking of Gods name in vain, and it will be to their
own destruction.

1. Therefore we must not believe that is confirmed by Scripture of their or
any Heretics alleging, Use 1.
but try their allegations.

2. That we never dare to bring a sense of our own to the Scripture, Use 2.
but fetch the sense thereof out of the Scripture by humble and diligent search.

Elect together with you,] A Church chosen of God (as you are) out of the world
to bestow his Gospel upon, and reveal his truth unto: Election is taken largely
or strictly; Election diversely taken.
Largely, for choosing a People or Nation out of the world to bestow his favors
upon, and make Covenant with, Isaiah 44. 1.
as Israel from all other Nations: You only have I chosen: So to choose to an
Office, John 6. 70.
as our Savior Christ says, I have chosen you twelve, and one of you is a
Devil: Strictly, for the Election of any to Salvation before the world; When
God chooses out a Church, and bestows his mercy upon it, though no doubt
there be numbers of Gods Elect in it, as in the Church of England, yet many may
be Reprobates, especially in such a Church where Religion is enjoined by
authority: in such a company as this of the Jews where they were voluntary,
there was likelihood of the more, and yet even among such were Hypocrites, that
voluntarily joined themselves to the Church, as Ananias and Sapphira.

1. Know we that its a great mercy to live in an Elect Church, Its not enough
to live in an elect Church, but we must find that we are Elect.
as the Church of England is, when most of the world sit in darkness, and be
Synagogues of Satan.

2. Yet must not we content our selves herewith, but be able to prove our own
particular Election, which is an unspeakable favor, and for which we ought to
be exceedingly thankful.

Now in that the Apostle calls them an Elect company, Why the Apostle calls
them an Elect company.
it was because he knew there was a number of Gods chosen among them, as he saw
by their fruits; but who they were particularly, and who were not, that he
could not justly tell, because its unknown what the heart of the one is, and
what God may do in time for the other.

We must not take upon us precisely to determine of other men's Election or
Reprobation, Use.
but judge modestly and charitable, thanking God for being sure of our own, and
laboring more and more for assurance herein.

Saluteth you*] wishes all good unto you: What, would the Apostle trouble
himself or his Epistle with such a trifling matter, as sending of
commendations? Its no idle or small matter, but of very good use; So that as it
has been an ancient custom in the Church of God, so being Christianly
performed its worthily continued, and is of great use. The sending of
commendations how useful it is.
For 1. It testifies to our selves that we are of the number of Gods faithful
ones, that we not only love the brethren with us, but even those which are
absent, yea, not only no kindred, but not known by face, only heard of, that
we so love God, that we love his grace wheresoever. 2. Its no small
encouragement to the Servants of God that be thus saluted, against the many
unkindnesses, yea, hatred they meet with from the world, that yet they see
themselves regarded, loved and prayed for of Gods people.

1. This should provoke us to perform this Christian duty to the Servants of
God, Use 1.
for our own discharge, and both their and our comfort; we must not be all to
our selves, nor to those we be with, but even have our hearts with the Church
of God elsewhere, rejoicing to hear of the free passage of the Gospel, the zeal
of any embracing it, and that we help them forward the best we can.

2. If we have salutations sent us by any of Gods Servants, Use 2.
we should make special account thereof, and be much comforted thereby, and set
the same against all the scoffs, ill will, and hard measure that the world
affords; and if we be in any heaviness, that we stir up our selves and be
thankful to God, that we are remembered of him and his Servants, and make more
account of commendations from a mean Christian, then from a great Knight or
Noble man that's not in Christ.

3. They that are Messengers hereof, Use 3.
must not forget nor deal carelessly herein; even civil and courteous
Salutations only of friends or kindred each to other, are of use and not to be
omitted, but much more such as those here, who knows how seasonably they may
come? what good they may do? what heaviness they may remove? They must not
count so lightly of them being sent, as to forget them, or let them (as they
say) fly away by the way, but as a token wherewith they were entrusted, and
which it were no honesty to keep back.

Marcus my son,] Acts 15. 37. 38.
Its like its that Mark spoken of Col. 4. 10. who was Cozen to Barnabas, about
whom there was a breach between Paul and Barnabas: He calls him his Son, not in
the flesh, but in the faith, as having begotten him thereto by his Ministry,
as the Apostle Paul uses the same word on the same ground: See Tit. 1. 4. 1.
Tim. 1. 2. 1 Cor. 4. 14. Philem. v. 10. Here note, that

The Preaching of the Word is the instrument of Regeneration to beget men again
to God. The preaching of the Word is the instrument of Regeneration.


1. This rebukes those that disgrace, either simply, or under color of
magnifying, praying and reading; so also those that withdraw themselves from
this, Use 1.
and staying at home, say, They read good Books, Simile.
etc. They do as the Israelites, who having Manna allowed them by God, which
should have been unto them in stead of all the food in the world, yet would
have Quails, but they had leanness sent into their soul, and so have these;
either they get no knowledge, or if any, only a little swiming in the brain,
but not sinking down into the soul, to the changing thereof.

2. It teaches all Ministers so to preach the Word, Use 2.
as by all means possible they may win some; what should our desire be, but so
to do, whether we consider the love we owe to God or to our people, and that
their salvation will be our crown? To this end we must preach those points most
diligently and carefully, that be most effentially necessary to work
conversion; we must beat upon men's misery, labor to bring them to Faith and
Sanctification, etc. without these all other points will be unprofitable:
Unpreaching Ministers have no possibility of winning souls.

3. People should so hear the Word, Use 3.
as they labor and pray it may be powerful by the Spirit to their conversion
and new birth; they must have a Spiritual Father, as well as a Natural Father;
must be born again ere they dye, else happy had they been if they had never had
their first birth; lets try our selves herein: Its not hearing the Word, yea,
with joy, and reforming some things that is Regeneration; its not to be
restrained from the gross evils of the world, or to be somewhat changed in some
things; alas, Regeneration is another matter then that, wherein many deceive
themselves and perish, knowing no more what is Regeneration, then Nicodemus
when he first came unto Christ, nor laboring after it to find it, with the
fruits and signs thereof.

My Son] He calls him so also of tender love, Ministers must love their people
as their Children.
as Paul One simus, his own bowels. Here note, That

The Ministers of God ought exceedingly to love all Gods people, but chiefly
such as have been won to God by their means: They must cherish and further such
all they can, as the Hen when she has hatched her Chickens, broods and tends
them; and as the Mother after she has brought forth her child, is careful to
keep it from harm. and to provide all necessaries for it; they must watch over
them, preach to them, pray for them, not depart from them, but in the case of
absolute necessity; as the Apostles having won any to God, would come again to
them, exhorting them to continue in the grace of God, confirming their hearts,
etc. so must we; they be our comfort and joy here, and crown hereafter; our
Epistles of commendation, the seals of our Ministry, they that make us rejoice
and give thanks, therefore we are much beholding to them, and must love them
most dearly, and desire the work begun may be happily perfected, knowing, its
no less wisdom and thrift to hold that we have gotten, then to get more.

Accordingly must the Spiritual Children love their Spiritual Fathers dearly:
So people their Ministers.
They ought to love all Instructers; but as Children their Parents, so they
them best by whom they have been begotten to God: They ought to give them
double honor, to reverence them, and not to suffer them want necessary
comforts: In doubtful cases of Conscience, they must resort to them for
counsel, as Children to their Father: They must obey all their godly precepts,
endure their severity, be guided by all their godly directions, receive no
accusation against them under two or three witnesses, etc. A child will not
hear, much less believe any evil reports of his Father.

For those people that set light by their Ministers, Use.
can suffer them to want, fall out with them (if he be gone, we shall have one
as good as he, etc.) its questionable whether ever they were converted by their
Ministry; for we see by experience, that such as are converted, their hearts
be so knit to their Spiritual Father, that they think best of his counsel,
praise God for him, as the instrument of their conversion, love him dearly,
etc. we love the fathers of our bodies, and ought so to do, and yet they help
us to a being in sin, and into a sinful world and state, and should we not love
our Spiritual Fathers, through whom we are changed therefrom? The Separatists
therefore are either unconverted persons (as I doubt not but sundry are) or
else they be most unnatural and unthankful persons, in railing against all the
Ministers of England, and so against their own Spiritual Fathers; They spi: on
their faces, and call their Mother Whore: O most wretched requital!

Verse 14. Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all
that are in Christ Jesus, Amen.
THe last part of the conclusion, consisting 1. Of an Exhortation to embrace
each other with love, and to testify the same by outward signs. 2. Of a Prayer
for them, that all that be true Believers in Christ Jesus, might have all
prosperity and welfare; to which he joins the note of his faith and fervency,
Amen. So concluding his Epistle with all signs of love.

In general; That he contents not himself that he loved them, but labors to
further love among them; Its needful that where love is, it should be continued.
we may note how needful this duty is; where love is, we must endeavor the
continuance and increase thereof; where its crazy, we must use means to heal
it, Blessed be the peace makers; Its a sign they are endued with the wisdom
which is from above: All our words should tend to make love, the Devils
Colecarriers and Bellows that blow up strife, rejoice in folks contentions, and
further increase the same: A woeful office; who gets hereby but the Devil,
except the Lawyers hap to get too.

Greet one another,] Christians should salute one another.
To Salute each other has been an ancient custom in the Church of God, whereof
you may find the forms, Judge. 6. 12. Ruth 2. 4. Psalm. 129. 8. Luke 1. 28. and
10. 5. John 20. 19. and elsewhere: Ours also are commendable, when we meet any,
we say, God save you; when any goes from us, God be with you, or Fare you well;
in the morning, we say, God give you a good morning; in the afternoon, God give
you a good night; when any is at meat, we pray God that much good it may do
them; when one goes a journey, we say, God speed you in your journey; when at
work, God speed your work; when one is come newly to an office, God give you
joy of your office, etc. These ought we to use as occasion serves, both to our
Superiors more reverently, by the Titles that are due to them, of worship,
honor, etc. our equals with good respect, and somewhat familiarly, as we look
they should to us, and to our inferiors, that they may not think themselves
despised, and so be discontent with their place, and with God; and its a base
thing to tread under ones inferiors: Thus we must salute not our friends only,
but strangers, but our enemies; Even blessing them that curse us, and praying
for them persecute us: Else we shall be but like the Publicans, who salute
those that salute them; so we must salute not only good men (though those most
respectively) but even the bad, for we must have peace with them, though not
with their faults, and give them their due, though if we have occasion to speak
of their sins, we must deal plainly, except we know them to be Gods Enemies,
then ought we to give them no countenance.

Reasons hereof may be these: Reasons.
1. Its a good testifying of our love, which we should do upon all occasions.
2. Its a part of urbanity and courtesy. 3. Its a good means to procure love
from them whom we do salute; 2 Samuel 15. 6.
so did Absalom, etc. 4. The neglect hereof, as it cannot but bewray some
defect in us, so it breeds suspicions, and thoughts of emulation in our
neighbors, and works in them no small discontent, for our nature can abide
nothing less, then to see our selves despised.

1. This rebukes not so much those that of rudeness, Use 1.
or for want of good manners, go by and regard no Salutations, seeming so to
mind their businesses, as they regard none but themselves; but those that of a
profane mind neglect it, especially toward those whom they think not to be
of their disposition, as some profane rude wretches, that will come by a
Minister or godly Christian after a scornful manner, without showing any
courtesy; This being done in respect of their Religion, is abominable and
vile, and a very bad sign.

2. Such as of pride; Use 2.
If they have a little more wealth or gay clothes, or any gift more then
another, they are so puffed up; that they pass by others scornfully or carelessly:
What is one worm to lift up himself thus against one that is his own flesh,
that it may be is as good or better then himself? The more God has given any,
the more humble they should be.

3. Such as of frowardness, Use 3.
malice and old hatred, cannot speak at meeting, are tongue-tyed; They have a
tongue, but the malice of their heart takes away the use of it; They look like
Tigers on each other, and would as readily kill them, if they could as safely
and easily; This is seen to God, 1 John 3. 15.
before whom he that hates his brother is a manslayer.

4. Let us labor to purge our hearts hereof, Use 4.
that we may give every one his due.

With a kiss of charity,] The ancient manner of saluting among the Jews.
The manner of saluting among the Jews, was by kissing; Thus did Jacob and Esau
at their meeting, Laban and his Children at their parting, so Joseph and his
Brethren, Jonathan and David, etc. we find it also practiced in the new
Testament; See Luke 7. 45. and Acts 20. 37. It was a Custom in some Churches
before the Communion, to kiss each other, signifying the joining of hearts;
this we retain in part: But men Salute by uncovering, and shaking hands, the
joining of our hands signifying the joining of our hearts; This was the use
till courtly Congeys and Crouchings have put them by, taking one another by the
knees and by the elbows, etc.

Of charity,] Our Saluting one another must be in love.
But be the Salutation what it will, kiss or shaking hands, or uncovering head,
it must be of love, and thence proceeds; for as we must not be content to have
love in our heart, except we show it by outward signs; so must all outward
tokens proceed from love as the ground and root, else its lying diffimulation.

Those kisses they are elsewhere termed holy; Romans 16. 16.
not a wanton kiss, not a dissembling kiss, much less a treacherous kiss, but
such a one as proceeds from a Sanctified affection of love seated in the heart.

1. This rebukes the customary and formal saluting which wants this ground;
Use. 1.
Many do thus greet one another, who yet have but small love to the parties
they salute: This is a taking of Gods name in vain, its a dissembling with our
neighbors, Romans 12.
whereas love should be unfeigned without dissimulation.

2. Treacherous courtesies and greetings, when there are fair speeches, How do
you? I am glad to see you well, etc. when mischief is in the heart, Psalm. 28. 3.
as did Joab and Judas; Thus the Devil pretended love to Eve, this is the note
of a wicked man: Many after kind salutations, will straight rail, gibe,
slander, plot mischief, etc. Those should rather make known their malice, that
others might beware of them, then cloak their mischief with the show of love.

3. Let every one of us labor to possess our hearts of true love, Use 3.
that so we may not only salute one another, but in a right manner do the same:
O let us labor for this most lovely virtue of love, so often commanded of us,
so highly commended to us; Its the bond of perfectness that ties up all
together, Col. 3. 14.
without which all duties shatter asunder; Romans 13. 10.
Its the fulfilling of the whole Law; Its that virtue which is so pleasing to
God, that which so long continues, that wherein the Angels and Saints now
shine.

To this end, Hindrances of love.
let us labor to be more and more assured of Gods love to us, which will make
us not only to love him, but our neighbors for his sake, the godly best, but
all because God bids, yea our Enemies, as who loved us when we were Enemies; we
must also strive Romans 1* 31.
be pacified, forgive and forget as we are required, and expect forgiveness
from God: O an unappeasable mind is a fearful thing, a note of a Reprobate!
Such are unlike God, who is slow to wrath, ready to forgive; like the Devil,
who is irreconcilable: O woeful, a poor mortal man to bear immortal hatred! How
can he look God in the face? little does he think what fearful things he has
done against God; did he, he would think how ever he could look up to God for
pardon of 10000 Talents, See Matthew. 18. 28.
when he catches and holds his neighbor by the throat for 300 pence, nay, it
may be if it be truly examined, for nothing.

Peace be with you all, What meant by peace.
etc.] Now he prays for them; by Peace is usually meant outward prosperity, as
health, convenience of outward things, welfare of our selves and ours, freedom
from grievous evils, and a quiet estate and condition in the comfortable
enjoying of Gods blessings, in our bodies, wives, children, goods, names, etc.
also that which is the fountain hereof; namely, peace with God and our own
conscience: But I will speak here first of outward blessings: Where note, That

We may lawfully desire for our selves and ours, Outward blessings may lawfully
be desired, and how.
or any other, a convenient portion of Gods outward favors; so did both Jacob
and Agur. True, we have no warrant to pray for abundance, that were a sign of a
proud and earthly heart; but if God send it, we must crave much grace
therewith, lest we surfeit thereof, and it make us like a Camel over-burthened,
that we cannot go: So we may crave Peace in a Land, See Psalm. 1. 3. and 112. 3.
and 128. 3. and 84. 11.
in Towns, in Families, between particular persons; so health, a dutiful
fruitful Wife, religious and obedient Children, etc. These things are promised
of God, neither will he withhold any good thing from them that love him, Matthew.
6. 33.
and therefore we may pray for them: But, because they be good but in a mean
degree, we must desire grace first more and more earnestly, these things only
conditionally, we must seek his favor, forgiveness of our sins, faith, grace,
absolutely without taking; nay, for the outward, we must submit our wills to
his will, and desire them only so far, as may stand with his glory and our
best good; for God sees, that though these blessings be goodly things, over
the contrary, yet we abuse them, and are the worse for them, and therefore God
is fain to take them away, and send the contrary; as see what an abundance of
iniquity this our long peace and plenty has bred, so that though we may not
pray as Elias did, for a punishment on the Land, yet surely we might rather be
glad, if God would scourge the Land one way or other to the amendment thereof,
then that it should thus go on to be destroyed; and for our selves, how do we
abuse our prosperity, if it do but continue some small time? we must therefore
pray for that which may stand with our best good, and for grace to use it well,
we shall enjoy it the longer; we must be content for our selves, rather to have
an healthful soul in a sick body, then in an healthful body a surfeited soul
with sin and security; so a meaner Estate with some losses, but with Spiritual
gains in grace, is better then abundance with a worldly and secure heart; so
for our Children, we may desire that they may prosper in this world, and have a
competency, and live to do good, but must desire most that they may be
gracious, and rather so in a poor estate, then to swagger it out, or be
worldings in great wealth: Its found true from experience, that such as be
earnest and much in desiring these outward things, they seldom or never crave
Gods favor, or seek grace for their souls; If we be shortened in these things,
look we cause it not by our sin; If we have, we must repent and amend; If we
have not, then may we think that the Lord knows this state to be best for us,
and thereupon to be content therewith.

That are in Christ Jesus,] Christ is the fountain of all peace.
Here Is the true fountain of all Peace, namely, to be in Christ; Hence all
Peace comes to us, and without this, there is nor can be no true Peace: By
nature we are the Children of wrath, are at enmity with God, are Rebels and
Traitors, and guilty of eternal condemnation, so that there must be a peace
made between God and us, else we perish: This is only done by Jesus Christ,
who is our Peacemaker, who by his All-sufficient Sacrifice of himself, has
made an atonement; when our sins is taken away in his death, and his
righteousness imputed unto us by faith, then is God at peace with us, and
become our merciful Father: when we be assured hereof by Gods Spirit, and able
to prove it by good Testimonies, then have we peace in our own consciences,
even such as passes understanding, yea joy, and that unspeakable and glorious:
Then, Hosea 2. 18.
being at peace with God, all Creatures be reconciled to us, the Angels to
become our friends and attendants, the Devils not to have their wills of us,
men to respect and regard us, etc. and thus have we right to all outward peace
and prosperity, for Christ has purchased, as Heaven, so Earth for us, and its
promised to the believers, and they have right thereto, though with exception
of the cross, when God sees it best.

Thus we see how peace flows from Christ; no peace in conscience till God be at
peace with us; no Creature at peace with us, till God be reconciled, yea,
without this peace, we have no right to any outward peace; so that a bad man
can have no peace.

Obj. But the common sort of men, Obj.
profane worldlings, and civil ones, will say, We are none of those you think
very well of, for we are none of your precise fellows, yet we have peace with
God we doubt not, nor see we any other cause, and if he loved us not, he would
not do for us as he does; and for my conscience, I thank God I am at peace
therewith, I was never troubled in my life; and for outward prosperity, I
thrive (I thank God) well; nay, these precise fellows are most without peace,
for they are not in Gods favor its like, for no body cares for them, but hates
them; besides, they be troubled in mind, and sad, and some of them are at
their wits ends; and for outward peace, they be ever sickly, a number of them,
and one cross or other is upon them, so that I think you are quite wide.

Answ. How foolishly do these reason? Sol.
They are loved of God because of their outward prosperity; This is but Esaus,
but Ishmaels Portion, yea, and Judas bare the bag: The Lord makes his sun to
shine and the rain to fall, even on the bad: He casts such bones to dogs; and
for their peace of conscience, its no peace, but benumbedness, and an hard
heart for want of sight of their deadly danger, which yet is never the less,
and will one day break out in most fearful manner; they peace that were never
humbled for their sins? Its woeful peace; they peace that live in their sins,
what to do have they therewith? had Zimri peace that slew his master?

For outward peace, Job 21. 7, 8, etc.
health, welfare, etc. its often the portion even of Atheists and contemners of
God; but what is it whilst they have no peace, with God, have it in wrath with
a woe and secret curse? There Is no soundness in this peace, it cannot comfort
the heart, its but flashing vanity, if any contrary blow come, they are dead in
the nest, as Belshazzar. Besides, how uncertain is it? subject to be lost every
moment; Job 20. 8.
The wrath of God is still ready to seize on them, as on the Philistines
sporting at Sampson, See Psalm 37. 2. 20.
Pharaoh, Herod, etc. They pass away as a dream, their rejoicing is as the
crackling of Thorns; How soon is their Candle put out? They stand in a slippery
place, how suddenly are they gone, leaving nothing but a stink behind? Their
end will be eternal howling with Dives. And are not the godly in Gods favor,
because men favor them not? They are the more; and for their trouble in mind,
when is it? even in the beginning, especially when God opens their eyes to see
their woeful case, whereupon they are humbled; but them by the Gospel have their
hearts directed to see the right way of comfort, and so in time attain sweet
peace, which if at any time they interrupt, they never leave seeking till they
have recovered it again: For their crosses, they have often prosperity, though
not so much or continually as to surfeit, but when they meet with crosses; God
makes them wholesome, as our corrupt nature makes them needful, John 14. 27.
but in the midst of them, they know themselves at peace with God, 2 Cor. 6. 9.
and have peace in conscience, and this sweetens their affliction; Their case
is in show miserable, but in truth happy.

Therefore let none content himself, Use.
till he can prove himself in Christ, Isaiah 48. 22.
else there is no peace for him.

All that are in Christ Jesus,] Here note,

1. That we should not neglect the poorest or weakest Christian in a
Congregation, Respect is to be had of all Gods people.
but have respect unto them as well as the greatest or wealthyest: Its an ill
sign when men can make no difference in their judgment between a Civil man,
and one truly Religious, and that can give no countenance to those in whom they
see the grace of God; They account of every thing in great men, but despise or
slight even the greatest things in mean ones.

But there be some professors which yet be not in Christ Jesus, but are
hang-byes and hypocrites, what wishes he to them? none of this peace; its not
for them, sorrow is fitter for them, that they may be humbled, and endeavor
after true repentance: So do I wish to all true hearted Christians, as much
peace and welfare as may be good for their souls; but those that be hypocrites,
professors, but neither believing in Christ, nor reforming their ways, I wish
they may have little rest and ease, till they set their hearts to seek to be at
peace with God.

2. The most admirable and near union that is between Christ and every true
believer; The near union between Christ and true Christians
They are in Christ as the root, and built on him as the foundation, and are
Members of his mystical body; by virtue hereof it comes to pass that they
continue and hold out, when hypocrites fail and fall away: Hypocrites are as a
wooden leg, believers as true Members of the Body; Simile.
Those as standing waters that dry up, these as a spring that runs continually,
and that from Christ the Wellhead and Fountain of all grace. But of this
heretofore.

Amen.] Fervency of affection and faith requisite in Prayer.
This word notes the fervency of his affection, and shows forth his faith;
These two be most necessary in all our Prayers, and thus we see he has taken
his leave of them with as many tokens of love as may be.

FINIS.
