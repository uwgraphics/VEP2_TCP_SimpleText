An Achrostickal EPITAPH ON
S igh S erious S isters Valiant Sprague here lies, I ove I ustly I udges, this
same Sacrifice R uns R ude and R ashly, sans Hyperbolies. E xquisite E mblem of
E ternal Worth D rawn D ry by D eath; thy Virtue did show forth W it W orth and
W isdom; all conjoined in one. A ll A rts A ssisting are to thee alone. R eason
R ules R ightly, Everlasting Fame D oath here D eclare and D ignifie thy Name. S
eraphick S prague! S ublime in every part. P rowess with P rudence P
re-commandeth Art. R enowned R ock, R ich Relick of our days; A rts A ncient A
rtist, far surpassing Praise: G reat G ood and G lorious, thy Triumphant Fate V
nlikely W as, V s, thus, to antedate: E arths E mperor, E xpired is of late.

But stay my Muse, thou had almost forgot
Our Modern Hero; oh, forget him not:
Lend us a tear or two, if thou can cry
And usher forth, to us, an Elegy.
Neptune you are churlish, for to make his Grave
Within the imposthum'd Bubble of a Wave:
Whilst Thetis kinder, did his Corpse translate
Unto our Shore, to stigmatize thy hate:
To show how much in Envy you excel;
Thou Wilt in thy Orb, admit no parallel.
The Deep-mouthed Cannon, has him often frobore,
Thy Billows, are more fatal, when they rore,
Like full mouthed Hypocrites, it all destroys,
And so the deepest Waters, make least noise.
Then to lament in brave Heroic Verse,
Hang these dull Pendants on his Funeral Hearse.
Farewell Brave Sprague, thy Tragic Fate exacts
Tears tumbling from our Eyes, in Catarracts:
By whose impetuous Torrents, Earth shall be
Disrobed of Verdant Nature's Tapestry.
E. M.
