1 Timothy chap 2. verse 1. I exhort therefore, that first of all,
supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men.


MY beloved brethren, here you may understand the humble obedience that belongs
to every one that does desire to be a faithful servant to the Lord, as you may
understand by this place of Scripture, for Paul, here you may see gave Timothy
a charge over the people, to let prayer be made for all men, and indeed good
people, I cannot perceive but Paul did see they was a wicked and a sinful
people, so he thought that by prayer they might be converted, but alas how many
is there now a days that would have a sinner converted by prayer: no my
brethren, we now a days fly too much off the Apostles rules, and the reason
is, we think our wits far better than theirs, for rather then we will pray for
a sinner: nay, we had rather curse them; but good people I would desire every
one of you to take the same exhortation that Paul gave to Timothy, that is, to
pray for all men: for if you see a drunkard take heed of him, but pray for him:
if you see a swearer, deligh^ not in his company, but pray for him: if you s^^
a whoremonger, take heed of his wickedness^ but pray for him: for you may
perceive where b^ this place of Scripture that we ought to pray f^^ all men
a^de by Gods Grace we may prevail^ for in the 5 chap^er o^ Jam^s and ^he ^6
vers^ there you have a rule for it, why you should pra^ for all men, and this
is the rule that you may b^ healed: nay my brethren there is great comfo^^ too
for every one that will pray faith^ully: f^^ in this verse of this chapter you
may find the the prayers of the faithful shall prevail as y^ may find it
written in Jame^ 5 16. therefore (...) the name of God, I would desire every
go^^ Christian to give their mind to pra^er and wi^^ as good confidence as the
Prophet David (...) Psalm. 62. 1. In these words, T^uly my so^ waits upon
God: from him comes my sa^vation. Indeed I would desire every good Chr^stian
to have as good confidence in the Lord, (...) the Prophets had: for certainly
we must ha^ a good confidence in the Lord if we mean to (...) saved, and have
as much power in spirit as D^vid had, then may we boldly say as he said (...)
Psalm. 73. 24. In these words, Thou sha^^ guide me with thy counsel, and
afterward r^ceive me to thy glory. and in the 25 verse. the^ you may see the
confidence that he had in Go^ more than in man: for said he, Whom have I in
heaven but thee? and there is none upon Earth that I desire besides thee.
Indeed good people, we ought to have no confidence in any man, but in God:
which the Lord of his mercy give every man, woman and child, grace to serve him
and obey him, till the hour of death: which indeed we do not know how soon it
may please God to call us: Indeed we do not know how soon, it may be to night
before to morrow, no man can tell when. Therefore as the Apostle said in Mark
13. 33. Take ye heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time is.

Indeed my brethren, you may perceive here, that we have no time set, when the
time of the coming of our Lord and Savior shall be: therefore it is good for
us all to have a care in time. for fear the Lord give us a just cause to cry
out as Zion did, as you may find it written in the Lamentations 4. 4 in these
words, The tongue of the sucking child cleavet^ to the roof of his mouth for
thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaks it unto them. And in
the 5 verse of this Chapter, there you may see what misery came upon these
people for sin: they that did feed delicately, are desolate in the streets,
they that were brought up in scarlets, embrace dunghils.

I would desire every good Christian to take heed in time, for fear the Lord
execute the very ^ame judgment upon these Lands and Nations that we live in;
for by woeful experience, too many in these times have found it too true, that
the very same judgments, partly upon a great many, for in many places you may
see many a brave House and Family ruinated and gone to decay, which certainly,
was not altogether for their own sins, no my brethren, I am afraid that we
all stand guilty of sin. and although the Lord spare us for a time, to see if
we will repent, yet certainly without true repentance, the Lord will not spare
us no more then he spared Egypt, when he threatened their destruction, as you
may find it written in the 32 chap. of Ezekiel, beginning at the 9 verse, and so
to the 12.

I will also vex the hearts of many people, when I shall bring thy destruction
among the Nations, into the Countries which thou have not known.

10 Yea, I will make many people amazed at thee, and their Kings shall be
horribly afraid of thee, when I shall brandish my sword before them, and they
shall tremble at every moment; every man for his own life, in the day of thy
fall. 11 For thus says the Lord GOD, The sword of the King of Babylon shall
come upon thee.

12 By the swords of the mighty will I cause thy multitude to fall, the
terrible of the Nati^ns all of them, and they shall spoil the pomp (...) Egypt,
and all the multitude thereof shall be ^^stroyed.

Indeed my brethren, you may see here by this ^ace of Scripture, that the Lord
threatened the ^gyptians with most heavy judgments for their ^^s, and do not we
think that our sins be as ^eat as theirs: yes certainly, and greater too,
^erefore in the name of God, let us all pray un^^ the Lord for mercy, and
surely he will hear (...), for he has no delight in the death of the ^icked:
but he had rather that we should turn ^om our wicked ways, and repent: and be
^nverted: And indeed I would desire every ^e of you young or old, rich or
poor, to do ^ur best endeavors to forsake your wicked ^ayes, for as the Lord
said to Ezekiel, so I say ^to you all here present: Therefore O thou ^n of man,
speak unto the house of Israel, thus (...) spoke saying, if our transgressions
and our ^s be upon us, and we pine away in them, how ^all we then live, Ez^k^el
33. 10. here good people you may see that these people was afraid ^at they
should pine away in their sins, I but ^e what comfort the Lord sends by Ez^kiel
in ^e 11 verse. of this Chapter, in these words, Say ^to them, As I live, says
the Lo^d GOD, I ^ve no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked
turn from his way, and liv^ turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for w^ will
ye die, O house of Israel?

Indeed you may see here, the Lord has no desire that we should die in our
wickedness: (...) he had rather that we would turn from o^ wicked ways and
live: which the Lord of h^ heavenly mercy, give us all grace so to do: the it
may be the Lord will speak as comfortably this Land, as he did to the Land of
Israel, these words, Therefore thus says the Lo^ GOD, I have lifted up mine
hand, surely t^ heathen that are about you, they shall bear the shame.

For behold, I am for you, and I will tur^ unto you, and ye shall be tilled and
sown. you may find it written in the 36 of Ezeki^ the 7 and 9 verses.

And indeed, I would desire you all that (...) here present to take notice what
you hear at the present, and the Lord of his mercy give us a^ grace to make
good use of it: Indeed my brethren I would desire to move one question to you,
a^ that is this, in case the day of doom was to da^ which the Lord knows how
soon it may com^ it may be this very hour, for any thing that w^ know: what
answer could we make to so lovi^ and merciful a God as we have: Indeed I a^
persuaded that we should be very unready: n^ I do believe that we should not be
able to look him in the face, no nor able to make an answer for the least sin
of ten thousand: Therefore I desire you all to cry and call to the Lord for
mercy, before it be too late: for indeed we do not know how soon the Lord will
call us; For certainly there is but a few things to come to pass, which our
Savior Christ told his Disciples in Mat^hew 24 what should come to pass, for
said he Nation shall rise against Nation and by wofu^l experience we have seen
that full filled ^n the^e times that we live in, and he told them that there
should be false Teachers, and false Prophets, and false Christ's, and all this
we ^ay boldly say, we see come to pass in our days, for just such as Christ
said should be, such be now: for in many places there is a sort of people that
will not stick to say that they be Christ, which ^s most abominable that they
should be suffer^d: the M^nisters are counted by them bal^ Priests, and babbling
Fellows: But I would desire every good Christian to have a care of them,
behold I have told you before, Ma^^hew 24 25. and indeed good people, there is
a great many more warning pieces in the Scripture, which indeed I cannot
understand, but either all ^r the most of them are come to pass already: ^ut
only the calling of the Jews, and indeed ^e do not know how soon that may be:
it may be now for any thing that we know, for it is n^ very long since they
made great preparations (...) come into this land, where I hope the light (...)
the Gospel does shine, and I hope the Lord o^ of his mercy will continue it
among us, while^ the Sun and Moon endures; But I trust (...) God that he will
put it to the hearts of our R^lers, that they shall never have the power to
i^vade us: for they that would betray our blesse^ Lord and Savior. Such as
those can hardl^ be true to man: no, we have had fair example^ enough before
hand: I would desire you but (...) look into the Book of Martyrs, and you m^
hear how most barbarously they used the Chr^stians that confessed the Gospel of
Christ, an^ certainly I do believe that they would have (...) more mercy on us,
then they had of them, ^f the had the same power, which I trust the Lord wi^
never give it them: Indeed my brethren, I ca^ not perceive but we have Jews
enough already, for as our Savior said, that the Father should be against the
Son, and the Son again^ the Father, so it is now, for the Father would sell the
life of the Son, and the Son the Father now a days, and indeed I cannot
perceive b^ such as these be Jews bad enough, but as David said in the 59
Psalm and the 1 and 2 ver^ so I would desire every good Christian to pr^ as he
did, and that with a true heart, and the^ ^e the words, Deliver me from mine
enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.

2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.

Prove. 4. 1, 2, 13. Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend
to know understanding.

2. For I give you good doctrine: forsake you not my law* and in the thirteenth
verse,

Take fast hold of instruction, let her not go; keep her, for she is thy life.

Which I pray God give every good Christian grace to take good counsel, for
indeed we stand in great need of it: for truly my brethren the times is just as
the Prophet Isaiah said, should be in the 3 of Isaiah and the 5 verse.

And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his
neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the
base against the honorable.

And indeed just so it is now, for never was there more oppressing both of poor
and rich, and as for the behavior of children: I do believe that it is as
plainly fulfilled as can be just now: for let a child of twelve years of age
meet a man of fourscore, and you shall see him pass by as proudly, as if he
were not worthy to dry his shoes, which is a shame to see it, and indeed I
must needs tell such Parents with fire which i^ a most heavy judgment, and do
we not thin^ that we deserve it too: yes certainly we do deserve as much as
they: indeed the Lord has given us many fair warning pieces by fire, in many
places in this Land: yet there is bu^ small crying out to God for mercy, no
longer then we either see it, or hear of it, just as a child fears the rod no
longer then he is a beating: bu^ in the name of God every good Christian pray
unto the Lord night and day, that he may be merciful unto our poor souls at
the latter day and hour of death ^he^ may we come to hear tha^ blessed voice of
our Lord and Savior sounding in our ear.

Matthew 25. 34. Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
for you from the foundation of ^he world.

And indeed a blessed sounding it is, and the Lord give us grace to prepare our
hearts, s^ here upon earth, that we may have both ou^ hearts and ears, that we
may be ready at the coming of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ therefore I
would desire all to, Take heed, watc^ and pray: for ^e know not when the time
i^ Mark. 13. verse. 33.

And once more I do exhort you to take he^ that you be not deceived in these
dangerous ^nes, for the Lord gives us a fair warning to ^ke heed.

Matthew. 24. 4, 5. And Jesus answered and ^d unto them, Take heed that no man
deceive ^^.

5 For many shall come in my Name saying, ^m Christ: and shall deceive many.

Indeed this is come to pass now a dares, for ^u may see such abroad in many
places: I but would desire every one of you to have a care of ^em, for as Paul
said in the second of Timothy chap 3 verse. For the time will come when ^y will
not endure found doctrine, but after ^eir own lusts shall they heap to
themselves ^chers, having i^ch^ng ea^s.

And indeed there is a great many of those a^ad but have a care of them, for
certainly if ^ey should entangle you in their snare of delu^n, you will not so
easily get out, for they be 2 Timothy 3. 4. Traitors, heady, high^nded, lovers
of pleasures more then lovers (...) God.

Indeed my brethren I would desire you to ^^e a care of them for fear they
should deceive ^^, so I would desire you not to despise them, (...) certainly
they be that people our Savior ^d should come and therefore we ought not to
^pise, but exhort them, and pray for them, and love their person; but abhor
their conditions: f^ though they be a seducing people, which Chri^ said should
come: yet they be our brethren i^ the same form and shape of man, and wh^
knows how soon it may please the Lord t^ call them back again, as he did
Saul by the highway, therefore in the name of God, let u^ pray for their
conversion, for Timothy charge^ the people that they should pray for all men,
a^ you may find it written in the first of Timoth^ and the second chapter, and
the first verse. (...) these words: I exhort therefore, that first (...) all,
supplications, prayers, intercessions, an^ giving of thanks be made for all men.

Indeed by this place of scripture, I cannon perceive but we must pray for
them, as w^ would do for our selves, which the Lord of hi^ mercy put it into
the hearts of every good Christian so to do, and as David said in the 37 Psa^
and the first and second verses, so I say to yo^ all that be here present: Fret
not thy self because of evil doers, neither be thou envious against the
workers of iniquity. For they sha^ soon be cut down like the grass, and with
as the green herb.

So here you may see, David gives us a fai^ exhortation here in this Psalm
that we shou^ not fret at the wicked, and in the 35 and 36 v^ of this Psalm
there says David: I have se^ ^he wicked in great power, and spreading ^imselfe
like a green bay tree. Yet he pas^d away, and Io, he was not: yea, I sought
^im, but he could not be found. Here my ^ethren, you may perceive, that if we
will ^ut wait with patience, they will all vanish ^way in time: therefore as it
is written in ^e 34 verse. ^f this Psalm, Wait on the lord, and ke^p his way,
and he shall exalt ^hee to inherit the land: when the wicked ^e cut off, thou
shall see it. Indeed it is ^est for us all to look into our own sins, and ^y
and call night and day for mercy for them, and let us call to mind the
lamentation of ^erusalem: All her people sigh, they seek read, they have given
their pleasant things ^or meat to relieve the soul: see, O Lord, and consider,
for I am become vile, Lamen^tions the first and the 11 verse. and in the 2 ver.
there you may here parents, that it is ^ng of them: Train up a child in the way
^e should go: and when he is old, he will ^ot depart from it. Proverbs 22. 6.
And ^hildren, obey your parents in the Lord: ^r this is right. Ephesians the 6
and the 1 ^^d the 2 verses. Honor thy Father and ^other, which is the first
Commandment ^ith promise, and in the 20 Chapter of Exodus and the 12 verse.
there you shall find tha^ is one of the Commandments that the Lord commanded
the people to keep, that is to say^ Honor thy Father and thy Mother tha^ thy
days may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God gives thee: for as yo^
may find it in Proverbs the 19 and the 2^ verse. He that wastes his father, and
casts away his mother, is a son that causet^ shame, and brings reproach.
And indee^ there be too many such disobedient children now a days, which the
Lord of his merc^ give them all grace to amend, for certainl^ they cannot say
with a true heart that the^ fear God, if they do not honor father an^ mother,
and I pray God give us all grace t^ amend our wicked lives, and pray to the
Lord, for fear he should come upon us, as h^ did upon Jerusalem, in the 20 of
Ezekiel an^ the 45. 46, 47. verses. Moreover, the wor^ of the Lord came unto
me, saying, Son (...) man, set thy face toward the south, a^^ drop thy word
toward the south, and prophecy against the forest of the south fiel^ And say
to the forest of the south, Hear the word of the Lord, Thus says the Lord Go^
Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and shall devour every green tree in
thee, and very dry tree: the flaming flame shall not ^e quenched, and all faces
from the south ^o the north shall be burnt therein.

Indeed my brethren, here you see that the Lord threatened the people with fire,
here her ^amentation for the misery that the Lord had ^rought her to, by reason
of her sin, which ^akes her lament, in these words: Is it nothing to you, all
ye that pass by? behold and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my ^orrow,
which is done unto me, wherewith ^he Lord has afflicted me, in the day of his
^erce anger. and in the 4 chap. of Lamenta. and the 6 verse. For the punishment
of the ^niqui^y of the daughter of my people, is ^reater then the punishment of
the sin of ^^dom, that was overthrown as in a mo^ent, and no hand stayed on her.

Therefore my brethren. to draw to a con^usion, I exhort you all in the name of
God (...) take notice of what you have heard at this ^resent, and strive by all
means to make ^me good use of it, which must be done by ^rayer, and take heed
of despising one another and beg night and day of the Lord, to send ^own his
spiritual grace into the hearts of ^very one of us, that we may deserve his
^ercy at the hour of death: and that for Jesus Christ his sake, to whom be
give^ as is most due: all honor power and praise both now and for ever more,
Amen.

I am yours in Christ Jesus till death. T. R.

A Prayer to conclude, fit for every Christian to make use of.
Psalm. 102. 1. Hear our Prayers, O Lord, and let our crying come unto thee.


O thou eternal and everlasting Lord God, Maker and Creator of Heaven and
Earth, in whom we live, move and have our being, thou, whom the winds and
Seaes does obey: in whose powerful hands are all the corners of the Earth, we
thy poor distressed servants and children, do in all humility of spirit, send
up our petitions and prayers unto the throne of thy divine Majesty, desiring
upon the bended knees of our penitent hearts, that thou will be pleased to
hear, and graciously to answer these our supplications which we make unto thee:
we do acknowledge, O Lord, that before we could do any thing we could sin,
and when we could do any thing, we could do nothing but sin; neither are we
able of our selves to think a good thought much less to do a good deed;
therefore O Lord, we cast our selves, our souls and our bodies, only upon thy
mercies: therefore we beseech thee to guide us in all our actions, and to
bless our up-rising and lying down, our goings forth and our coming in: guide
our hands that they do n^ harm, guide our tongues that they speak^ no evil,
guide our ears that they hearke^ not to every vain talk, which tends to n^
good purpose: guide our eyes that they wander not after the vain delights and
pleasure^ of this sinful world: guide our hearts with the grace of thy holy
spirit, so that every one of us may be contented with that portion that thou
have allotted for us, and not to covet and desire other men's goods, more the^
becoms us to do: guide our feet that they may tread in true paths of
righteousness, which may bring us into the way to life everlasting; Moreover
we pray thee to forgive us all our sins which we have formerly committed, and
that we may make better use of the time to come, then heretofore we have done,
and that we may love thee O Lord above all things, and our neighbors as our
selves, laying apart all hypocrisy, fraud, deceit and dissimulation, all vain
and idle talks, all cursing, swearing, and blaspheaming, all envy, pride,
covetousness, hatred and malice, and all other uncharitable dealings: so that
whilst it is thy good pleasure that we shall remain in this transitory world,
we may live in thy fear, and at the last, dye in thy favor, so that after this
life ^nded, we may enjoy eternal happiness in ^he kingdom of heaven, and that
for the sake ^f thy only Son, our only Savior, Jesus Christ our Lord, to whom
with thee and the Holy Ghost, three persons and one ever living God, be all
honor and glory, power, praise, might, majesty and thanksgiving, both now and
for ever Amen.

FINIS.
