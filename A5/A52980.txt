A New SONG.
Being a SECOND PART to the same Tune of Lillibullero, etc.
A Treaty's on foot, look about English Boys,
Stop a Bad Peace as soon as you can;
A Peace, which our Hanover's Title destroys,
And shakes the high Throne of Our Glorious Queen ANNE.
Over, over, Hanover, over,
Haste and assist our Queen and our State;
Have over, Hanover, fast as you can over;
Put in your Claim, before it is too late.
A Bargain our Queen made with her good Friends,
The States, to uphold the Protestant Line;
If a Bad Peace is made, that Bargain then ends,
And spoils Her good Majesty's gallant Design.
Over, over, etc.
A Creature there is, that goes by more Names
Than ever an honest Man could, should or would;
And I wish we don't find him an arrant King James,
Whenever he peeps out from under his Hood.
Over, over, etc.
The Dauphin of France to a Monastry went
To visit the Mother of him aforesaid;
He wished her much Joy, and he left her Content
With a dainty fine Peace about to be made.
Over, over, etc.
What kind of a Peace, I think we may guess,
So welcome must be to her and her Lad:
And let any Man say it, if we can do less
Than be very sorry, when they are very glad.
Over, over, etc.
Whoever is in Place, I care not a fig;
Nor will I decide 'twixt High-Church and Low:
It Is now no Dispute between Tory and Whig,
But whether a Popish Successor, or No.
Over, over, etc.
Our Honest Allies this Peace does explain,
Of which our French Foes so loudly do boast;
But I hope, if they reckon on India and Spain,
They reckon without consulting their Host.
Over, over, etc.
Or else we must bid farewell to our Trade,
Whatever fine Tales some People have told;
For whenever a Peace of that Nature is made,
We shall send out no Wool, nor bring home no Gold.
Over, over, etc.
Then wage on the War, Boys, with all your Might,
Our Taxes are great, but our Danger's not small;
We'd better be half Undone, than be quite;
As half a Loaf's better than no Bread at all.
Over, over, etc.
FINIS.
