THE SPEECH Of his Grace JAMES Duke of Queensberry, his Majesty's high
Commissioner to the PARLIAMENT.
The 30 of May When Adjourned to the 20 of June. My Lords and Gentlemen,
I Am Troubled with such a Cold and Hoarsness, that not being able to Speak
much, nor in a Condition to stay any time here; I shall therefore only tell
you, that as I was ever Firm and Faithful to my King, so I was ever Zealous for
the Honor and Interest of my Country: And at this time I hoped to have done
Acceptable Service to both. For I can boldly say, that I have Power and
Instructions, for every thing that appeared Necessary or Convenient for the
Good and Advantage of the Nation, as to their Religion, Property, Liberty,
Trade, and particularly what could be of most solid Use to our African and
Indian Company. But several things have occurred, wherein I find my self obligd
to Consult His Majesty, and so of necessity must Adjourn for some Days.
