Glorious Glimmerings OF THE LIFE OF LOVE, UNITY, And pure JOY.

Written in Rome Prison of Madmen in the Year 1660. but conserved as in
Obscurity until my arrival at Barbados in the year 1662.

From whence it is sent the second time to the Lord's Lambs, By J. P.

LONDON, Printed for Robert Wilson, 1663.

JOHN the Prisoner for the Witness of the Power of GOD in the blessed
Tribulation, Patience, Content and Peace of the Lamb, To the sanctified
heavenly Flock of Gods only and alone Pasture, in the Bowels, which is a daily
Supplication and Intercession, most internal Salutation, etc.
THe Magnificency of the Most Mighty, and his Supremacy stands on high in
Dominion over all things; So Omnipotent is his Essence in all his Purposes and
Passages, that if he but thinks of Visitations, Nations are scattered before
him; or, if He but steppeth among Kings and Princes in the Jealousy of his
Displeasure, and spurneth with his foot at their Thrones, As the storms of the
East wind rooteth up the lofty trees of the Mountain of the Forest, even so of
a sudden becomes their Seats, besides the foundation of their Palaces sinks
down as a Wall which the openings of an Earthquake has swallowed in her hungry
womb, who reduces the banks of Pride and Munitions of Arrogance unto the
destiny of a fall, into the gaping Gulf of the mouth of exceeding Misery.

Let Mountains now be bent to roar like Oceans Noises,
And let the Rocks be rent, converted into Voices:
For how can Stones but speak, with Iron, Steel and Brass:
And Adamants but break at what is come to pass?
And sound in one set hour forth shouts of his Renown?
Whose glorious mighty Power Eternity does crown?
For has not he made Owls, with Moles and Batts to sing,
Like as the chanting Fowls harmonious tunes in Spring?
And Eagles he and she made both to loath their prey,
Two Turtle-Doves to be in Shilo's shining day?
And has not be the Bear, the Panther and the Lion,
In substance made appear like Lambs in holy Sion?
And by his Mercy rich transformed the Serpents sting,
Into a Virtue which from Death to Life does bring.
And made of Rocks a Fountain, and Stones refreshing streams,
And of a Grain a Mountain, and Darkness Orion's Beams?
And made of puddle mire, a Limpid Pond of pleasure,
Whence Fishes joys, as fire, ascend exceeding measure.
He turned the hiddious Night into a glorious Day,
And cut through clouds a Light, and Hills a Level way.
And made a Seed a Sheaf, the Sick Sound, and Strong Weak;
The Blind to see, and Deaf to hear, and Dumb to speak.
And Wine did purely sever from mud, which man did mingle,
Which is enough for ever to make all ears to tingle.
Sure whilst I meditate his glorious Wonders,
The Heavens praise Him with the shouts of Thunders.
The Stars with Hymns harmonious abound,
And each bright Cloud like as a Trump does sound.
The showrs of Rain melodious Message brings,
And Dews descend with tunes of Cymbal strings.
The Rainbow's bent with Viol strings above,
Shooting her Music Shafts of Orions Love,
Which fly through Heaven with loud Organs sound,
Which opens Seas, deeps, yea and rents the ground.
These Influences dropping down like Showers,
And piercing through my Vitals, over-powers
My Soul with Solace, and on Wings does carry
Her up above, in Melody to marry
Sweet Pleiades, who gathers with embraces
Her in his Arms of his Supernal Graces;
Whose virtuous Breath, like Brooks, does overflow
His own Plantation in the Valleys low,
Which makes the Seed spring up, and Plants to flourish,
In all her Branches, which the Root does nourish;
And each green Bough with fruits of Joy does bend
At Blessings root, that Joys may never end.
Ah! thou the Building founded on the Rock,
Whose Door Arts engines never can unlock.
Nor can thy Situation by fierce blusters
Be shaken; nor can Force which Pharaoh musters,
Drawn up with roaring Cannons for to prove
The substance of thy Walls which Hell cannot move,
'Cause thy Inhabitants as Wind to waver;
But they in war sweet Songs to Lutes do quaver,
Whom Combats crown with conquest by the might
Of God, who for them does the Battle fight;
For he is Victorious, under whose blessed Banner
They are preserved in securest manner;
Who rushes in the Woods among the Trees,
And makes his foes drop down like smothered Bees.
There Is no Enchantments, nay, nor Wizards charms,
Can Him withstand, nor forcs of Hostile Arms;
Who makes his Opposits in blood to wallow,
And Earth to gape, them greedily to swallow.
Wherefore ye Sons, your Instruments prepare,
With strained strings, most exquisitely rare,
And sweetly tuned, with Muses whet most sharp,
Our God's Renown, and Praise thereon to harp;
Since from his hand, abundantly your Souls
Have drunk Salvation up like Wine in bowls,
And made you eat of Mercies, numberless,
And clothed you with Compassions in distress:
And let his Glory be your meditations,
And his high Honor all your contemplations;
For such effects will sure produce increase
Of Joy and Gladness joined to endless Peace.
And now the countenances of an illustrious Offspring, and comeliness of a
numberless train of the most enamoured beautiful Virgins, does compass my
waste, as with the girdings of a cincture of ravishment; to whom (though I have
but the weakness of utterance, and feebleness of stammering expressions, yet
with the sincerity of a simple soul, and fervency of a burning spirit) I am
impulsively constrained to vocifie, although but through the smallest Organ of
the Quire, saying to my beloved, O ye enamoured Daughters of Jerusalem, and
Sons of Sions King! in whom the Righteousness of his Majesty is revealed, and
the Wisdom of his Holiness from above, to seek an entrance of utterance toward
you; I may wisely first interrogate, saying, How may I utter? or, in what
manner may I paraphrase to render you an ample proportioned Remonstrance of
that Love of our only Father, which is locked up (as mine everlasting debt, and
your peculiar treasure) in the most secret Cabbinet of my inner Closer,
reserved for the day of your service: Verily nothing can open it, as it is,
besides the Key of the Kingdom within you, nor declare it, as it ought to be
spoken, but the tongue of the Learned which is given you; and being declared,
not an ear can hear it, save that of the Lamb without spot; or, if it were
printed on Parchment, or engraven on Brass, not an eye could discern the
perspicuity of the Characters, so as to give a voice of fluentness of the
liberal sound thereof, except the tender Eye of the Turtle-Dove, whose Sight is
a searcher into secrets; in all which you are known unto me; by whom I am
perfectly received, and manifestly understood, as the Savory Voice of your
Beloved, instantly and intimately with you, in the dearest conjunction of
Eternity, which must never end: for as fuel which is cast into flames, yields
but the same natural effect of fervor; and as Gold that is melted with Gold,
imbodies in an entire weight, so am I in Unity with you: And as the Rivers of
Canaan are four everlasting. Witnesses of conjunction, the one of Milk, the
other of Honey, another of Wine, and the other of Oil, imbodying in one Pond,
and from thence running forth in one entire and irresistible current, which no
man can stop to extract the sweetness thereof; Such, even such, is the
individual relation of my contract and betrothing with you; Yea, and as a
bushel of Salt which is cast into the Sea, and dissolved in her womb in the
Western part, and a Voice says unto the Son of Man in the East, Arise, and go
to the West, and by just separation, gather me the distinct drops of them corns
of Salt which are dissolved in the utmost quarter of the Western Oceans: And he
answers him, saying, It is a thing altogether impossible for me to do. Such
is my entrance in the bowels of your body, as a drop of Savor and a dram of
Sweetness within you, in the Union, as blood to blood in your veins, and marrow
to marrow in your bones: Yea, greater than this is my Covenant with you, with
you, with you, O ye Seed of the Lord of lords! O ye Daughters of the King of
kings, and Sons of the most high God of gods, wherein I can never be separated
from you: For as the government of the night is given in contract to the the
Moon, and as light is joined to the Morning Star, yea, and as the brightness of
the day is imbodied in the Sun, so even so are your ravishing breasts my bed,
where I frequently rest without travels, and repose without sense of sorrows.
And after all this, though I dwell in the Banqueting House where the Dainties
are spread before me, and am sealed with the signet of Love, and have swallowed
up the streams of the Fountain of Charity and Affection, like forcible floods;
nevertheless, I find an insufficiency in my self, to tell you the greatest
things of the indissolvable Bonds of mine everlasting Relation unto you, which
verily is exceeding good both for you and for me, that we all as one may
always and evermore know our God alone, to be the wisest of all Counselors and
Instructors, speaking to us and teaching us his Oracles in the secrets, when
the external Voice neither foundeth nor reaches unto us.

And Oh! Oh thou Jerusalem! the holy City of the Lord thy God, This is the Word
of thy Creator unto thee, who has raised thee of a little stone, unto the
proportion of the most immovable Mountain in the Globe of the whole Earth, and
made thy Walls an everlasting safety, and thy Gates the entrance of joyfulness:
I the Lord, the Most Mighty, will yet make the Coverings of thy Habitations, as
a Glory of the greatest Dignity, and Crowns of the highest Royalty; for they
shall be a resplendency of a transcending Light, reaching into the Chambers of
the seventh Heavens; and the glitterings of the very Pavements of thy Streets,
shall be as torches like flaming Hills, giving a through light unto the
profoundest deeps of the Oceans: For lo, there shall be no more Earth between
thee and the Crystal Seas, nor yet an Element between thee and the upper
Heavens: Moreover the day comes unto the fruits of thy blessed Womb, that
among them the walls of thy reach shall be no more counted nor called a
confine; for they shall infinitely run over the utmost limitation of the space
of place; and it shall be unto them which walk in thy streets, that they shall
but look thereon, and though running as in a race, yet shall read, perceive,
and understand the wonders of thy Creator, which are hid in the deeps; and
through the brightness of them which have an everlasting situation over all
waters, they shall see the plays of the Fishes, and the rejoycings of their
scooles in a smooth Sea without storms: For the Winds of the Winter shall cease
for ever, and a tranquillity of the entire Body of all the Constellations, shall
cover her face without end; and the dwellers of thy habitations shall call the
name of thy streets, The Prospective-Glass of the Counsels of the Omnipotent
Majesty, which shows a perfection of fullness without the resemblance or form of
figures.

Ah! thou Beauty of Beauties, on whose face the most illustrious Splendour of
Splendors is spread; the very twinkling of thine eye, as the glimpse of a
countenance cast over me, catches away my soul, as in the talants of Rapture,
bearing me in a fiery Cloud. O God, let therefore the Ravishments, wherewith
She has ravished me, become Raptures of Rentings of the souls of her Seed, in
the superabundant solace of my spirit; and if my pleasures be not of a
sufficiency equivolent to their statures, then let my body be broken as bread,
and my bowels powered out as brooks, and let me walk hungry for the better
things, and return as an empty pitcher to the Fountain of Waters, that yet in a
little I may be a help to the least, which are the dearling Children of her
Womb.

Now, Oh ye Babes of the early Day! this I have to say unto you, in the life
and springing of the Light from on High, in which, through the blessed Birth,
under the tediousness of the travel thereof, you have obtained a nearer and
dearer Calling of Childship, than that of an Adoption unto Heirship: Think ye
(my dear and tender Sisters and Brethren) and gather the Ponders in your selves
of the sweetest Banquets and choicest Wine, of the most mellodious Music,
delightsomest Pleasures, and greatest Joys, yea, wind your selves by
Instruments, and line unto the deepest bottoms, and ascend by the highest
ladder of your choicest Contemplations, in the utmost strength of every sense
of Joys, And when you have said to your selves, thou can not descend a
degree lower, nor ascend a step higher, then read in your selves the answer of
your Beloved, which testifies to the face of faithfulness of every holy Life,
As the first Heavens is above the lowest earth, and the third Heavens above the
firmament of the first, even so shall the sense be, exceeding every sense of
that which now is, and all shall be enjoyed in the perfect joy of the
possession of Perpetuity for ever.

And therefore run my Darlings in the Race of Righteousness, so as to reach the
Mark with the Recompense, and comfort your selves and one another with these
sayings.

Come ye least of Babes, and leap up into the tenderness of my bosom, that I
may bear you up into the Mountain of Zion, which is waxed exceeding mighty in
the midst of your Mother, where you may turn on the top thereof, and behold the
Rays of her glory compassing you: Ah roll your eye at the Motion of my finger,
which points at the emphasis of a Remnant of her Ornaments and Features, that
you may be refreshed with a gracious gladness in her Glory: For her hair is the
Rain of the Clouds which waters the Plants in Spring, and makes the buds of
the Garden shoot forth into flowers, and gives the Roses the fragrant odours;
the beds of Spices have Myrrh in their dropings, and the ground of their
plantation gives the fruits of her goodness, as a congratulating present to the
Gardner; when she combs her head, the Dews do fall, which refresh the grass of
the field, and make the Earth to smile with Rejoycings, whilst she arrayes her
with the Garments of green, trimming her with the Blossoms of fruitful trees,
and attiring her with the Ornaments of Jewels, and Pendencies on Vine-branches:
Her Face is as the Meridian Sun, which gives light unto the ends of the Earth:
Her Eye is as the Beams of the rising of Orion, which pierces through the
crevices of the doors of obscurity and darkness; Her Mouth is the door of the
treasures of Counsel, where Wisdom and Life is conconserved; Her Tongue is the
Key which unlocks the Graves, and opens the jaws of the Seas; She calls with
her Voice from the situation of her Rest, and they vomit up their dead before
her; She breaths on bones and sculls, and they rise upon their feet and walk
in the strength of revived men; Her Hands are the bountifulness of Blessings,
which fill up the baskets of the Obedient; Her Arms are an endless compass of
Compassions, which reach to the ransomed with refreshments; to the Sores of the
wounded she is a Salve of Salvation, for her Medicine is the multitude of
Mercies; Her Breasts are like Hills of refined Gold, which as fountains of
unemptible fullness, are an everlasting streaming of the the most precious
Virtue of Life; he which lays his head in her bosom, his hair becomes as a
Wood of Pomegranate Trees, which are laden in a fruitful year, and the leaves
of his boughs become dropping with Myrrh, as with showers of the early Rain;
She is clothed with the spreadings of the Heavens, which have not a confine of
space; Her Mantle is wrought with all the Constellations, as with a needle by
the hand of Art: She is girded with the Rainbow of God, as the Child which is
wrapped in swaddling; She is laced with the cord of the Covenant, which is
called the Meridian Line; Her Skirts are trimmed with the spangles of
Lightenings, which astonisheth the Beasts of the field; Ah! how amiable is her
Countenance, and her Attirements, wherewith she has decked her self! verily,
of such a transparent nature of the excellency of illustrious Glory are they,
that it is altogether unfathomable by the longest line of every comprehensible
capacity, to reach in the Currents of his Conceptions; and notwithstanding her
unparalled resplendency, yet is she totally veiled from the vultrous eye, as
with Pillars of the blackest Clouds of most hiddeous darkness, and fire which
burns within them.

But, O ye her first fruits unto God! look, look into her superabounding
Basket, and behold the Crop of her Clusters of her Vineyard, which are gathered
in the first year of the Vintage, and cast your eye into the house of her
Winepress, that you may see the multitude and blessings of her increase, where
the Fats are overruning as floods, and the influences of Oil as Rivers: And
then after all this, yea, and much more than all this, which I have spread but
as a napkin before you, say unto your souls within you, If the Glory of our
Mother be so illustrious in her externals, and outer parts, Ah! What is her
resplendency within? If such is her Hand, what is her heart? if such is her
bosom, what are her Bowels? if such is her Visage, what are her Vitals? if
such be the Sound of her Voice, Ah, what is the Solace of her Soul? and if such
is the radiancy of her Eye, what is the glory of her Spirit? Verily, though I
see in the Virtue of her dignity an excellency and magnificency, yea, and glory
potential, covered with all supremacy, which in the Spirit also is utterable
within me, transcending all (as far as the East is from the West) what ever my
pen has characterized, even in such an ample, spacious, vast and infinitely
unequalled manner, exceeding all Orations of the wisest Orators, and Poems of
the profoundest Poets, which are Sons of Achitophel's Seed; yet must I cease
for a season, that the Lambs may learn and read the beauty of her ravishing
Visiognomy within them; assuredly knowing that herewith the very life of my
spirit (as a key of Oracles) shall fly hence (as with the Wings of Lightening)
and pitch upon many, as the Dove of the Ark on the Olive Tree, and rest in them
as the Lord of an everlasting Sabbath of Joy, which shall reveal unto them the
riches of her Glory, yea, and draw them also (as it has my tender Soul) into
an endless and unsearchable labrynth of loss, amidst the numberless odoriferous
Flowers of the over-spreading Pleasures of her Life.

Yet thus may I interrogate my soul within me, saying, Can thou waste thy
fullness, or count the drops of thy bottle prodigally spent (as water that is
spilt on a stone) which is poured out upon so blessed a Seed?

And she responsively resolves with a Nay, saying,

I never can in waste spend this my treasure
On you, the Doves which are my bosoms pleasure,
Nay; neither can I ever emptied be
To you, which in God's Life are joined to me;
For sure the more I love, the more increase
Of Love in me does flow, which cannot cease
Their running streams of Shiloh's sweet affection,
Since Loves Flames are the Walls of my protection;
I feel your Life, and therefore must retort
On you, my love, whilst I in Life exhort.
Most dear Beloved, prize the springing Grain,
And unto such Souls be as Clouds of Rain:
And in this day let my experience preach
Unto your life, and let my Witness reach
In deeps profound, wherein you purely ought
To prize a Babe surpassing every thought;
Ah! prize a Babe, even as I prize indeed
The very least, as fruits of God's own Seed,
And that you may esteem a Lamb the better,
Chained in Affection by Loves Lock and Fetter;
Mark ye my Pilgrimage through craggy ways,
Since sure not all have seen such heavy days:
For lo my spirit speaks when I do stand.
To turn and look about on every hand;
I quickly see, as through an open Cleft,
A Fox approached very nigh the left;
And thence but casting this my open sight,
A ravenous Wolf appears at my right;
Before a Lion, and behind a Bear,
Which fills my soul with most exceeding fear;
Besides, on the ground a subtle Serpent creeping,
And poisonous Viper, Crocadile-like, weeping;
Aloft a Dragon soaring in the Air,
I Am sure, enough to make all flesh despair.
Thus I am compassed in every hour,
Yet saved in God by his Almighty Power:
And therefore I do prize a Lamb in love,
As God's own Treasure, sealed in Heavens above:
Which Fruits of love, our God from all requires;
And such sweet Streams run joint with my desires.
And all dear Plants of God, we must be all very low and humble before our
Father, and honor Him with fear and trembling, and thanksgiving, in all states
and conditions, and be very single, simple and innocent in his pure Eye, and
exceeding tender to one another in the Pitties wherewith he has been merciful
unto us, and covered us with his own Compassions; and take occasions in the
Life of Love to speak to one another, and visit one another in the holy Bowels
with the Greeting and Salutation of the holy Kiss, where the World reaches
not; for in this Spirit, we know that we are of God, and the whole World lies
in Wickedness, which stand in the enmity to this Love, which is the manifest
Power of God revealed in us, which delivers us from all evil; for in the Love
we witness the Strength which takes up and bears the Cross, to the crucifying
of the Old Man with all his lusts and affections, whereby we receive the
Testimony of the true Faith and in it do also witness, in our own spirits, the
taking up of a Life in the Heavenly Places of the immortal Joy, which nothing
is able to bereave us of, having (by abundant blessed Experiences) the assured
knowledge, That the more our Adversaries wrestle to deprive us of the Blessing
and Inheritance (for the Revelation of the most exceeding Mercies of our Father
to us, through the prosperity of the Life and Glory of his Power in us) the
more are we strengthened in Him; that also by it, if happily our enemies may
come to see the certainty of the Lord on our side, and thereby be converted
unto the Grace of his Goodness, and saved by the incomprehensible Work of his
Wisdom, in the pitties of the bosom of his Mercies.

Ah my Beloved! This is the Love indeed wherewith you are beloved of the
Father, and of me his poor, needy, hungry and thirsty Servant, which opens unto
you and in you the Doors of the twelve Houses of the Heavens which you know;
The first is Judgment and Fearfulness; the second, Humility and Lowliness; the
third, Meekness and Mercifulness; the fourth, Temperance and Savouriness; the
fifth, Patience and Setledness; the sixth, Hope and Resolvedness; the seventh,
Faith and Perseverance; the eighth, Peace and Quietness; the ninth,
Thanksgiving and Remembrance; the tenth, Prayer and Watchfulness; the eleventh,
Glorification and Praises; and the twelfth, Content and Fullness.

Now therefore all ye Lambs of the Flock of the Shepherd's Pasture, look well
into that house in which you are made inhabitants, and by the Virtue of
Covenant is yours, as a proper possession, that you may see the glory of the
sign thereof, which shows you the perfect Signs of the Times; yea, and look
again and again, and lo the Canopy of Gladness, together with the Curtains of
Joys, and Bed of Pleasures, in each of them is an immensity too vast for your
aspect to reach the utmost thereof, whereby you may perceive something of the
incomprehensible Renown; (Viz.) What an honor of honors is it to be one
(though but as the least) in the House of the Lord, wherein the World with its
fullness stands entirely in subjection to a thought!

Ah! the Dominion, yea the glorious Dominion of Love which is obtained in the
Acts of his Championism! Surely the sense of his Strength is able to catch you
into Raptures, and overcome your souls in the Heavens of his Supreme Authority,
and through the constriction and violence of Ravishments to make you cry out
with the loudest lift-up voices, saying, Hail, O Jerusalem, and Help, O ye
Inhabitants of her City, for the forcibleness of Love is upon me. Oh! Oh! Oh!
Love is the strongest, Love is the powerfulest even of all the Supernal Hosts;
yet my Beloved, you shall all remember in the days of the Floods, when the
Banks of your Rivers are filled up to the brims, that then even in them days
you shall in no wise say, How can my Love be greater, seeing my Current runs
brim-full? but rather contain the recordance as the Memorial of a Covenant in
you, that the streams of your Rivers have the passage of their influences in
the Valleys beneath the risings of the Hills, and therefore shall thirstily
wait for your Floods (through the rentings open of the Fountains of the
greatest Deeps) to surmount, until they have covered the Hills above you; yea
procelsively to ascend as in the highest heaps over the loftiest Mountains of
the Earth, that the Ark of Salvation may swim on tops of all, without danger of
shipwreck by bulgings; and yet wait without wearisomness in the sensibleness of
their Movings, until they are mounted from a stream in the Valleys, to have
reached the Upper Waters which are locked within the Windows of the Heavens,
that the Ark of your Rest may safely arrive to anchor in the Haven of Zebulon;
And so let this cast you into the bosoms of Affection, and become a Covenant of
Unity in the virtue of an eternal Oath in the bottoms of the bowels of each
other. And so the everlasting God of Heaven and Earth enrich you with the
Treasures of the Love of his own Life, which is Incomprehensible and Infinite,
and seal you in such a nearness of relation and dearness of affinity in the
holy Unity in such an inward manner, as that always you may stand at the motion
of a moment, prepared as ready Sacrifices to offer your lives for the Brethren;
and the Crown of Immortal Glory of the Father be your recompense in his Kingdom
of Life, Amen.

Daily are my Prayers increased for you, in all quarters of the Earth, and the
abundance of my Spirit does often minister amongst many.

Finally, dear Lambs, Wait all to receive the Spirit of Supplication, and of
Prayer, and in that same holy Spirit present me in your living breathings to
the pitiful God of all our Mercies: for his eternal Eye does well know that I
am weak and poor, having no strength but from him, nor wisdom without him, but
in him: And therefore again, I say (in the importunity of a beseeching soul)
pray without ceasing for your poor bruised and often oppressed Brother. And O
ye holy Witnesses of the Lord our Righteousness, my pure and living Brethren
and Sisters, the dear sympathized suffering Prisoners! my reins are a current
and stream running forth with willingness toward you, in the tenderest
compassions of God's Life of Love, which melts my bowels, casting mine eye of
remembrance upon you: Ah! it is your Faithfulness, yea, it is your Integrity in
the Covenant of Righteousness that is the Virtue which reaches me at this
distance, renting my soul for your sakes, to whom it is not only given to
believe, but also to suffer for the Witness of the Power of the most High:
Verily your Crown must be certain on your head, and a Fountain of the Treasures
of Life must assuredly compass you as an everlasting Reward of your Service.
For he is infallibly just and righteous, and his Covenant is Faithfulness,
Amen, who has called and drawn you to glorify him in the virtuous sanctified
Life of your blessed Trials and Tribulations: for no man can suffer for God for
naught; but his Righteousness will be a Recompense unto him.

O my dearest Companions, I am most inwardly in the nearest feeling with you,
and am made a true partaker of your conflicts: besides, the God of our
sustentation knows with how many tears, sighs and groans, with numberless
prayers, and holy fervent requests and spiritual desires I have remembered you,
and still do supplicate that in the Faithfulness you may all be kept to the
end, and continually exercised in the spirit of thanksgiving and praise to God
for all things, and to dwell in the life and power of Contentation, which is a
Mansion of most infinite latitude, where a perfect fullness of strength is
partaked of and possessed, which gives victory over all the world.

Summarily, The sound of New England Sufferers, and the fame of the Indian
Martyrs in the Continent of Virginia, has pierced to my bottoms within me: O
let it be as a Razor's edge to our desires, and as a Spur like a Spear in our
sides, pricking us on in the eagerness and swiftness of our race, that we who
have started and put on at first and ran in the course before them, may not in
the end fall short of the Glory of their Crown, which is great in the Kingdom
upon them.

So all dear Plants of God's Renown in all Quarters of the Earth, the most
Mighty be always on your side, and his Supremacy at your right hand, and his
eternal Omnipotency save you from all evil, Amen.

THE END.
