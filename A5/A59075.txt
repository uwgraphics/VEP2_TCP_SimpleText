A BRIEF DISCOURSE TOUCHING THE OFFICE OF Lord Chancellor OF ENGLAND.

WRITTEN BY The Learned John Seldom of the Inner Temple, Esquire and Dedicated by
him to Sir Francis Bacon Knight, then Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of ENGLAND.

Transcribed from a true Copy thereof, found amongst the Collections of that
Judicious Antiquary St. Lo Kniveton, late of Grayes Inn Esquire

TOGETHER WITH A True Catalogue of Lord Chancellors, and Keepers of the Great
Seal of England, from the Norman Conquest, until this present Year, 1671.

BY WILLIAM DVGDALE, Esquire, NORROY King of Arms.

LONDON, Printed for William Lee at the Turks Head in Fleet street, over
against Fetter-lane end, 1671.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE Sir FRANCIS BACON Knight, Lord Keeper of the Great
Seal of England.
MY LORD,
THE Times obvious discourse, whereby that All which truly loves Nobless or
Learning congratulates your highly deserved Honor, caused me collect these,
taken out of no obvious Monuments, touching the auncientest mention,
conjunction, and division of those two Great Offices of State which your
Lordship really bears, though styled but by the name of one: they are short,
yet give large testimony of the former times. They conclude with an Act made
about 320. years since, of like tenor in substance with that later under Queen
Eliz. which was as proper to your name, whence these also were the fitter to
offer you: Enough, other particulars touching both these Great Offices might
have been added, but these were chosen for the usual Question of the present,
and thus are given (not yet seen by any other eye) as a taste of my humble
Observance. My Lord, they are only yours, as their Author would be,

J. Seldom.

A BRIEF DISCOURSE TOUCHING THE OFFICE OF Lord Chancellor of England, etc.
The Name and Office of Lord Chancellor of England under the Saxons.
THE eldest mention in good authority of the name of Chancellor of this
Kingdom, is in Edward the elders time, Temp. Edw. senioris and sequentium
Regum. Ingulphus.
about the year DCCCCXX. he made Turketill Abbot of Croyland his Chancellor.
Cancellarium suum eum constituit, ut quaecunque negotia temporalia vel
spiritualia, Regis Judicium expectabant illius consilio and decreto (nam tantae
fidei et tam profundi ingenij tenebatur) omnia tractarentur, and tractata
irrefragabilem sententiam sortirentur. This Abbot held the Office under
Athelstan, Edmund and Edred succeeding Kings.

King Ethelred afterward divided the Chancellorship between the Abbots of Ely,
Temp. Ethelredi.
and St. Augustine in Canterbury, and of Glastenbury, who were to exercise it
by turn. The words of an Old Monk of Ely are, Statuit atque concessit quatenus
Ecclesia de Ely extunc and semper in Regis Curia, Cancellarii ageret dignitatem
quod and aliis, Sancti viz. Augustini and Glasconiae Ecclesiis constituit, ut
Abbates istorum Coenobiorum vicissim assignatis succedendo temporibus annum
trifarie dividerint, cum Sanctuarii and caeteris ornatibus Altaris ministrando:
So as the Abbot of Ely, or some Monk by him appointed, exercised the Office
from Candlemas four months yearly, and the other two of Glastenbury and St.
Augustines made up the twelve.

But there occurres not any subscription in Charters by that name, till the
Confessor, in his Patent to the Church of Westminster; after the King, Bishops,
Abbots, and others, comes Ego Rembaldus Cancellarius subscripsi.

Yet in the ancientest Monument of a Grant by any King extant here, I doubt not
but the Chancellor subscribed, though under another name.

The first Christian King of the Saxons founded and endowed Canterbury Church,
Temp. Ethelberti.
and in his Charter amongst the Earls, occurrs Ego Augemandus Referendarius
subscripsi; where Referendarius may well stand for Cancellarius, the Office of
both (as the words applied to the Court are used in the Code, Novells, and
Story of the declining Empire) fignifying an Officer that received Petitions
and Supplications to the King, and made out his Writs and Mandates, as a Custos
Legis: And though there were diverse Referendarii, as 14. then 8. then more
again, and so diverse Chancellors in the Empire; Yet one especially here,
exercising an Office of the nature of these many, might well be styled by
either of the names. These are testimonies of that time without exception,
though Polydore begin the Name and Office at the Norman Conquest.

II. Whether the Keeping of a Seal, were in the Chancellorship under the Saxons.
FOR that Principal part of the Office, or that other Office joined with the
Chancellorship, the Keeping of the Seal; If the common Opinion were clear, that
under the Saxon State no Seals were here used, then were it vain to think of it
as of that time. But there is yet remaining an Old Saxon Charter of King Edgar,
Edgar.
beginning, A Orthodoxorum vigoris Ecclesiastici monitu creberrime instruimur,
etc. to the Abbey of Persore, wherein diverse Lands are given, and there remains
in the Parchment plain signs of three Labells by the places cut for their
being hanged on: and of the selfsame Charter a testimony also as ancient, that
the Seals were, one of King Edgar, the second of St. Dunstan, and the third of
Alfer Ducis Merciorum. That testimony is in a Letter from Godfrie Archdeacon of
Worcester to Pope Alexander III. writing of that Charter, and the Authority of
it: Noverit, says he, Sanctitas vestra, verum esse, quod conscripti hujus
scriptum originale in virtute Sanctae Trinitatis sigilla tria, trium personarum
autenticarum, ad veritatem, triplici confirmatione commendat; Est autem
Sigillum primum illustris Regis Edgari; secundum Sancti Dunstani Cantuariensis
Archiepiscopi; tertium Alferi Ducis Merciorum; sicut ex diligenti literarum
impressarum inspectione evidenter accepi. And it is reported by those which have
searched the Records of St. Denis Church in France, there remain two Charters,
the one of one Offa, the other of one Edgar, with Seals annexed; the one of
which I have seen cast off in Lead, and is about the breadth of a Shilling
thick, and having a face on the one side. Likewise amongst the Chartae
Antiquae, diverse being reckoned cum Sigillo, others sine Sigillo; one is cum
Sigillo of King Cnout, neither is there any color of doubt but that the
Confessor had his Seal, for the Print yet remains in part to be seen. But
notwithstanding these singular examples of Kings Sealing in the Saxons times,
it is most certain it was not a thing common then; neither could any in the
Chancellorship be denominated from Keeping the Seal, nor in any other Office.
Curiosity in some particular occasion swayed more in it, than any Custom; In
the Register of Croyland it appears that the Normans brought in the use of
Seals to Charters.
Although we admit those before mentioned for true, which may well be doubted,
in regard of the frequent fraud and ignorance in committing it, which in the
elder times possessed the Churchmen. But for the Confessor's Seal, that was
without scruple certain, and thence may we confidently derive the Great Seal of
England.

III. Testimonies of the Chancellorship and Keepership joined, in times near
after the Norman Invasion.
AS in the Monuments of the Confessor Rembald is named Chancellor; Will. 1.
so under the first William, Maurice Bishop of London, and in the succeeding
times others. Old Stories of the Monks sufficiently mention them. But little
appears of the Office till the time of H. 2. under whom, one writing the life
of Thomas Beckett that was Lord Chancellor, has this most ancient testimony of
it, and of Keeping the Seal also; Cancellarii dignitas est, ut secundus a Rege
in regno habeatur; ut altera part Sigilla regii, quod and ad ejus pertinet
custodiam, propria signet mandata, ut Capella Regia in illius sit dispositione
et cura, ut vacantes Archiepiscopatus, Episcopatus, Abbatias and Baronias
cadentes in manum Regis ipse suscipiat and conservet; ut omnibus Regis assit
consiliis, etiam non vocatus, accedat; ut omnia Sigilliferi Clerici regii sua
manu signentur: Item ut suffragantibus, ex Dei gratia vitae meritis, non
moriatur, nisi Archiepiscopus vel Episcopus si voluerit: Inde est quod
Cancellaria non emenda est. And another of the same time, Cancellarius sicut in
Curia, sic and ad Scaccarium magnus est; adeo ut sine ipsius consensu vel
consilio nihil magnum fiat vel fieri debeat: verum hoc habet officium dum
residet ad Scaccarium: Ad ipsum pertinet custodia Sigilli regii, quod est in
Thesauro; Sed inde non recedit nisi cum Praecepto Justiciarii, (that is Chief
Justice of England that was a Viceroy) ab inferiore ad superius Scaccarium, a
Thesaurario vel Camerario defertur ad explenda solum negotia Scaccarii; quibus
peractis in loculum mittitur, and loculus a Cancellario consignatur, and sic
Thesaurario traditur custodiendus. Item cum necesse fuerit, signatus sub omnium
oculis Cancellario offertur, nunquam ab ipso vel ab alio alias offerendus. Item
ad ipsum pertinet rotuli, qui est de Cancellaria, custodia per suppositam
personam. Another about the time of Edw. 1. Officium Cancellariae viro provido
and discreto ut Episcopo vel Clerico magnae dignitatis debet committi, simul
cum cura majoris Sigilli regni, cujus substituti sunt Cancellarii omnes in
Anglia, Hibernia, Wallia and Scotia. Omnesque sigilli regii custodes praeter
Custodem Sigilli privati.

IV. Of the Division and Conjunction of Lord Chancellor and Lord Keeper, till
an Old Act made that they should be One.
BUT for that of Cancellaria emenda non est, Cart. 14. Joh. dorso. Walt. deGray
Cancellar. and alii missi ad Othonem Imp. nepotem Regis Johannis.
an example not long after was, not only in truth to the contrary, but entered
also in Public Records; For Walter de Gray of the Family of the Greyes of
Rotherfeld in Oxfordshire, In dorso sin. 7. Joh.
in 7th of King John, Dat. Domino Regi quinque millia Marcarum pro habenda
Cancellaria Domini Regis tota vita sua; and pro habenda inde Charta Domini
Regis. Pat. 14 Joh. m. 5. Carta Regis W. de Carrio de domo sua de Carrio etc.
Test Will. de Brewer apud Westminster. 21. Maii. Carta Regis Joh. facta Mauricio de
Gant de Manerio de (...)* Test or Dat. per manum Radulphi de Nevill apud
Buttevill 28 Julii an. 16. Pat. p. 2. m. 8. Et ibid. m. 4. Ric. de Mariscis
Cancellarius.
So are the words of the Roll, and the days of Payment are set down also; and
in the Rolls of the same year occurrs, Hic recepit W. Gray Cancellaria. Yet had
he not always the Custody of the Seal, for in the Charter Roll of that Year
after the taking his Chancellorship there is but one Patent or Charter dated by
him, as the fashion then was, with Dat. per manum W. de G. Cancellarii nostri,
or the like.

Those that both follow and precede, Pat. 17. Joh. m. 2. ^. de Mariscis
Cancellar.
are Dat. per manum Hugonis de Wells Archidiaconi Wellensis, who, it seems, 28
Apr.
kept the Seal: and therefore he is expressly called the King's Chancellor in
some Monks that writ of that time, Et ib. in dors. idem Cancellarius missus
Rom^m.
as others are for the same cause: Neither was it ever heard of them to have
the Chancellorship granted, Cart. 18. Joh. Rex dedit Baldwino de Guisne
Manerium de Benefeld etc. Dat. per manum Magistri Ric. de Mariscis Cancellarii
nostri apud Nareas 30 Maii.
yet the Seal still to Remain in another hand. For also while this W. de Gray
was Chancellor, Richard de Marisco whom Matthew Paris calls Chancellor too, and
others misreckon him for one had the keeping of the Seal, the Roll is nono die
Octobris anno regni Domini Regis 15. Liberavit Magister Richardus de Marisco
Archidiaconus Richmond. and Northumbr. Domino Regi Sigillum apud Ospring; Pat.
15. Joh. p. 1. m 8. Et fin. m 5. Walt de Gray Cancellar. Ib. m. 5. Idem factus
suit Episc. Wigor.
and then on the 22. of December. following, apud Windlesores liberatum fuit
Sigillum Domino R. de Nevill, deferendum sub Domino P. Wintoniensi Episcopo,
that was Peter de Roches or de Rupibus Chief Justice of England. But this here
out of the infallible testimony of Records touching W. de Gray, differs not a
little in time from the relation of the Monk, notwithstanding the Seal thus
committed to Ralf de Nevill who had it also under H. 3. in the beginning of his
Reign, totius Regni ordinante consensu and consilio; Pat. 18 Joh. m. 5. Ric. de
Marisco Cancellar. 14 Julii.
yet the Patent and other Charters and close Letters of the time, are, for the
most part, Per Rectorem Regni, or Test P. Wintoniensi Episcopo, or T. H. de
Burgo Chief Justice of England under H. 3. Per eundem; or Per P. Wintoniensem
Episcopum, or the like. And yet also in Rolls of that time, Cart. 17 Joh. m. 3.
Ric. de Mariscis Cancellarius.
where Nevill never at all makes the Test, or has his name added, mention is
of him for other uses as belonging to the Office of Chancellorship, as the
delivery of the Counterbriefs to him and Fines, etc. mittend' in Scaccarium,
according to the use of that age. But although both Records and Story thus make
R. de Nevill Lord Keeper from King John unto H. 3. yet had not he any Patent of
either Chancellorship or Keepership till 11. H. 3. Cart. 11 H. 3. p. 1. m. 28.
where both a Patent of the Keeping of the Seal for life, either by himself or
Deputy, and another of the Chancellorship of England toto tempore vitae suae,
were made to him, both bearing the same Date.

Yet after this also, An. 13 H. 3. The King granted to R. Bishop of Chichester
the Chancellorship for life, 16 Nov.
through diverse oppositions in State against the goodness and Noble Carriage of
this Ralf de Nevill, the Seal was after unjustly taken from him, and restored
again as his former right. And likewise to the same R. the same office, An. 16
H. 3. 14 Julii. And by another Charter of the same date the Custody of the Seal
for life also, to exercise that Keepership in person, or by an assignee.
And in 20 H. 3. the King would have had it from him, Sed idem Cancellarius
(says the Monk) hoc facere renuit, videns impetum Regis modestiae fines
excedentem; dixitque se nulla ratione hoc facere posse, cum illud communi
consilio Regni suscepisset. Quapropter nec illud similiter sine communi assensu
Regni alicui resignaret: Yet in 22 H. 3. the King violently took it from him,
and committed it to one Godfrey a Templar, and John of Lexinton; Emolumentis
tamen (so says the Story) ad Cancellarium spectantibus, Episcopo quasi
Cancellario, redditis and assignatis. Afterward one Simon Norman a Lawyer had
it: and from him it was taken, and committed to Richard Abbot of Evesham, who
kept it three years, and then resigned it in 26 H. 3. The Chancellor and Keeper
(of right) Nevill was afterward reconciled to the King, and dyed 28 H. 3.

In the Acts of Parliament of which year, one is, Vide etiam Cart. 17 H. 3. pro
eodem Episcopo de eisdem Officiis pro termino vitae suae.
That the Keeper of the Seal should be always the Chancellor, and that all
things sealed otherwise should be void. The words are, Si aliqua interveniente
occasion Dominus Rex abstulerit Sigillum suum a Cancellario, quicquid fuerit
interim sigillatum, irritum habeatur and inane, Deinde Cancellario fiat
restitutio. And it appears otherwise that they always took it unjustly done,
if the Chancellorship and Keepership were not in one: By Reason whereof, before
that, in a Charter of King John's yet extant in some hands, of the Moderation
of the Fees of the Seal, no person is spoken of but the Chancellor and his
under Officers; as if it could not have been but that who ever had the Seal,
the same should only be Chancellor.

According to that the Chancellorship and Keepership were joined in all the
Chancellors under Henry the 3 and Edward the 1. most of which being made
Bishops, resigned their Seal and Office, although afterward under the
succeeding Kings sometimes the Seal was committed to others hands upon some
requiring occasions; and some Lord Keepers were created in later times before
Sir Nicholas Bacon, in whose time that Statute of 5 Eliz. was made.
