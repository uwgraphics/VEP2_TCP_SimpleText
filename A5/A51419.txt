CONFESSIONS AND PROOFS OF PROTESTANT DIVINES OF Reformed Churches, That
EPISCOPACY is in respect of the Office according to the word of God, and in
respect of the Use the Best.

TOGETHER With a brief Treatise touching the Original of BISHOPS and
METROPOLITANS.

Printed in the year, 1662.

TO The Pious and Religious Reader, Grace and Peace in Christ Jesus.
THe matter subject of this Treatise being yet in suspense, and to be
determined de future, viz. What Ecclesiastical Government is to be judged to
be, according to the Word of God, in respect of the office it self, and also
the Best in respect of its use: After that, upon more and more deliberation, I
had perfected my conlusion, the saying of Augustine came into my mind, He that
concealeth a truth, and he that teaches a falsehood are both guilty: the first
because he will not profit; the other because he intends to hurt and delude:
which I apprehend as a double caution, both of not publishing any Utopian
Ecclesiastical form of Government of mine own forging, as also, of not
stifling, by my silence, a form truly Apostolical.

Which Resolution, notwithstanding, I did not adventure to take, before that I
was fortified in my persuasion by a general consent of Protestant Divines of
reformed Churches, and among others, in some principal points appealing to the
Divines of the Church of Geneva; Nor yet do we so much insist upon their
Confessions as upon their Proofs, especially being grounded upon two infallible
foundations. The first, the general verdict of Antiquity, as well Doctrinall as
Historical: Though we should not name that general Council of Calcedon
consisting of 630 Fathers, which by one Canon decreed it to be a Sacrilege to
press down a Bishop into the degree of a Presbyter. The same Council that did
also ordain another Canon, which was then the very break-neck of Romish
Popedom.

2. The Authentical Texts of Scripture so far as thereby to demonstrate Christ
his own approbation of Episcopal Prelacy after his Ascension in the Churches of
Asia: in one whereof without all contradiction was one Polycarpus Bishop and
Martyr.

As for the Churches, whereof we are to speak, the Tractate has been
undertaken in behalf of Protestant Churches, which practice at this day the
same Prelacy under these two diverse names of Episcopacy and Superintendency, as
much exceeding the number of those which are destitute of Bishops, yet so, as
justly condemning the Romish Hierarchy (rather Tyranny) poisoned with most
gross Idolatry; and not so only, but so far opposite to the Episcopacy which
we defend, that it is a false Usurpation, that all Bishops be originally
deduced from the Pope, and dependant upon him. Other Churches destitute of
Bishops we differ from, yet not so (far be it from us) as not to account them
essential Churches of Christ, but to whom as formerly, we do desirously give
the right hand of Brotherly fellowship; to join against the common and grand
adversary in the Romish Babylon.

Concerinng other points circumstantial we have provided, that our Method be
with coherence, our Still plain and even, our Allegations direct and punctual,
our Authors justly approveable, our Taxations toothless, and our Inferencies
brief, pertinent and consectary.

As for you (good Christian Reader) his hope is, that he shall not need the use
of the Apostles Expostulation, saying, Am I your enemy because I tell you the
truth? And his prayer to God shall be to protect and bless you, to the glory
of his saving Grace in Christ Jesus, that he also will distribute to this our
lacerated Church, some portion of that his peerlesse Legacy left unto his
Apostles, when he said, My peace I leave with you, by virtue whereof, we may
with one heart and mind faithfully worship God in Spirit and in Truth.

The judgment of Protestant Divines, of remote Churches, as well such as were
the first Reformers of Religion, as others after them in behalf of Episcopal
degree in the Church.
THis they perform, both by their direct and ingenious confessions, and after
by sound and solid Proofs, so far as to show Episcopal Prelacy to be According
to Gods Word, as also to acknowledge the same for use to be the Best kind of
Ecclesiastical Government. We are, in the first place, to try their plain
confessions concerning the said Prelacy, as well in special, for our English,
as touching Episcopacy in general, in what Orthodox Church soever, and
afterward to adjoyn the proofs.

1. THESIS.
That our English Episcopacy has been justified by the confession of the most
learned Protestants of remote Curches, in special by the Church of Geneva.
OUr Episcopal Prelacy we are sure was professed, and practiced by Bishops.

1. In the days of King Edward the 6. who as they were the principal Authors
of the Reformation of our Protestant Religion, so did some of them seal the
truth of their profession with their blood, and have therefore been with others
thus extolled by that golden mouth of the French Church Moulin epist. ad Episc.
Winton. Quorum Martyrum habemus scripta, and meminimus gesta, ac zelum, nulla
ex part inferiorem zelo praestantissimorum Dei servorum, quos Germania, aut
Gallia tulit: hoc qui negat, oportet ut sit vel improbe vecors, vel gloriae Dei
invidus, vel cerebrosa stoliditate caliget in clara luce.
Master Moulin saying, That they were for zeal nothing inferior to the most
excellent servants of God, that Germany or France ever had; which (says he)
none will deny is so, if not wilfully stupid and blinded in daylight. Yea, and
touching those then Archbishops and Bishops Bezae Respons. ad Sarav. de Minist.
gradibus, c. 18. p. 303. Quod si nunc Anglicanae Ecclesiae instauratae suorum
Episcoporum and Archiepiscoporum authoritate suffulta praestant, quemadmodum
hoc illi nostra^ memoria contigit, ut ejus ordinis homines non tantum insignes
Dei Martyrs, sed etiam praestantissimos Pastores, ac Doctores habuerit.
Beza for the Church of Geneva. It happened in our memory, that she (speaking
of our English Church) has had men of that calling, not only constant Martyrs
of God, but also excellent Pastors and Doctors.

2. In the days of Queen Elizabeth, Calvin the most illustrious star of the
Church of Geneva, doubted not to instile Archbishop Cranmer Calvin epist.
Cranmero, Te praesertim (Ornatissime Praesul) qui altiori in specula seeds, in
hanc curam incumbere necesse est. Scio non ita unius Angliae haberi abs te
rationem quin universo orbi consulas.
A most accomplished Prelate (says he) who has the cure, not onley of
England, but also of the whole Christian world, which he did to the dignifying
of the Government of our English Church; and no marvel, seeing that he durst
profess to yield, in behalf, even of Popish Bishops, upon condition, that
renouncing the dependence upon the Pope, and acknowledgment of Christ as their
only Head, with profession of his Truth Calvin. tom. 7. ad Sadoletum, and de
necessitate reformandae Ecclesiae, p. 69. Verum talem nobis si contribuant
Hierarchiam in qua^ emineant Episcopi, ut Christo subesse non recusent, ut ab
illo t^nquam ab unico capite pendeant, and ad ipsum referantur, in qua si
fraternam charitatem inter se colant, and non alio modo quam ejus veritate
collegati, tum vero nullo non Anathemate dignos fatemur si qui erunt, qui eam
non reverenter and summa cum obedientia observent.
. Then shall we profess all them (says he) who shall not reverently and
willingly submit to their Government, to be worthy of whatsoever Anathema or
curse. So he, even in his Tractate of Reformation of the Church, at what time
also Beza after his congratulating the restitution of our Protestant Religion
in England, earnestly desired the whole Clergy under the Government of Grindal
then Bishop of London, to Beza ad Grindal. Epist. 23. ut omnibus praesulibus
suis ex animo obsequantur: majori poena digni sunt qui Authoritatem Tuam
aspernabuntur. Idem rursus ad Sarav. upon the consideration of the Government
by Archbishops and Bishops. Fruantur sane ista^ Dei beneficentia^, quae utinam
sit illi nationi perpetua.
submit unto him, holding him worthy of much punishment who should despise his
Authority. Yea, and so well did he approve of the then Government by
Archbishops and Bishops, as to wish it might be perpetual unto them. This is
cited by the Author of the Survey of the pretended holy discipline, etc. Beza
apud Sarav. de Minist. gradibus, p. 343. c. 21. Nedum, ut quod falsissime and
impudentissime nonnulli nobis objiciunt cuiquam uspiam Ecclesiae sequendum
nostrum peculiare exemplum praescribamus, imperitissimorum illorum similes, qui
nihil nisi quod ipsi agunt, rectum putant.
Sadell likewise, who is sufficiently commended by his excellent writings in
defense of the Protestant Religion, did join together with Beza in an Apology
to vindicate themselves from a sinister report, as if they had detracted from
the Right of Government by Archbishops and Bishops, avouching the same
aspersion to have been a most impious slander. And Pet. Martyr Epist. praefix.
Juelli Apol. Amplissime Praesul, and Domine mihi quotidie etiam atque etiam
observande.
Bishop Jeuell, how was he honored by Peter Martyr, calling him A most
renowned Prelate; and by Sibbrandus Sibrand, contra Grotium p. 183. citatus a
Nicholao Videlio. lib. de Episcopat. Constantini magni p. 25.
Lubbartus, entitling him The Ornament, not only of England, but also of the
whole world?

Zanchius in Epist. ad Elizab. Anglia Regin. Cogitet Tua Majestas in hoc omnem
Tuam curam, potentiam and authoritatem intendere, ut imprimis Episcopos habeas
pios, and in Sacris literis eruditos, ficut Dei beneficio habes quamplurimos,
eosque soveas and audias.
Hierom Zanchee, one in the opinion of our Opposites (we doubt not) worthily
renowned, in his Letters to Queen Elizabeth, he exhorts her Majesty with an
imprimis, and especially to extend her care, power and authority, to have godly
Bishops, skillful in holy Scriptures, of which sort (says he) by the blessing
of God you have already very many: and to cherish and hear them. Idem Epist.
Edmund Grindall^ Episcop. non possum non gratulari novam and amplissimam
dignitatem: quoniam ista sunt divinae benedictionis Testimonia and constantis
Tuae in Deum pietatis, qua ejus beneficentia cura Tua magis magisque in vera
Religione and pietate promoveri possit.
Also in his Epistle to Archbishop Grindall, upon occasion of his remove to
Canterbury, he expresses his joy for that access of dignity, as a testimony
of Gods love toward him, and a means whereby he might more and more promote
Gods true Religion. Our Opposites ought not to be offended with us, although we
offer unto them next an Author, somewhat distasteful unto them at the first
hearing, namely Saravia de Minist* gradi bus in Epist. ad Lectorem. Saepe
miratu^sum eorum sapientiam, qui Anglicanae Ecclesiae restituerunt divinum
cultum, and ita se attemperarunt ut nusquam decessisse ab antiqua and prisca
Ecclesiae consuetudine reprehendi possint Et in Epist. Dedicatoria. In part
foelicitatis Regni Anglica ut numerandum est, quod hunc Ordinem Episcoporum
retinet.
D. Saravia, because as he is a Religious Divine^ and as un-Episcopall as any
other, so also is he as Orthodox, everywhere, as they know, inveighing against
the Romish Hierarchy; he confesses himself to wonder at the wisdom of the
Reformers of Religion in England, So as not any where deviating from the
ancient Church of Christ; and concludes with this Epiphonema, saying, I hold
it a part of her happiness that she has retained with her the order of Bishops.

3. In the reign of King James, that famous Isaac Casaub. Regem alloquens, in
praefat, ad exercit. Qui Ecclesiam ^abeas in Tuis regnis partim jam oli^ ita
institutam, partim magnis Tuis laboribus ita instauratam ut ad florentis
quondam Ecclesiae formam nulla hodie propius accedat, quam Tua: inter, vel
excessu, vel defectu peccantes, median viam sequu^a. Qua^ moderatione hoc
primum assecuta est Ecclesia Anglicana, ut illi ipsi qui suam foelicitatem
invident, saepe tamen ex altarum comparatione illam cogantur laudare. Idem
Epist. ad Card. Beron. Reg. Brit. nomine sed ex animi quoque sui sententia,
Certo ac liquido mihi constat, si notae (...) quaerantur, and vere necessaria
ad Salutem spectentur, ut etiam ad decorum Ecclesiae, nullam in orb terrarum
(Deo uni sit laus and gloria) inventam, quae propius ad fidem, aut speciem
antiquae Ecclesiae Catholicae accedat, etc.
Isaac Casaubon, whom we reckon as the fourth witness from the Church of
Geneva, had that estimation of our English Episcopal government, as to
confess, That no Church does come nearer the form of the primitive Church,
then it does: so far that even they who envyed her happiness, are
notwithstanding constrained to extol it. He proceeds furthermore to blazon the
worthiness of it. If (says he) the essential part of the Church be enquired
into, and what either necessarily belongs unto the Doctrine of Salvation, or
else to the decency of the Church, then (praised and magnified be God) no
Church upon earth can be found, which more professes the faith, and resembles
the form of the ancient Catholic Church, then it does. So he.

But to return to our French witness again: worthy Master Moulin in his
Buckler of Faith. p. 271.
Master Moulin, in an answer to a Papist, who upbraided him with the discipline
of England, does avouch the dignity thereof, telling him furthermore, That
their agreement is such, that England (says he) has been a refuge to our
persecuted Churches, and correspondently the excellentest servants of God in
our Churches, as Peter Martyr, Calvin, Beza, and Zanchee, have often written
Letters full of respect and amity to the Prelates of England. So he.

Lastly, now under our Gracious Sovereign King Charles in the time of
Archbishop Abbot, Whose daily experience did testify the reciprocal
correspondence between him, and with other Bishops and all reformed Churches
beyond the Sea. At what time likewise Cyrill, late Greek Patriarch of
Constatinople, did so far honor both him and our English Church, as to
profess his accordance therewith, more specially then with any other. And if
our Bishops of later date had not been respected, then surely would not the
Divines about Breme in Germany have sent their controversies had among
themselves, only unto certain Bishops in England (as they did) to have them
moderated by their judgments, not to speak of their dedications of some of
their Books unto Bishops. These last Relations nothing, but the importunity of
these times, could have extorted from us. Thus much of particular respects had
in special to our English Episcopal Government, by singular approved Divines
of the reformed Protestant Churches. In the next place, as the thread of our
method leads us, we are to examine what they will say touching the
unlawfulness, or lawfulness thereof in general.

II. THESIS.
That there was never any visibly constituted Church in all Christendom since
the Apostles time for 1500. years and more, which held Episcopacy in it self to
be unlawful.
WE are not ignorant that even at this time, all Episcopacy, and Prelacy of any
one above Presbytery, is cried down by some as unlawful in it self, August de
Aeri^ lib. de Haresi cap. 53. Quia non potuit Episcopus ordinari, dicebat
Presbyterum ab Episcopo nulld differentia debere discerni.
notwithstanding our Opposites cannot but know what, besides Epiphanius, Saint
Angustine recorded of one Aerius, to wit, that he, because he could not obtain
to be made a Bishop, did therefore teach that there ought to be no difference
between a Presbyter and a Bishop. So he: and for that cause they listed him
among the erroneous Authors of that Age, but (he being excepted) never any
visible Church of Christ before him, we add, nor yet any thus protested after
him, nor before these days of contradiction defended his opinion. Now whether
the humor of desire to rule others, and the unwillingnesse to be subject unto
others, may not equally transport some Ecclesiastics to oppose against
Episcopacy, they can best judge whom it most concerns. We know (beside
infinite others, who have acknowledged the lawfulness of Episcopacy) some
protestant Divines of remote Churches, who have fully condemned the opinion of
Aerius. Three may suffice for three hundred if they be learned and judicious
Authors, and not interested in that which is now called Episcopal policy. Mr
Moulin in Epist. 3 ad Episc. Winton. Ab incunabulis Aerium damnavi.
Master Moulin comes on roundly: I have since my infancy (says he) abhorred
the opinion of Aerius. Tylenus in paraenes. Ante Aerium de Episcopis
exautorandis nemo, post Aerium solum Genevenses studebant.
Tylenus also a Divine of the French Church as pertinently and plainly. None
ever before Aerius endeavored the extirpation of Episcopacy, nor yet after him
any, but some of Geneva. What some he might mean we know not, but whom he
might not mean we have already shown, as Calvin, Beza, Sadle, and Causabon,
who have given their ample suffrages for our English Episcopacy, but only speak
against the Romish Hierarchy: And now, for the generality of it, Beza de
Minist. gradibus. p: 2. Si qui sunt (quod sane mihi non facile persuaseris) qui
omnem Episcopatus Ordinem, ut Tu scribis, reliciunt, ab sit ut quisquam sanae
mentis furoribus illorum assentiatur. Idem si modo deformatam domum Dei
adamussim ex verbi divini Regula pro viribus instaurarent, ut Ecclesiae
Christianae fidos pastores, cur non agnoscamus? observemus? and omni Reverentia
prosequamur?
Beza is again at hand, saying, If there be any, as I think (says he) there is
not, who altogether reject the Episcopal Order, God forbid that any of sound
brains should ever assent to their furies: and besides, protests his
acknowledged observance, and all reverence to all Bishops reformed. Hitherto
against the objected unlawfulness of Episcopacy in the Church of Christ. But
this will not satisfy some men, except furthermore the lawfulness thereof may
appear in that degree which is called in respect of its right, According to the
Word of God. It belongs unto us to show this by the Confession of Divines of
remote Protestant Churches, which we are ready to perform, and more too.

III. THESIS.
That Episcopal Prelacy is acknowledged by Protestant Divines of remote
Churches to be according to the Word of God, and their consent therein unto
Primitive Antiquity.
LVther may well be allowed for the foreman amongst the Reformers of the
Protestant Religion, Luther. tom* 1. fol, 309. Resolut. ejus super
propositionibus Lypsiae disputationibus habitis, conclusio. Probo quamlibet
civitatem habere debere Episcopum proprium jure divino, quod ex Paulo ad Titum
ostendo, dicente hujus rei gratia, reliqui te Cretae, ut quae desunt corrigas,
ut constituas simplices Presbyteros per civitates sicut ego disposui tibi, Hos
autem Presbyteros fuisse Episcopos. Hieron, and textus sequens ostendit,
dicens, oportet Episcopum irreprehensibilem esse.
who proves the Prelacy of Episcopacy above simple Presbyters (for so he
says) by Divine Right; and this he does in his Tract^te called his Reselution,
grounding his judgment upon Scripture, whereof hereafter. Accordingly Bucer,
against the Pope as Antichrist: Bucer, de Regno Christi lib. 2. cap. 12. Ex
perpetua Ecclesiarum observatione ab ipsis Apostolis videmus visum hoc esse
spiritui Sancto, ut inter Presbyteros unus Ecclesiarum and totius Sacri
Ministerii gerat curam singulorum, and cunctis praeerat aliis qua de causa
Episcopi nomen hujusmodi Ecclesiarum Curatoribus est peculiariter attributum:
tametsi hi sine Presbyterorum consilio nihil statuere debuerant qui and ipsi
propter hanc communem Ecclesiarum ad minist. rationem Episcopi in Scripturis
vocantur.
We see (says he) by their perpetual observation of Churches, and from the
Apostles themselves, that it seemed good to the holy Ghost that some singular
one should be appointed among the Presbyters to Govern in so sacred an Order,
who has for the same cause, the Appellation of Bishop in Scripture. Scultetus
the Divine, Professor at Heidelberg, professing Episcopal degree to be of
divine Right, and professes to prove it to be such by efficacious reasons, who
in the sequel of his discourse will be as good as his word; with whom agrees
that admirable Scholar Isaac Casaubon, Exercit, Episcopi, Presbyteri, Diaconi
apertis Scripturae testimoniis sunt sundati. Ibid. Apostolorum hodie vicarii
sunt, etsi non pari potestate cum Apostolis omnes Episcopi, ut e B. Cypriano
antea dicebamus Exercit. 14. Cyprian, Ep. 65. Apostolis vicaria ordinatione
succedere Episcopos.
Isaac Casaubon, the ornament of Geneva, who held the same to be grounded upon
the Testimonies of Scriptures. These may serve for the present till we come to
a larger consent.

All these, and other the former confessions of Protestant Divines, are the
proper idiom and language of primitive Antiquity, teaching thus. Episcopacy is
by the Ordination of Christ. So Ignatius illam formam Episcopalem (...) Test
Sculteto in Titum.
Ignatius: and again, Cyprian Epist. 65, ad Rogat* Quod si nos aliquid sacore
contra De^um audemus, qui Episcopos facit; Et Epist. 27. ad Laps. cum igitur
divina lege fundata sit etc. Epist. ad Cornel. Ecclesiae gubernandae sublimem
ac divinam potestatem.
Reverence your Bishop as Christ and the Apostles have commanded you. Or thus,
To be a divine power, the resistance whereof is against God himself: So
Cyprian. And thus, God placed Bishops over His family: So Origin, tract. in
Mat. 31. cognoscunt Episcopi quod hoc non vos salvat, quod constituit eos
Dominus super familiam ejus, etc.
Origin. And thus, The Apostles were made Bishops by Christ, who ordained
others (meaning Bishops) in other places, by whom the Church should be
governed: August. in quaestion. veter. and novi Testamen. page 97. Nemo ignorant
Salvatorem nostrum Episcopos instituisse, quando Apostoli facti sunt, qui missi
sunt ut mittere possint alios; ipse enim imprimis Apostolis instituit Episcopos.
So Augustine. Or thus, Epiphanius adversus Aerium (...) De Heresi. 75.
Bishops constituted over Presbyters, as the Word of God teacheh: So
Epiphanius. And thus, August. lib. 7. contra Donatist. cap. 42. De Apostolis a
Christo missis, quibus nos successimus eadem potestate Ecclesiam Dei
gubernantes: and de Verb. Domini Sermon. 24. Qui vos spernit, me spernit etc.
None can be ignorant that Bishops were instituted by Christ when he made His
Apostles, by whom others should be made Bishops, whom we succeed, and (speaking
of Bishops) of whom Christ said, he that despises you despises me: So again
Augustine.

Before we end this point we shall desire our Opposites to bethink themselves
what they think may signify the suffrages of the Fathers of the Synod of
Calcedon, for Antiquity, one of the first four General, and in this generality
universally received throughout Christendom, for amplitude consisting of six
hundred and thirty Bishops, and for averseness against the Pope of Rome, that
which undermined the very foundation of Romish Popedom, which is a pretense of
having been established by the divine Authority of Christ the universal Bishop
of the Church, and equalling another Patriarch with him, and showing that all
the Primacy which the Pope of Rome had, was but from humane Authority. This
Council* Calced Can. 29. (...).
Council concerning Episcopacy ordained, that To depose a Bishop down to the
degree of a Presbyter, is Sacrilege.

This so great a Harmony, between the former Protestant Divines, and those
eminent Fathers, how shall it not sound delightful unto every docible and
unpreoccupated hearer? These confessions notwithstanding, we have not
discharged our Assumption, until we produce their proofs, which is to be
performed according to our former promise, after that we shall manifest the
like confessions of Protestant Divines and accordance to Antiquity, in
acknowledging Episcopacy to be the best form of Government in respect of the
use thereof.

IV. THESIS.
That Episcopal Government in the Church, is, in respect of the necessary use
thereof, the best by the consent of Protestant Divines of other reformed
Churches.
SOme peradventure will conceive, that three at the least being required in the
degree of comparison, to make up a best: Therefore our three must be taken
either for Episcopacy, which is a Prelacy of one above more; or Presbytery,
which is an equality of more among themselves; or that which is called an
Independency, of one in each Parish without relation to any other. Which
mis-begotten brat was never heard of in ancient times, or approved of any
latter Church of Christ since; and indeed is but the erecting of a Pope in
every Parish, whereof something See hereafter.
hereafter. It will be sufficient that we understand a best in the full
latitude with comparison of whatsoever other.

Our Protestant Witnesses we rank into two Classes; First is the Church of the
Lutherans, who were the first Reformers of our Protestant Religion. Luther;

nomine dignor. Lup^s enim and canes appellare op^rtes, and fol. 320. Nemo

If our Reader will be pleased but to cast his eye upon the Marginalls, he may
find out these following observables, viz. that Luther will be known, when he
complained of Bishops, to have meant over tyrannous (P^pish) Bishops, and them,
(as he says) who are unworthy of the Holy name of Bishop; next, that all
Protestant Churches of Germany in their general Confessions, had (as they say)
often protested their earnest desire to conserve the discipline of degrees in
the Church by the Authority of Bishops, whereby to remove dissentions and
Schisms from the Church, then that Phil. Melanct Hist conf. Aug. page 365.

Melancthon, by the persuasion of Luther, was as much bent for Episcopal
Government as any, when he burst out into this expression; I would to God it
lay in me to restore the Government of Bishops, for I see what a Church we
shall have, the Ecclesiastical Policy being dissolved, I foresee it will be
far more intolerable then ever it was. There is added to this the
acknowledgment of Bucer; holding it necessary, that the Clergy have those
(speaking of Bishops) to whom the Authority of the Church is committed: His
reason, least that refractory and dissolute persons should be in the Church.
Prince Hanolt, after he became a sincerely professed Protestant and faithful
Preacher of the Gospel, speaking of Bishops, that would be faithful in
Governing the Church: Georgius Princ. A^bolt Concion. In praefat. de
Ordinatione Test Saravia page 267. utinam si^ut gerunt nomina and titulos, ita
so reipsa praestarent Episcopos Si fideliter Ecclesias regerent, quam libenter,
quantaque cordis laetitid, pro Episcopis ipsos habere, revereri, morem gerere,
debitam jurisdictionem and ordinationem eis facere, ea^ que sine ulla
recusatione frui vellemus.
How willingly, and with what gladness of heart, would we (says he)
reverence, obey, and yield them their ordination and jurisdiction, the which we
and Luther have very often protested, both by word and writing.

We now pass unto the other Classes of Protestant Divines, of Reformed
Churches, beginning with Calvin himself, who has a double intuition concerning
Presbyteriall Government. One as it may be considered is in an Independency; so
that every one have a Right of excommunication in himself: Calvinus Epist. ad
Gasparum Magnum u^ile fuit jus excommunicandi permitti singulis pastoribus,
nunc ea res odiosa est, and facilis est lapsus in Tyrannidem, and Apostoli
alium usum tradiderunt.
this he calls, unprofitable, odious, and such as easily turns into
Tyranny, and contrary to that which the Apostles taught. Next beholding them in
a joint parity, he relates the reason of the first beginning of Episcopacy,
and says truly, Calv. instit^ lib. 4. cap. 2. and Tom. 7. fol. 218.
Presbyterum in suo numero ex singulis civitatibus unum eligebant, cui
specialiter titulum Episcopi dabant, ne ex aequalitate ut fieri solet, dissidia
nascerentur.
that by the parity and equality among Presbyters, (as it uses to be) Schisms
and dissentions might arise among them. This Parenthesis [as it uses to be]
which he inserteth, certainly has in it a sting, which pierces into the
Bowels of the cause. Successor to Calvin was Beza, who thus far succeeds
him also in his opinion, as Beza de diverse. Ministrorum gradibus cap. 23. apud
Sarav. p. 386^ Ipsa tandem experientia compertum fuisse, non satis virium eos
habuisse ad improbos compescendos; communicata viz. singulis pastoribus per
vices hujus Primatus dignitate: Ergo visum fuit ad unum, and illum quidem
totius Presbyterii judicio, delectum transfer, quod certe reprehendi non
debet, cum praesettir^ veinstus hic mos fuit in Alexandrina Ecclesia, jam inde
a Marco Evangelista observatus esset, and rarsus. Absit ut hunc Ordinem, etsi
mera divina dispositione non constitutum, tamen aut ut temere, aut superbe
inventum reprehendam, cujus potius magnum usum fuisse, quandiu boni and Sancti
Episcopi Ecclesiis praefuerunt, quis inficiari poss^t?
to confess (as he says) from experience, this of the Presbyterian
Government, that it being not sufficient to repress vices, choice was made of
one to Govern the rest, as was observed anciently (says he) from the Evang.
Mark in the famous Church of Alexandria: Again, speaking of the institution of
Episcopacy, whatsoever it was, he will be known to abhore and reprehend it, as
erected by pride: but why? for none can deny (says he) but that there was
great use of it whilst that goodly and Godly Bishops were chief over others.

We may well presume (as was said) that the other part of the misquoted
sentence of Zanchie is extant in some Impression of his Works, wherein he did
so symbolize with the forecited Sentence of Calvin, Citat per Petrum Moulin:
filium Hieron. Zanch. Thefibus de vera reformandarum Ecclesiarum ratione.
Testor me coram Deo in mea conscientia non alio habere loco quam Schismaticorum
illos omnes, qui in part Reformationis Ecclesiarum ponu^t nullos habere
Episcopos, qui authoritatis gradu suos compresbyteros emineant, ubi liquido
possint haberi. Praterea cum D. Calv. nullo non Anathemate dignos censeo,
quotquot illi Hierarchiae, quae se Domino Jesu submittit, subjici nolunt.
Testifying before God (for these are the words) that he holds them
Schismatics, who shall determine, that in the restoration of Churches there
ought to be no Bishops, having authority over Presbyters, where freely they may
be had. He proceeds furthermore, I think with Calvin says he, them to be
worthy of whatsoever Anathema, who will not be subject to their Government,
which submits it self to Christ; So he. Furthermore concerning the
testimonies, as I may so say, of Ecclesiastical Government, Zanchius page 7.
in sua Confessione. Quid cortlus ex historiis, ex conciliis, ex omnium patrum
scriptis, quam illos Ministrorum Ordines, de quibus dicimus cum totius Reipubl.
Christiana consensu in Ecclesia constitutos and receptos fuisse? Quis autem ego
sum qui quod tota Ecclesia approbat improbem? neque omnes docti viri nostri
temporis improbare ausi sunt, quippe quod norunt and licuisse hac Ecclesia, and
ex pietate atque ad optimos fines pro aedificatione electorum ea omnia fuisse
perfecta and ordinata^ quid quod in Ecclesiis Protestantium non desunt Episcopi.
Zanchie confessed Episcopacy to have been ordained for the best end, to wit,
the edification of the Elect. The sentence of Calvin has been formerly
alleged; Unto these we add the saying of the proloquutour in the Synod of
Dort, who is rendered unto us, by them that heard him, to have wished, that the
Church with them were so happy as our English, by having an Episcopal
Government among them. This case was so evident to a late Advocat for
Presbyters, Salmasius by name, that although he relucteth justly against an
irregular Prelacy, yet does he freely and ingenuously grant, that Wallo, alias
Salmasius lib. de Episc. p. 413 Episcopus Ecclesiis regendis unicus praepositus
est qui and Presbyteris pluribus unius Ecclesiae praeesset. Bono fine hoc
institutum esse nemo negat, cum optima ratio fuerit ita instituendi.
the preferring of one Bishop in every Church, was instituted with best reasons.

Would any see more? Then he is to observe the Protestation made by the German
Divines in the Augustane confession, protesting their desire for the
conservation of Episcopacy; whereof it is testified by a Conradus Verstius in
Apol. Pro Eccles. Orthodox; de Augustan. Confess. page 285. in Colloquio
Possiaceno Augustanae confessioni per omnia se subscribere paratos esse,
testati sunt praeterquam Articulo doctrina de Eucharistia, utpote obscurius
posita.
Theological professor, that other Protestants were ready to subscribe to the
Augustane Confession, (per omnia) excepting only the Article of the Eucharist,
because it was not clearly explained: among these Protestants he names Calvin,
Beza, Vermilius, Marlorat and Zanchius, which probably could not have been
altogether true, if they had been adversaries to the foresaid Protestation.

Before we can conclude, we return to Geneva to be satisfied in a main
question; which is, whether the form of Government in Geneva ought to be
perscribed as a pattern to other Reformed Churches to be regulated thereby:
And when we consult with Beza c. 21. page 343. apud Sarav. Quod falsissime and
impudentissime nonnulli nobis objiciunt, cuiquam uspiam Ecclesiae sequendum
nostrum peculiare exemplum praescribamus, imperitissimorum illorum similes, qui
nihil, nisi quod ipsi agant, rectum putant.
Beza about this very point, he tells us, that this opinion was imparted to
their Church, but in the name of the whole Church of Geneva rejects it as a
most false and impudent exprobration. After this comparison made by weight and
ponderation, we seek to try what may be done by computation and numbering.

V. THESIS.
That the most Protestant Cburches do profess and practice a Prelacy over
Presbyters.
MAny now look upon our English Bishops as birds upon owls, yet not
peradventure so, as they for strangeness or for reverence; but with left eyes
in an opinion of singularity and onelinesse, as a thing not acknowledged in
other remote and reformed Churches of Protestants; not considering what has
been published to the world long-ago, that the word Superintendent is of the
same signification with the word Bishop: both from the same Greek, (...). Yet
some Protestant Churches practicing a Prelacy, vail it over with the word
Superintendency: If we would know what, Zanchius in sua confessione, fuit mihi
praterea habenda ratio illarum etiam Ecclesiarum, quae licet Evangelium
complexae sint, suos tamen, and re and nomine habuerunt Episcopos, quos
(mutatis benis graecis nominibus in male Latina) vocant Superintendentes and
Generales Superintendentes; sed etiam ubi neque vetera illa bona Graeca neque
haec nova male Latina verba obtinent, ibi tamen solent esse aliquot primarii,
penes quos fere tota est Authoritas. Sed cum de rebus convenit quid de
nominibus altercamur? Test Sarav. de Ministrorum gradibus, c. 23. p. 365.
Zanchie will speak out and to the purpose, in telling us that Episcopi (whom
we call Bishops) and Superintendents, are words of the same sense and
signification: and therefore where there is an agreement in the thing
signified, there ought not to be any altercation and strife about words. But
what will he say to the practice? He distinguishes Protestant Churches in this
respect into three differences, some whereof practice a superiority of one
above the Clergy under the proper name of Bishops; another sort the same, but
under the name of Superintendents and General Superintendents, whom we call
Archbishops. Lastly, he discloseth a third kind, (a circumstance very
remarkable) who although they avoid the Titles of Bishops or Superintendents,
yet use they to be such primarii, as to say, eminent in Prelacy, as in whom
(for so he says) the whole Authority consists. Now therefore our question
must be, whether the Church exercising Prelacy, or the other that only
practice equality, exceed in number.

The number of Churches, which had Prelates under the name of Bishops, and the
other of Superintendents (being in signification the same) seemed to Greg. de
Valentia, the Jesuit, so many, that he thought all Protestant Churches to have
Bishops.

An excellent servant of God Doctor Duraeus, and a zealous hunter after the
best game, which is, the general peace of Protestant Churches among themselves,
has set down a Catalogue of the Churches reformed on both Parties, and
reckons (if he be not mistaken) seven Bishops in the Kingdom of Swede: in
Denmark Bishops, in other Lutheran Churches Superintendents, and in all
Imperial Cities among the Protestants, besides diverse other reformed Churches
the like; which we suppose will rather keep their conformity with England, then
taste new wine with others, seeing that, as the Text says, Luke 5. 39.
The old is better: and whether the Episcopal form be not the only and
Apostolical, comes now to be discussed by inquiring into Antiquity.

VI. THESIS.
That the former reasons of Confessions of Protestant Divines, concerning the
necessity of Episcopal Prelacy, for preservation of concord and preventing of
schism, is correspondent to the judgment of Antiquity.
IT would be worth our knowledge to understand, that the former Confessions of
Protestant Divines are, in effect, but the ecchoings unto the sentences of
ancient Fathers. Among whom, Hierome could tell us, Hieron in Epist ad Evag^
Omnes Episcopi (ubicunque sunt locorum) Successores sunt Apostolorum. Ad Evagr.
Quod postea unus est electus, quae praepon^retur caeteris, in Schismatis
remedium factum est, nequisquam ad se trahens Ecclesiam Christi corrumpat.
That the original of Episcopacy (which is the placing of one Presbyter in a
degree above others) was decreed throughout the whole world, for taking away
Schism: which use thereof was held so necessary in the days of Antiquity,
that the said Hierome spared not to affirm, Hieron. advers. Lucif. Ecclesiae
salus ex summi Sacerdotis dignitate pe^det, cui nisi exors quaedam and ab
omnibus ^minens detur potestas, tot in Ecclesia efficientur Schismata quot
Sacerdotes.
That the safety of the Church depends upon the dignity of a Bishop, to whom,
except some eminent Authority be given, there will be as many Schisms as there
are Priests in the Church. So he, and before him Tertullian thus, Tertull. lib.
de Baptismo, Episcopus propter Ecclesia honorem, quo salvo salva est Pax.
The Bishop is for the honor of the Church, which being in safety, our peace
will be also safe. But how Nyssen. Hom. in Ecclesiast. ut Chorus ad Coriphaeum
respicit, nempe suum ductorem, nauta ad Gubernatorem and Acies ad Imperatorem;
ita etiam ad Ecclesiam qui praesunt in coetu Ecclesiae. Chrysostom. orat. in
dicta Apostoli, Omnia in gloriam Dei. Quemadmodum Chorus Praecentorem, and
nautarum multitudo Gubernatorem requirit, sic and Sacerdotem coetus Pontificem,
etc.
Chrysostom and Gregory Nyssen do illustrate, both affirming the same
necessity of a Bishop in the Church, as is a Precentor in a Quire, a Governor
in a Camp, and a Pilot in a Ship. By which Episcopal order (says Basil. in
Epist. ad Eccles. Ai. de Episcopis Membra Ecclesiae hac dignitate tanquam una
qua^em anima in concordiam, and communionem reducantur.
Basil) the Church is reduced as one soul into communion and concord: yea and
before all these; Cyprian Epist. Vnde Haereses, unde Schismata, nisi quod
Sacerdoti dei non obtemperent, qui est loco Christi Judex. Idem Epist. 55.
Actum est de Episcopatus vigore, and de Ecclesiae gubernandae sublimi ac divina
potestate, etc. (where he speaks of himself, and not of the Bishop of Rome.)
Cyprian Bishop and Martyr, complained of such insolences of Presbyters
against their Bishops, as being causes of heresies and schisms against a
divine power of Government. So he; These, will some say, are but their sayings,
and shall we therefore think that their sayings were not the symbolls and
expressions of their meaning; but we presume better of them that are ingenuous,
and the rather for their further satisfaction which may be had in the next
Thesis.

VII. THESIS.
That Bishops primitively were not only the chiefest champions for the
Christian faith, but also the greatest adversaries to Romish Popedom, as have
also our English.
BEfore we can begin the proof of this Thesis, we are confronted by our
Opposites against Primitive Fathers in strange terms, Smestym. in their
vindication.
Bishops by advancing the authority of Episcopacy did thereby (say they) but
plead their own cause, and made a stirrup for the Romish Antichrist to mount
into his Pontifical saddle. So they. Which contumely against the reverend
antiquity, we are loath to call by its proper name; being therefore not to
reprove others, but to prove what we have in hand, which is that some of the
ancient Bishops lived in the torrid zone of fiery persecution, and others in a
temperate. Of the first sort we have it confessed, That the persecuting
Emperors did, above all others, make their Inquisition and exercises of their
furies most especially upon Bishops; we have it upon record in Cyprian, but
much more in other Ecclesiastical Histories, wherein, as is confessed by
Brightman ^n Apocalypse. Dioclesian te. poribus erant atrocissimae clades, sed
tamen fideles ad extremum certamen constanter perstiterunt, reportantes
Trophaea victoriae corporis stigmata.
Master Brightman, although Dioclesian in his Edict, did especially command the
destruction of all that had taken sacred Orders, yet in a further Complures
Episc. insignes erant in Concilio Nicaeno; and rursus qui historiam scripsit,
meminit centum and sexaginta Episcoporum qui in Sagasan^ extincti sunt, and in
provincias edicto Regis proferantur ut delerentur universi qui sacros ordines
habuerint.
speciality the massacring of Bishops; he relates that one hundred and sixty
of them were martyred in two places; yea, and in the Church of Rome it self is
also reckoned the number of 160. Bishops, who were martyrs of Christ in those
primitive times. To fancy that these afflicted and persecuted Members of Christ
for their degree sake, could pride it in their Episcopal office, would be held
to be but a dream, they will rather think, that if they should prelate it, (as
Mariners use to frolike it) rather in a calm of tranquillity; but for this
also we shall easily subcribe to the judgment of Master Beza, who when he was
thus posed, whether he should impute the note of pride unto these Primitive
servants of God, (whose names have always been celebrious in the Church of
Christ (to wit) Basil, Nysen, Nazianzen, Athanasius, Chrysostom, Ambrose, and
Augustine, who are known to have afterward had Episcopal Government in their
several Churches) answers, saying, Beza de Ministrorum gradibus, c. 25. page
543. apud Saravian. Neminem adhuc audivi loquentem, neque legi scribentem, qui
non honorifice, sicut par est, de magnis illis suorum temporum hominibus
sentiat: nempe Nazianzeno, Nisseno, Basilio magno Athanasio, Cypriano,
Chrysostimo, Ambrosio, Augustino.
I never heard any speak, or read any write otherwise then honorably of those
men, as was meet. So he, of his time; he could not prophecy of the future. It
were good, that these who use this new and broad language had considered, Iren.
lib. 5. adversus haeres. cap. 20.
That Bishops were then almost the only ones, who, as occasion fell out, either
pulled the Romish Pope out of his Saddle when he was mounted, or else plucked
away his Stirrup, that in those times he could not get up. For whereas
Popedom, being a double usurpation, one of plenitude of Authority, See the
book entitled, The Romish Grand Impostor, throughout.
universal over Bishops; and the other of an infallibility of judgment in
determining all Controversies of Faith, it has been evidently and copiously
proved, that the amplitude of his Diocese was limited by three hundred Bishops
in the General Council of Nice. His pretended right of Universal Authority
was contradicted an. 553. by six hundred Bishops in the Council of Calcedon,
where we find it accounted to be but of Humane Authority against his pretended
universal challenge of appeal to Rome, it was twice contradicted by Bishops
in two Counsels in Africa; and as for his pretended infallibility in
judgment, the 165 Bishops in the Council of Constantinople condemned the
Decree of Pope Vigilius; and in the sixth and seventh Counsels, consisting in
all of 603. Bishops, was Pope Honorius condemned for an Heretic. We may not
omit the mention of singular persons Bishops, who have had their solemn
oppositions against the Popes of their times, Cyprian, Athanasius, Basil,
Cyrill of Alexandria, Hilary of Arles and Augustine, with many others. But what
talk we of Bishops in other Sees? seeing we have in the Sea of Rome it self
one, who did prejudice the pretended and usurped dignity and authority of all
his Successors in condemning the pretense of the highest Title and Prerogative
which the Pope does challenge, which is to be called The Universal Bishop of
Christ's Church, by judging it to be proud, profane, and blasphemous, and the
Bishop we mean was Pope Gregory the first, whom Mr. Brightman has adorned with
this Encomium, Mr. Brightman in Apoc. cap. 8. 13. cited hereafter.
The flying Angel mentioned, Apoc. 8. 13. whose luster, says he, God would
use for the Church. As for our Church of England since the Reformation, it has
been conformable to the Primitive. Surely greater faithfulness could not be
shown then in the seal of Martyrdom, nor more opposition to Popedom, then to
cut off all dependence upon it by the neck ever since, nor this more by any
then in Bishops, as our Ecclesiastical monuments have recorded; not to mention
the writings public in confutation of all Popish Errors and Heresies, only
let it be lawful for us to point at the last Synod and Convocation was
vehement against Popery, as (for this is spoken by him that was absent from it)
any one may read. After these Confessions of Protestant Divines, we are to
ascend higher to our proofs, for evincing the same to be according to the word
of God, as Apostolical; first from Antiquity, and after from the word of God it
self.

Our first proof, that Episcopacy is according to the word of God, by
manifesting it to have been of Apostolical Institution by necessary reasons.

VIII. THESIS.
That to be of Apostolical Institution, argues in it a divine Right, by the
confession of excellent Divines of the Reformed Churches.
FRom the Church of Geneva, we have before us Mr. Beza to deliver his own
words. Beza tractat. de Minist. gradibus c. 23. Cert^ si ab ipsis Apostolis
esset profecta haec mutatio, non vererer illam ut caeteras Apostolicas
Ordinationes divinae in solidum dispositioni tribuere.
Surely if Episcopacy had proceeded from the Apostles, I would not doubt to
ascribe unto it a divine Ordinance. So he. This is plain; Secondly, from the
Churches within the Palatinate, Scultetus by name, argues accordingly.
Scultetus observat in Tit. esse juris divini. Ratio. Apostolos prafixisse
Presbyteris Episcopos.
The Apostles placed Bishops above Presbyters, and therefore is Episcopacy of
divine Institution. A third, properly called Salmasius, out of the University
and Church of Leiden in the Low Countries, one of great fame, and a professed
friend unto our Opposites; and notwithstanding confesses, saying, Walo, alias
Salmasius lib. de Episc. page 422. Institutio Episcopi si ab Apostolis, est
Jure Divino.
If the Institution of Episcopacy (says he) be from the Apostles, then it is
of divine Right. So they. Certainly, because what power was ordained by the
Apostles proceeded from the Spirit of God: like as was their decree against
Strangled and Blood, their Holy-kisse, their Agapae, and the like in their
first Institution.

And although these were abrogated in time, yet the necessity of perpetuating
Episcopacy, stands upon two grounds; one, is the first reason of institution
thereof, which was, for avoiding Schism; the other was, the universal
continuance thereof from age to age, upon experience of the same reason: Which,
as we have heard, has been held most reasonable to almost all Protestant
Divines of remote Churches. Now therefore, that which we are to make good is
only our Assumption; to wit, that Episcopacy was of Apostolical Institution,
then which nothing almost can be more evinceable, if testimonies from
Antiquity, evidences out of Scriptures, and upon both these, the confessions of
Protestant Divines of the Reformed Churches may be held satisfactory, our first
endeavors concerning Antiquity for this performance, must be to remove
objections which our opposites cast in our way. The only peremptorily objected
Ancients are these two, Hierome and Clement, both whom we are now to salute.

IX. THESIS.
That no Ancient Father absolutely denied the Apostolical Original of
Episcopacy, no not the objected Hierome who will show himself a manifest Patron
thereof.
THe objected sentence of Hieron. in 1. ad Tit. Sicut Presbyteri sciant se
Ecclesiae consuetudine iis, qui sibi praepositi sunt esse subjectos; ita
Episcopi noverint se magis consuetudine, quam dispositionis Dominicae veritate
Presbyteris esse majores, and in communi debere Ecclesias regere.
Hierome, saying, concerning Episcopal Prelacy, That it is rather by the custom
of the Church, then by the Lords disposal, is confessed by the Theological
Protestant Professor in the University of Heidelberg to be understood Scultet.
observat in Tit. ^8. Nisi forte consuetudinem Ecclesiae pro consuetudine
Apostolica, et dispositionis Dominica veritatem pro instituto Christi capiat.
by the decree of the Lords disposal; the immediate ordinance of Christ, in his
days upon earth, and affirming the custom, happily to have meant the
Apostolical custom, after they began the forming and framing of the Churches.
However, for this one place objected against us, we have many most evident
Testimonies out of Hierome himself, to prove the first institution of
Episcopacy to have been indeed Apostolical.

First is from the original occasion, whereunto he alludeth, even the
contention in the Church of Corinth, when Hieron. in 1. Tit. Antequam Diaboli
instinctu studia in Religione fierent diversa inter populos, Ego sum Pauli, Ego
Apollinis, Ego Gephae, communi consilio Presbyteris Ecclesiae gubernabantur
postea autem in toto terrarum orb decretum est ut unus ex Presbyteris electus
superponetur saeteris.
some held of Paul, some of Appollo, some of Cephas, whereof it is confessed by
the foreceited Palatinate Doctor, Scultetus in Tit. hoc caeptum est viventibus
Apostolis, prior Epistol. ad Corinthios nos dubitare non finit.
That the words of the Apostle will not suffer me (says he) to doubt but that
alteration was made in the days of the Apostles, and his confirmation is as
doubtless; namely, because no man can produce any other original of the
questioned Schism and contention. This is a chief point, and therefore we
desire to hear what Videlius in Epist. Ignat. ad Philadelphenses, cap. 14.
Discrimen illud Presbyterorum and Episcopi ut ex pluribus Epistolarum locis
apparet, tempore Ignatii fuit, etenim illud valde mature ipsorum Apostolorum
temporibus in Ecclesiam irrepsit statim postquam dici coeptum est, Ego sum
Pauli, Ego Cephae, etc. Test Hieronymo in Titum.
Videlius the Divine Professor in Geneva, will say unto it. He handles the
matter accurately, which is to be reserved to its proper place. In sum, out
of Ignatius the disciple of the Apostles he shows the difference of Bishop
and Presbyter begun timely in the Church, even presently after the contention
to the Corinthians, whereof it is said, some held of Paul, and some of Apollo,
and some of Cephas.

Secondly, Hierome grants in general, yet distinctly of Bishops, Hieron. in
Epist. ad Euagr. Omnes Episcopi (ubi cunque sunt locorum) successores sunt
Apostoli.
That they are the Successors of the Apostles.

Thirdly, yea he shows who were Successors in the very days of the
Apostles, reckoning among others, As they are set down in their diverse Titles
in his Book De Ecclesiasticis scriptoribus.
Timothy, Titus, Polycarpus and Euodius.

Fourthly, He relates who were first Bishops of all others after them, to wit,
Idem de script. Ecclesi. Jacobus minor Hierosolymitanus Episcopus, Marcus
Ecclesiae Alexandrinae primus Episcopus.
James of Jerusalem, and Mark of Alexandria.

Fifthly, Idem Epist. ad Euag. 58. Aaron and filii summi Sacerdotes and us
Aaron, Eleazar, and Levitae, juxta traditiones Apostolicas hoc sunt Episcopi,
Presbyteri, and Diaconi.
he alleges the Analogy between Aaron and his sons in respect of the
Levites with Bishops and Presbyters, from (as he says) Apostolical tradition.

Sixthly, the Idem ad Ruper ^ advers. Vigilant. Miror sanctum Episcopum in
cujus parochia Presbyter esse dicitur, a^quiesc^re furori ejus, and non virga
Apostolica and far confringere vas inutile.
Episcopal part of Excommunication against Vigilantius he calls His
Apostolical Iron Rod. So Hierome. It were incredible if that all these
Apostolical Relations concerning Episcopacy, should not amount unto so much as
to make up an Apostolical Institution thereof.

The second objected Father, is Clement, whereof their success will be no
better, if not much worse.

X. THESIS.
That Clement an Apostolical Disciple, to whose arbitrament both our Opposites
and we offer to yield our selves, does patronize Episcopacy, as being
Apostolical.
WE are earnestly called upon to hearken unto Clement, Smectym. vind. page 136.
talking of a prophecy of a future contention which should happen about the
name of Bishop. Next, That there is no piece of Antiquity of more esteem, then
the Epistle of Clement unto the Corinthians. Then; That this was brought to
light by a learned Gentleman Mr. Patrick Young: and lastly for the matter it
self, That there is a common and promiscuous use of the word Presbyter and
Bishop.

We shall answer punctually to every one, viz. The Prophecy makes for us, the
Epistle much more, the Publisher also as much as can be desired, and that
Objection of the indifferency of the Words of Bishop and Presbyter is scarce
worthy the mention.

We begin with the Prophecy* The Prophecy was only, that there should be in
time to come, a contention about the word Bishop. If we should ask our
Opposites, when this contention was first known in times of old, they would be
loath to tell us, knowing right well, that it was first raised by one Aerius, of
whom Epiphanius and Austin have See above.
told us, that he broke out into Schism, and See above.
because he could not obtain to be made a Bishop, did therefore spurn against
Episcopacy, teaching, says St. Austin, that there ought to be no difference
between Bishops and Presbyters; therefore thus they may see the Prophecy
fulfilled, both when, and in whom, if they like it. But if any shall boast,
that it is fulfilled now by their present Opposalls against Episcopacy, after
that it has had approbation with a continual use universally in the Churches
of God: Then have we nothing else to reply, but what the spirit of God, from
the pen of the holy Apostle, puts in our mouth; If any be contentious (says
he) we have no such custom, nor the Churches of God, whereby the wilfully
contentious makes himself an adversary to the Churches of God, and
consequently no way acceptable to God himself.

The second point which we are to discern, is that, which they call identity
of names of Bishops and Presbyters: they should have called it community of
names, especially knowing that there is no more identity in the words
Presbyters and Bishops, then there is between the letters of P. and B. But this
was a lapse: Therefore to our matter in hand. We answer, that mere names and
words make but verbal consequences, to which we oppose a real and Logical
consequence a paribus, thus: For of the very Apostles of Christ one instiled
himself Co-presbyter, another himself Presbyter, a third himself Deacon, who
are all common names with others that were not Apostles; and notwithstanding,
the Apostles themselves in respect of their offices and Functions were
Governors over Presbyters: which shows that the enterchangeablenesse of
names cannot conclude an indifferency of degree. But this ^rambe will be sodden
once again, when we shall be occasioned to give further satisfaction. As for
the present, it may well be said, what shall we need words, when we see Acts
and deeds, namely concerning this Clement? Not only that he maintained the
distinct degrees of Episcopacy, but that also he was distinctly above
Presbyters, a Bishop himself. Yet should not our Opposites pose us in that,
where Vedelius. Exercit. 8. ad Mariam in Ignatium, cap. 3. Lino and Cleto
defunctis ante Clementem, solus Clemens superstes, solus etiam Episcopi nomen
retinuit, tum quia inter adjutores Apostolorum solus ipse restabat, tum quia
jam invaluerat distinctio Episcopi and Presbyteri. ita ut caeteris Ecclesiae
Romanae Presbyteris, qui cum solo Clemente, essent, nomen id non fuerit
tributum.
Vedelius a Professor of Geneva gave them (if they have read him) some
satisfaction; showing, that as soon as Clemens remained the sole Adjutour of
the Apostles after Linus and Cletus, the name of Bishop was given unto him, and
not attributed to any Presbyter, or Presbyters in the Church of Rome. So he. Is
not this to the point; the distinguishing of times does solve many doubts. It
is meet now at length we hear Clemens himself speak. Clement immediately after
his relation of the aforesaid Prophecy, adds, saying concerning the Apostles,
Clement ad Corinth. Epist* p. 57. (...).
for this cause, they having a perfect foreknowledge, constituted the
aforesaid, and left a description of Officers and Ministers in their course,
who after that they themselves should fall asleep, other Godly men might
succeed and execute their function. So Clement. Whence it is evidently
collected, that Bishops were the successors of the Apostles, because a Role
and Catalogue of Bishops is frequently had in Ecclesiastical stories, lineally
deduced from the Apostles, as the most of the learned Protestants of the
Reformed Churches have ever confessed. But if our Opposites cannot prove the
like Catalogue of Presbyters of a primitive and right line of descent, then are
they wholly to yield the cause, and that even by the judgment of Clement, which
is now ready to be furthermore confessed by the exact learning of the Publisher
of Clement. This Gentleman, our Opposites call Learned, we owe him an higher
Title, even one exquisitely learned; he commenting upon the same Epistle of
Clement, now objected against Episcopacy, teaches that the right word (...)
agrees with the word census in Tertullian by whom it appears, that it was a
custom in Apostolical Churches to make a Role (for this word he held not
unfit) of the order of Bishops to bring them unto their first original, even
as, says Tertullian, Polycarpus, was from John the Apostle in the Church of
Smyrna, and Clemens, in the Church of Rome, from Peter, speaking even of this
our Clemens, and adds of others; and others (says he) whom the Apostles
constituted Bishops, from whom others might deduce their traductions and
offsprings; what is, if this be not, an inexpugnable convincement of our
Opposites to prove Episcopacy to be of an Apostolical Ordination? Yet is not
this all.

Clement is further represented unto us by the same learned Publisher, as one
registered and enrolled by antiquity as Bishop of Rome, in the Catalogue of the
same Bishops lineally descended from the Apostles, whether in the first, second
or third rank, it matters not; and the doubt, such as it is, is solved in the
Margent by our foresaid Geneva Professor: And for witnesses hereunto are cited
Optatus, Hierome, Ruffinus, Eucherius and Photius, set down expressly in the
same Book, which our Opposites have objected against us; which if you would not
see, or seeing not regard, all we shall say is, We are sorry for it: Yet after
this our retorsion of their objected Authors upon themselves, we shall
endeavor to give them further satisfaction from our selected and express
suffrages of Antiquity for the truth of Apostolical succession of Episcopacy.

(Salmasius by name) calls this alleadgment of James a Bishop false and
foolish: his reason was, because James was an Apostle, and therefore not to
keep residence in one See. First, be it known, that whatsoever this James was,
all Antiquity rendereth him unto us a Bishop of Jerusalem, (viz.) Eusebius

Synod of Trullo: How then shall it become us but of yesterdayes birth, thus to
pull reverend Antiquity by the beard, and give them the fool? Yet we may not
restrain rational men from reasoning, and therefore we answer, that were it
that Ia. had been an Apostle, yet other Protestant Divines of the reformed
Churches were no fools, as Dr. Scultetus observat in Tit. Jacobum ab Apostolis
Hierosolymorum Episcopum ordinatum testantur patres quam plurimi.

Moulin each one can answer; that notwithstanding the proper functions of the
Apostles, in visiting of Countries after Countries for conversion of people,
and founding of Churches; yet whether enfeebled by age, or upon extraordinary
occasions, they might fix themselves to one Province. But yet are we not
costrained to this answer; but furthermore tell our Opposites that, (which has
been Archiepiscopus Spalatensis, tomo quarto.
judiciously proved at large) that this was not James that Apostle, but James
the Brother of our Lord, and only an Apostolical Disciple, which may satisfy
our Opposites, until we come to speak of their objected Timothy and Titus,
called Evangelists; As for Mark, if in the line of succession of Bishops of
Alexandria, he only be taken exclusively, yet must the Ordinance of that See be
necessarily held Apostolical.

XII. THESIS.
That the Apostolical Antiquity of Episcopacy is confessedly proved out of
Ignatius.
VEdelius that learned Divinity Professor in the Academy of Geneva, Vedelius
professor Genevensis Apol. pro Ignatio cap. 1. Ignatius Apostolorum discipulus
erat; quem nemo negabit fuisse virum sanctissimum, Ecclesiae Antiochiae
Episcopum, et qui Christi veritati Testimonium praebuerit saevissimo mortis
genere sub Trajano Imperatore.
in his most elaborate work of Exercitations upon the Epistles of Ignatius for
vindicating his Doctrine from the false glosses of Bellarmine, Baronius and
other Romish writers, is copious in manifesting the direct judgment of
Ignatius in many notable points. Concerning Ignatius himself he rendereth him
unto us a Disciple of the Apostles, a Bishop of Antioch, an holy man, and a
faithful Minister of Christ. 2. Concerning the cause against Bellarmine, and
others who will have Bishops the first under the Pope of Rome, as the Apostles
were under Christ, this he confuteth out of Ignatius, who taught that
Presbyters should be subject to Bishops, and Bishops to Christ. 3. Against
Papists who proclaim the Pope to be Bishop of Bishops: he confesses Ignatius
holding the Bishop in every Church to be the next under Christ, and chief
therein. 4. The distinction between Bishops and Presbyters, Item Exercit. prima
in Ep. ad Trall. cap. 4. 4. Bellar. lib. 4. de Pontifice c. 25. Quemadmodum
Apostoli primi erant sub Christo, ita Episcopi primi sub Pontifice. Resp. Imo
Episcopi non sunt primi sub Pontifice, sed sub Christo, nisi Bellarmino
Ignatius mentitur, qui Episcopum nullam in Ecclesia habere supra se potestatem
dicit hac ipsa Epistola. Et Epist, ad Smyrnenses. (...). Ib. c. 9. number. 8.
Pontificii statuunt Papam ut Episcoporum Dominum: at Ignatii tempore maximus in

in Epist, ad Polycarp. Verba ejus mone^t Episcopu^ officii sui, ut agnoscat se

Talibus Episcopis and libenter paremus. (...).
was in the days of the Apostles: and lastly professes for himself and
others, that if they had a Bishop, such as was Polycarpus (a Disciple also of
the Apostles) they as Ignatius required of the Smyrnaeans, would willingly,
yea, necessarily obey him. So he. In this Maxim we behold two Disciples of the
Apostles, Ignatius and Polycarpus; both Bishops distinctly from Presbyters and
Governors: and this in the Apostles times. As well therefore may our Opposites
deny themselves to have depended naturally from their own parents, as Bishops,
originally from the Apostles. We are to pursue this yet a little further.

XIII. THESIS.
That Antiquity has given us Rules of Resolution for the knowledge of any
Apostolical practice, which may serve in the case of Episcopacy.
THe rule given by Antiquity, was always held Catholic throughout all
Christian Churches of ancient times. St. Austins rule may be our first
direction thus, August. de Baptism. contra Donatist. l. 4. Quod universa tenet
Ecclesiae, nec consiliis institutum, sed semper retentum est, non nisi
Authoritate Apostolica traditum rectissime creditur.
Whatsoever the Universal Church holds, and was not instituted by Councels,
but always kept, that must most rightly be judged to have been from
Apostolical Authority: So he: which for our purpose is as much as Dr.
Scultetus most judiciously and ingenuously confessed, that if no Interim can be
shown between the Apostles times, and the days immediately succeeding, when
there was no Episcopal Government over Presbyters in the Church, then must the
same have proceeded immediately from the Apostles. We hold this most
reasonable, even as if the Question were, what the practice is of the Country
adjoining unto us: Our next bordering neighbors to it, would be the most
competent witnesses of their manners, such have been hitherto our proofs even
from such Ancients, as either had seen the Apostles, or else from such as had
been conversant with the immediate Disciples of the Apostles. Our Opposites not
able to instance in the practice of any one Primitive Church to the contrary,
only object a community of names of Presbyters and Bishops, which shadow will
vanish, as soon as we shall give light by proofs of the Apostolical O^^gi^all
of Episcopacy in diverse Theses following by expression, confession and
Authorities.

XIV. THESIS.
That Protestant Divines of other Reformed Churches, have held it most equal
to be directed by the judgments of Ancients for proof of a practice
Apostolical.
WE plead no other equity in this cause, Calv Tract. Theol. Eccl^si. reform, a^
74 Iren^o and Origini negotium erat cum improbis nebulonibus* qui, dum pro
lig^o^os errores p^^^errent in (...), eos sibi divinitus rev^latos (...). Hujus
(...) facilis erat Revel^tio quo ^adhuc superstites erant multi, qui familiares
Apostolorum discipuli fuerunt: quibus rec^ns erat hujus doctrinae memoria, quam
Apostoli tradiderunt.
then what Calvin held necessary against Anabaptisticall Revelations, arguing
negatively in this manner, These lies (says he) are easily confuted, because
many were then living who had been conversant with the Disciples of the
Apostles. So he concerning Doctrines. How much more convincent must this
Argument be when our Question shall be of the practice of the Church in the
days of the Apostles? even as is daily done by all Christian Churches, for
p^oof of the practice of baptizing of Infants, against the same Anabaptisticall
Faction; yea, why not also for the like Original practice of Episcopacy, even
by the confession of Protestant Divines of excellent judgment: Beza de Minist
gradibus. Pro primatu Ordinis inter Presbyteros communicato ^^nguli p^storibus

p^esbyterii judicio delectum transfer, certe reprehendi nec possit, nec
deb^t, cum (...) ^^^ustus mos (...) primum presbyterum deligendo in Alexandrina
Ecclesia celeberrima inde a Marco Evangeli^^ observatus.
Beza must not be neglected, telling us, that he ought not to neglect the
Ordinance of a higher degree of a Bishop above a Presbyter, because this was an
ancient custom in the famous Church of Alexandria. So he. This is well, but he
has not quite told out his tale, which he does elsewhere out of the words of
B^za de Minist grad. c. 23. ^uod autem unus electus est qu^ ^aeteris
praeponer^tur, in Schismatis factum est Remelium, ne unusquisque ad se Christum

usque et Dionysium Episcopos, Presbyteri unum semper a se electum in cel^iore
gradu coll^catum Episcopum nominabant.
Hierome, saying namely, that in Alexandria, from Mark the Evangelist, one was
elected by the Presbytery, and placed in a higher degree, whom they named
Bishop, which was done for a remedy against Schism. Be it then that touching
this Series and order of Succession, as it was said of Saint Mark the Apostle,
be it taken inclusively, or exclusively; it necessarily implies, that the
Original of Episcopacy was in the days of the same Apostles. Master Moulin
gives us a louder Accent, saying, that Moulin Ep. 3. ad Episc. Winton. Non sum
adeo ^ris duri ut velim adversus illa veteris Ecalesiae Lumina Ignatium,
Polycarpum Cyprianum, Augustinum, Chrysostomum, etc. far sententiam, ut
adversus usurpatores muneris illiciti: plus semper apud me potuit veneranda
Antiquitas, quam novella cujusquam constitutio. See below. The like
acknowledgment will Beza give us hereafter.
he was never so hard faced as to censure these Bishops: Ignatius, Polycarpe,
Augustine, Chrysostom, and other great lights of the Church, to have usurped
an unlawful function in the Church of Christ; So he: Alleging among his
ancients Polycarpe and Ignatius; the first of which, as all the learned know,
lived in the days of the Apostles, and as antiquity it self teaches, and
consent of Protestant Divines of Remote Churches will afterward grant, to have
been in the days of Saint John the Evangelist, the Bishop of Smyrna. The
other, viz. Ignatius, was also acquainted with those, who had been the
Disciples of Christ. Besides, we have heard Scultet. observat. in Titum. c. 8.
sed ego de Jacobo dicam, non illo quidem Apostolo sed Salvatoris nostri fratre.
Scultetus resolving, that James (not the Apostle) the Brother of our Lord, was
Bishop of Jerusalem, from the plentiful testimonies of Antiquity it self. We
will conclude with this our proof from the same Antiquity; but what? even that
which Bucer de Anim. cura et officio Pastor: Apud patres Hieronymo vetustiores
clara habemus Testimonia, in praecipuis Ecclesiis omnibus temporibus
Apostolorum ita comparatum est, ut Presbyteris omnibus quidem officium
Episcopale fuerit impositum. Interim tamen Apostolorum temporibus unus, de
Presbyteris electus utque ordinatus est in officii ducem and quasi Antistitem,
qui cateris omnibus praeivit, and curam animarum, ministeriumque Episcopale
pracipue and in summo gessit atque administravit, quod de Jacobo legis, Act.
15. ubi Lucas Jacobum describit ut Antistitem totius Ecclesiae omniumque
Presbyterorum.
Bucer finds resolved upon (as he says) before Hierom, let us take his own
words. Divine Fathers more ancient then Hierom. Cyprian, Ireneus, Eusebius, and
other Ecclesiastical Historians show, That in the Apostles times there was one
elected and ordained, who should have Episcopal function and superiority over
Presbyters; so he, instancing in James, of whom we have spoken who was Bishop
of Jerusalem.

XV. THESIS.
That Master Beza himself is challengable to yield unto Apostolical right of
Episcopacy, from his own former confession.
MAster Beza has already Vide Thesi^. 12.
confessed concerning the famous Church of Alexandria, that from Mark the
Evangelist, one was chosen to be placed in a degree above Presbyters, called
Bishop, is according to the Testimony of Hierom. The Story hereof has been of
late published by Master Seldom, the Ornament of our Nation, excellently
conversant in ancient and exotic Learning, out of the Relation of Eutych^us,
that Mark the Ev. placed Anianus Patriarch or Bishop over Presbyters in the
Church of Alexandria. In which book also, there is set down the full Catalogue
of 18. Bishops successively unto Dionysius, that possessed the same See, which
proves as plainly an Episcopal and personal succession, by an Apostolical
Constitution from Anianus to Alexandria in a lineal succession, as was the
filial and natural descent from Adam to Thara, which makes up eighteen
Generations. What need then many words? the most Theses which have been
premised, and almost all afterward to be propounded, do declare the same by
joint accordance of Protestant Divines of reformed Churches, and suffrages of
Antiquity. We hasten to our last proof; but are arrested in our way by our
Opposites, to answer two objected Testimonies of Antiquity.

XVI. THESIS.
That the Testimonies of Nazianzen and Augustine are unworthily objected to the
contrary.
WE are urged to reckon these two excellent Bishops, although in true
Construction they have answered for themselves. Smect. vindicat. page 88.
Nazianzen (say our Opposites) mustering up the evils that had happened unto him,
reckons ejection out of his Episcopacy, holding it a part of wisdom to avoid
it, wishing that there were no (...) place of President-ship, or (...) or
Tyrannical Prerogative in the Church, but that they might be known only by
virtue. We have alleged Nazianzen according to the genuine sense; So they:
But so as usually in an Heterogeneall sense to infer a necessary abnegation
of Episcopacy. They who seek iugenuously the genuine sense of Sentences in
Authors must be Janus-like faced, looking (...) backward and foreward, both
which properties have been wanting to our opposites; first because before the
words objected they lay before their eyes this saying of Nazianz, orat. 28.
Fuit tempus quando corda^^ and prudentes viri Episcopatum in admiratione
habuerunt and disiderabant
Nazianzen; there was a time when Episcopacy was had in great admiration, and
desired of wise and prudent men; and the second, as not considering that was
then spoken only comparatively against the Tyrannical Government of Bishops,
which by all Protestant Bishops has been condemned in the Popish Hierarchy;
besides, that this was but the breath of vexatious passion upon occasion of one
Maximus, whom Nazianzen calls a Cynicke and doggish Philosopher, because,
whereas he himself had the General esteem in the Church of Christ to be, by
way of excellence, called (...), the Divine, notwithstanding he was vehemently
persecuted by the same unworthy Prelate, and by his circumvention disturbed out
of his Bishopric; and therefore sensible of that iudignity, did utter the
language of his hearts grief. But why did not our Opposites tell us, that after
this storm there fell a calm, when the same godly Bishop was with general
applause received to his Bishopric again; but especially we may complain that
they have by their silence smothered Nazianzens judgment concerning the cause
it self, which is the right of Episcopacy, and which he esteemed the most
perfect kind of Government; So he. And is not this as much as to have held it
the best? Which he further declares in his funeral Orations which he had of
three famous Bishops, Basil, Athanasius, and Cyprian. Augustine writing to
Hierome Walo page 355. usus, inquit obtinuit, ut Episcopatus Presbyterio major
sit secundum honorum vocabula, Ergo usu and consuetudine Ecclesiae prius
constitutum est ut Episcopi majores essent Presbyteris, tum ex re distincta
vocabulorum etiam insequuta est distinctio.
says, that custom has obtained, that Episcopacy should be higher then
Presbytery, according to the honor and dignity of the words. Therefore (says
Walo) the distinction of Episcopacy and Presbytery was first constituted by the
Church. So he; whose disciples our other Opposites have learned this lesson,
saying, Smect* Vindic. page 87.
If Augustine had known the majority of Bishops above Presbyters, to have been
of Divine or Apostolical institution, he might have said so much; nay he would
have said as much. And we answer, if any of our Opposits had reguarded to
search the judgment of Augustine, they would not have said thus much, because
it is evident that Augustine did say as much as they require, he should have
said, as has been shown; saying of himself and other Bishops, thus; we succeed
the Apostles in the same Power, and that Christ instituted Bishops when he
ordained his Apostles: That we See above.
repeat not his condemning Aerius (as Epiphanius did) for denying Episcopacy
to have been an institution Apostolical; and now whether our Reader think it
more reasonable, to yield to the supposition of what Augustine would have done,
or the manifestation what he did, we permit to his judgment. This obstacle
thus removed, we fall now upon the last proof.

Our last proof, that Episcopacy is of Apostolical right and according to the
word of God, even from the Word of God it self.

To this purpose, two places of Scripture are especially to be alleged: The
Epistles of Paul to Timothy and Titus, and the Epistles of St. John in the
Revelation to the seven Churches in Asia, which are to be discussed according
to our foremer Method, by the consonant Testimonies of ancient Fathers; and
consent of Protestant Divines of general esteem and approbation.

XII. THESIS.
That Timothy and Titus both had a Prelacy over Presbyters, notwithstanding the
objection of the community of Names of Bishops and Presbyters, is sufficiently
confessed by Protestant Divines of Remote Churches.
THere can none be held a more sufficient witness with our Opposites, then he
who has professedly pleaded this cause in their behalf, and notwithstanding
freely, and deerly grants: that Walo lib. de Episc. per totum cap. primum
extraordinaria missione and functione p. 70. sic alii discipuli Christi and
Apostolorum ejus etc. p. 229 Titum Cretae insulae praefecit Paulus, qui non
singulari in aliqua Civitate Episcopus fuit, sed totam illam provinciam ad
tempus procuraret. Tales fuerunt Apostolorum auditores and discipuli, quique
primi eorum successores.
Timothy and Titus were indeed Governors over their Provinces and places,
where the Apostle had appointed them, and that they had over the Presbyters a
kind of Apostolical anthority, which he in his own judgment calls
extraordinary, and we take him at his own words; in granting that it was some
way an Authoritative Prelacy, and for the distinction of extraordinary, it will
by and by receive an ordinary, but a true answer: yet we do not so much press
his confession, as we may do his Reasons thereof, deducted from the Texts
themselves, concerning their Prelaticall power of ordering matters that were
amiss. Tit. 1. 5. of receiving Accusation against Presbyters, 1 Timothy 5. 19.
and the like.

But our other Opposites will needs pose us, requiring us to answer their first
Objection, videl. Smect.
That the Bishops, whose pedigree was derived from the Apostles, were no other
then Presbyters; then this is proved, say they, by two instances; the first is,
The identity of their names, which (quoth they) is a proof of no small
consequence, we answer, yea, rather of none at all: Else was Master Beza but of
small judgment, when speaking of the Apostolical Age, be confessed, Beza de
Minist. grad. cap. 22. Habuit jam tum Presbyterium suum aliquem (...)
Presbyterum, etiam Presbyterorum manente communi appellatione.
that the Presbytery had then a President over them, yea, when the community of
names. So he; of Presbyters and Bp^. remained among them; accordingly as Doctor
Reynolds his conference with Heart. c. 8 divis. 3.
Dr Reynolds has said that the Presbytery had then one, who was president over
them, when as yet the names of Bishop and Presbyter were the same; who
furthermore concerning the time of distinguishing the name of Bishop and
Presbyter, whither sooner or later, here or there, he says. The name of Bishop
was afterward appropriated by the usual language of the Fathers of the
Church, to him that had the Presidentship over the Elders. So he; Hereby
granting that the Presidentship by Bishops was of force before the title and
name was appropriated and allotted unto them. If our Opposites had acquainted
themselves with these learned authors, they would have spared their pains in
oppugning Episcopacy. How much more if they had consulted with Gods own Oracle
in his word, wherein we find (which formerly we pointed at) that Saint Peter
entitled himself a Co-presbyter. 1. Pet. 5. and 1. Saint John himself a
Presbyter. 1. John 1. And Saint Paul himself thrice (he could then stoop no
lower) a Deacon. Col. 1. 23. and 25. 2 Cor. 3. and 6. Yet notwithstanding all
these inferior appellations they held still the Authority of their
Apostelship; we end this point in hope that our Opposites will take out this
lesson, which Calvin learnt from the Divine Text in the Epistle of Titus;
what is that? Even our full conclusion in this cause. Calvinus in Titum* 1 5.
Discimus ex hoc loco non eam fuisse aqualitatem inter Ministros, quia unus
aliquis authoritate prae^sset.
We learn from hence, that there was not then an equality (says he) among the
Ministers of the Church; but that one was with Authority placed over others.
Their second convincing objection would be discussed

XVIII. THESIS.
That Timothy and Titus have had a Prelacy, as Bishops over the Presbyters in
the Apostles times: notwithstanding the objection that they were called
Evangelists, according to consent of Protestants of reformed Churches.
IN the next place we are to examine the second, and only other objection,
which our Opposites enforce in this case, to wit, Smectym. vindicat page 115.
that Timothy and Titus, with all other such Disciples of the Apostles, the
assistants and immediate successors, did take care of the Churchs, not as
properly Bishops, but as Evangelists, who had no settled residence in any of the
Churches: So they, but are encountered with other Protestant Divines of remote
Churches in good number. For Luther tom. 1. fol. 309 Resolutiones ejus super
propositiones Lypsiae disputat conclus. 13. Proboquamlibet civitatem habere
debere Episcopum proprium jure divino, quod ex Paulo ad Titum ostendo dicente,
(Hujus rei gratia reliqui te Creta, ut quae desunt corrigas, and constituos
Presbyteros per civitates, sicut disposui tibi) Hos autem Presbyteros fuisse
Episcopos Hieron, and textus sequens ostendit dicens, Oportet Episcopum
irreprehensibilem esse, etc. B. Augustine. in Epist ad Hieron. Epist.
descripturus rationem reddit and dicit. Erat enim Civitas quasi diceret, non

praeerat.
Luther among his other Resolutions inserted this: That Episcopacy was of
divine Right, grounding his judgment upon the Text, specifying Titus his
Government in Creete, as being consonant to the judgment of Augustine.

2. Their learned Scultetus in Titum cap. 8. pa. 10. At Paulus Ephesi et in
Creta aliquandiu docuerat, ideo Titum and Timotheum in Creta jubet manner non
utique ut Evangelistas sed Ecclesia gubernatores. Id quod etiam Epistolae ad
utrumque scriptae evincunt: In his enim non Ecclesiae colligendae, que erat
Evangelistarum sed collectae gubernandae, quae est Episcoporum, rationem, illi^
praescribit; suntque pracepta omnia ita confirmata, ut non speciatim ad
Timotheum vel Titum, sed generatim ad omnes Episcopos referentur. Ideoque ad
Temporariam Evangelistarum potestatem minime quadrent
Scultetus shows, that at this time, they were not exercised in assisting the
Apostoles for collecting of Churches at Evangelists, but for Governing of them
that had been collected, as the general praecepts given by the Apostles (says
he) do prove thereby to become the examples and Types for the successors to
follow: and thereupon he concludes them to have been the same, who otherwise
were called Evangeliste for preaching the Gospel, although by their
superintendency Bishops. To the same purpose Moulin in Epist. 3. ad Epis^.
Winton. Quomodo appellaveris Titum, Timotheum, and Marcum, seu Episcopos sive
Evangelistas? constat eos habuisse successores Episcopos haerede^ illius
preminentiae
Master Moulin will have it known, that whatsoever Timothy and Titus had,
whether as Bishop or Evangelist, it was such as had a continual succession in
the Church, which is as others confess, as James had in Jerusalem, and Mark
in Alexandria, which was Episcopal. Titus (says Paulus Tossanus index in
Sacra Bib. Titus comes Peregrinationum Pauli, postea Cretensium Episcopus
Tossahus) after his peregrinations with Paul, was appointed Bishop of Creet,
and before these Zuinglius tom. 2. fol. 45. Idem Episcopi and Evangelistae
nomen; nam Paulus, 2 Timothy 4. [Tu vigila, opus Evangelist^ perage: ministerium
tuum probatum reddito] aliquo in loco tunc temporis fuit Episcopus, cum haec

Zuinglius confessed, that Tim. at that very time, when Paul advised him to
pursue the work of an Evangelist. 2 Timothy 4. was then Bishop in some place or

Dr. Gerhard a late famous Theological Author is copious in this Argument: who
in the same shows that the word Evangelist, given to Timothy when Paul wrote
unto him, was taken in a general acceptance, and not as properly belonging to
him, as he had been an Assistant, even as Luther (says he) understood it.
Besides he shows out of Scripture exactly the several Stations, which
Timothy had with Saint Paul in exercising his office, before that time that he
was placed Bishop in Ephesus.

We forbear the full allegation of the like Authors cited by others, that we
may hearken to our English Doctor Reynolds, nothing inferior to any of the
rest even in the opinion of our Opposites themselves, telling us of that very
time when Paul assembled the Ministry at Miletum, Act. 20. 28. Dr. Reynolds
Conference with Heart, cap. 8. distinct. 3.
One was chosen as chief in the Church of Ephesus to g^^d it, the same whom
afterward the Fathers of the Primitive Church called Bishop. So he. And for
confirmation hereof, shows that which must indeed be impregnable, to wit, A
lineall succession of 27. Bishops (as has been proved) from Timothy in the
Church of Ephesus: and for surplus age to all this we answer, to the objected
reasons propounded for Timothy's non-residence in Ephesus, by that
qualification, which Calvin. institut. lib. 3. c. 3. S. 7. Pastoribus singulis
assignatur sede^, interea non negamus, qui^ pastor alias Ecclesias adjuvare
possit, qui uni est alligatus^ sive quid turbarura intercedat quod ejus
praesentiam requirat, sive ab eo petatur consilium. Nec enim sunt veluti Glebae
addicti, ut Jurisconsulti.
Calvin has done in like cases, namely, that Pastors are not so strictly tied
to their Glebe or charge, as that they may not help other Churches upon
necessary occasions. As for the objected term of Evangelists, we moreover
answer from Scripture, where we find Philip preaching the word of God in
Samaria. Act. 8. 5. Called an Evangelist, Act. 21. 8. And yet was one of the
seven, meaning Deacons, Act. 6. 5. Our Quaere is, why Timothy might not as well
be called an Evangelist for preaching the word, being a Bishop, as Philip was,
for the same cause, named in Evangelist, being a Deacon. We think all this
should be satisfactory, although no more were said: But more we have.

Salmasius could not but confess concerning Antiquity, (although he spurn
against it) That Chrysostom, Epiphaneus, Theophylact, Theodoret, and other
Greek Commentatours have collected out of the words of Paul, that Titus was
verily Bishop of Cree^e, and that there could not be diverse Bishops in one
City, which is our present defense, and agrees as well to Timothy as to Titus.

Our second ground out of Scripture to prove a Prelacy over Presbyters, to be
according to the word of God is, Rev. c. 2. 3.
In the Book of Revelation, Christ by his Angel (properly so called) commands
John to write unto the seven Churches in Asia, verse. 1. Telling him mystically
of seven golden candlesticks, verse. 13. and of seven stars, verse. 16. and
afterward expounds their meanings; seven stars to signify seven Angels of
the seven Churches; and seven candlesticks, to betoken the seven Churches,
verse. 20. By and by, descending to particulars, he directs his several
Epistles to the several seven Angels of the seven Churches, beginning at the
Church of Ephesus, saying, Write to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, and so
of the rest. These are our Texts, which we are, in discussing these our
differences, to insist upon.

The State of the Question.
We readily grant, that whatsoever matter was written to these Angels
concerning either themselves or others, were by them to be communicated
severally to the Churches, and all the faithful as they were interested
therein, according to that Epiphonema, severally applied in every Epistle thus;
[He that has an ^ar to hear, let him hear] But the only question is, whether
each of these Angels of the Churches were singular persons, having a Prelacy
over other Pastors and Clergy, or no? Our opposites say nay, we yea. The odds
is ex Diametro.

We are therefore according to true method: first, to disprove their negative,
and after to evince our affirmation; But, in the first place, be it known that
our Opposites in their negatives are distracted into three Opinions. One sort,
by the word Angel, will have understood the whole Church collectively, as well
Laity as Clergy. Not so, say the second Opinatours, but by Angel is
collectively meant only the Order or College of Pastors or Presbyters. After
these the Novelists, its neither so nor so; but by Angel is meant one
individual Pastor, without relation to any other, newly called an Independent,
whereas our tenet is, by Angel, to understand one individual Ecclesiastical
person, having a Prelacy above the rest.

XX. THESIS.
That our Opposites first Exposition, which interprets the Angel to mean the
whole Church and congregation, is notably extravagant.
ALthough Lib. 3. de Episc. page 183. Sit ergo hoc fixum, per Angelos nihilaliud
voluisse Johannem designari, nisi ipsas Ecclesias.
Wal^ Messalinus, the grand Adversary to Episcopacy, be very peremptory for
this exposition, yet will it altogether appear groundless. But first we are to
hearken unto his gloss. Let is be held a firm and fixed truth, (says he) that
by the name of Angels are not signified any that had Presidency over others,
but the whole congregation and Churches. So he; Pythagorically upon his own
word, as we see: whereunto we may rather answer, Let it be held firmly and
fixtly, that this gloss upon the Text is evidently confuted by the context,
which stands thus, cap. 1. and 20. The Angels are called Stars, and the
Churches Candlesticks, so that he must turn Stars into Candlesticks, before
that he can make the Angel to signify the whole Congregation. Beside cap. 2.
1. the command to John is, Write to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, where
if by Angel must be understood the Church, then were it as much as to have been
said, Write unto the Church of the Church of Ephesus. But we know the spirit of
wisdom could not write unwisely.

XXI. THESIS.
That our Opposites second Exposition of the word Angel, to signify only the
Order and College of Presbyters, is erroneous, notwithstanding the Arguments
of our Opposites to the contrary.
The Answer to their first Argument.
THis indeed is the common exposition of our opposites, whereunto our
objectours adhere, upon, as they call them firm Arguments, as first; Our first
Argument, say they is drawn from the Epistle to the Church of Thyatira, where
after it was said to the Angel [I have something against thee] in the singular
number, cap. 2. 20. It is after added in the plural, verse. 24. [But I say to
you, and to the rest] But what of this? This shows (say they) the word Angel
to be collective, to signify a multitude of Pastors. We answer, if so, then
was Beza but dim-sighted, who paraphrased upon these words thus [unto you] that
is (says he) unto the Angel as President, and unto Colleagues, as unto the
Assembly (meaning of Presbyters) and to the rest, that is, to the whole flock.
So he. Where we see that the Angel was as individual and singular, as either
Thee, or Thy: And is it possible our Opposites should be ignorant what an
Apostrophe is? And that there is no f^gure of speech more familiar and usual
among men, then it is? As when a Lord writing to his chief Steward of matters
belonging to him and other Officers under him, and the whole Family: Be thou
circumspect in managing my affairs, and afterward as well unto him, as others,
but see that you and the rest keep at home, as much as may be, because of the
danger of the Pestilence which now rages on all sides.

Answer to the second Argument.
Our second Argument (say they) is drawn from the Phrases even in this very
book of Revelations, Smect. vindication.
wherein it is usual to express a company under a singular person, as the civil
State of Rome called a Beast with ten heads, which proves that the Angel
might be taken collectively. Is this all! Master Meade (say they) one better
skilled in the meaning of the Revelation, then our adversary, said, that the
word Angel is commonly [if not alwayes] in the Revelation taken collectively.
So they. This saying have I diligently sought after, but it fled from me: But
yet I shall be content to be satisfied of Mr. Meade his meaning from his other
sayings more obvious unto me, to show, that he has not been rightly understood
by these objectours. For Collectively, properly taken, is a word comprehending
a multitude without distinction of persons, as Christ in his Lamentation said,
[O Jerusalem, how often would I have gathered thy Children, but tho^ would
not] where the words singular Thou, and Thy, do here comprehend all the
Citizens of Jerusalem without distinction. Had Master Meade this collective
sense? He shows the flat contrary, Apoc. 9. 14. [four Angells] These four
(says he) were put for Nations, which they were thought to Govern. So then,
they did represent Nations, as notwithstanding to be distinctly their four
Governors. Next upon Revel. 14 6. [I saw another Angel flying] We are to call
to mind (says he) that which before was cap. 7. showed: that the Angels of
like Visions de represent them, of whom they have Government wheresoever. And
again upon verse. 7. The flying Angel is ruler, not only of men, but also of a
more eminent rank. So he. If that our Objectours had (according to Master
Meade's direction) but called to mind his own explanations, they might have
easily perceived he said no more, then as if we may grant that under the word
Angel, to whom the Epistle is in special directed, are employed all those who
are concerned therein. But how? Not by alteration of his person, but by
communion of interest, for which cause Master Beza accknowledged him the
President over others, even as many other Protestant Divines are ready to do,
and that as exactly as either we can desire, or our Opposites mislike, when we
come to discharge the affirmative point.

Two Answers we wish our Opposites to take into their second thoughts; One, as
they have presented him by way of comparison, as better skilled in the Book of
the Revelation then his adversary: the other, as he is to be singly respected,
and in his own worthiness. To the first we say, that comparison might well
have been forborne, which now provokes us to another comparison, between him
and one as dear to our Opposites as any other, whom they know to have been as
conversant in the Book of the Revelation altogether, wherein he,
notwithstanding, after the second and third Chapters, has been so far from the
collective interpretation of the word Angel, that he has not any where, as we
can find, set it down as comprehending any Multitude, nay in many places he
expresses by name the individual persons themselves, or some Individuum Vagum
signified thereby, some singular notable one.

The consideration of Master Meade his worthiness and judgment touching
Episcopacy, would be had the rather, because we have read the Translation of
his Book authorized in this manner, It is Ordered by the Committee of the
Commons House in Parliament, that the Book entitled, The Key of the
Revelation, be printed. So they. Which Key does unlock unto us his judgment in
behalf of Episcopacy, to be so fully according to the word of God, that part.
1. c. 4. v. 67. p. 35. The four and twenty Elders (says he) compass next
about the throne, which represent the Bishops and Prelates of the Churches, and
do answer both in place and order to the Levites and Priests in the Camps of
Israel, etc. Thus Master Meade, so commended by our Opposites themselves, who
if they shall approve his Key in this point, it is well, we in imparting thus
much unto them have but done our duty.

The third Argument.
Our third Argument, say they, is taken from the word Angel, Smect. vindic.
page 143*
as it is a common name to all Ministers and Messengers, and surely if Christ
had intended to point out any individual person, he would have used some
distinguishing name, as to have called him President, Rector, Superintendent.
So they. As if by this their surely they would assure us it is a Truth, if we
shall take their own word for it, contrary to the judgment of all the Learned,
who have every where taught that ever since Angelical Spirits were revealed to
the world, the word Angel, spoken in the better part, has been used to
express the dignity of their Office, and accordingly of the Ministers of God
whenever it is applied unto them: Otherwise our Opposites, I think, would
have gratified us with the allegation of some one Author that ever fancied the
contrary, whom notwithstanding we shall endeavor to satisfy by a parallel in
the word Apostles (signifying Messengers) whereof Mr. Calvin, Calvin institut
l. 3. c. 3. ^. 5, De voce hac Apostoli, etsi ex verbi Etym rite sic possunt
vocari omnes verbi Ministri, quoniam a Domino mittuntur nuncii; sed tamen quia
magni refert certam habere de eorum missione notitiam, qui rem inauditam
afferrent, duodecim illos peculiari hoc titulo ante omnes insigniri oportuit.
This word (says he) according to its Etymon agrees to any Minister of
Christ, yet was it entitled upon the twelve Apostles, because they were the
immediate Ambassadors of Christ. So he. And yet we presume that our Opposites
would not, because of the Community thereof, call either every Minister of
Christ sent to preach the Gospel, an Apostle; or every Cobbler sent on a
message, an Angel.

Their fourth Argument.
Our fourth Argument, say they, stands thus; Smect. vind. page 146.
Our Savior says, that the seven Candlesticks are the seven Churches, but he
says not likewise that the seven Stars are the seven Angels, but in
mentioning Angels, omitteth the word seven, which is not done without a
Mystery; to wit, that the Angels do not signify seven individual Pastors. So
they. Whose Tenants are two; First, that the ommission of the word seven
argues a Mystery; Secondly, that the Mystery signified thereby is this, that
the word Angel is not individually, but collectively taken. We cannot but deny
both, and so will any even with wonderment at the Objectours boldness in
uttering such their conceptions: for first to call that a Mystery, which by all
Grammar learning is in every Language most common, by that which the Grecians
call (...), that is a word not expressed following upon course in the
understanding of any rational Reader. As for example: If any one of our
Opposites writing to any of his Servants to bring him his two Horses, the black
Horse and the white, omitting in the second place the word Horse, which word
does follow in course of common understanding; yet his man should bring only
the black, but not the white, might his excuse have been, It was a Mystery?

Secondly, were it that a Mystery should be imagined therein, yet that denial
of the word Angel, to be an individual person in the Text, contradicts the
Context. The Context stands thus, cap. 1. 26. The Stars are said to be the
seven Angels of the Churches, and cap. 2. and 3. The same Angels being
recko^ed, prove accordingly to be seven. In the Context we have Numerum
numerantem, in the Text Numerum numeratum, that that which makes up a number,
should be said not to refer unto a number, which was before expressed by
Christ. He that has a perfect natural hand, is said to have individually every
finger, although he reckon them not to be five.

Their last argument answered.
This Argument (say they) is taken from Christ's denunoiation against the Angel
of the Church of Ephesus, Smectym. page 148. vindicat.
to remove his Candlestick out of its place, if he did not repent: where by
Candlestick is meant the Church or Congregation; But if there by Angel were
signified one individual person, then the congregation and people should be
punished for the offense of that one Pastor. So they. Who would not have thus
argued, if they had considered; that by thus oppugning our Exposition, they
have as utterly undermined and overthrown their own. As for example, their
tenent has been; that by the word Angel is signified the Order and College of
Pastors, in the Church of Ephesus. Now then (to return their own engine upon
them) if the Candlestick, signifying the Church, should be removed out of its
place, except those Pastors should repent, then should the people and
congregation be punished for the fault of those Pastors. Therefore all the
odds that is between both these consequences, is no more than this, viz. the
punishing of people for the fault of the Pastor: and for the faults of the
Pastors, in extremity equally, unequally in both; whereas they should have
labored to solve the doubt by some commodious, and congruous interpretation.

Whether thus, if by Candlestick be to understood the people: then by people to
conceive such of whom the Prophet spoke like people like Pastor, so that the
irrepentant people adhering to the unpenitent Pastor, may justly be involved in
the same punishment. Secondly, or thus, by taking the word Candlestick to
signify the Pastor himself, for the Ministers of the Gospel are so called,
Mat. 5. 15* And that the same word should be diversely taken in the same
sentence, cannot be strange to him who is not a stranger to Scripture. As where
it is said, He that shall save his life, (viz. Mortal) shall loose his life;
to wit, the Eternal: And again, 2. Cor. 5. 21. Of Christ, He that knew no sin,
(properly taken) was made for us sin, that is, a sacrifice for sin, or else
(not to seek further) by distinguishing of the word place, as here betokening
man's estate and condition with relation to others, in which sense might the
Church of Ephesus, be removed by altering the relation to that one Pastor, both
by not acknowledging him their Bishop, and by withholding maintenance.

XXII. THESIS.
That our Opposites third Exposition of the word Angel, to signify one only
Pastor in the Church of Ephesus, is extremely new and naught.
THis mis-begotten brat, namely an Exposition, which before these days of
distraction never saw print, we might think should by and by vanish with its
own novelty: How much more for the safety thereof, which we are rather to
enquire after, seeming to us to be very transparent. For the reasons, which
these our Opposites might have read in Brightman in Apoc. p. 11. Ephejus evasit
nobilior propter Pauli operam triennalem in ea Act. 19. 10. and 20. 31. Divinam
ad populum Scriptam Epist. datum iis Timotheum pastorem ac faelicissimam
Johannis. Apost. per tot annos irrigationem.
Mr. Brightman, viz. The City of Ephesus was more ennobled of all other, by
Paul's Triennial labor therein: Next, by the divine Epistle written unto the
people there, as also by that Timothy was ordained their Pastor: and besides;
for John's laborious watring thereof for so many years together. So he. But how
successful were these then? this was told us in the Acts of the Apostles,
concerning the Church of Ephesus: whereof it is said, so mightily grew the word
of God, and prevailed. Act. 19. 20. Now that after Paul's long residence, after
Timothies Pastorship, and after Saint John's watering of that Church, and so
long a time; and that with so admirable success, and yet here but one only
Pastor among them. Is this credible? What says the Scripture? The Harvest
indeed is great, but the laborers are few. But here in the mightily great
Harvest, the laborers are fewer then few. We ought not to be blamed for
meddling with such trifles in earnest, but that our study has been to weed out
even the least scruples, now that we are to expedite a matter of highest
importance, which is our proof of Episcopacy from the word of God: and to that
purpose from confutation of the negative part held by our Opposites, we pass
to the proofs and confirmations of our affirmative.

XXIII. THESIS.
That by the word Angel of Ephesus, to signify a singular and individual
Pastor having a Prelacy over Presbyters, is proved by a large consent of
Protestant Divines without exception judicious and ingenuous.
THe Divines, which we shall produce shall be those, whom our Opposites
themselves cannot call Partialists in behalf of Bishops, whether they be of
remote Churches, or as it were domestiques in our own Country. Of the first
kind, we allege the last chief Pastor of the Church of Geneva Master Deodate
his notes upon the Apoc. 2. 1.
Master Deodate, who is to be cited out of his Book lately authorized to be
published, by Order of the House of Commons this Parliament. The Text in the
Revelations is, Write to the Angel of the Church of Ephesus: His paraphrase
thus. That is, says he, to the Pastor or Bishop; under whose person ought to
be understood the whole Church. The Church to be employed or understood, and the
Pastor or Bishop, under whose person, which, because person can be but one,
according to the Etymon of the word Angel, Persona quasi per se una: Or as it
is defined in Philosophy. A person is an individual intellectual Nature; yet so
in this place as he being to acquaint all with the contents of this Epistle,
all were understood to be concerned in him, as all the other following
witnesses will acknowledge. Before him in the same Church of Geneva was
Theodore Beza in Apoc. 2. 1. Angelus (...), quem oportet admoneri and per eum
Collegas, totamque adeo Ecclesiam.
Beza, by Angel (says he) is meant the President, who was admonished and his
Colleagues with him. So he.

Bullinger in Apoc. cap. 2. concio septima. Nemo autem existimet hanc Epiostlam
uni inscriptam Angelo, i. e. Episcop^ vel pastori, nihil ad Ecclesiam
pertinere. Nam sub finem Epistolae Epiphonema adjicitur. Qui habet aurem audiat
quid Scriptura dicat Ecclesiis. Nominatur ergo pastor, sed non excluduntur
oviculae; Interim vero Angelo inscribitur, ut admoneantur Pastores, in ipsis
esse per multum situ^ qualis sit Eccles.
Bullinger, although he, as others affirm, that the Epistle concerns as well
People as Pastors, yet does he consent unto us, that, the Epistle was inscribed
to one, by whom the Pastors and people might be informed: As punctually and
pertinently Marlorat. in Apoc. 1. 12. Quamvis quaedam tam in Clero, quam in
populo corrigenda essent, non tamen populum, sed Clerum aggreditur: nec
quemlibet de Clero, nominatim principem Cleri, utique Episcopum.
Marlorat, some things (says he) were to be corrected as well in the people as
in the Clergy; yet does not John address himself unto the people nor yet to the
Clergy, but to the chief of them, which is the Bishop, and that not without
good reason. So he. Of our chief Gualther. Hom. 9. in Apoc. 8. Angelo, id est,
Episcopo Smyrnensi, atque adeo toti Ecclesia; constat ex Historiis Polycarpum
fuisse hunc Angelum.
Gualther held the same opinion with further evidence of these other words.
[Unto the Angel of the Church of Smyrna write] that is, says he, To the Bishop
thereof, as Histories do manifest. Gaspar. Sib. in Apoc. p. 185. de uno
singulari Angelo, qua sententia mihi magis arridet.
Gaspar Sibilius, having compared the diverse Expositions, confessed, saying,
This, as spoken but of one Angel, pleases me better. Piscator in eandem Apoc.
[Angelo] id est, Episcopo, nec non ipsi Ecclesiae.
Piscator briefly and consonantly to the Angel, that is, to the Bishop and to
the Church: namely Bishop expressly, and Church consequently, because of
matters of concernment to them also. Paraus [Angelo Ephesinae Ecclesiae] sic
vocat pastorem ejus, eadem apellatione Christus aliarum Ecclesiarum Episcopos
dignatur.
Paraeus doubts not to make his explanation as generally to be observed in
these Epistles. It is the word of Christ (says he) that that, which is meant
to the Church, should be inscribed to the Bishop of the place, or Church.
Aretius [Angelo] id est Ministro Ecclesiae per quem ad totum coetum res
proferantur.
Aretius is of no less esteem then the former, and as punctual altogether, by
Angel interpreting a special one Minister, and Disciple of John; by whom the
writing might be commended to the whole Church. P. Martyr comment, in primam
Corinth. 11 Johannes jubetur scribere ad Angelos Ecclesiarum, quierant illarum
Episcopi.
Peter Martyr used to be reckoned among the first Worthies. John (says he) was
commanded to write to the Angels, who were the Bishops of the Churches. But
what do we multiply remote Authors, when one of their Doctors may satisfy us
both for the general, and for himself? Scultetus observat in Tit. Doctissimi
quique interpretes per septem Ecclesiarum Angelos interpretantur septem
Ecclesiarum Episcopos, neque enim aliter possunt, vim nisi facere textui velint.
All the most learned Interpreters, (says Dr. Scultetus) by Angels expound the
Bishops of the Churches, nor can it be otherwise Interpreted without violence
to the Text. So he. After our so long peregrination in remote Churches, it is
time to haste home, to try what our own English Divines have judged of this
matter; and lest now we be too numerous, we shall single out three, who will be
held singular in the estimation of our Opposites themselves, Dr. Reynolds in
his Conference. with Heart. c. 2. divisio. 3.
Dr. Reynolds. Although in the Church of Ephesus, says he, there were sundry
Elders and Pastors to guide it, yet, among those sundry, was there one Chief,
whom our Savior calls the Angel of the Church. Apoc. 2. So he. His words
need no Paraphrase. Dr. Fulke in Apoc. 2. Ad Pergamensis Ecclesiae Episcopum
Epistola haec destinatur.
Dr. Fulke is one of them whom our Opposites have cited for their part, who, if
he speak directly against them, they may not be offended with us. The Epistle
to Pergamus, says he, was directed to the Bishop thereof. We have reserved
Master Cartwright to the last. that his Testimony may be more lasting in the
memory of our Opposites, as from one who uses to be most grateful unto them.
The letters written to the Churches, says he, were therefore directed to the
Angel, because he is the meetest man by office, by whom the Church may
understand the tenor of the letter. So he, and so they. Although this Cloud of
witnesses thus raining down abundance of Testimonies, for proof of an
Apostolical original of Episcopacy, Mr. Cartwright on the Rhems Testament
upon Apoc. 2.
may justly be held so convincent, that nothing but selfenesse in any party can
oppose any thing against it, yet shall we furthermore fortify their proofs,
desiring that this one thing may be observed, (to wit) the reason why all our
Opposites have strugled against this our Exposition, as a break neck to their
whole cause; but we will go on.

XXIV. THESIS.
That Antiquity held not the word Angel (whereof we treat) to be taken
Collectively for a multitude of Pastors.
IF that our Opposites had not said that we cited no ancient Fathers for our
exposition, we should not have framed this Thesis; only we cannot tell with
what appetite they did it: Is it that they hold the judgment of Fathers
satisfactory in this case? Why then have they not alleged any one syllable
out of them for their own collective sense? But we list not to expostulate,
rather hoping the best, we entreat them to spell the words of Ambros. in 1
Corint. 1. Angelos Episcopos dico, sicut docet in Apocalypsi Johannes.
Ambrose, they are but few, I call Bishops Angels, as I am taught in the
Revelation. What Ambrose meant by Bishops who can doubt? Likewise August.
Epist. 192. Divind voce laudatur Angeli nomine Praepositus Ecclesia.
Augustine the famous Bishop of Hippo, says, of one of these Angels, That he
was set over the Church by the divine voice (meaning the Scripture.) If See
above.
Scultetus when he said, that all the most learned Interpreters, by Angels,
understood Bishops; if among all, he comprehend the Ancients, we have not to
seek more witnesses; however, we need not, because there is but very rare
commenting upon the Apocalypse among the Fathers, much less upon these Texts.
All this notwithstanding we are sure of that what is wanting in their
Commentaries, they supply in their Historical relations, as will appear by and
by, rendering unto us one Polycarpus Bishop and Martyr to have been one of these
Angels in the Church of Smyrna. In the interim we will plead Reason with our
opposites.

XXV. THESIS.
That the word Angel in other places of the Revelation is commonly if not
always Individually taken.
BEtter reason they cannot expect then is the retorting of their own Argument
upon them: When they dislike this, The word Angel is commonly, if not always
taken Collectively, ergo, ought it to be so interpreted in the second and third
cap. So they; but altogether amiss, as has been shown. It will be our part
to prove the contradictory, whereof upon observation in reading Commentaries
upon the Revelation, we are the more confident; our Opposites at their leisure
may inquire to other Authors; We for this present shall need but commend a
special one unto them who in their opinion may stand for many, because only now

through his whole Commentaries upon the same Book, takes the word Angel so
far individually, as to enterpret it of some one person, either expressly by
name, or else equivalently by an Individuum vagum as thus, some not able one,
or the like.

In the second place, we do appeal to the Texts themselves to give a
sufficient taste; for oftentime the Angels are reckoned seven, and after
distributed ordinatively into first, second, third, and so till the seventh, as
plainly as one can reckon the seven days in the week, Chap. 15. and 16.
Afterward we have recited one Angel having the Key of the bottomless pit,
Chap. 20. was there need of a Collectively understood multitude of Angels to
keep one Key? The like may be said of a mighty Angel for delivering a little
book, Chap. 10. 1, 2. Besides the Angel whom John is said to have worshipped,
Chap. 22. will they say this Angel also to comprehend a Multitude? Then might
the Angel reply, have you forgot when I said to John, I am thy fellow Servant,
but five words, and every one an Individual.

Thirdly, to return to the questioned Text, whereas some of the Angels are
commended for notable virtues, and as much condemned for some notorious vices;
they that think that all the same vices and virtues did as well imply every
Pastor in all the Colleges of the seven Churches, may as well conceive, that
where the deformities are noted in any Corporation, therefore every person in
it is equally flat-nosed, crook't-legged, bald-headed, and the like,

Lastly, the Angels and Churches being both reckoned distinctly seven times,
that there should be a Collective number of the Order of Pastors, without so
much as any insinuation of distinguishing them either from Angels, or Churches;
have they any Key to unlock such a Mystery? From this kind of reasoning, we
pass unto an evidence of no less importance, Historical Experience, and
Practice.

XXVI. THESIS.
That by Angel is meant Individually one Bishop, is demonstrated by Historical
learning without contradiction.
HIstory is the life of memory, and memorial of men's lives, if it may be
undubitably had, it must necessarily seal up the verity of all that has been
said of an Apostolical Institution of Episcopacy, whereof we have had evident
instances in the Episcopal Traditions from James in Jerusalem, Mark in
Alexandria, Peter in Antioch and in Rome: And now we are to insist upon
examples of the descent from John in two of these Angelical Churches Ephesus
and Smyrna. For the first, it has been made good unto you out of Eusebius,
that Polycrat. Epist, ad Victorem apud Eusebius Hist. lib. 5. cap 25
Polycrates writ himself Bishop of Ephesus, testifying withal a line of seven
Bishops of his own kindred, his Predecessors: Whereunto may be added the
Declaration made by Leontius the Archbishop of Magnesia in the general Council.
Calced. Act. 11.
Council of Calcedon of the succession of the seven and twenty Bishops from
Timothy in the same Church of Ephesus; which Timothy, all antiquity with a
large consent of most approved Protestant Divines have testified to have been
Bishop there; none will think, but shame it self would have restrained Leontius
from making such a public Declaration in the hearing of six hundred Fathers
assembled in this Council, if the matter it self had been liable to any
contradiction. The next instance (as we are persuaded) may be held satisfactroy
and infringeable in it self, in Polycarpus Bishop of Smyrna, in the days when
Saint John lived; Our witnesses deserve your hearing, we will begin with the
veriest junior of all, saying, Hieronym. de Scrip. Eccles. Polycarpus Johannis
discipulus and ab es Smyrnae Episcopus ordinatus, totius Asiae princeps fult,
qui nonnullos Apost, lorumqui Dominum viderant Magistros habuerit and viderit.
Postea vero regnante Marco Antonio quarta post Neronem persecutione Smyrnae
sedente proconsule and universo populo in Amphithet. adversus eum personaliter
igni traditus est.
Polycarpus who had been Disciple to one that heard the Lord, and afterward
burnt a Martyr of Christ, was ordained Bishop of Smyrna by Saint John.
Hieronym. de Scrip. Eccles. Polycarpus Johannis discipulus and ab es Smyrnae
Episcopus ordinatus, totius Asiae princeps fult, qui nonnullos Apost, lorumqui

Antonio quarta post Neronem persecutione Smyrnae. sedente proconsule and
universo populo in Amphithet, adversus eum personaliter igni traditus est.
So Hierome. Another, Polycarpus Bishop and Martyr, was placed by John Bishop

Polycarpus, That after that he had been instructed by the Apostles of Christ,
with whom he had been conversant, he was made by them Bishop of Smyrna. So

enim vixit and valde senex per nobile and gloriosum Martyrium vita decessit
Ireneus. We ascend somewhat higher, to one who write an Epistle to the same
Polycarpus, intituling him the Bishop of Smyrna; and in his Epistle to the
Church of Smyrna, saluting him as their Bishop. Ignatius Epist. (...) and
Epist. ad Smyrnenses, (...), Vedelius, Exercit. in is it a^ Epist.
Ignatius in these Epistles and sayings which Vedelius the Professor in the
Church of Geneva, and an exact discerner and discoverer of the corruptions
crept into his writings, does hold as genuine and legitimate. Can our Opposites
require a greater confirmation of any historical point, which they themselves
maintain, as more amply testified then this is? whereto as many of our former
Protestant Divines did subscribe, so is there not one, to our knowledge, from
this Saint John that ever did contradict it.

XXVII. THESIS.
That Christ himself showed his approbation of the Prelacy which the foresaid
Angels had in their several Churches.
THere was yet never either favorites to Episcopacy, nor opposites against it,
but have granted, that whatsoever the Government was meant in these seven
Churches, it had the approbation of Christ by the tenor of his Epistles
written unto them. First from the words of the Chap. 1. 1. [The Revelation of
Jesus Christ sent by his Angel to his Servant John] to acknowledge the Epistles
to have been dictated by Christ himself, conveied by an Angel to John, and as
it follows in the second and third Chapters, distributed by John to the
several Angels, and communicated to the Churches. After this, by the virtue of
the same letters, an inquisition is made, (as it were a Visitation kept) upon
every Angel of the Churches, concerning the discharge of their offices; wherein
two of them are found of weight and commendable, the other five, more or less
criminally deliquents, yet so, as to manifest a justification of the Offices.
The approbation of the function is seen, not only (which reason none can deny)
by Christ his commending their diligence, zeal, and faithfulness; but even
likewise in his process of convictions, reprehensions, and denuntiations
against their remissness, dissoluteness, and faithfulness of others; but
how? certainly, so that the condemnation of their vices and abuses argued an
approbation of their Offices and Functions, because it was done, not with an
absolute intent to remove them at the first, but only to reform them, and
continue them upon their Reformation; therefore was it said from Christ to one,
Repent, or else, etc. Chap. 2. 5. and 16. to another, Repent, if not, I will
come against thee, and the like; this we see was no deprivation of the Officers
at first, much less abolition of the Offices which were to continue from age
to age.

The last point will be our Assumption from all these premises, which is, that
these Angels, being so amply, evidently, and with so unanimous consent of the
most and best approved Protestant. Divines, agreeable to Historical practice
of Apostolical Churches, proved to have been such Bishops as had a Prelaey
over the Clergy with Christ's own approbation, a truth, which the evidence of
these Scriptures did express in part from Beza de Minist. grad. cap. 13. Quid
objicis in atatem Johannis Apost. Asiae Ecclesia septem habuerunt Episcopos,
divina non humana ordinatione sibi praefectos, Apostolo singulos illos
singularum Ecclesiarum Angelos minime compellature, and culpam male obitae
functionis minime illi^ attributuro, nisi eminentior fuisset eorum in Ecclesiae
regimine auctoritas: Hoc, inquam, qu^rsum adversus Hieronymum and nos torques?
nec enim ille, quum diceret Ecclesias initio fuisse communi Presbyterorum
consilio gubernatas, ita desipuisse existimandus est, ut somniares neminem ex
Presbyteris illi c^tui praefuisse, etc.
Beza himself; his sentence is large, consisting of these briefes; First, that
the Episcopacy which seemed to him to be regulate, was to be collected out of
this Scripture of the Apocalypse. Secondly, that the same was a Presidency, and
Prefectureship of one Presbyter over the rest. Thirdly, that it was a Prelacy
of Authority. Fourthly, that Hierome was of judgment. Fifthly, that to hold
otherwise, were to doat and play the foel: all which prove the difference of
Bishop and Presbyter both to have been of Apostolical Institution, because
under John in the Church of Asia; and to have had the approbation of Christ,
because of Christ his commendation of the faithful discharge of this Function,
which fully makes good unto us both our conclusions, That Episcopacy for the
Office and Function it self, is according to the word of God, and in respect of
use, therefore the Best.

The Original of BISHOPS and METROPOLITANS, briefly laid down by James,
Archbishop of ARMAGH.
THe ground of Episcopacy is derived partly from the pattern perscribed by God
in the Old Testament: and partly from the imitation thereof brought in by the
Apostle's and confirmed by Christ himself in the time of the New, The
government of the Church of the Old Testament was committed to the Priests and
Levits: unto whom the Ministers of the New do now succeed; in like sort as our
Lord's Day has done unto their Sabbath, that it might be fulfilled which was
spoken by the Prophet, touching the vocation of the Gentiles. Esa 66. 21.
I will take of them for Priests, and for Levits, says the Lord.

That the Priests were superior to the Levits, no man doubts: and that there
was not a parity, either betwixt the Priests or betwixt the Levits themselves,
is manifest by the word of God; wherein mention is made of the Heads and Rulers
both of the one, and of the other. 1 Chronicles. XXIV. 6. 31 and Ezr. VIII. 29.

The Levits were distributed into the three families of the Gershonites,
Cohathites, and Merarites: and over each of them God appointed one (...) or
Ruler, Number. III. 24. 30. 35. the Priests were divided by David into four and
twenty courses; 1 Chronicles. XXIV. Who likewise had their Heads; who in the History
of the New Testament are ordinarily called Matthew. 2. 4. and 27. Act. 19. 14 etc
(...), or chief of the Priests; and clearly distinguished from that singular
one, who was the type of our great High Priest, that is passed into the
Heavens, Jesus the Son of God. Heb. 4. 14.
Yea in the XI. of Nehemy, we find two named Bishops, the one of the Priests,
the other of the Levits that dwelt in Jerusalem. The former so expressly termed
by the Greek in the 14. the latter both by the Greek and Latin Interpreter in
the (...). LXX Episcopus Levitarum. Hieron.
22 verse. and not without approbation of the Scripture it self, which renders
the (...) Psalm. 109. 8.
Hebrew word of the same original in the Old, by the Acts. 1. 20.
Greek (...) in the New Testament.

Of Levi it was said by Moses the man of God Deuteronomy. 33. 10.
They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law; they shall put
incense before thee, and whole brunt sacrifice upon thine Altar. Because this
latter part of their office has ceased with them, and the Leviticall Altar
(the truth prefigured thereby being now exhibited) is quite taken away: May not
we therefore conclude out of the former part (which has no such typical
relation in it) that our Bishops and Presbyters should be (as the Apostle would
have them to be) 1 Timothy 3. 2.
(...) apt to teach; Tit 1. 9.
able by sound doctrine both to exhort, and to convince the gainsayers? Nay,
and out of the latter part it self; where God had appointed, that Deuteronomy. 28. 1.
the Priests the Levits and all the Tribe of Levi should eat the offerings of
the Lord made by fire; does not the Apostle by just analogy infer from
thence, that for as much as 1 Cor. 9. 13, 14.
they which waited at the Altar, were partaker with the Altar; even so had the
Lord ordained, that they which preached the Gospel, should live of the Gospel?

With what show of reason then can any man imagine, that what was instituted by
God in the Law,, for mere matter of Government and preservation of good order
(without all respect of type or ceremony;) should now be rejected in the
Gospel, as a device of Antichrist? That what was by the Lord once Jerem. 2. 2.
planted a noble vine, wholly a right seed, should now be so turned into the
degenerate plant of a strange vine; that no purging or pruning of it will serve
the turn, but it must be cut down root and branch, as Matthew. 15. 13.
a plant which our heavenly Father had never planted? But nothing being so
familiar now a days, as to father upon Antichrist, whatsoever in Church
matters we do not find to suite with our own humors: The safest way will be, to
consult with Christ himself herein, and hear what he delivers in the cause.

These things says he, that has the seven Stars. Revel. III. 1. he owneth
then, we see, these Stars; whatsoever they be. And, the Mystery of them he
thus further opens unto his beloved Disciple. The seven Stars which thou
saw in my right hand, are the Angels of the seven Churches. Revel I. 20.
From which words a learned man, very much devoted to the now so highly admired
Discipline, deduceth this conclusion. Quanta igitur dignitas verorum Pastorum,
qui tum stellae sunt, non in alio firmamento, quam in dextra^ Christi fixae,
tum Angeli? T. Brightman. in Apocalypse. 1. 20.
How great therefore is the dignity of true pastors, who are both STARS,
fixed in no other firmament then in the right hand of Christ, and ANGELS?

He had considered well, that in the Church of Eph^sus (one of the seven here
pointed at) there were many Act. 20. 17. 28.
PRESBYTERS, whom the holy Ghost had made BISHOPS, or Overseers, over all that
flook, to feed the Church of God, which he had purchased with his own blood.
And withal he saw, that by admitting one Angel there above the rest (all, as
well Judge. 2. 1. Hagg. 1. 13. Matthew. 11. 18.
extraordinary Prophets, as Malach. 2. 7.
ordinary Pastors, being in their own several stations accounted Angels or
Messengers of the Lord of Hosts) he should be forced also to acknowledge the
eminency of one Bishop above the other Bishops (that name being in those days
Philip. 1. 1. 1 Timothy 1. 2. Tit. 1. 5. 7.
common unto all the Presbyters) and to yield withal, that such a one was to
be esteemed as a star fixed in no other firmament, then in the right hand of
Christ.

To salve this therefore; all the stars in every Church must be presupposed to
be of one magnitude, and though those stars which typified these Angels are
said to be but seven, yet the Angels themselves must be maintained to be far
more in number: and in fine, where our Savior Says, Revel. 3. 1.
unto the Angel of the Church of Ephesus write; it must by no means be
admitted, that Nec uni alicui Ange^o mittuntur, sed toti (ut ita dicam)
Collegio Postorum; qui omnes ha^c communi voce comprehenduntur. Non enim unus
erat Angelus Ephesi, sed plures: nec inter istos aliquis Princeps. Brightman in
Apocalypse. 2. 1.
any one Angel should be meant hereby, but the whole College of Pastors
rather. And all upon pretense of a poor show of some shallow reasons; that
there was not one Angel of Ephesus but many, and among them not any Principal.

Which wresting of the plain words of our Savior is so extreme violent, that
M. Beza (though every way as zealously affected to the advancement of the new
Discipline, as was the other) could by no means digest it: but ingenuously
acknowledges the meaning of our Lords direction to have been this. (...), id
est (...). Quem nimirum oportuit inprimis de his rebus admon^ri, ac per eum
cateros Collegas totamque ad^o Ecclesiam. Bez. in Apocalypse. 2. 1.
To the Angel, that is, to the President, as whom it behoved specially to be
admonished touching those matters; and by him both the rest of his colleagues,
and the whole Church likewise. And that there was then a standing President
over the rest of the Pastors of Ephesus, and he the very same (as learned
Conference with Heart, c. 8. divis. 3.
Doctor Rynolds adds) with him whom afterward the Fathers called Bishop: may
further be made manifest, not only by the succession of the first Bishops of
that Church, but also by the clear testimony of Ignatius: who (within no
greater compass of time then twelve years afterward) distinguishes the
singular and constant President thereof, from the rest of the number of the
Presbyters, by appropriating the name of Bishop unto him.

As for the former, we find it openly declared in the general Council of
Chalcedon, by Leontius Bishop of Magnesia; that (...). Council. Chalcedon. Act.
11.
from Timothy (and so from the days of the Apostles) there had been a
continued succession of seven and twenty Bishops; all of them ordained in
Ephesus. Of which number the Angel of the Church of Ephesus, mentioned in the
Revelation, must needs be one: whether it were Timothy himself, as Vid. Peter.

Eusebius and Hierome specify it. From thence there are but twelve years
reckoned unto the tenth of Trajan: wherein Ignatius, in that last journey which
he made for the consummation of his glorious Martyrdom at Rome, wrote another
Epistle unto the self-same Church of Ephesus. In which he makes mention of
their then Bishop Onesimus: as it appears both by Eusebius. lib. 3. hist. (...).
Eusebius citing this out of it, and by the Epistle it self yet extant.

In the same journey wrote Ignatius also an Epistle unto the Church of Smyrna,
another of the seven, unto whom those letters are directed in S. John's
Revelation, wherein he also (...). Id. in epist. ad Smyrn.

Who this Bishop, and what that Presbytery was, appears by another Epistle
written a little after from Smyrna, by (...) Polycarp. epist. ad Philippens.
Polycarpus and the Presbyters that were with him, unto the Philippians. And
that the same Polycarpus was then also Bishop there, when S. John wrote unto
the Angel of the Church of Smyrna; who can better inform us then Irenaeus? who
did not only know those worthy men, (...). Iren advers. haeres. lib 3 cap 3.
who succeeded Polycarpus in his See; but also Id. in epist. ad Florinum: (apud
Eusebius. lib. 5. (...)) and ad Victorem, (ibid. (...))
was present, when he himself did discourse of his conversation with S. John,
and of those things which he heard from those who had seen our Lord Jesus.

Polycarpus, (...) Iren. lib. 3. cap. 3. Vid. and Eusebius lib. 3. hist (...).
says he, was not only taught by the Apostles and conversed with many of those
that had seen Christ, but also was by the Apostles constituted in Asia Bishop
of the Church which is in Smyrna: whom we our selves also did see in our
younger age, for he continued long: and being very aged, he most gloriously and
nobly suffering Martyrdom departed this life.

Now being ordained Bishop of Smyrna by the Apostles; who had finished their
course, and departed out of this life before S. John (the last surviver of
them) did write his Revelation: who but he could there be meant by the Angel of
the Church in Smyrna? in which that he still held his Episcopal office unto the
time of his Martyrdom (which fell out LXXIV. years afterward) may sufficiently
appear by this testimony, which the brethren of the Church of Smyrna, who were
present at his suffering, gave unto him. (...). Smyrnens. Eccles. epist. de
martyrio Polycarpi. Eusebius. lib. 4, hist. (...).
He was the most admirable man in our times, an Apostolical and Prophetical
Doctor, and Bishop of the Catholic Church which is in Smyrna. Whereunto we may
add the like of Polycrates Bishop of Ephesus, who lived also in his time and in
his neighborhood, affirming (...). Polycrat. epist ad Victorem: apud Eusebius.
lib. 5. hist. (...).
Polycarpus to have been both Bishop and Martyr in Smyrna. So says he in his
Synodica Epistle directed unto Victor Bishop of Rome, about 27 years after the
Martyrdom of Polycarpus; he himself being at that time 65 years of age.

About the very same time wherein Polycrates wrote this Epistle unto Victor,
did Tertullian publish his book of Prescriptions against Heretics: wherein he
avoucheth against them, that Sicut Smyrnaorum Ecclesia Polycarpum ab Johanne
con^ecatum refers; sicut Romanorum Clementem a Petro ordinatum edit: proinde
(or, perinde) utique and caeteri exhibent, quos ab Apostolis in Episcopatum
constitutos, Apostolici seminis traduces habent. Tertul. de Praescript. cap.
32. Vid. and ejusd. lib. 4. contra Marcion cap. 5.
as the Church of Smyrna had Polycarpus placed there by John, and the Church of
Rome Clement ordained by Peter; so the rest of the Churches also did show what
Bishops they had received by the appointment of the Apostles, to traduce the
Apostolical seed unto them. And so before him did Irenaeus urge against them
Successiones Episcoporum, quibus Apostolicam qua in unoquoque loco est
Ecclesiam tradiderunt. Iren. lib. 4. advers. hares. cap. 63.
the successions of Bishops, unto whom the Apostles committed the charge of the
Church in every place, Omnes enim ii valde posteriores sunt quam Episcopi,
quibus Apostoli tradiderunt Ecclesias. Id. lib. 5. cap. 20.
For all the Heretics (says he) are much later then those Bishops, unto whom
the Apostles committed the Churches. And Habemus annumerare eos qui ab
Apostolis instituti sunt Episcopi in Ecclesiis, and successores eorum usque ad
nos; qui nihil tale docuerunt, neque cognoverunt quale ab his deliratur. Id.
lib. 3. cap. 3.
we are able to number those who by the Apostles were ordained Bishops in the
Churches, and their Successors unto our days; who neither taught nor knew any
such thing as these men dream of.

For proof whereof, he brings in the succession of the Bishops of Rome, from

twelfth place after the Apostles. Concerning whom, and the integrity which then

Bishops that were here in King Edward the VI. or Queen Maryes days: I might
also say, in the middle of the reign of Queen Elizabeth her self; if with

Emperor Hadrian.

This Hegesippus, living next after the first succession of the Apostles (as
Eusebius. lib. 2. (...) (non, ut vulgo legitur, (...). Egesippus qui post ipsas
statim primas. Apostolorum successiones fuit: ut Rufinus locum expressit.
Eusebius notes) and being himself a Christian Eusebius. lib. 4. (...). fin.
of the race of the Hebrews; was careful to record unto posterity the state of
the Church of Jerusalem in the days of the Apostles, and the alteration that
followed after their departure out of this life. Where first he shows, that
(...). Hegesipp. Commentariot. lib. 5. apud eund. Eusebius. lib. 2. (...).
James the brother of our Lord, surnamed the Just, did govern that Church
together with the Apostles: yet so (as Clem. in libro sexto Hypotyposcon: ubi
narrat, (...). Apud eund. l. 2. cap. 1.
Clement of Alexandria, who wrote some twenty years after him, further adds)
that he had this preferment even before the three prime Apostles, Peter and the
two sons of Zebedee (James and John) to be chosen the peculiar Bishop of
Jerusalem, the then mother Church of the world.

After the death of James the Just, Apud Eusebius lib. 4 cap. 22. Vide eund. lib.
3 cap. 11. and 32.
Hegesippus declares that Symeon the son of Clopas or Cleophas was
constituted Bishop, and so continued until the days of the Emperor Trajan:
under whom he suffered a glorious Martyrdom (about the same time that Ignatius
did) being then an hundred and twenty years of age; and by that account borne
before the Incarnation of our blessed Savior. Where, the observation of this
prime Historian is not to be passed over: that (...). Hegesipp. apud eund. lib.
3* cap. 32.
until these times the Church was called a Virgin; as being not yet corrupted
with the overspreading of heretical doctrine. For howsoever heresies did
spring up before, yet they were so kept down by the authority of the Apostles
and the Disciples who had heard our Lord himself preach; that the authors and
fautors thereof were not able to get any great head, being forced (by the
authority of such opposites) to lurk in obscurity.

But as soon as all that generation was gathered unto their fathers, and none
of those were left who had the happiness to hear the gracious words that
proceeded from the Lords own mouth: the Heretics, taking that advantage, began
to enter into a kind of combination, and with open face publicly to maintain
the (...). 1 Timothy 6. 20.
oppositions of their science falsely so called (from whence they assumed unto
themselves the name of Gnostics, or men of knowledge) against the preaching of
that truth, which by those who were Luc. 1. 2.
eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word had been Jude v 3.
ONCE delivered unto the Saints. (...) Hegesipp. apud Eusebius. lib* 4. (...).
The first beginner of which conspiracy was one Thebuthis: who had at the first
been bred in one of the seven sects, into which the people of the Jews were in
those days divided; but afterward, because he missed of a Bishopric unto
which he had aspired, (this of Jerusalem, as it may seem; whereunto Iustus,
after the death of Symeon, was preferred before him) could think of no readyer
a way thoroughly to revenge himself of this disgrace, than by raising up the
like distractions among the Christians. Which as, in the effect, it shows the
malignity of that ambitious Sectary: so does it, in the occasion, discover
withal the great esteem that in those early days was had of Episcopacy.

When Hegesippus wrote this Ecclesiastical History (the ancientest of any,
since the Acts of the Apostles) Eleutherius as we heard before, was Bishop of
the Church of Rome: unto whom Misit ad eum Lucius Britannorum Rex epistolam:
obsecrans ut per ejus mandatum Christianus efficeretur. Et mox effectum pia
postulationis consecutu^ est: susceptamque fidem Britanni usque in tempora
Diocletiani Principis inviolatam integramque quieta pace servabant. Bed. hist.
ecclesiast. Anglor. lib. 1 cap 4.
Lucius King of the Britains (as our Bid relates) sent an Epistle; desiring
that by his means he might be made Christian. Who presently obtained the effect
of his pious request: and the Britains kept the faith then received, sound and
undefiled in quiet peace, until the times of Dioclesian the Emperor. By whose
bloody persecution the faith and discipline of our British Churches was not
yet so quite extinguished; but that within ten years after (and eleven before
the first general Council of Nice) three of our Bishops were present and
subscribed unto the Council of Arles: Tom. 1. Concilior. Galliae, a Sirmondo
edit page 9.
Eborius of York, Restitutus of London, and Adelfius of Colchester; if that be
it, which is called there Colonia Londinensium. The first root of whose
succession we must fetch beyond Eleutherius, and as high as S. Peter himself:
if it be true, that he (...). Metaphrast. Commentar. de Petro and Paulo; ad
diem 29 Junii.
constituted Churches here, and ordained Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons in
them; as Symeon Metaphrastes relates out of some part of (...). Ibid.
Eusebius (as it seems) that is not come unto our hands.

But, to return unto the Angels of the seven Churches, mentioned in the
Revelation of S. John: by what has been said, it is apparent, that seven
singular Bishops, who were the constant Presidents over those Churches, are
pointed at under that name. For other sure they could not be, if all of them
were cast into one mould, and were of the same quality with Polycarpus, the
then Angel of the Church in Smyrna: who without all question was such, if any
credit may be given herein unto those that saw him and were well acquainted
with him.

And as Tertullian in express terms affirms him to have been placed there
by S. John himself (in the testimony before alleged out of his Tertull.
Praescript. c. 32. Similiter and Hieronymus in Catal. script. Ecclesiast. cap,
15. in Polycarpo; and Nicephorus, lib 3. hist. ecclesiast. cap. 2.
Prescriptions:) so does he elsewhere, from the order of the succeeding
Bishops, not obscurely intimate, that the rest of that number were to be
referred unto the same descent. Habemus and Johannis alumnas Ecclesias. Nam
etsi Apocalypsim ejus Marcion restuit; ordo tamen Episcoporum ad originem
recensus, in Johannem stabit auctorem. Sic and caeterarum generositas

We have, says he, the Churches that were bred by John. For although Marcion
do reject his Revelation: yet the order of the Bishops reckoned up unto their
original, will stand for John to be their Founder.

Neither does the ancient Writer of the Martyrdom of Timothy (mentioned by
Photius) mean any other by those seven Bishops, whose assistance he says S.
John did use, after his return from Patmos, in the government of the Metropolis
of the Ephesians. For (...). Phot. Bibliothec, number. 254.
being revoked from his exile, says he, by the sentence of Nerva, he betook
himself to the Metropolis of Ephesus; and being assisted with the presence of
SEVEN Bishops, he took upon him the government of the Metropolis of the
Ephesians: and continued, preaching the word of piety, until the Empire of
Trajan.

That he remained with the Ephesians and the rest of the brethren of Asia,
until the days of Trajan, and that during the time of his abode with them, he
published his Gospel; is sufficiently witnessed by Irenaeus advers. haeres. l.
2. cap. 39 item. lib. 3. c. 1. and 3.
Ireneus. That upon his return from the Island, after the death of Domitian, he
applied himself to the government of the Churches of Asia, is confirmed
likewise both by Eusebius. lib. 3. hist. cap 23.
Eusebius, and by Hieronym. in Catal. scrip. Ecclesiast c. 9.
Hierom: who further adds, that Id. ibid. and Praefat. in Evangel. Matthaei.
at the earnest entreaty of the Bishops of Asia he wrote there his Gospel.

And that he himself also, being free from his banishment, did ordain Bishops
in diverse Churches, is clearly testified by Clement of Alexandria: who lived
in the next age after, and delivers it as a certain truth, which he had
received from those who went before him, and could not be far from the time
wherein the thing it self was acted. (...). Clem. Alexandrin. in lib. de divite
salvando, (qui falso Origenis nomine habetur editus, ad ca^eem tomi 3.

When S. John (says he) Domitian the Tyrant being dead, removed from the Island
of Patmos unto Ephesus, by the entreaty of some he went also unto the
neighboring nations; in some places constituting Bishops, in others founding
whole Churches.

Among these neighboring Churches was that of Hierapolis: which had Papias
placed Eusebius. lib. 3. hist. cap. 35. Hieron. Catal. script* Ecclesiast. cap.
18. and Chronic. ad ann. Traj^ni 2.

the disciples of the Apostles, and of Christ also; he himself does thus
declare, in the Proeme of the five books which he entitled, A declaration of
the words of the Lord. (...) (ita enim ex Graecis MSS. and vetere Rufini

lib. 3. hist. (...). Eusebius ibid.
If upon occasion any of the Presbyters, which had accompanied the Apostles,
did come; I diligently enquired what were the speeches which the Apostles used,
what Andrew or what Peter did say, or what Philip, or Thomas, or James, or
John, or Matthew, or some other of the disciples of the Lord; and the things
that Aristion and John the Elder, our Lords disciples, did speak. The two last
of whom he often cited by name in the process of the work; relating the
passages in this kind which he had heard from them.

Neither can any man be so simple as to imagine, that in the language of
Clemens Alexandrinus the name of a Bishop should import no more then a bare
Presbyter: if he consider, that not the (...). Clem. Alexandr Paedagog. lib. 3.
cap. ult.
difference only betwixt Presbyters, Bishops and Deacons is by him
acknowledged; but further also, that the disposition of their three offices, in
his judgment, does carry with it (...). Id. Stromat. lib. 6.
an imitation of the Angelical glory. To say nothing of the Emperor Hadrian:
who, hard upon the time of the forenamed Papias, writing unto the Consul
Servianus touching the state of things in Egypt, makes distinct mention in
his letter of Nemo Christianorum Presbyter. Hadrian. epist. ad Servian apud Pl.
Vopisc. in vita Saturnini.
the Presbyters of the Christians, and of those Qui se Christi Episcopos
dicunt. Id. ibid.
who call themselves the Bishops of Christ.

And thus having deduced Episcopacy from the Apostolical times; and declared,
that the Angels of the seven Churches were no other, but such as in the next
age after the Apostles were by the Fathers termed Bishops: we are now further
to enquire, why these Churches are confined unto the number of seven, in the
superscription of that Apostolical Epistle prefixed before the book of the
Revelation. Revel. 1. 4:
John to the seven Churches in Asia: Grace be unto you and peace. where S. John
directing his letters unto them thus indefinitly, without any mention of their
particular names; cannot by common intendment be conceived to have understood
any other thereby, but such as by some degree of eminency were distinguishable
from all the rest of the Churches that were in Asia, and in some sort also did
comprehend all the rest under them.

For taking Asia here in that stricter sense, wherein the New Testament uses
it, as denoting the Lydian Asia alone (of the circuit whereof I have treated
Disquisit. touching the Asia properly so called, etc. chap. 2.
elsewhere more particularly) it is not to be imagined, that after so long
pains taken by the Apostles and their disciples in the husbanding of that part
of the Lords vineyard, there should be found no more but seven Churches
therein, especially since S. Paul that 1 Cor. 3. 10.
wise masterbuilder professes, that he had here 1 Cor. 16. 8, 9.
a great door and effectual opened unto him: and S. Luke testifies
accordingly, that Act. 19. 10, 20.
all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and
Greeks; so mightily grew the Word of God and prevailed. Which extraordinary
blessing of God upon his labors, moved the Apostle to make his residence Act.
20. 18. 31.
in those parts for the space of three years: wherein he ceased not to warn
every one night and day with tears.

So that in all reason we are to suppose, that these seven Churches (comprising
all the rest within them) were not bare Parochial ones, or so many particular
congregations; but Diocesan Churches (as we use to call them) if not
Metropoliticall rather. For that in Plin. lib. 5. hist. nature. cap. 29.
Laedicea, Sardis, Smyrna, Ephesus and Id. ibid. c. 30.
Pergamus, the Roman governors held their Courts of justice, to which all the
Cities and Towns about, had recourse for the ending of their suites; is noted
by Pliny. And besides these (which were the greatest) Thyatira is also by
Ptolem. Geograph. lib. 5.
Ptolomy expressly named a Metropolis: as Philadelphia also is, in the Council.
Constantinop. sub Mena, Act. 5.
Greek Acts of the Council of Constantinople held under Menas. Which gives us
good ground to conceive, that the seven Cities, in which these seven Churches
had their seat, were all of them Metropoliticall, and so had relation unto the
rest of the Towns and Cities of Asia, as unto daughters rising under them.

This Lydian Asia was separated from Caria by the river Maeander: upon the
banks whereof Magnesia and Trallis were seated, to the Christians whereof
Ignatius directed two of his epistles; wherein he makes mention of Damas
Bishop of the one Church, and Polybius Bishop (or (...). Eusebius. lib. 3. hist.
cap. 35.
Ruler, as Eusebius calls him) of the other, whom they had sent to visit him
at Smyrna, adding withal in that to the Trallians, his usual admonitions.
(...). Ignat. epist. ad Trallian.
Be subject to the Bishop, as to the Lord: and (...). Ibid.

He that does any thing without the Bishop and the Presbyters and the Deacons,
such a one is defiled in conscience. (...), etc. Ibid.
Fare ye well in Jesus Christ; being subject to the Bishop, and likewise to the
Presbyters.

Wherein we may note, that with twelve years after mention of the seven
Churches made in the Apocalypse (for then, as has been showed, were these
epistles of Ignatius written) other Episcopal cities are found in the same
Lydian Asia; and two such, as in after times are well known to have been Ordo
Metropolitar. in Append. Geograph. sacr. Caroli a S. Paulo, page 11. and in
tomo 1. Juris Graeco. Romani. a Jo. Leunclavio edit. page 90.
under the government of the Metropolitan of Ephesus. But whether this
subordination were as ancient as the days of Ignatius (whose Epistles are
extant unto these three Churches) and Eusebius. lib. 3. hist. cap. 35.
Damas the then Bishop of Magnefia, with Polybius of Trallis, were at that time
subject to One simus the Bishop of Ephesus, might well be doubted: but that the
same Ignatius directs one of his Epistles unto the Church (...). Ignat.
epist. ad Roman.
which had presidency in the place of the Region of the Romans; and in the body
thereof does attribute unto himself the title of the Bishop of Syria. Whereby,
as he intimates himself to have been not only the Bishop of Antiock, but also
of the rest of the province of Syria, which was under that Metropolis: so does
he likewise not obscurely signify that the Bishop of Rome had at that time a
presidency over the Churches that were in the Ex Vrbicari^ Regione. ^od. Theod.
lib. 11. tit. 2. leg. 3.
Vrbicarian Region, as the Imperial Constitutions, or the Ex Provincia Romana,
civitate Portuen, etc. In nominibusquae Concilio Arelatensi l. praefixa
leguntur.
Roman Province, as the Acts of the first Council of Arles call it.

What that Vrbicarian Region was, I will not now stand to discuss: whether
Tuscia only, wherein Rome it self was situated (which in the days of
Ignatius was one entire region, but afterward divided into Tuscia Suburbicaria
and Annonaeria) or the territory wherein the Praefectus Vrbis did exercise his
jurisdiction (which was confined within the compass of a hundred miles about
the City) or, with that, those other provinces also whereunto the authority of
the Vicarius Vrbis did extend; or lastly the circuit within which those 69.
Bishoprics were contained that Insuper praeter septem collaterales Episcopos
eraut alii Episcopi, qui dicuntur suffraganei Romani Pontificis, nulli alii
Primati vel Archiepiscopo subjecti; qui frequenter ad Synodos vocarentur. M S.
Vatican apud Baron. ann. 1057. S. 23.
were immediately subject to the Bishop of Rome, and frequently called to his
Synods: the names whereof are found registered in the Records of that Church.
The antiquity of which number, as it may in some sort receive confirmation from
the Roman Synod of seventy Bishops held under Gelasius: so for the distinction
of the Bishops which belonged to the city of Rome, from those that appertained
to Italy, we have a far more ancient testimony from the Edict of the Emperor
Aurelian; who in the controversy that arose betwixt Paulus Samosatenus and
Domnus for the house which belonged unto the Church of Antioch, commanded that
it should be delivered to them, (...): says Nicephorus Callist. lib. 6. Hist.
cap. 29. but Eusebius. lib. 7. c. 30. more fully, (...).

Athanasius, may likewise be observed: the name of Italy being in a more strict
sense applied therein to the seven Provinces, which were under the Civil
jurisdiction of the Vicarius or Lieutenant of Italy, and the Ecclesiastical of
the Bishop of Millaine.

And it is well worth the observing, that the Fathers of the great Council of
Nice afterward confirming this kind of primacy, in the Bishops of Alexandria,
Rome and Antioch, and (...). Conci. Ni^aen. 1. Can. 6.
in the Metropolitans of other Provinces; do make their entrance into that
Canon with (...). Let the ANCIENT customs continue. Which as it clears the
antiquity of the Metropoliticall jurisdiction of the Bishop of Rome, so does it
likewise confirm the opinion of those, who conceive the Metropolitan of
Alexandria to be meant in that passage of the Emperor Hadrians epistle unto
Servianus. Ipse ille Patriarcha quum Aegyptum venerit, ab aliis Serapidem
adorare, ab aliis cogitur Christum. Hadrian* epist. ad Servian. apud Vopisc. in
Saturnino.
Even the very Patriarch himself, when he comes into Egypt, is by some
compelled to adore Serapis, and by others to worship Christ. As if, upon his
returning into Egypt, either from his visitation of Lybia and Pentapolis (which
this same Nicene Canon shows to have of old belonged unto his care) or from
his flight in that present time of persecution; he should suffer this
distraction: the heathen laboring to compel him to the worship of Serapis,
and his own Christian flock on the other side striving to keep him constant in
the service of Christ. For that either the Heathen had will, or the Christians
power at that time to force the Jewish Patriarch (of whom some do understand
the place) to the adoration of Christ; has no manner of probability in it.

That part also of the Canon, which ratifieth the ancient rights of
Metropolitans of all other Provinces, may serve to open unto us the meaning of
that complaint which, some threescore and ten years before the time of this
Synod, S. Cyprian made against Novatianus; for the confusion which by his
schism he brought upon the Churches of God: that Cum jampridem per omnes
provincias, and per urbes singula^, ordinati sint Episcopi in aetate antiqui,
in fide integri, in pressura probati, in persecutione proscripti; ille super
eos creare alios pseudo-episcopos* audent. Cyprian Epist. 52.
Whereas long since in all Provinces, and in all Cities, Bishops had been
ordained, in age ancient, sound in faith, tried in affliction, proscribed in
persecution; yet took he the boldness to create other false Bishops over their
heads. Namely, subordinate Bishops in every City, and Metropolitans in every
Province.

In Afric at that time, although there were many civil Provinces, yet was
there but one Ecclesiastical: whereof Cyprian himself was (...). Council.

Archbishop; as the Fathers of the Trullan Synod call him. It pleased, says he
in one of his Epistles, Universis Episcopis, vel in nostra provi^cia, vel trans
mare constitutis. Cyprian. epist. 40.
all the Bishops constituted either in our Province or beyond the Sea:
intimating thereby, that all the Bishops which were on his side the Sea did
belong unto one Province. Quoniam latius fusa est nostra provincia; habet etiam
Numidiam and Mauritanias duas sibi cohaerentes. Id. Epist. 45
For our Province, says he in another place, is spread more largely; having
Numidia also, and both the Mauritaniaes, annexed unto it. Whence that great
Council assembled by him for determining the question touching the baptizing
of those that had been baptized by Heretics, is said to be gathered Ex
provincia Africa, Numidia, Mauritania. Council. Cypriani.
out of the Province of Africa, Numidia, and Mauritania. For howsoever in the
civil government, the Proconsular Africa (wherein Carthage was seated) Numidia
and both the Mauritanies, (Sitifensis and Caesariensis) were accounted three
distinct Provinces: yet in the Ecclesiastical administration they were joined
together and made but one Province, immediately subject to the Metropoliticall
jurisdiction of the prime See of Carthage.

Some threescore years before this African Council was held by Cyprian, those
other Provincial Synods were assembled by the Metropolitans of sundry nations,
fot the composing of the Paschall controversy, then hotly pursued: and among
the rest, that in our neighbor country, out of (...). Eusebius. histor. lib. 5.

upon him again. Having the government of many Bishops; what may we call him
but an Archbishop?

Which is not so much to be wondered at, when we see that the Bishops of another
Island stick not (and that without any control) to deduce the ordination of
their Metropolitan from the Apostolic times, in the face of the whole general
Council of Ephesus. For whereas the Patriarch of Antioch did claim an interest
in the ordaining of the Metropolitan of Cyprus: the Bishops of that Island
prescribed to the contrary, that A sanctis Apostolis nunquam possunt ostendere
quod adfuerit Antioche^us and ordinaverit, vel communicaverit unquam insulae
ordinationis gratiam, neque alius quisquam. Council. Ephesin. Act. 7.
from the time of the holy Apostles it could never be showed, that the Bishop
of Antioch was ever present at any such ordination, or did ever communicate the
grace of ordination to that Island; and that the former Bishops of Constantia
(the Metropolis of Cyprus) Troilus, Sabinus, Epiphanius, Et nunc memorati
Episcopi, and qui a sanctis Apostolis erant omnes orthodoxi, ab his qui in
Cypro constituti sunt. Ibid.
and all the holy and orthodoxe Bishops which were before them, ever since the
holy Apostles, were constituted by those which were in Cyprus, and therefore
desired that Sicut initio a temporibus Apostolorum and constitutionibus and
canonibus sanctissimae and magnae Synodi Nicaenae; illaesa and superior
infidiis and potentia^ permansit nostra Cypriorum Synodus. Ibid.
as in the beginning from the times of the Apostles, and by the constitutions
and canons of the most holy and great Synod of Nice, the Synod of the Cyprian
Bishops remained untouched and superior to privy underminings and open power;
so they might still be continued in the possession of their ancient right.
Whereupon the Council condemning the attempt of the Bishop of Antioch, as
(...). Ibid.
an innovation brought in against the Ecclesiastical laws and the canons of
the holy Fathers; did not only order, that (...) Ibid.

their ancient custom: but also (...) and paulo post. (...). ibid.
for all other Dioceses and Provinces wheresoever; that no Bishop should
intrude himself into any other Province, which had not formerly and from the
beginning been under him or his predecessors.

The beginning of which kind of subordination of many Bishops unto one chief,
if it were not to be derived from Apostolical right; yet it is by Beza fetched
Neque vero magis existimandum est, hunc externum ordinem fuisse initio humani
generis. Pagi enim ex familiis, and ex pagis urbes, and ex urbibus civitates

from the same light of Nature and enforcement of Necessity, whereby men were
at first induced to enter into consociations, subjected one unto another; and

unto him the name of an Archbishop, at least he would be taught hereby, to
retain that reverend opinion of the primitive Bishops of the Christian Church
(who so willingly submitted themselves, not only to the Archiepiscopal, but
also to a Patriarchical government) which Calvin professed he did: that in all
this, they were far from having a thought, Reperiemus veteres Episcopos non
aliam regen^ae Ecclesiae formam voluisse fingere ab ea quam Deus Verbo suo
praescripsit. Calvin. Institut. lib. 4. cap. 4. sect. 4.
to devise another form of Church Government, then that which God had
prescribed in his Word.

The Writers, which in the next age after the Apostles, have here given
testimony for Episcopacy.
IN the XIIII. year of Domitian, about the XCV. year of our Lord (according to
the vulgar account) S. John wrote his Revelation; and in it, the Epistle
directed by our Savior to the Angel of the Church in Philadelphia. No longer
then twelve years after that time, Ignatius (S. John's Scholar) writes his
Letters unto the same Church. In the beginning whereof, he gives this
testimony unto their Bishop; that (...). Ignat. epist. ad Philadelph.
he knew him to have been promoted, not of himself, nor by men, unto that
Ministry, pertaining to the public weal of the Church: which is every whit as
much, as if he had called him their Angel. Afterward he tells them, that
there is but (...). Ibid.
one Bishop, joined with the Presbytery and the Deacons: and that he delivered
this as the voice of God; (...). Ibid.
Take heed unto your Bishop, and to the Presbytery and the Deacons, (...) Id.

calling him to witness, for whom he was bound (and for whom he went then unto
his last martyrdom) that he had not this from humane flesh (or from the mouth
of men) but that the Spirit spoke it. Without the Bishop do nothing. So that
from S. John's time, we have this continued succession of witnesses, in the age
next following, for Episcopacy.

The Apostolical Institution of EPISCOPACY; deduced out of the premises, by W.
C.
IF we abstract from Episcopal government all accidentals, and consider only
what is essential and necessary to it; we shall find in it no more but this:
An appointment of one man of eminent sanctity and sufficiency to have the care
of all the Churches, within a certain Precinct or Diocese; and furnishing him
with authority, not absolute or arbitrary, but regulated and bounded by laws,
and moderated by joining to him a convenient number of assistants. To the
intent that all the Churches under him may be provided of good and able
Pastors: and that both of Pastors and people conformity to laws and
performance of their duties may be required, under penalties, not left to
discretion, but by law appointed.

To this kind of government I am not by any particular interest so devoted, as
to think it ought to be maintained, either in opposition to Apostolic
institution, or to the much desired reformation of men's lives, and restoration
of Primitive discipline, or to any law or precept of our Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ: for that were to maintain a means contrary to the end. For obedience to
our Savior is the end for which Church Government is appointed. But if it may
be demonstrated, or made much more probable then the contrary, as I verily
think it may: I. That it is not repugnant to the government settled in and for
the Church by the Apostles. II. That it is as complyable with the reformation
of any evil which we desire to reform either in Church or State, or the
introduction of any good which we desire to introduce, as any other kind of
government; And III. That there is no law, no record of our Savior against it:
then I hope it will not be thought an unreasonable motion, if we humbly desire
those that are in authority, especially the High Court of Parliament, that it
may not be sacrificed to clamor, or overborn by violence: and though (which
God forbid) the greater part of the multitude should cry, Crucify, Crucify,
yet our Governors would be so full of Justice and courage, as not to give it
up until they perfectly understand concerning Episcopacy it self, Quid mali
fecit. I shall speak at this time only of the first of these three points: That
Episcopacy is not repugnant to the government settled in the Church for
perpetuity by the Apostles. Whereof I conceive this which follows as clear a
demonstration, as any thing of this nature is capable of.

That this government was received universally in the Church, either in the
Apostles time, or presently after, is so evident and unquestionable, that the
most learned adversaries of this government do themselves confess it.

Petrus Molinaeus, in his book De munere postorali, purposely written in
defense of the Presbyteriall government, acknowledges: That presently after
the Apostles times, or even in their time (as Ecclesiastical story witnesses)
it was ordained, That in every City one of the Presbytery should be called a
Bishop, who should have pre-eminence over his Colleagues; to avoid confusion
which often times arises out of equality. And truly this form of government all
Churches every where received.

Theodorus Beza, in his Tract De triplici Episcopatus genere, confesses in
effect the same thing. For having distinguished Episcopacy into three kinds,
Divine, Humane, and Satanicall, and attributing to the second (which he calls
Humane, but we maintain and conceive to be Apostolical) not only a priority of
order, but a superiority of power, and authority over other Presbyters, bounded
yet by laws and canons provided against Tyranny: he clearly professes, that
of this kind of Episcopacy is to be understood whatsoever we read concerning
the authority of Bishops or Presidents (as Justin Martyr calls them) in
Ignatius, and other more ancient Writers.

Certainly from To whom two others also from Geneva may be added: Daniel
Chamierus (in Panstratia, to^, 2. lib. 10. cap. 6. sect. 24.) and Nicol.
Vedelius (Exercitat. 3. in epist. Ignatii ad Philadelph. cap. 14. and Exercit.
8. in epistol. ad Mariam, cap. 3.) which is fully also demonstrated in the
former Treatise, by the testimonies of those who wrote in the very next age
after the Apostles.
these two great defenders of the Presbytery we should never had this free
acknowledgement, so prejudicial to their own pretense, and so advantageous to
their adversaries purpose, had not the evidence of clear and undeniable truth
enforced them to it. It will not therefore be necessary to spend any time in
confuting that uningenuous assertion of the Anonymus Author of the Catalogue
of Testimonies for the equality of Bishops and Presbyters, who affirms, That
their disparity began long after the Apostles times: But we may safely take for
granted that which these two learned Adversaries have confessed; and see,
whether upon this foundation laid by them, we may not by unanswerable reason
raise this superstruction.

That seeing Episcopal Government is confessedly so ancient and so Catholic,
it cannot with reason be denied to be Apostolic.

For so great a change, as between Presbyteriall Government and Episcopal,
could not possibly have prevailed all the world over, in a little time. Had
Episcopal Government been an aberration from, or a corruption of the
Government left in the Churches by the Apostles, it had been very strange, that
it should have been received in any one Church so suddenly, or that it should
have prevailed in all for many Ages after. Variasse debuerat error Ecclesiarum:
quod autem apud omnes unum est, non est erratum, sed traditum. Had the Churches
erred, they would have varied. What therefore is one and the same amongst all,
came not sure by error, but tradition. Thus Tertullian argues very probably
from the consent of the Churches of his time, not long after the Apostles, and
that in matter of opinion much more subject to unobserved alteration. But that
in the frame and substance of the necessary government of the Church, a thing
always in use and practice, there should be so sudden a change as presently
after the Apostles times, and so universal, as received in all the Churches,
this is clearly impossible.

For what universal cause can be assigned or fained of this universal
Apostasy? you will not imagine that the Apostles, all or any of them, made any
decree for this change, when they were living; or left order for it in any Will
or Testament, when they were dying. This were to grant the question; to wit,
that the Apostles, being to leave the government of the Churches themselves,
and either seeing by experience, or foreseeing by the Spirit of God, the
distractions and disorders which would arise from a multitude of equals,
substituted Episcopal government instead of their own. General Counsels to
make a Law for a general change, for many ages there was none. There was no
Christian Emperor, no coercive power over the Church to enforce it. Or if
there had been any, we know no force was equal to the courage of the
Christians of those times. Their lives were then at command (for they had not
then learned to fight for Christ) but their obedience to any thing against his
Law was not to be commanded (for they had perfectly learned to die for him.)
Therefore there was no power then to command this change; or if there had been
any, it had been in vain.

What device then shall we study, or to what fountain shall we reduce this
strange pretended alteration? Can it enter into our hearts to think, that all
the Presbyters and other Christians then, being the Apostles Scholars, could
be generally ignorant of the will of Christ, touching the necessity of a
Presbyteriall government? Or dare we adventure to think them so strangely
wicked all the world over, as against knowledge and conscience to conspire
against it? Imagine the spirit of Diotrephes had entered into some or a great
many of the Presbyters, and possessed them with an ambitious desire of a
forbidden superiority, was it possible they should attempt and atchieve it once
without any opposition or contradiction? and besides that the contagion of this
ambition should spread it self and prevail without stop or control, nay,
without any noise or notice taken of it, through all the Churches in the world;
all the watchmen in the mean time being so fast asleep, and all the dogs so
dumb, that not so much as one should open his mouth against it? But let us
suppose (though it be a horrible untruth) that the Presbyters and people then
were not so good Christians as the Presbyters are now, that they were generally
so negligent to retain the government of Christ's Church commanded by Christ,
which we now are so zealous to restore: yet certainly we must not forget nor
deny that they were men as we are. And if we look upon them but as mere
natural men, yet knowing by experience how hard a thing it is even for policy
armed with power by many attempts and contrivances, and in a long time to gain
upon the liberty of any one people, undoubtedly we shall never entertain so
wild an imagination, as that among all the Christian Presbyteries in the world,
neither conscience of duty, nor love of liberty, nor averseness from pride and
usurpation of others over them, should prevail so much as with any one, to
oppose this pretended universal invasion of the Kingdom of Christ and the
liberty of Christians.

When I shall see therefore all the fables in the Metamorphosis acted and prove
stories; when I shall see all the Democraties and Aristocraties in the world
lie down and sleep, and awake into Monarchies: then will I begin to believe
that Presbyteriall government, having continued in the Church during the
Apostles times, should presently after, against the Apostles doctrine and the
will of Christ, be whirled about like a scene in a masque, and transformed into
Episcopacy. In the mean time, while these things remain thus incredible, and in
humane reason impossible; I hope I shall have leave to conclude thus.
Episcopal government is acknowledged to have been universally received in the
Church, presently after the Apostles times. Between the Apostles times and this
presently after, there was not time enough for, nor possibility of, so great an
alteration. And therefore there was no such alteration as is pretended. And
therefore Episcopacy, being confessed to be so ancient and Catholic, must be
granted also to be Apostolic. Quod erat demonstrandum.

FINIS.
