A Tender Visitation of Love TO PROFESSORS and PROFANE, But especially to the
Inhabitants of the Town of WAYMOVTH.

With some directions how they may try themselves, whether they are yet in
their sins, or whether they are come to him that makes an end of sin.

Also a Warning to all sorts of people, that they may repent of the evil of
their ways whilst the day of Mercy lasts, least Repentance be hid from
their eyes.

Howl ye Inhabitants of the Earth, for the day of vengeance is at hand, the
Lord will stain the glory of all flesh. Being written from the breathings of
Life, by a handmaid of the Lord, S. R.

London, Printed for Thomas Simmons, 1661.

I have a long time kept silence, now will I write that I may be eased, I will
declare that I may be unburthened.
O You professors, the Lord God in measure has showed me your states and
conditions, which is very bad and dangerous for you to go on in; O you are all
of you poasting the very way to Destructon, a black day hangs over your heads,
you are all of you as people in the dark, you are seeking the way of the Lord
where it is not to be found; O your ways and doings are not good, they are not
according to the Truth of the Living God, you have ayrie light vain spirits,
you speak of the things you know not; you are like people who are dreaming of
things, and when the sleep is over, behold it was not so; you have gotten the
show or shadow of truth, but the Substance you know not; you are in the many
ways, where no true peace is to be found, but Rents and Divisions, you have
chosen lying vanities, and you go on in the imaginations of your own hearts,
choosing that which the Lord has no pleasure in, but his Righteous Soul is
vexed, even from day to day.

O you barren Trees, you cumber the ground, leaves are found on you, but no
fruits at all, The Lord God will shake off your Leaves, and your Branches shall
wither, you shall have nothing left to cover your selves withal, the very
foundation shall be shaken whereon you stand, then may you wish that the
Mountains or Hills could hide you from the Wrath of the Lord God, he will
speedily avenge himself upon all the workers of Iniquity. Therefore you
stout-hearted men and women, leave off doing that which is evil, and repent,
make no delay, for the time is short, and the day of the Lord God is at hand,
wherein all your ways words works and actions are to be tried, of what
profession so ever you are of, the Lord will visit you, he will prove all your
ways by Fire, and there is nothing shall be able to stand in that day but that
which is pure of God, which has known the day of burning and purifying by
fire, of such the second death shall have no power, but all Professions which
are out of the life and power of the truth of the living God, such I say shall
perish and die, the Lord has no pleasure in them, they are as a loathsome
thing which has an ill savor in his nostrils.

O you Professors, your many long prayers the Lord has no regard unto; your
holy Sabbath Days, and your solemn Feast-daies are as an Abominable thing, the
Lord has no pleasure in them, they are no more to him, then if you offered
Swines flesh, or did cut off a Dogs neck, the Lord is even wearied with your
Sacrifices, your hearts are unclean before him, read Cain the Murderer which
slew his Brother, the just Abel who was born after the Spirit, I say Cain which
slew the just, he brought also a Sacrifice and offered it unto the Lord even as
Abel did, whom the Lord had regard unto, but unto Cain, and to his off ring,
the Lord had no regard, for the same Nature which slew the just one, I say that
same Nature can offer Sacrifices, the same Nature which went out into the
Transgression, which was the first Nature, I say the same Nature can Pray and
sing, and speak many great swelling Words, but this the Lord has no regard
unto.

O why will you die, why will you die? Why will you stand out any longer? Why
will you put the day afar off? Are you resolved through wilfulness to die in
your sins? has not the Lord set good and evil before your eyes, and will you
still choose the evil, and despise the good? O you Professors of the Town of
Waymouth, the Lord has had a tender pity toward you, O your warnings has
been many by the Lords Servants and handmaids, but you have made it as a
leight thing, and you have called the Lords Messengers and Servants the
Devils,) and some have said that the Devil sent them, but the day will come
when many of you shall say, and be made to confess, that many of you have been
warned from the Lord out of their mouths, and many shall stand as witnesses in
the day of God, when his wrath shall be revealed against the unrighteousness
of every man and woman; I say in that day many shall stand as living witnesses
against you, because the Lord has warned many of you out of their mouths,
although you have despised the reproof of the Lord, and cast his Law and his
Counsel behind your backs; O may it not justly be said to you, as the Lord said
to a people in the days of old, because you would not receive my Counsel, nor
regard my repoof, therefore the Lord said to that people, he would laugh at
their calamities, and mock when fear comes upon them.

Awake, awake, you who are asleep in security, I say awake and come forth out
of your graves, the Lord our God is risen, he has sounded his Alarm to the
Nations, he has uttered his voice to the ends of the Earth, the remote Islands
has heared his sound, the graves are opened, and many dead bodies are raised
to sing praises to the Lord for ever and ever; And now is the Lords own chosen
remnant to be gathered in, and now is he making up of his Jewels, with whom he
will dwell, and he is choosing of a Peculiar people, who shall worship him in
spirit out of all Shows and Shadows, Forms, Customs, and Traditions of men;
And all Forms, and Customs, and Shadows of things shall be laid wast, I say it
shall be laid wast, the Lord God will do it, his own mouth has spoken it, the
day is at hand wherein our God will work Wonders, I say the day is at hand
wherein our God will work Wonders amongst the Children of men, and amongst all
that dwell on the Earth will he make known his Arm of strength, and his Power
shall be seen, and his Miracles shall be made manifest, to the view of all the
Inhabitants of the Earth; Babylons Merchants shall trade no more in that day,
their lying devinations shall cease, the Lord will raise up Pastors, and
Teachers after his own heart, such as shall feed his people with knowledge and
with understanding; but such as go on in their lies, which makes Merchandise of
the Just, and starves the souls of many, which deceives the simple, and causes
the weak to err in Judgment, a day of bitter torments is prepared for them,
endless misery shall come upon them.

Babylon, the Mother of Harlots, she with all her Merchants and their
Merchandises shall fall, and her downfall must be great, she that has long sat
as a Queen, which said she should see no sorrow, she I say must be thrown down,
and all her goodly Children with her, which lean upon her knees, they must be
taken Captive together, she has Captivated and killed the Saints, and has
drunken the blood of the Innocent, she must be led into captivity, she that
has led others, she must have blood for blood, as she has done to others,
others must do to her, her very lovers shall loath her, none of them shall
pity her, the fire of Gods wrath shall consume her flesh; shame shall cover
their faces who have taken pleasure in her beauty, her fame shall be taken
away, her glory shall utterly be defaced, her Foundation shall be rooted up, her
Memorial shall utterly rot and be consumed from off the face of the whole
Earth, the Lord God Almighty has spoken it, and it shall come to pass, and be
fulfilled in its season; Therefore howl all you that dwell on the Earth, I say
howl all you who are yet in your sins, be you afflicted and mourn and weep,
let your laughter and singing be turned into mourning, and your Joy into
heaviness, let shame cover your faces, you proud wanton ones, is it not high
time for you to consider your ways, and to cease from that which is evil? O
return whiles you have yet a day, remember you are but flesh, and all flesh is
as grass, or as a flower of the field, who appears beautiful for a time, and
in a moment is changed, or withered away, and you must dye; You know not how
soon it may be, before the Lord may call you to an account, and then what will
you say for your selves? You who have spent your time in Wantonness, Pride,
Vain laughter and foolish talking, in singing of Songs and Ballats, and telling
of Stories, and taking Gods holy Name in vain, in Swearing, Lying and
Drunkenness, to the abusing of the Creation of God, and many other lascivious
actions; Take warning, O be persuaded, prize your time, make better use of it
whiles the day of mercy lasts, let a true Reformation be known amongst you,
Repent, Repent, put sackcloth upon your loins and wallow in ashes, let a true
mournful state in the sight of the Lord God be known and witnessed amongst you,
that the Lord God may take pity and compassion on you; Nineveh that great
City, who went on in wickedness for a time, was warned by one of the Lords
Servants, as you may read in Jonah, and they received the Lords message without
questioning of it, and the Nenivites repented before the Lord, for the evil of
their ways, and the Lord was entreated by them, and he took pity upon them
and spared the City.

And now O Inhabitants of the Town of Waymouth, there is a necessity laid upon
me at this time to warn you, because of the evil day which must assuredly come
upon all the workers of iniquity, but you have made leight of the many warnings
of the Lord and of his Messengers, and some of them you have requited with
cruel mockings, and Imprisonments, and other ill usage. O people consider of
these things, the Lord does not usually bring destruction, or sore judgments,
or plagues upon a People or Nation, but he first warns them of the evil that is
to come upon them unless they repent. Sodom and Gomorab had a day wherein the
Lord warned them of the evil that was to come upon them, but they slighted the
Lords warning; O read, sudden destruction came upon them; How could I take up a
lamentation over thee O Waymouth, Waymouth? How could I take up a sore
lamentation over thee? How could I mourn over thee O Waymouth? Lamentable is
thy state, mournful is thy days, I am bowed down for thee, I have mourned for
thee many times, as I have passed through thy streets, tears have trickled down
mine eyes, to consider the sad estate and conditions of many of thy
Inhabitants, the Lord God has a controversy against you, the cry of
oppression is found amongst you; O I have born the weight and burden of many
of your iniquities upon my own shoulders, the yoke of oppression have lain
heavy upon my neck, I have born a great burden for you days without number; O
the Seed of God lies oppressed in you all, Professors and Profane; O the Seed of
God, the Immortal Babe, the Begotten of God lies oppressed in you all, not heeded
nor regarded, although it cries aloud in you, and often groans by reason of
your wickedness; O you bruise the tender Principle of God in you all, and you
put him to open shame daily, he who was the man of sorrows, who was well
acquainted with grief, whose visage was mared more then any man's, he is
oppressed in you all and by you; Read the little Babe, the begotten of God, he
was laid in a Manger, in the worst place of the Inn, the beast fed over the
Babe, it lay in the Manger, I speak near to you all, the beastly nature which
was the first forward nature is not yet cast out of many of you, the Babe lies
under in you, the first nature lives above it, and this nature makes merry over
the just, the little one that is low whom you tread over. And now in the fear
of God I warn you all who ever you are that are out of the Truth of the living
God, come down, come down to the true witness of God placed in you all, which
makes manifest sin and evil in the hearts and consciences in every man and
woman, and this is pure of God which makes manifest every man and woman's state
and condition, and this is not of man nor of woman, although it is placed in
man and in woman, but this stands in every man and woman as a faithful Witness
for God against sin and evil, and this witness cannot consent to any thing that
is evil, which men and women does, although men and women acts and walks
contrary day after day to the leadings of this true witness, and where this
true witness which God has placed to be man and woman's guide, I say, where and
in whomsoever this true witness is not obeyed, loved nor believed in, by such
it is crucified and slain, and so Scripture comes to be fulfilled, as it was
said in a certain place in Sodom and Egypt [spiritually called] was our Lord
Jesus crucified and slain, and this shall be every man's and woman's great
condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men love darkness rather
then the light because their deeds are evil; Now this witness which makes
every man and woman's state and conditions manifest, is light, and this light is
Christ Jesus the Son of the living God, who was Crucified and slain by the
blood-thirsty chief Priests and Rulers, who took council together against him;
And this Lord Jesus who was spiritually abused amongst the ungodly Generation,
the same is he which is risen and come in the flesh, with power and great
glory, for the remission of sins, and for the justification of many, and also
for the Condemnation of the wicked who know not God.

Now that which is to be known of God, is manifest within every man and woman's
heart, the word is nigh in the heart, and in the mouth, look not abroad, for it
is not without you, it is in you, make no delay, come to a search, the pearl of
great price lies hid in you, you must dig deep to find it, you must sell your
own ways, your own wisdom, your own will worships must you part withal, your
worldly delights must be thrown aside, if everyon come to find the pearl which
lies hid in you, or to know the true wisdom which God gives, the whole heart
must be swept and thoroughly searched, if ever the groat [which is lost] be found;
The Widow lost the piece of silver in her own house, and with a candle she
searched till she had found it [mark] the Widow searched with the light in her
own house for her lost silver, she did not search in the dark, nor out of her
own house, but she searched with a candle in her own house, till her lost was
found; All to the light come, every one in your own particulars, who are out of
the truth of God, who are yet in your sins, and in your iniquities, come forth
to the true trial, bring your deeds to the light, for the same Lord Jesus who
enlightneth every one that comes into the world, is the true way which leads
to the Kingdom of God; Now all you who are seeking the way of the Lord out of
the light, you are out of the way, you are in darkness, and the true way of
life there you will never come to find, the way which leads to Gods Kingdom is
but one, and that is a straight narrow way, so that none but the children of
the light are able to pass that way, the hypocrites can never walk in the
straight narrow way, such as are out of the light knows not the power of God to
guide them, but they are in the many ways, wherein is confusion, and such are
talking and sound worshipping of an unknown God, who are out of the light, life
and power of God, such know not the true teachings of God, for they have not
heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape; and how can such know the
teachings of the Lord who are in darkness, and out of the life and power of
God, who know not his voice, neither have seen his shape, but walk in the
imaginations of their own hearts, such are found in the broad way which leads
to destruction, but the Children of the light and of the day, the sheep of the
true shepherd of Israel, they know his voice, they know him and follow him,
and strangers they know and cannot follow, and to them he gives eternal life,
and such can never be plucked out of his Fathers hand, and such comes to know
the true teachings of the Lord God, who knows his voice and are led and guided
by it; but all you who are found scoffing at the light, O you are found
fighting against the Lord, you would go in another way into the true sheepfold
then by the Door; but such are thieves which would murder the sheep, such
cannot enter into the true sheepfold of rest, where the whole flock of God
finds pasture.

And now all you who are yet in your sins and iniquities, who know not the
power of God to guide you, I ask you where there is not such a thing in you
all, when you are upon your beds, or alone separated from company, when you are
cool and calm, I say at such a time, is there not such a thing in you, which
brings your sins to remembrance, and spreads them in order before you? Yea the
sins of your youth it brings to remembrance, and this shows you the danger of
sin many times before ever you have committed them, and this often strives with
you to preserve you from sinning against the Lord, and from doing that which is
evil; but I say to you as I have already said, where this true witness is not
obeyed, by such it is crucified and put to open shame; therefore I say to you
again in the fear of the living God, deal faithfully and plainly with your
selves, you who have any honest desires to know the true way of the Lord, bring
your deeds to the light, try your ways there, give not sleep to your eyes, nor
slumber to your eyelids, till you know how the condition stands with you; if
you are in your sins, the light will discover it to you as you in faithfulness
to the Lord keep, whilst you are in your sins, this will speak trouble to you,
For there is no peace to the wicked says my God, and if you live in your sins,
then sin lies at the door, and your consciences will condemn you; and if sin
lies at the door, how then dares any of you to pray, or sing, or sacrifice your
will-worships to the Lord? Does he regard the many prayers of the wicked? Are
they not abomination to him? Is it not required That all those which names the
Name of the Lord Jesus, must depart from iniquity? Or can the dead praise the
living God? I mean such as are dead in their sins whiles they are alive.

O deceive not yourselves, God will not be mocked, such as you sow, such shall
you reap; if you sow to the flesh, you shall reap Condemnation, Woe and Misery,
the Lord has no pleasure in the prayers or praises of the wicked, the Lord is
wearied of such services, or such sacrifices they have an ill savor in them:
To Obedience all come, for Obedience is better then sacrifice, it is truth in
the inward parts which the Lord our God requires; And I say again to you, who
has any honest desires after the Lord, be not wilfully blinded, come out of
your sins, live no longer in them, for the wages of sin is death, O come to him
that makes an end of sin, and destroys the Devils works in man, the Fountain
is open for sin and for uncleanness, it has this virtue in it, it makes
clean the heart and conscience of the Children of men, it purges from dead
works, it does not purge people from some of their sins, and leave the rest
behind, but the blood of Jesus cleanses from all sins, although many of you
say, and your Teachers tell you and Teach you that you can never be freed from
your sins whilst you are here, then I say to you all, as I have received it
from the Lord, you shall never be made free from your sins at all, but if you
die in your sins, you shall perish eternally in them; For after death comes
Judgment, and in the Grave there is no Repentance, and in the Pit remission of
sins is not to be found; Therefore I say it upon you in the fear of God, all
people what ever you are, Professors or Prophance, prize your time whilst you
have it, least repentance be hid from your eyes, and darkness come upon you
unawares, for in the night none can work.

Man was made after the Image of God, Created was he in purity and holiness,
but when man disobeyed the Commandments of the Lord, he lost his pure Image,
and so man became liable to the wrath and curse of God, and because man went
out into the disobedience, he was driven out from the presence of the Lord God;
now man is in the alienated estate in the separation, gone from his Maker,
driven out from the presence of the Lord God, man has lost his dominion over
the Creatures, by breaking Gods holy Commandments, and for man's Transgressions
was the flaming sword placed in the midst of the Garden, which turned every way
to keep the way of the tree of Life, the tree of Knowledge was the forbidden
fruit, (mark) all mankind has fallen in Adam the first man, they have lost
their Image, they are in the Separation, in the Alienated Estate, gone from the
Lord God, quite driven out from his pure presence, they have all fed upon the
tree forbidden, the tree of Knowledge which makes wise, the Serpents meat is
fed upon, for which cause the ground was cursed, man is in the cursed ground,
whilst he stands in the Alienation from God, the cursed nature stands in him,
it bears rule in him, and has dominion over him, so that it leads him into
Captivity to the law of sin and death; Now all men and women, who has been in
the fallen estate can never come to God again, but as they posse through the
flaming sword, which God has placed in the Garden, to keep the way of the tree
of life; I speak near to the understandings of people, that so if any are
willing to be undeceived, they may know and read what I say; (mark) there is
none I say can ever come to God again, but as they come through the flaming
sword, the first forward nature, which has led all men and women into the
separation from God must be slain by sire and sword, the wrath of God must be
known to pass upon the head of that Nature which led out into the
Transgression, there is nothing which is unclean or unholy that leads into the
Separation must be kept alive, that which is for the sword must be cut down by
the sword, and that which is for the fire must be destroyed by the fire of Gods
wrath and vengeance; and this I say whosoever comes to God again to have their
Image renewed in the Kingdom of God, must pass through great Troubles, Trials
and Tribulations, such as has not been known since the World began, till the
old Nature which is the Image of the old man, I say till that Nature is
destroyed, true peace is not to be known, for says Christ, I came not to bring
peace on the Farth but a sword first, and sudden destruction; and this sword
makes an end of sin, and cuts down and destroys the Devils Nature in men and
women, which has long bore rule in their hearts, and had the Dominion over
them; Now all you who are in the fallen estate, try your deeds by the Light,
that your dark understandings may be opened, come forth to the Lords Battle,
all you who are at ease in the flesh, the battle is begun, and the woe of the
Lord is against all such who are at ease; All upon your guard stand, every man
to his watch, diligence is required of all people, prove and see if any of you
have known a day of slaughter upon the man of sin, and if you have not known a
day of slaughter upon the man of sin, then I say to you all in Gods fear, it is
not safety for any of you to sit down satisfied, or to give ease to your flesh,
till you know your iniquities forgiven you, and your sins blotted out, and
removed and done away as a thick Cloud; And this is to be done in man, felt and
witnest in man and woman, the Marriage day is come wherein many are espoused to
one Husband, Christ Jesus the Lamb of life which takes away the sins of the
World, he is become the Teacher of his people, so that they need not another to
teach them; and here the woman is known to learn wisdom of her Husband at
home, and not to ask it of others, the woman is to learn in silence of her
Husband, Christ the Husband and head of Male and Female, he who was from
everlasting to everlasting, whose days are without beginning or ending, and
this is he which guides and rules all the Children of the day, the babes
begotten of God they cannot say the written word is their guide and rule, but
they know and witness him to guide and rule them which makes an end of sin
and destroys the Devils works. Woe to the false Teachers which teach lies, and
lead the people in an unknown path, which the Lord God has no pleasure in, a
bed of torments is prepared for them, endless misery must come upon them
unless they cease from deceiving the Lords people.

For truth sake I cannot rest, and for the Seeds sake I cannot hold my tongue,
the Lord God has spoken in me, how can I keep silence? He has uttered his
voice in me like a King going to the Battle, the Instruments for war is already
prepared, the battle day is come, the batte over all the whole earth, that the
Nations may know him come to reign whose right it is, he that has long been
kept in bondage in a strange Land under a strange King, the Lamb of life is he
called, the bright morning Star of David, which gives light to those that sat
in darkness, the Lamb of life shall reign as a King in Israel, and all dark
powers in Nations and Kingdoms shall bow and bend before him, Nobles shall
faint to see his Authority, Kings shall be afraid when he appears to make
known his power, a day of shaking must come that many may see his Power; Sions
redemption draws nigh, let the little ones rejoice, deliverance must be known
to the captives, let the Babes sing for joy, O land of Oppressors, you which
lie in wait for blood, take heed to your ways, look to it, the Lord God has
said it, and it will assuredly come to pass, I say, the Lord God has spoken
it, that he will sweep the land of oppressors, the besom of destuction is in
his hand, he will make men know that there is a God in Israel, and he has
power to throw down, root up, scatter and destroy all that is not of his own
building, planting, gathering or begetting, the strength of man shall not
hinder it, the powers of darkness death and hell nor the Grave shall not
hinder it; I will make my Miracles known, says the Lord God Almighty, the
Viols of my indignation will I swiftly pour out upon all that does evil, I will
make my Miracles known amongst thousands, I the Lord will stain the glory of
man, I the Lord will stain man's Glory, I will dash the Pot sheards of the earth
together one against another, and they shall be broken to pieces, and Briars
and Thorns must be burnt up, who are standing together in battle against the
Lord God of the whole earth. Woe to the Inhabitants of the Earth and of the Sea,
for the Devil is come down in a rage, and has but a short time to Reign.

THE END.
