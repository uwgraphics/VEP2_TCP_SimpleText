THE WORLDS OLIO.

WRITTEN By the Right HONORABLE, the Lady MARGARET NEWCASTLE.



LONDON Printed for J. Martin and J. Allestrye at the Bell in St. Paul's
Churchyard 1655.

A DEDICATION TO FORTUNE.
I Dedicate this Book to Fortune, for I believe she is a powerful Princess;
for whatsoever she favors, the World admires, whether it be worthy of
admiration, or no; and whatsoever she frowns on, the World runns from, as from
a Plaguey Infection, and not only shunns, but exclaims against it, although it
be Virtue herself; and that which is most to be lamented, is, that the
strictest Votresses to Virtue turn Reprobates, become Infidels, and with false
and superstious Devotion worship the Golden Fortune; and Flatterers, which are
the Priests, offer false Praises thereunto.

Wherefore if Fortune please, with her helping hand, she may place my Book in
Fames high Tower, where every Word, like a Cymball, shall make a Tinkling
Noise; and the whole Volume, like a Cannon Bullet, shall Echo from Side to
Side of Fames large Brazen Walls, and make so loud a Report, that all the World
shall hear it.

But if not favored, then my Book must dye,
And in the Grave of Dark Oblivion lie:
My Lord,
THE Reason why I have not dedicated any of my particular Books to your
Lordship, is, that when I have writ all I mean to print, I intend, if I live,
to Dedicate the whole sum of my Works unto you, and not by Parcells: for
indeed you are my Wits Patron; not that I lay the Defects, that may be found,
to your charge, for upon my Conscience all the Faults are mine own; but if
there be any Wit, or any thing worthy of Commendations, they are the Crumms I
gathered from your Discourse, which has fed my Fancy; and though I do not
write the same way you write, yet it is like Nature which works upon Eternal
matter, mixing, cutting, and carving it out into several Forms and Figures; for
had not Nature Matter to work upon, She would become Useless; so that Eternal
Matter makes Nature work, but Nature makes not Eternal Matter. Thus she is but
as a laboring servant; and as in Eternal Matter there lives Spirit and Motion,
which is Life and Knowledge, so in your Discourse lives Sense and Reason, in
your Wit, Delight and Pleasure; in your Mind, Honor and Honesty; in your
Actions, Valor and Prudence; in your Prosperity, Generosity and Humility; in
your Misfortunes, Patience and Magnanimity; in your Friendship, Truth and
Constancy; to your King and Country, Fidelity and Loialty; to your Neighbors,
Affability and Kindness; to your Enemies, Pardon and Pity.

But, My Lord, I must do as the Painter did, which was to draw Agamemnon in
that posture, as he stood to view his Daughter offerr'd as a Sacrifice; who
when he came to Pencil out his Countenance wherein Sorrow sat so lively, he
was forced to draw a Veil over his Face, his Grief being too great for his Art
to imitate: So I, when I come to describe your worth by my Pen I find your
Merit so far beyond all expression, that I am forced to leave off Writing, only
subscribing my self, as I am,

Your Lordships honest Wife and humble Servant Margaret Newcastle.

An Epistle that was writ before the death of the noble Sir Charles Cavendish,
my most noble Brother-in-law.
Noble Sir,
ALthough I Am absented from your person, yet not from your Favors, they are
too great, and certainly not to be worn out either by distance of Time or
Place; and you are so excellent and Divine an Architecture, that your
Generosity never missed the true Measure of Misery, and may our payment of
Prayers be justly returned you, in Blessings from Heaven; and as your Bounty
runns a Race with Necessity, so may your Merit win the Bell of Fame; which Bell
I wish may sound in every Ear, and as long as there be Ears to hear,

So that your Name may live still in Report,
When that your Soul is gone to Heavens Court.
Sir, Your humble and dutiful Servant Margaret Newcastle.

An Epistle to the Reader.
THIS Book, most of it was written five years since, and was locked up in a
Trunk as if it had been buried in a Grave, but, when I came out of England, I
gave it a Resurruction; and after a view, I judged it not so well done but that
a little more care might have placed the words so, as the Language might have
run smoother, which would have given the Sense a greater Luster; but I being of
a lazy disposition, did choose to let it go into the World with its Defects,
rather than take the pains to refine it; besides, to me it seemed as if I had
built a House, and not liking the Form after it was built, must be forced to
take it in pieces and rebuild it again, to make it of that fashion I would have
it, or be contented as it was; which considering with my self, I found it would
be as great a charge of Time and Pains, as if I should build a New one on an
other Ground; besides, there is more Pleasure and Delight in making than in
mending; and I verily believe my Neighbors, which are my Readers, would have
found fault with it if I had done it as I could, and they could but dispraise
it as it is; but I am so well armed with carclesness, that their several
Censures can never enter to vex me with Wounds of Discontent; Howsoever, I have
my delight in Writing and having it printed; and if any take a Delight to read
it, I will not thank them for it; for if any thing please therein, they are to
thank me for so much pleasure; and if it be naught, I had rather they had left
it unread: But those that do not like my Book, which is my House, I pray them
to pass by, for I have not any entertainment fit for their Palats.

The Preface to the Reader.
IT cannot be expected I should write so wisely or wittily as Men, being of the
Effeminate Sex, whose Brains Nature has mixed with the coldest and softest
Elements; and to give my Reason why we cannot be so wise as Men, I take leave
and ask Pardon of my own Sex, and present my Reasons to the Judgment of Truth;
but I believe all of my own Sex will be against me out of partiality to
themselves, and all Men will seem to be against me, out of a Complement to
Women, or at least for quiet and ease sake, who know Women's Tongues are like
Stings of Bees; and what man would endure our effeminate Monarchy to swarm
about their ears? for certainly he would be stung to death; so I shall be
condemned of all sides, but Truth, who helps to defend me. True it is, our Sex
make great complaints, that men from their first Creation usurped a Supremacy
to themselves, although we were made equal by Nature, which Tyrannical
Government they have kept ever since, so that we could never come to be free,
but rather more and more enslaved, using us either like Children, Fools, or
Subjects, that is, to flatter or threaten us, to allure or force us to obey,
and will not let us divide the World equally with them, as to Govern and
Command, to direct and Dispose as they do; which Slavery has so dejected our
spirits, as we are become so stupid, that Beasts are but a Degree below us, and
Men use us but a Degree above Beasts; whereas in Nature we have as clear an
understanding as Men, if we were bredin Schools to mature our Brains, and to
manure our Understandings, that we might bring forth the Fruits of Knowledge.
But to speak truth, Men have great Reason not to let us in to their
Governments, for there is great difference betwixt the Masculine Brain and the
Feminine, the Masculine Strength and the Feminine; For could we choose out of
the World two of the ablest Brain and strongest Body of each Sex, there would
be great difference in the Understanding and Strength; for Nature has made
Man's Body more able to endure Labor, and Man's Brain more clear to understand
and contrive than Woman's; and as great a difference there is between them, as
there is between the longest and strongest Willow, compared to the strongest an
largest Oak; though they are both Trees, yet the Willow is but a yielding
Vegetable, not fit nor proper to build Houses and Ships, as the Oak, whose
strength can grapple with the greatest Winds, and plough the Furrows in the
Deep; it is true, the Willows may make fine Arbours and Bowers, winding and
twisting its wreathy stalks about, to make a Shadow to eclips the Light; or as
a light Shield to keep off the sharp Arrows of the Sun, which cannot wound
deep, because they fly far before they touch the Earth; or Men and Women may be
compared to the Black-Birds, where the Hen can never sing with so strong and
loud a Voice, nor so clear and perfect Notes as the Cock; her Breast is not
made with that strength to strain so high; even so Women can never have so
strong Judgment nor clear Understanding nor so perfect Rhetoric, to speak
Orations with that Eloquence, as to Persuade so Forcibly, to Command so
Powerfully, to Entice so Subtly, and to Insinuate so Gently and Softly into
the Souls of men; Or they may be compared to the Sun and Moon, according to the
description in the Holy Writ, which says, God made two great Lights, the one
to Rule the Day, the other the Night. So Man is made to Govern Common Wealths,
and Women their private Families. And we find by experience, that the Sun is
more Dry, Hot, Active, and Powerful every way than the Moon; besides, the Sun
is of a more strong and ruddier Complexion than the Moon; for we find she is
Pale and Wan, Cold, Moist and Slow in all her operations; and if it be as
philosophers hold, that the Moon has no Light but what it borrows from the
Sun, so Women have no strength nor light of Understanding, but what is given
them from Men; this is the Reason why we are not Mathematicians,
Arithmeticians, Logicians, Geometricians, Cosmographers, and the like; This is
the Reason we are not Witty Poets, Eloquent Orators, Subtle Schoolmen,
Substracting Chimists, Rare Musicians, Curious Limners; This is the reason we
are not Navigators, Architectures, Exact Surveyers, Inventive Artizans; This is
the reason why we are not Skillful Soldiers, Politic Statists, Dispatchfull
Secretaries, or Conquering Caeasars; but our Governments would be weak, had we
not Masculine spirits and Counselors to advise us; and for our Strength, we
should make but feeble Mariners to tugg and pull up great Ropes and weighty
Sayls in blustering Storms, if there were no other Pilots that the Effeminate
Sex; neither would there be such Commerce of Nations as there, is, nor would
there be so much Gold and Silver and other Mineralls fetched out of the Bowels
of the Earth if there were none but Effeminate hands to use the Pick-axe and
Spade; nor so many Cities built, if there were none but Women Laborers to cut
out great Quarrs of Stone, to hew down great timber Trees, and to draw up such
Materials and Engines thereunto belonging; neither would there be such Bars of
Iron, if none but Women were to Melt and Hammer them out, whose weak spirits
would suffocate and so faint with the heat, and their small Arms would sooner
break than lift up such a weight, and beat out a Life, in striving to beat out
a Wedge; neither would there be such Steeples and Pyramids, as there have been
in this World, if there were no other than our tender Feet to climb, nor could
our Brains endure the height, we should soon grow Dissy and fall; down drunk
with too much thin Air; neither have Women such hard Chests and strong Lungs to
keep in so much Breath, to dive to the bottom of the Sea, to fetch up the
Treasures that lie in the watery Womb; neither can Women bring the furious and
wild Horse to the Bit, quenching his fiery Courage, and bridling his strong
swift Speed. This is the reason we are not so active in Exercise, nor able to
endure Hard Labor, nor far Travells, nor to bear Weighty Burdens, to run long
Jornies, and many the like Actions which we by Nature are not made fit for: It
is true, Education and Custom may add something to harden us, yet never make us
so strong as the strongest of Men, whose Sinnews are tuffer, and Bones
stronger, and Joints closer, and Flesh firmer, than ours are, as all Ages have
shown, and Times have produced. What Woman was ever so strong as Sampson, or so
swift as Hazael? neither have Women such tempered Brains as men, such high
Imaginations, such subtle Conceptions, such fine Inventions, such solid
Reasons, and such sound Judgment, such prudent Forecast, such constant
Resolutions, such quick, sharp, and ready flowing Wits; what Women ever made
such Laws as Moses, Lycurgus, or Solon, did? what Woman was ever so wise as
Solomon, or Aristotle? so politic as Achitophel? so Eloquent as Tully? so
demonstrative as Euclid? so inventive as Seth, or Archimedes? It was not a
Woman that found out the Card, and Needle, and the use of the Loadstone; it was
not a Woman that invented Perspective-Glasses to pierce into the Moon; it was
not a Woman that found out the invention of writing Letters, and the Art of
Printing; it was not a Woman that found out the invention of Gunpowder, and the
art of Gunns. What Women were such Soldiers as Hannibal, Caesar, Tamberlain,
Alexander, and Scanderbeg? what woman was such a Chemist as Paracelsus? such a
Physician as Hipocrates or Galen? suth a Poet as Homer? such a Painter as
Apelles? such a carver as Pigmalion? such an Architect as Vitruviuss? such a
Musician as Orpheus? What Women ever found out the Antipodes in imagination,
before they were found out by Navigation, as a Bishop did? or what ever did we
do but like Apes, by Imitation? wherefore Women can have no excuse, or
complaints of being subjects, as a hinderance from thinking; for Thoughts are
free, those can never be inslaved, for we are not hindered from studying, since
we are allowed so much idle time that we know not how to pass it away, but may
as well read in our Closets, as Men in their Colleges; and Contemplation is as
free to us as to Men to beget clear Speculation; Besides, most Scholars marry,
and their heads are so full of their School Lectures, that they preach them
over to their Wives when they come home, so that they know as well what was
spoke, as if they had been there; and though most of our Sex are bred up to the
Needle and Spindle, yet some are bred in the public Theaters of the World;
wherefore if Nature had made our Brains of the same temper as Men's, we should
have had as clear Speculation, and had been as Ingenious and Inventive as Men:
but we find She has not, by the effects. And thus we may see by the weakness
of our Actions, the Constitution of our Bodies; and by our Knowledge, the
temper of our Brains; by our unsettled Resolutions, incoustant to our Promises,
the Perverseness of our Wills; by our facil Natures, violent in our Passions,
superstitious in our Devotions, you may know our Humors; we have more Wit than
Judgment, more Active than Industrious, we have more Courage than Conduct, more
Will than Strength, more Curiosity than Secrecy, more Vanity than good
Houswifery, more Complaints than Pains, more Jealousy than Love, more Tears
than Sorrow, more Stupidity than Patience, more Pride than Affability, more
Beauty than Constancy, more Ill Nature than Good; Besides, the Education, and
liberty of Conversation which Men have, is both unfit and dangerous to our
Sex, knowing, that we may bear and bring forth Branches from a wrong Stock, by
which every man would come to lose the property of their own Children; but
Nature, out of love to the Generation of Men, has made Women to be governed by
Men, giving them Strength to rule, and Power to use their Authority.

And though it seem to be natural, that generally all Women are weaker than
Men, both in Body and Under standing, and that the wisest Woman is not so wise
as the wisest of Men, wherefore not so fit to Rule; yet some are far wiser than
some men; like Earth; for some Ground, though it be Barren by Nature, yet,
being well mucked and well manured, may bear plentiful Crops, and sprout forth
diverse sorts of Flowers, when the fertiller and richer Ground shall grow rank
and corrupt, bringing nothing but gross and stinking Weeds, for want of
Tillage; So Women by Education may come to be far more knowing and learned,
than some Rustic and Rudebredmen. Besides, it is to be observed, that Nature
has Degrees in all her Mixtures and Temperaments, not only to her servile
works, but in one and the same Matter and Form of Creatures, throughout all her
Creations. Again, it is to be observed, that although Nature has not made
Women so strong of Body, and so clear of understanding, as the ablest of Men,
yet she has made them fairer, softer, slenderer, and more delicate than they,
separating as it were the finer parts from the grosser, which seems as if
Nature had made Women as purer white Manchet, for her own Table, and Palate,
where Men are like coarse household Bread which the servants feed on; and if she
has not tempered Women's Brains to that height of understanding, nor has put
in such strong Species of Imaginations, yet she has mixed them with Sugar of
sweet conceits; and if she has not planted in their Dispositions such firm
Resolutions, yet she has sowed gentle and willing Obedience; and though she
has not filled the mind with such Heroic Gallantry, yet she has laid in
tender Affections, as Love, Piety, Charity, Clemency, Patience, Humility, and
the like; which makes them nearest to resemble Angels, which are the
perfectest of all her Works; where men by their Ambitions, Extortion, Fury, and
Cruelty, resemble the Devil; But some women are like Devils too, when they
are possessed with those Evils; and the best of men by their Heroic Magnanimous
Minds, by their Ingenious and Inventive Wits, by their strong Judgments, by
their prudent forecast, and wise Mannagements, are like to Gods.

To the Reader.
I Desire those that read any of this Book, that every Chapter may be read
clearly, without long stops and stays; for it is with Writers as it is with
men; for an ill affected Fashion or Garb, takes away the Natural and graceful
Form of the Person; So Writings if they be read lamely, or crookedly, and not
evenly, smoothly, and thoroughly, insnarle the Sense; Nay the very sound of the
Voice will seem to alter the sense of the Theme; though the Sense will be there
in despite of the ill Voice or Reader, but it will be concealed, or discovered
to its disadvantage; for like an ill Musician, or indeed one that cannot play
at all, who instead of playing he puts the Fiddle out of tune, and causes a
Discord, which if well played upon would sound Harmoniously; or is like one that
can play but one Tune on all sorts of Instruments; so some will read with one
Tone or Sound of Voice, though the Passions and Numbers are different; and some
again in reading wind up their Voices to such a passionate scrue, that they
whine or squeal rather than speak or read; others, fold up their Voices with
that distinction, that they make that three square that is four square, and
narrow that should be broad, and high that should be low, and low that should
be high; and some again so fast, that the Sense is lost in the Race: So that
Writings, though they are not so, yet they sound good or bad According to the
Readers, and not according to their Authors; and indeed such advantage a good
or ill Readers gives, as those that read well, shall give a grace to a foolish
Author, and those that read ill, disgrace a wise and a witty Author. But there
are two sorts of Readers, the one that reads to himself and for his own
benefit, the other to benefit another by hearing it; in the first, there is
required a good Judgment, and a ready Understanding; in the other, a good
Voice, and a graceful Delivery; so that a Writer has a double desire, the one
that he may write well, the other, that he may be read well; And my desire is
the more earnest, because I know my Writings are not strong enough to bear an
ill Reader; wherefore I entreat so much favor, as to give it its own
Countenance, wherein you will oblige the Writer to be

Yours, M. N.

To the Lady of Newcastle, upon her Book Entitled, The WORLD'S OLIO.
THE World, to the World's Olio, we invite you,
And hope these several Cates they may delight you,
It is the Mistress of the Feast her Wish,
And all these various Sorts cookt in Wits Dish;
For several Palats here is of the Best,
With Aromatic Spice of Fancy dressed,
With wholesome Herbs of Judgment, for the Taste
Healthful and Nourishing. This Dish will last
To Feast your Nephews all, if you can fit
The Marriage Act, to get your Children Wit:
For stronger Stomachs Ven'son; if that fail,
And you grow Queasy, then the Lady Quail,
Or the plump Partridge, taste the Phesant, do,
Thus feast your Souls, the Bodies look you too.
An Olio of Confections, not refrain;
For here is a Sumptuous Banquet for your Brain:
And this Imaginary Feast pray try,
Censure your worst, so you the Book will buy.
What the desire of Fame proceeds from.
THE desire of Fame proceeds from a doubt of an after being; And Fame is a
report that travells far, and many times lives long, and the older it grows,
the more it florishes, and is the more particularly a man's own, then the Child
of his loins; for Fame is a child of his merit, which has no compartner in
it, and many times the child of his loins deceives the parent, and instead of
keeping his fathers fame, brings him an infamy: as being a coward, a traitor, a
lier, a fool, or the like: which the world will judge, being apt to cast
aspersions, that they were qualities which he had by inheritance from his
father; but actions that his merits beget, will never deceive him, when it is
rightly and honorably gotten: but there be bastard fames as well as bastard
Issues, which men of honor will never own. But all those that are born are not
so fruitful as to have issues of their brain, or so fortunate as to overcome
their enemies, or so rich to build Towers and Castles, or monuments of fame, or
so happy to have such advantages, to show their own worth and abilities; And
those that cannot leave a child of fame, must content themselves to live a life
of quiet, for fame is seldom gotten with ease, but with pains and labor,
danger and trouble, and oftentimes with life it self.

The Reward of Fame.
IT is a Justice to a man's self; and no vain ostentation or braging, to write
or speak truly of his own good service to his king and country; since none
knows it better then they, that the world may know them; so as to be remembered
with love and honor. For though fame is not always a true Recorder, yet it is
a loud reporter, which is a more certain reward to his merits, then from Kings
and States: For Kings and States most commonly receive the service, and forget
ths reward: and many times gives them disgrace instead of honor, and death for
life. Where fame is so prodigal to those she entertaines, as she will Cozen
the rest of the world, to contribute to her particulars; But time the reviver
of all removes this sound farther off, and many times extinguisheth it quite;
yet Fame the older she is, although she be lame, and goes upon Crouches, the
more lovers and admirers she gains, neither is envy so sharp toothed as to hurt
her, and many are proud, not only to be acquainted with her, but in being able
to mention her: so honorable is ancient Fame.

Of Fame, and Infamy.
SOme love the life of their memory so well, as they would rather choose to be
remembered by the World as a fool, rather then to be forgotten as a beast; Which
is rather to live in Infamy, then to die in obscurity. For Infamy is a loud
reproach, where Fame is a loud Applause, yet neither of them are got by
ordinary means, but by extremes, either by Nature, Fortune, or Fate; As to make
them ring aloud, for the sound to be heard through many Nations, and to live in
many Ages. But infamy has this advantage, if it be one, that it lives longer,
and strikes harder upon the ears of the World, then Fame does.

Fame makes a difference between man and Beast.
NExt, the being born to the glory of God, Man is born to produce a Fame by
some particular acts to prove himself a man, unless we shall say there is no
difference in Nature, between man and beast; For beasts when they are dead, the
rest of the beasts retain not their memory from one posterity to another, as we
can perceive, and we study the natures of Beasts, and their way so subtly, as
surely we should discover somewhat: but the difference betwixt man and beast,
to speak naturally, and only according to her works without any Divine
influence, is, that dead men live in living men, where beasts die without
Record of beasts; So that those men that die in oblivion, are beasts by nature,
for the rational Soul in man is a work of nature, as well as the body, and
therefore ought to be taught by nature to be as industrious to get a Fame to
live to after Ages, as the body to get food for present life, for as natures
principles are created to produced some effects, so the Soul to produce Fame.

What makes Fame speak loudest.
THose Fames that is gotten in the Wars, sound louder then those that are
gotten in Peace, by reason War is a disturber and causes a violent motion,
like a tempest at Sea, sea, or a storm at land, it raises up discord, fear,
and fury, it swallows up industry, it pulls up the root of plenty, it murders
natural affection, and makes such a noise where it is, as all the world besides
is inquiring, and listening after it, for fear of being surprised, so as the
world follows the noise as much as the noise follows them.

The Fame of valor, and wisdom.
IT is a better and more certain Reputation to have the Fame of being a wise
man, then a man of courage, because every man that is wise has courage; for he
that is a coward cannot be wise, because fear puts him out of the right way:
but there be many men that have courage which be not wise, for courage is only
a resolution of the mind, either to Act or suffer, and to destroy or be
destroyed, so that courage does not direct and guide as wisdom does, but dares
and executes, besides wisdom is more to be admired, because it is rarer; as
scarce one wise man is found in an Age; but men of Courage whole Armies full in
every Age, neither is wisdoms Fame subject to fortune as courage is, for Wisdom
makes fortune her servant, and uses all times and accidents to her advantage,
and the worse her fortune is, the greater she appears, when the Fame of courage
is a slave to fortune, and only flourishes in her smiles, but is buried in her
frowns.

It is true, Courage is a virtue that defends and protects its Country, and
keeps an enemy in awe, yet it is a virtue that is only exercised in
destructior, in the patient suffering of his own, or the acting to another.
Where wisdom is always exercised in uniting and composing, searching and
leading into the ways of peace, when courage chooses and searches for the
ways of danger, and courts her as his loveliest and beautifullest Mistress, and
is many times so courageous as he, forces her, and had rather die in the arms
of danger, then live in the arms of peace.

Why men write Books.
SOme say men write books, not so much to benefit the world, as out of love to
Fame, thinking to gain them honor of reputation; but surely men are so
delighted with their own conceits, When I say write, its either by Heroic, or
otherwise they say letters was ever since Seths time.
especially fine and new ones, that were it a sin or infamy, they would write
them, to see their beauty and enjoy them, and so become unlawful Lovers;
Besides thoughts would be lost, if not put into writing; for writing is the
picture of thoughts, which shadows last longer then men, but surely men would
commit secret Idolatry to their own wit, if they had not Applause to satisfy
them, and examples to humble them, for every several man, if wit were not
discovered, would think not any had it but he, for men take pleasure first in
their own fancies, and after seek to gain the approving opinions of others:
which opinions are like women's dressings; for some will get such advantage in
putting on their clothes, who although they have ill faces, and not so exact
bodies, will make a better show then those that are well favored, and neatly
shaped, with disordered attire, wherein some men are so happy in their language
and delivery, as it beautisies and adorns their wit, which without it would be
like an unpolished Diamond, but such difference there is between, that to
create a fancy is the nature of a God, but to make neat and new words, is the
nature of a Tailour.

Of several writings.
WRitings that are set forth in books and other ways, are of several and
different natures; For some, as Magistrates and Fathers, do reprove and
endeavor to reclaim the world and men, as moral Philosophers; others as
Atturnies do inform them, as Historians; some as Lawyers do plead in the behalf
of some former writings, and acts against others as contraversers; some as
Ambitious Tyrants, that would kill all that stood in their way, as Casuists;
some as Challengers, as Logicians; some as Scouts, as natural Philosophers; But
they bring not always true intelligence. Some like hang-men as the Scepticks
that strive to strangle, not only all opinions, but all knowledge; Some like
Ambassadors that are sent to condole and congratulate, as books of
Humiliation and thanksgiving; Some as Merchants, as translatours, which
traffic out of one Language into another; Some as painted faces, as Oratory;
some as Jubilies, as to recreate, rejoice, and delight the spirits of men, as
Poetry; some as Bawds to entice the minds, as Amorous Romancy; Some as pits
that one must go many Fathoms deep to find the bottom, neither do they always
reach it, as those that are called strong lines. some as Conjurers, that fright
with their threatening prophesies, some as Cut-purses that steal from the
writings of others; some as Juglers that would have falsehood appear for truth;
some like Mountibanks that deceive, and give more words then matter; some as
Echoes which commonly answer to another voice; some like Buffons that laugh
and jest at all, and some like Flatterers that praise all; and some like
Malcontents that complain against all; and some like God that is full of
truth, and gives a due to all deservers; and some like devils that slauder all.

Of the motion of the thoughts in speaking and Writing.
THose that have very quick thoughts, shall speak readier then Write, because
in speaking they are not tied to any style, or number; besides in speaking,
thoughts lie close and careless, but in writing they are gathered up, and are
like the water in a cup, that the mouth is held downward: for every drop
striving to be out first, stops the passage, or like the common people in an
uproar, that runs without any order, and disperses without success, when slow
and strong thoughts come well armed and in good order, discharges with courage,
and goes off with honor.

The motion of Poets thoughts.
THe thoughts of poets must be quick, yet so as they must go even without
justling, strong without striving, nimble without stumbling, for their thoughts
must be as an instrument well strung, and justly tuned to Harmony.

Great scholars are not excellent Poets.
SCholars are never good Poets, for they incorporate too much into other men,
which makes them become less themselves, in which great scholars are
Metamorphos'd or transmigrated into as many several shapes, as they read
Authors, which makes them monstrous, and their head is nothing but a lumber
stuffed with old commodities, so it is worse to be a learned Poet then a Poet
unlearned, but that which makes a good Poet, is that which makes a good Privy
Councellor, which is, observation, and experience, got by time and company.

Wit mistaken.
THey are not mistaken that think all Poets wits, but those are mistaken that
think there is no other wit but in Poets, or to think wit lies in mere jests,
or only in words, or Method, or scholastical knowledge; for many may be very
wise, and knowing, yet have not much wit: not but wit may be in every one of
these before mentioned, for wit makes use of althings, but wit is the purest
element, and swiftest motion of the brain, it is the essence of thoughts, it
incircles all things, and a true wit is like the Elixer that keeps nature
always fresh, and young.

Some thinks wit no wit when it is not understood; but surely a fool makes not
the wit the less, although it loses its aim, if none knows it but the Author.

A comparison betwixt learning and Wit.
IT is a great mistake in some who think that great Stcholars are great wits,
because great Scholars; but there is as great a difference as betwixt a natural
inheritance that is intailed, and cannot be sold, and a Tenant that makes use
of the land, and pays the rent, which is due to the Landlord, which is the
Author; or in another comparison a Scholar is like a great Merchant that
trafficks in most Countries for transportable Commodities, and his head is the
warehouse to lay those goods in: now may some say, they are become his own,
since he bought them, it is true they are so to keep them, or make use of them,
or to sell, and traffic with them, by imparting them to petty Merchants,
which are young students and Scholars, but otherwise they are no more his, then
when they were in the Authors head; before it was published, but only by
retaile, for wit is the child of nature, neither has she made any thing so
like her self as it; Nay, she has made it to outdo her self, for though
nature has not only made this world, but may be thought by reason to have
made many others, and so a world of worlds, yet wit creats in its imaginations,
not only worlds but I mean Corporeal gods, and devils, hels and heavens.
Heavens, and Hells, Gods, and Devils, only it wants the materials, to put
them in body, and give them a figure and color.

The advanaage of Poetry, and History.
POets make us see errors, as what we should follow, and what we should shun,
it revives the spirits, it animates the mind, it creats wit in the readers
brain, it is a shop of curious varieties, where every one may see for their
love, and buy for their pains; but a true Poet is like a Spider that spins all
out of her own bowels. And though the web be Artificial, yet that art is
natural, not exemplary, but as Poets make us find our own errors, so History
shows us the errors of others, and gives us advantage, by inabling us to look
back to former times, for it increases and strengthens men's courage, by
reading their battles, it begets patience, in reading their miseries, it
humbles the mind, in perceiving the changes of fortune, Witty in reading their
orations, Civil in knowing their Ceremonies; so that History is a repetition of
things past, and is bound to write nothing but what have been done, and Poetry
is a recreation for times present, which is neither bound to line, nor level.

The difference between Poesy and History.
THere is as much difference betwixt a Poets style and an Historians, as a
French galliard and a Spanish pavinne, besides Poetry is most fiction, and
History should be truth; Poesy may be fantastical, History must be grave,
Poesy is to move passions, History is to confirm truth; History draws the mind
to look back Poesy, to look right forth; Poesy is simulising, History is
repetition; Poesy is beautiful and spritely; History is brown and lovely; Poesy
goes upon his own ground; but History goes upon the ground of others.

Of Historians and Poets.
TRuth should be the guide of an Historian; yet the truth of History should not
be dressed in Poetical fancies, but with grave Rethorick; Truth should be
delivered civilly, not rudely; it should be ushered in with eloquence; for
truth should be delivered smoothly, comely, sweet and Harmoniously; not rudely,
roughly, basely, fantastically, nor contemptibly: but a Poet will never make a
good Historian, because he is too full of fancy and invention, which may
disturb his way; for a Poet, though he uses numbers, yet he keeps no
reckoning, where an Historian makes an exact account, but as a Historians brain
is too slow for a Poets, so a Poets brain is too quick for an Historians.

A Poet the best General Judge.
A Natural Philosopher may judge well the motions of the Elements, and a moral
of the dividing, or dissecting of passions, or framing of Commonwealths; but
there is much division amongst them of the way. So a Divine may judge well of
the mystery of Religion; although there is as much contradiction amongst them
as with the Philosophers; So Historians may judge of some particulars; being
conversant in the action of times; but Logicians seldom; for if judgment is
the last act of reasoning, as it is, or it is not, in which Logicians seldom
come to a conclusion; nor Mathematitians if their chief study be Arithmetic;
for then they are too much addicted to multiply, and diminish. Most of these
before mentioned are too hard set in intricate studies; and dwell too long upon
them; at least these particular judgments had need be good, for their time
will not give them leave to consider of many things; but Poet are quick of
invention, easy to conceive, ready in executing, and flies over all the world,
yet not so swiftly, but they take a strickt notice of all things, and knows
perfectly the laws, and ways which inables them to judge more uprightly, and
having an universal knowledge, joined to his natural wit, makes him the best
general judge. For a good Poet has distinguishment which is judgment, as well
as similising, which is fancy; I mean, not those Poets which can only rhyme, but
those Poets which can reason, not those that have most art, but those that have
most nature, for he is not a good Poet, that is not born one.

The difference of Poetry.
POets most usually put their fancies into verse or scenes, and verse is
numbered fancy, and scenes are distinguishing of humors; the scenes are most
commonly acted upon Theaters; for action is the life of humor; besides, it
clears the understanding, and makes a deeper impression in the mind of the
spectatours, then when they are only read; and these expressions of humors,
not only shows errors that are past, or those that may come; but vices that
are to be shunned, and virtues that are to be followed; besides, it begets hate
to the one by discovering the deformities, and love to the other, by the
expresing of her beauty, which is beneficial, and a good instruction to the
ignorant lives of men; but the meaner and smaller Poets, if they may have the
honorable name of Poets, do more harm then good; for their scenes are rather
Romancical tales, then the expressions of men's natures; in which they only
teach effeminate men, and foolish women to be whining lovers: and there be
others, although they be good Poets, yet they are ill natured ones, and so
crabbed as they corrode both the ear, and the mind, in which they seem to
observe the ill humors more then the good, as if they lay to watch, to steal,
and entrap men's vices: and take them up by little parcels, to sell them out by
whole sale, and seem glad that men have vices for them to divulge. But those
sorts of Poets correct too much, and encourage too little: but again, some are
so flattering, and insinuating, as they become parasits to men's humors.

Of Verses.
IT is not every Poet that can make a good copy of verses, nor proper scenes,
neither is a particular copy or scene enough for an applause, but a life full,
and the spring must be naturally, and flow easy, not forced by pipes from other
men's wit, for those are but watery brains, that have neither oil nor fire,
which make their fancy so dull, as their conceits are enchanted; and some fly
so high, as if they would rend the wings of their brain, which weary others
brains to find them out, and when they find them, they are not worth their
pains; were taken for them; for what writing soever is darkened, or obscured
either in the sense, or by hard and unusual words, grows troublesome and
unpleasant to the readers; again some are so long and tedious upon a subject as
they lose their wit: for wit never dwells long upon one thing, other Poets their
verses are untunable; they do not strike upon the strings of the soul, for the
excellency of Poetical wit is to move passion, it is true, numbers without wit
will move passion, but they cannot keep or make passion stay, and it may strike
upon a passion but it cannot raise one, yet wit appears best when it is drawn
in triumph in the golden Chariot of numbers.

The comparison of Poets.
A Poet may be compared to a musician, that plays upon four and twenty
strings; so Poets strike upon four and twenty letters, for a Poet will tune his
readers voice, to his own passions, as tomake the voices to go by numbers; rise
and fall by their several strains of wit; like light Cellebrands, or
Currantoes; or merry Jyggs, or grave Pavins, or melancolly Lacrimacs; for Poets
translate men's minds into as many several shapes; as they write fancies.

What Romancy is.
ROmancy is an adulterate Issue, begot betwixt History and Poetry; for Romancy
is as it were poetical fancies; put into a Historical style; but they are
rather tales then fancies; for tales are number of impossibilities: put into a
methodical discourse, and though they are taken from grounds of truth, yet they
are heightened to that degree, as they become mere falsehoods; where poetry is an
Imitatour of nature to create new, not a falsefying of the old: and History
gives a just account, not enlarging the reckning. History, if it be
simuliseing, and distinguishing, it is pure poetry, if it be a lie made from
truth it is Romancy.

Of Comedies.
A Comedy should present virtue, and point at vice, for a Comedy should be to
delight, and not to displease, a good Comedian wit, will only reprove not
reproach; but a satirrical wit will present the vices of two or three in the
person of one, but a gentle spirit which is a true Commical wit, will rather
take the vice of one, and represent them in two or three persons, Satyr is more
proper for a Comedy Tragedy then for pure Comedy; not that a true comedy will
flatter vice, but palliat it.

Of Scenes.
Some that are worthy of Commendations, are naturally pleasing, and witty, and
so profitable, with such variety, that every Scene is like a new master that
teaches several arts, not only for the youngest, but oldest men to learn.

Of the Labyrinth of Fancy.
THe reason why men run in such obscure conceits, is, because they think their
wit will be esteemed, and seem more when it lies an odd and unusual way, which
makes their verse not like a smooth running stream; but as if they were shelves
of sand, or rocks in the way, and though the water in those places goes with
more force, and makes a greater sound: yet it goes hard and uneasy. As if to
express a thing hard, were to make it better, but the best poetry is plain to
the understanding, of easy expressions, and full of fresh and new conceits: like
a beauty that every time it is looked upon discovers new graces; besides they
do not only move passions, but make passions, for a right poetical wit turns
hard and rough nature, to a soft, gentile, and kind disposition: for verses
are fine fancies, which are spun in the imagination to a small and even thread,
but some are worse spinsters then others.

The degrees of wit.
THose have not clear judgments that applaud or cry up one man's wit, that was
begot from another man's brain; but some, though their wit is their own, yet it
is like comets that seldom appear, it shows it self no once in an age; and
some again are like the moon, that changes it self into four quarters, as the
new, the increase, the full, and the wane: others are like the sun that runs
swiftly, and keeps its constant course. some like the spring sweet and
pleasant, others like the Summer, hot, but troublesome, some like Autumn, warm,
and sober, and others like the Winter, cold and dry, yet all kind of
seasonable wit is commendable, but most commonly wit is like the wind colic,
the one rumbles as much in the head: as the other in the stomach.

Of sense and Fancy.
THose books, or discourses that are fullest of sense, delight the fewest,
because every brain is not so ready to dispose conceits in, to fill places for
the understanding, to view suddenly as it is thrown in but lies in a confused
heap, without ordering, and a slow understanding, is like a lasie workman,
although he be skilful in his art, and does it well when he is employed
thereupon; but rather then he will take the pains, he he will lose the profit,
but conceits must be delivered, as things by retail for the reason must set the
number, and the deliverer give the account.

Wit is natural.
SOme think to get or learn wit, but wit is neither to be learnt nor gotten,
for it is a free gift of nature, and disclaimes art; and as there are but two
qualities or substances go to the generation of all other things, which is heat
and moisture, yet there are seven that go to the generation of wit, as the
temper and form of the brain and the five senses, which beget imagination,
which imaginations we call fancies, which fancies is wit, which is like
eternity in being fixed, and yet proves a perpetual motion, with continual
changes and varieties; I mean a true born wit, that is begot with an equal
tempered and perfect formed brain, and quick, fresh, and clearing,
distinguishing senses, there are adulterate wits that are begotten with
distempers, as fevers, madness or chance, but they are short, and not
lasting, the other has neither bottom nor circumference, but is as a continued
line, and they that think to ripen their own wit by the heat of another
imagination, tastes like fruit that is ripened by the chimnie, and not by the
natural heat of the Sun, which gives it a rheumatical taste; for there are not
only changelings in wit, but defective births, that is when the parents which
are the brain are imperfect and lame, but if the parents be clear, the issue is
always beautiful, and neatly shaped, so as it becomes the delight and darling
in the society of mankind.

Peace shows the best wits, War the most writers.
IN Augustus his time, there was such a number of wits, as if nature had sown a
crop, which being reapt and gathered, ferved At that time all the world was in
peace
to the use of after times; this shows that in peace there is the best wits,
and that wit is purest and finest, when the mind is most quiet and peaceable;
but in war there are the most writers, for war being full of factions,
produces subjects to write of, for in peace there is little or nothing but
what they create from their own brain: so in peace brains set the print on
work, in war hands.

Of Study.
THe reason why study seems difficult at first, and easier and clearer
afterward, is, that the imagination has not beaten out a pathway of
understanding in the head, which when it has, thethoughts run even and right,
without the pains of deep study; for when the way is made, they need no search
to find one out, for the brakes, or rubbish, of ignorance, that obstructed the
thoughts, is trodden into the firm and hard ground of knowledge.

Of writers.
MOst moderate writers do but new dress old Authors, though they give them
another fashion garment, the person is the same, but some do disguise them so
much, that a vulgar eye cannot perceive them, but mistake the Author, through
the alteration of the habir.

An History and Romancy, is more delightful in general, then fancy, for women
and fools, are taken with tales, but none but one wit is taken with another.

Of Translatours.
IT is not enough for Translatours to be learned in the several Languages; but
there must be sympathy between the genius of the Authors, and the Translatours,
which every age does not produce: for most commonly a genius is not matched in
many ages. Ovids genius was matched by Sans, and Dubartus was matched by
Silvester; but Homer is not yet matched in our Language; for though the work
was endeavored to be translated, yet it is not like him; and though the copy
of a Picture is not so well as the original, yet good copies draw so near the
life, that none but a curious and skilful eye, shall perceive the difference;
so a good Translatour shall write so like the Author; that none but the most
learned and that with study and great observance shall find the defects.

Of Translating.
SOme may be of opinion that it is a fault to turn the Scripture into verse,
unless the original be so, or to change the style, as to the matter, or sense,
into other men's fancies, but to follow the fancy of the Original, as near as
the Language permits they translate it in; for it is, as if a man should have a
high roman nose, and one should take the picture of him, and draw him with a
flat nose, as liking that fashioned nose better; it may go under the name of
that man, but it will be nothing like him, or why should one nation be drawn in
the habit of another, since they are different: and though the distinctions of
several nations in pictures, can only be known by their habits; and many times
they do not only change the graver and formal fashions, from one nation to
another, but dress them in their fantastical dress: but if they do it to
please the Luxurious palats of men, they rather become insinuators, then
translatours: and they deserve no food that will not eat good and wholesome
food, unless they be humoured with variety of new and strange sauces; but they
will say the stomach cannot bear plain meat, and that they will faint if they
have not choice: but it is their compounds that make their stomakes quezie, and
the solid meat that will increase their strength: where now they pick quarrels
unless the truth be disguised with the flourishes of the translatours: as
those that strive to translate David's Psalms, take David's name to his poetry,
so keep his name, and lose the poetry of the Original, by the translatours vain
glory, for every one striving to outdo another until they have lost the right
and truth. For to express any thing in huge words, does not make it the
better, but only harder to be understoodfor; men of reason consider the soul
and sense, and not the form and fashion, which is but the habit, and an honest
devotion will as soon believe the History of the world, and of Adam, and Eve,
with the progress of their race in a plain relation of the truth, then with
the measure of numbers: for though numbers move passion, yet they do not so
easily ground a belief, neither is it in the power of numbers, but the spirit
of God that can move that unfeigned passion that must carry us to heaven.

Of Languages
GReek and Latin, and all other Languages are of great ornament to Gentlemen,
but they must spend so much time in learning them, as they can have no time to
speak them, and some will say it is a great advancement to wisdom, in knowing
the natures, humors, laws, and customs of several men, and nations; which they
cannot do, except they understand their several Languages to answerthat,
although al Languages are expressed by four and twenty letters, yet there is no
Language which will not take up an age, to learn it perfectly as to know every
circumstance; and since man's life is so short, and learning so tedious, there
will accrue but little profit for that laborious pains, so that the benefit that
should be made will come too late, but surely these men are wise enough which
understand the natures, laws, and customs of their own country, and can apply
them to their right use.

Of Eloquence, art, and speculation.
MAny do seem to admire those writings, whose styles are eloquent and through
ignorance takes it for eloquence, commending the method, instead of the matter,
the words instead of the sense, the paint instead of the face; the garb instead
of the person, but hard and unusual phrases, are like a constraint behavior,
it has a set countenance, treads nicely, taking short steps, and carries the
body so stiff, and upright, as it seems difficult, and uneasy: like those
that think it a part of good breeding to eat their meat by rule, and measure;
opening the mouth at a just, and certain wideness; grinding the meat betwixt
their teeth, like a Clock with so many strokes as make an hour, so many bits
makes a swallow; so likewise if the little finger be not bowed short, and by
degrees all their fingers to be joynted until the forefinger, and the thumb,
meets in a round circle, they think al other vulgarly bred. But nature is easy:
and art hard, and what resembles nature nearest, is most to the life: and what
is most to the life, is best; but art belongs more to the Mechanics, and
Pesants, then to the noble and free, and all arts belong more to actions then
speculations; and though speculations be nothing until it be put into practice,
yet the best actions come from the clearest speculations, for speculations are
like the king, to command and rule, practice the slave, to obey, and work, but
there are more arts, and inventions gotten by chance, and practice, then merely
by ingenuity of brain.

Of Orators.
I Have heard say, that Orators are seldom wise men for they study so much of
the words, as they consider not the matter; for though method in words may
please the sense of the ear, yet not the understanding; for they that will
speak wisely, must speak the next way to the matter, or business, but if it be
in such a case as the ear is more to be desired then the understanding, they
must speak composedly, for Rethorick is choosing words fitted such a subject,
and though study and society sweetens Language; yet if it have not a natural
elegance, it shall not work so strongly upon the senses.

What discourses are enemies to Society.
OF all discourses, the worst enemy to society is the divulging the infirmities
of others; wherein some are so evil natured in striving to defame others, as
they will not only use all their rethorick to make their faults appear more
odious, or their virtues less, but will strive to make their virtues seem
vices, when to discover infirmities is ignoble, but to lessen virtues is the
part of an envious man, which is the nature of a devil; and since union is the
bond of society, the discourse should always tend to peace, and not to
discord: for there is no man but has virtues to praise, as well as vices to
dispraise, and it is as easy to take the better side; I am sure it is more
honorable for the speaker, for faults in particular should never be mentioned,
but in private to themselves, in an admonishing way, otherwise they do but
inveterate. The next enemy to society in discourse is disputation, which
affords the least pleasure in society, for first it is tedious, next it is
contradictory, and begets enemies of friends, and it is a kind of rudeness to
contradict strangers, though they should speak nonsense, but Logic, which is
the art of disputations should be left to Schools, writings, and public
Theaters, which are appointed places for such discourse; for some say Logic is
to make truth appear, others that it is to make falsehood appear like truth, and
some say again, that it is to dispute on both sides, and that it makes more
discord then it can compose, which is discord, the cause of so many writings,
and several religions, and factions in the world, which makes men become Tigers
and Vultures to one another, when otherwise they would be like the society of
Angels. The last and worst enemy to society, is forswearing and blasphemy; for
what pleasure or advantage can a man have to blaspheme, which is to curse God,
who has the power to return his curses on his head, with horrid punishments;
and for swearing, though it be allowed for the confirmation of a truth, and for
the keeping of a promise whereby it is made sacred and religious, yet to make
it common is to make it of no effect. Besides it shows little wit and less
memory, that they should want words to fill up their discourse with, but what
oaths are fain to supply; and for lying where there is no truth, there can can
be no trust; and where there is no trust, there can be no union; and where
there is no union, there can be no perfect society, but may rather be called a
concourse, which is to meet rather then to unite, where society is the father
of peace, the bond of love, the arm of strength, the head of policy, the heart
of courage, the hand of industry, and the bowels of charity; and discourse is
the life which gives light to the eyes of the understanding, sound to the ears,
mirth to the heart, comfort to the sorrowful and afficted, patience to the
oppressed; entertains the time, recreates the mind, refreshes the memory, makes
the desires known, and is a heavenly consort.

The best kind of discourse in ordinary conversation.
THe best kind of discourse in ordinary conversation, and most pleasant, is
that which is most various, free and easy, as to discourse of countries, the
natures of soyles, Scituations of Cities, and peoples laws, customs, and
superstitions; what men women and beasts were deisied; what Countries had most
and longest wars and peace: what Conquerours there were, and who they were:
what conducts they used in their victories, how they marshalled their forces,
and what forces they had: what famous Common-wealths-men there were, their
policies in governments, the beginning of States, their fauls, the causes of
their risings, and their ruins; what Countries were governed by republikes, or
Dimocracy: what by Aristocracy, and what by Monarchy; what commodities several
Countries afford for traffic, or otherwise; what Plantations there, are and
what men famous for arts, what arts there are: what famous buildings and
monuments there are, or have been, and who were their founders: what Colleges
or Schools there are, or have been of famous and learned men, as Philosophers,
Historians, and of their several opinions, what ancient Poets, and who were
accounted the best; what Countries they were born, bred, or lived in; what
punishments or exiles there were, or what faults, what cruelties were put in
execution, and by whom, and to whom, and where, and what Kings governed with
clemency, and what by tyranny, and what their factions, their splendours, their
decays, their pastimes, and recreations were: what Ambassadors there were and
their ambassages, from kings to kings, and States to States what entertainments
and magnisicencies, Princes make; what several fashions, several Countries have
in their entertainments and sports: what extravagant garbs, and diets; what
women famous for beauty, and marshal exployts; what kind of people can live
the hardest, and which live the most luxurious, and for discourses of mirth,
songs, verses, scenes, and the like: and for their home discourses, according
to their affairs, and employments; and this is better discourse then to
backbite their friends, or to curse their foes, or to scandal the innocent, or
sediciously to complain against their government and governors, or to speak
lasciviously to foul the ears of the chaste, and there is no wit in a clownish
discourse, and to speak like a Gentleman, is to speak honestly, civilly, and
confidently: to speak a wise man, is to speak properly, timely, and knowingly,
and not conceltedly.

The four discourses.
THere are four kinds of discourses, as foolish, extravagant, nonsense, and
rational, and of all nonsense is the hardest; for to speak foolishly, is as if
a man should speak to a child, that can have no experience of knowledge of
affairs in the world or judgment to distinguish, or to a shepherd that never
saw nor heard many things or reports, but only his sheep and their bleatings:
as to ask any questions of battles, or governments of Commonwealths, or to
discourse with States men of childrens babies, bells, or rattles: which is to
speak improperly and not timely: and to speak extravagantly is, as if a man
were to sell his house, and another should ask him what he should give him for
it, and he should answer him in talking of transmigrations, and metamorphoses,
or the like, and so to speak quite from the purpose: but to speak rationally,
is to ask proper questions, or to answer directly to what he is questioned in,
for reason is to clear the understanding and to untie the knots that clear the
truth; but to speak nonsense is to speak that which has no coherence to any
thing, when there is no words but may be compared to something, and though it
has no reference to what is spoken, yet it might have to what might be spoken:
so as it is harder to find out nonsense in words, then reason.

Of Vulgar discourse.
THe reason why the Vulgar has not such varieties of discourse, is not only
because they have not read, or hard, or seen so much of the world, as the
better sort has: but because they have not so many several words for several
things, for that language which is most copious wit flourishes most in for
fancy in Poetry without expression of words is but dead, for that makes a
Language full to have many several words for one thing or sense, and though the
vulgar is born and bred with such a Language, yet very seldom with variety and
choice being employed in the course affairs of the world, and not bred in
Schools or Courts, where are the most significant, choicest, and plentifullest
expressions, which make the better sort, not only have siner and sweter
discourse but fill them full of high and a spiring thoughts, which produce noble
qualities, and honorable actions where the meaner sort of people are not only
ignorant of the purity of their native Language, but corrupts what they have,
and being always grovelling in the dung of the earth, where all their thoughts
are employed, which makes their discourse so unsavory.

Of old men's talking too much.
THe reason why old men love rather to tell stories, then to hear them, is,
because the outward senses decay sooner then the understanding, and hearing
imperfectly wearies them by tedious attention, for though old men many times
grow deaf, yet they seldom grow dumb with age, and when one faculty fails,
they strive to supply it with another, which makes them commit the error of
too much talking.

Of speaking much or little.
THose that speak little are either wise men or crafty men, either to observe
what was spoken by others, or not to discover themselves too suddenly; and
those that speak much, are either fools, or else very witty men, fools because
they have little to entertain them in their thoughts, and therefore imploys the
tongue to speak like a Parrote by roat, and fools think the number of words
helps to fill up the vacant places of sense; but those that have wit, their
brains are so full of fancy, that if their tongue like a midwife, should not
deliver some of the hlue of the brain, it would be over-powred, and lost in
painful throws.

Of the same defect in Women.
ANd the reason why women are so apt to talk too much, is an overweening
opinion of them selves in thinking they speak well, and striving to take off
that blemish from their sex of knowing little, by speaking much, as thinking
many words have the same weight of much knowledge: but my best friend says he
is not of my opinion, for he says women talk, because they cannot hold their
tongues.

Of Silence.
IT is said that silence is a great virtue, it is true, in a sick persons
chamber, that loves no noise, or at the dead time of night, or at such times as
to disturb natural rest, or when superiors are by, or in the discourse of
another, or when attention should be given, or if they have great impediments
of speech, and speaking many times is dangerous, infamous, rude, foolish,
malicious, envious, and false. But it is a melancholy conversation that has no
sound, and though silence is very commendable at sometimes, yet in some cases
it is better to speak too much then too little, as in hospitality, and the
receiving civil visits; for it were better their strangers and friends, should
think your talk too much, then that they should be displeased in thinking they
were not welcome by speaking too little: besides it is a less fault to err
with too much courtesy, then with too much neglect, and surely to be accounted
a fool is not so bad as to be said to be rude; for the one is the fault of the
judger, the other is the fault of the actor or speaker; for civility is the
life to society, and society to humane nature: it is true that there are more
errors committed in speaking, then in silence, for words are light and subtle
and airie, as that when they are once flowne out, cannot be recalled again, but
only to ask pardon with more: and there is an old saying, to talk much and well
is seldom heard, but it cannot be verified in all, for some will speak well as
long as there is grounds to speak on, but the length of time makes it sound to
the ear, as wine tastes to a drunken man, when he cannot relish between good
and bad; so that it is not only the matter, but the manner, time and subject
in speaking, which makes it so hard to speak well, or please many, and though
it be always pleasing to the speaker to delight others, yet that does not
always please others that he delights to speak of: as there is nothing more
tedious to strangers then to hear a man talk much of himself, or to weary them
with long complements; and though civilityin that kind ought to be used; yet
they should carry such forms and times as not to lose respect to themselves, or
to be over troublesome in long expressions to others, but there is few but
loves to hear themselve talk, even preachers; for a preacher that preaches
long, loves rather to talk then to edify the people, for the memory must not
be oppressed in what they should learn, or their reproofs too sharp in what
they should mind, for with one word or two of reproof he reforms, half a score
undoes again, which makes it a railing instead of exhortation; neither is it
always required, for a man to speak according to his profession or employment
in the affairs of the world; for it would be ridiculous for a Lawyer in
ordinary conversation, to speak as if he were pleading at the bar, yet every
one ought to have respect in his discourse to his condition, calling, or
dignity, or to the quality of others, for it is not fit that a Priest which
either is, or should be a man of peace, to speak like a soldier, which is a
man of war, or to speak to a noble man as to a peasant; again, there is nothing
so much takes away the sweetness of discourse as long preambles, or
repetitions, and indeed the whole discourse is tedious, and unpleasing if it be
overlong, though their tongues were as smooth as oil, and run upon the ways
of truth, yet too much does as it were over-fil the head, and stop the ears,
for the head will be as the stomach when it is over charged, it will take
surfeit of the most delicious meat; wherefore in speaking judgment is
required, yet some are so over-wise in the ordering their discourse, as it is
not only troublesome to themselves, but a pain to the hearers having so set and
constraint a way of speaking, as if their words went upon hard scrues, when
there is nothing so easy as speech; for there is no part of man so unwearily
active as the tongue, and of the other side, some are so full of talk, as they
will neither give room nor time to others to speak, and when two or three such
persons, of this voluble quality or nature meet, they make such a confusion in
speaking altogether, as it becomes a tumultuous noise, rather then sociable
discoursing: which is a disturbance to society, for discourse should be like
music in parts

Betwixt reason and reasonings.
THere is a great difference betwixt reason and reasoning, for reason is the
best and soberest and surest rule of a man's life either in contemplation or
action, for in action it recollects, disposes, and orders all things for
man's safety, profit, and pleasure, and for contemplation, it keeps the mind
with even thoughts, but reasoning belongs to contradiction, and where
contradiction is there can be no unity, or conformity, and where there is no
unity nor conformity there must needs be discord and confusion, reasoning is
the cause of raising of doubts reason is to allay them, so that reasoning makes
a man mad, but reason makes a man sober. But some will say we should never come
to reason but by reasoning; but I say, reason comes by observation of
consequences and accidents, and reasoning is vain inbred-imaginations, without
the experience of the concurrence of outward things so reason is bred with
strickt observing, and produced by fear of losing, and hopes of keeping or
getting, but reasoning is bred in vanity and produced by vain glory.

Of the Senses and Brain.
SOme say that there is such a nature in man, that he would conceive and
understand without the senses, though not so clearly, if he had but life which
is motion Others say, there is nothing in the understanding, that is not sirst
in the senses, which is more probable, for the senses bring all the materials
into the brain, and then the brain cuts and divides them, and gives them quite
other forms, then the senses many times presented them; for of one object the
brain makes thousands of several figures, and these figures are those things
which are called imagination, conception, opinion, under standing, and
knowledge, which are the Children of the brain, these put into action, are
called arts and sciences, and every one of these have a particular and proper
motion, function, or trade, as the imagination, and conception, builds,
squares, inlayes, grinds, moulds, and fashions all, opinion, caries shows, and
presents the materials to the conception, and imagination; understanding
distinguishes the several parcels, and puts them in right places, knowledge is
to make the proper use of them, and when the brain works upon her own
materials, and at home, it is called poetry and invention, but when the brain
receives and words journey-work, which is not of its own materials, then it is
called learning, and imitation, but opinion makes great faction and disorder
among them, disagreeing much with the understanding, in presenting and bringing
the wrong for the right, and many times with clamor and obstinacy carries it,
especially when a strange opinion out of another brain, comes and joins with
the other, and the brain many times is so taken with his neighbor brains
figures, that he fills up his house so full of them, that he leaves no room
for his own to work or abide in: but some brains are so weak as they have few
or no figures of their own, but only plain pieces, and some again so slow of
motion, and so lazy, as they will not take pains to cut and to carve, or to
try, but lets that which the senses bring in lie like bags or stone, and makes
no use of them, and will furnish his head neither with his own nor others; but
the brain is like unto Commonwealths, for some brains that are well tempered,
are like those Commonwealths, that are justly and peaceably governed, and live
in their own bounds: other brains that are hotly tempered, are like those
commonwealths that make wars upon their neighbors; others again that are
unevenly tempered, are like those that are incombred with civil wars amongst
themselves; a cold brain is like those Nations that are so lazy, as they will
use no industry to the improving of their Country, so a brain may be compared
to several soyls, as some are rich in mines and quarries, others pleasant and
fruitful, some brains are barren and insipid some will be improved with change
of tillage or working, others, the more it is used, the better it is, and some
the worse; and though accidents give the grounds to some arts, yet they are but
rude and uneasy, until the brain has polished and fitted them, for as the
senses give the brain the first matter, so the brain sends that matter formed
and sigured to the senses again, to be dispersed abroad, which sometimes is
sent by the understanding, sometimes by opinions, so he that has his senses
most employed and perfectest, knows more then they that have not their senses
exercised in varicties, yet the senses give not the height of knowledge,
unless the brain be of such a temper to dispose them; for the brains are like
eyes, where some are so quick, as they cannot fasten upon an object, to view
the perfection of it, others, so dull, they cannot see clearly, or so slow they
cannot untie themselves soon enough, but dwells too long upon it, so it is the
discussing of the object well, that increases or begets knowledge.

Of sense, reason, and faith.
A Man has sense, reason, and faith; reason is above sense, and under faith;
for one half of reason joins to sense, which is the part that is demonstrative;
but that part that is not demonstrative, is beyond the sensitive knowledge, so
as it fallsinto conjectures, and probabilities, and from probabilities to
belief, and an excessive belief is faith, for we cannot call that a perfect
knowledge which our reason singly tell us, but what our perfect, and healthful
senses joined with our reason distinguish to us: there are two sorts of faith,
the one is divine, which is given to man by an inspiring grace; and the other
natural, which is by rational conjectures, probabilities, and comparatives.

Of wisdom and foolishness
THat we call wisdom does not only consist in perfect knowledge, or clear
understanding, but observations carefully put in practice in times of occasion,
which is that we call prudence, and where accidents are not observed, but
follows the appetites, the senses persuade to take, are called fools, so wisdom
is the clerk to man's life, to write down all, and the trustee to receive all,
the steward to lay out all, but not the surveigher to know all, for that
belongs to a clear and general understanding; and one may be wise, and yet not
know all; the difference betwixt a fool and a wise man is that the wise man
seeks the food of his appetite with care, observing all accidents, watching
all times, taking all opportunities to the best for himself: the fool runs
wildly about without a sking or learning the best, nearest or right ways, yet
greedily hunts after his desires, which desires are according to every man's
delectation,

Of mad men and fools.
MAd men and fools meet in one and the same point of wanting of judgment,
which is to distinguish what is most likely to be the best or worst for
themselves; I say most likely, because none knows absolutely but by the event,
for chance has such power over every thing, that many times it becomes rather
her work then the choosers; but yet she does not take away the likelihood or
probability of it, where all concurrences meet: and though chance lie so
obscure, as the providen'st man cannot epsy her so as to avoid her, yet a wise
man prepares for her assaults, but a mad man or a fool leaves all to chances
disposing, not to judgments ordering or directing.

A man that is mad is not out of his wits.
WE cannot say a man that is mad is out of his wits, but out in his judgment,
for a mad man will speak extreme wittily sometimes, and though it be by chance,
yet it is his own wit, but not his judgment to choose the best, for then he
would always strive to speak to some purpose, or hold his peace, which mad men
never do, but speak at random, not caring what he speaks, nor to whom he
speaks, nor when he speaks: now the fool comes like the mad man in his actions,
rather then in his words, for judgment lies not altogether in the choice of
speech, but more in the choice of actions, now a fool neither knows nor
believes in the likeliest way to good, nor to avoid ill, and a mad man cares
not which is the way to good or ill, but follows his own disordered passions,
where reason has left to be their guide.

Wit is free.
SOme men in striving to show their wits in discourse, make themselves fools;
for wit must notbe strugled withal, and brought as it were by the head and
shoulders: for as it is natural, so it must have it s natural place and time,
and a woman by striving to make her wit known, by much discourse, loses her
reputation, for wit is copious, and busies its self in all things, and humors
and accidents, wherein sometimes it is satirical, and sometimes amorous, and
sometimes wanton, which in all these women should shun, so that in women the
greatest wisdom, if not wit, is to be sparing of their discourse.

Of speech.
AS eight notes produce innumerable tunes, so twenty four letters produce
innumerable words, which are marks for things, which marks produce innumerable
imaginations, or conceptions, which imaginations or conceptions begets another
soul which another animal has not, for want of those marks, and so wants those
imaginations and conceptions which those marks beget; besides those marks beget
a soul in community; besides words are as gods that give knowledge, and
discover, the minds of men, and though some creatures can speak, yet it is not
natural, for it is like puppits, they are made to walk with scrues, that when
the scrues are undone, the puppits can go no farther; so parrots, or the like
can only repeat the words they are taught, but cannot discourse, because they
know not what it signisieth, but man can speak when he comes to maturity, that
is to be man, without teaching, that is, although he does not learn a language
that his forefathers have made, yet he can make one of his own, that is to give
marks to things to distinguish them to himself.

Of Music.
THe art of Music is harder then the art of poetry; for music has but eight
notes, to compose several tunes; when Poetry has four and twenty letters to
play on: but both are musical, and work upon the spirits of men: for there are
some kinds of music that do draw and suck out the spirits of men with
delight, thus it is not the wit, or sense, of things, which moves passion, or
delight, but the numbers; for as notes are set, and numbers are measured, shall
move the passions, as the Musician or Poet pleases.

Of Musical instruments.
ALL Musical instruments are apt to untune, even the natural one the voice; for
when it is hoarse by cold, or otherwise out of tune, but the strings which are
the veyns in the lungs, and stomach, are not so apt to break as lute strings,
which are small little guts dried, neither can there be new strings put to the
voice, once broke, as to a sidle; nor can it be mended as other instrnments
may, nor carefully laid up in a case to keep it long, for there is no
prevention against the breaking of the voice, for old age will come and destroy
that sound, and though it does not break the strings of the voice, yet time
dryes and shrivels them so short, that they cannot be stretched out to any note
or strain: and as time wears out the sound; so death breaks the instruments
and all.

Of Voices.
IT stands with reason that the hottest and coldest Clymats, being the
driest,should produce the best and clearest voices, for moisture breeds phlegm,
and phlegm obstructs the chest; besides the moisture falling into the
winde-pipe hinders the passage of the voice, and clogs the lungs, for wind and
water makes a storm; which destroys a harmony, and instead of singing makes a
roaring, like the seas; or drownes the freight, which are notes, because art
which is the steers-man, has not room to turn and wind to fill his sails; but
are beaten down with the rain roghnes, and stopped with the mud of phlegm, so of
necessity he must be lost; fat does also hinder the voice, for you shall
seldom hear any that is fat sing well because the fat has straightned their
passages, so to the making of a good voice, there must be a wide throat, and
clear wind pipes, and strong lungs.

Music is number with sound, as Optics are lines with light.
As man's shape is naturally fit and proper for all kind of motion and
Actions;so his voice is made for all sorts of sounds; wherefore the first
invention need not go so far as A smiths forge, for he has the hammer and
forge all ways with him; the forge is his chest, the bellows is his lungs; the
fire the heart, the tongue the hammer, and his lips the tongues, the head is the
Smith; the several wedges of iron are the several notes that are struck; thus
beats out a harmony.

Of Dancing.
KIssing dances are commonly dances, which were invented by the meaner and
ruder sort of people, at wakes, and faires; which kind of people, knows not
the ceremonies of modest civilities; for Country dancing is a kind of a rude
pastime, and cannot be called truly a dance, but rather a running in figaris,
for the true art of dancing, is measured sigures, by the feet in divided times;
for the feet keep as just a distance of times, as notes of music.

Of dancing.
DAncing is compounded of measures, figure, and motion. Measure is Geometry;
figure is Symmetry, and motion, is division.

Geometry is equal measure, Symmetry is proportionable measures, Division is
numbers.

Of invention.
HE is more praiseworthy that invents something new, be it but rude and
unpolished, then he that is learned, although he should do it more curious, and
neater; an imitator can never be so perfect, as the inventor, if there can be
nothing added to the thing invented; for an inventor is a kind of a creator;
but most commonly the first invention is imperfect; so that time, and
experience add to the growth, and perfection, and many times there are many
creatours to one invention; for he that adds is as much as he that begun, only
the second lights his candle from the first, but he goes his own way, and may
be away that the first inventor had not guessed at: or at least thought it
impossible: but an imtator adds nothing to the substance or invention, only
strives to resemble it, yet surely invention is easier then imitation: because
invention comes from nature, and imitation from paintul, and troublesome
inquiry; and if he goes not just the path that has been trod before him; he
is out of the way, which is adouble pain at first to know the path, and then to
tread it out; but invention takes his own ways, besides, invention is easy
because it is born in the brain. Where imitation is wrought and put into the
brain by force.

EPISTLE.
SOme say as I hear, that my book of Poemes, and my book of Philosophical
Fancies, was not my own; and that I had gathered my opinions from several
Philosophers. To answer the first, I do protest, upon the grounds of Honor,
honesty and Religion, they are my own, that is, my head was the forge, my
thoughts the anvil to beat them out, and my industry shaped them and sent them
forth to the use of the world; if any use may be made thereof, but my Lord was
the Master and I the Prentice, for gathering them from Philosophers, I never
converst in discourse with any an hour, at one time in my life; And I may swear
on my conscience, I never had a familiar acquaintance, or constant conversation
with any prosest Scholar, in my life, or a familiar acquaintance with any man,
so as to learn by them, but those that I have near relation to, as my Husband,
and Brothers; it is true, I have had the honor sometime to receive visits of
civility from my Noble and Honorable acquaintance, wherein we talk of the
general news of the times, and the like discourse, for my company is too dull
to entertain, and too barren of wit to afford variety of discourse, wherefore I
bend my self to study nature; and though nature is too specious to be known,
yet she is so free as to teach, for every straw, or grain of dust, is a natural
tutor, to instruct my sense and reason, and every particular rational creature
is a sufficient School to study in; and our own passions and affections,
appetites and desires, are moral Doctors to learn us; and the evil that follows
excess, teaches us what is bad, and by moderation we find, and do so learn
what is good, and how we ought to live, and moderate them by reason, and
discourse them in the mind, and there is few that have not so much natural
capacity, and understanding, but may know, if not find out what is needful for
life, without artificial education, for nature is the chief master; art and
education but the under ushers, in the School of life; for natural objections
may be applied without the help of arts, and natural rules of life, may lead us
safe, and easy ways to our journeys end; and questionless nature was the
first guide, before art came to the knowledge, and if it were not for nature,
art many times would lose her followers; yet let nature do what she can, art
often times will go out of the right way; but many will say it is the nature of
man that invents, and the nature of man to err that is, it is the nature of man
to be so ambitious, as to strive to be wiser then nature her self, but if
nature has given men ambition, yet nature has given men humility to allay
that fiery appetite; and though nature has given men ignorance, yet nature
has given men undestanding, to bring them out of that darkness into the light
of knowledge; and though nature has obscured the secrets of the natural cause,
yet he has given men nature to observe her effects, and imaginations, to
conjecture of her ways, and reason to discourse of her works, and
understanding to sinde some out, and these gifts are general to mankind:
wherefore I find no reason, but my readers may allow me to have natural
imagination understanding and inquiries, as well as other Philosophers, and to
divulge them as they have done, if that they believe that I am produced by
nature, and not by artifices hand, cut out like a stone-statue; but if my
readers will not allow my opinions, and fancies to be my own, yet truth will;
but there is a natural education to all, which comes without pains taking, not
tormenting the body with hard labor, not the mind with perturb'd study, but
comes easy and free through the senses; and grows familiar and sociable with
the understanding, pleasant and delightful to the contemplation, for there is
no subject that the sense can bring into the mind, but is a natural in
structour to produce the breeding of rational opinions, and understanding
truths; besides, imaginary fancies, if they will give their mind time as to
think, but most spend their time in talk rather then in thought; but there is a
wise saying, think first, and speak after; and an old saying that many speak
first, and think after; and doubtless many, if not most do so, for we do not
always think of our words we speak, for most commonly words flow out of the
mouth, rather customarily then premeditately, just like actions of our walking,
for we go by custom, force and strength, without a constant notice or
observation; for though we design our ways, yet we do not ordinarily think of
our pace, nor take notice of every several step; just so, most commonly we
talk, for we seldom think of our words we speak, nor many times the sense they
tend to; unless it be some affected person that would speak in fine phrases;
and though speech is very necessary to the course of man's life, yet it is very
obstructive to the rational part of man's mind; for it imployes the mind with
such busy, and unprofitable matters, as all method is run out of breath, and
gives not contemplation leave to search, and enquire after truth, nor
understanding leave to examine what is truth, nor judgment how to distinguish
truth from falsehood; nor imagination leave to be ingenious, nor ingenuity leave
to find invention, nor wit leave to spin out the fine and curious thread of
fancy, but only to play with words on the tongue, as balls with rackets.
Besides a multiplicity of words consounds the solid sense, and rational
understanding, the subject in the discourse; yet to think very much and speak
yery seldom, makes speeed uneasy, and the tongue apt to faulter, when it is to
deliver sense of the matter they have, and want of uncustomary speaking makes
the Orator to seek for words to declare the sense of his meaning, or the
meaning of his sense; besides, want of eloquence many times, loses not only
rational opinions, but conceals truth it self, for want of persuading
rhetoric, to raise up belief, or to get understanding; so that a contemplatory
person has the disadvantage of words; although most commonly they have the
advantage of thoughts, which brings knowledge; but life being short, those that
speak much, have not time to think much, that is, not time to study and
contemplate; wherefore it is a great loss of time to speak idle word, that is,
words that are to no purpose, and to think idle thoughts, that bring no honest
profit to the life of man, nor delight for life's pastime. nor news to the
knowledge and understanding, but most men speak of common matters, and think of
vulgar things, beats upon what is known, and understood, not upon what ought to
be known, and understood; but upon known improbabilities, or vain ambitions, or
upon that which nothing concerns them, or upon evil designs to work
distractions, or upon that which cannot advantage them nor any body else; but
it is very probable, my readers will at this discourse condemn me, saying, I
take upon me to instruct, as if I thought my self a master, when I am but a
novice, and sitter to learn. I answer, it is easier to instruct what ought to
be done, then to practice what is best to be done; but I am so far from
thinking my self able, to teach, as I am afraid I have not capacity to learn,
yet I must tell the world, that I think that not any has a more abler master
to learn from, then I have, for if I had never married the person I have, I do
believe I should I never have writ so, as to have adventured to divulge my
works, for I have learned more of the world from my Lords discourse, since I
have been his wife, then I am confident I should have done all my life, should
I have lived to an old age; and though I am not so apt a Scholar as to improve
much in wit, yet I am so industrious a Scholar to remember whatsoever he has
said, and discoursed to me, and though my memory is dull, and slow, and my
capacity weak to all other discourses, yet when I am in company, I had rather
show my simplicity then be thought rude; wherefore I choose rather to speak,
though foolishly, then say nothing, as if I were dumb, when I am to entertain
my acquaintance, and though I do not speak so well as I wish I could, yet it is
civility to speak. But it is my Lords discourse that gets me understanding, and
makes such impressions in my memory, as nothing but death can rub it out: and
my greatest fear is, that I the Scholar should disgrace him the Master, by the
vulgar phrases and the illiterate expressions in my works: but the truth is, I
am neither eloquent by nature, nor art; neitherhave I took the accustomary way
of often speaking, to make my words, or letters fluent, not but my tongue runs
fast and foolish when I do speak, but I do not often speak, for my life is more
contemplary, then discoursing, and more solitary then sociable, for my nature
being dull and heavy, and my disposition not merry, makes me think my self not
fit for company.

The second part of the first BOOK.
Of a Solitary life.
CErtainly a solitary life is the happiest, I do not mean so solitary as to
live an Anchoret, or to be bound to inconveniences either of care or fear, or
to be tied to observance, either to Parents or wedlock, or Superiors, or to be
troubled to the bringing up of their children, and the care of bestowing them
when brought up, but their persons must be as free from all bonds, as their
minds must be from all wandering desires; for as it is a great pleasure, so it
is a great chance to find it; for the mind must be contracted into so round a
compass, and so firm a solitude, that the thoughts must travel no further then
home; for if the body be in one place and the mind in another, there must
needs be a discord, wherein can consist no happiness to the whole person; to
obtain this pleasure, they must first have a competencie of fortune, as not to
be bit with necessity, not so much as to be troubled with excess, then they
must be their own chief, not to depend on more then the laws of the land
compels them to: and as they must be under no command, but what necessity,
force, or the public, so they must not command more then what is necessary;
for there is more trouble in commanding then in obeying. For ordering much,
troubles much, then their delights must be various, not numerous, they must not
come in throngs, but by degrees, for fear of surfets. and give every sense his
free time and pleasure, but so proportioned to live with an appetite, and so
not to feed all the senses at once, for that takes off the delight from every
particular, and not heightens them; for in compounds there is no perfect taste,
for compounded pleasures of senses, rather amazeth the spirits then delights
them; to see a beautiful object, and to hear a melodious found, to have an
odoriferous scent, a delicious taste, a soft touch all at once, distracts; for
the spirits running from one object to another, knows not what to choose, or
where to rest; therefore true delight comes soberly and singly one by one,
besides the delights that our senses receive in outward objects, there is a
delight of inward contemplation, whose materials the senses bring, in which the
imagination does work upon, by carving and cutting, and inlaying those several
pieces, and so is represented to the mind as a new recreation, which are
called fancies, or ideas, for though it be nothing until it be put into act,
and every thought cannot be acted; some for the hazards and inconveniences
others for the impossibilities, which are fantasmes that live not long after
the birth, or so sickly, that there is little delight in them, neither do they
harm but rather good; for it pleases for a time, coming in sweetly, and goes
out quickly; but thoughts that may be put in acts, should be carefully and
wisely governed, for those beget great desires, those desires run violently
into acts, not staying for consideration; which makes men commit, not only idle
and vain follies, but dangerous even to the ruin of estates, or reputation, or
lives, which must needs bring discontent, for there can be no happiness in
ruin; and since a greater pleasure and happiness consists in thoughts, they
must rule them so, not to murmur in discontents of what they would and cannot,
or not safely do; but their wishes and desires must rather be within the circle
of their abilities then without, and rather think they have too much then too
little, for they that think they have too little, will never be quiet in
striving to get more, so the pleasure of wise thinking is, when the thoughts
are begot honestly, nourished moderately, and ordered carefully, these bring
true content.

A Monastical life.
SOme dispraise a Monastical life, and say they are the drones in a
Commonwealth, to suck out that honey they never took pains to gather, and that
they are an idle, lazy and unprofitable people, for say they, they go not to
wars to adventure their lives, or hazard their lives, but live free, and
secure, not troubled with the noise of battles, only listen to hear the
success, wherein they may give their opinions, and censures, then that they
never cultivate, or manure the lands for increase, but eat of the plenty,
pretending beggary, bur ingrosse all the wealth; and for the women, there are
as many kept barren as would populate whole nations.

But they in their own defense, say, that they cast off all pleasures of the
world, lie cold, and hard, eat sparingly, watch and pray, and not only to pray
for themselves, or for the dead; but for those that are encumbered in worldly
cares; besides say they, it is profitable to the Commonwealth, for men that
have small estates, and many children, not being able to maintain them
according to their qualities, and degrees, may run into many errors; for want
of means, which may disturb not only families, but whole states, where a
monastical life, a small portion, and a little will serve the turn, only to
keep soul and body together, in which their lives are peaceable, and full of
devotion; but the Laytie answers, that the third part of the wealth of
Christendom goes to the maintenance of the Church, only in consideration of
younger children, that will be content, and some are sorced in; yet after that
rate there will be, little for the eldest, which remain without, nor will be,
if they go on to lay such burdens upon men's consciences, and such sums upon
those burdens to buy them out; neither is there any sort of men more busy in
disturbing the Commonwealth; for those that have not active employment, either
in the ordinary affairs of the world, or extraordinary affairs in the Common
wealth, their thoughts corrupt being not exercised in action, they grow
factious, which causes distractions; for there is more war amongst the
Christians about their opinion then upon any cause else. This says the one
side, but their enemies say that they are not only the covetous, but the
greatest cheaters in the world, and all under the name for Gods sake; for say
they, they bring in ceremony for gains, in that they set all the mercies of God
to sale, for what sins cannot be bought for money; as adulterery incest,
murder, blasphemy, and sins past, and present; as for whores they permit them
to live loosly without punishment, and allot therein streets and houses, to
increase their sins, in which they do authorize sin for a sum, for they pay
tribute to the Church, and not only sins past and present, but to come: as
witness the years of Jubilee; besides the head take upon them, the power of
damnation and salvation, as witness the excommunications, and absolutions, and
if not out, and in of hell; yet out and in ofPurgatory, which Purgatory is a
great revenue to them; yet they have a countenance for their covetousness,
which is that the offendant must have a true contrition, or their sum of money
will do them no good, no more then will a true contrition without the sum; but
surely Monastical lives, are very profitable to the Commonwealth, whatsoever
it be for the soul, for it keeps peace and makes plenty, and begets, a habit
of sobriety which gives a good example, and many times draws their own minds,
though naturally otherwise disposed, to follow the outward carriage for the
custom of the one, may alter the nature of the other, and in that they keep
peace, is, because they live single lives, not for the quarrels of marriage,
but in not oppressing the kingdom in over-populating it; for those kingdoms
that are very full of people, grows mutinous, and runs into civil wars, where
many states are sorced to war upon their neighbors; for no other end but to
discharge the stomach of the Commonwealth; for fear it should breed incurable
diseases. Besides, a Commonwealth may be over-stockt, like grounds which
causes great dearth and plagues, in a Commonwealth, so that those states
which have more traffic then men, are rich, where those that have more men,
then trade, are poor; and Civil war proceeds not so much out of plenty, as out
of proud poverty, the next cause for plenty they are of a spare diet, and most
of what they eat or should eat, by their order, is Fish, Roots, and the like;
but if they do get a good bit one may say, much good may it do them, for they
get it by stealth, and eat it in fear, at least not openly to avoid scandal;
but if they do not spare in the matter of meat, yet they spare in the manner,
which cuts off all prodigal superfluities of feasting, or open housekeeping,
wherein is spoiled more then eaten, neither does it relieve the hungry, by the
Almes-basket; so much as it over-Gorges the full, and for Ceremonies it keeps
the Church in order, and gives it magnificency: besides it is beneficial to the
State, for it Amuses the Common people and busies their minds, and it is as it
were a recreation: and pastime to them, as Saints days and the like; nay they
take pleasure, and make a recreation to have fasting days, so as they have
much to think on, and employ their time in, as fasting-dayes, processions of
saints, confessions, penance, absolutions, and the like, as Mass and Music,
and shows, as at Christmas, Easter, our Lady day, and on many days of the
years, and these affording one and the same, but varieties in all; besides,
every Saint having power to grant several requests; it will take up some time
to know, what to ask of them, and all these one would think, were sufficient,
to keep out murmur and discontent, which is got by idleness, which is the
cause of rebellion. Thus the Church busies the people, and keeps their minds
in peace, so that these monastical meant, which are the Church, is the nurse to
quiet the people, or the masters to set them on, wherein they never do, unless
it be in the defense of Christian Religion, in which all good men ought to
follow; and surely it is beneficial to the Commonwealth, whatsoever it be for
the soul, and for their souls, although rationally one would think that God
should not take delight in shaven heads; or bare and dirty feet, or cold backs,
or hungry stomachs, in any outward habit, but in an humble heart and low
desires, a thankful mind, for what they have sorrowful sighs, and repenting
tears, fear of offending admiration of his wisdom, and pure love of his
goodness, and mercy, thanks for his favors, and grace, obedience, charity,
and honest worldly industry, and to take as much pleasure, as honest and
virtuous moderation will permit; for we might think that God did not intend man
more misery, or lest of this world then beasts; but alas, all mankind is apt
to run into extremes which beasts are not, either to bar themselves quite of
the lawful use of the world, or to run riot, which of the two, the last is to
be shunned, and avoided, wherein this kind of life is most secure, neither
must we follow our reason in Religion, but Faith, which is the guide of our
conscience.

Of Society.
THere are many sorts of society, and some comfortable; as in the natural
society, of Wife, Children, Parents, Brothers, Sisters, and those that are near
allied to us; some profitable, as in the society of the knowing and wise;
others honorable, as in the society of Princes and soldiers; some pleasant,
as in the society of the wity and ingenious, some are heavenly, as in the
society of the Church of God as the Saints upon earth which are the pious; some
merry, as in the society of the sportful; some sad as in the society of the
asslicted; others Dangerous, as in the society of the false, the lewd, and the
rude, some troublesome, as in the society of fools; some dishonorable, as in
the society of the infamous; so that many times the society of man is worse
then the society of beasts, for they are seldom troublesome, nor false to their
own kind, and some so pleasing, easy and happy, as if it were a society of
Angels; but as society is the making of Commonwealths, which is a community
amongst men, which community causes contracts, and covenants, which makes one
man live by another in peace, so society which is a community causes, strength
to the whole body, to maintain the particular parts; but as society in the
whole causes peace, plenty and security; so society in parts which is siding,
and factions, causes poverty discord, war, and ruin; but I treat not of the
society of the whole body, which is a Commonwealth, but of the society of
particulars, as of neighbors, acquaintance, and familiars, which unless they
be well chosen, bring more incoveniencies then benefit, the benefit of
acquaintance is the guessing at one another humors, by their words and
actions, and their several opinions and fancies which begets wit, in applying
other fancies to their own: and nowledge in seeing their variety of humors,
garbs, and gestures, it makes one distinguish better virtue from vice, and it
is a glass to see best what becomes men, it begets love and friendship, it
refreshes the spirits, it wastes and lessens grief, it makes labor easy, it
applauds the good; it admonishes the bad; it gives confidence to the bashful,
it gives shame to the bold, it sires the courages of the fearful, vigor to the
slothful, it deverts the mind from black and sullen thoughts, it gives good
manners to the rude, knowledge to the ignorant, experience to the young, and
indeed civiliseth mankind. But the common and unchosen societies, it brings
many times great inconveniences, as quarrels; for a quiet man, in his own
nature coming into some company, must either put up an affront, wihich is a
dishonor, or he must fight, wherein he advantures his life, the loss of it
estate, or the trouble and grief in killing a man; which although the cause may
be small, yet he is necessitated to him; so the like in drinking, gaming,
whoring, either by example corrupted, or by persuasion, or else a man is
thought rude, and unsociable, and apt to be railed against for it, so he must
shun it, or do as they do; besides in many societies, there is little to be
learned, and worse to be heard; as railing, cursing, swearing, tedious
disputing, nonsensly talking, detracting from virtue, divulgeing of faults,
crying up vices, defaming of honor, making of discord; and there is nothing
learned but prodigality, sloth, and falsehood: so as the disorder would make a
well tempered and equal moving brain dizzie, but the society of men and women is
much more inconvenient, then men with men, and women with women; for women with
women can do little inconvenience, but spights, and effeminate quarrels, for
place, and gadding abroad, and neglecting their huswiferie at home: the worst
is in learning vanity to spend their husbands estates, and giving one another
ill counsel, to make disquiet at home; but of the society of men and women
comes many great inconveniences, as defamations of women's honors, and begets
great jealousies, from fathers, brothers, and husbands, those jealousies beget
quarrels, murders, and at the best discontent, and unhappiness, it confirms
the apt inclined to bad: and tempts the virtues. and defames the chaste. But
women ought to put on as many several shapes, and forms ofbehaviour, as she
meets with humors; as austere and severe behavior, to the bold, a sweet and
gentle behavior to the humble, and bashful; but a woman that would preserve
her reputation, by fame as well as by chastity, she must put on as many several
faces, and behaviors as a State does; for a state in time of war puts on a
face of anger; and in time of plague and pestilence, a face of piety, after
rebellion a face of clemency; in times of peace and plenty, a face of mirth and
jollity; so women must put on as many behaviors, as she meets with several
humors, as neglect to the proud, and severe to the bold, and wanton, a sweet
and gentle behavior to the humble, and bashful, and observing and serious
behavior, to the wise and grave learned; a dutiful and respective behavior,
to the grave and aged, a cheerful and pleasant behavior to their nearest
friends, and there are so many more, that it is past the memory of my
Arithmetic.

Of Hospitality
I Have observed those that keep great Hospitality, are not only well beloved
of their neighbors, that are often made welcome, and by those that make it a
meeting place; but the Master or Mistress of the house shall be amorously
affected, and earnestly solicited, by the turning of the eyes and the like,
although they be very old, in the times of Hospitality; for old men shall
have, or may have more Mistresses, and old women, more lovers, and seeming
admirers, then the youngest and beautifullest without those intertainments, so
much kindness, and good nature, good cheer begets, yet it will last no longer
then the meat sticks in their teeth; for while the meat, mirth and wine is
working, and the fume ascending, they are so full of thanksgiving, as they
overflow with high praises, professions, and declarations, protestations and
free offers, in which they promise more then they can perform, and perform
less then they could promise; for where the head and the stomach is empty of
the receiver, and the purse of the entertainer, if he have occasion to make use
of any of them, they would do as the parable of the marriage in the scripture,
one said, that he had married a wife, and the other had sold a yoke of oxen,
and the third had bought a farm so that all would have excuses, and excuses in
that kind are the messengers of a denial, neither do they think a denial
sufficient; for if they will not praise their friends, they will turn their
enemies, for so ill natured is mankind that what they cannot make more use of,
they will strive to destroy.

Wherein Hospitality is good.
HOspitality is commendable, for it does refresh the weary traveller, it
relieves the poor: it makes a society of mirth and freedom, when it is so
moderately bounded and orderly governed as it may be constantly kept, otherwise
its but a short hospitality, and a long feast.

Of Feasting.
THere is no action more extravagant, then the making of great feasts, for
there is neither honor, profit, nor pleasure, but noises, trouble, and
expense; and not only an expense to the private purse but to the public in
the unnecessary destruction of so many Creatures; neither does it relieve the
hungry so much, as it over-gorges the full; for indeed a great feast rather
eats up the eaters, then the eaters eat up the feast, by the surfets it gives
them; but those that make great feasts, and strive to please the luxurious
palats of men, are bawds to gluttony, and the feast is the whore to tempt the
appetite, and wine is the fool to make all merry, which never wants at those
entertainments, but plays so much, and ruins so fast, and grows so strong,
as it puts young sobriety and grave temperance out of countenance; it unties
the strings of strength, and throws reason out of the wisest head, so that
reason neither begins it, nor ends it; for it begins with excess of
supersluity, and ends in extravagant disorders.

Of drinking and eating.
WIne, though it begins like a friend. goes on like a fool, most commonly ends
like a Devil in fury: yet it is a greater fault, to eat too much, then too
drink to much wine, in that a man may live without wine, but not without meat;
for wine is rather a superfluity or curiosity, then a necessity, wherefore food
which signifies all kind of meat, is the life and staff, to support life;
which staff being broken by excess, famine, and plagues pursue, which are able
to destroy a kingdom, where wine may only destroy some part, but not endanger
the whole; unless it be every man's particular kingdom, which is themselves,
and there indeed it drowns both king and state.

Of Moderation.
THe way to a man's happiest condition of life in this world, and for the way to
the next, is, by the straight way of moderation; for the extremes are to be
shunnd, and all that can be shunned, even in devotion; for the holy writ says,
Turn not to the right hand nor to the left, lest you go the wrong way; for
extremes in devotion run to superstition and idolatry: and the neglect in both
Atheism, but to keep the even way, is to obey God as he has commanded, and
not as we fancy, by our wrong interpretation; so for the mind of man great and
hard studies and perturbations, draw or wear out the spirits, or oppress them,
in so much that great students are not commonly long livd, but sickly, lean,
and pale, and those that have extraordinary and quick fancies of their own, do
many times by the quick motion of their brain, inflame the spirits to that
degree, as they run mad, or so near as to be strangely extravagant; and on the
other side, those that study not, nor have fancies of their own, are dul-blocks
that have no raptures of the mind, but only sensual pleasures, and so when
they can, they run into with that violence, as it turns to their pain, not
their delight; and all is but emptying and filling, as beasts do, and not
having the knowledge as men should have, for moderation, as for immoderation of
diets; how often do men suddenly die, by the excess thereof? and how many
diseases does it bring to them that escapes surfets? as fevers gowts, stone,
dropsy, and the like; nay what diseases does it not bring, by the dross it
breeds; for superfluity of moisture oppresses, and slackens the nerves, and
dulls and quenches thespirits, which makes them unfit for action or business
in the affairs of the world, it stuffs them with sloth or corpulency, or fat,
it banisheth industry, and many times courage: on the other-side, too spare and
low diet, chaps and dryes the body, like the earth that wants rain, or
manuring, shrinks and gathers up the rain; it heats the body into Hectic
fevers, and sucks out the oil of life, for exercise the violence of it melts
the grease, inflames the blood, pumps out too much moisture by sweats, it
over-stretches the nerves, which weakens the body, which brings shaking palsies
in the head, legs, and many times over the whole body; on the other side, too
little exercise corrupts the blood, and breeds obstructions, which breeds
Agues, and spleen, faintings and the like. For the passions; as for example, a
man that is extraordinary angry makes him run into fury for the present, as
many times to commit so rash an action, as to make him unhappy all his life
after, by killing a friend, or at least losing a friend: or getting an enemy by
an unseasonable word, and those that have no anger must of necessity receive
great affronts, at some time or other, for patience is to be content when there
is no remedy; but in many things or actions anger is required when fury would
be too much, or patience or silence too little, and so the like in all other
passions, and as for great wealth it is both a trouble, in the keeping, or
bestowing of it; in the keeping of it, the care is into whose hands to trust
it, or to what places to lay it in; so that the watching and counting it, and
how, and to whom to leave it too, takes off the pleasure in it, and for
spending it the very noise and tumult that great riches bring in the exspence,
is a suficient trouble, for a man can never be at home to himself, he knows not
who is his friend, or who is his enemy, he hears no truth for flattery; he has
no true taste of any senses: for the throngs of the variety, take away the
pleasure of every particular; as for poverty, it is the drudge to the world,
the scorn of the world, a trouble to their friends, and a death to themselves:
as for power; what for the care in the keeping it, for fear of a usurper, and
though there is no enemy to oppose it, yet what trouble there is in the
ordering and disposing with their authority, and those that have no power are
slaves, wherein moderation keeps peace, in being content with our own share,
and not desiring to share with our neghbour in what is his and moderation gives
wealth; for he is richest that has so much, only to enjoy himself; moderation
civilizeth nations, it upholds government, and keeps commerce, yet makes
private families subject, it nourishes the body, recreates the mind; and
makes joy in life, and is the petty god to the present pleasures of man.

Of Prodigality and Generositie.
THere is none complains so much of ingratitude, as progals, for when their
purses are empty they grudge their hospitality, and repine at their gifts,
when they gave more out of pride, and magnificence, then out of love or
friendship; but man is so incircled with self love, as he thinks all those that
have partaken of his prodigality, are bound to maintain his riot, or at least
to supply his necessity, out of their treasury, but of the difference of
prodigality and generositie, is, that generositie distributes in a reasonable
time and to worthy persons, or else out of humanity when prodigality considers
neither time nor person, nor humanity, but humor, will, and vainglory.

Of Gifts.
There are four sorts of gifts; as to those of merit, is generosity, to those
in necessity, is charity, or compassion; to those of eminency and power, it is
flattery and fear, to knaves or fools, it is prodigality, and vainglory.

The difference between convetousnesse and ambition, is, one is placed upon
things worthy; the other upon Mercenary profit.

Of Vanity.
IT is said, that there is nothing but vanity upon the earth, and what is it
that men call vanity? it is that which is to no purpose; and if so, God made
the world in vain, which God never does make any thing, but to some purpose,
but say some, that alters not Gods purpose; for all things that are vain, are
as to themselves, and that nothing was created as for it self, but all things
for God, as to have his will obeyed; but nature has made man for to desire to
please himself, although laws have forbad him to please himself in all things,
or ways, but has given him particular rules, and has paled him within such
bounds, as indeed if a man freeborn should be put into prison, and then bid to
take his liberty; but if nature made nothing in vain, then men's vanities is to
some purpose in one regard or another; now that which is called vanity, may be
divided into two parts, as particulars and generals, the general vanity is to
eat, to drink, to sleep, to act any thing, or to think, but the particular
vanities are those that men condemn in one another most: as for a man to think
of those things he knows to be impssible, or to do that he knows the end
will bring him no profit, but if the ends of vanity be not profitable, yet the
ways are pleasant, or else men would not take such delight in them; and what
is the worldly design of men but pleasing themselves, and shall we think that
nature made the world to be a torment to us? and only beasts to take pleasure
in themselves, and that nothing but hard labor, and restraints are lawful to
man, for beasts eat and drink, and take their ease, and for all we know, please
themselves in their thoughts, and may be they have as various and vain thoughts
as man's, unless men torment them, and put them to labor, and though labor
and industery may be pleasant to some, yet not when it is put upon them, as a
law of necessity, for laws, and necessities are bonds, though we make them our
selves, and men may think all things are lawful, that are, or tend not to the
destruction of nature, for nature is bountiful and easy, and ties not up her
creatures, but gives them liberty, and use of themselves, unless it be to
destroy themselves unprositably, which is against nature; but for preservation,
and to prolong the life of something else, as Fame, Friends, Country; which he
rather lives in, then dies to, and nature is the giver of life to all, and
therefore those that maintain life in most things, is the greatest friend to
nature, as in losing one life to save many, and to die for fame, is to live
longer in the memory of other men, then he knows he shall in the life of his
own body; but one would think there were no vanity in man, for there was
nothing done or thought, but was to some purpose, which is to please
themselves; though all thoughts, and all actions are not pleasing, but those I
suppose are enforced; and upon necessity; and not voluntary, then it is no
greater vanity then what cannot be avoided, for some take more pleasure in
getting or striving to get the opinion of others, then they can grieve at the
pains they take, and some take as much pleasure in building an house of
cards, as another does of stone, and some take as much, if not more pleasure
in a phantasme; as another in the gravest and assured'st thoughts; for what
pleasure Poets take in their imaginations of impossibilities, as if men should
employ their time and thoughts in nothing, but what is merely necessary, they
would grow a troublesome burden to themselves; being made by nature
inquisitive, busy and contemplative; For there are few things serve merely to
the use of necessity, unless we will fill our time with superfluities, and
curiosities which are called vanity; and this vanity is that which sets all
Commonwealths awork, and makes them to live by one another, that which is
called vanity is of a middle nature, as by that which is called vice, and that
which is called virtue, for there is no malignity in vanity; for where
malignity is, it leaves to be vanity, and turns to be vice; vanity is the
worldly delight of man, if man had any delight in the world; But the wise
Preacher says, All is vanity under the Sun, and vexation of spirit, and to
eat and drink in peace is the only happiness; if so we are only happy when
we are eating and sleeping; they say in all desires obtained man is more
unsatisfied: and that the only pleasure is in desiring, and in endeavoring,
and not in the enjoying, and that man is contented and pleased with nothing
that he has in possession, but it is not that man that is displeased with all
that he has, but that pleasure is not permanent: and though pleasure is
according to every man's delectation; yet there is no man but has pleasure
sometimes one way, sometimes another; but as the sense seems to be ravished at
the first touch, yet by the often repetition it grows troublesome, and
painful, and so cease; for it is with the senses as it is with the strength,
for great Labor wearies and weakens the strength; nor can the strength be in
every member at once, no more then the senses can receive their full gust at
once: for the legs will grow feeble with labor, and actions of the arms,
though the bulk of the strength lies not in the arms; for a man cannot run
fast, and give a violent motion to his arms, but the one will hinder the other
so much, as both will be of little use, the same will be with the senses; for a
generality takes part away from every particular, and one and the same motion
to every particular wearies and troubles ti, in so much, as that which was a
pleasure becomes a grief or pain, so as it is not that man that takes not
pleasure in what he enjoys; for if any one delights in particular taste, if
the appetite were not wearied, the delight would be the same, as it was at the
first touch, to eternity, but the senses being tirrable, grow wearied, feeble,
and sick with violent motion and continual labor, that they cannot relish that
they did before; besides, al desires that proceed from the senses increases
their motion. and as all the senses are chiefly in the head, so their like and
dislike to most things proceeds from thence; for the brain will be so weary
with one and the same motion, as the legs with running; and the violenter the
senses are, the sooner tired they be; but there are two chief sorts of
pleasure, the one wholly dwelling in the senses, which is fading, the other
lasts as long as life, and has a desire to last longer; these are those things
or thoughts, as lie not wholly in the senses, but only found out by them, and
kept and nourished by the mind; in this the senses follow the mind, and where
the mind leads the senses it walks them with so moderate a pace, and rules
them with so equal motions, as they are never weary. But when the senses lead
and rule the mind, it is always out of order, and is tired in following the
uneven, strange, and violent ways, not knowing where to rest; but the reason
why displeasure lasts longer then pleasure, is because displeasure is of the
nature of death; For though motion does not cease as in death, yet it is slow
and dull, and pleasure which is of the nature of life, is full of motion, bot
and violent, the one is like a long and tedious sickness, the other like a hot
and burning fever, that destroys soon.

The nature of Man.
IT is the nature of mankind to run into extremes; for their minds are as
their bodies are; for most commonly there is a predominate passion in the one,
as a predominat humor in the other, so that dispositions of men are governed
more by passion, then by reason, as the body is governed more by appetite, then
by conveniences.

The Power of the Senses.
THe body has power over the will, for the appetite of the five senses draws
the will forcibly, although reason helps to defend it.

The appetite is more delighted by degrees then with a full gust.

But one would think that every several sense did strike but upon one string,
or nerve, for the mind is often moved to one and the same passion, by the
several senses; and again one would think that every several object or subject
did strike upon a several nerve, although to the pleasure or pain, but of one
sense, and the mind receives several pleasures or griefs from those varieties.

The happy Farmer.
THe Farmer and his wife, sons, daughters, and servants, are happier then the
Kings, Nobles, or Gentry, for a king has more cares to govern his kingdom then
he receives pleasure in the enjoyment. The Farmers care is only to pay his
rent, which he must have a very hard bargain, or be a very ill husband if he
cannot do it, he takes more pleasure in his labor, then the Nobility in their
ease, his labor gets a good stomach, digests his meat, provokes sleep,
quickens his spirits, maintains health, prolongs life, and grows rich into the
bargain. The Nobility, or Gentry, their disease of idleness deads their
stomachs, decays their health, shortens their lives; besides, makes them of
inconstant natures, and empty purses, and their queasy bodies make them
desirevariety of wines, meats, and women, and idleness wearieth their spirits,
which makes them wander to several places, company, games, or sports; yet ease
and riots make finer wits; for riots make many vapors, and idleness breeds
thoughts which heates the brain, and heat is active, and so refines the wit,
and fires the spirits, and hot spirits make ambition, and ambition well
disposes minds, produces worthy actions and honorable reports, and not
only fills them with courage, but gives them curiosity, civility, justice and
the like; but ambition to depraved minds, makes them slaves to base actions,
as flattering, cheating, or betraying, or any unworthiness, to compass their
ends.

The vastness of desires.
THere are few, but desires to be absolute in the world, as to be the singular
work of nature, and to have the power over all her other works; although they
may be more happy with less, but nature has given men those vast desires, as
they can keep in no limits, yet they begin low and humble; as for example, a
man that is very poor, and in great wants, desires only to have so much as
will serve mere necessity, and when he has that, then he desires
conveniences, then for decency, after for curiosity, and so for glory, state,
reputation and fame; and though desire runs several ways, yet they aim all at
one end. If any end there were, which is to embrace all, but some say the mind
is the measure of happiness, which is impossible, unless the mind were
reasonable; for the mind is not satisfied though it had all, but requires
more, so the mind is like eternity, always running, but never comes to an end.

Of the Vain, Useless and unprofitable Wishes.
I Perceive if men could have their wish of nature, or fortune, they would wish
that which was admired, and esteemed by others, and not what he received; for
man seems to build his happiness in the opinion of others, as the chiefest
enjoyment of pleasure in himself.

Of desires and fears.
SOme say that it is a miserable state of mind, to have few things to desire,
and many things to fear, but surely the misery lies only in the many fears,
not in the few desires, and if desires are pleasing in the birth, yet it puts
the mind in great pain, when they are strangled, with the string of
impossibilities, or at least made sick and faint with improbabilities, for if
hopes give them life, despair gives them death; and where one desires and
enjoyes a possession, many thousands are beaten back, for desire seldom keeps
rank, but flies beyond compass, yet many times desires are helped by their
grateful servants patience and industry. For industry is a kind of
witchcraft; for wise industry will bring that to pass, as one would think it
were impossible; but without all doubt, that mind that has the ferest wishes
is in the happiest condition, for it is, as if it had a fruition of all things.

What desires a man may have to make him happy.
THe desires for happiness are not in the favor of Princes, nor in being
Princes to have favorites, or to be popular, nor in the conquering, of many
nations, and men, nor in having vast possessions, or to be Emperors of the
whole world, or in the revenge of enemies, or to enjoy their beloved or to have
many Lovers, nor in beauty, art, wit, nor strength, but to have health, so as
to enjoy life and peace to guard it, to be praised and not flattered, admired
but not lusted after, to be envyed, but not hated, to be beloved without ends,
to love without jealousy, to learn without labor, to have wise experience
without loss, to live quietly without fear, to be an enemy to none, to have
pleasure without pain, honor and riches without trouble, and time to wait on
them, which every prudent man makes it to do, but these are not easily to be
had, so that the best way to be happy is, to persuade themselves to be content
with that they have, and to desire no more then honest industry may easily
purchase.

Of the mind and the body.
THe mind and the body must be married together; but so as the mind must be
the husband; to govern, and command, and the body the wife to obey, and reason
which is the judge of the mind, must keep the senses in awe; for as reason is
the property of the mind, so the senses are the property of the body; but
there is no judge more corrupted then reason, or takes more bribes, and the
senses are the bribers; for the eye corcupts it with beauty, the ear with
melodious sounds; and so the sent, taste, and touch, which makes false reason,
gives false judgment; so as the mind may be an over-fond husband, that would
be a wise man, were he not persuaded from it; by the follies of his wife.

Of Riches and Poverty.
Necessity and poverty teaches to dissemble, flatter, and shark for their
advantage, and livelihood: and long custom makes it a habit, and habit is a
second nature; for what Poverty breeds many times proves base, and unworthy,
being necessitated to quit honor or life, where most commonly life is chosen
first; besides, poverty wants means to learn what is best; for the poorer sort
generally never stands upon the honor of speaking the truth, or keeping
their word; for they lie at the watch, to steal what they can get; when a
rich-man vaving no wants to necessitate him, but lives at plenty, which keeps
him not only from that which is base, but persuades to things that are Noble.
Riches make a man ambitious of Honorable Fame, which desires make them rule
their Actions, to the length of good opinions but poverty is ambitious of
nothing but riches, and thinks it no dishonor to come to it any any way. Thus
poverty is ambitious of riches, and riches of honors. Riches, as a Golden
father beget a bastard gentry, and poverty is the death and burial of it; but
the pure and true born gentry comes from merit, from whence proceeds all noble
and Heroic Actions, it is nourished in the Court of Fame, taught in the
schools of honor, lives in the monarchical Government of justice.

Of Robbers or factious men.
THere be three sorts of Robbers, as first, those those that take away our
goods; as plate, money, jewels, corn, cattle, and and the like. The second are
murderers, that take away life. The third are factious persons, which are not
only the cause of the taking away our goods, which we call movable, and our
lives, but our religion, our friends, our laws, our liberties, and peace; For a
factious man makes a commotion, which commotion raises civil wars, and civil
war is a division in the bowels, or heart of the State, as to divide commands
from obedience, obedience from commands, rending and breaking affections,
raising of passions, so as a factious man is a humane Devil, seeking whom he
can devour, insinuating himself into favor with every man, that he may the
better stir up their spirits to fury, presenting them with grievances to catch
in discontent, speaking always in Ciphers and characters, as if it were a
dangerous time, and that they lived under a Tyrannioal government, when they
may speak, as freely as they can live; and live as freely as they think, with
free dom of thoughts which nothing but death can cut off; but if they did live
under a Tyrannical Government, they ought not to reform by their passion, nor
to disobey with their grivances; but it is both wise, and honest to be a
time-server, so they go not through dishonorable actions; for he that runs
against the times, is a disturber of the peace, and so becomes factious, which
is the track of evil nature.

There is a difference betwixt a Rogue, a dishonest man, and a Knave.
THe Rogue is one that will act any villainy; as murder, sacrilege, rapin, or
any horrid act; the dishonest man is one that is ungrateful, that will receive
all courtesies, but will return none, though he be able, and a breaker of his
word; as for example, if a man should promise another man out of a sudden
fondness, and without witness, a hundred pounds a year, and after repenting
of it, should break his promise, yet it is a dishonest part, though they take
nothing from the man that he could challenge for his own; for he gave but a
word of promise, and a word is nothing, unless had witness to make it an act
by law; And again, if a man goes to a Fair, and sees a horse that he likes,
and prays his neighbor to buy him that horse; he goes and likes him, and
buyeth the horse for himself; so though he takes nothing from his neighbor, by
the reason the horse was none of his, yet it is a dishonest part, beacause his
neighbor trusted him in it; and many other ways which would be too tedious to
write, but the Knave is not onelyone that will break his word, or neglect his
trust, but he will betray his trust, and although he will not actually act
murder, yet for gain he will betray a life, and though he will not break open
houses, and commit Robberies or any thing against the law, yet he will cozen
where the law cannot take hold of him: or do any thing that is not absolute
against the laws, and a knave takes more pleasure in his close ways of
deceiving, then in the profit, though that is sweet; for many do not cozen for
the various delights for the senses, but delights himself in the various ways
of deceiving; Nor is he wiser then the honest man, though he think he be, nor
is it that he thinks himself wiser then an honest man, for a wise honest man
may be cozened by a crafty knave; for wisdom goes upon honest grounds, and
takes truth to be her guide, but craft upon dishonest grounds, and takes
falsehood to be her guide; but some will say, that a wise man will not trust a
knave; but how shall a wise man know a knave? not by his face; for a knave is
not known by his face, but by his acts, nor by his report; for report is a
great Cozner.

Of Knaves.
THere are three sorts of knaves, the foolish, the crafty, and the wicked knave
the foolish and wicked knave most commonly comes under the lash of the laws;
but the crafty knave is too hard for the laws; that they can get no hold of
him, and many times he makes them bawds, for his Adulterate ways; yet it is
better for a master to have an industrious knave to his servant, then a
negligent fool; for an industrious knave, although he steal one penny for
himself, he will gain at least another for his master, not only to hide his
theft by it, but because he would be employed, and keep his service, but fools
lose in both.

For a man to be honest to himself.
MAny think that honesty is bound only to the regard of others, and not to
himself, so it deed an honest man is a friend and neghbour to all misfortunes,
miseries, and necessities, in helping them with kind loving, and industrious
actions in distress, if he thinks he can assuage them, and do himself no
wrong; for every man ought to be honest to himself, as well as to another; for
though we are apt to consider our selves so much, as it may be a prejudice to
another, yet we ought not to consider another so much to the prejudice of our
selves; for justice to our selves should take the first place by nature, where
to wrong ones self is the greatest injustice, yet to discharge a trust is the
chiefest part of honesty, though it be to the prejudice of himself, wherefore
an honest man should not take such a trust, as may endanger him to ruin.

Of Honesty.
THere are two sorts or kinds of Honesty, the one a bastard, and the other a
true-born; the bastard is to be honest, for by-respects, as out of fear of
punishment, either to their reputations, estates, or persons, or for love of
rewards that honesty brings; but the true-born honesty, loves honesty, for
honesties sake, and is a circle that has no ends, and justice is the center,
and Honesty is the sweet essence of nature, and the God of Humanity.

We ought not to be ungrateful to the dishonest.
IF one receive life from two men, the one an approved honest man, the other
from a known false, cruel, and deceitful man, which in our Language is called a
Knave; yet the benefit is as great from the knave as from the honest man; for a
benefit is a benefit from whom soever it comes; and if a knave wrongs me not,
he is an honest man to me, though he should be false to all others, and that
man that does me an injury by his good will, is a knave to me, although he were
honest to all men else: wherefore those only can challenge knaves, that have
received the wrong; nor do we truly receive a wrong by what is meant, but by
what is done: for one cannot say he was hurt, that escaped a danger, but he
that was wounded, but as one should receive a benefit with as much
thankfulness from a knave as from him that is honest, yet a man should be more
careful and circumspect, in dealing or trusting those that have the reproach,
or the bold brand of practicing dishonesty, or knavish actions, then with those
that take conscience, or moral Philophy in their way, which are full of
gratitude and fidelity, and truth, as one that is a keeper of his promise, a
loyal subject, and a loving husband, a careful father, a kind master, a
faithful friend, and a merciful enemy.

Of Obligations.
AS there are some that hate and shun those that can, but will not oblige, so
there are others that hate and shun those they would, but cannot oblige. The
first is out of a covetous nature, that thinks that all the good that is done
to others is a loss to themselves, the other that thinks the least good he
does for others, the more power is in himself; so both is out of selflove, both
the shunner and the actor.

Truth and falsehood not easily known.
IT is very hard, and requires much time to find out falsehood; for though
occasions make a man know himself in part, and so to another, yet not so fully
as we may rest upon him, to be one and always the same, neither can we without
great injustice censure always by the hurt we receive; for ill effects may
fall from very good intentions, and therefore how shall we censure by the
intentions, since none knows them but themselves; for although an honest man
desires to live, as if the world saw his thoughts, and strives to think as he
would be judged, for an honest man would not betray the trust of an enemy
either by threats nor torments, nor fear of death, nor love to life, nor
persuasions of friends, nor the allurements of the world, nor the enchantments
of tongues; nor any miseries of his own shall make him step from the grounds of
honesty; but as a God he does adoro it, as a servant he does obey it, and
though it be the chief part of honesty to keep a trust, yet all trust is not
honest, so as it is as great a dishonesty to take an evil, base, or an unworthy
trust, as to betray a just one.

Of flattery.
Flattery takes most when they come into the ear, like soft and sweet music,
which lulls asleep reason, and inchants the spirits; but if they come in like
the sound of a trumpet, it awakes the reason, and affrights the mind, and
makes it stand upon the guard of defense, as when approaching enemies come to
assault, but if flattery be tolerable in any, it is from the Inferiors to the
Superiors, as from the subject to the Prince, and from the servant to the
master, or from the wife to the husband; But for the Prince to flatter his
subject, and the master a servant, is base, but most commonly those that envy
most, flatter best, either to pull down those they envy, or to raise up
themselves above them.

Divinity and Moral Philosophy.
DIvinity and Philosophy ties up nature, or Divinity and Moral Philosophy are
the two guardians of nature; yet some times they prove the two goalers to
nature, when they press, or tie their chains too hard; all things have their
times, and season, unless art puts them out of the way.

Nature makes, but fortune distrusts, as when she misplaceth her works, as not
using them to the right.

Of Atheism, and Superstition.
IT is better, to be an Atheist, then a superstitious man; for in Atheism
there is humanity, and civility, toward man to man; but superstition regards
no humanity, but begets cruelty to all things, even to themselves.

THE EPISTLE.
I Am very much, or very little obliged to my readers, for my former Books
which I have set out, either by their approvement, or dislike, in not granting
me to be the Author; but upon my conscience and truth, those were, as this Book
is, my own, that is, my thoughts composed them; but if I had been enclosed from
the world, in some obscure place, and had been an anchoret from my ininfancy,
having not the liberty to see the World, nor conversation to hear of it, I
should never have writ of so many things; nor had had so many several opinions
for the senses are the gates that lets in knowledge into the understanding, and
fancy into the imagination; but I have had moderate liberty, from my infancy,
being bred upon honest grounds, and fed upon modest principles, from the time
of twelve years old, I have studied upon observations, and lived
upcontemplation, making the World my Book, striving by joining every several
action, like several words to make a discourse to my self; but I found the
World too difficultto be understood by my tender years, and weak capacity, that
till the time I was married, I could only read the letters, and join the
words, but understood nothing of the sense of the World, until my Lord, who was
learned by experience, as my Master, instructed me, reading several lectures
thereof to me, and expounding the hard and obscure passages therein, of which I
have learnt so much, as to settle my mind on the ground of peace, wherein I
have built an house of happiness, entertaining my self with my own thoughts,
which thoughts were like travelers seldom at home, and when they returned
brought nothing but vanity and uneasy fashions, busying themselves on that as
nothing concerned them, or could any ways advantage them, troubling themselves
with trifles, putting my mind in disorder; but since my Lord has learnt me
the way of fortifying it with patience, lest our enemy misfortune should
surprise it, and to set sentinels of truth, lest falsehood should undermine it,
and to make Commanders of Honor, lest flattery should betray it. Thus my mind
is become an absolute Monark, ruling alone, my thoughts as a peaceable
Commonwealth, and my life an expert Soldier, which my Lord settled, composed,
and instructed.

The third part of the first BOOK.
A Tyrannical power never lasts.
THat power never lasts, which falsehood got, and Tyranny strives to keep,
unless tyranny be the natural constitution of the government, and The Turks,
or Tarters is natural.
then it is most commonly the longest livd, like men that were born and bred to
hardship, but should a body be born and bred renderly, be used roughly, and
exposed nakedly, fed coursly, it would be destroyed soon. For a governor in a
Commonwealth, is like a private family; as for example, a man that first
begins to keep a house, and makes laws, and sets rules, though the laws be
hard, and unjust, and the rules strickt and rigorous, yet there is no dispute,
nor grumbling, because he was the first setter up, or beginner of that family,
his means being his own, either by inheritance, or by his merits, or by his
industry, wherefore he has power to order it, or dispose of it as he will, and
his wife and servants never accustomed to any other government before,
willingly submit, and his children born under it, it is as natural to them; but
if this man dies, and the wife marries again, or that he is overruled by some
friend, and they begin to usurp, and to alter the customs, by making new laws,
and to set other rules, although they are more commodious, easy, pleasant, and
plentiful; yet being unusual, the servants begin to murmur, the children to
complain, factions and side-taking grows, until there is a falling out, where
words and blows will pass, and the estate neglected, and so wasted by
cosenage, or sold or wasted by riot, and there is no help for it, unless they
change their dwelling, and take new servants that never were acquainted with
the old, and get more children that knew not the first breeding, and another
Virgin wife; thus the the mother, children and servants must be destroyed of
the first government, and new ones for the second government. The same is for
Commonwealths, for first, absolute power must be got; Secondly, all old laws
must be abolished; Thirdly, strangers must come to inhabit, to settle a
government; for mixed laws of old and new, will no more agree in government,
then cross humors in a private family.

Of Courts.
COurts should be a pattern and an example of virtue to all the rest of the
kingdom, being the ruler and chief head, to direct the body of state; but most
commonly instead of clemency, justice, modesty, friendship, temperance,
humility, and unity, there is faction, pride, ambition, luxury covetousnesle,
hate, envy, slander, treachery, flattery, impudence, and many the like; yet
they are oft-times covered with a veil of smooth professions and
protestations, which glisters like gold, when it is a copper'd tinsel: but to
study Court-ship, is rather to study dissembling formality, then noble reality.

Of a lawful Prince, or inhereditary Prince.
A Prince that is born to a just title becomes careless, as thinking his right
to his Crown, is a sufficient warrant, or born for the loyalty of his Subjects
which makes him trust the conduct of his greatest affairs to those he favors
most, as thinking his care and pains a superfluity. Thus he becom's as ignorant
to the affairs of his kingdom, as his subjects of his abilities; For few Kings
know thoroughly the laws made by their predecessors, but what themselves make,
nor the humors of the people, nor the strength, nor weakness of their
kingdom; whereas an usurper dares trust none but himself, which makes him more
wise in governing, more sure in keeping, knowing the condition of the kingdom
better by experience, which he gets by practice, and the humors of the people.
which he gets by observation, which gives him ability of judgment to chose
fit men for proper places where otherwise he may put the asle where the fox
should be, and the sheep where the Lion should be, the serpent where the dove
should be, and thus misplacing of men in several offices, and commands, is many
times the ruin of a kingdom: whereas an usurper, being a subject most
commonly, knows better to command; like as a middle region knows better what is
below it, then the highest region does, so those men that are subject to
Authority can see better, then when they have full power of command; but the
way is so dangerous, as a kingdom seldom escapes from an unrecoverable ruin.

Of an Usurper.
OF all Princely, and Monarchical Governors, an Usurper grows most commonly
the justest, and wisest Prince, when he is once settled in his possession,
unless fear of being dispossessed infects his thoughts, and so grows furious
with a distempered jelousie, which brings the plague of Tyranny, breaking out
in sores of cruelty, and they shall sooner want means and life, then he will
industry for his safety; but otherwise, if he have so much courage to subdue
his fears; he becoms an excellent Prince; for what with his ambition to be
thought better then his predecessor, and that the subject might not repine at
the change, and out of a covetousness to keep his power, and to settle it upon
his posterity, and out of a Luxurious desire to enjoy it peaceably, that he
might reap the plenty thereof, makes him become more careful and circum spect,
in executing justice, and more prudent, and industrious in making good and
prositable laws, to tie the hearts of the people more firm unto him, that their
love may wipe out his ill title, and thus settles his new and false authority
by an insinuating Government.

Clemency makes the greatest Monarch.
HE is the greatest Monarch that is most beloved of the subject, because he
has not only the power over men's bodies, but over their minds; where he that
is hated and feared has only a power of the body; but the mind is a rebel,
and stands out against him, thus freedom makes obedience, when bondage, and
slavery, is but a forced authority, because content is not there, and there is
more labor in Tyranny, with whipping the people into obedience, then the
pleasure of being obeyed

Of Tyrannical Government.
THe most Tyrannical Government is by Armies; for whatsoever intentions they
are raised for, if they are not disbanded as soon as the work is ended, they
grow mutinous; for idle time makes them corrupt one another; but if they be
settled in Government, either to keep the people in subjection, or secure their
Princes; in time they will not only keep the people in subjection, but become
Tyrants to their Princes, or Governors: as for example, the Romans that
conquered all the world, when their armies had no more work to do, they fell
upon their Emperors, and murdered them, pulling some down, and setting others
up; that at some times there have been three or four, and at other times none
to govern the Empire, and how often, nay how few die of the Emperors of the
Turks in peace, for the Janisaries whom they raised for their guard murders
them upon the least dislike, and many other examples may be given; wherefore it
is as great a wonder to hear of an Army to protect their Governors, as usual
to destroy them; but this comfort only is to those that live under the power
of the sword, that as they destroy their heads, so they destroy themselves; for
without Government nothing can last; and there can be no Government without
superiority or superiors; for there must be both authority and obedience, to
make a Harmonical Commonwealth.

Of the favor of Princes.
THere is no greater advantage to a Prince, then to prefer men that have the
reputation, of being wise, valiant and honest, or those men that are great in
alliance, or have great estates, for men of wisdom they enable their Princes,
by their counsel, and men of valor they enable their Princes by execution, and
honest men enable them by their trust, and men of alliances enable them by
their power, and rich men help to maintain their war; but poor and mean-born
men are leaches that suck in the wealth of the kingdom, and spue it forth in
vanities, they bring nothing to their Prince, but hatred from the commons,
through envy to those that are preferred.

The misplacing of Honors that causes Rebellion.
OUtward Honor should be the mark of inward, worthy a reward; for action
proceeding from valor, and wisdom in conducting and governing, maintaining and
keeping, assisting and obeying their King and Country. ButifHonour be placed by
favor, and not for merit: it brings envy to those which are honored, and
hatred to the Prince, for honoring such persons; which envy and hate bring
murmur, discontent brings war and ruin to the kingdom. But Kings should be like
good husbands, that sow their seed in fertile ground, and not in barren ground,
where the cost and pains will be lost, neither do they fling in their seeds in
a lump, but spread them about, so Princes should divide their favors, amongst
the worthiest persons, not to favor one, to discontent all the rest.

The cause of Rebellion.
THere is nothing causes rebellion so soon as the unequal living of the
subject; as for a Noble man, who strives to live like his King, a Gentleman to
live like a Noble man, and a Pesant, or a Citizen to live like a Gentleman; For
every man living not according to their quality, will in short time think his
quality according to his expense, which must needs make a disorder, where there
is an inequality of degrees, and not in expense: for the rate of the expense
must be set at the degree of the person; for when a Noble man sees an
inferior person in as good, or better equipage then himself, it begets envy,
and envy causes murmur, murmur faction, faction rebellion, and the inferior
sort living at the rate of the nobler sort begets pride, pride ambition,
ambition faction, faction rebellion, and thus the Nobler sort striving to keep
up their dignity, and the inferior through their pride out-braves the nobler,
then those of the same degrees, are tempted to live above their abilities even
with their equals, thus striving to out-brave one another, they run into
poverty, and being poor, they fear no loss; for having little to maintain
life, they set it at stake, either to lose all or to get more for in civil wars
all is fish that comes to net whereas every man living in his degree, envy is
abated, pride abated, luxury abated, neighbourly love and kindness bred and
peace kept, and every one thrives in his quality, and grows rich by frugality,
and riches beget care, care begets fear: and modest fear keeps peace.

Of Ceremony.
CEremony is rather of superstitious show, then a substance, it lives in
formality not in reality, yet it is that which keeps up the Church, and is the
life of religion, it heightens and glories the power of Kings, and States, it
strikes such a reverence and respect in the beholders, as it begets fear and
wonder, in so much as it a mazes the spirits of men to humiliation, and
adoration, and gives such a distance as it deifies humane things; or ceremony
has such a majestical form, as it becomes a kind of a god, for it creates
such a superstition, that it is not only served with earnest endeavors, but
many times with such a fury, that often times the observer runs into madness:
but as it strikes fear, so it begets pride, yet ceremony is so necessary as
without it Commonwealths would run into a confusion; for it is the officer to
make way for command, and obedience, which keeps peace and creates order, which
order is to place things in such manner, forms, and times.

Of Councillors.
An idle or lazy man is unfit for a Counselor, because he will not take so
much pains to consider to the bottom of a cause.

And a Epicure is an unfit man for a Counselor; for his mind is so set on
his delight, as it is buried to all other thoughts.

And a doubtful man is an unfit man for a Counselor, because he cannot
resolve upon any thing.

And a fearful man is an unfit Counselor, because he can never give a solid
opinion for fear of danger. Discord in Counsel many times proves very
prejudicial to a state.

Age becomes Counsel and command.
IT is seemly and fit for age to be in all commands, and Councels; for that
which makes a wise Privy Counselor, or Statesman, is aged experience in
active times, bred in observing, quick in conceiving, industrious in
continuing, led with honesty, forced to policy, and in commands; ages gravity
forces authority, and compels obedience by his wise conduct; wherefore those
that prefer youth before age, it is to esteem the strength of the body before
the strength of the brain, and if so a horse is to be preferred before a man.

Of Command and order.
THough command is to have the first place as coming from nature or power, yet
it cannot execute its power without order, and Ceremony; for ceremony and order
are the two necessary parts of man, that uphold the natural, or powerful
commands and obediences to the superiors from the inferiors; for commands and
obedience make Commonwealths, which Commonwealths make contracts, which
contracts make peaco, and peace makes every one to enjoy a propriety, so as
they work to one and the same end, though they are several, for commands
creates Ceremony, Ceremony order, and order and Ceremony give distinction,
distinction gives obedience, obedience peace.

A valiant Prince.
IT is a great encouragement for a Prince to be valiant, and have courage, for
it makes obedience in subjects, and keeps forraigners from intruding; for let a
king have many vices, if he have but that one virtue; he shall be powerful at
home, and famous abroad, and it is not only esteemed in princes; but in
private men, for a valiant man shall rest quietly, without controlment, when a
coward shall be troubled with continual affronts; but I mean not a Tyrant; for
tyranny is the child of fear, not of courage; for fear makes suspicion, and
suspicion makes false suggestions, and that brings cruelty; yet a soft nature
is in a degree of a coward in the worlds esteem; for though he has courage to
fight, yet the easiness of his nature makes him quickly forgive, and so
perhaps to put up a wrong, and the world conceives not so much the goodness of
the nature, as apt to condemn it, for a defect of his valor; but a soft and
tender nature shall suffer with much patience, which shows a greater courage
then a stronger nature, which gains him much pity, and a great deal of love,
but it is only in affliction, for there his courage is most seen, so passive
courage gets love in affliction, and active courage gets praises in prosperity,
it is observable, that often times a very wise man begets a fool, and a very
valiant man a coward; when an indifferency shall continue in a race for many
descentsit seems as if nature were limited, or had equal proportion of good and
bad, that when she has been prodigal to one, makes her necessitated to
another, but nature is wise, for she does not make her favor common, because
she would leave them esteemable.

Of Wars in general.
WAr as it destroys men in fight, so there are more marriages, and begetting of
generations then in peace; next by the many and several actions it gives
theames for Writers, and so produces many books, and certainly much
experience, both for actions of war and policy of state: and wars do not only
show men's abilities but beget abilities by the experiences of several changes
of fortune; besides, it shows the different nature of men, as the cruel, and
those that are merciful, the coward and the valiant, the covetous and the
liberal, or generous, the prodigal and the provident, the slothful and the
industrious, the noble and the base. War is the means to show justice piety
charity, honesty, lovegenerosity, wisdom, patience, strength command, and
obedience; but yet war brings Atheism, cruelty hard-heartednesse,
stubbornness prodigality; it corrupts youth women, and good manners, it
destroys laws and religion, it begets envy, faction, revenge, theft, it brings
death and destruction to that Kingdom that has the weaker party.

Of an Army.
LIttle Armies cause great expenses, by reason of the waste they make, when in
peace every one gets his own living, by theirindustry, but when they are
gathered together in a body they become idle; for an Army the State is to
maintain them, by giving them money, or free quarter, which the last most
commonly takes the first place; thus an Army does impoverish the kingdom three
several ways, first that it does not only give pay to so many people to live
idly, unless it be when they fight; but to feed upon the industry of those
that are not in arms; next they do not only feed upon a kingdom moderately,
but make havoc and spoil, destroying most commonly the very stock and store.
And lastly it does impoverish the treasury of a kingdom. which forces the
governor to lay heavy taxes upon the estates of the Gentry, and the industry
of the Commons.

Of the loss in Battles.
WHere history mentions battles, they make nothing to speak of a hundred
thousand killed in a battle; but it is sooner writ, then fought; for let us
imagine, fifty thousand should stand still, or forced to do so until their
throats were cut, and it will take up some time, and when a man speaks of a
battle, the longest is from sun rising, to sunset. I do not mean the days
near the Pole; but near the Line; for nature requires rest and food, and
battles are to return blows as well as to receive, wherefore fighting requires
time, before death, besides the quarrel; for they do not always kill so soon
as they meet, neither can they fight all at once, for squadrons are five and
ten men deep; besides dead bodies of horses, and men will hinder much their
incounters, but some say most are killed in execution, when one party runs a
way; it may be answered, that fear is very swift: and often times it gets from
revenge, and I have hard a good soldier say, that thirty thousand on each
side, is as much as can fight in one battle; for greater numbers make rather
confusion then an execution, but report kills more then a great Army can bury.

The Situation for wars safety
THose Countries that are either barren or woody, or mountainous, are seldom
overcome, although they are far less in number, that are the defendants, then
the Aassilants, which makes the defendant Commanders seem wise, valiant and
fortunate, when it is the Country that gives the advantage: and not altogether
the men.

The hazzards of War.
THere is nothing more hazzardous to an Army in the day of battle, then for the
chief Commander to lead the vanguard; for a General should reserve himself,
against such time as his army is oppressed, for there is nothing more revives the
wearied and drooping spirits in the common Soldiers, and that gives more
courage then the sight of the General; besides, the office of a General is more
to order, then to fight, and it is not only the fighting that wins the battle,
but wise conduct. Thus a General must not only be known to his Soudiers to be
valiant, but to be honest and wise, his courage is their trench, his wisdom is
their fort, his honesty is the guard to keep them. But the advantage in war is
experienced Commanders, diligent officers, practiced Soldiers, skilful
Ingineers, and situation of place.

Of a civil War.
THe greatest storm that shipwracks honest education, good laws, and decent
customs, is civil-wars, which splits the vessel of a Commonwealth, and buries
it in the waves of ruin; but civil wars may be compared to a pair of cards,
which when they are made up in order, every several suit is by it self, as from
one, two, and three, and so to the tenth card, which is like the commons in
several degrees, in order, and the coat cards by themselves which are the
Nobles; but factions, whch are like gamesters when they play, setting life at
the stake shuffle them together, intermixing the Nobles and Commons, where
loyalty is shuffled from the crown, duty from Parents tenderness from
children, fidelity from Masters, continencies from husbands and wives, truth
from friends, from justice innocence, charity from misery; Chance plays, and
fortune draws the stakes.

Of foreign War.
Foreign war is necessary some times to maintain Peace at at home, it opens
the vein of discontents, and lets out the hot and fevourish amb tion of the
mind, which otherwise would grow to a dangerous, and mad rebellion; yet it
makes most commonly a kingdom weak, and thin, according as the Physic does
work; for if the purges be very strong, it makes them faint and feeble, so the
success of war makes a kingdom, ill fortune makes it lean, and weak, good
fortune gives it strength, and makes it fat.

Of rash Commanders.
A Man at his first entry into actions, ought to be very careful of showing
himself prudent, and moderate, as well as bold, and valiant, a good commander
should overcome by Policy and conduct as well as by violence, and force of
armies; for many a gallant army is lost through the rashness of a commander.

And a foolish, and negligent Commander makes his soldiers as cowardly, as a
careful Commander makes them valiant; But a good commander gets love of his
soldiers, as finding his care and knowing his skill, and approved to have
courage which is to be required from a commander, when those that are rash,
Careless, ignorant, proud, improvident, timorous, doubtful, are to be shunned,
and not to be employed, but they are best to govern, that have noble and
generous hearts, for liberality and generosity, are the nature of a god.

Of being armed.
A Man that will go into the field unarmed: is either a desperate fool, or he
means to run away, when it comes to his turn to fight, for a valiant man will
arm his body in the day of battle, to save his life, to win an honor and
reputation of victory. But some love pleasure more then honor, and some love
honor more then life.

Of a General, and a Colonel, and Army.
A General of a hundred thousand men, sounds loud in the ears of the world;
when a Captain of a Brigade, is hardly taken notice of, although his conduct in
ordering his Brigade, has been as skilful, and as prudent, and his Courage and
his Onset as daring as the Generals; yet such advantages and ods has numbers,
as it makes great reckoning in the World, when the Actions of a few are never
measured.

Of the Power of the Sword.
A Sword is a valiant man's friend, he will sooner part with Life than part with
it, and courts it as his Mistress, being as industrious and studious to know
the Art and use of the one, as to know the nature, disposition, and inclination
of the other: for a Sword is a defender and a mantainer of his Honor, it is a
strength against Dangers, a shelter for Virtue, a protection to Innocence; it
is the Key that opens the Gate of Fames great Court; it humbles the Proud, it
advances the Low and Mean to the height of a Reputation it Civilizes Nations,
it environs a Commonwealth, it decides quarrels, it divides spoils; it is the
Commander of the World, it is the Conducter to all noble and Heroic Actions;
it is the Vicegerent to death, a Guard to life; it is the Bolt of Jupiter, the
Trident of Neptune, the Cerberus of Pluto; It can do more than Virtue can do,
for it can command, Virtue can only entreat or persuade; the very signification
of a Sword is great, for it signifies both Power and Justice, Command and Rule.
When I speak of a Sword, I mean any thing that performs the same function and
office, as to affault and defend, which all forts of Arms will not do.

Of Commonwealths, or Statesmen.
THe grave formalists account good Statesmen those that are Tyrants, such as
Cato was, who wrought the destruction of the Roman Commonwealth; but very
severe and strickt rules of Art, often times are broken by the over powerful
force of Nature, which cannot endure to be bound beyond the strenght of
moderate Liberty; wherefore moderation in Government is as necessary as
moderation for health; for those that restrain their Appetite too much, starve
the Body, and those that give no restraint, kill it with Surfets: so likewise
in a Commonwealth, those that restrain Liberty too much, inslave it, and those
that give to much Freedom, confound it, thus, either ways bring death to the
Body, or ruin to the Commonwealth.

Of Partiality of the World.
OUtward Honors should be the signs of inward Worth, as Actions proceeding
from valor, and wisdom in conducting and governing affairs to the best, for
their Countries service: but outward honor is as all other gifts of Fortune,
unchosenly given; for the Coward, and the Fool, and the Knave, are many times
crowned with Honor, when the Valiant, the Wise, and the Just, sit unregarded,
and unrewarded; wherefore Passion and Erroneous opinions are the two Emperors
of the world.

Of Men.
Some in the dispraise of men, say that they are so opinionated, as they think
they are able to govern the whole world, in all active affairs, although they
have neither foresight nor experience, and that most of them are as humorsome,
and as fantastical and inconstant, as Women, full of brags and vain glory,
feigning themselves to be otherways than they are, as to be thought wise by
postures, with ringing their heads on one side, or winking with their eyes, or
shrinking up their shoulders, others again by hiding their ignorance with
gravity and formality; some are tedious in stuffing the ears of the hearers
with History, others with controversies; some again, with long, barren, and
stale tales, then whispering of secrets and dangerous Plots; some again have
more courage in their words and looks, than in their hearts; and some so
spruce, as they seem effeminat, and others so affectedly careless, as they are
rude and seem Clownish; thus they put more false faces on than Women do: but
sure there be many Men in the World as their wisdom makes them as petty Gods,
able to manage and govern great and difficult affairs; and a wise man is a
valiant wan, not a desperate man; a quiet man, not a quarreller; a civil man,
not a dissembler; an industrious, not a busy man; and humble, not a flatterer;
a generous man, not a prodigal; a prudent man, not a covetous man; a patient
man, not an insensible man; a fashionable, not a spruce man, and I have heard
say, that a Worthy, Honorable, and a Gallant man, is one that is Wise, Just,
and Honest.

Of Behavior.
THere is nothing wins more upon the soul of men, than Civility and Courteous
behavior; it indears more than words: for Eloquent Oratory, though it
insinuates, yes it is like a Tyrant that carrys the opinions of men like
Captives by force, rather than wins them by gentle persuasions, neither will it
do that unless it be mixed with an Elegancy of delivery and Courteous behavior,
which is without all affectation, which Eloquence seldom or never has; but a
free and Civil behavior causes affection to run after it, it abates the pride
of the proud to meet it, it ingentles the wild and barbarous, it softens the
rigid, it begets compassion in the cruel, it moves pity in misery, it begets
love in prosperity, and most commonly good nature has Civil and courteous
behavior, but the Civil and courteous have not always good natures; so that
it becomes verity in the own, and hypocrisy in the other, which nevertheless
plcaseth, although it be a fair face to a false heart.

Of Natural posture, and Words.
ALl natural postures have a coherence with the nature of the mind; as a man
that has high ambitious thoughts has a proud garb, a man of great and
fearless Spirit has a resolute garb, a timorous and a fearful mind has a
fauning and crouching garb; a mistrustful mind, a wary land sly garb; a mind
that has few desires, a dull garb; a vain mind, a fantastical garb; a busy
mind, a restless garb; a luxurious nature, a lazy garb, and so many in like
kind; thus as there are several natures, so there are natural postures
belonging to such minds: for if the art of breeding were not, which brings
several customs, which customs are a second nature, the body would follow the
humors of the mind.

Likewise our words are apt to run according to our Thoughts: for if our
thoughts hunt after self praises, our words most commonly are boasting, and
bragging; if our thoughts hunt after debaucherys, our words are lascivious; if
our thoughts are envious, our words are spightful; if proud, our words are
scornful; if amorous, our words are affected and whining; if our thoughts are
full of grief, our words are complaining; if angry, then our words are railing;
thus upon every subject that the Thoughts work upon, the Tongue draws forth, or
spins forth thrids of discourse.

Of Youth.
YOuth ought to have good and grave Counsels, and solid studies to poyse them;
for if the bottoms or keel of life be not balanced, the sayls of vanity will
over-turn their Ship of happiness: for it is not those light Counsels that
Parents do vulgarly use to give their Children, that make them wise, as saying,
Take heed of catching cold, or not eating such and such meats, or teaching them
how to put off their hat, or making a Leg with a good grace, though that does
well, nor yet to keep them too hard to their studies, for it makes them most
commonly pedandick; but to send them abroad to learn to know the World, that
they may know men, and manners, to see several Nations, and to observe several
Natures, Customs, Laws, and Ceremonies, their Wars, or Contracts of Peace, thus
they may come to be good Statesmen, or Commanders in War, and be able to do
their Country good service, and to get to themselves honor and fame: besides,
the knowledge of the world gives a satisfaction to the mind; for when they see
there is a change, and misfortunes that are not to be avoided, they will not
make every little cross an affliction, but take afflictions as things
necessary, and ought to be born with patience; and by this shall they live more
happily, and dye more willingly.

Of the breeding of Children.
CHildren should be taught at first, the best, plainest, and purest of their
language, and the most significant words; and not, as their nurses teach them,
a strange kind of gibbridge, broken language of their own making, which is like
scraps of several meats heapt together, or hath'd, mixed, or minced: so do they
the purest of their language; as for example, when Nurses teach children to go,
instead of saying go, they say do, do, and instead of saying come to me, they
say tum to me, and when they newly come out of a sleep, and cannot well open
their eyes, they do not say My Child cannot well open his, or her eyes, but my
chid tant open its nies, and when they should bid them speak, they bid them
peak, and when they should ask them if they will or would drink, they ask them
if they will dinck, and so all the rest of their language they teach Children,
is after this manner, when it is as easy for those that learn Children to
speak, and more easy for the Children to learn, plainly, and the right
language, than this false language, which serves them to no use, but only takes
up so much the more time to learn to speak plain, and as they should do, which
time might be employed in the understanding of sense, which is lost in words.
And it is not only the foolish, and ill-bread nurses that speak to Children
thus, but their Fathers, which many times are accounted Wisemen, and their
Mothers discreet Women, which my thinks is very strange, that wise and rational
men, when they talk to Children, should strive to make themselves Children in
their speech, and not rather strive to make Children speak like wise men: yet
such is the power of custom, that wisemen will follow it, although it be
unnecessary, uneasy, and foolishly hurtful; for certainly this broken
compounded and false language they teach Children, is so Imprinted in the
Brains, as it can hardly be rubbed out again, and the Tongue gets such a habit
of an ill and false pronuntiation, as when they are grown to men and women's
estate, their speech slows not so easy nor sweet, nor their tongue moves not so
voluble nor smooth, as other ways they would. Likewise they learn them the
rudest language first, as to bid them say such a one Lies, or to call them
Rogues and the like names, and then laugh as if it were a witty jest. And as
they breed them in their language, so they breed them in their sports,
pastimes, or exercises, as to play with children at boe-peep, blind-man-buff,
and Cocks hod, as they call them, that is, to muffle their head and eyes, and
then they run about to knock their heads against the doors, posts, and tables,
to break their Legs over stools, threshholds, or to run into the fire, where
many times they desorm themselves with the mischiefs that follow; or to hide
themselves behind hangings and old cubbords, or dirty holes, or the like
places, where they foul their clothes, disaffect the Brain with stincks, and
are almost chokt with dirt and dust Cobwebs, and Spiders, Flys and the like
getting upon them; also to role upon the ground, likewise to stand upon their
heads, when dancing might be learned with the feet, as easy as tumbling in
several postures, and to stand upon the head; and is it not as easy to learn
them to write, and read, as to build houses with Cards? they are both but
making of figures, and joining together; and is it not as easy to learn them
the Globe, as to play at Cards? and is it not as easy to tell them of Arts and
Sciences, as to tell them feigned and foolish tales of Tom Thum, and of
Spirits, and the like, frighting them so much as makes them of timorous
natures, and Effeminat Spirits? when Children would take as much delight in
Arts and Sciences, nay more, if they were taught them at first. Likewise it
were as easy, and less danger, to teach them to valt, which is necessary for
horsemen, as to climb a Pear Tree and the like; and likewise it were as easy to
learn them to fence with a stick, or at least to hold it in a defensive
posture, as to play at Cat, or Chick stone, Quaits, or the like; wherefore it
is no wonder there are so few wise men, when Children are bread so foolishly;
so many so unhandsomely behaved, when Children are bred so rudely; so many
Cowards, when Children are bred so fearfully; so many deformed, when Children
are taught such dangerous, mischievous, and hurtful sports; so many false, when
they are taught to tell lies from their Cradles, as thinking it no vice, or
fault in Children; and many more examples might be given of the ill breeding of
Children.

Of Gentlewomen that are sent to board Schools.
IT is dangerous to put young Women to board Schools, unless their Parents live
so disorderly, as their children may grow wicked or base by their examples; for
most commonly in these Schools they learn more vices than good manners; for it
is a good task, for one body to breed up one child well, and as they ought to
be bred, at most two or three, but it is too much for one to breed up many, as
for one Woman to breed up twenty young Maids; it is true, they may educate
their Persons, but it is a doubt whether they do, or can educate their minds;
they may learn them to sing well, but it is a question whether they learn them
to think well; they may learn them measures with the feet, and mistake the
measures of a good life; they may learn them to write by rule, but forget the
rules of modesty.

For the danger is in those Schools, where a great many Gentlewomen of several
Families and Births, degrees of ages, various humors, different dispositions,
natures and qualities, do like several sorts of fruits, which when they are
gathered and heaped together, soon putrify and corrupt, and some become rotten
at the Coar; where if every Pear, Aple, and Plum were laid even by themselves
apart, in a dry and clean place, they would be sound, wholesome, and last as
long as their natures were to last: so if young Women were bred singly,
carefully, and industriously one by one, there would be no danger they should
learn from each other crafts, dissembling, fraud, spite, slander, or the like;
besides where, there are many together of several dispositions, they are not
only apt to catch the infection of ill qualities from each other, but many
times they breed vices, which ruin themselves, fortunes, and Families, and like
Maggets consume their Estates, or eat a hole thorough their reputation.

Besides, all board Scholars of the Effeminat sex are like salemeat dressed at a
Cooks shop, which always tastes of the dripping pan or smoke; so most commonly
those that are bred at Schools, have a smack of the School, at least in their
behavior, that is a constraintness; but the exercises although they are
commendable in Women of quality, yet it is not these exercises or virtues (as
they call them) in Italy, which give them good breeding, but to instruct their
youth with useful knowledge, to correct their ignorance with right
understanding, to settle their mind to virtue, to govern their passions by
reason, to rule their unsatiable or distempered appetites with temperance, to
teach them noble principles, honorable actions, modest behaviors, civil
demeanours, to be cleanly, patient, and pious, which none can teach either by
example, or instructions, or both, but those that have been nobly bred
themselves.

How a Gentleman ought to be bred, and spend his time.
A Gentleman ought to be skilful in the use of his Sword, in the manage of
Horses, to Vault, to Wrestle, to Dance; the first defends his Honor and
Country, the next is for Command in Cavalry, the third makes him ready in the
day of Battle to Horse himself, the fourth keeps him from being overcome by a
Clown or Pezant; for the slights in Wrestling will overcome great strengths;
the fifth gives his limbs a graceful motion. His exercises should be Masculine:
for better it were to see a Gentleman shoe an Horse, than to play on the Vial,
or Lute, Virginal, or any other musical instrument; for that shows the
command Man has over Beast. Or to carry a burden on his back, than to sit
idely at Cards or Dice: for Idleness is like the sluggish Worm, that is neither
able to help nor defend it self. Or it were better see a Gentleman hew down
trees, or dig in the bowels of the earth amongst minerals, than painting, or
pencilling: for that shows manly strength, command and force over the hardiest
of natures works, so as it be voluntary and not stavish. It is more manly to be
a Soldier, than a Clerk, not that a Gentleman should be rough and rude like
Savages, and only to have force like a Beast; but to be like a God above all
other Creatures, and to be like a God is never to be Idle, nor to be employed
but about things that tend to some useful, noble, and glorious end.

Swimming is not very useful for a Gentleman.
TO be skilful in Swimming brings nothing to a man's honor, it is only useful
in the time of danger, and a man runs greater hazards in the gaining that Art,
than the advantage he is like to get by it, and had better adventure his life,
if such a mischance should happen to be required, to swim, than to adventure it
every day in the learning it: for if the Cramp take him, or the Stitch, or the
Cholick, or a Weed insnarling any part of him, he is gone, and many other
accidents may chance to drown him; so that swimming is more dangerous than
honorably safe, and a Gentleman should learn first those Actions that bring
Honor, then those for Safety; a man should learn first how to Assault his foe,
and then to Defend himself, and Swimming is more to save his life than get a
fame.

A Gentleman's Study.
A Gentleman should not be ignorant, but know all the good is to be known, and
the bad, or else he can hardly know what is best; yet leave the practice of the
worst to the inferior: but his study should be Navigation, Fortification,
Architecture, Culture, Waterworks, Fireworks, and the like, which Studies are
profitable to his Country, both for Strength, Plenty, and Use, which make a
Kingdom flourish; for every man should, like a Be, bring Honey to the Hive, and
not, like the effeminat Drone, suck out the sweet, and idely live upon the
Heroic labor of others; but to study Laws is rather to study division than
settlement, to study Divinity is rather to study Controversy than salvation, to
study Philosophy is to seek that they cannot find, to study History is to study
Lys more than Lives, where a Gentleman should study Truth, follow Truth, and
practice Justice; a little Rhetoric does well to cloth his mind in soft
numbers, trim it with handsome phrases; and a Gentleman should converse with
Poetry, for Poetry sweetens the nature, not softens it, to make it facil, but
civilizes it, making it courteous, affable, and conversable, inspiring the mind
with high and noble thoughts, which is the way to be inshrined in honorable
Fame; Like an Urn that keeps the ashes of the body from being scattered and
lost, so Fame keeps good deeds in the Urn of the memory.

Bred with the Muses.
THose that are bred up with the Muses are most commonly of sweet dispositions,
Civil and Courteous in their behavior, Pleasant and Witty in their discourse,
Noble and Heroic in their actions, Free and Generous in their distributions,
Grateful for obligations, Compassionate to the miserable, and Charitable to the
distressed.

But those that are born Poets are ingenuous by nature, and prone to invention,
quick in apprehension, various in imagination or conception, their thoughts
work generously, and entertain their time constantly, and are the best
Companions to life, where Fancy presents several Scenes, and Wit speaks the
Prologues.

True Poets and natural Philosophers are rather born such, than learned to be
such: for it is a natural Ingenuity that creates fine fancies, and produces
rational opinions.

Of Poetry.
AS for Poetry, although it sits not in the first form in Wisdoms School, nor
the second, yet it sits on the third; for on the first form sits Honesty, that
is to be honest for honesties sake, not out of by ends, either for profit,
credit, or other respects that it brings, but out of Justice; The next is Rule
or Moderation, which is to rule our actions, and moderate our appetites; for
men may mean well, yet out of indiscretion may run themselves into many errors,
not only in offending themselves, but in offending their neighbors, which may
cause repentance, and he is the wisest man that has least to repent by
moderating the appetite; for whosoever goes beyond the rule of Reason causes
a pain instead of a pleasure, a loathing or hate instead of a release or
desire; for there is an old saying and a true, Too much of a good thing is
stark naught. In the next place comes in Poetry, wherein is included Music and
Rhetoric, which is Number and Measure, Judgment and Fancy, Imitation and
Invention. It is the finest work that Nature has made; for it animates the
Spirits to Devotion, it fires the Spirits to Action, it begcts Love, it abates
Hate, it tempers Anger, it asswageth Grief, it eases Pain, increases Joy,
allays Fear, and sweetens the whole life of Man, by playing so well upon the
Brain, as it strikes the strings of the Heart with Delight, which makes the
Heart to dance, and keeps the Mind in tune, whereby the Thoughts move equally
in a round Circle, where Love sits in the midst as Mistress, and judges For if
Wisdom is the way to Happiness, and Happiness lives in Delight, and Delight in
the Spirits, then Poetry is a part of Wisdom, since it is a Commander of that
part and Essence of Man.

The Pastime of Wit.
WIT chears the Heart, refreshes the Spirits, delights the Mind, entertains
the Thoughts, sweetens Melancholy, dresses Joy, mourns with Sorrow, pleases
Lovers, excuses Falsehoods, mends Faults, begs Pardon. Wit is a fine Companion,
either in private Closets, full Courts, or in long Travels. Wit is neither
troublesome, nor chargeable. Wit has no bottom, but is like a perpetual
Spring. Wit is the Sun of the Brain.

The dis-esteem Youth has of Age.
YOuth despises Age, and thinks, that because they are not full of Vanity,
they have not so much Knowledge; Where Age pityeth Youth, remembering, their
present Knowledge was got at the charge of their youthful follyes: But Youth
(believing nothing but what their present Humor leads them unto, and their
undigested Brain presents unto them) says, than an Old Brain is rotten; not
comparing Nestor's Brain, which was old in Years, but sound in Judgment; and
Jeroboam's Juncto, which was young in Years, and weak in Counsel. But one
Nestor's Brain is able to turn all young Brains, and make them so disty, that
they shall not know what to do: For from young Counsel proceeds vain Designs,
fruitless Travels, hard Adventures, and successless Ends; but from the Counsel
of the Aged, Danger is walled out, and Peace is kept within; and when they must
War, they take not Fortune, but Prudence, to be their Guide; And the Errors
that Youth commits, Age is fain to rectify, though sometimes they are past
remedy. So that Youth is a kind of Monster in State Affairs, which has neither
Head nor Tail; for they begin without Probabilities, and end in Ruins; when Age
begins wisely, and ends successfully. Wherefore it is better to take Aged Men,
balanced with Wisdom, than Young Men with Empty Heads, or else a Head filled
with rash Folly, or light Vanities.

The Virtues of Age.
AGE is careful, watchful, circumspect, solid, and grave, slow, but sure;
knows Business, Time, and Men; Constant, secret, prudent, and temperate; Their
Affections are placed upon Worth and Merit, and love where they should; so that
Age is wise, for it makes Consideration to open the Gate, and Reason to lead
the way. I speak not here of Old Men, for those can only be called old, where
Time has made a defect in their Memory and Understanding; so that some may
never come to be old, although they live long; for Age has more power over the
Body, than the Mind: But as a Woman is at the height and ripeness of her Beauty
at the years of 20. so a Man is at the height and ripeness of Understanding
about the years of 50. For by that time he may arrive by experience to the
knowledge of attaining to be a Wise man.

The Defects of Age.
AGE is covetous and griping, superstitious and fearful, mistrustfull and
jealous, testy and froward, dull and heavy, lazy and slothful, forgetful, and
tedious in their discourse; neither have they great affection to any thing, or
for any thing.

A Young Man not a Wise Man.
IT is as impossible for a Young Man to be a Wise Man, as for them that cannot
read their A, B, C, to read any Book, or to speak before they have learnd, or
to go before they have strength: For how can a Man be Wise without Knowledge;
which Knowledge is got by Experience, and Experience is the Child of Time. For
though there may be many that live long, and know little, yet there are none,
that have lived but a little while, that can know much; which is Youth: For
Youth may know much for Youth, but not enough; for Knowledge consists in the
weight and measure of things; so that a Young Man may have a little flash of
Wit, but not a solid Understanding; and a Young Man may be a Hopeful Man, but
not a knowing wise Man; a Young Man may be a Virtuous Man, but not a Valiant
Man; for it will take up some time to know what true Valor is; and as Time
adds to the stature, and strength of Bodies, so it gives stature, and strength
of Knowledge, sound clearness of Understanding, which without it cannot be.

Youths virtue.
YOuth is bashful, pitiful, charitable, pious, quick and nimble, merry and
lively, cleanly and neat, liberal, loving and kind: But Vanities, which are the
Attendants, and Followers of Youth, in Age either come to be Vices, or else are
turned away like idle Companions as they are.

The Follyes of Youth.
YOuth is sudden, rash, desperate in their actions; as, to venture without all
reason, or likelihood; lavish and prodigal; for their Money is too heavy for
their Mind, till it be spent and their Lands trouble their way, till they be
sold; they are deboyst with Women, Gaming, and Wine; they are vain and
fantastical in their Fashions, Garbs, and Clothes; they are various, and
unconstant; for they will love one day to madness, and the next day hate to
abhorridness; they are impatient of delays; for if they may not have what they
would, they will hardly take it when they may; and they are so conceited, and
self-loved, as they believe all love them, and admire them, when few care or
think of them; then they are so credulous, and believe all for truth; and so
open and free, that they cannot keep counsel. So Youth loves all things that
are not his, but cares for nothing that is his own.

What becomes, or not becomes Age.
THere is nothing so ungrateful as to see Age to act the part of Youth, as
Dancing, Singing, playing on Music, and the like; or to wear gay Ribbons,
Feathers, or Clothes; or to see him Amorous and Wanton in Love; or to use any
light Gestures, or Discourses, which in Youth are graces to adorn them, but in
Age they are acts to deform them: But there is none so Aged, that Arms become
not, so long as he can bear them, or wear his Sword; for they are the
Accostments of his Courage, and Valor, the which he should never forsake; for
a Valiant Man lives in Active Courage, and dies in Passive, when he can Act no
more.

Of Fools.
THE Amorous Fool is one that sighs out Love-verses, sings Songs, and cries at
his Mistrifles Feet; complains of Cupid's Cruelty: but whosoever entertains his
love, he despises; and whosoever despises him, he dies for, and yet lives.

The Self-conceited Fool is one that scorns to take counsel; and does not only
think his Fancyes the fullest wit, and his Judgment the wisest, and his
Actions the regularest, but that his House, his Horse, his Dog, any thing is
best; not for the Conveniences of his House, or for the beautiful
Architectures, or for the situation; or that his Horse is the strongest, or
soundest, or best natured, or choyccst colored, or perfectest shaped, or
fullest of spirit, or swiftest of race, or surest of foot; or that his Dog is
the best Hound to hunt withal, or the best Spaniel to couch withal, or the
best Gray hound to run withal, or the best Mastiff to fight withal: So that
it is not for the worth, or benefit which he receives from any thing, that
makes him love, or csteem of it; But he thinks whatsoever is good, pleasant, or
profitable, is created so by being his.

The Humorsome Fool is one that does nothing for Reason, but out of Will.

The Passionate Fool will be Choleric, Jealous, Malicious, Envious, Sullen,
Merry, and Loves, and Hates, and knows not why.

The Fearful Fool shuns his own shadow, and is Poetical in his vain Fears, in
creating Fancies of Terror, wherein he makes Life a Torment, having always the
pains of Death upon him.

The Impatient Fool is all for the present; for he thinks his Throat cut,
until he be satisfied in his desires; a day to him is as a thousand years; nor
he scarce thinks of Heaven, because he enjoys it not.

The Luxurious Fool thinks of nothing, but to please his Senses; he knows no
Compassion, he neither regards Health, Honor, nor Profit; Ease and Idleness
are his dear Companions, and his Natural Affection is Voluptuousness.

The Slavish Fool will do any act through Fear.

The Learned Fool admires, and is in love with all other Languages besides his
own; for if he were bred with the Greek, or Hebrew, which are counted the most
significant, he would prefer Low Dutch, which has the least Compass, before
it. He is one that is Proud, in being acquainted with several Authors; although
his Acquaintance oppresses his Memory, smothers his Judgment by the multitude
of Opinions, kills his Health by his study, destroys, his Natural Wit by the
transplantings and ingraftings of what he reads. Then he is so bound up to
Rules, as he gives himself no reasonable Liberty.

The Talkative Fool loves not to hear any body speak but himself, neither will
he let them; for he speaks so fast, as he permits not, nor gives room for any
other to take place; insomuch, as what with his loud, fast, and tedious
discourse, he will make his Hearers deaf.

The Superstitious Fool is an Observer of Times, Postures, Figures, Noyses,
Accidents, and Dreams, and many such like. As for Times, they will not begin a
Journey, or marry, or buy Land, or build, or begin any work, but on such Days
as appear to be lucky. For Dreams, if they dream their Teeth fall out of their
head, or of Flowers, or Gardens, or of any thing green, or the like, or to see
their Faces in a Glass, or to fall from a Precipice, or being at Weddings, they
think it Fatal. For Noyses, the howling of Dogs, the croaking of Ravens, the
singing of Crickets, the skreeching of Owls. For Accidents, the bleeding three
drops at the Nose, Iron molds, the Right Eye itching, Salt falling to them. For
Postures, or Figures; as a Hare to run cross them, or to stumble at the Door.
Insomuch as they never enjoy any present Recreation, for fear of an evil
Accident.

The Venturous Fool thinks all desperate Actions honorable Valor; as to go
into the Field for Battle unarmed, or to wear something as a mark for the Enemy
to shoot at, or to give the Enemy any advantage; Where the Honor of the
Valiant is, to beat, and not to be beaten; For he is a Fool that will give his
Enemy ground. And others think it a Valor to leap over Hedges, and Ditches,
and Gates, to jump over dangerous places, to swim, or make their Horses swim
over large, great, and deep Rivers; or to try Experiments upon themselves; and
all to no purpose, but to show what they dare do. Whereas true Valor will do
none of these Actions, unless it be upon strong necessities; as to avoid and
hinder a great danger: but Fools have neither Foresight to prevent, nor
Judgment to choose, nor Patience to suffer; neither will they take any
example, to avoid either Inconvenience, or Danger; they run blindfold into all
Actions, (and as the Proverb says, They leap before they look) and stumble at
Straws; and either they so trouble themselves with what may come, as they never
enjoy the present, or they consider the future time so little, as they are
destroyed before they are aware. But as Fools make all things worse than they
are, in not giving them the right use: so Wise Men prevent Evils by their
foresight, mend what is bad, shun Danger, and what cannot be avoided, they bear
with Patience.

I have heard say, that the World is as one great Fool, in which, say some, the
Wise, though there be very few, are buried in the Rubbish of Fools, without
Monuments. But that saying is both foolish, and unjust, as to Condemn all,
because there is Folly in the most: But Envy and Malice may bark, yet they
cannot bite; therefore the Wise live in Renown, when Fools shall be scattered
as Dust before the Wind.

The Busy Fool is one that had rather break his head at his Neighbors door,
than keep it whole at home; he strives to decide all petty Quarrels, wherein he
is sure to get the hatred of one side, if not both; he is the Hackney for News,
lading himself at the Posthouse, and disburthening himself to all he meets; he
is more concerned with a foreign Ambassador, though he has no use of him than
the Ambassador is with his Embassages; he never fails Sessions, and Assizes,
nor Executions; he rises early, he eats hastily, walks fast, goes to Bed
late; and his Thoughts beat quicker than a Feverish Pulse; full of vain
Designs; offers his service to all, although he is not able to do any; he
strives to know all things, and takes not time to learn any thing; he makes
himself his greatest Enemy.

The Vainglorious Fool is one that sets himself to the most public view; and
if he has any Estate, he spends it in vain Entertainment; he seems to despise
those things he covets most; he reads his Letters in the Streets, as he rides,
or walks, to have the People think he is a Man of great business, although they
be Letters of his own writing; he makes his Horse pranse at a fair Ladies door,
or walks by, and looks up often, as if he had some Interest there, when the
Lady knows him not, or would despise him if she did; When any one visits him,
he calls for his Servant, asking where his people are, complains they are never
at home to wait, when the most he has is but a Lacquey and a Groom. Sometimes
he will pull out his Handkerchief, as for use, and two or three pieces of Gold
shall come forth with it, and scatter on the Ground, as if his Pockets were
full, when he laid those Pieces there of purpose; and when he reads a Letter of
News that he has borrowed, he will take out as many more as will sill a Bag;
that he may be thought a man of great business. He is like Alchimy, that makes
a great show, but has little worth.

The Exceptious Fool is one that thinks that all which is said, or was meant,
is against him; he hates whispering or laughing in any besides himself, and is
jealous of all men; he is as a Troubled Water, where no Beast will drink.

The Cautious Fool is always considering, but never resolving.

The Credulous and Incredulous, the one believes against all Reason, the other
will believe no Reason at all.

The Facile Fool can deny nothing; he will promise that he knows not how to
perform; he follows not Good, because it is best; nor shuns Evil, because it
is worst; for he follows as Persuasion leads, not as Reason guides.

The Inconstant Fool is one shuns all things which he knows; he will be a
Friend to death for a day, and the next as great an Enemy; he has no
settlement, neither for his Soul, Body, nor Estate; he has more several
Colors than the Camelion, and more Shapes than Proteus; he is as a Labyrinth,
where none can find a sure way.

The Impertinent Fool is always asking such questions as cannot be resolved;
offers his service where there is no occasion, or use of it; requesting those
things that cannot be granted; so as he will neither by denied, resolved, nor
counseled.

The Prodigal Fool is like a weak Stomach, that whatsoever it receives, it
casts forth; which makes his Purse like his Body, to dye of a Consumption.

The Extravagant is like the Prodigal, only his way is more various.

The Kind, Fond, and Tenderhearted Fool, is one that will promise, or part
with any thing that he has for the present, but repents himself as soon as he
has done; he embraces all things, but flings them away before he knows what
he had; his Heart is softened with sudden pity, but is hardened with little time;
so that it is variety of Objects that makes that Passion work.

The Affected Fool is one that speaks always in phrases, and proportions the
distance of Time between his words; his Countenance, and his Discourses, with
several postures of his Face, and his Hand, are like the Vane, or Weathercock
of a House, which is always in motion; and for its Garb, it is either so
loose, as if there were a solution of his Joints, or else so stiff, as if he
had no Joints at all; he neither eats, drinks, sits, walks, speaks, sleeps, or
any Natural Act, but he does it in a particular, and Artificial form.

The Fantastical Fool is wedded to strange singularities.

Men ought not to strive for Superiority with Women.
HE is either a Fool, or a Coward, that strives for the preheminency with a
Woman; a Coward, because he domineers over Weakness; a Fool, to dispute with
Ignorance. For Men should use Women as Nurses do Children, strive to please,
and yield to them in all things, but what will do them harm: As not to suffer
them to degrade themselves of their Honors by their Wantonness, or to spend
their Estate by heir Vanity, or destroy their Health by their ill orders; but
strive to delight them, giving them Liberty in all Honorable and Honest
Recreations, in moderate Expenses, and harmless Vanities: But he that strives
with his Wife, to win the Breeches, would have never had the wit to have fought
the Battles of Caesar. For a Gallant Man will never strive for the Breeches
with his Wife, but present her with the whole Suit, as Doublet, Breeches, and
Cloak, and all the Appurtenances thereunto, and leave himself only his Sword
to protect her. It is more honor for a Man to be led Captive by a Woman, than
to contend by resistance; for a Man can receive no dishonor to be taken
Prisoner by the Effeminat Sex; for where a Gallant Man strives to beat off
other Shackles, with Courage to overpower it, yet he willingly yields to the
Effeminat Bands, and takes them as Wreaths of Flowers, rather than Chains of
Slavery. But the pure true Gentry comes from Merit, from whence proceeds all
Noble and Heroic Actions.

Of Women.
SOme it their Praises of Women, say, they never speak but their words are too
many in number for the weight of the sense; besides, the ground of their
Discourse is impertinent, as Enquiries, who dined, and who supped at such a
Table; what Looks, Words, and Actions, past amongst the Company; what Addresses
such a Man made to such a Woman, and what Encouragement they received in their
Courtships; then, who was at Court, who at Church; or slandering, or defaming
one another; or bragging of themselves, what Clothes they have, or will have,
what Coaches, or Lacqueys, what Love servants they have, or may have; what Men
are like to dye for Love of them; what Feast they made for such a Company, who
took them out to dance at such a Ball, who ushered them out of Church, and who
they saw there, and not what they heard there; and for their Pastimes, say,
they are seldom at home, unless it be to receive Visits. Neither are they
pleased with the Company of their own Sex; for if there be no Man amongst them,
they are very dull, and as mute as one would wish; unless it be at a
Gossipping, where a Cup of good Liquor runs about: But if a Man be amongst
them, of what Condition soever, but especially a vain Young Man, then their
Pipes are set to the highest note, and with such ridiculous Laughter, as they
seem neither to stand, or sit still; or they are dancing, playing, and toying
with every thing: But in their grave Discourse they set their Countenance, and
twinkle with their Eyes; and contract their Mouth in a round Compass, and speak
their Words finely, and they that are not Handsome, as few Women think but that
they are; Or if they be in Years, they strive to be thought Wits, and all their
Discourse is of Love, justifying Loving Friendships by the Conversation of
Souls. Some of the Graver sort run into State Affairs, and pretend to be
Politics thereof: Others pretend to be learned in Divinity, and talk of
Predestination, and Free Will, and Transubstantiation, and the like; and others
pretend to Devotion, repeating of Scriptures, when, say they, the Thoughts, are
Amorously affected, as those who discourse wildly: Therefore, say they, it is
no marvel if the Men be so prevalent in their Amorous Assaults, since the Women
do so easily yield; nay, say they, they do more than yield, for they invite the
Enemy to betray themselves. But these censuring Persons judge too rigorously,
for the Faults of a few ought not to brand and condemn the whole Sex; for
surely there are numbers of worthy and honorable Women, in not only seeming
Chaste, but being Chaste; and know their Countenance must be modest, their
Behavior grave, their Discourse rather enclining to Silence than to Talk,
Courteous, but not Familiar; their state must be rather above their Quality than
beneath it, rather Proud than Humble, for too much Humility breeds Contempt.
Besides, there are those that are Patient, Pious, Trusty, Tractable to Virtue,
Thristy, Fashionable, Constant, both Maids and Wives.

Of Bawds.
BAwds do, like the Indians, that pick out the fairest and best shaped of their
Prisoners that they take in the Wars, feeding them fat like Beasts, to offer to
their Gods as Sacrifice; So Bawds choose the youngest and fairest Women, and
cherish them with the choycest and best kind of Diet, to fatten them, that they
may be in good plight; and likewise garnishing them forth with rich Clothes,
like sacrificing Garlands, that they may be more acceptable to their Gods,
which are Whoremasters, that their Reward may be more; And many times they are
brought to the slaughter of Honor, and Honesty, with Music, and Minstrels, as
the others are to the Altars; and the Fire of Lust destroys the one, as the
Vestal Fire does the other: so that Bawds are the Priests that sacrifice
Chastity, Honesty, and Honor; and they preach Flattery, to persuade and delude
their Flock; the Text is Variety, and the Application Pleasure; their God is
Cupid, and their Goddess Venus, to whom they direct their Prayers; the Pope, or
Head of their Church, is Mammon, the God of Money.

Of the Dissembling of Women.
ALL Women are a kind of Mountebanks; for they would make the World believe
they are better than they are; and they do all they can to draw Company; and
their Allurements is their Dressing, Singing, Dancing, Painting, and the like;
and when Men are caught, they laugh to see what Fools they were, to be taken
with such Toys: for Women's ends are only to make Men profess, and protest,
lie and forswear themselves in the admiration of them; for a Woman's only
delight is to be flattered of Men; for they care not whether they love truly,
or speak falsely, so they profess earnestly.

Of Chastity.
THose Women that are Covetous of Gain, or Ambitious of Titles of Honor, or
Amorous of Nature, or have been bred by ill Examples, are easily persuaded to
loose and unchaste Actions; But those Women that consider the Worth and Honor
that Chastity brings to themselves, and their Families, are never corrupted;
for they account it more Honor to dye a Martyr to Chastity, than to be Empress
of the whole World by Wantonness: But Nature gives a Chaste Mind, and a Virtuous
Education, an Honest Life; But Women that are Incontinent are the most foulest
and falsest Creatures of all Natures Works; But those that are Continent, are
like what we imagine the nature of Angels to be, that is, Incorruptible.

The Liberty of Women.
IN some Nations, Women have much more Liberty than in others; As for example,
France, England, the seventeen Provinces, Germany, and others, have more
Freedom than Turkey, Italy, Spain; not that those Nations are less sensible of
the honor of Constancy in that Sex than the others, but that they are more
confident of their Virtue and Chastity; Or else, wisely considering, Restraint
is but a Whetstone to Appetite; For most Travelers confirm, that those
Countries that have most Restraint, have least Chastity. The Lacedaemonians may
be an Example, who gave leave by their Laws, that any Man of their Nation might
enjoy any Woman he fancyed; and not only so, but the Young Women and Men
danced uncloathed in public Theaters; yet so Modest and Chaste they were, that
for many hundred years there was hardly known an Adultery committed. So that it
is neither the freedom of Choice, or Fashion, or Bodies, that infect one
another, but the Mind, which is disorderly educated: For Nature would be Chaste,
if Education were Honest, which is, to instruct Youth with Noble Principles,
and Profitable Rules, and to let them know how beneficial and necessary Justice
and Propriety is to the orderly Life of Man; and so to breed them with Sense
and Reason, Knowledge and Understanding, or else Liberty is dangerous,
especially amongst the Effeminat Sex, if they be not balanced with wise
Admonitions, to make them swim steady and even through the World, that the
over-large Sails of Ambition may not overturn them, nor the Whirlwind of Evil
Persuasions may not swallow them, nor to be lost in the dark Nights of
Ignorance: but let the bright Star of Knowledge light them, and the Needle of
Understanding direct them. But the greatest Storms that shipwreck honest
Education, is Civil Wars; for Civil Wars corrupt good Manners, especially Women
that are Self admirers, which makes them believe their own Praises, and yield
to Flattery, the Murderer of Chastity; for Insinuating Deceit is most
powerful in Civil Diffention, both in Private Families, and Public
Commonwealths.

Of Courtships.
IT is a sign a Lover grows weary of his Mistress, when he begins to give her
good and virtuous Counsel; as if a Man, that has had enough of his Mistress,
should persuade her to go into a Nunnery; and to go into a Nunnery, when a
Woman is Old, is like those that go into an Hospital, when they are ready to
fall in pieces with the Pox; for to be Old is the Pox of Time, as the other is
the Pox of the Bones, for they are both full of Pain, and decay of Nature; for
Time and Disorder works the same effects; for as Time wears out the Body, so
Disorder tears out the Body.

Of Adulteries.
IN Marriage it is far worse, and more Inconveniences come by the disobedience
of the Wife, and her Adulteries, than the Husband. For first, she dishonours
her self, insomuch as her Company is an Aspersion to all honest Women that
frequent therein, which makes the Chaste to shun her Society. Next, she is a
dishonor to the Family from whence she sprung, and makes the World suspect the
Chastity of her Mother; for there is an old saying, Cat will after kind: thus
we see that the World is apt to judge from the Original. The third dishonor is
to their Children; for were they never so Beautiful, and Virtuous, yet
Families of Honor refuse to match with them, unless they bring great advantage
by their Wealth; and then none will receive them into their Stock, but those
whom Poverty has eaten up; for the disgrace is like the Leprosy, never to be
cured; and it infects the whole Posterity, and it gives Spots to the Family it
is joined with. The fourth and last dishonor is to the Husband; for let a
Husband of a dishonest Wife be never so worthy a Man, yet her Follyes shall
lessen the Esteem of his Merits to the generality of the World; Although he
have a great Valor, a flowing Generosity, a sound Judgment, a fine Wit, and
an honest Mind; well bred, Beautiful, Rich, Honorable, yet the vulgar part of
the World will point at him, as a Fool, a Coward; and all they can think to be
bad in a Man; nay those excellent Virtues of Nature and Education, shall be
dimmed, and lose their Gloss even to the Wife, although it be unjust to
mis-prize one for the fault of the other: Yet such is the nature of the World,
as they will censure by what they can mistrust, as well as that they can
assuredly know, and think that some Defects undivulged lie hid, which makes her
prefer another in her Affections before him; and any thing that is despised,
seems poor and inferior at the first blush, unless they meet with them that
value things as they are, and not as they seem, which few do; for the most part
of the World regard more the outside than the inside, and are carried away more
by the show than the substance; which makes so many mistake, that they despise
what they should admire, and love what they should hate, and hate what they
should love. This is the reason that Gallant, Worthy, and Wise Men are
dishonored by their dishonest Wives. Besides the Dishonor, the
Inconveniences are many; First, it abolisheth all lawful and right
Inheritance; for the Child that is born in Wedlock, although begot by another
Man, shall inherit the Husbands Estate, although it be known to be another
Man's, by our Laws. Next, for the abuses of Industry; as for the profit and pain
of his Labor to go to a Stranger. Thirdly, for the weakening of Natural
Affection; for a Man that mistrusts that all are not his own, makes him not
love any, because he cannot guess which are his; rather, he hates all, for
fear he should love him that brings him Dishonor, and Discontent; or at least
set the Parents upon the Wrack, with Fear and Grief, as afraid to mistake their
own, and grieve that their own may have too little Affection from them. Thence
it takes away the tenderness of Affection from the Parents, and neglects and
rigor to their Children; it makes disobedience from Children to their Parents,
for the disgrace and wrong they receive; so that Suspicion is become the Master
of the House, and Shame the Mistress, Unthankfulness the Steward, and nothing is
entertained but Discontents.

Adulteries of Men.
THE like Dishonor and Inconvenience comes not by Adultery of the Husband, as
the Wife; for the Children receive no dishonor by the Fathers Liberty, nor the
Wife very much; for the worst that can be thought, is, that she is not so
pleasing to her Husband, either in her Person, or in her Humor. Nay, it begets
rather a greater Luster to her Merits, and sets off her Virtues more to her
Advantage; as, to show her Fortitude in Patience, her Constancy in Chastity,
her Love in her Obedience; which the World taking notice of, pities her hard
Fortune in an unkind Husband; and Pity proceeds rather from Love than Scorn,
and gives the Dishonor to the Husband for his Inconstancies, and not a
Disgrace to the Wife in being forsaken; if she have an approved Virtue, knowing
it is Facility in being subject to change, not her want of Merit, but the
Inconveniences that come thereon; it is ruin to a Man's Estate, for Concubines
are chargeable, for Women are won oftener by Gifts, than for pure Affection: For
though Affection sueth often, it speeds but seldom, when Gifts commonly
prevail; and besides, Charges is multiplied by their increase, the next is apt
to corrupt Noble Natures, by the practice of Dissembling, and Flattery of the
Enamoured, to grow False and Deceitful to all other, for Custom is a Second
Nature: Then this Amorous Love hinders all Business, and Affairs of the World;
so that it is not only wasting his present Estate, but makes him incapable of
raising another; for although all Lovers are most Ingenious and Industrious to
obtain their Beloved, yet to all other things of the World they are as dead.
Next, as he is unprofitable for himself, so he is not profitable for the
Commonwealth; for he that has his Mind full of Women, can have no room for any
thing else; besides, his Heart is in his Mistrisses Breast: This kind of Love
effeminates and degrades a Man of his Valor to all, but for his Mistrisses
Love, witness Mark Anthony. I mean not all those that are affected to Women;
for Moderate Love gives an Edge to Valor: but those that are swallowed up, and
become wholly Lovers to be precise in Cupid's Temple, and are always praying
to their Mistress their Deity: but their Goddess does not always hear their
Prayers, which makes them go home to their Melancholy Wives.

Of Jealousy.
Jealousy in the Married Estate, is the Curse of Mankind, it makes a
Confusion; and where there is Jealousy, there can be no Union: but it is not
only the Inconstant Life that makes Jealousies, but the Indiscretion betwixt a
Married Pair; for Indiscretion will raise up such Jealousies, although the
Husband and Wife be very honest, and true to the Wedlock Bed, as many times
causes a Divorce, or at least such a Disquietness, as to make Home unpleasant:
But where the Marriage is so fortunate, as their Humors agree, it is the
happyest and the sweetest Life; they lessen one another Grief, and increase
one another Joy; the very Noise of their Children is Music to their Ears;
Industry and Labor is a Recreation; to increase their Store is their
Happiness; their House is their Heaven, and in Society are as Gods, to live in
Peace.

Husbands are Nurses.
ALL Married Men are but Nurses; for all Nurses tend Children, in taking care
they should not fall and hurt themselves, and to feed and cloth them, and to
teach them to go, and to guard them from harm: So Husbands provide for their
Wives maintenance by their Industry, guard them and protect them by their
Valor, instruct and teach them by their Wisdom, lest they should fall into
Indiscretions: But Marriage most commonly knocks all quick Spirits on the Head,
and buries all Wit and Mirth, giving Life only to Care and Trouble.

To Cry on ones Wedding Day.
CRying on ones Wedding Day is like a King that begins his Reign in Blood; and
although he may prove full of Clemency, yet it is a sign he will be a Tyrant
all his Reign after: So Women may be happy after Bridal Tears, yet it
prognosticates but a Cloudy Life.

Of Marriage.
THE Cause why there be so many Unhappy Marriages, is in the unequal Matches;
and the fault is in the Parents not breeding their Children according to their
Quality, or Estates; for some, their Breeding is too high for their Estates,
and others too low for their Estates, and Qualities, and Degrees; For some,
though they have great Estates, yet will bring up their Children in Dirt and
Rags, and Keep them short of Means, and so much under their Power, as when they
come to be Masters of an Estate, and Family, and not knowing before the use of
Goods and Liberty, they become Prodigal Spendthrifts, and Inconstant Husbands,
in not being acquainted enough with the Vanities of the World, to despise them
for the World; and Vanities, the more they be known, the less they are admired,
loved, or regarded. Others again, that are of a high Degree, and having low
Fortunes, think to humble their Children by their breeding, to make their Minds
agree with their Fortunes, and leave them to the Conversation of mean and
mechanic People, as Servants, and the like; whereby they can learn nothing
that is Noble, and Honorable, but Sharking, Swearing, Drinking, Lying, rude in
their Behavior, russ in their Conversation, mean in their Practices; when most
commonly the Son marries the Chambermaid, and the Daughter the Serving man,
not knowing the difference of better Company: but finding their Error
afterward, it most commonly makes them Unhappy all the rest of their Lives,
and repining at the Advantages that they thought hey had lost, and might have
had; for Time brings Consideration, and Consideration many times Repentance, to
think with themselves how they might have advanced their Estates by their
Marriages, and what Inequality there is in their Births, making them despise
their Choice; so as they run into two extremes; the First, in being over-fond,
in marrying so soon, and unequally, and after, having so much, as they regard
nothing, or please themselves with any thing that is at home, so as they seek
what is to be found abroad to divert their Discontentments, and so become
Wanderers, thinking thereby to shun or cast off their former Follyes; which the
more they look back on, the ostner they repent of. Others again, through
Carelessness, make their Children fall into the same Errors, not instructing
them with Noble and Honorable Principles, but suffering them to run about into
every Dirty Office, where the young Master must learn to drink and play at
Cards with the Kitchin-Boy, and learn to kiss his Mothers Dirty Maid for a Mess
of Cream. The Daughters are danced upon the Knec of every Clown and Serving
Man, and hear them talk scurrilous to their Maids, which is their Complement of
Wooing; and then dancing SellingersRound with them in Christmas time, and many
other such things, which makes them become like unto like; and their Parents
think no harm in it, because they are young: And some say by ill example; For
when Children see their Parents to do not well, and disagree, they think it
Warrant enough for them to do the same. And others breed their Children at that
high rate, that it ruins their Estates, or at least hinders the increase so, as
by their Decay', or not raising their Estate, they cannot match them so high as
their Breeding requires; which makes them to leave them with Low Fortunes, and
High Minds, which can never agree. Neither will they own any thing that is not
above them, but despise even that which is equal to them in every thing, unless
their Breeding be not so, Or where there is a despising or scorning between Man
and Wife, there will be always a Neglect, and a Disagreement: yet of the two,
there comes less Inconveniency in the High Breeding than in the Low and Mean;
for the first, though it breeds Pride, yet it shuts out Baseness, and begets
Noble Thoughts, and Honorable Qualities; and the other begets mean Thoughts,
base Qualities, and disordered and foolish Passions and Affections: and
whatsoever is rooted in the young and tender years, is seldom stubbed up with
Age; but if it be, it is with great Difficulty and Labor. So that Children,
according to their Estates, Conditions, and Degrees, must be bred with Plenty
without Prodigality; with Respect, not with a Neglect, nor too much Observance;
their Discourse to them Wise and Solid, not Idle and Foolish; their Recreations
Seasonable and Suitable, not Extravagant and Wild; they must rather Animate
their Spirits than Deject them, and not to fill them with too much Art, for
fear of spoiling their Natural Parts.

Of Marriage.
MEN have three several Strings to tie the Knot of Marriage; first, Conscience,
or Religion; next, Nature; the third, Gratitude.

First, There is no Religion in the World that makes not Marriage Sacred; and
in Christian Religion they are a Consecrated Pair, wherein they are commanded
to leave all others, and live together, and love each other; and for Nature,
there is no such relation betwixt any of her Works, as to make a perfect
Friendship, as between Man and Wife; all other Friendships are as it were
Forced, or Artificial, and not Natural; for Man and Wife are like one Root, or
Body, that whatsoever touches the one, is truly sensible to the other; nay, so
as it is the same Joy and Grief. Then for Gratitude, the Man ought to love his
Wife, not because she is as his Servant, in being Overseer in the Household
affairs, or in nursing up his Children, and the Care and Fear of them, or in
being sick or ill in the breeding of them: but the Horrid Pain in bringing them
forth into the World, and the Danger they pass through, which is more hazardous
to every particular Woman, than to every particular Man in Battle. Then for the
Weal public, which is as the great Wheel in a Clock, so every private Family
is as the little Wheel for the Wealpublick; if a Man and his Wife disagree,
which is want of Affection, then their Children, when they are grown up, begin
to grow Factious, some siding with the Mother against the Father, and others
with the Father against the Mother; which Custom will make them grow Factious
in the Weal-publick, as well as in the Weal-private.

Of Marriages.
THose Marriages are commonly more happy, which are made out of Interest, than
those that marry for Fancy; for Interest is like Brass which is engraven, and
Fancy is like printed Wax; the first never alters except it be broke by ill
fortune, when the other is destroyed with a warm breath. But those that marry
below their Quality, give Respect and Reputation to those they marry, but take
it from themselves.

Of Married Wifes.
A Woman ought to please her Husband to the uttermost of her power, as to
humor all his honest Delights, not only in Actions beseeming her Sex, but
those are forbidden Women by the Laws of Modesty, and ought to be strictly kept
at all times of their lives, but when they serve to maintain their Husbands
Affection, and keeping their Husbands Affection from running to others
unlawfully, from whence proceeds not only a Disturbance in their Families, and
a Ruin of their Estates, bat a Disturbance and Ruin to many Families by
Adulteries, which Adulteries cause Jealousies, Jealousies make Malice, Malice
Revenge, Revenge Murder; so to avoid these, a Woman may Game, Fence, Ride,
Vaut, Run, Wrestle, Leap, Swim, or any the like Actions, which are only
accounted Actions fit for Men, if their Husbands should take Delight in them,
to have them Companions in all their Exercises, and Pastimes. But it is Time
and Occasion that makes most things Good or Bad: For example, it were a horrid
thing, and against Nature, and all Civil Laws, for Children and Parents,
Brethren and Neighbors, and Acquaintance, to kill one another, although their
Offenses to each other were very heinous; but when the King of chief Magistrate
in a Commonwealth commands it, as they do to those that are of their side in a
Civil War, then it is not only Warrantable, but it is accounted Sacred and
Divine; because nothing pleases Divinity more than obedience to Magistrates,
and Nature loves Peace, although she has made all things to War upon one
another; so that Custom and the Law make the same thing Civil or Pious, Just
or Unjust.

Of a second Wife.
IT is to be observed, that when a second Wife comes into a Family, all the
former Children, or old Servants, are apt to be Factious, and do foment
Suspicions against her, making ill Constructions of all her Actions; were they
never so well, and innocently meant, yet they shall be ill taken, and all that
they hinder her of, although it do them no good, but what is gotten from her,
they think themselves enriched, not so much by what they get, but by what she
loses, or has not.

Civility from Men due to Women.
COmplements from Men to Women are as a Tribute due to Womenkind; for Women,
fearing they should not be so Nobel Creatures as Men, are apt to be out of
Countenance, as mistrusting some Imperfectness in themselves; wherefore Men of
Noble Natures are willing to help the Weak, and therefore ought to give our Sex
Confidence by their Praises, and therefore should be civil to Women, in having
as tender a Regard to them as to Children; for though Women be not so Innocent,
yet they are as Powerless; and it is the part of a Noble Heroic Nature to
strive to oblige the Weak; and it is better to be used with Cruelty than Scorn,
or a rude Kindness.

The Ridiculous Malice amongst Mankind.
SO Ridiculously Foolish, or so Maliciously Envious is Mankind, as one would
think Nature was either Defective, or else full of Malignity, when she made
him. As for example, If a Man love his Wife with a clear and constant
Affection, rejecting the Amorous Allurements of other Women for her sake,
finding all in his Wife that he can wish, or at least desires no more than what
he enjoys, and is best pleased to live a life of quiet at home, ruling his
Family with Love and Obedience, thinking it more wise to enjoy the World thus,
than to trouble himself with those Affairs of the World which neither bring him
Ease, Peace, nor Profit; but if he must act several parts upon the Stage of the
World, to which he is forced either by Honor or Necessity, not by Choice, this
Man shall be thought either an Uxorious Man, or a Fool, or a Madman, either to
give himself over to various and voluptuous Delights, or to deliver up not
only his Person and Estate, but his Reason and Liberty, to the humors and
will of his Wife; As if a Man when he gives his Child a Hobbyhorse, because he
lets his Child do so and so in many like Causes, and if the Child desire to go
abroad, the Father desires to please his Child, when it hinders not more potent
Affairs; thus if he does not cross his Child in every thing, but is well
content to please and humor him in harmless things, he is thought too fond and
indulgent a Father to his Child: just so is a Husband condemned if he humors
and pleases his Wife in letting her have her will in honest, and not in
dishonorable Recreations. But what Gallant Man will not favor the Female Sex?
nay, what Gallant Man will not condescend to all their Desires, and seek and
invent ways to please them, so far as Honor will give them leave? And shall a
Man despise, and cross, and neglect his Wife because she is his own, lawfully
joined and united? Shall it be more Dishonor for a Man to love his Wife, than
another Man's Wife? Shall a Man be accounted a Fool because he is honest to
Wedlock? because he is kind to his own Wife? Was Augustus Caesar less Wife
because he loved? or Pompey less Valiant because he loved? Solomon may be said
to be less Pious toward God through the great Love he bore to Pharoah's
Daughter, which was his first, and dearly beloved Wife, yet he was not less
Wise in respect of the World. But Men seek for that abroad, whereof they have
better at home, and the unsatiable Desire of Mankind makes them search for what
is never to be found: But where Nature gives a Satisfactory Mind, she gives a
Happy Life; and what can we imagine the Joys of Heaven, but a stint to our
wandering Desires; therefore those that are most fixed, are nearer Heaven; and he
is the Wisest, that is nearest to Unity; and those that are most united, are
likest to a God.

But where Discord happens, Hell is resemb'ed, and harsh, haughty, and not
insulting Natures, are composed like Devils; and Caesar showed himself a Fool
in nothing but in quitting his Guard, and not harkening to his Wife, which was
to show his Courage, and to let the World see he durst go unarmed, singly alone
as it were, and his freedom from the chains of fond Affection; thus quitting
Prudence and Love, he dyed too violent a Death. And Seianus quitting the
Affection toward his Wife, and placing it upon Julian, raised such a Jealousy
in Tyberius, as it cost him his Life, otherwise he might have ruled the Empire,
and so the most part of the World. Thus Anthony's leaving his Wife for the love
of Cleopatra, lost him the third part of the World. Neither are the Counsels of
a Wife always to be despised, if all were honest, nor to be locked from the
private Affairs of her Husband; Portia was able to keep a Secret, and was of
Brutus her Husbands Confedenacy, though not Actually, yet Concealing; And if
Caesar had condescended to his Wives Persuasion, he had not gone to the Senate
that day; and who knows but the next might have discovered the Conspiracy? and
numberless of the like Examples might be given. Besides, it is to be observed,
where the Husband and Wife disagree, their Family is in disorder, their Estates
go to decay, Jealousies arise, which cause Discords, from whence proceeds a
discontented and unhappy Life; And where the Husband and Wife are united in
Minds, as well as in Body. all prospers; and most commonly Ease and Plenty
crown that Family, Industry is their Recreation, Peace is their Joy, Love is
their Happiness: for a kind Husband makes an obedient Wife, dutiful Children,
faithful Servants; for a Wise Man rules his Family with gentle, kind, and
seasonable Persuasions, with honest and sincere Actions, with grateful and
just Rewards; and Kindness, and Constant Natures, work hard and obeisant
Natures to be more pliant and facile; for Kindness melts hardest Hearts, and
makes them flexible to form them as they please; where Cruelty or Severity
hardens them so much, as they will rather break than bend. And if the Rational
part of the World would but consider what Felicity there is in peaceful
Prosperity, they would never wander so much out of the way.

Of Men and Women.
SOme say a Man is a Nobler Creature than a Woman, because our Savior took
upon him the Body of Man; and another, that Man was made first: But these two
Reasons are weak; for the Holy Spirit took upon him the shape of a Dove, which
Creature is of less esteem than Mankind; and for the Preheminency in Creation,
the Devil was made before Man.

Nature in the Composure of Men and Women.
IT is not so great a Fault in Nature for a Woman to be Masculine, as for a Man
to be Effeminat: for it is a Defect in Nature to decline, as to see Men like
Women; but to see a Masculine Woman, is but only as if Nature had mistook, and
had placed a Man's Spirit in a Woman's Body; but Nature has both her Mistakes
and Weaknesses; but when she works perfectly, she gives Man a gentle and sweet
Disposition, a generous Mind, a valiant Heart, a wife Head, a voluble Tongue, a
healthful Body, and strong and active Limbs: To Woman she gives a chaste Mind,
a sober Disposition, a silent Tongue, a fair and modest Face, a neat Shape, and
a graceful Motion.

The Nature of Man.
MAN is more apt to take Dislikes at all things, than to delight in any thing;
but Nature has given us no Pleasure, but what ends in Pain; for the end of
Pleasure is Grief: for Cruel Nature curbs us in with Fear, and yet spurs us on
with Desires; for she has made Man's mind to hunt more after Varieties by
Desire, than she has made Varieties to satisfy the Desires.

Of Painting.
THere be some that condemn the Art of Painting in Women, others that defend
it; for, say they, as Nature has made one World, so Art another, and that Art
is become the Mistress of Nature; neither is it against Nature to help the
Defects. Besides, those that find out new Arts, are esteemed so, that they
become as Petty Gods, whether they become Advantageous to Man, or no; as the
Memory of those that found out the Art of Gunpowder, Guns, Swords, and all
Engines of War for Mischief; and shall they be more praised and commended than
those that find out Arts and Adornments; as Painting, Curling, and other
Dressings; for the one destroys Mankind, this increases it; the one brings
Love, the other begets Hate. But some will say, those Arts defend their Lives;
but where they once use them to defend their Lives, they use them ten times to
destroy Life; and though it is no Fault in the Inventer, but in the User, no
more is Painting, when it is used for a good intent, as to keep or increase
lawful Affection. But, say they, it is a dissembling to make that appear
otherwise than it is. 'Tisanswer'd, No more than to keep warm in Winter; for
Cold is Natural, so is the sense of it in Winter; but Clothes to keep it out
are Artificial; and the true use of the Art of Painting is to keep warm a
Lawful Affection. Besides, If we must use no more than what Nature has given
us, we must go naked; and those that have a bald Head, must not wear a Peruick,
or Cap to cover it; and those that are born with one Leg shorter than the
other, must not wear a high Shoe to make them even, nor indeed wear any Shoes
at all, especially with Heels, because they make them seem higher, but go with
the Feet bare; and those that are Crooked, must wear no Bombast; and many such
Examples may be brought. But, say some, it is a Bawd to entice, in begetting
evil Desires. It is answered, No more a Bawd than Nature is in making a
handsome Creature; but if they must do nothing for fear of Enticing, then
Mankind must neither cut their Hair, nor pare their Nails, nor shave their
Beards, nor wash their selves, which would be very slovenly, for fear they
should appear so handsome, as they may persuade and entice the Lookers on to
evil Desires; which if so, let them be like Swine, and wallow in Mire; but it
is to be feared, that the Mire will be too hard for the evil Desires; so as
there may be more brought in defense of Painting, than can be said against it.
Wherefore, say they, it is lawful both in Maids and Wives; the one, to get a
good Husband; the other, to keep her Husband from coveting his Neighbors Wife;
for it is an Honor for Maids to get good Husbands, because it is a kind of
Reproach to live unmarried, for Marriage is Honorable, and gives a Respect to
Women, unless they be incloystered, which all Constitutions will not agree
withal; and an honest Wifes care is to please her Husband, if she can, when
she has him; for Marriage is the end of an honest Mind to all but Widows, for
they, when they marry again, do as it were Cuckold their dead Husband, and
their living. Besides, if they have Children, they make a Distraction and
Division in their Families, and most commonly to the ruin of the first
Husbands Estate, having so great a share, and so much power, according to our
Laws; And though they should not marther themselves, as the Custom has been
in other Countries, but contrary rather, to preserve their Health, and to dry
their Eyes after a while of those Obsequies of Tears, which are Sacrifices to
the Dead, yet to live a retired Life, to show their unalterable Affections; for
though it be fit for a Widow to put off her violent Passion of Sorrow as well
as she can, yet there is no Humor becomes that Condition better than Sadness;
for Sadness, which is a moderate Grief, looks full of Fortitude, and is Humble,
Modest, Graceful, and so far from dis composing any part, as it gives a
settled, and majestical Face: So Painting is most disallowable in Widows, for
they should take the example of Judith, where it is said, when she went to
Holofernes, she anointed her self as she did usually in her Husband Manassas
time, which it seems she used not after he was dead, before this time; for as
they have none to Displease, so ought they not to Allure. But some will say,
that their Poverty is such, as they know not how to live, and they may be
presented to such a Fortune, as may make them live happy, and free from the
Misery that Poverty compels them to. It is answered, that Nature is satisfied
with a little, if their Ambition be not great: but if not they must make use of
the old Proverb, which is, that Necessity has no Law, in case they present not
their Necessity to be greater than it is. But to return to Beauty, it is
pleasing, either Natural or Artificial, and both to be admired; for if Art be
Commendable, why not in the Face, as well as in the Feet in dancing Measures,
or as in the Hand upon Music Instruments, or in the Voice, or in the Art of
Oratory, and Poetry, which will sooner increase Desires: yet this is allowed of
in all places and times, not only in Temporal Society, but in Spiritual
Unions, where David, the Beloved of God, was a great Master in the Knowledge
and Practice of them. And if these Arts be Commendable, and are Graces to all
parts of the Body, shall it be condemned only for Color in the Face? And as
Beauty is the Adornment of Nature, so is Art the Adornment of Beauty; and this
says the Defendant against the Plaintiff. But all Opinions have, or most of
them, Sides, and Factions; but my Opinion is so far with the Defendant, as I
believe all Adotnments of Beauty are lawful for Women, if the Intention be
good. Yet I am utterly against the Art of Painting, out of three respects; The
first is Dangerous, for most Paintings are mixed with Mercury, wherein is much
Quicksilver, which is of so subtle a malignant nature, as it will fall from the
Head to the Lungs, and cause Consumptions, and is the Cause of swelling about
the Neck and Throat. The next is, that it is so far from Adorning, as it
Dis-figures: for it will rot the Teeth, dim the Eyes, and take away both the
Life and Youth of a Face, which is the grea'est Beauty. Thirdly and lastly, the
Sluttishness of it, and especially in the Preparatives, as Masks of
Sear-Clothes, which are not only horrid to look upon, in that they seem as
Dead Bodies embowelled or embalmed, but the Stink is Offensive. Then the
Pomatum and Pultis, which are very uneasy to lie in, wet and greasy, and very
unsavory; for all the while they have it on, it presents to their Nose a
Chandlers Shop, or a greasy Dripping-pan, so as all the time they fry as it
were in Grease; neither will their Perfumes mend it, and their Oils: And though
I cannot say they live in Purgatory, because they shun all hot places, for they
cannot have the comfortable heat of the Fire, and shun the Natural heat of the
Sun, as they must live always, as if they were at the North Pole, for fear the
Heat should melt away their Oil, and Oily Drops can be no grace to their Face,
Dry Painting shrivels up the Skin so, as it imprints Age in their Face, in
filling it full of Wrinkles; wherefore Paintings are both Dangerous,
Ill-favored, and Sluttish, besides the troublesome pains. But for other
Adornments in Women, they are to be commended, as Curling, Powdring, Powncing.
Clothing, and all the Varieties of Accoutrement, in that they have none of the
said former Qualities, but give a graceful advantage to the Person. Besides,
Dressing is the Poetry of Women, in showing the Fancyes, and is the cause of
employing the greater part of a Commonwealth; for in four parts, three of them
are in the Arts of Adornments; for it is not only, Tailers, Imbroyderers,
Perfumers, Milleners, Feathermakers, Jewellers, Mercers, Silkmen, Semsters,
Shoemakers, Tiremen, and many, many more, but every one of these Trades have
many Trades belong to them; as for example, How many Trades belong from the
Silkworm to the Ladies Gown? and from the Golden Mine to the Lace that is laid
upon it? and so in order to all other things, which is the cause of keeping a
Commonwealth in Union, in busying and employing their Minds, which keeps them
from Factious Thoughts, and Designs. Besides, it distributes and spreads the
Maintenance of the Kingdom; for without particular Commerce, and Trasick, a
Commonwealth cannot stand, and subsist: for though many a Commonwealth may
subsist without the help of their Neighbors, yet it cannot live without their
own Employment and Dividement among themselves: for as some share in Lands, so
others in Offices, and the rest in Trades, wherein all trasick, from the one to
the other; so that every Man lives by his Neighbor, and not altogether upon
himself.

Of Paleness, and Blushing.
WHen a sudden Paleness seizes the Face, it shows a Guiltiness, or some great
Fear; but a Blush will come into the Face many times, when there is no occasion
to raise it; for it oftener proceeds from the Constitution of the Body, than
from a Guiltiness of the Mind; for when the Blood is thin, and the Spirits are
hot, they are apt to run up to the Face without the Minds consent or knowledge;
but when Blushing is raised by the Mind, it is commonly from a Noble Suspicion,
that is the Mind, which would not have an evil Construction, where it deserves
naught but a good Opinion. But it is better to be Bashful to Particulars, and
Confident to the World, than Confident to Particulars, and Bashful to the
World; for it is a sign they are afraid to hear of themselves, though not to
show their Persons, which seems as if their Actions should bring a Scandal to
their Reputation; yet a Bashfulness does so obstruct the sense, as they cannot
deliver any thing perfect to their Understandings, but seem like Changelings,
or Fools, although they have great Wits.

Of Boldness and Bashfulness
THE most of Mankind are either too bold or too bashful; either so bold that
they seem rude, or so bashful that they seem simple: As for Boldness, it is
worse in respect to others, but better in respect to themselves; And
Bashfullness is better in respect to others, but worse in respect to
themselves; for Bashfullness is allwaies humble and civil to others, but
fearful and timorous as to it self; insomuch as those that have this Virtue
Vice (as I may call it) have neither freedom nor liberty to express themselves
after their natural accustomed manner, much less in ways of advantage; for
they neither speak Sense, nor their words plain, but speak quite from the
purpose, stuttering and stamering; or else the Tongue is so tied, that they
become like those that are dumb; neither can they behave themselves well, and
are so far from a graceful Garb, that they behave themselves like Changlings
or Innocents, putting their Faces into a hundred several Countenances, and their
Bodies into as many several Postures; nay Bashfullness has such a forcible
power over the Body and Mind, as it draws and distorts the Lims and Motions of
the one, as the Disease of Convulsions does; and distempers and distracts the
other, as the Disease of Madness, in not knowing what they do; it unthrones
the Understanding, and blindfolds Judgment; and this Bashfulness proceeds from
too great an apprehension of Misdeameanours; but this Bashfullness is a Tyrant,
for it tortures the Mind upon the Rack of Imagination, and whips the Body with
the pains of Restraint, giving no freedom to the Thoughts, Words, or Actions;
it imprisons Wit, and inslaves noble Endeavors; it obscures Virtue, and dims
Beauty, it lames Behavior, it takes away the Majesty of State, and the State
of Majesty; it is affronted by the bold rude, or the mdely bold; it loses
respects from the half-witted men, and only gets pity from the Wise; But those
that are bashful are not only Judicious and Ingenious, as Witty and Wise, but
most commonly have sweet and kind Natures, noble and generous Dispositions,
valiant and courageous Spirits, honest and temperate Lives; but the pleasure of
their life is disturbed with their imaginations, and conception of the Opinions
of the World; fearing their Censures, and I mean the World of Acquaintance.
doubting their Applause. This Bashfullness proceeds from a noble Ambition, or
a pious Intention, either to get Fame, or an example to Humility; but
Bashfulnes looks as through a Perspectiveglass, searching into obscurities; when
Boldness is blindfold, either with a Muster of I gnorance, or Vainglory; it
either wants Breeding or Wit: For a poor simple Pesant, many times, has more
Confidence than a noble Lord; a rude Clown than a wellbred Gentleman; a
Market-woman than a great Lady; because they neither examine, know, nor fear the
Errors they may fall into: Again, others are so vainglorious as to think they
cannot commit faults; but this Courtly Vice, or Vice that is Courted, carries
it self with haughty behavior, and a proud demeanor, outfaces Truth, yet
shrinks at Dangers; speaks loud, but acts little; threatens much, but dares not
fight: They can receive no affronts, because they will take none; for
whatsoever is offered as an Affront, they take as a Jest, or Rallerly, or out of
an Insensibility, take all well as being meant well, or out of a Vainglory
think none dares offer it. But howsoever their behaviovr is to others, or
others to them, they are at liberty, and free in themselves, not bound with the
Chains of Bashfullness, nor manacled with the Irons of self mistrust; they have
no repinings for what they have thought they have done amiss; nor blushing
Cheeks, raised by surpitious doubts; nor tender eyed, that dare not look on an
evil Object, or objects that they may falsely think are so; when they are
innocent they know, but Boldness does outface, not only what evil might be
thought, but what evil they have done; and strange it is, yet true, Boldness
has such a power, to make great Crimes seem less than they are; and those
that are bold, more great or nobler than they are; like Masking Scenes set with
false Lights, present a City or a stately Tower, when it is nothing but
Pastboard painted over.

Of Women indifferently handsome.
WOmen are more happy in their Husbands affection when they are indifferently
handsome and various humored, than when they are more exact: for a woman that
is extreme fair is more for admiration than for a settled affection; a woman
that is constanly patient, seems senseless or simple, which makes him dislike
her; and a woman that is allwaies choleric and angry, seems a Fury; and she
that is allwaies merry, disturbs her Husband's serious Contemplation of solid
Thoughts; and she that is allwaies sad, dulls him; she that is allwaies
complaining, is never pitied; and those that are sickly, their Husbands can
find no lively contentment; for what melancholy Company are the dying? nor to
be too devout and precise; for men in this World, had rather converse
ordinarily with Mortals than with Angels. But if a Woman be healthful of
Body, plump of Flesh, not deformed, nor exactly handsome; graceful in Carriage,
without affectation; of a ready wit, and contriving Judgment; cleanly, without
curiosity; honest, without pride; careful, without choler; thrifty, without
sluttishness; and various in their Dresses, and other Humors: Such a Wife it
will not be in her Husband's power to dislike; and he will not only like her,
but extremely love her, even to Dotage; for those Qualities do violently draw
his Affections.

Wisdom and Wit are to be preferred before Riches and Beauty.
WIsdom and Wit are to be preferred before Riches or Beauty; for Wisdom knows
how to get, keep, and use Riches; neither can Beauty parallel Wisdom; for
Wisdom makes a man happy all his life, in governing his Passions, in choosing
his ways in order to his affairs, for his best advantage, not only for
himself, but for others in distress, by his Counsel; for which he is Honored,
Esteemed, Loved, and sought after, to redress the incumberd, to relieve the
distressed, to unite differences; She helps the blind, in giving Eyes of
understanding to the Ignorant. Wisdom is the Arm of strength to defend; the
watchful Eye to descry dangers; the Fingers to point and direct; the Tongue to
persuade and admonish; It is the Heart of Courage, the nourishing Liver, the
Stomach or Storehouse, the Bowels and Center, the Head and Governor of a
Commonwealth. And Wit is to be preferred before Beauty; for there is as much
difference as betwixt Soul and Body; for Wit is as it were spiritual, where
Beauty is Corporal, and Beauty is subject to the variations of several
Opinions; for Beauty is not Beauty in all Nations, but Wit is Wit in all
Languages; Beauty wearies the Eye by Repetitions, where Wit refreshes the Ear
with variety of Discourse; Wit is the God of Passion, creating and disposing
them at his pleasure.

Of Riches, and Beauty.
RIches si to be preferred before Beauty, though it be a gift of Fortune, and
Beauty a gift of Nature; for Beauty incaptives, where Riches inslaves all;
for were there a Beauty that had as much as Nature could give it, joined with
an Angelical Mind, yet it shall never triumph so long, nor inthrall so many,
nor so constantly be served, as Riches is; for Riches has no unfaithful
Lovers, although she may have ignorant Servants, whom she turns most commonly
Weeping out of doors; for she is a humorsome Mistress, and changes often, but
seldom makes a good Choice: And the Reason why Riches are preferred, esteemed,
honored, and unweariedly followed, is, because she affords more variety, which
the Nature of Man delights and seeks after; where Beauty is still one and the
same; but though Riches are fleeting, yet many times the Careful and Prudent
have possessed them long; where Beauty no sooner shows her self but dies.

The Beauty of Mean Persons.
BEauty in Mean and Poor Persons is only subject to Temptation, not to
Admiration, as Beauty in Palaces is Famous in History; but those Beauties as
come from an Humble Birth, and Breeding in a small Cottage, are buried in their
Poverty; which shows, it is not only the Beauty which Nature gives, but the
Arts that adorn it, which allures the Mind; for Good Fortune gives Beauty a
Luster, and makes it appear Divine, so does Rich Apparel, Attendance, and the
like; for it is the Trappings, and the Ceremony, which takes the Eyes of the
Beholders; whereas Ill Fortune, and Poverty, do cast a Shadow upon Natural
Beauty, and eclipse it from the Eyes of the World. Thus Beauty is admired and
divulged according to the Wealth and Dignity; unless some strange and unusual
Accident happens to the Beautiful to noise it abroad; otherwise we shall not
hear of Poor and Mean Persons mentioned in many Ages, but those which the
Fancies of Poets make; but of Beauties that were Great and Rich, their
Chronologies are full.

Of Imaginary Beauty.
SOme may imagine or think Beauty was framed and composed in the Opinions of
Men, rather than in the Lineaments, and Symmetries, and Motion of the Body, or
the Color of the Skin; for that which appears Beautiful to one Nation, does
not so to another; as witness the Indians, the Ethiopians, who think the
blackest Skin, stattest Noses, and thickest Lips, the most Beautiful, which
seem Deformed and Monstrous to the Europeans; so particular Persons, as in
several Nations; for to one Person shall appear a Beauty, to enamour the Soul
with Admiration, to another shall appear even to a Dislike; which shows, that
were there a Body never so exactly proportioned, or their Motions never so
graceful, or their Color never so Orient, yet it will not please all. I will
not say there is no such thing as Beauty, but no such Beauty as appears so to
all Eyes, because there is not Variety enough in one Beauty to please the
various Fancies of Mankind; for some fancy Black, some Brown, some Fair, some a
Sad Countenance, some a Merry, some more Bashful, some more Bold; For Stature,
some Tall, some Low, some Fat, some Lean, some Dislike some Motions, some
others; some gray Eyes, some black Eyes, some blew Eyes; and to make mixture of
all these, it is impossible; and though there may be as great and as good a
Harmony in Beauty as in Music, yet all Tunes please not all Ears, no more do
all Beauties please all Eyes.

Of Natural Beauty.
BEauty is a certain Splendour, which flows in a Line, or Air of Lights, from
the Spirits, and gives a shining Glory upon the Face; which Light, with Ill
Complexions, or not Lovely Features, is darkened, as the Sun with Clouds,
wherein some Faces have thicker Clouds than others, that make a Beauty appear
more Splendorous at some times than others. But in Age Beauty seldom or never
appears, being in the Winter season of Life; but in Youth the Air is always
Serene, and Clear. Some see this Splendour or Beauty in a Face, which others do
not, as having a more discerning Spirit, which makes some wonder at such as do
fall in Love with those that they shall think Ill-favored; besides, there is a
Sympathy of Spirits, to perceive that in one, and other, as Lookers on cannot
find out.

Of Pride.
IF Pride seems Handsome, and may be allowed in any, it is in Women, because it
gives a Distance to Idle Pretenders, and Corrupters of Chastity. Neither is it
so bad in Women to be proud of their Chastity, and Honest Affection, as
Alexander in his Victories, or Helen in her Beauty, or Rome of her Spoils, and
Royal Slaves: for Honesty is their greatest Beauty, and they may glory in it as
their greatest Honor, and triumph in it as their greatest Victory; and though
that Women are naturally Fearful, yet rather than they would infringe the
least part of a Chastity, either in Words to Inchant, or Looks to Allure, or
Actions to Invite, they would enforce Life, and Triumph in Death, rather than
their Virtue should be overcome, either in the Stratagems of Follyes, or
Treacherous Bribes, or by force of wicked Appetites. But a Woman should be so
well instructed in the Principles of Chastity, as no false Doctrine could
persuade her from it, neither Praises, nor Professions, nor Oaths, nor Vows,
nor Wealth, Dignity, nor Example, having always Temperance, and Sobriety in
Friendship.

To the same.
BUT some are bred with such Nicety, and in such Innocence, as if they meant to
marry some Deity: But Modesty should dwell in Women's Thoughts, Wit marshal
their Words, Prudence rule their Actions; they should have a Graceful
Behavior, a Modest Countenance, a Witty Discourse, a Civil Society, a Courteous
Demeanor.

Men should be Valiant in War, Temperate in Peace, Just to others, Prudent to
themselves: but Natures Extraordinary Works are not Commonly distributed.

THE EPISTLE.
THE Reason why I print most of what I write, is, because I observe, that not
only the weak Writings of men get Applause in the World, but the infinite weak
Translators of others Works; thus there are many simple Books take the World by
the Ears; but I perceive it is not the wit, or worth of what is written, that
begets a delight to the Readers, and a Fame to the Writers; but it must fit the
Genius of the Age: And truly, if we will but note it, there is as much
difference in the wit or understanding of some Ages, I mean for the generality
of men, as between some Writers and others; For some Ages are like old Nestor,
wise; others like Ulysses, eloquent; some like Achilles, valiant; others like
Paris, amorous, and effeminate; some like Hercules, striving to suppress Vice;
others like wicked Nero, that always strive to tyrannize over Virtue, making
War and Faction; some like Orpheus Harp that charms the spirits with Peace;
And as the Stars have an Influence over every particular, so they take their
turns to govern, and are predominant over every Age; But I find I live in a
Carping age; for some sind fault with my former Writings because they are not
Grammar, nor good Orthography; and that all the last words are not matched with
Rhyme; and that the Feet are not in just Numbers: As for the Orthography, the
Printer should have rectisied that; for I think it is against Nature for a
Woman to spell right, for my part I confess I cannot; and as for the Rimes and
Numbers, although it is like I have erred in many, yet not so much as by the
negligence of those that were to oversee it; for by the false printing, they
have not only done my Book wrong in that, but in many places the very Sense is
altered; as for surfets, sercutts; wanting, wanton; like slaming sire to burn,
they have printed a sire Gunn, and many other words they have left out besides,
and there is above a hundred of those faults; so that my Book is lamed by an
ill Midwife and a Nurse, the Printer and Overseer; but as for the Grammar part,
I confess I am no Scholar, and therefore understand it not, but that little I
have heard of it, is enough for me to renounce it; for if I have any wit, it is
so little that it would be lost in scholastical Rules; besides, it were worse
to be a pedantick woman, than a pedantick man; yet so ill it is in man, that it
does as is were degrade him from being Magnanimous and Heroic; for one shall
seldom sind a generous and valiant Heart, and a pedantical Brain, created or
bred in one Body; but those that are nobly bred have no Rules but Honor, and
Honesty, and learn in the School of Wisdom to understand Sense, and to express
themselves sensibly and freely, with a graceful negligence, not to be
hidebound with nice and strict words, and set Phrases, as if the Wit were
created in the Inkhorn, and not in the Brain; besides say some, should onebring
up a new way of speaking, then were the former Grammar of no effect; besides, I
do perceive no strong reason to contradict, but that every one may be his own
Grammarian, if by his natural Gramar he can make his Hearers understand his
sense; for though there must be Rules in a language to make it sociable, yet
those Rules may be strictor than need to be, and to be too strict, makes them
to be too unpleasant and uneasy But Language should be like Garments, for
though every particular Garment has a general Cut, yet their Trimmings may be
different, and not go out of the fashion; so Wit may place Words to its own
becoming, delight, and advantage, and not alter Langage nor obstruct the Sense;
for the more liberty we have of Words, the clearer is Sense delivered. As for
Wit, it is wild and fantastical, and therefore must have no set Rules; for
Rules Curb, and Shackle it, and in that Bondage it dies.

The Worlds Olio. LIB. II.
PART I.
The Vulgar Part of Mankind. Allegory.
MOST Men's Minds are Insipid, having no Balsamical Virtue therein; they are as
the Terra Damnata of Nature.

And their Brains most commonly are like Barren Grounds, which bear nothing but
Mossy Ignorance, no Flowers of Wit. The Course of their Lives are like those
that dig in a Coal-pit, their Actions as the Coals therein, by which they are
smucht and blackt with Infamy; or else their Actions are like a Sexton, which
digs a Grave to bury the Life in Oblivion.

Allegory 1.
THE Mind is like a Commonwealth, and the Thoughts as the Citizens therein; or
the Thoughts are like Housholdservants, who are busily employed about the Minds
Affairs, who is the Master.

Allegory 2.
Quick busy Thoughts suck Vapor from the Stomach to the Head, as Water through
a Straw sucked by the Mouth: But strong working Thoughts draw Vapors up, as
Water is drawn with Buckets out of a Well.

Allegory 3.
THE Brain of a man is the Globe of the Earth, and Knowledge is the Sun that
gives the light therein; Understanding is the Moon, that changes according as
it receivs light from the Sun of Knowledge; Ignorance is the Shadow that
causes an Eclipse; the four Quarters, are, Infancy, Youth, Manhood, and Age;
for Experience makes the full Moon. Or, Knowledge is the Brain, and
Understanding the Eyes of the Brain, where all eyes do not see clearly; some
are purblind, those can only perceive, but not with perfect distinctions; some
Squint, and to those all Objects seem double, like a Fanus face; some are weak,
either by Sickness or by Age, and they see all as in a Mist, thick and obscure;
some are starck blind, and they see nothing at all. Thus they that have clear
eyes of Understanding in the brain of Knowledge, have a good and solid
Judgment; the Purblinde, is to be obstinate in an Opinion, making no
distinction of Reason; a Squint, is to be doubtful, which makes double
Objects, as whether it be or be not; a weak Eye, is to have a narrow Capacity;
to be blind, is to be a very Fool.

Allegory 4.
THE World is the Ground, whereon the Mind draws and designs, with the Pencils
of Appetite, the actions of Life, mixing the Colors of several Objects
together with the Oil of Thoughts; and Dislikes are the Dark Colors which
shadow the Light of pleasures.

Allegory 5.
THE Mind is a Garden where all manner of Seeds be sown; Prosperities are the
fine painted Tulips, Innocence the white Lillies; the four Virtues are the
sweet Gilliflowers, Roses, Violets, and Prim-roses; Learning is the tastable
and savoury Herbs; Afflictions, are Rue, Wormwood, Rubarb, which are bitter to
the Taste, but yet wholesome and beneficial to the curing the sick and
distempered Soul, purging the superfluous vanity thereof, and serve as
Antidotes against Vice, as Pride, Ambition, Extortion, Covetousness, and the
like, which are Nightshade and Helebore; Poppy is Stupidity; Sloth, and
Ignorance are Weeds which serve for no use.

Allegory 6.
THE Thoughts are like Stars in the Firmament, where some are fixed, others
like the wandering Planers; others again are only like Meteors, which when their
Substance is wasted, their Light goes out; their Understanding is like the
Sun, which gives Light to all the rest of the Thoughts; Memory is like the
Moon, which has its New, its Full, and its Wain.

Allegory 7.
MAN is like the Globe of the World, and his Head as the highest Region,
wherein Knowledge, as the Sun, runs in the Ecliptic Line of Reason, and gives
light of Understanding to all the rest of the Thoughts, as the Planets which
move by degrees in their several Orbs, some slower and some faster. Ignorance
is the total Eclips; and violent Passions, as dark Clouds, that Viel the face
thereof, which is only seen by the shadows, but not in its full Glory.

Allegory 8.
THE World is a Shopp which sells all manner of Commodities to the Soul and
Senses; the price are Good Actions and Bad, for which they have Salvation, or
Damnation; Peace, or War; Pleasure, or Pain; Delight, or Grief.

Allegory 9.
THE Earth is the great Merchant of the World, trafficking The Earth is the
great Loadston to the World.
with the Sun and the rest of the Planets; whose StoreHouses are the several
Regions, from whence she fetches, in Ships of attraction, her several
Commodities, Heat, and Moisture, whereof she makes Life, and sells it to
several Creatures, who pay her Death for the same.

Allegory 10.
THE World is like the Sea, and Life and Death the flowing and ebbing thereof;
Wars are the Storms that make it rough in Billows of Faction; and the Tongues
of Men, by their loud Reports, are as the Roating thereof; but Peace is the
Calm which makes it so smooth that the face of Tranquillity is seen therein,
Prosperity is the Sun which throws its Beams of Plenty thereon; but Adversity
is as dark Clouds which hang full of Discontent, and often times fall in Showers
of Desolation and Destruction.

Of the World. Allegory 11.
THE World is like a great City, wherein is much Commerce, through which runs a
great Navigable River of Ambition, Ebbing and Flowing with Hope and Doubt;
having Barks of Self-conceit floating thereon, filled with Pride and Scorn; and
Merchants of Faction setting forth Ships of Trouble, to bring in Power and
Authority; which Ships, by the Storms of War, are often times rackt, where all
Happiness and Peace is drowned in the Waves of Misery and Discontent; but
Silver Vows, Gilded Promises, and Golden Expectations, make a glorious show,
like a Goldsmiths Shop; and though the Substance does not waste, yet it is
often melted by cross accidents, and forgetfullness, and the fashions alter
according to the Humors of the time. Hard Hearts, bold Faces, feared
Consciences, and rash Actions, are the Brass and Iron that make the Instruments
of War.

Of Fortune. Allegory 12.
FOrtune is a Mountebank, cozening and cheating Mankind, acting upon the Stage
of the World; where Prosperity plays the part of a Fool to allure the
Multitude, inticeing them to buy her Druggs of Follies and Vanities; or
Antidotes of Experience, against her poisons of Miseries; which Poisons are
many times so strong, that they kill having no remedy; but she cares not so her
Ware be sold, whether they live or dye.

A man is like a Cabinet of Toies, wherein are some false Drawers of deceit,
which none can discover to the view of the World, but Prosperity and Adversity,

The Tongue is a Key which unlocks the door of the Ears, and lets in Flattery,
as those that steal Affection from the Heart.

The Heart of a man is the Church of Controversy, and the Tongue is the
Sophisterian-Pricst, which preaches false Doctrine.

Allegory 13.
IN the Head of man was a Diet called and Wit chosen Emperor; he was an active
Prince, and so ingenious, that he had Trade and Traffic not only with every
kingdom, but he made his advantage upon every Thing; besides, he kept his
Kingdom in Peace, setting his Subjects Thoughts on work lest they should become
idle, and so grow factious for want of employment, and sometimes, to recreate
them, he makes Maskques and Plays, Balls and Songs, to which they dance upon
the feet of Numbers; but if this Emperor did chance to make War upon his
Neighbors, he never went forth himself, but sent his satirical Jests out,
which marched upon grounds of white paper, armed with black ink, and sighting
with sharp words, where most commonly they rout his Enemies with Scorn, or kill
them with Reproach, and bury them with Infamy.

Allegory 14.
THE several Brains of men are like to several Governments, or Kingdoms; the
Monarchical Brain, is, where Reason rules as sole King, and is enthroned in the
Chair of Wisdom, which keeps the Vulgar Thoughts in Peace and Obedience, not
daring to rise up in Rebellious Passions; but the Aristocratical Brain, is,
where some Few, but strong Opinions govern all the Thoughts; these Governors
most commonly are Tyrannical, executing their Authority by Obstinacy; but in
the Republike Brain there is no certain Government, nor settled Governor; for
the Power lies among the Vulgar Thoughts, who are always Placing and
Displacing; one while a vain Imagination is carried in the Chair of Ignorance,
and cried up with applause by the idle and loose Thoughts, and, in a short time
after, thrown out with Accusation and Exclamation, and afterward executed upon
the Block of Stupidity; and so Conceptions of all sorts are most commonly
served with the same sauce; and if by chance they set up Reason or Truth, they
fare no better; for the inconstant Multitude of Rude and Illiterate Thoughts
displaces them again, and offtimes executes them upon the Scaffold of
Injustice, with the sword of Falsehood.

Allegory 15.
THE Head of Man is like a Wilderness, where Thoughts, as several Creatures,
live therein, 25 Coveting Thoughs which hunt after our Appetites, which never
leave feeding until their desires are satisfied, or indeed they are glutted;
others so fearful that every Object is apt to startle them; and others so dull
and slow, like crawling Worms; others so elevated, like Birds, they fly in Aerie
Imaginations, and many above all possibility.

Allegory 16.
MAN and the World do resemble much; The Heart is like the Torrid Zone, and the
slame blazes there as the Sun which sends forth Rays through the Eyes, that
draw in Affections, where some Objects are like the gross Vapors, which gather
into Clouds of Melancholy, which darkens the resplendent lights of Joy, quashes
the natural Heat, and nourishes Humors wherewith the Health is impaired, and
the body becomes lean barren and cold; but when the Heat of the Heart
dissipates those Vapors, it either turns into windy Throbs, or Showers of
Tears, or thundering Groans; or else it rarifies into a Christalline
Tranquillity.

Allegory 17.
THE Spirit Travells in Ships of Medium, from the Kingdom of the Brain;
hoisting up the Sails of the eyelids, being well balanced with clear sight,
puts forth from the Optic Port, through the Haven of the round circle in the
Ball; and when it is full freighted with Objects, returns and paies knowledge,
for Custom, to the Soul, its King; whereby the Kingdom grows rich in
Understanding, besides the curiosity of Fancy. But withal it fills the
Kingdom full of vain Opinions, which are able to Rebel with the Pride of
Self-conceit.

Allegory 18.
THE Brain is like a Perspective-glass, and the Understanding is the Eye to
discover the Truth, Follies, and Falsehood in the World.

The Brain is like a Forest, and the Thoughts as Passengers that travel
therein, making Inrodes and beating out Paths. And when the Brain is very dry,
by reason of hot Vapors from the Liver, there arises such a dust of vain
Phantasms as puts out the Eyes of Truth; land when the Brain is slabby and wet
by reason of cold Vapors which are sent out of the ill-disgesting Stomach,
there is such a Bogg of Ignorance, that the Thoughts sink therein, and can
hardly get out, and many times are lost in those Quagmires; but when there is
fair Weather of Health, there is Pleasure and Delight.

Allegory 19.
THE first best Poetical Brain was as a Flint, and Fancy the Sparks that are
struck by the Iron Senses, and all Modern Poets the Tinder that take fire from
thence.

Fancies are tossed in the Brain as a Ball against a Wall, where every Bound
begets an Echo, so from one Fancy arise more.

Phrase is the Painting, Number the Materials, and Fancy the Ground whereon the
Poetical aerie Castles are built. There is no such sweet and pleasing Compagnion
as Fancy, in a Poetical head.

The Brains of men are like Colleges, and the Thoughts are the Students, that
dwell therein; thus many heads may make up an University.

The Picture of Wit. Allegory 20.
WIT is like a Pencill that draws several Figures, which are the Fancies; and
the Brain is the Hand to guide that Pencill, where all hands draw not one and
the same Figure, but according to the skill of the hand; so all Fancies do not
run one way, but according to the temper of the Brain, some run into Invention,
as Artificers; some into Verse, as Poets; so that all Wit is Fancy; yet so much
is the Poets Wit above the Artificers, that his fancy cannot be put into
Artificial Figures, but is as the Spirit, the other as the Body.

Allegory 21.
WIT is like a Lilly, the one is as pleasant to the Ear, as the other is to the
Eye, it comes to fading naturally, and if it be not timely gathered it soon
withers and dies.

22.
PRudence is like an Oak, it is long a growing, and it is old before it dies.

23.
ON the Tower of Ambition hangs a Dial of Industry, where the Sun of good
Fortune shows the time of Friendship, on the Figure of Profession.

24.
MElancholy is the North Pole, Envy the South, Choler is the Torrid Zone, and
Ambition is the Zodiac; Joy is the Ecliptic Line, where the Sun of Mirth
runs; Justice is the Equinoctial; Prudence and Temperance are the Artick and
Antartick Circles; Patience and Fortitude are the Tropicks.

25.
TEars pierce through the Heart of Grief, and vents it out through the Eyes of
Sorrow.

26.
SOme Eyes allure Hearts, as Falckoners do Hawks.

27.
Thoughts are like Pancakes, and the Brain is the Pan wherein they are tossed
and turned by the several Objects, as several Hands.

28.
A Pain in the Teeth is like a Gout in the Toe.

29.
THE Stomach is the Still, the Heart is the Furnace where the Fire lies. The
Heart is a Limbeck, wherein all Passions are distilled, and the Fume thereof
ascends to the Head, and issues out, either through the Eyes, or Mouth; from
the Eyes run the water of tears, from the Mouth the spirits of words.

The Life and Death of Wit. Allegory 30.
FAncy in Verse or Prose, is like a Child in the Womb, which only lives whilst
it is in motion; but when once the innate motion ceases, it is dead: So Fancy,
when once it is conceived and quickened in the Brain, if it be not brought forth
and put into Writing, it dies; and if those Writings be once lost, they cannot
be writ again, no more than a Child can go into the Womb, and be as it was.

Allegory 31.
WIT is the Essence of the Mind, or Soul.

32.
THE Ingredients of the Mind are, Knowledge, Understanding, Imagination,
Conception, Opinion, Will, Memory, and Remembrance; these Compounds make up a
Rational Soul, as several Ingredients make Mithridate.

33.
DIscord is like playing at Tennis, and the Tongue is the Racket to strike the
Ball of Wit, and the Brains are the Gamesters; and if the Gamesters be not
equally skillful, or at least very near, they cannot play; for one cannot play
a Game alone, there must be two that must be matched together.

Of Imitation and Singularity. Allegory 34.
IMitations are like a flight of Wild Geese, which go each one after another,
when Singularity is like a Phaenix, having no Companion or Competitor, which
make it the more admired; And though a good Imitation is good, and those are to
be commended that copy well an excellent Original, yet it expresses want of
Invention that they cannot draw without a Pattern; and it expresses Weakness,
when we cannot go without the help of another.

35.
EVery superfluous Cup, and every superfluous Bit, is digging a Grave to bury
Life in.

36.
WAnton Eyes are like Apes, that skip on every Face, and oftentimes put the
Countenance out of order whereon they light.

37.
EVery little Fly, and every little Peble, and every little Flower, is a Tutor
in Natures School to instruct the Understanding; The four Elements are the four
great Volumes, wherein lie Natures Works.

38.
THE Mind is like a God, that governs all; the Imaginations, like Nature, that
created all; the Brain, as the only Matter on which all Figurative Thoughts
are printed, and formed; Or the Mind is like an Infinite Nature, having no
Dimension nor Extension, and the Thoughts are like Infinite Creatures therein.

39.
THE Mind travels through Speculations and Contemplations, on Probability with
Reason.

40.
TEars are the Children of Grief, which melting, dye as soon as they are born:
But the Womb wherein they lie is always swelled (which is the Eye.)

41.
THoughts are like several Winds, that blow from every corner of the Head; and
the four Partitions of the Skull, are East, West, North, and South; From the
North blows thoughts of Melancholy, which bring cold and chilling Fears, which
freez the Blood, as it were making it thick, and congeal the Spirits, which
otherwise would slow with Agitation. From the South part blows suffocating
Thoughts, which cause foggy Vapors to arise, which darken the Mind with
Discontent from the height of Mirth, and gather into Clouds of Discontent,
which fall down into Showers of Tears. From the West blows malignant
Thoughts, which corrupt the clearer Minds, and inflames the Aerie Spirit,
causing plagues of Jealousy, or a Famine of Despair, or Wars of Fury and
Madness. From the East, refreshing Thoughts arise, which make the Mind serene;
and when the Mind is hot with Ambition, caused by the Sun of Hope, then these
pleasant Gales of Thoughts fan it with Poetical puffs, and allay it with the
sweet Dew of Fancy, causing flowery Sonnets to sprout out on the white Ground
of fine Paper.

Women's Faces are Masks of Modesty to cover the Dishonesty of their Hearts.

Falsehoods are like Caps, which cover the Head of Knowledge from the Sun of
Truth; Or like Vaults, or Woods, that make Echoes, where Words spread far, and
sound double and treble; Or like Squares of Glass, which make of one a thousand.

A Wicked Man's Heart is like a Snake of Wier put up round in a Box, that when
it is opened by base or cruel Actions, it flies in the Face of those that stand
by it.

Of the Thoughts. Allegory 42.
THE Thoughts of Men are like the Pulses of Men; the well-tempered Pulse beats
even, strong and slow; but a hot Constitution beats even, strong and quick; a
feverish Pulse beats double and quick; but in a high Fever the Pulse beats
treble, and sometimes seems to stand still; and in a cold Constitution the
Pulse beats slow and dull: so the Thoughts of those that have slow, strong and
even Thoughts, are Wise and Judicious; those that are even, strong and quick,
are Witty and Ingenious; those that are double and quick, have ready Wits, but
no Judgments; those that have treble Thoughts, and sometimes seem to stand
still, are Mad, but have strong Fancies; and those that are slow and dull, have
neither Wit nor Judgment. There is no way to clear Thoughts but by Words.

Of Melancholy. Allegory 43.
MElancholy persons are never in the Mean, but always in Extremes; as to be
sometimes in an humor of extreme Laughter, other times possessed with high
Fears, passionate Weeping, violent Anger or Rage, and so with stupid Dullness,
and know not why, and yet Rational Persons; and therefore it is not always
Outward Objects, but Inward Dispositions, as the working of the Spirits, or the
motion of the Body, for Melancholy Persons have thick, gross, heavy Humors;
when the Humor is rarefied, it moves Laughter; when heated, Anger; when moved
with desperate Fear, the Smoke, which is the breathing of it, distills into
Tears; when settled and cold, Stupid; so this one Humor brings several Passions.

44.
WOrds of Commendations, mixed with the Flowers of Rhetoric, make a sweet Posie
of Joy, when they are bound up with the Beams of Pleasant Eyes: But words of
Reproach, bound up with the Wrinkles of Frowns, make a Rod to whip an Offender.

45.
THey that take Self-Love for their Guide, ride in the Ways of Partiality, on
the Horse of Flattery, to the Judge of Falsehood; and they that take Reason for
their Guide, ride in the Way of Probability, on a Horse of Prudence, toward
the End of Truth.

46.
Spite creeps like a Snake out of the Bank of base Thoughts, to sting the name
of good Fame.

47.
THE Animal Figure of Mankind, I will similize to an Island, the Blood as the
Sea that runs about, the Mouth as the Haven which receive the Ships of
Provision, which are Meat, Drink (or Mrechandice of Luxurious and Superfluous
Meats and Drinks) which cause many times the ruin of the Island; like as a
Rebellious Pride, so the Humors of the Body swelling with malignity, ruinate
the Body, by a sudden Usurpation, as dead Palsies, Apoplexies, or the like; but
the exterior Senses are the Forts, and the vital parts are like the Magazine,
which as long as they are secured, and that there are Provisions, they are
safe; but if once they are taken, the Island is utterly lost and ruinated;
besides, the Island is in great danger to be over-flowed; for the Blood, which
is as the Sea, being always in perpetual motion, running about Ebbing and
Flowing through the narrow Veins, and large Arteries; if by chance it break
through the Arteries, or overflow the small Veins, it drowns the Island;
wherefore Chyrurgions, which are like Drayners, should cut Sluices to let it out.

48.
A Married life is an Olio Podrido of several Troubles and Vexations mixed
together; and say the chief Meat should be Turtle Doves, though they are most
commonly Scolding Daws, yet Jealousy is the Sauce and Broth thereto; Sickness
and pain in Breeding and Bearing of Children, are the Limmons and Oranges that
are mixed therein.

On this Dish a Married life feeds, which produces no good Nourishment, but
breeds raw, indigested, choleric and melancholy Humors; but a single
Solitariness is a Dish, which is made with Ingredients of Peace, Happiness,
Pleasure and Delight.

This Dish produces good Nourishment, and the Life ofttimes invites the Muses
to feed thereon.

49.
LIfe is like the Shell of a Nut, and Reputation like the Kernel therein;
which if the Teeth of Time crack gently, the Kernel comes out whole, but if it
crack it too rustly, or hard, it breaks the Shell, and bruises the Kernel, or
champs it all in pieces.

50.
FRiendship is like to two Unequal Glasses, where the Species come forth and
meet each other.

51.
THE Mind is like Nature, and the several Thoughts are the several Creatures it
does create; Forgetfulness is the Death, and Remembrance the Life.

52.
JUstice should be a man's Governor, Prudence his Counselor, Temperance his
Friend, Fortitude his Champion, Hope his Food, Charity his House, Faith his
Porter to keep out all Falsehood, and to let in none but Truth; Wit his
Companion, Love his Bedfellow, Patience his Mistress or HandMaid, Reason his
Secretary, and Judgment his Steward.

53.
PRudence, through the ground of Misery, cuts a River of Patience, where the
Mind Swims in Boats of Tranquillity, along the Streams of Life, until it come
to the Shore of Death, where all Streams meet.

54.
A Child's Brain is like ground uncultivated, and Time the Husbandman, with the
several Senses, which are as Plows, throwing up the Furrows of Conception, and
sows Seeds of Thoughts, from whence sprout up several Opinions and Fancies.

55.
OR a Child's Brain is like an Island uninhabited, and the Blood in the Veins
is the Sea that does surround it; but Time, the great Navigator, plants it with
Strength, which causes the Spirits, as Merchants, to traffic thereto; by
which it becomes populated with Thoughts, and builds Towers of Imaginations;
the Magistrates, which are Opinions, dwell therein; but the Castles of Fancy
are for the Muses, who attend the Queen of Wit; but all Brains are not fertile
alike, but are like Islands that are near the Poles, which are inhabited with
nothing but Wild Beasts, as Ruff and Rude Bears; others, though they be nearer
the Sun, yet are Incipid and Barren, being full of Heaths, bearing nothing but
Mossy Ignorance, or else Moorish, being full of Boggs of Sloth, where Lives are
swallowed up, sinking insensibly; and some other Brains have rich Soils, but
want the manuring of Education, whereby the Thoughts, which are the people,
grow lazy, and live brutishly; but those Brains that have rich Soils, moderatly
peopled, and well manured, having not more peopled Thoughts than work for their
Industry, or so few as not to manage or employ every part therein; these Brains
are fortified with Understanding, Governed by Judgment, Civilized by Reason,
Manured by Experience, whereby they reap the plenty of Wisdom, and live in
peaceful Tranquillity, and being enriched with Invention, grow pleasant with
Recreations, making Gardens of Pleasure, wherein grow Flowers of Delight; and
planting Orchards of various Objects, which the several Senses bring in; these
grow tall Trees of Contemplations, whereon the Birds of Poetry sit and sing,
and peck at the Fruit of Fame with their Bills of Glory; from thence they fly
over the Groves of Eternity with their wings of Presumption; but some Birds of
Poetry light on the Ground of Recreation, there hop through the paths of
Custom, made by the recourse of the peopled Thoughts, through the Meadows of
Memory, in the Island of the Brain; and sometimes skip upon a Stick of Conceit,
wagging their tail of Jests; or else fly to the Forest of wild Phantasms; but
there finding little Substance to feed on, return with weary Wings to their
place of rest again; but in the Spring time of Love, the Nightingale-Poets sing
Amorous Sonnets in several Notes of Numbers, sometimes in the Dawny Morning of
Hopes, or in the Evening of Doubts, and sometimes in the Night of Despair, but
seldom in the high Noon of Fruition.

The Worlds Olio. LIB. II. PART II.
Short Essays.
1. AS the Nightingale is the Bird of the Spring; so the Fly is the Bird of the
Summer.

2. There would be no Twilight if there were no Clouds: for the Clouds are like
the Wieck of a Candle.

3. Platonic Love is a Bawd to Adultery; so Romancy, and the like.

4. If a Woman gets a spot in her Reputation, she can never rub it out.

5. It is the greatest study in the Life of a Chaste Woman, to keep her
Reputation and Fame unspotted: for Innocence is often scandalized amongst the
Tongues of the Malicious.

6. Women's Thoughts should be as pure as their Looks; Innocent, Noble,
Honorable, Worthy, and Virtuous, are words of Praises, more proper for Women,
than Gallant, Brave, Forward Spirits; these are too Masculine Praises for the
Effeminat Sex.

7. Men should follow Reason and Truth, as the Flower that turns to the Sun.

8. Pockholes take away the gloss of Youth from a Face.

9. Some give Women more Praises than their Modesty dares countenance.

10. True Affection is not to be measured, because it is like Eternity, not to
be comprised.

11. Those that would be Honored, must have Noble Civilities, Grateful
Performances, Generous Liberalities, and Charitable Compassions.

12. A Man may be as soon dishonored by the Indiscretion of his Wife, as by
her Dishonesty.

13. It is better to live with Liberty, than with Riches.

14. With Virtue, than with Beauty.

15. With Love, than with State.

16. With Health, than with Power.

17. With Wit, than with Company.

18. With Peace, than with Fame.

19. With Beasts, than with Fools.

20. There is no Sound so unpleasing, as to hear Amorous Lovers, or Fools,
speak.

21. There is no Sight so unpleasant, as Affectation.

22. A Graceful Motion sets forth a Homely Person, and wins more Affection
than the rarest Beauty that Nature ever made.

23. Wit, and bon Miene, and Civility, take more than Beauty, and gay Clothing.

24. Pride without State, does as ill as State without Civility.

25. It is better to hear Sense in mean Phrases, than Phrases without Sense.

26. A Man should always wear his Life for the service of his Honor.

27. Men should have Variety in nothing, but Gainful Knowledge.

28. It is proper for a Gentleman to have a bon Miene, to be Civil, and
Conversible in Discourse, to know Men and Manners.

29. It is more proper for a Gentleman to be active in the use of Arms, than in
the Art of Dancing; for a Gallant Man has more use of his Arms than his Heels.

30. It is more proper for a Gentleman to learn Fortification than Grammar: But
what pains will a Man take in learning several Languages, wherein their Tongues
are exercised, and neglect that Learning that should maintain their Honor?
which is, the Sword; the one does but trouble their Heads, and overcharge their
Memories; the other gets Honor, and saves their Lives; the one is only proper
for Scholastical Pedants, the other for Heroic Spirits.

31. A Man should court his Sword as his Mistress, and study to learn its
Virtue, and love it as his Friend, which defends his Honor, to revenge his
Quarrels, and guard him from his Enemies.

32. For he is the more Gallant Man that has a Generous Mind, a Valiant Heart,
than he that has only a Learned Head; the first is Noble, the other
Pedantical; the one gives, the other receives.

33. It becomes a Gentleman rather to love Horses and Weapons, than to fiddle
and dance.

34. And he is not worthy the name of a Gentleman, that had rather come
Sweating from a Tennis-Court, than Bleeding from a Battle.

35. Men should never give Gifts, but out of three respects, either for
Charity, Love, or Fame; and it is a good chance when they meet all in one
Subject; not that one Subject should be all, but all in one.

36. All Civility has a Natural and an Attractive Quality, and, like a
Loadstone, draws Affection to it.

37. There is nothing more Noble, that to overcome an Enemy by Curtesy.

38. And there is nothing more base, than to insult over an Enemy in Adversity.

39. It is more Noble to win an Enemy to be their Friend, than when they have
them in their power, to revenge their Quarrel; for it is the part of Generosity
to Pardon, as well as to Exalt.

40. It looks with a face like Generosity, to be Grateful.

41. There is no greater Usury, or Extortion, than upon Curtesy; for the Lone
of Money is but ten, twenty, or thirty in the Hundred; but the Lone of Curtesy
is to inslave a Man all his life.

42. Yet Gratitude is nothing but to pay a Debt: for if one Man save another
Man's life, and he returns with the hazard of his own, he has paid him what he
owed him; but if he looks for it oftener than once, its Usury; than twice, it is
Extortion.

43. It is Commendable to Censure like a Noble and Merciful Judge, not like a
Wicked Tyrant.

44. Who would esteem Fame, when the Cruel and Wicked shall many times have
Fortune befriend them so, that they shall live with Applause, which is Fame;
and the Virtuous, and Welldeserving, shall be stabbed or wounded with Reproach,
which is Infamy; so that Fame is like a great King, and Fortune the Favorite.

45. Every one cannot be a Caesar, or an Alexander; but there must compile such
Times, Ages, and Actions, and Minds together, to produce such Exploits.

46. Humility is the way to Ambitious ends; for few come to them by Pride, but
by Time serving, or Bribery.

47. For seeming Humility is the Tower whereon Ambition is bailt and Pride is
the Pinnacle, where Envy is an Engine, to pull it down.

48. Nature makes, but Fortune distributes.

49. God by Fortune does not always protect the Honest from the Envious of the
World, or Accidents of Chance.

50. It is as impossible to separate Envy from Noble and Great Actions, as to
destroy Death.

61. Power is like unto Love, it is the strongest when it is drawn to one
point; for Power divided, is weak; so is Love; or like the Sun, when the Beams
are gathered together into one point, it burns.

52. Kings desire Power, because they would be like to a God; but Tyrants may
be said to keep their Power by the sweat of their Brows.

54. To keep the Common People in order, they must be awed with Fear, as well
as nourished with Love, or flattered with Hopes.

55. What hopes can People have of a King to govern a Kingdom, when he does
not reform his own Household, but lets it run into Faction and Disorder?

56. The Service to Kings, is Allegiance.

57. The Service to Nature, is Self preservation.

58. The Service to God, is a Pure Life, and Unfeigned Love.

59. The Reward from Kings, is Outward Honor.

60. The Reward from Nature, is Death.

61. The Reward from God, Eternal Life.

62. Every one is afraid of Tyranny that is under Subjection; but when
Tyranny turns from it self to Clemency, then Love comes where Fear was.

63. The best way for Princes to keep up Authority, is to make good Laws, to
distribute Justice, to correct Vice, to reward Virtue, to countenance Industry,
to provide for the safety of Nation and People.

64. A Man that suffers all Injuries, is a Fool; but to suffer some or to
suffer a Moderation, is Patience.

65. For Patience is the way to Folly, as Fury or Choler to Madness.

66. To put up, or pass by an Injury from those that have power, seems to
proceed from Fear; but to pass by an Injury from the powerless, seems Heroic.

67. Of all Virtues, Patience has the fewest Passions mixed with it; and though
it seems unsensible, yet it sees clearly into its own Misfortunes; for
Patience belongs to the Misfortunes that concern a Man's self.

68. Yet Patience should not be a Bawd to a Man's ruin.

69. There is none can be so patient as those that have suffered much.

70. The Designs of Hate are easier followed, and oftener practiced, than of
Love; for one may easier take Revenge of a Foe, than deliver Life and Liberty
to a Friend.

71. There is none so apt to revenge, as those that have been forgiven.

72. There is none so sorrowful, as those that want Means, and Ways to make
Satisfaction.

73. Many times Guiltiness is more confident than Innocence.

74. There is as much difference betwixt Pleasure and Joy, as Sorrow and
Melancholy; for one disorders the Spirits, the other composes them. An overplus
of Joy, is like those that are drunk, for it makes the Head of Reason dissy.
There are many sorts of Melancholy, but Love-Melancholy makes them cry out, O
Pleasing Pain, and Happy Misery.

75. There is a fixed Grief, and a moving Grief; the one has neither Sighs nor
Tears, but seems as a Marble Pillar; the other breaks into Complaint, and pours
it self forth in Showers of Tears; Yet there are many sorts of Tears; for there
are Tears of Joy, and there are Tears of Sorrow, and Tears of Anger, Tears of
Pity, and of Mirth; and in all Passions, Tears are apt to flow, especially from
moist Brains: But deep Sorrow has dry Eyes, silent Tongues, and aching Hearts.

76. When the Spirits are wearied with Grief, they fall into a Melancholy
Weeping, and then are settled with a compliance to time.

77. Passion will rise in the defense of Honor, and the Tongue will display
the Passion.

78. For all we call Love, is Friendship, which is begot by agreeable Humors,
or received Courtesies, or a Resemblance of Parts, which is alterable: but there
can be no true Love, but upon the unalterable God.

79. There are ways to perfect Love, but no Body can arrive to the Journeys
end, until they come to Heaven, because there is no Perfection in this World;
and there can be no perfect Love, but upon a perfect Object.

80. They that love much, can never be Happy; for the Torment of what Evil may
come to that they love, takes away the sweetness of what they enjoy: Thus the
fear of Losing is more unequal than the pleasure of Enjoyment.

81. The Root of Love is like a Rock, which stands against all Storms; but
Wantonness is like the Root of a Flower, that every Worm may eat through.

82. Envious Persons, and Lovers, are the greatest Flatterers; the one flatters
to hide his Envy, the other to please the Beloved.

83. Those Affections are strongest, that Nature and Education have linkt
together, not only by Birth, but by Conversation: for as Birth most commonly
gives a likeness of parts, so Conversation breeds a resemblance in humors and
dispositions; the one begets a likeness in Body, the other of Minds, or Souls.

84. There is no Sound strikes the Ears so hard, as the report of Death,
especially when Affection opens the Door, and lets the Messenger down into the
Heart.

85. True Love is an Affection, which is very difficult to settle, and hard to
remove, when once placed.

86. To move Passion, rather belongs to the Orator than the Poet; for a Poet is
a Creator of Fancy; and Poetry rather makes than persuades: But indeed that
which moves Passion most, is rather by Sound than Sense; witness Music, which
is the greatest Mover of Passion. Thus Music moves Passion more than Reason;
but Poetry is rather to delight the Wit, than persuade the Reason.

87. There is as much difference in Wit, as there is in Pictures; for every
Picture is not drawn by Apelles; and as some Painters are but for Sign-posts,
so some Wits are only fit for Ballads.

88. One and the same Tale, told by several Persons, makes great difference in
the Affections of the Hearers.

89. A witty Description in Discourse, paints a lively Description in the Mind.

90. A Translator acts the Person of an Author, where most commonly the Author
is represented to his advantage.

91. There are a greater number that write more wisely, and learnedly, than
delightfully.

92. Thoughts, when they run too fast, or are pressed too hard, may destroy the
Body by the distempering of the Mind.

93. To have a Fixed Thought, is to draw the Imaginations to a point.

94. Though the Understanding be clear, yet the Utterance may be instructed, if
the Tongue be not filed with the Motion, to make all run smooth and even.

95. Some have more Words than Wit, and more Wit then Judgment.

96. And others have more Years than Experience, and more Experience than
Honesty.

97. Some have more Law than Policy.

98. Some have more Ambition than Power, and more Power than Justice.

99. Secret Meetings, Soft Whisperings, or Dumb Shows, have most commonly evil
Designs.

100. The dark Minds of Men are deceitful.

101. It were base for a Man or Woman to lay a Blemish upon those that have
given them an honorable Reputation.

102. Many that wish their Enemies Confusion, yet would not betray them to it.

103. I had rather hear what my Enemy can say against me, than what my Enemy
can say for me: for there are none so good but may have some Faults, which
their Enemy is more apt to find out than their Friends, much less themselves.

104. Those persons that are railed at, seem Nobler than those that are humbly
commended.

105. Many Commendations seem little better than Scorns, when to be railed at
shows a Supreme Power of their Evil.

106. Speakers are like Dogs, that bark when they dare not bite.

107. It is an unthankful Office, to decide other men's Quarrels: for most
commonly he is hated on both sides, as a Friend to neither, because he seems a
Friend to both.

108. Thus a Judge most commonly is never beloved, neither of those he judges
the Cause for, nor those he judges the Cause from; the one, because he thinks
he had wrong; the other because he thinks he had nothing but what is his own.

109. So none gain by Quarrels but Lawyers, whose Fees are begot by Discord.

110. It is a great happiness when one can take his Pleasure, and execute his
Duty at once.

111. Some are so Ambitious and Envious, as when they cannot hope to be the
Highest, they would be content to be Miserable to see all others so,

112. The true use of Riches to Noble Minds, is to make others happy as well as
themselves; but not so as to make themselves miserable, by employing and
bestowing all upon others, so as to leave none for themselves, for that were
Vainglory.

113. It is not every Ambitious and Aspiring Spirit, that can do brave and
great Actions.

114. Those Minds that are pure are not to be sullied or moved toward ill,
either by wanton Words, or immodest Actions; they can no more corrupt their
Thoughts, than they do Angels; for those that are Chaste, take more delight and
pleasure in their pure and unspotted Thoughts, than the Amorous Lovers in their
conceived enjoyments: for Nature is not ashamed of her own Works, but of the
abuse of her Works; for as the Wise and Veruous are the chiefest and perfectest
of her Works, so the debauched and foolishest are the greatest defect.

115. Dreams are the overflowing of the Brain, and Sleep stops the Senses, as
Sluices are stopped with Mud.

116. A discoursative Wit, is to play with Words, rather than to talk with
Sense on the ground of Reason; but to talk on Reason is to abate Words, and
multiply Sense. I say, those shall generally please most that give ear to what
is said, than talk most themselves.

117. Our natural English Tongue was significant enough without the help of
other Languages; but as we have merchandized for Wares, so have we done for
Words, but indeed we have rather brought in than carried out.

118. There are Gifts of Affectionate Love.

Gifts of Generosity.

Gifts of Charity.

Gifts of Vainglory.

Gifts of Fear.

Alluring Gifts, and Bribes, that are Gifts of Covetousness.

119. The Mind is like a God, an Incorporeal thing, and so Infinite, that it is
impossible to measure the Mind of Eternity.

120. Desires are like the motion of Time, still running forward, and what is
past, is as if it had never been.

121. The Vapor that ascends to the Head, is a great Instrument to the Wit, as
gross Vapors clog it up, cold Vapors congeale it, hot Vapors inflame it,
thin and sharp Vapors quicken it; so several sorts of Vapors make variety of
Wits; and the several Figures, Works and Forms that the vaporous Smoke does
raise, cause several Fancies, by giving several Motions to the Brain.

122. As Perfumes make the Head ache, so, many times, Prosperity makes the Heart
ache.

123. Ceremony is the ground of all Obedience; for where there is no Ceremony,
the Gods are neglected, and Kings depose themselves by the neglect thereof.

124. Complements are the worst sort of Conversation, besides, they are not
sociable. Truth holds no Intelligence or correspondency with Complements.

Of several Opinions. Essay 125.
SEveral Opinions, except it be in Religion, do no harm, if no good; for
Opinions are the greatest entertainers of Time, and a chief Companion in man's
life; for Opinions are Chatting Gossips, to pass away the idle time; for
although Man complains of the shortenss of Life, and swiftness of Time, yet he
has most commonly more than he can well tell how to spend his Life with; for
most men seek ways to pass Time withal; and if the World were equally,
amongst Mankind and Industry, divided, yet he would find little Variety of
Employment; so that Man's Life is busied more with Thoughts than Actions.

The strength of erroneous Opinions. Essay 126.
HOW strong did men believe against the Antipodes, as one man believing such a
thing to be, was put out of his Liveing, when in after Ages it was found a
Truth? How strongly did many Ages believe that the Torrid Zone, or Ecliptic
Line, was not Habitable, which now is found the most temperate Climate? How
strongly did Europe believe that all the World was discovered, and yet
afterward so much found out, as it seemed another World? and many believi'd
that the Earth was flat and not round, but Cavendish, Drake, and others,
rectified that Error; and many other Examples might be given. So that Opinions
are always in War, with Factious Sidings, and men become their Champions
either with the Pen or Sword; but the ignorant men are the stronger in their
belief in Opinions; for searching gives Doubts, as well as discovers the
Truth, and it is Doubts that disturb the Peace, either of the Mind or
otherways, when Truth commonly closes all differrences; so men travel in
their Thoughts to spy out the Secrets of Nature, and find out Reason, to
persuade them to new Opinions, which may be as far from the Truth, as the old
ones which they sling off; for Nature is too various to be known, and her
Curiosities too subtle to be understood; but men are so strangely delighted
with what is new, that those men that have found a new Opinion are absolute to
judge and rule over all others; such Reputation Singularity begets.

The strength of Opinions. Essay 127.
SO strongly do men wedge or rivet Opinions with the Hammer of a confident
belief, that it is, in many, impossible to remove them fro thm, though they are
most ridiculous and foolish, but especially when they are begot of their own
Brains, and all those that do not adhere to them shall be accounted as their
Enemies; So much does Opinion sway and rule in the mind of Man more than Truth
does; for though some Opinions jump upon Truth, yet it is a thousand to one
when they meet; And when the Truth is found, it is no longer an Opinion, but
Knowledge; yet it is less esteemed when it is found, which makes that Saying
true, That Ignorance is the Mother of Admiration, which Admiration begets an
Esteem, and sets a Value upon they know not what: Wherefore he is a very wise
man, that can rule his Opinions with Reason, and not let his Opinion overbear
his Reason, and to lead him from himself; Yet Opinions should not be slighted
nor contemned without Examination or Trial, though they be never so strange
and unlikely, until the Error be found out; but not to rely upon them, or to
be so bound that they will make no question against them; for an Opinion is but
a guess of what may be a Truth; but men should be as free to Opinions as
Opinions to them, to let them come and go at pleasure.

The Opinions of some Philosophers. Essay 128.
IF it be, as some say, that the First Matter was from all Eternity, it is a
Deity; and God, the Order of Nature from all Eternity: For what had no
beginning, sure is a Deity. Thus Philosophers by their Arguments make three
Deities, although they hold but one.

Of Power. Essay 129.
THose have not an absolute Power that Opportunity can break, but he that has
assurance of a Continuancy; wherefore Fear gives not so much assurance as Love;
for Fear is jealous, and therefore would be ready to break all Bonds of
Authority; But Duty and Love are constant and careful to keep Unity, which is
Peace. Love gives Obedience with Joy, Fear gives Obedience with Murmr, and
Murmr is a Forerunner of Rebellion; wherefore he that has most Love has
most Power.

Of Love. Essay 130.
Pure and true Affection is not to be measured by the length of Years, nor
weighed by the Wealth, nor compassed by the Life: for neither Measures, Scales,
nor Compasses can take the Weight, the Breadth, the Height, the Depth, nor
compass the Circumference.

Of the Senses. Essay 131.
AND those that have their Senses perfect and much employed with Varieties,
must needs know more than those that have them defective, or not practiced; yet
the Senses make not the Understanding, but the Brain; and not the Brain only,
but such a tempered Brain, or such a moved Brain; But some Brains move like
Pulses, some being distempered, as beating either too slow or too quick; but
when the Brain moves even and strong, it shows a healthful Understanding; when
it moves even, strong, and quick, it shows there is much spirit of Fancy, or
blood of Invention.

Of Melancholy. Essay 132.
MElancholy, of all other Humors is the Activest, busying the Mind of Man with
vain Imaginations; shuffling the Thoughts, cutting the Passions, Cozening
themselves, and losing the Judgment; this Humor proceeds from the illaffected
Body, rather than from an ill-affected Mind; It only lives and is cherished in
the Mind, but is bred by a weak Stomach, and is born from an ill Spleen; but
Grief, Sorrow, and Sadness are bred in the Mind, begot by an outward effect: So
Melancholy Men may be said to be Idle, or Musing, but not Sorrowful or Sad;
for they take more pleasure in their Melancholy, than others in their Mirth;
but those that are Melancholy are as great a Punishment to their Friends, as a
sweet Happiness to themselves.

Of a dull or Melancholy Disposition proceeding from the Body, and the
Melancholy proceeding from the Soul. Essay 133.
I Cannot call it Melancholy, but rather a dull Disposition, which is caused by
a heavy black Humor, or a cold thick humor, or a slimy glassie humor, or a
sharp Vitreolbred in the Body; which penetrates the Body as it were, or
stupifies the Senses, and quenches the Natural Heat. Thus the Body, like Stone.
Walls up, or imprisons the Soul, or Mind, wherein it can neither be Active nor
Free; this causes a dull and sad Disposition, which kind of Disposition has
few Desires, and reguards not any thing, nor takes pleasure in Life, but lives
as if it lived not.

Where true Melancholy is a serious Consideration; it examines the Worth and
Nature of every thing; it seeks after Knowledge, and desires Understanding; it
observes strictly, and most commonly distinguishes judiciously, applies
aptly, acts with ingenuosity, uses Time wisely, lives honestly, dies
contentedly, and leaves a Fame behind it.

Where a dull Disposition is lasy and idle; neither considers, nor observes,
but lives like a carved Statue; dies like a Beast that cares for no Monumental
Remembrance.

The variety of Wit. Essay 134.
MErcury is feigned the Patron of Thieves, because Mercury is Eloquent, and
Eloquence steals away the Hearts of men by consenting to follow after the
persuasions of Rhetoric; so he is feigned to be the most talkative God,
because the chief part of Rhetoric lies in the use of the Tongue. Wit is the
God of Fancy, a world of Arts, a Recreation to time, a Disposer of Passions; it
sweetens Melancholy, dresses Joy; it quenches Fears, raises Hopes, eases
Pains; an Orator of Love, and a Denier of Lust; It mourns with Sorrow, mends
Faults; it moves Compassion, begs Pardon; a Perswader to Virtue, an Adornment
to Beauty, a Veil to Imperfection, the Delight of Life, Music to the Ears, a
Charm to the Senses; it is a Child of the Brain; it is begot by Experience, and
fed with Heat. Wit is like Proteus in several Forms, as the Arms of Mars, Joves
Thunderbolt, Neptunes Trident, Plutes Cerberus, Vulcans Net, Pallass Lance,
Apollos Harp, Circes Wand, Minervas Loom, Mercuries Rod, Venus Doves, Pans
Pipe, Cupids Arrow, the Center of the Earth; it is Boreas to Raise Storms, it
is Zephyrus to refresh, it is Revenges Sword, and Deaths Since, Glories Throne,
Beauties Pencil, Oblivions Resurrection, the Worlds Delight, Life's Guide, Loves
Fire, Fames Trumpet, and the Mother of Nature. So he that has a true-born Wit
has all.

Of Poets. Essay 135.
POets do sometimes like Painters, that draw an excellent Beauty, but give it
such a Dress that it neither becomes it, nor will it last in fashion, in all
places or times: so Poets may have excellent Fancies, but clothe them in such
harsh andvulgar accustomed Language, as they become Deformed.

There are three sorts of things go to a good Poet, Viz. Fancy, Number, and
Rhyme; To converse with Poets, sweetens the Nature, not softens it, to make it
Facile, but civiliseth it, making it Courteous, Affable and Conversable,
Inspiring the Mind with High and Noble Fictions.

Disguisement by Description. Essay 136.
AS ill Painters, in setting out the Beauty of the External, do often leave to
Posterity, of well formed Faces a, deformed Memory; so weak Writers in
describing of the Virtue of the Internal, and the gallant Actions of a Life,
either by their mean Rhetoric, or weak Judgment, the most Perfect and
Princely men, are described with a defective Representation.

Of Passionate Expressions. Essay 137.
PAssionate Verses or Speeches must not be read in a Treble There is difference
betwixt Base and Tenor.
Note, but in a Tenor, and sometimes full as low as a Base, especialy when the
Passion is high ad elevately expressed, for then the Voice must be sad or solemn,
which moves in Descending, not Raised Notes, which are Light and Acry, raising
their Tone to a whyning Tune, that is like a squeaking Fiddle or a squeaking
Voice; but a serious Speech, a Solemn Note, and a Sober Countenance must be
joined together to express a sad Passion to the life; besides, the words must
be spoke Soft and Gentle, and not pressed and struck too hard against the Lips,
or Teeth, or Tongue, but they must be pronounced Swiftly and Harmoniously; to
move the Heart to pity, the Eyes to be filled with Tears, and to draw the Soul,
as it were, through the Ears, to feed on Melancholy.

Of Translation. Essay 138.
WE are given much, in this latter Age, to Translation, and though Translation
is a good Work, because it does not only divulge good Authors, but distributes
Knowledge to the unlearned in Languages; yet Translators are but like those
that show the Tombs at Westminster, or the Lions at the Tower, which is but to
be an Informer, not the Owner of them.

Essay 139.
ALthough Accidents give the Ground to some Arts, yet they are rude and uneasy
until the Brain has polished them over.

True it is, the Senses most commonly give the Brain the matter to work on, yet
the Brain forms and figures those Materials, and disperses them abroad, to the
use of the World, by the Senses again: for as they came in at the Ear and the
Eye, or the Taste, Sent, and Touch; so they are delivered out by the Tongue and
Hands.

Essay 140.
IT is worthy the Observation, to regard the odd Humors of Mankind, how they
talk of Reason, and follow the way thereof so seldom; for men may as easily
set Rules to Eternity as to themselves; for the Mind is so intricate and
subtle, that we may as soon measure Eternity as It.

Of Dilation and Retention. Essay 141.
A Dilation causes as much weakness as Contraction; Dilation causes weakness
by the Disuniting the United Forces, and setting them at too great a Distance;
and Contraction binds them up too hard, not giving, as we vulgarly say, Elbow
room.

The Worlds Olio. LIB. II. PART III.
Of the Britains.
THE Britains of England were a Valiant People, but that they had not skill of
Arms answerable to their Courage, as the Romans had; yet Caesar, and all the
Emperors, could not conquer that Island in so short a time as Alexander had
conquered most part of the World; therefore it seems their Courage was great,
since their Skill was less, and could make it to the Romans so difficult a
Work: For Britain was like a Body dis joynted, or rather separated Limb from
Limb; for it was not joined in one Body, but divided amongst many Petty Kings,
which made it weak; for being not united, the Body has little power; without
the Legs do uphold, and the Eyes do direct, and the Arms do defend, it is an
easy thing to throw down a Criple; but it was a sign the Spirit was strong in
this Criple, that could resist so long against a Giant, as the Romans were:
Therefore Britain was worthy of Praise, since their Courages defended them so
long.

Of King James.
KIng James was so great a Lover of Peace, that rather than he would lose the
Delights of Peace, he would lie under the Infamy of being thought Timorous; for
in that it was thought he had more Craft than Fear.

Of Queen Elizabeth.
QUeen Elizabeth reigned long and happy; and though she clothed her self in a
Sheeps skin, yet she had a Lions paw, and a Foxes head; she strokes the Cheeks
of her Subjects with Flattery. whilst she picks their Purses; and though she
seemed loath, yet she never failed to crush to death those that disturbed her
ways. Her Favorites for Sport, she would be various to, sometimes in Favor,
and sometimes out of Favor, as Essex, Leicester, Ralegh, Hatton, and the like:
But she stuck close to her old Counselors and Favorites, Burleigh,
Walsingham, and the rest. Neither did the first Favorites get so much as the
last, Ralegh got not so much as Burleigh did; some may say, because they spent
more, they laid up less; but vain Favorites get more Enemies to themselves,
and Hatred to their Princes, than Profit to themselves; for the sight of their
Vanities makes the People remember their Taxes, and think that their Prince
has posed from their Purses to maintain their Vanities; and their Prince
thinks they have given them more, because they show what they have, and many
times more than they have: But the Wisest save, and lay it up, till the Envy is
past, and the Tax forgot. But Queen Elizabeth maintained more foreign Wars at
one time, than any of her Predecessors before her, and yet without the
Grievance of the People; for it was not so much out of their Purses, as the
Prizes she got by Sea; for though the King of Spain had the Honor of being
Master of the Indies, yet the Queen of England had the Honor of being Mistress
of the Sea; so her Ships were her Mines, to maintain her War against him.

Of King Henry the Eighth.
KIng Henry the Eighth was a Politic Prince; for as Favorites make use of
their Prince, so he made use of his Favorites; for when they could do him no
more service, he turned them over to the Hangman, to satisfy his People; and
those that he favored, had the blame with the punishment, and he received the
profit. He was not like Edward the Second, for his Favorites cost him his
Crown and Life. I observe, that soft natures are apt to be crushed, and very
hard natures are apt to be broken in governing; therefore severe, but not
cruel, merciful or kind, but not credulous, reign happiest. But Henry the
Eighth spent great Sums of Money, as that which his Father left him, and that
which he had out of France, then the vast Sums he raised out of Monasteries,
yet no great advantage redounded to his Kingdom: But his Expense was much to
keep Peace abroad, by making Friends in those Kingdoms that were fallen out:
But most commonly those that strive to make Peace amongst others, bring War to
themselves, although I cannot say he had much War.

Of pulling down of the Monasteries in Henry the Eighths time.
SOme wonder that Henry the Eighth did pull down and destroy so many
Monasteries as were in England, which had stood so long, without Opposition:
but it was likely that the Opposition could not be great; for first, the People
were persuaded in some part, by the Doctrine of Luther, to dislike the Tyranny
of the Pope; for first, it eased their Purses and their Persons, the one from
Peter Pence, and the like, and the other from hard Penance; the next, the
Gentry and the Nobles thought of the gaining of the Houses, and Lands, and
Liberty; the King for the bulk of their Wealth; so the King, Nobility, and
Commons, and all had ends in it; and where the King follows the Commons, an
Innovation is easy; or I may say, an Innovation is easy where the King follows
the People.

Of Justice in Commonwealths.
IT is to be observed, that there is little Piety or Justice in Cities, or
Countries, or Nations, that are overgrown with Prosperity, or oppressed with
Adversity; for Prosperity makes them so proud, as they are as it were above
Justice; and Adversity does so deject them, as they grow careless of Justice,
so that either way they grow into Barbarism: But as Virtue is a Mean betwixt
two Extremes, so it keeps in the Mean in all Estates, the Virtue of Prosperity
is Temperance, and the Virtue of Adversity is Fortitude.

Of Henry the Seventh.
IT was not so much the Wisdom of Henry the Seventh that gave him the Crown,
as his Good Fortune in having a Tyrant Opposer, on which the Peoples fear was
above their feeling; for they did apprehend more Tyranny than they found in
the time that Richard did reign; for he made more good Laws in the time of his
Reign, than had been made in the Reign of many Kings before or after him: But
the Peoples mistrust cannot be satisfied with any Act, let it be never so just
or profitable, but by their absence, which they never think far enough, until
they go to the Shades of Death; and many times that which they believe will
prove the best for them, proves the worst, because they follow not Reason, but
Will: For Henry the Seventh, whom they thought to be most happy under, proved
but a Tyrant in his Acts, although a Saint in his Words; for he brought, by the
means of Projecting and Informing Knaves, the greatest, or indeed all Estates,
to be Forfeited, and so to be Compounded for, by which he raised great Sums of
Money, to the ruining of many Ancient Families; yet he reigned peaceably most
part of all his time, which many a better and juster Prince had not the fortune
to do.

Of the Emperors.
MOST commonly it may be said of Kings or Governors, as they say of March, It
comes in like a Lion, it goes out like a Lamb; and when it comes in like a
Lamb, it goes out like a lion.

But when a Man desires to raise an Empire, or himself to be an Emperor, he
flatters the People; but when he is once become Emperor, he makes the People
flatter him.

Caesar might have proved a good Emperor, but he had not time to be an ill one.

Augustus Caesar was a wise Prince; he knew there was no way to settle the
newborn Empire, and to enjoy it peaceably, but by gaining the Love of the
People; not by the base servile way of Flattery, but by executing Justice, and
making wise and good Laws.

Tiberius was a good Prince, whilst the memory of Augustus lasted in the Minds
of the People; and a wise Prince, that he could dissemble his Humor so well,
and so long; and none was so fit as Ascianus to bring him to bed of his great
bellied Cruelty. Tiberius was of a lazy disposition, as we may know by his
solitary and luxurious life.

Nero came too soon to the Empire to reign well; Vanities, the Rulers of Youth,
despise Prudence, and Temperance, the Companions of Age; his Vanities bred
Vices, his Vices bred Fear, Fear bred Jealousy, Jealousy bred Tyranny,
Tyranny bred Conspiracy, and Conspiracy Destruction; in brief, he had not Age
enough to poyse him; he killed himself more out of Fear than Courage. Both the
Neroes, the Uncles, and the Cosen, were much of a humor.

Nero Germanicus, his Son; he was Proud, Cowardly, Effeminat, Envious,
Vainglorious, Covetous to get, Prodigal to spend, Cruel without Craft, and Mad;
he was not wise enough to rule his Empire, nor temperate enough to govern his
Vanities, nor courageous enough to dissemble his Fears, or be a good Prince.

As for Claudius the Emperor, he was more learned than wise, and he had more
good Nature than Constancy; and whatsoever ill he did, he was seduced to do it
by those he loved. True it is, he was of an easy Disposition, but that proceeds
more from a good Disposition in Nature, than an evil one; and it rather comes
from Love than Hate, although the Effects be all one; for he that is easily
persuaded, and suddenly believes, commits more Cruelty by his Credulity, than
distributes Justice by his good Nature.

As for Galba, he had too narrow a Soul for so great an Empire; for the Vices
of Age and Covetousness had got hold of him: he was Old and Crazy; he had no
Generosity to entice, nor Sweet Behavior to win, nor Oratory to persuade, nor
Industry to order, nor Faith to perform; and whatsoever Man has these Faults,
must needs get more Enemies than Friends.

As for Otho, he had not Patience to try his Fortune, neither lived he so long
as any one could judge of his Government: he was better beloved of his
Soldiers, than fortunate in their Successes; besides, he was beloved more of
the People after he was dead, than when he was living; but whether he killed
himself for the grief of those Soldiers that were lost, or fear of the loss of
the rest, or for fear of himself, it is doubtful.

Vitelius was cruel, gluttonous, and of an unworthy nature.

For Vespasian, he was very greedy of Gain, to the height of Covetousness, and
yet he was very Generous; for whatsoever he got, though ill, yet he bestowed it
well: he was a very merciful Prince, and very few Faults to be found in him.
He sprung from a Family of no great growth.

Titus Flavius, Son to Vespasian; he was so good, there cannot enough be said
in praise of him; he was a Wise Prince, and a Just Prince, a Merciful Prince,
and a Loving, Temperate, Careful, and Religious Prince; he seemed to have more
Goodness in him, than were ways or means to express it; he was Valiant,
Learned, Mild, Patient, Industrious, Skillful in all Arts, and Majestical.

Flavius Domitianus was Cruel and Vainglorious; he followed not the steps of
his Father, nor Brother. I observe, Ill-born Natures cannot be bettered by Good
Examples, nor warned by Ill Examples: for all the Cruel Emperors came to
Untimely Deaths.

Of Pompey with Caesar.
SOme praise Pompey, and say, He was a faithful and loving Citizen of Rome; a
Father, in defending the Laws and Liberties; and a Martyr, in dying in the
Cause.

Others dispraise him, and say, It was Envy to Caesar that brought him out
against him, more than for the Public Good; and that if Pompey had had but the
same Fortune, he would have taken upon him the same Command.

Others again praise Caesar, and say, that he was forced to use his Power and
Arms against the Senate, out of necessity, the one, being much in Debt, having
exhausted his Estate, the other, in defense of his Life, knowing the Senate
would accuse him instead of rewarding him for his good Service; and that
Rational Men may judge, by the succession of Story, that he was necessitated,
and that Fortune being on his side, gave him greater Hopes, and higher Designs,
which he thought not at first on; and that he had Reason, though he had not
been necessitated; for though the Roman Government began from a Low and Mean
Beginning, yet it came to be the most Powerful and Famous, whilst Mediocrity
ruled amongst them: for at first their Poverty made them Just, not daring to do
Wrong; and Prudent, in providing the best ways and means to keep and raise
themselves; and Valiant and Industrious, to defend themselves, and to increase
their Dominions. Thus Virtues begot their Strength, and raised their Fame: But
their good Fortune brought Plenty, and Plenty Pride; the one runs into Luxury,
the other into Ambition; and Ambition begot Factions so much, that in the
latter days of their Government, though it was called a Republic, yet every
Man was striving to be Chief, and setting up for themselves. And, say they, why
may not Caesar think himself as fit to be Emperor as any of his FellowCitizens,
seeing the Government would change? And that it was as great an Injustice, when
he cannot do another good, to do himself wrong, as to do another wrong, and do
himself no good, or to do himself and another wrong; for how often was it aimed
at by Sylla Cataline, and many more, though not ripe until Caesar's time? so
that Caesar had not only Necessity and Opportunity but Justice to persuade
him, on his side; for any Government is better than none; for they were come
almost to that pass, that there was no Unity; for every Man was against one
another, but only sided when they saw a particular Rise. But the general
Faction fell into two hands, the one for a Republic, the other for a Monarch,
wherein the Monarchical Faction prevailed, wherein Caesar was Chief; and it may
be a question, whether the other Faction did not take the Republic only for
Name, but had a Monarchical Design? But, say they, Envy, that is the Enemy to
all Good Success, would have disclaimed against the other side, if they had had
the same Fortune; for Envy dies not when Action cease, but lives as long as
Honorable Fame survives; and that Good Fortune made Caesar seem Ambitious, and
Pompey more humble by his Ill; for though Good Fortune has many Friends, and
more Followers, yet it is to the present Condition. But to conclude, that
Caesar was Valiant, Witty, Industrious, Sweet-natured, and Bountiful,
Grateful, Constant to his Friends, and Merciful to his Enemies, show by his
Acts; and for his Valor, he fought many Battles upon great Ods and
Disadvantages, and hazarded his Life other ways many several times. Others
dispraise Caesar, and say, he was a Traitor, an Usurper, and naturally Cruel,
but what he did artificially with Prodigality to compass his Ends; and that he
was a Coward, and bought more Victories by his vast distributions of Provinces,
and other Gifts, than were truly got by his Courage, or Conduct. But the
Factions of Caesar and Pompey dyed not when their Wars ceased, but have lived
ever since amongst the Historians; for they cannot praise one so well, unless
they dispraise the other; for to praise, or dispraise them both, would have
made their Theme so short, they should have little to write on; for Disputes
both lengthen and heighten. But there are most commonly more faults found by
Historians, than Applauses; but Writing has as great a defect as Government in
Commonwealths and Armies, though of less Consequence. But, they say, Men of
Action have two sides, a good side, and a bad side, and some take the good side
of Caesar, and the bad of Pompey; others, the good side of Pompey, and the bad
of Caesar; but the bad side lies more open and broader than the good, which
makes it so often beaten upon by Envy; for Envy discovers the one; and veils
the other.

Of Mark Anthony.
MArk Anthony made Caesar's Body the Ladder to reach to his Ambition; for he
knew, if he did side with the party of the Caesar's, he should be one of the
Chief, and have a Party to govern and command: but if he sided with Brutus, he
must still submit to obey, either to the Common People, if Brutus and Casstus
meant really to deliver up their power to the Commons, when they had once got
it; or if they did intend to keep it, he must submit to them. And though
Anthony loved Caesar very well, yet I rather believe he raised the Faction more
to raise himself, than to revenge the death of Caesar; for few remember the
Benefits of the Dead, and they know the Dead cannot give them thanks for any
service they can do them.

Of Cleopatra.
AS for Cleopatra, I wonder she should be so Infamous for a Whore, since she
was Constant to those Men she had taken; for she had no other but Caesar,
whilst he lived; and for Anthony, she dyed soon after him; and can there be a
greater Constancy? We must not judge Strangers according to our Laws, but
according to the Laws of the Nations where they were Natives, for she had taken
them as Husbands; if the Men had more Wives than they should have, or put away
good Wives for her sake, that was their Inconstancy; and we must not make their
Faults, her Crimes; and they call her a Dissembling Woman, because she did
strive to win her Husbands Affections; shall we say those dissemble, that
strive to please those they love? if they say true Love can dissemble, they may
as well say Truth is no Truth, and Love is no Love: but the Lover delivers his
whole Soul to the Beloved. Some say she was Proud and Ambitious, because she
loved those had most Power: She was a Great Person her self, and born to have
Power, therefore it was natural to her to love Power; Besides, she might have
got a worse Reputation, in being thought a base and unworthy spirited Woman, if
she had loved any below her Worth. Some again say, she loved out of Craft to
keep her Kingdom, I say there is an honest Policy, and it is out of Envy when
they lay a reproach on it; for whosoever is to choose, it is lawful to make
the best choice, when it is in an honest way.

Of Lucretia.
THE only true and honest Wife was Lucretia, for she killed her self to save
her Husbands Honor, although it was her Husbands fault that caused her
Ravishment: for it was not her admittance to entice Men, but her Husbands
foolish and rash admittance, to bring Men to be tempted: for it was her
Husbands Praises that kindled, and her Beauty that inflamed the Ravisher. But
that Man is worthy to be Horned, that is not contented to enjoy the Virtues of
his Wife to himself.

Of Caesar.
HAlf Caesar's Deeds dyed when he dyed: for though his Fortunes were to show
himself a Valiant Man, a Good Soldier, and a Careful Commander, yet he lived
not to show Justice in the Public, as what Laws he would make, or what
Government he would form; so that Caesar only lived to show his Conduct in
Wars, but not his Magistracy in Peace.

Of Brutus.
BRutus was thought a greater Friend to the Commonwealth, than to Caesar; but I
think him a Friend to neither; for the Envy to the present Government, or
Governor, begot his desire of Change: for Brutus was wise enough to know, an
Indifferency in Commonwealths is safer than a sudden Alteration. Indeed, had
the Commonwealth been at the worst, then a Change must needs have been for the
better: but it was not so, for there were more that seemed for it than against
it; but we must judge in those Causes by the Ourward Actions, to approve of
Caesar's Government, by adhering to that Patty; for if they had liked better of
their Old Government, they would have followed Brutus; and that Government is
to be approved best, that pleases most; for Government is for Safety, Peace,
and Profit; and there is nothing keeps them more in Peace, than Unity and
Concord, and the Affections of the People to their Governors, etc.

Of Portia.
POrtia, that killed her self with hot burning Coals, showed more of
Impatiency, and Womanish Fear, than Love to her Husband, though no question her
Love was great, but her Fear was greater; for Love begets Doubts, and Doubts
beget Fears, and Fears beget Hate: but true Love will be sure to save it self,
till they be sure that they can do no good to that they love, and that they
love is absolutely destroyed: for true Love will hope, until there is no
ground to raise Hopes on; and Hope begets Courage, and Courage will give
Assistance, as long as it has a Being: for though her Husband run out of Rome,
yet he had his Life, and an Army to defend it for the time: Therefore it seemed
she grieved and run mad more for loss of her Husbands Power, than for fear of
her Husbands Person; and whenever a Woman loves her Husbands Power more than
his Safety, she loves her Vanity more than his Person; for Power maintains
Vanity.

Of Penelope, Ulysses Wife.
PEnelope, Ulysses Wife, was Famous, for that she never married whilst her
Husband was in the Wars. It is true, she was Chaste, but she gave her self leave
to be Courted, which is a degree to Unchastity, and a means whereby her
Husbands Estate was wasted; for if she had checked, and not permitted them at
the first, they would never have grown unto that Impudence: But it seemed she
loved to have her Ears filled with her own Praises; for they that love their
own Praises, most commonly are catched in the Snare of Flattery; for there are
seldom Praises without much Flattery. It is true, she might be a Chaste Woman,
but she showed her self but an Indifferent Wife, and not worthy of so much
praise: for it is not Honesty that makes a perfect good Wife, although it be
the chief Ingredient, but she must be Thristy, and Cleanly, Modest, reserved in
her Behavior, and secret to her Husbands Counsels; for often times a Woman
dishonours her Husband by her Indiscretion, as much as by the act of Adultery;
for there is nothing dearer to a Man than his Fame, so a Wife should have a
care to keep it.

Of Women dying with their Husbands.
I Have not read much Story, but of that which I have, I have observed, that
there have been many Women that have dyed with their Husbands; but I have not
read so usually, that Men have dyed with their Wives: for in some Nations there
are few or no Widows. Some say, it is not so much out of Love to their
Husbands, as out of vainglorious Customs.

Of the Romans dying.
IT was not out of Courage that the Romans killed themselves, but out of Fear;
for knowing they must dye, they thought it was less pain to dye by their own
hands, than by another; like Parents, that will not suffer another to beat
their Child, but think their own Correction the easier, though their Stripes be
equal; and every one thinks that better done which they do themselves, than
what another does: so they kill themselves to avoid Pain. But those are most
willing to leave the World, when the World has left them; for it is the
Vanities that makes Men so in love with the World, and themselves; for most
think they enjoy no Life, if they enjoy no Vanity; I will not say All, although
I say Most, for the Wise and the Virtuous reject both; or if they do not, they
embrace them but moderately; and the Virtuous and Wise have Courage; and the
Courageous, as they do not fear Death, so they despise not Life; for as Virtue
is a Mean between two Extremes, so it keeps in the Mean of all Conditions and
Estates.

THE EPISTLE.
THis is to let you know, that I know, my Book is neither wise, witty, nor
methodical, but various and extravagant, such as my Thoughts entertained
themselves withal; rather making it my Recreation, not having much Employment,
than my Trouble, for I have not tied my self to any one Opinion, for sometimes
one Opinion crosses another; and in so doing, I do as most several Writers do;
only they contradict one and another, and I contradict, or rather please my
self, with the varieties of Opinions whatsoever, since it is said there is
nothing truly known, but Measuring and Reckoning, the which I will leave to
Arithmeticians and Geometricians, who have a Rule and Number, which my Brain
can neither level at, nor comprehend: but humble and plain Opinions, raised by
the Opinions of others, I here present; and many may think my Present not worth
the reading, and that it had been better my Thoughts had been buried, than to
trouble our Language with that there is so much already of, foolish and
impertinent Writings; for those that know not how to choose good and prositable
Books, may take up such Rubbish in their place, as to dam up their Heads from
the light of shining Authors. But there are few that have not so much
Self-love, as to desire to live in something; and I am one of those that had
rather dam up a Head, than to be buried under foot; and wish my Brains could
have melted better Metal, to have made my Book as a Bell, to sound clear and
loud, but not to offend the Ears of any; for though I wish to fill them, I
would not hurt them, for Fame is nothing but a Noise. And when I consider
Fortune carries as many into her House as Merit, I put out this Book, though I
cannot hope to have any acceptance amongst the Learned, but leaving it to
Fortunes friendship; for she many times prefers the Mean, and the Low, and
disgraces those of higher Abilities; which if she favor me, I know you will be
my Friends; but if she disgraces me, there is not any thing in my Book can keep
off a Scorning Censure; but whether it please, or be dis-approved, I am as I am,

MARGARET NEWCASTLE.

The Worlds Olio. LIB. III.
PART I.
Of Monsters.
SOme say there are no Monsters, nor ugly Creatures in Nature; for a Toad, a
Spider, or the like, are as beautiful Creatures in Nature, if it be according
to their kind, as the lovelyest Man or Woman. It is true, as being according to
the natural shape of such a kind of Creature: but that which is ugly, is that
which is deformed, and that is deformed that is misshapen, and that is misshapen
that is made crooked, or awry, or one part bigger or less than another. And
those Creatures are to be called Monsters, that have more parts than they
should have, or fewer, or when their parts do not sit in their proper place; as
for example, if a Man should have two Heads, or four Legs, or more Hands, or
Feet, or Fingers, or Toes, or Eyes, or Noses, or Ears, or the like; or if the
Eyes should be placed in the Breast, in the Neck, or Mouth; or the Ears in the
Breast, or Belly, or behind in the Head; or if the Arms should be where the
Legs are, or the Legs where the Arms are set; or that an Arm or Hand, Leg or
Foot, should grow out of the Head; or if a Man should be in some kind like a
Beast, and many the like Examples might be given; this being against the nature
of the kind, and not according to the natural shape, may be called a Monster.
Thus there are both ugly Creatures, and Monsters; the one being a Defect of
Nature, the other a Fault of Nature, or as I may say, a Vice in Nature. But a
right shaped Toad may be of an ill favored kind, as not being so handsome a
kind as Mankind, or many other kinds of Animals; for I never heard any Poetical
high Expressions of the Commendation of a Toad, as to say, that is a most
beautiful, amiable, sweet, lovely Toad.

Of Upright Shape.
THat which makes Man seem so Excellent a Creature above other Animal
Creatures, is nothing but the Straitness and Uprightness of his Shape; for
being strait breasted, and his Throat so equal to his Breast, and his Mouth so
equal to his Throat, makes him apt for Speech, which other Creatures have not;
for either their Legs, Belly, or Neck, Mouth and Head, are uneven, or unequally
set: And this Shape does not only make Man fit for Speech, but for all sorts
of Motion, or Action; which gives him more Knowledge, by the Experience thereof
from the Accidents thereby, than all other Animals, were they joined together.
Thus Speech and Shape make Men Gods, or Rulers over other Creatures.

Memory is Atoms in the Brain set on fire.
SOme say Memory is the folding of the Brain, like Leaves of a Book, or like
Scales of Fishes, which by motion of Wind or Vapors, are caused by outward
Objects, which heave up their Folds, wherein the Letters or Print of such
things as have been represented to it; and those things that have been lost in
the Memory, is either by the reason those Folds have never been opened after
they were printed, or that the Prints have been worn out, as not being engraven
deep enough. But I think it is as likely that the Brains should be full of
little Substances no bigger than Atoms, set on fire by Motion, and so the Fire
should go out and in, according as the Motion is slackned or increased, either
by outward Objects, or inward Vapors; and when things are lost in the Memory,
it is when the Fire of those Atoms is gone out, and never kindled again; and
that sometimes the Memory is not so quick as at other times, is, because some
Vapors damp and smother the Fire, or quench it out. But Memory is the light
and life of Man, and those that have the most of those kindled Feabers, or
Atoms, are the greatest Wits, and the best Poets, having the clearest Sparks.
Now the Substances are plain, and not figured in new born Children, nor clearly
kindled, but take Figures as they receive Objects; and when they see their
Nurse, which is the first thing they take notice of, then one of those small
Substances turns into the Figure of the Nurse; yet that Figure being not
kindled presently, because the moisture of the Brain hinders that Motion that
kindles the Fire; and the Figure does no good, unless it be thoroughly kindled;
and the brighter it is, the perfecter is the Memory. And the reason why
Children have not so much Knowledge, is, because they have not so much Heat,
nor so many Figures in their Brains, nor those Substances so clear: for Wood
that is newly set on fire is not so bright a Fire as when it is half burnt out;
for Men we see in their middle age have the perfectest Understanding; and the
reason why Old Men become as Children, is, because Children are as a Fire that
is first kindled, and Old Men as Fire that is burnt out. Now there are not
only those Figures that the Senses have brought in, but new Figures that
former Figures have made, which are those Fictions which Poets call Fancy; and
the reason why all Men are not so good Wits as some, is, because their Fuel is
too wet, or too dry, which are those Atoms; and the reason why some Men are
not so wise as they might be, is because Objects come not in time enough: for
though they take the Prints, yet they take not the Fire. Now those Prints or
Forms are like Glasses, or several Forms of Pots of Earth; for though they are
formed, and figured, yet they are not hardened or perfected until they have
been in the Fire; so that the Form may be there, although not kindled: but when
they are kindled, they are Thoughts, which are, Memory, Remembrance,
Imagination, Conception, Fancy, and the like.

Of Reason.
SOme say, Reason is born with a Man as well as Passion; but surely we may more
certainly say that it is bred with a Man, than born with a Man; for we see many
times that Men are born, which have never the use of Reason, as those we call
Changelings or Naturals, but we never saw any Man born without Passion; for
Passion seizes the Body as soon as Life, and they are inseparable, and no more
to be separated than Motion and Life: for as soon as the Body receives Life, it
receives Like and Dislike as Pain grieves it, and Ease pleases it, so that
Passion is the Sense of Life, and Reason the Child of Time: But Reason is like
the stone or kernel of Fruit Trees, which if it be well set, with the help of
the Sun, and Earth, may come to be a Tree; but yet it is not a Tree whilst it
is a Kernel: so we may say Man is born with Reason, because in time he is
capable of Reason; but yet he is not a reasonable Creature until he can
distinguish between Good and Evil for himself; but as Life begets Sense, so
Sense begets Reason. Thus Reason is a second or third Cause of Nature; for
Nature works producingly, as one thing produces another, and that other a
third. But Natures first Work, and principal Material, is Life, and Life is
Motion, and Motion is Nature, and Nature is the Servant of God; for Art is the
Invention of Man, and Man the Invention of Nature.

Of Imagination of Man and Beast.
ONE Man may know what Imagination another Man has, by the relation of
Discourse; but Man cannot know what Imaginations Beasts have, because they can
give no relation to Man's Understanding, for want of Discourse: wherefore Beasts
may have, for all any Man knows, as strange and as fantastical Humors,
Imaginations, and Opinions, as Men, and as clear Speculations; and Beasts are
as busy, and as full of Action, as Men; although not in useless Actions, yet it
is in the prudent part, for the subsistence of Life for themselves, and their
Young; being provident and iudustrious thereunto, and not like Man, wasting the
time with idle Disputes, tormenting themselves to no purpose.

Of Understanding of Man and Beast.
THat which makes one Man wiser than another, and some Beasts, and other
Creatures, subtiller and craftier than others, is, the temper of the Brain,
being hotter and dryer, cold and dry, hot and moist, and the Intelligence that
the Senses bring in, which Beast has as well as Man.

Difference betwixt Man and Beast.
MAN troubles himself with Fame, which Beasts do not; and Man troubles himself
for Heaven, and Hell, which Beasts do not; Man is weary of what he has, and
torments his Life with various Desires, where Beasts are contented with what
they have; Man repines at what is past, hates the present, and is affrighted at
what is to come, where Beasts content themselves with what is, and what must
be; Man hates Ease, and yet is weary of Business; Man is weary of Time, and yet
repines that he has not Enough; Man loves himself, and yet does all to hurt
himself, where Beasts are wise only to their own good: for Man makes himself a
trouble, where Beasts strive to take away trouble; Men run into Dangers, Beasts
avoid them; Man troubles himself with what the Sense is not capable of, when
Beasts content themselves with their Sense, and seek no further than what
Nature directs, with the just measure of the pleasure of their Sense, and no
more; Beasts seek not after vain Desires, or Impossibilities, but that which
may be had; they do not backbite or slander; they raise not false Reports,
their Love is as plain as Nature taught; they have no seeming Grief; they make
no Sacrifice to false Gods, nor promise Vows they never perform; they teach no
Doctrine to delude, nor worship Gods they do not know.

Passion and Appetite of Beasts.
SOme say, Beasts have no Despair or trouble in Mind; but we find by
experience, they will be Mad, and we know not from whence the Cause proceeds,
whether from the Body, or Mind; then we find by experience, that they be
Jealous, Amorous, Revengefull, Spightfull, Deceitful, Treacherous, and
Theevish, they will steal one from another; Again, they say there is no
Injustice in Beasts, yet what greater Injustice can there be among Men, than
there will be among Dogs? for one Dog shall come, and take another Dogs Bone
from him, although that Bone was given him by Man for a Reward of some good
Service done by him for his Master; Again, what Ambition is there amongst
Beasts? for one Horse, striving to outrun another, will run so fast, until it
be near dead; and so the like of Dogs: Then what Envy is there amongst them,
that if any Strangers, although of their own kind, come amongst them, they will
beat them away, or kill them? Then what Covetousness is there amongst them, to
hoard and lay up? but this we call Providence in Beasts, and only Coverousness
in Man; and so for Birds also: Then what Pride is there amongst them? as we may
perceive in Peacocks', Turky-cocks, Horses, and many others, and we can guess
at Pride but by the Outward Carriage in Men, so in Beasts: Then they say,
Beasts are Temperate, and full of Moderation, and that they never surfeit
themselves with Excess, nor drink, nor commit Adultery; and yet how often have
we seen Pigeons break their Crops with their eating? and Dogs and Cats so to
over charge their Stomachs with eating, as they are forced to vomit it up
again? and many Creatures will burst themselves: And what Man can or will be
more drunk than the Ape, if he can got wherewithal to be drunk? And we find
few Beasts that will refuse good Liquor, when it is given them, as Horses,
Dogs, and the like; and if they had as much as was proportionable to their
Bodies, they would be drunk as often as Men; and believe it, if there were
Ponds of Wine, as well as of Water, they would drink of the Wine, and leave the
Water; and if they had those Meats that Men call Delicious, they would be as
Luxurious, and as great Epicures, as Man; for most Creatures love sweet things,
which shows them Lickerish; besides, Birds will choose the best Fruits in a
Garden to eat of; and they love Savoury-meat, for Pigeons will pick holes in
Walls for Saltpeter, and many the like Examples; and that which we call
Adultery and Fornication in Men, is common among Beasts, for every Bird and
Beast will choose his Mate to breed on; but yet not contented with one, they
will strive to take each others Mate away, at least make use of them; and how
often do Beasts with Beasts, and Birds with Birds, fall out about it, and beat
one another, and many times kill one another in the Quarrel? Thus Beasts commit
Adultery, as well as Men, if there had been a Law against it; howsoever, they
are false in their Loves, and are as Jealous as Men, in taking each others
Mate, or making Love to each other, as well as Men and their Wives; besides
they will make use of their own Breed, which few Nations will do among Men.
Then they say, Beasts have no judgment which to choose and distinguish; but we
find Beasts can choose the warmest and safest Habitations; then we see Hounds,
that they will smell first one way, then another, but never stay to sent the
third way, but run on, as judging of Necessity the Hare must run that way,
having no other way left, which is Logic; Besides, all Animals that pursue, or
are pursued, show great Judgment and Wit, both in the choice of their way, and
the executing of the Pursuit; and the like have those that are pursued, in
avoiding the places of Danger, and choosing the places of Security, if there be
any to be found: And what has more Judgment than the Bears going backward to
her Den? Besides, Beasts know by sight how to distinguish betwixt Friends and
Foes; Besides, what Judgment do Birds show, when they fly in a pointed Figure
to cut the Air, that their flight may be easy? Then they say, they have no
Compassion; but we see they will bury their Dead, and help one another in
Distress, or at least do their endeavor; as a Hog, that is a Creature that
shows as little Good Nature as any Creature, yet when a Dog bites one of them
by the Ear, and the Hog cries out, all the rest of the Hogs, that are within
hearing, will come running to the rescue, although they do nothing but grunt
when they come; and though they can do their fellow Hog no good, yet it shows a
good will. And again, they say they have no Grief; and yet we see daily, how
they will mourn for their Young, or the absence of their Mates; and the Turtle
Dove seems never to be comforted, but dies for Grief. Then they say, Beasts
have no Memory, or Remembrance; which if they had not, how should they return
to their Holes, or Nests, when they are once gone out? And there are many
Creatures, if they were carried many hundred miles, let them be but loose, and
at their Liberty, and they will return to their first Habitation; wherefore
they are forced to muffle many Creatures, that they may not see which way they
go, because they should not know how to return. Then, that they are not
Sociable, nor delight in Society; but we see they will play and sport with one
another; and Sheep love Company so well, that they will not thrive, nor grow,
but where there are great Flocks of them together. Then, that they have not
Fancy; but we see that Nightingales have great Fancy in the variety of their
Tones and Notes, and their Invention in many things beyond the Invention of
Man. Thus there is no Virtue, nor Vice, as Men call them, but may be found in
other Creatures as well as man, but only we give our Knowledge proper Names,
and those none. Again, they say there is no War nor Tyranny, in other Creatures
or Animals, but man; yet certain there are many other Animals more Tyrannical
and Cruel even to their own kind, than man, and will take as heavy a Revenge
one upon another, and love Superiority and Power; will not the Cocks fight as
fiercely and cruelly one with another for Preheminency, as men? so Bulls
against Bulls. They say men have Command over Beasts, but it is as some men
have Command over others, that is when they have more Power, as Strength of
Body, or advantage of help, either of Numbers, Place, or Time.

The Actions of Beasts.
THough Beasts be apter for some Actions than Men, yet they are not made
capable to exercise all in general, as Running, Leaping, Jumping, Drawing,
Driving, Heaving, Holding, That not any one Beast shall have so many several
Motions as Man has.
Staying, Darting, Digging, Striking, Grasping, Cutting, Peircing, Diving,
Rolling, Wreathing or Twisting Backwards, Forwards, Sideway, Upward, Downward,
turning their Joints any way, as man can do; Besides, what curious Motions can
Man move his Fingers to, and what subtle Measures his Feer, which no other
Creature can do the like; Thus every Member of Man is prompt, ready, and fitted
for Action; which makes him so industrious and inventive, as he becomes so
proud thereby, that he thinks himself a petty God; and yet all his Excellency
lies in his Outward Shape, which is not complete, but all his Inward is like to
Beasts; Wherefore Beasts might have been as capable as man, if his outward
Shape had been according; so that one may almost think, that the Soul is the
outward Figure of a man's Body.

Of Birds.
ALL Birds are full of Spirit, and have more ingenious Fancies than Beasts, as
we may see by their curious building of their Nests, in providing for their
Young, in avoiding great Storms, in choosing the best Seasons, as by shifting
their Habitation, and in their flying in a pointed Figure which cuts or
peirceth the Air, which makes the Passage easy, and so in many other things of
the like Nature; But the Reason seems to be because the chief Region they live
in (which is Air) is pure and serene, when Beasts live altogether on the Earth,
where the Air about is more Gross by reason of continual thick Vapors that
issue out; but the Region wherein Birds fly, is clarified by the Sun, which
makes the spirits of Birds more refined, subtle, and more lively, or
cheerful; For all Beasts are heavy, and dull in comparison of Birds, having
not Wings to fly into the serene Air; But Beasts seem to have as much solid
Judgment, and as clear Understandings as Birds, and as providently careful of
their Subsistence and safty, both for their Young and themselves, as Birds; But
Birds have more Curiosity, Fancy and Chearfullness than Beasts, or indeed than
Men; for they are always chirping and singing, hopping and flying about, but
Beasts are like Grave, Formal, and Solid Common-Wealths-men, and Birds like
elevated Poets.

Of the Wooing of Beasts and Birds.
IT is not only the Spring time that makes Birds sing and chatter, but it is
their Wooing, and striving to please their Mistrisses and Lovers; for most
Creatures keep a Noise and Dance when they Woo, as striving to express their
Affections: for the Noise of other Creatures is as much as making Verses by Men
to their Mistrisses; for those Noises are the several Languages to express
themselves, whereby they understand one another, as Men.

Of Passions.
THE Passions of the Mind, are like the Humors of the Body; for all Bodies
have Choler, Melancholy, and Phlegm, nor could it be nourished without them; so
the Mind has many Passions, which without would be like a Stone; so that there
is no Humor of the Body, or Passion of the Mind, but is good, if moderately
bounded and properly placed; but it is the Excess of the Humors and Passion
that destroies the Body and Mind; but the equal Ingredients of Humors make a
strong Body, and an equal Composure of Passions, makes a Happy and a Noble Mind.

Of Appetite and Passion.
ALL natural Appetites are within Limits, and all unnatural Appetites are
without Limit, and there is nothing more against Nature than Violence,
wherefore Man is the greatest Enemy to Nature; for natural Passion, or Action,
or Appetite are not Violent, Violence being Artificial or Extravagant, not
Natural, which is caused by Imagination, Opinions, Examples, and Conversation,
which persuade Man to those Appetites which Violence does work upon.

Of Like and Dislike.
WE receive Like and Dislike as soon as we receive our Senses, which is Life;
for when a Child is quick in the Womb, Pain grieves it, and Ease pleases it;
but Like and Dislike are not perfect Passions; for though they are the
Foundation of Love and Hate, from which all Passions spring by the old
Opinions, yet are they not perfect Love or Hate; Besides, there is a difference
betwixt Love, Liking, and Fondness; for although Love has a liking, and is
fond of what it places it self upon, yet Liking and Fondness have not always
Love; for true Love is unalterable, when the other two are subject to Variety,
for true Love is lead by Reason, and strengthened by Virtue.

Of Self-Love.
SElf love is the ground from whence springs all Endeavors and Industry, Noble
Qualities, Honorable Actions, Friendships, Charity, and Piety, and is the cause
of all Passions, Affections Vices and Virtues; for we do nothing, or think not
of any thing, but has a reference to our selves in one kind or other, either
in things Divine, Humane, or Natural; for if we part with Life, which is the
chiefest good to Mankind, it is because we think in Death there is less Pain
than in Life, without that we part with Life for; and if we endure Torment
which is worse than Death, for any Thing, or Opinion, it is because our Delight
of what we suffer for, is beyond all Pains; which Delight proceeds from
Self-Love, and Self-Love is the strongest Motion of the Mind; for it strives to
attract all Delight, and gathers together, like the Sun Beams, in one Point, as
with a Glass, wherewith it sets all one fire; So Self-Love infires the Mind,
which makes it Subtle and Active, and sometimes Raging, Violent and Mad; and as
it is the First that seiseth on us, so it is the Last that parts from us; and
though Reason should be the Judge of the Mind, yet Self-Love is the Tyrant
which makes the State of the Mind unhappy; for it is so partially Covetous,
that it desires more than all, and is contented with nothing, which makes it
many times grow Furious, even to the ruin of its own Monarchy.

Of Love.
LOVE is accounted, of all the Passions, the pleasantest and delightfullest,
and yet there is no Passion Tyranniseth so much as Love; for it is not a return
of the like, though it come in an Equal Measure, that can temper it, nor Hate
that can kill it, nor Absence that can weaken it, nor Threats that can affright
it, nor Power that can beat it off, for it delivers up it self, and it will
abide with what it loves; Neither is it like other Passions; for Anger,
although violent, is short; Hate cease with the Cause; Ambition dies, when
Hopes are gone; Fear is helped by Security; Absence or Reproach of others cures
Envy, but nothing lessens or takes away from pure Love; for the Pain increases
with the Affection, and the Affection with Time; for the elder it grows, the
stronger it becomes; I mean not Foolish and Fond Love, for Inconstancy is the
Physician to that; But firm and pure Love, it is oppressed with all other
Passions, for other Passions are but one against one, but Love is Fired with
Ambition, Rubbed with Anger, Torn with Fear, Crampt with Envy, Wounded with
Jealousy, so that it Mourns more than it Joys; This Passion makes Labor a a
Recreation, Pain Easy, and Death pleasant, when it brings any benefit to the
Beloved: And though Self-Love be the Ground from whence the love of other
things springs, yet it lives in the thing beloved, and dies for the thing
beloved, to please it self; much Love contracts the Mind, and makes all things
little and narrow but what it loves; those that love are dead to themselves,
and live in those are their Beloved; for the Desires of the Beloved, are the
Desires of the Lover, let them be good or bad; for though all Love is from
Self-Love, yet at last it Unthrones and dispossesseth it self, and places the
Beloved in its Rome.

We cannot always love our selves.
WE cannot have the purity of Love to our selves, unless we were perfect; for
where there are vain Opinions, and false Imaginations, unsound Understandings,
and various Passions, which make us unconstant to our selves; for though we do
not absolutely hate our selves, yet we grow weary of our selves, and dislike
our selves for many things; so many times we seek to destroy our selves, by
taking our Lives away, as those that murder themselves; yet the nearest
perfection of Love is Self-love, because it is the Original of all other
Passionss

There is no perfect Love or Hate in Humanity.
THE reason why there can be no perfect Love or Hate in this World, is, because
all things are subject to change and alter; for at whatsoever is in the World
we may take such an Exception, that we may come to hate that which we seemed
passionatly to love, and to love that which we seem violently to hate; for
perfect Love or Hate must come from chosen Opinions of Good or Bad, either to
love Good or hate Evil, as it is natural, if there be any evil in Nature, or
in relation to our selves, as we conceive to do us Good or Hurt; for we cannot
truly love or hate, until we can distinguish between Good or Evil; but to
speak truly, we cannot love or hate, until we perfectly know the Nature and
Essence of what we love or hate, which is impossible: for who knows the Essence
of any one thing in the World? and what is more unknown than the Nature of Man,
either by themselves, or others, which is always subject to Alterations? And
since nothing can be known, we cannot truly love or hate, for Knowledge is
required to the establishment of either; but the Inconstancy of Man is such, as
he esteems, and despises one thing in a Moment.

Of Envy.
ENvy, they say, is out of Self-love, which cannot endure the Light of Good
Fortune to shine upon any House but its own; yet it seems strange, that
Self-love should become its own Hell; for who can say in reason, a Man in love
to his Body, racks it so, as it never comes to its strength again; so does an
Envious Man to his Mind: But Envious Men are like them that had rather please
their Palats, than abstain for Health; so they had rather see the Ruin of
those they Envy, than to have Prosperity themselves.

Of Natural Fears.
AS the Sword gets Power, so Fear maintains Power: for Fear makes Laws, and
Laws are Rules to keep Peace. Fear subjects the Minds of Men, and makes them
submiss, and makes them to do Right to one another, for fear others should do
Wrong to them. Fear makes Carefulness, and is a Watchtower for a Man's Safety.
Fear makes Order, Order makes Strength, and Strength maintains Power; for a
Body out of Order is weak, and is subject to be overcom. I mean not a Cowardly
and Servile Fear, to quit his Right, but a Noble Fear, to keep his Own: for as
Base Fear makes Knaves, so Noble Fear makes Honest Men, as not to dare to do a
Wrong: for as Base Fear is the ground of Cowardliness, so Noble Fear is the
ground of Valor; for a Valiant Man is so afraid to lose his Honor, as he will
adventure his Life; a Coward is so afraid to lose his Life, as he will
adventure his Honor. Base Fear distracts, Noble Far unites. Fear makes
Devotion, and Devotion breeds Love; so it is the Parent and Child to Love, as
to breed it, and obey it; And Security weakens Power; for Security makes
Carelessness, and Carelessness makes Disorder, and Disorder makes Confusion.
Besides, what States, nay what private Families, are without private Spies, to
find out what weakens? and no sooner found, but discovered to our Enemies, and
an Enemy will lose no known Advantage; Besides, Opportunity makes Enemies, when
Care not only keeps out Enemies, but makes Friends; for Fear makes a Wise
Conduct, when Security brings a Disorderly Fear.

Of Revenge for Ill Words.
IT is the greatest Dishonor for a Man to be called a Coward, for a Woman to
be called a Whore; and nothing will satisfy a Man that is called a Coward, but
the Life of him that does it, so Tender is he of his Honor, and so Revengefull
does the Loss make him: But a Woman can give no Honorable Revenge; if she be
disgraced with Words, she must only mourn over her Loss of Honor; she may
weep Funeral-tears over it, or curse or sigh for it; but when it is once Dead,
it has no Resurrection.

Of the Passions of Love and Hate, and of good and bad Dispositions.
THere are but two Parent-Passions, as Love and Hate, from whence all the rest
are begot, or derived.

Also there are but two Parent-Dispositions in the Body, the one good, the
other bad, from whence Dispositions are begot, or derived.

A good Disposition is caused by an equal Temper of the Constitution of the
Body, and an orderly Habit belonging thereunto; also when the Humors therein
be fresh, sweet, clear, and thin.

A bad Disposition is caused from an unequal Temper of the Body, and a
disorderly Habit belonging thereunto; also when the Humor is gross, muddy,
corrupt, and full of malignity.

But Love and Hate are created in the Mind, increased, and abated by
Imaginations, Conceptions, Opinions, Reason, Understanding, and Will.

But those two Parent-Passions and Dispositions do so resemble one another, as
they are often times mistaken, being taken one for another.

When the inbred Humors of the Body produce one kind, and the Nature of the
Mind another.

Of a Hating Disposition, or a Passionate Hate.
THere is a difference betwixt a Hating Disposition, and a Passionate Hate.

A Hating Disposition is produced from a Weak Constitution of Body, and an
overflowing of Malignant Humors, which rise like a High Tide, which cause an
Aversion, Loathing, or Nauseousness to their Object or Subject. From this
Disposition proceeds Frights and Fears, Soundings and Faintings, as at the
sight of what they hate; but when it is against their own kind, it produces
Malicious Thoughts, Slandering Words, and Mischievous Actions.

But Passionate Hate makes open War, and only pursues that which it thinks is
Evil; and is the Champion of Virtue, the Sword of Justice, the Guard and
Protector of Innocents, and the Pillar of Commonwealths.

Of Loving Dispositions, and Passionate Love.
THere is a Loving Disposition, and the Passion of Love. This Loving
Disposition proceeds from Moist Humors, and a Sanguine Constitution, which
makes the Disposition facile, or pitiful, tenderhearted (as we say) and
Amorously kind. From this Disposition Tears flow often through the Eyes, large
Professions and Protestations, fond Embracements, kind Words, and dear
Friendships, as long as it lasts, but dissolved upon every small Occasion, and
never fails to break all to pieces, and those pieces to rise up as Enemies, if
any Misfortune comes.

But Passionate Love professes but a Little, and promises Nothing; but will
endure all Torments, and dye Millions of several ways, if it had so many Lives
to give, for what is loves.

Of Amorous Love.
AMorous Dispositions are a Mullet, and an Extravagancy of Nature, got betwixt
the Humors of the Body, and the Passions of the Mind: for the Passions of the
Mind, and the Dispositions of the Body, although they be taken by the Ignorant
for one and the same, having some resemblance, as a Horse, and an Ass, yet they
are of two several kinds, and different Natures; the one being Industrious,
Courageous, Generous, Noble, and Free; the other, Slothful, Fearful, and fit
for Slavery: But the Passions of the Mind are Rational, the Humors of the
Body, Bestial; for Lust is the Natural Breed of a Sluggish Body, Pure Love the
Natural Breed of a Rational Soul: But Amorosity is begot betwixt both, being
not so foul as Lust, nor so pure as Love, but is of a mixed nature; and like
Mules, that produce no Creature, so Amorosity neither produces a Noble
Offspring from the Mind, nor seldom any Issue from the Body; for it is rather
a whining Contemplation, than a real Act.

Of a Choleric Disposition, and a Choleric Passion.
THere is a difference betwixt a Choleric Disposition, and a Choleric Passion.

A Choleric Disposition proceeds from a dry hot Constitution, and a bitter or
salt Humor, that is bred in the Body either by an evil habit of the Liver and
Stomach, or an unwholesome Diet: This produces a froward Disposition, being
always a Disquiet to it self, which causes the Words to be cross, the Voice to
be loud, the Countenance to be stern, and the Behavior ruff and rude.

But a Choleric Passion is the Fire of the Mind, giving Heat to the Thoughts,
which raises Ambition, and gives Courage to the Active, Vigor to the Strong,
Quickness to the Words, Confidence to the Countenance, with a Resolved
Behavior, etc.

The Sympathy of the Spirits.
THere are Sympathies of Sensitive Spirits, and Rational Spirits; the one
proceeds from the Body, the other from the Mind, or Soul; the one is Fondness,
the other is Love; this makes Fondness last no longer than the Senses are
filled, which every Sense is not only capable of a Satisfaction of every
particular Object, but an overflowing, even to a Surfeit, and Dislike; but an
Affection that is made by the Sympathy of the Rational Spirits, which is Love,
dwells in the Soul, and is never satisfied; but the more it receives, the more
it desires; so that this Sympathy is the Infinite of Loves Eternity.

Of the offering up of Life.
THere are few that will freely offer up their Lives to take a certain Death;
yet there be three sorts that are the likeliest to do it, as, the Ambitious,
the Conscientious, and Lovers; the Ambitious, Fame persuades them; the
Conscientious, Fear and Hope persuades them; Lovers, Love persuades them;
Ambition seeks Fame, Fame seeks Applause, Applause seeks Action, Action seeks
Honor, Honor seeks Danger, Danger seeks Death; Fear and Hope seek Religion,
Religion seeks Faith, Faith seeks Martyrdom, Martyrdom seeks Death; Love
seeks Ease, Ease seeks Peace, Peace seeks Rest, Rest seeks Death. Those that
dye for unlawful Desires, or in desperate Fury, or the like, these deserve
Pity, and Tears of Sorrow, because their Death was their Dishonor; but to dye
for their Country, their Religion, Friends, or Chastity, there Tears should be
wiped from all Eyes, and Acclamations of Joy should ring for the Renown of such
Constant Virtue, as to seal it with Voluntary Death, where Life was only a
Cover to hide it; besides, the Spirits they beget, by example, they give: but
this kind of Valor has few Companions.

The yielding up Life.
A Valiant Man will not wilfully part with his Life, nor yet unjustly keep it;
but if his God, his Country, or his Friend, require it, he willingly offers it
up as a Sacrifice upon the Altar of Honor; when Desperateness throws his Life
into the Jaws of Death for a Vainglorious Fame.

The Difference of killing themselves, and yielding up of Life.
THere are more kill themselves, than willingly offer up their Lives; because
those that offer up their Lives, are as a Sacrifice, or Atonement for the good
of one another, more than themselves; and would rather live than dye, could
they keep their Life with Honor: but their Death being a Rescue to something,
as they think, which is more worthy than their Life, they willingly yield it
up; where those that kill themselves, do it out of Fear of a Miserable Life:
for those do deliver up their Lives Freely and Nobly, that give it, not to
avoid worse Inconveniences to themselves, as out of Poverty, Pain, Fear, or
Disgrace, or the like, but those that leave Health, Wealth, Strength, Honors,
Friends, and all other Worldly Pleasures.

The difference between Courage and Valor.
THere is a great difference between Courage and Valor; for though Valor is
always Courageous, yet Courage is not always Valiant; for true Valor is
built upon Consideration, and walled about with Honesty, and kept in by Fear;
for true Valor dares not do a Wrong; where Courage only follows Appetite, and
never considers whether it be Right or Wrong. Thus Wilfullness and Covetousness
are the Spur to Courage, and Justice to Valor; Courage inhabits Beasts, Valor
only Men.

Of True Valor.
ALL those that fight, are not Valiant; but all that are Valiant, will fight at
fit times: for Valor is a True Understanding for what to fight for. A Valiant
Man will not fight with a Mad Man, a Drunken Man, or a Coward, but to defend
himself; nor with those that are Weak and Infirm, as with Women, Sick Folks,
and Children; for a Valiant Man fights only in a Just Cause, not unto an Ill
End; and though a Valiant Man will not take any Unworthy or Base Advantage on
his Enemy, yet he will take all Honest Advantages and Opportunities. But every
one (as I said) that will fight, is not Valiant; for some fight through Fear,
as when they cannot avoid the Danger of an Enemy, or when they are forced by
Command of Authority to fight, or else they are sure to be punished with a
certain Death; some for Shame, some for Example, some for Revenge, some for
Covetousness, some out of Despair, some for one thing, some for another: but
True Valor fights for no other End but Honor.

Of Fortitude.
FOrtitude of the Mind we call Valor, when it is put into Action; and in
Suffering, we call it Patience. This Fortitude is led by two, Prudence, and
Justice; it is always accompanied with Noble and Heroic Thoughts, but it is
often mistaken, and in her room takes Desperateness, or Fury, which is always
led with Rashness and Indiscretion, and is accompanied with Revengefull,
Malicious, and Base Actions. But Valor, the Hand of Fortitude, never strikes,
but in a Noble Quarrel: for they are not always Valiant that dare fight, but
those that fight for Truth and Rights sake, and to defend Innocence from
devouring Wrong: but Desperateness follows its Appetite, and the Hands of
Rashness strike at all. But there is no Motion of the Mind that has more
consideration than Fortitude, nor freer from Extravagancies of Anger or Hate,
nor loves Life better, nor more desirous to be from Scars, or shuns Danger
more, than True Valor: for true Fortitude cares not to be known so much to
others, as to be satisfied in it self, with Noble Thoughts, and Worthy Actions,
either to Act Gallantly, or to Suffer Patiently. Neither is True Valor
exempted from Fear, for it is afraid of all Dishonor; and though a Valiant Man
is not afraid to lose his Life, yet he freely offers it to defend his Honor,
his Friends, Country, and Religion. Thus Valor is not free from Fear, but
places it upon fit Subjects or Objects.

Of Exceptions.
THere are some Humors of the Mind, although they are not Vices, yet they are
Veils to Virtue, whereof Exception is one: for there are few Actions that are
more difficult than to keep off Exceptions; and there is no Humout in Man more
apt, than to take Exceptions: for Suspicion will fly upon every thing, and
sometimes upon nothing, but by Opinions and Interpretations. Besides, there is
no Man so exact, but a Stander by may find some Faults at one time or other,
either at his Words, Actions, or Behavior, especially if Censorious; And there
is no surer way to judge of a Fool from a Wise Man, than by Exceptions: for a
Wise Man takes few Exceptions, but makes the best of all things, but a Fool
turns all things to the worst sense, and thinks that all things he meets, have
a design to affront him, which makes all his Thoughts full of Murmr and
Discontent; and there is an Old Saying, A Word is enough to the Wise, so one
may say, A Word is enough to a Fool, as to trouble all the Company he keeps, or
comes into; but the World is only scattered with Wise Men, and filled with
Fools, which makes the Wise cautious; for though they will not Flatter, yet for
quietness sake they are forced to dandle and dance the Humors of Fools upon
the Tongue of Fair Words.

What Natures bar Friendship, and what make it.
THere are few Men can be true Friends; A Cautious Man, a Politician, a
Casuist, a Jealous and an Amorous Man, a Choleric and Exceptious, a Facile, a
False, and Envious, a Revengefull, nor a Coward, or Fearful Man, for all their
Humors turn the Byas of Friendship another way: Wherefore a Friend must be
Wise, Honest, Valiant, Generous, Constant, Sweet, and Patient Man. But these
Virtues seldom meet in one Person, which makes so many Professions, and so few
Performances in Friendships: yet most think they could be Perfect Friends,
although nothing harder to perform: for true Friendships are neither confirmed,
nor known, but in Extremities, and those Extremities are seldom put in use,
which makes Friendships like Bonds that are unsealed: Neither can a Man so
truly know himself, much less another, as to be assured of having a true and a
constant Friend, but by being, one himself; for a Man may be a Friend in one
Extremity, and an Enemy in the next; nay, a Man may be a Friend a thousand
years, and in as many Extremities (if it were possible) and yet one minute may
alter him; so Various and Inconstant are the Passions and Affections of Men,
and so little do they know themselves, as not only to be willing to dye, but
to have the Courage to endure all the Torments that Life can bear, and yet at
some other times of their Lives are so fearful, as they will part from that
which is most dear, but for hopes of Life, or ease from Pain, besides other
several Accidents of less Consequence than Life, that may cross Friendship;
which makes an Impossibility of Friendship in this World, unless a Man had an
absolute power over himself, or that he had an unalterable Nature, which is
only in the Society of Angels, and not in the Friendships of Men. But those
that may be accounted Friends amongst Mankind, are those that do timely
Courtesies; and to choose Friends otherwise, is out of a foolish and affected
Humor; for one cannot say, I will choose me a Friend for Conversation only,
but that is no Friendship that is but a Companion; so an Acquaintance, and a
Companion, and a Friend, are several: for I may have an Acquaintance with one,
and yet not my Companion; and my Companion, and not my Friend; but a Friend
makes the Triangle.

Of Friendship.
IT is said, that True Friendship of Men is an Union of Spirits; so as it is
our Minds that make Friendship, our Senses do not, although they are the Doors
that let in that Knowledge which causes that Friendship; but our Senses have
not the power to keep a Friendship; for there was never any of our Senses that
could constantly be unwearied of any one Subject or Object, having naturally a
various quality, which makes them great Admirers, but uncertain Lovers and
Friends; neither is it altogether the Strength of Love, but the Length, that
makes a perfect Friendship.

Friendship of Kings.
SOme say that Kings are unhappy, because they cannot have a Bosome-friend, for
there must be some Equality for True Friendship; and a Prince makes himself a
Subject, or his Subject as great as himself, in making particular Friendships,
which may cause Danger to his Person and State. But a King that has Loyal
Subjects, wants no Friend. But, say they, a Friend is to open and disburthen
the Thoughts from his Heart of all Joys, Griefs, and Secrets, which are not so
convenient or satisfactory to be published to all his Loyal Subjects; To all
which may be answered, that his Privy Council is a Secret Friend, where he may
and ought to disburthen his Mind, being an united Body, or should be so; which
will increase his Joys with their Joys, and ease his Griefs with their Counsel,
which is the part of a Friend: So as a Privy Council to Kings, is as a Private
Friend to another Man.

Friendship of Parents and Children.
IT is said, Parents and Children cannot have Friendship; for they must have no
ties of Nature, but be Voluntary and Free; where in Parents it is rather a Self
love, or Selfinterest, than a clear Friendship: Where I answer, that there can
be no Friendship, but proceeds from Self-love and Interest; for their delight
is in their Friend; and to dye for a Friend, is because they cannot live
without him. Besides, say they, there is a Bar that hinders the Friendship of
Parents and Children, which is, the Duty and Respect which ought to be in the
Child toward the Parent, and a Reservedness of the Father to the Child: But to
my thinking, it is a strange Reason, that Duty and Respect should hinder
Friendship, as if Friendship were built upon an open Rudeness; But certainly
True Love, which is that which makes Dear Friendships, takes, more pleasure to
be Commanded, and to Obey those they love, than to Command, and be Obeyed.
Besides, Respect hinders not the disclosing, or the receiving into the Mind, or
helping with their Bodies or Estates, or parting with Life, which are the Acts
of Friendship; For I take Duty and Obedience to be from the Mind, as consenting
to their Desires, and respect as toward the Body; by an humble presenting of
it self: But a Reservedness of the Parent to the Child, is rather a proud
Insulting, and Love of Authority, than out of Love or Consideration for their
good, or to keep their Natural Affection; for it must be a very Ill Nature,
that sweet and kind Persuasions, free and open Relations, seasonable and secret
Counsellings, willing and reasonable Actions, shall not only keep the Natural
Love, as from the Child to the Parent, but tie a perfect Friendship, as from
Man to Man; unless you will say, there can be no perfect Friendship, except
there be an equality of their Ages, which indeed a Child and a Parent can never
be even in. But Parents are so far from making of Friendship with their
Children, as they know less, and are more unacquainted with them, than with
Strangers, by their reserved Formalities; or else they are so rudely Familiar
with their Children, as makes their Children rudely Familiar with them; in
which kind of Natures and Humors can be no ties of Friendship, neither with
their own, nor Strangers.

Of Madness in general.
THere are more that run Mad for the loss of Hope, than for the loss of what
they have Enjoyed; as for example, How many have run Mad for the loss of their
Servant, or Mistress which are called Lovers? but few or none for their
Husbands or Wives; every Town, or Kingdom at least, may be an Example of the
first, but few in the whole World to be heard of the last. And how many Parents
have run Mad for the loss of their Children, because they have lost the hopes
of their Perfections, or Excellencies, which Time might have brought forth,
that might have been an Honor to their Name and Posterity, which by Death were
cut off? So as it is not so much for the present Comfort they lost in their
Child; for few Parents make their Children their only or chief Society; but
the expectation of the Future being lost, is that they most commonly run Mad
for; for there are none that wish not themselves in a good Condition; and there
are very few, that not only wish themselves in a better Condition, though they
have no cause to complain, but hope to be so; and where the Hopes are cut off,
and the Desires remain, they must needs grow Impatient, and Impatiency grows
Extravagant, and Extravagancy is Madness. But how seldom is it heard, that
Children run Mad for their Parents? the reason is, because there is little
hopes from them, but of their Estates, or Titles, if they have any; for Men
never consider so much what is past, as what is to come, unless it be to
compare the past time with the present, that they might guess at the Future: So
that there is nothing to hope from Parents, because all things are past from
them; for Men joy more in looking forward through their Posterity, than in
looking back upon their Ancestors; the one is a Contemplation of Life, the
other but a Contemplation of Death; and though they are sometimes proud of
their Forefathers worthy Actions, yet they take more delight in the hopes of
their own Posterity. And when Men grow Mad for the loss of their Estates, it is
not for what they have enjoyed, but for what they would, or might have enjoyed,
had not Ill Fortune been, but now they cannot. And when Men fall Mad through
Despair, it is because they have no hopes of Heaven: So that Hope is the Life
of Man's Thoughts, and the Ground of his Actions; it makes Piety in the Church,
and Industry in the Commonwealth; where the want of it is a Death in Life.

An Epistle to the Unbelieving Readers in Natural Philosophy.
MANY say, That in Natural Philosophy nothing is to be known, not the Cause of
any one thing; which I cannot persuade my self is Truth: for if we know
Effects, we must needs know Causes, by reason Effects are the Causes of
Effects; and if we can know but one Effect, it is a hundred to one but we shall
know how to produce more Effects thereby.

Secondly, That Natural Philosophy is an endless Study, without any profitable
Advantage: but I may answer, That there is no Art nor Science but is produced
thereby; if we will, without Partiality, consider from whence they were derived.

Thirdly, That it is impossible that any thing should be known in Natural
Philosophy, by reason it is so obscure, and hid from the knowledge of Mankind:
I answer, That it is impossible that Nature should perfectly understand, and
absolutely know her self, because she is Infinite, much less can any of her
Works know her; yet it does not follow, that nothing can be known; As for
example, There are several parts of the World discovered, yet it is most
likely, not all, nor may be never shall be; yet most think, that all the World
is found, because Drake and Cavendish went in a Circular Line, until they came
to that place from whence they set out at first; and I am confident, that most
of all Writers thought all the World was known unto them, before the
West Indies were discovered; and the Man that discovered it in his Brain,
before he traveled on the Navigable Sea, and offered it to King Henry the
Seventh, was slighted by him as a Foolish Fellow, nor his Intelligence
believed; and no question there were many that laughed at him, as a Vain Fool;
others pitied him, as thinking him Mad; and others scorned him, as a Cheating
Fellow, that would have cosened the King of England of a Sum of Money: but the
Spanish Queen, being then wiser than the rest, employed him, and adventured a
great Sum of Money to set him forth in his Voyage, which when the Success was
according to the Man's Ingenious Brain, and he had brought the Queen the
discovery of the Golden and Silver Mines, for the Spanish Pistols, Then other
Nations envyed the King of Spain, and like a Company of Dogs, which fought for
a Bone, went together by the Ears to share with him. So the Bishop that
declared his opinion of the Antipodes, was not only cried down and exclaimed
against by the Vulgar, which hate all Ingenuity, but Learned Sages stood up
against him, and the Great and Grave Magistrates condemned him as an Atheist
for that Opinion, and for that reason put him from his. Bishopric, and thought
he had Favor, in that his Life was spared; which Opinion has since been found
true by Navigators. But the Ignorant and Unpracticed Brains think all
Impossible that is not known unto them. But put the Case that many went to find
that which can never be found, as they say Natural Philosophy is, yet they
might find in the search, that they did not seek, nor expect, which might prove
very beneficial to them. Or put the case ten thousand should go so many ways
to seek for a Cabinet of precious Jewels, and all should miss of it but one,
shall that one be scorned and laughed at for his Good Fortune, or Industry?
this were a great Injustice: But Ignorance and Envy strive to take off the
gloss of Truth, if they cannot wholly overthrow it. But I, and those that
write, must arm our selves with Negligence against Censure; for my part, I do:
for I verily believe, that Ignorance, and present Envy, will slight my Book;
yet I make no question, when Envy is worn out by Time, but Understanding will
remember me in after Ages, when I am changed from this Life: But I had rather
live in a General Remembrance, than in a Particular Life.

The Worlds Olio. LIB. III. PART II.
Of Philosophy.
THere have been of all Nations, that have troubled their Heads, and spent the
whole time of their Lives, in the study of Philosophy, as Natural and Moral;
the first is of little or no use, only to exercise their Opinions at the
guessing at the Causes of Things, for know them they cannot; the last is a Rule
to a strict Life, which is soon learned, but not so soon practiced, as they
have made it, in the dividing it into so many and numerous parts, having but
four chief Principles, as Justice Prudence or Providence, Fortitude, and
Temperance; Justice is but to consider what one would willingly have another to
do to him, the same to do to another, which is the beginning of a Commonwealth.
Prudence or Providence, is, to observe the Effect of Things, and to compare the
past with the present, as to guess, and so to provide for the Future. Fortitude
is, to suffer with as little Grief as one can, and to act with as little Fear.
Now Temperance is something harder, as to abate the Appetites, and moderate our
Passions: for though there are but two principal ones, as Love, and Hate, yet
there are abstracted from them so many, as would take up a Long Life to know
them after the strict Rules of Temperance. But indeed it is as impossible to be
justly Temperate, as to know the first Causes of all Things; as for example, A
Man loses a Friend, and the Loser must grieve so much, as the merit of the
Loss deserves, and yet no more than will stand with his Constitution, which in
many is impossible: For some, their Constitution is so weak, that the least
Grief destroys them; so that of Necessity he must needs be Intemperate one way,
either for the not sufficient Grief for the merit of his Friend, or too little
care for himself. So for Anger; a Man must be no more angry, than the Affront,
or any Cause of his Anger does deserve; and who shall be Judge, since there is
no Cause or Act that has not some Partiality on its side? and so in all
Passions and Appetites there may be said the like. Therefore he that can keep
himself from Extravagancy, is temperate enough. But there are none that are
more intemperate than Philosophers; first, in their vain Imaginations of
Nature; next, in the difficult and nice Rules of Morality: So that this kind of
Study kills all the Industrious Inventions that are beneficial and Easy for the
Life of Man, and makes one sit only to dye, and not to live. But this kind of
Study is not wholly to be neglected, but used so much, as to balance a Man,
though not to fix him; for Natural Philosophy is to be used as a Delight and
Recreation in Men's Studies, as Poetry is, since they are both but Fictions, and
not a Labor in Man's Life. But many Men make their Study their Graves, and bury
themselves before they are dead. As for Moral Philosophy, I mean only that
part that belongs to every particular Person, not the Politic, that goes to
the framing of Commonwealths, as to make one Man live by another in Peace,
without which no Man can enjoy any thing, or call any thing his own, for they
would run into Hostility, though Community of Men will close into a
Commonwealth for the Safety of each, as Bees and other Creatures do, that
understand not Moral Philosophy, nor have they Grave and Learned Heads, to
frame their Commonwealths.

NAture is the great Chemist of the World, drawing out of the Chaos several
Forms, and extracted Substances; the gross and thicker part goes to the
forming of Solid Bodies, the Fume to Air and Water, the thinnest part to Fire
and Light, the Sense or Spirits to Life.

Of Naturalists.
NAturalists, that search and seek for hidden Causes, are like Chemists, that
search for the Philosophers Stone, wherein they find many excellent and
profitable Medicines, but not the Elixar: So Naturalists find out many
excellent and beneficial Arts, but not the Cause or Principle. Yet we find,
that Nature works not so curiously upon the Essence of Things, as upon the
Corporal Substance: for Nature is but rude in the Minds of Men, and so in other
Creatures, until Community and Art have civilized them, and Experience and
Learning have perfected them.

Of Nature.
NAture is more various in the Shapes, Thoughts, and Colors, than in the
Substance, or Kind of Things; yet for Shapes there are but four grounds, as
High, Low, Thick, and Thin; of Quality, or Essences, she has but four, as
Fire, Water, Air, and Earth; and for Colors, the ground is only Light; and
for Life, she has given only three degrees, as the Life of Growth, the Life
of Sense, and the Life of Reason, which is a Motion belonging to the Mind, the
other two Motions belong to the Corporal Part, and all Life is but Motion; so
that Motion is the Life of Natures Work, and the Work of Natures Life.

The Power of Natural Works.
ALthough Nature has made every thing Good, if it be rightly placed, yet she
has given her Works power of misplacing themselves, which produces Evil
Effects: for that which corrupts Nature, as it were, is the disordered mixture.
But of all her Works, Man has entangled her ways the most by his Arts, which
makes Nature seem Vicious, when most commonly, Man's Curiosity causes his Pain.
But there is nothing that is purely made, and orderly set, by Nature, that has
not a Virtue in it; but by her Creatures mis-applyings, produces a Vice.

Change in Nature.
NAture has not only made Bodies changeable, but Minds; so to have a Constant
Mind, is to be Unnatural; for our Body changes from the first beginning to the
last end, every Minute adds or takes away: so by Nature, we should change every
Minute, since Nature has made nothing to stand at a stay, but to alter as fast
as Time runs; wherefore it is Natural to be in one Mind one minute, and in
another in the next; and yet Men think the Mind Immortal. But the Changes of
Nature are like the Sleights of a Juggler, we see many several Shapes, but
still but one Matter.

Of Natural Wars.
IT seems to me a thing above Nature, that Men are not always in War one
against the other, and that some Estates live in peace, sometimes forty or an
hundred years, nay some above a Thousand (as the Venetians) without Civil
Wars; for the old saying is, So many Men so many Minds; yet they meet all in
Ambitious Desires; and naturaly Self-love seeks and strives for Preheminency
and Command, which all cannot have, and yet submit and obey, which is strange:
But say some, it is Love that Makes, Unites, and Keeps a Commonwealth in
Peace; no says another, it is Fear, and another may say as Tichobrahe the Dane
said of the Sun and Earth; For Ptolomy says that the Sun moves and the Earth
stands still, Copernicus said that the Earth moved and the Sun stood still, and
Tichobrahe took up the third Opinion, to which could be added no more but that
they both moved: So one may say it is both Love and Fear, since those two
Passions most commonly accompany one another. But say they, all things
naturally incline to Peace and Unity, and that War is unnatural, because it
tends to Destruction; but some may say again, that we find Nature has made
nothing but is subject to Preying, Ravening, and Devouring, one thing of
another, and that most things live upon the spoil of another, by the Humors,
Constitutions, and Desires she has given them; for in many things their Lives
cannot subsist or be nourished, but by the Death of other Creatures; So that
Men are not only subject to War upon one another, but all Creatures that Nature
has made, as also the Elements, for what is Thunder, but a War betwixt Heat
and Cold? for Nature, meeting in Contrarieties, must needs Dispute when they
meet, and are never quieted until one part get the upper hand; and though
Numbers make aConsort, yet they must have a Sympathy one to another. Thus all
things are subject to War, yet the Causes are different that provoke them to
it; But Nature would have wanted work, if she had made all things to continue,
and nothing to decay; for Death is as natural as Life; but it seems to be
Natures great Art to make all things subject to War, and yet live in Peace, as
not to make an utter Destruction.

Of Darkness.
DArkness is more powerful than Light, for a little dark Cloud will eclipse
the great light of the Sun; and there would be more Twilight if there were no
Clouds, for the Clouds are like a Screen that hides the Light.

Of the Air.
THE Air is Water as well as the Sea; So that Men, Beasts, and Birds, are all
but kinds of Fishes, for we cannot live without Air, which is rarefied Water;
but it seems we are of a subtiller Sense than Fishes, which makes us require a
thinner Element.

Of Air.
THE Air is, as all other Animal Creatures are, subject to Corruption,
Putrefaction, and Distemper; sometimes in a continual Fever, other times in an
intermitting Fever, sometimes in a Hectic Fever, other times it has shaking
Agues, Wind-Chollcks, and often times Rheumatick and Hydropical: and as the Air
is, so it is apt to infect men's Bodies, by reason that Air is so thin and
subtle, as it enters and intermingles into all things.

Of the Corruptions of the Air.
THE Air is more corrupted in the Spring and the Autumn, than in the Winter and
Summer; for in the Winter it is less corrupted by reason it is more united, as
being congealed by Cold; neither has the Sun that Force, to draw more Vapors
than it can digest; besides, for want of Heat the Pores of the Earth are shut,
where by less Vapors issue out; and in Summer it has a sufficient heat to
concoct what it draws up, or at least it contracts it so, as to keep it from
running into corruption; and the Spring, at the Suns return, opens the Pores of
the Earth, suoking out Vapor there from, which V pour is like the first milk
of a Cow, or the like Udder'd Creature, when they have new cast forth their
Birth, which Milk is all corrupted with Blood and Matter, by reason it has
been so long in the Udder; so likewise the Vapor is corrupted when it is first
drawn as it were by the returning Sun, by reason it wanted Vent and Agitation
to purify it, and as it is ascending it mingles with those Creatures that live
upon the Earth; for the Pores of the Creatures that live upon the Earth, also
open by the springing heat, from whence Vapors like wise do issue from their
Bodies; yet they live by the Air that encompasseth them, as Fishes do in Water,
which if the Water be corrupted, the Fishes dye, caused by the Malignity they
draw in; for though they are not smotherd or choked, as in Frosty weather; yet
could the thinnest Air be so hard and so solidly froze as water which is of a
grosser Body, Man and Beast would be smothered for want of Breath, as Fishes
are in great Frosts; yet many Creatures of the Earth are frozen to death, not
only by having their Limbs Conjealed, Benumbed, and Dead, destroying the
Natural Motions therein; for surely the thinnest Air being congealed, they can
get none to serve for Breath; that is, there is none fit to move the Lungs; for
though some Creatures Lungs require grosser Air than others, and some a finer,
yet Man and Beast I observe, require a middle temper or mixture; for too thin
Air is as unusefull as too gross; so for the Temper, too hot is as hurtful as
too cold; the one scalds or burns the Lungs, the Brain, and the rest of the
inward parts, or sets the Spirits on fire; the other benumbs and stupifies
them, at least obstructs them; but when the Air is putrified and corrupted, it
mingles with the thinner Parts, as the Humors, the Blood and the like, causing
corrupted Diseases and putrifyed Limbs: but as I said, the Spring Vapor, which
is the rising Vapor, is like the Beesting Milk; so the Vapor in Autumn, which
is the falling Vapor, is like Cheese that is ill pressed, or too moist kept,
which corrupts and breeds Maggots; so Vapor being not well clarified or
concocted by the Sun, becomes Malignant.

Of several sorts of Vapor.
THere are many sorts of Vapors, according to the several tempets of those
parts of the Earth they are drawn from; but when they are drawn to such a
height, they all mix, yet seldom so, but that some sort may predominate,
whether salt Vapor, sharp Oil, bitumenous, waterish, or gross and Earthy, as
dull and heavy or more light and Aerie: Thus the Sun, as I say, draws and mixes,
boils and clarifies Vapors; but if there be more than his Heat can overcome,
they corrupt and fall back; and that which is thinnest and purest it turns into
serene Air, the Crude and Flatuous part it turns into Wind, the Watery part
into Rain, the Bitumenous part into Thunder, the Oily part into Lightning or
Meteors, the Scum into Clouds, which servs as wicks of Candles to take Light;
the corrupted part insensibly falls back to the Earth again.

But when the Malignity of the Earth, and the corruption of the Air, and the
distempered Humors of Bodies join together, it causes great and horrible
Plagues, making a general Malignity, and until this Malignity has spent its
strength, with struggling and striving with the strength of Life, it never
cease, and at the last it grows fainter and fainter, until it has no Power.

The several Degrees, or several sorts of Vapor.
AS there is a natural Heat and a natural Moisture, proper and inherent in
every animal Body; so there is a natural Vapor that is produced therefrom, as
a right and natural begotten Child. Or like Chymistrie, where Fire extracts
from grosser Bodies, several degrees of Matter, as Smoke, Oil, Essence, Water,
Salt, and Incipid Dreggs: so the Natural Heat, on Food received, extracts
Vapor, Fat, Blood, Spirits, Sweat, Humors, and Excrements. Now if the Heat be
of an equal temper, and the Limbeck, which is the Stomach, free from Defects,
the Digestion is good, which makes the Extraction pure and effectual; now the
thinnest but strongest Extractions are the Animal or Vital Spirits, the next
thinnest and most powerful is the Vapor, which Vapor is that which reposeth
the Senses, and feeds the Brain, nourishing Imagination, Conception, and
Understanding, and the like, and is the Creator of Fancy and Phantasms; the
Grosser part of Vapor is a Smoke that continually issues out through the
Pores, and the like open passages; which Smoke is a superfluity that serves for
no use, but may do Mischief if it be stopped, choking and smothering Life, or at
least, causes such Distempers as may disorder the whole Body; but the Animal
spirit indeed is a Vapor, which proceeds from the Radical Heat and Moisture of
the Body, wherein, if the Heat be too violent, or the Moisture too gross,
Quenches or Burns them up; and the Reposing Vapor proceeds from the Natural
digesting Heat and Moisture that is in the Body; and the Superfluous Vapor or
Smoke proceeds from the actual Heat or Moisture put into the Body by violent
Motions, or hot Weather, or hot Meats, or moist Meats, or much Meat or Drink:
When these Vapors join to the Natural Vapors of Repose, they cause as it were
dead sleeps, as we see by those that have out Eat or Drank their Natural
Temper; for though much eating will many times hinder Sleep, by reason it makes
the Vapor so gross that it cannot easily flow, yet much Drinking never fails;
for a drunken man will be so strongly asleep that he cannot be awaked; but
indeed the Senses will be drunk as well as the Brain, which causes them to be
as if they were asleep, but are not, only their Strength is for a time taken
away, as being Slack'd or rather as it were drowned; but when strong sleep is
produced by overmuch eating, it is rather an Epilepsie than a natural Sleep,
the Brain being as it were almost sinothered with the thick and full Smoke, and
the Senses choked or strangled therewith; and so will the Senses be in these
Distempers, until they are dispersed or rarefied, either by Time, Motion, or
natural Heat; but Temperance causes sweet, natural, and healthful Sleeps,
being a Vapor that arises from a good Digestion, caused by a Natural Heat and
Moisture; for when the Stomach is too empty, it hinders Sleep as much as when
it is too full.

Of Thunder.
AS Winds make the Clouds in the Air, and the Waves of the Sea to War, and
make a Noise by the beating thereon, so it makes Thunder, for Thunder is
nothing, in my apprehension, but Winds beating upon Christling Drops, which is
Water congealed in the middle Region; for Cold knits the Porous Body into a
more Solid, and Winds that are made by Rarification give it Motion, which
motion makes it powerful, and when this Wind is got above the lower Region,
and flies about it, it drives those Christling Drops against one another, and
makes such a Noise as the Roaring of the Sea, only it is a harder Noise if we
observe, which is, because the Water is Christling in the middle Region, and
not in the Sea; and if we observe, the harder the Thunderclaps are, the less
it rains, and the more it rains the lesser are the Claps, and according as the
heat of the Sun melts and dissolves the Christling Bodies, more or less it
rains.

Of the Motions of the Planets.
THE Spherical Planets are the Wheels to draw up Vapors from the Earth, and
the Sun as a thirsty Throat is refreshed thereby: Besides, every particular
Planet feeds upon each other, though not Corporally as many other Creatures do,
but draw and suck as from each others Breast.

Of Thunder some little difference to the former.
THE reason why it'doth not Thunder in the Winter as in the Summer, is, that
most of the matter that makes Thunder in Summer, is turned into Wind in Winter;
for Water, Air, Wind and Thunder, are all but one Element, only thicker and
thinner; The effects of Water.
for Wind is a condensed Air, and Air a rarefied Water, and thus by Dilating
and Contracting, alter their Forms, and their Properties, which makes that
Matter seem of several Qualities, This commonly is held.
only works different Effects, and these Effects being different by their
several Motions, which give them several Forms, and make External Motions I
mean. The Effect External.
many times a Civil War amongst them, every Form striving to outdo one
another, and often in their striving change their Shape. But Fire being an
Element not subject to change, sometimes parts the Fray, and sometimes sets them
more one against another: for in the Summer the Sun being hot, raises the
Vapor so high that it gets into the Middle Region, and being there condenses
into Wind, and when it is there it seeks a Passage out, and so falls foul
upon the Clouds, beating them about until its Fury and Strength be spent; but
in the Winter the Sunbeams being weak cannot draw the Vapor so high, and so
blows upon the Earth and amongst the lower Clouds, which by crushing them
together, squeeseth out Rain, or breaks them in sunder, which falls down in
Showers; this makes more Rain, and frequenter Storms in Winter than in Summer;
and Thunder in Summer, because it is drawn so high that it cannot easily
return. Thus Wind in the Middle Region causes Thunder, and in the Winter
(going no further than the lower Region) causes Storms; and Lightning may be
the striking of some Clouds that have Bitumenous matter mixed in them, which
like to a Flint do strike With violence of the Wind.
out Fire.

Allegory.
IN the Chemistry of Nature, the Earth is the sixth Salt, the Air the Sulphur,
the Water is the Incipid Phlegm, the Sun or Fire are the Spirits, Light and
Darkness is the Center, Life is the volable Salt, and Death is the Terra
Damnata.

The noise of Water.
WAter being Spherical, of a hollow and Porous Body, the Wind beating thereon,
the Hollowness causes a sound by the Rebounds it makes against the inside or
outside of the Spherical Body, which we call Drops, which being moved either
by the Tides or Winds, are so quick being so small, and apt to move being
round, as the Rebounds are so many and so thick, that the Echoes thereof are
confused, which confusion we call a Roaring of the Waters, as the Roaring of
the Sea.

Of the Motion of the Sea.
THE Reason why the Sea is more apt to move than Freshwaters, is, by the
Saltness; for Salt having an acute quality, does penetrate and divide, and
Water whose property is to intermingle and unite, does strive to join the
divided parts again; this makes it as it were a Perpetual Motion, the one
striving to meet and join, the other to separate and disunite.

The Noise of Winds.
THE Reason the Winds make such a Noise in the Air, as on the Sea, is, that
Clouds are a Condensed Vapor or Air, which Condensed Air is Water, so that
Clouds are as it were a Sea over our Heads; and those Clouds being Waves and
great Billows, when the Wind blows, beating upon them as upon the Sea, makes
the same Noise; for the Roaring of the Sea and the blowing of the Wind is much
alike; but when the Wind blows upon the Sea, it makes a horrid Noise.

Of Water.
TO my apprehension, Water lies like a Swarm of Bees, every drop being like a
several Be; and as Bees lie so close one to another as at small distance they
seem to be one entire Heap or Ball, so do Waters; but if they be disturbed they
will spread, and every Be is seen distinctly, which before we could not see;
so Water, when great quantity is together, the Distinction of each Drop cannot
be perceived by Man's Eyes; but cast up a Handful of Water, or sprinkle it
about, and it will fall into Drops: Besides, Drops of Water lie much closer
together than the Bodies of Bees can do, because they are more Porous and
soft, which yields to Contraction, and being wet makes them Glutenous, and so
stick closer, which makes the Distinction of the Drops of Water less visible
than Bees.

Winds may be rarefied Air.
AS Air is rarefied Water, so Wind may be rarefied Air, and by thinness beget
such an Agilness, as may give it such a Strength by the quick Motion, that it
may overpower the more Solid, which are Air and Water: for quick Motions, by
the often Repetitions, grow powerful and strong. Wind is the Essence of Air,
as the Spirits of Air, for it is an extracted Substance, which makes it Quick,
Subtle, and Sharp, and of such a powerful nature, that it incounters solid
Bodies, and many times has the Victory over them, and by its active Wandering,
subtle and piercing Motion, it appears more like Life than an other Element.

Of Rain.
Vapor that is sent from the Earth, or drawn up by the Sun, is like so many
several Springs that issue out of the Pores of the Earth, and when they are
streamed to such a height, they meet and jon together, and gathering into
Clouds, they become like a flowing River, with curling Waves like the Sea; But
where there is too great a Quantity gathered together, that the Sun cannot
digest, they overflow and fall down into showers of Rain.

Of the Saltness of the Sea, and the freshness of Springs.
SOme are of Opinion, that the Veins of the Earth are filled from the Sea, and
that the Water runs through the Earth, as through a Sieve or the like, letting
the thinnest part through, and keeping the more solid back, which is the Salt;
which to my Reason does not seem probable; for we find by Experience that the
Nature of Water being Moist, Soft, and Pliable, does suck out with the Liquid
Tongue, the Salt and Tincture of every Thing, even from the soild'st Body, as
Minerals, which are harder far, and more close, than the Porous part of the
Earth; And for experience, we see and taste those Waters that run through Mines,
have not only the Tincture and Taste of those Minerals, but the purging effects
which proceed from the Nature belonging to them; which shows, that it is
unlikely that Salt should be taken out of the Water, when Water draws and sucks
out all Salt or the like into it self, unless they could prove Earth to be
more Thin and Liquid than Water, whose Liquidness sucks out all the looser
Ingredients, which is not only as I said before the Tincture and Taste, but the
natural Property; and since it is improbable that the Salt should be retained
by the Earth from the Water, but far more probable that the Water should become
more salt, from the Earth, which makes me think it is improbable that the Veins
of the Earth should be filled with Water immediately from the Sea; but to my
Apprehension they are filled after this manner.

The Planets, like Water-Mills, draw up Vapors from the Sea, and the Sun, as
the hottest Planet, does by his heat as it were Calcine the Salt Vapor;
although the Vapor cannot be so salt as the Seawater, because the Gross Salt
is not so light to be drawn up, but rather remains as fixed; but when the Sun
has Calcined it, the Volatile part flies up to the Body of the Sun, or else
stays in the middle Region, and there meeting with a Sulphurous and Bitumenous
Matter mixeth therewith, and makes a Matter of the nature of Gunpowder, which
shoots Thunder, and flashes Lightning; the Watery part distills back again on
the Earth in Showers of Rain, and that fresh Water distilled which falls upon
the Earth, soaks into the Earth, and fills the Veins therein, causing fresh
Springs to rise where the Veins are too full: But in Egypt, or the like, where
it seldom Rains, because the Sun is there fierce and heady, that it has not
patience to draw by degrees as in Vapor, but draws up a Sea at once, which
they call Nilus; for the Appetite and the Strength joining together, draws up
so great a quantity, that the Strength being not able to draw it up high, makes
it only swell up, which heaves no higher than to cover the Earth some small
depth, as some few Yards, or Feet high; and the Reason why it rises but twice
a year, is, that the Sun is gathering his Forces half a Year to make a
sufficient Strength to compass that Work; and the Reason that it seldom or
never fails, is, because it is the Nature of the Sun in those Parts, to draw
Moisture after that manner, and what is Natural is a constant Habit or Custom.

Of the Seawater running through the Veins of the Earth.
SOme are of opinion, That the Sea runs through the Veins of the Earth, as the
Blood through the Body of an Animal, as a Man; which, to my reason, is very
unlikely; for then there must be much more Water than Earth; if so, the Earth
would be drowned with a superabundant quantity, what with the Sea that runs
about it, and the Rain that falls upon it, and the Water that runs through it
perpetually. For put the Case it be as they say, that it runs out at some
places, as fast as it comes in at others, yet it would wash and moulder away
the Earth by the perpetual concourse and recourse, if not the Solidst part, yet
the most Porous part. Besides, if it were so, the Earth would not be so dry as
in many places it is, unless they hold, that some parts of he Earth have Veins,
and other parts none. But if they say, that the Earth being so much greater in
quantity than the Sea, which is the Watery part of the World, it has not
always a sufficient quantity to satisfy the Drought, which causes the Veins
to be dry, that Reason would make me think, that there should not be a
sufficient Quantity of Water to keep in a Body, to make a Sea so large to run
about it, especially of that depth the Sea is of, and to run through the vast
Earth, besides feeding the Air with Vapors. Thus if there were less Water than
Earth, the Earth-Ball would be burnt up, or at least so dry, as to bear
nothing; and if the Water were more than the Earth, the Earth would be drowned.
Wherefore, in my opinion, the Ingredients of the World are equally mixed, and
proportionably made, as Earth, Water, Air, and Fire; so the Sun proportionable
to the rest of the Planets, and the Planets proportionable to the Sun: so that
the whole Globe is in equal temper, and the whole Body sound; and though we,
who know not the Constitution of the World, may think sometimes the Elements
are distempered, which is their natural temper to be so, but not in our
knowledge to know how.

The Sun peirceth not deep into the Earth.
IT is not the Sun that is the Cause of the Elixar in the Earth, or the Golden
Mines, nor yet of other Metals, which are in the Bowels of the Earth; as for
example, all Cellars and Vaults are cold in the Summer, when all the surface of
the Earth is soultry hot; and if the Sun cannot pierce through a little Vault,
or Cellar, sure it cannot pass so far as into a deep Mine. This shows, if
Heat makes Metals, it must be in the Bowels of the Earth.

Autumn is warmer than the Spring.
AUtumn is warmer than the Spring, by reason of Sunbeams, which beat hotter and
longer upon the Earth in the Summer, when as Winter is cold, and has frozen
the Earth, which cannot suddenly be thawed. Besides, the Sun has not only
drawn forth the raw and undigested Vapors out of the Earth, but has
incorporated his Heat into her, all the Summer long: for though the Earth has
a Heat in her self, a Sun, as we may say, in the Center, yet toward the
Circumference it is so weak, as it is not sufficient to bring things to
Maturity, without the help of the Sun. Thus the Autumn is as much to be
preferred before the Spring, as Maturity to Immaturity.

Of Heat and Cold.
SOme say, that Fire is only sensible to that which has Heat in it self, and
by a Similitude is forced thereunto: but there is nothing more contrary than
Ice and Fire; yet Ice is sensible of Fire, which is proved by the melting, and
the Water thereof will be scalding hot: Thus what is Cold will grow Hot.

Of the Moon.
THere may be an Opinion, that the Moon is all Water, for we find that Planet
cold and moist; and why may not the inequalities of that we see in the Moon by
Perspective-glasses, be the Reflection of the Earth on that Watery Body, the
Moon? And as we see our Image in a Pond or Pail of Water, so do we see
Mountains, Rocks, and Valleys of the Earth, in the Face of the Moon. Some may
say, this Opinion may be contradicted, in the Eclipses of the Sun: for if the
Moon were all Water, it could not shadow the Sun from the Earth, by reason the
Sun would shine through it: but this is not a sufficient Contradiction; for a
little Cloud will shadow the Sun, wherefore so great a Body of Water must needs
darken it. Then some may say, the Figure must needs be weak, and not subject to
our Eyes, because the Distance is so great; it may be answered, though the
Distance be great, the Depth of the Moon is so also; and the deeper the Water
is, the fuller and perfecter it represents the Image that is set to the view;
besides, it may be like a Magnifying Glass, or like those Glasses that cast
forth the Image, as Concaves and Convexes do; and for Experience, what a way
will a Figure come out? wherefore how far will the Unequal, Moon, or Earth, as
may be both, cast or draw out the Image of the Earth? And why may not the Moon
be thought all Water, as well as the Sun all Fire, since the Effects of the
Moon are cold and moist, as the Effects of the Sun are hot and dry? for we must
guess of the Quality, or Cause, by the Effects: besides, the Light shows it
Water; for when the Sun shines upon the Seas, the Reflection casts a Pale Light,
so the Moon gives a Silver Light.

Of the Prospect of Water.
WE cannot see, with a Perspective glass, the several Drops of the Sea, as we
see the several Parts in a Heap of Sand: for if we look into the Sea, it only
shows a shining Body; but look on the Sand, and every little Grain will seem a
little Stone, and so a small Heap seems like a Rock, and the Perspective shows
perfectly what it is, because it lies in distinct Parts which may be magnified:
But we cannot magnify the Drops of Water, because it is a Liquid Body, where
every part mingles into one another, or cleaves so close, as it becomes one
entire Body, so as there are no distinct Parts visible.

Of Perspectives.
JUST as a Perspective glass carries the sight afar off, so a Trunk, or Pipe,
conveys the sound and voice to the Ear at a great distance. Thus we may
perceive, that the Figure of a round Circle has the nature to gather up, and
to draw to a Point all Species whatsoever: for they do not only gather these
from the Brain, but those that come from outward Objects; and the more round
Circles there are, the straiter and further the several Species go, and the
sharper is the Point, as being bound, not having Liberty to stray forth. That
is the reason, that the longer the Perspective is, or the Pipe, or Trunk, the
clearer and perfecter we see, and hear: for a Pipe, or a hollow Trunk, gathers
up the several Letters, and Words, as a Perspective gathers up the several
Objects. Besides, the Eye and the Ear are much of the nature of a
Burning-glass, which gathers all the loose and scattered Beams of the Sun to a
Point, becoming there so strong, being united, as the Reflection strike upon all
Bodies, it meets, and peirceth into whatsoever is Porous: Just so the
Reflections of what the Senses have gathered together, strike upon the Optic
Nerve, and pierce into the Brain; and if the Species of Sense were so material
as those Species which are drawn from grosser Bodies, the Nose would see a
Sent, and the Ear see a Sound, as well as the Eyes see a grosser Object which
is presented to it: But the Matter being Thin, and Aerie, the Objects cannot be
so soild and substantial, as to make a Figurative Body to last so long as for
our gross Senses to see.

Of going about the World.
IT is said, that Drake and Cavendish went round the World, and others, because
they set out of one place, and went till they came to the same place again,
without turning: But yet, in my conceit, it does not prove they went round the
whole World; for suppose there should be round Circle of a large Extent, and
within this Circle many other Circles, and likewise without, so that if one of
these inward or outward Circles be compassed, shall we say it was the
Circumference Circle, when it may be it was the Center Circle? But it may
easily deceive the Understanding, since we can truly judge but according to
what we sind, and not to what we know not. But surely the World is bigger than
Men's Compass, of Embracing; and Man may make a Globe of what he knows, but he
cannot make a Globe of what he knows not; so that the World may be bigger than
Man can make Globes, for any thing he knows perfectly. This Globe Man makes
for the whole World, is but an inward Circle; and that there may be many of
them which we do not know, because not found out as yet, although Ships are
good Scouts to bring Intelligence.

Of Nature.
WE find that Nature is stinted her self, as well as Man is stinted by her, for
she cannot go beyond such Rules and Principles, which shows there is something
more powerful than Nature, as to govern her as she governs the World: for if
she were not limited, there might be new Worlds perpetually, and not a
Repetition in this course of one and the same Motion, Matter, and Form, which
makes it very probable, that Nature has wrought to the height of her
Invention, and that she has plowed and sowed to the length of her Limits, and
has reaped the plentifullest Crops, or at least as plentiful as she can,
which makes it very Unlikely, or indeed Impossible, that there should be better
and quicker Wits, or sounder Judgments, or deeper Understandings, or exacter
Beauties, or purer Virtues, or clearer Truths, than have been in former Ages;
and we find by her Acts past, that all was begot from the first-grounded
Principles; Variation indeed there may be, but not any thing entirely new: And
that there have been as good, if not better, in the same kind before. Neither
can we rationally think, but the very same Patterns of all her Principles have
been before in the Generality of her Works, although not made known in the
Particulars of every of her Works. But every Age are apt to flatter themselves,
out of a Natural Self-love, that Nature has out-wrough her former Works; which
if so, there must be no Perfection, because no End of Increasing: for nothing
can be Perfect that has a Superior, or which is not finished and done; or
that Nature, being Imperfect, cannot finish what she has begun; or that her
Principles are Imperfect which she works upon. But we find, that Nature has a
constant and settled course in all she does; and whatsoever she works, are but
Patterns from her old Samplers. But the several Stiches, which are the several
Motions, are the same; and the Stuff, which she works upon, which is the
Matter, is the same; and the Figures she makes, are after the same kind; and we
find, through many ages since, that it is the same, as Solomon says, Nothing
is new, etc.

Of Augury.
BY the Sympathy and Antipathy of Matter, or at least in the several Forms of
all; so in the Motion of Nature, if Man, the chief Work of Nature, would
observe, we might foreknow Effects to come by past Effects, and present
Effects, if we would but study the Art which in former times those that were
called Augures were learned in, and certainly did foretell many things truly
well, and without the help of a Devil, but by Natural Observations of Natural
Effects, though unknown Causes. And why may not this Learning be, as well as
Astronomy, which by Observations of Effects has found out the Reason of
Eclipses, and can foretell their times, and many other things concerning all
the Planets and fixed Stars? And why not as well as Physicians, that have found
out the Effects of Vegetables and Minerals, and the Diseases, by which kind and
ways of applying has produced a Cure, which is not only a Restoration, but
a kind of Creation, and can foretell whether such kind of Diseases are curable,
or no.

Of Natural Faith.
THere may be such Sympathy in Nature, that if we could believe, undoubtedly
our own Belief might bring any thing to pass: For why may not Faith beget
naturally what it requires, as well as one Creature beget another? But Nature
is Wise, for she has mixed Man's Mind with so many Passions and Affections, as
his Belief cannot be so clear, but that there lie always Dregs and Doubts in
the bottom of his Mind; which if Nature had not ordered so, Man might have
transformed her Works to his Humor. But certainly there is a Natural Sympathy
in Curses, to produce an Evil Effect.

The Predestination of Nature.
THere is a Predestination in Nature, that whatsoever she gives Life to, she
gives Death to; she has also predestined such Effects from such Causes.

Of Chemistry.
THE greatest Chemists are of a strong Opinion, that they can enforce Nature,
as to make her go out of her Natural Pace, and to do that by Art in a Furnace,
as the Elixar, in half a Year, that Nature cannot in a hundred or a thousand
Years; and that their Art can do as much as Nature, in making her Originals
another way than she has made them; as Paracelsus little Man, which may be
some Dregs gathered together in a Form, and then persuaded himself it was like
the Shape of a Man, as Fancies will form, and liken the Vapors that are
gathered into Clouds, to the Figures of several things. Nay, they will pretend
to do more than ever we saw Nature to do, as if they were the God of Nature,
and not the Work of Nature, to return Life into that which is dead, as to renew
a Flower out of its own Ashes, and make that Flower live fresh again; which
seems strange, since we find nothing that Nature has made, that can be more
powerful, or more cunning, or curious, than her self: for though the Arts of
Men, and other Creatures, are very fine and profitable, yet they are nothing in
comparison to Natures works, when they are compared. Besides, it seems
impossible to imitate Nature, as to do as Nature does, because her Ways and
her Originals are utterly unknown: for Man can only guess at them, or indeed
but at some of them. But the reason of raising such Imaginations in Man, is,
because they find by practice, that they can extract and divide one Quality
from another, though it may be in question, whether they can do it purely or
no, but so as to deform that Nature has formed: But to compass and make as
Nature does, as they imagine they can, is such a Difficulty, as I believe they
have not the power to perform; for to divide, or substract, is to undo; and
Nature has given that Faculty to Man to do some things when he will, but not
in all, as, he may ruin and destroy that he cannot build, or renew; and though
he be an Instrument, as all other things are, to further Natures Works, since
she is pleased to work one thing out of another, not making new Principles for
every thing, yet he cannot work as she works: for though he can extract, yet
he cannot make; for he may extract Fire out of a thing, but he cannot make the
principle Element of Fire; so of Water and Earth; no more can he make the
Elizar, than he can make the Sun, Sea, or Earth; and so it seems as impossible
to make a Man, as to make a piece of Meat, put into a Pot, and setting it upon
the Fire, of what temper, or which way he can, he shall never turn it into
Blood, as it does in the Stomach, or make such Excrements as the Bowels cast
forth: And to make the Essence of a Flower return into the same Flower again,
seems more strange; for first, that Motion is ceased and gone, that gave it
that Form; and where they will find that Motion, or know what kind moves it, or
what moved it to that Form, I doubt is beyond their skill. Besides, those
Qualities, or Substances, are evapoured out, that gave it that taste, or smell,
or that made it such a thing; and though they be never so Industrious to keep
those Vapors in, yet they are too subtle to be restrained, and Insensible to
be found again, when once they are separated: so as it is as hard to gather the
dispersed Parts, as to make the first Principles, which none but the God of
Nature can do; for it is a hard thing out of the Ashes of a Billet to make a
Billet again. But Nature has given such a Presumptuous Self-love to Mankind,
and filled him with that Credulity of Powerful Art, that he thinks not only
to learn Natures Ways, but to know her Means and Abilities, and become Lord of
Nature, as to rule her, and bring her under his Subjection. But in this Man
seems rather to play than work, to seek rather than to find; for Nature has
infinite Varieties of Motions to form Matters with, that Man knows not, nor can
guess at; and such Materials and Ingredients, as Man's gross Sense cannot find
out insomuch that we scarce see the Shadow of Natures Works, but live in
Twilight, and have not always that; but sometimes we are in Utter Darkness,
where the more we wander, the apter we are to break our Heads.

THE EPISTLE.
THis Book I doubt will never gain an Applause, especially amongst those
Students who have spent their time with Ancient Authorities, who are become so
restringent with their Doctrines, as the strongest reason of Contradiction
cannot move them, nor reasonable Truths purge out the Erroneous Dregs. And they
do not only make a Laughing Scorn, or cast a Deriding Jest, on Modern
Opinions, but they will fly from them, as from the Plague, without any
Examination, crying, they are Defective, out of an Obstinate Belief, that none
but the Ancients were Masters of Knowledge, and their Works the only Guides of
Truth, which is as Ridiculous, as to think that Nature cannot or will not make
any thing equal to her former Works; or to think Nature confined all Knowledge
to some Particular Heads in Ancient Times, and none but those to trace her
Ways; or to think that the Curiosity of Nature is so easily found out, that
the Ancients could not be mistaken. But the Ancients are divided amongst the
Scholars, or rather the Scholars are divided amongst the Ancients, where every
several Author has a several Party to fight in his Defense, or to usurp an
Absolute Power; where there is so much Envy, and Malicious Factions, and
Side-takings, to maintain or to fling down several Opinions; or so much
Ignorance, blindly to throw at all, having no Understanding Eye to make
Distinguishment, or to see what they are against. But I hope none of my Readers
will be so blind as to break their Heads against the Candlestick, when the
Light is set therein; and I wish it may burn so clearly, and bright, as to cast
no dark Shadows against the Wall of Ignorance: yet I must confess, it is but a
Night piece, for it wants the Sun of Rhetoric to make it a Glorious Day.

The Worlds Olio. LIB. III. PART III.
Much Praise makes a Physician think himself Learned.
IT is a strange thing to see into what great Errors Men will run; as suppose
a Person shall find out, or have it by Receipt, a rare Medicine, as to cure one
Disease, which is curable; and for the Fame of this one Medicine, shall have a
whole Country flock to him for Medicines for their several Diseases, and shall
not be persuaded from it; and at last persuade him, as Self-love is easily
persuaded, to practice that he has no skill in; and so kill more by his
Ignorance, than his Medicine can qure by its Virtue.

Of Physicians.
IT is almost impossible for all Physicians to know all Diseases, and their
Remedies, as they prosess to do, by their general Practices; for we find, to
learn a mean Art, it is the study and service of seven Years; and certainly it
is much more difficulty to know Diseases, which are like Faces, not any one
alike; Besides, Diseases lie so hid in the Body of an Animal, as they are never
perfectly known, but guessed at; and to know the Cure of a Disease, is as hard,
as to know the Disease; and indeed we can never know a perfect Cure, unless we
could know the undoubted Cause. But Physicians should watch, as Philosophers,
the Stars, with Observations, and in time they may guess so well, as seldom to
fail of a Remedy. Wherefore it were good, that every particular Physician should
be bound by a Law to study only a single Disease, and the Cure thereof, and
not to confound their Brains with terms and names of Diseases, and to kill the
Patient, by being ignorant of the Cause. But let every Disease, go to a proper
Physician; for though there be a multitude of Diseases, yet there are more
Physicians: but such is the sad Condition, that they rather adventure to
Chance, or Luck, than Skill; for Diseases are like several Countenances in
Faces: though there be one and the same kinds of Faces, as Mankind,
Horse-kind, and Cow-kind, yet every Horse-face is not alike; nor every Man's
Face is not alike; so Diseases: as Pox-kind, and Plague-kind, and Feaver-kind:
yet all Fevers are not alike, nor Plagues, nor Pox; for they are different in
degrees; wherefore one and the same Medicine will not cure one kind of Disease,
but the Medicine must differ, as the Disease: for as the Countenance of the
Disease changes, so must the Medicine. But it is harder to take the degrees of
Diseases, than to draw a Picture to the Life, for it is hard to know in what
Degree a Disease is in.

But the Second Part of my Philosophical Fancies will treat more at large of
Diseases, and their Cures.

The Motion of the Blood.
THE most Renowned and most Learned Physician, Doctor Harvey, has found out
the Circulation of the Blood, by his industrious study, so methinks it should
be very beneficial toward the health of Man, to find out the Motion of the
Blood, as it runs, whether it has one intermixing Motion as it runs; or
whether the Blood does not do as the Water seems to do, which going in a swift
source, where the following Drops are as great Strangers to the leading Drops,
as the situation of either Pole: for though the hinder Drops press forwards,
and drive on the former, like Crowds of People, one shuffling another, yet they
do not seem to intermix, or incorporate, but rather seem to break, and divide
into parts; for if they should intermix, and incorporate one drop into another,
their intermixing Motion would hinder their running Motion so much, as it would
be scarce perceivable how it went forward; and if the Blood do not intermix,
then some Veins may have foul and corrupted Blood, and some very pure Blood,
which we many times see; which makes me think it does not intermix; if so, we
may take out our good Blood, and leave our bad behind us, not knowing where the
Corrupted Blood lies; and this Corrupted Blood may infect the Vital Parts, as
it runs along. This makes some, that when they let Blood in Fevers, they are
never the better, because that Vein was not open where it lay: so that
Physicians had better strike two or three Veins, and venture the loss of Good
Blood, than miss the Bad, for it may corrupt all the rest, though not by
intermixing, yet by corrupting the Liver as it flows.

Of letting Blood.
THere are more Diseases come in having too much Blood, than too little: for
when the Veins are too full, the Blood has no liberty to run out, and for want
of Motion corrupts, which Corruption bursts out into Smallpox, Fistaloes,
Kings Evils, and many such like Diseases. But if the Humor thrusts not
Outward, it corrupts the Inward Parts, as, the Liver, the Lungs, or else
breeds Imposthumes, and many such Diseases. But if there be much Blood, and
thin, then by the agitation it grows hot, or else by the many Spirits in much
Blood, it begets too much Motion, Motion Heat, and Heat and Motion fires the
Blood, and inflames the Spirits, which causes Fevers of all sorts, Frenzies,
and Consumptions; for there may be as well too much Motion in the Body, as too
little. But when the Parts of the Body are congealed, or tied up with Cold,
then the Blood Apoplexies come by the stoppage of the Blood.
cannot run, nor the Spirits work, but Motion cease, and the ceasing of
Natural Motion is Death. Or if the Blood run too fast about, and the Spirits
work too hard, by reason of too much Heat, they wast out themselves, by reason
of too much Labor, Hective Fevers caused by quick Motions.
and so are worn out, like the Wheels of a Clock; for the Clock cease to go,
when the Wheels are broken.

Of Diet.
THere is nothing preserves Health more, and lengthens Life, than due and just
proportion of Diet, according to the strength of the Stomach: for one should
eat so, that the Body should feed upon the Meat, and not the Meat to feed upon
the Body, as it does with those that eat more than they can digest, for the
Superfluity makes Slough and Slime in the Body, which Slime drowns the Spirits,
slackens the Nerves, corrupts the Blood, and weakens the Body; besides, it
brings many Diseases. Neither should one eat so little, as to let the Body
feed upon it self; for much Fasting dryes the Blood, heats the Body, and fires
the Spirits, which Fire once getting into the Arteries, is seldom or never
cured, being a Hective Fever. But it is as hard to know a just proportion to
the strength of the Stomach, as to keep it when they know it. This Knowledge
comes by observing the Stomach, for at some times the Stomach requires more
than at other times, although the Appetite may be less, when the Stomach is
empty, or it is requirable to give it more: for some have such weak Appetites,
as they sterve their Bodies, because they would not displease their Taste; or
else eat such things as would yield no Nourishment: for there is a great
difference between the Appetite and the Stomach. Others, their Appetites are so
sharp, and their Stomachs so weak, as it digests not the third part of what it
receives: But he that loves Pleasure more than Health, and Life, let him follow
Epicures; and they that think the Severity of the Body is the way to Eternal
Life, let them turn Anchorets: but they that think they may use all things that
are lawful, without 2 prejudice to the Soul, and would have Health and Life,
to use them long, let them follow Observation and Moderation.

The Reason why one and the same Quantity Of Purging Medicines.
of Physic shall purge some to Death, and others it shall never move, or at
least not to that degree.
THE Reason is, That one and the same Quality and Quantity of Purging Medicines
works so different in several Bodies, and at several Times, in one and the same
Body, is caused by the Validity and Solidity of the Humor: for the Bodies of
Animals are like to several Grounds, some Dusty and Dry, some Stony and Hard,
some Tuff and Clammy, as Clay, some Muddy and Dirty, others Washy and Wet;
which causes Husbandmen to yoke more Oxen, or Harness, more Horses, to add
Strength, not only when their Draughts are heavily laden, but when the Ways
are ill, and uneasy to travel in: for in some Ways ten Horses will not draw so
easy as one in other Ways, or in Winter as in Summer, but are forced to whip
and lash, to tug and pull: so are Bodies, where Physic, like Horses, or Oxen,
does pull and gripe the Guts, to draw out clammy Phlegm; where, in Light and
Sanguine Bodies, the Physic runs fast, and the Humors follow easily; or in
Melancholy, and Dry Ways, where the Humor is so hard, as the Physic rather
beats upon it, than penetrates or divides it, and at last becomes Lame, and
Weak, as Horses which are foundred; but Choleric Bodies are like Sandy Ways,
where the Humors like Dust, fly about. But there must be several sorts of
Physic given to several Constitutions, as Husbandmen sow several sorts of
Grain; as, some Humors must be dug up with Penetrating Medicines, other
Humors plowed up with Fomenting Medicines; some Humors harrowed with
Extenuating Medicines, others raked as with Drawing and Attractive Medicines;
some must be watered with Solable and Sucking Medicines, others must be manured
and nourished with fine Light-Meats, and Gelly Broths; others must be comforted
with the hot Sun of Cordials. Thus if Bodies be not husbanded according to the
Nature Constitution of the Soil, they will never have a sufficient Stock of
Health to pay Life, their Land lord, his Rent; and Death will seize upon their
Lease, as forfeited to him before the Rent-day.

Of Purging Drugs.
ALL Purging Drugs have more of the penetrating or subdividing Quality, than
attractive, or drawing: for it is not the gathering together the Humors, that
casts forth, or purges forth, but the cutting or dividing them, which loosens
them, and dissolves; and the Cause of Fluxes in Bodies, is, that Nature has
bred a Drug in the Body which is a penetrating and subdividing Humor.

Of Opium.
Opium works upon the Spirits, as Drugs do upon the Liver, in the Body; it is
good in Fevers, for in all Fevers the Spirits are like Wanton Bodies, which
run and play so much, until they have put themselves into a Fiery Heat: But
dull Opium corrects them, like a grave Tutor; wherefore Opium should be good
for Madmen, moderately taken.

Of Animal Spirits.
THE Animal Spirits are the Radical Vapor in the Body, produced from the
Natural Heat, and Radical Moisture: but Obstruction, which comes by
Superfluity, stops the Natural Heat, hindering the Extenuating Faculty and
Corruption which is caused by Superfluous Moisture; and Unnatural Heat damps
the Natural, and drowns the Radical Moisture, by which the Animal Spirits
become weak. This is the reason, that those Diseases that come by Obstruction,
or Corrupted Humors, make the Body faint and lazy, and the Mind dull and
melancholy.

Of Heat and Cold.
HEat and Cold produce many times one and the same Effect: for as Cold draws
all Spirits inward, so Heat thrusts all Spirits outward: for Cold is like a
Hook, to pull Heat inward; and Heat like a Spear, or a Staff, to thrust
outward; As for example, From Wine is distilled Aqua vitae, or the like, which
are Spirits by the means of Fire; and Wine in a Barrel, if it be much frozen,
will cause all the Spirits in the Barrel to gather together in the midst, and
no Spirits are left in that which is frozen; as likewise in extreme Fear, all
Spirits will be drawn to the Heart, as the Center, insomuch as all the rest of
the Members will have none left to support them, as they become useless; and in
great Heats the Spirits go to the Outward Parts, and leave the Inward Parts so
void, as they become saint and exhausted, for want of their help.

The Difference of Heat and Cold in the Spring and Autumn.
THE Face of the Earth is like the Hearth of a Chimney, and the Sun as the Fire
that lies thereon; that is the reason that the Spring is not so warm as the
Autumn, or the Autumn so cold as the Spring, because the Sun is not so hot in
the Winter to heat the Earth, as in the Summer: for as the Hearth of a Chimney
will require some time to be heated, after the Fire is laid thereon, so it will
retain a Heat sometimes, after the Fire is taken therefrom.

Likewise this is the reason, that it is coldest just before the break of Day,
because at that time the Sun has been longest absent: for there is some Heat
in the Night, though but weak; not but that the Night may be hot, when the Day
has been cold: but then that Heat proceeds rather from the Bowels of the
Earth, than the Beams of the Sun; for though the Sun may have a Constant Heat,
yet his Beams have not, as we may observe, some Summer Days are much colder
than others; for some Days may be hotter when the Sun is Oblick, than when it
is Perpendicular over our Heads, by reason that cold and moist Vapors may
arise from the Earth, and as it were quench the Violent Heat in the Beams of
the Sun; and Wind may cool the Heat also, or Clouds may obstruct the Heat, as a
Skreen set before the Fire: yet neither Wind, nor Vapor, nor Clouds, can alter
the Heat inherent in the Sun, etc.

Diseases curable and uncurable.
THere are some sorts of Dropsies that are caused by Obstruction, and some
sorts of Consumptions caused by Evil Digestion, and so Diseases of all sorts
that are curable: but if any Vital Part be perished, it is not Physic, nor
good Diet, nor change of Air, nor any Evacuation or Restoratives, that can make
that part whole again that is perished, no not Nature it self; for when her
Work is finished, she cannot mend it; for if she makes it Imperfect, it will
continue so: for Nature is like a Clay Potter, that if his Pot be made awry, if
once confirmed and hardened with Heat, he cannot alter it.

Of the Sickness in the Spring.
THE Reason there are more sick in the Spring than in the Winter, is, that the
Pores of the Body being closer shut in Winter, by the Contraction of the Cold,
than in any other Season, keeps in the Fire, the Smoke, and Vapor, that
should, and would if it could, issue out: But the Parts being stopped, having
not a sufficient Vent to transport a proportionable Quantity, it lies and
corrupts; for want of Agitation, the Quantity increasing, it overcharges the
Body, that by such time the Spring is arrived, the Body is so distempered, as
it falls sick, the Corruption having bred a Malignity that infects the Noble
Parts.

For the Body having more Vapor than the Natural Heat can digest, makes it not
only corrupt, for want of a sufficient Heat to purify it, but that Corruption
quenches out the Natural Heat, which causes Agues; and begets an Unnatural
Heat, which causes Fevers, and the like Diseases; and the Corruption causes
the Smallpox, Meazels, Imposthumes, Soar Throats, and many such kinds of
Diseases.

But when this Distemper of the Body is joined to the like Corrupted Vapors
drawn from the Earth, it is most commonly deadly, and produces great Plagues
the Summer following, the Body being then like Rotten Wood, which is quickly
set on Fire, and soon burnt out.

But if the Body has a Sufficiency of Natural Heat to clarify the Vapor,
that arises from the Stomach, and Bowels, and to dry up the Superfluous
Moisture, the Body is safe from Danger: but if the Body have more Heat than
Moisture, it feeds upon the Noble Parts, and causes Hective Fevers.

But Hective Fevers are seldom cured by the stoppage of the Pores: for the
Natural Heat in the Body is like External Fire, which is extinguished if it be
stopped, and has not Vent.

But there are several sorts, or kinds, or manners of Unnatural Heat, caused by
Obstructions, and other Accidents; as there is a Smothering Heat in the Body,
caused by Obstructions; and there is a Smoking Heat of the Body, caused by too
violent External Motions. or such Meats that actually heat; also a Fiery Heat
in the Body, caused by too much, and too strong Interior Motion: but these
Heats, that are Moist Heats, and Unnatural, cause Corruption.

Of the Sickness in Autumn.
THE Reason there is more Sickness in Autumn than in Summer, is, that the
Powers of the Sun abating, let fall by degrees all the Dregs and Dross of that
Vapor it drew up from the Earth, when it was in its full Strength; which
having more power to draw, than to digest, the Superfluity corrupts; which
Corruption falls back upon the Earth, infecting the Air, also the Bodies of
Men, and many times Beasts: yet the Infection is received, or infects,
according as the Bodies are tempted: For if the Bodies are full of Humors, and
the Blood corrupt, the Air is apt to catch hold, as having a Sympathy each to
other, for as the old Proverb is, Like will to like; and those Bodies, and also
those Meats, that are moist, are most apt to corrupt: for Heat and Moisture are
said to be the Father and Mother to Curruption, which causes those that eat
much Fruits and Herbs in the Summer time, to fall into Fluxes, and Fevers, and
the like Diseases, in the Autumn; for those Humors that are bred in the
Summer, the Body strives to cast forth in Autumn, like a Child birth; for when
the Humors are come to such a Growth, the Body is in travel with painful
Throbs, and strives to be delivered; where some are soon delivered of their
Burden, others dye in their Labor.

Diseases of the Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
THE Diseases in the Spring are Agues, Smallpox, Meazels, Imposthumes, and the
beginning of Plagues; for all the Malignity that was tunn'd up in the Body in
the Winter, is set abroch in the Spring, by the returning Sun, whose Beams,
though weak, yet pierce, like small Gimlets, or Spiggots, all the Pores of the
Earth, and the Creatures thereon. The Diseases in the Summer, are Phrenzies, by
reason the Heat burns and inflames the Spirits; and Plagues, by reason the Heat
inflames those Malignant and Corrupted Humors that the Winter has bred by
Obstructions, like Houses that are musty, and fusty, and smoky, and foul, for
want of Air to sweeten them; and full of Spiders, and Cobwebs, and Flies, and
Moths, bred from the dusty dirty Filth therein, for want of Vent to purge them,
for the Winter shuts up all the Windows and Doors, which are the Pores;
likewise the Blood corrupts, and the Body is apt to rot, like Linen, that is
laid up damp, or in a moist place; for the Rheums that are subject to be in the
Winter, corrupt and rot the Lungs, and the Vital Parts of the Body; likewise
Sweatings and Faintings are Summer-diseases, by reason the Natural Moisture is
rarefied so thin, and the Pores open so wide, as it evaporates all out, even
the Radical Moisture, and the Vital Spirits issue out therewith.

The Diseases of Autumn are Fluxes, by reason the Summer breeds sharp Humors,
with the Heat and the Drought; besides, the Diets of Men are crude and raw in
that Season, as eating of Fruits, Roots, Herbs, and the like. Also this Season
is subject to Meagrums, and Fevers, which are also caused by sharp Humors;
likewise Head-akes, and Vomitings, caused by sharp Chorerick Humors, which the
Summer Diet breeds; likewise Plurisies, that are caused by burnt or corrupted
Blood, which is bred by too much Heat, or an Unnatural Heat, and a Supersluity
of Moisture; also Collicks, by reason the Summer rarifies the Vapors into
Wind, which causes not only in the Bodies of Men great Collicks, but in the
Bowels of the Earth, which causes Earthquakes, and great Tempestuous Winds in
the Air; for in this Season of the Year there are greater Winds than in any
Season, and hold the longest: for though in March, when the Pores of the Earth
are first opened, as I may say, by the returning Sun, whereupon the thinnest
Matter will first fly out, yet those Winds are neither so strong, so long, nor
so frequent, as those in Autumn.

The Diseases of the Winter are Coughs and Rheums, by reason the Pores being
closer drawn, and the Air grosser and thicker in Winter, it does as it were
daub rather up, like Mortar upon a Wall that has Holes and Crevises, than
enter in; which causes a closer Stoppage; which Stoppage causes Dew, and
Distillations: for the Heat and Moisture stewing together, the Body becomes
like a Still, or rather like a Pot, or Vessel, that is close covered, which
has Meat, or some Liquid Substance in it, where by Heat, the Moisture thereof,
is rarefied into Vapor and ascending to the Cover, and at the Top as the Cover
thereon, finding a Depress, straight gathers into a Dew, and so into Drops;
then falls, having a sufficient Vent, like Showers of Rain, where some run
through the Pipes of the Nostrils, othersome through the Gutter of the Throat,
and some fall straight down on the Stomach, as the Earth: for as it is the
Nature of Vapor to spread, and to ascend, as being Light and Thin; so it is
the Nature of Water to descend, or to run straight forth, by reason it is more
Solid, and Weightier likewise.

Likewise Coughs are Followers and Attendants of Rheums, which by tickling
those Parts where it falls or trickles along, causes a straining, and so a
coughing, though many times Wind produces the same Effect by a tickling touch.
Also Sneezing is an Attendant to Rheum and Wind, and causing a tickling on the
Brain, or in the Nose: for indeed Sneezing is nothing but a Cough through the
Nose, as through the Throat. Likewise Tooth-aches are caused by Rheums: for the
Rheum falling thereon, rots the Bones, or makes Holes therein; like as Water,
continually dropping on a hard Stone, works a Passage through. Also Soar Throats
are caused by Rheums; but that is when the Rheum is sharp or salt. Then Winter
is subject to cause Apoplexies, Lethargies, numb Palsies, and Gangrenes, that
are caused by the stoppage of the Pores, which, as I said, are not only drawn
closer by Cold, which makes the Skin thicker and harder, but by the gross and
thin Air, which is contracted into a more Solid Body by Cold. Thus the
breathing Passages of the Body being stopped, there flies up so much grosser
Vapors to the Head, as Vapoun thickens into Water, Water into Phlegm; Cold
congeals it Stone, Heat confirms it like Metal.
choaks the Brain, and smothers the Vital Spirits there; and the Body having
less Vent in Winter than in Summer, grows so full of Humors, as obstructs the
Nerves and Muscles, with cold, clammy, or hard baked Phlegm, as they cannot stir
with a sensible Motion; for in the Nerves and Muscles does the Sense of
Touching live; and where they cease from moving, those Parts are dead and
numm'd. Gangrenes are produced by the benumming of the Spirits, as when the
Spirits are congealed to Ice, which causes in very cold Countries, as Russia,
or the like, to have their Noses and Fingers fall off from their Faces and
Hands. Likewise, if the Spirits are quenched out with too much Moisture, or
their Motions hindered by some Obstruction, or as it were corrupted by some
Blow, Bruise, or Wound, those Parts, for want of Life's Motion, gangrene, and so
rot off. Likewise Fistaloes are subject to this Season, because this Season
being subject to breed Rheums of all Sorts and Natures, according as the
Humors are in the Body, so it breeds that sharp Rheum which makes Fistaloes:
for that Humor is as sharp as Vitriol or Aqua fortis, and it does in the Body
as Vitriol and Aqua fortis does on Metal, running about, and eating holes quite
through. Also this Season is subject to hard white Swellings, bred by cold,
clammy, or tough Humors. The Stone and the Gout reign in every Season, but not
in every Age: for though Children have the Stone many times, yet seldom or
never the Got: But the Gout, although its not the Stone in the Toe, yet it is
an Humor which is of the Nature of Lime, which is somewhat of a Brimstony,
Hard, Dry, Bitumenous Humor.

Of Cold and Hot Diseases.
A Cold Disease is apter for Cure than a Hot: for Cold Diseases are like Raw
Flesh, that the Frost has gotten hold of, and makes it unlike it self, by
reason of the Ice hardening of it; but Warmness dissolves it, and then it comes
to it self again; but by Excessive Heat, it is as if one should boil or roast a
piece of Flesh; for when a piece of Flesh is boiled, roasted, baked, or the
like, one shall never make it as it was, which is, to be raw again.

Of Apoplexies, and the like.
AN Apoplexy is a dead Palsy in the Brain, and a Lethargy, a numb Palsy in
the Brain; And the reason many times why dead and numb Palsies, when it takes
them on one Side, ruin the Legs, or Arms, and yet live, is, because it has not
touched the Vital Parts, which is caused by some Obstruction in the Veins, or
some of the Nerves, which either is by gross and thick Blood, or hard and
crusted Phlegm, or cold and clammy Phlegm: But if it be in the Head, which we
call Apoplexies, it is either caused by a Cold Humor in the Brain, which does
as it were congeal and freez up the Spirits; or by a Malignant Vapor,
proceeding from the Stomach, or Bowels, which Vapor choaks or smothers up the
Spirits. And indeed the greatest Enemy to the Brain is the Vapor that proceeds
from the Ill-affected Bowels, or Stomach: for Vapor, being Smoke, ascends
upward to the Head, which is the Chimney of the Body, where the Smoke vents
out; for the Bowels may be compared to the Hearth; the Stomach to the Pot, or
Furnace; the Meat to the Fuel; the Heart to the Fire, or Flame, which is fed by
the Liver, or Oily Substance; the Lungs the Bollows, to keep it alive; the
Head, as I said, the Chimney, to gather up the Smoke; the Nose, Mouth, and
Ears, the Tunnels from whence it issues out: for if the Nose and Mouth be
stopped, the Fire of Life goes out, and not having Reviving Air, it is choked
with its own Smoke: for though the Pores of the Body do evaporate some of the
Smoke, yet that is only the thin and subtiller Part; but if the Pores of the
Body be stopped by a Cold, the Body shall grow Feverish with it, so that many
times it sets the House on Fire; and when the Head is Idle and Frantic, it is
because the Head, which is the Chimney-top, is set on Fire by the Fever: but
the Vapor that ascends to the Head, is either a great Friend or Enemy to the
Wit; for a Gross Vapor chokes the Wit, a Thin Sharp Vapor quickens it, a Cold
Vapor congeals it, a Hot Vapor inflames it, and several sorts of Vapor make
variety of Wit, and the several Figures, and Works, and Forms, that that
Vapor, which is a Smoke, raises up, cause several Imaginations, and Fancies,
by giveng several Motions to the Brain.

Of a Fever.
A Fever is like a Stack of Hay that is laid up half wet, and half dry; This
Moisture and Drought being met together, strive for Preheminency, the Drought
would drink up the Moisture, and the Moisture would dissolve the Drought; and
if their Strength be equal, and the Strife be without intermission, the Stack
is set on Fire, caused by an equal, swift, continuated Motion, which consumes
all, if it be not quenched out by a fresh Recruit of Moisture: for Drought
takes the part of Fire, being the Child of Heat, which Heat is the Child of
Fire, and so is the Grandmother of Drought. Thus a Fever is caused by the
Humors of the Body, which being not well tempered, sets the Barn, which is the
Body, on Fire, by the Corruption therein; for Heat and Moisture are the Parents
to Corruption. But there is a Natural Heat and Moisture, which produces
Legitimate Issues; and there is also an Adulterate Heat and Moisture, from
whence proceed Bastardly Diseases, which are as Numerous, as Natural Children.

Of Fevers in the Blood.
BUT in Fevers, where only the Heat causes the Blood to boil, and so to
become scalding hot, when the Fever is taken away, that is, when the bitter
and sharp Humors are cast out of the Body by some Evacuation, or that the Fire
is quenched out with some cooling Julips, the Blood will be the same again,
without any alteration, as Water is; only in the boiling, the Blood may wast
and evaporate forth of the Body through the Pores, as Water does forth of the
Vessel it is boiling in: But if the Blood be corrupted, or mixed with Humors,
as Water is often with Mud, there is no way but letting it forth, drawing it
out of the Veins, that the Heart and the Liver, as the Springs, Unnatural heat
and cold may be cured in the Vital Parts, but not when they are corrupted.
may send in more, which may be Fresh and Clear, into the Veins again, unless
those Springs be corrupted, and then there is no Remedy, for then Death will
alter the Course of Life in that Body.

Sleeping and Waking.
SLeeping and Waking are the flowing and ebbing of Vapor: for when Vapor
flows to the Extreme Parts, it causes Sleep, as it were, for a time; Or
filling up all the Outward Senses, as Water does a Pipe, or a Vessel, or as
Wind does a Bladder, where nothing can be received therein, until they be
empty: so no Outward Objects can enter in at the Five Senses, until the Vapor
wherewith they are filled be dispersed; or falling back, by contracting into a
Lesser Compass; which when they are contracted or dispersed, they wake; so that
Vapor in the Body is as necessary for Life, as Food; And indeed Food is the
chief Cause of Vapor; for Heat and Moisture make Vapor; and like as Food,
received into the Body, does either distemper or nourish it, so does Vapor
that slows in the Body, make Sleep sound and easy, or trouble some and unquiet;
for Malignant and Corrupted Vapors are like Malignant and Corrupted Humors:
for as Malignant Humors cause the Body to be sick or painful, so Malignant
Vapors cause Sleeps to be full of Dreams, Startlings, and often Wakings;
though many times Dreams are caused by Rarefied Vapors, like a Wind which
blows upon the Brain, causing many Motions therein; or rather furrows the
Grosser Vapors, causing them to role in Billows and Waves, hindering them from
flowing easy and smooth; which Tempestuous Winds beat the Vapors backward, as
it were, or drive them from the utmost Extent, which hinders the Senses from
being thoroughly filled, which causes not so sound Sleeps: for when the Senses
are not filled, the Vapors are like Water in a Vessel not half full, which
when it is quite full, there is little or no Motion; though the Vessel be
moved, the Water stirs not much: but when it is but half full, or three parts,
when the Vessel is stirred, it flashes and sprinkles about.

Of not Sleeping in Fevers.
THE reason those that are in great Fevers, or the like hot Disease, cannot
sleep, is, that the Heat being too strong for the Moisture, it rarifies it so
thin, as it is like the forementioned Wind, which, instead of stopping, causes
Waking Dreams, that is, Frantic Fancies; for there is as Natural a Degree of
this Vapor, as there is a Natural Temper proper to every Animal Body; Or else
it burns the Body, and dryes up the Natural Moisture so much, as there can
arise no Vapor therefrom: for it is to be observed, that the dryest
Constitution sleeps the least, and those sleeps they have are short.

One and the same Cause differs in the same Effect of Sleep.
SOme and the same things, or Acts, will cause Sleep, or put by Sleep; as for
the Passions, sometimes Grief, Joy, Anger, and the like, will cause Sleep,
othertimes hinder it; the reason is, according as the Passions work inwards, or
extend outward: for when the Passions settle or move most inwards, they draw
all the Vapors backwards; and when they flow outward, they carry Vapors with
them; and as Passions many times carry out Vapors, so Vapors many times carry
out Passions, as we may observe by the Effects, as Sighing, Groaning, and
Weeping, as Railing, Threatening, Cursing, Fighting, Laughing, Hooping,
Hollowing, Praising, Singing, and Dancing, which are all Exterior Motions: But
where they work inward, the Heart beats, or works, and the Brain thinks
stronglyer than the Natural Constitution requires; which Motion causes
Unnatural Heat, which drinks up the Vapors; or else the Brain, or the Heart,
are so strongly bound to an Object, and holding as it were so fast thereon, as
it draws all the Powers of Life to assist therein: This causes Deep Musing,
Heart-griping, fixed Eyes, and slow Pulses, which draws the Vapors so much
inward, as almost extinguisheth the Fire of Life, and smothers the
Understanding, starves the Body, and makes the Senses unusefull; and many times
the Slow Motions congeal the Vapors, like Ice, making them unapt to slow. As
for Exterior Action, much Labor or Exercise causes them to flow, or
produces Sleep to those that have Gross Bodies, and too Thick Vapors (for the
Vapors may be too Thick as well as too Thin) for the use of Rest in these
Bodies and Constitutions, much exercises and rarifieth the Vapors to such a
Degree, as makes a General Aptness to flow to the Extreme Parts, wherewith the
Senses are stopped, as being full, which otherwise would not be so apt to slow;
but to Lean Bodies, and Dry Constitutions, much Labor and Exercise either
contracts the Vapor into so Gross a Body, as it cannot slow; or rarifies that
little Vapor they have, so thin, as it evaporates out by Insensible
Inspirations, or the Unnatural Drought and Heat drinks it up, so as there is no
Vapor to fill the Senses to a Repose.

Of Agues.
AGues are half Sisters to Fevers, which are like Fuel half dry, set on Fire
by Accidental Motions, and not kindled by a Natural Course: This Fuel half dry,
is Humor half concocted; the other part raw, and undigested, which is like
Hay, or the like, not dried enough by the Sun: so Digestion wants Natural Heat
to dry, which is, to concoct the Superfluous Moisture: for when the Moisture is
too much for the Heat, although it be not sufficient to quench it out, yet it
does damp and smother in the Heat, staying the Quickness of the Motion,
blunting the Edge and Sharpness, allaying the Penetrating Faculty; and the Heat
being not strong enough to drink up the Superfluous Moisture at once, but only
has so much strength as to rarify it into Vapor, which Vapor is Smoke, which
Smoke is thinner and thicker, according to the quantity and quality of the
Moisture, or as the Heat and Moisture does predominate; for when the Heat is
Master, the Vapor is so thin, as it flashes into a Flame, as Lightning from a
Cloud, which is an Intermixing Fever; but when the Moisture is Mistress, and
predominates, the Vapor is more Gross; which Gross Vapor does not only
quench out that Flame caused by the Unnatural Heat, but stops and hinders the
Extenuating Faculty of the Natural Heat, like as a Cloud should obscure the
Sun, obstructing his Beams, which disperseth his Heat by the Line of his Light,
which causes the Air to be Dark and Cold. Thus in the midst of Summer, when
the Sun is at the height of his Glory, a Dark Cloud, made of Vapor, will cause
the Complexion of his Light to be of a Black Pale, and the Body of the Day to
be Cold; But when the Sun breaks through by degrees, he dissipates those Black
and Sullen Clouds, rarifying the thinner part into Wind, and the thicker
condenses into Water; the one blows over, the other showers down: So those
that have Agues, their Flesh looks with a blue, black, pale, and is very cold
to the Touch; but when the Natural Heat dissipates, that Cold and Gross Vapor
that is raised from a raw, or half concocted Humor, the thinnest part spreads
about the Body, like the Wind, getting into every Cranny, Corner, or Part of
the Body, as Veins, Arteries, Muscles, Sinnews, putting the Body into a Violent
and Unnatural Motion, which is the Shaking Fit; and when the Rarefied Vapor is
spent, the Shaking Fit cease, and goes over; and then the Patient enters
into a Burning Heat; for the Unnatural Heat, which was involved in the Grosser
Vapor, as Fire in Clouds, which lightens and thunders, begins to break through,
especially when it is helped by the Sun, which is as the Natural Heat of the
Body; the Body, as the Air, grows soultry hot, and the Heat dissipating those
Foggy and Cloudy Vapors in the Region of the Body, condenseth the Gross Parts
into Water, which issues forth in Sweat, as Showers of Rain. Thus when the
Vapors are dispersed, and breathed out of the Body, through the Pores of the
Skin, or otherwise, the Body is like the Air, Serene and Clear, until there
are more Vapors ascended from the corrupted and half concocted Humors, which
sometimes gather sooner, and sometimes are longer before they are gathered into
Clouds again: This is the reason some have Quotidians, Tertians,
Double-tertians, and Quartans.

Of a Hectic Fever.
MOST Hectic Fevers are caused by an Excessive Heat in the Arteries, which
Heat is more difficult to quench, than to stop a pricked Artery: for in this
case letting Blood does more harm than good, by reason that the Moisture of the
Blood strives to quench the Fire therein, or at least to temper the Heat
thereof; for it is Wet that puts out Fire, not Cold; for hot Water will as soon
put out Fire, as cold Water. Neither can the keeping in the Blood cure the sick
Patient, it may some short time retard Life from expiring; the reason is,
because the Excessive Heat not only corrupts the Blood, and melts the Fat of
the Body, but it does evaporate Life forth, like boiling Water, that consumes
in Smoke. Thus it becomes an Incurable Disease, when once the Heat overpowers
the Moisture.

Of Coughs.
THere are many several sorts of Coughs; some proceeding from a Superfluity of
Moisture, others from too much Heat; some from a Corruption of Humors, others
from a Decay of the Inward Parts; others from sudden Colds upon great Heats,
and some proceed from Wind, likewise from sharp salt Rheums, and some from
fresh Rheums. Those that proceed from a Superfluity of Moisture, are strong
Coughs, that raise up Phlegm: for in that sort of Coughs, when the Stomach is
full of Humors, the Phlegm rises highest, like the Scum of a Pot on the Fire,
or like Whites of Eggs that are put into any hot Liquor; and when the Stomach
is hot, it boyls up like a seething Liquor, which boiling or seething provokes
to strain; which straining is not so violent, as to vomit: for those sorts of
Coughs are of the nature of vomiting, as in straining, or striving, or shuffing
upward; but by reason it is not so violent a Motion as Vomiting is, it only
provokes to Cough, bringing up Phlegm, or Water, with the Motion thereof. After
the like manner are such sort of Coughs as proceed from Corrupt Humor, and
most commonly are the Forerunners of the Small Pox, Meazels, or the like
Diseases.

But Coughs that proceed from a great Heat, either in the Stomach, or Bowels;
the reason is, that the Heat causes a great Vapor, which Vapor ascending to
the Head, there gathers into Clouds of Water, where dissolving, it falls back
again, like Showers of Rain, where it sometimes falls in pouring Showers, other
times like mizzling Rain. And the fuller of Moisture the Body is, the greater
Showers of Rain fall down. This stopping the Passages of the Throat, causes a
straining and striving in the Throat, as when any thing goes awry, or Crumbs or
Bones lie in the Throat, or stop the Windpipe: for every part of the Body, if
it be bound, or hurt, will strive and strain to help it self. But if the
Constitution of the Body be Naturally or Accidentally Dry, the Vapor is
thinner, and then it arises, like a steam in a Still, or Limbeck, where the
Head, like the top of a Still or Limbeck, gathers that steam into a Dew, which
falls back in distilling Drops; which Drops trickling down the Throat, as
Tears on the Cheeks, do rather tickle the Throat, than stop the Windpipe, or
strain the Throat: but if the Rheum be sharp, or salt, it causes a gentle
smart, which is of such a kind of touch as tickling is; provokes a faint or
weak Cough.

But Coughs that proceed from a decay of Parts, are, when any part of the Body
is corrupted it becomes less solid; as from being a Solid Flesh, to be of a
Jelly Substance, which dissolves with the least Heat, melting by degrees away;
and as it melts, it falls into liquid Drops, which Drops tickle or smart those
parts they fall or trickle on: for by reason the Inward Parts are as it were
raw, or very thin skinned, they make it sensible of the least touch; besides,
there is a faint strife, when the dissolved part falls from the other, which
strife tickling, causes a Cough; but the Cough is more or less, according as
the part dissolves. But these tickling Coughs are the most dangerous Coughs,
for the one causes a Consumption, the other is caused by a Consumption: for
when these tickling Coughs proceed from the Body, they are caused from a
Consuming Part, that melts and dissolves by degrees; but when it is
Distillation from the Head, it corrupts Parts by falling thereon, like as
Water, with a constant dropping, will penetrate through a Stone; much more may a
Constant Distillation corrupt a Spungie Matter, as Flesh; and according as the
Rheums are fresh, salt, or sharp, the Parts decay flower or faster: for salt,
or sharp Rheums, ulcerate the Parts, and destroy them soon.

Also Wind will cause a tickling in the Throat, as a tickling in the Nose,
which causes Coughs; for Sneezing is but a Cough through the Nose: but when
Wind rises through the Windpipe, it causes a Chine-cough; for as long as the
Wind ascends, the Patient cannot draw in Air, but coughs so long, without
drawing in of the Breath, till they are black in the Face, being as it were
choked or strangled, or rather smothered almost to Death.

As for Remedies, those Coughs that proceed from a Supersluity of Moisture, or
from Corrupted Humors, there must be applied purging Medicines, and letting of
Blood: but for Coughs that proceed from Decayed Parts, there is no help for
them: for when the Intrals are corrupted, and wasted, they cannot be restored
again, nor made as they were before; nor can they be healed up, if they be
ulcerated, as the Outward Parts of the Body can; for we cannot come so easily
to lay Plasters, and Pultesses, to draw out the Corruption, and Putrified
Humor from the Sounder Parts, that are not corrupted; yet there may be given,
or taken, such Medicines, as may prolong or retard the hasty Wast; which
Medicines must be cooling and clensing, as Julips made of Burrage-water,
Plantain-water, with Sirrop of Suckery, and Sirrop of Burrage, and Bugloss, and
the like; Also, Broths with Cooling Herbs, as Strawberry-leaves, Violet,
Suckery, and the like. But no Hot Sirrops, nor no Sharp Herbs, as Sorrel, and
the like; nor no Hot Herbs, as Thyme, Rosemary, Winter-Savery, Marjerum, or the
like.

Also I should think Almond-milk should be very good; for the French barley,
that is boiled in the Water, is both cooling and clensing, and quenches out the
Fiery Heat; and Almonds are healing and smothering. But in these Diseases,
Physicians do most commonly give those Medicines which are very pernicious, as
Mithridate, Brimstone, Saffron, Licquerish, and Hot Cordials; those Hot
Medicines, instead of comforting those Decayed Parts, rather inflame them; and
the Heat therein dissolves and melts them more hastily away.

But those Medicines are more proper for those that are stopped in their
Stomach or Head by Cold, which has congealed the Vapor into Icy Contraction,
Hot Medicines rarifie it thin again; although many times Cold causes an
Unnatural Heat, by stopping by Contraction the Pores of the Flesh, keeping in,
and hindering the Smoke of the Body from breathing forth; which Smoke smothers
the Inward Parts, causing thereby a Suffocating Stoppage; whereupon Cold
Medicines give the Patient more ease than Hot, as it has been found by
Experience.

But for those Coughs that proceed from a tickling Rheum from the Head, the
best Remedies are Issues; the next is letting a little Blood; the third, to
give the Patient Cooling Medicines, such as I named before, especially
Almond-milk; for it does not only quench the Unnatural Heat, but it allayes
and tempers the salt and sharp Vitriols that are most commonly mixed in those
Rheums: Yet there must always be a care, that they do not weaken the Stomach
by over-cooling Drinks: wherefore they must drink but a little at a time, and
at certain times, as, not upon a full Stomach, but when the Stomach is most
empty, for then it works better Effects, and hinders not Digestion. Likewise in
Consumptive-coughs, the Patient must not use any Violent Exercise, so as to
heat the Body, but must use Moderate Exercises. Likewise their Meats must be
light of Digestion, and rather to eat Boyl'd-meat than roasted, and rather
Flesh-meat than Spoon-meat; provided, that they be Fine Meats, as Pullet,
Chicken, young Turkyes, Partridges, and the like; young Rabbits are also good,
and Pigs, Lamb, and the like; but not to eat too much at one time, nor to eat
until they feel the Meat digested; The Salt that is in the Blood remains more
in Rostmeats than in Boyld-meats, for the Water sucks it forth.
for Ill Digestion causes an Unnatural Heat, and breeds the Body full of sharp
Humors.

As for Chine-coughs, those Medicines must be applied, as do expel Wind, and
to purge away the raw and unconcocted Humor that produce Wind.

Of the Disease called the Smallpox.
SMall Pox, or the like Diseases, are caused either by Superfluity of Humors:
for the Body having more than it can discharge, it lies and corrupts; Or else
by an Evil Diet, or an Ill Digestion, which breeds more Humors than Good
Nourishment; or by great Heats, or sudden Colds. Of this Disease many dye, that
would otherwise live, if they were rightly ordered in their Sickness; unless
the Corruption has taken hold on the Noble Parts, before it begins to break
forth, and then there is no Cure; Otherwise I believe it is as easy a Cure, as
any Disease, if Moderation be used: for those that strive hastily to throw out
the Corruption by forcible Medicines, as those Medicines that are hot, do like
those that take out Dirt out of a Ditch, not taking time to sling it far
enough; and to disperse it several ways, throw it on a high Heap, on the
Verge, or Edge of the Ditch; and being too great a Quantity to consist in one
Body, or to keep one place, falls back again, carrying some part of the Bank,
or Earth it lay on, along with it: So in the Diseases of the Smallpox,
striving to cast out the Corruption, it falls with greater Violence, and deadly
Effects, back again. Besides, most commonly this Disease is accompanied with a
Fever, and all hot Medicines increase a Fever, and many times it is a Fever
that kills, and not the Pox; And it is to be observed, that where one lives,
that has very Hot Medicines applied to him, ten will dye. But in these
Diseases there must be applied gentle dilating Medicines; and those that are
smoothing and healing, as Possets made with very small Alc, with Figs, Rasins,
and Lickerish boiled therein: Also a little letting Blood is very good,
especially if they be Feverish, although some account it deadly, but certainly
it is a safe Remedy. As for Purging Medicines, they are very dangerous, for
drawing in the Humor; but a Vomit is not amiss, for that does rather cast
forth, than draw inward; neither must they keep them too hot in their Beds, nor
too cold, but of a temperate heat.

Gargarizing is also very good in this Disease, for it does not only purge the
Head of Corrupted Humors, where it is most commonly overcharged, but it keeps
the Throat safe, and clear from Scabs, or at least mollifies them.

Of Violent Actions.
ALL Dry Bodies may use more Violent Exercises, with less Danger, than Moist,
where Heat and Moisture produces Corruption; where to Dry Bodies, the Heat
only makes it more dry, but not corrupts: The only Danger is, Violent
Exercise to Dry Bodies may wast the Radical Moisture, or inflame the Spirits,
which produces Frantic Fevers: But when a Moist Body is overheated, the
Blood is apt to putrisie, the Humors to corrupt, the Fat to melt, Vapors to
arise; this produces Smallpox, Meazels, Plurisies, Collicks, and very often
Consumptions, by disordering or melting the Noble Parts in the Body; but
especially, if a sudden Cold be taken upon a great Heat, for the sudden Cold
strikes the Heat so violently inward, as Extraordinary Motion does either set
the Body on Fire, or melts it, as Metal in a Furnace, producing an Unnatural
Heat in the Arteries, and inflames the Vital Spirits therein, which produces
incurable Hectic Fevers.

The Effects of Sickness.
SIckness will destroy that in one Week, that Time will not do in twenty Years:
for Sickness will make Youth look Old and Decrepid; when Health makes Age look
Young and Spritly. Sickness burns up the Body, Time wears out the Body, and
Riot tears out the Body.

Of the Senses.
AS all Objects and Sounds that go through the Eye and Ear, must first strike,
and make such a Motion in the Brain, before the Mind is sensible thereof; so
any thing that touches the Body, goes first through the Pores of the Skin and
Flesh, and strikes upon the Nerves; which Nerves are little Strings, or Pipes,
full of Brain; those spread all over the Body; and when those are moved, as the
Brain is in the Skull, then the Body is sensible; And that is the reason, that
when the Flesh is bound, or pressed up hard close, it is numb, and has no
feeling, because those Pores where it was bound, or pressed, are stopped, and
are no more sensible of touch, than the Eye, or Ear, or Nose, when they are
stopped, are sensible of Outward Objects, or Sound, or Sent. Thus stoppinig the
Pores of the Body is as it were Blind, or Deaf, Senseless and Tastless; and this
is the reason, that when any one is sick, or distempered, they cannot eat their
Meat, because the Pores of the Spungie Tongue are stopped, either by Weakness,
Cold, or Drought.

The Senses of the Body equalized with the Senses of the Soul.
AS the Body has five Senses, Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Tasting, and
Touching; so has the Soul: for Knowledge is as the Sense of Touch; Memory, as
the Sense of Sight; Reason, as the Sense of Hearing; Understanding, as the
Sense of Taste; and Imagination, as the Sense of Smelling, as being the most
Acry Sense.

Of Objects.
THere are three Imperfections in Sight, as, the Dimness of Age or Weakness,
Purblind, and Squint; Age makes all things look misty, as if there were a Veil
before their Eyes; and Purblind makes all things look level, or plain, without
the distinction of Parts; a Squint makes all things look double: But to look
perfect and clear, is, that the two Eyes make a Triangular Point upon the
Object; or else the Eyes are like Burning-Glasses, which draw all the Lines of
Objects to a Point, making themselves the Center.

Of Touch.
ALL Pleasure and Pain is Touch, and every several part of the Body has a
several Touch; for not only the various Outward Causes give several Touches,
but every several part receives a several Touch; and as the General Sense
throughout the whole Body is Touch, so every Particular Sense, as all Objects
touch the Eyes, all Sounds touch the Ears, all Sent touches the Nose, all Meat
touches the Tongue, and all those strike and move, and so touch the Brain. And
though all Touches are Motions, yet all are several Motions, according to the
several Parts: for all Pain comes by cross and perturbant Motions, all Pleasure
by even and regular Motions, and every particular Sense may receive Pleasure or
Pain, without affecting or disaffecting, or indeed a notice to the rest of the
Senses; for the particular Senses take no notice of each other. And, as I said,
every several part of an Animal has a several Touch, and a several Taste; the
Loyn does not taste like the Breast, nor the Breast like the Loyn, nor the
Shoulder like the Breast, nor the Neck like the Shoulder, nor the Head like the
Neck. So in Vegetables, the Fruit not like the Leaves, nor the Leaves like the
Rind. Thus the Objects, as well as the Senses, are different.

Of Pleasure and Pain.
THere are only two General Pleasures, and two General Pains, all the rest are
according to Delectation, or Reluctation; the two General Pleasures, are, Quiet
in the Mind, and Ease in the Body; the two General Maladies, are, Trouble in
Mind, and Pain in the Body: But Slavery can be no Bondage, if the Mind can be
content withal; yet the Mind cannot be pleased, if the Body be in Pain; it may
be Patient, but not Content: for Content is when the Mind desires not change of
the Condition of the Life.

The Cause of Tears and Laughter.
ANY Extraordinary Motion in the Spirits causes Tears, for all Motions heat
according to their Degrees, and Heat does rarifie and separate the thinnest
Substance from the thickest, as Chemists know right well; and all very thin
Bodies are fluent, and, as I may say, agil; and all that are fluent and agil,
seek passage and vent: So as a Man in this may be similiz'd to a Still, as, the
Atteries for the Furnace of the Still, where the Fire, which is Motion, is put
in; the Heart, the Pan of the Still, where the several Passions, as several
Herbs, are put in; the Head, the Cover of the Still, where the Vapor of herby
Passions ascends; the Eyes, the Spout where it runs, or drops forth. Laughter
is produced, as Tears are, by Extraordinary Motions, by which Extreme Laughter
will cause Tears.

Of Tears.
SOme say, Tears are the Juice of the Mind, pressed with Grief: But Tears
proceed from Joy, as well as from Sorrow; and they are increased by the
Moisture of the Brain; in some the Spring is dried. But all Passions are apt to
pump out Tears, as Extreme Sorrow, which contracts and congeals, by drawing all
inward; and the reason why Tears be salt, is, because the Head is a Limbeck,
which extracts the thinner part from the thicker, which thicker is purged by
the Nose and Mouth: But Tears, which are the Essence of Spirits, become a kind
of a Vitriol.

Of Musicians being sometimes Mad.
THE reason why Musicians are so often Mad, is not always Pride, bred by the
conceit of their rare Art and Skill, but by the Motion of the Music, which is
swifter than the ordinary Motion of the Brain, and by that reason distempers
the Brain, by increasing the Motion of the Brain to the Motion of the Fiddle;
which puts the Brain so out of tune, as it is very seldom tuneable again; and
as a Ship is swallowed by a Whirlpit in the Sea, so is Reason drowned in the
Whirlpit of the Brain.

Comparing the Spleen to a Loadstone.
THE Spleen is like a Loadstone, which draws Steel unto it; and as the
Loadstone is as it were nourished by Steel, so the Spleen is opened and cleansed.

Of Physic.
THE reason why most Men are addicted to the taking of much Physic, is, out of
love to Life, thinking that Physic prolongs it.

I Am about to publish an Additional Part, to join with my Book of
Philosophical Fancies, which, by reason some part treats of Diseases, I
recommend to Physicians; I mean not Empiricks, or Mountebanks, such as take the
Name, and never studied the Science, whose Practice is rather to kill than to
cure, which disgraceth that Noble Profession: But I mean those that are
Studious and Learned, such as have been bred in the Famous Universities, and
have received the Honor of Learning, as Batchellers and Masters of Art, or
Doctors, by which Honorable Title they are allowed to practice, as having
arrived to the height of that Science. To these Honorable and Learned Persons
I offer up that Work to their Grave Judgments, knowing from them it shall
never receive Injury, nor Affronts of Scorn, nor Rudeness: for those that are
Learned, and Understanding, are Just, and Civil, not wresting the words
crookedly, nor reading them impatiently, but weighing the Rational
Probabilities justly, measuring the Sense rightly, applying the Use aptly,
esteeming the Owners respectfully, and commending them civilly; When those that
are Ignorant, condemn and cry down all they understand not; and the rudely
spightfull, or the spightfully rude, strive to detract and disgrace all those
they think worthy of Praise or Commendation.

Of Fruits.
MOST are of Opinion that Fruits are cold, which we find contrary by the
Effect; for Wine which is made of Fruits is hot, as of Grapes, Rasberies,
Cherries, StrawberrieWine; and Sider and Perry, which are made of Apples and
Pears is hot like Wine too; for it will make a man drunk if he drink enough of
it, as well as Grape-wine or of any other Fruit; but some will say it is the
spirits that are pressed out which are in the Liquor, and by lying the spirits
grow stronger, and so become hot, which otherwise were not; but I answer to
that, that the pressing with the Teeth makes the Liquor not less hot than
another Press does, and for the Age it may grow the hotter for being sharpened;
but we find that it is very hot in the Press or Vat, for the very Steam where
they are pressed, will make men drunk, and they will go into the Liquor new
pressed, finding a benefit in curing cold Diseases; but no question some Fruits
are hotter than others (though none are cold) by having more or less spirits;
but all spirits have a sufficiency of spirits to heat, and the spirits lie in
the Liquor, not in the Solid parts, for all spirits dwell in the thinnest
Bodies or Parts, and are the subtillest in Operation; now may the solid part of
Fruit be cooling, when the spirits, which are the thinnest Juice, are hot, as
being baked, roasted, or boiled; where the effect of the Fire has evapourated
that Heat: But this Opinion is begot, by seeing many women, which eat much
Fruit, become pale and sickly; so men, by drinking much Wine, will become pale
and full of Diseases, and many times will have the contrary operation of
Complexions, and become very Red, though the inward cause is all one: for in
some it soaks and dries up all the Blood, or rarifies too thin, which makes the
Face pale; and in others it burns and crusts the Blood, which makes the Face
Red and Pimpled, so that it dries the Body by the Vitriol Humor, and burns the
Body by the unnatural Heat therein. Another Opinion why they hold them cold,
is, by the often Surfets many fall into by the much eating of it; and the
reason they give, is, because it is so cold it cannot digest. I answer, that
Surfets are caused by the Quantity, and not so much by the Quality: for there
are many that surfeit of strong Wines, by over-charging their Stomachs
therewith; and so in all Meats, which otherwise are good and wholesome, if not
immoderately taken, but according to their digesting Stomachs: for some will
surfeit of that Quantity, as others shall not with ten times more; such
difference is in the Natures and Constitutions of Men. There are many things by
the effect cooling, by being applied outwardly, which applying inwardly, work
the contrary: for Vinegar cools outward Inslammations, but shall increase an
inward one, being too tender for so sharp a Medicine; and all things that
corrode, make too much Motion, and all Motion heats. All Limmons, Citrons,
Oranges, Pomegranates, Barberies, Currants, and the like, are accounted very
cooling, being inwardly taken, and also very wholesome, which may be very good
and effectual, being applied to such Diseases as require a sharp Medicin, though
not cooling: But if they were cooling by their nature, as there is no great
reason to believe it, having as much Spirits as other Fruits have, by reason of
their fullness of Liquor, though I do not say that all sorts of Liquor are full
of Spirits, but such Liquors of such Natures; yet by the effect inwardly it
heats, for the very corroding Quality inflames the Blood more than the Nature
can cool; for all things that are sharp, have an ingraving Quality or Faculty,
not only to cut away Rotten and Superfluous Humors, but to eat upon the Noble
Parts.

Of Roots.
ROots are more nourishing than Fruits, by reason they have in a degree as much
moisture as Fruit, and have not that acuteness which Fruits have, which cause
not so many Spirits, but are soberer in their operations, and firmer: for
whatsoever has much Spirits, can never nourish much, because it grows too near
the nature of Fire; but it fits and prepares for Nourishment, knitting,
clensing, and strengthening the Digestive Parts; but those things nourish most,
where Heat and Moisture are equally mixed, which Roots come nearer to than
Fruits.

Of Herbs.
ONE would think there should be but little nourishment in Herbs, by reason
they are so much inclining to the nature of the Earth, which is of a drying
Quality; but we find it otherwise by the feeding and fatning of Beasts, which
live upon the Herbs of the Field. But some may say, that that which will
nourish Beasts, will starve Men, as Hay, and the Leaves of Trees, and the like:
But I answer, It is only Custom which has made it not agreeable with the
Stomachs of Men, and by that reason makes ill digestion, and so nourishes
not. But it is not always the Meat that causes ill or no nourishment, but
sometimes the Stomach: for an Ill Stomach shall corrupt Wholesome Meats, and a
Good digestive-Stomack shall convert Unwholesome Meat to Good Nourishment, but
may endanger the Stomach in using it often, not being accustomed to it before.
But of all Vegetables, there are none that have so many and so excellent
Qualities as Herbs, not only for curing both inward and outward Diseases, but
in preventing Diseases, besides the nourishment of Men and Beasts.

But there are many that will choose places for their Habitations to live in,
for the Air, though they be incommoded much otherwise, and want the Varieties
of Pleasures to entertain their Lives withal: for many think Long-life, though
it be spent dully, Pleasure enough. But the Trouble and Care to keep Health,
and the Fear to lose it, makes the Life not only dull, having their Thoughts
only employed upon that, but troublesome, and full of vexation, with barring
themselves of those things that otherwise they would willingly enjoy. Thus we
make Life worse than Death, if truly considered: for Death frights more than
hurts. But some will say, that may be, if Death would come before Sickness; but
it is to avoid Pain, not to prolong Life: But I answer, The troublesome care of
keeping't, is worse than the Disease it self; for the Disease of the Body will
take away the Pain in a short time, but a Disease of the Mind dwells with a Man
his whole Life.

Of Situation for Healths.
THose that would choose a Situation for Health, the Soil is more to be
considered than the Air, though Ill Air is bad; but Unwholesome Air comes from
Unwholesome Grounds, by the Vapors that arise from the Earth, and the Sun many
times clarifies the Air but in part: for many times in Moorish places the
Vapors may be too hard for the Sun; and if the Sun cannot be always
sufficient to clarisie the Air, how should it purify the Earth, that is so
solid? unless you will say, the Sun is a Chemist to draw Spirits, and those
Spirits subtle to the hurt of the Body; but when the Sun has that power, as to
make the Spirit of Air, as I may call it, being refined to that degree, as it
becomes a Cordial and a Refresher of the Spirits of all things: But when it
has only so much power as to draw up Vapor, which is the thin and watrish
part of the Earth, or as I may say, the Sweat of the Earth, which is sometimes
hot, and sometimes cold, having not the power of purifying, but condenseth it,
and makes it thicker, and so becomes the Shadow of another Earth, and makes us
as if we lived between two Earths, only the upper is thinner than the
undermost: for although the Sun is the Life to all things, out and upon the
Earth, by his Light and Heat, yet he is not so to the Bowels of the Earth; for
we find by experience, that a thin Wall will keep out the light of the Sun, and
the depth of a Cellar shall keep out the heat of the Sun: for in the hottest
Day, if one go down into a Vault, he shall be so cold, as he will desire to
come into the Sun again: so as we plainly find, that the Sun does not make Heat
in the Earth, but that the Earth has Heat of her own, and her own Heat, with
the moist Veins that are in her, produces those numerous Varieties, which,
some she casts forth, and some she keeps in: for those Varieties she casts
forth, are more of a nature than those she keeps within; for those she bars
forth, are Fruits and Plants, and the like, which only lie skin-deep, as one
may say; but those she keeps within her Bowels, are more solid and firm: for by
experience of Gold, and other Metals, we find, that she is hottest in her
Bowels, for they are always found deep and low; certainly it must be a great
Heat that must purify a Metal to that degree that Gold is: So that Gold, other
Metals, and whatsoever else lies deep within her, are not beholding to the Sun
for their Maturities, as Fruits and Plants are: And we see those things cast
forth are sickly and fading, and those she keeps in are lasting and durable;
which would make one think, the Earth has a more powerful Heat than the Sun,
because her Effects are greater than the Suns, setting his Light aside. The Sun
ripens the Fruit of the Face of the Earth, it agitates and lightens the Air,
whereby we see and breath: but the Earth is the Mother of all Vegetables,
Animals, and Minerals, and could produce a sufficiency of her self, without the
Heat of the Sun. But, as I was saying before, it is the Nature of the Soil that
not only causes Ill Airs, but Ill Nourishment; I mean not Ill in it self, but
being wrongly applied: for a Thick Air to a Sharp Constitution, is wholsomer
than a Subtiller and Thinner Air is; so a Glutenous is to a Sharp Constitution
better than a Salt and Penetrating Soil is: So as you may compare the Natures
of several Soyls to the Natures of several Humors and Constitutions; as there
are some Soyls apt to breed Melancholy, others Choler, some Phlegmatic and
Gross Humors, and some Sanguin; I mean not only dwelling upon such Soyls, but
eating of the Fruits and Meats thereof: for the Sun does not always mature the
Fruits of the Earth to such a degree as to make them wholesome, especially when
there is a Vicious Nature bred in the Earth: for some Ground is apt to breed
the Rot to some kind of Cattle, others the Murrain, and so several Diseases;
and as we see in Low Places, all their Fruit is waterish, and their Meat
spungier than in the High-land Country, though the Sun be in equal degrees; and
in Islands it is more apt to be, than in the Continents; and therefore some
parts of the Earth require much more Heat of the Sun than others do. And again,
in some places the Earth hardly requires the Sun at all, unless it be to see
the Fruits; and this alteration is not only in several Regions of the World,
but in Neighboring Patches also; as, we shall see one Field very Fruit full,
and the next Field to it very Barren, as some Stony, some Clayey, some Chalky,
and so sundry others; some are fit to bear Wheat, others Barley, some only Rye
or Oats, some Tares, Branck, and Hemp; some again so barren, as they will bear
nothing but Broom and Brakes; some Grounds feed great fat and firm Cattle,
others great but spungie, some lean and little; and several feedings will give
several tastes to one and the same kind of Cattle and Fruit, so as they may be
distinguished in what Grounds they grew, or were fed in. But some Cattle or
Plants will not thrive upon every Soil, though rich and good, being not proper
to their Natures, or to their Breedings; so it is with Men: for Custom may
make that wholesome, which otherwise would shorten Life; and that is good for
one Constitution, which would be pernicious to another; so as they must match
Grounds to Bodies.

Of Favorites to Princes, or Princes particular Privy Counselors.
A Prince that has a particular Favorite, or Privy Counselor, spins out the
life of his Heroic Fame with his Favors: for what Errors soever are
committed in Government, the Faults are laid to the Princes charge, as the
chief Head and Ruler, and all the Good Actions are attributed to the Favorites
wise Counselling: for if Money and Arms be raised, they will say it is the
Favorites popularity, not the Princes power.

If Armies march orderly, pitch methodically, fight succesfully, they will say
it is the Favorites conduct, not the Princes prudence, skill, nor courage.

If good and beneficial Laws be made, they will say they were propounded by the
Favorite, and only enacted by the Prince; that they come from the Favorites
head, not the Princes heart.

If the Virtuous be rewarded, and Offenders reprieved, or pardoned, they will
say it is the Favorites policy, not the Princes bounty or clemency.

In short, Nothing shall be prudently, justly, valiantly, or wisely done, but
shall be thought in the present, and published in the future, that all was done
by the counsel of the Favorite, especially if Fortune changes her Countenance
from Frowns to Smiles, when he is in Favor.

But a Wise Prince makes his own Breast the Cabinetchamber, his own Thoughts
his Privy Counselors, his own Judgment his Particular Favorite, and his own
Arm his Chief Commander: But Good Fortune gives Fame an Applause, and Bad
Fortune makes Fame go upon Crutches.

The Inventory of Judgments Commonwealth, the Author cares not in what World
it is established.
THis Commonwealth to be composed of Nobility, Gentry, Burgesses, and Pezants,
in which are comprised Soldiery, Merchantry, Artificers, Laborers,
Commanders, Officers, Masters, Servants, Magistrates, Divines, Lawyers, etc.

This Commonwealth to be governed by one Head or Governor, as a King, for one
Head is sufficient for one Body: for several Heads breed several Opinions, and
several Opinions breed Disputations, and Disputations Factions, and Factions
breed Wars, and Wars bring Ruin and Desolation: for it is more safe to be
governed, though by a Foolish Head, than a Factious Heart.

Item, That this Royal Ruler to swear to the People to be Careful and Loving,
as well as the People swear Duty and Fidelity.

The Contracts betwixt the King and people should be these.

Item, That the Militia be put in the Royal Hand: for since Power lies in the
Militia, the Militia ought to lie in the Kingly Power; for, without Power,
Authority and Justice are as Ciphers, which signify nothing.

For which the King shall contract by Promise and Oath, never to give Honors
but to the Meritorious.

Item, That if there should be any Dispute betwixt the Royal Command, and the
Public Subjection, there should be two Men chosen, the one for one side, and
the other for the other; these to be approved of, both for their Honesty,
Wisdom, and Courage, as neither to fear Power, nor Censure, to be free from
Bribes, Self Ends, Passions and Partiality, Experienced and Known Men in the
Kingdom, or at least as able as any therein, to decide all Differences, and
conclude all Disputes, and present all Grievances to the Royal Power, and
return his Will, Pleasure, and Desires to the People: for Great Counsels do
rather insnarl all Public Business, than rectify Errors, by reason of their
Various Opinions, and Humoursome Differences, with their Covetous Byasses, and
Popular Ambitions.

Item, That the Royal Ruler shall contract with the People, never to give
Honors, either for Favor, or sell them for Gain, but to reward the
Meritorious, and grace the Virtuous; which will stop the Mouth of Murmr,
temper the Spleen of Malice, clear the Eyes of Spite, and encourage Noble
Endeavors.

Item, All those that keep not up the Dignity of their House by the Ceremony of
the Titles, shall be dishonored and degraded, as base, and unworthy thereof,
in neglecting the Mark of their own, or their Ancestors Merits.

Item, All those that speak against Honor, or Titles, or give them not the due
respect, shall never be created thereunto.

Item, It shall be Death for any Herald at Arms to give Arms for Price, or
Favor, but to those are worthy thereof, as those that have purchased them by
their Merits.

Item, All those that speak against their Native Country, or tell Defects or
Weaknesses, or rail or dishonor their Countrymen, shall be banished therefrom,
or thereout.

Item, That the Royal Ruler shall have no particular Favorite, they being for
the most part Expensive, Proud, Scornful, and Mischievous, making difference
betwixt the King and People, by fomenting Errors until they make them seem
Crimes, and creating Jealousies, by making doubts of the Peoples Fidelity; and
Favorites most commonly tread upon the Necks of the Nobility, and ride upon
the Backs of the Gentry, and pick the Purse of the Commonalty, justle Justice
out by Bribery, and many times unthrone Royalty through Envy to them, which
causes a hatred to the Prince, for perchance perceiving this Favorite neither
to have Worth nor Merit, only a Flattering Tongue, that inchants a Credulous
Prince. Therefore a Prince should have no Favorite but Justice, no Privy
Counselor but his own Breast, his Intention never to be disclosed but when he
puts it in Execution.

Item, This Royal Ruler to have none of those they call their Cabinets, which
is a Room filled with all useless curiosities, which seems Effeminate, and is
so Expensive, bestowing infinite Sums, almost to the impoverishing of a
Kingdom, only to fill a Room with little cut, carved Statues, and Models of
Stones and Metals; as also diverse Toys made of Amber, Cornelion, Agats,
Chrystals, and diverse sorts of Shells, and the like; which Room might be better
employed, and to more use, in placing Famous and Learned Authors Works, as a
Library, which the whole Kingdom may draw Knowledge and Understanding from,
and the Money employed to more famous Curiosities than Shells, or the like, As
in stately Monuments, which shows a Kingdom in a Flourishing Condition, and
gives it a Noble Grace, and makes it a Wonder abroad, and a subject of
Discourse amongst Strangers, inviting curious and inquisitive Travelers from
all Nations to view the Structures thereof.

Besides, It makes a Prince seem Effeminate, which is a disgrace to the
Commonwealth, and Foreign Nations will despise it, when they see or hear that
the Prince is so mean a Spirit, as to take delight in Toys, spending their
time in looking on Shells, Beads, and Babies. For those of Heroic Spirits take
Delight to see their Soldiers in Arms, to view their Fortifications, Forts,
and Frontiers, to behold their Stately Architecture, Navigable Rivers, their
Safe Havens, Sailing Ships, with their Rich Fraights.

Likewise, They delight in Crowns, Scepters, and Thrones, by which they hold
Power, and keep up Authority, making Obedience, Fear, and Subjection; making it
their Pastime to hear Suits, to decide Causes, to give Justice. And their
Sports like the old Olympic Games.

After these Contracts between the Sovereign and the People, there follow the
Laws and Decrees in the Commonwealth.

As first, concerning the Clergy.

Item, That those that exercise the Divine Function, be not preferred for
Learning, but for Life, as being honest in their Parish, or Diocese, not
exacting more Tithes than their due; also Exemplary in their Actions, Sober in
their Behavior.

Item, That no Divine shall study Controversy, or at least not to dispute, but
to preach according to the Doctrine that is allowed to be believed and
followed: for Learned Disputes and Controversies are apt to smother a Lively
Faith, and quench out a Flaming Zeal.

Item, That no Sermons shall be preached, by reason they do more harm than
good, troubling the Conscience of the Fearful, the Heads of the Ignorant, and
the Ears of the Wise: But there shall be Prayers said in every Parish Church
once a Day, and the Moral Laws, the Divine Laws, and the National Laws, with
their threatening punishments, and promising rewards, shall be read and repeated
once a Week.

Item, That no Physician shall be allowed to study more than one Disease, or at
least practice the Cure but of one, lest they make by their half-knowledge and
understanding, a Confusion in the Body for want of Experience.

Item, That all Suits shall be heard, pleaded and decided in the space of half
a Year.

Item, It shall be Death for any to sell Land that is any ways engaged, or
entangled, lest it should ruin the Buyer thereof.

Item, That all Landlords and Freeholders shall be bound to plant Timber for
Ships, Hemp for Sails, and Tow for Cordage, if the Land be an Isle.

Item, There shall be a set Stipend for Wages, Fees, Rewards, Sales, or
Purchases; also of all Merchandises, that Cosenages, Briberies, Extortions, and
the like, may be eschewed.

Item, That none shall execute the Function of two several Trades, nor be
employed in more than in one Office, lest they should perform none well.

Item, That no Alchymy-Lace, nor Stuffs, nor Counterfeit Pearls, Diamonds, and
the like, shall be worn, nor sold, unless the Counterfeit be sold at as high a
price as the Right, or the Right to be sold at as low a rate as the
Counterfeit; and as different Sexes are distinguished by their Habits, so
different Habits should distinguish different Qualities, Professions, and
Degrees.

Item, That all degrees of Titles shall be distinguished by their Habits and
Ceremonies, as well as by their Arms, Titles, Patents, and Creations.

Item, No Men shall wear Swords in time of Peace but Gentlemen, and in the Wars
there shall be some differences of Arms to make distinction.

Item, That no Officer, neither in Martial Command, nor Civil Government, shall
be chosen or employed, but such as have Abilities to execute their Authorities,
and able to discharge their Duties.

Item, Rewards shall be as frequent as Punishments, lest Industry should grow
careless, and the Flame of Heroic Spirits be quenched out.

Item, None shall make Great Feasts, and Sumptuous Entertainments, but for
Foreign Persons of Quality, or Strangers that travel to see the Kingdom, where
they may see the Plenty, Riches, and Magnificence thereof, that they may not
despise it when they return to their own Native Country, but give cause to
renown it in their Relations.

Item, All Detracting or Slandering Tongues shall be clipped and the more the
Detraction or Slander is, the greater slices shall be cut therefrom.

Item, That the People shall have set times of Recreation, to ease them from
their Labors, and to refresh their Spirits.

Item, That all Noble Youths shall be bred by Experienced Age, to persuade,
admonish, and correct by Grave Authority, instructed by Virtuous Examples,
taught Honorable Principles, and the practice of Heroic Actions; their only
Playfellows shall be the Muses; the Grave and Sober Companions, the Sciences;
the Domestic Servants, and Acquaintance, the profitable and useful Arts for
the Life of Man.

As for the generality of Youth, they shall be bred to Silent Attentions, Sober
Demeanors, Humble Obediences, Handsome Customs, and Graceful Arts: As for the
meaner sort of Youth, to Trades of Arts, and Arts of Trades, for the use and
benefit of the Commonwealth.

Item, No Children shall speak before their Parents, no Servants before their
Masters, no Scholars before their Tutors, no Subject before the Prince, but
either to answer to their Questions, to deliver a Message, or to know their
will and pleasure, to declare their Grievances, to ask pardon for Faults
committed, or to present an humble request in the most humblest manner, unless
they command them to discourse freely to them, yet not without a respect to
their Presence and Authority.

Item, For the Generality, none shall speak but to ask rational, dutiful, and
humble Questions, to request just Demands, to discourse of probable Arguments,
to defend Right and Truth, to divulge Virtue, to praise the Meritorious, to
pray to Heaven, to ask Mercy, to move Pity, to pacisie Grief, to assuage Anger,
to make an Atonement, and to instruct the Ignorant.

Item, All shall be accounted Wise, that endure patiently, that live peaceably,
that spend prudently, that speak sparingly, that judge charitably, that wish
honestly, and that obey Authority.

Item, All Men that may live quietly at home, and travel to no purpose, or that
neglect their own Affairs to follow the Affairs of other Men, or decide those
Men's Quarrels they shall have no thanks for, or live upon hopes of great
Fortunes, of high Favors, when they may feed upon present Comfort, and enjoy
humble Delights in that Estate and Condition they possess, shall wear a Fools
Cap, and a Motly Coat.

Item, That none shall live at a greater Expense than their Estate will allow
and maintain.

Item, That all Spendthrifts shall be condemned for Fools, all Gamesters for
idle Miscreants, all Drunkards for Madmen; a Bedlam provided for the Drunkards,
a Bridewell for Gamesters, and an Hospital with Long Coats for Spendthrifts.

Item, All Men that beget Children shall strive to provide for them, by their
Thrifty Managements, or Industrious Labors.

Item, No Man shall Father a Whores Child, or Children, unless he were sure he
were the Father, which few can tell; otherwise it makes a Wise Man seem a Fool,
as being facile.

Item, It shall be accounted not only a double Crime, but a Baseness equal to
Cowardice, and a disgrace equal to a Cuckold, for a Gentleman to court, or make
love to a Common Whore, who is an Alms- Tub of Corruption; but if a Gentleman
must or will have a Whore, let him have one of his own making, and not feed
upon Reversions.

Item, That no Husband shall keep a Household Friend, lest he should make love
to his Wife, and he become a Cuckold thereby.

Item, No married man or Master of a Family, shall kiss or make love to his
Maid, nor Serving-men to their Mistrisses, lest they should grow idly Amorous,
impertinently Bold, rudely Saucy, neglecting their Duty to their Mistress or
Master, through scornful Pride.

Item, In all public Company all Husbands shall use their Wives with Respect,
unless they dishonor themselves with the neglect thereof.

Item, No Husband nor Wife, although but a day married, shall kiss each other
in public, lest it turn the Spectators from a lawful and wholesome Appetite of
Marriage, to a gluttonous Adultery, or weakening the Appetite so much as to
cause a Loathing, or an aversion to the Wedlock Bed.

Item, No Wife shall entertain an Admiring Servant, lest her Husbands and her
own Reputation be lost or buried in his admiring Courtships; nor their Hearts
to receive and return Love to none but their Husbands, no not Platonic love,
for the Conversation of Souls, is a great temptation to Amorous Friendship;
indeed the Soul of a Platonic Lover is a Baud to the Body.

Item, That Dancing be commendable as a graceful Art in Maids or Batchelors,
but shall be accounted an Effeminacy for married Men, a May Game for Old men,
and and Wanton Lightness for Married Women.

Item, That no woman of quality should receive Visits or give Visits, but in
public Meetings, nor have any whisperings or private Conference, that her
Actions might have sufficient Witness, and her Discourses a general Audience.

Item, That none shall marry against their own liking or free choice, lest they
make their Marriage an excuse for Adultery.

Item, It shall be allowed for Maids to entertain all Honorable, as Matrimonial
Suitors, until such time as she has made choice of one of them to settle her
Affections upon; for it is good reason one should take time and observe Humors,
before they bind themselves in Wedlock Bonds, for when once bound nothing but
Death can part them; but when they are once married, their Ears to be sealed
from all Loves pleadings, protestings, Vows making, high praises, and
Complementall phrases.

Item, That none shall keep a Mistress above half a year, but change, lest she
grow more imporious than a Wife made of a Widow.

Item, All Lovers shall be licensed to bragg or speak well of themselves to
their Mistress, when they have done no meritorious Actions to speak for them.

Item, All those that have Beauty enough to make a Lover, if they have not wit
to keep a Lover, shall be accounted no better than a senseless Statue.

Item, It shall not be, as it is in these Days, accounted a prise or purchase
amongst Ladies, to get either by their Wit or Beauty, admiring Servants,
especially if they be of amorous natures; for then Nature drives them to her
Beauty or Wit, more than her Wit or Beauty draws them to it.

Item, All those that are proud without a cause, it shall be a sufficient cause
to be scorned.

Item, Eloquence shall not be employed nor pleaded in Amorous Discourses, nor
to make Falsehood to appear like Truth; but to dress and adorn Virtue that she
may be accepted and entertained by those that will refuse and shun her
acquaintance if she be clad in plain Garments.

Item, There shall none condemn another Language, nor account another to be
better, if it be Significant, Copious and Eloquent, such as the English Tongue
is.

Item, All passionate Speeches, or Speeches to move passion, shall be expressed
in Number.

Item, That all Natural Poets shall be honored with Title, esteemed with
Respect, or enriched for the Civilizing of a Nation, more than Contracts, Laws
or Punishments, by Soft Numbers, and pleasing Phansics; and also guard, a
Kingdom more than Walls or Bulworks, by creating Heroic Spirits with
Illustrious Praises, inflaming the Mind with Noble Ambition:

Noble Souls, and Strong Bodies.
THough Noble Souls, and great Wits, dwell not constantly, nor are allwaies
created in Strong Bodies, yet if Nature did choose her Materials, match her
Works, and order her Creatures rightly and Sympathetically, Strong Bodies
should have noble Souls, large Capacities, and great Wits; for Weak Bodies many
times are a defect in Nature, as much as shallow Wits, or irrational Souls: But
surely, if the chief and first Nature would work methodically, and not seem as
if she wrought at random, and to produce by Chance, as she does; if Education
and Custom, which is a second Nature, had not such a prevalent power to
disturb and obstruct her; and though Education and Custom, may and does
sometimes rectify some Defects, and help Life; yet it does more often puzzle
Life, and incumber Natures Works, putting Nature out of the right ways with
False Principles, Foolish Customs, and ill Education; this is the reason
natural Wits are many times lost, not having time or leisure to exercise them,
or use them (as I may say) or for want of variety of Subjects or Objects to
better them; or dulled by tedious and unprofitable Studies, or quenched out by
base Servitude or Subjection: Also clear Understandings are darkened, sound and
strong Judgments weakened, and false Judgments given, and vain Conceptions and
erroneous Opinions Maintaind or Believed, for want of the True and the Right
Ways.

Likewise the streught of the Body oftimes is weakened and effeminated by
Luxury, Curiosity, and Idleness; which causes Noble Souls, Large Capacities,
Clear Understandings, Fine Fancies, and Quick Wits to dwell many times, nay
most commonly, in weak Bodies; for the better sort have most commonly more
Plenty than Health, the one devouring the other; when the Meaner sort have
meager Souls, and barren Brains; Rude Dispositions, and Rough Natures; have
strong Limbs, strengthened by Exercise, and maintained by Labor; healthful
bodies kept in repair by Temperance, caused by scarcity and Poverty; contented
minds, bred by Low Fortunes, and Humble Desires; when Wealth and Dignity create
Vain Glory and Pride: yet many times small Fortunes and great Wits agree best
together, but Noble Minds and Great Estates do the most good. But in this Age,
although it be the Iron Age, yet those men that have Effeminate Bodies, as
tender Youth, loose Limbs, smooth Skins, fair Complexions, fantastical Garbs,
affected Phrases, strained Complements, factious Natures, detracting Tongues,
mischievous Actions, and the like, are admired, and commended more, or thought
wiser than those that have Cenerous Souls, Heroic Spirits, Ingenuous Wits,
prudent Forecast, Experienced Years, Manly Forms, Graceful Garbes, Edifying
Discourses, Temperate Lives, Sober Actions, Noble Natures, and Honest Hearts:
but in former years it was otherways; for Heroic Spirits in Masculine Forms
had double praise, as is expressed in the Grecian and Trojan Wars; and Princes
were bred to labor as much as Pesants; for though their Labor might be
different, the one being Servile, the other Free, yet the Burden and
pains-taking might be Equal; though they carried not Pedlars Packs, nor Porters
Burdens, yet they carried thick and heavy Arms; and if they handled not the
Sith, Pitch-Fork, and Flail, yet they handled the Sword, the Spear, the Dart,
the Bow, the Sling, and the like; and if they knew not how to Mow, to Reap, and
to Thrash, yet they knew how to Assault, to Defend, and to Fight; and though
they dug not the Gold out of the Mines, yet they dug Fortisications out
of the Earth; and if they set not Flowers on Banks, or sowed Seeds in Furrows,
or ingrafted Slips, or planted Trees to grow, yet they set Armies in battle
Array, and sowed Lives in Adventures, ingrafted Honor to the Stock of their
Predeceslors, and planted Fame to grow high in after Ages; and though they
drive not the Asses, yet they manage the Horses, and if they want the Art to
Yoke Oxen, they want not the wisdom to Yoke the Vulgar with strickt Laws; and
if they will not drive a Flock of Sheep to the Fold, they can lead a Number of
Men to the Wars; and if they cannot build a House, yet they can storm a City:
Thus galiant labors may strengthen the Bodies of Honorable Breed and Noble
Minds, freely and industriously, without a Bondage or Slavery; nay they may Row
in Galleys, yet not be subject to the Whip or Chains. But as Masculine Bodies
and Heroic Souls had a double esteem, so Effeminate Bodies and timorous
Spirits, or rather Natures, had a double despising, as witness Paris of Troy;
but most Nations in those Ages, spent their time in useful Arts, not in vain
Dressings; they wore Horse-Tails in Head-pieces for Terror, not Light Feathers
for Show; their Pride lay in their Arms, not in their Clothes; in their
Strength, not in their Beauty; in their Victories, not in their Dancings; in
their Prudence, not in their Vanities; their Wealth was spent in Hospitality,
not in Prodigality; their Discourse was to Instruct, not to make Sport; neither
in former years was Old-ages counsel refused for Youths Advice; Age was
accounted an Honor, and respect was given to the Silver Hairs, Youth, an
Effeminacy, pitying their Follies; And Youth in former Ages learnt with
Patience, what Age taught with Judgment; and with Pains, what Skill taught
with Industry; As to drive Charriots, ride Horses, bear Arms, hold Shields,
throw Darts, to Fence, to wrestle, to Skirmish, to train Men, to pitch Camps,
to set Armies, to guide Ships; Not to Dance, to Sing, to Fiddle, to paint, to
powder, as many men do now adays; Youth did then listen with attention to
Grave Instructions, and receive reproofs with Submission, kept silence with
sober Countenance obeyed with willing hearts and ready hands, where now adays
Youth is bold and rude, talks loud, speaks Nonsense, slights Age, scorns
Councels, laug's at Reproves, glories in Vices, and hates Virtue. It Is true
many will go into the War and kill one another, though many times they run
away; but it is rather Rashness that sights, than true Valor, where Fortune
gives the Victory, and not Pallas, or rather Time, for those that run first
away lose the day: Thus in former Ages were Bodies and Minds matched; but I
speak of Stength, to show that Women that are bred, tender, idle and ignorant
(as I have been) are not likely to have much Wit; nor is it fit they should be
bred up to Masculine Actions, yet it were very fit and requisite they should be
bred up to Masculine Understandings; it is not fit for Women to practice the
behavior of Men, yet it is fit that Women should practice the Fortitude of
Men; But Women now adays affecting a Masculincy, as despising their own Sex,
practice the behavior of Men, not the spirits of Men; nor their Herroick
Behavior, but their Wild, Loose, Rude, Rough or foolish attected Behavior;
they practice the Masculine Confidency or Boldness, and forget the Esseminate
Modesty; the Masculine Vice, and forget the Esseminate Virtues; as to talk
Impudently, to Swagger, to Swear, to Game, to Drink, to Revell, to make
Factions, but they practice not Silence, Sobriety, Reservedness, Abstinency,
Patience or the like; they practice the Masculine Cruelty, quitting their
tender and gentle Natures, their sweet and pleasing Dispositions: But these
Actions and Humors are so far from preferring our Sex to a higher Degree, that
they do debase and make us worse than other Creatures be; but I beseech my
Readers to believe I speak not of Envy or Spite, for I am guilty of neither,
but out of a grieved love to my own Sex, nor of any particular Nations, but of
the World in general, I mean as much as I have heard of; likewise that my
Readers will not mistake me, as to think I belive, that great Giantly Bodies,
or strong course Clowns have the greatest Wit and deepest Understanding, for we
see to the contrary most commonly, they being the most Ignorant Fools, and
Cowardly spirits; but I mean that if they had large strong healthful bodies,
which might be obtained by Heroic Labors and Exersises, and if their spirits
were answerable to their bodies, which might be infused by good Education, they
might have a double or treble Portion of Rational Understanding; but most
commonly large Bodies are like populated Kingdoms that are Barren for want of
Cultivating, and becomes defensless and open to an Enemy, for want of
Fortification, which is Fortitude; for Fortitude is an Overflow, or a
Superabounding of Spirits, when Fear is a Scarcity or Contracting thereof; the
like of Wit and Understanding; for from the Quantity and Agilness of the
spirits in the Brain produces Wit, and from the Quantity and Strength of the
Spirits in the Brain, produces Understanding; But if I were to choose a Sex, I
had rather be a Pigmy, stuffed with rational spirits, than a Giant empty thereof:
but a Middle Stature is most becoming, a Little the most Agil, and a Great the
most Dreadful, like a private Family; for a small Family has the least
Expense, a Great Family the most Disorder, a Competent Family the best
Governed: Or like Marriage, a Beautiful Wife Delights most, a Witty Wife
pleases best, a Chaste Wife makes a man the Happiest.

So a Valiant Husband is most Esteemed, a Wise Husband best beloved, and an
Honest Husband makes a Wife the happiest; when a Coward is scorned, a Fool
despised, and an Inconstant Husband hated.

The like is a Choleric Wife, an Unconstant Wife, and a Sluttish Wife.

IT is strange to observe the forgetfulness, or the boldness, or the
foolishness of many men in the World, that will not only take Learned Men's
Opinions and Arguments, and discourse of them as if they were their own, to the
very Authors themselves, word for word, which shows Ridiculous and Mad; but
most times they will gravely write them, as if they were never writ or divulged
before, by which Actions one would think they were of Kin to the Jackanapes.

Others are as Base as those are Ridiculously Foolish, which will bribe the
Printer or Bookseller, to let them see such Copies, and so will steal out their
best Phansies, or Opinions, or Arguments, and print them before the others come
out; wherefore, it is just in the Readers, to examine the Grounds; for if any
have done so unworthy an Act, the Theft will be as easily seen, for it will
appear in the Face, lying but skin-deep, but never come near the Fundamental
parts; wherefore all Writers that Strike, Justle, or Imbraee one another, and
that are published or Printed in a short space of time of one another, are to
be examined, to find out the Right and Truth, and to condemn the Thief and
punish the Crime with Reproach and Infamy.

But I would have this Monarchy I make,
To have a Judge * that will good Counsel take; I call the chief Ruler Judge as
they did in the old Law or Time.

One that is wise to govern, and to see
What Faults to mend, and what the Errors be,
Making the Commonwealth his only Minion,
Striving for to enlarge his own Dominion,
To love his People, with a tender Care,
To wink at Frailties which in Nature are,
And Just to punish Crimes, as hatingill,
Yet sorry for the Malefactor still;
Glad to reward, and Virtue to advance
In real Favors, not in Countenance,
Not to pay Merits with good Words and Smiles;
(Dissembling Promises poor Men beguiles)
Nor yet good Services are done long past,
(Ungrateful Souls will in Oblivion cast)
But have the Eye of Memory so clear,
The least good Service shall to him appear.
Nor would I have one idly to neglect
His Peoples safety, but for to protect
Their Lives and Goods, with all the care he can,
And upright Justice to the poorest Man;
To be a Father to the Commonwealth,
And a Physician to restore them Health,
By purging out the Humors, which are Crlmes,
Which Crimes, like corrupt Humors, breed oft-times
Factious Diseases, which without all doubt
Would Ruin bring, if timely not cast out:
No cruel Scarlet Favorite to make,
Nor Pleading, Fauning, Cheating men to take
Into their Bosoms, who with Gouty Pride
Straight swell so bigg, they must on Shoulders ride,
Or else on Noble Cush'ons they must lie,
To bear them up; but often the Feathers fly,
If Pride do press too hard, and often they take
Some great men's Fames, thinking thereby to make,
In giving Praises high, a Screen to hide
The face of Favor, but the Tail is spide.
Nor such a Judge, as one that takes delight
To play at Cards and Dice most of the Night;
Or drink till drunk, then carried to his Bed,
As to a Grave, he seeming like one dead,
When he those watchful hours, and times should spend
In thinking which way he should Errors mend;
For Commonwealths what ere, and Kingdoms, Realm,
Like Garments, have full many a Stitch and Seam:
This Public Garment ost the Prince must view,
Where it is rent, cause't to be sticht a new,
Or else it soon wears out, in pieces fall,
And though they patch, it will not last at all.
Nor such a Judge, so timorous, lives in fear,
And durst not, without Guards, walk any where,
Which starts at every Noise, or Object see,
If strange and new those Sounds and Objects be;
Suspects the Light, yet Darkness hates like Hell,
And thinks Conspiracy in's sleep does dwell,
And with this Fear a Tyrant he becomes,
And then he Massacres, and Martyrdoms
All his best Subjects, free from factious strife,
That Loyal are, and wish him longer life,
But scorn to flatter, or applaud his Crimes,
But keep up Right, and Honor in their minds,
Nor are they guilty, in Word, Deed, or Thought,
But by Suspicion judged, to Slaughter brought;
Bnt all the innocent Blood that they do splll,
Like to a Sea, flows to their Conscience ill;
And every Thought that moves within their Brain,
Appears like Ghosts of Men that they have slain;
And when they dye, into despair they fall,
Or like a Beast or Stone, no Sense at all.
Nor such a Judge that is given to the Splrit,
Or so devout as Heaven he thinks to merit,
Prays Night and Day, or Beads do number ore
Upon cold Stones, Joves Altar kneels before,
Unfit in Earthly Government to Reign,
For Prayer seldom does a Kingdom gain,
Nor keeps in safety from an Enemy,
But leaves his People all to Slavery;
For if he praying be, whilst they do Fight,.
They Will soon be taken, or be put to flight;
Jove Courage gives to Man, as well as Zeal,
And Prudence for to Rule a Commonweal;
And doing Justice, pleases Jove far more
Than lazy Praying, idly to implore
His great assistance which he seldom gives,
Unless no hope of Human Help there lives.
Jove gives man Strength, himself for to defend,
Which, if he uses not, may Jove offend.
But such faint-hearted Prince, is fitter for
A private life, than Kingdom that is in War;
And fitter to Obey, than to Command,
Or Rule and Reign, in Peace, War, Sea or Land;
And fitter far it were, whilst he does live,
That he the Sovereign Power up did give
Unto a Kinsman, or himself did choose
A Wise and Valiant man, that Power to use,
Not but Religious Orders are right meet;
For why, Religion is the Public Feet
On which the Commonwealth in safety stands,
And Ceremonies are the Sacred Hands
To Consecrate good Custom, Dutious Zeal,
And make Obedience in a Commonweal.
The Judge I choose, his Wisdom shall be such,
The whole Worlds Government shall seem not much,
In which of all the Planets there must Reign
I do not care, I tell my Readers plain.
OF all my Works, this Work which I have Writ,
My best Beloved, and greatest Favorite,
I look upon it, with a pleasing Eye,
I Pleasure take in its sweet company,
I entertain it with a Grave Respect,
And with my Pen am ready to Protect
The Life and Safety of it, against all those
That will oppose it, or profess its Foes;
But I am sure there is none Condemn it can,
Unless some Foolish and unlearned Man,
That has not Understanding, Judgment, Wit,
For to perceive the Reason that is in it.
