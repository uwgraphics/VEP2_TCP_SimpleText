A REMEDY against Dissension: OR, A help to settle men's minds in these
unsettled times, and to make up the Rents, made, and likely to be made through
the late lamentable increase of Opinions and PRACTICES.

As it was delivered in a Sermon on Romans 16, 17. By I. R. Minister of the
Gospel.

Cant. 3.5. I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the Roes, and by the
Hinds of the field, that ye stir not up nor awake my Love, till she please.

1 Cor. 14.33. For God is not the Author of confusion, but of peace, as in all
Churches of the Saints.

Augustine in Johan. tract. 104.

-- ut in illo pacem haberent, propter quod totum agitur quod Christiani sumus.
Haec enim pax finem temporis non habebit, sed omnis piaenostrae intentionis
actionis que, finis ipsa erit.

Romans 16.17. I beseech you brethren, mark them who cause divisions and
offenses, contrary to the doctrine ye have learned, and avoid them.


RIght Honorable, Exodus 28.1.
and the rest beloved in Christ Jesus, your knowledge of the relation between
Moses and Aaron, magistrate and minister, state and church, religion and
policy, discharges all Apology, for choice of this Text, which like the
worlds great eye upon the hemisphere, limited to no region, city or person,
looks upon all duties humane and divine, therefore I beseech you --

The sum is an exhortation to vigilant constancy: Church and state are as a
besieged city: some assail aperto Mart, they are more easily discovered, some
insidiis, more mischievous are they who sting the bosom, which are shut up in
the infected veins: therefore I beseech you brethren mark them --

He had carefully prescribed, now he prohibiteth: the most divine precepts
cannot profit us, quid enim prodest antidotum cui superfunditur venenum? Tertul.
if some contrary evil corrupt us. He had by name described those whom they
should follow: he gives a character of false brethren without name ('it is the
candor of holy writ, liberal in honoring the Saints memories, to forbear
unnecessary branding sinners) it is the vice, not the person which is dangerous:
therefore I beseech you brethren, mark them who cause divisions and offenses,
contrary to the doctrine ye have learned, and avoid them.

The parts are the 1 Form which is hortatory: wherein note, the 1 Obtestation,
I beseech you. 2 Compellation. Brethren.
2 Matter, which is anadvertisementto a grand inquest, mark them, in Which

2 Delinquents concerning whom the Apostle uses this vehement entreatie,
authors of dissension which cause divisions, and offenses.
3 Mark by which they may be known, or the offense enquired after, divisions
and offenses: with the secret danger thereof, in that they are beside, and
near, but contrary to the doctrine. 4 Aggravation of the offense, from the 1
Rule against which the transgression is: the doctrine. 2 Example which
themselves have given, which ye have learned: it were desperate levity to
desert it now.


I beseech you. 1 (...). obsecro. August. in Romans ero-Ambros. (...). Occum in
Loc.
By a mild, and humble entreaty, he puts on the person of a suppliant: not
for the advance of his own profit, but theirs.

That which the ministers entreat you, is your own good, peace and salvation.
If thou be wise, thou shall be wise for thy self -- Prove. 9.12. so. Romans 12.1.
I beseech you brethren by the mercies of God -- to what end? that ye may prove
what is the good will of God. so Phil. 2.1. if there be any consolation in
Christ, if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit -- to what end?
that nothing be done through contention, that's your own good.

vobis coniunctim et divisim committimus et fir miter iniungendo mandamus --
not that he had not power of mandats (we are ambassadors for Christ: 2 Cor.
5.20.
as though God did beseech yeu through us, we pray you in Christ's stead that ye
be reconciled unto God, that is your own good) but because lenity can do more
then rigor, a mild hand makes better impression then then a rigid and
imperious injunction can: sanctity cannot be forced, neither will opinion: if
God should compel, he left no place for sin or sanctimony, which are only
in actions voluntary: the Devil cannot compel to sin, neither will God to
obedience: where necessity enforces, there is no sin; where compulsion
extorteth obedience, no sanctity. No man can be holy, or wicked, except he
will; the will must have a part in either, to denominate the good or evil. The
softened wax best takes the impression: therefore the Apostle placed this maine
exhortation amongst his salutes, which gave that temper to their affections:
it is a great matter to have a good opinion of the speakers love and integrity:
therefore meekness and lenity, is the only way to prevent, and retrench
discords, there is place for rigor, that's when lenity is impiously contemned:
Romans 13.
there are that carry not the sword in vain: but our part is entreaty.
Pastores facti sumus, non percussores: Gregor. Epist.
our commission is, that which was given Peter, Ioh. 21.15.16. Pasce oves meas,
not that Act. 10.13. kill and eat. When things (especially adiaphorous) are
too rigidly pressed, it wounds the infirm, and scandaleth the strong.
Lactantius said it well in general, Lib. 5.
religion cannot be compelled, verbis potius quam verberibus res agenda est.
when Peter smote Malchus in Christ's defense ( Malchus one of them who came to
lay impure and violent hands on Christ) he not only prohibited Peter's violence,
but healed Malchus ear, When the Holyghost descended on Christ, Cyprian.
'twas not in the form of an imperious eagle or bird of prey, but in the
likeness of an harmless dove. Violence and religion are unconsistent: not
that the corrupters thereof, and state-threatning schismatiks may not be
restrained, or punished: but because our sword is only spiritual: coercive
power by smiting uncurable parts, appertains to the civil Magistrate:
therefore where we have not power to prevent an imminent danger, we pray your
help. Therefore we beseech you brethren, mark them who cause divisions and
offenses, contrary to the doctrine ye have learned, and avoid them.

Our second part is the compellation, 2 Brethren.
Brethren -- it has a sweet violence to persuade, among the sons of God, The
name of brotherhood is an argument of unity, God intended it so, who made us
all of one parent, all brethren, and adopted us all in one Christ, in whom we
are all members of one body. Brethren to dwell together in unity; ecce quam
bonu^, and qua^ jucundum. It Is like the precious ointment upon the a capite

head (the love of cuius unctio omuem ecclesians penetr aret. Prosp. Romans 13.
Matthew. 5.
Christ descending upon the whole church) like the dew of Hermon (the nurse of
plenty) there the Lord promised the blessing: brotherly love is the sum, and
perfection of the law: the balance of the sanctuary, the sal foederis: without
it God accepts no service: if this fail, religion dies.

Abraham could find no such enforcing motive to peace, as this sacred name of
(...). Chrysostom. in. To. 32. in Romans Genesis 13.8. 3 Mark Them.
brother: let there be no contention between thee and me -- for we are
brethren -- if the spirit of adoption dwell in us, let it now prevail with us,
I beseech you brethren.

So come we from the form, to the matter, and first to the first duty mark
them -- we must diligently mark the causers of divisions and offense: we have
need of diligent caution, these De Arab. serpent. inquit solinus. 144. f.

beware of them and restrain them: some copies have (...) mark them
diligently, as Saul said of David, he is subtle and crafty, see therefore and
know all the secret places where he hides himself: if we would mark well, we
should find that it is the Devil who is the author of dissension: and wicked
men further it: therefore whether they veil their working, under pretense of
Zeal, care of reformation, or what ever other show of good, mark them well
who cause divisions: for (as the Romans once thought of their L. Florus, hist.
Romans l. z. c. 3. Major aliquanto labor erat invenire, quam vincere
Ligurian enemies) it is something more difficult to descry and find them out,
then to overcome them. They are of unwearied vigilance for mischief:
proportion your care hereto. 'Twas that which alluding to the name of (...),
the thief. Plut.
Demosthenes once seriously iested: my Lords of Athens (said he) how vigilant
ought we to be, seeing we have thieves of brass, and walls of clay.

He that keeps a treasure, watches all that come near it. Care has an
hundred eyes. You whose charge it is this day to mark offenders, mark them
diligently: because it is Gods work for the preservation of state and church:
we want no Zeal for secular matters: but when God and religion are interessed,
how few mark diligently? How rare are they who present, adulterers, factious
schismatics, profaners of sabboths, impious swearers, neglecters of Gods
service? when it is infallible, that from neglect of divine laws, flow all
contempts of humane. Wicked men in a state, are as ill humors in the body; if
they be not corrected, all must perish. he that punishes not the Qui de malis'

office to accuse and judge, mark them with your enditements: and be not
partial nor indulgent to sin. He that conceales another faults, makes them
his own. If you deceive the trust imposed on you: if you violate your oath to
God, to you must appertain that which Mordecai once Ester 4.14.
said in a like dangerous time, if thou bold thy peace at this time, comfort
and deliverance shall appear -- out of another place, but thou, and thy
fathers house shall perish, and who knows whether thou art come to this
office, for such a time? therefore mark them, and avoid them.

This is the second branch of the duty: authors of divisions, and offenses --

contagia laedant: it is a desperate contagion, there is no security but in quick
flight, and long distance from it: ill company bane of hopeful youth,
corrupter of innocence, sins broker, vices pander, virtues underminer, nurse
of impudence, modesties betrayer, gulf of many honorable patrimonies, unclean
sincke of sin, I beseech you mark and avoid all such: with how real a
blessing should I dismiss this congregation, if this one particle were fixed
in the heart and affection of every present auditor? how happy a church and
state should we presently see, if the innocent would withdraw themselves from
the company of corrupting Corahs. Satan could never prevail, did he not plow
with our heifer, and make men decoyes to betray men. What is that which
precipitates young prodigals to famine, nakedness, and so many illegal and
impious ways, to relieve themselves therein? what fills your prisons, and
brings so many good men's children to shame, and untimely ends, but ill company?
Indeed God made man a sociable creature, and said, it is not good for man to be
alone, there is no good without communion, ego ne in coelo solus: the most
blessed being is in a sacred society: but whereas God has set by thee so many
good men, in whose society thou might be happy, how wilfully do thou
perish, whom none but wicked company can please?

offerings, let not thy heart decline to her ways; avoid them which cause
divisions, and offenses.

We are next to consider the delinquents, 5 Who cause.
concerning whom this vehement caution is used, those who cause divisions. They
that cause evil are most pernicious: thieves, harlots, murderers, all
offenders are worthy to be marked, nigro carbone, with the charact. of justice;
but especially they, who like the Jonah 4.7.
worm of Ionahs gourd, bite the very root of law and policy, by causing
divisions and offenses: these two like Genesis 34.25.
Simeon and Levi come upon the republique, and destroy all masculine virtue of
religion, and policy, by discurrendo de domo in domum adulantes quibusdam --

a Bether, montem divisionis. In fault are they, who being seduced, become an
accession to a tumultuous, seperating or offending party: but they are worst
who cause the mischief: in every offense, worst is he who causes others to be
bad. To make the people naked as Aaron did, is a great sin: but a greater
sin was Balaams, who taught them to cast stumbling blocks, to make Israel
fall. To cause others to sin, is to be a Devil, or his factor: the most
fearful instance of Gods justice is he, who causing others to sin becomes
impardonable.

It has ever been a great wisdom in greatest interests, to meet mischiefs
with timely preventions, by removing their causes: therefore the prudent
heathen made sundry laws of prevention. Such was that of Lentulus, to punish a
matron paena stupri who was seen in public without her Sine stola. Tertul.
Apol. c. 6.
veil: 'twas to prevent whoredom. Such was the Calparnian law, and the
Ostracisme to prevent ambition, and oppression: such their Licinian law, to
prevent intemperance in diet. Such was Piso's law quas a provincialibus
quispiam nequiter extorfit. Alex. ab Alexand. l. 4.175.6. a.m.
de pecuniis repetundis, to prevent extortion, oppression, and seditions,
thence arising. Such their Censorian law, punishing him that neglected to prune
his vines, or take the best season to sow, spendthrifts, prodigalls, and
company-keepers, by sequestring the wife, and childrens part, to prevent the
many mischiefs flowing into the state, through the ruin of private families.

Prove. 6.16.
raises contentions among brethren, God abhors; the man that persuaded to
serve other gods, was to be stoned without pity; sin is most venomous in the
root: I beseech you mark them principally which any ways cause it in others.

Here are the faults to be marked: 1. dissension, 6. Divisions.
which is, (as Sueton. vit. Iul. Caes.
Sulla said) many Marii in one Caesar, all offenses in one. Dissension is a
fault against God, the God of peace: Religion the Doctrine of peace, and
community, and the public weal; for division imports plurality of united
parts, division pernicious to those parts whose life and safety is in unity:
Unity the unitas enim coercet omnia, and regit. Ambros. in Psalm. 118. prolog.
Salsedo combinans of the body politic, the sacred bond of peace; the nerves
of State, the state of the blessed; but (...). Chrysostom. qo. s. Iusidiarum

orat. 34.540. D.
divided, no not Satan's (the grand master of divisions) can stand: Dissensions
are the States Paralysis, policies dissenterie, bellows of devouring sedition;
therefore mark them that cause divisions. 1. Between God and man: Peccata
enim sola separant inter beminem, and Deum, August. de pec. mer c. 20.
all sins are within this latitude; for these, comes the anger of God upon
the children of disobedience; for these the Lord has a controversy with the
land; for these he forsakes a people, and counsel perishes from the ancient;
valor from the strong, and equity from the Judge; retro que feruntur res
Danaum, such was Isreal's case in their. Apostacy, whither soever they went
out, the hand of the Lord was sore against them.

2. Between Gods vicegerents and his people; mischeivous practicers,
whispering jealousies into the facred ears of Princes, to Qui a populo, and
amicis, Principem submovent, qui internuacii sunt aliud qua^ respondetur
referentes, claudentes Principem suu^, and agentes ante omnia ne quid sciat.
AEl^us. Lampr^d. Alex. sever.
alienate their affections from the people, to divide the head from the body:
(whereas the strength and securest treasuries of Princes, are their Subjects
loves) and scattering doubtful speeches, and seditious murmurings among the
people, to make them jealous of good Princes; as the tumultuous sounds from the
earths vast hollowes, are presages of ensuing earthquakes, and dreadful
Chasma's; such are these Chorahs murmurings.

3. Between the Prophets and the people, who under pretense of decrying the
ambition, corruption, and State-medling of some, show their hatred to all the
Ministers of Christ, flying on them with their Number. 16.3.
fat superque vobis, you take too much upon you seeing all the Congregation is
holy. I might say the Constantinus, in Synodo Nicaen libellos accipiens
quaerelarum plenos quos ei deprivatis injuriis obtulerant Episcopi, cos ne
legendos quide sibi esse putavit, sed continuo stammis tradidit. Ruffin. l. 1.

Hist. Council. Nicaen. Bin. To. 1. p. 321. etc. 4.322. I. vid. Rev. 8.10.11.
contempt of the Ministry is the window open to Haeresie, Satan's principal
advantage, to suggest ill opinions of good ministers, seeing contempt of their
persons will like a Gangren quickly creep on to the contempt of their Doctrine;
but I must tell you, that another danger is, that the sacred band of Religion
once cast off, they who despise Aaron, will easily rebel against Moses also.

4. Between neighbors, either embarking Princes and kingdoms in bloody
quarrels; or by innovation in Reliquerunt Apostolum; sequuntur Aristotclem,
reliquerunt sapientiam quae apud Deuta est, elegerunt disputationes,
tendiculas, and aucupia verborii, Ambrose in Ps. 118. Ser. 22.2.
Doctrine, or Ceremonies breeding Schisms and tumultuous factions, filling
their holy Mother the Church (like that Grecian stratagem) Armato milite; or
by factious speeches, and writings, begetting dislike of wholesome government
(this is that Star Absynthium, fallen into our waters, embittering the sweet
currents of our peace and unity, and almost turning them into blood) or by
setting debate between neighbors, as talebearers, and incendiaries use; or
like men sick of opinions Calenture, casting themselves overboard by Sola igitur

This is the heat of impatience in those who consider not the offenses in the

thereof?) and that many things were endured by the Orthodox ut causa and

Augustine said for excuse of Cyprian holding rebaptizing, and it was reverend
Beza's opinion, that the peace of our Church was not to be troubled for our
Ceremonies; divisions are desperate; the leprous parts may live, the divided
cannot; the Paschal Lamb was eaten in one house: Christ is no where
communicable but in his Church; Rahabs house was a type thereof, whosoever
goes out of it his blood shall be upon his head, Josh. 2.19. add hereto,
discord is the beginning of all evil; Laws are silent among Arms: divisions
in multitudes are storms upon great waters, which mischeivous breaths,
exagitate into rage: division in a State is as the bilging of a Shipp, breaches
in the wall, wounds in the body; it is Satan's Masterpiece, who taught the
Maxim, Divide, and impera: how easily shall we be overcome, if we be divided
among our selves? Concord is the nurse of plenty, the wealth of the poor, and
security of the rich, the strength of Kings, and blessing of the people: When
the dry bones in Ezekiel. 37.1.2, 3.
Ezekiels Vision, lay scattered in the fields, there was no life, but when they
were united, then they received breath. Wars and dissensions may seem sweet
to the ignorant; but O happy peace! did men but know thy value, what would they
not give, what not suffer for thee? Thou buildest Cities, make wholesome
Laws, plantest Vineyards, sowest the fruitful Valleys, stockest the pleasant
Gileads with numberless herds; thou make millions into one, and therefore
one strong as millions; I beseech you therefore, mark them who cause
Divisions, and Offenses.

congregation of Corah, Dathan, and Abiram, within it. All division is not
dangerous; if the Chafe be gone, the Wheat is the cleaner, but evil and
mischeivous is that division, and those offenses which are (in show) near, but
(in deed) contrary to true doctrine. When the points stand like Deuteronomy. 27.12.13.

of the Serpents of the color of the ground. When Paul had spoken, Acts 20.30.
of grievous wolves not sparing the flock, he adds a more dangerous
affliction; that of themselves men should arise speaking perverse things to
draw disciples after them. As Samson said to his brethren of Judah, Swear unto
me that ye will not fall upon me your selves, Judge. 15, 12. I may say to
those who profess the same Religion with us; I would I were secure of our
friends, I fear not our professed enemies: there seems no such present
danger, as that we may be wounded propriis spinis. Therefore mark them which
cause divisions seeming near, but contrary to the doctrine of God. Esaias 8.20.
This is our Cynosure, our Eastern star to lead us to Christ, the touchstone
of truth, our sheat-anchor holding us from being carried about of every wind of
doctrine; in every distraction we must have an eye to this, as the wounded
Israelites had to the brazen Serpent; and then let the adversary shake their
venomous tongues at us; it is no schism to divide from error, but from truth;
we have divided from their corruptions, according to, not contrary to the
doctrine here mentioned; to which we willingly appeal.

The doctrine of the Old and New Testament is the rule of Faith and manners; 9.

vain word concerning you, but it is your life; and by this word you shall
prolong your days in the land; the salvation of the people is the supreme

repair begins at the house of God, where this is neglected there is no due

obsequy to Princes, no holy duty between Children and Parents, no sanctimony
and equity between man and man; all which, and whatsoever else is good for the
societies of men, this doctrine commands in every branch, where
state-interests, humane policy, or secular cares come like those 1 Samuel 2.16.

sum of all equity divine and humane; this prohibits every offense against
God, or Caesar. It will appear if we consider,

1. That God gave not only moral Laws, but judicial Statutes unto Israel;
and (though he now calls us not, by a Trumpet from the cloud to Mount Sinai) he
does Lex est velut emissa divinitus vox. Sense.
the same for us by good Lawmakers.

2. If we consider the excellency of Law, it is nothing else but the dictate of
reason, connaturall to man; an innate rule of equity, enlarged to common
necessities by prudent sanctions, Pausanias said, Legum in viros non virorum in
leges debet esse authoritas Plut. Lacon. Apoth.
which we all obey.

a body without a soul; never any State subsisted without it; never any but
flourished in the due execution of it: the Grecian, and Roman Monarchies are
instances; it was not so much their sword which made them such great masters of
the World, as Justice which united them at home, without which, they must needs
have become prey to other Nations: it is execution of Justice which makes fast
the bars of the Gates within, and renders a Nation renowned, and dreaded
abroad; Justice fills the veins of sovereign treasuries, whets the sword,
bends the bow, and armeth the soldier with proof, and confidence of the
vigilant prudence of the State; whereas if ill counsel, and neglect of justice
at home, send up the cries of the oppressed (like that Josh. 8.23.
smoke of Ai) their hearts fall dead. Justice is a convoy to the solitary
traveller, an Hospital to the poor, a centinell to the sleeping, a lock to
the treasury, a fence about the fields and vineyards, a garrison to the City, a
wall to our houses; in fine, whatsoever we have, or are in things secular,
under God we owe to Law and Justice, the nerves of War, and strength of
Peace; Hec scel^a nisi aberunt contuplex murus rebus servandis parv'st. Plant.

without which, no armies can defend us, no fortifications secure us.

4. If we consider the things which differ from this Doctrine, it is not Lege
haud quaquam viderinu^cupatione, sacrove dignas tit^lo, quinimo decreta dici
verius edictave, ac institutaisiquidem lex bona est aeterna item -- a summo est
bono ac rursum in idem refluit coel. Rhodig. Antiq. lect. l. 18. cap. 19.
Law which is not consonant hereto; as Cum iniquae cognoscuntur, merit o
damna^tur -- Tertul^adv Gent. c. 4.
Platos statutes for community, Solons for Harlots: me thinks when I read of
such impiety, under the sacred name of Law, I see the Endor Devil in an holy
Prophets mantle. -- Neque religio ulla sine sapientia suscipienda. Lact. l. 1.
ib. l. 4. c. 2. l. 4. c. 3. and. ib. c. 4.
Miserable are those states where Religion and Law are divided: There Jeroboams
policy, Pharaohs working wisely, and Pharisees projection to prevent the
Romans supplanting them, must prove but Achitophels infatuated counsels.

5. Lastly if we consider, that this doctrine is the -- sciatis ipsas quoque
leges vestras, quae videntur ad^nnocentiam pergere de divina lege vt antiquior
is sormae mutuatas -- Tertull. Apol. c. 45.
Ocean of Justice to every humane Law which it feeds and maintains, and that
if you follow any stream thereof, it will lead you to the Word of God; for as
wisdom and truth is all of one God, whosoever deriveth it to us; so is
Justice his, who not only has it (as the creature may) but is it, as no
creature can be. 2. Cron. 19.6.
Iehosaphat said truly to the Judges, Ye execute not the judgment of man, but
of the Lord, for vengeance is his. The Heathens had some sense of that the
Apostle says, There is no power but of God; and that all humane Justice
floveth from the Lex non est tantum donum DEI, sed ipse DEVS, qus donum dedit:
quia qui Paret legi, DEO paret. Arist. Pol. l 3. Aquin. 12. q. 91. a. 2. dicit
esse participa^^onem legis aeternae, increatur a rationali --
Divine: Therefore their Lawgivers pretended the derivations of their Statutes
from some supposed Deity: As Zoroaster from Oronasis, -- Lycurgus Lacedaemeniis
leges ex Apollinis autoritate se instituisse confinxerit, etc. August. de. Civ.
DEI. l. 2. c. 16. Strato. l. 10. eid. Arist. pol. l. 2. Coel. Antiq. lect. l.

Lycurgus from Apollo, Minos from Jupiter, Trismegistus from Mercury, Draco
and Solon from Minerva, Plato from Jupiter and Apollo.

1. It must touch all men's hearts with a reverend esteem of the Laws (
Legumidcirco omnes servi sumus, vt liberi esse possimus. Coel. Rhod. qo s.
which we serve that we may be free) and the ministers thereof, not only for
fear, but also for conscience sake; their contempt is the distemper and ruin
of the State.

2. It must say to the reverend Judges (as Iehosaphat once did, 2 Chronicles. 19.6.)
Take heed to your selves, for the Lord will be with you in the cause and in the
judgment.

3. It must say to all that hear this Doctrine, lay it up in obedient hearts;
it is as the dew distilling from Heaven, Deuteronomy. 32.1. let it not be entertained
as the sweet showers falling into the Sea, turning all to bitterness, as it
must do to them whom it cannot convert: Be not like the Fauces maris Caspii
vacuantur imbribus, crescunt estibus. Solim.
Caspian Sea, emptied with rain, and filled with heat, as some who learn,
that they may with false zeal seem to rail, and cast dirt into our mothers
face; this is contrary to peace, and the Doctrine which we have learned.

Our own example aggravates the crime of division and offenses, Which we have
learned.
we have learned that from the supreme Lawgiver; we own obedience on pain of
eternal death. Miserable is that State where every man makes his own Religion
and Law; a Tyranny is better then an Anarchie, where every thing is lawful,
there is nothing law full; therefore I conclude, that All miseries and
disorders flow into Church and State through these breaches of inconstancy to
the wholesome Doctrine and good Laws received: Mutations in Policy or Nobis
vero nibil ex nostro axbitrio inducere licet, sed nec eligere quoth. aliquis de
arbitrio suo induxerit. Apostolos Domini habemus auctores, qui nec ipsi
quicquam ex suo arbitrio quod inducerent eligerunt sed acceptam a Christ's
discipli^^m fideliter nation bus ad signavevunt Tertul. advershaer. c. 6.
Religion are dangerous; recruding of wounds will gangren the sound parts. I
will shut up all with an address.

1. To you, honored Lords: (...). Synoss. Ep. 31.
souls of Cities, who give Laws life, by executing them; wherein can I more
opportunely implore your help, then in the present danger? Of all offenders,
I beseech you mark them who cause divisions; that the wrath of God may be
diverted from this land: this Kingdom never suffered so much as in Divisions,
and intestine quarrels: none but for offenses suffer. I need not say, it is
easier to extinguish sparks, then enraged flames; nor that we are come to our
Massa and Merita, and that if the leake of separation which has begun to fill
us with the waters of strife, be a little longer neglected, we are in danger of
foundering: I beseech you therefore heal the fountains by the salt of
Justice, and cast in the branch into the Marahs which now embitter us; you best
know how to let in floods of severity, as Solim.
Caius Marius did the Sea, whereby, Perniciosam ferventis Rodani navigationem
temperavit; these variable languages, wherein we cannot understand each other,
or for impatience will not; this strife of tongues following the crying sins
of this land, do not so much portend some ensuing, as point out a present
confusion.

2. To you, faithful Jurours, this day to make inquest; my text says, as Jud.
4.22.
Joel. Come and I will show you the men ye seek. Mark them who cause
Divisions.

3. To my brethren of the Ministry, I need not say, Mark them (you know them to
your grief) I say, If ye be Prophets of the Lord, entreat the Lord of Hosts,
that the rest of the vessels, Jer. 27.18.
which are left in the House of the Lord, go not to Babel.

4. To the jeering Chams (whose pastime is their Parents opprobrie) pretending
separation from sinners, but indeed with greater sins, because with much
greater pride and hypocrisy: I would say, if they would hear, Christ taught
none of his to separate from the well known Ipse trad tor Christi de Apostolis
fuit. Te^rtul. de preser. c, 3. fine.
Judas; Who taught you Division? if affection have left any place for reason,
consider the advantage you give the common enemy; division weakneth us, and
strengthens them, Hoc Ithacus velit, and magno mercentur Atridae. They can
never overcome us unanimous, let them not single us out, to our own
destructions.

5. To all that hear me, I beseech you brethren avoid them; whether
Innovators, or Separatists, the two smoking firebrands, the Scylla and
Charibdis, the gulfes and Chasmas of our Church and State. (of whom I think as
Cicero, of the factious Caesar and Pompey, Quem fugiam scio, quem sequar
nescio) avoyde both extremes: hold fast the wholesome Doctrine, which ye have
learned; and the God of peace and unity say, Amen, and stir up some sons of
peace to sound the retreat; that it may not be bitterness in the end: and let
the contending parties say, Amen; and and patiently hear each other, as men
who strived for truth rather then for victory; (...), etc. G. Nazianz. orat 14.
bearing (as much as the cause will permit) with the in firm: understanding
our common interest, that we may again see the face of the Primitive Church,
wherein all were of one mind, and one soul; and let all that love the peace of
God, unity of the Church, and prosperity of the State, say Amen: and the good
God make my blessing stronger then the blessing of my elders, that peace and
truth may be in our days, that we may appear with comfort, before the
tribunal of Jesus Christ; O Lord bow down thine ear and hear us, O Lord
consider and do it, etc.

AMEN.
