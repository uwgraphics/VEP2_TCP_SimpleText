TO THE Supreme Authority (UNDER GOD) OF THE COMMONWEALTH Of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, THE COMMONS in PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED.

The true and faithful Testimony of William Morris, a late Member of the Army
in IRELAND.

When the wicked rise, men hide themselves, but when they perish, the righteous
increase.

The fear of the Lord prolongeth days, but the years of the wicked shall be
shortened.

The memory of the just is blessed, but the name of the wicked shall rot

LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1659.

To the supreme authority (under God) of the Commonwealth of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, the Commons assemblies in Parliament.
THe Lord Almighty, whose Name is Holy, whose power no creature is able to
resist, has heard the cry of the afflicted, and the cruelly oppressed
Innocent, for his names sake he has beheld, and has not ceased turning and
overturning persons and powers, until he has once more returned the desperate
forlorn and sinking concernments of all the Godly in the Nations, into your
bosoms, their tossed, tumbled, torn and tottering intrest is once more imported
into your harbor.

And indeed the revival of your prestine Authority begins to appear like the
resurrection of the just, before whom all the contrary is and must be judged
and condemned; and this is seen and felt even by outward observation already in
Ireland; O how do the scandalous and persecuting Magistrates, the greedy
hirelings, and blind-guides, the profane and bloodthirsty people, even all the
cursed briars, thorns, and brambles of all sorts, which of late have sprung up
and flourished under the shadow of Henry Cromwell these four years bypast in
this Nation now begin to droop, to hang the head and wither, as if their end
(which is to be burnt) were near at hand.

And now that the Lord has once more put a price into your hands, and given
you another precious oppertunity, whereby you may be more serviceable then ever
to the interest of his beloved Son, who is come forth a light into the World,
and after a long and dark night of Apostacy has arisen and is arising and
coming in thousands of his saints (as it is written of him) who are gathered,
gathering and to be gathered in this the day of his glorious appearance out of
the Egyptian bondage of the mercenary hirelings, and soul-starving pastors,
out of all opinions, forms, and practices, professing or profane, into the
glorious liberty of the Sons of God, and into the unity of the eternal spirit,
that therein they might have fellowship with the Father, and the Son.

Beware that you turn not the edge of your authority against his Royal seed,
who says, touch not mine anointed, and do my Prophets no harm, yea, those
that touch them, touch the apple of his own eye; and Kings has he rebuked for
their sakes, and brought down the mighty before them, And as in former ages and
Generations, so in this present has his mighty arm been stretched out, whereby
he has wrought deliverance for his chosen and redeemed his heritage, and the
loftiness of man has he bowed down, who took pleasure in unrighteousness in
transgressing and lying against the Lord, and departing from the way of God;
fasting for strife and debate, and that they might smite with the fist of
wickedness, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of deceit and
falsehood, yet covering all over with pretense of reformation and settlement,
until judgment was turned away backward, justice stood afar off, truth was
fallen in the streets, and equity could not enter, for the wicked were set in
high places, the proud were called happy, the greedy hirelings and soul
devouring blind guides, the plundering parish Priests exalted against the Lord
and against his truth, and upheld in their false Doctrines and cruel
oppressions b a Law.

And he that reproved in the gate was hated, and he that spoke uprightly was
abhorred, and he that departed from inequity was made a prey, and many of the
faithful in the Nations for their Testimony against the crying atominations of
the times, and for tender conscience sake toward God, were thrust into
prisons, holes, and corners, and otherwise persecuted, and cruelly entreated
(and this was the true state of the-case) until the oppression of the innocent,
and the cry of iniquity was exceeding great, and the Lord harkened and heard
it, and looking down from the habitation of his holiness and his glory, he saw
it, and it greatly displeased him; and his zeal, and his strength, and the
sounding of his bowels, and his mercies toward them were not restrained; and
after long waiting, and often warning (and things growing worse and worse) at
last his wrath break forth and there was no remedy, and his purpose he
established, and his decree was sealed; that although that Ruler had been as
the Signet upon his right hand, yet would he pluck him off, and rend the
government from him and from his house (as formerly he did the government of his
people from Saul when he departed from him) and so by his own right Arm made
way for you by overturning him, that neither Argument nor Arts nor Arms could
overcome.

And now seeing it is not by your might, nor by your power, but by the
wonder-working hand of God alone you are restored; Be you warned from the Lord
God Almighty, that you take heed of drinking in the murderous, Cain-like spirit
of the greedy and mercenary hirelings, who teach for hire and Divine for sums
of money, tithes and other customs (established by the Pope) whose God is their
belly, whose glory is their shame, who mind earthly things, whose sacrifice the
Lord abhors, and it is an abomination to him.

I say take heed of drinking in that spirit, for it is the wine of fornication
which they will be presenting to you in a golden cup of glorious and shining
pretenses to external holiness, formality, and lip Religion; but it is the cup
of the Whores ebomination, wherewith the Princes and Rulers of the earth, earth
have been made drunk in all ages to this very day, by that persecuting
generation, who have made themselves even drunk with the blood, and rich spoil
of Saints.

And as ever you expect the presence of the Lord with you, or his blessing upon
your Government, beware that ye neither do nor cause nor consent to any act of
cruelty against any sort of people in the Nations who have hungering and
breathing desires after the clearest and most manifest enjoyments of Jesus
Christ, and who are come to see the deceit of the hirelings and blind guides,
and for tender conscience sake cannot pay toward their maintenance; And
especially the Lords most tenderly affected and beloved friends, the seed of
faithful Abraham according to the spirit, who greatly fear and tremble at his
powerful word, and are by the scorners of this generation called Quakers; but
know you this assuredly, that amongst those people, your greatest and most
powerful interest truly stands, and upon your well or evil dealing with them,
your welfare, or your ruin does undoubtedly depend: for the Tabernacle of the
Lord of hosts is with them, the Kingdom of his Son is exalted in them, his
power and glory is manifested to them, the shout of a mighty King is among
them, and all their enemies shall fall before them.

Wherefore beware you undertake not to defend the hirelings in their opinions
imaginations, or practices, touching the worship of God, by your authority,
from the examinations, and trials of others who are or may be moved of the Lord
to try their spirits and Doctrins, for the true worshipers of the true God did
never appeal to any Humane Authority to defend them in their worship from the
words of gainsayers, nor never will; but were always ready by sound Doctrines
(not by prisons, stocking and whipping) to exhort, convince and silence such as
did oppose themselves.

And herein the late Tyranical and conscience-oppressing Rulers have much
exceeded the cruelty of the Jews; for although the Ministers of Christ (whose
manner it was to go into the Synagogues on the Sabbath days, and reason from
the Scriptures, persuading the things concerning the Kingdom of God (as his
Ministers do in these days) were sometimes haled out and beaten, and brought
before Rulers, who in their wills put them in prison, sometimes a day or two or
three, and then let them depart; yet we never read that chief Authority or
Rulers either of the Jews or Romans did ever so much aggravate their sin or
harden themselves against the Lord and against his truth, as to make a Law to
defend their teachers from the words of Christ's Disciples, either within or
without the Synagogues; but this Apostatizing and unbelieving generation have
by a cruelly executed Law, upon pain of long imprisonment, fines and grievous
punishments of the body, attempted to defend their public hirelings and soul
devouring teachers, from the words of Christ's Ministers, who are sent of him to
try their spirits and manifest their deceit; and that neither in their public
places, nor in their going or returning to nor from them, the hireling must be
spoken to.

O high presumption against the Lord! as if they intended to to limit and
circumscribe the spirit and power of the holy One within the bounds of their
Arbitrary dictates! as if their Laws could prevent the wind from blowing, or
their commands with hold the day from breaking, or their decrees obscure the
Son from shining, or their power withstand the flowing of the Ocean, and not be
overwhelmed in the vain attempt.

Beware also that you compel not any by your Laws to pay their tithes or
other considerations toward the maintenance of the common hirelings, who do
deny them and their Doctrines; but if any sort of people in the Nations will
voluntarily make choice such to be their leaders, it is but just, upon grounds
of common equity, that, those who follow blind guides at their own peril,
should also maintain them at their own charges.

And so break ye the bonds of the late oppressing taskmasters; and set at
liberty those who for several years, bypast have suffered cruel bondage
besides the spoiling of their goods: and have not loved their lives unto the
death, but given up all for conscience sake rather then betray their testimony,
and deny the second Priesthood, Christ Jesus the everlasting High Priest, (who
was not made by the Law of a carnal commandment, but by the power of an endless
life:) by whose coming the first Priesthood that took Tithes was changed, and
the Law that gave Tithe (as well as that which required sacrifice of
burnt-offerings) abolished as Heb. 7. nor can they give any part of the
creatures whereof the Lord has made them Stewards, toward the maintaining and
upholding such a Minister, which Christ has never sent.

And think it not sufficient that the Saints have liberty to descent from and
deny the false and will worship of the common hirelings, and yet must be
compelled by Law to give them maintennance, or suffer spoiling; for it were as
high iniquity in the sight of God, to cause the Saints to suffer because they
cannot give their goods as sacrifice to the Idol, as to cause them suffer
because they cannot bow and worship: and it were no loss cruelty to bind them
to the one, then to the other.

And therefore as ever you would be found Innocent before the Lord, and have
the work of God to prosper in your hands, or you be prosperous in your
undertakings, forbear imposing tithes upon any people in the Nations against
their consciences or any other Taxes upon his faithful ones toward the
maintenance of the hired teachers?

For this I have received of the Lord, and it is my faithful Testimony to you
in the eternal word of truth that shall stand for ever, 1. That no true
Ministers of the true Christ did ever yet take tithes for Preaching, nor never
will. 2. That no true Ministers of the true Christ did ever yet demand or crave
a settled maintenance from the chief Authority of any Nation for Preaching, nor
never will. 3. That no true Ministers of the true Christ did over yet accept of
(muchless compel) a settled maintenance for Preaching, from such as did deny
them and their Doctrine, nor never will. 4. That no true Ministers of the true
Christ did ever yet petition the authority of any Nation to be defended in
their doctrines or practices concerning the worship of God by a Humane Law from
the gain sayings of others, nor never will. 5. That no true Ministers of the
true Christ did ever cause men or women to be persecuted, imprisoned, stocked
and shamefully entreated, for speaking to them in their meetings, or asking
them questions, nor never will.


And therefore if any sort of people whatsoever they are called, (whether
Presbyterians, Independants, Baptists, or Quakers) do come unto you and tell
you they are Ministers of Christ, and demand of you a settled maintenance for
Gospel Preaching; I do affirm from the Lord, they are to be denied as false
witnesses, and no true Ministers of the true Christ.

For those who are truly sent of him, they neither come to the powers of the
earth for maintenance nor a probation; but do approve themselves to that of God
in every conscience, and the Gospel does maintain them.

They covet no man's gold nor silver nor raiment, but freely as they have
received of the Lord they freely give, and unto such Christ faith, He that
receives you receives me, and he that dispiseth you, dispiseth me, and he
that despises me, dispiseth him that sent me; And when they come to a City or
a Town, enquire who is worthy and there abide and eat such things as are set
before them, for the workman is worthy of his meat; and if any do deny them
and their doctrine, shake off their feet as a witness against them; Christ
further tells them, he sends them forth as Lambs amongst wolves; and that they
shall be brought before Rulers, and persecuted from City to City, and delivered
into prisons, and betrayed by brethren and kinsfolk, and friends, and hated of
all men for his names sakes and these are true Characters of such as are true
Ministers of the true Christ.

But such as run and were never sent of him, go forth like Wolves among Lambs,
tearing, spolling, and devouring such as do not readily put into their mouths;
and such were the false Prophets of old, against whom the true Prophets bore
their Testimony, such were they that conspired in the midst of Israel, like a
Roaring Lion ravening the prey and devouring souls, Ezekiel. 25, 26
taking the treasure and the precious things, and profaning the holy things of
the Lord, putting no difference between the holy and profane nor between the
unclean and the clean; such were they that eat the fat, and clothed themselves
with the wool, and killed them that were fed, but fed not the flock; Such were
they that did teach for hire and divine for money: Such were they that the Lord
by his prophets calls Greedy dogs, that can never have enough, Micha 11. Isa.
56.
which all look to their own ways, every one for his gain, from his quarter.

And does not the Nations abound with such at this day, which run and are not
sent of Christ? O what Legions of these devouring Locusts have spread
themselves upon the earth! and what swarms of them has the East winds brought
into this poor wasted country of Ireland? as if all the Cages of unclean and
hateful birds in the Nations had been set open, or Lucifer with his Regiments
of unclean spirits intended to set up his kingdom in the midst of us. And
these having obtained approbation and commission from the powers of the earth,
and Tithes established by a humane Law, and treble damage the penalty of such
as do (for conscience sake or otherwise) refuse to pay; Then forth they go like
evening wolves, (the greediest of all dogs, ravening after their prey; And
then their first inquiry is, not where is the best people but) where is the best
benefice? Where Is the parrish that will yield most profie? Where Is the quarter
that will yield most gain? etc. And when he has found out the best he can, then
that shall satisfy, because he can get no better; and when he comes to the
place, his next inquiry is (not as the Ministers of Christ, (who is worthy, or
who is godly, but rather) who is wicked who is the most malicious spiteful man
amongst his neighbors, or the most cunning knave in all the parish, that he
may make him his Proctor (for no honest man will meddle with such an
employment) and such an one must be employed to make a strict enquiry into men's
estates, what quantity of corn they have, what wheat, Barley, Oats, Pease,
Beans they have, what Parsneps, Carrets Onyons, Leeks, Pottatoes, they have,
what cowes, Calves and Sheep, and Lambs, and how many Piggs, and Ducks, and
Geese, and Henns, they have, least a tithe Chickin should escape his greedy
Chops. Are these ministers of Christ? And if any of the servants of Christ
happen to be within his quarter, who for conscience sake cannot put into his
ravenous mouth, then there is a prize for him; and if they have considerable
outward estates, (that's the fish he angles for) they are the people he looks
for; Then never was cursed Cavileer more eager to plunder a Roundheads house
in time of war, then this greedy hireling is to plunder these Quakers (as he
calls them) And then another or two he must procure to go and view their
substance and value it at the highest rate; and next teaches them to break
Christ's command, and to swear for him; and thus having sufficiently instructed
them in wickedness, and made them sevenfold more the children of Hell then they
were before, to the evil Magistrates they go, and there after swearing and for
swearing he gets a judgment for treble damage, and so having got a commission
to plunder, he then makes havoc; and what ever he finds of outward substance
alive or dead that's movable, he sweeps away, not leaving either food to eat or
clothes to cover either old or young, and then casts into prison the bodies of
such as they had thus spoiled, and there cause them to be kept until they
finished their testimonies with their lives.

O! How many examples of this kind of lingering Martyrdom has there been in
several places; as may appear in the records of furterings for tithes in
England?

And these and such like are the true characters of the fals^ Prophets and
Ministers of Antichrist, and such is the ministry of these Nations at this
day, who murder and martyr for their greedy bellies.

And thus the land is defiled with blood, yea the blood of the Innocent cries
to the Lord for vengeance, against unrighteous Laws, unjust and cruel Judges,
and above all against the bloodsucking hirelings, and their upholders, against
whom the controversy of the Lord is exceeding great, and when the measure of
their iniquity is filled, and the sufferings of his saints accomplished then
shall the vials of his wrath, and the wine of his indignation be poured out
without mixture, and they shall surely drink it, who have drunk up the blood of
the innocent, and have had no pity.

And forasmuch as some of you have tasted of affliction under the late
oppressing government, (and with other Noble and public spirited persons in
the Nation) have been made the footstool whereby ambition and usurpation might
enthrone it selse; and arbytrary will and power kept you under bonds, while the
plowers made long furrows upon your backs, because of the testimony you bore
against the growing iniquities of those evil times; and now that the Lord has
given you liberty, and put the power of doing good into your hands; Remember ye
the afflictions of every Joseph, and as feeling members of the miseries of
others (who for the exercise of a good conscience toward God) have been left
forelorne and fatherless in the Nations, forsaken of the Magistrates
generally; all acts of Justice mercy and pity being denied to many of them from
men of all estates, even from him that Swaied the Scepter to him that held the
plough, and they given up and exposed as a prey to the lust and spoil of any
that would oppress them) let your bowels be enlarged, relieve ye the
oppressed, help the helpless, Judge the cause of the fatherless, for herein
you judge not for man, but for the Lord, who has reserved you to stand in the
gap in such a day as this is, and not to make it wider. And amongst the flock
(whereof Christ Jesus is the true: sheepherd) of which you are to have regard in
England, let not the tender Lambs, who (in regard of outward habitation) are
scattered here and there in this Nation, be forgotten by you; but speedily
extend the power God has put into your hands, to save them out of the mouths
of the devouring Wolves, the insatiable hirelings, who are gaping ready to
swallow up the heritage of the Lord; And those who have been faithful to the
interest of the Nations, and with their lives and all that was dear unto them,
waded through hazards and hardships in times of difficulty, and danger for the
promoting the good old cause, the advancement of Justice, Righteousness and
truth in the earth; have lately been insulted and Tyrannized over by the greedy
hirelings, who wait to make a prey upon us; And because for conscience sake we
cannot pay them Tithes, the hireling, in whose quarter any of us falls to be,
seems to rejoice that he has such a prize in hand, and glories in the Law
that gives him Treble damage, that by color thereof he might (according to the
example of his brethren in England) Sweep away all in a day, and enrich
himself with the spoil of the Innocent, O how he longes for harvest, and
boasts what he will do if Tithes be (...) denied him; (...) was the case of
several of the servants of the Lord (who had been faithful to their country and
generation many years) when your authority revised, even ready to be devoured,
our goods spoiled, our wives made widows, and our children fatherless by
long imprisonments and lingering martyrdom (an cvil reward for our good
service) which several of our dear brethren in England have lately undergone,
who nevertheless have finished their course with joy, and through many
tribulations have passed into everlasting rest; Although their wives and many
innocent babes are left behind, surviving monuments of their opressors
cruelties.

And that it purely is for conscience sake toward God we pay not tithes, you
need no other evidence to convince you then the bloody characters wherein the
truth hereof has been so legibly written in these few years, by so many
servants of the living God in several prisons in England whose testimonies were
sealed with their lives; besides the sufferings of hundreds more, (both here
and there) who suffered joyfully the spoiling of their goods, knowing where
they have a better and more enduring substance.

Wherefore if that gracious spirit of zeal toward God, of righteousness and
Justice toward men, of love and meekness toward tender consciences, which
formerly was manifest among you be not departed from you, then let it now
appear and act for God, that truth and righteousness (the sum and substance of
all our hopes and expectations) may be established in the earth, and
oppression, tyranny and Injustice (the cause of all our sufferings) be removed;
that tender consciences may be relieved, the kingdom of Jesus Christ exalted;
and, then generations yet unborn shall call you blessed.

But if a contrary spirit act and guide you, and you let slip this precious
oppertunity, and suffer Sion still to languish in the dust, spreading out her
hands and there be none will help her, the Lord will send deliverance another
way, and innocent blood will be required of you, and your names be numbered
among those that the Lord has overthrown before you,

Written in Ireland the beginning of 5th Month 1659.
THE END.
