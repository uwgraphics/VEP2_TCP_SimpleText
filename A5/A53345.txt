Antitrisulca meam quam flamma cremarerat Arcem, Anteferenda Mihi Fabrica nulla
fuit.
On S.t PAVL's Cathedral represented by Mr DAN. KING.
Illustrious. Pile, o that my Muse,
Amphien-like, could Life infuse
Into Thy Stones and make them dance
In Order, till They might advance
Into their ancient Seats, and rise
In Spires to re-salute the Skies.
What though (...) 7 Wonders have
In their own Rubbish found a grave:
Consuming Time did scarce amiss
So long as He dispensed with This:
For whilst He PAUL'S upheld alone,
The Sc^^^^ re-flourisht in This One.
Hail, Sacred Ruins, which remain,
And still a Majesty retain
You in your mouldring Relics show
GOD's special presence once below:
So as blessed Angels might admire
The Model of Their own Great Quire.
Nor were it an Offense to call
Those Angels to thy hastening Fall,
We only can fit Poets be
To grace Thee with an Elegy
And to bewail a Silence there
Where Neices turned each Sense to Ear.
Religions Ark, a Trophy raised
By Zeal where God was rightly praised
Cheered by Thy former Splendour must
We now be blinded with Thy Dust?
Ah that Thy Lead should fall to be
AWinding sheet to Faith and Thee!
To view Thee once more in Repair,
O Theater of ROYAL Care!
To re-exalt Thy glorious Name.
And wash out our Augaan Shame.
A Flood should issue from our Eyes
Which might Alpheus equalize
Time that devours the World and brings
A Change on all inferior Things,
May see an Age in greater Have
Re-build Thee then this laid Thee wast,
And find a Holy Pleasure in
Such an Atonement for This Sin.
However let Us duly mourn
To view Thee wasting to Thy Urn.
And if Time should not Thee restore.
Thou liv'st in Figure as before.
By ONE Who joining Names thru Things.
Shares in Renown with other KINGS.
Threnodia Adis PAVLINA De Seipsa.
A SPICE Qualis eram primo perfecta Decore,
Vertice sublimi visa ferire Polum,
Culinine nec tantum Coelo, sed proxima Cultu,
Coelicolae nostros dum stupuere Choros:
Dives Opum, sancta Ara Precum, Pietatis Asylum,
Florida Pace, Fide pura, dicata DEO.
Concipe Mente meum Decus esset quale secundum
Contractum Senio cum positura Situm;
Pyramid a Flammis cum surgeret icta Trisulcis,
Auxiliatrices REGE ferente Manus:
Propitio Sumptu renovata ut Matre, minorum
Natarum Series tota. Venusta foret.
Illa Ego Quae quondain sublimbus alta Columnis,
Arcnum adornatis concamerata Tholis,
In Coelum. Spira coepi tendisse stupenda,
Atque Minusterijs aptior esse sacris;
Inde, Vetustatis devitatura Ruinas,
Cum Mundo poteram continuasse Dies.
Maxima Christicolae mansissem Gloria Mundi,
Invida and in nostras Roma fuisser Opes;
Ipsa Cathedrali supefassem splendida Forma,
PETRE, tuamque Solo, MARCE, tuamque Salo;
Atque Reformatum tune Relligione Nitorem
Nacta, Me summus conclecorasset Honos.
Sed mihi Seditio nocuit, quae Prodroma Lapsus,
Saevior ac ipso Tempore, Livor atrox.
Cum sint Arma. Tibi tantum Coelestia, PAUL,
Militis Excubijs non eget Ista Domus:
Ante Decora fui, jam Squallida tota recumbo;
Est sacer Hinnitus quo Sacer Hymnus erat!
Si Fluvio Stabulum Iavit Tyrinthius Heroes,
Victor Aquis, quando Dextra negabat Opem;
Excordes Nati, cur nunc in Funere Matris
Conspicitis siccis Rudera nostra Genis?
O, si versa forent in salsum Lumina Rivum,
Elueret Sordes Rivus ut Iste meas!
Involvo Lodice mei Sacra omnia Plumbi!
Urna prius Magnis, jam rudis Urna Mihi!
Laetor at aeratis quod sim victura Figuris,
Ceu Volucris Syrijs quae reparata Rogis,
lllius Auxilio, Qui non REX Nomine tantum,
Sed Qui, par summis REGIBUS, edit Opus.
Quanto Ego Flebilior, tanto Praesentior audi,
Diruit, aedificat nam tua Dextra, DEUS!
TU miserere Mei, mea TU demortua Saxa,
Verus ut Amphion, mox animare potes:
Dicta Dies, Scriptis promissa sidelibus, adsit,
Cum Favor in charae Saxa SIONIS erit!

Mat.21. 13:
The City of London (as some write) had its first Rise from Brute the
Grandchild ot AEneas, 70 years after ye Destruction of Troy, whence (say they)
it was called Troynobant or New Troy so called when Caesar entered into
Britain. 54 years before ye Birth of Christ. The name London derived (as some
say) from Lud a British King, who enlarged it: Others from Liban-dian. or
Dianas Temple because ye chief Temple therein was dedicated to Diana on whose
Ruins St Paul's was built by Ethelbert of Kent: It was walled 3 miles in
compass Ao Chri. 306 by Helen the Mother of Constantine.

In the time of H. 3d. it had six fair Gates.

The Tower builded by VV. the Conqueror Ano 1078

At ye Dissolution of Monasteries it had 17. Religious houses within the
Walls, and 12 without.

The number of Churches in ye City of London wthin the Walls 99, in the
Suburbs 31. Anno 1658.

This City has Longitude 24 20. Lat 51 32
