OXON. July 5th. 1652.
THE Vice Chancellor and Heads of Houses, with the rest of the Deligates,
reflecting upon, and taking into Consideration the Disturbances, Disorderly
carryages, and Incivilities, of many younger Scholars of this University in
Public meetings, and especially, at the public Solemnities of the ACT, partly
by Hummings and other clamorous noyses, on purpose raised and made; and partly
by preoccupying, and intruding into the Seats and Places belonging to
Superiors and Strangers; Do hereby strictly require and forewarne, all
Scholars and Others to forbear the making any such Disturbance by the Hummings
and Clamours before mentioned. And all Under-Graduats and Juniors, not to
presume to take up the Places belonging to their Superiors or Strangers; And
in case any shall be taken notice of to offend in the kinds aforesaid (for
discovery of whom the Proctors with their Deputies, and all Masters of Arts are
hereby desired to be assisting) they shall be proceeded against and brought to
condign punishment, by Suspension Tit. 7. Sec. 2. 7. and Tit. 15. 1.
from their Degrees, or the Undergoing of such other Penalties, as the Statutes
of the University in these or the like cases provide to be inflicted.

DAN. GREENWOOD Vice-Can.
