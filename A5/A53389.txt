The Oracles for War: OR, Great Britain admonished to maintain our ancient
Rights by dint of Sword.
To a New Playhouse Tune.
^TO Arms, to Arms, to Arms, to Arms;
^Your Ensigns now display:
^Now, now, now, now, now, now, now,
^Set the Battle in Array:
^The Oracle for War declares, for War declares;
^Success depends, Success depends
^upon your Hearts and Spears.
The Oracle for War declares, etc.

II.
Britains strike home,
Revenge, revenge your Country's Wrongs;
Fight, fight, and record,
Fight, fight, and record
your selves in Druids Songs;
Fight, fight, and record,
Fight, fight, and record
your selves in Druids Songs.
III.
Enraged, enraged, enraged, enraged,
your Showers of Ball let fly;
Come, come, come, come, come, come, come,
let us win the day, or dye:
The Honor of the Field we have, the Field we have,
With loud Huzza's, with loud Huzza's,
Press on you bold and brave,
the Honor of the Field.
IV.
Britains maintain your Rights, your Rights,
by conquering Blows;
Down, down with the Pride,
Down, down with the Pride
of your late vanquished Foes;
Down, down with the Pride,
Down, down with the Pride
of your late vanquished Foes.
V.
Let Us rouse, let us rouse, lets rouse, lets rouse
the British Lion bold;
See how, how, how, how, how, how,
his Heroic Eyes are rolled;
While Silver Trumpets founds a Charge, Charge front and rear,
Break through their Ranks, break through their Ranks;
And make 'em fly for fear,
whilst Silver Trumpets sounds.
VI.
Let them be drove
Before, before your Conquering Arms,
And cause them to dread,
And cause them to dread
Great Britain's loud Alarms,
And cause them to dread,
And cause them to dread,
Great Britain's loud ALARMS.
FINIS.
