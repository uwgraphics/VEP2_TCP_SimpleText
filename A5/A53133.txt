To the Tune of, Come from the Temple to the Bed, etc.


Not many years ago
There fell a mighty Snow,
And Houses were built of the same,
In Cabbins so Cold
Hot Liquors were Sold,
Where for Novelty sake many came,
But Eighty three may Boast,
There na'r was such a Frost,
In the Memory of any man alive,
Thousands on the River throng,
And many safely march along,
From Kingston upon Thames, to Queen-Hive.
The VVatermen who ply,
And were used to cry,
Next Sculler, next Oars, or next Boat,
Have Built Houses where,
They did pass with their Fare,
And also have changed their Note,
Joe will you drink a Dram,
Kind Sir or you Madam,
Walk in, here is good Room and good Fire,
Also Brandy, Ale, or Wine
Or be pleased to Sup and Din
Here is all you can wish or desire,
Come Let Us repair,
To the Thames there is a Fair,
No one li(...) e(...) knew the like before,
On the Ice is a Town
Which till now was never known,
Built in streets quite from shore unto shore;
Our VVherrys, Sculls and Oars,
Must Lie on the Shores,
While in Tents on the Ice we remain,
Selling Brandy and Ale,
It Is no matter for a Gale,
Till the Thames clear of Ice be again.
The Seaman outward bound,
Lays his Ship on the Ground,
Or within some good Harbor or Dock,
And there it must remain,
'Till the Ice is gone again,
It Is as good as a Key and a Lock,
No work can be done,
Lets a shoye every one,
No Occasion for the Coxwain an's crew,
Then above bridge let us go,
And drink a dram or two,
With our mess-Mates the Red coats and blew.
While some go a Broad,
Both in Field and in Road,
With their Guns silly Birds to destroy,
And others here and there,
Do track the harmless Hare,
And the Coneys do cousen and decoy,
Let us to the Thames,
On whose frozen streams,
Strange inventions for pastime is made,
There is Baked, Boyld, and Roast,
what e're we fancy most,
Ready dressed piping hot to be had.
Here is Tom the Carman,
And with him a Spareman;
Having set up his Cart and his Horses,
His Wheels he has broke,
Both Axle-Tree and spoke,
Better play then to work with such losses;;
The Channels are so froze,
That he cannot draw over
Without the Main strength of a Teem,
Then away Let Us be gone,
Set up Bayard, Buck and Roan,
And to Slydeing let us go on the Stream.
Where shall we go?
To the Booth here below,
Or the Sign of the Flying-chamber-pot,
I do not greatly care,
Why then let us walk in here,
I intend for to spend an Old Groat,
My Grandam used to say,
Against a Rainy day,
Lay by such a Sum in a Post,
But for all her Gray Head,
I do find as much need,
Ts provide one against a hard Frost.
See here comes Nan,
That sold Fish at the Swan,
And Nell that sold Herbs at the Crown,
No Oysters nor Sprats
But at Excessive Rates,
Which no Vessels, but Carts Bring to Town;
Then since neither Nan nor Nell
Can have VVare for to Sell,
Let us take them with us on the Ice,
And we I be as Merry there,
As at Bartholmew-Fair,
I am sure never a one them is Nice.
Here Is Ninepins Let Us play,
To pass the Time away,
I Will hold you a Rubbers or two,
It Is done let it be,
Go First I am three,
Or no more but a Tip and a go:
I that is the best sport,
Our Time being short,
Then bring for the Rubbers the other Pot,
I am most, you have lost,
Take your money mine Host,
You are welcome all is paid, is it not.
To finish my Song,
I do wish them no wrong,
Yet I wish that the Ice were away,
Though some do supply,
Their Families thereby,
Yet others it brings to decay,
I was glad when I saw,
The VVeather like to thaw,
'Twill be hard for the poor should it hold,
And when the Season's warm,
Who wishes for a Storm,
Or desires to be Frozen wi^^Cold.
