Christ. IN SCOTLAND; Who are admidst the scorching flames of the fiery Trial.

I. JOH. III:13. Marvel not, my Brethren, if the World hate you. I. PET. IV:12,

For the now truly honorable, and really happy, that little Flock, and lovely
Company in Scotland, who are in great tribulation, for the Word of God, and for
the Testimony of Jesus Christ; and more particularly, for his specially
endeared Friends, the Sufferers in the West. OF SCOTLAND.
MUch honored, dearly beloved and longed for in our Lord Jesus Christ,
Grace from the God of all grace, mercy from the Father of mercies, who is rich
in mercy, and peace from the God of peace, whose it is to speak that peace and
to give that peace, which passes all understanding, together with joy in the
Holy Ghost, be multiplied upon you. Though I am unable to do any thing for you,
or say any thing to you, which can cannot to the equivalency of a releife, now
when you are overwhelmed with such an inundation and deludge of calamities; as
every one who looks on, yea the very Authors and Instruments of these miseries
and mischeifes must say, if they speak their soul or sense, you are pressed
out of measure and beyond strength; yet your sufferings are such for kind and
quality, such for measure and weight, such for substance and circumstances, as
might, through a transport of grief and compassion, make the tongue of the
dumb, if he have b^t eyes or ears, to break prison and cry out, behold, O
Lord, and consider, to whom these things are done, and for what, and for whose
sake. I dare not, Alas! say, that I fill up the just measure of that sorrow for
you, and that sympathy with you, which is debt upon my part, and an
indispensible duty, in this day of trouble and of treading down, and of great
perplexity, by the Lord God of hosts, in the valley of vision; yet I desire to
be amongst the company of those, who do not, who dare not allow themselves, to
carry as inconcerned now, when his precious interests lie a bleeding, his poor
remnant under their pressures as breathing out their last, and such who
endeavor to retain their integrity, and to hold fall what they have that no
man take their crown, and to depart from that inquity, which is the inquity of
our time (a departing from God, and an opposition to Jesus Christ in nature and
degree, in height and heinousness, of a tincture and elevation, beyond and
above what the departings from God and oppositions to his Son Jesus Christ have
been or were capable of in former times) make themselves a prey; as is manifest
in your case not to be paralleled, if weighed in an even balance.

I am so much straightened, how to give my shallow and confused thoughts a vent,
while I essay to contribute my poor mite, for alleying the bitterness of your
cup, and mitigating the greatness of your grief (knowing well how little
proportion what ever I am able to say keeps to the anguish of your soul,
because of what you are put to suffer) as the sight of this indignation,
wherewith you are filled, puts me to struggle with my inclination, and staggers
me in my resolution to speak, as seeming rather to persuade me, because of the
heavienesse of his hand upon you, to sit alone and keep silence, then to open
my mouth, since the moving of my lips cannot assuage your grief; yet affection
(which easily procures a pardon, when it misseth the mark it aimed to hit)
has in the present clamant emergent emboldened me, out of my poverty and
penury, to offer such as I have; and besides, I hope, both from the conviction
of duty and knowledge, how much the depth of your distress is beyond the
supplies I can contribute for your ease, and the supportings of my feeble and
feeklesse pen, to acconnt it m mercy, while you are in that Paroxisme and agony
of misery, through the madness of such, as are incensed against your Lord and
Master, to cry as I can on your behalf, Arise o Lord, and rescue the soul of
thy turtle from the rage of these men of cruelty, and do not give up the
beloved of the soul into the hand of such an enemy, whose way thy soul hates.

You have often heard, my dear and distressed friends, and you have professed
also to be in the faith of this, That men may be more then conquerours, when
killed all the day long, and that there is an hundred fold to be reaped in this
life, even with persecution: Now set your selves, when killed and crushed, to
put the crown upon your Profession; now adorn that Doctrine of God the
Savior, which you Profess, by such a carriage, as will witness, you know, in
the midst of what flesh can do unto you, how to be conforted in God, and how to
endure the worlds hatred and harm, as those whom no affliction can make
miserable? O that he may put you in case to seal from your own experience the
sweetness of suffering for Christ; And to say, now we know there is a river
that refreshes the whole City of God, because he has made us drink of this
river of his pleasure, whereof since we drank, we have forgotten our Poverty,
and remember our Misery no more: now we can affirm from what we find,
(whereby our souls are fortified) that as the sufferings of Christ have
abounded in us, so our consolation also has abounded by Christ, for whom we
have suffered the loss of these things, and in that loss are so great gainers,
as now we know what we have lost is but dung; but what is left us, or rather
what we have found in these begun fruitions of Jesus Christ, has begun our
heaven amidst all we suffer. Yea, I am hopeful, it shall be with you in your
huntings, harassings, and hideings, as it was with Moses in the mount, never so
near God, as when at the remotest distance from all creature-converse and
comfort; And that even while you lie as among the pots, and are black with the
smoke of that fiery furnace, heated seven times beyond what you or your Fathers
have found, or could have feared, if Satan, whose element is fire, had not set
the Instruments of your calamity on fire of hell, and transported them so far
beyond the limits and latitude of all reason. As if the question were asked,
Why do these heathen rage? the answer behoved to be given, nay, ask them not
a reason, for they are in rage against the Lord, and against his anointod: I
say, while you are smothered with this smoke, and made black, yet your face
shall be made to shine, and you put in case to say, though we be black because
this sun with its scorching heat has looked upon us; yet are we comely,
because the sun of righteousness with healing under his wings has arisen upon
our soul, and under the shadow of his wings we shine and sing, and are
comforted.

But to come more closely to what I intend in these lines. Let me tell you,
dear Friends, that nothing can be more effectual for working up the heart to a
right temper at all times, and more particularly in your present case, and for
frameing a right the ways of a Christian, when he must either go with the
drove of those, who depart from the living God, or expose himself for his
adhesion to him, and relinguishing these workers of iniquity, yea opposing of
their Christ-opposing courses, to all the effects of their fury, than well to
know, and often to consider, what is the nature of that State and Condition,
whereunto he is called as a Christian; to know what is his relation to Jesus
Christ, who has chosen him; and to the world out of which he is chosen: this,
if seriously and sutably pondered, would certainly cool his feverish heats, and
quench his thirstings after the world, and would quicken his soul, and kindle
in his heart much heat and warmth of love to Jesus Christ; it would stablish
his heart, strenghten his hands, fortify against fear, and fournish him with
what is sufficient for the patient suffering of the worlds hatred and malice at
him; How would a solid reflection of his being chosen out of the world, sweetly
disengage him from the entanglements of this world; and as one made partaker of
the divine nature, make him so mind and so move, as his mindings and movings
would make it manifest whatsoever is below God is below the designings, the
desirings and endeavourings of his soul. And the true reason why there is so
little of real Christianity to be found amongst Christians, is, we consider not
that Christianity is the soul cast in that blessed mould of disconformity to
the world, and conformity to Christ, our having his blessed name called upon
us; as it supposes an association with him, so it obliges to an assimilation
to him, in order to the fruition of him, without which we can never make it
appear, that we are sharers of that unction, which is the import of that
blessed name called upon us. There are few, Alas! amongst the many Professors
of Religion, and pretenders to Christianity, who study to know the excellency
of that state, the special comforts and the proper duties thereof, and the
closeness of that connection which is amongst these. O! it must be an excellent
state, which imports union with Jesus Christ. He that is joined to the Lord is
one Spirit, says the holy Ghost. And what must the privileges and the comforts
be which follow upon and flow from this? For Religion, as it relates to these,
is the very religation of the soul to God, as a portion, and that good part
which cannot be taken from him; and then all the special duties thereof are but
the promoving of that begun conformity to Jesus Christ, till it be carried on,
and consummat in a perfect likeness to him. Now he, whose soul has received
just impressions of these things, is in case to carry amidst all surrounding
miseries, as one who is happy without the world, and in despite of the world;
for he has a happiness laid up in God, and to be laid out for him according
to his need, which the world knows not of, and cannot take from him: hence it
is, that he rejoices in hope, and is patient in tribulation: And as for the
duties of Religion he is not found of these as of an enemy, even when he is
sure he cannot follow them, but his enemies will find him and fall on him: he
knows no other question, but Lord what will thou have me to do? And when that
is clear, sets himself to do all things without disputings and murmur^ngs.
Neither is he demurred nor diverted, much less turned out of the way of
following the Lord fully, because there is a lion in it? but can without
fearing the wrath of a King, which is as the roaring of a lion, and most either
be encountered, or duty in its proper season deserted, go foreward; and when
the danger he exposes himself unto by doing so would be ready, if too much
pored upon, to daunt him and draw him, into a relinquishing of his Master, look
upward, and endure as seeing him who is invisible O noble look! this is that
blessed second sight, whereby a Saint, in the darkest night of distress, sees
that which is soul-supporting: O! the invisible God made visible to the poor
persecuted creature, in his omnipotent power, his infinite love, and his
unfailing faithfulness, makes all visible dangers evanish into an invisibility.

Therefore, dear Brethren, since you are not of the world, and since there is
so great a change made in your state, and some blessed begun chance made
betwixt you and the world in your manners, think it not strange concerning
these fiery trials, which you meet with from the world, and must go through,
till you get through the work: he has not rightly received Christ Jesus, who
looks not on suffering as his daily work: he who has closed with Christ, and
is resolved to keep him company to the end, that he may be with him without
end, must be at a point in this that be where he will bonds and afflictions
will abide him, in every place, yea he must resolve with it, and be in
readiness for it, not only to be bound, but also to die for the name of the
Lord Jesus; And that not amongst heathens, but in Jerusalem, where also his
Lord was crucified; not only at Rome and amongst professed enemis, but in
Scotland, but at Edinburgh, where Christ Jesus our Lord is now crucified again,
and put to open shame? not by a foreign enemy, but by those who are Rulers
(if it be not abuse of language to call them so, whose Government is pure
Tyranny) and not only by Rulers, but by such Rulers as have bound their souls
by the bond of a sacred and solemn Covenant, and stand eternally obliged,
under the penalty of everlasting seclusion from the presence of God and from
the glory of his power, to maintain that Reformation, the ruin whereof they
drive with so much rigor and rage, and the razing of the foundations whereof
they endeavor with the utmost of professed enmity; to preserve that precious
treasure for, and to propagat Religion in its purity to posterity; to protect
these very persons, whom they persecute, and persecute for persisting in those
ways, wherein they themselves have give it under their hand to God they would
walk. Now, we are not to think strange, concerning this fiery trial; for
whosoever would be the Disciple of Christ, must take up his cross daily and
follow him, it must be such an one as he pleases to lay on and what he will have
it to be; he must not fansy to himself a fools Paradise in Christ's company;
nay, the cross is the necessare concomitant of a Christian; and sharp
conflicti^g must go before the obtaining of the conquerours crown: we must not
only resolve to meet with such fiery trials, as will consume into ashes our
darling Idols, (for there is a necessity that some hand be made use of to pluck
out that right eye: and cut of that right hand' which has caused us to offend`
that so we may enter into life) but we must and may exspect to meet with ^he
saddest trouble, and the most unsufferably sharp trials out of that airth,
whence we did not fear, nor could we rationally foresee the storm should
blow: these Persons and things^ which should be most comfortable to the people
of God, do often prove the source of their calamity, and the Instruments
Whereby they are afflicted, We need not go to Ionah's gourd, nor Job's
Friends, we need go to Zechariah, slain betwixt the Porch and the Altar, by
Ioash, whom he was endeavoring to rescue out of the hands of the living God,
by admonishing him to keep the commandment of the Lord, and his Covenant and
Coronation Oath, 2. Chron. 23:16. compared with C. 24.20. and seq. for though
he was the Son of Iehojadah, who had made him King, and stain the Usurper;
yet he not only for got that kindness, bu^ slew the Son, who was
desiring, yea while endeavoring to keep that crown upon his head, (by
dissuading him to venture upon God-provoking courses or to enter the list of
opposition to God Almighty, contrary to all the Objective and Subjective
Obligations, under which he was to him, for having set him upon the Throne,
who could as easily and wonderfully bring him down, as he had set him up)
which his Father had set upon it. But God forgote neither his foresaking of
the Covenant, nor his breach of his Coronation Oath, nor his forgetting of
Iehojadah's kindness; but put Ioash in remembrance of all he had forgotten,
and of all he had done; and made him know he had heard the words of dying
Zechariah: I need neither tell you how, nor by what Monitors he brought these
things to his remembrance, nor how pla^n a parallel it is to our case: only
Ioash did not kill Iehojadah himse^f, who had been the Instrument of his
setlement in the Government. I say, we need not search to reco^ds of former
Generations, (except it be to find some of the Saints, and some of the
Churches of Christ, to whom we may turn. That we may learn at them? and be
beholding the end of the Lord, know how to carry and acquit ourselves, though
we may long turn over the records of former times, ere we find a parallel to
the iniquity of ours) for examples: when these very men, with whom we
ourselves did once take sweet council together, and with whom we walked to the
house of God in company, are become such cruel and keen enemies, as it is
impossible to describe their rage and cruelty; for a naked representation of
matter of fact would ^ertainly pass with such as were not witnesses to what is
done, for a meditat and malicious representation of Persons and Actions. but I
need not tell you stories what you find beyond my tellings, yea beyond your
own expressings. O the crimson iniquity of our times, when such as did but the
other day cry Grace Grace unto it, are this day throwing down what they had
built and are crying raze it, raze it even to the foundation: When these who
not long ago did cry up and commend loyalty to Jesus Christ, are now crying,
Crucify him; let us burst his bonds assund^r, and Cast away his cords from us,
Let us casse and rescinde our Covenant made to serve him, and be subject to
him; and let us set up a New Lord; and let this be the New Law, that who ever
will not do, according as we have done and decreed, may die. But Alas! have
these men forgotten, that this Insurrection against him is recorded in Heaven,
and that this their rage against his followers (upon whom ^hey run with open
mouth, and against whom they prepare themselves without their fault, being
chargeable with no guilt, abstracting from obedience to their God) is come in
remembrance before him? and that the cry of these oppressed ones is come up
unto the ear of the Lord God of Sabao^h, and will bring him down to execute
judgment for the oppressed: but let us not stumble, nor start aside for all
this; for how astonishing so ever it may be in it self to upright men, yet let
the innocent stir up themselves against those, who have dealt thus
hypocritically with God; and let the righteous still hold on their way, and
such as have clean hands wax stronger and stronger: it is a weakness unworthy
of saints, not to carry as those who have laid their account with the cross, a
reckoning which flesh and blood (always inculcating that carnal Doctrine,
spare thy self) is very unwilling to make.

We still think there is a way (because we would have it so, and often make a
way where he has made none) to shift these hard sayings, and shun these heavy
things: and yet come at Heaven: We fancy a Possiblitie to pass through the
world with the worlds good will, and be religious too. But this is to be wise
above what is written: The Devil must first cease to lie, and murder and
way-lay them that are going to Heaven; and the enmity between the seed of the
woman and the seed of the Serpent must first be done away, or changed into
perfect amity, (which shall never be) before that day dawn, that the traveller
to Heaven needs not lay his reckoning to meet with trouble in the way. But
passing the general account that the wickeds hatred against God is so perfect,
as they hate his Image and Picture, in his Children; yea they like not the
godl^nesse (If I may call it so) of a hypocrit, but hate it? which they do,
(what ever they pretend) not for the evil that is under i^, but for the good
that appears in it: As Lions are said to have so perfect a hatred at man, as
they will tear the picture, because of the resemblance it has to a living man:
neither shall I in^ist upon this cause o^ hatred against the Students of
holiness, that there is a light in a Christians life, who walks as a Child of
light, which discovers the spots of the profane world about him; and with that
light there is a heat also, which scorches and troubles their Conscience; and
therefore they cannot endure them but take all opportunites. to deal with
them as Persons come to torment them before the time, by their shineing and
burning. Besides these general and un^ailing Considerations, which ought to
fortify us in a resolution to make ready for the worse the world can do; there
is somewhat peculiar in our lot, which should make us resolve and determine not
only to suffer, but to have a mixture of gall and worm^wood in our cup.
wherewith Saints are but at some special times exercised: There is a must be
now, for all who will live Godly in Christ Jesus to suffer persecution, and it
were a madness to entertain other thoughts, since our time is a time of
Defection and shameful Apostasy, which has ever been found a ^ime of hot
persecution. This has been ever observed to be the practice of Apostats, to
hate, as hell and to handle as the worst of men, such as stand fast fixed in
owning that cause of God^ which they have relinquished: a man, who resolves to
keep a Conscience void of offense toward God, must take his life in his hand,
and be ^n readiness to part with it, when his lot is to live in a time and
place, where there is power in their hand, who have made shipwreck of Faith and
of a good Conscience. For as Apostasy is the special sin of Devils, and as
Satan the great Apostat hates all, who set their face heaven ^a^d, and are
Servants of that God, and seekers of that blessedness from which he for his
^postasy is everlastingly banished; so whomsoever he withdrawes from the ways
of the Lord, and draws with him into the guilt of Apostasy, he drives them on
also to the same sin of persecu^ing those, who hold on their way, and who
adhere to those precious truths, which they have fo^saken, and are followers of
God as dear Children: and these ^wo have so near and native a connection
together, as he does not only drive without any difficulty those, over whom
for their Apostasy he has obtained a sole soveraignity and dominion, into
these desperate and damnable courses of persecuting the truth, which they have
foresaken, and the Professors ^here of, who hold fa^^ his name: B^t which is
more strange and sad, and should alarm every man into a watchfulness against
the very first and smallest-like degrees o^ defection from the good old ways
of God^r It is observed, that let a man, though sound in the main, slip from
one degree of his zeal and integrity, thoug^ it were but in omission to
stand-up for the defense of the Gospel, when the assaultings of Adversaries
makes it duty; much more if there be a doing of any thing, which will give the
enemies of the work of God the least advantage, he forth with slides also ere
he be aware into a censuring, despising, contemning (if it stop here and go no
further, it is well) of his Brethren, whom he cannot carry alongs with him, and
becomes frequently more active and indnstrious to draw them, whom he has in so
far l^ft, his length, then he is observed to be active in strengthening the
things that remain and are ready to die, amongst a people in a declining time.
Now these things are so plain in our case, as it were supe^fluous for me to
make them more plain. Need I tell you, in whose hand the power is, or of what
spirit and principles these men are, after all the desolation they have made
amongst you? Neither are they yet at an end; and therefore you would be
preparing for new assaults, and laying in provision against the evil day. O
blessed shall the man be, who in this dismal day, shall not be offended in him,
but shall endure to the end. Lay your account therefore with the worst, that
violence and enmity, armed with power, and enflamed to the height of revenge,
can make you suffer, for withstanding this course of iniquity, now carried on
by all means and methods in the Nation. This foresight and providence will be
our wisdom; for when we have done so, we will not be amazed, when that comes to
pass, we had resolved before hand to meet with; or put out of our postour,
when these things do emerge, with which we had laid our reckoning.

But, dear Friends, for fixing yourselves into a firmness of resolution to
hold out and hold on, though it should come to a resisting unto blood, after
you are robbed and spoiled of your goods; Consider that there is nothing in all
these fires and waters, you have to pass through; in all these dangers and
deaths, which are before you; in all these trials, in all these hazards, nay in
all these hells that are betwixt you and heaven, whch can prevail with a soul,
that knows in whom he has believed, or persuade him to cast the blessed
bargan, or go back from his Master, and walk no more with him. Whither shall
we go from thee, for thou have the words of eternal life? was the disciples
deliberat and warm answer to that heart-moving question, will you also leave
me? Leave thee Lord? Leave thee who will, we are for ever tied to an attendance
upon thee, and continuance with thee, both by choice and by the chain of our
own advantage; that eternal life, which is in thee, and is to be had by abiding
with thee, arrests us with a pleasant violence to wait upon thee, while we must
foresake all in following ^hee, and be foresaken of all. But secondly, let us
exercise spiritual reason, and reckon right, and we will perceive, there is
much of present and real advantage to be found in and reaped from the worlds
hatred: and the greatest heat of persecution; who is he that will harm you, if
ye be followers of that which is good? is a question that puts it out of
question, they cannot be harmed even when hurt, and therefore it is immediately
added, 1 Pet. 3:14. But and if ye suffer for righteousness sake, happy a^e ye
etc. It is true, there are none to whom more injur^es are done, then to the poor
persecuted people of God; for as men they are not only borne to trouble, but as
Christians they are borne again unto trouble and appointed thereunto: But it
is as true, that there are none who are so little injured by injuries; for they
get meat out of the ^ater, all these things work together for their good: For
first, hereby the Saints are keept in a right temper toward the world and the
things thereof; whereas i^ they meet with kind usage in it and from it, they
would take too well with it, and sit down short of heaven, and forget to say,
arise let us go hence, for this is not the place of our rest: there remains an
unrenewed part in the saints, which would agree too well, and comply with the
courses and customs of the world; and therefore it is their special adavntage
to be driven off from it by being distressed by it; this bitter potion, which
the world prepares for the people of the Lord, and puts all the gall and worm
wood in it they can, to make it deadly poison, when drunk down and digested, by
faith and patience dissipats and discusses these ill humors, which did weaken
the vitals of Religion, and brought a consumption upon the inward man; and so
proves a sovereign antidot to drive out that poison, which would have killed
the soul, if not purged out. And as it serves for dissolving that union between
the Saints and the world, so secondly it knits them the more closely to him,
who has chosen them out of the world; for when they find themselves dealt
with as strangers and pilgrims in the earth, exposed to all manner of hurt and
hardship, they then are in earnest in seeking that satisfaction in God, which
they miss in this howling wilderness of sorrow; and as they never seek it so
earnestly and ardently, as at such a time; so they never so readily find it,
that they may have a proof that their own portion is fat enough, and can still
afford them royal dainties; and so sit down satis^ied with the enjoyment of
God, even their own God, and sing amidst all wants and miseries, the lines are
fallen to us in pleasant places. The reason then why the people of God are
often in so much heaviness, and frequently hunted and harrassed with trouble
and tentations, is, that they may be hunted by the worlds hatred and evil
handling of them, out of the world, home to heaven; that since they see what
they have to expect here, they may gird up the loins of their mind, and set
their affections on things that are above, where Christ is and there treasure:
and hence it is said, when the scourge slaieth suddenly, he laugheth at the
trial of the innocent; which is not for want of affection, being a^flicted in
all there afflictions; but, if I may say so, besides that he meens them not to
command a calm in the greatest storm, and to have a consort of most sweet
music in their soul, amidst all their miseries, who have an interest in him as
their God, he rejoiceth to think how the happiness of his people is promoved
by their pressures and persecutions; and how much their persecuters are
befooled, who contrare to their purpose contribute their service to the Saints,
whom in their rage they intend to ruin. All men of reason have judged the
mustering and marching of this host against you, a high transport of malice and
madness; in the mean time you mourn, and the enemies laugh amongst
themselves, and the Lord, notwithstanding he takes pleasure in the prosperity
of his people, he rejoices also: But why is it so? It is so not only in
regaird of your Adversaries, at whom he laughs, because he sees their day is
coming, but because he has such a complacency in the soul prosperity of his
people, that Court and Council and all the Nation must be set a work to scour
the Saints, the vessels of honor, that they may shine in the beauty of
holiness, and sing in the begun fruitions of God: And thus by the effects of
this fury, this malice and madness of persecuters, a company of his poor
people, whom they intended to eat up as bread and to destroy, are made meet to
be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light; the place to which
neither they who gave the orders, nor they who obeyed and put them in
execution, shall ever be admitted, except they mourn and amend their manners
too; for heaven is not a place for impure and polluted persons, there is
nothing that defiles or works abomination that can enter-in into that City,
there is neither swine nor puddle there.

But to come more particularly to the purpose, and to show and set before you
what grounds of strong consolation you may have, while handled as you are, by
the persecuting enemy; Consider first, That it ought not only to remove the
strangeness, and to alley the bitterness of your present sad lot; but also
comfort you over it, and while under it, that your sweet Lord and Mast^r was
handled by the world, as you are? If the world hate you, says Christ, you know
that it hated me before it hated you. And therefore for sweetening your lot and
supporting you, Consider him lest you be weary and faint in your minds. O what
weight of sorrows and variety of sufferings did he undergo, both in his life
and at his death? What pinches was he put to? What Pressoures were upon him?
Reproach, Shame, Calumny, Hatred, Persecution met upon him, to make it
appear, he was a man of sorrows: What alley is this to your grief, under
your pressures and Persecutions, that your Lord and Master drunk of the same
cup? he met with much worse handling: Cease then to think strange concerning
this fiery trial; but rather rejoice, in as much as you are partakers of the
sufferings of Christ; this may comfort you, that herein you are conform to
your Lord and Master, If they have persecuted ^e, says he, they will persecut
you.

But secondly, to make the consolation strong indeed, Consider that he not
only was hated of the world, and persecut^d by them, before you were; but he
is such a feeling-head as he still suffers with you, for all the after
fufferings of his servants do ^ir^t light upon him; there is never a stroke
given to one of his members upon the earth, but the stound of it is felt in
Heaven: Saul, Saul why persecuts thou me, being the word of our glorified
Master, puts the matter beyond debate. The quarrel is at Him, and he will own
it, as such, in as much as you did it unto one of these little on^s, you did it
unto me, holds true here: And this is so clear in your case as it passes the
parts of your most pregnant Adversaries to palliat this persecution with any
colorable pretense, which will hide it from being a plain fighting against
God. Is it not the purity of their malice and perfection of their hatred
against Christ as King, which pouseth them on, and Prompts them to this
persecution? Let them ^ender any other reason for what they have done, if they
can. For when to complete the revolt of the Nation from its sworn subjection
and obedience to Jesus Christ, as Supreme in his own-house^ they have substitut
and constitut another in his place, and have framed a Supremacy in to a Law, to
be the rule and standar^, according to which our Kings, in all succeeding
generations, shall of right King it over the house of God, as knowing no
Superior, with a more simple absolutnes^e, then the Law of the Nation will
permit them to do over the house, inheritance, interest or concern of the
meanest subject in the Kingdom: by which Law our Lord Jesus Christ is most
explicitly exa^torat, he is declared to have neither house, people nor
property in Scotland. Le^ any read over our late Supremacy, and sense it, and
consider if its lowest amount be not this; we have no King but Caesar. And to
make it emphatickly expressive of this, whereas other Acts of Supremacy
(vvherby yet our Lord Jesus Chrest was vvronged, and his royal prerogative
encroached upon) did still for shame leave him the title; and a supremacy was
pretended unto under God, and his Son Christ, and a derivation and conveyance
from that fountain was in words acknowledged; that the iniquity of our
Supremacy might be supreme^ an absolute, independent, arbitra^y dominion is
attributed to our Kings, settled upon them by Law: And for the more security,
this power is declared to be the i^trinsick right and the inherent prerogative
of the imperial Crown of the Nation, whereby al-Church-mat^ers are subjected
to their imperial wisdom, to do in all these as they think fit; and the
managment of these are so solely in his Majesty's power, that whereas the
Council acts in Civils in a subordination to his Maj. according to the Law of
the Land, His Maj: may make use of what kind of persons so ever he will;
passing by Parliament or Council, to put all the incontrolable dictats and
decrees of his Maj. wisdom and good pleasure, concerning Church matters, in
execution; And therefore that we may be no longer in suspense, nor solici^ous
about the sense of our Supremacy, and that the Church may hen^ceforth know and
acknowledge, who is her Lord and undoubted Superior, whose it is to give Laws
and appoint Officers, to put them in execution; and that there may be none, in
heaven or earth, to pretend to any part of this power, or paritie in this
Supremacy, the name of God and of his Son Christ is omitted in it, and (because
mentioned in other Supremacies) must be conceived to be delet out of ours. (O!
the patience of God, that their names^ yea that the name of the Nation, where
such a wicke^nesse was decreed, is not before this perished from under the
heavens!) It is true^ this pleased me best in all that Supremacy, because it
was plain dealing, without all cloak or complement; for now Jesus Christ has
neither thing nor name of Kingly power left him, but is most explicitly put
from the exercise of his royal Government; And Church Laws are no more to
pass in the old style, nor are things as formerly to be done there by virtue
of the Authority of this one Jesus, who calls himself a King; But according
to the new style. And so hence forth, Church Laws must bear the datum of the
Julian account. Now our Rulers, having framed this Law, for heinousness of
hatred and h^ight of opposition to the Lords anointed, whom he has made King
in Zion, beyond the most supreme Supremacies, that ever were framed or molded
into laws, since God made man upon the earth; or Satan, that he might destroy
the Church, prompted men to compet with the Mediator and strive with him for
state, y^a even in its prodigious shape and feature, beyond what was arrogat by
the Man of sin, the Antichrist, that Son of Perdition^ Our blessed Lord Jesus,
who has all his enemies in de^ision, stirred up the spirit of some of his
zealous Ambassadors to go forth and give a Testimony against the heinousness
of this usurpation of their Masters Crown and Sc^pter (which will be their
crown, and which should be now our main question upon which we act and suffer,
as we expect his p^esence and supportings, either in doing or suffering) and in
pursuance of that Commission, which they had received from him, to preach in
^eason and out of season, and to negociat a peace betwixt this great and
glorious King and poor guilty sinners: whereupon our blessed Lord Jesus Christ,
though slighted and set at naught by our Rulers, both to signify his
complacency in the zeal of his faithful servants, ^ired into an holy fervo^
for the Prerogative of their exalted Prince, from the observation of the fury,
whereby they saw he was opposed; and to refute till more come, (O! that is
coming, which may and certainly would make their souls tremble, if thought
upon, the apprehensions of the righteous revenges he will ^ake, for this
contempt cast upon him, and when he will return their reproach upon them, by
speaking unto them in his wrath, and vexing them in his sore displeasure) the
folly and infatuation of that new Pretense to his incommunicable Prerogative^
royal, framed into a Law, and that by an argument easy to be understood by the
poorest Less and Lad in the Nation, he goes forth conquering and to conquer,
by the Ministry of these his despised servants, and thus he reigns as King in
the m^dst of his rageing enemies, and acts wonderously, so that to the
conviction of all, he holds the hands of his servants, upholds them at his
work, and does from tha^ day greater things by them, then ever, in regaird of
many circumstances, were done in the Nation: he makes such noble and notable in
roads upon Satan's territories, and these dark places of the land, where the
Prince of darkness had an indisturbed dominion, as multitudes are made, in
this day of his power, to follow after and fall in love with Ordinances,
dispensed by his own O^ficers, and flock unto the standart of this exalted
Prince: a proof as great as ever was given of his reigneing, and that his
people shall be willing in the day of his power, though all the powers of the
earth were on a conspiracy against him, and abused that power to the fainting
of his followers, and the fr^ghting of them into a dis^oyal relinquishing of
Jesus Christ: which the Adversary perceiving, and finding that to no purpose
they had cru^ified Christ aga^ne, and put him to open shame, by taking his
Crown and Scepter from him, and bu^ying his Supremacy in the grave, which they
had made for it, under the fabric of their newly erected one, and that in
vain they had set a watch to keep the grave, and fearing withal that this
reviving of his work, and resurrection of his cause, might prove to them a
second error, worse by far then the first; Therefore, that rovers may not be
ruers, and to fortify themselves in the pos^ession of what they had taken by
their Law from our Lord Jesus Christ, and to prevent his returning to his
throne, and his reassuming the exercise of his royal Government (o let their
fear come upon them, who fear left Christ should reign!) an Host must be
gathered, on purpose to march into the West, as that part of the Nation (o
happy and honorable cognizance!) where Jesus Christ had most remarkably rung,
and which still was looked upon by them, as the Kings headquarters; whereupon
it is resolved that that poor Country shall be invaded, the people in the mean
time, having behaved themselves as peacably as any part of the nation, being
amazed at the rumor of this rage against them, and the resolution taken to
pour^in upon them such a company of Barbar's, as their carriage and cruelty is
beyond my describings, send some of their number to declare that they were most
peacable; but to bind themselves to such a compliance with the course of the
time, (that is, upon the matter, to cooperat with the workers of iniquity, and
to st^p Christ's Ambassadors from delivering their message, and to hinder the
people from meeting together to hear what he would say unto them, by such as
he has clothed with a commission, and called to ^^eake in his name) as a
thing now no more in their power (o let it never be in the power of these
abusers of their power, for hindering the word of the Lord to have a free
course and to be glorified!) But as to the secureing o^ themselves against all
these groundless apprehensions of an insurrection, there was no way so proper,
no way so possible. as to suffer the sent servaints of Jesus Christ to preach
and persuade the things belonging to the Kingdom of God. But this seemed so
insufferable, and such a plain and practical contradiction to the Supremacy, in
its new (o let it never wax old; ovrt^rne, o Lord, overtu^ne, overturne, till
he come whose right it is!) elevation, as the same real and practical re^urne
was given to it, which Pharaoh gave to that request Exodus 5:1 Thus says the
Lord God of Israel let my people go tha^ they may hold a feast to me in the
wilderness? And verse 2. Pharaoh said, who is the Lord, that I should obey his
voice, to let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go: I
say, the thing sought, on the behalf of that poor people, s^emes to be of a
piece with that of Moses and Aaron; for it was this upon the matter, If you
have taken all the houses of God in possession, If you have driven Jesus Christ
out of all the Cities of the Nation; yet will you leave him, will you allow him
some place in the open feil^s to met with his followers? will you suffer him
and his to hold their Assemblies in the wilderness, in some moss or Mountain?
No, that may not be heard, it has a ha^efulnesse in it^ as implying a proper
and peculiar soveraignity still ascribed unto Jesus Christ as King,
inconsistent with and subversive of our new Supremacy. And therefore nothing is
now heard, but muster and march: And thus an host is raised with as great
solemnity and celerity, with as much pomp and parad of Artillery, etc. to
invade that poor peacable company, as if the land had been invaded by the most
formidable and furious foreign enemy; and empowered withal to do and act at
that rate of violence as the actors of all imaginable mischeifs are secured by
Law from all fear of future hazard, for what ever violence they commit, or
wickedness they can perpetrat; if ^hey have but the wit to say in their own
defense, it was done to answer the end of that expedition, and for his Maj.
service against those, who profess subjection to another in soul-concerns. Now
as there was never an act of Supremacy so explicitly in all points opposite to
the kingly power of our Lord Jesus Christ, as this late one of ours, (an act
only defineable by its own wickedness, for this is Supremacy;) so besides the
stupenduous unreasonablenesse of this course without a parallel, for a
Magistrate to run upon and ruin his own peacable subjects, without a
provocation on their part, or the least ground in law to justify the cruelty
of this procedour on his part; besides this, I say, no man who does narrowly
look into the matter, and consider the quarrel, but he must see it, he must
say it, that since God made man upon the earth, since soldiers were mustered
and marched under colors and command, never was there an army raised, or an
host put so formally to march up with displaied banner against Christ as King;
for this is the sum, substance and soul of all that can be said, as the
genuine import of this expedition; Christ Jesus, from whom we have taken the
Crown by Law, is yet like to keep some possessions o^ the Nation; come
therefore let us march into the fields; And since he calls himself a King^ and
will trouble us with Conventicles and field meetings, and since his followers
and these who flock unto him affirm him both to be a King and Captain, yea
that King against whom there is no riseing up, because he is the Lord of Hosts;
let him meet us in the feilds, and mainta^n his ^itle, and vindica^ his
prerogative; for as we have no King but Caesar, so this is our quarrel: And if
he will not draw out and draw up, if he will not measure swords with us, then
as we have taken his house in Possession, so we shall fall on, and by the
strong hand t^ke the houses of all into possession, who will not renounce their
depen^ance upon him as Sovereign and Supreme, and shut them out, either to die
in the fields wi^h him^ or ^^ob or starve t^em in their houses, who will not
applaud our having taken his house in^o possession. My soul trembles to give
the obvious sense of those our Rulers proceedings; nor date I give my pen it is
just liberty to unbowel this course, and lay open the blasphemies wherewith it
is big even ^o a bursting: Neither is it necessare for me, for every one, who
does not shut his own eyes, must see, that hatred against Christ, and the
coming of his Kingdom, expressed in this expedition, which he cannot, he dare
not, without horror and amazement express: who can suffer himself to resolve
the practice of Rulers (who have bound their souls to obedience, fidelity, and
loyalty to Christ, as King, under the penal^ie of the forfeiture of their
immortal souls) into this, which is it is native and necessare sense: We are now
wearied of the government of Jesus Christ^ It is a yoke we cannot bear, we
will not bear, we are resolved once for all to burst these his bonds, and cast
away these his cords from us: We are wearied of this his Church Jurisdiction:
Let him be gone therefore out of our borders: Let his name as King and
Sovereign be no more in remembrance: We have set up another in his place; and
have soudered into a samenesse his Crown, with the Imperial Crown of the
Nation, and have setl^d that upon the head of our King, and whosoever shall
succeed him; (the most dangerous and deadly decree, that ever was made for that
succession) so that now, all his old pretenses to a Royal prerogatvie amongst
us for the futu^e are cut off; or if he will clame any interest,
notwithstanding of this our Law; let him now appear to try the justice of his
tittle and pre^ence by the sword: We are now drawn into the fields, to maintain
what we have done: Where is he? If his followers meet together to oppose us, we
have what we would, for then we will make a breakfast of them: And if not, we
shall put all, who will not bow before the Dagon of our new erected Supremacy,
once for all and for ever out of case to appear afterward: For this end have
we gathered our host: For this end do we march: Fall on, red shankes: Fear
not, have not we bid you: You are pitched upon as the most qualified Soldiers
for this expedition against the Mediator, whom we have denied to be a Monarch,
and proper instruments for our purpose, for we know you well to be such as
these must be, who will do our busin^ss^, even men who fear not God nor
reguard not men; March therefore, right trusty and well beloved Sara^ens, ye
who call not upon the Lord, (and so are only sit to be at our call and
bidding) and eat up his People in the West, who call upon him, as bread: Make
these the Mediators subjects smart for it; and either bring them to bind
themselves no more to own Him nor his Ambassadors; or leave such monuments of
your savage cruelty behind you, as will answer the keenness against Christ of
those who send you in this expedition, we have secured you against all hazard
(hell excepted; and we know, you no more fear that, then we do) of future
danger or pursuit, for what destruction you bring upon these against whom we
send you; only destroy?

Most dear Brethren, what miseries you have endured by the barbaritie of these
Monsters, let loose upon you, are the matter of amazement, mourning and
lamentation to all, who in every place call upon the Name of Jesus Christ ou^
Lord, both theirs and yours, to whose ears the report of your sufferings is
come. But amidst all these calamities and cruelties, you are not without
comfort: O what a cordial may this be, to remember and consider, both who
suffers with you, and for whose sake you suffer these thin^s! You cannot
consider this, but it will comfort you over your loss: when this is laid to
heart, yeu! will not so much be moan the loss of what is robbed from you, as
you will bless that ever you had any thing to lose for his sake, who sav^d you
when ye were lost: You will then wonder at the honor, and re^oice that you are
counted worthy to suf^er these things for his sake, who for your sake suffered
far other things: You will take joyfully the spoiling of your goods for him,
who for your sakes became poor, that you through his pover^ie might be made
rich: O what will not be ^asie and sweet to suffer for that sweet names sake,
which is as an ointment poured forth, by the savor whereof, your dead souls
have been quickened, and your drouping and desponding spirits revived, cheered
and comforted! Consider then, since Christ your King, your Captain, and
Savior, neither did, nor does escape the worlds malice and persecution; and
since he was hated and handled as the vvorst of men, and now again in the
vvorst of times, is so dealt with; if it be not reasonable, that we should
provide for the like, and resolve to go through the many tribulations, which
may be fall us in his company, and for his sake: If we intend to follow him to
the place of fruition, we must go that way, which he has paved before us, it
cannot be avoided; yea, how incongruous were it, if we could? How unsuteable
were it? That the Lord and Master should meet with so much suffering, for the
servants sake, and rejoice amidst it all, as knowing he should see a seed, and
have this recompense and satisfaction for all the travel of his soul, that the
souls of his servants should reap the advantage of what he underwent for them:
That he shonld be beaten for the servants sake, that through his stripes the
servants might be healed; and the servants to be always favored, and
applauded in that world, which had put the Master to shame and suffering, while
he was negociating his servants business? And as he hid not his face from
shame and spiting for their sake; so he laid down his life upon their interest.
Were it seemly, that he who bore their burdens, should wade and swime through
^eas of sorrows, and they sail in streams of pleasure? That he should be
crowned with thorns, to purchase them an immortal Crown, and they crowned with
roses? That he should be hun^ed, and had not whereupon to lay his head, that he
might, by being handled so, purchase a Kingdom to his followers: that he
should go through death, and such a death, and be laid in the grave, that he
might have access to go and prepare a place for them, and take possession of
the undefiled inheritance, as their common Head, and Trustee, in whom and with
whom they now sit in heavenly places; and they dwell at ease in their own
house? Truly, to say nothing of the after glory, (for who can say what it is,
since it is above apprehensions? Only this is sure, that they who suffer with
him, shall also reign with him) if there were no more, then the present
shar^ing and partaking in his sufferings, it were honor enongh. O how much
above all regal dignite is it! And how in comparably beyond the fancied honor
of a diadem, to be crowned with thorns for Christ's sake! There is an
inherent glory for suffering in Christ, beyond all the ambition of the world^
after that painted and putrid glistering bubble, with the glanceing whereof
vain men are so much taken up. If this were keept in the view of the soul, what
strength would it furnish? What support would it supply the spirit of a
sufferer for Christ with? but, dear friends, the word of your Testimony and
Patience has somewhat of a precious peculiaritie in it, not only in reguard
that it is the presently opposed Truth, you are persecuted for, and so must be
sweet because seasonable; but the Word of your Testimony, and that Truth, for
owneing of which, yon are put to su^^er the loss of all things, is that very
Truth, for which Christ himself suffered as a Martyr: Viz. That H^ was a King ^
This Question is put to day unto his followers, with greater contempt than
Pilat put it, What, and is Jesus a King then? O noble cause! O who would not
rejoice to enter the lists of Contradiction with these his enemies, and have
once an opportunity, to say Yea, he is a King, and will be a King, when you ^re
gone, and will prove himself higher then the Kings of the earth, by rescinding
your Supremacy, that Idol of his indignation, and object of his revenge! O what
ambition should this raise in the soul of every saint! what patience in
tribulation should this produce? what holy courage? what humble boasting? what
triumphing and rejoyceing to be offerred up a sacrifice upon the Interest of
this Kings Crown? Can you consider, that your present sufferings and losses are
a seal to that great Truth, which Christ sealed with his blood, and not blush
at the honor, and bless him for ever, that now the source, rise and conduct
of the Rulers procedour against you, and their barbarous c^uelty, give you not
only confidence, to pour out your heart before him, and present your c^s^ and
cause, in this General, for thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are
counted as sheep for the slaught^r: But more particularly, when you can sist
your selves before him, and sob out your sorrows, in these words; of a truth
Lord, against thy Holy Ch^ld Jesus, whom thou have ano^n^ed, are all th^se
gathered together, and it is for our owning of him; as thy anointed, and
r^fuseing to be on that conspiracy, that we ore thus used: I know not what can
give ground of gladenesse in a man's life, or what can be cause of gloriation
in death, if resisting unto blood upon such a quarrel, and not loving a man's
life unto death in such a cause, will not give ground for it?

Beloved Friends, and much honour^d sufferers for Christ, you know, since you
are taught of God that the way to overcome all trouble here, and to carry as
becomes Saints under it, is, to look above it, and beyond it; above it, to the
high and supreme hand that sends it, and disposes of it, so as it may subserve
your great Interest (for in despite of the malice and madness of all inferior
agents, all these dire and dreadful things shall together with him, who works
mightily in his people and for them, work together for your ^ood;) and beyond
it, and above it, to the end of it, and the recompense of reward following
after it: This is the way to profit by pressures, to be gainers in all losses;
This is the ground of sweet peace, and serenitie of mind, amidst all trouble;
and the solid foundation for patience of Spirit: For, he is only in a capaciti^
to possess his spirit in patience, whose spirit has received these
impressions, without which, the soul will be still disquieted: Trouble will
still toss it, as a ball in a large place, and it will prove unstable as
water. I suppose, since you are Saints, and so must have some impressions of
the absolute Soveraignitie of God, that though, in your searchings, you could
not find out or fix upon the cause of his contendiug with you thus; yet you
would either be silent, or say, it is the Lord, let him do unto us what
seems him good: And if he have no pleasure in our livei^g, and dwelling in
our little huts, and houses; Bnt will drive us thence, the will of the Lo^d be
done. But not to insist on this, which yet you will grant to be infinitely
rational, (for who has enjoined him his way^ or who may say unto him, what
do thou?) there is sufficient to keep you and me, and the Christians of this
generation from fr^ting^ and saying (while in the fire, and while the rod of
the wicked rest upon your lot, and these plowers plow upon your back, and make
their furrows longer and deeper, than all these plowers^ which went before
them did: O when will God Loose the plough, by cutting asunder the cords of the
wicked, and confou^ding and turning them all back that hate you? He is the
Lord, who will hasten it in his time, to show that he is righteous: Let us weep
for what we have done; And wait in hope for what he will do) why are we thus,
Surely a sight of our sin would make us wonder that we are not worse: yea
admire his goodness, who will be at all this pains about us, to heal us of
these mortal diseases, whereof our immortal souls are sick even unto death: I
am sure, that the crimson dye of our crying iniquities would curb our
impatience, and cure us of that evil of quarrelling with him, because of our
suff^rings. Consider therefore, however you suffer very unjustly from men,
against whom you have done nothing justly to procure their indignation; yet, if
you look within you, and lift up your eyes above you, and consider, how the cry
of your transg^essions is come up into his ear, you will be constrained, not
only to justify him, in this seeming severi^ie; but to confess, from
clearness and conviction, you are punished less then your iniquities des^rve:
And that it is of the Lords merc^ you are not consumed, because his compassions
fail not. Hence is it, tha^ when the Apostle Peter has been speaking of the
fiery trial 1 Pet. 4^12, 13, 14, 15, 16. (which this day in our case) and has
been encouraging and comforting them, to a pa^^ent end^rein^, while schor^hed
with these flames, by many noble arguments; yet when he looks upon these heavy
afflictions as coming from God, he calls them ver^. 17 judgments, intima^ing
thereby, that his precious and peculiar people, how upright and innocent
soever, as to men; yet, they are guilty before God, the righteous judge; and
that they mu^^ acknowledge, when ^hey ^ist th^mse^ves in his sight, that what
ever they suffe^ is the fruit of their own doings, and that by their
provocations they have procured these things, and rewarded all these evils unto
their own soul, by not walking worthy of him, nor before him to all pleasing.
If his people, by their multiplied and manifold sins, did not extort (if I may
say so) strokes our of his hand, he, who does not a^^lict willingly, nor grieve
the Children of men, but has pleasure in the prosperity of this people, would
not so often take the rod in his hand, or would soon cast it into the ^ire; for
he does not love to lash beyond necessity; and therefore, when he has
performed his whole work upon mount zion, he casts the rod into the fire, and
punishes the fruit of the stout heart of his and his peoples enemies, and the
glory of their high looks. The saints you know, Brethren, how graciows and
grown so ever, they are but Children, and therefore must be under Chastisment:
The best of them are given to many Childish toys, and not a few of them, in
whom the root of the matter may be, yea will be found, are so far from abideing
wit^ God in their callings, and from adorning the Doctrine of God the Savior,
that so men, by seeing their good works, may glorify their Father, which is in
heaven, that there is a groffnesse in their way, their iniquity is often found
upon the skirts of their garmen^s, and their spots are so unlike the spots of
the people of God, and Persons made partakers of the divine nature, that
because of these mouths of enemies are opened to blaspheme the name of God, and
reproach the blessed Profession: But seting thsee aside, Alas! how do they,
who escape such gross pollutions, yet often trifle in the matter of communion
with God? How formal and lukewarm in their addresses; So that he who seeks
the heart, and will be worshipped in Spirit and Truth, misseth their soul, in
their service? How seldom ar^ they in Heaven? How little dwelling upon the
thoughts of Jesus Christ, and the great s^lvation purchased by him, on purpose
to have him precious in the soul's esteem, and endeared according to his
infinite preferablenesse to all other things, unto the heart? How few serious
designs? And how little solid endeavor to be like him, and to have every
thought of the heart brought in captivity to his obedience? How little
meditation upon the Glory to be revealed, till the heart be ravished, and
transported into admiration a^ it is inconceiveable greatness and in^init
goodness? How seldom in soliloquies wi^h him? whence Alas! it comes to pass,
that men, having, through carnalitie of Converse with other things, disframed
their heart for duties do not pray and jest with the same seriousness, but
there is more of their soul in a vain sport, then in prayer, which when
rightly performed, is the pouring out of the heart to God, and the wringing of
the man's suit^s through his soul, carrying the af^ections the^eof with it. Nay,
what of desire and love to the world, and the things ther^of? What lusting and
longing after the things of this life? what stretching (even to the dislocation
of the soul, and putting it out of case, for a converse with God, wherein the
soul of Religion lies) what Grasping to get a grip of these things, which when
got hold of, can neither be held, nor make happy; What wrestling? what
struggling? What striveing, to get on a load of thick Clay? whereby the soul of
him, who is thus loaded, is put out of case often for following hard after God,
and so running as he may obtain? How are they often swallowed up in the cares of
this life? With what complacency do they frequently sinck themselves, in the
dunghill of this world, into the inconsideration and oblivion of the other
world, and their eternal Interest? How are they hurried with their passions?
How puffed up with pride? How un mortified to the delights of the sons of men?
How irregular in their motions, which shows the irreligiousnesse of their
mindings? Alas! their Love and hatred (which gives the best account of a
Christian) do seldom run in the right channel, or are rarely terminat upon the
proper objects; or when it falls so out, that their face is in the right airth;
yet, how slow is their motion, in following their look? How languid are their
pantings? What Lifelesnesse? What ^istlesnesse appears in their pursuings?
Yea, how quickly do they sit up, or turn aside out of the way of following the
Lord fully? But who can reckon these things up in order? Alas! that which is
wanting, to fill up the just import of exercising our selves to Godliness,
cannot be numbered! And therefore, seeing these things are to be found with his
people, must he not visit their transgressions with the rod, and their
iniquities wi^h stripes, and that because he will not take his loveing
kindness from them, nor su^^er his ^aithfulnesse to ^ail: it is needful, that
they be often in the fire, for burning-away their dross, and in the water for
washing off their defilements; yea their propension to depart from him, and to
pollute themselves in the pudle, preaches, in order to the prevention of this,
the necessity of keeping this people all ways under ^od, though not always
under the stroke of it: for then the spi^its should fail before him, and the
souls that he had made. Con^ider therefore, dear f^iends, the procureing cause
of this deep distress, and if we be impartial in the search, we will find an
accursed thing with us, and this will provoke us to do the greatest haste
first, which is, the taking vengeance o^ our own inventions against him; and
impose the necessiti^ upon us to turn away from the evil of our ways, that he
may turn from the fiercnesse of his anger: Let us, even in the midst of our
trouble, rise up above the thoughts, and conside^ation of lower agents, and
instruments of our suffering, which are the Devil and the world, who are his
Tru^^ees, and acted by him, in the work of Persecution R^v. 2.10. (For it is
not su^eable for Saints nor safe for them to dwell long there) and take a view
of our own guilt, that our being punished as our Congregations have heard, may
preach unto us the Doctrine of the evil of sin, and make us in stead of our
woe's me's for other things, cry out, woe uuto us that we have sinned? Our not
walking as became the Gospel, if thought upon, will put us in the paenitents
posture, (and surely he is out of his posture this day, who is not in that
posture, and till we be in it; in vain do we exspect, to hear him say that
word, as ye were) which is a looking unto him whom we have pierced, and a
weeping: And it is in order to the produceing of these noble, and necessare
effects^ that there is a must be for judgment it is beginning at the house of
God. I cannot in these few Pages, fol^ow this matter at any length; but^ let
this abrupt hint put you to the work of searching, and exercise of Godly
sorrow; And to make this work both profitable to you, and pleasant to him, be
not jealous of his love, because of what he has laid upon your loins; for in
all this rough-like dealing and seeming severitie, bowels of tender mercies
earne over you, in these agonies: Love, though the noise and sound of it is feet
be not heard, because of the noise of the enemy, does both walk and work, in
these your sufferings: As man^ as I love I rebuke and chasten, is the word of
him, who is love it self, to them, whom he most dea^ly loves: the principle
and the period of all his proc^dour is love, even when he lasheth; For this is
written on every lash, I love so well as I will not lose, I love so well as I
must embrace; and therefore, by purgeing I must put the beloved party in case
to embrace and be emb^aced: I purpose to dwell in them, and to let them know by
my familiarity, how much I delight in them; and therefore I must cleanse them,
from all these Idols, and all the filthinesses, which seperat betwixt me and
them In a word, as in the Jeweler's shope and work house, there lies, besides
the rough diamonds, the choicest jewels, and richest rings, his cutting iro^s,
files, and other sharp pointed Instrumeuts, under which they must all pass,
and whereby ^hey must be polished; so, in this life, where he is melting his
gold, to cleanse it, from its dross, and making up his jewels, to the end
their beaut^e may be perfect; yea, that they may shine in the be^^ties of
holiness, they must be under his cu^tings, his carvings and the point of his
sharpest inst^uments: whosoever shall be a crown of glory in the hand of the
Lord and a royal diadem in the hand of their God, must pass under the purgings
and polishings of his hand: Th^^e are none whom he minds to make pillars in his
temple to go no more forth, but he works for the self ^ame thing, by making
them pass under his polishing instruments, that so they may be made to shine
as the sun in the firmament, and put in case to see God, when made l^ke him:
But besides that his purpose of having them in his company for ever, pu^s him
to be at the pains of making them meet, even by the ^h^ngs that they suffer,
(as the mean which he graciously and wisely uses and orders for that end) to
be partakers of the inheritance of the s^i^ts in light: as is clear, comparing
Coloss. 1:11. with 12. he minds to be familiar with them here al^o, and admit
them sometime while in the way, and in the wilderness, to eat Manna, and to
feast their souls in the begun fuitions of God; and therefore to commend and
endeare this life unto them, he makes the world mingle a cup of gall and worm
vvood, and put it in their hand, and hold it to their head, he beats them off
from the world, that would vvrong them, in into his own bo^ome; O blessed
repose! the place indeed, where the vvearie find both rest and refreshing.

But here I must be abrupt, and leave the matter to be dilated and dwelt upon
by you in yo^^ Meditation: Only let me say, that the serious minding of these
things would not only prove a happy diversion, and prevent the fretings of
your mind, by an unprofitable poreing upon your fiery af^liction; But, it would
be the certain way to give you meat out of this eater^ Your mind would not
only be keep 't from being grangrened into impatience, and galled with the
load which lies upon your loins; But you would be made glade and comforted over
all your sorrows, and sufferings, by beholding the end of the Lord, and the
gracious design he is driveing about you, which is, to make you up for ever,
by b^ing ^^us undone: And to order these light afflictions, which are but for a
moment, so, as they shall work for you a far more exceeding, and eternal weight
of glory. This is that wheel wi^hi^ all ^^ese wheels; and this is his purpose
toward you, the thoughts of whose heart take place in all Generations: These
things are upon his heart, and he cannot miss what he aims at; and therefore
you cannot be miserable, amidst all the miseries you suffer from them, who cast
iniquity upon you, and in wrath have you: Nay therefore you cannot miss to be
happy, amidst all these, he has blessed you, and you shall be so.

But, dear friends, besides this general Consideration of your sin, and mine,
which is necessary for our profiting by every touch of his hand, suffer me to
sugg^st the necessity of a particu^ar enquiry; for when ever the Lord does
pursue a Church or a Land, wi^h such a Church-desolating, and Land-destroying
stroke, as we have been under, these so many years (thou^h wickedness and
violence, in this assault upon you, is come to such a Prodigious height, as it
is a surprise and matter of astonishment to all who look on; nay I am
persuaded, if no^ many years ago, it had been told these who have given the
o^ders, that they would do what now ^h^y both do and defend, they would have
given H^zaels answer) he is then particularly pointing at some high and p^blick
Provocation, which his soul hates, wherein that Church and Nation is involved,
and wh^reby they have made themselves deeply guilty: There is some accursed
thing amongst that People, and Church, when he breaks down what he had built,
and gives up the dearly beloved of his soul, into the hand of her en^mies:
(which is our present condition) And when it is thus, It is high time to awake
out of sleep, and to consider, that this is; and to enquire, and accomplish a
diligent search for finding that out, for which his anger is fallen upon them,
lest God both search out the iniquity of that people, till he find none; and
search out the iniquity of their refusing to search, and then sweep them away,
as a generation of his wrath, and seperat them for evil, as those in whom his
soul has no pleasure: Nay, that which will certainly make a generation, a
generation of his wrath, and cause him heap misch^ifs upon them, and spend his
arrows upon them, is, when after such a fire is kindl^d, as threat^ns the
consumption of all, with its flame, men are not awakened to enquire, what
means the heat of this great anger? O, when they are so unfaithful, as either
to be silent, when they see it; or are so oraculous, in their ^inting at the
guilt (in stead of acquiting themselves so faithfully to God, and so
affectionatly to the souls of the unconcerned, as to point it forth, and be so
plain, as they may thereby cause them to know their abominations) as if they
designed not to be understood. I grant, men may mistake in assigning causes;
and happy is that land, which ha^h these amongst them, in such a day, to whom
the mou^h of the Lord has spoken, that they may d^clare it, for what the land
perishes: And yet, if we will search the Scriptures, and consult the records
of the Church in her several periods, we will find, that public
Church-desolating judgments, had ever the guilt of that people so evidently
engraven on them, as he who did run might have read i^; so that the
dispensation seemed to cry every one into the consideration of the clearly
procuring provocation, and say, O Generation, see the Word of the Lord! When he
executs the judgment written, then he cloths his word with such a visible
Garment, as the man of wisdom must read his name of righteousness upon his
rod, and the g^^lt of that people, whom he so punishes. All of us therefore
are called to a serious consideration of the caus^s of Gods displeasure, drawn
out to such a length. and arisen to such a height against us: What then does
such a stroke? What does such a Church-ruine, after such a blessed reformation
(I neither fear nor blush to call it blessed, notwithstanding of an act
rescissory made to bury it, and the belchings forth of enemies against it, and
all the Blashphemings of that great and good work of God by the Adversaries
thereof) I say what does it say to us? I cannot give the answer, in more proper
and plaint ermes, than in the Prophet Jeremiah his words, Chap. 22. where the
question is proposed, v. 8. by all that pass by, wherefore thath the Lord done
this unto this great City? The Answer is given, v. 9. Because they h^^e
foresaken ehe Covenant of the Lord their God: Which is ^his upon the matter;
they had made themselves monsters for sin, and God has made them marvells for
judgment, and se^ up a monument to the commendation of his righteousness,
over the ruin of these Covenant^breakers: what means this sad change; that the
Lord, who rejoiced over us to do us good and to multiply us, is now turned
against us, as if he were rejoyceing over us to destroy us, and to bring us to
naught? Oh! This his anger with such a witness does give a distinct sound! It
palpably decl^res, and plainly proclaims our Defection from God, and Apostasy
from him, after we had bound our souls with an oath to the contrare: It is not
only because we were not answerable to our Covenant-engagements, to study
holiness in the fear of God, and walk like a people dedicat and devo^ed to
him, (though such a breach goes always before, and the other follows after)
Bu^ because we dealt unfaithfully in thar Covenant made for Reformation in his
house; we be^ame lukewarm in the cause, and so the curse of dete^table
ne^trality has over taken us: our solemn acknowledgement of sin, and
engagements to duties, were forgotten: Yea, we proceeded from one degree of
unfaithfulness and infixed^esse in our Covenant with the most High, to
another, till the whole of that Covenanted-work of Reformation was surrendered,
and put in their power, who have destroyed all, and razed and overturned the
blessed foundations of that beautiful structure: and this was done, with such a
have and precipitation; as he was looked upon as a peevish Ridicule, who would
have advised, in that day, to see previously to the security of Religion,
before these were put in power, who were it is known and constant enemies: And
so, what ou^ worthy Forefathers (of truly blessed memory) by their zeal,
their wisdom, their courage for God, their valient contendings for the truth,
their prayers, their witnessings, their sufferings, had by the good hand of
their God upon them wrought out for us, and put us in possession of, we blindly
and basely abandoned all, and suffered our selves to be fooled out of the
cause, and out of our faithfulness to Christ, with a flourish or small parcel
of good words. And it is for this iniquity, that the holy and righteous Lord
pursues us this day: it is for this, that he does punish us by these very
hands, into whose hands we put power, to overturne his work, and left them at
liberty to do so. Now O generation, see the word of the Lord. It is not my
purpose here^ to give an account of the several steps of our defection, or to
draw the lineaments of it is black visage: that is an undertaking above my pen
and parts: let the Lord, with whom is the residu^ of the spirit, find out and
furnish some for it: and O that for my interest in the defection, and my
accession to the cause of Gods contending this day with poor S^otland, I may
ob^ain mercy to go mourning to my grave! This may be cried out upon as Treason:
well; if the mentioning of the Land's treacherous dealing with God be called
Treason, all my Apology is, that that makes the necessity of doing it double,
and indispensible duty: let me be a Traitor, if that be Treason: But I know
this may be particularly bogled at, and abom^nat, as if it were the reviving
and raking again out of the ashes, wherein they were burnt, and by the burners
designed for ever to lie buried, of the causes of wrath: I need say little as
to this; But that the Causes of wrath need neither my patrociny, nor Apology;
they carry along their own s^d and certain evidence with them: and I judge
many, who did not then see so far, as these Seers did, who drew them up, and
mourned before the Lord, under the conviction of the gu^lt therein held forth,
have since been convinced to their cost, that the secret of the Lord was with
these his Servants, and that they stood in his Counsel: and if any of them be
^ot, they may be ere all bedone. O the burning of the Covenant in England and
the Causes of wrath in Scotland, shall certainly be followed, with a fire and
siercenesse of indignation, as shall make Authors, Actors, Abettors, and
Rejoycers thereat, know what it is, to give such an open defiance to the
Almighty. A Covenant burnt, and burnt by Authority, in the sight of heaven,
with such hell-black solemnities, where the great God is Altera pars
Contrahens, for Reformation of Religion according to his word, and
righteounesse in walking before him, is such a sin, as may make every soul to
tremble, at the fore-thoughts of what God will do, for vindicating his glory
from that contempt thereby cast upon him. My present business is not to
address my self by way of Testimony, or representation to them, who have done
such horrid things: Only I wish, that the burning of that City into ashes,
where that Covenant was burnt, together with that non-such plague, and war, may
make them take warning, ere it be too late, who did this wickedness: for Alas!
all that is come, will be forgotten, when the wrath and vengeance that is yet
coming shall be execute and mentioned. O England, England, I fear, I fear thy
woe hasteneth! the wrath of God is upon the wing against thee. both for breach
of Covenant, and wipeing thy mouth, as if thou had done nothing amiss! Thou
have stood and seen thy brothers day: Alas for thy day, when others shall stand
aloof from thee, for fear of sharing in thy judgments! O how unexamplified
must the plagues be, wherewith they shall be pursued, whose wickedness has
such a singularity of heinousness in it, on the ground of the Righteousness
and Veracity of God! The burning of a Covenant made with God, is a sin, which I
believe never had precedent or parallel; and I also believe, that the terrible
tempest of the wrath of God, falling from Heaven, and following this guilt,
shall for ever fright men, from following their steps, who for this shall be
made spectacles of his displeasure, and documents to the coming of Christ, what
a dreadful and fearful thing it is, for men, taken red-hand in this
wickedness, to fall into the hands of the living God! And as for burning the
Causes of wrath, I grant that wickedness has a perfect parallel but of a
tremenduous consequence, in ^ehojakim's practice, recorded Jer. 36.23. where
that ungodly King (of unhappy memory) upon his apprehended restitution to
freedom, and deliverie from the judgem^nt of God, pursuing him for his
wickedness, is so grated with the prophets faithfulness, as he burnt the
causes of wrath: Now let it be taken notice of, how the anger of the Lord burnt
against this bold burner: see his burial and Epitaph Ier. 22.18.19. but more
particularly, see how for this very consumating wickedness, he, and his
posterity for ever, are deprived from Crown and Scepter Ier. 36.30. 2 Chro 36.
His b^othe^ Zedekiah, it is true, was made King for a time; but he also
continued to do evil in the ^ight of the Lord, and broke the Covenant of God
(though he burnt it not) and then, the Lord sweeped that race, for these
rebellions against him, together with the throne, off the face of the earth:
thus the burning of the Causes of wrath, and the breach of God's Covenant,
brought down the fire of the wrath of God from heaven, which consumed with its
flame these, who had dared the Almighty after such a manner. As the Kingdom of
Israel was put to a period and perished, because of Hosheah his breach of
Covenant; so the Throne of Judah was riding post the last stage to ruin, when
it came to the breaking of Covenant, and burning of the causes of wrath: God
would bear with them no longer; But for adding this evil to all the other
evils they had done in his sight, he overturned that throne of iniquity, and
cast them out of his sight for ever:

But, my Friends, that which we are called to mind, in this day of our
visitation, is, seriously to recollect our thoughts, and remember, what was our
frame, in the day, when these things were carried on, and done before our eyes,
what were our fears for the work of God; what were our cares, and
solicitousnesse about the preservation of that precious interest. I judge, you
will allow me to say it to you, that it might have been expected from the West
of Scotland, in a particular manner, that they would have given some evidences,
of a peculiar concernednesse in the interest of Christ, and for the
preservation of our pure and blessed Reformation, purged from the plague of
usurping Erastianisme, and its wretched brat^ abjured Episcopacy. L^r us call
ourselves to the remembrance of our carriage, in that day: were we frighted at
the dismal appea^ances of these dangers, wherewith the work of God was
thre^tned, by i^carce^ating some of the most eminently faithful and useful
Instruments in that work? Or were we wakened out of our dream of halcyon days
of liberty, etc. when the blood of these worcester hies was shed? Where are the
evid^nces of our love and loyalty to Jesus Christ? are they extant? are they
upon record? can we say in this day, when we are as broken in the place of
dragons, and cove^ed as with the shadow of death, that we did neither deal
faintly nor falsely in ^i^ Covenant? Alas! what can we say? what should we say?
shame and confusion of face belong to u^^ a blushing silence will be a fit
expression, for a stupiditie, which we cannot sufficiently lament by words, nor
make language of: we were in that day under such an universal distraction, a^
both did presage and procure the desolations of this day: we were fooled into
such a frolic, as in th^se irreligious transports, we never remembered there
was an Interest of Christ to be seen to, or secured in the first place, till we
saw it was irrecoverably lost: And now, God is righteous, in l^shing us by
these very hands, into which we put power to destroy that, which we were bound
to have preserved, with the loss of all things, life it self not excepted. O
for the spirit of repen^ance to be poured out upon all of us that rem^in! for,
if we were weeping upon him for pardon, taking vengeance on our own inventions,
and wre^tling with him by prayer, and supplication; if we were much upon our
knees before him, when we are fallen into the hands of these, from whom we are
no able to rise up, our enemies should not stand long upon their feet, who now
trod under foot his preciou^ interests and people; for a Saint is a Hercules in
genu; that foot o^ p^ide come against us should soon slip, if the slippings of
our own feet, and backeslidings were mourn^d over.

Secondly, my dear Friends let me beseech you, without being mistaken, as if
^t l^ed to the grief of those, whom he has wounded, seriously to reflect on
your frame, and carriage afterward; and let us consider, whether we walked
mournfully before the Lord, and endeavored to make our sorrow swel to a just
proportion, with the growing desolation of the San^tuary, and the growing
defection and grievous Apostasy of the Nation from our Covenant, and solemn
Engagements to God: for, of whom and from whom might this have been exspected,
if not of us? We saw the blood of these precious Saints and Martyrs of Jesus
shed: we savv the frame of our Government dissolved and overturned: we savv
an Act res^issory (the wickedness whereof reached heaven:) we savv
abominable and abjured Episcopacy re-established by Law, and the faithful
Ministers of Christ driven from their flocks: thus we savv Jericho rebuilt;
and so the Nation became a Curse, being so deeply and so deliberatly involved
into the guilt of open, owned, avouched, and by Law established, perjurie:
Now what did we in the mean time? Alas we had not the spirit of the day in
its day! we carried not as knovving the times and what the Israel of God
ought to have done: But for all that was yet acted and done, Satan had not
driven our Apostasy from God the full length he intended; and therefore he
still drove on; and remembering well how he had been put to flee often seven
vvayes, before the flameing zeal, and holy fervor of these worthies, who had
wrestled that poor Church into a state of freedom, from an Exotic hardship,
and the base bondage of Prelacy; and how it had come to that amongst us, tha^
Jesus Christ was owned by all the Authority in the Nation, as sole and
absolute Sovereign in his own house, and how his Throne^ Crown and Scepter
had been secured unto him, and that Prerogative, only competent to the Son of
God, settled upon him by Law; which was a National Declaration, emi^ted in
the sight of the world, of this import, let him who built the house bear the
glory: Let him sit and rule upon his Throne: Satan, I say, envying that blessed
settlement, which he had found so hurtful to his Kingdom of darkness, and
which was the Crown of that poor Church, whose Reformation in this was
beyond all the Churches of Christ I know upon the earth (though now Alas! we
may take up this Lamentation over our selves, the Crown is fallen from our
head, w^e unto us, for we have sinned) to the end the mountain of Zion might
once for all be desolat, and the foxes, wi^h every beast of prey, be at liberty
to walk upon it, prompted men, h^ving once set them a going in a course of
defection, to run to such a height of opposition to the Lord's anointed, as
never since man was upon the earth, was there such a Supremacy f^amed into a
Law, whereby name and thing of all K^ngly power is plainly, and explicitly
taken from, and exto^ted out of the hand of ou^ blessed Lo^d Jesus Christ, and
g^ven unto, and settled upon the King: (O dangerous and unsetl^ng setlement!)
no^ the incommunicable Prerogative of Him, who is King in Sion and whose right
it is, to give Laws to rul^ his own Church and House, is alieanat, and
appended to the Imperial ^rown of the Nation; and it is now declared for ever,
to be its inherent right, to dispose of, and do in all Church matters, as our
King in his Royal wisdom shall think fit: The most manifest, u^m^sked, high,
and horrid usurpation of the Throne of Christ, that ever the world saw: An^ the
most down righ^ contradiction to that declared decree Psalm. 2. that ever was
framed or cast in^o the mo^ld of a Law, or emitted to the view of men. Nay, let
any m^n of judgemen^ r^ad our Supremacy and that Psalm, and he must say one of
two; that either thi^ Supre^acy is m^ant of Christ, (though his name be not in
it, as was above noted) seeing it com^rehend^ all that Church-powe^, and a^cribs
it unto some one person, without a competitor, which only belongs to him,
whose Throne is set in Zion, by an everlasting decree: for his is the Kingdom,
his is the power, and his is the glory; Or he must confes^e, that it is the
most pure, pe^fect, and unpa^alleled contradiction to that decree, that ever
the world saw: neither do I remember any thing ^o like it, in sense and sound,
as what is recorded by the Holy Ghost Is^. 14: v. 13, 14. to have been the
language of the heart of the King of Babylon: thou have said in thy heart
(says the H: Ghost) I will ascend into Heaven: I will ex^lt my Throne above
the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the Congregation, in the
sides of the North: I will ascend above the heights of the clouds: I will be
like the most high: It was certainly a very congruous and happy notion to come
into a hea^hen's head, that whosoever set^ his throne in the mount of the
Cong^egation, and sits supreme in the sides of the North, which is the City of
the great King, who has there settled his Throne, and set the Ornament of his
beauty in Majesty amongst his subjects, should also ascend above the height
o^ the clo^ds, and be like the most High; But it was an unhappie mist^ke in
him, to think he would set himself down in that Chair o^ state, and si^ upon
that Ro^al Throne: But to curb this Insolent, and to cure him of this ma^nesse,
the Lo^d s^t him some where else; and therefore it is added, with an Emphasis,
declarative of his high indignation against the pride of that petulant
Babylonian v. 15. Yet shall thou be ^rought down ^o hell to the sides of the
pit: And thus his Majesty bec^me a mocking stock, and the Nation^ are
brought-in insulting over him and singing in derision: How art thou ^allen from
H^aven, O Lucifer, etc. O its impossible he can sit long, who sets himself down
upon the Mediators Throne! for, the arm of Jehovah, shall snatch and hurrie
him thence; and h^ must catch a ^ore ^all, whom the great God throws down, in
his indignation! Be wise now therefore, O ye Kings, etc^ is a necessar caution
here.

But to my purpose: You and I saw all this perpetrat in our sight; We saw also
what ways and methods were taken to slatter or force us into some compliance
wi^h this usurpation: How did we behave, while we beheld this Idol of jealousy
and abomination set in the holy place? did our eye affect our heart, to see our
blessed Lord Jesus put to more open shame, in our land, then ever he had been
put to in the earth? to see the exalted Prince Messiah so formally divested,
and spoiled of his sole Soveraigni^i^, and tha^ b^ that very power, and
principally by these very persons, who had sworn fidelity, subjection and
loyalty to our Lord Jesus Christ as King in his own house: whose alone it is to
give laws to his Church, yea to give the Law to Kings, as Church Members, if
they have that honor to be Members of his Church^ Now, when this iniquity
reached unto heaven, were the rendings of the Cauls of our hearts heard also in
heaven, because of the heinousness of this high wickedness? did we tremble at
the thoughts of what the zeal of the Lord, for the establishment of the
Mediators throne, would do, against the Nation and Church, where this
wickedness had been done, and Christ so dealt with? What stiring up of one
another to mourn together and apart, was there, when now the glory was
departed? Were we ashamed to be seen without the tear in our eye? yea or with
our heads upon us, when the crown was taken from our Master's head? or had
we no use for them but, that they might keep^ two eyes in them, to mourn? or
did our carriage witness we were willing to lay them down, and lose them, as a
Testimony against the wrong done to our Master? Alas had we neither tears, nor
blood to bestow upon such an honorable cause and quarrel?

Let me tell you, m^ Dear Friends, that as I see cause of wondering and
weeping over my own stupiditie, who was so little affected with such a
heart-melting sight, and can attribut it to nothing, but want of a proportioned
zeal, that I did not either die of grief, or only lived by choice, to lament
the departing of the glory; so, I cannot forebeare to tell you (and now is the
proper time for you to think-on it, and be touched with it) that I beheld the
strange unconcernednesse of many amongst you, in that day, with amazement: will
you not blush to remember that the Parliament of England, though for the most
part highly Erastian, were yet so surprised at the sight of our Supremncy,
being then apprehensive of a design to introduce popery amongst them, as they
no sooner saw it, but they perceived that Scotland, by their newly molded
Supremacy, so prodigious for size and shape, had not only empowered his
Majesty for doing that, but more also; if so be, he in his royal wisdom saw it
fit? This I say, together with that Act, for having so many thousand men ready
to m^rch at his Majesty's call, into any part of his Dominions, did much
startle tha^ Parliament. But what did you in the meantime? Alas! it was
observed, particularly of not a few amongst you (I do not charge all, nay nor
any person in particular, let every on reflect^on himself) that never was
there, more graspeing after the World, never more eagerness to build your own
houses, than in that day, when before your eyes, the house of your God was
taken in possession, together with an unbrotherly unconcernednesse, in the
sufferings of such, who were most active in testifieing against ^his
wickedness, and counteracting its de^igne: And, my Friends, I must be this far
plain with you, that as with much grief of soul, I then beheld this amongst
you; so, I then said it, and often have said it and thought it since, that, for
that your carriage, in such a dismal day, when we should all have been crying,
and what will thou do for thy great name? and such a manifest leaving of your
first love, if God should bring an enemy from the riseing of the Sun, to punish
the West of Scotl^nd with a witness, they should smart, for what had been
observed amongst them, in that hour: he should so order the matter, as, escape
who would, they should not: But the Judgment of God, which begins at his own
house, should either land and light there, or lie and rest there: My Dear
Brethren, mistake not the design of this plain dealing, I dar not daub with
untempered mortar, because I would not have you dally in the m^tter of
Repentance: I may say, my record is in heaven, that I have not allowed my self,
to be at ease; since you were in trouble: Let me speak therefore to you, in
^he words of the Holy Ghost: Hear ye the rod, and who has appointed it: Learn
to understand the Language of this Dispensation, which if you do, your finger
will ce^tainly be upon this sore; and your eye toward the alone remedy; so
shall you comply with his noble Design, and bless him eternally for what has
befallen you.

But Thirdly, beloved sufferers for Christ, as a further proof, I have not
mentioned these things, on purpose you should be grieved, and have sor^ow upon
sorrow, suffer me to add. That, as I had often been made sad, by that
nnconcernednesse in the Matters of God, and in the Sufferings of your Brethren,
observed with much sorrow and regret amongst you^ unanswerable to the
Kindness of your youth, and the love of your espousals; so, I was refre^hed,
upon your behalf, and comforted to hear, that there was a begun reviveing,
for some time, observed amongst you, and that now at the last, your care of,
and concernednesse in the precious Interests of Christ, began to flourish
again; and some thing of old life and luster began to appear, before this
enemy broke-in upon you^ and that he who had been ri^eing Prosperously, in many
places of the Land, going forth conquering souls, to a compliance with the
blessed besigne of the Gospel (which is to crown the conquered) was returning,
to give you a new visit, and to make you ^avourie, as in the days of old: But
more particularly, what ever be the wickedness of men, and your innocence as
to them, that our blessed Lord Jesus has graciously condescended to take a
great Testimony at once, from his old friends and followers in the West of
Scotland: he would not put such a Discredit and Discountenance upon you^ as to
have you behind other parts of the land, in filling up that, which is behind
of the a^^lictions o^ Christ, in your sufferings for his names sake, and the
noble Interest of his crown. O now happy and honorable favorites of so
glorious a King! would you have wish^d, that the delivery of Scotland should
have gone before this your distress? And that it should have been your
reproach, that you had been last in bringing home the King, and had suffered
least for his sake? But now he has rolled away your reproach, and enrolled you
amongst the honorable company of his witnesses: O! what would you think to
hear the Mediator make such a report of you in Heaven (for his commendation
makes believers and su^ferers f^mous there) as this? Now, what was lacking of a
full and faithful Testimony, what was wanting in witnessing a good Confession,
amongst my Disciples and Friends in the West of Scotland, is supplied, with
full measure, heaped up shaken together, and running over: They have not only
given, and given cheerfully, but the very poor amongst them have given as Kings
unto God, because they have given him themselves, and their little All. O my
Friends, if you knew what report he is making of your suffering in heaven, in
stead of sincking into a despondency, you would be in hazard to be di^tracted
with joy! However, now Brethren rejoice, and now be glade, in as much as he
has coun^ed you worthy to suffer for his sake? He has set ^ crown and garland
upon your head, which is not set on the head of every one, whom he yet crowns
with loving kindness, and tender me^cies, and which is denied to many, who
will yet get the immortal crown. To you it is now given `(O blessed be the
Giver, and happy are the receivers!) not only to believe on him, but also to
suffer for his sake: To you it is given, not only to lodge him in your house,
and heart; but, because you have done so, you are honored to have your ho^ses
taken in possession by others; and your bodies, which are temples of the Goly
Ghost, trod upon and abused by such, who, while they have the faces of men,
have the fashions of Devils. But, Dear Friends, you are not so much debased
and humbled, when you lay your bodies as the mire, and as the street to those
that go over, and when men does the equivalent of rideing over your head; as
you are highly honored, and exalted: You are not so much hurt, what ever harm
they have done you^ as you are made happy. Remember whose these words are
(which contain in them a noble Cordial for you and an excellent remedy;
swallow it down, and it will both seek to the sore, and make an inward jubilee
in your soul) Blessed are they who are persecuted for righteousness sake; for
theirs is the Kingdom of heaven: Look upward you may, and Laugh: Look upward^
that you may be in case to look all your trouble out of countenance: Look
u^ward, and see who is Looking downward, and his heart in his eye, on purpose,
to take notice of all that is done to you for his sake: their very hard
speeches shall be remembered, none of your sorrows, nor sufferings escape his
observation; but he takes notice of all these, on purpose to comfort you over
them, and support you under them: many a poor man amongst you durst never have
evened himself ^o this degree and height of honor, as either to have been
drive^ out of his hut, or little hole-house, or to have been oppressed in it,
and that upon ^o noble an account, as it shall be recorded in heaven, and
reckoned, as his Testimony against the usurpation of the Mediators throne:
This is so great an honor, I ^ay, and a thing of so noble an import, as many a
poor man dar not suffer himself, to believe it for joy: He dare not allow
himself to think, that his name, who had so little to lose, will be enrolled
amongst the company of Confessors: but do not wrong his love, nor rob thy self
of the rich con^olation, he allows upon thee: For if thou have lost but a hair
^or him, if one of these have f^llen, or has been plucked from thy head, let
be thy old ble^ ^onnet, he will both reco^d it, and reward it: he will not
only remember, who have taken joyfully the spoiling of their goods; But who,
when they had nothing of their own to lose, had compassion upon them who were
spoiled, and became companions, by choice, of them who were so used: You cannot
without blushing think upon the value he will put upon your suffering: and how
(if I may say so) he will magn^fie your poor mite, which you are ashamed to
mention. Can you think, without a kind of pleasant confusion, of the warm and
wonderful welcome, you will get in the other world; when you shall be advanced
to reign with him, and hear him speak these words to you, you are they who
have continued with me in my Tentations, and I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as
my Father has appointed unto me, that you may eat and drink at my table, in my
Kingdom, and judge them, who now judge and cond^mne you: you are the poor
company, who were not ashamed to be put to shame for my ^ake; and therefore I
will not be ashamed of you; but I will confess you before my Father and before
his Angels: You are they they who have witnessed your love and loyalty to me,
and your zeal for my crown and Scepter, when your Rulers, as incensed against
me, did by their Law Un-king me, and in persecuting of you crucified me again;
come, you shall enter into my joy, you shall fit with me upon my throne, and to
the everlasting confusion of these my enemies, who would not that I should
reign over them, they shall not only see you crowned; but crowned upon the
account of what they put you to suf^er: Yea, in the day when they shall be
sisted before my tribunal, sentenced and shut out of my sight for ever, ^hey
shall have this added to make their shame unspeakeable, they shall not only
see you glorified with me, when I am set upon the throne of my glory; but
sitting also as my Assess^rs to judge these your proud persecuters, and saying
Amen to the righteousness of my sentence: All their savage severi^ies, and all
your sorrows and sufferings, will come in remembrance in that day, to be
accordingly rewarded: Not only shall you, much honored Gentlemen, who, in
testimony, that you dare not concur in this opposition to Christ, and give it
under your hand to obstruct ^he coming of his Kingdom, by subscribing such
bonds, as Tests of your Loyalti^ to men, which would bring upon your soul, the
crime of les^e Majesti^; and conclude you guil^ie of disloyalty against the
Lord's anointed, (for which noble opposition to that course of iniqu^tie, some
of you are shu^ up in prison^ others are denounced) not only shall you have
all your losses made up, by that far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory: O the eternal weight, and the infinite worth of that glory, to which, all
the sufferings of thi^ life are not worthy to be compared! O how much is the
inheritance of the saints in light, and that hope laid up for you in heaven,
above your houses and inheritances and lands, which you have ventured to lose
for him! But you Tenants also, yea the Poorest Co^tar likewise, who has
sufferred any thing for him, shall have no lower reward, than the Confessors
crown, that crown of glory, that fades ^o^ away: He will no^ only take no^ice
of all the horrid plunderings, of all the ba^barous and inhumane beatings,
woundings and unheard of insolencis, of these savage Saracens, who have been
made use of against you; But of all your sore hea^ts, of all your smothered
sighs, (for he does not hide his ear at his peoples breathing, when the ene^y
cuts o^^ their life in ^he dungeon, and casts a stone upon them) of all your
overwhelming greifs, and tears shed, not so much beca^se that the enemy had
entered unto your houses, and ^aten up your bread; as because they had robb^d
you of the Gospel, caused your solemn and sweee^ as^embl^es to cease, and did
not suf^er your bread for your soul to come into the house of the Lo^d: For
though the ^o^d had given you the bread of adversity, and the water of
af^liction; yet, if the ^ospel had been left you, if your teachers had not been
removed into corners, if your eyes had seen these, and if you did still hear
the joyful found, and had acces^e to be made glade in his house of prayer, it
would have comforted you, over all these things you have suffered: But it is
for being robbed of the bread of life you weep, the desolation of the mountain
of Zion makes your eyes dim: And will he hold his peace at such tears? will he
not hear the voice of such weeping? nay all your wanderings are marked, and
all your tears, if there were but one that had trickled down from your eye,
as well as your blood is regairded: Thou tellest my wandering, (said that
persecuted man) thou putest my tears (the word is my tear, to show, that not
one drop falls by; and that if it were but one, it is kept and well kept)
in thy bottle: he does in great tenderness toward you, keep all the tears
you weep in his bottle, that in due time, he may pour them out to you, in the
wine of strong consolation. His eye has seen, who have been made to suffer
these things from the enemies of humanity, as well as Christianity, which I
forbear to mention by their proper names, as not knowing (if I should) how to
comfort those, who have suffered such things, leaving that to him who can, and
who will. He has taken notice of all the thefts committed amongst you, the
least brat of old cloths, that has been stolen from you, or stripped off you,
has not escaped his observation; this is marked by him, and marked on purpose,
that he may in place thereof cloth you with rich and glorious robs, and class
you in that beautiful company Rev. 7. of whom it is said, these are they who
came out of great tribulation etc. You are now Princes in Pilg^ims weeds,
because, under your rags, lies hide a tittle to the glorious crown; but in that
day your rags will be taken away, and you will appear illustrious Princes
indeed: nay the beatings, yea, outrageous boastings, and threatenings of the
poorest Lad or Less, shall not be forgotten, it had been better for them who
gave the orders, and put them in execution, that a milston had been hanged
about their neck, and they cast into the midst of the Sea; than thus to have
handled one of his little ones, upon such an account: nay, the weeping of poor
little Children, for want of food (while the mothers milk was dried up, or was
as poison) their pale faces, pat^ly with fear, partly with famine, shall be
remembered, as a part of your ^estimonie, and that which shall certainly fill up
the cup of these Amorites.

But what should I say? Beloved Sufferers, right honorable Nobles, (if any of
your names be found in that roll, ^d found out of the roll of the Banders, for
now, it is not many noble, and the more the shame, and pity; but if there be
but one o^ two of that tribe, the more noble) much honored and happi^
Gentlem^n, who to m^k^ it appear you have first given your own selves unto the
Lord, would not prig with him, a^out your hou^es, your inheritances, nor your
lands; but carried as at a point to part with h^s thing for him, which you had
received from him, as having but little pleasure to be poss^ssed of any thing,
after he was dispossessed by law of his house, and heritage; [o wicked and
vain attempt! their hands shall not be able to perform their interprise, but
the counsel of these frowards, who will wrestle with him, to wring the scepter
out of his hand, shall be carried head long: Has he said it, And will he not
do it? has he purposed it, and shall it not come to pass?] And you Tennants,
who are turned out of all, and put in the condition of beggars (O rich and to
be ambition at beggarie!) yea you poor Laborers and Servants, who have parted
with your all; and it may be, you thought it to little. (For when love to
Christ gives, it is so liberal and open handed, as it gives all: It first gives
the heart to him, and then the house and goods for him, and has a kind of
sorrow it has no more to give; and therefore at last, to fill up the measure
the giver throws in himself, and that with a blush, to be made use of in doing
and suffering for God) and therefore did it, with a kind of sh^me, and
regrete, you had no more to lose for him: be assured, he will not forget this
your wo^k and labor of love, shevved for his names sake: nay, be assured, he
will repay it with an inconceivable overplus of everlasting advantage: Fear
not, little flock it is the Fathers good pleasure, to give you the Kingdom, are
the words of your Lord and Master: O! how great is your revvard in heaven! it
exceeds both your faith and your fancy, both your imagination and expectation,
in the dimensions of infinite goodness, and eternal endureance! O! how great
is that Goodness; which he has laid up for you, (where thieves cannot break
through nor steal; nay, it is above the rage of men or loose handed devils to
reach it) who now have been helped to give such a proof, that he, who alone is
to be feared, is your fear and your dread; and which he has wrought for you,
who have witness^d before the sons of Men, that you can follow him, whither
soever he goes, and that where the King is there will you be, whether in Life
or in Death, and trust him with all your concerns, when exposed to the worst
that the violence of the vilest of men can make you suffer. What should I say?
He has pronounced you blessed, who makes you so, amidst all your miseries; and
therefore blessed you must be, and shall be; so that you have no more to say,
but be it unto thy suffering servants according to thy word; neither have I,
but Amen and Amen.

Now, Dear Brethren, though your not having keep, as became you, the Word of
his Patience has provoked him, not to keep you from this hour of Temptation,
which is come upon you; yet, how has he both multiplied to pardon, and
magnified his grace, even while he punished, in keeping you in it? And as the
observation of your former way occasioned great fears on your behalf, lest
there should have been a further defection; so, when it was seen and p^t beyond
all debate (though no man would suffer himself to believe, that ever such a
thing, which had no color of reason to cover the barbaritie of it is rage,
would be put in execution; lest an easy credulity of what was not to be
believed, till rage had quite extinguished reason, should have argued a
weakness unworthie of a man: For to have said they are men, who Rule, though
stated enemies to the ways of God, might have secured a person against the
fears of such a course) that this evil was determined against you, wherein
Religion and Reason had the defiance at once, in the resolution of your ruins:
I judge, there were never more payers put up to God, on the behalf of a party
in the land, then there were for you, that you might be keept in this hour of
temptation, and strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power,
and helped without fearing the wrath of those, whose fury was armed with all
the force of the Nation, and to be execute by the most formidable and barbarous
Instruments, to stand it out, and to endure as seeing him who is invisible. And
now, in that God has not turned away these prayers, nor his mercy from you:
But has stood by you, helped you, held your hand, with held you from that Bond
of disloyalty to Christ, strengthened you, and keept you from the snare laid
for you, and this grin of these workers of iniquity: for this gift, I say,
bestowed upon you, by the means of many persons, thanks also are given unto
God, by many, on your behalf: And this abundance of heart-establishing, and
hand-strengthening Grace, bestowed upon you, by the thanksgiveings of many,
redounds to the Glory of God: Dear Bre^hren, you are now in a manner become
our joy and crown: This eminent exercise of your faith and patience, in that,
while cr^shed by these cruel men, you have carried, as not being moved by any
of these things, which have be fallen you; but as knowing you are appointed
thereun^o has comforted your Brethren over you, in all your a^^liction and
distress: And your stand^ng fast in the Lord, has put many, who stood in
doubt of you, lest the temper by this means should have tempted you, and turned
you aside to a compliance with the crooked ways of these workers of iniquity,
who shall be led forth with all that ^oine with them, to condign punishment,
(but what that shall be is unutterable:) hereby, I say, your friends, the
favou^ers of the dust of Zion, are put to a new di^^icultie on your behalf;
for his doing for you, above what they could ask or think: now, this is the
Echo of their pulse: O what thanks, can we render again to God for these, who
ha^^ been thus helped to glorify him, by standing and withstanding in this
evil day! and for all the joy, where with we joy for their sakes, before ou^
God: Yea, what gladness, what glorying is there amongst the saints for your
patience, and fai^h^ in all your persecutions, and tribulations that you endure?

But now, Dear Brethren, to the end that you may hold on, and hold out, and so
be more than conquerours, through him that has loved you, let me put you in
mind you have not yet done, although you have been helped to do much, by
suffering much; yet, there is a much behind to be done, and suffered: Having
therefore taken joyfully the spoiling of your goods, and carried as knowing in
your selves, that in heaven, you have a better and an enduring substance. Now
consider, that you have yet need of patience; for you see, that the enemies
teeth i^ hereby set on edge to tear you, they are still eager in the pursuit:
There is need of patience, I say therefore, that after you have done the will
of God (which has been by a suffering of his will in this juncture) you may
receive the promise. Now take unto you the whole armor of God, that you may be
able, having done all these noble things, to stand: Stand therefore, as
resolved through grace, and in the power of his might, to keep your ground, and
to withstand, that you lose not the things, which you have wrought, and let not
go a victory so near gained. Read over R^v. 12. and see, how that after Michael
and his Angels have encountered the Dragon and his blake Legions (and I must
say, however these who marched against you were called, a glorious host, I
doubt, if ever there were legions, who more completely were clothed in Satan's
livery, and it was very suitable, since there was never a company of men
gathered together, since man was upon the earth, wherein the quarrel was so
formally stated against the Prince Michael) and have overcome by the blood of
the lamb, etc. A victory, in kind and qualit^^, much like yours: Now take
notice, that the Devil thus cast down, even while he casts them down, that with
stood him; and thus defeat in the death of those, who loved not their lives
unto the death, studies a revenge, and comes down having great wrath: Be su^e
therefore, he will endeavor to be avenged upon you, for the broken head got,
at this bout: He will make war upon you, and manage it with all the fo^ce and
^urie he can, yea wi^h all the fraud and Hellish S^ratagems (whereof yet I am
most afraid) against that remnant^ by whose keeping the commandment of God, and
holding fast the Testimony of Jesus Christ, he finds himself cast down. He has
had great wrath, against a poor feeble company, these many years, by whom,
after he had hurried all the Representatives of the Nation, into this di^ch of
dread^ul Defection, and A^ostasie and carried them the length, of that
heaven-daring act of Supremacy, he found him^e^f resisted: all the homage he
got by this Apostasy did avail him nothing, so long: as these base-l^ke and
beggarly Mordecaies did not only not bow the knee to him; but resisted him,
and wi^hstood him; and by their running to and fro, he found the knowledge of
God (hi^ great eyesore) increased, his old nests herried, his ordinary haunts
invaded, and these da^ke De^s, wherein he had dwelt without disturbance, taken
in ^ossession; and his old servants and slave^ vindicat into the glorious
liberty of the Sons of God. Seeing himself at such a loss, and that by a
company of un doughts, as they are judged; yea nothings (the fittest things for
this opposed Christ to work by, and the fittest ^ime too; for by his reigning
and conquering thus, and by these noble and notable inroads he makes upon
Satan's ^erritories, he proves himself the Captain of Salvation, and that King
who is in Zion, against whom there is no rising up, against whom there is
neither counsel nor strength, and so no prevailing; however exautorat by ou^
Law, and that Law put in execution by all the methods and strength, that they
who f^amed the Law can enforce it by) he is more incensed: And as to you, my
Dear Friends o^ the Went o^ Scotland more particula^ly, suffer me to say, That
he seems to have devised that this storm should have first fallen upon you,
not only because of old Long-syne; But, as ho^ing, that now, after so much
ease you have had, while others were in trouble, and some rema^kable abatemen
of that zeal, which sometime was observed to be amongst you, (O let never such
a sight be again seen^) he would find you unprepared to stand it out, and
withstand such a furious assault; and so, by your fainting and being ^oiled, he
expected, that all the rest of your brethren should have been either frighted
into the like compliances, with this course of defection, and have been made to
couch as Asses between the burdens; or their resistance, when relinqu^shed by
you, to be but feeble at best, and at last such as would end in their own
ruin. But now, being so far disappointed, in finding that you have been
helped, not with a little help, but with a great help; and that you have been
enabl^d through Grace, to shake your selves, as at other times; and that the
Lord has stood by you, while ^uch a Lion was let loose upon you; and has
strengthened you, and helped you, ^o aquite your selves, in this conflict, as
the good Soldiers of Jesus Christ, he has now more wrath against you, than
ever: How does he now meditat revenge? How does he now grin and gnash his teeth
upon you? when having stretched out his hand against you, as nothing doubting
of the victory, he finds himself foiled, and made to draw in a stump. You may
expect then, to meet with all that the Gates of hell can do to u^do you:
therefore, be upon your guard: you may expect to be attacqued upon all
quarters, now battered with fury, then underminded b^ fraud, Be sober
therefore, be v^gilant, for this roaring Lion is walking about, seeking how he
may devour you: whom resist steadfast in the faith: and to the end he may get no
advantage against you, see that you carry as not ignorant of his devices,
beware of his wiles, beware of his smoothness; for when he speaks you
fairest, then there are seven abominati^ns in his heart: Be sure where ever you
watch, or what ever you do, to double your gairds at this pass; for it may be,
you shall be yet assaulted at this post^ and be in greatest hazard, to be put
out of your posture by his smooth insinuations: And in order to your
resistance, and standing it out^ both against the wiles of the Divil, and
against his open wrath, let me drop these things, and bring them to your mind.

First, Let me beseech you to consid^r, what your treasure is, and see to the
securing of that, in the right ^and and the right place: for if that be safe,
an^ well laid up, all is well: you may then su^fer and sing, we will not fear
what flesh in do unto us I need not t^ll you that your treasure is your
precious and immortal so^^ and that you have nothing wo^th keeping, nay,
n^thing that is truly tenable, or that can be keep't, but that, for it is
Christ's own account, who knew the worth of souls, what has a man profited
says he, if he should gain the whole world and lose his own soul? and the
words added, or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? are resolveable
in this other question, wh^^^ ha^h a man lost, if he should lose the whole
world, and save his own s^ul? O what can be gain, where ^he ^ainer is
eternally lost? or what can be loss, where the loser is saved, and for ever
made up! Nor need I tell you, that it is for this precious treasure, that loose
handed Devils ^unt; and to the end your enemy may get hold of this, and run
away with it, he hou^ds^out such emissaries, as you have had to deal with,
that you may be hurried, by their ho^rid savagenesse, into a solicitousnesse,
how to preserve some things out of their grips, till he run away with his prey,
while you are noised into an oblivion of your g^ea^ Interest. Nor need I te^l
you, that the alone way to secure this your treasure, is, to commit the keeping
of it to Jesus Christ: for when it is in his hand and custody it i^ so sure,
as no man, no Devil, can pluck it out; for he is stronger then all: Ye see that
in a day of fiery trial, and when judgment must begin at the House of God, and
when there is a must be of suff^ring according to his will for all that would
do his will, this is the happy advice given, and alone expedient that will
answer the end propounded 1 Pet. 4. last, wherefore (says he) let them who
suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their soul to him in
well-doi^g, i. e. in doing these very thin^s, for which they suffer all these
evils of affliction; for that is particularly the present well doing according
to his will, and so often as the doing of his will may infer danger, let this
act of commiting the soul to him be renewed^ that so his will may only be done,
and his way keept, with a holy undauntednesse of courage, in the day of most
desperate danger O! bu^ the soul is safe that is committed unto him: we cannot
pos^esse our souls in patie^ce^ while we keep them in our own possession in
such a day^ because, we cannot secure them; but then are they truly our own,
when we have given them away to him to keep^ and we may then possess them in
patience, when they are in his possession; this made the Apostle 2 Timothy 1.12.
enjoy a sweet serenitie in a very stormy day, the persuasion of His being
faithful to his trust, and able to keep that, which he had committed unto him,
fo^^ified his soul against all fear of what could befall him, in following the
Lord, and hardened him, into a holy misregaird and contempt of the shame of the
Cross. Therefore^ dear Brethren, let this be the greatest have with you, and
the first have too; for he will do nothing ^or a man, nor undertake to concern
h^mself in him, or his affairs, till he have committed his soul to hi^ in the
first place: And when you have done this, and to the end you may in this
warfare attend upon the Lord without distraction, commit all beside to him,
that you would have safe: if a man love any thing, then the only way to keep
it, from being lost, is to put it into his hand; for he not only keeps all
their bones, who entrust him with their persons, that none of them are broken;
(when he intends not a greater good to them by the contrare) but the very hairs
of their head are numbe^ed, and not one of them can be touched, or fall to the
ground without him. Therefore having trusted him with your soul, which is your
treasure, trust him with all your other little ^ri^^les too: He will take it
ill, if you do other wise: And if it be good for you, to have these preserved,
he will keep them, even to your old shoes: the Angel will not let P^^er lose
his Sandals, or leave them behind him, in the prison: Put your wives, your
children, your estats, your names, and reputation, yea, whatsoever is dear
un^o you, in his hand; and all is safe. O but that person may be secure, ami^st
the b^i^te^ous blasts of affliction, and the tempestuous rowlings of the raging
seas of trouble, whose person and estate is insured in the insureance chamber
of heaven? Sure, he who has com^^tt^d all to him may slee^ sweetly, (because
he is safe) amidst all dangers; since the peace of God (flowing from, and
fol^owing such a commitment) which passet^ all understanding, gaird^ the h^^^t
and mind, through Christ jesus. Secondl^, when you have thus committed all ^o^
would have to his keeping, to the end, you may keep his way, when assault^d by
Adver^aries, and carry with that Gallantry, which becomes the Sou^diers of the
Captain of Salvation^ make use of your allowed strength and furniture: For you
are no^ called to this wa^fa^e on your own ch^rges: The King bears all the
cost; so that you have a bro^d board to take a sufficiency of supply for all
wants and weakness off: and the^efo^e you are not so much to consider what you
have or want in your selves, in o^der to you^ t^orow bear^ng, and what you can
do or endure, in order to the obtaining of the vict^^y; ^s what he will ^e ^o
^ou, in that hour, and do for you; and accordin^ to this re^ko^ing you may say,
when we are weak th^n are we strong: And when we can do not^ing, ye^ we can do
all things, and endure all things, through Christ stre^gthening, or putting
power in us: and we may reckon also upon the victory; you even you, little
ones, have overcome them, (sa^^h he) b^c^u^e s^ronger is he tha^ is in you,
then he that i^ in the world: Be stron^ ther^fo^e in the Lord and in the power
of his might: Lay in store of suffering Graces, put on the whole Armor of God
(says the Apos^le) that you may be able to stand: he has prepared that Armor
for you, and it is proof, and he orders you to put it on, and t^e^efore he
doubles the exhor^ation, take unto you therefor the whole armor of God, that
you m^^ be able t^ st^^d i^ the evil day, and having done all to stand. I shall
not insist on the particulars; but leave that known place Ephesians. 6. to your
meditation: Only see well to these three C^r^in^^ G^aces as ever you would
look for the Conquerours Crown: first, See well to ^our Faith^ a^o^e a^l (says
he) taking the shield of Faith: I cannot here hint the universal usefulne^^e of
faith, in th^s wa^f^re; nor how it st^^ls the soul with so much stoutnesse; as
it can m^ke a person look the very King of terrors out of countenance, with a
fearlesse mis^e^a^rd: In God I have pu^ m^ trust (said that holy Man, in a very
des^erat danger; and then he adds) I will not fe^re what flesh can do unto me
Faith not only sees that, through all dark and di^mal appearances, which is of
infinite value above all sufferings; but, as it interesteth the ^oul in that
great goo^nesse, it prompts with a holy fortitude, and with a peremptorinesse
of resolution and courage forces its passage, in order to possession, through
Devils, Dangers, and Death i^ ^elf: But consider particularly, how faith is a
shield, that you may use it as such, (O bles^ed be He eternally, though your
ene^ies can take your, old rusty swords, they cannot spoil you of ^our faith,
and ^o they cannot conquer you: For this is the victory whereby you over come
the world, even your faith!) Now faith is a shield, and a shield of salvation,
because it interposeth God and his omnipotent power to protect, betwixt the man
and all that oppose him^ and whatsoever would hurt him: When David is put to
flee from the face of ungodly Saul and his Court Grandees, and hides himself in
the Cave P^. 57:1. -- my soul trusts in thee (says he) yea in the shadow of
thy wings will I make my refuge, till these calamities be overpast. O when
there is nothing standing up between God and the soul, and God stands up
between it and all that would harm it, but the man is safe! This blessed
shield, it both bears the man who bears it, and it beats back all the blows
of adversaries, so as by a rebound their sword enters into their own heart: He
knew of what use this was to a soul, who said -- I have prayed that thy faith
fa^l no^: And the person to whom this was said, having got a dangerous fall,
and having been shamefully foiled, through the failing of his faith, yet being
by grace recovered, gives this advice to ^^e^e who ^ould stand, when the devil
is assaulting them on all hands: 1 Pet. 5:8, 9. whom r^sist sted^ast in the
faith: And when he is thus resisted^ he flees: he sees, its in vain to t^r^w
his fiery da^ts at him, who can make use of this shield: hold up thy shield,
and Satan cannon hold up his face; but will flee: why? because, as God has in
mercy and love engaged himself to the soul^ to stand by it, and with his
omnipotent strength support it in the evil day; so faith lays hold on his
promise, and takes him at his word; and thus interposeth an omnipotent God,
betwixt it and all enemies, and then he stretches out his right hand against
the wrath of an en^aged enemy^ hence amongst the rest of the great things
a^cribed to faith Heb. 11. these are not the least v. 33, 34. Who through faith
subdued Kingdoms -- stopped the mouths of lions, quenched the violence of
fire, escaped the edge of the sword, ou^ of weakenes^^ were made strong, waxtd
v^liant in fight: turned to flight the Armies of the Aliens: in a word, he that
makes use of thi^ shield is safe, and completely sheltered, with the saving
strength of the right hand of an omnipotent Go^: and shall be made to sing,
when all his enemies, that compassed him about as bees, buzing and burning in
their hatred, are quenched, as the fire of thorns; the right hand of the Lord
has done valiantly, the right hand of the Lord is exalted, the right hand of
the Lord has done valiantly. O what a complete security is this shield, in an
ill day; and therefore, when the Apostle was solicitous about the
Th^ssalonians, at a time, when their Adversaries dealt with them, as men of the
same Spirit, and malice, deal with you, he says 1 Thessalonians. 3:5. ^or this cause
when I could for^eare no longer, I sent to know your faith: Importing, that all
would be well, and they would be victors, if that was well. Secondly, see well
to faith's companion, and that is Love; this is faiths second: or the way how
faith engages and goes to action^ is by affection: O Love is a great Champion!
It will not be boasted or bu^^e^^ed into a base deserting of the beloved, by
what all the power on the earth, in a conjunction with the gates of hell can
do: It has said it, and sworn it, where ever Jesus Christ is, there will I
be, whither in life or in death: And Satan is so wise as not to assault a soul
in it is warm fits, knowing well, that many waters of affliction cannot quench
that flame; but resistance will make love the more fervent, and the Lover the
more fervid and forward; and therefore, to the end he may prevail, his metho^
is, how to make souls first lukewarm, by stealing away the fuel, whereby
that holy fire is fed; or by his slight, turning the current of the affections
that they may ^un in another channel, than Godward and Christ-ward and
heavenward: as knowing well how poor and pusilanimous crea^ures they quickly
become; when their coal is cooled o^ quenched, and how easily they are
overcome and foiled, when they fall from first love: O my Brethren, see to get
and keep your hearts warm, work hard in gathering fuel for loves fire. O how
much is it of the concernement of every Saint, to have fire burning in his
bosom, in this day, when the fire of fiery trials is burning abroad, and about
him; when enemies are in rage, and hell hot, this flame of God, this holy Love,
burning heaven-hot, will afford the soul true courage to resist that rage,
whereby they assault and are acted. And to this purpose, it is remarkable, that
the Apostle Jude, having written his Epistle for this end alone, to excite to
an earnest contending ^or the faith; In order to a readiness and resolutnesse
to undertake this heavy work of holy contention, he only exhorts to this one
for all v. 21. Keep your ^elves (says he) in the love of God: It is is true,
he mentions faith in the foregoing verse, but it is as relating to this love,
and as that which furnishes fuel to its fire: And he speaks of prayer in the
Holy Ghost also, as that, which blows away the ashes, and blow^s up that fire
into a holy flame: And then he subjoines hope, as that, which poures oil upon
the fire, and makes the soul ^horowly candent. And this leads me in the Third
place, to say, See to your hope also: When ever you get an allarm, or are
called to the conflict, call ^or your helmet, and clap it on your h^ad, and
claspe it well, and so, the head being gairded, the heart is much without
fear: while love to Christ makes a man venture upon swiming through the salt
sea, in following of him: And faith is his skill in svvimeing, and the strength
of his arms; so, when the waters go over his head, hope is the Cork that
keeps his head above, till he swime safe to the other shore, and through all the
seas betwixt him and heaven. And therefore, the Psalmist, perceiving himself
ready to sink, says, why art thou cast down o my Soul? hope thou in God, etc.
O how well will this helmet of lively hope guard the head, against all the
da^ts shot from the fury of enraged Adversaries, and likewise against all
their fraud and flattery (for these are the two deadly enemies hope has to
deal with) by raiseing the soul into a contemp^ of what the world can offer,
from the noble and none such expectation it has laid up in heaven! Nay, this
Grace is of so much use to the saints as the Apostle says, we are saved by
hope: Now therefore make use of your hope, yea, hold fast the re^oycing thereof
firm unto the end, and it shall prove to you a helmet of Salvation indeed:
It Is exercise is, to raise up the desponding soul above all dark and dismal
appearances, and to strengthen faith; and therefore we are said, in hope to
believe against hope.
Now, Dear Friends, having interjected these few things of many, with a
necessitat briefnesse, and blunt abruptness: Let me return, to where I left:
Viz. Resolve for suffering and fear none of these things which you shall, or
can suffer: only fear to offend your God, and grieve your blessed guide:
only fear that fearful and great name, which these men, who would put you in
fear, have taken in vain: fear God, and then you need fear nothing else: For
he, even he alone is to be feared: You may be bold as lions, whose blessedness
is both heightn^d and hastened by the worst the world can do unto you, because
you fear him: Let that bl^ssed fear of God gaird you against that base fear
of man, which even brings a snare: Oh the want of this which has been
amongst us, has rendered us unfit for this holy war, wherein we should have
played the men, for our God, and the glorious Concerns of his Crown and
Kingdom! O when will our heart some hardy and resolute putting ^ to our hand
to his work, in the face of the greatest hazard, prove, that he has put his
fear in our hearts? for this fear not only ^urnisheth with reason against
the fear of frail fecklesse man, ^ho cannot when he has done what he can
reach his hand beyond the Grave: And therefore our blessed Lord Jesus Christ,
a^gueing his Disciples, whom he sent out to Preach the Gospel, into an holy
courage, when persecute by the rage of Kings and Councels for Preaching (which
is this day our case: O when will he shorten these days for the elects sake?)
he does it by this argument Mat. 10:28. and Luke 12.4. -- B^ not afraid of them
that kill the body and after that, have no more that they can do: (O blessed
be he for that cannot; and for this also that these upright ones, whom they for
this persecute, shall have Dominion over their persecuters in the morning!) But
I will forewarne you whom you shall fear, fear him, which after he has
killed, has power to cast into hell. Yea I say, unto you fear him: But as it
furnished with reasons, it fortifieth also, with rich and refreshing supplies:
For it has the goodness of God as well as the greatness of his terrible
Majesty, for its object: and hereby is the heart emboldened, and the hand
strengthened to struggle with whatsoever di^^iculties and danger: Now
therefore, My Friends, to make it appear, that God in making you new
Creatures, has made you men of other metal, and Spirit, then the men of the
world and cast you into an other mould; whereas their transgressions say
plainly with in the heart of every man (who has not the heart of a bea^t)
that there is no fear of God before their eyes; so, let your fear of him, and
your fear because of that to comply with their wicked laws, which they have
made, make it appear, you have set the Lord always before you: Let what ever
you do or say, when called to a compliance with the present course of
iniquity, have this plain import, and practical sense, how can we do this
great evil, and sin against God? He is a great God, and he is a good God, and
he is our God, and therefore we dare not, we cannot, we will not offend him, to
please our persecuters.

But, Dear Friends, what have you to fear in following him? give it a name if
you can, that the names of sweetness, and salvation, which are in him (and as
his name is, so is he) answering the name of what ever you have to fear, may
make it a nothing; or if it be any thing, such a thing, as he changes its very
nature and quality, and makes pay the toll and tribute of good to you. Do you
fear, they will lash you with their tongues, which are as arrows shot out,
and load you with reproaches? Remember then, whose words these are: if you be
reproached for the name of Christ, h^ppie are you: you may not only despise
this shame, but wear it as your crown, and humbly b^^ast of such a cognizance
of your love and loyalty to Christ: because the reason, adduced by the Holy
Ghost, does put the happiness of such beyond debate: for, says he, the spirit
of Glory and of God rests upon you: as the spirit of Satan and of shame
rage^h in these reproachers; s^ the Spirit of Glory and of God rests upon
you. Are you afraid that b^sid^s ^hese lashings you shall also be put to lose,
for his sake? But why are you afraid of an ^f an impossi^ilitie? If God h^th
said it cannot be, it shall not be: why do you give it a being in your
im^gination to to^ment your selves? or why are you not rather afraid, to lose
the hundred fold in this life, even with persecution, and then that eternal
life, and that immortal crown, which is ^nsured, by the unfailing faithfulness
of God, to such losers (^f I may abuse langu^ge, in cal^ling so great gainers,
losers) in the other life? for if you s^ffer with him y^u shall reign with
him: what; will you be frighted out of the way, because of ^he manifold
temptations, and troubles you are exposed unto, by kee^ing of it? No: let t^is
fortify against that frighting fear, that as you are partakers of the
su^^ering, so shall you be of the con^olation: you ought rather to fear, to
rob and deprive your selves, in a day, when such favors are a dealing, of that
ground of rejoicing, that a pa^ticipation of the sufferings of Christ affords:
O happy and blessed pa^ticipants of his sufferings! for, when his glory shall
be revealed, you also shall be made glade with exceeding ^oy: O how cordial! O
how corroborating is such an expectation? it will m^ke the expectant rejoice,
with ^oy unspe^k^ble and full of Glory: this is heaven (in all the he^ls of
trouble, on this side of heaven) antidated: for, this is to be pa^takers
already (as the Apostle'^ phrase is) of the glory to be revealed. Do you fear
su^^ering, for that very cause, which he h^^h no^ only so often owned; but for
owning of which, your blessed Lord and Master died, as a M^rtyr? Or are you not
rather afraid, (I hope you are) that when Jesus Christ shall come to judgment,
and sit on the Throne of his Glory, and bring forth Scotland's Covenant made
wi^h him, to be ^ound amongst those, whose sentence is sealed under their own
hand; for their sin is open, and gone before hand to judgment? O dreadful may
the expect^tion of the hearts of every man of them be, in that day, who have
had hand in tha^ heinous wickedness, when the Act rescissorie shall be brought
forth, and laid besides that Covenant; and the question put to these pannels,
trembling before the Tribunal of Christ; is this the performance of ^our Oaths,
Vows, and Covenant-engagements to me? are you not afraid in that day to be
classed (if but for the least compliance) amongst t^ose, who shall be found
guilty of L^sae-Majestie against the Son of God? against him, who then shall
judge them? will there be a soul at that appearance, who dare avouch his having
had a hand, in framing such a mische^fe as our Supremacy into a Law? or would
it not rather be terrible to you, to think, that living in such a time, you
should not have witnessed against these high and heinous wickednesses? Would
you want the share of the commendation, and the glorious reward, that shall be
given his witnesses? What if you should weep, yea and die in prisons? Besides,
that there you may enjoy the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, and be
feasted in your fetters, with the fruition of himself, and have your dark
dungeons hung (if I may say so) with the very Arras of heaven, which is the
presence of God, that can make these nastie and noisome holes, wherein you are
as buried alive, preferable in^ompa^ably to all the Palaces of those, who
persecute you. O there is no comparison! ^esides this, I say which is the
hundred fold ten thousand times told, out of these your prisons, you shall be
brought to reign, and have all your tears wiped away, and your prison rags
taken off, and your rich robs, wherein for ever you shall reign, put on. Nay,
what if you should be slain for the word of God, and put to swime in to
eternity, in a sea of your own blood; what have you to fear? Though I walk
through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no ill, (says the
Psalmist) for thou art with me O the presence of God with you, in that hour,
will make it a sweet and short passage! would you not rather choice (if you
durst make a choice) to enter eternity, at this passage, and go, and take up
your place, amongst the souls of your brethren under the Altar, there to cry
with them, How long, O Lord God holy and true, etc. than, to be found, in the
crowd and company of these Kings, Captains, and Councillors, etc. who shall be
made to cry to the mountains, and to the rocks, to fall on them, and hide them,
from the face of him that sits upon the Throne, and from the wrath of the
Lamb? O the wrath of the Lamb, in that day, falling upon those his now stated,
and stout-hearted enemies, will make them change their note! The haughty
mockers at the prerogative of this exalted Prince Jesus, who then shall judge
these jesters, the menacer^ of his Subjects, and the persecuters of his Saints,
for not complying with their God-dishonouring, Christ-dethroning courses, and
contrivances, shall then know what it is, to have lif^ed up their head against
heaven, and their heel against his poor people, whom they trod under foot! O
the yelloch, that will be amongst Kings, and Captains, and Counselors, when
he shall speak to them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure, for
having said (and essayed it too) let us burst their b^nds asunder, etc.

I shall not here trouble you, with the observation of the tremenduous
^udgements of God, whereby some, that have been active in these cursed courses,
have been hurried out of the world; nor with an account of the anguish and
agonies, under which others of them, have died; nor yet of the ra^e
Testimonies, which some, who obtained mercy and grace to repent, gave against
this wicked course, wherein they had concurred, and for that cause, which they
had persecuted: though he, who regairds not these works of the Lord, nor
considers these operations of his hand, has and bewrays sad symptoms of
blindness and obduration: neither shall I here further then hint, to the end
you may, for your establishment, take notie^ of it, how wickedness has
abounded amongst, and had a dominion over those, who have broken his Covenant:
As if, all former restraints being taken off, he had said, henceforth my spirit
shall no more strive with them: for, Alas iniquity of all sorts ha^h so
abounded^ since the Nations enacted revolt from God; as the way of the
generality (O that they, whose feet go down to death, and whose steps take
hold on hell, may consider it, and be reclaimed!) if the word of the Lord be
true, that without holiness^ no man shall see the Lord; and that heaven is such
a place, as there shall in no wise enter therein any thing that defiles,
neither whosoever works abomination etc. has everlasting seclusion from the
presence of his glory, written on it; so that he who would be saved, must save
himself from this generation, who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the
frowardness of the wicked. Since we broke our Covenant made with God, binding
us to nothing, but an abiding with him, and walking before him, in our
respective capacities; Satan has got leave, to open very sluice of hell, and
drown Brittan with such a deludge of profanitie, that the multitude (yea and
they who are chief in these rebellions against God, are chief in all these
other provocations) are carried down the current, swiming, and singing, in this
impure pudle of all impiety against God, never considering, that this stream
will at last sweep them down, and swallow them up, in the lake of fire and
brimston: All these put together may make you fear, to fall in with their way,
le^t you fall with them, in the hands of the living God. If they cannot give
you security against this, and that is impossible; for the redemption of their
own soul must cease for ever, if they both cease not to go on, and sorrow not
for what they have done: Fear you not therefore their fear; only fear to
forsake God, as you would not be forsaken of him: Nay, let your fortitude in
refusing their bl^ke ^onds, whereby, as the binder binds himself to an
opposition to Christ, and the coming of his Kingd^me; so (...) binds over
himself to the curse of a broken Covenant, either fright them, into a
forbearance, or put them under the dreadful apprehensions of what they may
expect, for opposing his Christ, persecuting the Gospel, and using his servants
so, who dare not, in running with them to these excesses of wickedness, run
upon the bosses of the Almighty his backler; but rather did choice to suffer
any thing, that they might be found upright and innocent from these great
transgressions, and so escape that w^^th of the living God, wh^rewith all the
contrivers, all the pressers of these bonds of iniquity, all the persecuters
for not complying with that decreed wickedness, all the pleaders for it, all
the pal^iaters of this impiety, all the Instruments made use of to help
foreward the affliction of his poor people, for their refusal, all the
rejoycers at his peoples calamity, and connivers at these courses; yea, and
all who according to their place, station, and as they are called, do not
faithfully witness against this course of iniquity, shall be certainly
pursued, if repentance prevent it not, overtaken, and so perish eternally:
there is no Law-borrowes against the written vengeance, for the persons of
these practices.

But, that which I would more particularly point at, to forti^ie your hearts
against the fear of what you may be put to suffer, even though it should come
to the laying down of your lives, is, the refreshful and reviving remembrance
of his great goodness to them, who went before you: you need not, in order to
your establishment, run so far backward as to the records and experiences of
former generations; but I may say, as you have heard, so have you seen, in the
Ci^ie of our God: Call to remembrance what you have been witnesses to, what not
a few of you have seen with joy, and all of you have heard with gladness; yea,
your enemies have beheld it with confusion of ^ace, shame, grief, and
astonishment: to wit, that singular heart solacing and shining presence of God,
under which these your martyred Brethren were, at their death. It was evident,
he did not so much leave them, into the hands of them who hated them, to take
away their lives; as, because he was so well pleased with their zealous
fervor, their fidelity and fixednesse in his way, (which made them, in
Testimony of their love to him, not to love their lives unto the death) he
therefore brought them forth, to Crown them, in the sight of these who killed
them, and in that Crucified their Master again; while they with a keen
cruelty killed, he crowned with loving kindness, and kissed their souls out
of them; kepped them, as they fell; carried them off the scaffold in embraces,
to present them to his Father and set the Martyrs Crown upon their head. I ^eed
no^ insist in a matter so manifest, as it is beyond the hidings or denyings of
those, who put them to death, and has also caused so many thanksgiving unto
God amongst the Saints; so that I may ask you, what do you fear? Do you fear
fruition? Do you fear that they who cast you in the fiery furnace, shall see
the Son of God walking with you in the midst of the flames? Do you fear, to be
seen made more then Conquerours through him who has loved you? Do you fear,
that when the incensed world has yoked a fiery Chariot for you, to carry out of
the world, that the world, who hate you and hurry you thus off the stage, shall
see the King come, and pave the bottom thereof for you with love? Do you
fear, that while they stretch out their hand against you, to take away your
life, he manifest his love, in putting his left hand under your head, and in
embracing you with his right? do you fear, that while your blood is shed, he
give convincing significations to all that look on, of his she ding abroad his
love in your heart, and that your blood is precious in his sight? Are these
things to be feared, which have been the ambition of many righteous men; yea,
and a piece of so great honor, as they durst scarce even themselves to a
sharing in it? Or, has he deserted one of all the sufferers? see, if you can
say it: why then are you daunted with danger? why do you doubt, but he who has
glorified his name in others, will glorify it again, in you? Nay, did he not
most signally defeat the expectation of adv^rsaries, and outdo the hope of his
poor servants, by the remarkablenesse of his assistances, given to some, who
were looked upon as such weak wriglings, as they could no^ stand it out? but
how by standing by them, and strengthening them, did he still the enemy and
avenger? and how did he, by the mavelous supporting of his Grace, perfect
praise out of the mouth of such babes and sucklings? I may appeal to the
conscience of any present at these executions, who savoure the things of God,
and saw, under what a shining presence, and with what joy u^speakeable and full
of glory, these dying men went out of the world, and these murdered martyrs
mounted their triumphant chariot, if they would not, at that time, upon
assu^ance to be carried off the stage, under the same sunshine and sweetness,
have left all they had in this world, and gone with gladenesse in their
company, in to the other world? If any one of all that now glorified company,
had been deserted, you might be discouraged, and shrink away, and say, what is
our strength that we should hope? But, since everlasting arms underneath have
been so visibly seen supporting every one, whom he called to suffer, it says
nothing, if it say not this, ^eare none of those things which you shall suffer:
For my grace shall be sufficient for y^u: And my strength shall be made perfect
in your weakness. Therefore, be not afraid, but approach your duty with
humble confidence and courage, even when death it self is in the way and you
shall ^inde it with you, as it was with the Priests, before whom Jordan
recoiled not, till their feet were within the brink. Wait for your
assistances, and supports in the hour of confl^ct, and in that very hour^ it
shall be given you: and you put in case to say, when we are weak, ^hen are we
strong.

And, to complete this account, and make it appear, that the most daring and
desperate enemy cannot ease his own soul, by giving one instance to the
contrair: I can not here pass the death of Mr Mi^chel: which the Lord has so
excellently ordered, both as to time and circumstances; for, whereas they, who
put him to death, did hope, to give thereby a da^h to the people o^ God, at
this time, and by their severitie exercised upon him, to make them shrink, into
a fearful compliance, with their iniquous Contrivances; but, the supporting
presence of God with him was such, as no man needs for fear to forsake the way
of the Lord, because of what befell him: I mentione not here the cause, but
leave the world to the account himself has given thereof, with what his
Advocats had to plead, on his behalf: And shall only, without making a
parallel, or instituting a comparison between the two, allude to Samson's
death, in this execution: Not, that I may take occasion, to tell the world,
that he who was aimed at may pass any day in the year, for a Lord amongst the
uncircumcised Philistims: For, that is no news; nay the world may judge, I do
these Lords wrong, and him too, in not associating him with -- But First,
Sampson was a rackel and rough-handed saint, ready to pe^t the Philistims, upon
all occasions: yet secondly, the Holy Ghost for all the faults that followed
him has recorded his name, and enrolled him, in the number (even while the
names of many other are left out) of these eminent worthies, H^b. 11. And so,
he has made the name of Mr Mitchell savovrie; and as he took many Testimonies
from him at all his appearances, to the cause; so he owned him in the end, and
hono^red him to die, witnessing a good confession, which will be on record to
pos^eritie^ Thirdly, as Sampson did more mische^fe to the enemies of the people
of God, at his death, than in all his life, (for when they sent for him to make
themselves mirry with a sight of his misery, the Lord helped him to spil their
sport) so I judge, it is beyond question, with every sober man, that Mr
Mitchells death has done more hurt to it is contrivers, and furious drivers,
than ever his l^fe could have done, even, though he had shot again, and hit
that un hallowed mark: For, now, where as he has died desired they who drove
it, have, in breathing out their cruelty against him, brought an indelible
infamy upon themselves, and ent^iled upon their posterity a reproach, never to
be rolled away! yea, they have missed their mark so far, in hiting him; as, I
suppose, the most confident scoffer, amongst all those, who promised them
selves matter of mirth, by his death, and some thing, on which they might
break their jest, will be more loath, to hear Mr Mitchels death mentioned,
than the death of any of those worthies, that went before him; lest, concerning
themselves, it also be remembered, how -- And thus, was that prediction
fulfilled, with a witness, contrary to the mind of him, who, in saying so, did
both mock and menace at once, that God did glorify himself by Mr Mithels death
in the grass market: Yea, glorify himself he did, and glory to him for having
done so. Is not this then Brethren, heart-comforting and hand strengthening
that, all who went off the stage, thus died, under these refreshing
manifestations, and ravishments of spirit; as their enjoyments would be the
measure of men's desires, for their own soul, as they were the measure of the
desires of these dying Martyrs, for all the people of God; For, what could they
wish more, or seek more, on the behalf of these; But, O that it were with
them, in all things as it is with us, except, as to this scaffold! which yet to
us, while under these manifestations, is preferable to all the thrones of the
Earth, and the Pharadises and Plea^ures, wherein they live, who put us to
death? Nay, so mavelous was the presence of God, with these his dying
witnesses, as I doubt nothing; but, some of the enemies, who looked on, and had
a hand in sheding that innocent blood, have said with themselves since, O, let
me die the death of th^se righteous men, and let my latter end be like theirs!
And I much doubt, when death shall look the greatest Desperado amongst them, in
the face, and he finds himself, ready to be dragged before the judgment seat
of Christ, if the question were asked him, whether he would have his soul now
gathered, with the souls of these suffere^s? or, with their souls, who shall be
brought in before the Tribunal, with their fingers droping with the blood of
those, whom they killed upon such an account, that he would be at any demurre
what to choice?

Fear not then to follow, Dear Brethren, since you see, how honorably the
charges of all, that have gone before you, have been borne: you have the same
good God, the same Christ, the same Spirit, the same cause, the same covenanted
strength: have therefore the same confidence and courage: as they did, so do
you carry, as in nothing terrified, by your Adversaries, which, as it was in
them; so, it will be in you, an evident token of perdition to your proud and
implacable persecuters, But to you of salvation, and that of God.

Suffer me, ere I close, to put one drop more in this cup, to make it cooling
(and never-the-lesse cordial for that) Endeavor, Dear Friends, with a Zealous
prudence, while you are in this fire of fiery trialls, to prevent or
exstinguish the wild fire of unnecessare and hurtful animosities amongst your
selves, by the flame of fervent and true love to God, and one another: this
fire will burn out the other! you see, the enemy thrusts sore at you, that you
may fall; therefore, to the end they may miss their mark, and you may stand
fast in the Lord, stand close together: I shall not enlarge upon this head,
only, let me put you in mind of that notable place to this purpose, when the
Apostle Philip. 1. (after what he had said of himself V. 20. O for a company in
case to say the like!) comes to persuade to a carriage, such as becomes the
Gospel, he pitched particularly upon this piece of a Gospel-becomeing
conversation, and perswads to it: That I may hear (says he) -- that ye stand
fast in one Spirit, with one mind, striving together for the faith of the
Gospel, etc.. And knoweing well, how much true unity did strengthen the
saints, while put to this striving, he does in the following Cap. Viz. c. 2. v.
1, 2, 3. with a mervellously sweet emphaticknesse, inculcat and commend the
same thing, with such a warm variety of heart-melting and affection-moving
words and arguments, as are sufficient (or nothing can be) to cement, and
souder into a samenesse, the souls and affections of all saints: If there be
therefore, says he; any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any
fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels and mercies: fulfill ye my joy: that
you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind: Let
nothing be done, through strife, or vain glory; but in lowliness of mind, let
each esteem other, better than themselves: Now what can be said after this?
Here you have union nobly qualified, and arguments powerfully quickening to
pursue after it; O fall a striving therefore, while put to strive against
enemies, who shall love God and his precious interests most, and one another
best: who shall be most ready to forbear, and to bear one another burdens;
that so, in fulfilling this law of Christ, all may the more cheerfully bear
the Cross of Christ: have there been amongst you animosities, contentions,
jealousies, whisperings, evil surmiseings, etc. (the more is the pitie^) well,
then now is the time, to confirm your love one toward another: Now, set your
selves to provoke one another, to love, and to good works: Now see, if you, who
have discoursed, and disputed your selves a sunder, can pray your selves
together, and so meet in that blessed center: I little doubt, if your heart be
heaven-hot, in praying together, in weeping before God together, in wrestleing
with him together; but you will walk after the Lord together, in a sweet
zealous singleness of frame: when your hearts have been warmely poured out
together before God, a spiritual harmony, and famenesse of soul, in working
the work of the Lord, will follow upon it: And if my observation do not fail,
our contentions never became hot, till we were cooled and much taken off, from
praying together: Consider what your enemies are doing, driveing, and
designing: Is it not, to make you fall asunder, that you may not be able, when
divided amongst your selves, to stand before them? or to withstand them? take
that door of them, by shuting the door upon them, at which you see they design
to ente^: and that their access may be the more easy, they will flatter some
of you, or forbear some of you, while they fall upon others, that so they may
run down, and ruin all and raze foundations at last with ease: Set your selves
therefore, with an oneness of soul and shoulder, to defeat this desperate
design; and in order to the frustrating of the projects of these peruerters of
the right ways of God, let union in the Lord, amongst his servants and people,
be studied, and endeavored: Let us carry in this day, as men of understanding,
who know the times, and how the true Israelits of God ought to behave one
toward another, while the Adversaries, lie in wait to prey upon our divisions:
and is it suitable while they gnash upon us with their teeth, that we should
bite and devour one another? or, is it not more Christian and Christ-like, that
while we suffer together, we smile one upon onother, and support one another;
yea, and if it should come to dying, die embraceing one another? Let therefore
all unsuteable and unseasonable striving and unbrotherly and unchristian
contending be prevented, or exstinguished, ere they come to a flame: for that
is fatal. It is well known, how small a wedge of the same timber, driven by the
policy of an enemy, especially when in power, has made great and grievous
breaches, amongst such, who once took sweet counsel together, and walked to the
house of God in company: how frequently, in all ages of the Church, have they
carrried away many, first to a connivance, then to a compliance (for he who is
once cheated into a connivanee, is easily charmed into a compliance) with their
designs, and so rendered the opposition of the rest, who stood and withstood,
less significant. Let us therefore be wise: Let us take notice of the
Adversaries stratagems, whose maxim is Devide and impera: And in this they are
so cunning, and closs; as sometime they can personat a division amongst
themselves, that they may the more certainly effectuat it, amongst us; which,
when it comes to pass, it has ever deplorable and dismal effects: For, there
is ever a sad and certain connection observed, betwixt a dividing time in the
Church, and a further departure from the truth, and a hotter persecution of
those, who cleave to God and his truth, with purpose of heart, But becaufe I
know, the greatest pretenders to what is now pleaded for, and persuaded unto,
are really the greatest enemies to that union and concord, intended by the
Spirit of God; And, to the end they themselves may be applauded, in their not
strivings, as becomes, for the truth; they, of all men, are most ready to
represent such as do, as fire brands and Church renders. And therefore, let
none mistake what love to union, amongst all the serious servants of Jesus
Christ, in such a day, has caused me to drop; as if thereby, I did intend to
plead for, or persuade unto, an union, with a disadvantage to the precious
truth of God, and the true interest of the Gospel, or did insinuat, in order to
peace and union, either an approbation of forbearance of duty, in its proper
season, or of taking such courses, as in regaird of circumstances may be
construed, a compliance with the men, who have made themselves, and the Nation,
guilty before God of this high transgression, to wit, of destroying what they
once built, and building again what they destroyed: what? shall we leave any
thing undone, or shall we do any thing, under what speciou^ pretext soever,
that may seem to say, we have said, a confederacy to such, who call us to a
confederacy, after God had inst^ucted us with a strong hand, not to say so,
since that confederacy will be found a conspiracy against him? should we join
again with the persons of these abominations, and break his covenant? would he
not be angry with us till he had consumed us? The woe upon woe, and w^ath upon
wrath which was denounced against Scotland, by a great Seer, and eminently
faithful Master Builder amongst us upon the apprehension of a relapse into a
compliance with the haters of the Lord and the work of reformation, whereto he
preceived a propension, and saw the Nation begun already to be leavened with
the dreadful leaven of Apostasy, is so sadly accomplished upon us, that,
unless we be a people devoted to ruin and utter destruction, we will learn
from what is past, to stand aloof^ and stop our ears, at the Syren-songs of
those, who pipe to us, that we may dance a compliance with them, in their
breach of covenant with the most High, and secure them into, a quiet possession
of all, which they have taken from our blessed Lord Jesus Christ: for, this is
the substance and sense of this now pressed Bound, and these newly required
Lawborrowe^s. O if ever there was a day, to be unite in crying, u^ite our
hearts to fear that glorious and fearful name, the Lord our God; If ever
there was a day to be unite in watching, in standing fast in the faith, in
quiting our selves like men, this is that day! when these God-provoking courses
are carried on, and our compliance and concurrence therein required! O^ now,
when th^re is such a combination against the Christ of God, such an oneness i^
opposeing his Anointed, let us study an union, in abiding with him, in owning
^im, as King, and Supreme! let us continue with him, in these temptations, and
contend for him; let us contend with one another (for that confirms true union)
to excite to this contention: Let us study and promove oneness in walking in
the good old way, without turning aside to the right hand or to the left;
because of the lion that is in it, and without laying other foundations, in
whole or in part, than what were laid: Let us not disorder these foundations,
nor pick a stone out of that beautiful fabric, and then put our invention upon
the ra^k, to forge a consistency betwixt some cessions to the adversary, old
principles, and find out a way, how to go some length with them, or how not to
oppose them, while they with so high a hand overturn the work of God, and yet
retain our integrity, and set off this our novel invention to our Brethren,
with the embrode^ie, and vermilion of u^ion; and think, there is sufficient
ground, to call all dividers, and stigmatize them as such, who will not, with
us, g^ude about, to change their way, and lay as much weight upon our notions,
and dark, yea benighting Dist^ngoes, as we do. Let us study an oneness in
promoving the opposed work of God (Alas! under the pretense of being unite
amongst our selves, we were charmed, and chained, into a forbearance of many
things, in their proper season, which may, and ought, to send us mourning to
our grave; and keep a clos^ union, between sorrow and our soul, till death make
a divorce between soul and body) let us study an on^nesse in endeavoring some
thing, ^o signify our sorrow and shame, for the ground which we have lost, and
the advantage the Adversary, by our faintings has go^, to t^^mple upon, and
triumph ove^ our case: An oneness in seeking of God a right way, by fasting
and pra^er; not daring ^o listen unto, rush upon, or receive overtours without
consulting God, since the concern is his; and communing with our brethren, not
only equally concerned, but countenanced of God, in their endeavoring to hold
fast their integrity, and hold on in the good old way. Let us studiean
oneness, in remembering whence we have fallen, and in admonishing, and being
content to be admonished; lest we be hardened, through the deceitfulness of
sin, into a de^en^ce of it. Let us be followers of others, forsaking them in no
case, nor under no pretext, in as fare, as they are followers of Christ: Let
these be the men, whose practice we propose as a pattern for imitation, whose
carriage al alongs, whose constancy in the cause, whose courage in continuing
at the work of the Lord, when hazard did attend duty, spoke them, to hate the
way of them who turn aside: And let us not count that the making of a breach,
to forsake (for then we count without God, and have no^ the mind of Christ)
any, or not to fall in with them, and follow them in that, wherein they forsake
the way of God, and cease to be what they were, and begin to be, what once they
were not, and to do or leave undone, what they condemned, as de^ection or
de^astable neutralitie. It is a great abuse of language (to give it the best
name) to put the name, or notion of union, upon that, which, if searched to the
bottom, would make it appear, that in this the uniters are rather dividers
from the Lord, than endeavourers to keep the unity of the spirit, in the bond
of peace: It was not against this union nor inconsistent with it, for Paul to
withstand Peter to the face, when he saw, that he walked not uprightly,
according to the truth of the Gospel, and when his way had carried away others,
into a dissimulation: If God have said, if any man draw back, may soul shall
have no pleasure in him; Let never our soul enter into their secrets, who would
seduce us, in to a relinquishing of the cause, or into a conniveance even at a
discovered propension to that, in others: let us study the import of the place
above adduced; to wit, a standing fast in one spirit, with one mind, striving
together, for the faith of the Gospel; striving and standing up together for
those things, in the faith whereof, we professed our selves ^ixed, beyond the
unfixings of contrary Laws, execute with all cruelty: nay, for the faith,
which we our selves delivered to the Saints, and for which, we should contend
with all flesh; though for that, we should be counted Schismatics, and men of
Contention, with the whole earth. There was an Union amongst the Disciples,
when they all forsook him and fled. O let us beware! and have a care, lest,
while we cry up and commend union amongst our selves, that, in keeping one
another company, we leave not Christ Jesus, our Lord and master, to walk alone.
Unity amongst brethren is a very desirable thing: (and the Lord will require
it, at his hand, who endeavors it not, in his way) but, there is a Jewel, of
infinite more value, oneness with God, and oneness with and in the truth: and
if our pursuings of the one be not minded, in it is just subordination unto^ and
for the promoving of the other, it loses it is intrinsic value; and becomes a
plague; and thus, that which should have been for our welfare, is made our
trap: Let union amongst brethren be accounted the ring never to be broken^ but
let union in the truth, and with God, be coured the Rubie and Diamond: if this
be lost, our union loses it'^ name, and changes it is nature, and passes with
him, for a Conspiracy: and so should it do with us. This ought to be our first
care, yea and next care too, how to keep him company, and to continue sted^ast
and immovable, abounding in the work of the Lord; and if herein our fellovv
servants desert us, or our brethren be otherwise minded, yet we must go on,
hoping and praying that God will reveal the same things to them, and grant
them, to be like minded with us, according to Chist Jesus, if we have
attained to clearness in duty: and hereby the way, I must say, though I hate
and abhore rash courses, and I hope would no^ stand to condemn in my self, as
well as in others, ^ running upon, and rushing into untroden paths; yet God
has made ou^ way so plain of old, as the vvay-faring man though a fool,
needs not er^e in it: these are no novel^ies or notions; these are no new and
dark things, we have to contend for. Is Covenant keeping with God a disputable
point! Is it dobtful, whether Christ be absolut in his own house! or falls it
under debate, whether he is to be obeyed, rather than men! And tr^ely, of late,
the course and carriage of our enemies, so directly opposite to ^he ways of
God, has left no place for doubting about duty, if we be but delivered from
fear of danger. If then, I say, we have attained unto clearness in duty, let
us shut our eyes upon all dangers, difficulties and discouragements, arising
from the unclearnesse or reluctance of Brethren, yea of Fathers, and hold on in
our way: let us stop our ears, and become deaf to insinuations, however
^oloured, which would foreslow us, in following and serving him. If we must
desert, and be deserted of others, for doing so; O then, but the presence of
God appearing with, and for them, who in such circumstances appear for him, as
it has, so it will make up, to the satisfaction of men^ souls and senses, the
want of other company? Paul's notwithstanding, made all odds even: It was no
reproach to Athanasius, that it was said of him, unus Athanasius contra totum
mundum; But that which has perpetuat his renown, and made his name savourie to
all the lovers of our Lord Jesus Christ; nor shall it be to any, who walk in
the same Spirit, who walk in the same steps.

And to this union of heart amongst your selves, suffer me to append this word:
Let there be a communion of all good things amongst you also, for supplying the
wants and necessities of your suffering brethren: Ought you in some cases to
lay down your lives for the brethren^ then I pray such, who shut their eyes
that they may not open their hands to minister to their necessities, to think
how they shall answer that question, when put to them (for put to every one,
and more particularly to all that have a profession of love to Christ in the
Nation, it shall be) 1 Ioh. 3:17. it may be some of you have much taken from
you, and so think your self exempted. but have you more then what is simply
necessare (and in this God will be judge, who will cut off all your
superfluities out of reckoning) for the present support of your selves, while
others have nothing? then consider the place 2. Cor. 8:1, 2, 3. etc. for I
cannot enlarge; nay read that whole Chapter and the next; and the consideration
of what the Holy Ghost has there said, if any of his words have weight with
you, must powerfully persuade to this duty: remember what is said of the
believers Acts 2. from ver. 41. etc. and consider what the paritie of the case
pleads. But I may not insist (yea, and dare I say, I hope it is needless?)
only let me ask you what you would do for Christ himself, if he were so dealt
with? Then consider the place Math. 25: v. 35. and see how he reckons, and
reckon that he will reckon wit^ you in tha^ day, according to that reckoning,
and your carriage in this. I hope, this one place for all^ if ^ver you look to
have a place with him; and suffer me to leave you with a desire to consider
that place also Heb. 13. and if you will compare what is said of that great
duty of suffering for Christ v. 13 and of that high duty of praising God v.
15. and compare what is said of both, with what is said of the duty now
persuaded to v. 16 and you will both know what is to be done, and carry as
believing, he is not unrighteous to forget the work and labor of love of such,
who minister to the necessity of those, who for his names sake have been
spoiled of all: Only persuade your selves, God is taking particular notice of
the carriage of every man and woman in Scotland, this day; and accordingl^ as
he observes, he will repay; he that sows sparingly shall reap sparingly, and
he that sows bountifully shall reap bountifully.

I shall shut up all, in answering two Questions briefly: First, what now
should be our carriage in reference to enemies? Secondly, what may be our hope
of a delivery from them?

To the first I say shortly, let us be moved, out of compassion to their
precious souls, First, to pray much for them: While they stretch forth their
hands against you, study ye this blessed revenge of good will: Li^t up your
heart, with your hands, unto God in the heavens, on their behalf; that the
spirit of repentance may be given them: Do this, and fulfill his law, whose
injunction it is, pray for them that despite fully use you, and persecute you:
It may be, there are some of the elect, so far left at present^ as to run
along with this course, pray, that these may be reclaimed: and however, it
will afford you much sweet peace, to have this Testimony, that, while they in
rage and malicious rancour, were pursuing you to heavens gates, you, in love
and compassion to their souls, endeavored to cry to him to catch them and
carry them in with you, to the fruition of himself, and to share with you, in
the glory to be revealed: And though, as to them, you should not prevail; yet,
besides that your prayer shall be set forth before him as incense, it shall
return into your own bosom.

Secondly, henceforth stand, aloof, from all listenings to proposals coming
from them, or making any to them: For what ever fredom and clearness Godly and
wise men might formerly or hitherto have had, without scruple in this matter,
before they had made such a clear discovery of their perfect and stated
opposition to Christ as King, and of the purity of their enmity at, and
implacabilitie against all, who desire to be faithful and loyal to Him; yet
now, I conceive us called of God, to take this course; as that way, wherein
alone we can expect his approbation, and countenance: First, as the most
propter mean, to convince them of their wickedness: This now, seems to be the
most proper Testimony, against their way, to stand at such distance from them.
Secondly, as the alone expedient, how to preserve our selves free from all
compliances with them, and in good terms with Jesus Christ: for, seeing it is
his presence we now need, it is sure best policy, to beware of sining him out
of soul or sight, by touching with that, which is soul hates, and for which his
soul will be avenged. Thirdly, this is the way, to preserve unity amongst the
remnant: do we not know, that their dainties are decei^ful meat? do we not
know, that their most seemingly tender mercies are really keen cruelty? do
they offer us any thing, that looks like a favor but upon design, that they
may more cer^ainly ruin the work of God, by our divisions about it? I shall
give but two instances, to evidence what their purposes are, in their treatings
with us. The first I had from a great man, now in glory, who had it from the
mouth of that Noble Man, who then was active above all others, in bringing the
Indulgence first upon the stage (I abstract wholly, from the thing it self, for
that is not my business now, to say either good or ill of it; I only intend
here to discover, what they design by their favors) when he said to him, what
my Lord intend you by this Indulgence? and, what do you think to gain by it?
if, said that Noble Man, we ga^ne no more, we shall certainly gain this, It
shall separate between the made cape, and the moderat fanatics (I give it in
the very words, wherein I had it) this was plain dealing indeed, and a palpable
discovery of the desperatnesse of the design: A second Instance is this, when
that work of darkness, our Supr^macy, was brought to light, to the end, we
should not, according to the merit of the cause, be allarmed and give the
all^rme (which its like from the knowledge of our principles, their conscience
indi^ed to be our duty) some were ^et on work, to whisper us into the ear,
and mumble us into a mutnesse, that we should not meant, nor whimper, at the
sight of this prodigious monster; though, for face and feature, an opposition
to Christ as King beyond what ever had appeared upon the stage: But why
forsooth must we be silent? O! because favor to the fanatics is hereby
intended^ for, what ever appea^ed at brime, there was some special advantage to
them, at bottom: The lessening of the Episcopal power which did so lash the
fanatics, and the curbing of their cruelty, was intended: By which means,
they we^e sure, that so many, as they could fool into this fa^sie, or please
with this nothing, or if any thing, the most wicked of all things, would not
only divide, and be divided from their brethren; But they knew very well also,
that the more seeing and serious servants of Christ, who adhered to former
principles, would count themselves called of God, to look upon such, what ever
names they assume to themselves, as manifest deser^ers of the cause of the
Church of Scotland, and betrayers of it. And for my own part, how much so ever
I am for union; yet, I scruple not to let the world know, that be who he will^
that has beaten his brains, to shape a beautiful mask, for hi^ing the hell
blakenesse of thi^ monsters face, which should be the abhorrence of all that
love our Lord Jesus Christ in sinceritie^ and has strained his wit, to put a
sufferab^e sense, upon a ^upremacy, whereby our Lord is put again to suffer: I
say, I scruple not, to let the world know, that this is the Echo of my soul, as
to him, or them; O let never my soul enter into the secrets of that man! and
let him (who while he thus seeks to ^ile the eyes of others bewrays this
secret, he is no Seer: nay that some finger is put into his eye, I shall not
say, whose it is) ne^e^ be the man of my council nay, let all the ^ervants, and
all ^he people of God, stand aloof from him, and his whispe^ings, because, in
stead of being in case to give wholesome advise, as one who stands in his
masters Counsel, he will, by his palliatings and perverse mutterings, seduce,
pervert, and ensnare: his breath will be contagious, since his speech must
bewray him, to have the bot^h of the Court-Creed running upon him. Hence
Fourthly, I must profess (and I desire to say it as in the presence of God,
and as writing that which I must carry-in, in my hand, before the Tribunal of
Christ: what ever prejudice should be taken up, against the speaker, or the
thing spoken) that it pass^th the ken of my poor shallow capacity, after all
the discoveries, the enemies have made of the desperatnesse of their design,
how, by all possible means, and malicious methods, to ruin the work of God,
and after the Mediators Crown is so formally set upon the head of another, and
all that is now done^ and driven, in destroying the remnant, is in order to the
establishment of that invasion of his Crown, and Scepter, what address is
possible to be made to him, ^ho is thus set down, in the Mediators Chair of
State, and wears his Crown in our sight, without sin: except it be, to tell,
we can make none: or to beseech to forbear to persecute the Mediators
Ambassadors, who must continue to preach the Gospel, by virtue of their
Commission: Yea, who dare not think o^ appearing before Christ, without having
given such a Testi^ony of their resentment of the us^rpation of their Masters
^hro^e, and Scepter: and who dare never present themselves to God, without
doing the equivalent of spreading that Supremacy before him; and praying, that
he would take unto him his ^reat power and reigne^ and possess himself again
of his own ^h^one, and, disposse^sing these who have usurped it, show his zeal
for his Prerogative Royal: And^ how such a declaration before men, and such
dealing with Go^, can consist with addresses t^ ^^em, in Church matters, who
have taken to themselves his house in possession and yet be fr^^ from all
compliance with, countenancing of, and conniveance a^, that great wicke^ness^,
I see not: And I hope never to see with his eyes, who saith^ he sees it. They
have now stated the qu^rrel clearly for us: And, as ever we would have Christ
to stand be us, and stand up to pl^ad this own cause, when we are not able to
withstand the power of the enemy, let ^s stand by him, and stand aloof from
them. As we have neither hoof nor h^^ to part with, in this matter; so we have
nothing to seek from any, that si^s in our Masters chair of state. God forbid,
that ever we should be seen to bow or beg before t^em, while they sit there!
how ever, when we are passive, we may make use of what liberty is given; yet,
it is our safety, it is our peace, it is the interest of the Gospel, and for
the glory of our exalted Prince, to abstain from seekings, an^ receivings from
those, who stand in such terms of opposition to him. As to the second
question: What hopes we may entertain of a Delivery, from our persecuters?
First, I say, there is nothing in my judgment, which can deliver me, or any
who considers the nature of our National revolt, in all its God-provoking
circumstances, and how deeply every one is guilty, from him, who sits upon
the throne, to him who grindeth behind the mill: and how this sin is now
become the sin of the Nation; whereby the whole is made a curse, without
meditating terror, at the apprehensions of the ^^yrcenes^e of the wra^h of God
Almighty, against Brittan: Less th^n such a signification of his displeasure,
that we are the people, against whom the Lord will have indignation ^or ever:
less than utter ruin and the perishing of the name of that Nation, that
Generation, and People, from under the heavens of the Lord, who have so
contemned his Covenant, and taken his name in vain, is less, sure, than what
our iniquity gives ground to ^^are, is but hovering over us and ready to fall
upon us; It is true, not a few (and blessed be ^e for that!^ have found mercy,
not to go alongs, with all these courses; But yet, let me say even to these, it
becomes us to be very sober, in our expe^tations, and submissive; passeing the
example of Ephesus, etc. let us persuade our own souls into this submission,
and sobriety, from the example of God's holy procedor wi^h Moses Deuteronomy. 3.23,
24.25, 26 oh, if but for an unadvised word! If but for a little smoke about the
fire of his holy and fervent zeal for God, he, who next to the Mediator, w^ as
reckoned faithful, in all the house, and mat^ers of God, was keept out of
Canaan? May not that holy peremptorinesse, in the just and jealous God, whereby
he refused to be importuned by such a servant, make us, in remembrance of what
we have unworthily done, and left undone, very sober, in our expectations, and
silent, though he should cause us fall i^ the wilde^nesse, and make our death
prevent the dawning of that blessed, and desirable day? O that we could, in the
mean time, learn at that holy man, to be solicititous, how to transmit pure
ordinances, to the posterity, as we se^ he was; that if we must go off the
stage, yet we may live and die, witnessing, how desirous we are, that God may
be great amongst the posterity, when we are gone: And, that an example of
witnessing for our wronged Lord and M^st^r, may be transmited to those who
shall succeed; withal warning them, that they do no^ follow our example,
wherein we have not contented valiant^y, for Christ, and the interest of his
Crown.

Secondly, I cannot forbear to say, that, if in the soveraignitie of his
Grace, he should go out of the common road of his ordinary providence, and
make the delivery come in ou^ days; Yet, I am sure, (at least I may say it, as
to my self) a sober reflection upon what we have been and done, may make us
fear, that we shall have no other interests in it, but to be Spectators: And
that if ^e make use of instruments, it shall be of such, (how few soever, how
base and fecklesse soever, before men, how weak and witless soever) as are
free of what my self, and many are guilty of; And with whom there has been a
fire of zeal for God, witnessed by their faithful forwardness, while, with my
self and others, there was scarce the smoking of a flax: Though yet he may
graciously condescend, even to make our hair grow again, and so make use of
o^r h^nds abo^t his work, and put us in case, to shake ourselves, as his
Servants have done at other times.

Yet Thirdly, to the end, the poor People of the Lord may not be frighted, nor
fainted into a despondency; let me add this: That deliverance to the people of
God, in his own time, way, and manner, (which I leave wholy to Himself) and
that a great and glorious one, shall come: And this is no less cer^ain, than
that I^ho^ah cannot fail to establish the Throne of his Anointed: Nay, if all
the Kings of ^he Earth should agree amongst themselves, to set up one Monarch,
and invest him, with the power of our Supremacy; yet all the power they could
make, managed with all the Policy in hell, or out of ^ell, should not be able,
to setle that Crown upon the Head of that Mortal; But, the Immor^al God
should, with the omnipotent Power of his right arm, shake that Usurper out of
his seat, and setle the Throne of his Anointed upon the ruin of his
Adversaries. Has he said it? has he sworn it? and shall not the Zeal of
Jehovah perform it? Has Christ bought his Crown and Scepter, with his Blood?
and has he such a tittle and right to it? And has he all power in Heaven and
in Earth, for securing himself in the possession of his purchase? And shall any
mortal o^ter to mount his Throne? Shall any mortal offer to stripe him of this
Glory, pull the Crown from his Head, and cloth himself with the spoils of the
Mediator's honor, and be able to keep himself, in possession of what he has
taken from the Son of God? O vain attempt? Let them answer these Questions, put
unto them Psalm. 2: verse. 1, 2. and read ^he^r doom, V^r^. 4, 5. O! the
Mediator's Iron rod, put in his hand for securing to him his royal Scepter,
shall make the potsheads of the Earth, by dashing them in pieces, know, wha^ it
is ^o strive with him for state? And here, let me add these things shortly;
First, A^ in the way he shall take to a^compl^sh our delivery, his holy and hot
Indignation against breach of Covenant with God shall be witnessed to the
conviction even of suc^ who dec^e^d it; (for the breach o^ Covenant with him,
shall either breack Britta^'s Heart or Head (so, Secondly, It shall be seen, to
have a most convincingly closs connection with the vengeance^ wherewith our
Sup^^m^cy shall be pursued The Mediators Ze^l against this idol of ind^^nation
shall be written on the revenges, he will take for it: And in the day, when he
rai^eth up a pa^tie, to state the quarrel upon this Head, how despicable, and
contemptible so ever they may appear; th^n it shall appear, he is about
rescinding of our Supremacy (for rescinded it shall be, and if they will not,
he will Nay, because they will not, he shall: For his Crown must flowrish on
his own Head, and all his Enemies must be clothed with shame) and setting that
Crown with pure gold, upon his Head, from whose Head it is taken, by our Law.
And Thirdly, Let me add this (and so I have done) that, as their rage and
violence, in this late invasion made upon you, in pursueance of the design of
a full and final setlement of themselves, in the possession of what they have
taken from Jesus Christ, by the ruin and overthrow of all, whose way speaks
the least of resistance, even to a non-compliance^ has been an high transport
of rage, whereby they have been carried, beyond all the Boundaries of Law and
Reason: So I have as little doubt, but God shall make the connection, betwixt
his arising to deliver his People, and their having risen up thus, to delete
and destroy them at once, so closs, and so clear, (how long so ever he delay
it) as it shall be no matter of dif^icultie, for any, who wisely considers
these things, to observe what dependence upon, and connection with, the
deliverance of the People of the Lord, has, as to it is visible rise, with this
their horrid and inhumane violence. He is the Lord, wh^ will hasten these
things in his time.

Do not therefore, beloved Sufferers for Christ, suffer your hearts, to sink
into a despondency: The cause is His, and he will plead, yea thoroughly plead
that cause, which is his own: And this shall be your Crown and Comfort to
continue contending for him (for so the cause, that is so purely his, becomes
the cause of your Soul) and if you should fall in this conflict, and die
suffering; Besides, that you fall in the bed of honor, and fall asleep, in the
blessed expectation of the conquerours Crown, this your cause will out live all
it is Enemies, and have a glorious Resurrection; and your wrestlings, and
witnessings, and sufferings, as they will be rewarded in Heaven; so they shall
be recorded on Earth: Therefore, lift up the hands that hang down, and
strengthen the freeble knees: The some, yea greater, afflictions have been
accomplished, in your Brethren, which have been in the World; and as the God of
all Grace, after they had suffered a while, made them perfect, and put them in
possession of that eternal Glory, to which they were called by Jesus Christ^
so shall he stablish, strengthen, settle and keep you from falling, and after
all your sorrovves and sufferings, present you faultlesse, before the presence
of his Glory, with exceeding joy: Pray for

Your poor Welwisher and Companion in Tribulation.
