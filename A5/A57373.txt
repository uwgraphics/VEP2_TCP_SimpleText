Right Honorable,
OF all people in the world, that is the only Ps. 144. 15.
happy people whose God is the LORD; the Lord being that, suprem Mat. 19. 16,
17.
good, in whom alone are concentred all beatificall Genesis 17. 1 Mat. 5. 48.
Perfections. No people can enjoy the Lord as their God, but by Covenant in
Christ Jesus, that only Joh 14. 6.
way unto the Father. Covenant Interest in Christ cannot actually be pleaded by
any person, but only such a^ are actually seized of a gracious Jer. 31. 3. 4.
Covenant-State; the Grace of the Covenant i^ us, being the surest Pledg^ of
Gods entering into the Co^ venant of Grace with us. S^ that to be in a Graciou^
State is true happiness: B^ to know our selves to be such a State, is true
happiness double upon us.

Hereupon, that I might lend some help to true believers, for reading and
discerning their own spiritual Evidences of their State of Grace, I have been
persuaded to publish this bundle of Believers Evidences for Eternal Life in
the ensuing Treatise. Whereunto I have been the more inclinable, that my lines
might be of use,

1. To 1 Those. 5. 14
support the weak, and comfort the feebleminded, who Ps. 22. 1. and P^. 77. and
Ps. 88.
walk heavily and disconsolately in the paths of grace, through want of
Assurance; That they hereby coming in some measure 1 Cor. 2. 12.
to know the things that are freely given to them of God, may Heb. 12. 12.
lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees, and Ps. 119. 32.
run with enlarged hearts the way of Gods Commandments.

2. To confute really the Enthusiasticall fancies, the ignorant
Anti-Scripturall opinions of some, who cry up (I know not what) imaginary
Raptures, Revelations, and other Dreams of their own, as the only Characters
of Election and Justification: decrying, as carnal, all discoveries of
believers spiritual estates by marks and Signs of Sanctification. For this

beloved Disciple is full of such marks; as in this book is evident. Christ
has taught us to judge of Mat. 7. 16, 17, 18.
the tree by the fruits. And Reason directs us to discover the Cause by the
effect.

3. To divert the distempered minds of men a little (if it be possible) from
jejune, empty, 1 Timothy 6. 5.
perverse disputes, 1 Timothy 1. 6.
vain janglings, brainsick notions and speculations, (the calamity of these
crazy times,) to exercise themselves upon that wholesome necessary practical
business of 2 Pet. 1. 10.
making their calling and Election sure. We have laid out far too much Isa.
55. 2
for that which is not bread, for that which satisfies not.

4. And finally, to rouse up my self, and all sorts of Christians in this
Kingdom, in these slippery days, (wherein both Lives, Liberties, Health,
Friends, Wealth, Pleasures, Honors, Crowns, Scepters, and all sublunaries are
in such extremity of extraordinary uncertainties,) to 1 Timothy 6. 12, 19.
lay hold and make sure of eternal life; that in the midst of all terrestrial
Concussions and Revolutions, we may have a celestial unshaken foundation of
true spiritual Peace and Consolation.

Your Honors noble respects, and undeserved favors heretofore manifested unto
me, have commanded me to Dedicate and Present unto you this small Testimonial
of my unfeigned gratitude. And wherein can I be more truly serviceable to your
Honors, then in such sincere endeavors to promote your Assurance of eternal
salvation? Now the 1 Pet. 5. 10.
God of all Grace, fill your hearts with all the Gal. 5. 22, 23.
fruits of his Spirit, Col. 2. 2.
unto all riches of the full assurance of understandding, and Heb. 10. 22.
faith, and Heb. 6. 11, 18, 19.
hope in this life: And at last crown you both, with ineffable glory in the
life to come, in the full enjoyment of himself, who is the Heaven of heaven,
and Glory of glory. So prays

Augustines, London. October. 9. 1648. Your Honors humble and faithful servant

of it. 2. The Trial of it. 3. The way of Attaining it. 4. Inducements to it.

not to count them his Sons and Daughters; The Son is Heb. 2. 11
not ashamed to call them Brethren, and the Holy Ghost is pleased to make them

glorified eternally. They are John 12. 26.

Cor. 1. 20
Promises are theirs, All the richest Graces are theirs, All the sweetest

22, 23. Romans 8. 32
all things. Psalm. 144 15.
O Happy, happy is that people, that thus have the Lord to be their God!

This sweet and blissful State of Grace is rendered double sweet unto the
faithful, when once they come to know themselves to be in such a State.
Assurance of our State of grace, is grace doubled. But in evil times (such as
are come upon us,) when we can promise our selves no certainty of any sublunary
enjoyment: pleasures being quickly drowned in Prove. 24 13
bitterness; Pro. 23. 5
Riches taking to themselves wings; Honors wheel suddenly turning upside
down; Crowns toppling off the Heads, and Scepters dropping out of the hands of
Princes; The Isa. 23. 9
Pride of all glory being stained; and the strongest foundations and pillars of
Kingdoms being shaken; friends, liberties, life and all we have, exposed to
much hazard and jeopardy: In such seasons when we can be sure of nothing on
earth, yet then to be sure of grace and glory, is grace trebled, and in some
measure glorified.

To Advance this spiritual happiness among the Israel of God; in midst of our
temporal miseries, this small ensuing Treatise is published; Spiritual
certainties being the best antidote against Temporal uncertainties. Though the
Platform of these Evidences be confined to the compass of this sweet Epistle
(as August. Praef. in. 1. Ep. Joan.
Augustine styles it) of the sweetest Apostle; yet the amplifications and
demonstrations of the several particulars in much variety, are borrowed from
other Scriptures, and so far extended that they do amount to a large Anatomy
of the spiritual state of a Christian; as may appear in the foregoing Table,
wherein the Evidences are methodized.

Before the perusal of particulars, be pleased to pause a little to take view
of Assurance in the General; and herein of, (1.) The nature of it. (2.) The
trial of it. (3.) The way of attaining and retaining of it. And (4.) The
Inducements persuading to it.

I. Of the nature of Assurance.
Assurance or Certainty is twofold, viz.

The assurance or Certainty of the object believed; That Deuteronomy. 32 4 Joh. 17. 3
God is true, and I.
what he has Romans 4 21. 2. Tim. 1. 12. 2 Cor. 1. 20.
promised shall certainly and faithfully be performed. This is not the
Assurance we enquire after; though certainty of the object, be the ground and
foundation, whereupon certainty of the subject is primarily bottomed.

The Assurance or Certainty of the subject believing. This is the Assurance II.
we are to consider of.

This Assurance has several Denominations in Scripture, viz. 1. (...); Romans
8. 38.
A Persuasion; rendered Ephesians. 3. 11
Confidence. (...), faith has its name from Persuading, because thereby the
heart is persuaded. 2. (...), A perspicuous manifestation, viz. when Joh. 14.
21, 22, 23
Christ manifests himself to the soul that loves him, as not to the world. 3.
(...), 1 John 3. 2, 14, 19, 24. and 1 John 5. 13, 19. and 2. 3, 5.
Knowledge, thus its often styled. 4. (...), H^b. 4. 16 Ephesians. 312.
Boldness; so its usually translated, importing an undaunted (yet humble and
dutiful) looking God in the face, etc. 5. (...), Full-assurance, when Faith
acts strongly, without Romans 4 19, 20, 21.
staggering through unbelief. This is called, sometimes Col. 2. 2.
Full assurance of understanding: Sometimes Heb. 6. 11. 18, 19.
Full assurance of Hope: And sometimes Heb. 10. 2^
Full assurance of Faith. For Knowledge, Faith and Hope do all contribute their
influence to the making up of Full assurance.

Of this Assurance or certainty of the Subject, there are certain kinds, or
rather degrees: principally these three.

1. A certainty of Adherence and Application; when we certainly apply and
adhere to the promise, and to Christ therein: peremptorily devolving, and
casting our selves upon him for salvation, though perhaps without evident and
sensible comforts. This is Jo^. 1. 12
receiving of Christ, Act. 11. 23
cleaving to the Lord with full purpose of heart; if we must perish, we will
perish believing. Job 13. 15
Though he kill me, etc. This is the minimum quod sic, viz. the lowest step of
Assurance, and is so of the nature of faith, that faith cannot be without it in
the weakest believer. Every true believer has this assurance.

2. A Certainty of Evidence or Experience. When by the reflection of conscience
and faith upon themselves and their own acts, or by the Testimony of the
Spirit of God, we evidently see we are in a gracious State, experimentally
discerning what God has done for us, and that upon such and such grounds,
effects of grace, or other discoveries. As being 2 Cor. 5 17
new creatures, 1 John 1. 7.
walking in the light, Romans 8. 1
walking after the spirit, not after the flesh, 1 John 3. 14
loving the brethren, etc. This some call Assurance of Internal vision. Menti
nostrae fides nostra conspicua est. Aug. Ep. 112. c. 3. Eamfidem tenet
certissima scientia, cla matque conscientia.
Agustine counts this a clear evidence, saying, that our faith is conspicuous
to our own mind, and that a man holds his faith by certain knowledge, and
attestation of conscience. And (says Qui fidei suae sensum in cord habet, hic
scit Christum Jesum in se esse. Ambros. in Ep. 2. ad Corinth. cap. 13. ver. 5.
Ambrose) He that has the sense of faith in his heart, knows that Christ is
in himself. This Assurance is usually attended with much comfort, and sweet
joy upon the soul that has it. Yet every Christian reaches it not, as the
former: though all should contend earnestly for it. It seems to pertain rather
to the well-being, then to the mere being of faith and grace.

3. An unstaggering certainty, or a Full assurance; when there is such a full
persuasion, that overcomes all doubts, fears, staggerings of unbelief, as in
Romans 4. 17, 18, 19, 20
Abraham the father of the faithful. This is the maximum quod sic, viz. The
highest Pinnacle of Assurance in this life, next unto celestial enjoyment, and
very few attain unto it.

II. Of the Trial of Assurance.
The Trial of the truth of our assurance, is of great importance and
necessity. For, 1. Many Christians have some degree of assurance, who think
they have none at all. Let such but be convinced of what they have, they are
comforted. 2. Many have no true assurance at all, who yet pretend thereto most
of all. Carnal men and hypocrites. As Hos. 8. 1, 2, 3
Israel, Solomon's Prove. 14. 16
fool, the L^k. 18. 11, 12
selfejustifying Pharisee; and the Rev. 3 17
Laedicean Angel. Such should be convinced of what they want, that they might
be humbled and replenished. All graces, and so Assurance, have their
countefeits; we had need try them, lest we take shadows for substances, Copper
for gold.

Try Assurance, by the, (1) Qualification of the subject assured. (2.) Grounds
or Causes of Assurance. (3.) Fruits or effects of Assurance.

I. The subject of Assurance, must be duly qualified, ere he can be capable of
Assurance. Persons are previously and preparatorily qualified for Assurance.

1. By kindly humbling of the soul, breaking of the heart, and troubling of
the conscience, with fears about their natural condition. Romans 8. 15, 16.
compared with Matthew. 11. 28. Isa. 61. 1, 2.
The spirit of bondage to fear, goes before the spirit of adoption, witnessing
with our spirit our Sonship. More or less thus God deals with all that come
by assurance. Where Is thy true humbling?

2. By furnishing the humbled broken heart, with saving faith. Ephesians. (...). 13.
First we believe, then are after sealed with the Spirit of promise. Where Is
thy true faith?

3. By giving them the Spirit; they must first have the Spirit of God, ere 1
Cor. 2. 12
by the Spirit they can know the things given them of God Has God truly given
thee his Spirit?

II. The Grounds or Causes of assurance, must not be, 1. Ignorance Romans 7. 9
Rev. 3. 17
of our miserable state. 2. Nor carnal confidence upon common things, viz.
Hos. 12. 7, 8
worldly prosperity, Matthew. 7. 22, 23. Luke 18. 9 to 13 Mat. 19. 20. Phil. 3
outward acts of religion: or Heb. 6. 4, 5
common inward gifts of the Spirit. Illumination, Taste of the good Word of
God, etc. those and like are the false grounds of hypocrites. But Grounds of
true assurance, are either,

1. Divine Testimony by audible voice. Thus Christ assured the Man. 9. 2, 5, 6.
Luke 5. 20, 23
Palsie-man. and Luke 7. 47, 48
the penitent woman of pardon, and the Luke 23. 42, 43
Convert thief of Paradise. But this vocal Testimony was extraordinary. To
expect the like now, or else to reject other grounds of assurance, were to
tempt God.

2. The lively exercise of faith, reflecting upon its own acts, and ^seeing it
self believing. Faiths acts are, 1. Direct; and these either (1.) Receptive
Joh. 1. 12
of Christ; or (2.) Operative Acts 15. 9. Romans 5. 1. Gal. 5 6
from and by Christ received. 2. Reflexive, when faith returns upon it self,
looks back upon its own acts, thus receiving Christ, thus working, as Paul 2 Timothy 1. 12
knew whom he had believed. Does thy faith thus act?

3. The Testimony of our own sanctified Romans 8. 16. 1 John 3. 19, 20, 21. 2
Cor. 1. 12.
spiritual heart or conscience, according to the Word of God, of our good
spiritual estate. Prove. 20 27.
The spirit of man is as the candle of the Lord, searching all the inward parts
of the belly, 1 Cor. 2. 10, 11, 12.
knows what is in him. This Testimony of our sanctified conscience is usually
obsolved by Ratiocination or discourse in a Practical experimental
Syllogism, thus,

The Proposition being taken out of the Word, viz. Some eminent Scripture*
Sign or Character of grace, (as in 2 Cor. 5. 17. Acts 15. 9. 1 John 1. 7. and
3. 14. He that loves the brethren is passed from death to life) this is
dictated by the (...), viz. The Conservative Treasury of conscience treasu^ing
up such Principles.

The Assumption is drawn from our own ^nown state and experience in the things
of Christ, etc. As; But I love the brethren. This is made by the (...), viz.
Con^cience, as conscious of a man's state, and frame ^f heart.

The Conclusion, containing the hearts sen^ence hereupon, (Therefore I am
transla^d from death to life,) is made by the (...), Judgment, or judiciary
sentence of con^ience upon the Premises. Does thy con^ience thus assure thee by
the Word?

4. The Testimony of the Spirit of God, which 1 John 3. 24. and 4. 13. 1 Cor.
2. 12
purposely given us to this end, that we ^ay know the things that are given us
of ^od. Now the Spirit becomes the Author ^d ground of our Assurance, 1. As a
Seal, ^aling us after we believe, by his holy and a Ephesians. 1. 13
heavenly impression. 2. As an Ephesians. 1. 14 Romans 8. 23
earnest of our eternal inheritance. First Fruits of the true Canaan, or
Handsell of heaven. 3. As Romans 8. 16
a joint witness with our spirits and consciences both 1 Cor. 2. 9, 10, 11,
12, 14.
clearing up our spiritual evidences to our minds, and 1 John 2. 27.
opening our minds to discern them as a teaching unction, enabling us to know
all things. Have thou such a Testimony from the Spirit of God?

III. The fruits or effects of true assurance, distinguishing it from
counterfeit assurance, Presumption, are these and such like;

1. True assurance wherever it be, mightily incites to selfe-purifying, to
accurate sanctification in heart and life. Now 1 John 3. 2, 3.
we are the Sons of God, -- but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be
like him. -- An^ every man that has this hope in him, purifie^ himself, even
as he is pure. See this selfe-purifying See page 175, to 179.
hereafter more fully opened. Deuteronomy. 29. 18, 19.
Presumption encourages in sin and impurity.

2. True assurance stirs up fervent d^ fires and longings in such hearts
after the Gospel of Jesus Christ, They that once ha^ truly tasted the Lords
graciousness, [pleasan^ness, goodness, etc] they 1 Pet. 2. 2, 3.
as newborn babes lo^ for the sincere milk of the Word that they m^ grow
thereby. But Presumption or car^ confidence, breeds rather Psalm. 50. 16, 17.
disaffection, the true affection to the Word; Such either desire it not at
all, or not the pure sincere Wor^ or not in reference to their growth.

3. True assurance makes the soul incomparable to prize Communion with God and
Jesus Christ; Cant. 2. 6, 7, 16, 17 compared with Cant. 3. 1, to 6. and 5. 2,
10 c. 6. 4.
when the Church had obtained Christ's sweet embracements, and perceived her
self lodged in the bosom of her dearest Love, and knew that her beloved was
hers, and she his: how jealous is she lest any should disturb him, or drive
him from her; so earnest is she to be filled with his fellowship; and upon his
withdrawing in any measure from her, how restless is she till his return!
David was a man of much heavenly experience and assurance; when his evidences
were dimmed by his fall, how pathetically does he cry! Psa. 51. 8, 12.
Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bones which thou have broken may
rejoice. -- Restore to me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free
Spirit. Presumption knows not what Communion with Christ's means.

4. True assurance notably engages those that have it to serve and honor God
in their places to the uttermost. God assured Joshua ^osh. 1. 15.
that he will never leave him nor forsake him; and Joshua resolves (what ever
others do) that ^osh. 24. 15.
he and his house will serve the Lord. Sense of Christ's love 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15.
constrained Paul to all zeal in his ministry. David said Ps. 118. 28.
Thou art my God, and I will praise thee, thou art my God, and I will exalt
thee. Presumption provokes and contemnes God; Job 21. 14, 15
what is the Almighty that we should serve him? etc.

5. True assurance singularly supports and comforts the heart in deepest
tribulations. As is remarkably evident in Job. 19. 25, etc.
Job, and 2 Cor. 1. 12
Paul. Carnal confidence in such cases is a miserable Comforter.

6. True assurance Romans 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
fills with joy in hope of glory, after tribulation has done its worst. They
that have no more then carnal confidence, have indeed Ephesians. 2. 12
no hope of another world.

III. Of the way how to attain and retain Assurance
Having thus seen the Character of true Assurance; next consider we How to
compass and conserve it. To this end faithfully follow these and such like
directions; viz.

1. Be much in selfe-examination, frequen^ in selfe-Probation, that you may
find where your evidence clearly lies, 2 Cor. 13. 5
Examine you^ selves, prove your own selves: know ye no^ that Jesus Christ is
in you except ye be re^ probates? If a man's Title of land be questioned, how
will he search and examine hi^ evidences, and also take the best counse^ upon
them? A Merchant that would exactly know his own State, he often examine^ and
casts up his Books. So should Christians be much in casting up and examinin^
their spiritual evidences, that would obtai^ assurance of their good estate to
God.

2. 1 These. 5
Quench not, Ephesians. 4. 30
grieve not the Spirit of God, by any known corruption, but still entertain
him with all holy acceptablenesse; for the Spirit of God is therefore given us,
1 Cor. 2. 10, 11, 12, etc.
that we by him might be assured, and know the things given us of God, and he
Romans 8. 16 Ephesians. 1. 13, 14. with 1 John 3. 24 and 4. 13.
assures us most convincingly, clearly, satisfactorily.

3. Cherish and improve all your graces, (for every grace has an evidence in
it) but peculiarly your special Assuring graces, viz. Col. 2. 2
Knowledge, Heb. 10. 22
Faith, and Heb. 6. 11, 18, 19
Hope. By knowledge we discern our selves: By faith we reallize and
appropriate to our selves for present the things as yet not seen; and by hope
we patiently wait for full enjoyment. All tend to assurance.

4. Constantly Act. 23. (...) (...) 24. 16
exercise your selves herein, to have a conscience void of offense toward God
and man, in all the parts of well-doing. Romans 8. 16. 1 John 3. 18, 19, 20, 21.
2 Cor. 1. 12
A good conscience, and Isai. 32. 17. Prove. 14. 26
a gracious upright Conversation, are singular grounds and helps to Assurance;
Psalm. 50. 23
To him that orders his conversation aright, will I show the salvation of
God. And Christ says, John 14. 21
He that has my Cemmandements, and keeps them, he it is that loves me; and
he that loves me, shall be beloved of my Father, and I will love him, and will
manifest my self unto him.

5. Remember former experiences of Assurance: the days of old, the years of
Gods right hand; these will support and persuade our hearts against doubtings.
Gods Ps. 7^. 7, 8, 9, 10. and Psalm. 143, 5, 6. and 61. 2, 3. and 71. 5, 6, 20.
people have taken this course in their wants of assurance.

6. Labor to getout of those conditions which are prejudicial and obstructive
to assurance. These are four, viz. 1. The Infancy of grace. Infants in nature,
live, move, grow, etc. long before they actually know it: So Babes in grace
have not their spiritual Heb. 5. 13, 14.
senses exercised to discern their condition. Labor to 1 Cor. 14. 20. 2 Per.
3. ^8.
be men in growth, both in grace and knowledge. 2. The spiritual slumber or
sleep of security. In natural sleep our senses are so tied up that we discern
not our natural or civil State: In the spiritual slumber of security, our
assurance is suspended, our evidences sleep with us, as in the Cant. 3. 1, 2.
and 5. 2, 3, 6.
Church in her spiritual security. Awake thy self out of security. 3. The
spiritual Swoon of Desertions. In a Swoon, when our spirits and sense fail us,
we discern not our natural life: In Psalm. 22. 1. and 77. and 88.
spiritual Desertions, when God withdrawes the light of his countenance and
sweet presence, we discern not our spiritual life. Labor to remove
Desertions, the Conflicts of temptations, and other soule-distempers. When the
body is in deep distempers, has been astonished with dangerous falls, etc. it
is not comfortably sensible of its corporal condition; no more is the soul in
deep Temptations, Afflictions, especially Relapses, apprehensive of its good
spiritual condition. As in Ps. 51. 8, 12, etc.
David upon his fall. Therefore wrestle out of temptations and relapses.

7. Diligently and skilfully improve those notable. Assuring Ordinances, the
Word, Lords Supper, and Prayer, To help on all the former directions in
reference to assurance, 1. The Word was therefore written 1 John 5. 13. Joh. 15
11. and 1 John 1. 4.
that believers might know they have eternal life. Col. 3. 16
Let it therefore dwell in you richly in all wisdom. 2. The Lords Supper,
particularly and individually seals up Mat. 26. 27, 28.
remission of sins, 1 Cor. 10. 16, 17.
Communion with Christ, and interest in 1 Cor. 11. 24, 25.
the New Testament. Be at the Lords table frequently, but still manage it
worthily. And, 3. Prayer not only spreads open a man's heart to himself, but
pierces the heavens, creeps into the bosom of God, and often furnishes the
doubting spirit with Joh. 16. 24
Assurance in the very exercise of it. Therefore labor to be mighty men in
prayer; Pray always and faint not. How often do the servants of God Psalm. 6. 1,
etc. 8. 9. and 31. 21, 22. and 13. 1, 2, 5, 6.
begin their prayer, doubting and perplexed: but conclude assured and
persuaded! David begins, O Lord, rebuke me not in ihine anger, neither chasten
me in thy hot displeasure, etc. and he ends, The Lord has heard the voice of
my weeping. The Lord has heard my supplication.

By these and such like means, true Assurance may be obtained by the people of
Go^ when they want it, recovered when they have lost it, and retained when they
have go^ possession of it.

IV. Inducements unto Assurance.
I. Non-Assurance of Gods favor in Christ and of our true state of grace in
him, is a man nifold misery and prejudice to the dear children of God. For,

1. This is a bad Sign.

1. Sometimes of the defectivenesse an^ weakness of grace in such, that they
are bu^ babes, not grown men in Christ, because Heb. 5. 13, 14
their spiritual senses are not as yet exercised, so fa^ as to discern 1 Cor.
2. 10, 11, 12
the things of God in them selves, and that they want very much o^ the 1 John
2. 27. 1 Cor. 2. 11
Anointing of the Spirit, to reveal unt^ them the things of the Spirit. Now
Chri^ stians should strive to get out of their infa^ cy and imbecility of
grace, not still remain^ ing 1 Cor. 14. 20 Ephesians. 4. 12 to 17. 2. Pet. 3. 18
children and babes in faith and know^ ledge, but laboring to become men in
Christ growing up unto perfection.

2. Sometimes of the strength and prevai^ ing of corruption and temptation;
when 2 Samu. 11. with Psa. 15 8, 12
D^ vid had relapsed, he lost the joy of Gods salv^ tion: Great falls aftonish
and amaze bot^ corporal and spiritual senses. And it much concerns all
Christians to wrestle again^ entangling temptations, and recover the^ selves
out of Relapses.

3. Sometimes of spiritual desertions, that the Lord has in some measure
forsaken the soul, and withdrawn himself, as in the case of Psa. 22. 1
David, Psalm. 88
Heman, Psalm. 77.
Asaph, and the Cant. 3. 1, 2. and 5. 6, 7, 8
Church her self. Now spiritual desertions are such overwhelming afflictions
to the soul, that has once truly tasted of the sweetness of Christ's
presence, that the gracious heart is wholly restless till it be again
reembraced in the dearest arms of love and favor.

2. This is one great cause of Christians dejectedness and uncomfortablenesse;
that though they are in a state of grace, yet they cannot discern themselves
to be in such a gracious State. To be in the true State of grace, is the
happiest ground of comfort: but till there be some apprehension and knowledge
of that our State, oft-times we have small sense of comfort. As Genesis 21. 16, 19
Hagar, (when her bottle of water was spent, and her child ready to die,) she
sat down full of perplexity, and yet there was a Well in the place, the Well
did not comfort her, though close by her, till the Lord opened her eyes to see
it. How Luke 24. 14, 15
pensive and sad were the two Disciples going toward Emmaus, about Christ's
death, though Christ risen from the dead, was in their company and talked with
them, whilst their eyes were holden, that they should not know him? How did
Joh. 20. 14, 15.
Mary Magdalene stand weeping by Christ's Sepulcher, supposing that his dead
body was thence stolen away, though Christ revived and risen, stood close by
her; and why? Christ was present, but she did not know him. So if we be close
by the Well of grace, if Christ be present with us, yea, in us, if yet we know
it not, we are still in our discomforts, our tears and sorrows are still
flowing. David was told by the Prophet, 1 Samuel 12 13.
The Lord has put away thy sin; but because David had not the sense and
apprehension hereof, he wanted Psalm. 51. 8, 12.
the joy of Gods salvation, and groaned still under his broken bones a good
while after.

II. God has often charged his people to contend after the security and
assurance of their Spiritual State. 2 Pet. 1. 10
Give diligence to make your calling and election sure. -- 2 Cor. 13 5
Examine your selves whether you be in the faith, etc. -- Heb. 10. 22
Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith. -- Heb. 6. 11
We desire that every one of you do show the same diligence, to the full
assurance of hope unto the end.

III. It is Possible that such as are in a state of grace may (if the fault be
not their own) come to know and be assured they are in such a state. For, 1.
Many Joh. 14. 21. Rev. 2. 17. 1 Cor. 2. 9. Ro^. 13 1 John 2. 3, 5. and 3. 2,
14, 19. and 4. 13. and 5. 13, 19.
Scriptures intimate this. 2. The Nature of saving Knowledge, Faith, and Hope
Col. 2 2 Heb. 10. 22 and 6. 11.
tend to this. 3. Many Gracious persons have sometimes attained to this, though
at other times not without their doubtings and infirmities. As Job 19. 25, 26,
27.
Job, Psalm. 22. 1. and 51. 8, 12.
David, 2 Kings 20. 3.
Hezekiah, John 20. 28.
Thomas, John 21. 15, 16, 17.
Peter, 2 Timothy 1. 12.
Paul, Cant. 2. 16. and 7. 10.
the Church her self.

Finally, Assurance of our gracious state is richly worth all earnest
endeavors after it. They that once attain to it, (as hereafter is See p. 3, 4.
manifested) find a Jewel of great price, and Pro. 14. 10.
no stranger shall intermeddle with their joy.

BELIEVERS Evidences FOR Eternal Life: Collected out of the first EPISTLE of
JOHN, which is Catholic.
JOHN is an Hebrew name, and signifies, The Lord has been gracious; or, The
grace of the Lord He was Son of Ze^edee, brother of James; and called by Christ
to the Apostolical office, Mat. 4. ^1. and 10. 2 Mar. 1. 19. Luke 5. 10. which
is ^he highest Ecclesiastical Office under the New Testament, 1 Cor. 12. 28:
Ephesians. 4. 11. John was one of the three whom Christ took up with him to Mount
Ta^or to behold his glorious Transfiguration, Matthew. 17. etc. Mark 9. 2. Luke
9. 28, etc. One of the two whom Christ sent to prepare his last Passover, Luke
22. 8. and that Disciple whom Jesus peculiarly loved above all the rest, John
13. 23. and 19. 29. and 20. 2. and 21. 7, 20. who leaned on Jesus breast at
supper, to whom Christ by a private token discovered that Judas should betray
him, John 13. 23, 24, 25, 26. and to whom alone Christ dying on the Cross
commended his own Mother, John 19. 25, 26, 27. This JOHN, (this compound of
love an^ sweetness,) wrote this Epistle. A^ Epistle (says Calvin in Argumin
ep. Johan.
Calvin) altogether worth of the spirit of that Disciple^ who w^ therefore
beloved of Christ above the re^ that he might render himself more famili^ to
us. A most sweet Epistle (says August. Praefa^. in 1. Johan. Epist.
Austin most memorable in the Church of God, becau^ love is there especially
commanded. An Epistle whose principal Scope and end is, T^ help the believers
to a well-groun^ ed Assurance of their actual inter^ in eternal life; These
things (sai^ John,) have I written unto you that b^ lieve on the Name of the
Son of God, the ye may know that ye have eternal life, 1 John 5. 13. To this
end the holy Ghost by the Apostle has replenished this precious Epistle with
more variety and plenty of pregnant Marks, Signs, Characters or Evidences of
Believers spiritual estate, then any other Scripture of like quantity in the
whole Book of God. So that it is a Rich Treasury for Christian-Assurance. 1
Assurance (if the fault be not our own) is Attainable, John 14 21. Rev. 2. 17.
1 Cor. 2. 9, to 13. 1 John 2. 3, 5. and 3 2, 14, 19, 24. and 4. 13. and 5. 19.
2 Assurance has been actually attained by diverse; Job, chapter 19. 25, 26, 27.
David, Psalm. 22. 1. and 51 8, 12. Thomas, John 20. 28. Paul, 2 Timothy 1. 12. 2
Cor. 5. 1. Romans 8. 37, 38. Gal. 2. 20. 1 Timothy 1. 13, 14. 16. The Church of
Christ, Cant 2. 16. and 7. 10. 3 The nature of faith and hope tend and lead on
unto Assurance, Col. 2. 2. Heb. 6. 11, 18, 19. Heb. 10. 23. 4 Hence all
Christians ought to ^ontend after Assurance, 2 Cor. 13. 5. (...) Assurance that
eternal life is ours, actually attained, brings great glory to God, Romans 4. 20,
21. is the glory of faith, Romans 4. 19, 20. overcomes greatest difficulties,
Romans 4. 17, 18. is an approved cordial extraordinarily strengthening believers
hearts in worst times, under saddest afflictions, yea, in the straits of death,
Job 19. 25, 26, 27. 2 Timothy 4. 7, 8. and in a word, is a Paradise on earth, the
suburbs of Heaven, and sweetest glimpse of glory. Come hither therefore all ye
doubting souls, and drooping Christians, that walk in darkness, and have no
light of Assurance and comfort; this blessed Epistle is an Epistle for you;
read it and meditate upon it continually, till you be persuaded, settled,
stablished, comforted. And for your further help peruse these evidences
extracted out of it and familiarly digested by him whose comfort it will be, to
be an Helper of your joy.

CHAP. I.
Evidences or Signs of Gods love to us.

Christ's being sent to lay down his life I.
for us, that we might live by him: may be a first Sign of Gods love to us.
Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us, 1 John 3. 16. In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God
sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son
to be the propitiation for our sins, 1 John 4. 9, 10. Hence when actually we
live through Christ, we actually taste Gods free love in Christ.

Gods special love acts toward his beloved ones, chiefly three ways, (1.) In
electing them before all time, elect of God, holy and beloved, Col. 3. 12.
which is more peculiarly ascribed to the Father, 1 Pet. 1. 2. (2.) In redeeming
them in fullness of time, which is more peculiarly attributed to the Son, Ioh.
15. 12, 13. Gal. 2. 20. Rev. 1. 5. (3.) In immediate applying of Christ unto
them in due time by sanctification, effectual calling, etc. and this is more
peculiarly given to the Holy Ghost, Tit. 3. 4, 5. 1. Pet. 1. 2. And in every of
these acts of love, God comes nearer and closer unto his, The Fathers love in
electing, is love intended, and purposed; this is most remote: The Sons love
in redeeming, is love actually demonstrated to the world; this is nearer: but
the Holy Ghosts love in sanctifying, etc. is love effectually and peculiarly
applied to individual persons; this is most near. Would we know our interest
in the Fathers electing love? consider what part we have in the Sons
redeeming love: would we discover our share in the Sons redeeming love? then
let us accurately search what right and property we have in the Spirits
sanctifying love; when we spiritually live from the Father through the Son by
the Spirit, then God gives us a taste of his love experimentally.

Excellently Hoc est ergo illud quod supra dixi, quia plus non amat Deus, quam
filium pater. Evidens quippe re^est quod super affectum filiorum nos Deus
diligit, qui propter nos filio non pep^rcit. Et quid plus addo? and hoc filio
justo, and hoc filio unigenito, and hoc filio Deo. Et quid dici amplius potest?
and hoc pro nobis, id est, pro malis, pro impiissimis, pro iniquis. Qu^s
aestimare hunc erga nos Dei amorem queat, nisi quod j^stitia Dei tanta est, ut
in eum aliquid injustum cadere non possit? Nam quantum ad rationem humanam
pertinet, injustam rem homo quilibet fecerat, si pro pessimis servis filium
bonum occidisset. Utique hoc magis inaestimabilis pietas, and hoc mirabilis
magis Dei virtus est, quod ita intelligi ab homine magnitudo justitiae suae non
potest^ut quantum ad imbecillitatem humanam pertinet, pene injustitiae speciem
magnitudo justitiae habere videatur. Salvian. Massil. De Gubern. Dei. Lib. 4.
p. 121, 122. Oxon. 1629.
Salvian (that eminent Presbyter of the Massilian Church who flourished in the
fifth Century) discourses of this love of God to us. This is that which I said
before, that God loves us more, then a Father his Son. Verily the thing is
evident, that God loves us above the affection of sons, who for our sakes
has not spared his Son. And what add I further? and this a just Son, and
this an only begotten Son, and this Son God, And what can be said more? and
this for us; that is, for evil ones; for most wicked ones; for unrighteous
ones. Who can estimate this love of God toward us, but that the justice of God
is such, that no unjust thing can be incident unto him? For so far as humane
reason may judge, any man had done an unjust thing, if for the worst servants
he should haveput to death a good Son. So that in this the piety of God is
more inestimable, and in this the virtue of God is more admirable, that so the
greatness of his justice cannot by man be understood: inasmuch as to the
apprehension of humane imbecility, the greatness of his justice seems almost
to have a show of in justice. So he.

Adoption. That we should be reckoned II.
among the children of God, may be a second Sign of Gods love to us: Behold,
what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called
the Sons of God! 1 John 3. 1. Well said the Apostle [Behold, what manner of
love!] for here is not only love, but love to admiration. That we without
strength, Rom 5. 6. we lost creatures, Luke 15. last; we sinners, Romans 5. 8. we
in the bond of iniquity, Act. 8. 13. we dead in trespasses and sins, Ephesians. 2. 1.
we enemies to God by wicked works, Col. 1. 21. we children of wrath, even as
others, Ephesians. 2. 3, etc. That we should be thus advanced in heavenly places in
Christ, and accounted not only servants, which is much, Ioh. 12. 26. not only
friends, which is more, Ioh. 15. 15. but also sons, and consequently heirs
and co-heires with Christ, which is most of all, Romans 8. 16, 17. Gal. 4. 4, 5,
6. Let men behold, let Angels behold, let both adore and admire, what manner of
love is this love. Show thy sonneship; this Sonship demonstrates infallibly
Gods love unto thee. God takes none into this nearest relation, but whom he
first took into his dearest affection. If thou art a Son of God, then (1.)
Thou art born again of the Spirit of God, John. 1. 12, 13. and 3. 3, 5. (2.)
Thou have received Jesus Christ by believing on his Name, Ioh. 1. 12. (3.) God
has instilled into thee a Son-like Spirit of prayer, Romans 8. 15, 26 (4.) Thou
art conform to Christ the firstborn among many brethren, Rom 8. 29 (5.) Thou
art acted, led, and guided by the Spirit of God, Romans 8. 14.

Our not loving the world, not the III.
things that are in the world, inordinately: may be a third Sign of Gods love
to us. Love not the world, nor the things that are in the world; for if any man
love the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the
world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is
not of the Father, but is of the world; and the world passes away, and the
lust thereof; but he that does the will of God, abides for ever, 1. Ioh. 3.
15, 16, 17. The love of the Father is in him neither Actively nor Passively,
who immediately loves the world. Not Actively, he loves not the Father: not
passively, he is not beloved of the Father; for who can be beloved of the
Father and not reciprocally love the Father again? 1 John. 4. 19. and who can
entertain the true love of the Father in the heart, but withal he must banish
the excessive love of the world out of the heart? For, 1. The love of the
Father and the love of the world are sorepugnant and inconsistent one with
another, Iam. 44. Matthew. 6. 24. 2. The love of the Father and of the world, do
each of them so forcibly exhaust and draw out the whole heart, that it is
impossible that these two loves should at one and the same time in intense
degrees, dwell in one and the same heart. As Mundi enim amor and Dei pariter in
uno cord, cohabitare non possunt: quemadmodum iidem oculi, coelum pariter ac
terram nequaquam conspiciunt. De 12. Abusionibus seculi Cypriano adscript. cap.
7.
Cyprian well observed: The love of God and the world cannot cohabit in one
heart together: as the same eye cannot at once look up to heaven, and down to
the earth together. But who do inordinately love the world, and things in the
world? Answ. 1. They who are wont inordinately to desire and seek it when they
want it, 1 Timothy 6. 9, 10. Matthew. 6. 31, 32, 33. 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2, 3. 2. Kings 5.
20, 22. 1 Kings 21. 4. 9, 10, 16. 2. They who are wont inordinately and
immoderately to set their hearts upon it, and abuse it whilst they have it,
Ps. 62. 10. 1 Timothy 6. 17. Luke 12. 16, to 22. Mat. 19. 21, 22, 23, 24. Iam. 5.
1, to 7. 34. 1. They who are wont excessively to grieve and perplex themselves
when they lose it, as Achitophel, who when he lost this worlds honors, went
discontentedly and hanged himself, 2 Samuel, 17. 23.

Our love to God, which is a sweet IV.
effect, a resulting ray, a reflexive beam of Gods love to us, may be a fourth
Sign of Gods love to us. We love him, because he first loved us, 1 John 4. 19.
When God begins to us in this sweet cup of love, we cannot choose but pledge
him: but should not he love us first, and we also have some apprehension of
that his love, we should never love him at all. For, as Bernard says, Deo
aman^ homines vicem amori^ non rependunt, nisi revelante else Spirimper fide
aeternum Dei Propositu^ super salute illorum futura. Bernard. Epst. 107.
Men render not love to God loving them, till the spirit of faith reveals to
them Gods eternal purpose, about their future salvation. As light breeds
light, fire fire, so Gods love to us, begets love to God in us,

But how or wherein has God loved us first? Answ. God the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost, has eternally loved us, in electing us, Col. 1. 12. 1 Pet. 1. 2.
Ephesians. 1. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. In a more peculiar sort, God the Fathers love first
shined forth toward us in giving Jesus Christ his own only Son, that Son of
his love, (Col. 1. 13.) for us, Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6. John 3. 16. Has God so loved
us, as not to spare his ^wne Son, (as has before been eviden^ed) how can
this choose, but kindle in us re^iprocall flames of love again to God, and ^ake
us delight in his love? They more I ^rink (says De dilectione Dei quo plus
bibi, plus sitio, and ea saturari non possum, nec ego nec aliquis perfect
diligens Christum. Ipse quo plus editur, plus famem exauget: and quanto plus
ipse bibitur, plus sitim inacuit; ipsam qua^ inhabitat mentem sic inebriat, ut
nihil jam quaeratvel diligat, nec deligere possit nec valeat praeter eum, qui
sic mundum dilexit, ut filium suum unigenitum daret ut omuis qui credit and
^ligit illum, non moriatur, sed vivatcum eo. D. Ber^rd. in c^a Dom. Sermon. 13.
ad init.
Bernard) of the love of God, the ^ore I am athirst, and cannot be satisfied
with ^t; nor I, nor any one perfectly loving Christ. This love, the more it is
eaten, the more it aug^ents hunger; the more it is drunken, the more ^t incites
thirst; it so inebriates that mind wherein it dwells, that it seeks, or loves
nothing, ^or possibly can love besides him, who so loved ^he world, that he
gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believes and loves him, might ^ot
die, but live with him. And in a more spe^iall manner, God the Son's love,
first prevented us, in his giving himself for us. When Christ stood by Lazarus
his grave, and wept for him, the Jews said, Behold, how he loved him! John 11.
35, 36. much more may we say when Christ did more then weep for us, when he
bled for us, when he dyed for us, Behold, and admire how he loved us! John 10.
11. and 15. 12, 13. Romans 5. 8. Ephesians. 5. 25. Gal. 2. 20. Rev. 1. 5. Can we
possibly look upon this love of Christ, and not be wholly overcome with it,
overpowered with it, ravished with it, and irresistibly constrained with it, t^
love Christ again, 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. Let (...) say with Ecce quomodo dilexit
nos! pro nobis elegit mori, ne nos morted^m naremur aeterna; Resurrexit a
mortuis, ut suae nos resurrectionis tribueret esse participes: Ascendit in
coelum, ut nos proveheret ad palatia coeli; Et sedet ad dextram Patris,
coronans and locans, laetificans and collocans illic, quos proprio cruore
redemit, quos gl^tino sibi charitatis asseruit secum in eadem dextra Patris.
Ipsum igitur Christum, sine modo, ultra modum, absque meta, ultra metam;
assidue, continue, toto cord, tota mente, totis viribus, totis virtutibus
diligamus, veneremur and amemu^. Bern in Coen. Dom. Sermon. 12. sub. fin.
Bernard, in his holy rapture o^ affections to Christ: Behold, how he loved u^
he chose to die for us, lest we should be doome^ to death eternal; he rose
from the dead, that h^ might render us partakers of his resurrecti^on; he
ascended into heaven, that he might advance us into celestial places; and he
sits at the right hand of the Father, seating, and crowning gladding and
placing there, such as he has redeemed with his own blood, such as he has
joined to himself with the cement of love, a^ the same right hand of the
Father with himself. Therefore let us love, adore and affect thi^ Christ
without measure, beyond measure; without bonds, beyond limits, daily,
continually, with all the heart, with all the mind, wit^ all our power, with
all our graces. Thus we shall love him, that first loved us.

Now then, do thou truly love God with all thy heart and soul? or (if that be
too high and hard a question) at least Domine, certe certus sum^ per gratiam
tuam; desiderium desiderii tui, and amorem amoris tu^ habere me in toto cord,
and in tota anima mea. Huc usque te fa^ ciente profeci, ut desiderem desiderare
te, and amemamare te. Bern. Soliloq. Sect. 5. p. 511. G. Luteti^. 1640.
do thou truly desire to love him, and love to desire him? Doubtless this is
an evidence that God loves thee. For nothing but his infinite ^ame of love to
thee, kindles this spark of ^ve in thee.

Quest. But by what signs may I know, ^at I truly love God and Jesus Christ,
or ^t least truly desire to love him?

Answ. Thou may know that thou tru^y love him, or desire to love him, if
thou ^ovest him, or desire to love him, (1.) Atractively. (2.) Intensively.
(3.) Sincerely. ^4.) Purely. (5.) Obedientially. (6.) Invincibly. ^7.)
Uncessantly.

1. Attractively and unitingly, when God and Jesus Christ are so indeared to
the ^eart, that the soul restlessely groans and pants after the enjoyment of
them; As in David, As the Hind pants after ^he water brooks, so pants my
soul after ^hee O God, my soul thirsts for God, for the ^iving God --,
Psalm. 42. 1. 2. As in Moses, I beseech thee show me thy glory, Exodus 31, 18. As
in the Church, Make haste my beloved, and ^e thou like to a Roe, or to a young
Heart upon the mountains of Spices, Cant. 8. 14. Christ says, Surely I come
quickly; The Church echoes, Amen, even so, come Lord Jesus, Rev. 22. 20. There
is a principle of motion in bodies natural; as in earth, that makes it descend
to ^its center; in fire, that makes it ascend to its proper resting place: and
(if impediments interpose not) they cannot rest till they be united to them:
thus that soul that tru^ loves God, has an inward supernatur^ Amor meus
pondus meum illo feror, quocunque feror. Aug.
principle, drawing it after God. Nor can acquiesce, or center it self any
where, but (...) God; the most amiable God having scatte^ ed some sparks of his
love in our hearts, a^ lures us after him: Natura est rapax sui.
as fire draws fire, o^ as the loadstone snatcheth the iron unto (...) self,
by its attractive, magnetic propert^ Does Gods love and loveliness so snatc^
and steal away thine heart after God, the thou longest to enjoy God, to have
union t^ him, and Communion with him? that is tru^ love; love is a cementing,
soddering, Est magnes magni magnus amoris amor.
magnetic grace. If thine be such, then (1.) Wha^ grief have thou in his
absence? (2.) What de sire of his presence. (3.) What delight in his enjoyment?
A true uniting love discovers i^ self in all these. 1. What grief is the
absence of God, and Christ to thy soul? Davi^ laments, when God did hide his
face, Psa^ 22. 1, etc. Psalm. 13. 1, etc. It was as a sword i^ his bones, when
the enemy said, Where i^ thy God? Psalm. 42. 10. But God had ever broken his
bones to shivers, when he had taken the joy of his salvation from him, Psalm.
51. 8, 12. And the Church is heart- sick, sick o^ love, when Christ had but a
little withdraw^ himself from her, Cant. 5. 6, 8. Where is thy pain, thy
sickness, thy grief, thy tears in Gods withdrawings? Love is impatient o^
divorce or distance. Parum diligis, si pro ejus amore quotidie non ploras and
ge mis ^naa^ illius absentia spo^ saediligenti solet sluvius esse lacryma^um
cum illu^ quaerit and non inve^it, vocat and non respondet, nil nisi flere came
delectat. Ber. in Caen. Do^. Sermon. 9. p. 1341. H.
Thou love him but (...) little, if for his love thou do not daily sigh and
weep; for his absence is wont to be a flood of ^ears to the loving spouse, when
she seeks him, ^ut finds him not; calls, but he answers not; nothing pleases
her but weeping. 2. What de^ires and groans have thou after the presence of
God, and Jesus Christ? My soul thirsts for ^ee, my flesh longs for thee.
-- My soul ^olloweth hard after thee, Psalm. 63. 1, 8. Here was David's love. I
have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung that I may
win Christ, Phil. 3. 8. Here was Paul's love. Let him kiss me with the kisses
of his mouth, Cant. 1. 2. Draw me, we shall run after ^hee, verse 4. Turn, my
beloved, and be thou like a Roe or young Heart upon the mountains of Bether,
Cant. 2. 17 Here is the Churches love. But where is thy love? where is thy
desires of the enjoyment of God and Jesus Christ? do thou strive like the
diseased Sed cum accedere gestio ad cum, and vel sicut haemorrho issa illa,
infirmae and miserae animae meae salutifero tactu vel simbriae ejus, quasi
furari gestio sanitatem; vel sicut Thomas ^ille vir desideriorum, totum eum
desidero videre and tangere, and ^non solum, sed accedere ad sacrosanctum
lateris ejus vulnus, ostium arcae quod factum est in latere; ut non tantum
mittam digitum, vel totam manum, sed totus intrem usque ad cor ipsum ^esu, in
Sanctum Sanctorum, inarcam Testamenti, ad mannam auream nostrae animam
humanitatis, continentem intra se Manna Divinitatis, Heu, dicitur mihi, noli me
tangere. Be^ard. Soli. ^oq. Sect. 4. p. 510. C. D. Lutet. 1640.
woman to draw near to Christ, that by a salutiferous touch of the hem of his
garment thou may as it were, steal spiritual soundness to thy miserable
soul? or like Thomas, that man of desires, desire thou to see and touch
Christ and not only so, but to approach to the sacr^ wounds of his side, (that
door of the Ark which was made in the side,) that thou maye^ thrust in, not
only thy finger, or thy whole hand but that thy whole self also may enter
in^ the very heart of Jesus, into that holy of holies into that Arc of the
Testament, into the golden pot, the soul of our humanity, wherei^ is the Manna
of the Divinity? I mean, dos^ thou long for most intimate enjoyment o^ and
Communion with Jesus Christ both God and man? this is love indeed. 3. Finally,
what delight and contentment do thou find in his Haec est gloria, hae sunt
diviliae in domo Beati amatoris tui: quia praesto est desideranti, and amanti,
quod desiderat and quod ama^: ideoque and qui desiderat semper amat desiderare;
and qui amat semper desiderat amare. Et desideranti and amanti, quod desid^rat
and amat, sio facis abundare, O Domine, ut nec anxietas desiderantem, nec
fastidium affligat abundantem. Bern. Soliloq^ Sect. 7. p. 512. K.
enjoyment? True love find^ most contentment in the enjoyment of the object
most beloved; hence, David preferring^ the enjoyment of Gods face before any
sublunary treasure, discovers his true love to God thus: Many say, Who will
show us good? Lord, list thou up the light of thy countenanc^ upon us; thou
have put gladness in mine heart, more then in the time that their corn and
their New Wine increased, Psalm. 4. 6, 7. And ye^ of all enjoyments of God and
Christ; beloved, that enjoyment is sweetest, that succeeds his absence and
estrangement. Health is always sweet, but double sweet after sickness;
liberty always pleasant, but double pleasant after imprisonment; life is
always comfortable, but to have returned from death to life, is a double life:
So to them that love God, his presence ever delectable, but his presence after
his soul-afflicting absence is even ravishing. Hence David wrestling out of an
intricate temptation, and recovering a sweet view of God, cries out, Whom have
I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth, that I desire besides thee.
My flesh and mine heart fails; but God is the strength of mine heart, and my
portion for ever, Psalm. 73. 25, 26. The Church enjoying Christ, says, I sat
down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet unto my
taste, Cant. 2. 3. but when after estrangement she found him whom her soul
loved, how is she transported? I held him, and would not let him go, until
that I had brought him into my mothers house, into the ch^mber of her that
conceived me. I charge you O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the Roes, and by the
Hindes of the field, that you stir not up nor awake my love ^ill he please,
Cant. 3. 4, 5. that is, let him have no offense given him. that I should lose
him any more. Can thou truly say in thy en^oyment of God, of Christ? O let
his Laeva temporalis consolationis tuae Domine non de sit, sed sit sub capite
meo ad utendum. Dextra, vero tua spiritualis, de spiritualibus and aet^rnis
consolatio tua totum me amplectatur ad fruendum, and inamplexu charitats tuae,
in osculis dulce ^inis. (...), in (...) ce in (...)
left hand be under my head, and his right hand em^race me. Cant. 2. 9. Lord,
let not the left hand ^f thy temporal consolation be wanting, but be under my
head for use: but let thy spiritual right hand, thy consolation about
spirituals and eternals, embrace me wholly, for enjoyment; sum do^miat and
requiescat anima mea -- Sed O Domine, si quando (quodqua^ rarum est) me in
aliqua hujus gaudii part invenio: clamo, vociferor; Domine bonum est nos hic
esse, faciamus hic tria tabernacula, fidei unum, amori unum, spei unum. Nunquid
nescio quid dicam cum dico; bonum est nos hic esse; Bern. Soliloq. Sect. 1.
and. 6.
and in the embracement of thy love, in the kisses of thy sweetness, my soul
shall rest and sleep in peace. -- O it is good for us to be here; let us build
three Tabernacles, one for Faith, one for Hope, and one for Love, but all for
thee: This is right love to God indeed.

2. Intensively. God is the highest object of love, and challenges the highest
and most intensive acts of love: God is the supreme Good; yea, the only good;
none good but one, that is God, Matthew. 19 17. therefore he should have the
supreme affections, all the affections, all of the affections, and none but he.
Quatuor in Deum (...) nobis and toti exiguntur afrectus. In eo quod dicit, ex
toro cord tuo totam sibi vendicat volontatem: in tota anima to um amorem: in
omnibus viribus, virtutem designat ^tatis: In tota mente, fruitionem

cap. 10 ad ini^.
Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
an^ with all thy strength, and with all thy minde^ Luke 10 27. Deuteronomy. 6. 5.
Matthew. 22. 37. with these four, heart, soul, might and mind and with all of
every one of these, i. e. with all that is within thee; God, if truly loved is
to be beloved of thee. Yea, let God, le^ Jesus Christ have the pre-eminence in
the soul, above all creatures let him possess the throne of thine heart, and
be a diadem on thy head; but let all things else sit down below, at thy
footstool, Prove. 12. 1. Psalm. 73. 25. and 4. 6, 7. Matthew. 10. 37. Luke 14. 26.
no object is so amiable, no delight so delectable as God to him that loves him;
true love can despise the world, yea, ten thousand worlds for him.

3. Sincerely and uprightly. When God is chiefly loved for Recedat itaque ab
animamea omnis injustitia, ut te diligam dominum deum meum ex toto cord meo,
and ex tota anima mea, and ex omnibus viribus meis: re cedat omnis zelotypia,
ne tecum aliquid amem, quo^d proptete non amem. O vere unice amor, and vere
domine: cumr vero propter te aliquid amo, non illud amo, sed te propter quem
amo quod amo, Bernard. lib. de amore dei. cap. 6. ad init.
himself, for his own incomparable Excellency, perfection, beauty, sweetness,
loveliness and love: and other things are loved for him, and in order to him;
then not so much they are loved, as God is loved in them, 1 John 4. 19. We love
him, because he loved us first. The Church loved Christ for himself, Cant. 5.
10. to the end. We may love Gods gifts, but must more love God the giver, else
our love is mercinary, not upright.

4. Purely and bolily. God is truly loved, when purely affected: we love God
purely, when we cordially hate that which God cannot love, viz. Sin. Ye that
love the Lord, hate evil, Psalm. 97. 10. Love thou him, (says Amas illum?
debes odisse quod odit. -- Hinc apparet te diligere quod bonum est, si inventus
fueri^ odisse quod malum est. D. August. Enarrat. in Ps. 96.
Augustine) thou ought to hate what he hates, -- Hence it appears thou
truly love what is good, if thou be found to hate what is evil.

5. Obedientally. When we so love God or Jesus Christ, as to endeavor really
to keep all his Commandments. If you love me, keep my Cemmandements. -- He
that has my Commandments and keeps them, he it is that loves me, John 15.
21, 23. That is, says Qui habet in memoria, and servat in vita: qui habet in
sermonibus, and servat in moribus: qui habet audiendo, and servat faciendo: aut
qui habet faciendo, and servat perseverando, Ipse est, inquit, qui diligit me.
Opere demonstranda est dilectio, ne sit infructuosa nominis Appellatio. Aug. in
Evang. Iean. Tract. 75.
Augustine, He that loves them in memory, and keeps them in life: who has
them in words, and keeps them in works: who has them in hearing, and keeps
them in doing: or who has them in doing, and keeps them in persevering, He it
is, says he, that loves me, Love is to be demonstrated by works, that (...)
be not an unfruitful usurpation of the name of love.

6. Invincibly, against all difficulties, oppositions and persecutions. Love is
strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave; the coals thereof are coals
of fire, which has a most vehement flame. Many waters cannot quench love,
neither can the floods drown it, Cant. 8. 6, 7.

7. Uncessantly in incorruption. True love to Christ will not waste, putrefie,
worm-eat or decay, but is uncorruptible: Grace be with all them that love the
Lord Jesus Christ, ((...)) in incorruption, Ephesians. 6. 24. true love is a
long-lasting, yea, an everlasting affection. Charity never fails, 1 Cor. 13.

CHAP. II.
Evidences or Signs of our Regeneration, Newbirth, Adoption, Sonship, etc.

THat the world kneweth us not, if we I.
be the children of God. Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed
upon us, that we should be called the sons of God! therefore the world knows
us not, because it knew him not, 1 John 3. 1. By [World] here understand, that
world of carnal, unregenerate persons that Non fine causa Apostolus clamat,
Seculum totum in malo positum est. (...) Johan. 5. 19. and verum est. Merito
e^im totum esse in malo dicitur, ubi boni locum habere non ^ossunt. Siquidem
ita totum iniquitatibus plenum est, ut aut ^ali sint qui sunt; aut qui boni
sunt, multorum persecutione ^tucientur, Salvian, de Gubern. Dei, lib. 4. p.
113. Oxon. 1629.
lies in wickknesse, 1 John 5. 19. elsewhere called, the children of this
world, in opposition to the children of light, Luke 16. 8. This world knows not
the heavenly Father, adopting: nor his spiritual children, adopted, yea,
therefore it knows them not, because they are the children of such a Father.
So that the worlds not knowing us in this sense, may help us to discover that
God knows us, and ownes us as his children. To know implies first, sometimes a
precise act of the mind, understanding, discerning, discovering, apprehending,
comprehending things what they are, John 21. 15. 17. 1 Cor. 8. 4. In this sense
the carnal world knows not God, nor Jesus Christ, nor the things of God,
because they are spiritually discerned, Jer. 10. 25. 1 Cor. 2. 8, 11. Nor
knows it the children of God, and what privileges, comforts and happiness
belongs unto them, and that even in this life, in the state of grace, 1 Cor. 2.
9. 2. Sometimes an act also of the will; or a joint act of the mind and will,
regarding favorably, respecting, loving, affecting, approving things known,
Psalm. 101. 4. Thus God is said to know^ the way of the righteous, Psalm. 1. 6.
Christ know^ his sheep, Job. 10. 27. and so, not to love, no^ to approve, is
not to know, Acts 7. 18. Matthew. 7. 23. and 25. 12. In this sense the carn^
world knows not God nor Christ, i. e. lov^ them not, cares not for them, but
rathe^ hates them, Exodus 5. 2. Ier. 5. 4. And the also the world knows not the
children of God; i. e. loves them not, cares not for them, but hates them,
persecutes them, etc. because such, John 15. 18, 19. 1 John 3. 12. So that the
more the world hates us for Gods sake, Christ's sake, as Christians: the more
encouragement we may have, that we are not of the world, but chosen out of the
world into Gods family, 1 Pet 4. 16, 17.

True believing that Jesus is the Christ, II.
evidenceth that we are borne of God. Whosoever believes that Jesus is the
Christ, is born of God, 1 John 5. 1. For clearing this evidence of
Regeneration, Consider these two Questions. 1. What is meant here by believing
that Jesus is the Christ? 2. Whence it may be evinced, that whosoever does
truly thus believe, is borne of God?

Quest. 1. What is it to believe that Jesus is the Christ?

Answ. Faith or believing as it relates to Christ, has especially two primary
and most remarkable acts, viz, Assenting and Applying. 1. The Assenting act of
faith, is, that whereby faith assents to Gods whole Scripture-Record touching
Jesus Christ, as true, 1 John 5. 10, 11. viz. That this Jesus which is revealed
so fully to us in the New Testament, both in his Person and Offices, is no
other then the Christ, the true Messiah, or anointed of God, that was
fore-promised, fore-prophesied of, and prefigured under all periods of the Old
Testament, from the fall of the first Adam, to the fullness of time for the
incarnation of the second Adam, to be the only Mediator betwixt God and man,
and Savior of the world. This some call Dogmaticall faith, some Historical
faith, because it barely and precisely entertaines the Doctrine and History of
Scripture as Truth: without any particular appropriation of any thing of Christ
to them that so believe. Now this bare and naked assenting act of faith, cannot
be a character of Regeneration, nor the faith here intended. For, (1.)
Hypocrites may assent to the truth of the Record which God has given touching
Christ. For we read often of the faith of such, as, Luke 8. 13. Acts 8 13.
which believing of theirs, was at least an Assent; for Assent to truth
revealed, is the least and lowest act of faith. (2.) Devils may assent to this
truth Dogmatically, That Jesus is the Christ; yea, they have assented to it,
and known it to be so. See Mar. 1. 24. Luke 4. 34, 41. Yet nor Hypocrites, nor
devils are regenerate. 2. The Applying act of faith is, that whereby faith
having assented to the truth of all Gods Record touching Christ, proceeds to
apply and appropriate all particularly to a man's self, as did Paul; Who loved
me, and gave himself for me, Gal. 2. 20. and Thomas; My Lord, and my God, John
20. 28. This appropriating act of faith, is sometimes called, believing on the
Son of God [(...) -- i. e. into the Son of God,] 1John 5. 10. believing on his
Name, (...) -- i. e. into his Name, 1 John 5. 13. John 1. 12. coming to him,
John 6. 35. receiving him, John 1. 11, 12. having the Son, 1 John 5. 12.
tasting him, 1 Pet. 2. 3. eating him, eating his flesh and drinking his blood,
John 6. 53, 54, 56, 57. compared with ver. 47. all which expressions denote
faith's appropriating of Christ unto the particular individual believing soul,
as his Christ, Priest, Prophet and King; as his Jesus, his Savior, etc. from
whom he expects and looks for, Redemption, Righteousness, Pardon, Holiness,
Adoption, Peace, Comfort, Grace, Glory, and every thing that is promised, or is
to be expected from the Messiah, as Credere quod sit Christus, est ab eo
sperare quaecunque de Messia promissa sunt. Calv. Comment. in 1. Johan. 5. 1.
Calvin well observes; To believe that Jesus is Christ, is to hope for all
those things from him, which were promised of the Messiah. This is true
justifying faith, Romans 5. 1. now this is the faith here meant; this is the true
believing that Jesus is the Christ.

Discoveries or Characters of this true faith, are many. Take these seven which
gradually depend one upon another, viz.

1. The habit of this faith is infused into the soul by God in Regeneration,
Ephesians. 2. 8. John. 1. 12, 13.

2. This habit infused is brought into act by the Fathers drawing the soul to
Christ. John 6. 44. This drawing is effected, 1. By discovering the necessity
of Christ to salvation, Acts 4. 11, 12. 2. By displaying the sufficiency and
alluring Excellency of Christ for salvation, Heb. 7. 25. Cant. 5. 10. to the
end. 3. By manifesting the possibility of obtaining Christ and salvation by
him, 1 Timothy 1. 16. 4. By propounding the willingness and readiness of God and
Christ to entertain poor sinners, Matthew. 11. 28, 29. John 7. 37. Isaiah 55. 1.
John 6. 37. Luke 15. 20. to the end. 5. By disclosing the invaluable happiness
in gaining Christ, 1 John 5. 12. John 3. 16, 18, 36. And, 6. By stirring up
ardent strong desires in the heart after Christ, that the soul is restlessely
thirsting, till he be obtained, Isa. 55. 1. John 7. 37.

3. Faith thus infused and acted, is persuaded to accept Christ upon his own
terms, viz. self-denial, bearing the Cross, and following Christ, and
actually accepts him, Luke 9. 23. John 1. 12.

4. Faith having received Christ, tastes such sweetness and pleasantness in
him, that Christ is most precious to the soul, 1 Peter 2. 3, 7. and all things
in the world are but loss and dung unto him, Phil. 3. 8. Oh, how is the soul
filled with joy and peace in believing! Romans 15. 13. and 5. 1. and so it sits
down under Christ's shadow with great delight, and his fruit is sweet unto its
taste, Cant. 2. 3.

5. Faith having thus taken and tasted Christ notably enlivens and quickens the
soul, that not so much the Believer lives, as Christ by faith lives in the
Believer, Gal. 2. 20. Romans 1. 17. Hab. 2. 4. Christ principally knows, wills,
loves, prays, and in a word performs all spiritual motions in him. Oh that is
a sweet life indeed, whereof Christ is both Author to give it, and Pilot to
guide it.

6. Faith having enlivened the soul by Christ, it notably puts forth it self in
vital operations from Christ. For true living faith, is a working and
fruit-bearing faith, as James demonstrates, James 2. 14, to the end. Now faiths
principal acts are these. 1. Cleansing and purifying the heart from all inward
filthiness, so as not to approve it, or mingle with it, Acts 15. 9. 2. Calming
and pacifying the conscience, as once Christ said to the winds and waves, so
faith in Christ says to the troubled and perplexed soul, Peace and be still,
and there is a great calm, Romans 5. 1, 2, 3. Phil. 4. 7. 3. Acting and working
by love, with a cheerful respect and delightful enlargement to all Gods
Commandments. Gal. 5. 6. 1 John 5. 3.

7. Finally, Faith having attained to this spiritual strength and activity,
contends after a fuller perfection, even after a full assurance, -- Col. 2. 2.
Heb. 10 22. Heb. 6. 11, 18, 19. which full-assurance is obtained by faith's
reflecting upon its own acts, and seeing it self believe, I know whom I have
believed, -- 2 Ti^. 1. 12. and though every believer reaches not this full
assurance nor any one retains it at all times: yet the nature of faith
contends and leads all unto it most genuinely, whence (...) non potest afide
magis avelli, qua^ asole calor and lumen. Calv. Comment. in Col. 2, 2,
Calvin was not afraid to say, that full assurance can no more be plucked from
faith, then heat or light can be severed from the Sun.

Qu. 2. Whence may it be evinced that whosoever does thereby thus believe, is
born of God? Answ. From many grounds; take a few for all. 1. This believing
thus described, is a receiving of Christ, and a believing on his Name: but
every one that receives Christ and believes on his Name, is born, not of
bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God, Joh.
1. 12, 13. What need to be said more punctually? 2. This Faith thus described
is one of the fruits of the spirit, enumerated as contra-distinct from the
works of the flesh, Gal. 5. 22. Consequently they that have this Faith, have
the regenerating Spirit in them, whence this and the other fruits flow, and so
are born of God. 3. This Faith and believing here described, is such as whereby
the believer pleases God, Heb. 11. 6. Consider well the former particulars.
Therefore they that so believe are regenerate; in the spirit, and not in the
flesh, for they that are in the flesh cannot please God, Romans 8. 8. 4. Finally,
they that believe in Christ, as has been described, shall be saved, Mark. 16.
16. Joh. 3. 16. Therefore they must needs be borne of God; for, Except a man be
^orn again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom ^f God, Joh. 3. 3, 5.

The not committing of sin, is the proper^y III.
of such as are truly regenerate. He that ^mitteth sin, is of the devil, for
the devil ^nneth from the beginning; for this purpose the Son of God was
manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil. Whosoever is ^orn of
God, does not commit sin: for his seed ^maineth in him, and he cannot sin,
because he (...) borne of God, 1 John 3. 8, 9. This note about ^ing, is for
greater cleerenesse, and more ^phaticalnesse, laid down, Affirmatively, ^d
Negatively: by that, detecting the children of the divil; by this, the children
of God. Contraries paralleled serve to illustrate one another.

1. Affirmatively, ver. 8. where consider, ^st, The Position it self. He that
commits (...), is of the devil. i. e. He is the child of the (...), and the
devil his father, as, Ioh. 8. 44. and ^lkes according to the course of this

works in the children of ^obedience. Ephesians. 2. 2. For this phrase [is (...) the
divel] is here opposed to that [is born (...) God, ver. 1, 9] 2. The
confirmation of it, by double Argument, viz. 1. From the devils ^ostasie, for
the devil sins from the Vide Estium in sentent. l. (...) Distinct. (...)
Sect. 3. 4, 5
begin^ i. e. The devil sinned from the beginning of the world, compare, Ioh.
8. 44. wi^ Jude 6. He was the very first sinner in the world, and the cause of
all other sinners (...) the world. He drew his Apostate Ange^ with him; hence
probably that phrase the D^ vil and his Angels, Mat. 25. 41. He deceive^ our
first parents in the Serpent, and (...) brought sin upon all the world, Genesis 3.
An^ still, he as a roaring Lion walks about, see^ ing whom he may destroy, 1
Pet. 5. 8. Nor^ it said, he sinned; but (...) he sinne^ from the beginning, i.
e. indefinently, an^ with one continued act, as (...). quasi dicat indefinenter
and continuo actu. Pisc^t. in 1 Ioh. 3. 8 Non dicit peccavit sed peccat, nam in
eo assidue perseverat, sicut and ipsius filii. Huic opponitur qui non modo non
peccat, sed etiam venit ut peccatadissolveret. Bez. Annot. in col.
some we^ observe. Sin is the devils continual trad^ without cessation or
intermission. No^ the devil being such a sinner from the begi^ ning: they that
commit sin (as mere natu^ men do,) must needs be the children of the devil.
This the first Argument. 2. From Christ office, or the end of his first coming
into the world. viz. To destroy the works of the d^ vil. Sin is the proper
work of the dev^ Christ destroyed both, By the virtue a^ sufficiency of his
merit, for all his elect at onc^ Romans 8. 3. And By the vigor and efficien^ of
his Spirit, Romans 8. 2, 13. for every one (...) his elect respectively when
effectually calle^ So that hence it must needs follow, the those persons, in
whom the dominion a^ power of sin is not subdued by Christ, b^ they still
commit sin, they so continuing (...) still remain the children of the devil;
the present state is damnable.

2. Negatively, verse 9. where also note. 1. The Position it self containing
the Character of such as are borne of God; Whosoever is borne of God, does not
commit sin, which also may thus be converted, Whosoever commits not sin, is
borne of God. 2. The Confirmation of the Position by a double Argument. 1. A
causa conservante, from the conserving cause in him that keeps him from
sinning, for his seed remains in him. By seed here, 1. Some understand the
^raduction of the divine essence to the Saints; whom therefore Beza deservedly
brands as most ridiculous fanatic persons, for this ^bsurd dream. 2. Some
understand by seed the Spirit of God, by whom we are regenerated, and our
corruptions and flesh subdued, so that we walk not after the flesh, but after
the Spirit. (...)] Metaphorice de signat Spiritum sanctum, cujus vire gignimur

the stream of Interpreters runs this way. 3. Some finally by ^eed
understand the Word and Spirit together; the Word effectually applied and
actuated by the operation of the Spirit; and this seems fullest: For the
Scripture compa^ the word to seed, because it is Gods isntrumental Ordinance
for our Regeneration, Being borne again, not of corruptible seed, but of
incorruptible, by the Word of God, which lives and abides for ever, 1 Pet. 1.
23. And this Word of God abiding in the heart, written there, is a most
prevalent Antidote against Sin. Thy Word have I bid in my heart, that I might
not sin against thee, Psa. 119. 11. So that the regenerate sins not,
because his seed remains in him, i. e. Gods Wordcast into the heart by the
operation of the Spirit, making a man to spring into a new creature, As that
learned Mr. Perkins in his case of Conscience. called The first Ep. of John in
form of a Dialogue Vol. 1. p. 425. Lon. 1626.
Master Perkins has observed. Thus of the first Argument. 2. Ab impossibili,
from the impossibility of his so sinning, that is born of God, and that from
the state and nature of his regeneration; and he cannot sin, because he is
borne of God, whereby he intimates that a sinful course and a state of grace
are wholly incompatible and inconsistent with one another. Here the Apostle
rises higher in his expression; clearly pronouncing, that the hearts of the
godly are so efficaciously governed by his Spirit, that with an inflexible
affection, they follow the conduct of the Spirit. -- The Apostle does not only
teach that the regenerate are able not to sin (...) but that the motion of the
Spirit is so effectual, that it necessarily retains them in the constan^
obedience of righteousness. As Joh. Calvin. Comment. in loc.
Calv. observes, not unsuitable to this of John, is the tenor of the Covenant
of grace, I will put my fear in their hearts, and they shall not depart from
me, Jer. 32. 40.

Thus much for the distribution and explication of this cotext, wherein [not
sinning] is made a note of regeneration. Now because this is a grand evidence
of being born of God, that all such sin not, nor can sin: and because this has
much difficulty in it; as seeming to cross, not only the experience of all
regenerate persons (who feel they sin frequently, to the grief of their
souls,) but also diverse Scriptures, Psa. 19. 12, 13. Romans 7. 15, 23, 24. Iam.
3. (...). 1 Ioh. 1. 8, 9, 10. Therefore this is the prin^ipall thing here to be
opened and cleared convincingly to the Conscience, viz.

How or in what sense, He that is borne of ^od, does not commit sin, nor can
sin?

For more clear Resolution herein, consi^er this thing, Negatively, and
Affirmatively. Negatively, when the Apostle says, He that born of God, does
not commit sin, nor can sin. ^ereby cannot be meant (as some have hence
^agined,) that the regenerate have no sin, all inherent in them, nor committed
by ^em; but are perfectly holy even in this ^e. As of old the e Rogers on
Artic. 15. of Church of ^ngland, p. 64.
Maniche^s and Cathari ^ought they could not so much as sin in ^ought. The
Pelagians and Familists i^gined themselves so free from sin, that they needed
not to pray, forgive us our trespasses. The Adamites deemed themselv^s as pure
as Adam and Eve before their fa^. And the Carpocratians dreamed that they were
as free from sin as Christ himsel^e. Yea, even in these our days, See the
Testimony, etc. of the London Ministers, p. 16. 17. evidencing all these
some have held That he that believes that Christ has ta^ away his sin, is as
clean without sin as Christ himself. -- That, It is as possible for Christ
himself to sin, as for a child of God to sin. -- That, If a man by the
Spirit know himse^. to be in the state of grace, though he be dr^, or commit
murder, God sees no sin in him; -- That, as well our works as persons, are
perfectly holy and good. -- That, a Saint (...) this life, without any addition
hereafter, is perfectly just, perfectly holy, completely glorious (...) this
life, and is not capable of any addition (...) ter death in the least degree,
but only of man festation.

Against these fond and false imagination observe.

1. That the holy Scripture expressly tes^ fies the contrary, viz. That the
most holy a^ regenerate persons in this life, have in the^ Sin Original, and
hence ^oo often fall i^ sin act^all. Who can underistand his error Psalm. 19.
12. Who can s^y, I have made (...) bear, clean, I am pure from my sin? Pro.
(...) 9. There i^. no man (...) sins not, 1 K^ 8. 46. 2. Chron. 6. 36. In
many things sin all, James (...). 2. There is not a just man on earth that does
good, and sins not, Eccles^y. 20. If we say that we have no sin [viz.
originally] we deceive our selves. and the truth is not in us. -- If we say we
have not sinned, [viz. actually] we make him a liar, and his word is not in us,
1 John 1. 8, 10.

2. The universal experience of the best of God, Saints in all ages, evidences
that none of them all have been without sin in this life. Not Abraham, Genesis
12. 13, 19. and 20. 2, 5. Not Isaac, Genesis 26. 7, 9. Not Jacob, Genesis 27. 19, 20,
24. Not Moses and Aaron, Psalm. 106. 33. Deuteronomy. 32. 50, 51. Exodus 32. 2, 21. Not
David, Psalm. 51. 1, to 10. and 38. 3, 4. Not Peter, Matthew. 26. 33, 34, 35, 70,
to the end, Gal. 2. 11, 12, 13, Not Paul himself, Romans 7. 18, 20, 23, 24, 25.

3. The nature of grace and sanctification in this life, is at perfectest but
imperfect and growing on to perfection, 1 Cor. 13. 9, 10. Phil. 3. 12, 13.
consequently, Constat sic inchoari in nobis regenerationem, ut ad morte usque
veteris hominis reliquiae maneant. Quod si nondum plena est ac solida
regeneratio, non nisi pro modo suo a peccati servitute nos eximit, etc. Calv.
com. in 1 John: 3. 9.
mortification is imperfect. Some Canaanites are still in the land; though the
Kings are distroyed. There is a remnant of flesh, as well as a principle of
spirit, Gal. 5. 17. The Church is not actually purged, but in purging from all
defilements, and at last there shall be no spot nor wrinkle, nor any such
thing, Ephesians. 5. 26, 27. Only the man Christ Jesus in this world was without
sin, Heb. 4. 15. Isa. 53. 9. Heb. 7. 26. 2 Cor. 5. 21.

4. Complete purity from sin, and perfection of holiness is a glory, though to
be desired on earth, yet reserved for heaven, Romans 6. 7. Ephesians. 5. 27. Heb. 12.
23. Rev. 21. 27.

5. Unto all which might be added the plentiful suffrage of Nemo esse sine
delicto potest, quamdiu indumento carnis oneratus est, Lactant. de vero cultu,
lib. 6. c. 13.
Ancient Writers; take the sense of two or three for all. Lactantius Firmianus,
says, None can be without sin, so long as he is burdened with the clothing of
flesh. Si autem extorior facit quod non vult, and operatur quod odit, osteudit
bonum esse mand^um, and non se operari quod malum est, sed habitans in sua
carne peccatum, hoc est, vitia corporis, and desideria voluptatis. Hieornym.

Hierom says, If the outward man do what it would not, and acts what it hates,
it shows that the Command is good, and that he acts not what is evil, but
sin dwelling in his flesh, i. e. the vices of the body, and desires of
pleasune. * Augustine says, Search every one, though most righteous in this
life, though he be worthy of the title of a just man, yet is he not without
sin. And a little after: Whatsoever is sin, is formerly blotted out of us in
baptism; but because all iniquity is blotted out, does no infirmity remain;
if none remain, we shouid live here without sin; but who dare say this but a
proud man? but one unworthy of the mercy of the pardoner? but he that will
deceive him self, and in whom the truth is not? And in his book of the City of
God, he says, Verba tanti magistri and Domini nostri vigilanter inmenda sunt.
Non enim ait; Si dimisoritis peccata hominibus, and Pater vester dimitte vobis
qualiacunque peccata; sed ait, peccata vestra. Quodi lianam quippe orationem
docebat, and justificatis utique discipulis loquebatur. Quid est ergo [peccat^
vestra] nisi peccata sine quibus nec vos estis qui justificati and sanct^ficati
estis? August. de Civit. Dei. lib. 21. cap. 27.
The words of such a master and our Lord are vigilantly to be considered; for
he says not, If you forgive men their sins, your Father will also forgive you
what sins soever; but he says, your sins. For he taught adaily prayer, and
spoke to disciples justified. What is therefore [your sins] but the sins,
without which, even you are not, who are justified and sanctified? Blessed Quam
necessario, quam providenter and salubritet admonemur, quod peccatores sumus,
qui pro peccatis rogare compellimur, ut dum indulgentia de Deo petitur,
conscientiae suae animus recordetur? Ne quis sibi quasi inocens placeat, cum
innocens nemo sit and se extollendo plus pereat: instruitur and docetur peccare
se quotidie, dum quotidie pro peccatis jubetur orare. D. Cypriar. de oratione
Domin. Sect, 16. p. 314 le Preur. 1563.
Cyprian also, that valiant Confessor and glorious Martyr of Jesus Christ,
writing upon that Petition of the Lords prayer, And forgiveius our trespasses,
etc. says, How necessarily, how providently and wholesomely are we admonished
that we are sinners; who are urged to beg s^ our sins; that whilst a pardon
is asked of God, our mind may be remembered of it is guiltiness. Lest any
should please himself as if he were innocent, when there is none innocent; and
by extolling himself, should be in more danger of perishing: he is instructed
and taught that himself sins daily, whilst he is daily commanded to pray for
his sins pardon.

Affirmatively, They that are borne of God de not commit sin, nor can sin as
they do, and cannot choose but de, who remain unregenerate, and continue the
children of Satan. This position will comprehend the full sense of the Apostle,
(who here plainly opposes the regenerate to the unregenarate, the children and
issue of God to the children and issue of the devil, and this peculiarly in the
point of committing or not committing of sin) and take in all the several
interpretations which are opposite and pertinent to the clearing of this place.
Consider therefore, though both the children of God, and the children of the
devil sin: yet there is a vast disparity and manifold difference betwixt the
sinning of the one, and of the other; whereby we may clearly according to
Scripture, distinguish betwixt the regenerate and the unregenerate: as,

I. They that are regenerate commit not sin, nor can sin against the
Gospel-Remedy. Jesus Christ is the Gospel-Remedy, Act. 4. 12. The going on in a
state of unbelief and impenitency, not accepting of Christ by faith and
repentance, as a Savior and Mediator, is sinning against this Gospel-Remedy,
Mark. 1. 15. Act. 2. 38. with 16. 31. John 1. 11, 12. with 3. 18, 36. and 16.
9. Now no truly regenerate person can thus sin against Christ, putting him away
from them by unbelief and impenitency; because in that they are regenerate, it
is inevitably employed that they actually have believed and repented already;
for repentance and faith are ingredients inseparable from regeneration, John.
1. 12, 13.

But every regenerate man, whilst such, still sins against the Gospel-remedy,
J. Christ, in not accepting him for salvation, John. 1. 11, 12, 13. John. 3.
18, 36. and 16. 9. Luke 19. 14, 27. And they cannot choose but thus sin against
Christ by infidelity, because they are unregenerate, Romans 8. 8.

II. Hence, They that are born of God, commit not sin, nor can sin, as persons
under the absolute Power, Reign and Dominion of sin. Sin may oft-times rebel
in them, ye^, sometimes tyrannize over them: as, Romans 7. 23. Gal. 5. 17. But it
does not reign in them, Romans 6. 6, 11. 18. and 8. 2. The reign of sin
discovers it self chiefly in two respects, as the Apostle teaches, Romans 6.
12, 13. viz. 1. When men willingly obey it in the lusts thereof: when the first
motions, sustings and stirrings of sin in them are listened and assented to,
approved, delighted in, etc. A King is willingly obeyed by his subjects; a
Tyrant is obeyed unwil^ingly. The regenerate they sin not willingly, but rather
against their wills, Romans 7. 15, 19. 2. When men readily take up arms for sin,
and fight for sin to fulfill it, viz. when they yield their members (whether
inward faculties of soul, or outward parts of their bodies) as arms or
weapons of unrighteousness unto sin fighting against the motions of the
Spirit, commands of the Word, etc. When men thus readily fight sins battles,
they are sins servants, under sins reign and dominion; As men under the reign
of a King, readily take up arms for him; but under the usurpation of a Tyrant,
they are readier to fight against him then for him. Now the regenerate do not
fight for sin, nor yield their faculties and members to the service of it, but
war snd strive against it. Romans 7. 23, 24. Gal. 5. 17. Romans 8. 13.

But on the contrary, unregenerare men, both (1) readily obey sins commands;
obey it in the lusts thereof, Romans 6. 19. Ephesians. 2. 2, 3. Tit. 3. 3. and (2.) as
readily take up arms for sin, yielding their members weapons of
unrighteousness unto sin; and cannot choose but so do, they cannnt cease from
sin. 2 Pet. (...). 14. They are (...). verbum (...) propre est (...), seu
(...), i. e. vivum cari, idque tanquam venando Pisc. schol. in loc.
captived-alive (like wild beasts in a trap by the hunter) by Satan at his
will. 2 Timothy 2. 25, 26.

III. Hence, They that are borne of God commit not sin, nor can sin [Voluntate
plena, sed semi-plena.] with a whole will, but as it were with an half will,
an unwilling willingness: not with a full consent, but with a dissenting
consent, with much renitency and reluctance; not with a total delight of
heart, but with an unpleasing delightfulness. The evil that I would not do,
that I do, Romans 7. 19. When the will of a regenerate person has so far
consented to sin as to act it: yet even in acting it, there remains in the
will an inclination and principle to act against it: for there is in the womb
of the believing soul a Jacob and an Esau, a good and bad part; habits of
grace infused, and relics of sin unmortified in every regenerate person; and
this in every faculty and affection of soul. Some saving light in the mind,
and yet some carnal darkness; some holy dispositions in the will, and yet
some unholy inclinations, etc. So far as the heart and will is regenerate, so
far it hates sin and declines it; so far as it is unregenerate, so far it
loves sin, and in, clines unto it; hence the Apostle said, that which I do I
allow not: for what I would, that do I not: but what I hate, that I do. -- Now
then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwells in me, Romans 7. 15, 17.
No more I, viz. not I, so far as regenerate, as spirirituall. A regenerate
man as regenerate, commits not sin, nor can sin; grace produces not sin, nor
the Spirit flesh; such as is the cause, such is the effect; grace acts
g^aciously; Spirit, spiritually; as flesh acts carnally, sinfully. Hence from
these two contrary parties within the regenerate, arises a constant spiritual
combat betwixt the flesh and Spirit. The flesh lusts against the Spirit, and
the Spirit lusts against the flesh; and these two are contrary the one to the
other, Gal. 5. 17. Now where there is this lusting and combating against
corruption, there can be no full and total consent of heart, or compliance of
will with corruption.

But unregenerate persons contrariwise commit sin with full consent of will,
with total inclination of heart; for they have no principle of grace within,
to withold them from fin; but only principles of corruption to impell and
push them upon sin: the regenerate have sin in them; the unregenerate have
nothing else but sin in them: yea, they are in the flesh, i. e. wholly plunged,
ingulfed, swallowed up of the flesh. Romans 8. 5, 8. yea, they are nothing but
flesh, Ioh. 3. 6. Now they being mere flesh, no spiritually good thing dwells
in them, Romans 7. 18. yea, every thing in them is evil, Genesis 6. 5. Consequently
they cannot choose but commit sin most willingly, having nothing in them to
bridle, cross or contradict their corruptions.

IV. H^nce, they that are borne of God, commit not sin, nor can sin,
Presumptuously and with wilful obstinacy. If they sin not with a complete
willingness, much less do they sin with an obstinate wilfulness: yea, they
are afraid of sinning, proudly and presumptuously, with insolency, contempt and
contumacy against God, and therefore pray against it, as David, Keep back thy
servant also from Intelligit per insolentias, manifest^ delicta seuapertas
transgressiones, quibus adjuncta est con tumacia; quas vocat superbias and
arrogantlas, eo quod temerario ausu ac fastu, cum Dei and hominu^
conte^ptusiant contumaciter. Quasi diceret, non possu^t omniapeccata vi^ari;
sed mi Deus, custodi me, ne dedita opera sciens and volens grave quid and
enorme admi^tam. Andr. Rjvet. Comment. in Psalm. 19. v. 14.
presumptuous sins, let them not have dominion over me, -- Psalm. 19. 13. Their
sins are rather sins of infirmities then of insolency; sins of weakness
rather then of wilfulness; they do not so much overtake faults as faults
overtake them. If any man be overtaken in a fault, Gal. 6. 1. [(...)] here
properly signifies, If a man be anticipated, prevented or surprised unawares,
by sin: viz. before he considered his danger, or sins deceit, or how to fortify
himself against the temptation. Gods children may sometimes fall into pride
and into gross sins; but its not their manner to sin contumaciously and
contemptuously against God.

But unregenerate persons are wont to sin presumptuously. Presumption, or
sinning presumptuously seems to imply, (1.) A man's vain selfconfidence of his
own safe and good estate present and future, upon occasion of Gods patience and
providentiall blessings abused; whereupon he encourages himself to go on in
ways of sin, (2.) Securely, (3.) Wilfully, (4.) Haughtily, and (5.)
Contemptuously against God; his Word, and judgments; it seems to be made up
principally of these five ingrediens, which lively also describe unto us the
way of sin which unregenerate men usually walk in.

1. Self-confidence of a man's safe and good estate present or future; The
wicked flattereth himself in his own eyes, Psalm. 36. 1, 2. Certain that
trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others. -- God I
thank thee that I am not as other men are, Luke 18. 9, 11, 12. And it come to
pass when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his
heart, saying, I shall have heace, though I walk in the imagination of mine
heart to add drunknes to thirst, -- Deuteronomy. 29. 19, 20. This vain
self-confidence usually arises from abuse of Gods patience and providentiall
goodness and blessings: Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not
God, Psalm. 55. 19. And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out
substance; in all my labors they shall find none iniquity in me, that were
sin, Hos. 12. 8. The wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power. Their
seed is established in their sight with them, -- etc. Therefore they say unto
God, Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. What is the
Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have if we pray
unto him? Job. 21. 7, to 16. See also Psalm. 73. 7, 8, 9, 12. Luke 12. 16, to 21.

2. Security. From self-confidence it is that they go on securely without
remorse or fear in ways of sin. Soul, thou have much goods laid up for many
years, eat, drink, and be meary, Luke 12. 19. The transgression of the wicked
says within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes, -- Psalm.
36. 1, 2. Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill our selves
with strong drink, and to morrow shall be as this day, and much more abundant,
Isai. 56. 12. Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we die, 1 Cor. 15. 32. Thus
they that sin presumptuously, sin securely.

3. Wilfulness, obstinacy, resolvednesse in sin, is another poison wherewith
presumption of wicked men is tempered. They that will be rich, -- 1 Timothy 6. 9
We will not have this man to reign over us, Luke 19. 14, 27. As for the word
that thou have spoken to us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto
thee; but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goes out of our own mouth, --
Jer. 44. 17.

4. Pride and haughtiness also is intwisted in presumption. Wicked men sin
proudly, disdainfully, with an high hand and much insolency; Who is the Lord,
said Pharaoh, Exodus, 5. 2. Who is the Almighty that we should serve him? said
those wretches, Job. 21. 15. Their tongue speaks proud things. Who have said,
With our tongue will we prevail, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?
Psalm. 12. 3, 4. They speak wickedly concerning oppression, they speak
loftily, they set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walks
through the earth. -- Behold, these are the ungodly who prosper in the world,
-- Psalm. 73. 8, 9, 12.

5. Finally, Contempt and contumacy against God, his Word, and judgments, is
found in wicked men's presumption. Wherefore does the wicked contemn God?
Psalm. 10. 13. Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from
us, Psalm. 2. 3. But unto the wicked God says What have thou to do to declare
my statutes, seeing thou hate instruction, and castest my words behind thee?
Psalm. 50. 16, 17. Thus the unregenerate sin presumptuously, viz.
Self-confidently, Securely, Wilffully, Haughtily and Contumaciously against
God. Yet these evils discover themselves more palpably and remarkably in some
unregenerate persons then in others. Whereas they that are borne of God do not
thus commit sin, nor can sin.

V. They that are born of God do not commit sin, nor can sin habitually,
customarily; sin is not their ordinary, usual and common course, not their
practice, trade, or business, etc. It is one thing (...), i. e. to sin,
another thing, (...) i. e. to do or practice sin. That may proceed from
inevitable, invincible infirmity, and is incident to the best of Saints: This
flows from sins dominion, and reigning prevalency, and is peculiar to persons
unregenerate. And in this sense the current of Interpreters do anderstand this
pharse of John, 1 Ioh. 3. 9. Whosoever is born of God [(...)] peccatum non
facit, acts not sin. Transl. ver. and Calv. Peccato non dat operam, gives,
not diligence to sin, Beza and Piscat. Sins not. Genev. Transl. But better
our last English Transl. Does not commit sin. And Beza (...). Dave operam
peccato and purificare se, opponuntur. Itaque (...) differt hoc loco ab (...)
simpliciter accepto: sed de ^s demum dicitur qui non imbecilitate virium
Spiritus nec etiam quicunque scientes peccant, sed qui etiam vel ab aliis, vel
a sua ipsorum conscientia reprehensi ipsi malo plane delectantur, and in quibus
propterea dicitur illud peccatum peccans regnare: idque ita esse, non modo
liquet ex antithesi, sed etiam ex eo quod supra commemoravit, 1. 8. and 2. 1.
ex tota denique Scriptura, and rei ex perientia perpetua. Itaque non homines,
sed monstra hominum, sunt Pela^iani, Cathari, C^lestiani, Donatistae,
Anabaptistae, Libertini, qui ex hoc loco perfectionem illam somniant, a qua
absunt ipsi omnium hominum longissime. Bez. Annot. in 1 John. 3. 4.
well observes upon this chapter, that to commit sin, and to purify our selves,
are opposed agoinst one another, 1 John 3. 3, 4. and therefore it denotes not
such asinning as falls out through imbecility of the Spirits strength in us,
nor every sinning against knowledge: but such sinning as is both against che^ks
of others, and their own consciences, wherein they are plainly delighted, and
in whom consequently sin reigns. In this sense the regenerate commit not sin,
Aliud est in Johanne peccare and peccatum facere; hoc est, concupiscentias
pravas and desideria peccatricis carnis perficere: aliud vero peccatum habere,
hoc est, concupiscentiae motus sentire. Felix anima, quae sentiens peccatum non
consentit peccato. Ger-^oc. Com. Tom. II. De peccatis actualibus cap. 20.
[(...),] he is rather a patient then an agent in sin. Sin is rather a
stranger, a traveller that occasionally comes to him, 2 Samuel 12. 4. then a
familiar associate in whom he habitually delights.

Now he that is truly born of God cannot sin habitually, habitual sinning being
so inconsisten with a regenerate condition; For,

1. Habitual sinning flows from the inward * dominion of sin in the soul, as
habitual keeping Gods commandments from the inward dominion of grace. They
that are after the flesh, do mind (viz. habitually) the things of the flesh:
but they that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit, Romans 8. 5.
Sinning habitually flows from the reign of sin, the state of sin: sinning out
of frailty or infirmity, frnm the relics of indwelling sin, of rebelling
sin.

Now sin though it do [habitare] dwell in the regenerate, as Austin notes, yet
it does not [regnare,] reign over the regenerate. See Romans 6. 14. and 8. 2.

2. They that sin habitually, they make sin their trade, their common course
and practice, they are workers of iniquity, Matthew. 7. 23. Luke 13. 27 an heart
they have exercised with covetous practices, here is their exercise, 2 Pet. 2.
14.

But regenerate persons are opposed to workers of iniquity, being workers of
righteousness, doing the will of their Father which is in heaven, Matthew 7. 21.
Herein they exercise themselves to have a conscience void of offense toward
God and toward man, Acts 24. 16. Their (...), their business, their
conversation is in heaven Phil. 3 20.

3. They that sin habitually, sin easily, readily, smoothly, etc. without
difficulty. Habits facilitate any thing, make it easy. He that has the habit
of writing, the habit of wrestling, the habit of any manufacture, etc. can
write, wrestle, work. etc. with ease; it is no trouble or difficulty to him. So
they that are habituated to sin, sin easily, they run to all excess, -- 1
Pet. 4. 4. Their feet are swift to shed blood, etc. Romans 3. 15. they run a full
carear, without stop, like a ship under sail with a full wind.

Now the regenerate, when they are overtaken with sin, they do it aegre, sin is
difficult, grievous and hateful in their eyes, what I hate, that do I, Romans 7.
15. there is much reluctancie, renitencie, and holy struggling of the regenerate
part against it, Gal. 5. 17. it goes against the hair, against the stream
with them, therefore they sin not habitually.

4. They that sin habitually, they sin with pleasure and delight. They have
chosen their own ways, [imply habitualnesse] and their soul delights in
their abominations, Isa. 66. 3. Scorners [that implies the habit] delight in
scorning, Prove. 1. 22. they are apt to take pleasure in doing that which they
can do easily, smoothly: have small pleasure in that which is harsh and
difficult; yea, they glory in sin, Phil. 4. 19.

Now the regenerate delight not in sin, take not pleasure in it, etc. but hate
it, Romans 7. 15. Psalm. 119. 104. abhor it, Psalm. 119. 163. bewail it and
bitterly mourn for it, Psalm. 6. and 38. But they delight in God, in his laws,
in his ways, Psalm. 37. 4. Cant. 2. 3. * Consuetudo quasi secunda, and quasi
affabricata natura dicitur. August. lib. 6. de Music.
Psalm. 119. 16, 35. Romans 7. 22. Psalm. 40. 8.

5. They that sin habitually, have contracted to themselves a kind of cursed
necessity of sinning, that they cannot cease their sinning: Sin is by custom
become as another nature, which cannot be laid aside^. They may as soon cease
living, or cease being, Quia peccando cessare nesciant. B^z. Annot. In^ ^d
peccandum. Calv in loc. Incessab les peccati. Iac. Laurent. in col.
as cease sinning. Hence Peter describe^ the heretical seducers of which he
prophesies, 2 Pet. 2. 1, 14. as having eyes full of adultery [or Gr. full of
the whore] and that cannot cease from sin, (...) i. e. which know not how to
cease from sinning. Bez. Restless to sinning, who are intemperately carried on
to sinning with (...) restless motion. Calv. unceaseable (...) sin. Laurent.
i. e. quite unable to cease sinning. Notably Solomon describes the way of the
wicked; They sleep not except they have done mischief, and their sleep is taken
away unless they cause some to fall, Prove. 4. 14 16. as if mischief were more
natural to them then their necessary sleep. Carnal men are so captivated by
Satan. 2 Timothy 2. 25. Ephesians. 2. 2, 3. In such thraldom and bondage to iniquity,
Acts 8. 13. Romans 6. 16, 17. and this thraldom is so strengthened and
aggravated by the deceits and graduall growth^ of sin. (1.) Suggestion winning
consent. (2.) Consent procuring acts. (3.) Many acts breeding an habit. (4.)
Habits growing unto custom. And (5.) Custom becoming an inevitable
necessity; that how can it be possible that carnal men should cease from sin?

Now no such cursed necessity of sinning lies upon them that are borne of God:
for they can cease to sin; the thief converted ceased to revile and blaspheme
Christ, and instead thereof justifies him, confesses him, prays to him, trusts
in him, Luke 23. 40, 41, 42. Saul converted, ceased to make havoc of the
Church, and to persecute Christ in his members; and instead thereof builds up
the Church by preaching Christ crucified, Act. 9. 19, 20. yea, they can keep
themselves (by grace received) from their iniquity, to which they are most
inclined or tempted, or wherein they have been most ensnared, Psalm. 18. 22.
yea, they can combat with the flesh, C^l. 5. 17. and do hate every false way,
Psalm. 119. 104.

VI. They that are borne of God, do not sin, nor can sin so as to allow,
approve or cherish themselves wittingly and knowingly in any one darling sin,
bosom sin, or Beloved corruption predominating in the soul above all the
rest. God requires the denial of all ungodliness and worldly lusts, Tit. 2.
10, 11. And they hate every false way, Psalm. 119. 104. This was to David an
evidence of his integrity before God. ^was also upright bofore him, and kept my
self from mine iniquity, Psalm. 18. 22. viz. I kept my self from that sin,
which I might more specially call mine as being naturally more inclined to it;
or being occasionally by reason of my calling, adversaries, afflictions or
temptations more solicited, seduced, provoked to it, as ^aul with others often
provoked him to revenge etc.

The regenerate have in them the root of all sin, original corruption and;
(1.) may thence be inclined to one sin more then to another; (2.) may fall into
invincible infirmities daily* yea (3.) may sometimes fall into gross sins, as
Noah, Lot, David: yea, perhaps: (1.) may have diverse relapses (which yet is
very sad and dangerous) into the same offense, as Peter thrice denied Christ.
But notwithstanding all this they dare not ^allow themselves in any one known
sin, though as dear as right hand or right eye.

But unregenerate men and hypocrites have still reserves in their seeming
repentance. Though they forgo many sins, yet still they retain some secret
bosom beloved sin or other; which they cannot endure to deny. As the young man
his inordinate love to the world, Matthew. 19. 22. The Pharisees, their
covetousness, Luke 16. 14. Matthew. 23. 14. Herod, his incestuous course with
Herodias, Mark. 6. 17, 18, 19, 20. One Devil or other still remains uncast
out, keeps possession, and exercises dominion over the unregenerate soul.

VII. They that are borne of God, sin not, nor can sin totally and finally. Not
to call, (1.) either in respect of the Subject sinning; for they sin not with a
total and full consent of heart and will, but with an incomplete consent, as
was evidenced before, Number. 3. p. 41. (2.) Or in respect of the Object, Rule, or
Law against which the sin; they sin not totally against the whole Law of faith;
though they have many fears, doubts, jealousies, and infirmities in believing,
yet they believe and have received Christ by believing being borne of God, Ioh.
1. 12, 13. And they can truly say with him, Lord, I believe, help my unbelief,
Mark. 9. 24. Nor do they totally sin against the whole Law of obedience; for
though they may offend against this or that Precept, (yea, against every one of
them in some sort, in respect of the legal exactness and accuratenesse
required, Gal. 3. 13. Which no mere man since the fall of Adam could ever
reach unto, Gal. 3. 21. 22. Romans 8. 3.) Yet in respect of the Evangelical
acceptance, they walk in all the commandments of God blameles, Luke 1. 6. The
righteousness of the Law being fulfilled in them, (through Christ) who walk
not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, Romans 8. 4. The Law is written in
their heart, Psalm. 40. 8. Jerem. 31. 33. And from that principle within, they
delight to do the whole Law; the frame and disposition of their soul respects
the whole* Romans 7. 22. Psalm. 119. 6. So that as a wicked man in respect of the
disposition of his heart may be truly said to break the whole Law, even whilst
in outward act he seems to keep it: so the regenerate man may be said in
respect of the habit and disposition of his heart to keep the whole Law, even
then when in outward act he seems to break it.

Nor Finally; Such as are borne of God may fall, and foully fall: but not
finally fall away; they always sooner or later rise again by repenting. David
Multi volunt cadere cum David, sed nolunt surgete cum David. Aug. enarrat. in
Psalm. 50.
fell, 2 Samuel 11. but David rose again, 2 Samuel 12. 13. Psalm. 51. Peter fell,
Mat. 26. 70, (...) 75. But Peter recovered himself; remembered the words of
Christ; went out and wept bitterly, Matthew. 26. 75. And afterward stuck so
faithfully to Christ, that he thrice confessed him, Ioh. 21. 15, 16, 17. and at
last by a bloody martyrdom glorified God, John 21. 18, 19.

Nor is it possible that the truly regenerate should finally fall. For, 1. The
nature of grace in them is for the substance of it incorruptible and
unperishable; called seed remaining in them, 1 John 3. 9. And eternal life,
John 17. 3. and 6. 54. 1 John 5. 13. called eternal, a part post; because
though it had beginning, yet it never shall have end. 2. They are founded upon
a sure rock that cannot be shaken by tribulations, or all the powers of
darkness, Matthew. 16. 18. and 7. 24, 25. 3. They are preserved and kept by the
power of God to salvation, kept-as-in-a-garrison, for so here the military
term [(...)] properly signifies, as is evident 2 Cor. 11. 32. And they are
engarrisoned, not by men, Angels, or creatures; but by the power of God, 1 Pet.
1. 5. Hence they are invincible and impregnable; My Father which gave them me,
is greater then all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers hand,
John 10. 29. 4. Finally, the promises of God are sure and cannot fail, 2 Cor.
1. 20. And these promises assure the regenerate of perseverance; My sheep hear
my voice, -- and I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish:
neither shall any man pluck them out of mine hand, John. 10. 28. All that the
Father gives me, shall come to me: and him that comes to me, I will in no
wise cast out, (...), A double negative, for greater emphasis, John. 6 37. I
will never leave thee, nor forsake thee, Heb. 13. 5. In Greek here are five
negatives to the word; It might be rendered thus, I will not not leave thee,
neither will I not not forsake thee: viz. I am peremptorily and absolutely
resolved never to cast thee off or forsake thee.

But on the contrary, unregenerate men so remaining, sin totally, and finally.

Totally, with their whole heart and full consent of will, they being totally
carnal, as was showed before: and against the whole Rule or Law of both Faith
and Obediance; of Faith; by not believing in Christ, and receiving him, John.
16. 9. and 1. 11. And of Obedience, being children of disobedience, fulfilling
the wills of the flesh, etc. Ephesians. 2. 2, 3. Yea, the carnal mind is enmity
against, God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be,
Romans 8. 7. So that they have a disposition of heart to sin against the whole
Law, and do accordingly put this disposition into act and execution, where they
have opportunity, and are not restrained, running to all excess of riot, 1
Pet. 4. 4.

Finally also they sin without sincere repentance or reformation; formally they
may seem to repent, as Ahab, 1 Kings 21. 27, 29. Judas, Matthew. 27. 3, 4, 5, But
they only seem to repent. For really, they would (if it were possible) sin
ever, and repent never; but after their hardness and impenitent heart,
treasure up to themselves wrath against the day of wrath, Romans 2. 5. They hate
instruction, and cast Gods words behind them, Psalm. 50. 16, 17.

VIII. Finally, They that are borne of God do not sin, nor can sin only; and do
nothing else but sin. For as they have a Principle of sin in them, viz. the
relics of the old man, whence they too often, Romans 7. 17. 20, 23, 24. So they
have a Principle of grace in them, the Law of their mind, the inner man;
whence they delight in the Law of God, and withstand sinning, Romans 7. 15, 20,
22. Whence the Apostle concludes of his own person, as every regenerate man
may of his; So then, with the mind I my self serve the Law of God: but with
the flesh, the Law of sin, Romans 7. 25.

But its far otherwise with the unregenerate. They only sin, and can do
nothing else but sin. This is evident; For,

1. The Scriptures plainly testify thus much, They that are in the flesh,
cannot please God, Rom 8. 8. Why, therefore they are without Faith, and without
faith it is impossible to please God, Heb. 11. 6. For whatsoever is not of faith
is sin, Romans 14. 23. All their works, words, and thoughts are sin, whether in
civil or Religious affairs. The plowing of the wicked is sin, Pro. 21. 4. Yea,
their whole course, The way of the wicked is abomination to the Lord, Pro. 15.
9. Yea, The Sacrifice of the wicked is abomination to the Lord, Pro. 15. 8. See
Isa. 1. 11, to 16. and 66. 3. Yea, the very thoughts of the wicked are an
abomination to the Lord, Pro. 15. 26. Yea, every imagination of the thoughts of
his heart are only evil continually, Genesis 6. 5. Singula habet emphasin and
auxesin; saepe im proba suut and scelerata hominum opera and tamencor non plane
malum, and mica bonae mentis super est: at hi^ etiam fontem operum cormalum,

Merceri Fraelection. in Genes. 6. 5.
How emphaticallyl (1.) not the thought, but thoughts: (2.) not only the
thoughts, but (if there be any thing before, or beyond the thoughts) the
imagination of the thoughts of his heart: (3.) not only some, or many, but
every imagination of the thoughts: (4.) is not evil in, the concrete, but
malice, or evilness it self in the abstract, as the Hebrew (...) may import:
5. Nor evilnesse in some respect, as if there were some mixture or relic of
goodness remaining; but only evil, mere malice: 6. Nor all this only for some
season, in fit of temptation, etc, but continually; all the day long, and every
day, so that carnal men so remaining can do nothing but sin, in all they act,
speak, or think.

2. Their persons and all their inward principles are merely carnal, corrupt,
and odious to God; not only sinners, but dead in trespasses and sins, Ephesians. 2.
1. Not only dark, but darkness it self, Ephesians. 5. 8. Not only carnal or
fleshly, but flesh it self, John 3. 6. And in the flesh dwells no good thing,
Romans 7. 18. Now such as are the persons of carnal men, such are all their
actions, merely carnal and sinful. So is this people, and so is every work of
their hands, and that which they offer there is unclean, Hagg. 2. 14. A corrupt
tree cannot bring forth good fruit. How can ye being evil speak good things? --
An evil man out of the evil treasure, brings forth evil things, Matthew. 12.
33, 34, 35. To them that are defiled, and unbelieving, is nothing pure: but
even their mind and conscience is defiled; -- being abominable, and
disobedient, and to every good work reprobate, Tit. 1. 15, 16.

Thus far of the difference betwixt the sinning of the regenerate, and
unregenerate, and how they that are borne of God sin not, nor can sin.
Whereof I have treated the more largely, that in this note which is of no small
consequence, the Conscience of the regenerate may be satisfied the more fully.
A Case of Conscience touching the Sin against the Holy Ghost, what it is, and
whether they that are born of God fall into it?



But before we pass from this Character of them that are borne of God, (viz.
That they do not commit sin, nor can sin;) to another: it may be very
useful to lend a little help to the weak, timorous, and trembling Christian,
against that perplexing temptation, that would persuade him, that he has
sinned against the Holy Ghost.

Alas! (says he) If they that are borne of God, commit not sin as the
unregenerate do, if this be a sign of Regeneration, what may I think of my
self? I am greatly afraid that I have sinned that very unpardonable Sin
against the Holy Ghost. For, (1.) I have sined against my light, and the checks
of my Conscience. (2.) I have sinned against the experimental tastes of
spiritual things. (3.) I have crucified Christ afresh. (4.) I have bad many
blasphemous thoughts in mine heart. (5.) I have fearfully fallen away from my
first love; and (which kills my soul.) (6.) under all this I find my heart as
hard and obdurate as an Adamant, without all Repentance or remorse for all
this. Have not I just cause to conclude that doubtless I am an unregenerate
Person?

Answ. Poor soul, forbear a little thy hard conceits of thy self, and suspend
thy censures. They that have worst thoughts of themselves are not always in the
worst condition toward God. Every one that fears he has sinned against the
H. Ghost, must not presently be concluded to have committed that horrid sin of
sins. All this may arise, (1.) partly from thy weakness, not knowing either
thy own spiritual estate, or the nature of this sin, truly and distinctly.
And (2.) partly from Satan's wickedness, abusing thy weakness, to make thee
believe this of thy self, that so (if it were possible) he might drive thee to
despair. But credit neither thine own weakness, nor Satan's wickedness, to
the ruin of thy precious soul.

For a more clear and satisfactory resolution in this case, consider these
particulars, 1. Who or what kind of persons are they that are in danger of
sinning this sin against the Holy Ghost. 2. What this sin against the Holy
Ghost is, and wherein it consists. 3. What a vast difference there is betwixt
the sins or falls of a regenerate person yea, though against knowledge, and
their sins, that sin against the H. Ghost. Take this in three several
Sections.

SECT. I.
I. Who, or what kind of persons they are that are in danger of sinning this
sin against the Holy Ghost.

Answ. This may be resolved, Negatively and Affirmatively.

Negatively, Who they are not; So we shall more distinctly see who they are.
Take this in these few Positions.

1. Doubtless those persons who are truly regenerate and borne of God, they
never any of them sin the sin against the Holy Ghost, nor can so sin. True, 1.
They may commit such sins against light of mind and checks of conscience
sometimes, Romans 7. 15, 19. They may possibly have such blasphemous and wicked
suggestions darted and injected into their thoughts, Matthew. 4. 3, 6, 9. They
may perhaps fall from their first love, Rev: 2. 4. Yea, fall so fearfully, as
David and Peter did. Yea, it may be they may perceive such hard-heartednesse
and impenitency upon their souls notwithstanding all this, for a season; that
from all these (Satan also subtly taking advantage thereby) they may have sad
apprehensions and fears that they have fallen into the very sin against the
Holy Ghost. 2. They also that are borne of God, as they have the root of all
actual sin still in them, viz. Original corruption dwelling in them, Psalm. 51.
5. Romans 7. 17, 18, 21, 23, 24 so they have the very root of this sin against
the H. Ghost in particular in them; original sin being the proper seed, spawne
and fountain of this sin as well as of any other whatsoever. How humbly,
vigilantly, and cautiously therefore should all Gods people walk before God,
seeing this dangerous principle of original corruption still sticks in their
hearts!

Yet notwithstanding, persons truly borne of God never actually fall into this
sin against the Holy Ghost, nor (all things well considered) can do. For,

1. The Holy Ghost himself in Scripture plainly testifies that the regenerate
sin not this great sin. -- There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he
shall pray for it. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto
death. We know that whosoever is borne of God sins not, [viz, as Tertullian
Scimus aute^ quod omnis qui exDeo natus sit non delinquit scilicet delictu^
quod ad mortem est. Tertul. lib de Pudicita, cap. 19.
notes, not this sin unto death,] but he that is begotten of God, keeps
himself, and that wicked one touches him not, 1 John. 5. 16, 17, 18. In these
and the two precedent verses the Apostle asserts more generally the privilege
of believers in the point of prayer, viz. confidence in Christ, that they shall
have whatsoever they ask according to Gods will, verse. 14, 15. This done, he
more particularly accmmodates this their privilege, declaring how prevalent
their prayer shall be in particular for a lapsed brother, to obtain life and
pardon for him, verse 16. This particular case of praying for a lapsed brother,
is further amplified three ways, viz. By a Distinction, a Caution, and a
Cnofirmation of it. By a Distinction betwixt sin and sin, that a believer may
know what sin he may pray for pardon of, according to Gods will, so as to
speed. Sin is here distinguished into sin unto dath, and sin not unto death,
verse 16. 17. Sin unto death (as Johannes docebit: Si quis scit fratrem suum.
delinquere delictum non ad mortem, postulabit and dabitur vita ei: quia non ad
mortem delinquit, hoc erit remissiblle: Est delictum ad mortem: non pro illo
dico ut quis postulet, hoc erit irremissibile. Ita ubi est postulationis, illic
etiam remissionis. Ubi nec postulationis, ibi aeque nec remissionis. Secundum
hanc differentiam delictorum, poenitentiae quoque conditio discriminatur. Alia
crit quae veniam consequi possit, in delicto scilicet remissibili: alia quae
consequi nullo modo possit, in delicto scilicet irremissibili. Tertull. lib. de
Pudicit. cap. 2. page 601, 602. Francker^, 1597.
Tertullian has observed) is irremissible, or unpardonable: Sin not unto
death, is remissible or pardonable; and for this sort of sin we are to pray.
Yet here the Apostles meaning is not to intimate that any sin is in its own
nature not mortal; (as Papists fondly distinguish of mortal and venial sin;)
for according to the merit, and proper nature of every sin, there can be no sin
so small, but in it self it is mortal, and deserves death, even death
eternal. Romans 6. 23. For every sin is a transgression of the Law, 1 John 3. 4.
and the least transgression of the Law, though but once admitted, in its own
nature exposes to the curse, Gal. 3. 10. But though all sins are mortal
meritoriously, yet some sins are not mortal eventually, viz. God is pleased
not to inflict the punishment of eternal death for every sin, that deserves it
(and this the Apostles sense here, as Peccata negat mortifera esse, quae etsi
morte digna sint, non tamen tam atrociter a Deo puniu^tur. Ideo peccata in se
non aestimat: sed judicium de illis ex paterna Dei indulge^tia facit, quae
reat^ condonet, ubi tamen culpaerati Den que morti non addicit quos Deus
erigendo restituit in vita^, quamvis per ^os non steterit quo minus a vita
alienati essent. Job. Calv. Comment in loc*
Calvin has judiciously observed) though there is one kind of sin, which is
mortal not only meritoriously in its own nature; but eventually, God always
so plaguing it. And what sin can this be but that sin against the Holy Ghost,
of which, Matthew. 12. 31, 32. Heb. 6. 4, to 7. and* ^0. ^6 to 31. seem plainly
to speaks. (2.) By a caution, not to pray for the pardon of that sin unto
death, verse. 10. For that were not to pray according to Gods Will, inasmuch as
God has declared that of all sin he will not pardon that sin, Matthew. 12. 31,
32. So that we ought not to pray for the pardon of the sin against the Holy
Ghost abstractly considered; not yet as considered concretely in this or that
person, whom we can clearly and infallibly discover to have fallen into it.
(3.) By confirmation, the Apostle gives a reason why we should pray for pardon
of the sin of a lapsed Brother, of any regenerate person; in that he that is
borne of God never commits this sin unto death, this impardonable sin. Why? He
that is begotten of God keeps himself, and that wicked one touches him not,
Verse. 18. It is not said, He tempts him not: but he touches him not. How
does not Satan that wicked one touch him? Non tangit tactu qualitativo, i. e.
Not with a qualitative touch, says Cajetan in loc. but Hinc autem infer
voluit, orandum pro omnibus Dei filiis esse: qui ad mortem non peccant. Additur
probatio. Quod quisquis ex Deo genitus est, ^ipsum fervat: hoc est, continet se
in Dei timore: nec se ita abripi pacitur, ut extincto pietatis sensu, Diabolo
and carni totum se permittat. Nam cum dicit non tangi eum a maligno, ad lethale
vulnus referendum est. Neque enim a Satanae vulneribus intacti manent filii
Dei, sed ita fidei clypeo propulsant ejus ictus, ut minime ad cor ipsum
penetrent. -- Servat se ipsum] Quod Dei proptium est, ad nos transfert. Nam u^
quisquis nostrum salutis suae sit custos, miserum erat praesidium. -- Servant
ergo se a peccato fideles, quatenus a Deo servantur. Calv. Comm. in 1 Joan. 5.
18. vide etiam Piscat. in loc.
Calvin much more judiciously, He touches him not lethally, mortally. The
regenerate is not quite exempted from Satan's wounding-touch, but by the shield
of faith he guards himself from the mortal killing touch, that he is not
stabbed to the heart. Whence is it that he is thus preserved? He keeps
himself, nay, God keeps him, as Christ prayed, John 17. 11. 1 Pet. 1. 5. Else
woe, woe to every Christian, were he is own keeper. He keeps himself from this
sin, whilst God keeps him; for he acts merely in Gods strength, and no
further. Thus the H. Ghost plainly testifies that they that are borne of God
sin not this sin to death. Make but sure to thy conscience that thou art borne
of God, and this may encourage thee against thy trembling apprehensions that
thou have sinned against the H. Ghost.

2. Should it come to pass that the regenerate might sin against the H. Ghost,
then they might totally and finally fall away from God: But that any regenerate
person should totally and finally fall away is as impossible; as that Gods
Covenant, promises, and faithfulness should fail; or that Gods Spirit, grace,
and power preserving them should be overcome, (as was before cleared) or that
Gods immutable decree for their salvation should be shaken or overthrown, 2 Timothy 2. 19. Romans 8. 29, 30.

3. They that are regenerate shall never come into condemnation. There is no
condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh,
but after the Spirit. For the Law of the Spirit of life has made them free
from the law of sin and death, Romans 8. 1, 2. Therefore they shall never fall
into the sin against the H. Ghost; for they that fall into that sin, cannot
possibly escape condemnation.

2. Questionless those persons have not sinned the sin against the H. Ghost,
who are perplexed, troubled, and afraid that they have fallen into it. That
very jealousy, fear, solicitousness, and trouble of conscience, lest thou
should have already so sinned, is an undoubted proof and evidence that thou
never did commit that sin in all thy life: for no person that indeed ever
sinned against the Holy Ghost, either was or could be afraid, perplexed or
troubled in spirit about it; such trouble being inconsistent with the nature of
that sin, which leaves no place for any religious fear, suspicion, jealousy
or trouble of heart about it. They that so sin, sinning wilfully, obstinately,
maliciously and blasphemously against the Spirit of grace, without all color,
shadow or possibility of remorse or repentance, Matthew. 12. 31, 32. Heb. 6. 4,
to 7. and 10. 26, to 31. These fears and tremblings of poor souls in this
case, are signs indeed that they are very weak, and Satan very busy with
them, abusing their weakness: but they are no signs of this sin committed by
them, but rather of the contrary.

3. Those persons that are without the visible Church, and without the
Gospel Ordinances, as We may conclude, that Turks and Infidels, that all
Atheists and Epicures they have not yet sinned against the H. Ghost, not
Phara^h a vessel of Gods wrath, not Sodom and Gomorrah with all their
filthiness, not Rabshakeh, or any such who would make themselves God, they
have not sinned against the Holy Ghost: They are accursed Creatures, and their
sins are abominable, they are bondslaves of Satan, and strangers from the God
of Is^ael, but yet we may say truly it shall be easier for those of Sodom, and
Gomorrah, for Tire and Sidon in the day of judgment, then for these wicked
blasphemers of the H. Spirit, which not only fulfilled the full measure of
these Pagans sin^, but have also contemned the graces which were given unto
them, and despised the Spirit, of which the Pagans were never made partakers.
Mr Deering in his readings upon the Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter 6. 3, 4 5 6.
Lect. 27.
Turks, Pagans, etc. (though some of the Ancients Sive ergo sit ille Paganus,
sive Judaeus, sive Christianus, sive ex Judaeis vel Christianis Haereticus,
sive quodlibet aliud habeat uomen erroris, non dictum est ille, aut ille: sed
qui dixerit verbum contra Spiritum Sanctum: id est, blasphemaverit Spiritum
Sanctum, non remittetur ei neque in hoc saeculo neque in fu^ure. D. August. de
verbis Domini. Sermon. 11. cap. 4.
think even such may sin against the H. Ghost) as also those persons within the
visible Church who have yet received little or no illumination by means of the
ordinances or spiritual taste and power of them; they are not for present in
immediate capacity of falling into this dreadful sin against the Holy Ghost
(though the root of it, being original coruption, be in them wholly
unmortified) for as much as it is not immediately* and actually incident but to
such as are within the Church, and those therein who wanting true grace, have
yet received some common grace of illumination, and taste of spiritual things,
Hebrews 6.

Affirmatively, false-hearted, hypocritical Professors of Christ and
Christianity, living in the bosom of the Church; who were never thoroughly
renewed, Col. 3. 10. Tit. 3. 5. not partakers of the true life of God, Ephesians. 4.
18. and power of godliness; but only attained the form of godliness, 2 Timothy
3. 5. a name that they live, Rev. 3. 1. and some formal accomplistments of
Hypocrites and temporary believers (who to humane apprehensions may go very
far) these are the persons who of all other in the world are most in danger
of falling into this unpardonable sin against the H. Ghost; for such the
Scripture describes them to be, who are particularly declared to be liable to
this sin. Compare well these Scriptures together, Matthew. 12. 24, 31, 32. Mark
3. 28, 29, 30. Heb. 6. 4, to 7. Heb. 10. 26, to 31. Luke 12. 10 In all which
places Hypocrites, especially the formal Hypocrites, (who usually go furthest
in their saintlike appearances) seem to be evidently characterized and
intended. For Christ speaks plainly of the Pharisees, which were in the Jewish
Church, but blasphemous Hypocrites: And the Apostle Paul speaks of temporary
professors, which were in the Christian Church, but Apostatical Hypocrites.

More particularly take the Holy Ghosts own Character of these persons, which
are in more near capacity and hazard of sinning this great sin against the Holy
Ghost, as they are laid down in these Scriptures, viz.

1. They are such as have attained to much knowledge of Christ, of the Truth,
and of the way of righteousness. These who were once enlightened, Heb. 6. 4.
i. e. enlightened with the knowledge of divine Truths and fundamental
principles of Christian Religion, immediately fore-recited, Ver. 1, 2. If we
sin wilfully after we have received the Quo primum docet Peccatum in Spiritum
san ct^m non admittinisi post veritatcm Evangel^ agnitam and approbata^ in
Conscientia. Non igicur admittunt il lud, qui ex ignorantia peccant vel
^eficiunt. Deinde docet collatio, magnificis illis donis nihil nisi (...),

sufficit: Nam etiam canibus and porcis ad vomi^um ac volutabrum redeuntibus, h.
e. Hypocritis and Apostatis continge^e potest. D. Pareus in loc.
knowledge of the Truth, Heb. 10 26.

Which passages presuppose them that fall into this sin of sins to be knowing
men in mysteries of Christianity, and notably illuminated; for this sin, is a
sin against light, great light. There Is a threefold light or illumination of
men. 1. General and natural, viz. the light of reason; Thus the eternal Word,
the Son of God is the true light, which enlighteneth every man that comes
into the world. Joh. 1. 9. 2. Special and supernatural, viz. That light of the
Faith and Grace from the sanctifying Spirit, which is part of the image of God
in the regenerate. Of which see, Ioh. 17. 3. 1 Ioh. 2. 27. Col. 3. 10. 3.
There Is a kind of middle illumination betwixt these; more then mere natural,
but less then true supernatural illumination; a common gift of the Spirit even
to Hypocrites and temporary believers which have no true grace, whereby men may
be able even to Prophesy, etc. of this the Apostle speaks; Though I have the
gift of Prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge, -- and have
not charity, I am nothing, 1 Cor. 13. 2. Judas was thus enlightened, and those
Hypocrites, Mat. 7. 22, 23. Here we are to understand not the two first, but
this last illumination.

2. They are such as by means of this knowledge have attained to much
reformation in their lives and ways. They have escaped the pollution of the
world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, 2 Pet. 2. 20.
Here they were outwardly deformed in the sight of men, not inwardly renewed in
the sight of God: sin was chained up, and restrained; not cast out, and
mortified, as in Judas, who walked so unblameably, as none of the Apostles
could suspect him more then themselves to be the betrayer of Christ. This
seems to be that which our Savior calls, the unclean spirits going out of a
man. Matthew. 12 43. h. e. Seemingly, though not really and in truth, or in some
degree, but not thoroughly. An allusion to the ejection of the Devil out of the
Demoniack, about which the Pharisees so blasphemed the Holy Ghost.

3. They are such as have tasted of the heavenly gift, Heb. 6. 4. By heavenly
gift, b Ambr. understands the remission of sins Et g^stastis donum coeleste;
hoc est, remissionem peccatorum accepistis. D. Ambr. Com me^t. in Heb. 6.
Oecumenius, the remission of sins, which is in Baptism, for this (says he)
is an heavenly gift. (...). Oecumen. Comment. in Heb. 6^. 356. B. Lute^t.
Pa^is. 1631.
Pareus, Faith; which is a gift bestowed from heaven upon them that are
illuminated. Donum coelcite] quod est fides, quae coelitus datur illuminatis*

Calvin, understands the things of Christ, * Gustum doni coelestis] Quo
significat supra naturam and mundum esse quae nobis in Ch^isto conferuntur: and
tamen fide gustari. Calv. Comment in. He^. 6.
which are above nature and above the world. And of all other, Christ by way of
peculiar emphasis is called the gift of God, Joh. 4. 10. And may here
principally be intended by the heavenly gift, for he came down from heaven for
us, Ioh. 6. 38, 50. Under which also Faith and remission of sins, may be
employed and included; Remission of sins and such like benefits, being tasted in
Christ; and Faith being the Organ whereby we taste them. And note, it is not
said, have eaten, or drunk, but only tasted, i. e. have had some kind of
relish or small sense by a temporary faith of the excellency of Christ and the
things of Christ.

4. They are such as were made partakers of the Holy Ghost. Heb. 6. 4. By [Holy
Ghost] here Interpreters Spiritus sancti] in distributionem donorum Dei quae in
Epistola ad Corinthios beatus Paulus enumerat, 1 Cor. 12. D. Ambros. Com. in
Heb. 6. id est, (...). Oecumen. Comment. in Heb. 6. Id est. Fidei temporariae.

unanimously understand, nor the special sanctifying graces of the Spirit: But
the common gifts of the Holy Ghost, as comman illumination, tongues, temporary
faith, Faith of miracles, etc. Of which gifts the Apostle makes an enumeration,
1 Cor. 12. 3, to 12. Judas, Simon Magu^, many hypocrites had such gifts in the
Primitive times, Matthew. 7. 22, 23. Act. 8. 13. In aftertimes, and even in our
days, public Church Officers (though hypocrites) may have the gift of formal
preaching, expounding Scriptures, and praying in public: Yea, private
professors may share in such gifts as to be able formally to pray, to resolve
doubts, to comfort the feeble-mimded, to strengthen and encourage the timorous,
to instruct the ignorant, and by profitable discourse to edify many, and all
these by the common assistance of the Holy Ghost. Otherwise how should the
Apostates here described, sin against the Holy Ghost; had they not in
themselves some gifts and endowments of the Holy Ghost? See Ambrose,
Occumonius, Piscator, Calvin, Pareus, thus interpreting.

5. They are such as have tasted the good word of God, Heb. 6. 5. i. e. The
doctrine of the Gospel, says Bon^ verbum Dei,] hic doctrinam dicit Evagelicam.
Ambros. Comment. in Heb. 6.
Ambros. the Doctrine of Christ, says (...) Occumen. com. in Heb. 6
Occumenius: the Word of the Gospel styled good, i. e. pleasant, says Piscat.
S^bol. in Heb.
Piscator: the holy Scriptures, says Par. Comment. in Heb. 6.
Parcus: (all come much to one) and Vocat gustum boni Dei vevbi] quo significat
non quovis modo illic manifestari Dei voluntatem: sed quae suaviter nos
delectat. Denique hoc epitheto notatur discrimen legis and evangelij; qucniam
illa nihil praeter severitatem and judicium continet: hoc autem suave est
divini erga nos amo^ is and paternae indulgentiae testimonium. Calv. in loc.
Calvin thinks that the Gospel is here peculiarly intended: that being the
good, the sweet Word, testifying the sweetness of Gods love to poor sins;
when the Law biterly thunders out nothing but death and curses. Now even
hypocrites and cast awayes, hearing the Gospel powerfully and sweetly preached;
the matchless love of God in Christ to sinners displayed; the worth and
excellency of Jesus Christ and his benefits unfolded; oh how are they sometimes
moved, pleased, and for present affected with some pangs and moods of joy!
Herod ^rd John Baptist gladly, Mar 6. 20. The hearers resembled to the stony
ground, ^ard the word, and anon with joy received it. Mat. 13. 20. Ezekiel. 33.
31, 32, But all this is but an imperfect Taste.

6. Finally, they are such as have tasted also the powers of the world to come,
Heb. 6. 5. As Ambros. and Oecumen. in Heb. 6. and Calv-Com. in Heb. 6.
Most by [world to come] here understand the life to come in heaven; and by
[the powers of the world to come,] the Resurrection of the Saints bodies, their
blessed separation from the Goats, and sentence of Salvation from Jesus
Christ, together with all that bliss, joy, glory, vision of God, and benefits
of eternal life which they shall possess in heaven: All which may be well
called [powers of the world to come,] partly (1.) because then they shall
appear to be glorious effects of Gods power; partly (2.) because Christ the
mighty God, Isa. 9. 6. has made it a powerful Kingdom, which cannot be shaken;
partly (3.) because now the very apprehensions and hopes of them work
powerfully effects of comfort, joy, delight etc. in the hearts of them that
expect them, Romans 5. 1, 2. These [powers of the world to come] formal
professors may Gustaverint, (...). Vid. 1 Timothy 4. 1 Est autem imprimis notanda
emphasis hujus verbi. Nam aliud est vere credere, uti Lydia illa cujus cor
aperuit Dominus, Acts 16. 14. Aliud vero gustum aliquem habere, quamvis ne hoc
quidem nisi ex Spititus sanctigratia fieri possit) verumquae fructum non ferat,
quod eamre probi statim evomant. Beza Annot. iu Heb. 6. 5.
taste, By Contemplation of them with some delight, and by Application to
themselves (though falsely,) by a temporrary Faith, Luke 8. 13. which for
present may leave some tincture and relish of sweetness upon their spirits.
Hence Balaam wished, Let me dye the death of the righteous, and my last end be
like his, Numb. 23. 10. But D. Pareus in Comment. in Heb. 6. 5. Sic D.
Chrisostomus in (...).
some by [world to come] understand these last times of the New Testament, in
opposition to the world past under the Old Testam and in that sense in this
very Epist. speaking of the times of the Gospel, he phraseth it (...), i. e.
the world come; For unto Angels has he not subjected the world to come, of
which we speak, Heb. 2. 5. By [powers of the world to come] in this sense they
understand the Signs, wonders and miracles with which God did powerfully bear
witness to the Apostles and their Doctrine, Heb. 2. 4. Mat. 16. 26. as Christ
promised, Mar. 16. 17, 18. And those that had the gifts of working miracles in
the primitive Church, are called, (...), i. e. powers, 1 Con. 12. 28, 29. Which
is the selfsame word here used in Heb. 6. 5. Now its evident that even
hypocrites had a test of such powers of miracles, etc. Matthew. 7. 22, 23. And
doubtless Judas wanted not this gift, else the rest of the Apostles might have
suspected him rather then themselves to betray Christ, which they did not. Now
though this latter interpretation be plausible, and the expressions here used
may well bear this sense, being elsewhere used to like purpose: yet the former
exposition seems rather to be preferred, (1.) partly, pecause so the sense will
rise in this particular of tasting the powers of the world to come, above all
the other forementioned, which according to the latter exposition, rather falls;
(2.) partly, because so a ^tology will be prevented in these particular
qualifications enumerated, which according to this latter interpretation cannot
be avoided, understanding powers of miracles, which evidently come under the
former particular of partakers of the Holy Ghost.

Thus much for the first thing to be opened, viz. Who they are that have a more
immediate habitude to, and are more nearly in danger of the sin against the
Holy Ghost.

SECT. II
Next consider we,

What the sin against the Holy Ghost is, and wherein it consists? And here I
may ingenuously confess with Forte in omnibus
Augustine writing upon the blasphemy of the Holy Ghost, what it should be,
that happily in the whole sacred Serip^ the is scarce found a greater and
Sanctis Scripturis nulla major quaestio, nulla difficilior invenitur; unde ut
vobis aliquid de me ipsofatear, semper in sermoni bus quos ad populumhabui,
hujus questionis difficultatem molestiamque vitavi: non quia nihil haberem quod
inde utcunque cogitarem; neque enim in re tanta petere, quarere, pulsare
negli^em: sed quia ipsi intelligentiae, quae mihi aliquautum ape^iebatur,
verbis ad horam occurrentibus me posse sufficere nor putarem. Agustin. de
verbis Domin^, Sermon. 11. cap. 5.
an harder question then this is. And were it not, (...). That Scripture has
revealed something concerning it: And, 2. That it is necessary to endeavor the
satisfaction of the weak scrupling Consoiences of some trembling Christians
about it; that they have not fallen into it, and by the Grace of God ^ever
shall 3. As also that it is a thing desirable, that all truly Regenerate
persons may more clearly see the riches of Gods grace, in his undoubted
preserving all and every one of them for ever from comitting it, that so they
may walk the more thankfully, humbly and watchfully before the Lord: I say
were it not for these considerations, I should most willingly have bin silent
herein. But these efford both warrant and encouragement to speak, so it be
soberly, and according to Scripture.

For more clearness herein, consider. (1.) The Name. (2.) The Nature. And (3.)
the Grievousnesse of this sin against the Holy Ghost

I.
The Name or Names given to this sin in holy Scripture. Nomina sunt quasi rerum
notamina.
Names, properly given do much notify or make known the things intended by
them. The more remarkable ^mes given to it are these, viz.

1. Blasphemy against the holy Ghost, or blasphemy against the Spirit; But the
blasphe^ against the H. Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men: which is after
expounded, by speaking against the Holy Ghost, Mtth. 12. 31, 32. See also Mark
3. 30, 31, 32. and Luke 12. 10. [Blasphemy] is originally a Greek word,
Blasphemia] est convitium in Deum, a (...) futilis, and (...) fama; vel ut alii
volunt a (...), quasilaesio fa^ae. D. Pare. Com. in Apocal. 13. 1. --
Blasphemia est convi^ium vel maledictu^ gravius, verbis contumeliosis in Deum
vel proximu^ a (...), lederefama^, vel nomen Dei aut proximi. D. Pare. Comment.
in Matthew. 12. 31.
derived as some think from (...) and (...). i. e. a bad fame, an useless
fame, etc. or as others, a (...), i. e. from ^rting the fame, good name or
reputation of any, God or man. Thus it signifies in the general notation of
the word; but used more strictly (as here) it denotes a more grievous and
heinous reproaching, slandering or reviling of the Holy Spirit. and this
purposely and maliciously against knowledge. This the Apostle elsewhere calls,
despiting the Spirit of grace, Heb. 10. 29. (...)] which properly notes a
petulancy and frowardness of reproaching. See H. Steph. Th^sur. G. Ling. Now
this sin is peculiarly called Blasphemy of the Spirit, or against the Holy
Ghost: rather then blasphemy against the Father or the Son;

Not in respect of the divine essence, or personal subsistence of the Holy
Ghost. For he that sins against any one person of the blessed Tri^ty, sins
against every person for they are all one in unity of essence. 1. John. 5. 7.
He that blasphemes the H. Ghost, blasphemes also both the Father and Son,
inasmuch as all three are co-essentiall, and therefore co-equall and
co-eternall in majesty, glory and all divine perfections, as Nunquid alia est
offensa filii, alia Spiritus Sancti? sicut enim una Divinitas, sic una injuria.
Ambros. De Spiritu Sancto, lib. 1. cap. 3.
Ambrose has well noted.

But in respect of the Ministry and office of the Holy Ghost. (1.) The
Ministry of the Spirit is the Gospel, and the glorious truth therein
contained. See 2 Cor. 3. 8. From which truth hypocrites fall away; and against
which truth they maliciously and blasphemously oppose and set themselves who
sin against the Holy Ghost, as after will appear. 2. The Office of the
Spirit, is to convince, Joh. 16, 9. To illuminate and furnish with variety of
gifts and spiritual endowments, Act. 8. 13. Luk 8. 13. 1. Cor. 12. And to
suggest many good motions and inclinations into men's hearts, in use of
Ordinances, and otherwise, as, Math. 13. 20. Mark. 6. 20. they had some motions
of joy. Act. 26. 28. Agrippa almost persuaded to be a Christian. Against which
light, gifts and motions of the Spirit they directly and wilfully sin, that
sin against the Holy Ghost.

2. An Apostasy or falling away: If they shall fall away, Heb. 6. 6. It is the
highest and worst Apostasy of all other. As after we shall further see. This
presapposes some entertainment of Christian Religion whence they make
defection, viz. in the form, and profession of it. As for them that have
embraced it in truth and power, they shall never fall, John 10. 28.

3. The sin unto der^h; There Is a sin unto death, and there is a sin not unto
death, 1 Ioh. 5. 16, 17. Why thus called, was formerly explained, p. 63, 64,
65. Thus of some of the principal names.

II.
The Nature of this sin, and wherein it properly and especially consists; comes
next to consideration. Here lies the Cardo controver^sie, the very knot and
stresse of the Case. Both Ancient and Modern Writers; he^e in manifest much
discrepancy land disagreement with one another; and among diverse of them is ^o
be found small satisfaction in this point. August. De verbis Domini, Sermon. 11.
videatur ^it.
Augustine, much hesicates about it, but at last conceives it to be a Final
impenitency. Ambros. De Spiritu Sancto. l. 1. c. 3.
Ambrose sometimes intimates it to be, a blasphemous denial of the H. Ghost.
Sometimes interprets it to be Ambr. De Poenitent. l. 2. c. 4.
an a^pions, Heretical and Schism^cal separe^ from the Church of Christ.

Gregory thinks it is, the not believing remission of sins. Thoms Aquin.
secunda secundae quaest. 14. artic. 1. etc
Th^s thinks, He sins against the H. Ghost, the not only speaks against the
Majesty of God. and the person of the Holy Ghost: But also that obstinately and
maliciously persist: in his sins impenitent to the point of death, rejecting
all the Holy Ghosts provisions for suppression of his sins. And he with other
of the Estius in lib. 2. Sent. Distinct. 43. sect. 2.
Schoolmen usually reckons up six sorts or kinds of this sin against the Holy
Ghost, viz. (1.) Despair; (2.) Presumption; (3.) An obstinate Purpose of
continuing in sin; (4.) A firm and fixed Will never to repent; (5.) An
impugning or opposing of the known truth; and (6.) An envying of our Brothers
Graces. All which (they say) may be forgiven, but that final obstinacy in
sinning. Estius Estius, quosupra.
is of opinion, That the sin against the Holy Ghost generally taken, is
whatsoever is purposely, maliciously and blasphemously committed against God in
thought, word or deed.

In midst of all this variety of opinions, especially in so difficult a subject
as this, where shall we pitch? I like Lumen ergo expositionis a Domino
requiramus. Aug. de verbis Domini. Sermon. 11. cap. 4.
Agustines item well in this very case, Let us beg light for exposition of
this matter from the Lord. For more distinct Resolution, Consider (1.) By way
of Remotion, or Negation of what it is no (2.) By way of position, or
Affirmation of what it is, and both very briefly.

I. By way of remotion, or negation of what it is not. The sin against the Holy
Ghost, strictly and properly taken, seems not to be any of these particular
sins following, viz.

1. It is not every blasphemous temptation injected and darted by Satan into
the thoughts, against God Father, Son or H. Ghost. For (1.) The dearest Saints
and servants of God may be buffetted and sifted with such sad temptations and
horrid injections of the Devil; frequent experience tells us thus much. How
many gracious souls come to Ministers, lamenting the many horrid suggestions
of blasphemy cast into their imaginations! Mr Bolton in his Instructions for a
right comforting of Afflicted conscinces page 550. London, 1631.
One of singular experience in soule-distresses, says; I have known him, who
did bite in and keep close in his bosom, this temptation of blasphemy, the
space of about 20. years, All which while the Devil did tyrannize extremely,
and keep him almost in continual terror. He thought there was never man had
such vile and prodigious thoughts as he, etc. 2. Blasphemous suggestions were
injected into the imagination of Jesus Christ himself (who was so far from
sinning against the Holy Ghost; that he never sinned at all, nor could sin,
Isai. 53. 9. Heb. 7. 25, 26. 2 Cor. 5. 21.) viz That he who was the spotless
Son of God, in whom the fullness of the Godhead dwelt bodily; i. e. personally.
Col. 2. 9. Who was the Brightness of the Fathers glory, and the express
Character of his person, Heb. 1. 3. Who being in the form of God thought it
not robbery to be equal with God. Phil. 2. 6. that he should fall down and
worship the Devil in person, Matthew. 4. 9. Never Christian had, nor could have
more black and hideous blasphemy cast into his thoughts. Yet Christ in the
least degree yielded not to this blasphemous suggestion; but conquered it; that
his Members hereby might be more then Conquerours, even Triumphers, over like
temptations, through Christ that loves them. 3. Blasphemous suggestions
injected into our hearts, yet not consented to by us, but rather trembled at,
execrated and abhorred, are the Devils sins, not ours; they are our sorrows,
our afflictions and miseries; but not our sins. A pious soul is no more guilty
of them (says Dr. Sibs Pruised Reed, page 125.
one) then Benjamin of Joseph's cup, put into his saok. Blasphemous thoughts
(says Mr. Mr. Perkins cases of conscience Book 1. chap. 10. sect. 2.
Perkins.) not consented to by us, are not our sins, but the Devils. Men must
not fear those kind of thoughts overmuch; -- because though indeed they be
their crosses, yet are they not their personal sins, for which they shall
incur the wrath and displeasure of God. And says Mr. Dyke, Dan. Dyke in his
Michael and Dragon.
Satan must answer for this himself. Hereto subscribe both Ancient and Modern
Writers. In illis cogitationibus, quae repugnanti and invito animo fuggeruntur,
quibus men's cun^ ho^rore quodam renititur ac iesis^t, non est peccatum fine

2. It is not every sinning against the Deity or Personality of the Holy Ghost;
As Aug. de verbis Domini, Sermon. 11. c. 3.
Augustine observes, That the Sadduces denied the Holy Ghost; That the Arrians,
Eunomians and Macedonians contended, that the Holy Ghost was a creature, not a
Creator: That the Sabellians (called also Patripassians, because they held that
the Father suffered) deny the Trinity, assert only the Father, that he is
sometimes called the Son, sometimes the Holy Ghost: That the Photinians,
denying the Trinity, say the Father only is God, the Son only man, but deny
the Holy Ghost altogether. These are hideous blasphemous and damnable heresies,
but it would be somewhat hard to prove that these are the sin against the Holy
Ghost, because this sin properly is not so much against the ^ssence or
subsistence of the H. Ghost, as against the Ministry and Office of the H.
Ghost.

3. Not every sin against knowledge is that sin against the Holy Ghost. For
though knowledge add an aggravating circumstance to sin, John 9. 41. Luke 12.
47. Yet 1. The best of Gods people in a gust of temptation without; and
violence of corrution within, may sometimes so far be borne down as to do
those things which they know they should not do, as in Paul, Romans 7. 15, 19.
20, 23. In Peter, he knew he ought not to deny his Lord and Master Jesus
Christ, and resolved peremptorily the contrary, but sudden fear prevailed over
him, Matthew. 26. 69, to the end. In David, he knew he should not commit
adultery, nor kill; yet strength of corruption and temptation pushed him upon
both; yet none of these sinned the sin against the Holy Ghost. 2. Sins against
knowledge admit both of repentance and pardon, as in all these three cases
mentioned; David pardoned, 2 Samuel 12. 13. Peter restored after his bitter
tears; by a threefold fear he denied Christ, by a threefold love he confessed
Christ, Matthew. 26. last. John. 21. 15, etc. Paul delivered from his body of
death by Jesus Christ his Lord, Romans 7. 24, 25. 3. Besides, sinning against
knowledge and illumination, diverse other sinful poisons are complicated and
contained in the sin against the H. Ghost, Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. 10. 26, 29. Matthew.
12. 31.

4. Not every sinning against the Truth of Christ and the Gospel, is the sin
against the Holy Ghost. For, 1 Those that know most of the truth of Christ in
this world, know but in part. -- See but as through a glass darkly, 1 Cor. 13.
9, 12. and therefore they may possibly err from the truth, in some things. 2.
Diverse have sinned against the truth, yea, sometimes against fundamentals, and
yet are not challenged to have sinned against the Holy Ghost, but were
accounted as of the visible Church; as those in the Church of Corinth, that
denied the resurrection, 1 Cor. 15. 12. And those in the Church of Porgamus,
that held the Doctrine of Balaam, and the Doctrine of the Nicolaitanes: Yet are
not counted hopeless, but invited to repent of these damnable opinions, Rev.
2. 14, 15, 16. The Churches of Galatia were fearfully tainted with that
dangerous error of the necessity of the works of the Law to Justification, as
well as of Faith; which gave occasion to Paul of writing that excellent Epistle
to the Galatians. See Gal. 1. 6, etc. 2. 16. etc. 3. 1, etc. Yea, the very
Apostles themselves had an erroneous opinion about Christ's temporal Kingdom,
and that till after his resurrection, Act. 1. 6. 3. Erroneous persons, are
called to repentance, Rev. 2. 16. and Ministers are directed to instruct with
meekness those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them
repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, 2 Timothy 2. 24, 25, 26.

5. Not every sinning against the gracious motions, strivings and operations of
the Holy Ghost, is this peculiar sin against the Holy Ghost here spoken of;
For, (1.) It Is possible that men may thus sin, and sometimes with an high hand,
and yet not be charged by the Scripture, with sinning against the Holy Ghost.
The Proto-martyr St^phen thus challenges his hearers, Ye stiff-necked and
uncircumeised in heart a^e ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your
fathers did, so do ye. Which of the Prophets have not your fathers persecuted,
etc. Acts 7. 51, 52. They are charged with always resisting the Holy Ghost; an
heavy charge, an heinous sin doubtless. But yet are not charged with that sin
against the Holy Ghost. 2. All carnal men in the visible Church, whilst
carn^l, still resist the Holy Ghost in his Gospel. Ministry, often quenching
his Conv^ctions, Motions and Holy Suggestions to their souls: yet it would be
an hard and false sentence, to say all such sin the sin against the Holy Ghost
here intended. Possibly they may do it in ignorance, and afterward come to
repentance. Saul whilst a carnal Pharisee, was a blasphemer, 1 Timothy 1. 13. and
compelled the Saints to blaspheme, and being exceedingly mad agaiast them,
persecuted them to strange Cities, Acts 26. 10, 11. He so far withstood the
Spirits Ministry and Tenders of grace, that he persecuted it to the death; yet
all this he did ignorantly, repented of it, and obtained mercy, 1 Timothy 1. 13,
16. Which could not have been, if in this height of his wickedness he had
sinned this grand sin against ^he Holy Ghost. 3. Who knows not, but even the
dear children of God, are in danger in some measure of sinning against the
Spirit of God, by grieving him, and quenching him; hence the Apostle so
cautions them, Quench not the Spirit, 1 These. 5. 19. And, Grieve not the holy
Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption, Ephesians. 4. 30.
Yea, actually some have quenched the Spirit in some measure; As the Angel of
Ephesus had left his first love, etc. Rev. 2. 4, 5. As David, who therefore
prays, Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and stablish me with thy free
Spirit, Psalm. 51. 12.

6. Not every sinning against Grace received, is presently the sin against
the Holy Ghost; For 1. The most heavenly and gracious souls are daily
perplexed with inseparable and invincible infirmities; as doubts, fears,
distracting thoughts, distempered passions, etc. 2. They may too often quench
the Spirit, 1 These. 5. 19. and grieve him, Ephesians. 4. 29, 30. by suppressing his
good motions, sacred stirrings and strivings in their hearts. 3. They may
gradually decay and decline in their graces and gracious affections to God and
Jesus Christ, (though this be very sad and dangerous) Rev. 2. 5. and yet not be
utterly cast out of Christ's affection. The Angel of Ephesus had left his first
love, and first works; though otherwise much commended and approved by Christ,
Rev. 2. 1, to 8. 4. They may grossly fall, and even break their bones by
falling (which is much to be lamented) yet not quite fall away. As Noah to
drunkenness, Genesis 9. 21. Lot to incest, Genesis 19. 33, etc. David to murder and
uncleanness, 2 Samuel, 11. with Psalm. 51. Noanullis videtur eos tantummodo
peccare in Spiritum Sanctum, qui lavacro regenerationis abluti in Ecclesia, and
accepto Spiritu Sancto, velut tanto postea dono Salvatoris ingrati, mortifero
aliquo peccato se immerserint; qualia sunt adulteria, vel homicidia, vel ipsa
discessio, sive emni modo a nomine Christiano, sive a Catholica Ecclesia. Sed
iste sensus unde probari possit ignoro: cum and poenitentiae quorumque criminum
locus in Ecclesia non negetur, and ipsos haereticos ad hoc utique corripiendos
dicat Apostolus, 2 Timothy 2. 25, 26. Quis enim est fructus correctionis sine ulla
spe remissionis? Augustine. de verb. Dom. Sermon. 11. cap. 4.
Augustine intimates some were of opinion that such falls were the sin against
the Holy Ghost; which opinion he justly rejects, because in such cases the door
of repentance is not quite shut. 5. Yea, it is possible that those who are borne
of God, and are kept from sinning this sin unto death, may yet relapse again
and again. Lapses are dangerous, Relapses double dangerous. To break a bone is
hazzardous, but to break it again in the same place is extremely perilous. yet
even repeated and reiterated sins may find pardon upon repentance. Jacob twice
told a lie for compassing of the blessing, Genesis 27. 19, 21. Lot twice made
drunken committed incest with both his Daughters, Genesis 19. Peter thrice denied
his Master, and every time worse then other, Matthew. 26. These are recorded to
caution them that stand, that they fall not; and to comfort them that have
relapsed, that they despair not.

7. Not every malicious opposing and persecuting of the Church and ways of
Christ (though this be an high pitch of Wickedness) is the sin against the
Holy Ghost. For, 1. We have two eminent instances in the New Testament to the
contrary. Saul consented to Stephens death, Act. 8. 1. Breathed ^ut threatenings
and slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord, Act. 9. 1, etc. When they were
put to death, he gave his voice against them, and punished them often in every
Synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme, and being exceedingly mad against
them, persecuted them even unto strange Cities, Act. 26. 10, 11. and yet the
Lord had mercy on him, 1 Timothy 1. 13, 16. Yea, he had such mercy on him, as to
convert and save him, when he was in his course of subverting and destroying
his Church, Act. 9. 1, 2, 3, etc. and 26. 12, 13. Behold, here a wonder of
mercy. And yet here is a greater wonder, the persecutors and murderers of Jesus
Christ himself find mercy, and are converted, Act. 2. 36, etc. Let Heaven and
Earth, Men and Angels adore this mercy. He pitied him that was cruel to his
Saints: yea, he pardoned them that crucified himself; who would despair, when
Christ opens to such a door of hope? who would presume to sin and spurn
against such bowels of commiserations? 2. Such sins may be committed by them
that have not been Evangelically illuminated. Paul obtained mercy, because he
did it ignorantly, 1 Timothy 1. 13. and, had they known, they would not have
crucified the Lord of Glory, 1 Cor. 2. 7, 8, 9. And properly the sin against
the Holy Ghost is not committed till after the Gospel. illumination, Heb. 6. 3.
Such Delinquents sometimes find mercy, that Christ may make them Presidents
for mercy to all that after shall believe, 1 Timothy 1. 16.

None of all these are this sin against the Holy Ghost; which we seek after,
yet are we not therefore to embolden our selves in them. Though Treason bring
the most shameful and cruel death, yet felony is Capital: and the easiest
death, is an heavy punishment; and though none of these sins be that sin of
sins, which excludes all hope of salvation: yet every one, even the least of
them, are such sins as in their own nature deserve damnation, Romans 6. 23.
Consider this, thou trembling Christian, thou think thou have sinned against
the Holy Ghost; nay stay, the Lord has thus far kept thee from many of these
recited evils; and Questionless the sin against the Holy Ghost is far beyond
them all. But what is it? seeing thus far we see what it is not.

II. By way of Position or Affirmation. Consider now what it is. The sin
against the Holy Ghost is not a single, but a compounded wickedness; tempered
and made up of many deadly poisons, whereby it becomes extremely damnable.
There Is a Concurrence and Complication of many pernicious diseases in it, which
make it out of measure deadly.

There are some special Scriptures that peculiarly delineate the nature of this
horrid sin unto us, viz. These that follow, For it is impossible for those
which were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were
made Partakers of the Holy Ghost, ^d have tasted the good Word of God, and tho
powers of the world to come: If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto
repentance: Seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put
him to an open shame, Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. And afterward in the same Epistle it is
said: Not forsaking the assembling of our selves together, as the manner of
some is. For if we sin wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of
the Truth, there remain^th no more sacrifice for sins: but a certain fearful
looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation which shall devour the
adversaries. He that despised Moses Law, died without mercy under two or three
witnesses. Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought
worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God; and has counted the blood
of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing; and has done
despite unto the Spirit of Grace? Heb. 10. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. The Apostle John
also says, If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he
shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death.
There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it. All
unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not unto death. We know that
whosoever is borne of God, sins not: but he that is begotten of God, keeps
himself, and that wicked one touches him not, 1 John 5. 16, 17, 18. Our
blessed Savior having healed one possessed of a devil, blind and dumb; The
Pharisees maliciously reviled him, and said, This fellow does not cast out
Devils, but by Beelzebub the Prince of the Devils. And Jesus knew their
thoughts, and said unto them, Every Kingdom divided against it self is brought
to desolation. -- Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy
shall be forgiven unto men, but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not
be forgiven unto men: And whosoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it
shall be fergiven him: but whosoever speaks against the Holy Ghost, it shall
not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come,
Matthew. 12. 22, 24, 25, 31, 32. Compare herewith Mark. 3. 22, 28, 29. who adds
this as an express Reason, Because they said, He has an unclean spirit, ver.
30. And Luke 12. 10. The sin against which our Savior thus severely speaks in
these three Evangelists is without doubt that notorious sin against the Holy
Ghost, (...), most strictly and properly so called. For (1.) It is denominated
blasphemy against the Holy Ghost. And (2.) Is by Christ declared to be that one
only unpardonable sin. That sin also against which the Author of the Epistle to
the Hebrews, and John in the three forecited texts speak, must needs be
granted to be the same sin against the Holy Ghost, in as much as it is in all
the three places, laid down as a dreadful and unpardonable sin, of which it is
impossible to repent, Heb. 6. 4. 5. 6. for which there remains no more
sacrifice, Heb. 10. 25. 26. And for pardon whereof we must not pray, 1 John 5.
16. So that all these texts speaking so fully and evidently of the sin against
the Holy Ghost, we may from them all, considered together, draw this
Description of that horrid Sin against the Holy Ghost, most properly and
strictly so called; viz.

The sin against the Holy Ghost is an universal, final and wilful falling
away of Hypocritical Professors; From the Truth and common graces of the Holy
Ghost once Received and Professed; To the blasphemous despiting of the Spirit
of Grace, horrid contempt and malice against the Son of God, and violent
persecution of the way of Christianity.

This description of the sin against the Holy Ghost, is so clearly grounded
upon the former Scriptures, that much need not be said for evincing thereof.
'Only for unfolding the nature of this sin, Consider in this description these
ensuing particulars, viz.

1. The general Nature of it, A falling away. 2. The more special Nature of it,
whereby it is differenced or distinguished from other sins, viz. By 1. The
peculiar Subject of it: Hypocritical Professors. 2. The properties of this
falling away, which are three. It is 1. Universal. 2. ^ll. 3. Wilful.
5. The Termini of Terms of this Apostasy or falling away, which are 2. viz. 1.
Terminus a Quo. The term from w^; or the Good from which he falls, viz. 1.
Truth. 2. Common Graces of the Holy Ghost.
Once received and professed. 2. Terminus ad Qu^. The term to which: or the
evil to which he backslides, which is 3 fold, viz. to 1. Blasphemous despiting
of the Spirit of Grace. 2. Horr^ contempt and malice against the Son of God. 3.
Violent persecution of the way of Christianity.



These are the particulars in this Description, let us briefly consider how
clearly they are grounded on Scripture; and then we shall see that in Scripture
sense, this is the true nature of the sin against the Holy Ghost.

I. The general nature of this sin against the Holy Ghost, viz. A falling
away, or an Apostasy. There Is a manifold falling away, as, 1. From truth to
error and heresy, Gal. 1. 6, 7. and 3. 1. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 10, 11. 1 Timothy 1. 19,
20. 2. From purity of worship, to superstition and idolatry, as Israel often
fell, in the days of Aaron, Exodus 32. of the Judges, of the, Kings, etc. See
Acts 7. 39, to 44. 3. From some holy degrees and heroic perfections of first
love, to carnal sluggishnesse, remissness and negligence. As the Angel of
Ephesus, Rev. 2. 4, etc. the Church her self, Cant. 5. 2, 3, 4. Or into some
erroneous offenses, as sometimes the dear servants of God fell, as David,
Peter, etc. 4. From temporary faith and professions, to looseness and
profaneness, worldliness, etc. As the bearers compared to the stony ground,
Matthew. 13. 20, 21, Luke 8. 6, 13. Yea, all the ground, (save the good ground)
fell away. 5. From all truth, common-graces, and all profession of them, to a
malicious, obstinate and incurable opposition thereof. And this is that
notorious Apostasy and sin against the Holy Ghost. Now there being many sorts
of falling away. This sin is ranked among Apostasies for the general nature of
it, for herein it agrees with them.

That the sin againg the Holy Ghost is an Apostasy or falling away, is plain
in Scriptures, that speak particularly of this sin. Such as commit this sin,
are said to Peccantes vocat Apostolus: non qui iu quovis genere delinquunt, sed
qui prorsus deserta Ecclesia se a Christo alienant, Calv. in ^eb. 10. 26.
sin wilfully, after they have received the knowledge of the truth, Heb. 10.
25. There Is a falling away intimated, viz. After truth known, and professed; a
wilful sinning against that truth, yea, a forsaking of public Assemblies,
verse 24. So dangerous it is to make separations from the Church of Christ, and
to fall off from Communion with true Church Assemblies, that it fearfully
prepares and disposes to this great sin; yea, they that commit this sin, are
expressly said to fall away; for it is impossible for those who were once
enlightened, -- If they shall fall away, etc. Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. So that the
general nature of this sin is Apostasy or falling away. Apostates and
Backsliders they are in the highest degree, that sin this sin. How dreadful is
the sin of Apostasy! (1.) Sharply threatened of God, Prove. 14. 14. Heb. 10. 38,
39. And (2.) Severely plagued, Matthew, 12. 43, 44, 45. compared with 2. Pet. 2.
20, 21, 22.

II. The more special Nature of this Sin against the Holy Ghost, whereby it is
distinguished from other sins, is considerable in the (1) Subject, (2)
Properties, and (3) Terms of this Apostasy.

1. The peculiar Subject of Apostatizing, or falling away, is, Hypocritical
professors, viz. Hypocritical false-hearted professors of Christianity in
the bosom of the Church, who have received some large measure of illumination,
and common gifts or graces of the Holy Ghost. These are the men (who not having
a true foundation of grace) are in greatest and nearest hazard of any other of
falling into the Sin against the Holy Ghost, by their Apostasy; For 1. No other
sort of persons are in this hazard and danger, as was evidenced before, Sect.
1. page 62, etc. 2. Scripture plainly teaches us that Hypocritical
professors, especially those that have attained the highest formal perfections
and temporary accomplishments from the Holy Ghost, are the very persons that
commit this sin. Who were they that our Savior so warnes of their blaspheming
of the Holy Ghost? But the Pharisees, Ma^th. 12. 24, 25, 31, 32. And the
Scribes, Mark 3. 22, 28, 29. And what were the Scribes and Pharisees but
notorious Hepocrites? Mat. 5. 20. and 23. 13, 14, 15. 23, 25, 27, 29. Who were
those whom the Apostle intimates to be likely to sin this sin, but such as were
once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made p^rtakers
of the H. Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
world to come? Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. Who also forsaking the public Church-
Assemblies, sin wilfully after they have received the knowledge of the Truth,
and after they have been sanctified with the blood of the Covenant, Heb. 10.
25. 26, 29. How sanctified? Not inwardly, truly, and savingly sanctified, (as
Erat autem Sanctificatio Apostatarum non internased externain professione fidei
and participatione Sacramentorum externa consi sten^. Era^t sans^ficati, h. c.
a Judaeis and Paganis perfossine segre gati, and pro veri^ Christiani^ habit.
Loqui tur enim secundum judicium charitatis, quae omnes de Doctrina foris
consentientes habet pro Sanctificatis, licet non omnes cordibus vere sint
Sanctificati. D. Pa^us in Comment. ad H^b. 10. 29.
Interpreters observe) but only externally, seemingly, and in appearance;
consisting in external profession of faith, and participation of the
Sacraments; whereby they were visibly severed from Pagans and Heathens, and
reputed in the judgment of charity, Christians. Now all these qualifications
raise a man no higher then to the pitch of formal Hypocrites, or Hypocritical
professors. And yet these are the very men who sin against the Holy Ghost. Not
that all such Hypocrites run into this sin; but that none but such Hypocrites
thus sin. Convenit soli^sed non omni: Prop. secundo modo, This is the subject
sinning, or falling-away.

2. The properties of this falling-away, which render it the most dangerous and
pernicious Apostasy in the world; are these three. It is, 1. Universal. 2.
Final; and 3. Wilful or Malicious.

1. An universal Apostasy, or falling-away. This is a first property of this
Sin against the Holy Ghost. This the height of a Apostasy, that it is
Universal. Partial, particular fallings away from some truths only, to some
errors; from some degrees of profession, of grace, of obedience, only to some
graduall defects or decays therein, etc. may befall a Daid, a Peter, or the
exellentest Saint unglorifyed, and yet be pardonable: but this unpardonable Sin
is a Total, absolute, universal falling-away. Universal both in respect of
the (1.) Truth, and (2) Graces of the Holy Ghost. They that sin against the
Holy Ghost, they fall away both from the (1.) Profession, and (2.) Approbation
of all (1.) Truth, and (2) Grace, once received and professed,

Possibly there may remain in them some principle of truth, as That God is;
that Jesus Christ is: that there shall be a judgment: that there shall be
another life after this, etc. Some relics also of common grace may remain in
them un obliterated, irritating and aggravating their malice and wickedness so
much the more, as some beams of illumination and conviction, which they would
feign totally extinguish, being full of vexation and madness at themselves
that they know so much: but it is one thing to have these remaining in them,
another thing to profess them and approve them. Now that this their
falling-away is so universal* is notably hinted to us, Heb. 6. 1, to 7. For
first, here the principles of Christianity or the fundamental Doctrines of
Christ, are summarily enumerated, viz. (1.) Repentance from dead works: (2.)
Faith toward God: (3.) The Doctrine of Baptisms; (4.) and of laying on of
Hands; (5.) and of the Resurrection of the dead; (6) and of Eternal judgment,
ver. 1, 2. These are very comprehensive principles, in which all other
Evangelicall truths may be well comprised; These seem to be the heads of the
Apostles Catechism in the primitive Church. Secondly, Here are also reckoned
up many common gifts and Graces of the Holy Ghost, and that so comprehensively
also, that all the common graces of the Spirit may be easily included therein;
viz. (1.) Enlightening. (2.) Tasting the heavenly gift. (3.) Partaking of the
Holy Ghost. (4.) Tasting the good word of God, (5.) and the powers of the world
to come, ver, 4, 5. Thirdly, here is intimated a possibility of falling away
both from all these truths, and all these common Graces of the Holy Ghost, to
that unpardonable Sin, ver. 4, 5, 6. This falling-away is afterward by this
same Apostle called Sinning wilfully after the receiving of the knowlodge of
the Truth, Heb. 10. 26. Which may well imply both falling from truth and grace.

Thus that judicious Calv. in Comment. in Heb. 10. 26.
Calvia, understands the Apostle here, not of some Particular, but of an
Universal defection; the Faith of Christ, and grace of Christ being wholly
cast off. And elsewhere he says Notandum est duplicem esse lapsum: alter est
Particularis, alter universal is. Qui in specie aliqua, ut etiam pluribus modis
deliquit, a Christiani hominis, statu lapsus est. Itaqne omnla peccata totidem
sunt lapsus. Verum Apostolus non de furro, aut perjurio, aut caede, aut
ebrietate, aut adulterio hic disputat, sed notat universalem ab Evangelio
defectionem, ubi non aliqua in part Deum offendit peccator, sed ejus gratia se
penitus abdicat. Atque ut hoc melius intelligatur, subaudienda est Antithesis
inter Dei gratias quas recensuit, and hunc lapsum. Labitur enim qui deficit a
verbo Domini, qui lucem ejus extinguit, qui se gustu Doni coelestis private,
quiparticipationem Spiritus deserit. Hoc autem est in totum Deo renunciare.
Nunc videmus quosnam a spe veniae excludat: nempe Apostatas qui se a Christi
Evangelio quod prius amplexi erant, and a Dei gratia alienarunt; quod nemini
contingit quin peccet in Spiritum Sanctum. Io. Calvin. Comment. in Heb. 6. 6.
, It is to be noted, there is a double falling-away, Particular and universal.
He that in any kind, or several ways offends; he falls from the state of a
Christian man, therefore all sins are so manyfals. But the Apostle does not
here dispute of Theft, or Perjury, or Murder, or Drunkenness, or Adultery;
but he notes an universal defection from the Gospel, when a sinner offends not
God in some one respect, but withdrawes himself from his grace altogether. And
that this may be the better understood, the Antithesis betwixt the graces
reckoned up, and this falling away, is to be observed. For he falls away, that
makes defectian from the Word of the Lord, that extinguisheth the light of it,
that deprives himself of the taste of the heavenly gift, that forsake the
participation of the Spirit: And this is to r^sounce God totally. Now we see
whom he sec^des from hope of pardon: viz. Apostates who withdraw themselves
from the Grace of God, and the Gospel of Christ which they had formerly
embraced; which befalls no man, but he sins against the Holy Ghost. So he. Thus
also those learned Interpreters, T. Bez. in annotat. ad Heb. 6. 4, and 6.
Beza, and David Paraus in Comment. i^ Heb. 6. 6
D. Paraeus understand here, An universal Apostasy: let the Reader consult
their words. Thus also Master Now let us see the manner of rebellion, how far
they fall away: first, we must observe what points the Apostle has before
named. In the beginning of the Chapter he mentions Repentance from dead
works, Faith toward God, The Doctrine of Baptismes, and laying on of hands,
and Resurrection from the dead, and eternal judgment; which here he calls
the beginning and foundation of Christianity. Then, he speaks of an Apostasy
or, falling-away from all these point^ here named, even from the foundation and
first beginnings of the Christian Faith; so that all the former light is quite
put out, and the first understanding is all taken away. They laugh now at
Repentance; and the first Faith they account it foolishness; They esteem not
of our Baptism, no more then of the washing of their hands; and for any
Confirmation or solemn receiving them into the Church of God, they are not for
it; The Resurrection of the Dead does but feed them with merry conceit; they
think pleasantly with themselves what manner of bodies they shall have; The
Eternal judgment, though it make them sometimes afraid, yet they encourage
themselves again, and say, Tush, it is agreat way off. Thus have they turned
light into darkness, knowledge into ignorance, Hope into Error, Faith into
infidelity, Glory into shame, and Life into death. Speak to them of the Son of
God, they make a jest with the mau of Galilee: Tell them of the Savior of the
world, they will call him the Carpenters Son: Such a General Apostasy the
Apostle speaks of, and this he calls the fall, from which men cannot rise
again by Repentance. Mr. Deering in his Readings on Heb. 6. Lect. 27. London
1597.
Deering in his excellent Lectures on the Hebrews, counts this an universal
Apostasy, of which here the Apostle speaks; because his book is scarce, I have
here annexed his words in the Margin. So that this falling away is not Partial,
but universal.

2 A Final Apostasy. A departure from God, Christ, grace, the Church, without
return: A ruin without repair: An Apostasy to the end of a man's life without
recovery; A backsliding for ever. David fell, but David rose again; Peter fell
and that fearfully, but it was but for a while, for a few hours; He went out
and wept bitterly, Mat. 26. 75. but this falling-away so as to sin against
the Holy Ghost, is not only universal, but also Final. For, 1. It is
impossible to renew them again unto repentance, Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. And they that
so fall, as to fall beyond the possibility of rising again by repentance, must
needs fall finally. 2. There remains no possibility of pardon to such. He that
shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, has never forgiveness, but is in
danger of eternal damnation, Mark. 3. 29. Luke 12. 10. If we sin wilfully
after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more
sacrifice for sins, Heb. 10. 26. And where there is no place for pardon,
that is final offense. 3. Death eternal is the certain and inevitable reward
and event of this sin. See 1 John 5. 16. Mark. 3. 29. Heb. 10. 27. Thus this
falling away is not only universal, but Final.

3. A wilful and malicious Apoctasy, viz. Not Apostasy or falling away through
mere ignorance, inconsiderateness or infirmity, against the deliberate
Resolution and habitual disposition of heart and will, or through violent push
of temptation, which may be incident, even to the best of Saints; But an
obstinate falling away out of a man's own free spontaneous Election, against
knowledge and conscience, out of a malicious wilfulness of spirit; fixedly and
peremptorily resolved to cast off the truth and ways of God, whatever God or
man shall say or do to the contrary. Such is their Apostasy that sin against
the Holy Ghost as these words intimate, For if we sin wilfully after that we
have received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for
sins, -- Heb. 10. 26. The word. [(...)] translated sinning wilfuly; implies
thus much in the judgment of learned men. Here (says (...) pro (...).
Sivoluntarie peccaverimus. Hic intellig it peccatum non quodvis, sed
secessionis ab ecclesia: nec secessionem quamvis ex infirmitate, metu aut
ignorantia, sed (...) factam. (...) autem ^eri docent Philosophi ca, quae nec
violentia nec ignorantia, sed sponteano voluntatis motu fiunt. Ergo defectionem
intelligit, non violenter extortam a Tyrannis, aut me^u factam, aut ex
ignorantia admissam [quia mox addit, (...),] sed voluntary, hoc est,
deliberata voluntate and consilio malicio^e commissam. D. Pareus in Comment. ad
Hebr. 10. 26.
Pareus) He understands not every sin, but secession from the Church; nor every
secession out of infirmity, fear or ignorance, but that which is done
wilfully; and Philosophers tell us those things are done wilfully, which are
done neither through violence nor ignorance, but by the spontaneous motion of
the will. He understands therefore a Defection not extorted by Tyrants through
violence, or admitted through fear or ignorance (because he presently adds,
after we have received the knowledge of the Truth) but wilfully, i. e.
maliciously committed by deliberate will and counsel. So he. To the like
purpose also that learned Vltro (...). Heb (...) Chinnam Quod de iis dicitur
qui sine ulla causa, aut etiam causae speciealiquid faciunt. Itaque iis
convenit, non qui simpliciter scientes peccant (alioquin actum fuisset de
Davide and Petro. Et quis tandem centies millies non esset hac ratione aeternae
morti mancipatus?) Sed iis demum qui ex professo resilientes in universum a
Christo, delectantur impietate and bellum indicunt perspectae viritati, uti
fecit Saul, Julianus Apostata, Ariu^, and alii, quorum execranda est memoria.
B^z Annotat. in Heb. 10. 26.
Beza expounds this word. This word [(...) ultroneously] is said of them, who
do any thing without any cause or show of cause. Therefore it agrees to them,
not who simply sin knowingly; (for then farewell David and Peter. And by this
reason who should not be an hundred thousand times mancipated to eternal
death?) but to them who professedly and universally departed from Christ, are
delighted in impiety, and make war against the known Truth, as did Saul,
Julian the Apostate, Arius and others of execrable memory. Thus their falling
away is wilful, i. e. Not only committed with knowledge, but also with free
consent, obstinacy, yea, and maliciousness of will. And this interpretation is
the more confirmed by the Apostles subsequent expressions, of treading under
foot the Son of God, of counting the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing,
and of doing despite to the Spirit of Grace, verse. 29. in the forehead of
which actions malice is engraven in Capital Letters. Thus this falling away is
not only universal and final, but also wilful and malicious.

These three Properties of this grand Apostasy, viz. (1.) Universalnesse. (2.)
Finalnesse, and (3.) Maliciousness, must be taken conjunctim non divisim,
jointly altogether, not dis-joyntly or severally one from another, if by them
we would describe the Sin against the Holy Ghost, and rightly understand the
Scripture about it; for its possible that men may fall totally and finally, and
yet not commit this sin against the Holy Ghost, unless also they fall
maliciously. Excellently that learned D. Par. Comment. in Epist. Pauli ad Hebr.
c. 6. ver. 6.
D. Paraeus expresses himself to this point; wherewith I shall close up this
branch. We must note that there are diverse degrees of falling, and as it were
four kinds. 1 Partial falls into some error or some sin, as many Fathers,
Irenaeus, Lactantius, etc. fell into the Heresy of the Chiliast's; David fell
into murder and adultery. Of these the Apostle speaks not; it is not impossible
to repent of these. 2. A total Fall or renouncing of the whole Christian
faith: but through infirmity; and therefore not final. As Peter by denying
Christ seems to fall totally: but he repeneed with tears. So Marcellinus fell
through infirmity to idolatry, and many other Christians under persecution, but
afterward repented. And when Novatus understood this saying of such, (viz.
Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6.) he erred, and the event evidenced, that it was ill wrested
against them. Nor was it impossible for Peter, Marcellinus, and others lapsed
truly to repent. As Cyprian, Oratione de lapsis, and histories do testify. 3.
A total and final fall, but not malicious; i. e. not done of purposed malice,
but from other causes, which Christ adumbrated in his Parable of the seed
falling on rocky and thorny ground, Matthew. 13. Some are deterred by
persecutions, others are withdrawn from Religion, by hopes of honors,
Pleasures, and the cares of this life, and that finally: yet without blasphemy
and persecution, rather through a kind of security and sluggushnesse. So diverse
departed from Christ, and walked no more with him, being offended at his Sermon
about eating his flesh, Ioh. 6. Properly the Apostle does not speak of these,
because though these be not renewed by repentance, yet is it not impossible for
them to be renewed. And sometimes God gives these grace, to return into the
way 4. A total, final, and malicious faling away. A defection from the truth
certainly acknowledged; not through fear or infirmity: but of purposed malice
and counsel, joined with the final hatred, blasphemy and Persecution thereof.
As we read, Julian the Apostate, Lucian and Porphyry, to have fallen, and as
many other Apostates to this day have fallen. This falling is that which Christ
calls the sin against the Holy Ghost; John, The sin to death, for which we are
not to pray, because it is irremissible. Thus he, And thus much touching the
three properties of this sin against the Holy Ghost, this dreadful Apostasy,
which is (1.) Universal, (2.) Final, and (3.) Malicious.

III. The Termini. i. e. The Terms of this Apostasy or falling away, laid
down in this description, are of two sorts, viz. (1.) The Term from waich
they fall, and (2.) The Term to which they fall. That, denotes what good they
forsake: This, what evil they embrace.

1. The Terminus a Quo, or Term from which they fall, denoting the good they
cast off, viz. The Truth, and Common Graces, once Received and Professed. They
fall both from the Profession and Approbation of the whole Truth, and all Grace
received, Heb. 6. 1, to 7. compared with, Heb. 10. 26. This has been
sufficiently cleared before; especially in opening the first property of this
Apostasy, viz. Universality of it.

2. The Terminus ad quem, Or the Term to which they fall, containing the evil
which they embrace, and practice, who sin against the Holy Ghost, which is
chiefly threefold, ^d all extremely wicked and desperate. (...) Blasphemous
despiting of the Spirit of Grace. (...) Horrid contempt and malice against the
^nne of God. And 3. Violent Persecution of the way of Christianity.

1. Blasphemous despiting of the Spirit of Grace. This is one extremity to which
such Apostates fall. Hence our blessed Savior calls it A speaking against the
Holy Ghost, -- and The Blas^hemy against the Holy Ghosh, Matthew. 12. 31, 32. The
Apostle calls it, doing despite unto the Spirit of Grace, Heb. 10. 29.
Blaspheming and D^spiting for substance come much to one (see these terms
formerly opened in the names given to this sin, p. 63, 64.) so that I put them
both together. It is a Blasphe^s despiting, or a despiting blasphemy of the
Spirit of Grace. Oh how much malice and rankling venom is couched in this
sin! To blaspheme man is sinful: what is it then to blaspheme the great God
of Heaven and earth? what to despite that holy Spirit, by whom (if ever) we
must be illuminated clearly, santified graciously, and comforted sweetly?

2. Horrid contempt and malice against the Son of God. The Spirit of Grace is
the Spirit of Christ, communicated from Christ the head, to his whole mystical
body, and all his true members. See Romans 8. 2, 9. 2 Cor. (...). 17, 18.
Therefore this sweet Spirit of grace cannot be thus villainously blasphemed and
reproachfully vilified; but therein also Jesus Christ who sends forth this
Spirit of grace, must needs be blasphemed, and most intolerably debased. Now
this grand contempt and indignity, which they that sin against the Holy Ghost
cast upon Jesus Christ, is set forth in four most pathetick expressions in
Scripture, viz.

1. They crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, Heb. 6. 6. What is it
to crucify the Son of God afresh? Answ. To commit such a sin as did Judas,
Pilate, the Jews, the soldiers, in betraying and murdering of Jesus Christ
the Lord of glory, and this by a painful, shameful, and cursed kind of
death: To murder a son of man, is so dreadful a sin, that it cries to God for
vengeance, Genesis 4. 10. what is it then to murder the Son of God? what to
crusify him, which is a double murder? yet this do all Apostates that sin
against the Holy Ghost, by denying the Son of God, which was once crucified for
our sins; they will not be saved by his death, they count it invalid,
insufficient, accept it not, but reject it, etc. and therefore for them Christ
must be crucified a second time, (which is impossible; for Christ dies no
more) if ever they be saved, there being no salvation or redemption, but by him
and his blood, Act. 4. 12. Heb. 9. 22. But, what is it to crucify the Son of
God to themselves? Answ. Calvin. Comment. in Epist, ad Heb. c. 6. 6. D. Parus
in Commen. in Heb. 6. 6.
Crucifigunt in ipsis. i. e. quantum in ipsis est. That is, as much as in them
lies. Though they do not actually crucify Christ, as once the Jews and
soldiers did; yet they would, were it possible, even dethrone him, and pluck
him from his Fathers right hand, and destroy him, as once the Jews did for an
impostor, a seducer, a blasphemer, and a seditious person, their malice is such
against him, that were it possible, they would do all this unto him; According
to that known maxim, Omnis Apostata est osor and Persecutor sui ordinis.
Every Apostate is an Hater and Persecutor of his own Order.

2. They put him to an open shame, Heb. 6. 6. The Greek word here (...)
properly signifies to diffame, or to expose to ignominy, or to make one a
public example, or infamous example. Thus its said of Joseph in reference to
Mary, he would not (...) i. e. make her a public example. Matthew. 1. 19. Thus
they that crucified Jesus Christ, did put him to an open shame by scorns,
scoffs, raunts, jeares, revilings, etc. whilst he hanged upon the cross.
Thou that destroyest the Temple and buildest it in three days, save thy self:
If thou be the Son of God, come down from the cross. -- He saved others,
himself he cannot save: if he be the King of Israel, let him now come down
from the Cross, and we will believe him. -- Matthew. 27. 39, to 45. Much like to
them do base Apostates by vile scorns, reproaches and blasphemies, put Christ
to an open shame, wickedly counting him not a Savior, but an impostor; not
freely paying a price for our sins, but duly sustaining the deserved punishment
of his own sins, etc. horrid blasphemies! Thus Julian the Apostate in scorn
called him Galilaean, The Carpenter, The Carpenters son, etc. shall not the
just God that avengeth the injuries of his Saints, avenge the blasphemies of
his Son?

3. They tread under foot the Son of God, Heb. 10. 29. This is an higher degree
of insolency and contempt of the Lord Christ, then both the former. The
villainous Jews and soldiers did crucify Christ and put him to an open shame,
yet we read not that they trod under foot the Son of God. The pride, impudency
and malice of these Apostates against Christ far transcends theirs; for they
tread the Son of God under foot; they trample upon him. i. e. they account of
him, and deal with him, most visely, abjectly, contemptibly, despicably, as
the filth and offscouring of the world; not prizing him as a Savior, nor
fearing him as a Judge, not accepting and believing in him as a Mediator. For,
as Quomodo conculcatquis Filium Dei? Quando enim eoindigne participatur per
Sacrameta, ne^ne grande pecatu^ co^mittit? no^neillu^ conculca^? no^ne ipsu^
con tenit? sicut enim ea quae conculcamus, nullius momenti pendimus sic and qui
libere peccant absque timore and absquetoenitentia, Christum nullius momenti
exislimant nec eum judice^ futuru^ formidant. D. Ambr. Co^. in Ep. od ^br. 10.
Ambrose observes, They are things of basest and vilest account, which we tread
under foot; we tread not gold, pearls or Jewels, but mire and dirt under foot.
What? shall dust and ashes, sinful worms lift up themselves so desperately,
as to tread under foot the ever-blessed Son of God? hear oh heavens! -- yet
this is the fruit of this cursed Apostasy.

4. Finally, They count the blood of the Covenant wherewith they were
sanctified, an unholy thing, Heb. 10. 29. (1.) The blood of Christ is called
the blood of the Covenant, because the N. Covenant, or New Testament was
ratified and confirmed by the blood and death of Christ the Testator, Heb. 9.
15, 16, 17. Hence Sacramentally the cup in the Lords Supper; is called the New
Testament in his blood, or his blood of the New Testament, Mat. 26. 28. 1. Cor.
11. 25. because it signifies, seals and exhibits to the believer Christ's
blood. whereby the N. Testament was stablished. (2.) Apostates, are said to be
sanctified by this blood of the Covenant, not really and indeed, but formally
and in appearance, in respect of their visible profession; whence in judgment
of charity men took them to be sanctified (3.) To count this blood of the
Covenant [(...),] i. e. common blood, is to count it not pure, sacred,
meritorious blood: but profane, impure, unholy. Compare Acts. 10. 15. (4.)
Apostates thus vilify Christ's invaluable blood shed for our redemption,
accounting it but as the blood of a common man, or as of a delinquent, or as
the blood of the thieves crucified whith him. This blood of Christ they
practically profane, whilst they return after a holy profession of Christ,
with the dog to the vomit and the sow to the wallowing in the mire (as Factus
est pergratiam corpus Christi, and scipsum facit corpus diaboli and sanguine^.
Christi, polluit, in eo quod mundatus est, and ad vomitum revertitur pristinum:
and seipsum per poenitentiam iteru^ mundare neglextrit, spiritum gratiae
injuri^ns. D. Ambros. Commen* in Epist. ad Hebr. 10.
Ambrose interprets it;) not willing to cleanse themselves by repenting.

Thus they that sin against the Holy Ghost, (1.) Crucify the Son of God afresh:
(2.) Put him to an open shame: (3.) Tread him under foot: and (4.) count his
blood an unholy thing. O what horrid contempt and malice is this against the
Son of God!

3. Uiolent Persecution of the way of Christianity. Such and so extreme is the
madness and malice of these back-sliders both against the Spirit of Grace and
the Son of God, that they break off from profession to Persecution of
Christianity, and to a deadly hatred of the Church and members of Jesus Christ.
And hence some think the Apostle styles these Apostates, (...), The
adversaries, Heb. 10* 27. because they are the sworn enemies of Christ, the
Gospel^ and all Christians, and (if it were possible) would destroy them. As
Julian the Apostate, who (as the Histor. Ecclesias^. Magdeburg. Ce^t. 4. c. 3.
p. 64. ad 7 (...) B^sil. 1624.
Centuriators observe out of Eutropius) was from his childhood trained up in
piety, and when he came to the Empire, he carried himself with much clemency
toward Christians; He called home such as Constantius had banished for
religion; caused their goods to be restored to them; commanded it to be
proclaimed to his people that they should not hurt the Christians, nay, nor
reproach them. But afterward (as is noted out of Hierom) he denied Christ in
France, and turned a most bloody and barbarous butcher to the poor Christians;
Histor. Ecclesiast. Magdeburg. Cen. 4. c. 3. p. 89 Basil. 1624
of which the Centuriators record diverse dreadful instances; afterward going
to war against the Persians, he swore he would make war against the
Christians, if he returned conqueror. But there his army was first distressed
through wan^ of corn; and afterward himself by a Persians subtilty being led
into a desert, was deadly wounded either by a blow from the Devill^ (as some
think) or by a spear, or by an arrow* shot from heaven; whereupon, taking an
handful of his own blood, he flung it up into the air, and burst out into
that wicked contemptuous expression against Christ, Vicisti Galilaee: (...).
Thou man of Galilee, thou have overcome (...); and so miserably dyed.

And thus much for opening the Nature of ^is sin against the Holy Ghost; that
we might see wherein it properly consists.

III.
The Grievousnesse of this sin against the Holy Ghost, comes next to be
considered. And Surely this is such a sin of sins, such a Centaur of
transcendent malice and wickedness, such an extract of deadly poison, that
(...) pen, nor tongue, nor thought of man can ^ly reach it. My present scope in
this small Tractate, will not permit me to expatiate: and therefore let me
succinctly propound only these few Aggravations of this horrid sin.

1. This is the highest sin against the saving Remedy. The lapsed state of
man in the first Adam, ^s of all other in this world our deepest and most
desperate malady, Act. 8. 13. Ephesians. 2. 1, 2, 3. Jesus Christ, and the Spirit of
g^ce, are of all other the most effectual and only sufficient remedy; Jesus
Christ by meritorious working out of complete Redemption and salvation for us,
Heb. (...). 12, ^3, 14. and 10. 12, 13, 14. Heb. 7. ^5. Act. 4. 12. The Spirit
of grace by immediate and effectual application of Christ and all his grade
unto us, Ioh. 16. 9, etc. Gal. 4. 4, 5, 6. Romans 8. 2, 15, 16, 26, 27. Without
these all the world cannot afford us Redemption, Adoption, Justification,
Sanctification, true Consolation or eternal salvation; but by Christ and his
Spirit we have all. Now they that sin this sin, they sin against the Remedy,
and that wilfully, maliciously, incurably. As for Jesus Christ, (1) They
crucified him afresh; (2.) They put him to an open^ (...); (3.) They tread him
under foot; and (4.) Count ^is blood of the Covenant^an unholy thing, Heb. 6.
6. and 10. 29. As for the Spirit of grace, (1.) They depart from his truth;
(2.) They fall away from his grace; (3.) They despite him; (4) They blaspheme
him, Heb. 6. 1, to 7. and 10. 29. Matthew. 12. How should such sinners ever be
redeemed, called, justified, sanctified, or saved, that thus sin against the
very Remedy? unbelief and impenitency are sins against the Gospel-Remedy, but
not aggravated with that obstinacy and maliciousness, as this sin is. That
Patient that is so far from applying, that he hates and abhorres the Remedy
that should cure him, flings the Physic to the ground, curses and reviles the
Physician, yea, and treads him under foot; is he ever likely to be cured? So in
this case spiritually.

2. Hence, This sin never is, never can possibly be repented of. So the Apostle
tells us, For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, -- if they
shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance, Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. As if
he should say, It is impossible for such Apostates to repent. Note, he says
not, It is improbable, unlikely, or difficult for them to repent: but (...), It
is impossible to renew them to repentance. To whom is it impossible? (1.)
Impossible to themselves, to renew themselves, for if carnal men that never
thus relapsed, cannot renew themselves, no more then a blackamore can change
his skin, and the leopard his spots, it being impossible a bad tree should
bring forth good fruit; how much less can such Apostates renew themselves to
repentance? (2.) Impossible to their Teachers to renew them to repenance with
all their Exhortations, Promises, Threats, Prayers or ministerial
Administrations. They are but instruments, planting, watering, only God gives
the increase. 1 Cor. 3. 6, 7. Only God gives Repentance, 2 Timothy 2. 25. Yea, 3.
Impossible (in some sense) unto God himself, as some think; not through any
impotency in God, but in respect of his infinite justice, which cannot choose
but take vengeance of such heinous and malicious offenders. And the Apostle
gives two great Reasons of the impossibility of such back-sliders Repentance.
1. From the atrocity and grievousnesse of the sin committed, viz. a sin of
extreme malice against Jesus Christ, Seeing they crucify to themselves the Son
of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. Which words have been formerly
explained, p. 112, etc. 2. From the just judgment of God inflicted upon them,
set forth under the metaphor of good and bad ground; For the earth which
drinks in the rain that comes often upon it, and brings forth herbs meet for
them by whom it is dressed, receives blessing from God. But that which bears
thorns and briars, is rejected, and is nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be
burned, Heb. 6. 6, 7, 8. i. e. As an husbandman that tils, manures, waters,
plants, bestows much cost and pains upon ground, and after all it brings forth
nothing but briars; thorns; nettles, weeds, etc. he will never bestow more cost
upon it, its worthy to be cursed, and burnt up: so after God has by his
Gospel Ordinances bestowed much husbandry upon men, and afforded them also many
heavenly influences, viz. common gifts and graces of his Spirit, and they
notwithstanding bring forth nothing but thorns and briars of this cursed
Apostasy, God will give them up to final impenitency and hardness of heart,
to their own Destruction.

3. Hence, This sin against the Holy Ghost is unpardonable. So Christ tells us,
The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven, neither in this
world, neither in the world to come, Matthew. 12. 32. that is, as Mark expresses
it, He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, has never forgiveness,
Mark. 3. 29. This sin is Unpardonable, not as if it were in its own nature
beyond Gods pardoning mercy, or beyond Christ's purging merit, both which are
infinite: but because it is always accompanied with final impenitency, and
therefore God will not bestow his pardon, Christ will not apply his merit. To
like effect the Apostle says, If we sin wilfully after that we have received
the knowledge of the Truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins, Heb.
10. 26. This sins unpardonablenesse heightens this sins grievousnesse above all
other sins in the world. What other sin but has been repented of, and upon
repentance pardoned? This beyond all Manasses sins, they were repented of, and
pardoned; beyond all Saul's sins, 1 Timothy 1. 13, 16. Act. 26. 9, to 12. they were
repented of, and pardoned; beyond their sins that murdered Christ through
ignorance, for they repented and were forgiven, Act. 2, 36, 37, 38, 41. but
this shall never be forgiven.

4. Hence, This sin is inevitably damnable. If this sin be never repented of,
never pardoned, it must needs always be punished with damnation and eternal
death, and that inavoidably. He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost,
has never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation, Mark. 3. 29.
If we sin wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of the Truth,
there remains no more sacrifice for sins; But a certain fearful looking for
of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the Adversaries. He that
despised Moses Law, dyed without mercy, under two or three witnesses; of how
much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden
under foot the Son of God, etc? Heb. 10. 26, 27, 28, 29. Here Is, 1. Judgment,
fiery indignation, and that devouring, yea, much sorer punishment, then death
without mercy; what can this be but eternal damnation? 2. Here Is the certainty
of it, and that without hopes, or place remaining for any more Sacrifice for
sin; what is this but inevitable damnation? Hence such as sin against the Holy
Ghost, are resembled to ground nigh unto cursing, whose end is to be burned,
Heb. 6. 8. Think now sadly of the inevitablnesse of eternal damnation ever
attending upon this sin, and then consider how grievous it must needs be.

5. Hence, This sin is usually a most intolerable torture to the Conscience;
This plainly flows from all the former. For this being (1.) The highest sin
against the saving Remedy; (2.) Never repented of; (3.) Unpardonable; and (4.)
Inevitably damnable; How can the concience, reflecting upon all this, choose but
be unspeakablytortured in this present world, with horror, terror, despair
and self-Confusion? Which the Apostle calls A certain fearful looking for of
judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries, Heb. 10.
27. Oh what a torment, what a rack, what an hell aforehand is this to the
Conscience, to think that Hell is inevitable, and yet intolerable? the furious
horror hereof made Judas restless till he had hanged himself, Matthew. 27. 1,
to 7. Yea, sometimes the anguish and sting of Conscience is so intolerable,
that they desperately wish themselves in hell, that they might not be so
overwhelmed with torturing fears, but feel the worst; but alas! when they
shall come into hell, their worm of Conscience will never dye, but fret and
g^aw the heart strings of the soul for evermore.

6. Finally, this sin is so heinous, that the pardon of it is not to be prayed
for. There is a sin unto death (says John) I do not say ye shall pray for it,
1. Joh. 5. 16. And that sin which may not be prayed for, is counted desperate
and past remedy; for Prayer is one remedy: now the more remediless, the more
grievous.

Thus far of the second thing to be evidenced, viz. What the sin against the
Holy Ghost is, and wherein it consists, viz. of (1.) The Names, (2.) Nature,
and (3.) Grievousnesse of it.

SECT. III.
Now briefly to the third and last thing propounded for clearing this Case of
Conscience, viz. to show, What a vast difference there is betwixt the sinning
of Regenerate persons, and their sinning that sin against the Holy Ghost. And
this results by way of Corollary from all that has been already spoken. To
hint some particulars may be sufficient; as,

1. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, are such as are under the reign and
dominion of sin, viz. Hypocrites that never had in them any power of
godliness, but only a form, remaining still in their carnal condition: But
Regenerate persons (though sometimes they may fall grievously, (...) yet) are
delivered from the dominion and reign of sin, as has been showed.

2. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, were never advanced beyond the degree
of Hypocrites, as has been evidenced: But Regenerate persons are sincere and
upright, Psalm. 18. 22. 2 Cor. 1. 12. they partake of the truth of grace, power
of godliness, life of GOD.

3. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, universally fall away both from
Profession and Approbation of Truth and grace, as has been proved: But the
Regenerate never fall away thus universally, but only partially, and in some
particular respects only.

4. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, apostatize and fall away finally: But
though Regenerate persons sometimes fall Woefully, yet never finally; they
always rise again.

5. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, sin wilfully and maliciously: But (as
has been cleared) Regenerate persons sin out of weakness and infirmity, not
of malice or wilful obstinacy: they hate the evil which they do, Romans 7. 15.

6. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, sin desperately against the saving
Remedy, viz. both against the Ministry and Grace of the Holy Ghost, and also
against the blood and merit of the Son of God, as was declared: But they that
are regenerate, sin not thus against the saving Remedy.

7. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, are not in fear or trouble lest they
have sinned that sin, but are wickedly hardened: Regenerate persons are often
perplexed and afraid, lest they should have sinned it.

8. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, so sin, that it is impossible to
renew them again unto repentance: But they that are regenerate, repent of every
sin which they fall into, before they die, in the general or particular.

9. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, sin unpardonably: But all the sins of
regenerate persons are pardonable, and actually pardoned to them.

10. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, are tortered with a certain fearful
looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour them, Heb.
10. 27. But they that are Regenerate are justified, Romans 8. 29, 30. and being
justified, by faith, they have peace with God, and joy in hope of the glory of
God; and not only so, but even glory in tribulation, Romans 5. 1, 2, 3.

11. They that sin against the Holy Ghost, must not be prayed for, 1 John 5.
16. But we ought to pray for all Regenerate persons, not withstanding their
sins and frailties which they are subject to, James 5. 16. 1 Ioh. 5. 16.

12. Finally, they that sin against the Holy Ghost, shall certainly and
inevitably be condemned; as was proved. But Regenerate persons, not
withstanding their Actual or Original sins, shall certainly and infallibly be
saved, Romans 8. 29, 30. There being no condemnation to them which are in Christ
Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, Romans 8. 1.

These and diverse such like differences are very remarkable betwixt the sinning
of Regenerate persons, and their sinning that sin against the Holy Ghost:
whereby truly Regenerate Persons may discern how far they are from sinning that
great sin, notwithstanding all their fears and perplexities about it. For
whose satisfaction I have the more largely insisted upon this weighty Case.

Thus far of that 3. Evidence or sign of Regeneration, viz. The not committing
of sin. They that are borne of God do not commit sin, nor can sin, in that
sense, and in those respects, as have been explained.

IV.
Overcoming of Erroneous and Heretical IV.
Spirits, and their seducements; may be a fourth Sign or Evidence of
Regeneration. Believe not every Spirit, but try the Spirits, whether they are
of God: because many false Prophets are gone out into the world. -- Ye are of
God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in
you, then he that is in the world, 1 John 4. 1. 4. In these 4 Verses the
Apostles scope is to caution and encourage the faithful against all the
seducements of erroneous and heretcall, spirits then abounding. To this end,
(1.) He warnes them of their danger, Many false Prophets being gone out into
the world, v. 1. (2.) He directs them how to prevent harm by them; Negatively,
Believe not every spirit; Positively, Prove the spirits, etc. v. 1. (3.) He
gives them one eminent character of a true, and false spirit, viz. the
confessing, or not confessing of Jesus Christ, v. 2, 3. For (as Specialem notam
apponit, qua melius discernere veros Prophetas a falsis liceat. -- in Christum
scillicet, si cuti scopus est ad quem recta fides collimat, ita scopulu^ esse
ad quem impingunt omnes haeretici. Calv. Comment. in 1. Epist. Joan. 4. 2.
Calvin has well noted) Christ is the scope at which faith aims, and also
Christ is the rock against which all Heretics dash; either in respect of his
Person, Offices, or Ordinances. (4.) He comforts and encourages them in their
victory over these heretical Seducers and false Prophets; though they have
many sharp conflicts with them, yet they have conquered them got the day; Ye
have overcome them. This their victory is amplyfied, (1.) By the evidence that
it gives them of their own Regenerate condition; Ye are of God, little
children, and have overcome them. As if he had said, This is a pregnant token
or pledge to you, that you are borne of God, Joh. 1. 13. that you are in a
godly, gracious, regenerate condition; that you have overcome these heretics;
these false Prophets; ye have not been corrupted by, nor carried away with
their errors (2.) By the true cause or ground of this their victory, it was not
from their own skill or strength, In his own strength who can prevail against
the depths and subtilties of Satan and his instruments?) but only from the
power of God in them; for greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the
world. Satan is in the world in the wicked, especially in false Prophet; and
heretical Seducers, (who are therefores called his Ministers, 2 Cor. 11. 15.)
blinding and deceiving them, instigating and instructing them to deceive
others: But God, Christ, the Spirit, is in the people of God, anointing them to
understand all things, 1 Ioh. 2. 27. discovering to them the depths of Satan
and his Agents, 2. Cor. 2. 11. and preserving them so in the truth, as they
shall not be poisoned with the error of the wicked. Thus GOD in them, is
stronger then Satan in the world against them. In Gods strength, not their own
they overcome seducements to Error and Heresy; And this their victory
discovers they are of God

Obj. But overcoming of Error, Heresy, and seducements thereunto, seems not to
be a sure sign of Regeneration; for, 1. Sometimes even Gods own childeren are
overcome with erroneous opinions. One whom God had received into favor, and
should be holden up, yet might erroneously hold himself bound in conscience to
the legal difference of days and meats, under the Gospel, Romans 14. 1, to 7.
The Apostles themselves erroneously deemed, Christ should be a worldly King,
Mar. 10. 37, 41. And this error was not cured in them, though they were
eyewitnesses of his Passion and Resurrection, Act. 1. 6. And the Church of
Galatia erred grossly in the point of Justification, mingling Moses with
Christ, the works of the Law with Faith in justification, Gal. c. 3. c. 4. c.
5. Therefore all that are borne of God, do not overcome such errors and
heretical seducements. And 2. sometimes even carnal unregenerate persons may
hold, confess and maintain the truth: doubtless Jud as truly preached Christ,
yea the Devils themselves believe there is one God, Jam. 2. 19. yea, confessed
Christ to be the son of God, Mar. 1. 24. Therefore others overcome Error as
well as Gods people; and therefore, overcom^ng erroneous heretical
seducements, is no sure note of Regeneration.

Answ. For resolution in this material Objection, consider briefly these
following Positions, viz.

1. A grecious Regenerate person may sometimes be overtaken with an Error of
Opinion in lesser matters of Faith. As there are more weighty matters of the
Law, Mat. 23 23. and less weighty: so there are more or less weighty matters
of Faith, Fundamentals, and built upon the foundations. Proportionably there
may be Error against fundamentals, not holding the Head, etc. Col. 2. 19. and
there may be Errors only against lesser matters. These lesser Errors may
possibly befall godly regenerate persons; as the Error about Legal days and
meats in the times of the Gospel, incident to a dear child of God, Romans 14. 1,
to 6. And no wonder. For, (1.) God has no where promised to the dearest of his
servants an universal exemption from lesser or greater Errors. (2.) The best,
and perfectest of Gods people in this life have remaining in themselves the
foundation of Error and Heresy, many relics of darkness, weakness,
instability, etc, We know but in part. -- We see through a glass darkly, 1
Cor. 13. 9, 12. All men are liars, Romans 3. 4. 3. Unity of Faith, and of the
knowledge of the Son of God, or oneness of Judgments in all points, is to be
expected among all the Members of Christ's mystical body, till (as the Apostle
intimates) we all come unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of
the fullness of Christ, Ephesians 4. 13. And where there is not Unity of Faith and
Knowledge, there will be some diversity in Opinions; and diverse Opinions must
inevitably some of them be Erroneous, So that lesser Errors (though they are
part of the misery and reproach of the Saints in this life, and diseases which
they ought to labor against) may attend upon Gods own people.

2. Regenerate persons may perhaps for a time be ensnared in some Errors that
are more gross and dangerous, and that against fundamentals of faith. Christ
and his Offices are fundamentals, 1. Cor. 3. 11. Ephesians. 2. 20. yet the Apostles,
till the sending of the Holy Ghost upon them, were in an error about Christ's
Kingly office, taking it to be temporal rather then spiritual, Mark. 10. 37,
41. compared with Act. 1. 6. Justification by faith alone, a fundamental, R^m.
3. 28. Gal. 5. 4, 5, 6. yet for a season the Galatians labored under that
gross Error of the necessity of Legal works with Faith, to justification. So
that to be drawn into some gross Errors for a season, does not presently
conclude a nullity of grace; As also may appear by the three former Reasons.
Though it must needs be confessed, that it is a very sad, uncomfortable and
dangerous thing for any of Gods people to fall into such gross Errors. For,
1. hereby their Minds that should be treasuries of Truth, are darkened, Ephesians. 4.
18 corrupted, 2 Cor. 11. 3. bewitched, Gal. 3. 1. Now how grievous is it to
have a man's mind corrupted! The Leprosy in the head, was the worst of all
Leprosi^s, Lev. 13. 44. If the mind, the light be darkness, how great is that
darkness? Mat. 6. 23. It was Gods heavy plague upon the Gentiles, to be given
up [(...)] to a mind void of judgment, Romans 1. 28. 2. Hereby their souls,
which Christ has bought with his precius blood, shall be endangered: for
Heresies are works of the flesh, destructive, damnable, and shutting out of
Gods kingdom, if not repented of, Gal. 5. 19, 20, 21. with 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2. 3.
Hereby many weak ones are endangered to be carried with them into the same
Errors, out of that good opinion they have of their piety. Error spreads and
fret^ like a gangrene, 2 Timothy 2. 7. And it is no small sin to be guilty of
seducing Gods servants, Actively, Exemplarily, or but permissively. See Rev. 2.
20, 21, 22, 23. 4. Hereby in a word, the Name of God will be blasphemed, and
the way of Truth evil spoken of, 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2.

3. Though Gods people may fall into lesser, yea, sometimes into more gross
Errors for a time: yet there is a great deal of difference betwixt the Elect
and the children of God, and unregenerate, carnal, or hypocritical persons,
in reference unto Erroneous opinions, and the embracing of them. For,

1. The true children of God are not so facile and apt to be carried aside into
Error in opinion, especially against fundamentals, as carnal and hypocrites
are apt to be. They are not so unstable, fickle, wavering, mutable, unsettled in
matters of Faith and Religion, as carnal men are; not so easily tainted, and
carried about with every wind of doctrine, etc. There shall arise false Christ's
and false Prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch that (if
it were possible) they shall deceive the very Elect, Mat. 24. 24. That
comfortable Parenthesis, (if it were possible) intimates a possibility of
deceiving others, yet an impossibility of deceiving the Elect. It Is the
property of Christ's sheep to follow Christ, for they know his voic^; but a
stranger [viz. one that brings strange and false doctrines] will they not
follow, but will flee from him, because they know not the voice of strangers,
Joh. 10. 4, 5. It is observable that when the Holy Ghost tells us, that All
that dwell upon the Earth shall worship the Beast; yet the Elect are exempted.
All shall worship, -- whose names are not written in the Lambs book of life,
Rev. 13. 8. And elsewhere John testifies clearly, They went out from us (viz.
by embracing Antichristian doctrines, v. 18.) but they were not of us; for if
they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went
out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us, 1 John 2.
19. And Paul testifying to the Corinthians, that there must be (not only
divisions, but) also Heresies among them, that they which are approved may be
made manifest among them, 1 Cor. 11. 19. implies notably, That even in times
and places wherein Heresies abound, yet Gods approved ones will withstand and
reject Heresies, when others will embrace them; and so the approved, of sound
judgments, shall be manifested among all the rest.

Nor need this seem strange, that Gods elect children are not so apt to be
carried away with every wind of Error, as carnal hypocritical persons; for
they are better ballasted then these are, they have many protections and
preservations from Error, which carnal men have not. As, 1. Gods election is
their sure foundation to keep them from dashing upon the rocks of Error on
which others split themselves. Compare and consider well these two places, Mat.
24. 24. and 1 Timothy 2. 17, 18, 19. 2. Gods power through faith keeps them unto
salvation, 1 Pet. 1. 5. not their own, nor any mere created power, but Gods
power keeps them as in garrison (^s the Greek imports) and this through faith
apprehending and applying that Divine power. Faith imbarks the soul in the
arms of God omnipotent, and so makes weakness strong. And as Gods power
through faith keeps them from other enemies and impediments to salvation, so
from pernicious and damnable Heresies. 3. The spiritual anointing of the Holy
Ghost given them, teaches them all things, 1 John 2. 27. The Spirit searches
all things, even the deep things of God; So that through the Spirit they judge
all things, and have the mind of Christ, 1 Cor. 2. 15, 16. So that hereby they
are enabled to discern Truth, to detect and avoid Errors in judgment as well
as in practice: which carnal men cannot do, wanting this Anointing and
spiritual discerning. 4. Finally, The love of Truth in Gods people is much;
they are the children of Truth, 1 John 3. 19. They can do nothing against the
Truth, but for the Truth, 2 Cor 13. 8. Their loins are girt about with Truth,
Ephesians. 6. 14. and therefore they are hereby notably fenced against Error.
Whereas carnal and hypocritical men are either, (1) Men of corrupt minds,
destitute of the tr^th, 1 Timothy 6. 4, 5. resisting the truth, 2 Timothy 3. 8. and
turning away their ears from the truth, 2 Timothy 4. 4. Or, (2.) They hold the
truth in unrighteousness Romans 1. 18. Or, (3.) They are not able to come to the
knowledge of the truth, 2 Timothy 3. 7, Or, (4) They love not the truth, 2 These.
2. 9, 10. And no wonder such persons be unstable, wavering, and apt to embrace
lies and fables.

2. The true children of God do not so fully close with Errors in opinion, but
rather they are surprised and overtaken with them through infirmity, Romans 14.
1. The remains of darkness in their minds sometimes dazzling and prevailing
against the principle of light. So that as in practice they sin, [non voluntat^
plena, sed semi-plena] i. e. not with an whole, but with an half-will: So in
judgment they err not with an whole, but with an half-mind; the light of the
mind being against the Error, which the prevalent darkness entertains. But
carnal persons, whose whole minds are darkness, Ephesians. 5. 8 and enmity against
God, Romans 8. 7. having no spark of sanctified illumination in them at all; must
needs embrace Error with more full compliance and approbation.

3. The true children of God do not tenaciously and obstinately persist in
Errors, especially not in fundamental Errors, Errare possum, Haereticus esse
nolo.
They may ^re through invincible frailty, but they will not wilfully and
pertinaciously persevere in their Error, as is the property of Heretical
dispositions. Such have the anointing in them to teach them all things, which
consequently will in due time convince and recover them out of Error, 1 Ioh.
3. 27. A gracious heart is very ingenuous: Convince him but clearly of his
Error, he is ready to ^cknowledge it and reform it. Solomon not only
miscarried in his practice, but seems also to have erred grossly in his
judgment, thinking that happiness, satisfaction or contentment was to be
found in the empty bubble of the creature: But when his own large experience
confutes his opinion, how fully does he publish his Recantation to all Ages, in
Ecclesi^stes? David beholding the prosperity of the wicked, while the rod was
tied to his own back, All the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
morning, Psa. 73. (...), 14. began to harbor an erroneous opinion of his own
and their state: Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands
in innocence, v. 13. Thus he was ready even to condemn the generation of Gods
children, v. 15. But when he came into Gods sanctuary, and had his eyes there
opened, how ingenuously does he fool himself, yea, beast himself for it? So
foolish was I and ignorant, I was as a beast before thee, Psalm. 73. 22. August^
deserved highly of the Church of God for many excellent Books which he wrote,
but especially for his 2 Books of Retractations, and his 13 Books of
Confessions: For as in his Confessions he laments the Errors of his Practice,
which he had acted: so in his Retractations he condemns the Errors of his
judgment, which he had written; In both discovering a gracious self-denying
spirit, far from obstinacy in Error. That truth may be honored, he treads
his own honor in the dust, and says, Nec enim quisquam nisi imprudens, ideo
quia mea errata r^prehendo, me reprehendere audebit: sed si dicit, non ea
debuisse a me dici, quae postea mihi etia^ displicerent: verum dicit, and mecum
facit. Eorum quippe reprehensor est, quoru^ and ego. Neque enim ea reprehendere
debe^em, si dicere debuissem. Sed qui primas non potuit habere sapientiae,
secundas habeat parts modestiae: ut qui non voluit omnia impoenitenda dicere,
salte^ poeniteat quae cognoverit dicenda non fuisse. Aug. in lib. Retract.

erro^em aliquando emendemus. Aug. de ver^. Apost. sermon. 22. c. 10.


None but an imprudent man will blame me for blaming mine own errors; for if I
ought to have said them, I ought not to have blamed them; But he that could not
at first be wise, should yet afterward be modest: that not being able to say
only things not to be repented of, may at least repent of what he knows ought
not to have been said. Yea, afterward be cautions his Reader * not to imitate
him in Erring, but in reclaiming his Error. But contrariwise, a graceless
heart is wont to be obstinate in Error, will not yield, though often admonished,
though self condemned, Tit. 3. 10. As Augustine noted in his time, * An
heretical spirit is an incurable spirit: So may we observe in all ages, and
specially in this of our own, touching carnal men becoming heretical, how
impenitently; stubbornly, hopel^sly do they persist in their Errors and
Heresies; how few, if any reclaimed? This is a wicked disposition. Did ^ey fear
God (says * Augustine) they would ^y, To err is humane, but through animosity
to persist in Error is diabolical. It were best, ^f we never erred; It were
next that, that we ^mended our Error.

4. Though carnal men, yea, perhaps Devils themselves, may [contrary to some
errours] hold and confess some truths; yet they neither oppose errors, nor
hold and confess truth, as those do that are the childeren of God. And
therefore this hinders not, but that the overcoming of erroneous heretical
spirits, is a sign or evidence of such as are born of God. For,

1. Carnal men oppose not Error, embrace not truth, from any supernatural
illumination or spirit of discerning, but merely from carnal light, Natural or
Acquired. For all that is in and from carnal men, is, as themselves, merely
carnal they are in the flesh, Romans 8. 8. they are nothing but flesh, That which
is born of the flesh, is flesh, Joh. 3. 6. They are very darkness, Ephesians. 5. 8.
Hence therefore the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God,
for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are
spiritually discerned, 1 Cor. 2. 14. But the children of God oppose Error and
Heresy, and embrace the contrary Truths, from principles supernatural, viz.
from the Spirit of God revealing the things of God unto them, 1. Cor. 2. 10,
11, 12, 13, 15, 16. and enabling them to understand them so revealed, 1 John 2.
27.

2. Carnal men hold not, confess not the truth from sincere love to it; for
the carnal mind is enmity against God, Romans 8. 7. and where the mind it self
is enmity against God, can there be in the heart any sincere love to Gods
truth? Of carnal Heathens it is said, they liked not to retain God in their
knowledge, Romans 1. 28. and of carnal Gospellers it is said, Because they
received not the love of the truth that they might be saved, for this cause God
shall send them strong delusion, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 10, 11. But the children of God
sincerely embrace and profess the truth, in love; they are [(...)] i. e.
Truthing^ it in love, Ephesians. 4. 15. yea, they so love the truth, that they have
not loved their liberties and lives that they might defend and maintain it,
Rev. 2. 13. This difference Augustine Ecce modo audist^s in Evangelio, quod ait
Petrus, Tu es Christu^ filius Dei vivi: Legite, and invenietis dixisse
daemones, Scimus qui sis, filius Dei Petrus tame^ laudatur, Demon compescitur.
Una vox, facta diversa. Unde separantur istae duae confessiones? Laudatur amor,
damnatur ^mor. Non enim amore diacebant hoc Daemones, Tues filius Dei: timore
hoc dicebant, non amore. Denique illi in confessione dicebant, Quid nobis and
tibi? Petrus autem, Tecum sum (...) ad mortem. Aug. de verb. Apost. ser. 31. c.
9.
notably observed: Behold, ye have heard in the Gospel what Peter said, Thou
art Christ the Son of the living God, Mat. 16. 16. Read, and ^e shall find the
Devils said, We know thee ^ho thou art, the Son of God, Mar. 1. 24. But Peter
is commended, the Devils curbed: (...) same voice, diverse deeds. Where are
these (...) confessions differenced? Love is commended, Fear is condemned: for
the Devils said ^t this out of love, Thou art the Son of God: they said it in
fear, not in love.

And the same Dicit Petrus, Tu es Christus, filius Dei vivi: dicunt and
Daemones scimus qui scis, fiius Dei and sanctus Dei. Hoc Petrus, hoc and
daemones, eadem verba, non idem animus. Et unde constat? quia hoc Petrus cum
dilectione dicebat, quia fides Christiani cum dilectione est, Daemonis au tem
sine dilectione. Quomodo sine dilectione? Hoc dicebat Petrus, ut Christum
amplecteretur; hoc dicebant Daemones, ut Christus ab iis recederet. Nam
antequam dicerent, Scimus qui sis, (Tues) filius Dei; Quid nobis and tibi est,
dixerunt, Quid venisti ante tempus per^re nos? Aliud est ergo confiteri
Christum, ut teneas Christum; aliud confeteri Christum, ut repellas a te
Christum. Aug. expos. in epist. 1 I^annis, Tract. 10 de cap. 5.
Author elsewhere says, This said Peter, this the Devils also: the same words,
but not the same mind. But whence was it? because Peter spoke this with love;
for the faith of a Christian is with love: But the Devils faith is without
love. How without love? Peter said this, that he might embrace Christ: the
Devils said it, that Christ might depart from them, etc.

3. Carnal men, though they confess Go^ truth in words, yet they deny it in
dee^s; (...) contrary to the Lord and his truth, ^it. (...) 15, 16. But the
children of God not only believe the truth, 2 These. 2. 13. and profess or
confess the truth: But they also act for the truth, 2 Cor. 13. 8. and walk in
the truth, 2 John 4. 3 John 3, 4.

V.
Overcoming the world by faith, may V.
be a 5^h Sign or Evidence of Regeneration. Whatsoever is borne of God
overcomes the world; and, This the victory that overcomes the world, even our
faith. Who is he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is
the Son of God? 1 John 5. 4, 5. Here we have Two adversaries, The victory, The
means of victory. 1. Two adversaries; the Regenerate, them that are borne of
God, ^n one part, who are chiefly Defensive, as the whole armor of God is
chiefly Defensive, Ephesians. 6. 14, to 19. And the world, on the other part, which
is principally Offensive, Joh. 15. 18, 19, 20 And what is this world? 1 Partly
the men of the world, who have their portion in this present life, Psalm. 17.
14. These lie in wickedness, 1 John 5. 19. these hate the Saints, because they
are not of the world, but chosen out of the world by Christ, Joh. 19. 19.
Understand then wicked worldlings, with all their persecutions of the
righteous. 2 Partly (...) worlds lusts, the lust of the flesh, the lust (...)
the eyes, and the pride of life, 1 John 2. 16. Johan. calvini in loc. and Hier.
Zanch. in loc.
The lust of the flesh, i. e. not only carnal corruptions, but all the
pleasures, delights, and c^ntentments that the flesh or body desires The lust
of the eyes, i. e. not only libidinous lustful looks, but also all that vanity
of the eye about the vain pomp, beauty, honors, glory, riches, and glittering
splend or of the world. And pride of life, i. e. All that ambition,
ostentation, bragging, self-admiring, contempt of others, ca^nal confidence,
arising from confluence of worldly enjoyments. These now are the two
adversaries, viz. the Regenerate, and the World, the world with all its wicked
and their oppositions, with all its lusts and their ensnaring insinuations. 2.
The victory not on the worlds side, but on the Regenerates side. Whatsoever is
born of God, overc^meth the world. 3. The means of this victory, Faith in
Christ the Son of God.

All this is wonderful in our eyes. (1.) What inequality in the Adversaries?
The whole world with all its vassals, with all its furies and persecutions,
with all its lusts, with all its snares of honors, riches, pleasures, etc. and
all this against the Regenerate. Alas, how few, how contemptible, how feeble
are they I A little flock, Luke 12. 32. Worm Jacob, Isa. 41. 14. (2.) What
imbecility of the means of the Saints safety against the world; Faith? Faith,
a self-emptying grace, a poor beggarly hand, only rich or strong in receiving
from another, and perhaps a weak palsy trembling hand. But the battle is not
to the strong. Remember David and Goliath; how weak and naked David, how strong,
how harnessed was Goliath? 3 What succesfull prevalencie, notwithstanding, of
the Regenerate against the world? Not only their deliverance from, but defense
against the world; Not only defense against, but victory over the world: Not
only victory, but universal victory: Whatsoever is born of God evercometh the
world. Happy Saints! puissant Faith! triumphant Victory! Do thou overcome the
world by faith in Christ? then thou, doubtless, art born of God.

Case. But how may I know whether I overcome the world by faith or no?

Resol. Hereby thou may discover whether thou conquerest the world by faith,
or no: viz. 1. Have thou true faith in Christ Jesus? 2. Actest thou this faith
in Christ victoriously against the world?

Have thou true faith in Christ? Victory I.
over the world is an act of faith in Christ: Faith cannot thus act in thee,
till first faith be in thee: thou must first have the faith in Christ, before
thou can use it. Make it clear therefore in the first place, whether thou
have the habit of true faith in Jesus Christ the Son of God. How shall I know
that? Answ. Look back to those evidences of true faith in Christ, chap. 2.
Evid. 2. p. 23, to 28.

Actest thou this true faith now victoriously II.
against the world? Every one that is borne of God, has so much skill and
dexterity in the wielding of Faith, as in some measure more or less to
overcome the world. All true Believers are conquerours, though not equal
conquerours of the world. Now they act their faith against the world
victoriously, in two respects especially, viz. 1. Against the smiles of the
world. 2. Against the frowns of the world. The worlds Mundus quippe iste
periculosior est blandus quam molestus, and magis cavend^s cum, se
illici^diligit, quam came admonet cogitque contemni. Aug. Anasta^. epist. 144.
frowns are dangerous; but the worlds smiles are double dangerous: In those,
the world professes it self an enemy; in these, pretends it self to be a
friend: By those, we are alarmed to the battle; by these, we are enchanted into
security, that we may be surprised. To conquer the worlds frowns, is a mighty
victory; but to conquer its smiles, is a double victory. True faith acts and
prevails victoriously against both.

1. True faith acts vigorously and victoriously against the smiles of the
world. The world fights against us with its smiles, fawnings, flatterings, etc.
of temporal prosperity. Syren-like it sings us, and sinks us: Iudas-like it
kisses us, and betrays us: Ioab-like it kisses us, and smites us under the
fifth rib. The honors, high rooms, pomp, splendour, wealth, pleasures,
delights, and all the glory of this world, are but sweet poisons that delight
us and destroy us, at least endanger us. Remember Lots wise, Luke 17. 32. The
young man, Mat. 19. 16, to 23. Demas, 2 Timothy 4. 10. Judas, Mat. 26. 14, 15, 19.
yea, Solomon himself had almost surfeited of these sweet baits, and like the
Be was almost drowned in his own honey.

Now faith victoriously acts against and prevails over all these subtle
smiles, enchantments, and insinuations of the world, diverse ways.

1. By valuing all the prosperity, pomp and splendour of the world, meanly and
abjectly in comparison of Christ, and of spirituals. The world prevails upon us
when we set too high an estimate or account of sublunaries: we prevail over the
world, when we have mean, low, debasing thoughts of it, (as it indeed
deserves.) Thus by faith Paul conquered the world, counting not only his
Pharisaical perfections and accomplishments, but absolutely all things, [viz.
all carnal and worldly excellencies whatsoever] (...), i. e. Loss and dung for
the winning of Jesus Christ, Phil. 3. 8. Thus Moses, though a great Courtier in
Pharaobs house, yea, the reputed son of Pharaobs daughter, (a great worldly
honor) by faith overcame the world; For, By faith Moses, when he was come to
years refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter; choosing rather to
suffer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleasures of sin
for a season: esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches then the
treasures in Egypt, Heb. 11. 24, 25, 26. What? Refuse to be called the son of a
Princess? Prefer the Saints affliction before Sins pleasures? and esteem
Christ's reproaches, riches; great riches; yea, greater riches then Egypts
treasures? How would he have valued Christ's renown, Christ's righteousuesse,
Christ's graces, Christ's comforts, Christ's glory; that can thus esteem Christ's
reproaches? Here was a Champion indeed, that could thus trample the worlds
honors, riches, pleasures, all under his feet. When will the Courtiers of this
world imitate Moses? Excellently said Galeacius Hist. of Galeacius.
the Noble Marquess of Vico, being tempted with gold to forsake Christ, and
return to Popery: Their money perish with them, that think all the gold in the
world worth one days society with Jesus Christ.

2. By holding, possessing and using the world, and the things of the world,
self denyingly. Thus Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, by faith overcame the world,
whilst they so journed in the land of Promise as in a strange country,
dwelling in tabernacles. Heb. ^1. 9. They by faith dwelt in their own land, (it
was their own by promise as if it had been a strangers land. Faith weans and
loosens the heart from the world; Makes them that have W^ves, be as though they
had none, (as the Apostles exhorts,) Them that rejoice, as though they rejoiced
not; and them that buy, as though they possessed not; and them that use this
world, as not abusing it, 1 Cor. 7. 29, 30, 31. And this was that gracious
disposition of Paul, whereby he conquered the world, viz. by Christ crucified,
The world was crucified to him, and he crucified to the world, Gal. 6. 14. i.
e. Paul and the world had no more pleasure, comfort, contentment or
satisfaction in one another, then two crucified persons can have in one
another. When a man is crucified and dead, all his affections to the world, or
things of the world are dead with him; all the delights, treasures,
advancements of the world, Eum sibi crucifixum dicit Paulus: quo sensu alibi
testatur, omnia se reputasse pro stercoribus. Crucifixio enim mundi est
contemptus and abjectio. Addit vicissim se mando crucifixum, quo intelligit
sibi susque deque esse, quod nihil fiat, firque tanquam in nihilum redactus:
quia nihil ad mortuum pertnea^. Vel certe se mortificatione veteris hominis
renunciasse mundo. I. Calvin. in Ep. ad Gal. 6. 14.
are dead to him, He is not moved or troubled who have them, etc. This was
Paul's self-denying victory over the world.

3. By parting with any, even the dearest worldly treasures or comforts readily
for God, and at his command or appointment. Then a man overcomes the world,
when he can at Gods pleasure lay it aside, actually shake it off, and that
without pain or difficulty; that is a sign he is not enthralled to the world,
does not over-prizeit, over-love it; such a man has the world, not for his
Master, but his servant. Thus Abraham by faith overcame the world, in parting
with his native Country, (sweet to all) and that cheerfully; By faith Abraham
when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an
inheritance, obeyed; and he went out, not knowing whither he went, Heb. 11. 8.
A great victory, but behold a greater. Abraham readily can sacrifice his Isaac,
his chief delight in this world. By faith Abraham when he was tried, offered up
Isaac: and he that had received the promises, offered up his only begotten son.
Of whom it was said, that in Isaac shall thy seed be called, etc. Heb. 11. 17.
Behold and consider this victorious act of Faith. In this Text are these seven
amplifications. (1.) His Isaac, i. e. in Hebrew, his laughter; his joy, his
delight. (2.) His Son, not his Sheep, or Oxen, or Servant, but his Son. (3.)
His begotten Son, not an adopted Son. (4.) His only begotten Son; nor one Son
among many, but his only Son by Sarah the Freewoman, by whom he had no more.
(5.) This the Son of the Promise, in whom his seed should be called, and all
the Nations of the earth be blessed. (6.) This Son sacrificed, (intentionally,
though not actually) as a Burnt-Offering. (7.) And all this by Abraham his own
Father. O glorious Faith that can make such a man, as Abraham, so part with, as
to sacrifice; such a treasure, as Isaac! Can thou thus part with, thus
conquer the world, as Abraham? Excellently to this purpose said George
Carpenter of Emering, Martyr in Bavaria, Acts and Monu. vol. 2. p. 113. Edit.
Cond. 1641.
My wife and my children are so dearly beloved unto me, that they cannot be
bought from me for all the riches and possessions of the Duke of Bavaria: but
for the love of my Lord God I will willingly forsake them.

4. Finally, By resting on God alone, at the only Rock and foundation of our
true joy and comfort, both while the world is with us, and when the world shall
leave us. (1.) While the world is with us, we conquer it by Faith, if we fetch
our comforts from an higher and richer spring then the world, viz. God. David
in midst of his Royal enjoyments said, Whom have I in heaven but thee, and in
earth there is none that I desire with thee; mine heart and my strength fails,
but thou art the strength of my heart, and portion for ever, Psalm. 73. 25. And
elsewhere, Many say, Who will show us good? But, Lord, lift thou up the light
of thy countenance upon us. Thou have put more gladness in mine heart, then in
the time when their Corn and New-wine increased, Ps. 4. 6, 7. (2.) When the
world shall leave us, yet our joy and comforts leave us not, because our God
forsakes us not. Thus we overcome the world, when though the world be down, our
hearts are up. As Habbakuk, Although the Fig Tree shall not blossom, neither
fruit be in the Vines; the labor of the Olive shall fail, and the Fields
shall yield no meat; The flock shall be cut off from the Fold, and there shall
be no herd in the Stalls: Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God
of my salvation, Hab. 3. 17, 18.

Thus Faith overcomes the worlds smiling, and fawning.

II. True faith vigorously and victoriously acts against the frowns of the
world. The world frowns against the Regenerate in all its common tribulations,
or special persecutions, either by hating, reproaching, spoiling, imprisoning,
tormenting, or murdering them. Thus it frowned upon righteous Abel, Genesis 4 8,
9, 10. Upon Isaac, Gal. 4. 29 Upon Israel, Exodus 1. etc. 2. Upon Joseph, Psalm.
105. 17, 18. Upon Job, Job 1. Upon David, Psalm. 73. 14. Upon all the Prophets,
Acts 7. 52. Upon all the Apostles, 1 Cor 4. 9. Upon all that will live godly in
Christ Jesus, 2 Timothy 3. 12. Yea, upon Jesus Unicum habuit filium sine peccato,
nullum sine flagello.
Christ himself, Isa. 53. Phil. 2. 7, 8. Heb 12. 2, 3. Yet Regenerate persons
by Faith in Christ, overcome the world in all its frowns and storm,; and this
many ways, viz.

1. By encouraging them against base carnal fears. Fears oft-times more annoy
the Saints, then feelings of distresses. Faith steels the gracious heart
against these servile fears: and makes it exceeding magnanimous. As in Moses
Parents; By faith Moses when he was borne, was hid three months of his
Parents, because they saw he was a proper child, and they not afraid of the
Kings commandment, Heb. 11. 23. In Moses himself; By faith he (viz. Moses,)
forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the King, far he endured as seeing him
which is invisible, Heb 11. 27. As also in those valiant Champions; Who through
faith, subdued Kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises, stopped
the mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the
sword, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned to
flight the armies of the Aliens, Heb. 11. 33, 34. We are not only (said Hosts
veritatis jam non tantum non perhorrescimus, sed provo^amus; and inimicos Dei
jam hocipso quod non cessimus, vicimus. Cypria. Epist. 26. Edit. Goulart. 1593.
Cyprian) not afraid of the enemies of the truth, but we provoke them.

2. By enabling to undergo varieties of cruel trials and torments, which
without faith would be to flesh and blood most terrible and intolerable. And
others had trials of cruel mockings and scourgings; yea, moreover of bonds and
imprisonments: they were stoned, they were sawen asunder, were tempted, were
slain with the sword; they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins, being
destitute, afflicted, tormented, of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered
in deserts, and in mountains, and in dens, and caves of the earth; these all
having obtained a good report through faith, Heb. 11. 36, to 40.

Vidit admirans praesentium multitudo coeleste certamen, certamen Dei,
spiritale certamen, praelium Christi; stetisse servosejus voce libera^, mente
incorrupta, virtute divina; telis quidem secularibus nudos, sed armis fidei
tredentes armatos. Steterunt torti torquentibus fortiores, and pulsantes ac
laniantes ungulas pulsata ac laniata membra vice^nt; Inexpugnabilem fidem
superare non potuit saeviens diu plaga repetita, quamvis rupta compage viscerum
torquerentur in servis Dei jam non membra sed vulnera. Fluebat sanguis, qui
incendium persecutionis extingueret, qui flammas and ignes gehennae glorioso
cruore sopiret. Cyprian. ad martyrs, etc. de Magpalio. Ep. 9. edit. Goulart.
1593.
Cyprian has strange expressions of the Martyrs victorious faith in his
days. The multitude present beheld with admiratinn the heavenly combat, the
combat of God, the spiritual conflict, the war of Christ; his servants
standing with a free voice, incorrupt mind, Divine strength, armed not with
secular weapons, but with weapons of faith: The tormonted stood, stronger then
the tormentors: the beaten and but chered members overcame the hands that did
beat and butcher them. Cruel stripes often repeated, long continued, could not
overcome their impregnable Faith; no, not though their bowels were dug out,
and not so much the members as the wounds of the servants of God were
tormented. Their blood gushed out, which even quenched the burning of
persecution, yea, extinguished the flames and fire of hell with a glorious
stream.

3. By extenuating and asswaging the extremity James Bainham Martyr, as he was
at the stake in the midst of the flaming fire, which had now half consumed his
arms and legs: he spoke these words: O ye Papists, behold, ye look for
miracles, and here now ye may see a miracle; for in this fire I feel no more
painthen if I were in a bed of down: but it is to me as a bed of roses. Acts
and Mon. vol. 2. p. 301. Land. 1641.
of afflictions and persecutions. Faith so sustaines and refreshes the inwards
of the soul under distresses, that they are rather seeming, then real
distresses; shadows, rather then substances; As it were poverty, As it were
imprisonment, etc. rather then poverty; imprisonment indeed. As in the
Apostles; We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not
destroyed, 2 Cor. 4. 8, 9. And elsewhere more emphatically: As unknown, and yet
well known; as dying, and behold we live; as chastened, and not killed; as
sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having
nothing, and yet possessing all things, 2 Cor. 6. 9, 10. Whereas contrariwise
through unbelief men are, as rich, yet really poor; as in liberty, and yet in
greatest bondage; as rejoicing, and yet in midst of mirth the heart is heavy,
etc. Unbelief turns the rod into a serpent; Faith turns the serpent into a rod.

4. By persuading the hearts of the faithful that it is their great privilege,
honor and happiness to suffer for Christ and Righteousness sake; according
to those intimations of Scripture: To you it is given in the behalf of Christ,
not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake, Phill. 1. 29.
Blessed are they that are persecuted for righteousness sake, etc. Mat. 5. 10,
11, 12. Rejoice, in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings: If you
be reproached for the Name of Christ, happy are you, etc. 1 Pet. 4. 13, 14.
Upon this consideration when the Apostles were beaten by the Council for
preaching Christ, They departed from the presence of the Council, rejoicing
that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his Name. Acts 5. 40, 41. And
what, but Faith, can ^d privilege, happiness, and matter of joy, in
sufferings for Christ? How happy did Cyprian judge their Church, O beatam
ecclesiam nostram, qua sic honor divinae dignationisilluminat, quam temporibus
nostris gloriosus martyrum sanguis illustrat! Erat ante in operibus fratrum
candida; nunc facta est in martyrum cruore purpurea. FLOR^VS EIVS NEC LILIA NEC
ROSAE DESVNT. Certent nunc singuli ad utriusque honoris amplissimam dignitatem,
ut accipiant coronas vel de opere candidas, vel de passione purpureas. Cyprian,
ad martyrs, etc. epist. 9. edit. Goulart. An. 1593.
That it was made illustrious in his time with the glorious blood of Martyrs!
it was (says he) formerly white with the Brethrens works, but now its purple
with the Martyrs blood. Among its flowers are wanting neither Lilies nor Roses:
Let all now strive for the ample dignity of this double honor, that they may
receive either white crowns for well-doing, or purple crowns for
well-suffering.

5. By suggesting to the Soul the spiritual benefit of distresses. Faith makes
the heart not only overcome them, but even glory in them: Being justified by
faith, -- we glory in tribulations; knowing that tribulation works patience,
and patience experience, and experience hope; and hope makes not ashamed, etc.
Romans 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man
perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day: For our light affliction
which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal
weight of glory, 2 Cor. 4. 16, 17. Faith says, Let me be reproached, poor,
imprisoned, or any way afflicted; so I may be weaned from the world, purged
from sin, increased in grace, or any way spiritually advantaged. And this is
very victorious. (...) Ignat. Ep. ad Ronan. p. 84, 85. Edit. Oxon. 1644.
Ignatius said, I am Gods wheat; let me be ground by the teeth of wild beasts,
that I may be found the pure bread of God.

6. By acting love invincibly. Faith acts or works by love, Gal. 5. 6. And love
truly and lively acted toward Christ by faith, proves an army invincible,
flame unquenchable. You may kill the lover of Christ, but cannot kill the love
of Christ. Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm, (says
the Church to Christ,) For love is strong as death, jealousy cruel as the
grave; the coals thereof, coals of fire, a most vehement flame. Many waters
cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it, Cant. 8. 6, 7. No waters
of affliction, no floods of persecution can drown it; like oil it swims above
the top of deepest waters. Such love not their lives unto the death, Rev. 12.
11. Here Is the victory of the Saints.

7. By eying the invisible and invincible God. The worlds punishment (said Nec
plus ad dejiciendum potest terrena poena, quam ad erigendum tutela divina,
Cypri. an, epist. 9. edit. Goulart. 1593.
Cyprian) cannot more cast down, then Gods protection lift up. Faith meets with
many difficulties and rubs in the way to heaven: but fixing upon the Omnipotent
God, and casting the soul in greatest straits and plunges with a sweet
recumbency upon the power of God, overcomes them, and triumphs over them all.
Thus Moses by faith overcame the wrath of Pharaoh, for he endured as seeing him
who is invisible, Heb. 11. 27. Thus the three renowned Jews by faith overcame
the fury, threats and fiery furnace of King Nebuchadnezzar, heated seven times
hotter then usual. How victoriously do they express themselves! O
Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. If it be so,
our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and
he will deliver us out of thy hand, O King: But if not, be it known unto thee,
O King, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden Image which
thou have set up, Dan. 3. 16, 17, 18

8. By improving Christ's strength and assistance. All Sampsons strength lay in
his head: so all a Christians strength is in his Head Christ. Christ is so
potent and victorious, that he has already overcome the world, John 16. ult.
Qui pro nobis semel mortem vicit, semper vincit in nobis. Cyprian. Epist. 9.
edit. Goulart. 1593.
He has overcome the world in his own person, that he might overcome it in his
members. Now faith makes out to Christ, engages his strength; as the Vine makes
it self strong by embracing the Elm, the Ivy by clasping the Oak Christ's
strength being engaged, what cannot a Christian do or endure? He can in every
state be content. Contentment is a mighty victory over the world; let the world
do its worst, nothing can come amiss to a contented man. I know both how to be
abased, and I know how to abound: every where, and in all things I am
instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and suffer need, I
can do all things through Christ which strengthens me, Phil. 4. 11, 12, 13.
And elsewhere Paul hangs out the flag of defiance against all the terrors of
the world. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or
distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? (As
it is written, For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as
sheep to the slaughter.) Now in all these things we are more then conquerours
through him that loved us, Romans 8. 35, 36, 37. When in Christ's might,
Christians go out against the world, they go but to encounter with a conquered
adversary; they go not so much to Fight, as to Triumph and take the spoil.

9. Finally, Faith in the Regenerate wonderfully conquers the frowns of the
world, by fixing a steady eye upon that eternal joy set before them, upon that
great recompense of reward: Reckoning that the afflictions of this present time
are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,
Romans 8. 18. The heaviest affliction is but light, the longest affliction here
is but for a moment; and what is that to glory, to the weight of glory, to the
eternal weight of glory, to the far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory? 2 Cor. 4. 17.

Faith therefore having respect to the recompense of reward, behaves it self
exceeding victoriously against all the tribulations of the world. For,

1. Hence, Faith under deepest sorrows keeps up the heart and spirits of Gods
children from fainting, 2 Cor. 4. 16, 17, 18.

2. Hence, Faith enables to undergo, not ordinary troubles, but extraordinary
tortures, and yet not to accept deliverance, Heb. 11. 35.

3. Hence, Faith instructs them to judge Christ's reproaches greater riches then
any earthly treasures: And the afflictions of Christians far sweeter then the
pleasures of sin, which can but be for a season, Heb. 11. 26. Whereupon notably
Ignatius, Ignat. Epist. ad Roman. p. 86, 87. Edit. Oxon. An. 1644. and Appendix
Ignatian. p. 24. Land. 1647.
The confines of the world and kingdoms of the earth delight not me at all. It
is better for me to die for Jesus Christ, then to reign over the ends of the
earth. -- For Jesus is the life of Believers. Be not unwilling to have me die.
Its a death to live without Christ, etc. Upon like ground blessed Cyprian
writing to certain valiant and faithful witnesses of Christ, that had endured
great variety of sufferings, thus comforts them against their bonds, fetters,
etc. Ornamenta sunt ista, non vincula; nec Christianorum pedes ad infamiam
copulant, sed clarificant ad coronam. O pedes foeliciter vincti, qui non a
fabro, sed a Domino resolvuntur! O pedes feliciter vi^cti, qui itinere salutari
ad Paradisum diriguntur! Opedes in seculo ad praesens ligati, ut sint semper
apud Dominum liberi! Omnis ista deformit^s detestabllis and tetra Gentilibus,
quali splendore pensabitur! Secularis haec and brevis poena, quam clari and
aeterni honoris mercede mutabitur! Cypri^ (...) ad Nenasianum, etc. epist. 77.
edit. Goulartian. An. 1593.
These are not Bonds, but Ornaments: they tie not Christians feet to infamy,
but fit them for the Crown. O feet happily bound, which not the Smith, but the
Lord shall unbinde! Oh feel happily bound, which are directed by a saving
journey to Paradise! Oh feet bound for present in this world, that they may be
at liberty with the Lord for evermore! -- All this deformity ugly and
detestable to the Gentiles. with what splendor shall it be recompensed! This
short and secular pain, how shall it be changed for the reward of bright
eternal honor!

4. Hence Faith prevails with them to rejoice in their sufferings, and take
with joy the spoiling of their goods, knowing in themselves that they have in
heaven a better and more enduring substance, Heb. 10. ^4. Hence that cruel
Bishop Bonner, (observing how comfortably the Martyrs suffered) Acts and
Monumen. Vol. 3. page 881. Edit. Land. An. 1641.
oft-times speaking to John Wills, he would say, they call me bloody Bonner. A
vengeance on you all: I would fain be rid of you, But you have a delight in
burning. But if I might have my will, I would sew your mouths, and put you in
sacks, and drown you.

5. Hence, in a word, Faith so elevates their spirits above their troubles,
That having hope of the glory of God, they even glory in Tribulation, Romans 5.
2, 3. Hence Alice Driver, Martyr, having at the Stake the Ironchaine put about
her neck, said, Acts and Mon. Vol. 3. p. 888. Land. 1641.
O Here Is a goodly neckerchief, blessed be God for it. Hence Acts and. Mon.
vol. 3. page 177. Edit. Land. 1641.
Dr. Tailor Martyr, drawing toward the place of execution, leapt as men do in
dancing, whereupon being asked by the Sheriff, how he did now, He answered,
Well, God be praised, good Mr. Sheriff. Never better; for now I know I am
almost at home. I lack not past two Styles to go over, and I am even at my
Fathers house. Hence Cicely Ormes Martyr, when she was brought to the Stake,
laid her hand on it, and said Act and Mon. Vol. 3. p. 853. Edit. Land. 1641.
Welc^me the cross of Christ. -- Then after she had touched it with her hand,
she came and kissed it, and said, Welcome the sweet cross of Christ; and when
the fire was kindled to her, she said, My soul does magnify the Lord, and my
Spirit rejoices in God my Savior. Hence Mr. John Bradford at the Stake Acts
and Mon. Vol. 3. p. 307. Lon. 1641.
took up a Faggot and kissed it, and turned his head to the young man that
suffered with him, said, Be of good comfort, brother, for we shall have a merry
Supper with the Lord this night. And embracing the Reeds said, Strait is the
way, and narrow is the gate that leads to eternal Salvation, and few there
be that find it. Hence, also, That Blessed Ignatius for gaining Christ in
glory, which is the highest reward, thus expresses himself to the Romans,
Ignat. in Epist. ad Roman. p. 86. Edit. Oxon. An^ 1644. and Appendix Ignatian.
24. Edit. Londin. 1647.
(...), etc.] O that I were with the wild beasts prepared for me; which I wish
may be a compendium to me. And I would allure them speedily to eat me up, (and
not as with others be terrifyed, so as not to touch them) and if they would
not, I would provoke them. Pardon me, I know what is expedient for me, I now
begin to be a Disciple. I am solicitous for neither visibles nor invisibles so
I may obtain Jesus Christ. Let fire, Cross, and the concourse of wild beasts,
the cutting, separating and breaking of my bones, the dissipation of my
members, the destruction of my whole body, and the torments of the Devil come
upon me, only that I may obtain Jesus Christ.

Thus they that are borne of God, overcome the world, Fawning and Frowning, and
their victory is Faith in Jesus Christ. Christian, can thou thus conquer the
world? can thou deny the world? Though perhaps thou can not dispute for
Christ, yet can thou dye for Christ?

VI.
Doing, or practicing of Righteousness, may be a sixth Evidence of
Regeneration. If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that does
righteousness is borne of him, 1 John 2. 29. And in another chapter; In this
the children of God are manifest, and the children of the Devil: whosoever does
not righteousness is not of God, 1 John 3. 10. In these two places consider,
1. The Evidence or Sign of Regeneration laid down; Posively, He that does
righteousness is borne of God, Negatively, He that does not righteousness is
not of God. 2. The amplification of this Evidence: 1. By the universality of
it: Every one that does righteousness, -- Whosoever does not righteousness.
2. By the perspicuity of it: In this the children of God are manifest, ane the
children of the Devil. 3. By the ground of it: God regenerating is Righteous;
therefore they that are regenerated of God must needs be righteous, the child
like the father: New-created according to his image in righteousness, etc.
Ephesians. 4. 24. Now in this 1 Ioh. 3. 10* compared with v. 9. Righteousness (as
Facere justitia^, and facere; peccatum, sut hic inter se opposita. Itaque
facere justitiam nihil aliud est quam ex animo Deum timere, and ambulare in
ejus praeceptis, quantum fert humana fragilitas, etc. Calvin, comment in 1. ep.
Joan. 3. 10.
Calvin well observes) is opposed to sin; and doing or practicing of
righteousness, to committing of sin. And therefore in this place, to do
righteousness is nothing else but from the heart to fear God, and (so far as
humane frailty will permit) to walk in his precepts, not in a Legal exactness,
which man cannot reach unto; but in an Evangelical uprightness, which God will
accept.

So that every one that leads a truly godly and righteous life, is borne of
God. He that lives contrary, is the child of the Devil. For, 1. Gods children
are predestinate to be conform to the image of Christ, Romans 8. 29, 30. being
elect through sanctification of the Spirit to obedience, 1 Pet. 1, 2. 2. Gods
children are redeemed from their vain conversation by the precious blood of
Christ, that they might glory fie God both in their body and spirit, which are
Gods, 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19. 1 Cor. 6. 19, 20. Luke 1. 74, 75. 3. They are called
unto holiness, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 7. 2 Timothy 1. 9. And created in Christ Jesus unto
good works, Ephesians. 2. 10. 4. Such as are men's persons, good or bad, such will be
their works and conversations: Like tree, like fruit. Carnal men will walk
carnally; Spiritual, spiritually, Mat. 7. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. and. 12. 33, 34,
35. Romans 8. 1, 5. 5. All pretenses of Faith, without good works, are vain; and
such faith, dead, Jam. 2. 20, 26. All such men's religion is but abominable
hypocrisy, Tit. 1. 16.

But how may I know that I truly practice Righteousness, as becomes one that
is borne of God?

Answ. They act or practice Righteousness truly who walk in paths of piety and
righteousness, for (1.) Matter, (2.) Ground, (3.) Form, and, (4.) End, as
Scripture requires of them.

I. Who act or practice things for substance and matter righteous. Possibly the
matter may be sometimes good, when the manner and circumstances are naught: but
nothing can be good, if the matter be naught. Matters practiced, are in their
own nature either 1. Good, as things prescribed, Exodus 20. 2. Evil, as things
prohibited, Exodus 20. 3. Indifferent, as things left at liberty, Romans 14. 2, 3.
For matter, they practice Righteousness, who practice things Good, or
Indifferent: But they practice unrighteousness, who practice things Evil. Ye
are of your father the Devil, and the works of your father you will do, Joh.
8. 44.

II. Who do that which is materially righteous from a right Ground and
Principle. Such as are men's Principles within, such are their Practices
without, Mat. 12. 33, 34. Iehu did for matter that which God required, but not
from a right ground, 2 King. 10. 30, 31. The right ground and principle from
which all holy and righteous acts should flow, is threefold, viz. 1. A pure
heart. 2. A good Conscience. And 3. Faith unfeigned, 1 Timothy 1. 5.

1. A pure heart, viz. not absolutely and completely purified from all sin,
which in this life is impossible, 1 Ioh. 1. 8. Thus, Who can say he has made
his heart clean? Prove. 20. 9. But comparatively and respectively purified. So
purified, as no carnal man's heart in the world is purified. 1. Purified by the
blood of Christ sprinkled upon the heart by way of Justification, Zech. 13. 1.
Psalm. 51. 7. Act. 15. 9. 2. Purified by the Spirit of Christ; his gracious
habits, as principles of purity, being infused. This is by way of
Sanctification, 1 Cor. 6. 11. So faith is a principle of purity, Act. 15. 9. He
that has such a pure heart, mingles not with sin, but works it out and
seperates from it, as honey works out the wax, wine the lees, metal in the
furnace the dross. Such regard not iniquity in their heart, Psalm. 66. 18.
Here Is a right ground of righteous practices. Have thou such a pure heart?

2. A good Conscience, viz. not metaphysically or naturally good; so every man's
Conscience is good: But spiritually and supernaturally good. Conscience is
supernaturally ^ood, 1. When it is by Christ's blood purged from dead works to
serve the living God, Heb. 9. ^4. 2. When it is habitually exercised to
inoffensivenesse to God and man, Act. 24. 16. compared with, Act 23. 1. 3. When
Conscience endeavors to be completely, universally good: In all good
conscience, Act. 23. 1. 4. When conscience approves it self good even in the
sight of God, Act 23. 1. 1 Pet. 3 21. 5. When upon all this, Conscience gives a
comfortable testimony of the Hearts simplicity and godly sincerity, able to
support under greatest distresses and afflictions, 2 Cor. 1. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
Actest thou now from such a good Conscience?

3. Faith unfeigned, without hypocrisy. Without faith there is no pleasing of
God, Heb. 11. 6. Faith washes all our duties and acts of obedience in the blood
of the Lamb, and so ^enders them acceptable to God, (...) Pet. 2. 5. Faith is
then unfeigned: 1. When it has the true nature of Faith in it, viz. Assenting
to Gods truths revealed, 1 Ioh. 5. 10, 11 and Applying particularly those
Truths assented to, Ioh 1. 11, 12 Gal. 2. 20. (...). When it produces effects
of a living Faith, viz. Good works; without which fruits, whatsoever faith is
pretended, it is but feigned faith, a dead faith, Jam. 2. 20, 26. Have thou
such a Faith whence all thy righteous actions spring?

III. Who for form and manner do righteousness in such sort as God requires:
not only doing Bona, good things; but doing them Been, well. God loves (as some
note) to be served with Adverbs rather then with Nouns or Verbs. Now, Religious
and righteous acts are then well performed, when they are done.

1. Spiritually and heartily, with heart and spirit, not with body only. This
God requires, Prove. 23. 26. Ioh. 4. 24. 1 Cor. 6. 20. This the godly perform,
Romans 1. 9. Psalm. 25. 1. Phil. 3. 20. The carnal, mere corporal service God
condemns, Ezekiel. 33. 31, 32. Mat. 15. 7, 8.

2. Sincerely and uprightly, as in the sight of God, and approving our hearts
to him, Genesis 17. 1. as David, Psalm. 18. 22. and 66. 18. Paul, 2 Cor. 2. ult.
Peter, Joh. 21. 15, 16, 17.

3. Obedientially, because God commands the duty, therefore in conscience and
love to the command obedience is performed: as in Noah, Heb. 11. 7. Abraham,
Heb. 11. 8, 17, etc. David, Psa. 40 8. and. 119. 143. Paul, Romans 7. 22.

4. Universally, fully, without reservations and exceptions. Hypocrites may do
many things, as Iehu, 2 King. 10. 30, 31. Herod, Mar. 6. 20. But the gracious
spirit has respect to all things required; as in David, Ps. 119 6. Caleb, Number.
14. 24. Zechary and Elizabeth, Luke 1. 6.

5. Constantly. Perseverance in well-doing crowns well-doing: true zeal like
the fire in the sanctuary never goes out. See Psalm. 1. 2, 3. Psalm. 92. 13, 14.
and 119, 20. Hypocrisy lasts not; like paint or varnish it will wash off, Job.
27. 10 Mat. 13. 20, 21. 1 John 2. 19.

Do thou practice Righteousness now, Spiritually, Sincerely, Obedientially,
Universally, Constantly?

IV. Finally, Who practice Righteousness for right ends, viz. Gods glory
primarily, 1 Cor, 10. 31. Their own and others spiritual or eternal good
secondarily, Mat. 5. 16. 1 Pet. 4. 2, 3, 4. Romans 2. 7. Low base ends spoil the
highest undertakings, as in Iehu 2 Kings 10. Pharisees, Mat. 6. 2, 5, 16. K.
Saul, 1 Samuel 15. 30.

VII.
True love of the Brethren may be a 7th. Sign or Evidence of our Regeneration.
In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the Devil:
whosoever does not righteousuesse is not of God, neither he that loves not his
Brother, 1 John 3. 7. Again he says; Beloved, let us love one another, for
love is of God; and every one that loves is born of God, 1 John 4. 7. And
further he adds; We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we
love the Brethren: He that loves not his Brother abides in death, 1 John 3.
14.

This Evieence of Brotherly love will be more judiciously and comfortably
improved, if we consider, 1. The general clearness of it. 2. What Brethren
are here intended. 3. Some under-notes or discoveries of this Brotherly love.

I. The general clearness of this Evidence. Experience tells us, that usually
the weakest and most timorous Christians, who can find small or no comfort in
other Evidences of their gracious state, yet can discern some glimmerings here
in their love of the brethren: And this one discovery has supported many;
because they evidently and experimentally feel in their own hearts that they
cordially love the Brethren. He that loves his brother (said Qui diligit
fratrem magis novit dilectionem qua diligit, qua^ fratre^ quem diligit. Aug. de
Trinitat. l. 8, c. 8.
Augustine) better knows his love wherewith he loves, then his brother whom he
loves.

II. What [Brethren] are here intended? Answ. There are (1.) Brethren by
Nation, Act. 7. 23, 25. Romans 9. 3. (2.) Brethren by nature, descended of the
same natural parents or parent, Mat. 1. 2. (3.) Brethren by office, 2 Pet. 3.
15. 2 Cor. 1. 1. Col. 1. 1. Philem. 1. (4.) Brethren by grace and supernatural
Regeneration, Philem. 16. Here understand Brethren in the last sense, for
Brethren by grace; 1. Partly, inasmuch as the same Apostle speaking of this
love of these hrethren elsewhere, calls them the children of God, 1 John 5. 2.
And, Begotten of him, 1 John 5. 1. 2. Partly, because love to any other
Brethren by Nation, Nature, Office, etc. (which are relations common to persons
unregenerate with the Regenerate) may be incident to carnal persons and
hypocrites, and so can be no distinctive character betwixt them that are borne
of God, and them that are not.

III. Some under-notes or Discoveries of true brotherly love; or love of the
children of God, begotten of him. We may discover whether we love the Brethren,
Negatively, and Affirmatively; as in the former places the Apostle speaks of it
both ways.

Negatively; We love not the Brethren, the children of God:

1. Whilst we continue the seed of the serpent, and are of the world; for
there is natural enmity betwixt the seed of the serpent and of the woman, Genesis
3. 15. betwixt them that are of the world, and them that are chosen out of the
world, Ioh. 15. 19.

2. Whilst we retain our carnal mind and heart which is enmity against God,
his laws and ways, Romans 8. 7. and cannot choose but from this antipathie hate
righteousness and supernatural goodness in the Brethren, 1 Ioh. 3. 12.

3. Whilst we manifest any fruits of hatred against the Brethren, by
reproaching them, spoiling them in their goods, imprisoning them, tormenting
them, murdering them, or any way persecuting them, Gal. 4. 29. or consenting
thereunto, Act. 8. 1. and 26. 10.

Affirmativel; We truly love the Brethren, the true children of God:

1. When we love them as such: The brethren for their spiritual brotherhood, 1
Pet. (...). 17. The Godly for Godliness sake, for God (...) them: Christians,
for Christianity, for Christ in them: The Saints for their (...), for their
Sanctity of person and Con^rsation. The spiritual children begotten, for their
heavenly Fathers sake begetting them, 1 Ioh. 5. 1, 2. When Grace is the
principal loadstone of our affection; when for this we love them more, then for
Beauty, sweetness of disposition, Birth, Breeding, learning, Wit, Parts,
Gifts, Wealth, Honor, or any carnal, worldly Accomplishment whatsoever, then
we love the Brethren as right.

2. Hence, When we love and delight inthem above all sorts of people on earth,
as the most excellent people. David says, Thou art my Lord: my goodness
extends not to she; but to the Saints that are in the Earth, and to the
Excellent in whom is all my delight, Psalm. 16. 2, 3. Christ himself preferred
them that heard the Word of God and kept it, as such, before his natural
brethren according to the flesh; yea, before his own mother that bare him and
gave him suck, as such. Mat. 12. 47, 48, 49, 50. Mark. 3. 32, 33, 34, 35. Luke
8. 20, 21. and 11. 27, 28. And the Saints have more intimate, endearing,
continuing Relations to one another in Christ, then to all nearest natural
allies whatsoever; and are wont accordingly to esteem them: Paul loved Onesimas
converted, as his Son, Philem. v. 10. as himself, ver. 17. yea, as his own
bowels, ver. 12.

3. Hence; When we love all such as we apprehend to be the children of God. For
he that loves one child of God, as a child of God, Quatenusipsum, includit de
omni.
consequently loves every child of God, whether noble or ignoble, rich or poor,
bond or free, male or female, etc. For the same God, the same Christ, the same
Grace, is as truly amiable in one as in another. See Col. 1. 4. Philem. 5. They
that only can love rich. Saints in gay clothes, with goldrings, etc. but
despise the poor Saints, are partial in their love, and have the faith of God
with respect of persons, Jam. 2. 2, 3, 4. they love not the person for his
graces, but rather graces for the person.

4. Hence; When we love them most that are most gracius, (other things being
alike.) For where Grace allures the affection, the more Grace, the stronger
motive and allurement. Jesus loved all his Disciples, Ioh. 13. 1. but John
eminently gracious he loved peculiarly above all the rest, Ioh 21. 20. yea, as
grace grows in the same person, true love toward him will grow proportionably.

5. When we love the Brethren sincerely, unfeigned^y, really; not only in word
and tongue, but indeed and truth, 1 Pet. 1. 22. 1 Job. 3. 16, 17. being ready
to express all amiable respects, and acts of love toward them, Act. 4. 32.

6. When we peculiarly love their Society; ^ing most intimate, contenting
delight in ^r communion, above all other. Noscitur ex socio, qui non
dignoscitur ex se.
Soci^y is hardly dissembled. The heart loving ^lights must in fellowship with
the compa^on beloved. I am (said David) acom^ion of all them that fear thee,
etc. Psalm. 19. 63. In them is all my delight, Psalm. 16. 3. and 101. 6.
Regenerate persons have no ^ontenting fellowship with the ungodly, Psalm. 1. 1,
2. and 26. 4, 5, and 101. 7. and 119. 115.

7. Finally, we love the brethren aright ^hen we love them constantly. Christ
loves them to the end, Joh. 13. 2. So should they love one another to the end.
The ground of their love still continues, viz. Gods command, Their Spiritual
Relation, Their true Grace: So should their love still continue.

VIII.
Hope and assured apprehension in some measure that we shall be conform to God
and to Christ in his glorious appearing, may be an eighth sign of
Regeneration. Beloved, now are we the Sons of God; but it does not yet appear
what we shall be: But we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him:
for we shall see him as he is, 1 John 3. 2. Here are, 1. The gracious Relation
of the Regenerate unto God for present; Now they are Sons (...) God. 2. The
glorious perfections reserve^ for them for future: For Particular, not ye^
appearing to us exactly, completely; For General; It shall be a blessed
conformity to him, in that full trans-forming Beatifi^ call vision of him at
his appearance, which Vision (as Visuri sumus quandam visionem fratres, quam
nec oculus vidit, nec auris audivit, nec in Cor hominis ascendit. Visionem
praecellentem omnes pulchritudinesterrenas Auri, Argenti, Nemorum atque
Camporum; pulchritudinem maris, and acris, pulchritudinem Solis and Lunae,
pulchritudinem Stellatum, pulchritudinem Angelorum; Omnia superantem, quia
exipsa pulchra sunt omnia. Aug. Expos^n Ep. Joan. Tract. 4. de cap. 11^.
Augustine has noted) excell^ all earthly beauty of Gold, Silver, Woods*
Fields, Sea, Air, Sun, Moon, Stars, or Angels: surpassing all, because
all things have their beauty from it. 3. The precognition, or knowledge which
the Regenerate have of this even in this life. We know -- Knowledge implies
some measure of certainty o^ assurance hereof in Gods children in thi^ life. As
there are degrees of Faith, 2 These. 1. 3. So of assurance; the highest is ful^
assurance, Col. 2. 2. Heb. 6. 11. and 10. 22. All the Regenerate arrive not at
full assurance: who yet attain certainty. All reach the certainty of the
object believed, viz. That the glory promised shall certainly be performed, i^
sure. All reach the certainty or assurance of the Subject believing in some
sort, viz. Some, full assurance: Many, Assurance of sense and Evidence: But All
reach Assurance of adherence whereby they certainly cleave to, and test upon
the promises and the happiness ^romised; this is so of the essence of Faith,
that Faith cannot be without it. Do we thus know, or hope for conformity to God
in glory?

Signs of this knowledge or hope in us of our ^formity to God in glory.

1. Peace with God, and joy in hope of this glory, Romans 5. 1, 2.

2. Conformity to God in grace: purifying themselves, as God is pure, 1 Ioh. 3.
2, 3.

3. A cheareful disposition to part with any earthly enjoyments for Christ, or
to endure any afflictions or persecutions for him, Heb. 10. 34. and 11. 26. and
ver. 35, to 40.

4. Leading on earth an heavenly conversation, Phil. 3. 20. Col. 3. 1, etc.

5. Frequent and fervent desires, breathings, groanings, longings after Christ's
appearing, and full enjoyment of him face to face, 2 Cor. 5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 8.
Cant. 8. 14. Rev. 22. 20.

IX.
In hope of glory purifying our selves IX.
as God is pure; may be a ninth or last Evidence of Regeneration. Now we are
the Sons of God, but it does not -- And every man that has this hope in him,
purifyeth himself, even as he is pure, 1 John 3. 2, 3. So that every child of
God having the hope of glory, and of conformity to God and to Christ therein:
Thereupon from that hope purifieth himself as he is pure. In this Evidence of
Selfe-purifying, Note, 1. The act performed, Purifyeth, [(...)] A metaphor
either from Goldsmiths purifying metals from dross, or from the Ceremonial
purifications in time of the Law: denotes regenerate persons cleansing
themselves more and more from corruption. 2. The object about which this act is
to be exercised, Themselves; viz. not only their outsides, or only their
minds, etc. but theirwhole man, soul and body, and consequently their whole
conversation: They would be clean throughout. 3. The Rule or pattern of this
act, according to which, in some imperfect resemblance, he purifieth himself,
viz. Gods purity, As God is pure. See, 1 Pet. 1, 13, etc. Augustine Debetis
nosse quid est [Sicut] Quia non semper (sicut) ad parilitate^ and aequalitatem
refertur, v. g. Videte quantum sit inter faciem hominis and imaginem despeculo.
Facies in imagine facies in corpore; Imago in imitatione corpus in veritate. Et
quid dicemus? nam sicut hic o^uli, ita and ibi: sicut hic aures, ita and ibi
aures sunt. Dispar est res, sed [sicut] ad si^itudinem dicitur. Habemus ergo
and nos imaginem Dei; sed non illam quam habet Filius aequalis Patri. Tamen and
nos pro modo nostro si non sicut ille essemus; ex nulla part similes
diceremur. Ergo castificat nos sicut ipse castus est. Sed ille castus
aeternitate, nos casti fide. Justi sumu^ sicut and ipse justus est: sed ipse in
ipsa incommutabili perpetuitate, nos justi credendo in quem non vedemus, ut
aliquando vi^mus. August expos. in epist. Joan. Tract. 4. de. cap. 3.
has well observed, that the word [As] here, is not a note of Parility or
equality, but of Resemblance and similitude: of quality, rather then of
equality. As there is a Similitude betwixt the face it self, and the image of
the face in the Glass; but no Equality. 4. The Ground, or Motive inciting the
Regenerate to this selfe-purifying, viz. Hope of glory. Presumption, security,
etc. purify not, Deuteronomy. 29. 19. Luke. 17. 26, etc. Hope does; No unclean thing
can enter into the Heavenly Jerusalem, Rev. 21. 27. therefore they that hope
for heaven, cleanse themselves, that they may be fit to enter. Bono implendus
es, funde malum. Puta quia melle te vult implere Deus. Si aceto plenus es, ubi
mei pones? Fundendum est quod portabat vas. Mundandum est ipsum vas. Mundandum
est etsi cum labo^e, cum tritura, ut fiat aptum cuidam rei, Me^ dicamus, aurum
dicamus, vinum dicamus: Quicquid dicamus quod dici non potest, quicquid volumus
dicere, Deus vocatur: Et quod dicimus Deus, quid diximus? Duae istae syllab^
sunt totum quod expectamus, etc. Aug. ibid. Paulo sub.
Augustine says well, The vessel must be cleansed of Vinegar, that God may
fill it with Honey. If thou art full of Vinegar, where will thou put the Honey,
etc? Hope in Christ, excites to purity; because it conducts us straight to
Christ, the perfect pattern of all purity; says Calvin. in loc.

Now in the Regenerate that have Hope of Glory, consider these ensuing Signs
of Self purifying, as God is pure, viz.

1. Frequent washing themselves in the Fountain opened for sin and
uncleanness, viz. in the purifying blood of Christ by Faith and Hope as
instruments applying Christ crucified, Zech. 13. 1. Heb. 9. 14. Psalm. 51. 7.
Whom God has set forth to be a propitiation, through faith in his blood, etc.
Romans 3. 25.

2. Maintaining a constant spiritual combat by Faith, Hope and other Graces
of the Spirit, against the flesh: and so by the Spirit mortifying the deeds of
the flesh daily, crucifying the flesh with the affections and lusts, Gal. 5.
17. compared with, Romans 8. 13. and, Galat. 5. 24, 25. Thus Hope as an inward
Principle works out pollution and corruption, as being repugnant thereunto. As
good honey separates, and works out the dross. A pure heart mingles not with
corruption, Ps. 66. 18.

3. True endeavors to purify both soul and body, person and conversation
from all corruption universally both in kind and degree. Let us cleanse our
selves from all silthinesse of flesh and spirit, 2 Cor. 7. (...). Hypocrites
can wash the outside of the cup or platter, but inwardly they are full of
extortion and excess, Mat. 23. 25, 26. can forsake some, not all corruptions.

4. Conscientious improvement of the Word for self purifying. The Word has a
purifying faculty in it. Ye are clean through the word that I have spoken to
you, John 15. (...). The Word purifies, 1. As an Antidote against sin, Psalm.
119. 11. 2. As a Lamp discovering the spot, Romans 7. 7. 3. As a star
conducting to Christ the fountain of purifying, 1 John 2. 1, 2. Zech. 13. 1.
4. As a Rule according to which we are heedfully to order our conversation,
Psalm. 119. 9. And, 5. As a Motive, especially in the promises of it, unto
selfe-purifying, 2 Cor. 7. 1.

5. Contented bearing of heaviest afflictions, so that sin may be purged out,
Psalm 119. 67, 71. Such can say, Lord, humble me, break me, bruise me, do any
thing with me, that I may be more holy, less sinful.

6. Fervent desires and prayers for thorough purity. Cleanse thou me from
secret faults, Psalm. 19. 12. Purge me with hysop, and I shall be clean: wash
me, and I shall be whiter then snow, Psalm. 51. 7. Hence, how often do the
Regenerate long to be dissolved and to be with Christ, that they might never
sin more, but have all spots and wrinkles wiped away for evermore.

CHAP. III.
Evidences or Signs that we are of the Truth; And of the number of Gods own
People.

I.
HAving an Unction from the Holy one, teaching us all things. They went out I.
from us, but they were not of us: -- But ye have an Unction from the Holy one,
and ye shall know all things. -- The Anointing which ye have received of him,
abides in you, 1 John 2. 19, 20, 27. For clearing this Evidence, consider
herein: 1. How the Apostle brands some for their Hypocrisy, discovering it
self in their Apostasy. They fell away, viz to Antichristian Doctr. v. 18.
Went out from us: therefore they were not of us; no more then chafe mingled
with the wheat, is wheat; when the fan comes, the chafe flies away. 2. How
the Apostle commends those to whom he wrote, opposing them to these
Hypocritical Apostates, as having the Anointing of the Spirit from Christ
abiding in them, and teaching them all things. These then having this Unction
from the Holy one teaching them all things, are of the number of Gods people:
inasmuch as they here stand opposed to them that were not of Gods people,
though once they lived among them.

Now in this Evidence further observe, 1. The Distinctive character, An
Unction, viz. The Holy Spirit. This the gladning oil wherewith Christ was
anointed above all his fellows, Kings, Priests, Prophets, Members, Psalm. 45.
7. with Acts 4. 27. and 10. 38. his fellows then had some of this anointing,
John 1. 14, 16. 2. The Fountain whence this Unction flows to them, viz. from
the Holy-one, i. e. Christ. An allusion (thinks Calvin, Comment, in loc,
Calvin) to the Sanctuary, whence the oil was fetched to anoint the Priests.
And Daniel describes Christ's coming to be the proper time for anointing the
most Holy, Dan. 9. 24. 3. The Receptacle of this unction from Christ in whom it
should abide; ye have an unction. -- 4. The effect of this unction upon them,
Teaching them all things, viz. All things necessary to salvation. If now we
have this unction from Christ, teaching us all things, we are of the people of
God.

Signs that we have the Unction of the Spirit from Christ, teaching us all
things.

1. When this unction the Spirit teaches us with a Scripturr-knowlede, not
with Enthusiasmes; or orher by-ways. Thus he taughr David, Ps. 119. 99, 104.
Thus Timothy, 2 Timothy 3. 14, 15. Hence, called the Spirit of Truth, because he
acts upon us, by and according to Scripture-Truth, John 14. 17.

2. The Spirits teaching is clear and certain in necessaries to salvation,
Prove. 22. 20, 21. Ioh. 6. 69. 1 Cor. 2. 15.

3. The Spirits teaching is of a Growing nature. The more he instructs us, the
more we desire to be instructed of him, Prove. 1. 5. and 15. 14. and 18. 15.
David though he knew so much, yet wonderously thirsted to know more, Ps. 119.
27, 73, 125, 144.

4. The Spirits teaching meekens and humbles a man's Spirit, Iam. 3. 13. Psalm.
25. 9. for it manifests still more and more ignorance and sin, Ephesians. 5. 13.
Carnal knowledge swells, puffes up, 1 Cor. 8. 1.

5. The Spirits teaching floats not only in the Head, but kindly soaks into
the Heart, and forcibly works upon the Affections, Josh. 23. 14. Psalm. 34. 8.
stirring up the heart to trust, love, joy, etc. in spirituals, Ps. 9. 10. 1
Ioh. 4. 8. 1 Pet. 1. 8.

6. The Spirits teaching is, Practical. Brings not only to knowing, but to
doing. It is very effective, alters and changes a man wonderfully; and diverts
his course from sin, to sanctity. See Ephesians. 4. 20, 21, 22, 23, etc. 2 Cor.
3. 18. Job. 28. 28. Psalm. 119. 104. Prove. 15. 21. Psalm. 111. 10. Iam. 3. 17.
Ier. 22. 16.

7. The Spirits teaching makes men come to Christ, and believe in him, Joh. 6.
44, 45. Make it evident thou come to Christ, believe in him, thou art
taught most effectually.

Finally, The true teaching of Gods Spirit wonderfully strengthens and
preserves against temptations and snares, Prove. 24. 5. See Prove. 2. 10, 11.
compared with verse. 12. 15, 16.

Search, and consider; has this Teaching Unction thus illuminated and
instructed thee? doubtless thou art of the number of Gods Church taught of God.

II.
The Testimony of an upright Heart, or II.
Conscience touching our real and true love of the Brethren. My little
children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but indeed and in truth.
And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before
him. For if our heart condemn us. God is greater then our heart, and knows
all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
toward God, 1 John 3 18, 19, 20, 21. Here are, 1. An exhortation to real and
true Brotherly love, ver. 18. 2. A Demonstration hereby that we are of the
Truth, viz. Borne of God, who is Truth; or, Having the truth of God in us, ver.
19 3. The Confirmation of this Evidence; By the testimony of our conscience
concerning it, in the sight of God, and shall assure our hearts before him,
verse 19. This is further streng^hened by arguing from the double act of a
well-guided conscience, viz. (1) Accusing, If conscience condemn us for not
lo^ing the brethren truly, or for any other thing, much more will God condemn
us, ver. 20. (2.) Excusing, If Conscience clear us, we have confidence toward
God, viz. that we are of the Truth.

The Testimony of our heart and Conscience for us, or against us, is most
Comforting, or corroding. How was Judas tortured with an accusing conscience!
Matthew. 27. 3, 4, 5. How was Paul in deepest trials supported with an excusing
conscience? 2 Cor. 1. 12. The Heathen could say, -- Hic murus aheneus esto, Nil
conscire sibi, nulla pallescere culpa. Horat. lib: 1. Epist. 1*
A clear conscience is as a wall of Brass. The Proverb says, A good
conscience is a continual feast. With this Augustine comforted himself
against Secundinus the Manichee, who aspersed him, saying, Senti de Augustino
quicquid libet, sola me in (...) Dei conscient^ non accus^t. Aug. con^a
S^cundinum Man chapter lib. c. 1.
Think thou of Augustine what thou please, so conscience only accuse me not
in the sight of God. Can thou now in thy conscience oppeale to God about thy
love of the brethren, as sometimes Peter about his love of Christ, Lord, thou
know all things, thou art greater then my conscience, thou know that
indeed and in truth I love thy children? Hereby thou may know that thy self
art of the truth.

Signs of true brotherly love, see in chap. 2. Sign. VII. p 168, to 173.

III.
Finally, Perseverance with the faithful III.
in Christ and in the truth. They went out from us, but they were not of us;
for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: But
they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us, 1
John 2. 19. He speaks of Ebion, Cerinthus, and such like Antichristian
Heretics, who apostatizing from Christ and his truth, departed from the
Church. They were once in the Church, but never truly of the Church, for then
they would have persevered. Their Apostasy therefore evidenced their
Hypocrisy. Whereas contrariwise, Perseverance is a sure Argument of our
Sincerity, and that we are indeed anointed with the Spirit of truth. The
anointing which ye have received of him, abides in you; and ye need not that
any man teach you: But as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is
truth, and is no lie: And even as it has taught you, ye shall abide in him, 1
John 2. 27. In which words as the Apostle testifies, that they shall persevere
in Christ, that are truly taught by the anointing, which is truth and no lie:
So he declares, that they were never of the true number of Gods people, that
through heresy and schism depart from the Communion of the Church and the
Faithful; As Jude intimates, These be they who separate themselves, sensual,
having not the Spirit, Jude verse. 19. False rotten Professors will thus
Apostatize, but true sound members will persevere in the truth with the
faithful, for Reasons Seep 133, etc.
formerly alleged.

Do thou now backslide and separate through heresy or schism, from
communion with the true Church of Christ? How can thou think thy self to be
of the true number of Gods people? Notably Cyprian, Quisquis ab Ecclesia
segregatus adul teraejungitur, a promissis Ecclesiaesegre gatur. Ne^ perveniet
ad Christi praemia, qui relinquit Ecclesiam Christi. Al^enus est, profanus est,
hostisest. Habere jam non potest Deum Pat^em, qui Ecclesiam non h^betmatrem. Si
potuit evadere quisquam qui extra arcam Noe fuit; and qui extra Ecclesiam foris
fuerit, eva^it. D. Cyprian. de unitate Ecclesiae. lib. Sect. 5.
Whosoever separated from the Church, is joined to an adultorous Church, is
separated from the promises of the Church. Nor shall he come to the rewards of
Christ, that leaves the Church of Christ. He is an Alien, he is profane, he is
an enemy. He cannot have God for his Father, that has not the Church for his
Mother. If any could escape, that was without Noah's Ark: then may be escape
that is without the Church. And afterward he adds; Nemo existimet, bonos de
Ecclesia posse disce* dear. Triticum non rapit ventus; Nec arborem solida
radice fundatamprocella subvertit. ^nanes paleae tempestate jactantur,
invalidae arbores turbinis incursione evertuntur. Hos execratur and percutit
Joannes Apostolus dicens, Ex nobis exierunt, etc. 1 John 2. 19. Hinc Haereses
and factae sunt frequenter, and fiunt, dum perversa men's non habet pacem, cum
perfidia discordans non tenet unitatem. Cyprian. De unitat. Eccles. lib. Sect.
8. 9.
Let no man think that the good can depart from the Church. Wind blows not
away the wheat; nor does the tempest subvert the well-rooted Tree, vain chafe
is blown away with the wind, invalid trees are torn up with the whirlewinde.
These John the Apostle execrates and smites, saying, They went out of us, etc.
Hence heresies have often been, and are, whilst a perverse mind has not
peace, whilst a discording perfidiousnesse holds not Unity.

CHAP. IV.
Evidences or Signs of being in Light, not in Darkness; in Life, not in Death.

I.
Actual interest in, and enjoyment of 1.
Jesus Christ, is an Evidence we are partakers of supernatural and eternal
life. This is the Record that God has given to us eternal life, and this life
is in his Son. He that has the Son, has life; and he that has not the
Son, has not life, 1 John 5. 11, 12. Life is the sweetness of enjoyments;
Eternal life, the best of lives that creatures can possess: Of this eternal
life here are laid down, 1. The Primary Fountain of it, viz. God and his free
grace. 2. The Mediatory Receptacle or Treasury, wherein God has seated this
eternal life for us, viz His Son 3. The way of conveyance of this life from
Christ to us, viz. By having the Son. They have Christ, that believe in him,
Joh. 1. 12, 13. They have him not that believe not in him. So they that believe
in Christ have Christ: They that have Christ and actual interest in him, have
eternal life from him, yea, and saving light in him. For, (1.) Christ is
light, John 1. 4, 9. light of the world, John 8. 12. Christ also is light, John
5. 26. and 11. 25. and 14. 6. The Prince of life, Acts 3. 15. (2.) Men in their
natural Christlesse condition are dark, yea, darkness itself, Acts 26. 18.
Ephesians. 5. 8. yea, dead in sin. Ephesians. 2. 1. Consequently from both these, they
that have the Son, which is light and life, must needs have light and life.
Now they have the Son that believe in him.

Signs of true believing in Christ, see in Chap. II. Evidence II. p. 23, to 29.

Evidences of having the Son, (that we may come more closely to the
expression here in the Text.) Having the Son, implies,

1. A true inward Covenant-right, Claim or Title to him, by spiritual union to
him. Covenant and promises tender Christ, and that upon conditions
Evangelicall, Ioh. 3. 16. Luke 9. 23. Faith receives Christ tendered upon his
own terms, John 1. 12. As Saul converted, for Christ denied himself, and all
things, Phil. 3. 7, 8. Took up his Cross daily, 2 Cor. 11. 23, to the end, and
followed Christ, 1 Cor. 11. 1. Now Christ being thus received, Christ and the
Soul are thus united. Faith eats Christ, and assimilates the believer into
his nature. Faith unites to Christ, so that he who is joined to the Lord, is
one Spirit, 1 Cor. 6. 17. Have thou such a Covenant-right to Christ, and
spiritual union to Christ?

2. Hence an happy spiritual fruition or enjoyment of him by holy Commnnion
with him, in his Person, Offices and Benefits: in himself and all his; As,
Cant. 2. 16. John 20. 28. 2 Pet. 1. 3, 4. 2 Cor. 1. 20. Romans 8. 32. 1 Cor. 3.
20, 21. Among other blessings communicated from Christ, life is one: Christ
lives in us by faith, Gal. 2. 20. Further, they that have Christ, have these
things in and with Christ,

1. They have the Spirit of Christ, 1 John 4. 13. Romans 8. 9.

2. They are become New Creatures, old things are past away, all things become
new, 2 Cor. 5. 17.

3. They have cencified the flesh with the affections and lusts, Gal. 5. 24.

4. They walk not af^r the flesh, but after the Spirit, Romans 8. 1, 2.

5. They are most obedient to Christ and his Commands, Heb. 5. 9. How can he
say that he has Christ, Ceterum credere se in Christu^ quomodo dicit, qui non
facit, ^uod Christus facere praecipit? aut unde perveniet ad prae^ium fidei,
qui fidem non vult servare mandati? Nutet neces^e est, and vagetur, and Spiritu
erroris ereptus, velut pulvis quem ^entus excutit, ventiletur; nec ambulando
proficiet ad salu^m, qui salutaris viae non tenet veritatem. D. Cyprian. de
uni^. Eccles. lib. Sect. 1.
that he believes in Christ, (says Cyprian) that does not what Christ
commanded to be done? or how shall he come to the reward of faith, that keeps
not the faith of the Command?

3. Finally, A sweet conformity to him in his Sonship. They that have the Son
are consorme to the image of his Son, that he may be the firstborn among
many brethren, Romans 8. 29. Conformare imagini Filii sui, nempe tum in forma, h.
e. justitia and sanctitate: tum in fine, i. e. faelicitate and gloria^tum in
medtis ad finem, i. e. afflictionibus and cruce. Christus enim justus and
sanctus per crucem ingressus est in Gloriam, Dav. Pareus in Romans 8. 29.
Conformity to Christ is either. (1.) In his gracious image, viz. in
righteousness and true holiness, Ephesians. 4. 24. (2.) In his glorious image, viz.
when we shall be like him in glory, Phil. 3. 20. 1 John 3. 2, 3. (3) In his
afflicted image, viz. when we suffer with him, and for him, Romans 8. 17. John
15. 18, to 22. and when we suffer for righteousness with Patience, Meekness,
etc. as he suffered, 1 Pet. 2. 21. to the end. Are we thus conform indeed to
the Son? then we have the Son Jesus Christ, and live by him.

II.
Loving and not hating of our brother, 11.
is another Sign we are in light, not in darkness; in life, not in death. He
that says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness even
until now. He that loves his brother, abides in the light, and there is no
occasion of stumbling in him; but he that hates his brother is in darkness,
and knows not whither he goes, because that darkness has blinded his eyes,
1 John. 2 9, 10, 11. And elsewhere; We know that we have passed from death to
life, because we love the brethren: He that loves not his brother, abides in
death. Whosoever hates his brother, is a murderer: And you know that no
murderer has eternal life ahiding in him, 1 John 3. 14, 15.

In these passages the love of the brethren, is made a most clear Note of out
abiding in the lighe, (viz. spiritual or true illumination and grace,) and
that we have already passed from death in sin, to life supernatural in
Christ, We know that we have passed, etc. And contrariwise the not loving, or
hating our brother, an evident Sign that we remain still under the state and
dominion of carnal sinful darkness and death. Make sure of true brotherly
love, you are in true light and life indeed.

Signs of true love of the brethren See, Chap. 2. Sign, VII. p. 168, to p.
173. and Chap. 8. throughout.

CHAP. V.
Evidences, or Signs of our true knowledge of God, and of Jesus Christ, The
knowledge of whom is life eternal, John 17. 3.

I.
FIrst, The real and sincere keeping of I.
Gods Commandments, evidenceth that we know God, and Jesus Christ aright.
Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments. He that says
I know him, and keeps not his Commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not
in him, 1 Ioh. 43, 4. This note is laid down, (1.) Affirmatively, and (2.)
Negatively. He that keeps his Commandments knows him; yea, knows that be knows
him. He that keeps not hi^ Commandments knows him not, yea, he lies if be
says he knows him. David concluded, He had more knowledge then his enemies,
then the Ancients, then his Teachers, and all because he kept Gods
Commandments, Psalm. 119. 98, 99, 100. They that truly know God cannot choose
but keep his Commandments. For they know. (1.) The Authority of God commanding
to be supreme, Iam. 4. 12. (2.) The holiness, justness and goodness of Gods
laws commanded, Romans 7. 12. (3.) The greatness of Gods rewards in keeping of
them, Psalm. 19. 11. Deuteronomy. 28. 1, to 15. (4.) The seventy of Gods wrath, against
the wilful breakers of them, Deuteronomy. 28. 15, to the end.

For clearing the Evidence, consider

1. What is meant by knowledge of God. 2. What by keeping his Commandments. 3.
Signs of this keeping Gods Commandments.
I. Knowledge of God and of Christ, is either,

1. Both true and perfect: whereby God is clearly known, thus none know God in
this life but Christ the Son, Matthew. 11. 27. In the life to come all the
Elect shall thus know God, 1 Ioh. 3. 2.

2. Nor true nor perfect, (in reference to him that knows,) but dubious,
uncertain, hypocritical, and common to Reprobates, which is rather an
opinion, then a knowledge of God, 1 Cor. (...). 14.

3. True, but ^mperfect; whereby all regenerate persons do truly, though
weakly, know God in this life, Ier. 31. 34. John 6. 45. 1 Cor. 13. 9. 12.

Here understand the last sort of knowledge.

II. Keeping of Gods Commandments flows originally from the true knowledge of
God, For we so far act as we affect or love, Tantum diligimus, quantum
cognoscimus.
we so far love as we know. Hence from this threefold knowledge, arises a
threefold obedience, viz.

1. Both true and perfect: Only by Christ on earth, by Saints and Angels in
heaven, Phil. 2. 8. Mat. 6 10.

2. Nor true nor perfect, as the obedience of hypocrites and carnal men; who
if they sail not in the matter of obedience, yet they still fail in the
ground, manner and end of obedience, Romans 8. 8. Heb. 11. 6.

3. True and sincere, but imperfect, by Saints on earth, who for matter,
ground, manner and end of obedience, are sincere, the bent and maine
disposition of their hearts upright and unfeigned, (notwithstanding there be
some graduall infirmities and imperfections,) As Zachariah, and Elizabeth
walked in all the Commandments of God blameless, Luke 1. 6. Here understand
this third sort of keeping Gods Commandments, to be a sign of true knowledge
of God.

III. Signs of true keeping Gods Commandments, whence we may know that we
truly know God.

1. The Law and Commandments of God are written in the heart of that person
that truly keeps them, Ier. 31. 33. Psalm. 40. 7, 8. The heart within, answers
to the Commandments without; As a Book written answers to his mind that
writes it; As the impression on the wax, answers to the character engraven on
the Seal, etc.

2. The inward man, viz. the sanctified mind and will, and the fixed
disposition of them, delight in the Law and Commandments of God, (though that
other law in the members rebel against it,) Romans 7. 18, 21, 22, 23, 25. How
did David delight in Gods laws! Psalm 119. 97. Delightful loving, cordial
obedience is the truest keeping of Gods Commandments. They are far from
keeping Gods Commandments, whose minds are enmity against Gods Law, Romans 8. 7.

3. Turning from every evillway, for the keeping of Gods Word, Psalm. 119. 101.

4. Obeying Gods Commandments Evangelically, for substance and circumstance,
as he requires.

For Matter, what he requires, John 1. 5. 14.

For Ground, and root of obedience, 1 Timothy 1. 5.

For Manner, how he requires, John 4. 24.

For end, which we should aim at in all obedience, 1 Cor. 10. 32.

5. Universal unlimited respect to all Gods Commandments; one as well as
another, Psalm. 119. 6. Iam. 2. 10, 11. As Caleb, Numb. 14. 24. As Zachariah and
Elizabeth kept all, Luke 1. 6.

6. Constancy and Perseverance in keeping Gods Commandments, Psalm. 1. 2, 3,
and 119. 20. I have inclined my heart to do thy statutes always unto the end,
Psalm. 119. 112.

II.
Secondly, Not sinning or Denial, renouncing II.
of sin aright, evidenceth we know God aright. They that commit sin, are
grossly ignorant of God. Whosoever sins, has not seen him, neither known
him, 1 John 3. 6.

This particular of [not sinning] as the property of the regenerate: Together
with the distinctive differences betwixt the sinning of the regenerate, and of
unregenerate persons, See fully opened, Chap. 2. Evidence 3. page 29, to p. 60.

III.
Thirdly, A right entertaining, and III.
hearkening to the true Apostolical doctrine, is a notable evidence of the
true knowledge of God in us; as the listening to false Teachers and doctrines
rejecting the true, is a sign of ignorance of God, and of a carnal state,
They, (viz. Antichristian Teachers, v. 3.) are of the world: therefore speak
they of the world, and the world hears them: We are of God: He that knows
God, hears us; He that is not of God, hears not us: Hereby know we the
Spirit of truth and the spirit of error, 1 John 4. 5, 6.

Signs of right entertaining and harkening to true Apostolical doctrine.

1. When we entertain their doctrine discerningly, distinguishing and
discriminating by help of Scriptures, their sound doctrine from all unsound
opinions, diverse and strange Doctrines of false teachers, Heb. 5. 14. 1 Ioh. 4.
1. Act. 17. 11. Rev. 2. 2.

2. When discerning their doctrine, we entertain it believingly, the Word
being mingled, contempered, or united with faith in the hearers, Heb. 4. 2.

3. When we entertain it readily, with all readiness of mind, Act. 17. 11.

4. When we entertain it reverentially, with awful trembling at it, as the
Word of God, Isa. 66. 2. 1 These. 2. 13.

5. When we entertain it with a singular love, affectionatenesse and
estimation, Gal. 4. 13, 14, 15. contrary is that in 2 These. 2. 10, 11.

6. When we entertain it obedientially; obeying from the heart that form of
doctrine unto which we are delivered, Romans 6. 17. being conformed, yea,
transformed by the doctrine received, yielding prosessed subjection to the
Gospel, 2 Cor. 9. 13.

7. When we so receive it as to retain it firmly, not leaking, or letting it
slip, Heb. 2. 1. 1 These. 5. 20, 21.

IV.
Finally, Mutual, Reciprocal, Brotherly IV.
love, Evinceth that we know God aright. Beloved, let us love one another, for
love is of God: and every one that loves, is borne of God, and knows God. He
that loves not knows not God; for God is love, 1 John 4. 7, 8.

He must needs know God that truly loves his brother, the child of God. For 1.
He that loves his brother, is borne of God, 1 John 4. 7. and 3. 10, 14. and he
that is borne of God, among other graces infused, has illumination whereby he
knows God. 2. He that loves his brother truly, knows Gods image in his
brother, how lovely it is in him, and therefore loves him, 1 John 5. 1. 3. He
that loves his brother, knows Gods Authority in his Command. And this
Commandment we have from him, that he who loves God, love his brother also, 1 John 4. 21.

Signs of true brotherly love, See in Cap. II. p. 168, to 173. and Chap. 8.
throughout.

CHAP. VI.
Evidences or Signs of our true love to God, and to Jesus Christ.

I.
FIrst, Our true love to God, flows from Gods love to us. Love breeds I.
love as naturally as light breeds light, and fire breeds fire. We love him,
because he first loved us, 1 John 4. 19. Omnis equitas dictat, ut dilectus
diligentem diligat, and amatus amanti mutuam charitatem impendat. Bern. De
Coen. Dom. Sermon. 13. p. 1358.
All equity, (says Bernard) dictates, that the beloved should love the lover.
Had not God first loved us, we should never have loved him, being naturally
God-haters, Romans 1. 30. and, 8. 7. But when once God pleases to shed abroad
his love in our hearts, Romans 5. 5. giving us some sense or taste of his love to
us, viz. of his Electing love, Romans 9. 13. Col. 3. 12, O stupenda Deimiseratio!
verbum ^arnem, Deus cinerem, figulus lutum, vita morticinium induit, ut jumenra
mandutarent panem Angelorum. Bernard in Coen. Dom. 1678, Antverp.
of his Redeeming love; Gal. 2. 20. Rev. 1. 5. of his Regenerating love, Tit.
3. 4, 5, 6. of his Adopting love. 1 John 3. 1, 2. etc. How can we choose but
love him again, and love him much? Luke 7. 47. Desidero itaque amare, and amo
desiderare te: and hoc modo curro ut apprehendam in quo apprehensus sum,
scilicet ut amem te perfect aliquando, O qui prior nos amasti, amande, and
amabilis Domine. Bernard. Soliloq. Sect 6. p. 511. M. Antverp. 1616.
I desire to love thee, (said Bernard) and love to desire thee, O amiable Lord,
most worthy to be beloved. And thus I run to apprehend that wherein I am
apprehended, viz. That I may perfectly love thee at last, who have loved us
first. But how or wherein did God love us first, he expresses thus, saying,
Quicquid fecit, quicquid dixit in terris, usque ad opprobria, usque ad spura
and alapas, usque ad crucem and sepulchrum, non fuit nisi loqui tuum nobis in
Filio, amore^tuo provocans and suscitans amorem nostrum. -- Qui docuit nos
amare se, cum prior dilexit nos: A mando and diligendo suscitans nos ut amemus
eum, qui prior usque in finem dilexit nos, etc. Bern. Soliloq. Sect. 11. p.
513. E. F. A. B.
Whatsoover he did, whatsoever he spoke on earth, to reproaches, spittings,
buffetings, Cross and the grave, was nothing but Gods language to us in his
Son, by his love provoking and stirring up our love.

Would thou know now whether thou love God? Search diligently whether God
loves thee in Christ; what application has he made of his love to thee; what
true effect do thou find of the special love of God or Christ upon thee.

Signs of Gods special love, of Christ's peculiar love actually applied to us.

1. Is this love of God shed abroad in thine heart by the holy Ghost, that thou
have an inward cordial experimental taste of Gods love? Romans 5. 5.

2. Has this love of God effectually regenerated and renewed thee by the
Spirit? Tit. 3. 4, 5, 6.

3. Has this love of God adopted thee, that thou art numbered among the Sons
of God? 1 Ioh. 3. 1, 2.

4. Has this love of God sanctified thee, and made thee holy? Col. 3. 12.

5. Has this love of God brought thee to live the life of faith, yea, rather
to have Christ living in thee? Gal. 2. 20.

6. Does this love of God and Christ sweetly overpower, constrain, and even
compel thee to be chearefully serviceable to him in thy place and calling? 2
Cor. 5. 13, 14, 15, 16.

II.
Secondly, The rejecting or casting out II.
of base sinful servile fear; evidenceth our true love to God and Jesus
Christ. There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear: because
fear has torment. He that fears, is not made perfect in love, 1 John 4. 18,
19.

Quest. But what fear is it now, which is thus inconsistent with love, which
love casts out?

Answ. Fear may be considered, either,

1. Objectively, as it is the object feared, so it denotes, 1. God, Psalm. 76.
11. called the Fear of Isaac; either because Isaac yielded fear to God, or
because God struck Isaac with fear when he would have blessed E -- sau, Genesis
31. 42, 53. 2. Gods Word; The rule of fear, Psalm. 19. 9. True love casts out
neither of these, but keeps and cherishes them in the soul.

2. Subjectively, As fear is subjected in us; Thus fear denotes, 1. The
natural affection, or Passion of fear. Si malum naturae quod est corruptivum,
apprehendatur ut propinquum, and tamen cum aliqua spe evasionis tunc timebitur.
Aquin. prim. s^cundae, Q. ^42. Artic. 2. Conc^us.
Arising upon some apprehension of some evil as imminent, and hardly to be
avoided. This fear is in it self, neither morally good nor bad: but as
sanctified or mixed with diffidence, etc. Mere humane fear was in Christ, yet
without sin, Heb. 5. 7. Love casts not out this fear: for that were to put
off humane nature. 2. Fear the sanctified affection, whereby the Saints are
afraid to offend God their heavenly Father, for his mercy, goodness, etc.
through the love and reverence they bear to him for his eminency, Oderunt
peccare boni virtutis amore* Oderunt peccare mai^ formicine poenae. Horat.
and to true piety, Psalm. 130. 4. and this fear springs from love, 3. A
sinful servile slavish fear, whereby we inordinately, slavishly fear either
God, Romans 8. 15. as the Samaritans for his Lions, 2 King. 17. 25, 32, 33, 34.
or the creature, Matthew. 10. 28. This is the fear that love casts out. Love
has boldness and confidence in it; fear is full of diffidence and
cowardlinesse. Has thy love to God cast out this base fear? that is love
indeed.

Signs that Hagar is ejected, that slavish fear is cast out.

1. The Spirit of adoption, Son-like Spirit removing base fear, Romans 8. 15.

2. The Spirit of supplication, crying with filial boldness and confidence,
Abba Father, Romans 8. 15. Gal. 4 6.

3. The souls pacification by justifying faith. This allayes tumultuous
fears. That diffusion of the love of God in the heart, and quieting of
conscience by faith, are companions, are twins in the same soul, Romans 5. 1; 5.

4 True awful religious fear of God, swallowing up base fears of the
Creature, Mat. 10. 28. Isa. 8. 12, 13.

5. Magnanimous courage and resolutions from love and zeal to Christ and his
Cause, against sharpest sufferings and persecutions, Cant. 8. 6, 7. Acts 20.
23, 24, and 21. 13 Rev. 12. 11. Such has been the love of Saints and Martyrs
to Christ, that they have not feared to own and confess Christ in worst of
times; nor feared to go with Christ both into prisons, and to death. Denique
memor Apocalypsis suae, in qua timidorum exitum audierat, de suo sensu admonet
and ipse, timorem rejiciendum, Timor, inquit, non est in dilectione. Sed enim
perfecta dilectio for as mittit timorem: Quia timor supplicamentum babet: utique
ignem stagni. Qui ^em timet, non est perfectus in dilectione, Dei scilicet.
Porro quis fugiet persecutionem, nisi qui timebit? Quis timebit, nisi qui non
amavit? Tertull. de fuga in Persecut. l. c, 9. p. 585. Franekerae 1597.
Who will flee persecution, (said Tertullian) but he that fears? who fears,
but he that does not love? And elsewhere, Non potest qui pati timet, ejus esse
qui passus est: At qui pati non timet, iste perfectus erit in dilectione,
utique Dei. Tertul. ibid. c. 14.

Quem timorem intelligi praestat, nisi negationis auctorem? Quam dilectionem
perfectam adfirmat, nisi fugatricem timoris and animatricem confessionis?
Tertul. Scorpiacum advers. Gnostie. c. 12. p. 490. Franeker. 1597.


He that fears to suffer, cannot be his that suffered: but he that fears not
to suffer, he is perfect in Gods love.

III.
Thirdly, Not loving the world, nor the III.
things that are in the world, excessively, inordinately; discovers the love of
God planted in our hearts. Love not the world, neither the things that are in
the world: If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,
(viz. neither Passively: He is not beloved of the Father: nor Actively, He
loves not the Father) 1 John 2. 15, 16. For, 1. God and the world, are two such
contrary Masters, and each of them are so able to take up the whole man, that
they cannot be intensively loved both at once, but the love of the one will
prove the hatred of the other, Matthew. 6. 24. Iam. 4. 4. 2. God requires our
whole love to himself, Luke 10. 27. and he is so jealous a God that he can
endure no corrivall with himself, in our hearts and affections. Excellently
Am^orem mundi odit Spiritus Christi, ab illo fugit quemaliud nisi seipsum amare
cognoscit. Ita vult amari, ut nihil aliud praeter ipsum ametur. Perfect vult
amari, qui solus vult diligi: non vult consortem habere in amore, qui parem non
habet dilectionis retributione. Et tamen sic vult amari, ut cunctae res simul
amentur cum ipso: and sic vult amari, ut nihil praeter ipsum ametur. Omnis enim
catura jure creationis ab illo est, and omnis creatura, in eo quod est
creatura, bona est. Debet ergo ad hoc diligi creatura, ut in ipsacreator
ametur. Non ipsa per se, at per eum qui illam creavit. Qui enim sic diligit
aurum, argentum, possessionem, vatiam supellectilem, ita ut haec sint sibi
causa amoris, profecto non est in illis charitas Patris. Diligendus est ergo
creator in cunctis creaturis, and cunctae per ipsum creaturae: and sic cuncta
diliguntur cum ipso, and tamen ipse solus diligitur. Bernard in Can* Dam. Sermon.
8. p. 1337. D. Antverp. 1616.
Bernard, The Spirit of Christ hates the lover of the world, flies from him
whom he knows to love any thing besides him. He will be so loved, as nothing
should be loved besides him. He will be perfectly loved, that will be alone
loved: He will have no sharer in his love, that has no equal in the reward of
love. He will be so loved, that all things also may be loved with him: and yet
he will so be loved, that nothing be beloved besides him. The Creature should
be loved for the Creator that made it, The Creator in the Creature for himself.

Would thou know whether thou love God truly? Search then whether thou
love not the world inordinately.

Signs of inordinate love to the world, and the things of the world.

I. Over-desiring the world, and things of the world, craving, asking, etc.
when we want them, Prove. 30. 15. Matthew. 6. 25, 31. 1 Timothy 6. 9, 10. This
over-eagernesse of our hearts after them when we want them, discovers it self
in,

1. Discontentednesse at our present condition, Heb. 13. 5.

2. Enviousnesse at others prosperity and enjoyments, as in Ahab, 1 King. 21.
4. David tempted to this, Psalm. 73. 3.

3. Excessive running out of the heart and mind about them, Ezekiel. 33. 33. Luke
12. 17, 18, 29.

4. A Resolvednesse or fixed will to be rich, 1 Timothy 6. 9.

5. Pursuing after worldly shadows, more then after the Kingdom of God and his
righteousness, Matthew. 6. 33.

6. Unconscionablenesse in getting the world, by bribery, extortion,
oppression, theft, fraud, etc. Amos 8, 4. 1 These. 4. 6.

II. Over-loving and d^ting upon the world, and things of the world, whilst we
have them, setting our heart on them, Psalm. 62. 10. evidenced by

1. Over-highly esteeming them, above their worth, making gods of them, Col. 3.
5. Ephesians. 5. 5. Phil. 3. 19.

2. Relying and trusting in them, Prove. 18. 11. 1 Timothy 6. 17.

3. Boasting, glorying in them, Psalm. 49. 6. Ier. 9. 23.

4. Applanding our selves as happy men, by reason of them, Luke 12. 19. Psalm.
17. 14.

5. Sordid detaining, not being willing to part with worldly things, though
upon most just occasions of piety, charity or necessity, as in Nabal, 1 Samuel
25. 10, 11, the rich glutton, Luke 16. 19, etc. Eccles. 6. 1, 2. Such a man
parts with his pence, as if they were so many drops of blood from his heart.

III. Over-grieving and vexing when we lose the things of the world, As
Achitophel losing his honor, in discontent hangs himself, 2 Samuel 17. 23.

IV.
Fourthly, Keeping of the Commandments IV.
of God, and that cheerfully, notably discovers our true love to God and to
Jesus Christ; But whosoever keeps his word, in him verily is the love of God
perfected, 1 John. 2. 5. And elsewhere: This is the love of God, that we keep
his Commandments, and his Commandments are not grievous, 1 John 5. 3. To this
purpose said Clement (...). Clem. Romans 1 Epist. ad Cor. p. 63. Edit. Oxon. 1633.
Romanus, (the Apostles Companion, Phil. 4. 3.) He that has love in Christ,
will keep the Commands of Christ. And In hoc cognoscitur amor Christi, si quis
servat praecepta Christi. Qui habet mandata mea and servat ea, ille est qui
diligit me. Qui havet in memoria, and servat in vita: Quui habet faciendo, and
servat perseverando; vel qui habet in sermonibus, and servat in moribus: vel
qui habet audiendo, and servat faciendo, ille est qui diligit me. Multi sunt
enim qui Domini mandata habent, and ea minime tenent. Multi habent in libro,
sed ea non tenent in animo: multi in voce, sed non in opere: multi in memoria,
sed non in vita: multi in verbo, sed non in exemplo. Illi profecto non sunt de
dilectoribus Christi. Bern* in Coen. D^m. Sermon 9. p. 1339. K. L.
Bernard sweetly seconds him; By this may be known the love of Christ, if a man
keep the Commands of Christ. He that has my Commandments and keeps them, he
it is that loves me. Who has them in memory, and keeps them in life: who has
them in doing, and keeps them in persevering. Or, who has them in words, and
keeps them in manners: or who has them in hearing, and keeps them in doing, he
it is that loves me. For many have the Lords Commandments, but keep them not;
many have them in their book, but keep them not in their breast: many have them
in word, keep them not in work: many have them in memory, keep them not in
life: etc. truly these are not of the lovers of Christ.

And no wonder, For 1. Christ requires our keeping of his Commandments, as the
singular touchstone of our love to him, Illum in veritate diligimus, si ejus
mandata servamus. Et si ejus non servamus mandatum, cerre nec diligimus eum.
Non potest ex una part diligi, and ex altera part contemn. -- Non vos fallat,
dilectissimi, vestis religiosa: mihi credit, non diligitis Deum, si illius
mandata hon observatis. Quomodo possumus Dominum diligere habitu, si eum
contemnimus actu? Dilectio Dei non quaerit vestem, sed nostram mentem: nec
quaerit opinionem, sed tantum bonam actionem. Probatio dilectionis, exhibitio
est operis. Bern. in Coen. Dom. Sermon. 8. p. 1336. L. M.
exhibition of work, is the probation of love, John 14. 15, 21. Therefore if we
keep not his Commandments, he will accept no love from us. 2. Love is
obediential; the nature of true love to God, carries it spontaneously to the
keeping of the Commands of God, Romans 13. 8, 9. 3. Love is a lively cheerful
Principle; what love acts, is acted without grievousnesse. It delights in doing
any thing for the object beloved, and stands not upon difficulties, Genesis 29.
20. Therefore true love to God thinks no duty too much for God, none enough for
God. 4. True love can cheerfully endure for Christ, much more do for Christ,
Cant. 8. 6, 7. Acts. 20. 23, 24, and 21. 13.

Search now; do thou keep his Word? Or are his Commandments grievous to thee?

Signs of true keeping Gods Word and Commandments. See Cap. V. Sign I. p.

Signs that his Commandments are not grievous to us.

I. When we have a dear and precious account of Gods Word and Commandments,
esteeming them more then our necessary food, Job 23. 12. sweetert hen honey and
the honey-combe, Psalm. 19. 9. and 119. 103. beyond great spoil, Psalm. 119.
162. Thousands of gold and silver, Psalm. 119. 72. and all riches, Psalm. 119. 14.

II. When our hearts and affections are strongly set upon them. Oh how love I
thy law! Psalm. 119. 97. I opened my mouth, and panted, for I longed for thy
Commandments, Psalm. 119. 131. My soul breaks for longing to thy judgments at
all times, Psalm. 119. 20. Romans 7. 22. Thy Law is in my heart, I delight to do
thy will, Psalm. 40. 8.

III. When it cuts and wounds our spirits, that others break Gods Laws, Psalm.
P19s 53, 136, 139.

IV. When we observe and keep the Word and Commandments of God.

1. Willingly, will voluntarinesse I will sacrifice to thee, Heb.] Psalm. 54. 6
Psalm. 110. 3.

2. Simply, not disputing the Command of God. As Abraham, Heb. 11. 8, 17, 18,
19.

3. Cheerfully, with delight, Psalm. 40. 8. Romans 7. 22.

4. Speedily, Psalm. 119. 32. I made haste and delayed not to keep thy
Commandments, Psalm, 119. 60.

5. Constantly, Psalm. 119. 20. I inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes
always, even unto the end, Psalm. 119. 112. Incipere multorum est, perseverate
paucorum. De virt. obed. Bern. Adscript. page 1715. Antuerp.
Many begin, few persevere. They that thus behave themselves to Gods Word and
Commandments, count not his Commandments grievous, but joyous.

V.
Lastly, Our true love to the Brethren, V.
the Children of God, for the heavenly Fathers sake who begat them; Evidenceth
our true love to God. Every one that loves him that begat, loves him also
that is begotten of him, 1 John 5. 1. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought
also to love one another. No man has seen God at any time. If we love one
another. God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us, 1 John 4. 11, 12.
If a man say, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he that
loves not his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not
seen? And this Commandment have we from him, that he that loves God, love his
brother also, 1 John 4. 20, 21. Who so has this worlds goods, and sees his
brother has need, and shuts up his bowels of compassion from him, how
dwells the love of God in him? 1 John 3. 17. In these passages are remarkable.

1. The evidencing of true brotherly love, by our true love to God in many
expressions.

2. The Grounds, why they that love God should love their brethren. 1. God has
commanded both these loves. 2. It Is easier to love our brother whom we have
seen, then God whom we have not seen: therefore he cannot be truly imagined to
love God, that loves not his brother. 3. Gods exemplary love; God has so loved
us! shall we not then love one another? 4. Gods Image is engraven upon his
chiidren; therefore if we truly love the Father, we cannot choose but love the
Fathers Image in his Children. Hence Dilectio habet duas alas. Ala dextra est
dilectio Dei: Sinistra ala est dilectio proximi. Nulius hominu^ cum una ala
poterit volare ad coelum. Quare? quia nec sola dilectio Dei sine dil^ctione
proximi, nec sola dilectio proximi sine dilect^one Dei valet ad consequendam
aeternam beatitudinem. Sum tibi has duas alas, viz. Dilect onem Dei, and
proximi, ut libere possis volare, bona operando; and pervenire ad partiam
coelestis regni. Bern. l. de modo been vivend. Sermon. 13, p. 1257, 1258.
Anteurp. 1616.
Bernard calls the love of God and of our Brethren, the two wings whereby the
soul flies up to heaven. Love has two wings, the right wing is the love of
God: the left wing is the love of our neighbor. No man can fly to heaven with
one wing. Why? because the love of God alone, without the love of our
neighbor, or of our neighbor alone, without the love of God, availes not for
attaining eternal happiness. Take thou both these wings, the love of God, and
of thy neighbor, that thou may fly freely in well-doing, and come to the
Country of the heavenly Kingdom.

Signs of true brotherly love; See in Cap. II. Sign. VII. p. 168, to p. 173.
and Cap. VIII. throughout.

CHAP. VII.
Evidences or Signs of our Fellowship and Communion with God and with Jesus
Christ.

I.
FIrst, The Holy Spirit of God and of I.
Jesus Christ given to us; is a clear evidence of our Communion with him.
Hereby we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit which he has given us, 1
John 3. 24. And again, Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us,
because he has given us of his Spirit, 1 John 4. 13. His abiding in us, His
dwelling in us, and ours in him, are metaphorical expressions, denoting the
sweet spiritual Communion betwixt God and us. For they that abide and dwell
with one another, have fellowship together; but they that abide and dwell in
one another, they have a more immediate and intimate Communion with one
another: And thus it is betwixt God and his people.

How do we know and discover this our Communion with God by his Spirit given
us?

Answ. His Spirit given us makes us know this many ways, viz.

1. As the inward, immediate, efficient cause of this Divine Communion with us.
For, (1.) God dwells in us by his Spirit, Ephesians. 2. 22. (2.) Christ supplies his
corporal absence from his Church by his Spirit, Ioh. 14. 15, 17, 25, 26. and
16. 7, 8.

2. As an Anointing teaching us all things, 1 John 2. 27. Revealing to us the
things given us of God, 1 Cor. 2. 12. And illuminating us with light to receive
them. Sometimes the Spirit evidences our fellowship with God, by such a clear,
bright and immediate Ray, that it wonderfully assures us hereof, John 14. 21,
22, 23.

3. As a witness with our spirits, Romans 8. 15, 16. And when the Spirit
testifies, (says Chrysostom: in Romans 8.
Chrysostom) what ambiguity remains?

4. As a Seal upon our hearts, Ephesians. 1. 13.

5. As the earnest, first fruits and handsel of our Adoption and endless
Communion with God in glory, Ephesians. 1. 14. Romans 8. 23.

6. Finally, As the original cause and root of all these spiritual fruits,
which are only found in them that have Communion with God, Gal. 5. 22, 23.

But by what signs or evidences may we know that the Spirit of God and Christ,
(which is one and the same, Romans 8. 9.) is given to us?

Answ. Hereof there are many discoveries. For if the Spirit of God be given us;
Then

1. We are, or have been effectually convinced by the Spirit of our own Natural
misery; and of Christ's Supernatural Al-sufficiency to remove it, John 16. 7, to
12.

2. We are washed and sanctified by the Spirit, 1 Cor. 6. 11. mortifying the
old man, vivifying the new man in us, Romans 8. 13, 11.

3. We are acted, guided, led by the Spirit of God, Romans 8. 14. That is to say,
(...) Oecumen. Comment. in Romans 8. 14
We make him the Guide and Governor of our whole life. As Oecumenius has well
interpreted in.

4. We mind the things of the Spirit, Romans 8. 5. Our Thoughts, Projects,
Contrivements, Ponderings, etc. do habitually fix here.

5. We bring forth the fruits of the Spirit. The Spirit cannot be barren, nor
bring forth bad fruit, Ephesians. 5. 9. Gal. 5. 22, 23.

6. We combat by the Spirit against the flesh, Galat. 5. 17.

7. We are strengthened for every good word and work, with might in the inner
man by the Spirit, Ephesians. 3. 16. Col. 1. 10, 11. And in particular by the Spirit
we are notably enabled unto prayer, against all our infirmities, Romans 8. 15,
26, 27.

II.
Secondly, The true abiding of the ancient Primitive Truth and Doctrine of II.
Christ in us: So that we are not carried aside to unsound new-fangle opinions;
notably discovers our Communion with God. Let that therefore abide in you:
which ye have heard from the beginning: If that which ye have heard from the
beginning shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son and in the
Father, 1 John 2. 22, 23, 24. That which ye have heard,] viz. that Doctrine,
that truth that has been preached to you. From the beginning,] viz. from the
beginning of the Doctrine of the Gospel by Christ, his Prophets and Apostles.
Non est attendendum quid alii ante nos fecerint, sed quid Christus, qui ante
omnes est faciendum praeceperit. Cypr.
We are not to heed what others have done or believed before us, but what
Christ has commanded us to do and believe who is before all. All novelties in
Doctrine are to be censured by primitive truths, and brought to the ancient
standard, [from ehe beginning it was not so,] for their regulation.

Now the abiding of the Primitive Doctrine of Christ in us, evidenceth our
conti^ance in Father and Son, and so our Communion with them. For, God is
truth, Deuteronomy. 32. 4. Christ is truth, John 14. 6. The Spirit is truth, 1 John 5.
6. Yea, God is absolutely the first truth, cause of all truth in the world:
therefore he that abides in truth which was from the beginning, truly and
sincerely has Communion with God, 2 John 9.

Signs of sincere abiding in the truth.

1. A Cordial love of the truth, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 10. Contrary those, 2 Timothy 4. 3, 4.

2. A conscientious care to do nothing against the truth, but any thing for the
truth, 2 Cor. 13. 8. 2 John 10, 11.

3. An earnest contending for the faith once delivered to the Saints, Jude 3.
Not for new up-start doctrines, and new coined opinions.

4. A bearing witness to the truth both verbally and really in worst of times,
and against greatest of dangers. As did Paul, Phil. 1. 17. The Angel of
Pergamus, Rev. 2. 13. yea, Jesus Christ himself bore witness to the truth to
the death, John 18. 37.

III.
Thirdly, True confessing that Jesus is III.
the Son of God, is an evidence that such have Communion with God. Whosoever
shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwells in him, and he in
God, John 4. 15.

Doubt. But how can this be? devils confessed Christ to be the Son of God, Mark
1. 24. Luke 4, 34, 41. yea, hypocrites may confess Christ, Matthew. 7. 22, 23.
yet neither hypocrites nor devils have, nor can have communion with God.

Answ. There Is a double confessing that Jesus is the Son of God, viz.

1. Dogmaticall, arising merely from the Assenting act of faith, that believes
the truth of Gods Record, or revealed Word touching Jesus Christ; that
Scripture is true, and that Jesus is the Son of God, the true Messiah
promised in the Scripture. Thus Devils and Hypocrites may confess Christ
formally, dogmatically, in words, Tit. 1. 16. and in opinion they know him,
Luke 4. 41. But this Assenting, knowing, or confessing of Christ, may be
without all Communion with God and Christ.

2. Fiducial, arising not only from the Assenting, but also from the Applying
act of faith: Confessing Christ with confidence, and trust in him for
salvation, thus hypocrites and devils cannot confess him, This is here meant.

He that fiducially thus confesses Jesus Christ,

1. He assents to the truth of all Gods Record touching Christ, 1 John 5. 10,
11.

2. He applies Christ to himself, rests and lives upon him according to that
Record, John 1. 11, 12. Gal. 2. 20. Peter (as was formerly noted out of See
this in Cap. 11. Sign. 4. p. 141 more fully.
Augustine,) confessed Christ, that be might embrace him: the devils confessed
him, that he might depart from them. It is one thing to confess Christ to
retain him; another to repel him. Notes of true Applying faith, See in Chap.
2. Sign. 2. p. 25, etc.

3. He confesses Christ thus applied, not only verbally in words, but really
in deeds also, Tit. 1. 16. Matthew. 7. 21. observes his Commandments. Hoc est
esse confessorem Domini, hoc est esse martyrem Christi, servare vocis suae
inviolatam circa omnia and solidam firmitatem; nec propter Dominum martyrem
fieri, and praecepta Domini destruere conari, etc. Cyprian. Epist. 25 sect. 3.
p. 57. Edit. Goulart. 1593.
This is (says Cyprian) to be a true Confessor of the Lord, this is to be a
Martyr of Christ, to keep the solid firmness of his truth inviolate in all
things: not to be a Martyr for the Lord, and endeavor to destroy the Precepts
of the Lord.

4. He confesses Christ, even unto sufferings and unto death, Acts 20. 23, 24.
and 21. 13. Revel. 2. 13. In this regard, Cyprian applauds the courage and
constancy of the Saints and Confessors of Christ in his time, Quid entm
gloriosius, quid ve felicius ulli hominum poterit ex divina dignatione
contingere, -- quam inter saevientia secularis potestatis varia and exquisita
tormenta, etiam extorto, and excruciato, and excarnificaro corpore, Christum
Dei Filium, etsi recedente, sed tamen libero spiritu confiteri? Cypr. Epist.
26. sect. 2. p. 59. Edit. Goulart. 1593.
That among the various and exquisite torments of the secular power, the body
being tortured, tormented and butchered, yet they confessed Christ with a free,
though a departing spirit.

IV.
Fourthly. Not doing or practicing of sin, IV.
is a sign of Communion with God. Whosoever abides in him, (there is Communion
with God,) sins not; whosoever sins has not seen him, neither known him.
-- He that commits sin, is of the devil, for the devil sins from the
beginning, 1 John 3. 6, 8. Consider now whether thou art a Practioner in sin.

Signs of doing or practicing of sin, as also what a vast difference there
is betwixt the sinning of the regenerate and the unregenerate; See in Chap. II.
Sign. III. p. ^9, to. 60.

V.
Fifthly, Unfeigned lobe to God, and dwelling therein, discovers to us our true
V.
Communion with God. And we have known and believed the love that God has to
us. God is love, and he that dwells in love, dwells in God, and God in him,
1 John 4. 16. God is love;] what more precious! He that dwells in love,
dwells in God;] what more gracious! and God in him,] what more glorious! Love
to God, is a Sign not only of Gods cohabitation with us, but of his and our
mutual inhabitation in one another, There Is Communion. Habitual dwelling in the
love of God, must needs be an indication of our Communion with God. For, 1. Our
true love to God denotes a Reciprocation of mutual affections betwixt God and
us; For we love him, because he first loved us, 1 John 4. 19. 2. Our true love
to God implies consequently, a Reciprocation of the genuine fruits and effects
of love mutually. God loves us, and redeems, calls, adopts, sanctifies
justifies, glorifies us; we love God, and trust in him, fear him, obey him,
etc. both these import spiritual communion with God.

Admirably speaks Charitas te domum Domini facit, and Dominum domum tibi.
Foelix artifex charitas, quae conditori fuo talem domum potens est fabricare.
Domus ista non constat ex caemento and latere, nec lapide, nec ligno, vel auro,
nec argento, vel lapide pretioso. Omne aurum excedit, argentum supereminet
universum. In ejus comparatione lapides pretiosi vilescunt, nil est quod valeat
comparari pulchritudini ejus and speciositari. Mel comparatum dulcedini ejus,
sic est quasi absynthium comparatum dulcedini mellis; omnia quae sunt,
quantumlibet pulchra, quantumlibet speciosa, in ejus comparatione, nec reputari
debent. -- In hac domo caeci lumen, claudi gressum, curvi rectitudinem, infirmi
sanitatem, mortui resurrectionem, cuncti qui intrant felicitatem accipiunt;
nullus miser in ea, in ea cuncti beati. Bern. in Coen. Dom. Sermon. 9. p. 1341.
Antuerp. 1616.
Bernard of this love and this communion. Love makes thee the house of the
Lord, and the Lord thine house. Love is an happy artificer, which can make such
an house for its Maker. This house consists not of lime and brick, nor stone
nor wood, nor gold, nor silver, nor precious stone. It surpasses all gold and
silver. Honey is but wormwood to its sweetness. -- In this house the blind
have sight, the lame walk, the crooked are made straight, the infirm have
health, the dead have Resurrection, and all enterers happiness.

But how may we know that we truly dwell in Gods love?

Answ. By these ensuing Signs, viz.

1. When we love God with an intensive love, viz. with all that is within us,
Luke 10. 27.

2. When we love God with a predominant love, that supereminently overcomes our
love to all other objects besides God, Psalm. 97. 10. Matthew. 10. 37. compared
with Luke 14. 26. Rev. 12. 11.

3. When we love him obedientially, so as willingly to do any thing at his
Command, John 14. 15, 21, 23. 1 John 5. 3. 2 Cor. 5. 14.

4. When we love him invincibly, so that our love cannot be quenched or
conquered: but we are ready to endure any thing for his glory, Cant. 8. 6, 7.
Acts 20. 23, 24. and 21. 13.

5. When we love him continually, (...). Ad incorruptibilitatem. Bez. Graecus
scholiastes perpetuum amorem intelligit. ut (...) positum sit, pro adverbio
(...), id est, percun^ter. Bez. Annot. in loc.
in incorruption, (as the Original signifies,) Ephesians. 6. 24. when our love is
like heart of Oak, or Cedar, will not worm eat, rot or putrefie, but constantly
persevere incorruptible.

VI.
Sixthly, Walking in light and not in darkness, evidenceth our Communion with
VI.
God. -- God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say that we have
fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth. But
if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with
another, [viz. God with us, and we with God.] And the blood of Jesus Christ,
his Son cleanses ne from all sin, 1 John. 1. 5, 6, 7.

There Is (1.) A darkness of gross ignorance and error, Ephesians. 4. 18. (2.) A
darkness of sinfulness, or sinful misery, Ephesians. 5. 8. Acts 26. 18. Habitually
to walk on in these, argues the want of Communion with God, who is purest light
without all darkness whatsoever. In vain for such to pretend they have
Communion with God.

Signs of walking in light, not in darkness.

1. When we are effectually translated from darkness to light. This is
presupposed; for till a man be brought from natural state of darkness, to a
supernatural state of light, there can be no walking in light, Acts 26. 18.
Col. 1. 13. Ephesians. 5. 8.

2. When we cast off the works of darkness, and put on the Armor of light,
Romans 13. 12, to the end. When we bring forth the (...) Quam lectionem in
Claromontano, and aliis duobus veteribus libris invenimus, ut and apud Syrum
Interpretem. Bez. Annot. in l^c.
fruit of light, (as some Original Greek Copies read it) Ephesians. 5. 9.

3. When we shun all fellowship with works of darkness in others, Ephesians. 5. 11.

4. When we hate not the light, as evil doers, but love it and come unto it,
that it may be manifest our deeds are wrought in God, ^ohn 3. 20, 21.

VII.
Seventhly, Walking as Christ (our chief VII.
Captain, Heb. 2. 10) walked, is a further discovery of our fellowship with
God and Christ. He that says he abides in him, ought himself also so to
walk even as he walked, 1 John 2. 6. To walk as Christ walked, is to imitate
Christ, to follow Christ; or as Oecumenius (...). Oecumen. com. in loc.
well expresses it; so to live and behave our selves in our life, as Christ
did. To rectify our life according to Christ's course. Christ's Videatur N. jus
divinum Regimin. Eccles. p. 18, 19. edit. 2.
actions were either, 1. Acts of divine power, as his miracles, turning water
into wine, John 2. 7, etc. walking on the sea, Mark. 6. 48, ^9. Raising the
dead, John 12. 1. Matthew 11. 5. Luke 7. 21, etc. 2. Acts of divine
Prerogative, Matthew. 21. 2, etc. 3 Acts Mediatory, as dying for his sheep, Ioh.
10. 15. Giving of the Spirit, Ioh. 20. 22. Acts 2. Appointing his own officers
in the Church, Ephesians. 4. 7, 10, 11. 4. Moral Acts, appertaining to the common
nature of sanctification, as Mat. 11. 29. Ephesians. 5. 2, 3, 25. Or at least
bottomed upon a moral consideration and ground, as in Ioh. 13. 14, 15.
According to these moral acts of Christ, we are to follow Christ, to walk as
Christ walked.

How did Christ walk? that we may know, whether we walk like him?

1. Christ walked most purely, holily, inoffensively, both before God and man,
Heb. 4. 15. and, 7. 26. Isa. 53. 9. Many took offense at Christ, Mat. 15. 12.
Mark 6. 3. but Christ gave them no offense. Thus should we walk, 1 Cor. 10. 32,
33. Act. 23. 1. and 24. 16. 1 These. 2 10, 11, 12.

2. Christ walked most humbly and meekly, Mat. 11. 28. Phil. 2. 5, 6, 7.

3. Christ walked most selfe-denyingly. Though he was rich, yet became poor
for our sakes, 2 Cor. 8. 9. If it be possible, let this cup pass from me, yet
not as I will, but as thou will, Mar. 14. 36.

4. Christ walked most zealously, Joh. 2. 15, 16, 17.

5. Christ walked most obedientially to his heavenly Father, Romans 5. 19. Ioh.
4. 34. Heb. 5. 8, 9. He became obedient to death, even the death of the Cross,
Phil. 2. 8. He was so obedient, [ut vitam perdidit, ne obedientiam perderet]
that he lost his life, that he might not lose his obedience. Vitae quoque ipse
salvator praetulit hanc virtutem [viz. obed.] Eligens magis anima^ ponere, quam
obedientiam non implere. Bern. de verb. Ecce nos reliq. p. 994. C.
Our Savior (said Bernard) preferred this virtue of obedience before his life,
choosing rather to lay down his life, then not to fulfill his obedience:

6. Christ walked most profitably, went about doing good, Act. 10. 38.

7. Walked most lovingly, tenderly, and compassionately toward poor sinners
to win them and save them, Luke 4. 18, 19, 20, 21. Mat. 12. 19, 20. and 11.
28, 29, 30. Luke 7. 37, to the end.

8. Christ walked most spiritually and heavenly. He lived on earth, as if he
had been still in heaven; Extracted heavenly contemplations, and spiritual
lessons, from all sorts of earthly objects and occasions presented before him,
John 4 10, etc. and, ver. 31, 32. and 6. 26, 27, etc. and 15. 1, etc.

Do thou thus walk as Christ walked? then have thou communion with God in
Christ.

VIII.
VIII. Keeping his Word and Commandments discovers our communion with VIII.
God. Whosoever keeps his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected.
Hereby know we that we are in him, 1 John 2. 5. And this is his Commandment,
that we should believe on the Name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one
another, as he gave us Commandment. And he that keeps his Commandments,
dwells in him, and he in him, 1 John 3. 23, 24.

Signs of true keeping his commandments, See in Chap. 2. Sign 6. p. 162, to
168. and, Chapter 6. Sign 4. p. 208, to 212.

Signs of true believing in Jesus Christ, See in Chap. 2. Sign 2. p. 23, to
29.

Signs of the brethrens true love to one another, See in chap. 2. Sign 7. p.
168, to 173. and, chap. 8. throughout.

IX.
Lastly, True brotherly love, is a sign of our Communion with God. For we love
our brethren for God in them, that begat them, 1 John 5. 1. we love God,
because he first loved us, 1 John 4. 19. And where there is mutual love betwixt
God and us, we have sweet communion with him. If we love one another, God
dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us, 1 John 4. 12.

Evidences of the truth of our brotherly love to one another, See in Chap. 2.
Sign 7. p. 168, to 173. and chap. 8. throughout.

CHAP. VIII.
Finally, Evidences or Signs of the unfeigned Quid valeat charitas, omnis
Scriptura commendat: sed nescio si alicubi amplius quam inista epistola
commendetur. Aug. in ep. Joan. Tra. (...).
love of the Brethren: (viz. the true children of God, begotten of him. Compare
1 John 4. 20, 21. with 1 John 5. 1, 2.)

I.
FIrst, True spiritual knowing of God. Beloved, let us love one another; for
love is of God: and every one that loves is borne of God, and knows God. He
that loves not knows not God; for God is love, 1 John 4. 7, 8.

Evidences of true knowledge of God, See in Chap. 5. throughout. p. 193, etc.

II.
Secondly, Sincere loving of God. Every one that loves him that begat, loves
him also that is is begotten of him. By this we know that we love the children
of God, when we love God. -- 1 John 5. 1, 2.

Evidences of our true love to God, See in Chap. 6. throughout, p. 200, etc.

III.
Thirdly, Right keeping of Gods Commandments. By this we know that we love the
children of God, when we love God and keep his Commandments. For this is the
love of God that we keep his Commandments, and his Commandments are not
grievous, 1 John 5. 2, (...).

Evidences of keeping Gods Commandments, See in Chap. 2. Sign 6. p. 162, to p.
168. and Chap. 6. Sign 4. p. 208, to 212.

IV.
Fourthly, Loving the Brethren peculiarly and especially in this notion or
respect, as they are begotten of God, and as they are thereby the children of
God. Every one that loves him that begat, loves him also that is begotten of
him. By this we know that we love the children of God, -- 1 John 5. 1, 2. See
this further cleared, p. 170, 171.

V.
Finally, When we love them, not verbally and complementally, but really and
sincerely. Opening tender bowels of Compassion to our brother in need: yea, if
the cause require, hazarding our dearest lives for the children of God. Hereby
perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us; and we ought
to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whosoever has this worlds good, and
sees his brother has need, and s^utteth up his bowels of compassion from him,
how dwells the love of God in him? My little children, let us not love in
word, neither in tongue, but in deed, and in truth. And hereby we know that we
are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him, 1 John 3. 16, 17, 18,
19.

Formal, verbal, complementall love to the brethren is vain, Iam. 2. 15, 16.
yea, abominable hypocrisy. Christ loved us really, when he so loved us as to
die for us: and Christ's real love to us, instructs us to like reality in our
love to one another. Here are three real demonstrations of our true brotherly
love mentioned. 1. Communicating to the brethrens necessities. 2. Laying down
our lives for them. 3. Approving our hearts sincerely to God in both. In the
first, (as Ecce unde incipit charita; si nondum es idoneus mori pro fratre: jam
idoneus esto da re de tuis facultatibus fratri. Aug. Expos. in Epist. Joan.
Tract. 5. -- Ergo hic incipit ista charitas fratris, ut de suis superfluis
tribuat egenti: Hinc exordium est charitatis. Hanc ita coeptam, si verbo Dei
and spe futurae vitae nutrietis, pervenie^ ad illam perfectionem, ut paratus
sis animam tuam ponere pro fratribus tuis. Aug. Expos. in Epist. Joan. Tract. 6.
Augustine notes) we have the Inchoation; In the second, the Perfection; In the
third, the Probation of our love to the brethren.

Examine now thine heart. Do thou with this reality love the brethren?

1. Do thou communicate to the Saints necessities? they are in wants,
straits, plunges, prisons, sicknesses dangers, death; thou have this worlds
good, wherewith thou might relieve them; are the bowels of thy compassion
now shut against them, or open to them? If shut, how dwells either the true love
of God, or of thy brother in thine heart? what thou withholdest from, or
impartest to Christ's members, Christ takes as done to himself, Matthew. 25. 35.
to the end. If thou will not do any thing for thy brothers sake, ^et do it (as
Q^i respectu fratris in Ecclesia non movetur, vel Christi contemplatione
moveatur: and qui non cogitat in labor, atque in egestate conservum, vel
Dominum cogitet in ipso illo quem despicit constitu tum. -- Demus Christo
vestimenta terrena, indumenta coelestia recepturi. Demus cibum and potum
secularem, cum Abraham, Isaac and Jacob ad convivium coeleste venturi. Cyp. de
Oper. and Elee mosynis. sect. 22. p. 357. edit. Goulart. 1593.
Cyprian urges it) for Christ's sake, give Christ earthly garments, that thou
may receive heavenly; give Christ temporal meat and drink, that with
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, thou may be admitted to the eternal banquet.

II. Art thou willing if need be, to lay down thy life for thy brother? He will
hardly shed his blood for his brother, that grudgeth to p^rt with this worlds
good for his brother. This (said Haec est perfectio charitatis: and major
omnino non potest inveniri, Aug. in ep. Joan. Tract. 6.
Augustine,) is the Perfection of love, and greater then this cannot be found.
Greater love then this has no ^an, then that a man lay down his life for his
friend, said Christ, John 15. 13. Romans 5. 7. and yet we ought to lay down our
lives for the brethren, 1 John 3. 16.

Quest. But in what cases may we hazard or lay down our lives for the brethren?

Resolut. To comprehend all such cases, is difficult. Some seem obvious.

1. A man may warrantably adventure his life if need require, for a multitude
of brethren; a Church; that they may be preserved from destruction, or edified
to salvation. Exodus 32. 31, 32. Romans 9. 1, 2, 3. Phil. 2. 17, 18.

2. A private Christian may adventure his life, for preservation of Publ^ck
Persons, Church* Officers, Ministers of the Gospel, of great and necessary use
to the Church of God. Thus Priscilla and Aquila for Paul's sake, even laid down
their necks, viz. hazzarded their lives to the uttermost, and thereby did great
service to all the Churches of the Gentiles, Romans 16. 3, 4.

3. One public Officer may hazard his life for another of more important
concernment in the Church. As Epaphroditus a Pastor of the Philippians for Paul
an Apostle, Phil. 2. 30.

4. One private Christian may hazard his life for the Spiritual and eternal
good of another; as Temporalem plane vitam suam pro aeterna vita proximi non
dubitabit Christianus amittere. Aug. de mendacio ad Consentium. l. c. 6.
Augustine has observed, for defense of his innocence and righteousness, for
encouragement and confirmation of his faith and graces, etc. This (as Oportet
enim quomodo Christus animam suam po^uit pro nobis, ita fieri pro eo and a
nobis: nec tantum pro ipso, imo etiam pro fratribus propter ipsum. Quod Joannes
docens, non est pro fratribus numerandum, sed moriendum potius pronuncia vit.
Tertull. de Fuga in Persecut. l. c. 12. p. 587. Franek. 1597.
Tertullian notes) is not so much to hazard life for the brethren for
themselves, as for the brethren for Christ.

III. Finally, Can thou in all this love, in giving to, or dying for thy
brethren approve thy heart sincerely unto God; that thou do or endurest thus
for them, from entire love to them, and not from vain glory, or ostentation?
As Potest esse manifestius opus quam tribuere pauperibus? Multi hoc jactantia
faciunt, non dilectione. Potest esse majus opus quam mori pro fratribus? and
hoc multi volunt putari facere jactantia nominis comparandi, non visceribus
dilectionis. Restat ut ille diligat fratrem, qui ante Deum ubi solus videt,
cordi suo persuadet, and interrogat cor suum an ve^e propter fratrum
dilectionem hoc faciat: and perhibet illi testimonium oculus qui penetrat cor.
quo homo attendere non potest. Aug. Expos. in epist. Joan. Tract. 6.
Augustine cautions, Possibly a man may give much, yea, give his body to death,
and yet want love, 1 Cor. 13. but can thou appeal to the heart-searching
God, and say, Lord, thou know I truly love thee, and all thine for thee, and
therefore I do, or endure this, for thee or them? Oh! if thus thou can assure
thy heart before him, then have thou confidence toward God, 1 John 3. 18, 19,
20, 21.
