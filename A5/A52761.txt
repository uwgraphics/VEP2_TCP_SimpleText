A MOST PITHY EXHORTATION DELIVERED In an Eloquent Oration to the watery
Generation aboard their Admiral at GRAVES-END, etc.
My true Trouts, as ever water wet,
I Have hungered and thirsted to lift up my voice like a Trumpet amongst you,
and to pour forth my spirit upon you; for ye are all flesh, and that is frail;
but I must teach your hands to war, and your fingers to fight: And that you may
the better remember my words, I mean to force them in with a malin-spike, e'ne
just as ye splice a Cable. I understand you are very willing already to
undertake this great work; and the better to encourage ye, I intend to clear
your consciences of all scruples that may seem to hinder your cheerfulness in
the business: Ye know, honest harb, I have been at New England, and am not now
to learn the difference between a dry Cabin, and a great storm; for my own
part, I had enough o'nt: I had cast the platform of this blessed deliverance,
which we now enjoy, in that sanctified soil, and could not rest till I came
home to put it in practice: Our work is now in the Finishers hands by Land, and
now we must pin our faiths upon your shoulders for our Sea success; it behooves
you therefore to stand to your tackling, for ye are to fight against
principalities and powers: That Reprobate, RUPERT (to give the Devil his due)
is able to fright ye all into an auger-hole; but bear up your heads stiffly,
do'nt ye run away like water-rats, stand to your pease-pottage lustily, there is
pork enough aboard to make brewis till ye eat and split again: 'Twould make a
man's teeth water to think of your good bouls of lob-lolly and fat poor-Jack
upon fish-daies. But enough of this ^ now to come to ye, as I told ye, having
cleared this point, I mean to handle the second part of my division in the same
tune: Ye know we have been long oppressed with that Arch-Traitor, the King
(they may thank my Council, or his head had been on to plot mischief against
the Saints to this day) but I think we are rid of him now, I was fain to
stablish the heart, and strengthen the hand of the cowardly Executioner, or
else the Fellow had melted into Malignancy, for fear of that Scarcrow sentence,
Touch not mine Anointed; but I hope it is better his head's of, then that this
generation of Prophets should have had any harm. Blades, I think ye are
sufficiently instructed in these state principles, I shall now come to ye in a
word of commendations; I could have spoke a few Latin sentences to ye, that has
all your good qualities stowed in a little room, but those was learnt in the
time of Egyptian bondage, only to have fitted me for a cringing Conformist; and
in this time of clear light and liberty, it is a language as detestable, as hard
to be understood: I must therefore tell ye at length, in words issuing from a
meek heart, that I love a tarpauling, for these four good qualities.

First, because they pray so fervently when they are in danger, though they
swear as devoutly when the storm's over; and truly however it appears, they
have the gift of the spirit in them, that they will take so much pains to pray
at all.

Secondarily, as for their Religion, so for their honest dealings; for I never
knew any man complain of them without a just cause, only the
Custom-house-waiters have winked at many of their pretty passages between ship
and shore.

Thirdly, for their ingenuity; for they are commonly as cunning horsons as can
be, and can overreach the Devil, or a Broker, the length of a hawser.

Fourthly, for their courage; for they will do more mischief with one
Demi-Culverin, then Cromwell can with a whole Troop of Dragoons; and one bottle
of strong water will make a ships gang do more execution, then 100 firelocks;
they will fight with all the Turks in Christendom, if they get them once between
wind and water: I know lads, you cannot choose but laugh to think what fine
sport there will be betwixt you and the Princes ships, 'twill be biscuit and
beverage to you to be together by the ears with them, and then some of ye may
see the wonders of the deep: I could speak nothing but (...) and crackers,
fireworks and grenades, murderers and brass basses, Cannons and confusion to
ye, to make ye in love with the thoughts of a sea fight (such a one as I never
saw, nor I hope never shall) but that I know you had rather hav't* then hear
on it: In the mean time, consider with your selves, and take comfort in it,
'twill be a godlier sea fight then that between your Ancestors and the Spanish
Armado. You have all the pillars of truth to support you in the Cause, and
those are as strong as can be established by Act of Parliament; and I hope you
have more grace then to build your faith upon any other foundation; for the
Scriptures, if they be not with us, they shall not seem to be against us; for I
believe your Ministers are not to learn how to stretch them home enough at sea,
as well as at land. Again consider, but what store of brave purchase there will
be instead of pay for you; for they say the Rebels are richly laden, and if you
can but escape knocks, and come off with credit. I Will get the Moderate
Intelligencer to canonize ye for brave fellows; and Harry Walker shall every
Friday write your Admirals names in Hebrew, that their fames may be read
backwards: For my own part, I am resolved to take half a score texts out of the
volume of your victories, and preach whole pulpits full of fire and smoke
against your adversaries, the wooden horse Cavaliery enough to make a Church
stink as bad as Paul's doors of horse piss. For your Admirals, they are all
men of valor, and love to defy danger as little as you do; only it will not
be fit that they should hazard their persons in the face of a fight; but it will
be more necessaay, that they go to Council in the Hold, whilst you bustle
above Decks: They are men of as good government as an Ordinance of Parliament
can make them, and I hope you will say, that can set all things to rights; or else
how could we have hit the way hither? I am confident you cannot but love them
for their sakes that sent them ye, and for my sake that commend them to ye; and
you know I do not use to praise honest men to their faces; they were begotten
by the Army, created by the Parliament, and dubbed by the right reverend
Committee of Derby-house, and I think all these are able to make four sea guls:
I doubt not but they will use ye as well as as they can find in their hearts; if ye
corrupt them to run away with you, you may chance venture a neck-cracking
together, if ere you be caught again. I think I have persuaded you to obey
every body that I think fit; and when you feel the fruits of my good council
working, I make no question but you will remember me when you go down into your
Kingdom: Yet know in the times when superstition and tyranny raged like the
raving of the waters, your consciences were chained from flying into your
faces, with two inseparable links of Allegiance and Supremacy, and you groaned
under the heavy weight of those oppressive burdens: Now ye are at ease, and
have free liberty to swear to be true to no body; for indeed oaths are profane,
and not fit for tender consciences, that can brook any thing but obedience to
their betters; a solemn engagement after the newest fashion, will best become
men of your reformed tempers, and that to be done without Book; for I know good
letters are too hard for your discretion, only when they are delivered to you
by word of mouth, you can swallow that will stick by the ribs; for you are men
of memory, or else how could so many Masters and Mates chaulk out their
observations for a whole voyage, without pen, ink, or paper? Pray send's news
when you are gone, whether ye sink or swim. For your Wifes, I hope the Army are
resolved to take care that they shall not catch cold in your absence; and for
your goods that you make prize on, you must consign them to your dear friends
of the Admiralty, who intend to put them out at interest to increase a common
stock against you come to fight with them. Now judge my Masters, if you have
not a gracious Parliament, and a charitable Army that intend to make the best
of you, and your Wifes, that they can. I shall say no more in this particular,
for I suppose you have faith enough in them to be saved harmless by them: I
shall only speak a word or two to the wiser sort amongst ye (which will be
enough a conscience to make ye all run horn-mad to do mischief) and that is
this, Be sure when you meet any of those rogues, that you tack about, and get
to lee-ward of them, and then you may pepper them with small shot; I know the
advantage of old, for a good device; for though I am now a fresh water
Chaplain, I can spit salt water sentences in your mouths, that will comfort
your stomachs in a morning fresh and fasting, as well as a dish of burnt
brandy-wine. For your ships, I think they are well rigged, or the Devil's in
them; you have as good beer aboard, as ever wet whistle; Colonel Pride can give
ye an account of more grains and hops spent in the brewing on it, then his belly
will hold. For pease to your pork, all the hogs in England cannot feed upon
better; and I think you love hogs should feed as well as you: or else how would
ye have pork fat enough to make your mouths ladder on both sides like a
washing-boul? Your beef will be so tender within this month you may suck it with
a quil, or the murrin was in it; for I am sure some of the Purvers for the Fleet
went over hedge and ditch to pick and choose good Cattle, and sometimes they
found the Countrymen had hid them in ditches and odd corners, and there they
lay as still as Loaches, for fear of being knocked of the head. For your bread, if
there be not store of maggots in it by this time, Harry Scobel shall draw up an
Ordinance to set your Baker on the pillory; for you know the sweetest Biscuit
will fill your mouths full of sirrop, and fatten your kidneys: I think the
Parliament has took as great care for your temporal food, as for your spiritual
diet, or else they would never have sent me hither to preach such crumbs of
comfort to ye; I hope you will love them; if you cannot love them for Gods sake,
love them for my sake; and if you cannot fight for them for their own sakes,
fight for your selves and be hanged, so ye do good any way: I am sure ye had
never more need to look about ye, for there is few enough that takes any care
for ye; your own wives are resolved and ye be such Cowards never to come,
they will never cry for ye, and your children will have more grace then to own ye
for Fathers, without ye prove your selves Cromwell's boys, and come off
gallantly. And now madcaps steer steady, starboard, for if the Ruffins chase ye
out of compass, they will make sherks meat on ye; I would have ye pick Ocum
enough, as you go out, for you will have work enough to stop leaks if e're ye meet
with your matches; and pray when ye lie in harbor, have your Fore-Castle
clear, that ye may cut cable upon any occasion, and then blow wind, run ship,
one suit of sails will do more service then twenty brasse-pieces; I think you
cannot say but I have ballanc't ye well with good docrements, and caulk'd ye
with good councels; and now it is time to turn you a drift; I have nothing more
to say to ye, but charge ye to remember to pray to the Parliament to prosper
your proceedings, and I Will give ye one of their last Declarations to use for a
Service Book; I hope this is Sermon enough for ye as long as ye live, if ye
make a good use on it: And so fare as well as ye can, for we had as good part
here, as in a worse place; I hope to see ye again, if not in a better place,
yet in another world; and so I leave you, I Will have this Speech printed and
sent down to ye very shortly, that ye may con it as perfect as your compass,
and then I shall be with you in spirit, though I be absent in the flesh.
