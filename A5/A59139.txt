For one Week 445671 06 03 For one Day 63667 06 07 For one Hour 2652 16 01 For
one Minute 44 04 03

Note, That in this Computation, there is allowed seven Days in a Week, and
four Weeks, or 28 Days to a Month, and thirteen of those Months to a Year,
consisting of 364 days, the odd day not reckoned.

And also you are to understand, that in all those Computations, every thing is
reckoned rather lower than higher in each Computation, as may appear in these
two Instances.

First, As to the number of People, which is computed at a Million in the
Cities of London and Westminster, and within the compass of the weekly Bills of
Mortality; but it is generally suppos to be a far greater number.

Secondly, There is computed only a thousand of Beeves spent weekly; but it is
rationally supposed that there are a great many more spent in a Week, which has
been plainly made out by some of the Tanners in Leaden Hall, that suppose that
one Week with another in the whole Year, there are bought 1500 raw Hides from
the Butchers in a Week, most of which are sold by London Butchers.

The same Method has been observed throughout the whole Hypothesis; for in a
thing of this nature, it is impossible to come to exactness in the Computation,
therefore it is better to reckon under than over: for you must note, that this
is but an Estimate made according to the best Informations that could be
collected from some of the best knowing Persons in every particular.

Wherein we may note in this Estimate the singular Providence of the Almighty,
to make such a wonderful Provision for the Support of such a prodigious number
of People, and to be supplied with plenty of all things for the Life of Man, in
such great and populous places as these two Cities are; which for these, and
all other of God's wonderful Providence, let us give to him all Praise, Honor
and Glory, now and for evermore. Amen.
