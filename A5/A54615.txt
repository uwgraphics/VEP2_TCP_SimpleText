A further Assertion of the Propositions concerning the Magnitude, etc. of
London, contained in two Essays in Political Arithmetic; mentioned in Philos.
Transact. Numb. 183; together with a Vindication of the said Essays from the
Objections of some Learned Persons of the French Nation, by Sr. W. Petty Knt.
R. S. S.
1. IT could not be expected that an Assertion of Londons being bigger than
Paris and Roven, or than Paris and Rome put together, and bigger than any City
of the World, should escape uncontradicted, and it is expected that I (if
continuing in that Persuasion) should make some Reply to these contradictions.

2. I begin with the Ingenious Author of the Novelles de la Republique des
Lettres, who says, that Rey in Persia is far bigger than London; for that in
the 6th. Century of Christianity (I suppose An. 550.) It had 15000, or rather
44 thousand Moschees or Mohammedan Temples. To which I reply, that I hope this
Objector is but in jest, for that Mahomet was not borne till about the Year
570, and had no Moschees till about 50 Years after.

3. The next is the excellent Monsieur Auzout from Rome, who is content, that
London, Westminster, and Southwark -- with the contiguous Housing may have as
many People as Paris and its Suburbs; and but faintly denies, that all the
Housing within the Bills, may have almost as many People as Paris and Roven,
but says that several Parishes inserted into these Bills, are distant from,
and not contiguous with London, and that Grant so understood it.

4. To which (as his main, if not only Objection) we answer. 1st. That the
London Bills appear in Grants Book to have been, since the Year 1636, as they
now are. 2. that about 50 Years since, 3 or 4 Parishes formerly distant, were
joined, by interposed Buildings, to the Bulk of the City, and therefore then
inserted into the Bills. 3. That since 50 Years the whole Buildings being more
than double, have perfected that Union, so as there is no House within the said
Bills, from which one may not call to some other House. 4. All this is
confirmed by Authority of the King and City, and so long Custom. 5. That there
are but three Parishes under any Color of this Exception, which are scarce a
two and fiftieth part of the whole.

5. Upon sight of Monsieur Auzouts large Letter, I made Remarques upon every
Paragraph thereof, but suppressing it (because it looked like a War against one
with whom I intended none, whereas in truth it was but a reconciling
Explication of some Doubts, and therefore) I have chosen the shorter and
sweeter way of answering Monsieur Auzout, as follows, viz.

Concerning the Number of People in London, as also in Paris, Roven, and Rome,
viz.
MOnsieur Auzout alleges an authentic Register, that there are 23223 Houses
in Paris, wherein do live above 80 thousand Families, and therefore supposing 3
Families to live in every of the said Houses one with another; the Number of
Families will be 81230; and Monsieur Auzout also allowing 6 Heads to each
Family, the utmost Number of People in Paris, according to Mr. Auzout's
Opinion, will be. 487680. The Medium of the Paris Burials was allowed by
Monsieur Auzout to be 19887, and that there dyed 3506 unnecessarily out of
L'Hotel Dieu, wherefore deducting the said last Number, the neat Standard for
Burials at Paris, will be 16381, so as the Number of People there, allowing but
one to Dye out of 30 (which is more advantageous to Paris than Monsieur Auzouts
Opinion of one to Dye out of 25) the Number of People at Paris will be 491430;
more than by Monsieur Auzouts last mentioned Account. 491430. The Medium of the
said two Paris Accounts is -- 488055. The Medium of the London Burialls is
23212, which Multiplied by 30 (as has been done for Paris) the Number of the
people there will be. 696360 The Number of Houses at London appears by the
Register to be 105315. Whereunto adding a 10th. part or 10531, as the least
Number of double Families that can be supposed in London, the total of
Families will be 115840: and allowing 6 Heads for each Family, as was done for
Paris, the total of the People at London will be. 695076. The Medium of the 2
last London Accounts is -- 695718. The People of Paris according to the
abovesaid Account is 488055. Of Roven according to Monsieur Auzouts utmost
Demand, 80000. 693055. Of Rome according to his own Report thereof. 125000. So
as there are more People at London, than at Paris, Roven, and Rome by 2663.
Memorandum, that the Parishes of Islington, Newington, and Hackney, for which
only there is any Color of Non-contiguity, is not a two and fiftieth part of
what is contained in the Bills of Mortality; and consequently London without
them, has more People than Paris and Roven put together, by 114284.

Several other Estimates, Viz.
I. That London alone is equal to Paris, Roven, and Rome, as aforesaid. II.
That London, Bristol, and Dublin are equal to Paris, Amsterdam, and Venice.
III. That London alone is to Amsterdam, Venice, and Roven, as 7 to 4. IV. That
London and Bristol are equal to any four Cities of France. V. That Dublin is
probably equal to the second best City, of any Kingdom or State in
Christendom. VI. That London, for ought appears, is the greatest City of the
World, but manifestly the greatest Emporium.
