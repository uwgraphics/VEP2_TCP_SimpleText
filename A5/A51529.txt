The Mourning-Cross: or, England's Lord have Mercy upon Us.
Containing The certain causes of Pestilential Diseases; With an Account of
several modern Plagues or Visitations in times past, as well in other Countries
as in the City of London; as also, The Number of those that then died, not
only of the Plague, but of all Diseases. Continued down to this present day,
August 29. 1665. To which is likewise added, A Necessary Prayer for this
Present Time.
IT is no doubt, that the corruption of the Air, together with uncleanly and
unwholesome keeping of dwelling, where many are pestred together; as also the
not observing to have fires private and publicly made, as well within houses
as without in the streets, at times when the Air is infected, are great
occasions to increase, corrupt, and produce pestilent Diseases. Neither can it
be denied, that the over-boldness of many pressing into infected places, and
the lewdness of others with sores upon them, presuming into the open Air, some
of wilfulness, but truly many of necessity, contaminateth and corrupts
diverse; as the Leprosy, the Pox, and sundry such unclean diseases do: as by
drinking, lying in company, and other such means, where pure complexions and
clean bloods are defiled with such as are putrified; and therefore carefully to
be avoided. But all these are accidental, and rather the effects then the
cause. For it plainly appears in the Book of Exodus, that when it pleased the
Almighty God to smite the Egyptians, the children of Israel were appointed to
dip Hyssop in the blood of the Paschal Lamb, and smite off that blood on the
outward posts of their doors, that when the Slayer came to destroy in one night
all the firstborn in Egypt, he might pass over the houses of Gods children. So
that it is plain, it was an Angel then sent to smite those cruel people with
the Pestilence.

London is situated as pleasantly as Sodom, and her sister Cities, before they
sunk, even for the same sins that we have committed: for the sin of Sodom
(says the Prophet Ezechiel) was pride, fullness of bread, and contempt of the
poor. That these sins reign in London, who can deny? To them add, Fullness of
Drink; for therein we exceed the ^^^tions, that within these fifty years we
hated for Drunkenness: And I doubt that unnameable sin of Sodomy is used in too
many places of the City. Yet London stands, and so God, grant with his mercy it
long may.

In the City called the Grand Caire, there is a Plague once every seven years,
which comes with such fierceness, that the most part of the people there do
die thereof: and diverse of them that remain alive, lose their eyesight with
the vapors and great heat which comes from the ground.

In the year 254. fifteen Provinces of the Roman Empire, were in a manner
consumed with the Pestilence.

In the yea^ 530. there dyed in Constantinople five thousand a day, and diverse
times ten thousand: and at that time, in some other parts of Greece, there were
not sufficient living men left to bury their dead.

And in the year 1569. there fell such a Plague in Constantinople, that there
dyed in six Months space, seven hundred thousand persons, and the year
following fell such a Famine, that a penny loaf of Bread of English money, was
worth a Crown of Gold: by reason whereof, the people dyed as fast then of the
Famine, as before of the Plague.

In the year 540. there began an Universal plague all over the that continued
50. years with great violence.

In the year 1348. in Paris in France, there dyed a hundred thousand people of
the Plague.

In the year 1359. so great a Pestilence there was in Italy, that there were
scarce ten left of a thousand.

In the year 1521. there dyed in Rome a 100000. of the Pestilence.

In the years 1576. and 77. in Millan, Padua and Venice, there fell a hundred
thousand in every City: and in Bohemia (being but a small Kingdom) there dyed
three hundred thousand the same time.

In the Reign of King Edward the third, there fell a very great Pestilence in
the East Indies, among the Tartarians, Saracens and Turks, which lasted the
space of seven years: through the fear whereof, many of the Heathens willingly
offered themselves to become Christians. And shortly after, by reason of
Passengers from one Province to another, the same Pestilence was dispersed in
many Christian-Kingdoms, and amongst other places ^rought into England; where
it was so forcible all over the Land, that not only Men, but also Beasts,
Birds and Fishes were smitten therewith, and sound dead with Botches upon them.
Also among men, the numbers that were left alive, were scarcely sufficient to
bury their dead. At which time, with the rest that then died of the Plague,
Henry Duke of Lancaster, Blanch Duchess of Lancaster, and the Earl of Warwick,
ended their lives. So that in one year, in a little plot of ground of thirteen
Acres compass, then called Spittle-croft, and now the Charter House, was buried
fifty thousand persons, besides all them that were buried in the Churchyards,
and diverse places in the fields. Yet our Visitations, though our sins exceed
have been more gentle.

It is to be observed, That from the 25. of December, 1602. unto the 22. of
December, 1603. there died of all Diseases, within London and the Liberties,
thirty eight thousand, two hundred, forty four; whereof of the Plague, thirty
thousand, five hundred seventy eight; and the next year following, London was
clear of that Infection, and then were all the Shires in England grievously
visited. Let the Country People especially, Note the Work of God. The
particular numbers in each year in London and the Liberties, of all Diseases,
are as follows.

A Necessary PRAYER for this Present Time.
O God of Glory, Lord of Power, Distributer of Vengeance, and yet the
favorable Physician of sick Souls and Bodies, look down upon thy sinful, yet
prostrate Servants, the People of the City of London; who are every where
Heart-struck with the Arrows of thy Angry Visitation: We have sinned, we have
sinned, we have grievously offended, and without thy Grace there is no Help,
being now shunned and despised, even of all the Country. People round about us;
for whom, notwithstanding, we earnestly Pray as for our selves: beseeching
thee, of thy unmeasurable Godness, not to look upon them according to their
Deserts, but to have Mercy on them and us, and stay thy Heavy Hand from them as
well as from us. O Lord, God of Mercy, be good to us, and look not upon our
sins: for if thou wayest the Offenses of Man, no Flesh shall stand before thee.
We have sinned, we confess, O Lord, we have sinned, there is no Righteousness
in us, nor any Help but thine. Oh then, let thy Angel stay his Hand, as he did
at thy Merciful Appointment, when David offending thee, saw the Sword over
Jerusalem. Let the Doors of our Hearts be sprinkled with the Blood of that
Immaculate Lamb, Christ Jesus, that the Slaver may pass by us, as he did when
the first Born in Egypt were smitten with the Pestilence. O God, thou can
slay and restore again, strike into Sickness, and give Health; for thou art
only a Savior. O God, the Maker of us all, look Mercifully on thy
Workmanship. O God, the Savior of us all, be an Intercessor to thy Father for
us. O God the Holy Ghost, the Comforter o^ us all, Inspire us with true
Repentance, that we may humbly seek, and suddenly find Mercy from the Holy
Trinity; one God in Unity, ever to be Honored, while Man has Breath, or
Creatures any Being. Have Mercy, O, God, have Mercy, O God: for to thee Mercy
belongs, which all true Repentants purchase in our Redeemer Jesus: in whose
Name we beseech thee to free us and our Brethren, from this fearful Visitation:
concluding these our requests with that absolute form of which he himself has
taught us, saying, Our Father which art in Heaven, etc.
