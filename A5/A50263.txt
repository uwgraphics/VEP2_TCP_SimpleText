TO THE READER.
FIrst, Learn this Book, together with a Testament of the newest Print, and
then the Bible; and as hard words are come at, seek in this Book how they are
divided, being they are set Alphabetically.

Secondly, Those that desire to write words according to the English Tongue,
should often write over words as they find them printed in Books, minding to
^bserve to divide them into Sillables, which will imprint them in the Memo^y)
and so by use, which is the Mother ^f Language, (as the School-man says) ^e
may come to be so perfected in true ^^lling, as may serve well enough for a
Shopkeeper or a Husbandman, without the Latin Tongue.

Thirdly, Those that desire to learn to write without a Master, let them with a
dry Pen, run over the writing Letters in this Book, learning to make (a) very
well, and the (b) and the rest of the twenty four small Letters before they
join them or make great Letters: Set the least all of a height; keep a Ruler
and piece of Lead, to make Lines to write on, and a sharp Penknife, and let
not the Ink be thick.

Fourthly, Those that desire to live and walk in the true Religion, must above
all outward Teachings, mind the Reproofs of the Spirit of Truth in their own
Hearts against all Sin and Evil, otherwise they will turn to the Right Hand, or
to the Left into evil. Isa. 30.20, 21. Genesis 6.3. John 3.19.

Fifthly, I have also added some necessary Questions wrought by Arithmetic,
(which some want) notwithstanding they may have learned several Rules in
Arithmetic, which I do believe will be acceptable to the Ingenious (and some
Masons and Carpenters) that are lovers of Geometry and Mathematical
Experiments, though I have written but little thereof in this Book,
endeavoring that it may be a small Volume.

And it is more commendable for men to spend their leisure time in such
harmless Studies than at idle sports and plays, knowing that for every idle
word we must give an account. Matthew. 12.36.

Lastly, Hoping that none will be offended, that I have given such short hints
of things: (according to my weak Understanding, yet intended for the good of
those that cannot purchase large Books.) Yet do I believe that these things in
this Book, will be kindly accepted by those that are not biassed with
Self-interest (more than the Public Good) for I seek no honor to my self
herein, but the good of others (that are kept in Ignorance;) for to God all
praise belongs, who gives true Wisdom to all those that ask it of him in his
fear, and they are most happy therein, that seek no Glory to themselves; for
unto God alone it does belong; for he is worthy to rule and reign in every
heart and Conscience (by his Grace therein) now and for ever, Amen.

I am a Lover Of all People, W. M.

Remember Man, that the Reproofs of Christ
For Sin in the Conscience, is the way
That leads to Life Eternal, if obeyed,
The everlasting blessed Day.

The figure next to the Right hand is always in the place of ones, as in the
Table is 4 ones, that is four.

The next is the place of tens, that is 6 tens or sixty.

The third place is hundreds, in this Table it is 7 hundred.

The fourth place is thousands, that is, 3 thousand 7 hundred sixty and 4.

The use of this Table. Example.

If a Wall be 13 foot high, find 13 foot in the first Column, and against it is
20 Foot 11 Inches, shows that 20 Foot and 11 Inches in the length, makes a
square Rod or Pole.

The first Column is the height in Feet.

The second and third are the length in Feet and Inches.

To reduce Wall-Measure into Standard-Measure, which is a Rod of 16 Foot square
upon the superficies, and 14 Inches or a Brick and a half thick;

Do thus:

First measure how many Rods you have upon the side of the Wall (as before) and
take that number, and multiply it by the number of the half Bricks that the
Wall is in thickness, and that product divide always by 3, and the Quotient
will show how many Rods of Standard-Measure is in the Wall.

If one Yard, Pound, Bushel, Load or Quart cost me so many pence, what will any
number of Yards, Pounds, etc. cost me?

Always multiply the number of Yards, etc. that you would buy, by the number of
pence that one Yard, etc. will cost, and the product will show the number of
pence that the whole will cost, the which divide by 12 to bring it into
shillings, and the shillings by 20 to see the pounds in the Quotient.

Proof.

If 112 pound cost 400 d, what will 1 l cost.

That is 3 d and four seven parts of a penny.

20 12 4 l s d q 30 17 3 2

That is 30 pounds, 17 shillings, 3 pence, 2 farthings; and the figures above
show that four farthings make a penny, 12 pennies make a shilling, and 20
shillings is a pound.

By the same Rule read the figures that follow.

For in Addition they show what you are to dote at, or carry to the next row;
as every 20 Grains must be carried to the place of Scruples (as one) and the
odd set down.

And in substraction they show what you are to borrow, if need be; so that
after you have learned to the Rule of Division, you may understand all the
Questions in this Book.

How to measure any parcel of Land small or great, by a Chain and the Rule of
Multiplication, which may be very useful for the new planter in America, the
way being in a pocket Book.
Suppose the length of a piece of Land be 9 Chains and 50 Links, the Breadth 6
Chains, 25 Links.

Note that the Chain is called Gunter's Chain, being 4 Poles in length, and is
divided into 100 Links, and at every ten Links is a brass Ring, price five or
six shillings.

Multiply the Chains and Links as whole numbers, and from the product always
cut off 5 figures next the Right hand, and those to the left hand are Acres.

^

a. r. p. That is 5 3 30 00000 100000 parts of a Pole.

Secondly, The remaining Figures that is cut off from the 5 Acres, must be
multiplied by 4, because so many Rood is in an Acre, and 5 figures cut off also
from that Product, and the other are Roods.

Lastly, Multiply the five figures, so cut off from the Roods by 40, because
there is 40 Pole in a Rood, and then cut off five figures from the last
product, and the Left hand figures are Poles, as in the Example appears.

Note, that if in your Lengths or Breadths the Links are under 10, add a Cipher
to the Left hand.

How to reduce any number of Chains and Links into feet.
^

That is 351 Feet, 12 parts; 597 Feet, 30 parts.

Always cut off 2 figures from the product, toward the Right hand, and they
are parts of 100, and them on the Left are feet.

That is 351 12/100 597 30/100

Note that if the number of Links be under 10, place a Cipher to the Left hand
as before.

To know how far it is to a Steeple or Tree, that you cannot measure to, by
reason of water or wood, etc.
Choose two places to stand in to see the same, as suppose 20 yards distant,
for which distance draw a Line on Paper, and divide it into 20 parts, then lay
the edge of a Quadrant at one standing, the Quadrant lying flat, to point to
the other standing, and mark how many degrees the sight of the Tree may cut, to
make an Angle, which mark at the end of the Line on the Paper, do so at the
other standing and bring it to the Paper: Lastly, draw both the Lines at length
till they touch each other, and that will show the distance in yards to be
measures by your first Line.

Note, that if the Tree be far distant, let your standings be the farther off
each other.

And for want of a Quadrant the square corner of a Board may serve, if it be
exact square at one corner.

If you are upon the Land, you may take the distance of a Ship at Sea, by two
standings as before: But if you are upon a Ship Mast at Sea, or upon a high
Tower near the Sea, then spy through the sights the Ship, observing how many
Degrees and Minutes makes the Angle, which note upon Paper, and let down into
the Sea a Line and Plummet the which Line measure into yards, and lay it down
also on Paper, by the Line of equal parts.

Note that the Angle at the water is a perfect square (as one should always be.)

Then draw your Lines to a point as before, so that by this Rule the ingenious
may find the distance of several Towns and Castles one from another, and also
their heights and breadths, though you cannot come at them by reason of Water
or an Enemy, etc.

Note, that if the Plummet cut one one quarter of your Quadrant on the right
side, in taking of sight, then twice the distance from your standing to the
bottom of the Tree is the height.

Or if it cut so much of the Left side then half the distance is the height.
Remember that the sight to the top of the Tree, must be as a straight Line to
the Ground; it may reach 6, 7, or 8 foot backward, if you stand upright to take
the sight.

How to read this Table.

Begin at the figure 2 in the second Line, and 2 in the first, and say 2 times
2 is four, 2 times 3 is 6, etc. Then begin at 3 in the third Line, saying 3
times 3 is 9, and 3 times 4 is 12, 3 times 5 is 15, and so to the end.

Multiply 20 by 5 ^

Thus the Cipher in the 20 set down under the Line, then 2 times 5 is 10, set
it down, so 5 times 20 is 100.

Multiply 69 by 87, set it thus. ^

Work thus:

Say 7 times 9 is 63, set down 3 and carry in mind 6, then 7 times 6 is 42 and
6 I bear in mind is 48, set down 8 and bear in mind 4, which 4 set down, having
no further to carry it.

Then say 8 times 9 is 72, set down 2 under 8, and carry 7, and work as the
other Line.

Lastly, add up the two Lines, saying 3, set it down, then 2 and 8 is 10, set
down a Cipher and carry 1, then 1 that I carried and 5 is 6 and 4 is 10, set
down a Cipher, and carry 1, saying 1 and 5 is 6.

Now by this Rule, a man with a Pole and a string, and a short Ladder, may ^n a
little time value a Wood, that he ^ay not sell any one Tree too dear, and ^et
it down in a Wood-Book as follows.

A Wood-Book for the sale of Timber.
First, Mark the Trees as you measure them with Stamps, as 1234567 89, etc.
(made of Iron for the purpose) and enter them in a Book, with the year and day
of the month, the owners name, and the Field or Wood wherein they grow; this
done, make a Column, one for the number of Trees, secondly for their lengths,
in the third their squares or number of Feet, and the last how sold, if you
will.

Having thus, by assistance, got al^ the chief into your book, you may sell
them according to the marks, if you do but send the buyer to see them, which
may prevent many words, as is no^ too much used in bargaining in these days.

A Friendly Advice.
If thou reads or hears any accusation against any people or person whatsoe^er,
be not hasty to judge, until thou ^ast read or heard the answer of the ac^used,
and then be still in thy mind, and let God's Witness in thy heart (which will
not consent to a Lie) be ^he judge in all things. Do so also before thou begins
any new work or any promise; so shall God be thy Guide, etc.

Of the unlawfulness of the Art of judicial Astrology, or Astrological
Predictions.
Being a few words taken out of a Book written by J. R. who once was a
Practitioner of Astrology, and Student in the Magic Art.

Says in Page 33.

Matthew. 6.26.10.29. The very Hairs of your Heads are all numbered. So that a
Sparrow cannot fall, nor a Hair of my Head perish without the good will and
pleasure of my heavenly Father. Wherefore we may plainly see, that God, the
living God, does govern all the World by his only Wisdom and Providence, so
that we see here is no place for the secundarian Intelligences of the
Astrologians, whereupon it is evidently to be seen, that their secundarian
Intelligences are only pernicious and superstitious Fables, whereby the
Astrologers are deluded by the Devil, in that they Idolize the Stars, and are
deceived in their Planetary Angels, who they think are the good Angels of God:
But the Astrologers, and all other that think those seven Angels which the
Astrologers call Planetary Angels, are good Angels, I say, if any man say, that
the said Angels are good, I say that all such are deluded; for whosoever says
that evil is good, the same is deluded; but Astrologers do call evil good, in
that they do affirm the Planetary Angels to be good Angels, the which said
Angels are Devils, as I said before: For because that no man can by Conjurations
cause the good Angels to appear in a visible Form at his will and pleasure: But
some man can cause the Planetary Angels to appear in a visible form at his Will
and pleasure, by Conjuration; therefore the Planetary Angels are not good
Angels.

Morover I say, that these seven Planetary Angels of the Astrologers are the
chief Agents for Conjurors, -- are seven Devils, which are also the Magicians
chief Agents in all Magical operations.

In Page the 30. -- For Mr. Lilly Critemini Avenazre says, that the names of
the Planetary Angels are (viz.) 1 Cassiel, 2 Zachariel, 3 Samael, 4 Michael, 5
Anael, 6 Raphael, 7 Gabriel.

Again in 31 Page. These seven Angels are thus by the Astrologers appropriate
unto the seven Planets (that is to say) unto Saturn Cassiel, unto Jupiter
Zachariel, unto Mars Samael, unto the Sun Michael, unto Venus Anael, unto
Mercury Raphael, unto the Moon Gabriel.

Page 35. Now the Devil makes out himself unto the Astrologers in a dark,
hidden way, that the Astrologers cannot see him, although he work continually
by him. Now then the way by which the Devil and the Astrologers do work
together, is briefly thus, (viz.) That the Astrologers superstitious regarding
of times, and their erecting of a Figure with their observing the Position of
the Stars in the said Figure, to this end, that so they might know the event of
particular things; I say, that this regarding of time, and erecting of a
Figure, with the observing of the Stars therein, to the end aforesaid, I say it
is nothing else but vain Ceremonies, whereby the Planetary Angels do come to
understand and know what it is the Astrologer would foretell, or what the thing
is, of which the Astrologer would predict and foretell the event thereof. So
then the Astrologer's Figure being thus erected, he does from thence conjecture
what shall be the event of the thing, for which the Figure was erected. Now the
Astrologer having thus delivered his Oracle, from thenceforth the Planetary
Angels do all that they are able (God permitting them) to bring to pass that
which the Astrologer did foretell. Now why the Devil does all this, it is to
this end, that so he may uphold and maintain his Kingdom of Darkness.

And Page 7.

-- The practice of it is unlawful, as it is to be seen in Deuteronomy. 18.12, 14.
Isa. 47.13, 14 Let now the Astrologeas, the Star-gazers, the monthly
Prognosticators stand up and save thee from these things which shall come upon
thee. Behold, they shall be as Stubble, the Fire shall burn them, they shall
not deliver themselves from the power of the Flame, etc.

Again the practice and Practitioners thereof are condemned.

Thus says the Lord, Learn not the way of the Heaven, and be not dismayed at
the signs of Heaven; for the Heathen are dismayed at them, Jer. 10.2.

Astrology is a vain and foolish Art, because, that the regarding of time,
without which Astrology cannot be practiced, is by, and in the Scripture
condemned for an Abomination, as it does appear in the 18 of Deuteronomy. and the 14
ver. which says thus, For these Nations which thou shall possess, hearkened
unto Observers of times, and unto Diviners: But as for thee, the Lord thy God
has not suffered thee so to do. And as you may see in the 12 verse in the same
Chapter, these words, (viz.) For all that do these things are an Abomination
unto the Lord: and because of these Abominations, the Lord thy God does drive
them out from before thee. Wherefore my beloved Countrymen, abandon these your
Astrological follies, which if you do not do, I proclaim from the Lord God,
that Destruction shall come upon you, which you shall not foresee by all your
Art of Astrology; and when it is upon you, then shall you behold your selves in
misery, but shall not be able to help your selves by all your Babilonish skill,
etc.

And Page 34.

I could have here set forth unto thy view the Magicians Figures, Circles, and
how these 7 Planetary Angels are to be called upon, and the whole Body of
Magic. And that the Planetary Angels will say unto the Magician, Pete quid
vis, etc. And resolve doubts: I could declare much of this Art, but shall
forbear; for I am appointed to destroy it.

And Page 3. G Carleton Bishop of Chichester, says, (viz.)

The first Invention of Astrology is by many learned men attributed to the
Devil; with whom agree the sayings of many ancient Writers, as Tertullian,
Clement, Alexandrinus and Lactantius, with others who shall be mentioned in
their proper places, (but for brevity sake, I shall only mention Augustine,) who
says, It is a great madness and folly to go about to tell by the Stars, the
manners, actions, and events of men, which, says he, true Christian Piety
expels and condemns. Vid. St. Aug. Lib. de Doc. Chr. Aug. Lib. de not.
Doemon.

Now I shall conclude in the Author's own words, page 36. Thus Reader, I will
here make an end, and if thou have any thing to say against me, because I have
denied Astrology to be a lawful Art, thou know where I have my abiding place:

J. R. Of the Borough of Chippingwickham in the County of Buckingham.

From Maryland in America, March 20. 1681.
THe dreadful Comet that appeared here, (without doubt) portends sad News to
all the Northern Hemisphere, that appeared here in November and December last,
etc. and I shall be glad to hear what our English Astrologers say of it; as
matters are represented to us here from England, old sores seem now to bleed
afresh, etc. I have no mind to see with my own Eyes, whether there be any
difference between 41 and 81, etc. This I took out of the Loyal Protestant
Intelligence (so called) of July 16. 1681. That would make as if the
Nonconformist Protestants were now of the same Spirit, that was in 41, by the
deceit of Astrology, when the Comet is only a warning to all People upon Earth,
that are workers of Iniquity, speedily to depart from it, else the Rod of God's
Judgment will come upon them. And a Plough-man can give as true a Judgment of
the Effects of a Comet, as an Astrologer; yet Princes and People may be
deceived by Astrological Judgment, and too many are. But as for Astronomy, or
the knowledge of the Stars motions, it may be no Snare to a Christian, if God
is in all his thoughts. Psalm. 10.4. 2 Cor. 10.5.

The Use of this Table.

If 423 l. be continued at Interest 6 years, after the rate of 6 l. per 100 l.
for a year Interest upon Interest, the Question is, what Principal and Interest
is to be received at the expiration of the said term?

Multiply 423 by the number against 6 years, and from the product cut off seven
Figures.

Example. ^

The Principal and Interest comes to l. s. d. q. 600 0 8 3

31 717920

What Annuity shall a man buy for 1200 l. ready Money for 27 years, after 6 l.
per Annum, Interest upon Interest for his Money.

Multiply the^^ number against 27, and from the Product cut off seven figures
to the Right hand, and the other are pounds.

Example. ^

The enclosed 8 in the first Product, is 8 prims, that is 16 s.

Here I find, that 1200 l. will purchase an Annuity of 90 l. 16 s. 8 d. for 27
years. do so with others.

Again.

A Merchant being indebted 1600 l. present pay, the Creditor is contented to
receive the same at 10 equal payments, the debtor allowing for the forbearance
after the rate of 6 l. per annum Interest upon Interest; the question is, what
those yearly payments ought to be?

Multiply the number against 10 in the last Table by 1600 the pounds, and work
as before. Note that Product is multiplied by 240 the pence in one pound.

Example. ^

Answer.

Every payment ought to be 217 l. 7 s. 9 d. the enclosed 3 is 6 shillings.

13 11 1 32 14 11 0

The Use of this Table.

Suppose a Lease to continue 10 years, and you would know how many years
purchase it is worth in ready Money.

Look in the Table for 10 years of a Lease to the Left hand, and against the
same you have 7 years Rent, and 4 Months rent, and 3 parts of a Months rent of
the said Lease (Let the rent be what it will) viz. 7 years is 70 l. and the 4
Months is 3 l. 6 s. 8 d. and 3/10 of a month is about 30 s. so added together
is about 73 l. 8 s. 8 d. ready Money of a Lease of 10 l. a year.

Again.

Suppose a Lease to be 30 years that you would buy, (let the Rent, as
aforesaid, he what it will.)

Look for 30 in the first Column, and against it is 13 years, 9 months, and
1/10 of a month purchase, or the Rent present possession.

But suppose there be a Lease of 5 years (more or less) before you commence
look in the Table against 5 years, and you find 4 years, 2 months 5/10
purchase, substract this out of the Sum against 30 viz. 13 9 2.

Example.

y. m. p. Years 30 13 9 2 Years 5 4 2 5 9 6 7

And so much is the Reversion after 5 years -- purchase worth the remainder of
30 years.

First, Draw it upon Paper, as before.

Secondly, Write the 12 Months in a long piece of Paper, every Month in the
same compass as March is writ in, in the Almanac, and cut between each double
Line to slip it through, that but one Month may be seen at a time.

Thirdly, Upon a long piece of Paper write the days of the week twice over at
length to slip as the other.

Lastly, Do so also for the year 1681, 1682, etc. and for the Kings Reign.

And at the bottom write the Explanation thus:

Explanation.

If the day of the Month begins on a Thursday, the next Thursday after is 8,
the next is 15, the next 22, etc.

The Friday is the 2d day of the month, the next Friday is the ninth, etc.

Or you may place them according as the Months and days are in the Scripture,
as the first Month (or March so called) second Month, etc and first day of the
week, or Sunday so called.

Vincent Wings Opinion concerning the Sun, Moon, and some Stars called Planets.
First, That the Sun is as fixed and the Stars called by him.

Saturn 25 Miles, Eeach of them wheels in a Minute. Venus 70 The Earth 60 Mars
48 Jupiter 26 Mercury 95 The Moon 32

Secondly, That the Sun gives both Light and Heat to all the Planetary Bodies
encircling him.

Thirdly, That the Moon retains the Earth for her Center, and the Earth would
seem like a Star at Saturn.

Fourthly, That the Sun and the fixed Stars shine with their own proper Light.

Fifthly, That the Earth is carried about the Sun, and the Moon about the Earth.

Sixthly, The thickness of the Earth is 6872 miles, its Compass 21600 miles the

The Use of this Table.

Cut marks in a Staff, for 10 parts, and when the Sun shines set it upright on
the Ground, and measure the Shadow into parts, and find them in the Table, and
the Figure above it at the top of the Table, tells you the hour of the day.

Deafness.
THe most common cause of Deafness in the Ears, comes of stop-age of Wax and
Dust in the Ears, that hardens against the Drum; therefore pick them not, but
have them well washed with a Syringe (with warm Beer and Water) at going to
bed, which I have proved, by helping above one hundred people, I do believe.
It Is good to drop into the Ear a night or two before they are cleansed, a
little Oil of bitter Almonds, or the Fat of a silver Eel, so called, if these
do not cure, try no further.

Urine, The signs thereof.
1. Red Urine signifies heat of the Blood. 2. White, rawness and indigestion
in the Stomach. 3. Thick, like puddle, excessive labor or sickness. 4. White
or red gravel in the bottom threatens the Stone in the Reins. 5. Black or
green, commonly death.
Scurvy, The signs thereof,
Is through a Melancholy humor; which makes the Gums swell and exulcerated,
loosening also the sinews and Teeth, the mouth stinketh, the Thighs and Legs
are often full of blew spots like bruises, the color pale, the feet are
swollen as in a Dropsy, and a pain in the soles of them,, and so will the
fingers ends sometimes.

Dropsy, The signs thereof.
There are three sorts through the coldness of the Liver.

1. The watery Dropsy, the Body is full of phlegmy blood, or oak Water between
the skin and the Flesh, and the Body does suck it up as a Sponge sucks up
Water; an ill color of the face. 2. Is wind and water, lying between the Guts
and the Stomach, the Body waxes lean. 3. If more wind than water, it is a
Timpany.
A good Diet Drink for all that are inclining to the Scurvey, or Dropsy, or
others, to be taken in the Spring and Fall.
Take Fumitory, green or dried, red Dock Roots, water Cresses, and common
Scurvy grass, of each one handful, Fennel Seed one Ounce, and half a peck of
Pippins sliced, boil all these half an hour in 10 Gallons of Water, strain it,
and add to the Water of Horseradish one handful sliced and bruised; Liquorish

The names of the Medicines that purges, Choler, Phlegm, watery and Melancholy
humors severally.

Peach leaves and Flowers, Damask Roses, blew violets, Cassia fistula, Citron,
Mirobalans, Prunes, Tamarinds, Rubarb, with red Dock roots, Rhapontick, Manna.

Purges Plegm gently, by Hysop, Hedge Hysop, Bastard Saffron Broom flowers,
Elder flowers, Myrobalans, Bellerick, Chebs and Emblicks, the seed of Bastard

Mechoacan, Orris, or Flower-de-luce Roots,

Melancholy purged gently by Senna, Fumitory, Dodder, Epithimum, Indian

Sowbread, Mezereon, Squils.

Melancholy by Hellebore white and black. Take none of these violent purges
alone, without a right Composition among others to correct them.

Purging, the manner and way thereof.
1. If the humors be to be drawn from remote parts of the Body, as the Head,
Arms, Feet, or the like, let the Purges be made up in a hard form, as Pills
are; for by that means it stays the longer in the Body, and is in all reason
therefore the better able to perform its Office.

2. If the afflicting humor lie in the Bowels, or near to those parts, use
liquid Medicines, for they operate speediest, and the Bowels are soon hurt by
purging Medicines; if the matter be tough and of long continuance, it is
impossible to carry it away all at once; therefore take gentle Purges, and take
them often; for strong Purges weaken Nature.

A good Purge.
Take Rubarb and Senna, of each i, Jallap i, Cream of Tartar and Anaseed of
each 16 grains, Ginger 10 Grains, all in powder, let them steep in a draught of
white Wine or water all night, in the morning drink the Liquor, and keep house,
and take posset drink as in other Purges; it is very safe for many distempers,
(taken as often as need shall require) this quantity is enough for a man or
Woman.

Of Man's Eye.
The Muscles of a man's Eye are six, which gives the motion with the Optic
Nerves ascending to the brain.

In the Eye there are three humors, as 1. Watery, 2. Glassy, 3. Christalline.

First, The Christalline humor is the sight, in the middle of a pretty hard
substance.

Second, The Glassy humor is seen behind, like melten Glass, softer than the
Chrystalline, and is five times bigger, and twice as big as the Watery humor,
it nourishes the Christalline.

Third, The Watery humor is behind the last, and thin; for it is sometimes
consumed in Diseases, and lost with wounds in the Eye. The Christalline is
nourished of the most lightful part of Seed.

The Hairs of the Eyelid being lost, the Party cannot see things afar off.

Those whose Ears stand out hear the best, and some are dull of hearing, by
lying hard upon their Ears, and also by Nurses binding them.

A tickling noise in the Ears, denotes a thin humor.

A stiff humor often hinders the hearing, then they want cleansing with a
Syringe, the way you may find in this Book.

To break an Impostume in the Ear.
Tie a thread to a piece of an Onion, and prick it full of holes when it is
broke, cleanse it with Basilicon, with Lint.

For a blew or gray Web in the Eye.
Take Thunderbolt Stone one part, and as much Ginger, and half as much as one
of these of Alum, and a little Loaf Sugar.

For a white Web put in Salt, for a Horse put to it Turmerack, and make it like
Salve, with butter, and put in a Pill twice a day into the end of his Eye, or
when his Eyes are thick with humors.

For the Pearl or Web in the Eye.
Take the juice or the distilled water of the herbs, Mouse-ear and half Moon
Grass, it may be made milder with Eye bright water or Sugar, drop into the Eye
a little twice a day, for two Months if need be.

Another.
Take the Juice of Celandine, Ground Ivy, and field Dasy, or let these be
distilled in May, etc.

After the smart is over, the Eye being dressed with Pouders, wash them with Eye
bright water mixed with snow water.

But if you cannot get these waters, then boil the juice of Houseleek in an Egg
shell with the white.

Eyes that are clogged with humors or filthy flesh.
Put into them three Lice, and lay on a Plaster of the white of an Egg, beaten
with Honey, upon Flax, all night.

Or every night put in a Seed or two of wild Clary, and lay to the wrests
Plasters of Burgundy Pitch, and also to back of the Neck and Temple patches of
the same, and read in no book quickly after Meat; Sunshine, the heat of Fire or
smoke not good for weak Eyes, except the Smoke of Tobacco.

Stifness of the Eyelids.
Anoint them at night with Deer Suet.

Bloodshot Eyes, and black bruises.
Boil Hysop and Wormwood together, and lay it on, or bruise them together.

Eye Salve, or Ointment of Tutty.
It cools and dries up salt and hot humors, that flow into the Eyes from the
heat of the brain, the Eye lids only being anointed at nights.

Is thus made.

Take Tutty prepared 2 ounces, Lapis Calaminaris 1 ounce, being in fine powder,
make it up with 1 pound and an half of the Ointment of Roses.

Now to prepare the Lapis Calaminaris, quench it six times in Plantane or Rose
water, with this water wash the Tutty, and let the Dirt run through a Cloth,
and make each into Balls for use.

And to make the Ointment of Roses, take fresh Hogs Grease cleansed one l.
fresh red Roses Buds half a pound, juice of the same three-ounces, on a gentle
fire make it into an Ointment.

If Dimness of Sight come from the brain,
Take a spoonful of blew Sows, called Wood-lice, wash them and stamp them, and
let them lie all night in Ale, strain it, and drink the Ale in the morning,
take the same quantity till thou art well.

Physic for the Poor.
Or an universal Medicine to be taken about the quantity of a Pease in a Pill
or Powder, drinking a draught of strong drink after it at going to Bed, for one
man or Woman, but less for Children. It purges by Sweat and Urine, causes ease
in sleep and sickness; it cures Agues, by getting into a sweat by one of them
half an hour before the fit is expected to come. I need not write but little of
it is Commendation, it being so well known by the name of Matthews his Pill,
which, if rightly prepared, is an excellent thing. I had it from one of my
Uncles who was a Chemist, who said he had it of a Servant of the said Matthews,
and therefore I commend it to all who are able, and well inclined, to do their
poor Neighbors good when in sickness, and may dwell far from an honest
Physician.

Take of the best white Tartar (or Lees of Wine) and Saltpeter, of each one
pound, make them together into fine powder, and put them in a well glassed pot,
that is upon hot Coals, stir them in the pot with a red hot Iron, until they
have done flaming, let it cool by degrees, and take it out and beat it into
fine powder, and put it into a wide mouth Glass, with one pint of the best oil
of Turpentine, stir it in the Glass once or twice a day pretty much, for two or
three weeks, the longer the better, and set it in a Seller, to moisten the Pill
when need is.

Then take of Corn poppy heads before they open, (but white Garden Poppy is the
best) a good quantity, beat them, and strain the juice into a well glassed
Platter, and let it stand in the Sun till it is as hard as wax. Take of this,
and Juniper berries, and Liquorish, of each one ounce, and black Hellebore and
Saffron a quarter of an ounce, (but instead of Poppy juice, you may take as
much Opium) make these into as fine powder as you can, and in a Mortar, with
the aforesaid mixture, work them like Dough for Bread, then knead it hard into
a wide mouth Glass and cover it with a Bladder, and it will keep many years.

Here may be Doses for about one thousand times, for little more than two
shillings charge, which an able and charitable Neighbor will not grudge to
have in store at all times for themselves and the Poor near them.

But if you are willing to make it of very great virtue, then add to it of the
best Chemical oil of Juniper Berries, and of Sulphur, of Antimony, of each one
ounce, which may cost, if rightly prepared, about ten shillings.

I have made this Pill about twenty years.

Put a little of this Pill into an aching Tooth.

A Purge for a Countryman,
Take Grunsel, Mallow, the herb Mercury, Endive and Succory, and Red dock
Roots, of each about a quarter of a handful, Fennel seed a little spoonful, and
a little Ginger, boil them in almost a quart of water to a little less than a
pint, strain it, and sweeten the Liquor, and drink it fasting, and now and then
drink Posset drink.

For Childrens sore Feet, that the skin is off with Chilblains.
If the Feet itch much with Chills and is hot; the best is to hold them to a
Fire, very hot, a quarter of an hour at a time, which allays the itching, and
keeps them from breaking; but if they are broke, and be as sore as can be, one
Plaster of Burgundy Pitch cures, if it do but stick, and it is very safe, lay
it on in the morning.

A Balsom to cure Burnings and Scaldings, Headache, the Temples and Nostrils
anointed, biting of a mad Dog; use nothing else in Wounds, Stitches and Pains
in the Sides being rubbed in and apply a Tobacco Leaf; for inward bruises, or
Ulcers in the Bladder or Kidneys, taken like Pills night and morning, etc.

It is made as follows.
Take Venice Turpentine washed in Rose water, one pound, oil Olive three pound,
yellow Wax one pound, then cut the wax, and melt it on the Fire, and put in the
Turpentine, Oil, and six spoonfuls of Sack, stir them till they begin to boil,
and take it off the Fire, and when it is cold, melt it again (the Sack being
from it) and put to it one ounce of Natural Balsom, price four or five
shillings, Oil of St. John's wort, and red Sanders in fine powder, of each one
ounce, give it a boil, and take it from the Fire, and stir it till its cold
almost.

Note, that the hotter you make this Balsom, when you apply it to wounds,
Burns, Inflammations, Ulcers, or Fistula's, the better it is.

Another.
Anoint with Linseed Oil, ground with white Lead, or Cerus, which is also good
for the chops and sores on Cows Teets, or others.

Bleeding at the Nose, etc.
Let the party sit upright, and stuff into the Nose Rabbets wool, which has
been rouled in fine Bole-armony and Dragons Blood, and sprinkle cold water in
his Face, and a cloth wet in Vinegar to the Forehead. Bleeding at the Nose in
the beginning of a Disease is a bad sign.

Philosopher's Stone, so called, something thereof.
Hermes, Plato, Aristotle, and other Philosophers, in former times, flourishing
the original Spring of Sciences, and the Inventors of Liberal Arts (so called)
earnestly approving the virtues of things under the Heavens, did enquire with
great desire, if any thing was amongst the Creatures, that might save Man's
Body from all Corruption, and preserve it alive for ever.

In which search (in vain) they wearied themselves, (by seeking that in the
Creature which is only in the Creator) calling it a Stone, or Medicine
extracted, or to be by them created out of Elementary things, that shall have
power of itself, to change melted Lead into fine Gold, and also to cure all
diseases in Man or Woman; and having not found such a thing, yet have found
many Secrets of Alchymy, as the Oils and Salts of Animals, Vegetables and
Minerals, etc. But their pretending to transmute or change the filing of Tin,
which they call Jupiter, into Silver, called Luna, and part of Coper called
Venus, into Gold, called by them Sol, put in Lime 24 hours in a flame, which
only makes them the more malleable or harder, though there is some Gold and
Silver both in Tin and Lead, of which some, it is to be feared, makes course
Silver of; and having not found such a thing (as I said before) and being
ashamed in themselves, (having spent so many years in toiling, cost, and study
in seeking) will not say they cannot, or have not found it; but have still led
others in the dark to search by their writings, as if they had known, or did
possess such a Stone, or secret, and that it would lose its virtue, if they
make it known to others. For

Says Morien, Who has it (that is this Stone) possesses all things, and
shall need the help of no body in any thing, because in it is all temporal
Felicity, corporal Health, and earthly prosperity. And further the Philosophers
says, that by this Stone or Spirit Moses made the Vessels of the Temple, and
the Tabernacle; Noah built the Ark; Esdras recovered the Law; Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob obtained length of days and abundance of Riches, etc.

This many do seek, (say they) but few do find it; for the defiled with vices
or polluted are unworthy to know such things: Therefore it is not shown but to
the devout, because it is incomparable to all prices, etc.

O how the Gentiles hearts have been darkened, and become vain in their
imaginations! Romans 1.21. (as at this day) to think to find that healing virtue
in the Life or virtue of earthly things; that is only in God's Spirit, Mal. 4.2.
Jer. 30.17.

For, says the Lord, if thou will diligently hearken, O Israel, unto the voice
of the Lord thy God, etc. Then will I put none of these diseases upon thee,
which I brought upon the Egyptians, etc. (notwithstanding the Astrologers say,
that the Planets cause Diseases either by Sympathy or Antipathy, as Mars
causes diseases in the head, etc. Venus deforms the Beauty of the Face by
Antipathy to Mars, etc. Isa. 3.24.) Both Riches and Honor come of the Lord. 1 Chronicles. 29. Psalm. 103.3.

For by Faith Noah being warned of God. -- prepared the Ark, by Faith Isaac
blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come, Heb. 11. Unto the pure all
things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing
pure. Tit. 1.15.

So that it was by Faith in God, that Noah, Moses, Isaac, and Jacob, and all
other the Righteous walked, (but not by Philosophy, or Astrology, or any other
created thing;) not like the Gentiles and Astrologers, who are become vain in
their Imaginations, Romans 1.21. and Observers of times, for which Sin the Lord
drove out the Canaanites out of their Land. Deuteronomy. 18.12, 14. Lev. 19.26.

Therefore what man of sense will believe, that all the Art of earthly men, can
procure one thing out of earthly things, that may be but as the quantity of a
pease, that shall have power (being put into a pound or two of melted Lead) to
change it into most fine Gold, or that this one thing shall have also power, as
an outward Medicine, to cure all diseases in the Bodies of the wicked, that
they may get strength to be wicked still.

But most happy is he, that above all searching, he seeks after, and waits
upon God, that he may give unto him that white Stone, and in it a new name
written, which no man knows, saving he that receives, Rev. 2.17. Now before
I conclude, I shall recite some of the words of two of these Philosophical
Writers, as Geber and Villa Nova.

Says Geber, For wheresoever we have spoken plainly, there we have said
nothing, but where under Riddles and Figures we have put something, there we
have hid the Truth.

Villa Nova says, The Alchymists of latter time, are for the most part
mockers, and whiles by Sophistications, they seek rather to seem wise than to
be, they deceive the yielders to them; but the ancients not profiting according
to their own Covetousness, have wrapped up this Art in Riddles, showing rather
their own Ignorance than Science, etc.

Ephesians. 5.11. And have no fellowship (says the Apostle) with the unfruitful
works of darkness; but rather reprove them, Ephesians. 4.17, 18.

Yet the word Philosophy has signified a love to Wisdom, and the way to holy
Living, and not vain and impracticable things. See Pythagoras his works; and
the Speech of Palamedes at his Execution, manifests, that some of them sought
after Righteousness: For, says he, I never hurt or injured any, but on the
contrary, have advantaged all that conversed with me, to my utmost ability,
communicating what good I could gratis, and not for gain.

O that all, called Christians, was but come so far into a righteous Life, as
this Palamedes! (who was called a Heathen, as his Speech declares,) then would
England be happy, and all other Nations.

Note, that if William Lilly, and the rest of the Astrologers, do not study to
be acquainted with the seven Planetary Angels of the Magicians, why did he
write thus? viz. For though Philosophy and Philosophers teach us, that Comets
have a matter, or Ethereal Substance, of which they are created, yet those
learned men, wanting Angelical conversation, are deceived.

Above all things (says he) let the Artist rather judge by the strength of his
reason, guided by Art, upon the Configurations of the Planets, than by ill
digested Aphorisms, etc.

Nor are the secundian Intelligences, viz. what Angel then governs, to be
omitted in Consideration for the judging of future Events, etc.

There is in the Art of Astrology, says ^^e, (which some ignorant persons are
pleased to villifie.) Arcanum quoddam equivalent, To prophecy, etc.

Woe to the rebellious Children, says the Lord, that take Counsel, but not of
me, and that cover with a covering, but not of my Spirit, that they may add sin
to sin, Isa. 30.1.9.6. Josh. 9.14.

But the most sure word of Prophecy is by Astrologers neglected. 2 Pet. 1.19.

Many also of them which used curious Arts, brought their Books together, and
burned them before all men; and they counted the price of them, and found it
fifty thousand pieces of Silver; so mightily grew the World of God, and
prevailed, Act. 19.19.20.

Of the right placing of points in Writing.
Comma, Semicolon; Colon: Period. Interrogation? Admiration! Continuation -
Perenthesis ()
A Comma is the most frequent point, and of least force, it is to be set when
the least stop of the voice is; as, But when the Husbandmen saw the Son, they
said among themselves, this is the Heir, come, let us kill him, etc.

When there is a stop somewhat bigger, set (;) or (:) as, They that would
destroy me, being mine Enemies wrongfully, are mighty: Then I restored, etc.

When the sense, and sentence is perfected and full, then write (.) as, Pray
without ceasing. In every thing give thanks. Quench not the Spirit.

After a Question asked, set this (?) as, Whose Ass have I taken? Whom have I
defrauded?

After a wondering, admiring, or crying out, set this point (!) as, O wretched
man that I am! O death where is thy sting!

When you must divide a word at the end of a Line, and with a part of it begin
the next Line; then at the end of the Line, where the first part of it is, you
are to set down this point (-) or when (by way of Elegancy) two or more words
are put in one, as, Self-love.

A Perenthesis is (.) when some words may be left out, and yet the sentence
perfect, as, I know that in me, (that is in my flesh) dwells no good thing.

Of the Globe of the Earth, the Pole-Stars, and some hints of Dialling.
THe Globe of the Earth on which we dwell, is supposed to be 2 third parts
water or Sea, and the other third part Land, and two third part inhabited.

Seeing the Earth and Water is compared to a Globe, or as a round Ball, being
in the Air by the wonderful work of God.

That it so remains, held up by Gods hand, only appears by what follows,
that is to say.

There is two fixed Stars, called the two Poles of the World; the North Pole,
and the South Pole, opposite one to the other, the Earth being in the middle,
or betwixt them, and a Line supposed to be held from the one to the other Star*

The Sun, Moon and Stars moves round them, and the Earth continually. The Sun
giving Light to one place of the Earth at all times The People in New England,
and New Jersey are rising out of Bed when we in England are at Dinner; so that
we differ six hours in time, the Sun making the day, etc.
for man's outward sight to guide him in outward things, and to refresh the
Earth, (as the Son of Righteousness, Christ Jesus, causes his Spiritual Light
to shine in the hearts of all men, to light them out of Darkness or Sin, Joh.
1.9. Luke 1.78.)

So that all earthly things presses to this Earth upon every part thereof to
the middle or Center, from whence they sprung.

Now to make it more plainly to appear.

Suppose, I draw a crooked line to represent some part of the Earth upon which
we dwell, in England, and extend a doted Line to see which of the two Stars or
Poles is above our dwelling, or Horizon, so called.



Now he that travels 60 miles Northwards, the North Star will be a degree
higher; or Southwards the contrary; but alters not to go Eastward, or
Westward directly; (and 360 of these degrees is round the Earth, or Globe, as
is supposed.)

This North Pole is elevated above our dwelling about 52 degrees 30 Minutes.

Therefore a man may travel until the South Pole seem to be over his head.

So being these two Stars are as fixed, they are of great help to those that go
over the Sea; together with the help of a needle, placed in the Sea-man's
Compass, which needle turning upon a point, will not be still, until it points
at one end to the Iron-Mines in the North, because of its being touched by a
Lodestone, that draws always toward the North, and the place to which they
are traveling to, if it bears South, or S.S.W. the Compass will show.

The height of the Pole in degrees and Minutes are taken by a Quadrant like
this Figure following, on which, Lines may be drawn to find the hour of the day.

quadrant

I have only placed the 12 hours' and by this Table following you may place the
rest.

A Table for the Latitude of 52 Degrees for the Quadrant.

Place the hour Lines by the Degrees on the Edge of the Quadrant, and to find
the hour of the day, place a Bead upon the string, and on the Edge of the
Quadrant is set M for March, next A for April, betwixt these two or any two
Months, that the time is when you would know the hour of the day, as suppose it
is the 15th of March, set the Head at the 25th, because the Month you must
suppose to begin on the 10th of each Month, then let the Sun shine through the
sights, and the Bead will show the hour of the day.

In Sun Dials, the Style, or straight wire, that shaddows every hour Line,
should point directly to each of these two Stars (like as the doted Line) which
if you can so place upon any flat or upright thing, you may with ease draw the
hour Lines by the shadow thereof at length, by another Sun Dial rightly placed,
when the Sun shines at any time of the year, or by a Clock, if it goes right
that day as you draw the Lines; Or do thus, to place a Style upon and upright
Wall, that is Southward.

Just at 12 a Clock, set one end of a stick against a Wall, and at the other
end let a Line and 2 Plummet hang, till the shadow of the stick and string hang
in a straight Line upon the Wall, (being held square wise) mark both ends of
the shadow, upon which place your style, that the distant of the lower end,
from the Wall, may be 37 Degrees, 3 Minutes, and draw the hour Lines as before,
and when the days are at the longest, you may add more hour Lines; set the
style square wise from the Wall.

The 37 Degrees, 30 Minutes must be taken from the Quadrant, for the height of
the Style, and ready to fasten upon the Shadow; if this style is placed upon a
Board, fastened to the South Wall, it will serve for a Northern Dial on the
other side of the Wall, turning the Style upside down, and draw the hour Lines
as before.

And Direct East or West Dials.
You may place the style as before, by setting a Board Southward by a Wall, to
find the place by a stick and Plummet, and take it away, as soon as you have
fastened the Style, from the Dial.

In making of Post Dials, you are to take 52 Degrees, 30 Minutes, the rest, or
other part of the Quadrunt, for the height of the style, being about the
Latitude of Bedford-shire, to stand thus: style

Set the style upright, and exactly North and South at 12 a Clock, and draw the
hour Lines as before.

But being that there are so many Books already printed concerning Dialling, I
shall forbear (at this time) to write any further thereof, that this Book also

To rate Town Taxes
Suppose A. has an Estate worth 35 pounds a year, pays 5 s. 10 d. to a
Subsidy or Tax, what shall B. pay, whose Estate is worth 100 pounds per Annum?

Answer, 16 s. 8 d.

If 35 l. pay 70 d., what shall 100. l..

the said Rate?

Reduce the 39 l. into farthings, and say:

If 900 l. give 37440 q., what 100 l. give? ^ the Answer

To measure Timber of three equal sides, being at the end like this Figure
following.
And one side is 16 Inches, and the doted Line, or perpendicular ten Inches.



Multiply half the doted Line, 5, into the base or one side, and that product
by 62, if it be the length in Inches, and the last product divide by 1728, the
Inches in one foot, as in round and square Timber measure, and the Quotient
shows the number of Feet.

To measure Timber, having 5, 6, or 7 equal sides.

First, To find the half of the arch Line A B C, divide the Line A C into four
equal parts, and set three of the parts from Z to K, and draw the doted Line K
Z, which suppose to be 18, and the whole 36.

Secondly, Multiply the half of the arch Line 18 by 14 the doted Line A to X,
the Center as if it had been half a Circle, and it gives 252 Inches.

The Line of equal parts is of great use in taking the plat of a Close in Paper.

The Line of Chords is of use for to take the height of a style in making o^
Sun-Dials, etc* somewhat there of in this Book*

Example.

Draw a Line at pleasure as A B from the point A, let it be required to make an
Angle of 40 Degrees, 20 Minutes.

First, Extend the Compasses upon the Line of Chords, from the beginning
thereof to 60 Degrees always, and with that extent set one foot upon the point
A, and with the other describe the doted Line D C, then with the Compasses take
40 Degrees, 20 Minutes, which is the quantity of the desired Angle.

Example.

the measurement of an angle

To take the plot of a Close by the Line of equal parts.

Measure the length of one hedge in Chains and Links or Poles, and the tenth
part of a Pole, and for every pole take one part from the Line and the tenth
part, and draw the length on Paper; do so with the next hedge, and to know how
to set these two hedges in their right place, make an Angle like the Figure
following, do so with the other part of the Close.

Measure this to find the Angle.



Two places only differing in Latitutde, to find their distance.
First, If the two places do differ only in Latitude, and lie both of them on
one side of the Equinoctial (in which the Sun is in, when the days and nights
are equal) you must substract the lesser Latitude from the greater, and the
remainder is the distance required. Or,

Secondly, But if the two places propounded, lie the one on the Northside the
Equinoctial, and the other on the Southside, then you are to add the two
Latitudes together, and the Sum will give their distance in Degrees and
Minutes, the which reduce into Miles, allowing 60 Minutes for 60 Miles.

The Latitude of places is known by a Table in some Almanacks.

Of Reduction.
l. multiplied by 20 are s. s. multiplied by 12 are d. d. multiplied by 4 are
q.
Of Division.
q. divided by 4 are d. d. divided by 12 are s. s. divided by 20 are l.
Example.

In 896 l. how many shillings, pence and farthings.

^

Proof.

In 860160 farthings, how many pence, shillings and pounds.

^

Pounds multiplied by 3 are Nobles, and the Nobles divided by 2 are Marks.
Pounds multiplied by 4 are Crowns. Pound weights divided by 112 are Hundreds.
Ounces divided by 16 are pounds. Inches divided by 12 are Feet. Minutes divided
by 60 are hours.
So minding the parts, you may reduce all sorts of measures or weights,
backward and forward, etc.

Of Division.
To divide 576 pounds amongst 4 men, set it in this manner.

^

BEgin thus, saying, how many times 4 can I have in 5. one time, (but if I
could not have taken 5 or the figure in that place out of the figure above,
then it should be set a place further, as under the 7) then set one in the
Quotient or crooked line, and say 1 time 4 is 4, take 4 from 5 and there rests
1, set one over the 5, and cancel the 4 and the 5, and the work stands thus.

^

Now the divisor 4 must be removed a place further, that is under the 7; then
say, how many times 4 can I have in 17, the figures above 4. I can have 4
times, then set 4 in the Quotient, and say, 4 times 4 is 16, take 16 from 17
and there rests 1, set the one over the 17, and cancel the 17, and the work
stands thus: ^

Lastly, there is one place more to set your Divisor, 4, that is under 6,
saying, how many times 4 can I have in 16? just 4 times, set 4 in the Quotient,
and say 4 times 4 is 16, take 16 from 16, and there remains nothing, and the
work is done, and stands thus.

^

By this Rule you may divide any number by one Figure; but to divide by 2, 3 or
4 Figures is harder.

I will give you one example, by which the ingenious may (by the practice of
the Pen) find out the rest.

Example.

Divide 288 l. amongst 16 men, set it down thus.

^

Saying, how many times 1 in two? (once) If I say twice, then I cannot take
twice 6 out of 8; then set one in the Quotient, and say 1 time 1 is 1, take 1
from 2 and there rests 1; set 1 over the 2, and cancel the 2: then one time 6
is 6, take 6 from 8 and there remains 2; set 2 over the 8, and cancel the 8,
and 1, and 6, and the work will stand thus.

^

Then remove the divisor 16, and say, how many times 1 in 12? I say, 8 times,
(but if I had said 9 times, I could not have taken 9 times 6 out of 38)
therefore set 8 in the Quotient saying, 8 times 1 is 8, take 8 from 12 and
there rests 4, set 4 over the 12, and cancel the 12.

Lastly say 8 times 6 is 48, take 48 from 48 and there remains none, or 8 from
8 and 4 from 4, and the work is done, and stands thus: ^

Note, that whereas you were to take 48 out of the Figures above; suppose you
had been to have taken 48 out of 56 above, you might borrow 10 to put to the 6,
as in Substraction, paying it as one in the next figure or figures to the Left
hand, as thus:

from 56 take 48 rests 08

To prove a Division Sum.
Multiply the Quotient by the Divisor, and the Product is the same with the
dividend, (if it be right) adding thereto the remainder, if any be.

Example.

^

To divide any number by 10, 100, 1000, etc.
Cut off so many Figures from the Right hand of your dividend, as there are
Ciphers in your Divisor, and the figures remaining toward the Left hand in
your dividend, is your Quotient.

Example.

^

How to measure a Wood by the help of a Quadrant, and measuring only round the
same.
FIrst, set up marks at each corner of the Wood, that three Marks may be seen
at once; then at one of these corners place a Stool, and lay the Quadrant flat
thereon, and take sight to two of the marks on each side, and mark upon Paper
the Degrees of the Angle, and measure to the said two marks in sight, and lay
them on the same Paper by the Line of equal part in this Book, do so at all the
other corners, till thou have closed up the Plot, or Wood, the which you may
with ease measure into Acres by the same Line of equal parts upon your Paper.

Example.

^

Note, that if your Quadrant be too little, join 2 Quadrants together, or do it
by a board, etc. for want of a plain Table.

So your plot upon the paper makes 3 Triangles, and to measure one of them,
multiply for one Triangle the longest doted Line, by half the middle doted
line, or perpendicular gives the content; work so the other two Triangles, and
add them together, and the work is done.

Of Longitude and Latitude.
1. THE Longitude of a place is the distance thereof, from the Fortunate
Islands beyond Portugal, which is called the Primary Meridian, from whence the
Longitude of all places upon the Earth, are numbered in the Equinoctial toward
the East.

2. The Equinoctial Circle is the middle distance between the two Poles, in
which the Sun is in about the 10th day of March, and the 10th day of September,
making the days and nights of equal length all over the world.

3. The Latitude of a place is the distance thereof from the Equinoctial
Circle, which is numbered in the Meridian toward one of the Poles, or the
height of the Pole above our Horizon or Dwelling.

To know whether water may be conveyed by a Pipe, laid under the Earth, from a
Pond or Fountain to your dwelling.
TAke a Staff or Pole, long enough, and set it upright in the water of the
Pond, and mark how many foot is above water; then set another Pole of the same
length at the place where you would have the Water conveyed, and at the top of
your first Staff or Pole, place the left Edge of a Quadrant, and through the
sights spy the top of the other Pole, and if the Plummet cut any Degrees, the
Water cannot be conveyed so as to run of it self through a Pipe.

The Use of the Table.

Suppose the length of a Close or furlong be 50 Poles, how many Poles and Feet
of 16 Feet to the Pole, is the breadth of an Acre.

Look for 50 in the first Column and against it is 3 Pole, 3 Feet, and a small
matter more to make an Acre: This Table is almost exact, but to do it by
Arithmetic is more exact.

Note that in one Acre is 160 square Poles.

A square Pole is 16 foot both ways or 272 square feet is in a Pole.

IN Arithmetic the four first and chief Rules are called, Addition,
Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.

First, Addition is the adding of two figures, or other numbers together, as 7
and 8 is 15, etc.

Example.

Suppose I have Apple Trees 136 Pear Trees 076 Cherry-Trees 107 Plumb-Trees 036
In all 355

To sum it up, begin at the lowest figure 6, saying, 6 and 7 is 13, and 6 is
19, and 6 makes 25, set down 5 at the bottom, and carry the 20 as 2; saying 2
as I carry and 3 is 5, and 7 is 12, and 3 is 15, set down the odd 5, and carry
the 10 (as before) saying 1 and 1 is 2, and 1 is 3, set it down, so the total
Sum is 355.

The second Rule, Substraction, is the taking of a less number out of a
greater, and to know what remains, as take 9 from 11, remains 2. Set it thus:
From 11 Take 9 Add. Remains 2 Proof. 11

Thirdly, Multiplication is the multiplying two numbers together, as 6 times 6
is 36, etc.

Example.

Multiplicand 6 Multiplier 6 Product. 36

Mark how these figures are called, and bear it in mind.

Fourth Rule.
Division is the finding of a less number in a greater, saying how many times 4
can I have in 17.

Answer, four times, and 1 remains, set it thus:

Example.

^

For proof, Multiply the Quotient 4 by the Divisor 4, and it is 16, and add the
remainder 1, makes 17 equal to the Dividend.

How to find numbers upon Gunters Line.
FIrst, it is figured thus, as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 to the middle, then 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 10 at the end.

To find 15 on the Line.

For 1 take the Figure 1, for 5 take 5 of the large Divisions, and that is the
point.

To find 134 on the Line.

For the figure 1, take the figure 1 on the Line, for 3 take 3 of the great
Divisions, and for 4 take 4 of the smallest Divisions.

Note, that the Figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 sometimes signify themselves alone,
sometimes 10 20 30, etc. sometimes 100 200 300 1000, etc.

Multiplication by the Line.
Multiply 5 by 7.

Set one foot of the Compasses in 1, and extend the other to 5 upwards, with
that extent place one foot in 7, and the other foot will fall upon 35, the
Product or Answer.

Division by the Line.
Divide 35 by 7, the proof of the last Question, therefore work backwards, thus:

As 7 is to 1, so is 35 to 5, the Quotient or Answer.

If 45 yards of Cloth cost 30 l. what will 84 yards cost. Which is,

As 45 to 30 l. so 84 to 56 l.

Extend the Compasses downwards, from 45 to 30, that extent will reach
downwards from 84 to 56 l. the price.

Those that desire to know more of this Rule, called also the Line of
Proportion, may buy a Book thereof written by William Leybern, price 1 s.

To reduce one sort of Coin or Money into another, of several Nations, as also
Measures and Weights.
Example,
In 2990 French Crowns of 6 s. the piece, how many pounds English.

Crowns. 2990 6 Shillings. 17940

^

Another.

In 798 l. how many Scottish Marks, of thirteen pence half penny the piece.

Reduce the 798 l. into half pence, and the Product divide by 27 (the number of
half pence in 13 d.) and the Quotient gives the Answer.

So may you reduce several other Coins, from one to another.

Note that by the same Rule you may also reduce several sort of weights, or
Measures, one into another, by reducing your Question into pounds or ounces,
etc. or your Measures into feet, inches, or Barley corns, etc. or into pints,
etc. and divide the Product by the number of Ounces, or Inches, or Pints, or
Else, etc. that is in the measures that you would reduce it into, (the dividend
and the divisor being both of one denomination) and the Quotient will show the
Answer.

Therefore to gain skill, be often trying with a Pen, which helps more than
much reading, and comparing one Rule to another, to see how they agree, or
differ, by the well perusing of the Table at the end of this Book, etc.

How to draw out upon Paper any great Letter, or other thing that is written or
printed upon Paper.
FIrst, Take a Board of about one foot square, or more, set it sloping like a
Desk, that the Light may come under it, in the middle thereof make a hole of
what bigness you please, and place a piece of Glass therein to lie even with
the Board, starch the edge with Paper, and it is ready for use.

Secondly, take your Copy and lay it on the Glass, and upon that a piece of
Paper, and pin them together at the corners, and then with a Pen you may draw
the Letter, etc. And so by use you may come to draw without a Glass.

Thirdly, if you desire to draw a great Letter or other thing, greater or less
than the Copy, draw cross Lines with black Lead of an equal distance upon the
Letter or Copy, (which you may rub out again with the crumbs of white Bread,)
like unto a harrow.

Then draw upon your Paper as many cross Lines, at equal Distance, according as
you would have your Letter in bigness, observing that you draw the parts of the
Letter C in each square that answers them in your Paper.

How to measure Board or Glass.
Suppose a Table or Board be 36 Inches wide, and 10 Foot long.

Extend the Compasses from 12 the Center upwards to 36, and that extent will
reach from 10 the Length to 30 foot the Answer.

This is called overboard Measure, being the breadth is above 10 Inches.

So reckon the great Divisions on the Rule.

Under board Measure is when the breadth is under 10 Inches wide.

Example

Extend from 12 the Center, to 9 the breadth downwards, that extent will reach
from 15 the Length downwards, to 11 Foot the Answer.

How to find the true square of a round Timber Stick.
Suppose it is 62 Inches about, extend always from 10 in the middle of the Rule
downwards to 62 the Compass, the same extent always take from 28 downwards,
will reach to 17 Inches the square.

How to find the number of Feet in a stick that is 17 Inches square, and 13
Foot long.
Extend from 17 the square to 12 always, that extent twice from 13 the length
downwards, will reach to 26 Foot, the Answer.

Or if the square be 24, and length 8 Foot, extend from 12 to 24 the square,
that extent will reach twice from 8 to 32 Foot Answer.

This is called over-Timber Measure.

Suppose a Board be five Inches and a wide, how much of that board will make a
foot.

Find the breadth in the first Column, and against it is 26 Inches, and 2 tenth
parts of an Inch to make a Foot.

Note, that when a Board or Timber is broader at one end than the other, add
the breadth at both ends together, and take the half thereof for the true
breadth or measure it exactly in the middle, and it is the same in a piece of
Land, that lies so, etc.

Take the 4th part of the Girth in Inches, and find it in the first Column, and
against it is the Feet, Inches, and tenth part of an Inch, that makes a Foot.

This Table and the next are as exact as the Carpenter's Rule, which measures
a round stick of Timber for 40 foot, that has 50 foot in it, or thereabout.

Add the breadth and thickness in Inches together, and take the half for the
square, which seek in the first Column, and against it is the Feet, Inches, and
10 part of an Inch, that make a foot.

The flatter the Timber is, the greater is the error; but if it be almost as
thick as it is wide, this way is well enough; for whereas the Carpenter's Rule
commonly measures square Timber for more than it is, and round Timber a great
deal less, because of allowance for Chips, as they say, which is most allowable
in Oak of any other.

For oulm, read earn.

THe Book, out of which I recited that part of Astrology in page 71 etc. has
been printed this 30 years, and no answer has yet been given thereto, by any,
as the Author (knows of) who is still living in Buckingham-shire.

Obj. It has been Objected unto me; saying, Why do thou write against
Astrology, seeing thou have taught some People something thereof?

Answer. In Answer to which, I must confess, I have been desirous after
knowledge (as most young men are) not considering (at that day) that there is
no true knowledge, but what is given only by Gods Spirit; and also not
considering that the Serpent is more subtle than all the Beastly nature of
Man, who begets desire in Peoples hearts after all the vanities that is to be
found in this world (still to uphold his Kingdom in their hearts) and things
unlawful to be sought after by any (but more especially Christians) this
Serpent, or roaring Lion, that seeks whom he can devour, or overwhelm in
vanity, or choke by the Love and cares of this world, etc. he saying to some,
ye shall be as Gods to predict things to come by me, etc. ye shall have the
Friendship, and the Glory of the world which I will give thee, if thou will
worship, or believe in me, etc. and so he keeps the minds of most men employed
in the many follies, and bewitching fancies, and cumbered about the many things
(as aforesaid) that they neglect the one thing needful (Gods Grace in their
hearts) which Grace if truly minded, the Devil could not overcome them by his
temptations (viz.) with the fading Glory of this world, etc. this Grace being
the Armor of a Christian) which has appeared to all men, Titus 2, 11*) which
is but one saving Grace (saying aside the School Divines, distinction of more
than one) for the least measure thereof (if kept to) will resist the Devil,
that he flies; for in it he has no part; and it is so joyous to the true
Christian, that for it, and by it, he does forsake the Devil and all his Works,
the vain Pomp, and Glory of the world, with all the covetous desires of the
same, the carnal desires of the Flesh, and not to follow, and be led by them.

The forsaking of these vices, makes a Christian; not the often saying, or
hearing, or reading them.

Therefore I praise God, who (by his Grace) has kept me, that by it, I soon
come to see the net, which the Devil spreads, to catch all the searchers into
the Astrological Art, etc. (by the golden bait of perishing Glory, but all have
found him a Liar (before Death) that have trusted to him) out of whose
mysterious Charms, there is no way to escape, but by applying the whole heart
(to Gods Grace aforesaid) in which the blood of Christ Jesus is witnessed that
cleanses from all Sin, yea, though thou have made a Covenant with Death and
Hell; the Lord will break it, if thou truly returns to his Grace (and go out no
more) for in it is the Pearl of great Price, and for which all the truly wise
Merchant Men will sell all (their fading Riches in Sensual-wisdom, Glory, and
Babilonish skill) to purchase, or obtain more and more thereof, from the hand
of God.

I was always against the practice of resolving of Horary questions (so
called) seeing People run to the Astrologers to be resolved in things (at this
day) as People did in former Ages, run to the Oracles of their Wooden-Gods,
When the Devil was dumb, at any time in the Wooden Gods (which they and the
heathen Oracles were ever since Christ's Offering, etc.) the Priests to keep the
people in Ignorance, put into them a man or men to speak (unknown to the
people) to resolve their doubts, etc. Dan. 3. Query. Has that man put away all
Idols, that performs a Worship made up, by men's invention, and does not perform
all the worship to the true God by the immediate Teachings and Leadings of Gods
Spirit, etc. John 4.24.
Athiest-like, as if they did believe that there is not a God in Israel to take
Counsel at; Woe to the Rebellious Children, says the Lord, that takes Counsel,
but not of me, etc, Isa. 30.1. Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their
Counsel from the Lord, and their works are in the Dark, and they say, who sees
us, and who knows us? Isai. 23.15. There are many devices in a man's heart,
nevertheless, the Counsel of the Lord, that shall stand, Pro. 19.21.

God Created the Day, etc. and God saw, that it was good, Genesis 1.5, 10.
Contrary to which our Astrological observers of Times, say, that there are 5,
6, 7, and sometimes more, evil, or unfortunate days in every month (that is to
say) every day, that the Moon is in Conjunction, square or opposition to the
two Stars, called Saturn, and Mars, saying, these are unfortunate days, full of
fears, in these days take no Journey, take no Physic, etc.

And when the Moon is Conjunction, etc. of the Star called Venus (which is two
or three times in a Month) such days, they say, are days of pleasure and
delight, etc.

Thus Reader have I shown thee a little of our Astrological Observers of Times
(in this Nation) and whether these things differ at all from the Observers of
Times mentioned by Moses, Deuteronomy. 18.14. saying unto the Children of Israel (viz)
and because of these abominations, the Lord thy God does drive them out before
thee, v. 12 (aforesaid)

Now let the witness, for the true, and living God in thine heart be the Judge,
and not the selfish and devilish Wisdom that reigns in som^men, that are so
wise to do evil, (as the saying is) can make a bad cause seem good; and a good
cause seem bad, if it stands not with their interest in the obtaining of
Earthly ends, etc.

Let Love be without dissimulation, abhor that which is evil, cleave to that
which is good, Romans 12.9.

The Astrologers will not own, that they follow the Magic Art, or going on
toward it, which nothing seems clearer, for people go to them to be resolved
in their doubts (as the Babilonians did to their Magicians as unto an Oracle,
and they know that they cannot resolve doubts infallibly by all the Art of
Astrology, without the help of the seven planetary Angels of the Magicians
(aforesaid) nor then neither (yet the Devil helps them most as to perform such
things (when God has given them up to hardness of heart (by often rebellion
against his good Spirit) for Lilly in one of his Almanacks, advises some
Students of Astrological, and Magical Books Printed in that Year, as also of
Sigils, Lamens, Images, and the Magic of the Ancients, etc. I hold (says he)
the present time capable of receiving, etc. you may perceive that in all their
Art, nor the Devil in any of the Magicians could foresee, the great dryness of
the Earth (which God was pleased to send this Year 1681 to show how soon he can
blast all, if people turn not from the evil of their ways (that Hay in less
than six weeks time, rose from ten shillings a Load to forty in some places,
and came to be plentiful, before the Summer was ended; therefore in God alone
let us trust, and in no Art of the Egyptians, for the Devil was a liar from the
beginning, and says G. Abbot, late Archbishop of Canterbury (so called) in a
description of the World, p. 115, 116, for in India, and all the Eastern parts,
so especially in this Country, their Noblemen, and Priests, and very many
people, do give themselves to all Arts of Divination, here were the great
Soothsayers, Enchanters, and Wisemen, as they call them, here were the first
Astrologians, which are so described and derided in the Scripture, it is
thought that a great reason whereof these Chaldeans were expert in the laudable
knowledge of Astronomy, was partly because the Country is so plain, that being
without hills, they might more fully and easily discover the whole face of the
Heaven, and partly because the old Fathers which lived so long, not only
before, but in some good part also after the flood of Noah, did dwell in or
near to these parts, and they by observation of their own, did find out, and
discover many things of the Heavenly Bodies, which they delivered as from hand
to hand to their posterity, but as Corruption does stain the best things, so in
process of time, the true Astronomy was defiled with superstitious Rules of
Astrology (which caused the Prophets Isaiah, and Jeremiah so bitterly to
inveigh against them.)

And then in their fabulosity they would report that they had in their Records
Observations for 2500 years, which must needs be a very great untruth, unless
we will qualify it, (as some have done) expounding their year, not of the
revolution of the Sun, but of the Moon, whose course is ended in the space of a
Month,

Quid enim iniquius, quam ut oderint homines quod ignorant, etiamsires meretur
odium? Tertul. Apologet.

The Lord frustrated the tokens of the Stars, and makes Diviners mad, that
turns wise men backward, and makes their knowledge foolish, Isa. 44.24, 25.

Fortune telling, by the Lines in the Hand, an Egyptian Folly.
THE Astrologers pretend, that they can prognosticate of the future happiness
or unhappiness of Nations, and also peoples good and evil fortune by the Stars,
or Host of Heaven; (which the Heathen worshipped as Gods.) And they also hold,
that the Bodies of Men, Beasts, Herbs, Metals, etc. are under the Planets
Government, and that we are to advise, or take Counsel of them (according to
their Astrological Aphorisms) when we gather Herbs, go to War, etc. 2 Samuel
5.19.

Can they yet say, that they do not adore or worship the Host of Heaven, as the
Heathen did? 2 Kin. 17.16.21.3. Act. 7.42. When the Lord has said, Jer. 10.2.
Learn not the way of the Heathen, etc. And do not the Astrologers also run into
Egyptian-darkness, by telling Peoples Fortunes by the Lines or Marks in their
Hands, (still going for Counsel, Isa. 30.1. to the Host of Heaven, like the
Heathen and Egyptians) saying, one Line in the hand, is the Line of Saturn,
another part they call the Mount of Jupiter, another of Mars, Sol, Venus, etc.
and so are leading People back into Egypt, and taking the Heathen Gods for
Leaders and Governers, as if man was altogether in a brutish State, and had
nothing of God manifest in him, Romans 1.19. though in God he is to live, move,
and have his Being, and know him to govern his whole heart and Soul; but not
moved, ruled and Governed by any of the heathen Gods: yet the Lights in the
firmament, to separate the day from the night (every Christian owns them in
their places) for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years, Genesis
1.14. as God has placed them in, in which they keep their places, in dividing
the day from the night, etc. though man has not kept his place, and we are not
to fear them, as having Dominion over us, Jer. 10.2. but the Lord God only who
made them; and still to admire his wonderful works in the Creation: But to be
brief, (says W. S.) But if this Mount (that is, the Mount of Venus so, called
by him in the hand) be infortunated by evil Lines, or Lines from evil places,
and irregular figures, shows a Lecherous person, an Adulterer, a poor, base,
sordid wretch, who shall spend his substance on Whores, etc. Now if the
Fortune Tellers gives this judgment on such a person, by the Lines aforesaid,
and is really such a person; will not this judgment by the Lines, more harden
his heart through this Idolatrous belief, that he may have by these Lines
aforesaid, that may cause him to say, this is my fortune, I cannot help it, God
has so made me? etc. and so remains in Darkness and Error. Oh! What will they
make man to be! (whom God has created in his Image, 1 Cor. 11.7.) A Beast,
nay, of some men they liken to be created worse than a Beast, to be born with
such evil marks upon his hand; these marks happen but to some, say they; but
this blind belief happens to too many, that believe that the Stars, and the
said marks in the hand, show the whole course of men's lives. And further, says
he, Therefore it behooves the industrious and studious Artist not to determine
all things at first sight, (that is of the hand;) for no man can attain the
knowledge of all particulars at one Inspection; but yearly to make new
Observations, as the person increases in age. See W. Salmon of Chiromancy, who
for proof quotes Job 37.7. by the new Translation, viz. He seals up the hand
of every man, that all men may know his work. But in the old Translation I find
it is, With the force of the Rein he shuts men up, and all men may know his
work: (mark the difference.)

Now blessed be the Lord, the living God, that has unvailed to many this gross
Babylonish and Egyptian Spirit of Darkness, (that by its sensual Wisdom) would
draw people to trust to a Reed of Egypt, (Jer. 17.5.) which turns the truth
of God into a lie, and worshippeth and serves the Creature, forsaking the
Creator, which is blessed for ever. Romans 1.25.

Behold, you trust in lying words that cannot profit. Jer. 7.8.

Concerning a Soothsayer, or Augurer, that pretends to know things to come by
the flying of Birds.
THe Rabbis speak in this wise: He is a Soothsayer, who will say, because a
morsel of Bread is falln out of his Mouth, or his staff out of his hand, or his
Son called him back, or a Crow crooked unto him, or a Goat passed by him, or a
Serpent was toward his Right hand, or a Fox on his Left hand, therefore he will
say, do not this or that to day: These words are used, Genesis 30.27. I have
learned Experience, (says Laban) that the Lord has blessed me for thy sake.
Again, Genesis 44.5. Is not this the Cup in which my Lord drinks? and whereby he
divineth? That is, proves or makes trial or experience what manner of men ye
are. The Heathen people were very superstitious in these observations; some
days they counted unlucky, others lucky, (as our Astrologers do now) some
unfortunate to begin Battle, and some days unfortunate to marry: and as they
were superstitious in observing unlucky signs, (as they called them) so
likewise in the means used to avert the evil portended: The means were either
words or deads; thus if an unlucky bird (so called) or such like came in their
way, they would fling stones at it: And of this sort is the scratching of a
suspected Witch, which (at this day) amongst the simpler sort of people, is
thought to be a means to cure Witchcraft. By words also they thought to prevent
the evil signified by such signs, when they say, This evil light on thine own
head. Vid. apud Theophrast. Character. and D. Kinchien radic.

My people ask Counsel at their stocks, and their Staff teaches them: for the
Spirit of Fornication has caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring
from under their God. Hos. 4.12. Ezekiel. 21.21. Lev. 18.26, 31. Eccles. 24.5, 6,
7.

The manner of the Moons Eclipse.
THe word Eclipse, is as much as to say, as to want light, and to be darkened,
or in part hidden from our sight.

When the Sun and Moon are opposite one to the other, diametrically, and the
Earth in the very midst between both, that is, when a right line drawn from the
center of the Sun, to the center of the Moon, passing through the Center of the
Earth, for the Body of the Earth, and water being thick, and not transparent,
casting his shadow to that point, which is opposite to the place of the Sun,
will not suffer the Moon to receive any light from the Sun, from whence she
borrows her light (as the Astronomers write.)

And note, that every time she is at the full, she is opposite to the Sun, and
yet the Earth is not at every such full, diametrically betwixt her and the Sun,
for then she should be Eclipsed at every full, which indeed cannot be, unless
she be either in the head or tail of the Dragon so called, being (two opposite
places in the Skies, or Heavens.

Now the Moon is Eclipsed in part, when the Sun, the Earth and the Moon be met
in one self diametral line, but the Moon is declining either on the one side,
or the other.

But note, that the Eclipses of the Moon may be universal, because the Earth is
far bigger than the Moon, and thereby able to shadow the whole Body.

The manner of the Suns Eclipse.
THe Eclipse of the Sun is when the Moon is betwixt the Sun and the Earth,
which chances in a conjunction* or new of the Moon, and yet not in every
con^unction, but when it falls in one of the two opposite parts of Heaven
called the head or tail of the Dragon, which may chance (as is said before)
either totally, or in part, totally in respect of those parts of the Earth
whereon the Shadow directly falls, for seeing the Moon is far less than the
Earth, she cannot shadow all the Earth, and therefore the Eclipse of the Sun
cannot be universal, but yet to some part of the Earth, it may be total or
dark, to some partly, and to others nothing at all.

Add the Hours and Minutes right against each Haven, to the Moons coming to the
South, and the whole result will be the time of the Tide, or high water. By
this Table you may see what point of the compass the Moon is in, at the time of
the Tide, or full Sea.

The Moons coming to the South is found in an Almanac.

The Characters of the seven Planets.
Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus, Mercury, Luna.
The Characters of the 12 Signs.
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagitarius,
Capricornus, Aquarius, Pisces.
To find what sign the Sun or Moon is in.
What sign is the Sun in the 6th day of September, 1681. First find the day of
the month by an Almanac, and right against it is 24 d. 0 m. in, the Moon at
the same time is in 17 d. 25 m. in. Do so another time.

Circles of the Sphere.
Note, that the aforesaid 12 signs in the Zodiac, (so called,) are only as a
supposed Circle or Circles, divided into 12 equal parts, (in the Firmament)
whose breadth is about 23 d. 30. m. on each side of the equinoctial Line
toward the two Pole Stars; the whole Circumference (or round the World) of
this Circle, is 360 Degrees, and every Degree upon the Earth is 60 miles.

Secondly, Every one of these 12 Signs are divided into 30 Degrees, and every
Degree into 60 Minutes, etc.

Thirdly, The outmost side of this Circle, or Circles, toward the North Pole,
is called the Tropic of Cancer, (one of the said 12 signs) the which when the
Sun is in (about the 11th of June) the days are at the longest.

Fourthly, And the other side of this Circle, next the South Pole, is called
the Tropic of Capricorn, the which when the Sun is in, (about the 11 of
December) the days are at the shortest.

Fifthly, In the middle of this Circle, or Circles, or Zodiac, may be said to
be the equinoctial Line, into which when the Sun comes, (about the 10 of
March, and the 10th of September) the days and nights are equal throughout the
World.

Lastly, The Sun is a whole year in passing through all these signs, and the
Moon in one Month; and that neither of them come so near the two Pole Stars, as
60 Degrees, which makes that the Earth is so very cold against them, as in
Greenland, so called, where there is Ice all the year, being only inhabited by
wild Beasts and Fowls in abundance.

Signs of Rain.
1. SUn rising seems bigger. 2. Sun rising with a Circle. 3. Setting in a black
Cloud. 4. Sun or Moon looking pale. 5. Sky red in the morning. 6. Often change
of the Wind. 7. No dew morning or night. 8. Many small Clouds North West at
Evening. 9. Wind long in the South. 10. Few Stars seen. 11. Moons Horns thick
at rising. 12. Stars seem bigger. 13. Many Stars and Wind East in Summer.
Signs of fair Weather.
1. The Sun looks bright. 2. Mists in the Water. 3. Rainbow after Rain.
Signs of Frost.
1. Many Stars, and the Wind East.
Signs of Wind.
1. Sun and Moon look red. 2. Sky red in the morning. 3. Murmuring of Wind in
the woods. 4. Shooting of Stars. 5. A Circle about the Moon at the Full.
These Signs of the Weather are not so fallible as Astrological Predictions.

And People sometimes are saying, we want Rain, and sometimes fair weather, all
signs fail. Oh! But the greatest want is the want of Obedience to the Talent or
measure of Gods Grace in every heart, that would lead People, into Temperance
in all things, in fruitful seasons, and out of that mind, that seldom thinks
that they have Apparel, Meat, Drink, and Furniture good enough, and that makes
waste of any of Gods good Creatures (as too many do) when the poor wants) Jacob
vowed, that if God will be with him, and will keep him in the way that he goes,
and will give him bread to eat, and raiment to put on, he will give the tenth
unto the Lord, Genesis 28.20, 22. Even ^o will the seed of Jacob at this day, give
the Tenths, or more, if need be, of the increase of God^ Bl^ssings upon their
outward Estate, unto the Lord, that is, unto the poor, and Fatherless, and
Widows, that wants relief, Mat. 25.40. 2 Cor. 9.7.
So that now, if it shall please God to cause a Famine, it is but just upon
many, who regard not, nor lay to heart the many warnings and threatening
Judgments (that hangs over our heads) which God has showed to many, in the
midst of many Mercies,) yet but few regard with their whole heart, to seek
after Righteousness by departing from iniquity in the fear of the Lord; because
Sin is the chief cause of sorrow, that comes upon Man and Beast, and makes the
Earth to mourn.

Oh, that People should still resist the strivings of Gods good Spirit, as in
every Age! Genesis 6.3. that would lead them out of all evil into favor with God,
Deuteronomy. 28.2, 3, 4, 5. Are people willing to forget, that the sins of the people
have in all ages brought Gods Judgments upon them? Which makes the Righteous
rejoice, because many will learn Righteousness when Gods Judgments are in the
Earth, Isa 26.9. Though the Righteous (in some outward things) bear a share of
the Judgment, yet have they true Content, Peace, and Joy, being redeemed from
the Earth, and all vis^ble things so as to set their hearts upon them. 1 Kin.

An Image, called, The Rood of Grace.
IN the beginning of the Reformation (in King Henry 8th's time) one Cromwell was
greatly in favor with the King, and was made one of his Privy Council, etc. He
brought to light and suppressed many Popish Idolatrous Images, and other
superstitions of the Church of Rome, for which they sought his death, which the
King afterward lamented, etc. One Rood of Grace or Image, wherein a man stood
enclosed with a hundred Wires within the Rood, to make the Image goggle its
Eyes, nod its head, hang the Lip, move and shake its Jaws, according to the
value of the gift offered; if it were a small piece of Silver, then would he
hang a frowning Lip, if it were a piece of Gold, then should his Jaws go
merrily: Thus were poor peoples Souls seduced, and their Pockets picked by
these Idolatrous forgers, until Cromwell caused the said Image to be carried
publicly to Paul's (in London,) where the People tore it in pieces.

Then in Queen Mary's time (Daughter to the said King Henry the 8th,) Bishop
Bonner put out a Mandate to the Priests within his Diocese, commanding, that
comely Roods or Images should be again set up in all Churches, etc. the same
injunction was published in other Diocesses; for at Cockram in Lancashire, the
Parishioners and Wardens had agreed with a Carver to make them a Rood, to set
up in their Church, at a certain price, which the Carver did; but the Rood
being made of an ugly grim Countenance, they disliked it, and refused to pay
the Workman that made it, whereupon by Warrant he brought them before the Mayor
of Lancaster, who was a favourer of the Protestants, and a man against Idols;
when they came before the Mayor, he asked them why they did not pay the man
according to their agreement; they replied, they did not like the grimness of
its Visage; saying, they had a man formerly with a handsome Face, and they
would have had such another now. Well, said the Mayor, though you like not the
Rood, the poor man's labor has been never the less, and it is pity he should
lose; but I tell you what you shall do, pay him the Money you promised him, and
if it will not serve you for a God, you may make a Devil of it, at which they
laughed, and so departed.

How pleasant Pictures become Idols in the Heart.
AN Image, or Idol, says Paul, 1 Cor. 8.4. is nothing, etc. that is, it is
nothing to thee; but if thou set it in thy Heart, and affectionate it, (or any
other Picture,) thou bows to it, and this is Idolatry. Thou shall make thee no
graven Image (says God,) neither any similitude of things that are in Heaven
above, neither that are in the Earth beneath, nor that are in the Waters under
the Earth; thou shall not bow down to them, etc. Exodus 20.4, 5. Though we make
them, say some people, we do not bow to them, or worship them, Answer. If thou
art covetous after them, and have inordinate affection to them, thou have set
them in thy heart, and this is Idolatry, Ezekiel. 14.2. Col. 3.5. And worships,
and serves the Creatures more than the Creator, etc. Romans 1.25. Set your
affections on things above, not on things on the Earth, Col. 3.2. My Son, give
me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways, Prove. 23.26. So that he
that has given his heart to God, his affections will not be set upon liknesses,
for so his mind may be drawn from God who is to have the whole heart. We may
read, that the Heathens did wonderfully adore the likenesses of things, etc.
(yet being no example to a Christian, whose heart and Treasure is only in God,
and the Lust of the Eye cannot bewitch him) For, says W. Salmon, in his Book
of Drawing, Painting, etc. page 244. this imitation of the Life gave the
Artizan fame, which fame quickened his aspiring thoughts, adding more fuel to
the Flames, till such time as he brought forth a most absolute work, whereby he
conceived a joy, content and satisfaction (mark that) as durable as the work it
self, upon which he now conceived himself a happy man, and through a just
affrance of his Virtues, knows himself to be lifted up above the reach of Envy,
where he stands secure of his fame, enjoying in this life (as if he were now
consecrated unto Eternity) the Veneration that is like to follow him after his
Death; thus an honest emulation, and confidence, bringing forth works of
general applause, procures unto its Author an everlasting glory (then not
given only to God) Again in Page 246, says he, Berosus excelled in Astrology,
wherefore the Athenians, for his divine Prognostications, (mark that) erected
him a Statue with a Golden Tongue, set up in their public Schools, as Pliny
says, lib. 7. cap. 37. Public Libraries were furnished also with golden,
silver and brass Images of such, whose immortal Souls did speak in those
places. The provocation of Vices have also augmented the Art; (mark that,) it
has been (pleasing) to engrave wanton Lusts upon their cups, and to drink in
Ribauldry and Abominations, as Pliny says in the Proem. of his 33. Book.

(Are these things good to be dedicated to a Nation professing Christianity?)

And this Author goes on, and tells us how the Ancients depicted their Gods, as
Saturn, Jupiter, etc. Diana, Juno, Neptune, etc. In the greatest imaginary
Glory, to bespeak their fame, etc. when all these things and the pleasant
Pictures, with all the Babyloni^h rubish, are for the fire of Gods wrath, that
draw the heart from God. And it is great pity, that the Author (whom God has
given so much Wisdom) should rake in this Heathenish and Babylonish rubish, etc.

And though God once commanded Moses to make some things under the Law, who
has he commanded, in this Gospel time, to imitate or make the likeness of any
thing, that may so affectionate the Heart, as to draw it from God to commit
Idolatry?

And also though God (to show his wonderful works) has made variety of Colors
in the Flowers, Herbs, etc. It is no part of Christianity to deck or cloth
our selves in imitation of the colors of Flowers, or to make the likeness of
any of them, to so affectionate the Heart, as to forget the giver, or take any
Glory to our selves, in drawing the likeness of them (as aforesaid) as some
have done; but rather give all Glory unto God, admiring his wonderful power in
creating these Flowers, Herbs, etc. for the use of Man.

Lastly, Have thou made any likeness, or pleasant Picture of Religion for
others to imitate? or set up any spiritual Gift (given thee of God) above Gods
Spirit in thy heart? and do administer it unto others, without the immediate
leadings of the same Spirit? Thou have set up an Idol in thine heart.

1 John. 5.21. Little Children, keep your selves from Idols. Amen. If any shall
yet deny, that there is an Idolizing of Pictures and graven Images, [whereby the
Lord has not the whole Heart,] I shall for proof recite some more words out of
the aforesaid Author's Book, of painting, graving, etc. in page 232, 233, 246,
253, 262. (says he) And therefore those that would profit much, must take care
and pains to furnish their minds with all sorts of useful Images and Ideas. And
Proclus says If you take a man brought forth by nature, and another by art of
carving, that by nature shall not seem the statelier, because Art does many
things more exactly: [ Where Is God's Glory? W. M.] To which Ovid assents, when
he says, that Pygmalion did carve the Snow-white Image of Ivory, with such a
happy dexterity, that it was altogether impossible that such a Woman should be
born. [ Are not all things possible with God? W. M.] The estimation of the
Artists were also understood from the esteem and high rates their works were
prized at. A Picture of Bularchus a Painter, was valued at its weight in Gold,
etc. Caesar paid to Timomachus Eighty Talents of Gold (about 14000 pounds
Sterling) for the Pictures of Ajax and Medea. Many more examples we might
produce (says he) but these may suffice; at length no price was thought equal
to their worth, etc. [ Was not this Idolizing them? W. M.] Great minded men are
most of all given to entertain stately conceits; therefore (says he) an
Artizan (or Artist) ought to be of a magnanimous Nature, if not, yet at least
he ought with a determined resolution to aim at magnificent things. So it seems
that Nature did dispose Nicophanes to a high strain of Invention: Nicophanes
(says Pliny, Lib. 35. Cap. 10.) was gallant and neat, so that he did paint
Antiquities for eternity, (mark that) whereby he was commended for the
magnificence of his work, and gravity of his Art. Such Artificers therefore as
do bring any thing to perfection, must be of an exceeding great Spirit, [ then
not poor in Spirit, Matthew. 5.] and entertain upon every occasion great
thoughts, and lofty imaginations, ( Isa. 2.8, 11.) by this means they shall
gain everlasting Fame, etc. (mark that.)

Lastly, A good invention affects the mind, true proportion draws the Eyes,
lively motion moves the Soul. ( Is not then God forgotten? W. M.) exquisite
colors beguile the fantasy, and an orderly disposition wonderfully charms
all the senses; (Here Is a joy, but not in God,) if all these unite and center
in one piece, how great an excellence and perfection will appear? what a comely
Grace? This Grace it is which in beautiful bodies is the Life of the beauty,
and without which its greatest accomplishments cannot please the beholder: [
Grace in the heart is the greatest perfection of Beauty. W. M.] The Image or
Teraphim which Michal put in the Bed, 1 Samuel: 19.13. was a complete Statue, or
Image of a man. The use of such Images (says T. ^.) was to consult with them
as with Oracles, concerning things for the present unknown, or future to come.
To this purpose they were made by Astrologers, under certain constellations
capable of heavenly Influences, whereby they were enabled to speak. The Idols
have spoken vainly, Zec. 10.2. Vid. Aben. Esra, Genesis 31. And among other
Reasons why Rachel stole away her Fathers Images, this is thought to be one;
that Laban might not by consulting with these Images discover what way Jacob
took in his flight. Genesis 31.19. And it is said, that Zorcastes, a King of the
Bacirians, in the time of Ninus, he was an excellent Astrologer, (says the
Author) and first invented Magical Arts. They are indeed the most likely men.
See page 77.
For it is not so much (says he) the perfection of Invention, proportion,
Colors, Motion, and Disposition apart, which affects the senses; but all these
perfections absolutely united, which brings forth that comely Grace and highest
perfection, which Art aims at, and the Artizan strives after. [ Here the beauty
of created things is called the highest perfection, or Grace, which is only due
to God's Power or Grace in the Soul. W. M.] This Grace, says he, proceeds not
from any rules of Art, but from the excellent Spirit of the Artificer; it is
ea^^er attained by Observation [not called by God to such works; though
Bezaleel and Aholiah were called to make curious works in Gold, in Silver, in
Brass, and in Silk, for the Tabernacle. Ex. 31. W. M.] and a good Judgment,
than learned by precepts, as Quintil^an in his Institutions, lib. 11. cap. 1.
learnedly observes. And this Grace is most graceful, when it flows with
facility out of a free Spirit, and is not forced or strained out with Labor
and toil, which quite spoils and kills the Life of the work: Now this facility
springs from Learning, Study, and exercitation, Art and Nature must concur to
the Constitution of this Grace; Art must be applied discreetly to those things,
which we naturally affect, and not to things which we loath, lest we miss of
that Glory which we seek after. [Oh, the sading Glory of this Worlds Wisdom,
Art, Learning, etc. that takes all to itself, etc. W. M.]

Thus says the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his Wisdom, neither let the
mighty man glory in his Might, let not the rich man glory in his Riches; but
let him that glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me, that
I am the Lord, which exercise Lovingkindness, Judgment, and Righteousness in
the Earth; for in these things I delight, says the Lord. Jer. 9.23, 24.

Painting the Face; one of the Marks of of a Jezebel, 2 Kings 9.30. for she
painted her Face, and tired her head, when she heard of Jehu's coming; like the
Proud ones of our day.
William Salmon in his Book beforementioned, (says) some may wonder that we
meddle with such a subject as this is, 1 Cor. 3.20. viz painting the Face,
curling, coloring, and poudering the hair.

Answer. And so they may well; that a man of so much knowledge (in several
things) should encourage the practice of so much vanity, Ephesians. 4.17, But let
such know (says he) the painting of a deformed Face, and the licking over of
an old withered, wrinkled, and weather beaten skin are proper appendices to a
Painter; since a single deformity in the Body begets a complication of miseries
in the mind, etc. Exodus 4.11.

Answer. Then Jezebel must learn of the Painter, to paint her Face, being she
is so wicked, to think it a great misery of mind, not to be, or seem to be more
beautiful, than God has made her; and he tells these s^lly Women, viz. it
shall put admiration into the beholders, and fix them in a belief, that you are
the first Fruits of the Resurrection; (where is the washing of Regeneration?
Titus 3.5.)

Again, though some think the Poets did not much amiss, to fancy the Creature
hatched in Hell, by reason it brings with it such a torrent of dejections, etc.

Ans. Is not this sad, that such censures should be given of the Creature, as
being hatched in Hell, if it want some outward beauty, to plea^e the lust of the
Eye, etc. 1 John 2.16.

Again (says he) by this means your sparkling Glories shall fire Platonic
Lovers, so that none, though as cold as Saturn, shall be able to resist your
actuating flames, but shall force the stoutest heart, to a Sacrifice to Love.

Answer. Behold, here is a Sacrifice to a painted Image, or Face, and an
encouragement to be like unto the Daughters of Zion, that were haughty, and
that walked with stretched forth necks, and wanton Eyes, etc. whom the woe was
against, Isai. 3.16.

Again (says he) but it may chance that some Saint or another, may condemn
your hearts for evil, because you strive to make your faces good, and may like
your infide the worse, because your outside may look so well.

Ans. There is that in his heart, that tells him that no Saint will like
Jezebels painting; but if no Saint do personally condemn them; the witness for
God in their hearts does condemn them, when no Eye sees, when they are
spending their time in decking their outside, when within they are full of
rottenness, neither do they by this painting make their Faces good (as he
says) but evil to allure and draw men to Sacrifice, to such love, as the
Harlot in Prove 7. Who said to the foolish young Man, I have perfumed my Bed,
etc. Come, let us take our fill of Love, etc. Let not thine heart decline to
the ways (of a painted Woman, though she has Riches) go not astray in her
paths, O young Man, Her House is the way to Hell, going down to the Chambers of
Death, etc.

Again, yet with Benjamin (says he) refuse not the many messes of pottage, nor
the many changes of Raiment (although one might well enough serve your turn)
but receive them from the hands of Joseph, though all the rest of the Brethren
be angry.

Ans. Here he pleads for the many changes of Raiment (though he offend his
Brethren, 1 Cor. 8.13.) which was one of the sins of the Daughters of Zion,
Isa. 3.22. And one great sin in this Nation, (when the poor want) and though
Joseph did to show the dear love he had to his only Brother Benjamin, give unto
him more than the rest of his Brethren; we do not read that he received them to
become sparkling in Glory, for outward beauty to win any hearts (from God) to
Sacrifice to vain and foolish love; but rather was for the clothing of a meek
and quiet Spirit, which is of great price with the God of Heaven, 1 Peter 3.4.
1 Timothy 6.8.

Again, (says he) avoid not Company for want of Beauty, when art affords an
innocent supply, but with confidence crucify that evil conscience, which
forbids the use of a little oil to make a cheerful countenance, and the
drinking of a little wine to make a merry heart.

Ans. Here he incourages Women not to be shame-faced, contrary to the Apostle,
1 Timothy 2.9. But to be confident, Phil. 3.19. And to Crucify (says he) that
evil conscience, Complexion makers (so called by God.) such Artizans, who mask
Men and Women's Faces with paintings, and false complexions, he compares such
to Juglers, or Sorcerers, who bewitch the senses, and minds of Men, by changing
the Forms of things, making them appear otherwise than indeed they are, see his
Civ. and Ec. Rites. lib. 4. c. 10.
which forbids the use of oil, etc. to plead for paint for the Face; and so
puts darkness for light, and light for darkness; in going about to Crucify,
and call that an evil conscience, that forbids Jezebels paint, and attire, that
their mouths may be smoother than oil, to deceive the simple, Prove. 5. So
taking no care to have oil in their Lamps, to be beloved of the chief
Bridegroom, Math. 5.3. Nor to be clothed like a Woman professing Godliness
with good works, 1 Timothy 2.10. Heb. 6.6. Phil. 3.17, 18. 1 Peter 3.3.4.5.

Lastly, Borrow our Artificial Beautifiers (says he) and become splendid, that
you may be fit to be gathered by the hand of some metamorphosed Hero, lest in
the Garden of deformity, growing green with sickness, you should be taken for
thistles, and so crop'd by Asses.

Ans. I am even weary of writing of such a whorish mark, or painted Faces, that
it grieves my heart, that any professing Christianity should plead for the
painting, and attire of Jezebel, and the Babilonish Whore; and that Woman
should be so splendid, that the Souls of Men may be ensnared and captivated, to
Sacrifice to their Lust; which is very sad, as if the Author W. S. had never
read what our blessed Savior said, Mat. 5.28. But I say unto you, That
whosoever looks upon a Woman to lust after her, has committed Adultery with
her already in his heart.

Then is it not a snare of the Devil, that would allure men to last after a
Woman; which is caused by these Beautifiers, saying by this means; your
sparkling Glories shall fire Platonic Lovers, etc. as before? Therefore (my
Son, says Wisdom) Lust not after her Beauty in thine heart, neither let her
take thee with her Eyelids; Favor is deceitful, and Beauty is vain, but a
Woman that seareth the Lord, she shall be praised, Prove. 6.25. and 31, 30.

Who can find a virtuous Woman? For her price is far above Rubies: the heart of
her Husband does safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil,
she will do him good, and not evil all the days of her life, she seeks Wool,
and Flax, and works, willingly with her hands, she looks well to the ways
of her Household, and eats not the Bread of idleness, she stretches out her
hand to the poor, etc.

The Judgments that God will bring upon a proud Woman.
Thus says the Lord, because the Daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with
stretched forth necks, and wanton Eyes, walking, and mincing as they go, and
making a tinkling with their Feet: Therefore the Lord will smite with the scab
the Crown of the Head, etc. and take away the bravery of their tinkling
Ornaments, Chains, and Bracelets, their Rings and Jewels, the changeable suits
of Apparel, the Hoods and Vails, and have burning instead of Beauty, because of
the filth of the Daughters of Zion,

Isa. 3. They are waxen fat, they shine, yea, they overpass the deeds of the
Wicked.

Jer. 5.28. Woe unto you Scribes, Pharisees, and Hypocrites, for ye are like
unto painted Sepulchers, which did appear Beautiful outward, but within full of
dead Men's Bones, and of all filthiness,

Mat. 23.27. Whereas the aforenamed Author W. S. in p. 376. Complains of some
ungrateful men, that will traduce his well meaning, and skill in Art; And our
person (says he) sought to be rent and destroyed. Answer. Far be it from me to
abuse any man's person; (God knows my heart, I love all men,) and for his skill
in several commendable Arts, he is worthy of praise (so far as it is due to
man;) but for some things written by him, (to gratify a proud Spirit) which I
have answered, as aforesaid, I cannot commend him for, seeing they are contrary
to the Gospel and Cross of Christ Jesus, which crucifies the Flesh with the
Lusts of the Eye, etc.

Hoping in God (that by his Grace) he will show him his Duty, and what is most
profitable (in Art) for a Christian, and make use of his Talent for Gods Glory
for the future, which is the prayer of his Loving Friend,

W. M.

A Charmer is thus described by T. G. aforesaid.
HE is a Charmer who speaks words of a strange Language, and without sense
(sometimes) And he in his foolishness thinks that these words are profitable:
That if one say so or so unto a Serpent, or Scorpion, it cannot hurt a man; and
he that says so or so unto a man, he cannot hurt, etc. He that whispereth
over a Wound, or reads a verse out of the Bible; likewise he that reads
over an Infant, that it may not be frighted, or that lays the Book of the
Law, or the Philacteries upon a Child that it may sleep; such are not only
among Inchanters or Charmers, but of those that generally deny the Law of God;
because (says he) they make the words of the Scripture medicine for the Body,
whereas they are not; but medicine for the Soul, as it is written Prove. 3.22.
They shall be life unto thy Soul, etc. Among which may be numbered several more
Diviners, ( Vid Mag. Demon. lib. 2. cap. 1.) whose Practice is forbidden in the
Scriptures, Deuteronomy. 18.10, 11. in number nine, not because there were no other,
but these were the most usual. As 1. An Observer of times. 2. An Inchanter. 3.
A Witch. 4. A Charmer. 5. A Consulter with Familiar Spirits. 6. A Wizzard. 7. A
Necromancer. 8. A Consulter with the Staff. Hos. 4.12.9. A consulter with
intrals of Beasts; Ezekiel. 21.21. Now a Consulter with Ob. or with Familiar
Spirits, the Magicians Art, (in this day) Such a Diviner was the Damosel, Act.
16.16. and the Witch of Endor.

A Consulter with the Staff, (aforesaid) he measures his Staff by spans, or by
the length of his Finger, ( Vid. August. 2. de Doctr. Christ ca. 23. saying as
he measures, I will go (to War, etc.) I will not go, I will do such a thing, I
will not do it, and as the last span fell out, so he determined; this was
termed by the Heathen, divination by the Rods; which way Nebuchadnezar
consulted with, Ezekiel. 21.21. Being to make War both with the Jews, and the
Ammonites, and doubting in the way, against whether of these he should make his
first onset, he also consulted with the Liver of a Beast, by taking notice of
the color of the Intrails, and if any be displaced, and whether any were
wanting, etc.

I shall conclude this part (of vain Divinations) with one memorable example
recorded, Jarchi Levit. 19.26.
1 Samuel 29. There King Saul being about to War with the Philistines (God
denying to answer him either by Dreams, or by Urim, or by Prophets) upon the
fame of the Witch of Endor, he repaired to her, demanding that Samuel might be
raised up from the Dead, to tell him the issue of the War. Now that this was
not in truth Samuel, is easily proved both by testimonies of the learned, and
reasons First, It is improbable, that God who had denied to answer him by any
ordinary means, should now deign him an answer so extraordinary. Secondly, No
Witch or Devil can disturb the Bodies or Souls of such as die in the Lord,
Because they rest from their Labors Rev. 14.14. Thirdly if it had been Samuel,
he would doubtless have reproved Saul, for consulting with Witches, see T.
Godw. Civ. and Eccl. Rites lib. 4. c. 10.

Bowing, Worshipping, Cap and Knee to God only, and not to man, under the Gospel
Dispensation.
1. HE that performs this Worship to man what does he more to God, to whom
every Knee shall bow.

2. Mordecai refused it to proud Haman.

3. Peter refused it from Cornelius, saying, he was a man.

4. The Angel twice refused this kind of bowing from John, Rev. 19.10.22.9. for
this Reason, Because I am thy fellow Servant, and of thy Brethren.

5. It is written, that the customs of the Gentiles we are not to follow.

6. The Apostles desired us not to be conformable to the World, etc. Romans 12.2.
As he that respects Persons commits Sin. Jam. 2.9.

Lastly, Though it be far from me to judge a^^ those, to whom God has not
shown the evil o^ these things (in this day,) yet nevertheless doubt not, but
to such as will prove faithf^^ witnesses to Gods Grace in their Conscience God
will also show to them the evil of the^^ things, and not rob God of his Glory,
to who^ all honor, etc. belongs now and for ever.

Of Titles, or Names given to Persons, and Places.
THe Titles of Holiness, Eminency and Excellency used among the Papists to the
Pope, and Cardinals, etc. And Grace, Lordship, and Worship to the Clergy among
the Protestants, It is a most high usurpation; See R.B. Apolog. page 373. How
can they say, they follow the Example of Peter and Paul, who never sought such
Titles.

Hence says Jude, ver. 25. To the only wise God our Savior be Glory and
Majesty, etc. 1 Pet. 1.16.

Neither be ye called Master, says Christ Jesus unto his followers, Matthew.
23.10. That is, except it be by those that are really your Servants, Ephesians. 6.5.
If I say to one, I am your Servant, I lie, except I am really his Servant, and
at his command in all lawful business whatsoever.

And says Casaubon in his Book of manners and Customs, page 169. In this last
age he is esteemed an uncivil man, who will not either to his inferior or
equal subscribe himself Servant. But Sulpitius Severus was heretofore sharply
reproved by Paulinus Bishop of Nola, because in his Epistle, he had subscribed
himself his Servant; saying, Beware thou subscribe not thy self his servant who
is thy Brother; for flattery is sinful, not a Testimony of Humility, to give
their Honors to men, which are only due to the one Lord, Master and God. And
says Elihu, Job. 32.21. Let me not accept any man's Person, neither let me give
flattering Titles unto man. For I know not to give flattering Titles; in so
doing, my Maker would soon take me away. And though Sir, Rabbi or Master, and
some other things were customarily used amongst men, before Christ's Ascension;
but after his followers grew up into more knowledge of Gods Spirit and Kingdom
of Righteousness, they finally rejected it: who being not of the Pharisees
Spirit, for they love the praise of men, more than God, John 12.43. that Christ
Jesus said, Chap. 5. v. 44. How can ye believe which receive honor one of
another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only? Neither do we read,
that the Apostles called an house a Church, or Christ's Church, or St. Paul's
Church, or Jesus College, or had Bells to call people together, or an
hourglass to preach by, or had Deanries, or Prebendries, or sprinkled Infants,
or called any thing a Sacrament, or had Mattens, and Evening songs, Organs,
Rails, Altars, Fonts, and singing men, and Boys to sing to them. or Hood,
Surplisses and Tippets, etc. or did the Apostle preach for Tithes, or yearly
hire, or preached by Uses, Reasons, Helps, Motives, etc. studying beforehand
what to say, nor were called Arch-bi^^ops, or Lord-bishops, Doctors, Vicars,
Cu^^tes, etc.

Nor did compel any to sing in rimes, in imi^^tion of David, saying, I go
mourning all the day ^^ng, etc. even by such as never were truly sor^owful for
their Sins.

Reader, search thy own heart, and there is Witness for God's ways, which will
show thee from whence all these took root; so may ^hou beled out of Babylon,
if thou followest its all, Rev. 18.4.21.7.

Chemical hard words, their signification.
A Malgamation, Is a calcining, or corroding Metals with Quicksilver.
Calcination, Is a reducing any thing into Ashes. Coagulation, Is a reducing of
any liquid thing to a thicker substance, by evaporating the humidity, or
moisture. Digestion, Is a concocting of a crude thing, by an easy and gentle
heat. Filtration, Is the separating of any liquid matter from its Faeces, as
water from Ashes, through a paper, or flannel bag. Fixation, Is the making of
any Volatile Spiritual Body endure the fire. Fumigation, Is the calcining of
Bodies by the same Spirit. Insolation, Is the digesting of things in the Sun.
Menstruum, Is any liquor that serves for the extracting the essence of any
thing. Reverberation, Is the reducing of the Bodies of Metals, etc. into a
Calx (like unto ashes) by a reflecting flame in a furnace. Sublimation, Is the
raising of any matter to the upper part of the vessel, by way of subtle
pouders, as Antimony, Saltpeter, etc. Volatile, is that which flies the fire.
Transmutation, Is the changing of a thing in substance, color, and quality;
now our Alchymists would have people believe that they have attained to a
Powder, Tincture, Elixir, or Stone of the Philosophers, which will separate all
impurity from the Bodies of all Metals, and change it into fine Gold; which I
believe, but when they have got this fine Gold, it will but make the old
Proverb good, that is, a man may buy Gold too dear; for he that blows away (in
a test) all the impurity (as I may say) of about a pound of Silver; and it may
be shall scarce have one dram of this fine Gold, so had better sit still; for
the separating of Metals from their impurity, leaves but little for the
Workman; therefore they had better be silent than write of transmutation of
Metals into fine Gold, except they can change them in substance, color and
quality as aforesaid.

Note, That it was much in my heart to write something of these things, because
that many of great wits (so called) are deceived by the Philosophical writers
of this and former Ages, and such wits are the most apt to deceive others, in
things that are beyond the reach of mortal man, to new create, or so much
change nature, as aforesaid, and so comes to be elevated in his mind, and to
boast of high seize in these things; deceiving himself as well as others,
by seeking and preparing Earthly Treasures above the Heavenly; for he that has
attained to know God, he need seek no further, for his Riches no man can take
from him, it is beyond the finest Gold, because it is everlasting; yea, it is a
Kingdom also to the true Christian; but not of this world, (where all things
fade.) Now some men, having their hearts in the Earth, have found a Kingdom
there, called a Mineral Kingdom (by W. Salmon;) the Mineral Kingdom (says he)
is divided into Metals, Semi-metals, Salts, and Stones.

2. Metals are in number seven, viz. Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Sol, Venus,
Mercury, and Luna, called by the vulgar (says he) Lead, Tin, Iron, Gold,
Copper, Quicksilver, and Silver; (must these seven Planets be called the seven
Gods of this Mineral Kingdom?) being it is vulgar, to call them Lead, Tin, etc.

3. The Semi-metals are Antimony, Tin-glass, Cinnaber, and Zink.

4. The Salts are chiefly, Vitriol, Sulphur, Arsenick, Alum, Nitre, Borax, and
Salt.

5. The chief Stones are Lapis, Calaminaris, Tutia, Lazuli, and Limestone.

6. Now out of these (says he) the Alchymist designs three things, to wit. 1.
Either the Counterfeiting of the fine Metals. 2. Or the separation of fine
Metals out of the base. Or 3. The generation of the fine Metals out of the
base, by transmutation, etc. By generation, and transmutation, what can be
meant but by a new Creation of Metals? which no mortal man can do as I said
before, and in p. 376. Let others search as we have done (says he) like a
Philosopher, it is some satisfaction, that the matter here, sought, is really
in rerum natura. etc.

If I have erred in any thing before written, I beg the Authors pardon; and
wish him well believing he knows better things.

A short memorandum, when a House is on fire.
IF you see the first beginning of the fire, strive to damp it, by spreading
wet Linnensheets thereon, and keep the Doors, and Windows close shut, that the
fire draw not the wind to force the flame out (till more help come) and also
spread Sheets upon all the Buildings near, and to every sheet let one man be to
keep it wet, by this means several Buildings have been saved, through Gods
Blessing; and amongst the several Judgments that God brings upon people for
Sin, this is often one; so fear the Lord, by departing from iniquity then happy
are ye, come what will come; for the trial of the people of God; as also for a
Rod for the workers of iniquity; that turn not yet from the evil of their ways,
notwithstanding they have seen Gods Judgments, of the Sword, Fire, Sickness,
etc.

Embalming of the Dead with the Egyptians, Gen, 50.2.
THey took out the Bowels of the Dead, they cleansed them, and washed them with
the Wine of Dates, and after that, again with Odours, then filled they the
Bowels with pure Myrrh beaten, and Cassia, and other Odours (except
Frankincense) and sowed them up, after this they seasoned the Corpse hidden in
nitre seventy days, not longer; after seventy days they washed the Corpse, and
wrapped it in fine Linen cloth, gummed, which gum the Egyptians often used
instead of Glue, but when the Funeral obsequies were not long delayed, they
used another kind of embalming, namely an external, and outward application of
Spices, and Odours without the unbowelling of the Corpse; this was used toward
our Savior Christ, John 19.20.

Of the Sepulchers, or Tombs, or Caves.
They hewed them out in a Rock, six cubits long, and four broad, in which eight
other Cells, or lesser holes (or as some say thirteen) were made, as so many
distinct receptacles, or Tombs for the dead Bodies to be be laid in, Talmurd,
seder Nezikin. Bava. Bathra cap. 6.
as often as they buried any, they were wont to roll a great stone to the mouth
of the Cave; Joseph* laid the Body of Christ in such a new Tomb, Mat. 27.59,
60. The Jews sounded Trumpets at the Funeral of Noblemen, but for common people
or Children they used a Pipe; in this respect it is said, that Jesus when he
raised Jairus his Daughter, cast out the Minstrels, Mat. 9.23. (signifying that
where Christ rules in the heart, there is no delight in outward Minstrels.)
These Jews were not then come off these things, who hired Women to sing at
Burials, etc. and likewise by outward significations of Sorrow, to move the
company, and more strongly to affect them, call for the mourning Women, etc.
and send for skilful Women, Jer. 9.17. These the Romans called, chief, or
skilful mourners.

Of Bells to Assemble.
But says (T. G.) the Priests might lawfully blow their Trumpets, and Horns on
the Sabbath Day, for the Assembling of the People, number. 10.2. by proportion
(says he) it is now warrantable for Christians to ring Bells to assemble the
People together on the Lords Day, and to take Journies to join with the public
Congregation, as the Jews say concerning the overthrow of Jericho, which
according to their writings fell on the Sabbath Day; R. D. Kimcbi in Josh. 6.
he which commanded the Sabbath to be Sanctified, commanded it also to be
profaned; says the Author: Now whether this practice of Bells ringing for
Worship, for Marriages, and for Burials; be to be observed under the Gospel,
let the witness for God in every heart be the Judge, etc.

And says (T. G.) Vriah the Priest, and Zachariah the Son of Jeberechia, are
thought to have been Godfathers at the Circumcision of Maher-shalal-hash-baz,
Es. 8.2. and from them the custom of having Godfathers in Baptism, to have
taken its Original, Stukius de conviv. lib. 1. cap. 16.

The Epistle of Paul to the Laodiceans.
1. PAul an Apostle, not of Man, nor by Man, but by Jesus Christ.

2. To the Brethren, which are at Laodicea, Grace and Peace from God the
Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

3. I thank my God in all my Prayers, that you remain steadfast in him, and in
all his works, waiting upon his promise to the day of Judgment.

4. And be not seduced by some unprofitable talkers, who go about to cause you
to fall from the Gospel which was Preached unto you by me.

4. Oh that they that were instructed by me, might serve to the profit of the
Gospel of Truth, and become diligent in good works of Eternal Life.

6. And henceforth are my bonds manifest, which I suffer for Christ's sake.

Wherefore I rejoice in heart, and account it Eternal Salvation:

8. That such is done through your Prayers, by the working of the holy Spirit,
whether by Life, or Death.

9. For I have a Will and a Joy to die in Christ, who will through the same
Mercy give you to have the same love, and to be of one mind.

10. Therefore beloved Brethren, as you have heard in my presence, that keep
and finish in the fear of God, so shall you have Eternal Life, for God will
work it, and perfect it in you without delay.

11. My beloved, rejoice in the Lord, and take heed of them that are desirous
after filthy Lucre.

12. Let your Prayers be manifest unto God, and remainfirm in the knowledge of
Christ.

13. And do that which is meet, convenient, just, and reasonable; and what you
have heard and received, that keep in your hearts, so shall you have praise.

14. The Grace of God, and our Lord Jesus Christ be with your Spirits, Amen.

Col. 4.16 This Epistle of Paul to the Laodiceans, was found in the oldest
Bible that was Printed at Worms.

To the Bowed in Spirit, under Sin.
Do thou still feel in thy heart, reproofs for Sin, Be of good courage, for
God has not yet forsaken thee, therefore obey the reproof of instruction (in
thy heart) for it is the way to everlasting Life with God for ever, Isa. 30.21.
John 16.6.

To the hardened in Evil.
Can thou Swear, Lie, Cheat, break thy Promise, oppress the Innocent; or
commit Adultery; and feels no sharp reproofs for any of them in thy Conscience,
then art thou in a miserable condition, and it is to be feared that God has
cast the Reins of the Bridle on thy neck, and given thee up to thy own hearts
Lust, which is thy portion; because of thy so often provoking of the Lord by
thy Rebellion against his good Spirit, that he has left thee to hardness of
heart, as he did Pharaoh, never to escape everlasting vengeance without a
timely, and speedy Repentance in Dust and Ashes, before thou go hence,
believing that all things are possible with God; though thy sins were as
Scarlet, etc. Isa. 1.18. and 55, 6, 7, 8. If thou turns unto him with all thy
heart.

An Advertisement of Love.
THey that burn in Effigy the Person of the Pope, and also the Person of a
Presbyter (after the same manner) with a short Cloak, diminutive band, etc. are
all Christians of one size, or nominal Christians, being far from loving of
Enemies, as Christ commands, of whom they would take the name Christian, but
wants the nature of that Love, that will overcome Enemies, which Love will
certainly overcome, if all called Christians, would seek Gods Glory, and not
the exaltation of self in this world, and put their trust in God alone for
deliverance, saying with the three Children unto the King, We are not careful
to answer thee in this matter, behold the God whom we serve is able to deliver
us, but if not, be it known to thee O King, that we will not serve thy Gods,
etc. Dan. 3.17. For he that knows not God, knows not what God he Worshipeth, so
may compel to the Worship of an unknown God.

Common Prayer Book; of good things therein, if truly minded.
1. See Good Friday, the Collect, so called; Almighty and everlasting God, by
whose Spirit, the whole Body of the Church is governed and Sanctified, 2 These.
2.13.

Observe, By this it is declared that they only are of the Church of God, that
are governed and sanctified by the Spirit of God, so that all that are so
governed, go to the Church, and Worship God according to the said
Common Prayer, being the Church is in God the Pillar, and ground of Truth, 1 Timothy 2.15. Colos. 1.24.

2. The Coll. 3d Sunday after Easter gives a clear testimony to the (Light)
that God shows to all men that be in error.

Observe, do not those that believe that this (Light) in every man, is not
sufficient to lead out of error, believe contrary to the Common Prayer? John
1.9, 3, 19, 20, 21.

3. Collect 5th Sunday after Easter, that is a Prayer for the inspiration of
Gods Holy Spirit, to cleanse the thoughts of the Heart, and to think those
things that be good.

Observe, How do they own the Common Prayer Book, that in these days make a
mock at Inspiration, and say it is ceased? Job 32.8.

4. And that good Prayer, which is said often, but little practiced, said on
St. Stephens Day; Grant us O Lord to learn to love our Enemies, by the example
of thy Martyr St. Stephen, who prayed for his Persecuters? etc.

Observe, Now what People lives and walks nearest the life of the words of the
Common Prayer Book, let the witness for God (against all sin) in every heart be
the Judge (a Tree being to be known by its Fruit, Mat. 12.33.) For some People
are so far from loving Enemies, that they persecute their Friends, because they
go not to a Church, so called, made of Stone, Acts 7.48. when the
Common Prayer Book does not require it, it being sufficient to be of that
Church, that the Members thereof are governed and sanctified by the Spirit of
God, and also because they cannot in good Consciences pay tyths of the increase
of their Lands Labor, and sweat of their brows, being that the tenths, or
tyths to the Priesthood is disannulled by Christ Jesus, Heb. 7. For Christ's
Ministers receive temporal things, only of those that freely give, Mat. 10.8.
And having by their Ministry planted a Vineyard, may eat the Fruit thereof,
but not make the Gospel chargeable, 1 Cor. 2.18, 27. For forced maintenance has
caused most of the Divisions, and strivings in the Nations, for possession,
John 18.36.

Lastly, And to persecute those, that cannot break Christ's Command (nor teach
others so to do, Mat. 5.19.) that is to say Swear not at all Mat. 5, 33, 34,
55, 36, 37. James 5.12. For because of swearing the Land mourns, Jer. 23.10.
Neither has Oaths been of safety to any Magistrate or People, as appears by
the late times, by swearing to and again as Governments have altered, for he
that will Lie, matters not an Oath (except to keep favor with his Party) and
he that breaks his yea or nay (a Christian-bond) ought to suffer as much, as he
that breaks his Oath, the Sin being the same in the sight of God, Mat. 5.19.
James 2.10.

See T. Godwyns Civil and Eccless. Rites, Lib. 4. Cap. 10. Wherein he shows
many of the unwarrantable Heathenish customs that the Jews borrowed of the
Heathens; several of which, the Christians (so called) have imitated since; yet
we see the goodness of God, that he more and more is bringing People out of
outside formality, into the inward life and power of Godliness, with himself,
from those that are settled in Man's Traditions (who cry, lo here is the way, lo
there is the way (in some outward observation) when Christ Jesus says; Behold
the Kingdom of God is within you; Luke 18.21. And says Paul, for the Kingdom
of God is not Meat nor Drink, but Righteousness and Peace, and Joy in the Holy
Ghost, Romans 14.17. And he (Christ Jesus) said unto them, Will ye reject the
Commandment of God, that ye may observe your own Tradition, Mark 7.9. Mat.
15.9. Will you compel People to your Tradition, of Swearing, when God has
Commanded not to swear at all, Mat. 5.33, 34, 35, 36, 37. James 5.12. Whosoever
therefore shall break one of the least Commandments, and teach men so, he shall
be called the least, etc. Mat. 5.19.

And moreover says our Savior, Observe all things, whatsoever I have
Commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, unto the end of the world, Mat.
28.20.

And as Chrysostom, and others say, for what end will thou force him to Swear,
whom thou believe not that he will speak the truth? and several Martyrs have
born a testimony against all Oaths, etc.

And the Martyrs in and before Queen Mary's days, did also bear a Testimony
against Oaths, as Walter Brute, (and others) he held that it is not lawful for
Christians, for any cause, in any case, to swear by the Creator, neither the
Creature, in his last Testimony against the Pope and Church of Rome. See Act.
Mon. vol. 1. fol. 653. so that those Protestants that practice swearing, are
out of the Life of the Apostles, and Martyrs of Jesus, though they be
garnishing the Sepulchers of the Righteous, (like the Jews the Prophets)
Printing and Re-printing their Labors, although in Life and Practice as
contrary to them, as Light is to Darkness; for in Christ Jesus, it is neither
being of this or the other Religious Opinion, going to Church, or Meeting, or
not going, taking Bread and Wine, or not taking Bread and Wine, Baptizing with
Water, or not Baptizing with Water, Circumcision, or Uncircumcision avails
any thing, but A NEW CREATURE, Gal. 6.15. (without God shall by his Spirit
require any outward Practice) And as many as walk according to this rule, (of
the NEW CREATURE) peace shall be upon them, and Mercy, and upon the Israel of
God. ver. 16. For thus says he, that is high and excellent, he that inhabiteth
the Eternity, whose name is the Holy One, I dwell in the high and holy places,
with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit, to revive the Spirit of
the humble, and to give Life to them that are of a contrite Spirit. Isa. 57.15.
Psalm. 34.18.51.17. Oh, that all People would bring their Lives and Practices to
be tried by Christ's Sermon upon the Mount! Matthew. 5, 6, and 7. Chap.

An Experiment of Bees.
How to take some Honey from each Stock of Bees yearly, or to double them,
which may be called an artificial Swarm, if the year comes not very bad for
gathering of Honey.
1st. GET strong straw Hives made, but not too big, let them be almost flat at
the top, to set one upon another conveniently, let each Hive have a round hole
on the top, about one Inch and a half over, dress them as for a swarm, and they
are ready.

2dly, Cut a natch on the back of the Bee-stool, about 5 or 6 Inches long, and
2 over, with a shutter, like a bread gratter, to draw in and out, to see the
strength of your Bees by the light of the door, let not the Sun shine on the
Hives, except about the door.

3dly, About May Day (so called) set those new Hives upon the Bees-stools,
under each stock of Bees that is not poor, clay up the edge of the stocks to
the new Hives, that a Be pass not out, except at the Door of the new Hives.

4thly, About the middle of June, see if they have half filled the new Hives,
which if they have, choose a warm morning, as when Bees are apt to lie out, and
take off one stock, and give it a shake, that some Bees may drop out, and carry
it a pole or two, and clay it up, and let it work till the middle of August to
be smothered or saved for store; then return to the new Hive, and with a piece
of Tile cover the top hole, and clay it well, and brush off the Bees with
Hysop, and cover the Hive.

5thly, If they have not half filled the lower Hive, by the middle of June,
then let them so stand and work till the middle of August, and then take the
Honey in the new Hive, and save the Bees alive; after this manner choose a
clear cool morning, (having the night before taken some clay from between the
Hives to cool them) take off both the Hives together and set them on the grass,
and immediately take the Stock off the new Hive, and set it on the Stool again;
then take up the new Hive and shake out some of the Bees, and if there be Bees
enough in the Stock, smother the Bees in the new Hive; but if you had rather
save them all alive, carry the Hive into some secret Place, cover it with
straw, being turned upside down, and many will out, remove your place, and take
fresh Straw twice or thrice, and they will most go home; but if you would save
all the Bees, carry the Hive into a Chamber, (having before opened the top of
the window all along) and brush the Bees off the Combs, and they will fly to
the Window, and so out and home, and the Honey will be Virgins Honey, so called:
But to arm your selves to do this work, make a thin bagg to put thy head in,
and tie it about the neck, having first sowed in a piece of a Weavers slay, for
sight and breath.

I have taken above two hundred pounds of Honey out of seven Stocks, in one
year, besides the seven new ones.

Note, that if the year comes very good for Bees, and they have half filled
their lower Hive by the first of June, (and good store of Bees) you may set
then another under the second and first, etc. and then take the Stock, or
Over-Hive for use, at the middle of August, and get the Bees out as before.

Note, In driving of Bees out of the Combs, (as aforesaid) take the Hive off
gently; for if you knock it, so that any Honey happen to get out of the Combs,
the Bees Wings will be smeared with Honey, so that they will not go out of
themselves, do what you can, which if it so happen, take it into a private
place amongst the grass, (being a Sunshiny day) and take out Comb after Comb,
brush the Bees on the grass, and lay the Combs in a dish, (often removing your
places) and the drowned Bees, with the Hive, set near the other Bees, for a
general Feast, and they will cleanse the smeared Bees, and it may be they may
go home to their new Hive.

Memorandums.
1. LAy salt on the stool, and ashes on the Crown once a year.

2. Dress the stools in February.

3. Feed them but in April with wet Sugar, if rainy weather come.

4. The Queen Be is often found on the ground under a Hive of two swarms, and
after the last swarm.

5. Bees age scarce two years.

6. Help them to kill the Drones in July, or at other times, to prevent
swarming.

7. June the best Month for Bees.

8. They breed most in wet weather, and almost all Summer.

9. When they cast out young white Bees, the stock is good.

10. Take no Honey before August.

11. Remove Bees in January, and to carry them many Miles, wrap a Cloth about
them, and turn them upside down on Straw in a Cart.

12. To try to make them swarm, lay stinking weeds under them that they lie not
out, but above the door, and the Sun shine not on them but at the door; if this
do not make them swarm, rare them two Inches, and they often swarm in two or
three days after; do this about the middle of June.

13. In swarming time have a Hive ready dressed, to place at their settling, and
they often go in of themselves.

14. If a swarm is going home again, cover all your stocks with sheets, and
place a dressed Hive for them.

15. Set not a swarm too near the commen hiving place.

16. One swarm being hived, cover it, if another is rising.

17. If a swarm hangs on several boughs, get them together quickly.

18. If two swarms hangs near, or together, shake half into one Hive, and cover
it with a cloth, and carry it a Pole off, and when they have taken to the
Hive, cover it, and hive the other part of the Bees.

19. Two swarms together most commonly fight till one Queen Be be killed.

20. Take up the best and the worst.

21. One good swarm is enough out of one stock in one year.

22. Set each stock with their doors almost East, and 3 foot asunder.

23. If a swarm gets into a hollow Tree, stop them up, and bore a hole under
them, to let in the smoke of burnt Cow dung, and open the other hole for them
to fly out.

24. If Robbers come, shut the Bees up close at night, and before, to one Be,
with Tin having holes in it, and kill the Robbers in the morning; but if crumbs
of Wax come down, smother them at night, and take the Honey, and set the Hive in
its place again, and place a piece of Whalebone long ways at the door, that the
Robbers can put by to get in, but not out. To know whether they be your
Neighbors Bees, take notice which way they pass at Sunset, and after, and you
may know.

25. Keep Grass smooth near the Bees.

26. The Bees will choose to go in and out at the East side of their Hives, if
nothing be in their way.

27. Let the Be stools be but little wider than the Hive, and rising in the
middle, then the rain will not beat under them, which causes vermin to breed;
let a board be nailed to the edge of the Stool, about 10 Inches square,
slopewise for the Bees to settle and rest on, when they come home laden.

28. For Capes or covering for a Be Hive, take half a sheaf of Rye straw, bind
it in the middle with a string, like unto a Faggot, then turn the ends both
ways like a Cake, and set it on a Hive, and cut it round, on which lay a two
penny earthen pan, and heavy stones on the pan.

29. A swarm this year is most likely to give a swarm the next year, the older
the stock is, the lother they are to swarm, for the most part, after the second
year of a swarms age, set them double as before is taught.

30. To make doors to set under the edge of each Be Hive, take a piece of
Sallow; or Willow of about one Inch square, and 6 or 7 Inches long, then cut
away about 4 or 5 Inches in the middle at one side, that Bees may easily pass
under it, (but not a Mouse, nor a House Snail,) then cut a natch long ways with
a Saw, for a shutter of the same Wood to slip too and fro, that but one Be can
pass out all Winter, or when robbing Bees come, and to slip full open in May,
June and July.

31. When you are minded to kill Bees, make a great round Hole in the ground,
(at the middle of August) set a match of Brown paper upon a short stick, of 2
Inches square, dipped in Brimstone, being well lighted set the Bees thereon, and
put the loose earth about the Hive, knocking the Hive a little.

32. The Bees being dead, cut the finest of the Combs into a Sieve that stands
over, a pan, and bruise them a little, so let them stand two days, the first
Honey, that you pour out of the Pan is the best, the Combs in the Sieve you may
either make Mead with washing them, or get the Honey out by putting the Sieve
into an Oven, after the Bread is drawn, and it will be pretty good Honey; and
for the worst of the Combs, soak them in Water, with them that come out of the
Oven, and brew it with some Malt, and drink it in a little time; three pound of
Honey is one quart.

33. Melt the Wax in water, and press it out strongly, then melt it in fair
water, and skim it clean, then cover it with clothes till it is cold, that the
Wax Cake crack not.

Common-ground, the Poors Right more than the Rich.
IT is a sad age in which we live, that rich, earthly minded men should seek to
keep the poor people always very poor. The Cattle upon the thousands of Hills
are mine, says the Lord, which God intended for the poor, as well as others,
even for a general good; And besides the large Common-grounds in England the
Rich keep from the Poor, in a great measure, which properly is their right, or
so much thereof, to keep their Families from want, but not to live in idleness;
for some Christian spirited people did, in former ages, give Land as common
unto the Poor; but we too often see, how that Rich men by force take it from
them, That many Lords of Towns, so called, and other rich Commoners, had rather
hinder themselves (in some things,) that they may lord it over the poor, and
hinder a general Improvement of Land, than to benefit the poor, by letting them
enclose a small part of a Common, to maintain their Families, (though the poor
may have friends raised to give the value of it in Money;) but are rather for
having a Law to maintain them very poorly by collections; whenas the Poor might
improve Commonground for a general good, and pay taxes. Such oppression on the
poor, is no fruit of a Christian Spirit, which is to do unto the poor as they
would be dealt with, if they were in the poors condition; The Nation being big
enough to maintain ten times as many people (I suppose) as are now in it, by a
Christian Industry, and the Laws put in execution against Drunkenness, and
other the abuses of good things, the which is of the greatest concern, that the
Magistrates ought to look after: And the Poor, as well as others, ought to learn
the Apostle Paul's Lesson, that is, to be content in all conditions, which Paul
said he had learned, Philip. 4.11. Then will none of the poor in a contentious
angry Spirit, strive to get in ground enclosed from the Common, but rather
patiently wait upon God, until he shall be pleased to open the hearts of men in
outward Power, to grant them their Birthright, and to become sharers with them
of the Earth, (that all may seek a General Good, and not so much for a private
Interest;) then will there be a Blessing upon all their Labors, so as none
covet to have more than is needful, to spend it upon their Lusts and pleasures;
for which Sin, the Creator of the Heavens and the Earth, does and will more and
more send his Judgments upon the Inhabitants of the Earth, except they speedily
repent by yielding obedience to the Grace of God in their hearts, which will
not consent to one Sin. Exodus 23.6. Prove. 22.22.23.16.29.14. Rob not the poor,
because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in Judgment; for the Lord
will defend their cause, and spoil the Soul of those that spoil them. Thou
shall not overthrow the right of the poor in his suit. A King that judges the
poor in truth, his Throne shall be established for ever.

There are multitudes of Examples to be given, that show the wonderful Mercy
and Love of God, to such as have been assistant to the Poor, which hard hearted
men take little notice of; but for brevities sake, I shall but mention one
remarkable passage, as I found it in Richard Burton's Historical Remarques, p.
63. Printed for Nath. Crouch at the Bell in Exchange-Alley, London. In the
Reign of K. Henry the Third, was a great famine in England, about the year
1245, whereby the Poor miserably perished for want of Bread. The Authors of
those times relate this story very credibly, to show how displeasing
Unmercifulness and want of Charity is in the sight of God; several poor People
plucked the Ears of Corn, while they were green in the Common fields, merely to
keep themselves from starving, at which the owners being much offended, desired
the Priest of the Parish to curse and excommunicate them all the next Sunday:
But one of the Company adjured the Priest in the name of God, to exempt his
Corn from the Sentence, saying, That it pleased him well, that the poor being
pinched with Famine, had taken his Corn; and so commended what was left to the
blessing of God. The Priest being compelled by the importunity of others, had
no sooner begun the Sentence, but a sudden Tempest of Thunder, Lightning, Wind,
Hail, and Rain, interrupted him, whereby all the Corn fields thereabout were
laid waste and destroyed, as if they had been trodden under Foot with Cart and
Horses; yea, no kind of Fowl nor Beast would feed upon it: But this honest,
tender hearted man found all his Corn and Ground, though mingled among others,
altogether untouched, and without the least harm. Prove. 14.31. He that
oppresses the poor, reproacheth his Maker; but he that honors him, has
mercy on the poor.

Those may be said to rob the poor, as throw down Cottages, by taking the
Commons from them, making great Parks to keep Deer and other Cattle, etc.
(laying house to house, and field to field, that neither work nor place may be
left for the poor, Isa. 5.8.) And enclosing whole Parishes in England, in these
few years, whereby the poor have been forced to remove and lose their right;
but many such Great men have come to want for so doing, God having blasted
their Estates, and have felt God's Judgments for the same; (I shall forbear to
name the Persons.) The same blasting has also come upon many, that have bought
up corn in times of scarcity, to withold it from the poor by great prices,
which is well known to many in this year 1681. as in ages past; And do not they
also rob the poor, that take away the Gleanings of the Grain in the common
fields from the poor, whether it be by the Farmer, or such others as are not
really poor; But some may say, Who are the poor that thou writes of? I Answer,
He or she that has nothing but wearing Apparel, and he that has a Wife, or a
Wife and Children, and works hard for 8 d. or 10 d. a day, and has not above
60 l. value in Land or Money. Lev. 19.9, 10. When ye reap the harvest of your
Land, (says the Lord) ye shall not reap every corner of your field, neither
shall thou gather the Gleanings of thy harvest: But thou shall leave them for
the poor, and Fatherless, and Stranger; I am the Lord your God. Matthew. 5.3.
Blessed are the poor in Spirit; for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven, says our
Savior Christ. Therefore whosoever first seeks the Kingdom of Heaven, all
other things shall be added. Matthew. 6.33. Psalm. 37.16, and 25. I have been
young, (says David) and now am old; yet I have not seen the Righteous
forsaken, nor his seed begging Bread. Notwithstanding I once heard a Priest
interpret it, though his seed begging Bread.

Four great Works of a Tyrant.
1. To destroy the good. 2. To hate the Poor. 3. To extol the evil. 4. To root
out the virtuous.
Coloring in Oil to preserve the Dial-Boards.
MAle the Dial Boards of Quartered wood that they warp not, then take about a
Pint of Lintseed Oil, and put to it an ounce of the Litharg of Gold, heat it in
a Pot till it almost boil, and stir it often, and it is fit for use; then grind
a little Red lead on a Grinding Glovers stone, with some of this Oil, but very
thin of the Lead, brush over your Dial-board 2 or 3 times, letting it dry after
every time of the doing of it. Lastly, wash it with White Lead so ground, as
often as you please; and for the Hour Lines, and Figures, or Letters, work the
said Oil with Lam-black; but if you would have Golden Figures or Letters, do
thus:

Take yellow Oker, and White Lead, and with the said Oil grind it, lay some of
this on the figures in the morning, and at night lay thereon Leaf-Gold, crush
it on with Cotton, and when it is dry, black the edges of the Figures to make
them smooth.

To sodder Iron.
SET the joints of Iron, as Close you can, lay them in a glowing fire, and take
of Venice glass in powder, and the Iron being red hot, cast the powder thereon,
and take it out gently to cool.

Chops in the Skin.
TAke Capons grease mixed with Camphire, or Oil of Roses mixed with Sheeps suet,
anoint the place, and wrap it up, at nights.

To make red Ink.
TAke small Brasil one Ounce, white Lead and Alum of each two Drachms, Gum
Arabic 8 scruples, Urine one pint, shake them often together; it is good to
rule Bibles and some other Books with.

Wars and Fightings not to be by Christians.
1. CHrist commands, that we love our Enemies; but War on the contrary teaches
us to hate and destroy them, Matthew. 5.44.

2. Christ said that his Kingdom is not of this World, and therefore that his
servants should not fight; therefore those that fight, are not his servants.
Joh. 18.36.

3. Because he reproved Peter for the use of the Sword, saying, Matthew. 26.52.
Put up again thy Sword into his place; for all they that take the Sword shall
perish with the Sword. Concerning which Tertullian speaks well, Lib. de Idol.
How shall he fight in peace without a Sword, which the Lord did take away? For
although Soldiers came to John, and received a form of Observation, if also
the Centurion believed afterward, he disarmed every Soldier in disarming of
Peter. Idem de Coro. Mil. asks, Shall it be lawful to use the Sword, the Lord
saying, that he that uses the Sword, shall perish by the Sword? See R.
Barclay's Apologies page 402.

The Word, You, to no more than one Person, how it begun.
WItnessed by John Maresius, of the French Academy, in the Preface of his
Clovis. Let none wonder (says he) that the word [Thou] is used in this work to
Princes and Princesses; for we use the same to God: And of old the same was
used to Alexanders, Cesars, Queens, and Empresses. The use of the word [You]
when one is spoken to, was only introduced by these base flatteries of men of
latter ages, to whom it seemed good to use the plural number to one person,
that he may imagine himself alone to be equal to many others in dignity and
worth, from whence at last it came to persons of lower quality.

Law Terms, a few with Advice.
FEoffour, is one that grants a deed of Land. Feoffee, is he to whom it is
made. Donour, is he that gives Land in Tail. Donee, is he to whom it is given.
Lessour, is he that grants a Lease. Lessee, is he that takes it. Plaintiff,
is he that begins the Suit. or Defendant, is he that answers him. or
Fee-simple, is Land holden to a Man's Heirs and Assigns for ever, but if the Man
dies without Issue, or Will, it falls to the next of Kin. Fee-tayle, a Tenant
in Tayl-General, is where Lands are given to a Man, and to his Heirs of his
Body, and a Tenant in Tayl-Special, is Land given unto a Man and his Wife, and
the Heirs of their two Bodies begotten. Three Brothers, the youngest purchase
in Fee-simple, and dies without Issue or Will, it falls to the eldest Brother
by descent, etc. To purchase Land to him and his Assigns for ever, this is but
for Life. Fealty, is an Oath taken at the admittance of a Tenant, to be true to
the Lord of the Manor. Knights-Service, is to bear Arms for the Lord.
Fee-farm, is Land holden to Man's Heirs for ever under a Rent. Chattels, are
Goods moveable, and immovable, and are called a Man's personal Estate.
Real-Estate, are a man's Lands. Replevy, is bringing of a Writ called replegiari
facias, to gain his Cattle, and putting in surety to the Sheriff, and Sue.
Fine, is a formal conveyance of Land by acknowledging a perfect agreement (more
especially of a Married Woman) before a Judge, or other Commissioners.
Copyhold, is a tenure, that the Tenant holds Lands by Copy of the Court Rolls,
made by the Steward at his Lords Court, this in some places is a base tenure.
Extent, Commissions the Sheriff to seize and value Lands of one, who being
bound by the Statute, etc. Has forfeited his Bond. Recovery, is the obtaining
of Lands by Judgment, or Trial at Law, and of intailed Estates.
Statute-Merchant, and Statute-Staple, is a Bond made between Debtor and
Creditor, in form of a Statute, and acknowledged before a Mayor, or
Chief-Warden of a City, and 2 Merchants assigned therefore. Collateral
Security, is over and above the deed or lease. Lease-parole, is letting of
Lands by word of mouth. Bargains, of above 10 l. value, should be under Hand
and Seal. If Husband and Wife purchase Land together in Fee, the Husband may
sell the Land without the Wives leave, Hen. 21. El. 3.6. Therefore its best for
the Woman to have trustees.
Courtesy of England.
He that Marries a Wife, that has free I and and she dies, and leaves a
Child that is heard once to cry, and dies, he shall have the use of the Land
during his Life, otherwise not. All the Land that a Man has, or shall purchase
in Fee during his Life, having a Wife, and he die, his Wife shall have the 3 d
of the profits of all; though he might have sold some in his Lifetime, except
she did acknowledge a Fine, or he held it jointly with another.

No Man is bound to accuse himself, by the Law of England, (viz.) Magna Charta
28 Edw. 3. Cap. 3.

Item, That no Man of what estate or condition that he be, shall be put out of
Land or Tenement, nor taken, nor imprisoned, nor disinherited, nor put to death
without being brought in answer by due process of the Law.

Note that Freehold, is Goods and Chattels, as well as Lands and Tenements,
Cooks Instit. 29.46.

None under the Age of 21 years, can sue in his own Name; Males and Females of
14 years old, may be bound in Bonds or Covenants, for necessaries, as Food,
Raiment, Schooling, Instructions, and Marriage, etc. Bonds hold ever in force,
till cancelled, or cut off by Hand and Seal.

Lands may be passed ten manner of ways.
As by Fine, Recovery, Feoffment, Grant Lease, Bargain and Sale, Exchange
Surrender, Release and Confirmation, and by Will, but not by word of Mouth.

Children may be Executors.
If a Man dies without Will, or a Will not witnessed by 3 or 4 Witnesses, the
eldest Son will have all his Lands, his Children half the Goods, and his Wife
the other half; if no Children, then his Wife to have half the Goods, and his
next of Kin the other half.

Men under 14, and Women under 12 years of Age, cannot make Wills of Land, but
above that Age may of moveable Goods.

An Administrators Power is equal to an Executor, and are bound to pay his
Debts by speciality according to the value of the Goods, 51 Ed. Cap. 11.

Arbitrators cannot Judge of Fellonies, Treasons, Marriages, and Criminal
offenses against the King or Commonwealth.

Parties may revoke (though not honestly) if they are not bound by Bond to get
the Parties to Seal releases to each other, and some money from one of them,
before they see the Award is the best way to make them Friends, 2 Hen. 6.18 and
19.

So that he that is not willing to refer all Personal trespasses to
Arbitrators, Elected, and Chosen by the Parties, and stand to their Award (but
rather go to Law) is accounted an unreasonable man.

Of the Idol Moloch, to whom the Jews sacrificed their Children. Lev. 18.21.
IN the valley Hinnon, not far from Jerusalem, the Jews set up an Idol of
Copper, like a King, which they called Moloch, that is, a King of Idols. This
Copper Idol stood with the Arms stretching out, and under it was a great fire;
whereby the Image showed fire-red; and besides that, the more to honor it,
they made a great fire between two Walls, which burnt for his sake; and through
this fire the Idolatrous Priests cast living Children into Moloch's burning
Arms, which he with his Arms red hot burnt to Death. And in this manner the
Jews offered their own Children to the Idol Moloch, and when they did it, they
made a great noise and cry, and beat upon a Drum, that the Fathers, when their
Children were offered, should not hear them cry, by reason of the great noise
of the Drum; and therefore Christ likened this valley of Hinnon to Hell fire,
says the Margent to Matthew. 5 chap.

The Israelites were forbidden to offer their Children to it. Lev. 18.21. upon
pain of death, chap. 20.2, 3, 4, 5. It was destroyed by Josiah, (...) Kin.
23.10.

Feasts that Christ allows of, but contrary to Dives's Feasts, Luke 16.19, 26.
THen said Jesus, when thou make a Dinner or Supper, call not thy Friends,
nor thy Brethren, neither thy Kinsmen, nor thy rich Neighbors, lest they also
bid the again, and a recompense be made thee. But when thou make a Feast,
call the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind, and thou shall be blessed, for
they cannot recompense thee; bu^ thou shall be recompensed at the Resurrection
of the Just. Luke 14.12, 13, 14. Who, of the rich of this Worlds Goods, takes
Christ's Counsel in this matter? So that by the vanity tha^ follows most
feastings in these days, we may say as the Preacher once said, Eccles. 7.2.
That (...) is better to go to the House of Mourning, than to the House of
Feasting.

Apparel, and Furniture, the excess therein not to be amongst Christians, and
the poor wants.
I will therefore, (says the Apostle Paul) that Women adorn themselves in
modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety, not with broidered Hair, or
Gold, or Pearls, or costly array; but (which becomes Women professing
Godliness) with good works, 1 Timothy 2.9, 10. And, says the Apostle Peter, let
not your adorning be in that outward adorning of platting the Hair, and of
wearing of Gold, or of putting on of Apparel; but let it be the hidden man of
the heart in that which is not corruptible, even the Ornament of a weak and
quiet Spirit, which is in the sight of God, of great price. 1 Pet. 3.3, 4. For
all that is in the World, the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eye, and the
pride of Life, is not of the Father, but is of the World. 1 John 2.16. Now from
whence proceeds the excess in Apparel and Furniture, (in things that are of no
service) but from the Lust of the Eye, and the pride of Life, etc. Jam. 2.1, 2.
Respecting such as come in platted Hair, or wears Gold or costly array, by such
as profess themselves to be Christians, and say that the Scripture is their
Rule, when they walk quite contrary, even to that excess amongst some people,
that the expenses thereof might maintain six times as many poor people as I
suppose is now in England: If the Scripture was their Rule, they would observe
the same charge that Paul gave unto Timothy, saying, Charge them that are rich
in this world, that they be not high minded, nor trust in uncertain Riches, but
in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. That they do good,
that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate, 1 Timothy 6.17, 18. for the poors relief.

Days all to be kept holy unto the Lord, by ceasing from sin.
THe Apostle Paul says, Let no man condemn you, in respect of meats and drink,
or of an Holy Day, or of the New Mons, or of the Sabbath days, which are but
shadows of things to come; but the Body is Christ. Col. 2 16. Now those that
are come to the Substance Christ Jesus, the everlasting Sabbath of rest, and
are ceased from sin, and keeps every day holy unto the Lord I say such are
persecuted by those that rest still in the shadows, or rather short of those
forme^ shadows, who now observe days, and times, calling them Holy Days, and
instead of keeping a day holy unto the Lord, too many keep them to themselves,
in sports, games, and other vanities; For, says the Apostle Paul, he that
regards not the day, to the Lord be does not regard it. Romans 1.4.6. Yet do
most, now called Christians, approve of one day in seven for public Worship,
the first day of the Week, being convenient for a day of rest, also for
laboring men and Cattle; but the Sabbath day of the Jews was kept on the
seventh day of the Week, called now by some people Saturday.

A Character of a True Christian.
1st. HIS daily care is to keep his mind stayed upon God, that he may be kept
in perfect peace, Isa. 26.3. And through God's Grace he is taught to deny
Ungodliness and worldly Lusts. Tit. 2.11, 12. and to be sober, righteous,
patient, humble, meek, upright, merciful, forbearing, forgiving, peaceable,
gentle, self-denying, constant, faithful, holy, and also temperate in meat,
drink, apparel, etc. which are the fruits of the Spirit, or Grace of God in his
Conscience. James 2 chap.

2dly, He is come out of the works of darkness, and the fruits of the Flesh,
Romans 1. (...) 4.31. and 5 chapter Gal. 5. That is, he is not wanton, or passionate,
or proud, covetous, or a backbiter, or envious, wrathful, unmerciful,
revengeful, profane, drunken, voluptuous or unclean, nor makes Religion a
Cloak for self-interest, or for Loaves.

3dly, He will consent to any righteous thing, for a general good in the Parish
where he dwells, or elsewhere, that the poorer sort may be helped, or others
his Neighbors, and is at all times willing to relieve the needy, according to
his ability, 1 Timothy 6.18.

4thly, He always is ready to endeavor for peace amongst people, or when
controversy arise amongst his Neighbors, he will seek to them in a Christian
way, for them to refe^ themselves for peace sake to persons, chosen by them, to
end their differences, and not go to Law, believing that they are accounted
unreasonable men that will not so end their differences, Matthew. 5.9. 1 Cor. 6.1.

Lastly, He is always willing to submit to the outward Governors of the Nation
wherein h^ dwells, or patiently suffer under them, if the require any thing
that is against God's Law (...) his Conscience. Act. 5.29. And of him that
t^keth away his Goods (for the Law of his God he will not ask them again. Luke
6.30. But if this true Christian be an absenter from the National Church (so
called,) then the outside Christians do call

His Gravity, Sullenness; His Seriousness, Melancholy; His Silence,
Sottishness; His Diligence, Covetousness; His Christian-suffering, Obstinacy;
His plainness in Apparel, Singularity; His proper Speech, Rudeness; His
Scripture Language, Canting; His Sobriety, a cheat for Custom; His being at a
Word, a decoy for Trade; His Industry, Worldly-mindedness; His Hospitality,
Flesh-pleasingness.
In short, such true Christians have been imprisoned, because they cannot take
up Arms, and also for fear they should; and if they answer their Adversaries,
they say it is Nonsense, or Equivocation, so that his Virtues are accounted
Vice, by such Professors as delight only in the form of Godliness, more than
the power thereof.

After this manner the Papist used to disapprove of the Sobriety of the
Waldenses, of whom Reinerius, a Popish Author, so writes:

Now the Protestants of the National Church make use of the name of these
suffering Waldenses, to help to plead for their antiquity, equal with the
Papists, that is, from the Apo^^^s time; which makes them never the
truer^^ristians, considering the great Apostasy, that first spoiled the
simplicity of Truth, and keeping up the Heathenish Learning and Traditions of
men, Col. 2.8, 20. Yet did God here and there raise Witnesses for the Truth,
(in all this dark night) who, for the most part, were persecuted by them that
upheld the shell of Religion, or outward Ceremonies, and neglected the
substance (God's spirits teaching in their hearts) as at this day.

So that if this good Spirit of God was but truly obeyed, it would lead people
to be Witnesses (in measure) of the Saints condition, recorded in the holy
Scripture, experimentally, (for imitation of the Saints practices, before God's
Spirit lead in each heart, has been, and is the door of Apostasy.) Man in his
own Strength and Wisdom, has been too apt to do and act (as to Worship) that
which God does not require or command him, Deuteronomy. 5.32. Isa. 1.12. That the Lord
said, Matthew. 15.9. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for Doctrines the
Commandments of men.

Now Reader, if thy desire is to be truly led, to build upon no other
Foundation, besides the (Rock) Christ Jesus, mark well these Scriptures
following, and the Lord give thee an obedient Heart, viz. For the wrath of God
is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness, and unri^^teousness of men,
who hold the Truth in unrighteousness: Because that which may be known in God,
is manifest in them; for God has showed it unto them: But unto every one of us
is given Grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ; for as many as
are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God: But the anointing which
ye have received of him, abides in you, and ye need not that any man teach
you; but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is
no lie, and even as it has taught you, ye shall abide.

We have also a more sure Word of Prophecy, whereunto ye do well that ye take
heed, as unto a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the
Day Star arise in your hearts. 2 Pet. 1.19. Romans 1.18, 19.8.14.10.6, 7, 8. Heb.
8.10, 12. Ephesians. 4.7.

At that time Jesus answered, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven
and Earth, because thou have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and
have revealed them unto Babes. Matthew. 11.25. 1 Cor. 1.27, 29. But God has
chosen the foolish things of the World to confound the wise, and God has
chosen the weak things of the World to confound the things which are mighty:
That no flesh should glory in his presence. 1 Cor. 4.18, 19. Let no man deceive
himself: If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become
a fool, that he may be wise; For the Wisdom of this World is foolishness with
God, etc.

These things are as a sealed Book to all the Wit, Learning, Study, and man's
reason, until he come to bow his mind to the measure ^^^e Spirit, or Grace of
God in his own heart, ^^om whence these Scriptures (with others) were given
forth.

For the Scripture is given by Inspiration of God, etc. 2 Timothy 3.16. For what
knows the things of a man, save the Spirit of a man, which is in him, even so
the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God. But he that is
spiritual discerns all things, etc. 1 Cor. 2.11, 14, 15. For to be carnally
minded is Death, but to be spiritually minded is Life and Peace; Romans 8.6. Gal.
5.16.6.5. This I say then, walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the
Lusts of the Flesh: For every man shall bear his own burden.

James 4.17. Therefore to him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him
it is sin. Prove. 18.10. The Name of the Lord is a strong, Tower, the Righteous
runs into it and is safe.

Veritati adhaereto. Stick to the Truth. Uniformity in Religion; how
attainable, according to true Christianity; and also something of the fruits of
Imposition upon Conscience, for religious Opinions.
Humbly submitted to the consideration of Superiors, By William Mather.
WHereas it is professed by all the Professors of Christianity, at this day,
that the way and manner of their Religions, or Opinions, is according, and not
contrary to the Scripture of Truth.

Now to create peace amongst all the Churches, and to unite in harmless Love,
that they may all build (only) upon the (Rock) Christ Jesus, Mat. 7.25. If it
shall please God so to open the Eyes of the Magistrates in every place (by his
Grace in their hearts, the sure foundation, Ephesians. 2.8.) to so order it, That the
Minister or Teacher, in each Congregation for Worship, shall read the holy
Scriptures (only) unto their hearers, all waiting upon God in his fear, to
worship him in Spirit and in Truth. John 4.24.

So that if any thing be revealed by Gods Spirit (by way of Interpretation,
Edification, or Prayer) to another that sits by, let the first hold his
peace. 1 Cor. 14.30, 31, 32.

So will God be in the midst of those that are thus gathered together in his
Name. Matthew. 18.20. so as none (in Man's Wisdom speak,) but only as God's
Spirit shall give utterance, though it be through the least Member (accounted
of) in the Church. 1 Pet. 4.10.

^or what confusion and b^^^shed has come upon the World, for several ages, by
reason of man's setting up ways of Worship, Articles of faith, etc. when our
Savior has already done it, Matthew. the 5, 6, and 7. Chapter etc.

For when an Archbishop required Joh. Fox (the Author of the Book of Martyrs)
to subscribe to Articles of Faith, he pulled out his Greek Testament, saying, I
will subscribe unto nothing but this. So that none, except Jews and Atheists,
but will subscribe to God's Book, according to the primitive practice of the
Saints, to worship God in Spirit: And for this Liberty of prophesying, and
Interpretation of the Scriptures (only) by the same Spirit that gave them
forth, the ancient Fathers (so called) have pleaded for; as Jacobus Acontius,
-- After I have alleged (says he) what I had to say for my Opinion, if the
rest shall not allow of my Judgment, I ought to give over defending of it, and
cease to be troublesome to the Congregation concerning the same; but I ought
not to be compelled to confess that I have erred; for so I should sin against
God. -- That we may wrestle with God (says he) by daily prayers, to grant,
that we may have the use of this so sovereign and saving Liberty, so profitable
to the Church, etc.

Oh, that people would but lay aside self-interest! then may they see, how they
are falln from the true Worship of God, (by setting up Man's Reason as Judge in
spiritual matters,) out of which Apostasy there is no Redemption, till people
come to own and obey the sufficiency of God's Grace in their hea^^s, (their
only Teacher, ^^it. 2.11, 12. which bears Witness against all sin.) God having
said, unto the Apostle Paul, My Grace is sufficient for thee. 2 Cor. 12.9. And
Paul committed the Saints to the Grace of God generally in his Epistles. The
Teachers in England do so likewise (in words) to their hearers. And Kings also
acknowledge, it is by Gods Grace they are Kings: Therefore it is the one thing
needful, and was Mary's choice, and it is the same at this day, unto all that
are willing and obedient to the guidance thereof, in the whole course of their
Lives, which has several other names in the Scripture, as Light, Word, Spirit,
etc. but is but one eternal, pure Substance, Enlightening every man that comes
into the World, John. 1.9. And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, shall
suffer persecution. 2. Tim. 3.12. Then it seems that Persecutors were ever
blind, 2 Cor. 4.4. Though they may read, That Faith is the Gift of God, And
whatsoever is not of Faith is sin. Romans 14.23. Notwithstanding many thousands
have been murdered or Martyred, since the Apostles time, (or beginning, when
men began to force their Faiths,) upon the account of opinions in Religion,
upon such as had faith in Christ Jesus, Act. 10.35. Heb. 12.1. Acted and done
by such as professed themselves to be Christians, or some faith in God, (even
to the shame of the name of Christians amongst both Jews and Turks.) Some they
have cut in pieces in cool blood, some burned to death, Bellies ripped open
whilst alive, some buried alive, roasted, upon Spits, boiled to death, with
several other Torments; some hanged, and some ba^^^^ed in New England, (in
^^^age,) some thousands it Old-England have been excommunicated and imprisoned;
some imprisoned to death, some banished, some knocked on the Head, whole
Families undone, all their goods taken from them, only because of their meeting
together (most peaceably) to worship God in Spirit and in Truth, as God
requires, John 4.24.

Which is hard-Measure, to be inflicted upon such Christians, as lives
peaceably with all men, Romans 12.18. upon such as was always willing, and still
are to Give unto Caesar (or civil Magistrate) the things that are Caesar 's, Mat.
22.21. and unto God the things that are Gods. The things which may be said to
be Gods, or of God, is to worship and serve him in Spirit and in Truth, as
aforesaid; to live in his fear by departing from iniquity, and to seek after
the good of all men, to live in all Christian virtues, to do unto all people as
we would be dealt with, Matthew. 6.12, which cannot be performed by any, but as
they obey the teachings of Gods Spirit in peoples hearts, the Leader into all
good, (the same that made David wiser than all his Teachers, Psalm. 119.99. Isa.
30.20. Heb. 8.11.) and is a swift witness against every evil thought, word and
deed, in every Conscience, Obedience to which makes people happy for ever, 1 Samuel 15.22.

But what person soever pretends, that Conscience or the Light therein is his
guide, and acts any thing destructive to Civil Society, as Theft, Murder, or
Adultery, or are Traitors, or Plotters, or Drunkards, or Cheats, or Vagabonds,
or Mischievous Persons, G^^. 5.19, 20. To all such the Ch istian Magistrate
will be a terror, and a praise to them that do well, Romans 13.3. if they be of
Christ's Religion; for he did not compel his Brethren after the flesh, to his
Religion, John 7.5. Yet did he and his Apostles bear a Testimony against all
fair-sayers and hypocrites in Religion, and left the Civil Magistrates to
punish all open wickedness; to which agrees King Charles the 1st, in the
Collection of his Speeches, page 91, 123. In point of Conscientious tenderness,
I have often declared, how little I desire my Laws and Scepter should entrench
on God's Sovereignty, which is the only King of men's Consciences; nor do I
desire any man should be further Subject unto me, than all of us may be subject
unto God. -- And in his advice to the then Prince of Wales, now King of
England, etc. Your Prerogative is best showed and exercised in remitting,
rather than exacting the rigor of the Laws, there being nothing worse than
Legal Tyranny, etc.

But says Christ Jesus, Therefore whosoever hears these sayings of mine, and
does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a Rock,
Matthew. 7.24. And does them, (mark that) do thou love them that hate thee?
etc. The God of Israel said, the Rock of Israel spoke to me, he that rules
over men must be just, ruling in the fear of God. 2 Samuel 23.3.21.15. Now the
Jews accounted the appearance of Christ Jesus in the Flesh, as low, and too
mean for them, saying, is not this the Carpenter's Son, and despised him,
Matthew. 13.55.

Even so do too many called Christians, at this (...) account his 2d coming,
(...) ^^iritual appearance, too low and mean for them to bow unto; that is, his
Light or Grace in their hearts, which reproves for Sin, calling it a dark
Light, or the Light of a Natural Conscience, and a misguiding Light, etc.
accounting it not sufficient to save from the evil of the World, and so make
merry over, and crucify afresh the just Spirit or Witness of God in their
hearts, by wilful kicking against it: Pro. 4.18. John 3.20.16.8. Romans 3.24.
Tit. 3.7. Rev 1, 5.3.14. But blessed be the Lord God, there is a small remnant
(in this day,) that are come to witness in their hearts, that little Stone,
Dan. 2.34, 44. cut out of the mountain without hands, which shall grow, and
fill the whole Earth with Righteousness, and lay every Idol in the dust,
notwithstanding all the Opposition, Art, Wisdom, or Violenc^ of men or Devils;
God will arise more and more in his spiritual appearance (in the hearts of
People) until he has conquered the enemies to Righteousness, and the Glory of
the Lord cover the Earth, as the Waters cover the Sea; and happy will all they
be, that meet him timely, by turning from the evil Imaginations of their
hearts, and submit to his Grace, the way to him; for he is worthy to reign and
rule in every heart and Conscience, (by his Spirit or Grace therein) now and
for ever.

If any man say, I love God, and hates his Brother, he is a liar; for he that
loves not his Brother whom he has seen, how can he love God, whom he has not
seen? 1 John 4.20. In which Love I offer this my Mite for Love and Peace-sake,
desiring the good of all people impartially, hoping that no longer the hedges
of Opinions may bar us from loving one another, with the same love that God
does love us: And that many People may go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to
the Mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob (his Light or Grace
in every Conscience) and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
paths, Isa. 2.3. To which all those that truly fear the Lord God, will say,
Amen.

And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my Body
to be burned, and have not Charity, it profits me nothing. 1 Cor. 13.3.

To conclude, as things are now in the World, it seems to me, that no
Protestant will evermore become a Persecutor, (for Conscience sake) they having
seen the Judgments of God always following upon People and Nations for
Persecution; for Persecutors striving to separate the Tares from the Wheat,
have taken too much upon them, (to ascend God's Throne-Conscience) it being the
Work of the Angels, to separate the Tares from the Wheat in the time of
Harvest, at the last day, Matthew. 13.41.

1. Cain for persecuting godly Abel, was made a Vagabond, etc. 2. Ishmael for
mocking his Brother Isaac, was cast out. 3. Joseph's Brethren were punished by
famine and distress, who persecuted him. 4. Pharaoh and the Egyptians were
drowned for persecuting the Children of Israel. 5. Ahab and his house were
destroyed, who persecuted good Micah the Prophet. 6. Jezabel, who slew many of
the Prophets, was eaten up by Dogs. 7. King Joash was slain in his Bed, who
persecuted Zachariah. 8. Haman the informer, who persecuted Mordecai, and the
Jews, was hanged. 9. The Priests that persecuted Daniel, was eaten up by Lions.
10. King Antiochus was destroyed with worms, which he confessed came upon him
for persecuting the Jews, and other evils. 11. Herod, who sought to destroy
Christ, and put to death the Children in Bethlehem, was smitten of God, with a
rottenness in his bowels, and Worms, whereof he dyed. 12. Pilate, that wicked
Governor, under whom Christ was crucified, killed himself. 13. If Histories
speak true, few or none of the persecuting Roman Emperors dyed in their Beds.
14. Judas the other Informer (some say) hanged himself. 15. Dr. Dunning,
Chancellor of Norwich, a persecutor, dyed suddenly. 16. Bp. Thornton a
Persecutor, seeing some of his Men playing at Bowls on a Sunday, (so called)
fell suddenly into a Palsy, and being had to bed, he was put in mind to
remember God, Yea, said he, I do, and my Lord Cardinal too; and so dyed. Much
more might be mentioned of the sudden Deaths of Persecutors in Queen Mary's
days. 17. Dr. Story, a bloody Persecutor in Queen Mary's time, was hanged in
Queen Elizabeth's time.
Multitudes of Presidents more might be given from the Records of Histories, to
this day, of Gods Judgments upon the Persecutors; but for brevity sake I shall
omit, believing that no Protestant now is of a persecuting Spirit, they having
seen it to be the Rock upon which Governments have split, and whole Nations and
Kingdoms ruined thereby: Therefore it may be good for all Persecutors in this
day, to remember the Counsel of Gamaliel, Act. 5.38, 39. Now, I say unto you,
refrain from these men, and let them alone; for if this Counsel, or this work
be of men, it will come to naught; but if it be of God, you cannot overthrow
it, lest happily you be found fighters against God.

And also the Counsel of Athanasius, (whom the Papists have trusted) says he,
(as before mentioned,) It is the property of piety, not to force, but to
persuade, in imitation of our Lord, etc. Constraining none coming to him, and
knocking rather, and saying, My Sister, my Spouse, open to me, etc. and
enters when he is opened to, and retires if they delay, and will not open
unto him; because it is not with Swords, nor Darts, nor Soldiers, nor Armor,
that Truth is to be declared; but with persuasion and Counsel. And it is
observable, that it was the impious Arians, who first of all brought in this
doctrine, to persecute others, among Christians, whose Successors both Papists
and Protestants are, in this matter, (says R. B. p. 358.) whom Athanasius thus
reproves further: Where (says he) have they learned to persecute? Certainly
they cannot say, they have learned it from the Saints; but this has been given
them, and taught them of the Devil. The Lord commanded indeed sometimes to
flee, and the Saints sometimes fled; but to persecute is the invention and
argument of the Devil, which he seeks against all. And after he says, In so
far as the Arians banish those that will not subscribe their Decrees, they
show, that they are contrary to Christians, and friends of the Devil. See
Athan. in Epist. ad Solit. Vit. and Apol. 1. de fuga sua, Tom. 1.

In the great day, Then shall the King say to them on his Right hand, come ye
blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you, etc.

For I was an hungered, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me
drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in; naked, and ye clothed me; I was
sick, and ye visited me; I was in Prison, and ye came unto me.

Then shall the Righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an
hungered, and fed thee? etc.

And the King shall answer, and say unto them, verily I say unto you, In as
much as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my Brethren, ye have
done it unto me. Matthew. 25. v. 34. to the end.

-- He is not ashamed to call them Brethren. Heb. 2.11.

What portion can they expect, that uncloath the Righteous, and that take their
meat from them, and instead of visiting of them in Prison, cast them into
Prison, etc.

-- The time comes (says our Savior) that whosoever kills you, will think
that they do God service* And these things will they do unto you, because they
have not known the Father, nor me. John 16.23.

-- But blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall
say all manner of evil against you, falsely, for my sake.

Rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in Heaven; for so
persecuted they the Prophets which were before you.-Mat. 5.11, 12.

Whosoever is wrong, the Persecutor is not in the right, most People conclude,
by the Witness for God in their hearts, are made sensible of.

Says Jer. Tailor, D. D. (so styled) Chaplain in Ordinary to His late Majesty,
in his Discourse of the liberty of Prophesying. Let all errors be as much, and
as zealously suppressed as may be; but let it be done by such means as are proper
Instruments of their suppression, by preaching and disputation, by Charity a^^
sweetness, by Holiness of Life, assiduity of exhortation, by the Word of God,
and Prayer.

For these ways are most natural, most prudent, most peaceable, and effectual;
only let not men be hasty, in calling every disliked Opinion by the name of
Heresy, and when they have resolved that they will call it so, let them use
the erring person like a Brother, not beat him like a Dog, or convince him with
a Gibbet, or vex him out of his Understanding or persuasion, etc.

With much more to the same purpose.

when they are in the place of prophesying, pray the Lord to direct their
Tongues; but in the mean (...), shutting up the way of the holy Spirit, they
determine to say nothing but what they have written. O unhappy King of
Prophets, yea, and truly cursed, which depend not upon Gods: Spirit, but upon
their own writings or meditation! Why prayest thou to the Lord, thou false
Prophet, to give thee his holy Spirit, by which thou may speak things
profitable, and yet thou repellest the Spirit? Why preferrest thou thy

Mahomet, who prohibited all reason or discourse about Religion, as occasioning
factions and divisions, and indeed those that press persecution and deny
Liberty of Conscience, do thereby show themselves more the Disciples of
Mahomet, than of Christ, and that they are no way followers of the Apostles
Doctrine, who desired the Thessalonians, 1 These. 5.21. to prove all things, and
hold fast that which is good. And also says, unto such as are otherwise
minded, God shall revealit, Phil. 3.15. Not that by beatings and Banishments it
must be knocked into them, R. Bar. Apol. aforesaid, p. 362.

Luke 9.55. The Son of Man is not come to destroy men's Lives, but to save them.

The Ceremonies used by the Jews in their crucifying of Christ Jesus, and some
Malefactors.
FIrst, The Judges and the Witnesses did (when Sentence was pronounced) put
their hands upon the condemned persons head, Drus. praeterit. Mat. 27.
and said, Thy blood be upon thine own Head. Unto this the People had
reference, saying, His blood be on us, and on our Children, Mat. 27.25.

Secondly, In the time of Execution, they would give a Malefactor a grain of
Frankincense in a cup of Wine; this they did give to cause a giddiness in the
condemned persons head, that thereby he might be the less sensible of the pain.
Saint Mark calls this cup, Wine mingled with Myrrh, Mark 15.23. This was
done after the manner of the Jews; but the Soldiers, in Mockery, mingled
Vinegar and Gall with it, Korot le bona becos schel iaijn Maimon in sanhedrim
c. 13.
Mat. 27.34. As likewise they gave him a second cup in Derision, when they took
a sponge, It Moses Kotsens in san hedrim.
and filled it with Vinegar, and put it on a reed, Mat. 27.48.

Thirdly, The manner of the Cross, on which Christ was crucified, was like this
figure,, his Hands nailed to each side, and his Feet nailed together to the
bottom of the Cross, almost. And Jesus said unto Thomas, reach hither thy
Finger, and behold my Hands, etc. Joh. 20.27. Psalm. 22.16. Even so do many (in
this day,) Crucify afresh the Son of God, and put him to open shame. Heb. 6.6.
By resisting and doing despite unto his Spirit of Grace in their hearts,
wilfully running into evil, (whilst they profess Christianity,) committing the
sins of Sodom, Genesis 19.5. Crucifying in Sodom and Egypt spiritually, etc.

Fourthly, Sometimes in notorious offenders, to augment the pains (of those
that they whip, Eustathius, item Athenaeus, Lib. 4.
) they tied certain huckle bones, Tholosan synt. Jur. univers. lib. 31.
or plummets of Lead, or sharp Thorns to the end of the Thongs, and such
Scourges; the Greeks termed Flagra Taxillata; in the Scripture they are termed
Scorpions; My Father has chastised you with rods, but I will correct you with
scorpions. 1 Kings 12.12.

The manner of their stoning to death the rebellious Sons, Witches, etc.
THe Offender was led to a place without the Gates two Cubits high, his Hands
being bound, from hence one of the Witnesses tumbled him by a stroke upon the
Loins; if that kill him not, the Witnesses lift up a stone, being the weight of
two men, which chiefly the other Witness casts upon him; Paul fagius, Deuteronomy.
17.7.
if that kill him not, all Israel throw stones upon him. The hands of the
Witnesses shall be first upon him, to put him to death, and afterward the
Hands of all the people, Deuteronomy. 17.7.

The manner of their strangling of such as lies with another Man's Wife, or
that smites his Father or his Mother, etc,
THe Offender was put in dung up to the loins, a Towel being cast about his
neck, [Paraphrast. Chald. Ruth. 1.17. Milkkotsi. fol. 183. col. 3.
which two Executioners, one on each side, plucked to and fro, until he was
dead, which they accounted the easiest kind of death.

Restitution for Goods stolen, the Law of God.
IF the Theft, whether Ox or Sheep, were found alive upon a man, he restored
but double, Exodus 22.4. But if they were killed, or sold, then five Oxen for an
Ox, and 4. Sheep ^or a Sheep, Ex. 22.1. The Jews were so precise in this kind,
that if they had built an house with a Beam or piece of Timber unjustly gotten,
they would pull down the house, and restore the same Beam or piece of Timber to
the Owner. David Nimchi.
From this the Prophet Habakkuk does not much dissent: The Stone shall cry out
of the wall, and the Beam out of the Timber shall answer it, Hab. 2.11.

Among the Jews he ought to be sold, that was not of sufficient worth to make
Restitution, Exodus 22.3.

And Augustine says of Christians, ( Aug. Epist. 54.) That he which does not
make restitution, according to his ability, never repented. And Non remittetur
peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum.

No doubt, but that if this Law was practiced in England, we should not have so
many Thieves; for to be sold as slaves for stealing, is more terrible than
Death, (that are so desperate to cry, A short Life and a sweet.) And so may
have time to see their folly, and may become new Creatures, and steal no more,
rather to work with their hands, Ephesians. 4.28. But if they become honest, and not
able to work, they will be maintained by those that fear the Lord, Deuteronomy. 28.48.

Phylacteries, that the Pharisees wore upon their Arms.
THey made broad their Phylacteries, and enlarged the borders of their
Garments, Mat. 23.5. It is said that they were parchment, upon which was
written some of the Law, as the ten Commandments, etc. The Command was general,
Mos. Kotensis. praec. offir. 22.
Ex. 13.9. It shall be for a sign unto thee, upon thine hand, and for a
memorial between thine Eyes; So that it was not the wearing of them, which our
Savior (did then condemn) but the making of them broad, whereby they would
appear more holy than others; some wore them on their foreheads.

Because the Pharisees superstitiously conceited, that by them as by Amulets,
Spells and Charms, hanged about their necks, themselves might be preserved from
danger, Hierom testifies, that the Pharisees had such a conceit of their
Ornaments: Chrysostom. and Hier. in Mal. 2.3.
in which place he compares them to certain superstitious Women of his time,
The Priest under the Law wore white Garments, Levit. 16.4. But the white
clothing of a Christian is a meek and a quiet Spirit, etc. 1 Peter 3.4. Rev.
19.8. and 4.4, 18. See page 256.
who carried up and down upon the like ground, short sentences ou^ of the new
Testament and Relics of the Cross the same superstition has prevailed with
many o^ latter times, who for the same purpose hang the beginning of St. John
about their necks, and in the year of our Lord 692 certain Sorcerers were
condemned for the lik^ kind of Magic, by the name of Phylacterians see T.G.
civ. and Eccl. Rite lib. 2. chapter 4. As Christian in the consecration of their
Churches (says he make special choice of some particular Saints by whose names
they call them, as St. Peter Church, St. Paul's, St. Andrews, etc. so the
Idolatrous Israelites consecrated their Groves unto particular Idols, etc. (no
good example to Christians) howbeit the most high dwells no in Temples made
with hands, Isa. 66.1, 2. Act 7.48. and 17, 24. Says the Lord, and to him will
look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite Spirit, and trembles at my
word. 1 Cor. 6.19. your Body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, (the Lord Supper)
Behold, I stand at the door, and knock i^ any man hear my voice, and open the
door, I will com^ in unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me Rev. 3.20.
Happy is he that opens his heart to the knocks, or reproofs of Gods Grace,
shall overcome the evil, and sit with God upon hi^ Throne, and live with Christ
Jesus for ever and ever; this is the plain truth, open and free unto all the
obedient, of what Nation soever; as Sergeant Jefferies well said, in these
words at the Trial of Stephen College, viz. Truth is not confined to places,
nor Persons neither, but applied to all honest men, be they Irish men or others.

Lastly, Herod's Temple (which was the second Temple) about 40 years in
building, was set on fire by Titus his Soldiers, that it could not be quenched
by the industry of man, at the same time the Temple at Delphi being in chief
request among the Heathen People, Genebrard Chro. l. 2. Anno Chr. 69. Theodore
l 3. c. 11. sozomenus lib. 5. cap. 19.20.21.
was utterly overthrown by Earthquakes, and Thunderbolts from Heaven, and
neither of them could ever since be repaired; the concurrence of which two
miracles evidently shows (says T. G.) that the time was then come, when God
would put an end both to Jewish Ceremonies, and Heathenish Idolatry, that the
Kingdom of his Son might be the better established.

Notwithstanding, many called Christians* do still build outward Temples;
setting them East and West, as Solomon's Temple, when Gods Temple is in an
humble and contrite Spirit, Isa. 57. see page 267.

How to make Soap, called Ball Soap, that will be white.
TAke 4 or 5 Bushel of the ashes of Fearn, (the Fearn having taken no wet, nor
too ripe) Wood Ashes one peck, and three pecks of Lime, put these into a tub
that has holes in the bottom, (stopped with spickets) on these holes lay straw
(in the tub) then put boiled water to the Ashes, and the next day let the water
run out, boil this water in a furnace about 24 hours, or until it be thickish,
that it will receive tallow; put in the tallow (being shred) by degrees,
stirring it continually with an Iron Ladle, and if it thicken fast, put in
tallow faster and faster, for fear it burn, for then all is spoiled, then stir
it with a wooden spade (being so thick, that the Ladle will not do it) let the
fire then slake, but stir it still (which is as much as a man can well do then)
take it out as fast as you can, into a cloth that lies in a tub, wrap it up,
that it cool not too fast, take it out by hand-fulls, and weight it into
quarterns, or half pounds, and work them into Balls; so make a bigger or lesser
quantiry.

How to make Starch for Linen.
TAke the Bran of the finest Wheat, steep it in water 2 days, then let the
water run through 2 or 3 fine Sieves, then put the water in a broad Earth dish,
and set it in the Sun, or over a gentle heat of coals, until it be dry, and it
is fit for use.

Here follows the form of a Test, which may be necessary for all men to
subscribe publicly before a Justice of Peace (once a year) or nearest Justice,
(which will prove as binding as an Oath can be) and being some people cannot in
good conscience break Christ's Commands, who has Commanded not to swear at all,
Mat. 5.34, 35, 36, 37. James 5.12. their yea or nay may serve, which will
secure the Government, as well, if not better, than all Oaths, if all could
swear (as the late times may witness) for he that is found to be a plotter
against the King (let his Religion be what it will) there is a law in England
to hang him, then that law keeps the Government safer than all Oaths, etc.

I. A B. do solemnly, and in good conscience, in the sight of God and Man
acknowledge and declare, that King Charles the Second is lawful King of this
Realm, and all the Dominions thereunto beloging, and that neither the Pope, nor
See of Rome, nor any else by their Authority have right in any case to depose
the King, or dispose of his Kingdom, or upon any score whatever to absolve his
Subjects of their Obedience, or to give leave to any of them to Plot or
Conspire the hurt of the Kings Person, his State, or People, and that all such
pretenses and power are false, pernicious, and damnable; and I do further
sincerely profess, and in good Conscience declare, that I do not believe, that
the Pope is Christ's Vicar, or Peter's lawful Successor, or that he, or the Sea
of Rome, severally or jointly are the Rule of Faith, or Judge of Controversy,
or that they can absolve Sins: nor do I believe there is a Purgatory after
Death, or that Saints should be prayed to, or Images in any sense be worshipped;
nor do I believe that there is any Transubstantiation in the Lords Supper, or
Elements of Bread and Wine at, or after the Consecration thereof by any Person
whatsoever; but I do firmly helieve that the present Communion of the
Roman-Catholick-Church is both Superstitious, and Idolatrous; and all this I do
acknowledge, intend, profess and declare without any equivocation, or reserved,
or other sense then the plain and usual signification of these words according
to the real intention of the Lawmakers, and the common acceptance of all true
Protestants, signed A B.

Obj. They object (says R. B.) that Christ did swear, and we ought to imitate
him.

Ans I answer, that Christ did not swear; and albeit he had sworn, being yet
under the Law, this would no ways oblige us under the Gospel, Hier, lib. Ep.
part 3 tract. 1. Ep. 2. R B. Apol p. 394. 398.
as neither Circumcision, or the Celebration ofthe Paschal Lamb, concerl ning
which, Hierom says, al things agree not to us, who are Servants, that agreed
to our Lord, etc. The Lord swore, as Lord, whom no man did forbid to swear, but
unto us, that are Servants, it is not lawful to swear, because we are forbidden
by the law of our Lord. Yet lest we should not suffer scandal by his example,
he has not sworn, since he commanded us not to swear.

And says Pythagoras, let no man call God to witness by an Oath, no not in
Judgment; but let every man so accustom himself to speak, that he may become
worthy to be trusted even without an Oath; Quintilianus takes notice, that it
was of old a kind of Infamy, if any was desired to swear, but to require an
Oath of a noble man, was like an examining him by the hangman.

This Doctrine of Christ is so strictly laid down, as that no room is left for
the least objection, as is evident in these very words, Swear not all; But
above all things, my Brethren swear not, etc, which was the Judgment of many
Martyrs, in Q. Mary's days, and before, see Eusebius Relations, Justin Martyr
Ap. 2. Tertullian Ap. cap. 32. Clemens, Origin, Athanas. in pass. and cruc.
Dom. Christi, Chrysostom. in Genes. homil. 15. Idem homil. in Act Apost. cap 3
Beda in Jac. 5. Anselmus in Matthew. 5. Waldenses, Viclevus, Erasmus in Mat. 5.
and in Jac 5. A multitude more witnesses might be produced, whose faith was
against all swearing, see R. Barclays Apology aforementioned, see p. 273 in
this Book.

Whoso loves Instruction, loves Knowledge, but he that hates reproof is

Every Child is known by his doing, whether his work be pure, and whether it be

Withold not Correction from thy Child, for if thou beatest him with the Rod,
he shall not die.

A wise Son makes a glad Father, but a foolish Son is the heaviness of his

Lord give me Wisdom to direct my ways.
I beg not Riches, nor yet length of days.
Be well advised, and wary Counsel take.

Never to gather Wealth through fraud presume,

Grasp not for Honor, wish no blazing Glory.

4.13. Ephesians. 4.7. John 1.4.

[To believe, and obey the Spirit of God, which he has sent into the world,
placed in Men's hearts, which convinces and reproves for Sin, is the only way
and means which God has ordained for the restoration, life, and salvation of
Mankind, and is indeed the Christ of God, which in Scripture has many names,

[No opinion, or profession of Religion, etc. where evil thoughts, and evil
doings stands, avails any thing, W. S. page 25.]

trust to Man's teachings? 1 John 2.27. Heb. 8.11. Isa. 30.21. Romans 14.12. 2 Pet.
1.19.

Answer.

God has given me, and all people a teacher within us, that is, he will teach
his People himself by his Grace in our hearts, being many go astray that trust
to Man's teachings, John 6.45, 14, 26. Isai. 2.22, 48, 17. Rev. 3.20. Heb. 8.10,

1.19.

Answer.

Yes, it is Mary's choice, and God said unto Paul, my Grace is sufficient for
thee, 2 Cor. 12.9.

[Do not Kings acknowledge, that it is by Gods Grace they are Kings, and the
Teachers in England often say to their Hearers, we commit you to Gods Grace, as
Paul generally did the Churches, in his Episties to them, therefore it is the
one thing needful.]

Question.

What will be the end of wicked Children and Liars, if they do not mend? Ezekiel.
33.11. Rev. 21.8. Romans 6.23.

Answer.

They must be turned into fire and brimstone in Hell for ever, Matthew 8.12.
Mal. 4.1. Ephesians. 5.6.

Question.

Wilt not thou pray to God to be delivered from evil, that thou may escape
Hellfire, and dwell in Heaven with God for ever? Acts 10.2.

Answer.

Yes, being Christ Jesus has said, suffer little Children to come unto me,
therefore I should always pray in my heart to this effect, Mat. 19.14. Luke
18.1.

O Most Merciful God and my Creator, make me to remember thee now in the days
of my Youth, I humbly pray thee, to incline my heart more and more to take heed
unto thy word in my heart, that daily reproves, and troubles me, for every evil
thought, word, and deed, and stirs me up to good things, so shall I be enabled
to praise thy name here on Earth, that I may dwell with thee in thy Kingdom of
Heaven, for ever and ever, Amen. John 16.8.13.

[ Good thoughts are of Gods own begetting, and very comfortable to a
Christian, and are the fruit and effect of keeping and obeying the Law of God
within the heart, Romans 2.14, 15. W, S. page 27.]

Question.

Now if thy heart be inclined to pray continually, thou will hunger and thirst
after Righteousness, and will always in thy heart give thanks unto God, at the
receiving of meat and drink, and all other of Gods Mercies, though thou do
not express it in words, except God shall require it of thee for the
edification of others, Matthew. 5.6. 1 Timothy 2.8. Ephesians. 6.18.

Answer.

Truly, when my mind is still and out of earthly thoughts, I find inclination^
to pray always, and also a hungering, and thirsting after Righteousness,
Christ Jesus has said all such are blessed, and as God said unto Cain, if thou
do well, shall thou not be excepted? and if thou do not well, sin lies at
thy door, Genesis 4.7.

Question.

Let me hear our Lords Prays.

Answer.

OUr Father which art in Heaven, Hallowed be thy name, thy Kingdom come, thy
will be done in Earth, as it is in Heaven, give us this day our daily Bread,
and forgive us our Trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us, and
lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, Amen.

A few words to those that are minded to impose upon Conscience.
Question.

Does not the old Serpent move in People to persecute for Religion. Heb.
10.29.2 Cor. 4.4. Rev. 12.14.

Answer.

Yes, He works in many that are of a self interest, that cannot rest from
compelling others (more Righteous than they) to some outward observation,
ceremony, or opinion, before others see it their duty so to do. John 15.20.

Question.

Then is it not the same Spirit that put the Martyrs to Death, as at this day,
that seeks to force others to their opinions? Exodus 23.2. Rev 12.11.17.

Answer.

Yes, it is the same Spirit that forces; for the true Christians only persuade
in the love of God, Romans 14.4, 13. 1 John 4.20.

Question.

Are all true Christians, that chiefly mind the Grace of God in their hearts,
though they do not practice the Ceremonies of Men? Col. 2.8. Phil. 3.5.

Answer.

Yes, for all People of every Nation that fears God, and works Righteousness,
it is by this Grace that they perform good things, and such do find acceptance
with God, neither can such seek to enforce others to their faith any more, than
Christ Jesus did his Brethren after the flesh, to believe in him, John 7.5.
Acts 10.35.

Question.

Are not most people in this day striving by one way or other to enforce others
into their faith; by what means shall People come to be of one heart? Jer.
32.39.

Answer.

Only by every ones keeping to their own measure of Grace in themselves, and
none to exalt themselves above their measure received of God, and none to be
drawn from the obedience thereof by any man's words or actions, lest their
portion be with the young Prophet, whom the old deceived, 1 Kings 13.18. Jere.
9.4.

Question.

May we by an outward force seek to deliver our selves from imposition? Romans
8.31. Romans 12.19.

Answer.

No, all true Christians will love their Imposers, and obey the Magistrate in
all things that are due to Caesar, Matthew 22.21. Acts 4.19.

[ The true worship of God stands not in any outward observation of time or
place, or any bodily exercise therein; but in doing the will of God, bowing in
his Spirit, and obeying the voice thereof, W. S. page 43.

Question.

Does God accept of the several Religious performances of People in these days?
John 4.24.

Answer.

Those that wait not to f eel Gods Spirit leading them into those performances
or duties, find no more acceptance with God, than the offerings of the lame,
and the blind did in the first Covenant, Jude 30. Romans 8.26.

Question.

What is the work of the true Ministers? Acts 28.18.

Answer.

To remind People to take heed unto their only Teacher, Gods Grace in their
hearts, and such will not desire People to follow them any further than they
follow Christ; and their holy Conversation, wins more to God than their
Preachings, Job 36.22. 1 Cor. 11.1. 2 Peter 1.9. Heb. 8.11.

A Cloud of Witnesses might be produced to prove, that no force ought to be
used to drive People into this, or the other Religious opinion before the Lord
by his Grace in their hearts manifests to them, that it is their duty to
conform; For what is not of Faith is sin, Romans 14.5, 23.

A few Witnesses here follow.

Jeremiah Tailor, (once) Chaplain to King Charles the first, said,

I being most of all troubled that men should be persecuted and afflicted, for
disagreeing in such opinions, which they cannot with sufficient grounds obtrude
upon others necessarily, because they cannot propound them infallibly.

Dr. Stilling fleet (once) Chaplain to King Charles the second, in a Sermon
before the King, Anno 1674/5 says,

To be a Christian was not to fight for the faith, but to live by it, not to
quarrel for good works, but to practice them; in short, to be a Christian was
to depart from iniquity, and to do good, to be meek and humble, and patient,
and peaceable toward all men, to be charitable and kind, to be sober and
temperate in all things, to be holy, sincere, and innocent in his actions
toward God and Man.

Lucernus said, he that commands any thing, wherewith he binds the
conscience, this is an Antichrist, Inde Benuse disp. fol. 71.

Calvin said, that the Apostle gave to understand, that to exercise Authority
over ones faith was in no wise just nor tolerable yea, (said he) it is Tyranny
in the Church; for faith ought to be free from all subjection of men.

Luther, upon 1 Kings 5. In the building of the Temple their was no sound of
Iron heard, to signify that Christ will have in his Church a free and a willing
People, not compelled, and constrained by Laws, etc.

Stephanus, King of Poland said, it belongs not to me to reform the
conscience, I have always gladly given that over to God, which belongs to
him, and so shall I do now; and also for the future, I will suffer the Weeds to
grow until the time of Harvest, for I know that the number of Believers are but
small, therefore said he, when some were proceeding to Persecution, Ego sum Rex
Populorum, non Conscientiarum, that is, I am the King of the People, not of
their Consciences, he also affirmed that Religion was not to be planted with
fire, and Sword, Chron. van. de. Rel. Vriih 2 deel.

Ellis Hooks said in a Book of Martyrs, Paul the Apostle taught, that the
Servant of the Lord must not strive, but must be gentle toward all men,
suffering the evil men, instructing them with meekness, that are contrary
minded, etc. 2 Timothy 2.4.2.

If any Man shall pretend that the Scriptures judge according to his
conceptions or conscience for other men, and that they must take their
religious measures by the line of his direction; such a Person makes himself
greater than either Church, Scripture, or Conscience, W. P. Add to Prove. 148.

Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even
so to them, fur this is the Law and the Prophets, Mat. 7.12.

FINIS.
THE Postscript TO THE READER.
LET none wonder that I call some part of this Book a Primmer for Children;
since my Soul loves innocence, and the true Child's State, and a Primmer only
was my first design, but since so many things are added, I thought good to
entitle it a Manual, therefore, where any has run into bypath upon the barren
Mountains of outside Religion (and true Religion not in the heart, but a talk
of Religion only in the head or tongue) must come and return to this innocent
Child's State, to the Alpha, or the beginning, to the A B C in Christ's School
(Gods Grace in the heart, the just man's path, Prove. 4.18. that reproves for
evil) to have peace in God, so shall their Religion, and learning be in the
substance (Christ Jesus) not shadowy, nor tinctured with heathenish learning,
through Philosophy, and vain deceit, Col. 2.8.

And therefore Reader, apply thy whole heart to Gods Grace therein, and God
will teach thee to profit in all good things who alone can drive away all
darkness and error out of thy heart (and not to be drawn from the obedience of
Gods Grace by any man's words or actions whatsoever, least thy portion be with
the young Prophet, least thy portion be with the young Prophet, whom the old
deceived, 1 Kings 13. not minding his own gift given him of God, before
another) so shall thy mind be fixed, and stayed in the way of righteousness;
and will give unto God all the honor and praise, (from whence alone all good
comes) not unto man, nor any thing of Man, whose imaginations are evil, when
at any time he turns his mind (into his own wisdom) from his true guide (Gods
Word, Spirit, or Grace in his conscience, Psalms 119.9. Isaiah, 30.20.) which
Spirit was the only rule that the Righteous walked by, before the holy
Scriptures were written or printed in paper (the same at this day, blessed be
the Lord God, he has not left himself without a witness for Righteousness in
every conscience) and being written are a Rule, but not the chief Rule, now
they that hold it to be their chief Rule, ought by it to learn to love their
enemies, being it is therein written; but indeed that they cannot do, before
they turn their whole mind and soul to the said chief Rule (Gods Grace) to
receive power also, to be kept (by it) out of the many evils that are in the
world, John 17.15.

But instead of making the Scriptures their Rule, the Priests meanings from the
Scriptures is enjoined for a Rule, which breeds the great disunion (at this
day) therefore if nothing but the Scriptures was read in public places for
worship (for nothing of man's framing, See p. of unifor.
and making is so good) and see how many Dissenters there will be, etc.

And no interpreter, but Gods Talent of Grace in every heart (to himself) by
which People knows good from evil, and by it can also see and discern such as
profess Religion (only) as a Cloak for self-interest, from such as are
Religious indeed, that follow after Righteousness, and seek the good of all
People in general (being Gods Workmanship) that is Godly, dwelling in the same
love one to another, as God has for us all (that would not the death of a
Sinner) in his sending plentiful seasons, etc. Mat. 5.45. For God is holy, just
and good, and without holiness, no man shall see God to his everlasting joy,
and truly happy is that man, that dwells in this innocent love to all the
Creation, he is blessed, let People call him either Papist, Protestant, or
Heretic, or any other name, he is never the worse, the Lord God is on his
side, Gods Name is his strong Tower, and sure hiding place (if he continues in
this love to all People) he will not fear, though ten thousands rise up against
him; for he does not trust in the arm of flesh, Horses nor Chariots, nor go's
to Egypt for help, but his strength and stay is only upon God to deliver him
from all his enemies both within and without; for he that dwells in this Love,
dwells in God, and God in him, 1 John 4.16. and he will assuredly take his Lord
and Masters Counsel, who said, Mat. 5.44. But I say unto you, love your
Enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for
them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.

That ye may be the Children of your Father which is in Heaven, for he makes
his Sun to rise on the evil, and on the good, etc.

For if you love them which love you, what reward have ye, etc.

Note, That all the Rules in this Book are not set in order (as some Books are)
but the Contents or Table at the end will direct to each part, and parts of
each rule and thing; which so happened by reason, that several questions and
things were by me sent to the Press in single papers, and so printed partly as
they came, that some few things, may be twice mentioned, but the errors in
printing I hope thou will amend by thy pen accordding to the errata, and others
that are really so.

I have omitted the fractional parts in several of the Rules and Tables in this
Book; because (if I had inserted them) they would have much puzzled the young
learners, (which some Persons may be ready to cavil at) but the error is so
small, being few Persons matter the measuring of Timber, Board, etc. to an inch
or part of an inch, the which exactness may be learned, after the learner is a
little skilled in the rule of Fractions, in page 42.

In Gaging of Vessels or Barrels in page 29 there was a mistake, therefore
begin at the ninth Line thus.
Or if it be a round Barrel that bellies in the middle, measure the breadth at
bung, and at the head, and add them together, and half thereof multiply into
half the Compass (between the end and the bung) and that product by half the
length of the Barrel, and the product divide by 288 or 289 for Ale or Bear, 231
for Wine, or 272 for Salt or Corn, the quotient shows half the number of
Gallons in the said Barrel, but if the Barrel be wider at one end then the
other, add the breadths together, and half the number of inches is the true
breadth, allowing for the sides of the wood of the Barrel.

Note, That if it is round, and bellies not at all, you may find the product of
inches, by round Timber measure in page 28, and divide it by 289 the inches in
a gallon of Ale (or thereaabouts) and work as before.

How to find the square of a round Timber, stick, or Stone, by Arithmetic,
which you may also do by Gunters line in p. 207.

Always multiply the number 2821, by the inches of the Compass, and cut off 4
figures from the right hand.

Example.

^

See p. 37. For the third figure, or multiply the whole longest doted line, by
half the 2 shorts, being first added together.

The fifth figure, or multiply half the longest side by the dote line.

For the sixth figure being a Circle, or multiply half the Compass by half the
breadth, the product shows the number of flat or superficial Inches, if it be
the end of a Barrel, round Timber, Stone or Land, etc. being round.

See p. 36. The second figure there, may be measured like the 3d figure in p.
37.

Of Bees, p. 276. etc. The best is to smother no Bees, till the latter end of
September, the weather cold, to prevent your Neighbors Bees, that will smell
the Honey, and so may rob your other Bees that are not very strong.

Secondly, if you find that the under Hives, be somewhat too weak in October,
set 2 of them together, the strongest uppermost, or any other weak stock upon
one of them; to be one house.

Rot in Sheep, p. 112. Drench them every month (if need be) also give every
Sheep one mouthful of Hay, before they go out of the fold every dewy morning,
both in Winter, and Summer; and other Cattle, if it be a very wet time.

Remember that Medicines that are good for Men, are also good for Beasts giving
them the bigger quantity; but to save some Charge.

For Rubarb, take Red-dock roots. For Garden Mallow-roots, take the common. For
White Poppy, take Field Poppy. For Lavender Spike, use Garden Lavender. For
Danewort leaves, use Elder leaves. For Vervin, use Bettony. For Balm, use
Horehound. For Mountain Smallage, use the Garden. For Savory, use Field Thyme.
For the leaves of Coriander, use Parsnep leaves. For Navelwort, use Housleek.
For Cypress, use Savine. For Fir-leaves, use the leaves of Popular. For
Acacis, use the juice of Sloes. For Opium, use the juice of Field Poppies. For
Liquorish, use Raisons in the Sun. For juice of Citrons, use Lemons. For Aloes,
use the juice of Wormwood. For Bears-grease, use Fox-grease. For Goose grease,
use Duck, or Hens-grease. For Badgers grease, use Neats-foot-oil. For Antimony
or Lithargy, use burnt Lead. For Spodium, use burnt Hartshorn, or the
contrary, taking the bigger quantity of the weakest, etc.
Lastly, The decoction of the Herb, called Gransel, is good against all
diseases of heat, and binding, both in Men and Beast; and for wind use
Peny-Royal, green or dried.

To make Mead.
When the Honey is run out of the best of the Combs, as in p 282. wash the
Combs in water, and the Honey will quickly out, strain it through a Sieve; now
to know whether the water be strong enough of the Honey, put in a sound Egg, if
it swims, to be seen the breadth of a groat, it is sweet enough; otherwise put
in more Honey; (it may be made any time of the year) when this water is well
settled, take the clearest, and boil it almost a quarter of an hour, with 2 or
three sprigs of Rosemary, skim it often, and when its cold, put Barm to it, and
beat it, and work it like new Ale, then barrel it up, and stop it close, and
after about three or six Months, bottle it up, and it will keep long; it is very
good for the aged, and consumptive Persons.

Of Cider.
AFter your Apples have stood 2 days in Tubs (being stamped) or less time, if
they were mellow before they were stamped. Or if too mellow put water to them;
and for to press out the juice, do thus, take a thick board, almost 2 foot over
both ways, and nail some inch board at the edges thereof, that it may hold
water about 2 Inches high above the board, and cut a natch for it to run out;
then upon the middle of this thick board, nail an inch board, of about 14
inches square, to lay the bag thereon (house little hair bags, and fill them
not too full) the board being ready with the bag thereon; and a thick board on
the bag also, set it near a post in the house, and make a square hole for a
weighty pole to go in to crush the bag, so that by this way two men may press
in an hour, more than I saw any screw-press would do in two; and the charge of
this Press may not be 18 d. If you put into each bottle a lump of loaf Sugar,
the Cider will be the better, and keep longer, being set in a cool place.

Water-Cyder, being a wholesome drink, thus made.
STamp one bushel of Apples any time of the year, and put to them 8 gallons of
water, let them steep one week, and strain them, or take the stampings that you
pressed your Cider out, and put as much water to them as they yielded Cider, let
them steep 2 days or more, then press out the water, and boil it as good bear,
and work it with Barm, and tun it up, and to every gallon, put in one ounce of
Sugar or more; drink it all before 2 Months is past.

Note, that if you boil with the Water-Cyder one peck of Malt, it will be much
better; order it as you do Bear or Ale.

Reader,

I do not write the Medicines in this Book, to get Money, thou may be assured,

them, for they are experiments, and may do much good (if not more) than costly
ones.

11. Ve-nit ad su-a, and su-a non ac-ce-pe-runt eum. 11. He came to his own,
and his own not received him.

12. Au-tem quot-quot ac-ce-pe-runt eum, de-dit eis hoc jus, ut fint fa-cti
fi-li-i D-ei, nem-pe i-is qui cre-dunt in no-men e-jus. 12. But as many as
received him, he gave to them this right, that they might be made the sons of
God, namely to them which believe on the name of him.

13. Qui sunt na-ti non ex san-gui-ne, ne-que ex vo-lun-ta-te vi-ri, sed ex
De-o. 13. Which are born not of blood, neither of the will of man, but of God.

14. Et Ser-mo est fa-ctus Ca-ro, and ha-bi-ta-vit in no-bis, and vi-di-mus
Glo-ri-am e-jus, ut Glo-ri-am U-ni-ge-ni-ti a Pa-tre, ple-nus
gra-tiae-andve-ri-ta-tis. 14. And the Word is made Flesh, and dwelt in us, and
we saw the Glory of him, as the Glory of the only begotten of the Father, full
of grace and Truth.

15. Jo-han-nes te-sta-tus de eo, and cla-ma-vit, di-cens, Hic est de quo
di-ce-bam, is qui ve-nit po-ne me est an-te-po-si-tus mi-hi, qui-a e-rat pri-or
me. 15. John testified of him, and cried, saying this is he of whom I said, he
who came after me is prepared before me because he was before me.

16 Et om-nes ac-ce-pi-mus and gra-ti-am pro gra-ti-a. 16. And we all have
received and grace for grace.

17. Nam il-la Lex da-ta est per Mo-sen; gra-ti-a and ve-ri-tas prae-sti-ta est
per Je-sum Chri-stum. 17. For the Law was given by Moses; grace and truth came
by Jesus Christ.

18. Ne-mo vi-dit De-um un-quam, il-le U-ni-ge-ni-tus fi-li-us, qui est in
fi-nu Pa-tris, il-le ex-po-su-it no-bis. 18. No man has seen God at any time,
the only begotten son who is in the bosom of the Father, he has set him forth
to us

19. E-ti-am hoc est Te-sti-mo-ni-um Jo-han-nis, quan-do Ju-dae-i mi-serunt
Sa-cer-do-tes and Le-vi-tas, ut in-ter-ro-ga-rent e-um, quis-nam ip-se es-set.
19. Also this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent Priests and Levites,
that they might ask him who he was.

20. Et pro-fes-sus, ne-que ne-ga-vit, in-quam, profes-sus est se esse non
il-lum Chri-stum. 20. And he confessed, neither denied, I say he confessed that
he was not that Christ.

21. Tunc in-ter-ro-ga-ve-runt eum, er-go quid es? tu-ne es E-li-as? ve-ro ipse
di-xit, sum non; and illi di-xe-runt, es tu ille Pro-phe-ta? qui re-spon-dit
non. 21. Then they asked him, therefore what art thou? art thou Elias? but he
said, I am not; and they said, art thou that Prophet? who answered no.

22. Er-go di-xe-runt ei, Quis es? ut de-mus re-spon-sum i-is qui mi-se-runt
nos; quid di-cis de te-ip-so? 22. Therefore they said to him, Who art thou?
that we may give an answer to them who have sent us; what say thou of thy
self?

23. A-it, e-go sum vox vo-ci-fe-ran-tis in de-fer-to, com-pla-na-te vi-am
Do-mi-ni, pro-ut I-sai-as Pro-phe-ta di-xit. 23. He said, I am the voice of one
crying in the desert, make straight the way of the Lord, as Isaias the Prophet
has said.

24. Ve-ro qui fu-e-rant mis-si, e-rant ex Pha-ri-sae-is. 24. But they which
had been sent, were of the Pharisees.

Here is enough for the Ingenious for a beginning; then go to the 25th verse in
the Latin Testament, and English it by an English Bible printed in King James
his Reign, and find the English of some hard words in a Dictionary, be perfect
in one verse before you go to another, and so by use, which is the Mother of
Language (as the Schoolmen say) you may be as perfect in the Latin Tongue, as
Travelers learn Languages, (and a little time will perfect you, when you
desire to learn the rules of the Tongue) and indeed few retain more than
Englishing the latin Bible (after 7 years Schooling;) see that you be perfect
in Reading latin words, and for the obtaining of which mind, these latin words,
which follows.

Note, That every verse you learn, write it like the verses as before, which
will imprint it in the memory very much.

If one pound of any thing cost 6 d. what wi^^ one hundred weight cost (that is
112 l.) at the same rate, without pen and ink.

Do thus, saying in 6* d. is 24 farthings, doub^ it, and it is 48, the which
call 48 Shilling lastly, 24 groats is 8 shillings, being added.

Thus 48 half farthings in 6 d. reckon 48 8 being the Groats, for farthings in
6 d.-8

Answ. 56

Do thus for any other price.

How to cast up Sums of Money by Counters, or f^^ things, very useful for those
that never learned write figures.
First, make three marks or choaks upon Table about three inches asunder, like
the

Then let the first mark be supposed to be place of pounds, the second the
place of S^^lings, and the third next the right hand the place of pence; (and
you may make another if you will for the place of farthings.)

Secondly, now to place your several Sums to be cast up, as suppose I begin
with 3 l. 7 s. 3 d. lay down as many Counters at each mark thus, ^

And when you put another Sum to this, as suppose 17 s. with the 7 s. already
makes 24 s. then set one Counter more in the place of pounds, and leave but 4
in the place of shillings, and your sum is 4 l. 4 s. 3 d. and so add more at
pleasure.

Lastly, but if you are to cast up several Sums that are pounds, without
shillings, or pence; then mark upon the Table 4 marks as before.

These being so easy, I need not write much, for further directions, observing
the four places.

^

Read them thus, the three Counters next the left hand, stands for three
thousand, next two hundred, next four tens, or forty, and three at the last,
that is 3243.

Thus you may make the Sum bigger or lesser as you please, even from one pound,
to thousands.

So I hope that whoever can do it, will not grudge to teach their Neighbors
near them (if they desire it) Gratis.

How to divide a square into two parts, according to any proportion assigned,
by a Line drawn parallel to one of the sides.
square divided into two parts

LEt the figure be A, B, C, D, containing 676 Poles, and it is required to cut
off 208 Poles, with a Line parallel to D C, to be said out next unto the same.

First, divide 208 by 26, and the Quotient will be 8, the which distance set
from D to E, and from C to F.

How to divide a Triangle into tw^ parts.
SUppose, that this Triangle is 8 Acres, an^ it is required to draw a Line from
A, divide it into 5 Acres, and three Acres.

triagle divided into two parts

The longest side being 40, work thus, saying, ^

So 25 of the base or longest, cut at D, and draw the Line A D, and 15 for the
other side.

How to divide a Triangle into 5 equal parts, from a point given.
triangle divided into 5 parts

SUppose the given point be at D, first divide the longest side of the Triangle
into 5 ^qual parts, and draw paralleld doted Lines ^^om each part, then from
the given point D, ^raw Lines to divide it, as in the Triangle.

To divide a common field into as many parts, as shall be required.
SUppose a Common of Pasture for the use three men, as A, B, C, and it is
agreed (...) them all, that each man shall have his Propo^tion of Ground laid
out, according to the quantity of his Commons in the same place.

First, measure the whole field, and if it co^tain 35 a. 3 r. 15 p. or 5735 p.
then confid^^ how many Beast-Gates, or Cow-Commons the^^ are in the Pasture,
and divide the quantity (...) the field to them according to the Rule (...)
Proportion, or Rule of Three, in page 1^ saying, If the whole number of
Beasts-gates, (...) Commons of A, B, and C, give the who^^ quantity 5735 p.
what shall the number of the^^ belonging to A be, and the Answer will be (...)
part: So work the parts for B, and C, and t^^ part of A be 1817, to B 1716, to
C 22^ poles.

The field being drawn into a Plot, on ^^per, divide every man's part by the
Geomet^^cal Problems in this Book, and also by the h^^ of the Table in page 188.

How to make a Triangle which shall contain any number of Acres, Roods, and
Poles.
SUppose I make a Triangle, that shall contain 5 Acres, 2 Roods, and 30 Pole,
or ^10 Poles, whose base or longest side must be ^^0 Poles.

how to make a triangle

First, double the number of Poles, and they make 1820, the which divide by 50,
and the Quotient will be 36 2/5, the length of the perpendicular D, B, then
from the Line of equa^ parts in page 164. lay down the Line A, B, equal to 50
Poles, then upon B, raise the perpendicular B, D, equal to 36 2/5 poles, draw
the Line C, D, parallel to A, B, then from the poin^ E, draw the Line E A, and
E B, including the Triangle A E B, which contains 5 Acres 2 Roods, and 30
Poles, as was required.

Note, by the same Rule you may lay out a bigger or lesser.

Quadrant, in page 148.
When you make a Quadrant in Wood.

First, That it may be perfect square at the Center make a square on a piece of
paper by the example in p. 162.

Secondly, Let not the uppermost Arch line be so near the Center, as the
printed Quadrant is.

Thirdly, And let the division on the right, edge of the Quadrant, between the
two arches marked 12, be divided into 14 equal parts, whereas this is 19.

Fourthly, Then from the over arch M, to A* or April set of 6 parts, every part
supposed to be 5 days, and from A. to M. or May six parts more, and the
remaining 2 parts serve for June, and December.

Fifthly, Instead of a Bead, a pins head may serve.

Lastly, To place the rest of the hour lines draw out the string to the degrees
of the Quadrant, and mark for the hours according to the Table; and draw arch
lines for hour lines like the 12 a clock line.

Of the Moons Influence.
Whereas I have mentioned in p. 181. of cutting the Hair, the Moon increasing,
etc. It was rather of custom, then any belief I have in it (being all power is
in God, that a hair of our Head perishes not without his good will, etc. Mat.
10.30.) and though the tide, and some other things happens monthly, the power
is only to be attributed to the providence of God, and not to any created thing
(though all his works are good in their places;) for God will not give his
Glory to another neither would he have man to look up unto the Stars to Idolize
them, least they give that power to them, that belongs to God only, Deuteronomy. 4.19.

And John Gadbury writes of the Moon thus,

The more she fills her forked round.
The more the marrow does in bones abound.
So that by his reason the marrow in the bones also decreaseth, as the Moon
decreaseth; The Moon was worshipped throughout all Asia, and in great esteem
among the Ephesians, whence arose that cry; Great is Diana of Ephesians, Act.
19.28, Macrob, Saturnal, lib. 1. c. 15. The Sun and Moon (says Godwyn, p. 199)
which are the greater lights in the Heaven, I take to have been the chiefest
Idols worshipped by the Heathen people, notwithstanding their blind devotion
deified also the other Planets, etc. of this nature are these Chambers of
Imagery Ez. 8.9. and some are of opinion that the flowing of the Sea is caused
by the Moons warmness when she comes to the South; others hold that the fire
hid in subterraneous stones, in the Sea and Earth, and Saltness of the water,
makes it as it were to boil, etc.
And to manifest what Spirit this Astrologer J. G. is of, by his skill in the
Stars says in his Astrological Observations in Jan. 1681. The pretense of
passive obedience is too stale a cheat to be any longer swallowed, the Law was
made to be obeyed, not to be opposed by a pretense of suffering; and Traitors,
Thieves and Murderers when punished for their misdeeds, are as passively
obedient, as the Nonconforming Brother.

Answer; As to Traitors, Swearers, Drunkards, etc. we know it belongs to the
Magistrates to punish, be it in whom it will, but the Nonconforming Brother,
(be he a just man) he shall be numbered amongst Transgressors, as the Righteous
have been in former Ages saying we have a law, etc. Joh 19.7. And so would
punish the Righteous, (with the wicked, or instead of the wicked) that cannot
but obey God rather then man, as Peter and John did, Acts 4.4. and 5, 28, 29.
If man's law command, not to meet, and speak no more in the name of Jesus (but
when and where we appoint) shall we obey God or Man, judge ye, that are not of
Cains Race, Genesis 4.5, 8. For he slew his Brother, because his Brothers
Sacrifice was accepted, etc.

One would think that the Magistrates might think themselves happy, that God
has placed them as outward Governors, to be a terror to evil doers, and also
to have a people under their Righteous Government, that delight in the Law of
God, and what the Law of God is, and the fruits, thereof, see Psalm. 19.7 to 12.
Mat. 7.12. and 22.37.38. John 13.34. Heb. 8.10. Romans 7.22. and 8. 1 James 2.8.

To the young learners of Arithmetic.
FIrst, Learn to write and read figures, in p. 24. Secondly, Addition in p.
193.33. Thirdly, Substraction in p. 193.58.36. Fourthly, Multiplication in p.
54.193, 187. Fifthly, Division in p, 194.171. Sixthly, Reduction in p.
168.197.34.35, Seventhly, Golden Rule, or Rule of 3, in p. 158, etc. Be perfect
in one Rule before you go to another, (by the much writing them over) So that
when you have learned the 7 Rules aforesaid, you may easily understand (in a
little time) all the other questions in this Book (though no man teach you) if
you live in the fear of God, which is to depart from iniquity, and it is also
the beginning of wisdom, Job. 28.28. So will God teach you to profit, Isa.
48.17.
So Dear Children, my Soul even longs for you, that ye may still keep in your
first Innocence (for none are the Children of wrath, but they who actually join
themselves to the power, and Prince of the Air, Ephesians. 2.2. Romans 4.15. Ezekiel.
18.20.) That you take not of the forbidden fruit of the evil of this world, for
you will find that it is much better for you to remember your Creator, now in
the days of your youth, Eccl. 12.1.

For when once you are grown old in the custom of evil, you will find it hard
returning into Innocence, into a Righteous Life.

Therefore O dear Children apply your whole hearts to Gods Grace therein; it
troubles you after you have been wild or wanton, or done any evil thing (though
no man condemn you) and you will receive Gods Blessing, and your Parents Love:
O prize this Grace above Gold, and all other the delights of this world, for if
you obey it, it will lead you to a greater knowledge of Christ Jesus, who will
be your Savior from all sin, where you shall have durable Treasure, and
possess it for evermore (much better than to have your portion only in this
life, Psalm. 17.14. in the abundance of earthly Riches) to be a door keeper, or
watcher here, Psalm. 84.10. Unto this Grace of God, one day is better than a
thousand elsewhere, and God your Father will give you your daily Bread, to
nourish your Souls, Mat. 6, 11. Psalm. 121.8.

Kings must take Counsel at this Grace of God in their own hearts (the Gate of
Wisdom, Pro. 8.34.) yea, and lay down their Crowns before it, (in which is the
feet of Jesus) if they rule for God, Kings will be nursing Fathers to the
Faithful thereunto, Isa. 49, 22, 23. Hasten this good day more and more, O Lord
our God (which is already dawned) prays the Righteous, for thy name sake that
all people may give unto thee all Glory for ever, Amen.

If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask it of God, that gives to all men
liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.

Who is a a wise man, and endued with knowledge amongst you, let him show out
of a good Conversation his works with meekness of Wisdom, Jam. 1.5. and 3.12.

And unto this people thou shall say, Thus says the Lord, he hold I set before
you the way of Life, and the way of Death, Jer. 21.8. Deuteronomy. 30.11, 12, 13, 14,
15. Romans 10.8.
