THE ENGLISH BALANCE, Weighing the reasons of Englands present Conjunction
with France against the Dutch. With some Observes upon his Majesty's
Declaration, of liberty to Tender Consciences.
THE present aspect of affairs, being obviously such, as not only amuseth all,
but really concerns the greatest part of the Christian World, and my own
proper interest (not more from pure incapacity, then, real choice and
inclination) being most precisely confined, to that of religion, and reason, I
presume, that if by a few sober reflections, I break that common silence of my
Nation (which seems to proceed rather from a deep amazement, then any other
consideration) I shall not therefore incur the censure of singularity; but if
the fate of truth, shall nevertheless expose me to the hatred of any, all I
wish them, is, as little prejudice from their mistake, as I intend of
particular advantage by the following representation.

The subject then that moves me to this undertaking, is, briefly, the allarume
of war, that sounds every where, the tendency of the French. Arms, against
the united Netherlands, and the apparent conjunction of the King of England,
with the French, in this their invasion.

What may be the pretenses of the French, just or unjust, since conjecture (of
all things most dareing) has not hitherto adventured upon the discovery, it
were in vain for me to attempt the research: It is known, that the Estats most
interessed, did address their inquiry unto the French King, who certainly
knows best, and that upon the fairest account, viz. all just and reasonable
satisfaction, and yet, had no other return, save a slender notice, of their
acknowledgement of the favors received from his Antcestors, with a structure,
upon their omission of his own good deeds (no doubt the dividing of the
English Fleet by Beauforts imaginary assistance) and then, a hint at late
innovations in trade, visibly declining reason, by ane insinuat reference, to a
neutral arbitration, without so much as a condescendence upon the subject,
notwithstanding of the satisfaction offered; concluding, with a scrupulous
formalizing at the Estats desire, to be cleared, about their evidently well
grounded apprehensions, of his Majesty's extraordinary preparations, as if it
were boorish incivility, to demand reason abroad, from a Prince that makes his
will to satisfy at home; so that the King of France his tenderness to abuse
truth, and unwillingnesse to derogat from the confidence of his great power, by
searching after a colorable pretext, where there is none to be found, appears
to be the most favorable account, that his procedour will admit of: It Is true,
the advance of his Romish superstition does occur, as a very probable
incentive, but, as both justice does repugne, and Policy dissuade from
declaring it to be the cause, of this apprehended war; so, I confess the
manifest decay, and neglect of religion, every where, this day in the earth,
with his Majesty's not our addiction to his passions, and interests above all
other engagements, do rather incline me to think, that it is the insolent
Tyranny of these imperious Lusts, pride and avarice, that does thus derobe a
great Prince, of his solid glories, and pleasures, and in lieu thereof, with
pain and hazard to himself, and injury to his neighbors, render him a slave to
the motions of his insatiable appetit: But, though the candor I am resolved to
use in this Discourse, does make me thus figure to my self, the French King's
incitements; yet, I am very far from thinking, that the matter of religion is
no more interessed in this war, then intended: To knit the consequences of war,
and victory, either to the declared causes, or influencing reasons of the
undertakers, is, an error, that both reason and the experience of all ages does
abundantly disprove; but why should I here make any profusion of reason, where
common sense may be so convictive? Can Popish Arms prevail, and not establish
Popish superstition? Can this Popish Superstition have power, and not both
prosper and persecute? These are consequences so natural, and evident, that it
were superfluous, either to challenge one instance dissonant, from the
thousands, that confirm them, or to reminde what, and how successefully, the
present French King has (what by force, and what by policy) practiced, in his
own dominions: or lastly, to add, that as the genius of Popery, has ever been
most bent, to seek to reenter where it has been ejected; so it cannot but in
this invasion be animat, by a great accession of vigor, in the hope, thereby
to triumph in the conquest of the main fort, and bulwark of the Protestant
interest: And verily these things are of themselves so obvious, that I almost
blame their conduct, (if only designed for clearing of this point) who of late
have caused Print, a Letter to the Estats, from their Resident in Vienna,
acquainting them with the King of France his intentions, as by him communicate
to the Elector of Mentz, viz. to daunton the pride of the Estats General, and
compel them to the restitution of Ecclesiastic Lands, and goods, and that
assurance hereof, is long since given to the Pope; As if the manifest hazard of
the Protestant Religion, from the French Arms, and their approaches, and its
infallible prejudice in their success, not only as to this restitution, but
the subversion of its truth and purity, did need the accession of such a
conjectural proof? But it is indeed to be regrated, that such at present,
should be the reguardlesse indifferency, in the matter of religion, of the
neighboring Protestant Princes and Estats, that neither the undeniable
evidences of all appearances, nor all the arguments whereby they may be
seconded, seem sufficient, to awake them, from this dangerous slumber: The time
was, when religion, as the most precious concern, was also, the most endearing
bond, of mutual alliance; so that wherever it happened to be attacqued,
neither distance, nor separation of other interests, did exempt, or excuse,
from the common defense; But men have long since, both in their hearts, and
lives, cast it down, from its excellency, and if there it has lost its power,
and influence, no wonder, that it be little operative on public transactions:
Whether for this cause, the Lord be now arisen to contend, first, with these
united Provinces, and thereafter with all the Churches, is no doubt a question,
which every man has reason to move with trembling; my hearts desire is, that
as God by his dispensations, is threatening to punish, as well by the lose of
temporalities, sinfully overvalued, and abused, as by the removeal of his
Gospel, unworthily undervalued, and despised; so, his people may thence be
warned, and instructed above all things, to seek his face, and peace, and
thereby to engage him, to stand on their side, both on his own, and their
behalf, then shall the Lord who waits to be gracious, exalt himself, that he
may have mercy upon them, and join his judgment to the justice of their
cause, to scatter the proud and put down the mighty, that men may see and say,
Surely there is a God that judges righteoush in the earth.

But is it possible that matters standing thus, betwixt the French and Dutch,
and religion being so much concerned, in the event, the King of England should
incline, to take part with the French, so manifestly contrair to righteousness
and religion, yea to his faith, honor, and interest? And really all these (the
maine, if not the only determinations among rational men) do so directly
oppose, and dissuade this strange resolution, that, I sincerely profess, it is
only from the surprise, and distrust of my reason, and not in the least from
any purpose, to amaze men into my sentiments, that my wonder does express
itself, in this interrogation; which, if any man do still judge, to be an
anticipation; let him only forebeare what he censures; and I hope, be shall be
quickly satisfied.

That I may therefore proceed clearly in this odd rancountre of affairs:
Although I do heartily wish, that my supposition may never exist; yet, seeing
it is the ground of the ensueing discourse, he who doubts its probability, may
consider the following passages. First, the King of England his refusal upon
the Estats their just and reasonable demand, to give assurance for the
performing of his part of the Triple Alliance. Next, the known ordinary
discourse of his court, pretending high provocations. 3. Sir George Downing,
his late Embassy, with the unusewall reserve by him practiced, in the exposing
of his demands, his sudden recall, and his refusing to receive the Stats their
answer, unto the memoire he had given in, about the flage 4. the strain of his
Majesty's return to this answer, when thereafter presented to him, whereby he
plainly intimats his displeasure thereat, signifying that though he be willing
to observe the Triple Alliance, yet he does not judge himself thereby obliged,
to suffer them to do what they please, to his prejudice, nor to wrong their
neighbors, in the matter of trade: asserting peremptorily, his soveraignity in
the seas, and withal, demanding their positive answer, whether they will punish
Van Gent for his not striking to his Flage: And lastly the extraordinary
correspondence entertained, betwixt the Courts of England, and France, with
their late Treaty: the several millions of money it has brought from France to
England, and the designed expedition of the Duke of Monmouth, with some
thousands of Auxiliaries, into the french Campaigne; which passages being
joined to the great and fervid sea preparations, wherein England is now
bussied, do in my opinion, sufficiently resolve, that the Dutch are the mark
whereat they are levelled, whether justly or unjustly comes next to be handled?
And certainly, if they have no other motive or end, then the french assistance,
whatever injustice may be, in their causeless invasion, or whatever detriment
Religion may suffer by their success, do fall upon the King of England, as an
assistant, with higher aggravations, then can be fairly named, before that I
do first propose, and examine, the proper provocations, that he pretends:
That, therefore reason and truth, may have their full exercise, and right, my
endeavor shall be, to give an impartial and sincere, account of all, that fame
or report has hitherto communicate on this subject.

That the King of England has of a long time acclaimed, the soveraignity of
the British seas, and therein also been universally acknowledged, by the
formality of striking, is notour over all: and, as it is not my duty,
wilfully to diminish or impugn the former, so, the latter is expressly
agreed to, by the Dutch, in the last treaty of peace: But the difference at
present, arising from this head, seems to be twofold, the first in matter of
fact, viz. that the King of England accuses the Dutch, of an injurious
affront, both against his right, and the late treaty, in as much as their
fleet, under Van Gent's conduct, did of late, refuse to strike sail, to one of
his Jachts, bearing his flage. To which the Dutch answer, that the Kings right
being drawn unto the Treaty, for its better confirmation, it must thence take
all its measures, and it being thereby only provided, that all dutch ships,
shall strike to the King's men of war, in the British seas, as the clear
terms of the Treaty in the 19 Art: thereof, and the quality of the Jacht,
being only a pleasure boat, and no man of war, do furnish a defense for what
is past; so, by their answer above mentioned to Sir George Downings memoire,
they offer, that if his Maj. will observe the Triple Alliance, they will still
agree, that all dutch ships shall strike to his Ships of war; but the King not
herewith satisfied, desires the Estats, to be positive, whether or not they
will inflict punishment on Van Gent? as we have heard: The other branch of this
difference touches the point of right, the King of England asserting
peremptorily, in his above mentioned answer to the Estats, his dominion, and
soveraignity over the narrow seas, and the Duchess, hitherto silently
forebearing, either to debate, or consent to the claim: The next ground of
provocation discoursed of, in the King of Englands court (for as yet it has
proceeded no further) is the making and publishing amongst the Dutch of certain
scandalous pictures, and pamphlets, to the King's dishonor, whereof some, at
least one, viz. the picture dedicat, and affixed by the town of Dort, in the
Stadt-house, to the honor of Cornelius de Wit, in memory of his attacque at
Chattam, bearing the draught of the thing, with certain Lines of Elogy
subjoined, (all no doubt contrived with the luster of advantages suitable to the
design) licensed by authority, and the rest only of private authors, but
publickely permitted, and of this kind (as is reported at court) a pourtrait
of the King of England, surrounded by some ladies of pleasure, bussied in
picking his pockets, is most noticed, and talked of: the third pretense for
war, intimat by the King of England's last answer, above spoken of, wherein he
says, that though he be willing to stand to the Triple Alliance; yet, he is
not thereby obliged, to suffer, either things prejudicial to his own honor, or
them, to do what injuries to their neighbors in matter of trade, that they
think fit; which last passage, is no doubt to be understood of the same
innovations in trade, complained upon, by the King of France, his letter, as we
have said: but what these are, is alike obscure in both, and remain's yet to be
explained.

This being the sum of what I have learned, of the King of England's
provocation: Their import, and merit, is in the next place to be weighed: To
discourse then first the alleged incivility of Van Ghent; I know, it would be
thought ridiculous, for me to endeavor, to accommodat this mistake, by these
Gospel rules of simplicity, meekness, and divine goodness, to offer to square
the actings of Princes, and Stats, in such emergents, by that deference,
forebearance, and readiness to pardon, held forth; in its high and heavenly
precepts, in prejudice of their gross, and vain politics, would be in the
construction of these delicat Spirits, and refined wits, (which deceive
themselves and others, to the foolish admiration, and esteem of things of no
moment,) to trample upon the tender point of honor, and dissolve the noble
frame of interest: neither shall I at this time further urge, the difference
pretended by the Dutch, betwixt a man of war and a jacht; impartialitie must
certainly grant, that the refusing to strike to this vessel, (if in the
British seas) which ten years ago the Dutch had not scrupled to honor as a
man of war, and not much above a hundred years, might possibly have served for
their Admiral, could only have flowed from their late success, and elevation;
but as it is abundantly evident, that, nothing save a fatal misfortune, could
engage either party, to form a quarrel upon this only occasion, and that
without the influence, of far different considerations, the King of England
would not therein, have showed himself so uneasy; so, it must be acknowledged,
that in so light an offense, not destitut, at least of a colorable excuse, the
Dutch their offer of good performance, for the time to come, is as much as in
reason, can be expected: the next point that occurres, is, the King of
England's soveraignity, over the British seas, whereof at present he appears
to be very jealous, and questionless if his Majesty do not content himself,
with the formality of striking, as his sole prerogative, but holds it only for
a mark of due recognisance, asserting withal, his soveraignity indefinitly, as
to all effects, that such a title may import; it is value, does not more deserve
his jealousy, then it is consequences may justly, excit all, to inquire into
his pretenses. I shall not here table the debate, an mare sit liberum an
clausum, the reasons of those learned men, who have managed it, pro and con:
do, in my opinion, very happily compose it, in this reconciliation: that, as
the nature, and end of the seas, do plainly appear, incapable of dominion,
so, in as far as they are destined, and do serve, for common use, the express
or presumptive consent of one people, may qualify, restrict, or renounce the
same, in favors of another; and, thus we see, that wherever dominion over
particular seas, are acclaimed, their effects are not only precisely limited,
but almost every where different, so, to one is given thereby the sole benefit
of fishing, to another a certain tribut, to a third the power of jurisdiction,
and so forth to every one, as restrictedly to the condition of his right, as to
its respective bounds, either of which, if the owner should happen to
transgress, his dominion would be in so far, reput, an insignificant plea; so
that this maritime dominion, not being of the nature of terrene propriety, of
it self absolute, unto all intents, (unless diminished by law or the owners
concession) but merely, a certain privilege, or servitude, established by
consent, in that which of it self, is, as the air, reserved for common use,
it is evident, that the consent, and possession, which constitut the right, do
in like manner define it is extent: And that upon the pretext of some
particularities conceded, to arrogat an unlimited soveraignity, would, both in
reason, and in the event, prove an insupportable usurpation. Hence it is, that
for all England's glorieing, in this, our dignity, and for all the power,
(wherewith no doubt, we both did acquire, and do continue it) yet, it has not
to this day, been further recognosced, even in the Channel, (it is principal
seat and subject, and where it has always affected it is maine Parad: for as
to the other british seas, which are only, the nearest circumambient parts of
the wide Ocean, the Law of nations does only attribut to England its common
privilege) then by the bare ceremony of the first salute; neither in the last
Treaty, wherein the King of England was greatly concerned, and no less
solicitous to clear this title, was there any thing else agreed unto, as I
have already marked; and without all peradventure, if his Majesty in the
conceit of his dominion, should once offer to exert it, though but in very
ordinary effects, such as the assuming of jurisdiction, or imposing of tribute,
whereof the Sound and Adriatic do exhibit clear precedents; he would soon be
made to understand his error, not only by the reclaming dissent, but also, by
the vigourous opposition of all his neighbors: I might insist to disprove this
pretense of an indefinit dominion, from the far more rational judgment, of the
ancient Romans, who not only reckoned the sea with the air, Inter ea quae sunt
nullius; but, though by reason of the encircling of their vast Empire, they
might have acclaimed, even the whole Mediterranean Sea, jure diverticuli, and
in many parts thereof, had indeed several powers, and privileges; yet, were
they so far from captating this vain and groundless title, that one of the
greatest Emperors, begins a rescript, with relation to this same subject, in
these words, Ego quidem munai dominus, lex vero maris: thereby manifestly
holding forth, that, as he judged it incapable of dominion, so it is unstable
nature, and common destination, could only be regulat, as to humane concerns,
in so far, as Law, and consequently, condition or consent, did determine: from
all which, I conclude, that as the Dutch, do fully satisfy, all that in
justice, the King of England can demand, by their offering to strike, conform
to the last Treaty, and have good reason to repugne, either to his indefinit
soveraignity, or any further pre-eminence, for which nothing anterior to the
said last Treaty, can in reason be obtruded; so, his pressing them further, in
this affair, is, both captious, and unjust, and he might upon as good grounds,
refuse them the liberty, of a free passage in the channel, as exspect of them a
consent, to adominion, which if not cautioned, by a particular explication,
might assuredly be thereto extended.

The second ground of offense mentioned, is, that of the scandalous pictures
and pamphlets: but as every sober person, may justly apprehend, that, that
prudence, which often advises a connivent dissembling, of things of this
nature, at home, will far more restrain, any such contentious inquiries, as
may advance unto a challenge abroad; so, in case it should here prove too
feeble, for the provocation pretended, it is evident, that only such of those
pictures, and pamphlets, as are indeed injuriously reproachful, and are
licensed, or openly countenanced by the Stats, their authority, can warrant the
King of England's charge; by which rule if any man please to examine, the above
mentioned condescendence, he must of necessity rest satisfied, that on the one
hand, the picture dedicat to De Wit, being only a true, and honorable
representation, rej gestae, containing nothing more, then the most ordinary,
and easy reward, and encouragement of heroic atcheivements, and consequently
free of all shadow of reproach, and on the other hand, that picture of his
Maj. with his paramours, being at most (if any such thing was at all) a wanton
privateer timeously enough suppressed, when noticed, and so not chargeable upon
authority, until once questioned, do no ways amount to a sufficient
verification; whether there be any other pictures, or what there may be in
those pamphlets, I must confess, that for my own part, all the matter of this
Article does appear to me so light, and slender, that my curiosity has not
hitherto been tempted to an inquiry: This only I am assured of, that if
injuries of this kind may be compensat, by a counter-charge, the Dutch may
quickly balance this account, the English disdain of the Dutch is an infinite
theme: It Is true, either its excess, or some other cause, has hindered it, to
show it self, in the ingenuousnesse of pictures, and the like phansies; but he
who judges this, to be a want, may easily find it supplied by ane immense
overplus of pride, and contumely, in their discourses, and descriptions of
that People, both old and late: One thing I may further add upon this subject,
that for that picture instanced of the King of England, and the Ladies, even
interest and policy seem to absolve the Estats of any advice to the Painter,
or other accession unto it.

The 3. ground of provocation, intimat by the King of Englands last letter to
the Estats, is, That his Majesty thinks himself not bound to suffer the Dutch,
to do what injuries they please to their Neighbors, in matter of trade, which
if we consider, with a respect to the King's acknowledgement, of the Triple
Alliance, and with this only import, as if he did not judge himself thereby
bound, to concur with, and assist the Dutch, in their injustice, is no doubt
fair and righteous, and when made out, cannot but excuse him, to abandon the
Dutch, in any such unequal controversy, they may fall into with the French, or
any other; Although, whether it may, in like manner, warrant him, to pass
froma neutrality, and take part with their adversaries, when there appears no
engagement of his own proper interest, may still remain a question: But seeing
the circumstances, and whole strain of that letter, together with it is
coincidence with the King of France, his complaint of the Dutch innovations,
do visibly hold forth, a quit other tendency, in the expression, and in plain
English, that his Majesty presuming upon his Soveraignity of the seas, or some
other ground, known to himself, would have the Dutch to submit to his
arbitration; upon whatsoever difference, the French may allege: such an
officious interposing, without so much as the pretext, either of a solid title,
or real occasion, is palpably void of all color of right; so, that in effect,
the challenge here couched, in place of a declaration of a just offense, does
only exhibit, to the construction of ingenuitie, his Majesty's compliance, with
the French resentments, and his resolution, to second their arms just or
injust, and procure their satisfaction: As to the innovations, or injuries in
trade, generally hinted at, when their Majesty's, are both so reserved, who can
be express? The increase of the Dutch in this matter, is indeed very
extraordinary, both to the prejudice and envy of all their neighbors; but,
seeing it is so assured, that all the Dutch their advantages in trade, are the
Pure effects, of their own greater industry, and sobriety, that neither of the
Kings have as yet, thought it fit to acquaint the world, with the particulars
of their complaint, it is clear that these murmurings, so like to the
repineings of profuse debauches, equally covering and lazy, to the proportion
of their immense riot, against men of virtue, and diligence, can never amount
to a justifiable quarrel: I know, injuries in the remote parts of Africa and
Asia, have been discoursed of, and in special, that the Dutch do there, either
secretly instigat, or by compact, oblige the natives, to exclude all others,
and principally the English, from commerce in their bounds, (and this was also
the great pretext of the last war) but, whither this be only an invention,
simulating to come from far, the better to cover it is groundless contriveance
at home, or, that the Dutch by a more happy, and dexterous address, in these
many lawful ways, and methods, that may be practiced, do indeed prevail, and
carry the affection and trade of these countries, to the neglect and damage of
other adventurers, I am not inquisitive? Only, as there has not hither to
been given, any satisfieing information, in matter of fact; so, I am very
confident, that if artifice, and covetousness, were sufficient, to compass
such a privilege, neither English nor French, in these parts, had been at this
day, short of those, at whom they thus unreasonably grudge: I need not here
much notice, the grievance talked of, by some, against the Dutch, for their
excessive transportation of Gold and Silver, to the East Indies: that the thing
is an abuse in it self, draining Europe, of it is best substance, to the
languishing of trade, and Arts, and the occasioning of many miseries, and that
in such a measure, as even the treasures of America, which Europe has lately
devoured, are not to be known, but, it is leanness rather greater, then before,
and for no better return, then that, of spiceries, drugges and other the like
superfluities, is, too too visible: neither can it be denied, that the Dutch,
their East Indie Company, who suck our much of the substance of Europe, as the
English their Company does impoverish all England, are, deepest in the
transgression; but, seeing, beside what may be alleged, from the absolute
power, and liberty, competent to every Prince or State, in these matters, the
restraining of this evil, is so far from being the ground of the controversy,
that on the contrair, the contest, is much animat, by the envy at, and desire
of the same pernicious profit, it is evident, that the King of England's plea
is nothing thereby bettered.

Having thus weighed and rejected the King of Englands proper pretenses, I am
sorry, that such a soul conclusion, does so fairly present, viz. That, his
Majesty's present concurrence with the French, against the Dutch is, not only
a manifest partaking with them, in their injustice, and violence, but
accompanied, with such circumstances, as do render the accessory, an hundred
fold more guilty then the pall: which that I may more distinctly explicat, I
shall briefly reduce, what remains, to the heads proposed, viz. That this
assistance, of the King of England, is aggravat on his part, from no less
opposition, then that of religion, faith, honor, and interest: the dearest and
highest of all concerns.

And first for Religion, it is evident, that it is disswasion, cannot be called
in question, by any, who do not doubt his Majesty to be a Protestant; for,
seeing the truth and protestant cause, are unavoidably threatened, by the French
success, what rational man can think, that a protestant Prince should second
them, in the interprise? And really, the connection of these things, is so
obvious, that, it cannot but be grievous, to all his Majesty's well wishers, to
hear, and understand, how, that his present proceedings, have so much every
where brought his affection to this interest, under debate: I need not here
mention, the specious title, that he assumes, of defender of the faith, it is
engagements, hitherto, have proved so insignificant, that such as before did
hesitat, do now begin to say openly, that his resentment of gratitude, toward
the sea of Rome, that conferred it, do in effect seem to preponderat all it is
real import, and that Henry the eighth his scribbling against Luther, which
procured him from the Pope this title of the faith's defender, was not in any
proportion, that way so considerable; as Charles the second his present arming
against the Dutch, may very justly entitle him, with all true protestants, to
be the faith's betrayer: whether he will hold on the parallel, and disappoint
all appearances and their fears, as the same Henry did the Pope his author,
the event will testify, and that he may, is my hearty desire?

The next head that prohibits this apprehended assistance, is, that of faith,
and in this together with the more common assurances of humanity, Christianity,
and protestanisme, do conspire the special engagements, both of the late
Treaty, and Triple Alliance, whereby, the King of England, and the estats, are
expressly bound to keep true, firm, and inviolable peace, and nearer, and
stricter Alliance, and union, from that day foreward, etc. All which, if he
should now break, strangers may indeed exceedingly wonder: I say strangers,
for as for us, his subjects, sad experience has abundantly instructed us,
that all our part in this matter, is, to wish, that where neither religion nor
faith have availed, yet at least common honesty, and good fame may be prevalent.

The third disswasive that offers, against this concurrence, is honor: And
certainly, where religion and faith do claim so great a part, honor cannot
but have a very large share; but because these succumbeing, no doubt their
concomitant will evanish, as a shadow, it does therefore present, upon a
distinct ground, and pleads from its own peculiar merit. That the English
Nation sometimes masters, and ever equal to the French, should not now, be
degraded unto a base and mercenary subserviency, it would be of moment, with
a generous person, to suspend, even a real, let be, a groundless provocation,
rather then to resent it, snakeingly, against his party, under another's
disadvantage; but, neither can policy be exacted to these rules, nor does the
present case stand upon such a punctilio: Our substance and power, with the
noble ascendent, that the genius of this nation, has always had, over that of
the French, do upon more solid grounds, equally disdain, both the Switzers
service, and Munsters hire, and that the King of England, should become a
Pensionary of the French King, is a novelty, that has hitherto had no
precedent: But it may be said, that however we may thus calculat, on the one
side; yet on the other, if we remember the bussinesse of Chattam, and the Dutch
their late exaltation, these cannot but chock every true English heart, and to
such at least, as are tenderly sensible of this delicat point of honor, excuse
us, to embrace any occasion, whereby we may soonest, and best, retrive that of
our nation, unto it is former splendour: I grant indeed, that, that affair of
Chattam, was a high affront, turning in effect England's glory, and the worlds
terror, unto the contempt and scorn of a feeble defense, and in our
estimation, delivering, what was as Neptun's throne, to be dragged in Triumph,
by poor distressed fishers; so, as I suppose, that it may be truly affirmed, as
the fairest account of his Majesty's displeasure, that his resentment of the
Chattam-Attacque, is at the root of all: Which as on the one hand, it has been
notably improved by the french caresses, wherewith it is known, that they have
plied, both his Majesty, and his favorites, at all points: so, in all
probability, the envy of the Dutch prosperity, the irritation of Van Ghent's
Goe-by, and the opportunity of the French invasion, with the temptation of
their money, have heightened all other grounds of misunderstanding, and
advanced the indignation unto this present menacing posture: And thus I
confess things may stand, on the King of England's part: But, seeing the
surprise of Chattam, was on the Dutch their part, a fair act of hostility,
rather advanced, then obscured, by the Treaty, begun with the warning of an
express proviso, of no cessation, it cannot but be granted, that all these
circumstances of his Majesty's disgrace, did only redound, and accumulate, to
the Dutch their honor; so, that now, after the thing is voided by an ensueing
peace, and so long after, to meditat the revenge of that, which we had neither
the providence, nor courage, in it is season to have prevented, nor perhaps
durst yet notice, if the conjunction of the French, did not thereto prompt;
besides it is injustice, is an impotency, more shameful, then the cause that
provocks it: nay when I reflect upon the Dutch, their then success, together
with that pusillanimitie, and distress, that appeared in our court, and that
confusion and consternation, which at that time, did seize not only London,
but the whole nation, and withal consider, how little the Dutch did press
these advantages, either by an irruption into that fearful breach, continuance
of the war, or showing themselves more uneasy, in the dependent Treaty, I
cannot but judge, that the Dutch their so singular moderation, and disposition
to peace, when England was in its lowest State, ought to be a most powerful
mitigation, and utterly to efface all rancour against a people as generous in
their carriage, and condescensions, as valarous in their atcheivements: as for
the Goe-by given by the Dutch Vice Admiral and Fleet to a pitiful
pleasure-boat, it is already examined.

The fourth and last head, that opposes the King of England's resolution,
against the Dutch, is, that of interest: and this indeed is so much the more to
be pondered, that not only for the most part, it has the greatest sway in
humane affairs, but in this present bussinesse is in effect, the chief
inducement, wherewith many of this nation flatter themselves, and would delude
others; for, seeing, that the Dutch, are the only people, who can compet with
the English in naval forces, and that of late, they have in a manner rendered
themselves Masters, of the whole trade of the world, to the prejudice of
England, and all others, and thereby do alone hold the balance, against us;
it, must of necessity be granted, that the dominion will prove England's
exaltation: and as to the fear of too much aggrandizing France's naval
strength (for as to their power by land, while England retains the command of
the seas, it is not to be reguarded) it is abundantly excluded, both by the
assurance we have, of the Dutch their readiness to accept of peace, at our
pleasure, and of the French their remediless want of seamen, and their
nurseries, wherewith England is so richly stored: But, though this reasoning,
does appear plausible, yet, how quickly is it dashed, by this one short, and
obvious supposition, what if the English Fleet be beaten? Which as the
righteousness, and omnipotent power of the great God, the Lord of Hosts, the
injustice of our cause, and the dreadful wickedness of the land, the
judgments of plague, sword, fire, and wasting consumption, which we have
already felt, without repentance, his Majesty's Motto Jer. 22. 30. which
hitherto has not failed, and the injury offered unto the Dutch, with their
inclination to peace, and forced necessity to war, do render many degrees more
probable; so I am sure, that the known distractions, and greivances of the
nation, oppressed, by both court and Parliament, and yet these two divided one
against the other, the strange difficulties, and courses taken, in the
out-rigge of the present Fleet, perverting right, and starving trade, by the
stop of the exchecquer, and trampling upon the nations honor and interest, by
that base and dangerous supply from France, do thence portend most sad and
funest consequences, and these, so much the more assured, and terrible, that
they seem infallibly to depend, not on the disasterous success of a long war,
but on the very simple miscarriage of the first rancountre, and if thereby all
the flatteries of our vain hopes, be not infinitely overballanced, let all
sober men judge. But not always to ominat the worst, admit we do overcome at
first, does not our late experience, sufficiently teach us, that we by our
courage, may gain fights, and yet by reason of want of stock, lose and be
inferior in the war: Next, when we are superior in the war, where are our
solid advantages, and who can find out, and establish that midds, whereby,
neither the French on the one hand, shall reap too great benefit, by the Dutch
their ruin, and so be rendered a more powerful competitor; nor the Dutch, on
the other, recover all their former habitudes, and success in trade; seeing in
effect, both their present increase, and our decay, are from causes altogether
inward, as we may hear? Thirdly, do we wilfully shut our eyes; and will we
not understand, that the French, first with the Dutch, and now with us, will
again tack about to the Dutch, in case, that we do prevail: And this leads me
to wonder, at the emptiness and insignificancy of the consideration, opposed
to the just fears of the French their rising greatness: if the late
extraordinary beginnings of their sea forces, do not convincingly assure, a
suitable advance; yet, their Kings first joining with the Dutch, to quash and
weaken the English, and now turning to the English, to suppress the Dutch, may
palpably discover his design, either to be himself Master of both, or at
least, to suffer neither of them, to overtop him: Now as to the nurseries we
boast of, the Thames, our far more happy side of the Channel, New Castle trade,
and foreign plantations, are no doubt brave conveniences; and yet a man may
well think, that the French, their many sea ports, and rivers, great trade, and
also plantations, with their money that answers all things, may in short time,
become more then equal: While Spain had the ascendent, the maxim for the
English and Dutch, was, in the emblem of two bottles, swimming together, with
their motto: si concutimur, frangimur: that it should be antiquat, upon the
French their far more formidable prevalency, I wish the event do not too late
discover the error: O how happy might the English be, if but wise, to advert,
how that their recovery of trade, strength and riches, could not possibly
miss, by a far more easy expedient, and that in brief (for I may not enlarge)
consisting, in the simple reform of three things, viz. first, of our excess,
in respect of the Dutch frugality, who by their sobriety and hard fare both by
sea and land, do evidently facilitat both manufacture, and transport, to the
underselling of all others, and the great advancement of their gain. Of the
luxury of our Court, whereby thousands, specialy of the youth, are debauched,
from all virtue, and those sums, which might be a great accession, to the
trading stock of the nation, turned out of that channel, to the maintenance of
prodigality, and that beggarly villainous train, vvherevvith they are attended:
And 3, of our Church and Clergy, by whose jealous persecutions, irreligious
neglect of their office, and sacrilegious consumption of their benefices, and
Church livings, so many sober persons, have been, and still are, ruined, or
discouraged, so much vice and idleness continually fomented, and so great a
treasure of money improfitably employed, and wasted. But though the words of
wisdom are all in righteousness; yet, knowledge is only easy to him that
has understanding. I might here further add, how far more glorious and
profitable it would be, for the King of England, in this conjuncture, to show
himself Protector of the protestant cause, and thereby, not only gain the
more cordial and intense affection, of all his subjects, and the esteem and
honor of all the reformed nations, and Churches; but more powerfully bind the
Dutch, to all his reasonable demands, to contain himself in peace, and let his
subjects, so much the more plentifully gather it is sweet fruits, while others
in their miserable contendings, do neglect them: And lastly, to hold the
balance, and in its season absolutely umpire it, amongst all his neighbors,
when wearied, and broken by wars, to the restoring of Peace, settling of right,
and the high advancement of the interest of the English nation: But who is so
blind as he who will not see? His Majesty is abandoned to his humors, and the
solidity of the English nation, that has ever had a very sound discerning and
noble misreguard of the airienesse, and instability of the French, is at
present, exposed, by the cheat of their complements, to the worst design of
their policy. The Dutch, to gratify the King of England, have, of late,
advanced the Prince of Orange, and he who questioneth the ingrediency of this
motive, I am sure, may quickly be satisfied, by an easy reflection, upon the
Late Prince his odd extravagancies, and what ensued; this Prince his relation
to the King of England, with the influences, that thence may be feared, and the
tempting occasion, that the continuance of such a command, after the wars, may
give; yet, is not this like to prove a diversion: It is further certain, that
the generality of his Majesty's subjects, both from the conviction of the
reasons above exposed, the increase of grievances, which they begin to feel,
and the visible insolency, whereunto a restless Popish party, in our own
bowels, are already encouraged, do, from their heart, equally detest the
French conjunction, and dislike this breach with the Dutch: But neither is this
a more promising disswasive, so that after all the serutiny I have made, in
this affair, I must profess, that by such a combination of most important, and
evident disswasives, my thoughts, in the apprehensions of this fatal war, are
quite run up to this one, for a rest, that the thing if it fall out, is from
the Lord, and what he has determined will quickly appear.

It remains now, for conclusion, that I at least name the duty, to which all
this discourse has so full and fair a tendency, and that all the lovers of
truth, his Majesty's, and England's wel-being, would be earnest with God, to
turn the King from this evil course, and direct him, unto better counsels, is,
I am sure a warrantable, seasonable, and Loyal part; but if God in his holy
providence shall permit him to proceed, his Authority, cannot warrant our
obedience, unto such a sinful concurrence: I know, that of late, that
Apostolic position, It is better to obey God then man, has been much decried,
as fanatic, and seditious, and that for me to insist on such an exhortation,
would be derided, by many, as vain and ridiculous canting: but, however men
receive it, I am sure with the Apostle Paul, that the judgment of God, is
according to truth, against them which commit such things, to render
tribulation and anguish, unto every soul of man that does evil, to the subject
as well as unto the Prince, and that with God there is no respect of persons:
neither is the insufficiency of this plea, of the authority of Princes, in
opposition to the Law of God, yet to be determined; Ephraim but walked
willingly after the commandment, yet was he therefore oppressed, and broken in
judgment. The time was, in England, when men, rather then to betray their
civil liberty, to the will of arbitrarie orders, did choose to suffer the
imprisonment of their persons, and ruin of their whole estats, when, they
might have redeemed both, by a very small voluntary payment: shall we then now,
so far degenerat, as not only to give our moneys, and estats, but surrender,
and sacrifice our blood, lives, and souls to the carrying on of an unjust war,
against both religion, and righteousness? God forbid: Now if it be asked, what
then should we do? I am no furious fanatic, my answer is plain and safe, only
sin not, by any direct accession to this unrighteous war, and if ye therefore
be put to suffer, remember, that, blessed are they who are persecuted for
righteousness sake, for their's is the Kingdom of heaven, and he is also
faithful who will not suffer us to be tempted, above what we are able: But if
men say, nay, but we will obey our Prince, be avenged upon these insolents,
recover our honor, and restore our trade; let them be doing, and be strong for
the battle, God may make them fall before the enemy, for he has power to
help the injured, and to cast down the proud: Once more, therefore, be
warned, and remember, and fear, lest if ye still do wickedly, ye be consumed
both ye and your King.

POSTSCRIPT.
After I had digested the foregoing discourse, I confess the evident
improbability, of the King of England's grounds, did make me subsist in the
conviction, that, either I had superfluously labored, to prevent a vain
fear, or at least, might expect, some far more weighty reasons, then any I
have mentioned; but behold, a new surprisal both to me, and all that hear of
it. The Dutch menaced by the French Kings power, and forces, are not only
willing to comply with all reason, for the establishing of a good understanding
with the King of England, and the obtaining of his favor; but, by a new
Embassy and very obliging proposals, are courting him, if he cannot keep
faith, and the late Alliance, at least, to the safe and advantageous part, of a
fair neutrality; when on a sudden, his men of war, are sent out, and in open
hostility, set upon the Dutch merchants, returning through the Channel, looking
for no such thing, but on the contrair, wholly amazed at the rancountre, and
there sink, and take what they are able: Now, when, or where was ever the like
heard? That the King of England, a King, and a great King, a man in appearance,
and a Christian by title, and a protestant by profession, should not only,
contrair to all the manifest reasons above adduced, combine to assist the
French, and Popish arms, against an oppressed protestant State, desirous of
nothing more then Peace, and quiet: but become himself the first invader, and
that in plain piratick violence, without any preceding denunciation of war.

I shall not now repeat any thing that I have said, nor in effect add much, in
a matter so palpable to the meanest discerning, it is certainly a matter of sad
regrat, to see both our Court thus wheedled by French illusions, and again the
nation forced, and driven, by the Courts influences, to become the principal
party, in a war, wherein, their assistance was more then was expected, and
hounded out, to the first attacque; whereas their instigators resolutions, were
not published: If ordinary reason did not suffice, to govern our passion, yet
a man may well think, that at least our experience, and knowledge of the French
their politic and safe procedoure, in their last assistance promised to the
Dutch, might have restrained this precipitation, which I am sure, is so absurd,
and ridiculous; that if the French should also hover (though that is not now to
be supposed) and suspend for this year their invasion, in the pleasant
observation, of the happy success of their designs, in the mutual
contentions, and ruins of the two nations, in whose overthrow, they must
apprehend their advantage to ly; Nay, in the end, should lend their hand, to
setup the Dutch (if brought under) for continuing the war, it would undoubtedly
prove, as much their advantage as recreation. But suppose we would on any
terms fight the Dutch, are we indeed so blind with rage, as to have omitted
the premising of a public declaration, which in such a case, the law, and
custom of all nations, and ages, does manifestly require? or if the equity of
this promulgation, founded in that clear rule, omnia prius experiri quam armis
sapientem decet: And confirmed, both by reason, and the Law of God, Deuteronomy: 20.
10, could not move, yet, should not the positive necessity of this formality,
as to the honor and effects, at least, of a solemn war, and for hindering
the Sovereign of the seas from becoming the Archest of pirates, have prevailed
upon us? I grant, it had been a difficult task, to have said any thing
handsomely, let be reasonably, on such a subject; and yet, on the other part, I
am confident, that if some remains of natural shame, had not opposed an
express confession of our folly, and wickedness, we would rather have
ventured upon the worlds lighter censure, then incurred their detasting
horror.

But why do I enlarge? Or what do I exspect by reasoning? Nay, quid vota
furentem, etc. That the Dutch their small lose, through this treachery, is
infinitely compensed, by the gain it brings, of all other nations favor, and
an accession of as much more confidence in God, and firm courage, as the King
of England has added of dishonor to his violence, is too too evident: How
much more it may excit my country men to the duties, whereunto I have
exhorted, I leave it to the persuasion of the thing it self, which needs no
words either to illustrat, or enforce it. Ambrose tells us of the primitive
times, Julianus Imperator Apostata, babuit sub sa Christianos milites, quibus
cum dicebat, producite actem pro defensiane Ret publicae, obediebant; cum autem
eis dicoret producite arma, in Christianos, tunc agnosceb^^ Imperatorem Coeli:
Which passage, does here so exactly quadrat, as I am assured, that every one,
who reveres the same great God, must acknowledge its force. But our God is in
the heaven, he will do whatsoever he pleases.

A More particular Reviewe of his Majesty's Declarations for his War with the
Dutch, and Indulgence to Tender Consciences.
OBserving in the Postscript to my former, that the King of England had taken
up arms, I thought, that there I had also laid down my pen; but since it has
at length, pleased his Majesty to appear in print, in a Declaration of war,
against the Stats General, etc. and likewise in an other of indulgence to all
his loving subjects; their relation to my former discourse, has likewise
inclined me, to a summar reviewe of both: And because the war is now certain
and formed, I suppose it may conduce, to a more satisfying understanding of the
whole, that by way of preface I briefly resume it is progress, unto the present
period.

There are not yet many months past, since the Dutch, of a long time threatened
by the French King, his preparations, and approaches, did solicit the King of
England to their aid conform to their Alliance, which though by reason of
former resentments, and late displeasures, was indeed hopeless; yet, most men
thought, that the singular benefit of peace, in the midst of our neighbors
wars, the greater likelihood of the Dutch their condescendence, and submission,
in the hope of relief, then in desperate hostility, with the assured
satisfaction, either of an easy revenge, upon the Dutch, continueing
refractory, by the hand of the French, or of the advantageous glory of
umpireing it betwixt both, would undoubtedly determine us, to subsist, in an
attentive, and well prepared neutrality; but the French their address, and
advance, prevailing upon our inconstant passions, and debauched penury we
proceed, notwithstanding of the Genius, inclination, and interest of the
nation, and the dissvvasion both of reason and religion, to Balance to the
French assistance; which was the occasion of my first discourse: And neither
in this shevving more fixednesse, the precipitancy of error and fury still
driveing, we on a sudden, in the very time, that the Dutch had sent an
extraordinary Ambassador to propose their utmost condescensions, for appeasing
us, without any promulgation of war, fall upon the Merchant ships, returning,
and striking to us, in the Channel, destroying and taking all we could, as I
have remarked in my foregoing Postscript, and thereafter we emitt the
declaration of war, which comes now to be examined: Wherein (suppressing the
Date, as being ashamed to confess our anterior piratick violence) his Majesty,
beginning with the attestation, of his own zeal, for the quiet of Christendom,
hops, that the world will believe, that it is inevitable necessity, forces
him to Arms: I shall not question the truth of his Majesty's confidence, in
this insinuation; though I heartily wish, that he could have appealed to some
more known, and credible proof: He tells us indeed, that after his
restoration: (which was in the year 1660) his first work was to establish
Peace with his neighbors, and to conclude a strict league with the Dutch: But
as this was at best, nothing more then a convenient formality, in such ane
exigent; so, we know too well the horrible subversions, and persecutions,
wherein, contrair to his solemn Oaths, and promises, both old and late, he was
at that time exercised in, at home, to conclude from this his short and
necessary abstaining from foreign disturbances, that reguard which he
pretends for Christendomes quiet. As for his sudden rupture with the Dutch, in
the year 1665, he foreseeth the objection, and would lay it upon the
Parliament, moved thereto, by the Dutch their injuries, and oppressions, and
justifies it, by his preceding endeavors, of a reasonable accommodation; But
will the world receive this naked affirmation, when as it neither then had, nor
is it ever like to have, a distinct, let be a satisfying account, of that
matter? And even England is convinced, that nothing save a malign envy,
influenced, by the sinistruous designs, of a corrupt Minister, and a vain
royal Company, did pousse us on, to that extravagance, and with what
tenderness of Christendom's peace, we in the prosecution thereof, hired the
Bishop of Munster, to a land invasion, needs not my pen to make it be
remembered: As for the shameful, and disastruous event of that war, I should not
have mentioned it, the Dutch their braving it, upon our coasts, in the end of
the year 1665 routing our whole fleet, in 66, sole Masters of the sea,
infesting our ports (to the very beseiging of the nation) firing therein our
best ships, and leading our Charles in triumph, in the 67, are things too sad,
and recent, for a true English man, to think on, without confusion and
blushing. But seeing his Majesty is pleased, to say, that his victories, and the
Dutch losses, were memorable enough, to put them in mind of being more
faithful: I cannot but regrat, that the nations, from such a reference, should
have such ample ground, both to condemn us, upon our own allegations, and
flout us, for our vain effrontry: But to let pass this pitiful transition, we
are in the next place told, that the last Peace was no sooner made, but the
Tutch returned to their use of breaking Articles and supplaenting our trade: As
for instance foresooth, the Stats were Particularly engaged, by an Article of
the Treaty at Breda, to send Commissioners to London for regulating of the
East-Indie trade; But they were so far from it, that on the contrary, our
Ambassadors were by them slighted, and no forebearance of farmer wrongs
obtained. A man might have thought, that such ane open challenge of perfidy,
and fraud, would certainly be followed, by a weighty and liquid condescendence,
and that in place of the accidental misgive of a meeting, not peremptorily
appointed, instance might at lest have been made, in some on or other, of those
wrongs complained of, specially, seeing, that his Majesty, in the bussinesse of
Surenam, is very positive, and in another less material particular, even to
the noticing of pictures and meddals: But the truth is, there are no wrongs,
that we could allege; all our old pretensions, though in this declaration,
several times remembered, were buried in oblivion, by an express article of the
last Treaty; and since that time, none have occurred: Besides, it is so notour,
that all the Dutch their advantages, in point of trade, which we term wrongs,
do proceed directly, on their part, from their sobriety, and industry, and on
England's part, from our idleness, and Luxury, that men should be ashamed, by
such groundless accusations, to discover their invidious murmurings: What
further remains here, in matter of fact, the Stats will, no doubt, fully clear
it: One thing I may add, that, as the Printed Articles referred unto, do only
bear, that both parties were content, that Commissioners on both sides, should
meet, as soon, as might be, after the peace, for the regulating of commerce,
and navigation, and do neither mention London, for the place, nor the
East-Indie trade, for the subject; so it may easily be supposed, that for any
other appointment, of this nature, that might have been made, the Stats have
either been always, willing to keep, or were at present, able to excuse the
delay, and ready to observe any new appointment, upon demand. From this his
Maj. goes on, to accuse them, of another breach, in the West Indies, about the
restitution of Surenam; and truly, he is in this so express, and plain, that
as his passing from it, to more uncertain alleagances, and on these rather
stating the present controversy, gives me a shreud suspicion; so, the
business consisting mostly in fact; I entirely refer it, to the Stats, their
answer: Who, I am sure, will thereto return a direct, and undeniable
contradiction.

But it is no wonder (says his Maj.) that they venture at these outrages upon
our subjects, in remote parts; when they dare be so bold, with our royal
person, and the honor of this nation, so near us as in their own country
(Boorish animals, in the conceit of their popular soveraignity, forgetting the
respect due to sovereigns!) and there almost everywhere setting forth abusive
pictures, and historical meddals, and pillars some of which, have been exposed,
by command of the Stats themselves even when we were united with them, in
counsel, for the support, of the Triple Alliance I have been already, so full
upon this objection, that here I need add nothing; let the matter be thorrowly
searched, and I am persuaded it will be found far more disgraceful, in this
unvvorthy, and impotent resentment, then, in all the malice of our adversaries;
and as this complexed quarrel, does unquestionably resolve it self, either in
the contemptible luxuriancy, of petulant wits, which the Stats did never
daigne to notice; or the warrantable commemoration, of laudible atchivements,
which they may very justly own; so, certainly, the most noble redress for the
future were, manfully to remove the occasion, or at least despise the scorn,
which our feminine weakness, hitherto, has so plentifully furnished: And
hence is it, that, although his Majesty does judge, that this alone, were cause
sufficient of his displeasure, and his subjects resentment; yet, not being
ignorant of the advantages given, and knowing well, that Englands glory, was of
late, so highly advanced, under a sober and solid government, (though both
usurped, and odious) as that the alterations, which now expose us to contempt,
cannot be made any just ground for engageing us, into this war, he does not
rest upon it; but (says he) we are urged by nearer considerations, and the
safety of our trade, the preservation of our subjects abroad, and the
Hollanders dareing to affront us, almost within our ports, are the things which
move our just indignation, against them: And as to the first two grounds,
though, his Majesty does adduce nothing, not before answered, to demurre my
progress; yet, when I consider, the mortal repugnancy of war to trade, and
safety, the sensible grievance, and retardment that the former has already
suffered, by the late stop, on the Exchecquer, occasioned by our preparations,
and the many other burdens, losses and distractions; wherewith, war is
necessarily attended; I cannot enough admire, by what artifice, our present
methods, can promote our designs: I reguard not justice, or injustice; if even
by killing, we could hope to possess, it would in some measure, satisfy; But
in this event, the French, so manifestly present, as I am forced to say, that
unless his Majesty intend, as the plague does, to increase our trade, and
riches, by diminishing the number of the proprietors, and mind our
preservation, by hideing us, in the grave, and deepths, lest we should live to
see our selves miserable, I see no other possible issue, of these his specious
incitements: But, their dareing to effront his Maj. is, the thing, we can least
digest: The right of the flage, was one of the first prerogatives, of our Royal
Antcestors, and ought to be the last, from which, this Kingdom, should ever
depart; It was never questioned, and it was expressly acknowledged, in the
Treaty at Breda, and yet, this last summer, it was not only violated, by
their commands at sea, and that violation afterward justified at the Hague, but
it was also represented, by them, in most Courts, as ridiculous for us, to
demand: Although, I have said so much already, on this subject, as is
sufficient, to free the Dutch from all breach of Treaty, and more then enough,
to make it evident, to sober impartiality, that the offense is rather fansied,
and imaginary, on the part of the complainer, then really given, by the party
complained of; yet, since his Majesty will needs fill the World, with a noise,
about this nothing, that the cry of the injustice of the war, may not be heard,
and will by the force of imagination, magnify it, to the height, and quality,
of such an insufferable injury, as if it alone (if not expiat with the blood of
the offender) were more then sufficient, to drive him to the sad and inevitable
necessity, of covering the Ocean with ships, to the emptying of the nations
treasure, and dying the sea with the blood of his subjects, to wipe off the
stain of this affront; I am necessitat to take up balance again, and weigh
the just import of this provocation: Nor do I preoccupy the judgment of any,
if I premitt this, to what upon the most accurat, and impartial search, I have
found, that, whosoever weighs this deed, in the Balance of sound reason, must
be forced to say, that nothing save implacabile malice, could have seduced any,
to have laid it, in whole, or in part, as a foundation, on which, the weight of
such a war, was to be laid: If any judge otherwise, let him, for satisfying
himself, consider these things: First, that, whatever past in this rancountre,
betwixt his Majesty's pleasure-boat, and the Dutch fleet, was so far from being
done almost within his Majesty's ports (as is affirmed) that, it was not within
the British seas, the place, to which alone, the Treaty tieth expressly, the
Dutch, to this formality of striking to our men of war; for, at this time, the
Dutch Fleet, were riding at Anchor, upon their own coast, which never yet was,
nor can be called, the British seas: where now is there ground for accusation,
let be revenge? Hence secondly, though our Court, would represent the Dutch, to
the world, as such morose clownes, who deserve to have their head cut off, for
not capping to a pitiful picture of a man of war; yet I am almost surprised,
at the generous excess of civility, which appeared in the obliging carriage,
of that Gallant Gentleman, Mijn Here van Ghent, who not only saluted the
English lady, whom he knew to be aboard that boat, with a volley of great guns,
but went also aboard, to complement her; so that it might well be questioned,
whether, he being a person of such trust and command, they had greater cause of
quarrelling him, at the Hague, for having done too much, or complaining of him
at Whitehal, for having done too little? What English man, may not blush, to
think, that the Dutch, are not only like to carry away the trade from us, by
their industry and sobriety, but to outstrip our courteours also, in courtship
and civility? Will we in our fretfulnesse, needs pick quarrels, where humanity
would prompt and instigat us, to the revenge of gratitude? And this leads me to
a third viz. That the world may rather wonder, that the King of England, did
not express his gratitude to the Dutch, for being at so vast a charge, as to
equippe, and put to sea, a Fleet, sufficient to guard, against any attempts
from the French, (he being by the Triple Alliance, equally engaged with them,
to have prepared, and put forth, in order to that defense, a considerable
number of men of war) then, thus without cause, to quarrel, and meditat
revenge: must the Dutch have no other thanks, for bearing the burden alone,
without putting us to bear our proportion; shall they have no other interest
but blows, for having laid out such vast sums, without urging us, to do,
what in honor we could not deny to be duty? Is it not matter of blushing,
that his Majesty, should so expose himself, together with the Nation, to the
upbraidings, of a sober people, and the world's just censure of high
ingratitude. But why do insist? though his Majesty with a great pomp, and parad
of words, would precipitat the World, into the belief of his being, in this
particular, injured by the Dutch, adhibiting the utmost of artifice, to give
it, the appearance of an injury, I hope, upon the Consideration of what
formerly was said, and is now adduced, I may assert, without all hesitaton,
that his Majesty's right of the flage, as acknowledged, in the Treaty, has
neither been questioned, nor violated by the Dutch, far less represented, in
the manner mentioned: all the bussinesse is, that one of his Majesty's
pleasure-boats, passing through the Dutch fleet, lying at Anchor, upon their
own coast, had not that honor paid to her, which the Dutch, are only obliged,
to render, to his Majesty's men of war, in the British seas: Which account if
it be indeed so true, and unanswerable, as to have moved neighboring courts,
to laugh at the peevishness, of our offense, and does now amaze the world at
the rage and violence, whereunto it has transported us, are the Dutch
therefore to be accused? No, no, his Majesty himself judges otherwise, and
therefore, he subjoins, An ungrateful insolence, that they should contend with
us, about the dominion of the seas, who even in the reign of our royal father,
thought it, an obligation, to be permitted to fish in them, by taking of
licenses, and for a tribut: And here lies the great discovery, the right of the
Flage is all, that is drectly pretended; but, dominion of the narrow seas,
under the color of a sophistical equipollency, is the thing mainely intended:
I shall not repeat what I have above adduced, for distinguishing, this
prerogative, from the dominion aimed at, and explicating this whole matter; but
as his Majesty's covert insinuation, does abundantly verify, even his own
diffidence, of his absurd and insupportable claim; so, if we go about, thus to
renverse nature, and subvert humane liberty, the Dutch are the first; but
neither the greatest, nor the last enemy, which we are to apprehend: As to the
license to fish, here instanced; since I cannot set down what is truth, in
matter of fact, considering the confidence, wherewith it is asserted, without a
reflection, which I by choice forbear, I leave that to the Stats their
vindication: But, suppose it had been sought, and granted, within that space
of distance, from our coast, which the positive law of nations, and consent of
mankind, has in a manner every where appropriat, to the countries
respectively adjacent, it signifies nothing to his Majesty's purpose: What is
then the Dutch their ingratitude, and insolence, that provoks his Majesty, to
an exclamation? let all men judge: It Is said, they owe their being and wealth
to our protection and valor: But, as all the world knows, that, as interest
is the loadstone of policy, and policy the only director of State
transactions; so, I think, I need not amuse my self, to show, either, how that
the English in former times, did not supererogat, in any higher degree of
charity, toward the Dutch, above the persuasion of their own advantage, or that
in all probability, the Dutch would be yet more ready to repay us, if we should
be reduced to the same distress, and circumstances, which is gratitud's just
retribution.

To these things, his Majesty adds, that, notwithstanding all these
provocations, he patiently expected satisfaction, not being willing to expose
the peace of Christendom, for his own particular resentments, whilst, the
Tutch ceased not, to provoke the most Christian King (though a small elogy, yet
an unbecoming title, from the faith's defender) against us, of which, they
thought, themselves so secure, that for above a twelvemonth, their Ministers,
have here threatened us with it: Now, for the commendation which his Majesty
affects, I remit it unto the impartial judgment of the same provocations, and
patience, whence he would derive it; but as to what ensues, are we so vain of,
and intoxicat with, our French, or most Christian Alliance, that we have lost
our senses? or has the world seen with their eyes, for above these two years,
the French and Dutch in hostile preparations, and mutual defiance? And on the
other hand, the French and English, in continual complements, and embraces, and
yet, are they all deluded? And the Stats the most dull sots, or empty
politicians imaginable? If ingenuity would permit, I sometime incline to think,
that it must be the Dutch representations at our Court, of the danger of
discord, and the advantage which the French may thereby gain, that is here so
strangely misconstrued, and abused; but why should I strain? I believe verily,
the words are like their Author, wholly unaccountable

The next passage tells us, of his Majesty's Last Ambassador, and how to his
pressing memorials, he could receive no answer, until he had declared his
revocation, and then, they offered a paper to this effect, that in this
conjuncture, they would condescend to strike, if we would assist them against
the French; but upon condition, it should be no precedent, in their prejudice:
And as to this Embassy, though I might easily bring to mind, the difference,
about the method of proposals, the Ambassador tabling only his demand about
the Flage, and the Stats upon the rational consideration, of the then
appearances, desireous to hear all, that he had to require, before they would
give answer, and thence excuse, the Stats their delay; and though I could also
exhibit, such an account of the Paper of return, as might abundantly clear,
that, as the Dutch, did only qualify their offer, of a new engagement to
strike (which they had all reason to do, having, as it is like they will, in
it is season, make manifest, stretched their condescension, the more to fix if
possible, the King of England to a steadfastness beyond what could have been
wrung from the terms of that Treaty at Breda) with the condition of our
reciprocal performance, of the Alliance, so it was this novel sea dominion, and
not the formality of striking, against which, they did precaution, for the
future; yet, it being a matter of pure fact, I choose rather to leave it, to the
Stats their proper vindication, then further to dive in it.

In the last place, his Majesty, tells us, that, the Dutch did lately send an
Extraordinary Ambassador, to him, who in a most extraordinary manner, has
given him to understand, that he can offer no satisfaction, until he have sent
back to his Masters: But seeing the surprise of his Majesty's late hostile
attacque of the Dutch merchants, before any intimation of war, and just when
this their Ambassador, was making ready, to expose his offers, was in effect
such, as might have made him, not only to stop a commencing, but to break off,
a very far advanced Treaty, is it not strange, to see, a great Prince, shut up
his declaration, emitted for public satisfaction, with so little reguard to
all men's Knowledge, and apprehensions, and as it would seem for the pedantick
affectation of a running repetition, scorn the world, with a dissimulation that
has no pretext? But I know the Stats are in case, to give such a reply, and to
clear up all those matters of fact, alleged by him, to justify his present
engagement, (and represented to all men, as such insolences, and injurious
effronts, which have constrained him, over the belly of his own inclination, to
engage in this war) that will be so plain, and perfect a contradiction, to all
his pretended reasons, as will not only prove, that there was never a more
just defensive war on their part, nor unrighteous invasion upon his, but by a
naked representation of truth will amaze the world, at the confidence, where
with these things are asserted, and put it with all sober persons, beyond
debate, that their is a mystery of iniquity, lurking at the bottom, and masked
under these pretenses.

These being his Majesty's reasons for our war, that they do nothing relieve
his resolution, of that verdict I have given upon them, specialy, in respect of
their contrariety to righteousness, and religion, is undeniably manifest; but
because his intentions as to the latter may now be more clearly observed, in
that second declaration of indulgence, above mentioned, I shall in like manner
shortly peruse it.

And that his Majesty, in the remembrance, of the rigours and persecutions,
wherewith the sober and godly. in his dominions, have hitherto been sore vexed,
may not only in time be admonished, to fear the inconveniences, which may
thence necessarily arise, and provide a remedy, by a fair indulgence, but also,
in the serious conviction of the evil of his ways, and just apprehensions of
divine wrath, thoroughly converted, to break of his sins by righteousness, and
his iniquities by showing mercy to the oppressed, is certainly, not more the
desire of all his faithful subjects, then it would infallibly prove, the
lengthening of his tranquillity: But, seeing in place of any thing of this
nature, the declaration under our hand, has quit another tendency, and both
from the intimation of all circumstances, sufficiently laid out in my first
discourse, and from it is whole composure appears, to be nothing else, then a
cunning device, to secure his Majesty, from the dislike of good men in this
sinful combination, against the protestant interest abroad, and in the mean
time, to foment and promote the Popish party and cause at home, until, that, in
the righteous judgment of God, if we foresee it not, truth should again be
benighted, by the darkness of Popish superstition, and all it is lovers,
exposed to that Tyranny, the most pernicious poison of ease, which we have here
presented, under the no less plausible tentation of the Gospel's liberty, does
without question, so much the rather oblige all concerned, to a more intent,
and accurat disquisition: Which, that I may the better perform, it is in the
first place to be noted, that, albeit the conception of this paper, does
generally include all sorts, of Non-Conformists, and recusants, and that the
liberty therein granted to Popish recusants, seems to be much more restricted;
yet, if we may subject his Majesty's inclinations (or rather plain intimations)
to the judgment of reason, all appearances do evince, that, whereas to
protestants, they are the mere constraints of policy, unto Papists they are
indeed the spontaneous motions, of a propense favor; for, seeing our present
engagement against the Dutch, the nature of an indulgence, an involuntary
dispense against standing laws, and his Majesty's plain profession, do
obviously hold forth, that the license, is in effect, extorted, by extrinsick
pressures, it is extension unto the Popish party, who thereunto do add no
moment, does abundantly argue it, in this reguard, to be an act of free
choice: I need not here remember, how much, this has always been his
Majesty's byasse, what cherishing connivance, Papists have quietly enjoyed, to
the great increase of their numbers, and insolence, since the year 1660 whilst
other Non-Conformists, have been tossed, with continual vexations; it has not
been the least ingredient in the bitterness of these grieveances; neither are
there many years, since he emitted, in their favor a proclamation, of such
ample grace, that even his present most obsequious Parliament, did, by an
unanimous address, interpose for it is revocation; so, that, things being
evenly weighed, viz. his Majesty's unsatisfiable displeasure at, and causeless
jealousy of, the Protestant Non-conformists, with his constant good opinion,
and affection, witnessed to those of the Roman communion, his present
groundless wars against the protestant Stars, and sinful, and foolish
conjunction with the French, not more regrated by the better sort, then
rejoiced in, by the other, the comprehending of all in the same indulgence,
may, not only persuade the inequality of favor by me remarked, but further
very rationally induce, to believe, that the more apparent latitude, conceded
to protestan: dissenters, is, only the better to cover, the real advancement
of the Popish interest, the Principal design of this contriveance, and
therefore in conformity to these grounds, if my reflections shall be also
different, seeming to straiten on the one hand, and to enlarge on the other,
discovering the protestant to be only tempted, and snared, and the Papist
favored, and honored, I hope, the palpable agreement of this procedoure, to
his Majesty's own intentions, will easily defend me, from the censure of malice
or calumny,

For preface then, his Majesty with the fame truth and confidence, wherewith we
have heard him assert, his zeal for quiet in his declaration of war, commenceth
this his indulgence against the truth, by telling us, that his care and
endeavors, for the preservation of the rights, and interests of the Church,
has been sufficiently manifested to the world, by the whole course of his
government: O unhappy care, that has wrought such dismal alterations! The true
rights, and interests of the Church of God, are, the purity of his worship, and
ordinances, the protection of his Ministers, and the advancement of true
Godliness: Now, that in exchange, for any measure of these blessings; which,
we formerly enjoyed, since his Majesty's return, we have only seen, God's
worship corrupted, into vain imposed formalities, and the vilest of the
people, made priests, in their place, and wickedness exalted, by the most
avouched perjury, and profanity, that ever was known amongst men, is a truth,
under the sense whereof, every serious soul does groan; but in effect, his
Majesty has been, and is still, so entirely bended, to advance against the
Lord, proud supremacy, and set up in the Church, a wicked prelacy, a debauched
elergy, and superstitious liturgy, thereby to moddel, and subject, all the
concerns of Religion, to his own lusts, and humors, as I am confident, that
all the lovers of truth, in lieu of being abused, by this pretended care, will
only reguard it, as a seasonable warning, to take the more diligent heed, to
the snare that may be, and is couched, in all it is proposals: Thus, for a
demonstration, he subjoins, the frequent coercions he has used, upon
dissenters, and for composing differences, in matters of Religion: and whether
this be more concludent on his Majesty's, or on my behalf, I leave it to the
impartial discerner: However, we may well observe, that since his Majesty, even
in his gracious humor, thinks his care of the Church, principally commendable,
by his former severities, which after the manner of the primitive persecutions,
are at present only intermitted, from fear, and policy, when these restraints
are over, we cannot but expect, that he will resume his wonted methods, and
that, with all the irritation, wherewith his inward fretting at a forced
liberty, may probably impresse him: But (says he) it being evident, that there
is very little fruit of these forcible courses (a fair conviction, if well
followed) we think our selves obliged to make use of our supremacy: And truly
if he were seriously minding reformation, and thereto applying his royal power,
which can never be more properly, nor gloriously employed, we should the less
scruple, the error, though he should mistakingly ascribe, the extraordinary
call of the present pressing exigence, to the warrant, of a pretended perpetual
prerogative: But, seeing we may here manifestly perceive, that, that power,
which at first, did only acclaime the Clergies civil dependence, and then
after, becoming vain of the Reformation, wherein it was honored, did
excresce, and exceed to the ordering of Church-Rites, and Government, under the
notion of externals, does at present presume to license, and authorize, all
Rome's superstition; do we not discover, the wickedness of that usurpation,
which pretends, to as absolute a dispose, in matters of Religion, as was ever
arrogat, over worldly propriety? Thus we see the Scepter wristed out of the
hand of his Christ, and swayed in a perfect opposition to him, and designed
subserviency to his grand enemy the Antichrist, which as it ought to make our
eye affect our heart, while we see that Scripture fulfilled in our eyes, that
the Kings of the earth, shall give their power unto the beast, and make war
with the Lamb; so it concerns his Majesty, while he invadeth the Mediators
scepter, to remember, that he has also a rod of iron in his hand, to secure
his scepter and avenge himself of such, as do not strike to him, in
recognisance of his absolute supremacy.

In the next place, his Majesty adds his motives, viz. that he issues out
this declaration, as well for the quieting of the minds, of His good subjects, in
these points, inviteing of strangers, in this conjunsture, and the
encouragement of all, to follow their callings, as also, for preventing the
danger of seditious conventicles. Blessed is the man, whose mind is staid,
trusting in the Lord, for there is nothing here sincere, what quietness, from
such a self-destroying assurance? I do not mention it is mutability, though all
men know, that the first meeting of the Parliament, would remonstrat all this
grace to nothing, but, when to the establishing of ever jealous, and
persecuting prelacy, the licensing of pernicious plotting popery is adjoined,
certainly, if we be lulled asleep, with such a charm, we deserve, the sleep of
death, which, it is poison menaces: As for the inviting of strangers, French
caterpillars we may indeed expect, and swarms of Romish locusts; but to
others, who might have found some allurement in this liberty, how much is it
to be feared, that our violence shall prove more disgustful then the motive
attractive: And as for Trades encouragement, can any man be so infatuat, as to
believe, that, that which in it is only season of peace, could never have
weight, should now be truly minded, by such, who have so little cared to
involve us, in the confusions, and burdens of war? What a golden indulgence
must it be, that will yet erect our trade, under all these pressures? But, his
Majesty does indeed fear seditious Conventicles, and may be something worse,
nam mala men's, malus animus: And although I neither know, nor design to
increase his grounds; yet, in my affectionat desire for his vvelfare, I
earnestly vvish, he would remember, that in all ages, a prince, his own
inconstancy, and oppression, have proved his greatest adversaries, and are most
to be feared, and that they are indeed so fatal and funest, that neither force,
nor policy could ever yet ward of their mischief, for he is above them who
gives the blovv.

But I have too long retarded his Majesty's benevolence, which in the first
place declares his express resolution, meaning and intent, to be (so that we
may blame our selves if we be mistaken) that, the Church of England be
preserved entire in its Doctrine, discipline and government, as now it stands
established by law, and that this be taken, to be, as it is, the basis, rule,
and standart (what place he assigns to the Scriptures of truth I know not)
of the general, and public worship of God, and further, that the conformable
clergy, enjoy their revenues, and that no person, be capable of any benefice,
who is not exactly conformable: I need not enlarge, upon the import of this
passage; what the Church of England here meant, is, and has done, we all
know, if any man think, that these roots of bitterness, prelacy, and
superstition remaining, they will not again spring up, into all that
persecution, whereof some may now fancy themselves to be discharged, he is
but ill acquainted, either with their nature, or practices: He who desires to
be informed, may consult experience, which will abundantly satisfy, how much
better, and more free accommodations, have, thereby been disturbed, and
frustrat: Hovvever, there is one part of this Royal resolution, which I
cordially close with if heartily meant, and that is, that, the doctrine of
this Church, may be effectually preserved, I may not here stay, to explain my
reasons; but, he who shall be pleased, to peruse our old homilies, and compare
them, with that doctrine, which does now very much boast itself, both in
pulpit, and print, he will quickly understand, our former profession, to be so
sadly depraved, with Socinian, Popish, and Arminian Errors, that, this alone,
were enough, to bring upon us, all our fears: As for the exclusion of all
persons, not exactly comformable, from benefices, although it be without doubt
a mighty diminution of the favor of a just indulgence, since it depriveth both
of the encouragement and convenience due, to the ministers of the Gospel; yet
the master of these laborers, having pledged his alsufficiency for their
supply, and the Church of God having alvvayes, been truly richest when
poorest, I confess, it is a matter whereon I shall not spend my complaints,
however it be just matter of his repentance.

In the next place (says his Majesty) we do declare our will that the
execution of all manner of penal laws, in matters ecclesiastical, against
whatsoever sort of Non-conformists, or recusants, be immediately suspended, and
they are hereby suspended, etc. And this is the great jubilee, a proclaimed
liberty, to Atheists, Socinians, Papists, Jesuits, seminary priests, Arminians,
Sects of all sorts, and the grossest heretics, to contemn Religion, commit
idolatry, impugn truth, Blaspheme, seduce, and destroy souls, uncontroulled:
It Is true the conscientious Nonconformist, has also his part, in this
exemption; but, as God did send forth his Gospel, into the world in weakness,
and foolishness, destitut of all humane advantages, and only, by his own
grace and presence, did sustain, and advance it, against all the opposition,
that the malice, or violence, Potentats, Authorities, or powers of the earth,
could devise, or execute against it, to the effect, that neither our faith, nor
his truth, should stand, in the help of man, but in the power of him, who has
promised, to be with us, unto the end of the World; so, I am persuaded, that no
man fearing and believing, the same Lord God, will judge, all the favor that
men can show, valuable at this rate: I grant, the excess of this indulgence,
does not so corrupt the just relief, that tender consciences may find in it,
as, to hinder them, to partake lawfully of it is benefit; but sure I am, if my
censure be right and true, as certainly it is, men should be so far, from being
deceived, by the flattery of carnal ease, either to embrace, or acknowledge it,
as a favor, or pursue it, by any active compliance requisite for it is
accomplishment, that on the contrairy, they should look upon the act in it self
as a high provocation, against God, a fearful exposing, and opposing of his
truth, and under the color of a pitiful enlargement, and relief to tender
consciences, a real and designed betraying, of the Protestant interest.

But his Majesty proceeds to declare, that to the effect, there may be no
pretense, for the continuing of Conventicles, he shall from time to time,
allow, a sufficient number of places, as they shall be desired, in all parts,
for the use of Non-conformists; But for a correction, it is his express will,
and pleasure, that none presume to meet, in any place, until, such place, be
allowed, and the teacher of that congregation approved, by him: And lest, any
should apprehend difficulty, in obtaining, this allowance, and approbation, he
further declares, that the same shall extend, to all sorts of Non-conformists,
except Popish-recusants, to whom, he will in no ways, allow public places,
but only indulge them, as to the common exemption, from penal laws, and the
exercise of their worship, in their private houses only. This being the sum
of his Majesty's concession, over and above, the release of penal staruts, it
were as ill nature, and worse manners, to offer to criticize upon my Princes
bounty, as it were folly, to be fain of nothing: And therefore, I shall only,
heartily represent, such things, as do obviously occur, and cannot be hid:
And, 1. It is evident, that there is nothing as yet granted, but only a
purpose declared, which being in it self alterable, and in the present case, in
order to the innocent Nonconformist assuredly elicit, by our foreign wars,
and domestic fears, of what endurance it is like to prove, may easily be
resolved: Secondly, it is obvious, that the effect of this indulgence, is
presently to cut of from, and deprive all the faithful Ministers, and people,
of the benefit of meeting, either in the places where they have hitherto met,
or in their private houses, for the pure worship of God, (for these are the
express words of the declaration; To the effect, there may be no continuing of
conventicles, etc. and afterward, it is our express will and pleasure that
none presume to meet in any place, etc.) until these meetings, be cast in this
new mould, and, if the truly tender and conscientious Non-Conformist's, dare
not for the fear of God foresake, the assembling of themselves together, nor
discontinue their meeting, for worship, till the Court be at leisure, or think
it convenient, to make that assignement, or if they should scruple this
conveyance, as no doubt, a faithful minister, will be far, from an active
compliance, with such an enacted abomination, then, such have nothing to
expect, but the utmost of severity; and thus we see, these bowels, and the
tender mercies of this declaration, are unmasked cruelty: Thirdly, the places
are to be desired of and first allowed by his Majesty, and, that this
allowance, may be lawfully sought, upon the grounds of that duty of
protection, and assistance, which his Majesty owes to the Gospel, without
pleading this dissolute indulgence, I make it no queston: but, on the other
hand, that this, first, makes all still depend upon his absolute pleasure,
both as to number and continuance, is no less evident: yea secondly, this very
thing, is enough, to make the whole insignificant: for, many, especialy those
Non-conformists, who are persons of estate, or quality, will be unwilling to be
thus exposed to the view of the Court, as a dissentient party, reachable by
law, and moreover, the people, perceiving the increase of popery, and what
countenance and encouragemenr, they have from authority, whereby they are
become insolent, and terrible to the people, may begin, to be jealous, that
this course is only taken, to the end they may when met together, the more
easily be swallovved up at once, by those popish Cannibals; the things which
are past, and the things which are daily practiced, may creat a shrewd
suspicion amongst the people, of such a design, upon which considerations, the
assignement of a place by the Court, is very like, to affright men, from
following ordinances, or frequenting worship in those places: But, fourthly,
the Teacher must also first be approved by his Majesty; and that all the
liberty here promised, if it were ten times more, were too dearly purchased,
by this surrender, every one that knovveth the sufficiency, and necessity of
our Lord's Mission, will easily acknowledge; I grant, that, every Minister
should presume, and be very sensible of his Majesty's approbation, and as it
were rudeness professedly to undervalue it, so the power that he has, over
our bodies, may in many cases render it absolutely necessary; but, what is all
this, to the previous express approbation, here required? Certainly, if our
Lord's Authority, be a Minister's complete warrant, and the duty it lays on,
such, as may in many cases oblige him, to bear his Master's name, before Kings
and Princes, for a Testimony against them; the subjection of the Ministry, that
the compliance with this condition, does import, is, a manifest impingement,
against both: I might in the fifth place observe, the extension of this
concession, every whit as large, as the foregoing exemption, except in order to
Papists, and whereby all the blasphemies, and extravagancies of all other
errors, are, not only tollerat, but offered to be encouraged, but the thing
being so obvious, it were superfluous, to offer, to make it more plain. Sixthly,
this indulgence is thus further restricted, and cautioned. If any shall (says
his Majesty) presume to abuse this liberty and shall preach seditiously or to
the derogation of the doctrine, discipline or Government of the established
Church, etc. We do hereby givs them warning and declare we will proceed
against them with all imaginable severity. I shall not stand to observe, how
there is more here, then an insinuation, that the preacher, in order to his
being approved by his Majesty, must previously engage to this forebearance: its
but all reason, that he who gives the Commission, should also give the
instructions, set bounds, and limits, to it is exercise, and define the sphere
of it is activity, according as his Majesty, (that the world may the better
understand, the just extent, and native import, of that headship, which he
arrogats over the Church of England) in his letter to the Arch Bishop of York,
prescribes, what doctrines are to be taught, what not: If we will be preachers
created by the Court, and Emissaries of this supremacy, we must be
Court-parasits and court-pleasers too; but, then let us remember, that we
cease to be the servants of Jesus Christ: But the thing I mainly mark here,
is, that by this artifice, they are sure, either to make the indulged betray
the cause of Christ, by an unfaithful silence, or expose themselves to what the
all of that imaginable severity, wherewith they are menaced, will amount unto:
It Is true, the same politic considerations, which have moved them, for
quieting of the minds of the people, to mock them, with this shadow, maytye
them up also, for a season, from executing, this all imaginable severity
against such, who will be found guilty, of abusing this favor; yet,
considering, how the places must be all of public appointment, the preachers
and people also known, and that those places must be patent, and free to all
persons, viz. amongst the rest, to a knot of informers, who will no doubt be
designed, for each place, faithful men, who will acquit themselves, as the
Ambassadors of Jesus Christ, and so carry, in the exercise of their Ministry,
as they may have, their Master's approbation, of well done good and faithful
servants, may exspect, as the Court is at leisure, and have freed their hands
of other work, that they will make such then, after they have sleeped under the
deceitful shadow of this indulgence, while the Court being liberat from fear
of any trouble from them, was concurring with those who were destroying the
Protestant interest abroad, buy this indulgence, at an after. reckoning, with
the lose, if not of life, and liberty; yet of estate; for his May. will be
judge, of what is seditious preaching, and praying, etc. Hence, if a faithful
Minister, pray for the United provinces, now unjustly invaded, by a Popish
Prince, that they may not be destroyed, and that he may not give up, the
beloved of his soul, the reformed Church there, into the hand of such an enemy,
who would again turn these provinces, into a land of graven images, if also, he
should dissuade all who hear him from such a sinful conjunction, and regrat
before the Lord, as every faithful protestant has cause, that Englishmen,
professors of the same faith, should be employed, as instruments, to destroy
the faith they ought to defend, and that our hands, should be made use of, to
shed our brethrens blood, with whom, yea for whom, we should rather die, in the
defense of the reformed Religion, and if he should weep himself, and excit the
people to weep, because his Majesty is seduced, into this conspiracy, and
abandoned to such pernicious counsels, and courses. as at this time, and in
this juncture, to concur with a popish party, against a Protestant State, the
now visible bulwark, of the Reformed interest, not only without any just
provocation, on their part; but contrary to all engagements and obligations on
his: And moreover, if in stead of an unfaithful silence, a Minister should
seek, to deliver his own soul, by regrating, that his Majesty, is not only
left, to break his Covenant with the most high God, in reestablishing abjured
prelacy, and superstition; but also, in countenancing, and promoving of popery
and idolatry; which as no Godly man, who considers the times, and what the
Israel of God ought to do, dare forebeare for himself; so he dare not, though
he should die, for doing so, forebeare, to persuade, beseech, and obtest, the
People of the Lord, to pray with all manner of prayer and supplication, that
the great God, would appear, to confound the counsels and crush the
undertakings, of all the men, and Monarchs of this conspiracy, against his
great interest, and precious People: If, I say, a Minister of Jesus Christ,
should preach, exhort, and pray to this purpose, would his Majesty hold him
innocent? or forebeare to lay hold, on the first opportunity, of dealing with
him, as a seditious person, yea a Traitor? and adjudge also all who had been
his hearers, as guilty at least of misprison of treason? The case is so clear,
as it discovers plainly, the whole of this indulgence, to be rather a
Court-Trape, to catch, extinguish, and crush the faithful remnant, then the
least ease, or relief, to such as dare not, for fear of the Almighty,
foresake the truth, and prostitut the precious ordinances, of Christ, to the
lust of an Exotic Lord, or dare not shut their eyes, and be silent, when they
see courses taken, declarative, to conviction, of a formed design, to
establish the abomination of popery, and destroy the reformed Religion, at home
and abroad.

The last thing, that remains, is, the exception of Roman Catholics, from
this allowance, of public places; But lest this should grieve them, the former
discharge of penal laws, is not only repeated, in their favors; but, they
are further expressly, indulged, the exercise of their worship viz their
idolatrous mass, and all their other impious superstitions, in their private
houses, and that without any limitation of number or other restriction: I
cannot here stand, to express, all my just regrat; the mass again restored in
England, should no doubt be as much our deep affliction, as it is the Papists
exultation: As for their astriction to private houses, I say first, why is not
the like favor granted, to the truly Godly and Conscientious-Non-Conformist,
who may very justly scruple to sue for the favor of this indulgence, because
of it is conveyance, and upon other momentuous enough considerations? Shall he
who dare not for fear of making himself guilty, of Lose Majesty against Jesus
Christ, by accepting a favor, which in its conveyance, establishes, in the
person of the indulger, a supremacy only competent to the Son of God, be less
capable of this favor, then he who denis this Supremacy, to be competent to
his Majesty, and holds it to be proper, to that child of perdition, the
Antichrist? Yea, he is not so capable of our favor, as our Catholic subjects
are: I am sorry for it, but why? What Is the matter? His Majesty gives you the
reason, of the inequality of this distribution; because forsooth, they are
seditious conventicles, and therefore, liberty to worship God in private houses,
must not be permitted to them; but their is no fear of Sedit^on from Papists,
(good men!) we understand one another better, then to fear any harm from such
bosom friends: well, it may be so; but, it is time, when the Popish party, are
thus professedly, the darling of the Court, and all it is conclusions, are so
exactly calculat, to the meridian of that interest, for the poor protestants,
to remember, the yet recent massacre of Ireland, lest, Britain drink of the
same cup, and become the stage, whereon, this same funest Tragedy, or a more
bloody one, be acted over again: Secondly the Papists are confined to private
houses; that is to say, Whitehal, St fames, Somerset House, and the greatest,
and most capacious palaces in England, while, the poor Non-Conformists, may not
make use of their own houses, and are not like in have, to build upon the
lubrick base of this indulgence, other houses: Thirdly, that this restriction
is no incumberance to the Papists, is abundantly clear; nay, if we advert, to
man's strange curiosity, especially after error, the attraction of this
privacy, may in all likelihood, prove more advantageous to their interest,
then, if their Godless, and ridiculous mummery, were set up to open view, and
derision, in Public Churches: Seeing therefore, that the Papists recommended by
no necessary, or convenient reason have, (notwithstanding of their gross
errors and superstitions, with the many important and ancient laws that stand
against them being considered) obtained, the greatest benefit by this
indulgence, whether the favor designed for them, be not it is, principal
motive, and aim, I leave it to every man's discerning? Now what our present
conjunction with the French, in an unrighteous war, against the Protestant
Stats abroad, with this licensing of idolatry, and encouraging the Popish
faction at home, may produce; The Lord in his mercy prevent: And as I have
plainly laid out, the insincerity, insufficiency, and uncertainty of this
indulgence, in behalf of conscientious Non Conformists; so, I am very hopeful,
that neither the present allurement, of carnal ease, nor the deceitiul
confidence, of simulat favors, shall ever make them abandon, that solicitous
care, and zealous concern, they ought always to bear, in their hearts, and
be ready to witness, when thereto called, for the glory of God, and interests
of truth and righteousness, both at home and abroad.

Having thus particularly considered, and weighed the import, of both these his
Majesty's declarations, and having found nothing in the one, which upon a
sober search, may justify this war, (whereinto we are precipitat; nor in the
other, that can quiet, or satisfy the truly conscientious Nonconformist; but
on the contrair, much in both, which may fill the mind, of all the fearers of
God, with terror at the apprehensions, of what shall be, the dismal and
dreadful consequences, of such an undertaking, against our confederats, and
such uncandid dealing with God, I designed in this review to have subsisted.

But yet I hope, every true-hearted Englishman, will bear with me, if, while
I see the interest of the English nation, dragged at the French heels, and sold
to a base subserviency to their aspiring greatness, I take liberty once more,
to evince and insist upon what in my first Paper I touched more brieflly viz.
the perfect opposition, which this conjunction with the French, has, unto the
welbeing and true interest of the nation: Let it therefore be supposed, that
the English Fleet should beat the Dutch, quit off the sea, and at the same
time, the King of France with his numerous and potent army, assisted with his
Majesty's thousands under the command of his son, should invade, destroy, lay
wast, and make desolat, all the places of the United provinces, wherever he
comes, and the Dutch by this defeat at sea, and invasion by Land be brought,
to such confusion and perplexity, that they shall neither be in case to set
presently to sea again, nor able to encountre this Potent enemy by land, (which
is the thing designed and desired, and that, to which all the vigorous
endeavors of these confederat Kings are directed) well, let us make this
supposition, that their designs are thus far accomplished (though, grant not
O Lord the desire of the wicked, further not their wicked device, least they
exalt themselves, ought to be, and no question is, the desire of all, who love
our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity through the earth) and that the Dutch in
stead of being able to deal any longer or debate with these Kings, by open
force of Arms, be reduced to the necessity in this exigent, of making the
best, and most advantageous peace they can: Is it to be imagined, they will
betake themselves to the King of England, and come under his shadow and
protection for shelter, from the French fury? It Is true, amongst the rest of
our fooleries, whereby we embolden our selves, in this engagement, this is laid
down for one, which we judge will not fail us, viz. that we can always make
Peace with the Dutch, when we have driven them to desperate distress, at
pleasure; but they are wiser men, then to court us any longer for kindness:
For, first, the experience they have had of the impossibility of fixing us, or
making us stand firm to our engagements, and Treaties, will utterly alienat,
discourage, and dissuade from this, where there is a choice: Secondly, his
Majesty's having laid down this for a Principle, and the endeavors which have
been, to instill it in the minds of such, who could be impressed by
Court-suggestions, that, if England would floorish, Holland must, if not
utterly destroyed, yet be reduced to a state of slavery, and bondage, nothing
inferior unto the Spanish yoke, (for the dominion which we affect over the
seas, would be stretched to a length, that would know no bounds, or limits,
but our own lust and our Courteours avarice; and what encouragement, they may
have to come under the shadow of men of these principles, wise men may judge?)
Thirdly the cry of his Majesty's oppressed subjects at home, and the
consideration, how the Court has sucked out and swallowed up the substance of
the nation, and drained, all it is treasures, and yet are still lean (for all
they have devoured, has only made them more insatiable) will make the Dutch,
judge very rationaly, unless they were able, to turn rocks, seas, and sand
into Gold, they could never by giving, satiat the appetit of the English Court:
And while they see, contrair to all honor and true interest, how, a stop is
at least put upon the exchecquer, which was the only thing remaining, to
preserve the credit of the nation, and leave merchants in some case to trade,
they cannot but easily foresee that such will make no bones to suck out all the
marrow, and then gnaw the bones, of these provinces: And to all these add, in
the fourth place, how they must needs look upon the King of England, as the
principal author, and unhappy instrument, of all these imminent and incumbent
calamities, and may very rationaly conclude, if he had not in this juncture,
conspired against them, with the French King, that either, the King of France,
would not have undertaken the war, or if he had, that they in an ordinary
providence, could have defended themselves, and their just liberties, against
all his force: When I say, they must needs look upon the King of England, as
the spring and source, of all that calamity they feel, or fear, and perceive
his propensnesse, to ruinethem, and how that, contrary to all Covenants,
Treaties, rational offers of satisfaction, even to pretended injuries,
condescensions, and stretches beyond the just exigent, and tenor of any Treaty,
or transaction, yea and obligations heaped upon him, in advancing the Prince of
Orange, (which, as it was made the great argument, to determine those, who were
a little reluctant, to consent to his advancement; so, it made the most
rational infallibly conclude, his assistance, upon that advancement, against
the French attempts) how, I say, that notwithstanding of all these bonds, of
honor, interest, faith, Religion, righteousness; and obligations, he could
not so much, as be gained, to an easy neutrality; but, as if, the utter ruin
of the Dutch, and their extirpation, or reduction, from a stare of liberty, to
a state of bondage, had the closest of connexions, with his satisfaction, he,
to the prostituting of his honor, leads the way, to the French King, and as if
malice and blind fury, were the sole conducter in this affair, draws the
first sword, and forgetting to consult his own fame, with a pyratick violence,
anterior to all intimation of war, falls upon the Dutch merchant-ships: As
these things put together, with many more of the like nature, must make the
Dutch conclude him, the most enraged adversary, and implacable enemy; so, it
must of necessity, alienat their mind from him above all mortals: And now upon
the forementioned supposition, (which I hope shall never exist) that they must
put themselves under the Potection of one of these two, they will certainly be
balanced, toward the French Alliance, as the more placable enemy, the more
sure, and advantageous friend: And as it is more then probable to wise men,
that the King of France has conduced the King of England, to such an unworthy
breach of Alliance, upon this very design, to drive the Dutch, if possible, to
this sad necessity; so it is equally obvious, how the French King endeavors
by all means, so to influence the conclusions of the English Cabal, and manage
the advantage he has thereby over the King of England, as may render him most
hateful to the Dutch: For having prevailed with him, first, to draw him to this
shameful breach of Treaty with them, he drives him thereafter to make such a
detastable attempt upon their merchant-ships; and observing likewise how in his
declaration for war against the Dutch (wherein also he will have the King of
England to preceed, that he may know the better how to form his so, as may
best subserve his design) he alleges many injuries, and pretends to such a
dominion over the seas, as is subversive of the liberty of the Dutch, and
utterly inconsistent with the prosperity of the Provinces, because destructive
of their trade; he then emitteth his declaration of war, wherein there is
nothing mentioned or adduced for a cause, save a French floorish, for his
Honor: Yea he gives the Dutch to understand, that he does not envy their
greatness, nor design the prejudice of their provinces; nay on the contrair,
that he has a favor for them, and how all his quarrel is confined to some
particular persons in the Government, against whom he has a displeasure: And
perceiving withal, how the King of England has not only made himself the
common detestation of the Dutch, by this late act of manifest pyracy but as if
no bonds, no Treaties, neither reguard to his own reput or renown in the World,
could be of sufficient weight and value to tie him up from doing them all the
injuries, which his power makes possible; he adds to the former violence,
the injustice of seizing upon and detaining all the merchant-ships, which were
in his ports at the eruption of this war, expressly contrair to the terms of
the 32 Art. of that Treaty at Breda: The French King (I say) perceiving this,
that he may commend his fidelity, clemency, and friendship to the Dutch (as he
does his honor to the World) above the King of England's, as he has done no
act of hostility against them anterior to his declaration; so he grants them
six months time, to remove all their Merchant-ships and goods out of his
dominions, without lose or molestation: By all which he seems to intimat to
the Dutch that he is neither so ingrained not implacable an enemy against them
as the King of England, yea there is a tacit invitation couched, even in his
denunciation of war, to accost him for kindness, with hope of acceptance,
(and well may he, for hereby he maks himself master of both, and does more
certainly triumph over the King of England, and eclipse the glory of that
nation, then over the Dutch, and so hitteth the mark he aimed at indeed, viz.
the French honor) Now as the preferablenesse of the French Alliance, things
standing thus, will be demonstrable to the Dutch from their own interest, and
advantage, for by this means, though, they may lose somewhat of their former
luster; yet they will easily see, that it is the interest of the King of
France, to have them a floorishing People, when they are so much his; so, on
the other hand, will any doubt, but all reason of state and Policy, will make
the French ready to listen to a proposal of accommodation from the Stats, and
abandon the English, as having now served himself sufficiently of them, when
they have sweat out floods of English blood and treasure, to row his French
Majesty to his port: For, first, he knows very well, though he have at
present debauched the penurious and profligat Court of England, into this
conjunction with him, against the Dutch; that, yet, the spirit of the English
nation can never be debased into the same compliance, with his designs; the
prudent part, yea the generality of the nation, retaining still, their noble
ascendent over the French, and that antipathy unto them, that, though the Court
party are sunk below men, and cease to be Patriots, (not careing for the reput,
and honor of their nation, whose renown, together with their own fame, they
have shipwrack't) yet, at this very instant, they would, if at all necessitat
to have a war, notwithstanding of all the artifice and endeavors of the Court,
to inflame them into a rage against the Dutch, with much more cheerfulness,
alacrity, and readiness of mind, draw their sword against the French in
defense of the Dutch, then be dragged by the Court, to so unrighteous, and
dishonorable a war, against their friends and brethren: The certain knowledge
I say, that the King of France has, that this is the genius, and pulse of the
English nation, to abhor as death, the holding of the French stirrup; yea,
the rational grounds he may have, to persuade beyond debate, that if these very
men, whom he has charmed, by his aurum potabile, into an oblivion of their own
honor and nation's interest, be once awaked out of this golden dream, (which
does not imply a contradiction but they may) they will abandon, with a blush at
their own baseness, his interest, and by an after strenuous opposition, seek
to wipe off the stain, of so base a compliance, and be avenged upon him for
their two eyes, will make him ready, to close with the Dutch, being, together
with the world, convinced, that, he has in this, obtained the utmost of
advantage, he could have proposed or promised to himself, by engaging, or
rather seducing the Court of England, unto his assistance, and judging, as he
has reason, that he is hereby sufficiently repayed, for all the French
Millions, which that Court, has swallowed up: Secondly, as this will make him
readily listen, to a proposal from the Dutch, so, it will make him willingly
condescend, to give them easy, and honorable conditions, (though I hope God
shall prevent such a dishonor to them) yea, he will argue himself, into a
necessity, (contrair to the particular insolent domineering humor of the
French) to maintain them, if not in the same degree of honor, liberty, and
luster, yet, in their full strength; it being obvious, that by having engaged
them to him, he has fairly paved his way, to an easy conquest, of this part
of the world: The Spanish Netherlands, will fall into his hands, nor will the
Emperor be able, to make head against him: Spain also must follow their fate;
and poor England, having spent their strength and treasure, to advance him to
this greatness, must bow their neck, to the French yoke: What is then become
of our foolish supposition, that there was no cause for England to fear the
French greatness? Why? France (says the Court) having no nursery of seamen,
we will maintain our dominion of the seas, non will cope, or compet with us, if
once we had the Hollander, under hatches; and while we retain our dominion by
sea, it were ridiculous to fear, the French by land: But alas, have the
French, so blinded the Court, with the dust of their Gold, that they cannot
see, one inch, before their nose? Do they not easily foresee, the misery and
bondage, they are bringing upon the nation, and how, they are selling the
honor, and liberty of their country, to it is inveterat enemies? Well, the
French have not a nursery of seamen, comparable to the English: Be it so, but,
when the English by their unrighteousness, folly, and inconsideration, have
driven the Dutch to the necessity of becoming one with the French, have they
then no nursery? England knows, to it is cost, that Holland has: And if ever
France be in case, to reckon them his (which, as death, is to be deprecat)
then, the King of England must resolve henceforth, to quit all his pretensions
to the Flage, and be at a point in this, that his men of war must strike, to
the French pleasure boats: the Nation at home, must tremble, at the French
greatness, their walls the shiping of England, will not then hold him out, he
being now in case, to force his passage, through them: our foreign plantations
must signify as much to us, as the French and Dutch in a conjunction, will
permit, either something, or nothing: Our honor, and renown, which we have had
amongst other Nations, must be buried in the gulf of contempt, and lie
expiring without hope of a recovery, under the French insolence: who will then
compassionat the poor English Nation? Nay, who will not say, that it is a
righteous thing with God, since, we who would needs in a blind rage, run upon
our friends to ruin them, without cause, should be ensnared, in the work of
our own hands, and tumbled headlong in the ditch, which we had dug for
others? Who amongst the nations will pity us? Or if our distress should move
compassion, who dare offer to help us? Oh poor England, how do thy Rulers, post
thee to thy ruin? We have fallen once under the hand of the Dutch, and our
disgrace, has accresced to their glory; but now, we must fall, into the hand
of the French, and instead of wearing the flower de Luce, in our scutcheon, the
King of France must have our Lion, and Unicorn in his: And thus have we
debased our selves and entailed bondage upon the Posterity: And, if the Dutch
were a People given to revenge, what ever grief and regrat, their dependence
upon France might be to them, yet, they would not only have this satisfaction,
to see those enslaved, who had designed their bondage, and whose hands had been
made use of in wreathing the yoke about their neck; but, see themselves chiefly
made use of, and maintained by the French, to force the English to serve him:
And withal the Dutch should see themselves, freed from the slavish fear of the
King of England's vain pretensions to the dominion of the sea, and set at
liberty, to follow their trade without trouble; and as the trade, would then be
cerainly taken from England, in these parts; so it would be at the French and
Dutch their option, whether to raze, and root out, name and thing of all
English Plantations abroad.

Though, these be things to be entertained in their possibility, by all the
lovers, of Religion, righteousness, and the nation, with horror, and
detestation, and I pray and hope shall never have any being, beyond what a
supposition may give them; yet, he must blind his eyes, and abandon his reason,
who will deny the nativenesse of the connection, betwixt the worst of all these
supposed miseries, and mischiefs, and the King of England's engaging, in this
war, with the French, against the Dutch: The ruin of the Protestant interest,
this day, through the World: The ruin of the liberty, honor, trade, precious
and dear concerns, of the English nation; the ruin, of the Prince of Orange
his interest, yea the ruin, disgrace, and perpetual infamy, of the actors
themselves, is wraped up in, and connected with, this shameful war: have we
not now by our deep Politics, bravely bowled away the honor of the nation,
while the French, both give ground, and byasse? These are our new unhappy
politics, they tend to this, and may end here, if the Lord in mercy do not
interpose, to prevent it: so, that, though men were turned mere Gallio's, as
to the interest of Christ, and Religion in the World, yea turned enemies
thereto; yet, no man representing things to himself as they are, and vveighing
these tumultuous transactions, in the balance of reason, or considering their
obvious tendency and import; if he retain the spirit of a true Englishman, if
he consult the honor of his nation, if he truly love his Majesty, and wish
the stability of his throne, but must, not only look upon himself, as obliged
to withdraw, from all concurrence in this war; but interpose in his station, to
deliver King and Court, lapsed into this moral madness, from the occecation of
this fury, whereby, in their indeliberation and rage, they are pulling ruin
upon themselves and the nation, by drawing the sword.

I know very well, in all I have said upon this head of Interest, I shall, be
looked upon as grossly mistaken in my hypothesis; because, what I account
interest and the thing to be chiefly reguarded, and earnestly contended for,
has not a being at all in the Albe of our new politics: nay, something is
substitut in it is place, as inconsistent with, so natively destructive of it:
And therefore all these disswasives deduced from the head of Interest as I have
stated it, must with the hypothesis evanish as of no consideration or weight,
to dissuade from our present enterprise. It will be readily granted by all,
that if the old Interest of England, viz. the preservation of Religion, in it is
reformation, whereto by the good hand of our God upon us we had attained, the
safety and good of the people, the ancient splendour and glory of the Nation,
the just freedom and liberty of Parliaments, the desirable harmony betwixt
his Majesty and them, to the doing of all things (especially things of such
moment, as a war, wherein there is an association with an old enemy to the
English Nation and Interest, and an engagement against our ancient friends,
deprecating, with all the submissenesse which became a State, our displeasure,
and entreating in a most obliging manner our covenanted assistance, against an
enemy, by whom, if he conquer them, we are crushed, our posterity also and all
our precious interests are exposed unto the danger of utter ruin) with joint
consent and mutual satisfaction, whereby the cheerful concurrence of all his
Majesty's subjects is assured, by which means also, he himself is beloved and
honored at home, feared and reguarded by the nations abroad, the security,
satisfaction, trade and treasure of the nation, is ensured and promoted, etc.
If Interest be considered as comprehensive of, and constitut by these and the
like; then no doubt, it must be yielded, that the considerations evincing the
manifest opposition of the present engagement to all these, have a sufficiency
of weight, to dissuade from a further progress in this unhappily begun war,
yea persuade a retreat; which were certainly a more glorious victory, because
demonstrative to the World, that our lusts and passions had not the ascendent
of our reason, then if our sword were bathed and our hands embrewed in the
blood of these against whom it is now drawn and stretched out; yea this were a
more certain way, to a safe victory over them (I mean an overcoming them with
kindness to a cheerful condescendence unto, and a ready compliance with all
our just demands) then ever we can expect, as the issue of so unrighteous and
irreligious a war. But if somewhat else be substitut in the place of that,
which the vvisest have hitherto judged the Interest of the nation, I must
grant, I have missed the mark at which I aimed, and confess, that my
considerations are not apposite dissvvasives, from what is now driven. But
what can this be? Some may think the thing aimed at, which with it is seeming
desireablenesse has dazeled us into this distraction, has by our procedour so
obviously discovered it self, that it can no longer escape observation: It Is
plain his Maj. aims at being absolute and designeth to rule the nation,
independently from the advice of Parliaments, which are now looked upon, rather
as an encumberance to him, in the exercise of his royal government, and an
eclipse of that glory, which he judges competent for a Prince, then any real
support to his royal authority and greatness: In plain English, the French
Government is affected by our English Court, which we suppose can never be
sufficiently illustrious, while there must be such an unbecoming dependence
upon Parliaments, for pitiful subsidies and sums to be raised by their order,
to maintain our royal grandeur: This which has been so insupportable a yoke,
upon the neck of our royal Ancestors, whereby they have been bound to the good
behavior, tied up, restrained, yea often, to gratify their subjects humor, in
order to the gaining their consent for a subsidy, have been necessitat, and
compelled to cross their own royal inclination, and commit a rape upon their
pleasure; this yoke, we say, must once for all be burst and broken, and this
badge of limited soveraignity, be buried in the final discharge of such
Parliaments: The dispose of the Treasure as well as the Militia of the nation,
must be in our own hand, then, and not before, will we be in case, as becomes,
to live in royal splendour, to give suitable rewards for signal services,
without being obnoxious to have account asked of us, or the question put, how
we spend our treasure; to keep under and crush petulant insolents at home, and
chastise proud enemies abroad: In a word, Stat pro ratione voluntas in state
affairs, as we have arrogat it, in Church, matters (which is the more wicked
and most dareing attempt of the two) is the great interest, and that which we
will and must have: This is the darling and Diana of the Court, to which all
the other true interests of the English Nation must be sacrificed. If so, the
scheme I grant is changed: But is it credible, that infatuation itself, can
fix us in this resolution? Truly the Universe of reason does reclaim: The
desperatnesse of such an enterprise has made wise men shut their eyes, upon
all probabilities of it is intendment, and stop their ears, at all reports and
suggestions which were assertive of the Court's hatching such a cockatrice, as
calumnies; since reason did repugne and abhor it, as the greatest deviation
from it is conduct, and most desperate course, in the undertaker, imaginable; but
yet men cannot always shut their eyes, he who stops his ear at the
reports of another, cannot with the same facility, abandon or give the defiance
to his own reason.

It is not necessar for my present purpose, to make a perfect enumeration of
all things, which may persuade and put beyond debate, that this is the Court
aim; but if it must needs be granted, by what has been said, that there is a
clear and undeniable opposition, betwixt engaging in this war with the French,
against the Dutch, and all the true interests of England, sacred and civil;
then our precipitation into this engagement, gives a shrewd suspicion, that
we are only prevailed with, and overcome by this consideration, to assist
the French against the Dutch; that we as a requital, only commensurable to
that service, may have the French assistance, sor rasing the foundations of
England's liberty, and substituting our own lust, in the place of it is Magna
charta: This design has made all essays for peace on the Dutch their part
insignificant, and has persuaded above all other considerations, unto this
association with the French: And truly the things which at first were only
groaned under, as acts of maladministration, without the suspicion of a
further design, then what the impetuousnesse of our lusts, cileing the eyes
of our reason, drove us to, will now when reflected upon, and collated with
present practices and future appearances, amase men at the malign aspect they
have upon England's liberty.

I need not involve my self into the labyrinth, of recollecting all things in
the Court's procedour and practice, since his Majesty's return, unto this
present day; or compare them with this project, and consider the nativenesse
of their tendency to the production of this monster. Let his Maj. carriage, in
reference to his Parliament be a little inquired into, and see, if it will not
put the thing beyond debate. At his first entry; the Parliament which called
him home, must be dissolved, and in lieu of another reward for that great
service, they are dismissed with this complement, viz. his May; will have them
known and honored to posterity, by the name, of, Beati Pacifici: well then,
Englands blessed Parliaments have their period and exeunt, at his May: entry to
his royal Government: What then comes next? (it is fit to be silent, where
experience speaks that, which if it were told in it is most sober dress,
might argue the speaker to be prompted by malice) But what could be the cause
of this dissolution? It Is obvious enough; for whatever excess of loyalty
appeared in hastening home his Majesty, and installing him in the Government,
without sufficient security for Religion and liberty, (an error in the first
concoction) yet there were many amongst them, who being good Patriots, and
worthy Statsemen, could never have been overcome, to a compliance with such a
design, nor to the countenancing of our other extravagancies; and therefore as
an unfit tool for our work they must be laid aside, and a new one called. The
Court in the mean time perceiving, how vain expectations of Halcion-dayes, had
besorted the nation, into a deep inconsideration of what did belong to it is
Peace and Prosperity, and observing, how there were none now to peep or move
the wing, against the Court current; But whatsoever the King did, either
pleased all the people, or the more prudent were under a necessity in this
universal distraction, to dissemble their displeasure, and suffer, without
saying or doing any thing to the contrair, dangerous encroachments and breaches
to be made upon their liberty, though the purport of these was manifest;
forgetting the old maxim obsta principiis, etc. The Court I say perceiving
this to be the temper, or rather giddiness of the nation, do not stick at
breach of privilege, in the election of members for the following Parliament,
which was so palpable and gross, as of the bulk, when gathered together, it
might well have been said, that in stead of our old renowned Parliaments
without a parallel in the world, for free-spirited noble Patriots, we had got a
Court-juncto, and the privileges of the PeoPeople, and interest of the nation,
put in the hand of those, who would be prodigal and profuse, to a
boundlessenesse, as of the Estate and Treasure of the Kingdom, so of it is more
valuable liberty and precious concerns: Now I shall be loath, to trace them in
their wild deviations and odd extravagancies; but the nation must behold with
the tear in their eye, (and it may be, some of the instruments of their
misery, being cured of their former Frenzy, and awaked out of their lethargy,
by the cries of the oppressed, and the noise of the ruin of the nation, in
whose rubbish they themselves are like to be buried, as a recompense of what
they are guilty of, against the honor and interest of their country, sigh out
their had we wist) their liberties and estats in the hand of such, as resolve
to run to all the excesses, to which the Court-riot will drive them: There, is
without more debat, a surrender of the Militia to his May: And though they seem
to retain the key of the Nation's treasure; yet it is not so much to lock it
up, and keep it in the possession of the just proprietors, as in effect so to
squise the Kingdom, as if the sole purpose of their convocation had been, to
fall upon inventions and find out mids, how to extract all the Spirits of
the nation, and leave it a caput mortuum, wherein they showed themselves such
Masters of Art, that no man can remember, how they drained the Kingdom, to the
drieing up of it is substance, and what vast sums were collected and extorted,
without judging the determination difficult, vvhither their monstrous folly
in giving, or the Court's prodigious and incredible profuseness, in lavishing
out, vvasting and throvving away that treasure, be matter of most amasement?
Hovvever, as this is sure, if England had been invaded by a foreign enemy,
they might at a lovver rate, have bought themselves into a State of liberty,
from the conquerours bondage, then what has been exacted of them, for no
other purpose, but to make their bonds strong; so this is also certain, that if
the sums collected for the Court, were computed, and the total compared,
with their present pinching penury, it would together with the nation,
astonish the world, how such a treasure, in so short time could have been
dilapidat; unless on purpose shoveled in the sea, or svvept away by an
invisible curse: But the thing which I mainly mark here, is, the connection
this carreer of Parliament has, with the advance of our projected
absolutnesse: The nation finding themselves thus exacted upon, and betrayed to
the Court's avarice by the guardians of their liberty, do universally hate the
Parliament, as betrayers of their trust, and sacrificers of their Interest, to
an insatiable lust: Thus, that which used to be the darling of the People, is
become the common detestation of the nation; which the Court perceiving, and
knovving how this did hasten their design to it is maturity, having set them a
going, keep them in motion: The generality being by these means grieved and
vexed, some fevv, who shared the spoil, only excepted; and the more prudent
and Religious part of the nation, who could have digested with more patience,
the loss of their estats, must, to complet their misery, find themselves by
these mischiefs, which were framed into laws, deprived of purely dispensed
ordinances, and robbed of their faithful Ministers, reformation overturned,
vain abjured Prelacy, with all it is concomitant plagues reintroduced,
thousands of faithful Ministers, driven in one day, from feeding the Flocks of
Christ, they and their people exposed, to the implacable malice of the Court,
and debauched Clergy, whereby the Parliament drew upon themselves, as the
enacters and decre'ers of such abominations and cruelties, the hatred of all
the lovers of Religion and righteousness: This being brought to pass, some
Court-Trappans, are prompted, to deal with the fanatics (as they called them)
of several persuasions, some must pass for great friends to the Presbiterians,
others to the Independents, etc. And the work of these is, to represent his
Majesty, as very propitious and favorable to men of tender consciences, and
that what he did, was not so much from an innate propensenesse to persecut good
men, as from a forced and necessitat compliance, with his more rigid and
implacable Parliament, from whom, unless he went alongs with them, in passing
such acts as they were pleased to make, and give way at least to the execution
of them, he could not expect that they would appear zealous and foreward in
the supply of his wants: yea, his Majesty was represented as so reluctant to
execut these severe laws with rigor, that he was in hasard, by an excess of
lenity, and indulgence, not only to fall under a mistake with his Parliament,
prejudicial to his affairs; but by the same means, to expose his own, and their
Authority to contempt; and that these things might not appear, what they were,
indeed pure fictions; some of the leading men of these parties, are admitted to
kiss his Majesty's hand, and have something with a smile suggested to them,
whereby they went away, giddy and intoxicat with vain expectations. Now it
is, our good and gracious King, but our evil and cruel Parliament: Thus the
sujects, in stead of being render, as of old, of Parliaments, begin not only
to be little solicitous, what contempt the Court cast upon them; but can behold
with satisfaction, these trampled upon, who had trod under foot the honor of
the nation: Now men begin to think and say, it were better for us, to be under,
and bear with the infirmities of one King, who is placable and exorable, then
under the malign influence of such a conglobat constellation of Tyrants, from
the scorchings of whose rigours and rage, the shadow of our Prince, even when
he interposeth, is not a sufficient shelter. The Court with much satisfaction
observe these malcontents and murmurings, as exactly quadrating with their
design, and laugh amongst themselves, to see the poor people terrified and
tremble, at the meeting together of our Parliament, as of a company, who had
conspired their ruin and bondage: Well, after they have served the Court, in
pillaging the Kingdom, and brought it to poverty (which carries along
withit, a baseness and lowness of spirit) and have in a few years, squandred
away and sucked out, for satiating the court, more of it is substance and
treasure, then had been bestowed upon all the Kings, which have reigned in
England these hundred years (beside the manifold miseries, which during this
time, befell the nation, by Pestilence, sword, fire, inundations, the decay of
trade, etc.) are not only hated by the nation, as the Vulture which has torn
out it is bowels, gnawed it is noble parts, and having (by dishing up their
country into a consume, for curing the Court of it is desperately incurable
leanness) turned the whole into a complete skeleton; but also despised by the
Court, when they can set nothing before them, to satiat their appetit, but the
dry bones of adistressed nation, drained of all it is marrow and moisture, are,
without the peoples regret, prorogued with a frovvne. Yet such was the known
penury of the Court, as every one began to think, since the extremity of their
want called for a present supply, that necessity would (because they could
not call them together before the time appointed) force his May: to dissolve
them, and emit writs for calling a new Parliament, when, behold on a sudden,
to the amasement of all men (excepting such who were privy to the mystery)
there is a new prorogation, in all it is circumstances (which for brevity I
pass) so declarative of our design, that the Parliament it self, by whose
means the nation was now reduced to this miserable condition; must at length
awake, and see themselves laid aside, as a broken vessel, wherein, he who
formed them, had no more pleasure; and together with them, we have a
fairvvell to Parliaments: In a word, our design must at last set up it is
head, and discover it self, things are come to their just maturity: Now wise
men see, that a war with the Dutch, and a conjunction with the French, as the
sole and proper expedient, to finish what is brought to such ripeness, is
inevitable: If the millions, for which we are become stipendiary to the King
of France, will not serve the turn, we will both give the nation, a foretast
of what we intend for them, by shutting the exchequer; and when Parliaments
can do no more, make a trial, what the unaccustomed weight of absolute
soveraignity can squise from them; and also furnish our selves, with a
sufficiency, for carrying on our design: If a project of absolute foveraignity
be not fairly deduceable from these courses, and if his Majesty be not engaged
beyond a retreat to hold on, when he has run so great a length, as he knows
even this Parliament (how much more a new one) would declare against, condemn,
seek how to redress what is past, and effectually prevent such exorbitancies
for the future, let wise men judge.

But suppose the design be, from these and many such things, demonstrable
beyond denial, do not the difficulties, yea moral impossibilities, which seem
to lie in the way of it is accomplishment, persuade to a surcease, phohibit the
attempt, and secure the nation from the fear of so fatal-like an enterprise?
Sure, the funest consequences of windeing up soveraignity a pegge too high,
are too fresh and recent, to be quite foregotten; and can these be remembered,
without foreseing what is like to follovv upon our graspeing at, an every way
absolute soveraignity (little different from a Turkish Tyranny) over a
free-spirited people, generously emulous above all other Kingdoms, of the
glory of a free nation, which has been worthily contended for, and nobly
maintained by our Antcestors? It can neither be hid from his Majesty, nor the
men of this contriveance, how this cannot be fixed upon and followed, without
resolving, not only to involve the nation once more in a bloody war; but to
delete and extinguish all true Englishmen, without leaving a man, who
retains, as more valueable then his life the noble disposition of the nation,
unpatient of Tyrranny, because above slavery: Yea, suppose the French King
should, in lieu of our gallant soldiers now sent, or rather basely sold to
support this Tyranny, and subserve his further designs, after we had destroyed
our own subjects, send us over thousands of his French paisants, born under
this yoke, to be a seed of bastard-English slaves, he is not sure but the
nature of the soil and Clime might change their quality: But laying aside the
desperatnesse of this design, and the considerations of the cruelties it would
drive us to, before we were so settled, that we were beyond fear of being
shaken, does nothing of danger to the contriver, appear in the undertaking?
The men of this counsel, cannot be ignorant, that if a war be raised upon this
head, it must end in the perfect and final overthrow of one of the parties (and
are they invulnerable?) especialy, considering, that the subjects are now made
sensible, how vain it is any more to trust Court-Oaths, covenants, or any
assurance of the like nature, which will, or can be given, and that not only
because of a practical breach of faith; but because, it is become a Court
maxim, and a principle in our new politics, that no Oath, covenant, or
promise, given by, or elicit from his Maj. by his subjects, in a time of war
betwixt them, binds him longer, then he is in case, with his own safety, to
tell them, it was rebellion to require it, and to make them know, and find he
is able to break it; yea it may be, to make all strong, and free him from the
guilt of perjury for doing so, nulla fides cum haereticis, may be made use of
in it is season.

But these things seem to be digested with us, and as they have been of no
weight or merit, to dissuade from the contriveance; so, if they should demurre
us in the execution of our purpose, it would argue an irresolution,
pusillanimity and lowness of spirit, whereof we resolve not to be guilty:
Rubiconem trajecimus, jacta est alea, the stravving of our way with the dead
bodies of such insolents, as dare mutter their dissatisfaction, or more
manifesty seek to mar, or set themselves to oppose this glorious design, of
pure absoluteness, is resolved upon, and if we be necessitat to open our way
with the sword, to this domination, we are sufficiently provided, and in case
for it; so that on all accounts we may promise our selves, either no
opposition, or so vveak, as will rather encourage (having thereby some color
of justice to cut off at once and for ever, such, who dare attempt to cross
our royal inclinations) then, be able to advance their opposition, to a making
of our enterprise difficult, let be desperate: What should dissvvade or divert,
where there is nothing of resistance to be feared? for first, the Clergy of the
nation having prostitut their Conscience, to serve ourlust, that, without more
bebate, our royal pleasure is to them the law, even in things sacred, and
knowing their dependence upon us, in esse and operari, they will be so far from
crossing our pleasure in Civils, that we have ensured their assistance, in
enslaving the nation; and as they have benumbed their conscience, into an
acquiescence to our will, in the matters of God; so we can easily command them,
in despite of reason and Religion, to palliat, whatever of rage may be in the
prosecution of our design, with some color of either necessity or justice. As
for the fanatics, the division which Julian the Apostat endeavored to creat
and keep up amongst Christians, ne unanimem timeret plebem, is, an easy work
for us: Their own mutual animosities, jealousies, diffidence and strivings,
give us rather matter of encouragment, then fear: But besides, we have under
color of grace and favor, drawn off, some leading fanatics, to accept of our
pardon, whereby, as the multitude of their old followers, have not the same
confidence, to communicate counsels with them, about creating us any
disturbance; so, the persons thus decoyed, have more reguard to their own
safety (knowing how easily we can now reach them) then either to speak, or
suffer themselves to be spoke to, in these matters: And for the generality of
the fanatics, our late indulgence will so far attain it is end, as to charm
them into a sopor, whereof we are put out of doubt, by these solemn
acknowledgements, which have been made, and thanks which have been given us,
for such an expression of our royal bounty, and clemency; (poor dreamers!) and
vvithal, for a perfect security, from the counter-vvorkings of the fevv more
restless and implacable sort of fanatics, we have, by the Ministry of some
of the same Spirit and temper, (for this very purpose, on our part, admitted to
our favor) made sure, that nothing shall be hatched amongst them, which shall
not be heard by us, so, as we may crush it ere it can crawl out of it is shell;
seeing the persons admitted to this grace, must maintain the credit they have
got, by giving us notice, at least when enquired at, of all they know; and as
each of these (being persons of different persuasions, and because of their
old and late grudgings and jarrings, easily emoulous of one another's court)
will endeavor, to recommend himself unto us, as most worthy of our favor, by
striving, who shall bring over most of his party, professedly to accept of our
pardon, when we are at leisure to give it; so, they will be careful to commend,
and make themselves considerable by their intelligence; for which end, we not
only allow them to entertain their old familiarity, and known intimacy with
their party; but we maintain and keep them in case, to have each his
instruments, by whom, he may be fully informed, of whatever passes amongst his
old associats: And the jealousy, that each of these two principal agents, has,
that either his court and credit with us, will fall lower, then the other's, if
he mantain it not with an equality of service; or that the other might, in
order to the making of himself most considerable, reveal some things, not only
of his own party, that depends more directly upon him; but of what were a
doing or designing also, in the party, and amongst the intimats of the other,
will make both very open hearted, in discovering the utmost of what they know:
As this, I say, will be the procedour of these persons; so the certain
knowledge hereof, will create such distrust and diffidence amongst the more
prudent of the fanatics, as will cut of all communication of counsels upon
this head; since they will be jealous, that there may be, in the most select
number, some, whose service in discovering what ever passes, is ensured to
either, or both of the two, whom we would never daigne to see, if it were
not, that with their eyes we might see into the bosoms of their fraternity.

As for the Ancient nobility and Gentry of the nation, most of them being old
or worn out, who would have counted it more honorable to have died in the
quarrel, then to have survived the liberty of their country, which must be now
swallowed up in our absolut soveraignity, and the few who remain, seeing the
disease desperate, are more like, in their despondency, to choose, to sigh out
the rest of their miserable days, in such a lot, as our absoluteness will
carve out for them; then expose selves to certain ruin by appearing to oppose,
when there is neither hope nor humane probability of putting a stop to this new
setlement: And for the young Nobility and Gentry, can grapes be gathered off
thistles? We have not only secured our selves from their opposition, but
ensured their assistance: For care has been taken, to train them up, and
habituat them, beyond a retreat, to all manner of lewdness and licentiousness
of life; so that morality, is the matter of their scorn, hatred and
detestation, as high and unheard of flagitious practices, are the matter of
their boasting: Now can it be expected, that such who count it a glory to be
delivered from the bonds (or as they judge it the bondage) of morality, will
strugle for the liberty of their nation, and contend for the preservation of
Religion, especialy knowing, that if the nation were again, what it once was,
they would either be constrained, to relinquish these wicked courses, to which
they have devoted themselves; or be looked upon, and carried toward, as the
filth and offscouring; of the generation, only fit for the dunghill? No, we
are sure of these beyond hesitation: As our play houses have been Accademies
for Satan, wherein this young generation of Gallants, have commenced his
Disciples, and mancipat their souls to his yoke, blessing themselves in this
subjection, as true liberty; so, they have laid aside and lost by the same
means, all sense of true honor, virtue, and love for the prosperity and real
privileges of their country.

Now giving and granting, there are a considerable number of persons, neither
tainted with vice, nor wholly laid aside by the former considerations, whom we
can never gain to a compliance with our design: yet, we are sure they will
not move nor dare to appear, to prevent or oppose us, in the prosecution of
our purpose: seeing they know, that upon the least surmise or whispering of this
nature, we would pretend a present necessity to go to Arms, and they are not
ignorant, how by our providence and foresight, for securing the success of
this undertaking, we have put our selves in a capacity, to sacrifice to the
design of our absoluteness, the lives of all who will run the risck of
opposing it. And this leads me to speak a little to the care that has been
had, and the courses which have been taken, to secure the end, before an open
entry was made in the way leading to it: First, all places of trust and power,
are put in the hands of such persons, as will by choice and obligation be true
to our interest; knowing, that we cannot succumb in the enterprise, but they
must sink and be crushed with us: Secondly, we are not only sure of the
assistance of all our loyal and faithful subjects, our bosom confidents, the
Roman Catholics, but as they are beyond belief numerous, by the courses we
have taken to encourage them; so they are provided, and in such readiness to
rise, that with difficulty they are kept back; and the assurance they have of
our being true to our designation, viz defender of their faith, and to our
Ghostly father's interest, who signalised his son's fidelity, with this title,
makes them as entirely ours, as they know us to be theirs: Thirdly, our new
magazine at Windsore Castle, our faithful and loyal subject that Irish Papist,
whom we have made real governor of the Tower (for Sr. John Robinson, is an
insignificant nominal; but the less significant, the better, when joined with
a second, designed for sole significancy) our new fort at Gravesend (built upon
another pretense) will all serve to keep the city, (if it be thought fit to
save it from being burnt the second time) the head of all the insurrection, or
trouble we fear, either quiet, or we will be in case to liberat our selves
of our fears, by cutting it off; and to guard effectually, against a may be of
a miscarriage in this enterprise, we have made sure the power of France,
whereby we will be easily able, to overpower, what might prove too difficult
for us, to overcome by our selves: The great predominant consideration, which
has contrair the persuasion of all the old interest of England, determined us
to a conjunction with them, in this war against the Dutch; whose landing we
have secured in our chief Cinque ports; and now the mystery of Plymouth
fortification is unridled: Their setting foot on English ground is made easy?
not only, because they have our English Fleet to convey them, and one of the
chief strengths of England to receive them; but under color of guarding the
coasts against our Dutch enemies; we have raised so many forces, as will serve
to welcome our French friends, and they together, will give an opportunity for
the rest, who are impatient of a delay, to draw to a head; so that, what with
the number of Atheists and Papists we have already within our selves, and
what by their daily increase (for we expect a flowing in upon England, as a
Torrent, the scum of the Popish vermin, out of all nations abroad, in answer
to our invitation of strangers, especialy, seeing, what we have hinted of
liberty and protection to the Popish Religion, in that our declaration, will
be very well understood by our sagacious friends abroad, as it is at home
known to be a plain declaration of our purpose, to setle Popery, as the
public profession of the nation; from which, nothing has hitherto vvithheld
us, but want of power) we are sure (I say) with these not only to make our
selves formidable, to all who would oppose us; but also to be able, to cover
almost in one day, the very face of the nation, and cut in pieces at once, all
whom we suspect, to be guilty of an inclination contrair to our royal pleasure;
and we are sure, the execution of our commands, shall be in the hand of such,
who with a tygerish keenesse, will execute our will: What then can appear
able to stand in the way, or put us to a difficulty, in effectuating our
purpose?

I know the more prudent in the nation, will readily apprehend, when they
consider, what a vast treasure the Court has devoured, and how they have so
habituat themselves to this prodigious profuseness, as they may as soon cease
to be, as cease to change their way; And when withal they perceive, how,
while they are such, that all vvayes of satiating this boundless appetit are
impossible (for Parliaments can do noe more; yea this very Parliament, if
called together for that purpose, how probable is it that in stead of a new
stretch to give more, not only the disgraceful receiving of the French
millions but the Court's meddling with the treasure of the nation, and
destroying it is trade and credit, by that stop, without a precedent, put upon
the Exchecquer, would be resented by them) that the Court is engaged and
resolved to lay them aside, and usurp for the future, a pure absoluteness:
They have created to themselves this necessity: For it is not imaginable that a
way now can be found out, besides this desperate expedient, how both his
Majesty's debts shall be paid, and the Court maintained, as it has been these
years past; (though with much less luster, then the illustrious Courts of
England, famous formerly through the World, for their magnificent plenty,
sumptuous entertainment, and numerous retinue; when the revenue of the crown
was scarce the half of what it now is: Neither were these Kings treasures
empty; so that the vastness of our present yearly revenue, beyond what former
Kings had, with the incredible sums, which have, partly been given, partly
exacted and squised from the People, the penury of the Court, while it is bill
of fare is abridged almost to a baseness, make men stand aghast and inquire at
the ways, how this treasure is spent? Whether it be hoorded up, as some
suspect, or by the vvhirle-vvinde of an invisible curse svveeped away which
many believe) if any remain still obstinatly incredulous, notvvithstanding of
what is said to discover this to be the design, and how, what we are now
doing, is, in order to the bringing of our purpose to pass, all the evil I
wish him, is, that the Court to whom he has so much charity, do not cure him
of this distemper, by destroying his own, together with the nations interest.

There is one thing which makes all that is said, for convincing incredulity
it self of this Court design, not only pass for a groundless conjecture,
but for the malicious product of some fantastic, and a bold forgery of a
petulant male content viz. That suppose his Maj. if he knew how handsomely to
accomplish it, were passionatly desirous to lay aside Parliaments; yet
considering what assistance he behoved to have, in dissolving that happy frame
of government, under which the nation has floorished so long, to the envy and
terror of all it is enemies; yet his Maj. cannot but foresee, how that by making
use of such a mean, in stead of attaining the proposed absoluteness, the crown
does really fall from his head, and he precipitats himself into the ditch of a
most base and abominable servitude: For since the instruments chiefly to be
made use of, for carrying on this desperate design, must be the Roman
Catholics at home and abroad; their fidelity and assistance cannot be assured
at a lower rate, or upon any other terms, then by settling the Romish Idolatry
as the public profession of the nation; and if so, then his Maj. in stead of
an absolut Sovereign, becomes Rom's Tributary, holding his crown precariously
of the Pope: Nor can his Maj. be ignorant how he is not to expect, to be in the
same condition of servitude with other Popish Princes; England being more
purely the Popes Patrimony then other Kingdoms, Peter's pence must be paid in
recognisance of his superiority, whereby King and Kingdom is debased to hell:
This one obvious consideration I say, has made wise men (though never the
wiser for that) judge it impossible, that ever the design of absoluteness,
could transport his Maj. into such a mistake, as to accomplish his end by this
midds, there being so close and clear a connection betwixt turning the nation
into a province, the Prince into the Pop's deputy or substitut, and settling of
Popery as the profession of the nation: It Is true all persons of understanding
in the nation, did with surprise and amasement behold how Papists were
encouraged and countenanced, how their profession seemed to qualify them for
places of trust, and commend them to our favor; nay good men behold with grief
and horror, how the favors heaped upon the Irish Rebels did amount to the
height, of more then an interpretative owning, of that horrid massacre in
Ireland, whereby the guilt of so much innocent blood is brought upon the
throne, and his May. exposed also by this, to share, in all the wrath and
vengance, which shall fall upon the head of of the shedders of that blood, as a
return to the cry of the souls under the Alter, from him who not only makes
inquisition for blood, but in whose eyes the death of his Saints, is so
precious, that he engages to give them blood to drink, who have shed their's;
yea it has added astonishment to their horror, to see popery so publicly
professed in Ireland, that the Popes Primat is as public there, as his
Majesty's; nor are their scooles less patent, or their meetings for their
idolatrous worship less public; but whither, what has been lately done in
England, does lessen or highten the amasement, is a question: Every one thought
he had so much reason to disbeleeve a design of settling Popery, that the
nation was abused into a supine negligence and deep security, even while they
looked on and saw it excresce, to the contemning of law, and overtoping of all
other intersts; insomuch that men for fear (forsooth) of losing the repute of
wise and prudent, fooled themselves for company, either into a sameness of
apprehension, with such masters of reason, as judged this enterprise, on the
Court's part, the height of folly, and the jealousy of it in others, a
shallowness of apprehension at best; or dissimulation of their fears, which
has been plagued with a vvretched reguardlessenesse, how it went with the
interest of Christ; and if now and then they were pulled by the ear, and bid
look about them, ere it was too late, by such as compared the courses taken,
to propagat that abomination, and promove the Popish interest at home, with
his Majesty's carriage when abroad, how he remained inexorable
notvvithstanding of all entreaties, nor could he, by the most ardent and
earnest beseechings of the protestants, be overcome to a compliance with their
desires, of being present at their worship, frequenting in the mean time the
mass, in Paris, Brussels, Cullen, etc. Which with other things, was the ground
of that assurance we had from abroad, that his Maj. had renounced the
protestant Religion, the Papist's boasting everywhere very openly that his Maj.
was turned Catholic, and making use of it as an argument to prevail with
others, whom they endeavored to seduce into the same abomination: The
Protestants were grieved and sad at the certain persvvasion and foresight of
what would follow, (though we were fooled into a fearelessenesse) to the
prejudice of the reformed Religion, upon his Majesty's restitution; yet they
would reason themselves into an obstinatnesse in their first opinion, and
though they neither did, nor could deny his Majesty's carriage abroad, to have
been such, nor yet shut their eyes upon what they saw acted at home; they would
still, granting all their monitors premises, which, being matters of fact,
were manifest by their own evidence and light beyond a denial, reject their
inference, and upbraid for the brutishness of such a fear, seeing such a
setlement of popery, was inconsistent with policy, and utterly destructive of
his Majesty's interest; supposing that whatever favors he heaped upon these
unhappy men, would not excresce to the prejudice of that, but be confined
within the limits, which his own honor, (to say nothing of what the Oath of
God required of him) and the liberty of the nation, should have set to his
liberality, yea for confirming themselves in this their tenaciousnesse, they
would both give and grant (but without ground; for he who will be false to the
true and living God, will readily be true to a false; because this is
inflicted as a part of their punishment, yea a dreadful part and plague it is
upon such as make Apostasy, that they should be mad upon Idols) that his Maj.
in his exile and distress; might not only, in order to the engaging of the
Popish party, to endeavor his restitution, and secure a maintenance to him
while abroad, frequent their mass, and openly decline the protestant assemblies
and worship, but had besides, given the Pope all possible assurances, of
enslaving the nation to Idolatry, upon his restitution, and in the highest and
most ample formality, had renounced the Protestant Religion (being indulged for
the interim, upon a politic design, and in order to the more safe and certain
performance of his promise, to retain in his family the English service book;
whereof one said well, that it was an ill said mass) giving, I say, and
granting all this, yet the evidence his Maj has given, that with him it is a
light matter to break covenants, Oaths and most solemn engagements, whereby
his own soul, together with the souls of the whole nation, were most
explicitly and formaly bound to the most High, as alteri parti contrahenti,
under the pain of his dreadful displeasure, when the adherence unto, or the
performance of these vows, seemed to interfere with his other designs, or
were apprehended (o sad mistak, where the error exposes to the ire of him,
who cuteth of the Spirit of Princes, and is terrible to the Kings of the earth)
to be inconsistent, with his other interests; this I say, gave them ground to
over-perswade themselves; and because they would have had it so, flatter
themselves into the belief; that such promises would not be looked upon as
obligatory, when they were discovered to be so manifestly destructive, not
only of all the dear and precious concerns of his subjects, but, to
conviction, a total eclipse of Royal Majesty; being really the debasing of his
person, and prostitution of his imperial crown, to be trampled upon, and trod
under foot by that Romish Beast.

But if I can do no more, for awaking such to weep over, what their security,
and the dreamings of the nation, make now almost humanitus impossible to
prevent; (only with God all things are possible) I would desire them, in the
first place, to consider, that for Kings to be blindfolded and hurried headlong
into this slavery, is nothing else, but what we have expressly foretold by the
H. Ghost; and is it any thing else in him, to follow the drove of those, who,
in like manner, have over the belly of the same persuasions to the contrair,
shut up themselves in this house of bondage, and subjected their consent to the
dominion of this beast, this Mistress of witchcrafts, who entiseth the Kings
of the earth, to commit fornication with her, and having made them drunk with
the cup of her abominations, which she propineth them, they submit their neck,
to take on her yoke, and give their power, to maintain her Grandeur, in
opposition to Jesus Christ, whose servants are slain by their svvord, to
gratify and satiat the cruelty of this scarlet colored whore drunk with the
blood of the Saints and Martyrs? Yea the Kings of the earth, are so bewitched
into a complacency with her fetters, and intoxicat with her cup, to that
height of madness, that they will vveep and cry, Alas, Alas, at the sight of
her smoke and burning (soon may he and the rest of the Kings of the earth see
it, and vomit out at their eyes, the satisfaction they have taken, in sheding
the blood of the Saints; if nothing else will be a curb to their rage, against
the Lord and his servants, and cure them of this madness, he is the Lord who
will hasten it in it is time, and make her and them find, that the Lord who
judges both, and avengeth the blood of his servants, is strong, when he takes
vengance, and meets them not like a man) But secondly, I judge, as to us, it
would be more prudence and Religion too, to be less confident in our
politics, not only because of the express prediction of this infatuation;
but when we consider, what ground there is of fear, that his Majesty, in the
righteous judgment of God, be abandoned to the advance and setlement of this
abomination, contrair to his own and the nation's interest; these revoults
from, these insurrections and rebellions against, the most High, these
deliberat and shameful breaches of solemn Covenants, and sacred vows,
whereof he has made himself and his dominion guilty, may rather make us
wonder, if the Lord do not leave him to follovv these courses, then to see him
given up unto them: Is it not a righteous thing with God, since he has broken
his Covenant with the most High, wherein as he was bound to nothing, but to
walk with God in his Kingly capacity, and rule for him; so in the same
Covenant, his subjects in a just subordination to the Lord and his Christ, were
solemnly engaged to obey him, to be religiously tender of his honor and
interests, and himself, together with the world, knows, that it is to this
Oath of God, whereby his subjects found themselves obliged in Conscience, to
endeavor his restoration, that he owes his crown and peaceable restitution:
I say, is it not a righteous thing with God, since he has broken such a
Covenant, whereof he has reaped so much advantage, to leave him to such
courses, and the making of such confederacies, as shall make the world see,
fear and tremble, at the revelation of his judgments, because of a broken
Covenant. It were as superfluous for me, to offer the nation an account, of the
manner and methods followed, in breaking this Covenant, as it might seem to
savor of a malicious design, if matter of fact were represented, with some of
those most obvious aggravations, which made the sinfulness of it reach heaven,
and is like to cause God remember this iniquity: But sure each soul, who has
not sinned away all conscience, of the sacred obligatorinesse of Oaths and
covenants, especially these, made, not only before the most High as a judge,
but with him, as with the party contracting, cannot remember, with what
solemnity, this covenant was entered into, and with what insolence, rage and
spite, it has been thrown in the fire, and trampled upon, and made
treasonable for any to assert it is obligation; and how, to this day,
whosoever dare not for fear of the Almighty, do the same abominable thing,
which his soul hates, makes himself an offender, and exposes his person to
the lash of the mischiefs, framed into a law, against the asserters of this
obligation; (o daring insolence against God, and base ingratitude against men,
thus to destroy the men, who were the sole instruments of restoring his
Majesty!) But, as he must perceive, the contrivers and framers of these laws,
abandoned of God, to walk in the vvayes and imaginations of their own evil
heart, so he needs not wonder, if persons so judicialy left, to courses,
destructive of their eternal welbeing, and the only valuable interest of their
soul, be also in the righteous judgment of the Lord, left to such courses, as
are truly destructive of their temporal interests; the not receiving of the
love of the truth, especialy the opposing and persecuting it, may not only be
punished, with a being given up of God to strong delusions, to believe a lie,
that they may be damned; but also to a being given up to strong delusions, to
believe a lie about all their worldly interests and concerns: O that it might
be given unto his Maj. as his mercy, which were a favor, every way preferable
to the Empire of the Universe, and as the mercy of this poor nation, to
remember his own evil vvayes, and to turn to the living God, that so he might
turn away from the fierceness of his anger, and then establish his throne,
upon the solid base of Religion and righteousness.

Thirdly, let such over-wise politicians, awake out of this dream, to
consider, not only, the facility of this establishment, but how it is so
really and upon the matter already settled, while we sleep; that the
prevention, of a formal establishment, seems only in his Power, who laughs
the wicked out of their project's, and brings the counsel of the heathen to
naught; to say nothing of the unmasked confidence, and plain peremptorinesse,
wherewith the Popish party amongst our selves, have, of a long time, boasted in
terminis, how their plot was so laid, that it could not misgive; nor of their
insultings abroad, upon the same grounds of assurance: Let it be considered,
first, to what number, strength and Power, the Popish party amongst us, is
arrived, partly by the secret encouragement, partly by the open countenance
they have had, since his Majesty's return: As for their Power and prevalency at
Court, the current of affairs is demonstrative, that they are the only cabal,
who spirit and animat all our motions; for it had been impossible else, ever to
have engaged and involved us, in this war against the Dutch, in whose designed
overthrow, the destruction of the Protestant interest is intended: And as to
there number, besides the swarms of those locusts which cover the face of our
Court and city, and overspread the whole land, and that inundation, which, like
a torrent, flows in upon us from foreign parts, as if Rome had opened it is
Sluice, to drown us with that deludge, or rather the dragon had cast these
waters out of his mouth, to cause the woman thereby to be carried away, and
svvallovved up, which lately had brought forth, the man child of such a
reformation: Is it not found by experience ( for regis ad exemplum totus
componitur orbis) that, not a fevv persons, of quality, are gone over and
seduced into the Romish persuasion, of whom, no such thing was feared or
apprehended; insomuch that he who is not tainted himself with this wicked
contagion, begins to doubt, what person of quality, may be concluded, to be
realy fixed in an opposition to this wickedness; there seems to be nothing,
but a fit opportunity, vvanting, to make an incredible discovery of persons,
who yet think it convenient, to go under the name and disguise of
Protestants: And as men who know the Romish principles, and how ordinary it
is for them, to tranforme themselves into every shape, that, while appearing
like Angels of light, they may with less observation, and more certainty,
carry on their work, and establish their Kingdom of darkness, may very
rationaly judge that they are numerously lurking, under the garb even of the
manifold and various persuasions, which seem, in their principles and
practices, most remote from, and opposite to Popery; (I need not mention, how
they swarm amongst, and are served by our Episcopal Clergy) so it is very
well known, in what numbers, they have hid themselves, and hatched their
wickedness, under the dottage and disguise of Quakerisme; insomuch, that
sober and discerning men, from the consideration of these men's priciples, their
desperate enmity, especialy at the Stanch Protestants, and more eminently godly
Non-conformists, together with the good understanding, which is between the
leading persons of that party, and the Court, do rationaly infer, if ever
there be an opportunity for these men, to discover what they are at bottom,
the bulck of them, will be found, with the utmost of irrational and brutish
fury, to adjoine themselves to the Popish party, or rather discover, how being
already their's in heart, they only judged it most convenient to dissemble,
and lurk under this shape, till with most advantage to Popish Idolatry, and
danger to the Protestant interest, they might appear, in the true shape of the
locusts, who are like horses prepared unto the battle, Rev. 9, 7, 8, 9, 10.
having for their King and Captain Abaddon or Apollyon 8. 11.

But then as their number, may give the facility to this setlement, an obvious
probability; so it is more assured from their posture, and present readiness
for action, and warlick capacity for putting all the mischief that is in their
heart, in execution, and with a rage peculiar to the dragon's followers, running
down whatever would offer to stand in their way, or oppose this setlement. I
need not here repeat that which is already hinted, what of our visible military
strength, is in their hand, and how our forts, forces, armouries, Magazines,
with all manner of warlick-provisions, seem to be destined and devouted to that
service: But have not wise men, with fear and amazement, observed, how, that
since his Majesty's return, the Popish nobility, gentry, yea to the most
ordinary of the common people of that persvvasion, from the one end of the
nation, to the other, have, being prompted and put on by these restless
ringleaders, the Priests and Jesuits, been preparing their slaughter weapons;
so that he who considers their present capacity and posture, cannot escape
this conviction; that there was never in England, so numerous, and so well
appointed an army, lying ready at a call, as there is, at this day, of Papists,
whose blind rage against God and his truth, will prompt them to the height of
cruelty, against all ranks, sexes and ages; hence are these daily boastings at
home, of apprehended impossibility of the misgiving of this setlement, and
these insultings abroad, at it is certainty, the Papists not standing to say,
that now, they see no rub in their way, if the United provinces were once
ruined.

Secondly, the difficulty of accomplishing this their wicked design, will
evanish, if these two be further considered; first, how the persons of quality
in the nation, are utterly debauched, (for, Alas, they who are chief, are chief
in all abominations and unexampled impieties) especialy the young Nobility, and
Gentry; secondly, what a constant and known transition there is, from Atheism
and all Profanity, to Popery, the mother and nurse of all abominations in
practice: He, I say, who considers these things, will be so far from
expecting an effectual opposition, to the setlement of Popery, from a
generation, who seem rather, to have been brought forth and educat in the
Stews of Rome, then borne within the Pale of the visible reformed Church,
that he will conclude, a liberty to live as in the suburbs of hell, will make
them without difficulty, profess themselves the Childreen of that mother,
whom they do so perfectly resemble: Will these, who can glory in being
beasts, and boast themselves of their prodigious wickedness, these, who in the
whole of their way, carry, as if they had nothing in them, above the swine,
having buried in that dunghill and pudle of sensitive delights, wherein they
wallow, the consideration of their immortal souls, contend for the faith once
delivered unto the Saints, or resist unto blood, striving against this
wickedness, even when under the countenance and encouragement of Authority?

If any will persist, in his obstinat incredulity, when his Majesty's
indulgence is (after all the other favors he has heaped upon them) extended,
to the seting up of their idolatrous worship, throughout his dominions, that
the introducing of Popery is not designed, and that there is nothing, in this
our conjunction with the French King, against the Protestant Stats,
declarative of this purpose, or continue impersvvadible of a possibility to
compass it, he is like to be knokt in the head, for a cure of this distemper,
and may be certainly concluded, by putting far away the thoughts of such a day,
to be given up, that he may be swept away, in this dream, to a spirit of deep
sleep and delusion: If we be men, and have not so mancipat our reason, that no
reasoning will be prevalent to bring us to our right mind, we cannot deny a
conclusion, inferred upon such premises: But withal; if we be Christians, and
add to all the above adduced evidences, that both this is upon the heart of
adversaries, and a competency also, yea overplus of power in their hand, to
effectuat it, the consideration of our sin, and wrath presaging security; we
may with trembling, entertain ourselves, with these thoughts and fears, that
God, in his righteous judgment, because of our abuse of his glorious Gospel,
and impenitence, under most clear and crying calls to repent, and receive
instruction, lest his soul be seperat from us, be about the taking away of his
Kingdom from us, and giving it to a nation, which will bring forth the fruits
thereof, and render them to him in their season; and because we have not loved
to walk in the truth, he deprive us of that truth, and in taking away his
candlestick, write our sin, and his displeasure upon our Punishment: And here,
I cannot forbear to tell, how with fear and anxiety, I have heard some of our
good Ministers, tush at the expressions of their brethrens fear of a design
to setle Popery, as if the thing were a pure impossibility; but I judge, they
did so, rather because they would have it so, and partly from a piece of
inadvertency; then from the due and serious weighing, both of what we have done
to deserve it, and what the adversaries, are designeing and doing; for, if
these were represented to us, as nothing should be found, in the dispenfations
of God, so nothing in the disposition of his own People, or of his and their
adversaries, which would not presage sad things, yea minister matter of
terror, at the thoughts of this very thing.

But without insisting, by a superfluous deduction or enumeration of
particulars, further to demonstrat these things which are past all
peradventure, with them, who will be at the pains to reflect on what is
past, and set, or suffer themselves to understand, the genuin sense and true
import, of what they now hear and see acted, I shall (as the thing aimed at
in the whole of this discouse) shut up all in a word or two, with a more direct
reference to what I humbly judge, to be the duty of all the persons in the
nation, who desire to be approved of God in such a day of trial, temptation,
rebuke and blasphemy: And first, do not these things, my brethren, say, that
now it is high time to awake out of sleep: Let therefore the consideration of
what we see acted and aimed at, at home, and the joint tendency of the tumults
and combinations abroad, drive us out of our dreaming security, to consider in
great seriousness, what danger the work of God amongst our selves, and
throughout the world, is in; shall we sleep as do others, while his precious
interests and People are in such hasard? shall the Lords voice be crying to the
city, to the country, to the nation, to all the Churches of Christ in the
earth, and shall not we be so wise, to see his name, and understand the
language of this his terrible rod, held over our head, and the design of him
who appoints it? It Is high time to awake, when we are liketo sleep the sleep
of death, if we sleep long.

Secondly, it is not every inquiry into the emergents of the present day, or
observation of the sad posture of affairs, that will prove us to be men of
understanding who know the time; If we could dive into the depth of all our
enemies secreets, and make a perfect discovery of all their desperate designs;
yet unless we consider the things, which are like to overwhelme us in their
procuring cause, unless we set our selves to search out the accursed thing
that is with us, and what are the national, yea personal provocations of his
sons and his daughters, for which he is like to give up the dearly beloved of
his soul, into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of such as hate them
with cruel hatred, all is lost labor.

It would draw me to a length beyond my design, to reckon up in order our
provocations, or represent them with their high and heinous aggravations, time
would fail for such an undertaking; who is sufficient for this thing? we may,
with great certainty, say, upon a very overly search, that our wickedness is
great, and our trasgressions infinite; it is well for us, they want this of
simple infiniteness, that they can be swallovved up of infinite mercy: But there
seems to be some special provocation, comprehensive of all the rest, pointed
at by these manifold and multiplied dreadful calamities, under which this poor
nation has been crushed, and by all these more formidable things, whereby,
utter destruction of our persons, posterity, and of all our interests, both
sacred and civil, is further threatened; this is the thing, for which he is
mainly contending, and this is that dangerous enemy, that domestic enemy the
destroyer of the Church and Nation, after which our inquiry should be: and
having discovered this enemy, if we would have Peace with God, even that Peace
which passes understanding, peace in life and death, Peace in our borders, and
on the Israel of God, we are not to let him, when found, go in Peace; a revenge
here, with the height of hatred and indignation, is not only lavvful, but in
order to the preservation of soul and body, Church and Kingdom, Religion and
liberty, simply necessar, and indispensibly duty; If we do not search this
out, he will seek out our wickedness till he find none, and then vvoe unto
us; or having found it, if we make light of the matter, then we engage him to
let us know, that it is a bitter and an evil thing that we have forsaken the
Lord our God, and that his fear has not been before us; if we would have his
eye spare, our's must not: But what may this Provocation be? I must profess my
selfhelped in this inquiry, by calling to mind, what an eminently faithful
Minister of Jesus Christ said, preaching at a fast upon our anniversary day,
kept for the burning of London; after he had insisted upon many sins, which
might be pointed at by such a remarkable stroke; but, said he, the strangeness
and stupendiousnesse of this judgment, seems to point at some one sin, which
is by the head and shoulders taler then all the rest, ajudgement, the like
whereof was never in the nation, seems, to point at a provocation, never
before in all it is circumstances, nationally committed; what can this be?
Truly, said he, we need go no further to find it out, here it is; God burnt,
or permitted in his anger this City to be burnt, because in it, by an order of
King and Parliament, ( horresco referens, be astonished O heavens at this) that
solemn Covenant, entered into with the most high God, about things which had
the most clear connection with his glory, and direct tendency to the
advancement of the Kingdom of his Son, in the nation, and in the souls of men,
wherein also the temporal, as well as the eternal welfare, of each and all the
persons contracting with the Lord God, (as his Maj. who owes his crown and
establishment to it, may say) was provided for, and secured; even this
Covenant was burnt in our city, by the hand of the common Hangman; this, said
he, is a punishment in it is greatness and strangeness, some way proportioned
to the sin pointed at, whereby it was procured: He spoke like a Seer, and one
who had the mind of Christ, that said it: O that all ministers of the nation,
spoke the same things, at least on those days, appointed for weeping between
the porch and the alter; and that all the professing people of the nation, who
have come under the bond of this Covenant, might, in order to a right mourning
before the Lord, be like minded! However, in this discovery I subsist: It was
fit; it was an act of holy righteousness in the judge of all the World, that
the nations abroad, who had heard of the burning of this Covenant, and had
observed, how, in this, our rage against God, his work, way and People, had
reached unto heaven; by which act also, he being the great and glorious party
contracted with, we gave him, with all imaginable fury and formality, the
defiance, should also hear, how, this glorious Lord God, thus dispightfully
and dareingly provoked, had burnt that City, and sent as it were fire down
from heaven upon it, to consume the place, where such a prodigious
wickedness had been committed. Truly, my brethren, it concerns all of us,
in this day of his contendings with us, and in this year of controversies, to
call to mind a broken Covenant, and a burnt Covenant, whereby, we, our King,
our Parliament, and the whole nation, stood unalterably engaged, to make our
selves happy in holiness, in worshipping the living God, according to his own
will, and in walking before him, in our particular stations and relations,
like the vvorshipers of the true God: whose main design in the World should
be, the adorning of his Doctrine, and showing forth his virtues in all things:
This Covenant, I say, which bound us to our own blessedness, in binding us to
the good behavior toward him, was broken, and these cords were cast away from
us, this pale, whereby we were only hedged up, from falling into everlasting
burnings, was plucked up: Now Britain, now England lay it to thy heart, for
this, the hand of the great God has smitten, for this thing, it is still
stretched out: Will we not take warning? will we harden our selves against him,
and prosper? May not the things, which have overtaken us already, make us know,
that it is a fearful thing, to fall into the hands of the living God? Oh,
inconsideration has hardened us into impenitency, and ripened us for
judgment! Will nothing awake us, till the terrors of God take hold on us as
vvatter, and a sudden tempest of indignation, steal us away in the night? It
will be too late then, to think of fleeing out of his hand, when he has
begun, to cast upon us, and not spare, when he has whet his glittering
svvord, and his hand has taken hold of vengeance: Dreadful may the expectation
of our hearts be, in the consideration of the things, which, for this
wickedness, are coming, if repentance prevent it not; our not having mourned
for this abomination, our siting to this day, with whole hearts, beside the
matter of so much sorrovv, may make us meditat terror least he tear in pieces
and there be none to deliver.

Let us consider, what judgments and plagues follovved upon the avouched and
enacted breach of this Covenant, that we may know, how he has contended, and
will contend for this, if we return not: In the first place, there is no man,
who is not under the plague of spiritual occecation; nay, no man who retains
so much of morality, as will distinguish him from a beast, but if he will
consider the practice and conversation of the men, who framed this mischief
into a law, yea and of all who rejoiced in that day, and said, Aha, so would
we have it, this is the day we looked for, we have found, we have seen it;
but it must extort this testimony from him, in despite of all palliatings, and
covering with those coverings, which are not of his spirit; that since that
day and time, never was there a race of men, never was there a generation,
more remarkeably given up of God, to walk in the ways of their own heart,
and that is hellward; as there were never men, who have more manifestly
declared their sin as Sodom, or have been less solicitous to hide it; so there
was never a Nation, never Princes, never People, who might have been more
justly expostulat with, in the same terms, that his People of old were upbraded
for their wickedness, Is. 1. 10. Hear the word of the Lord ye Rulers of Sodom,
give ear unto the law of our God ye People of Gomorrah: As never People did
cast off, so blessed and honorable a yoke, with so much malice and dispight;
so never was there Nation or generation, who did more advisedly and deliberatly
take on Satan's yoke, seting themselves to work wickedness in the sight of the
Lord; insomuch, that we are become a byword, a hissing, and an abhorrence, as
the very border of wickedness, for our prodigious, and unheard of impieties,
to the Nations about us: Oh, whither, since the day of our breach of faith with
God, have we caused our shame to go? We have spoken and done evil as we could,
and as if we had raked hell, to find out new methods of sinning, we have
surpast the deeds of the heathen; and as we had been only delivered, to do
all these abominations; so with a displayed banner, have we fought against
God, glorying in wallowing in the very kennel of hell, boasting of vvearing
Satan's black colors, and thinking it only manhood and gallantry, to fight
under his banner: Let the records of former times be searched into, and let the
practice of this generation, be compared with the greatest, and most universal
wickedness, which at other times had overspread the Nation, and I am
confident impartiality must say, that since the day of our solemn revoult from
our svvorn subjection to the most High, Satan has been let loose more
manifestly, to open as it were the very sluice of hell to the drowning of the
Land, with a deluge of profanity, even after that the knowledge of the glory
of the Lord, especialy upon our entering in that blessed Covenant with him,
had covered the land, in a good measure, as the vvatters cover the sea: From
that day forevvard, Alas, did the Lord pour out his plagues, upon the hearts
of the men of that conspiracy; so that he who did run, might have read this
engraven upon their practice, that as they did not like to retain God in their
knowledge; so God had given them over to a reprobat mind, to do those things,
which are not convenient, being filled with all unrighteousness,
fornication, etc. After they had broken Covenant with him, they added, this
iniquity of burning it, to that sin, proceeding from evil to worse, which had
more of displeasure in it, then if they had, upon passing this law, been
stricken dead with a thunder bolt from heaven; for this was to be left, to act
so, and do that wickedness, which being considered in it is complexe, and
with all it is circumstances, had never been done under the whole heaven before,
let be in the Nation; (I grant the the like was acted in our neighbor Nation
of Scotland, where the causes of wrath were burnt, containing an
acknowledgment, of sin for the breach of this Covenant; but as this was an act
of the same abused power; so it was of a piece, with this monstrous impiety)
so that I may very rationaly doubt, if ever there was, a more solemn and
acceptable Sacrifice offered unto Satan, upon the earth, then to have the
Nations Engagement with God, so opprobriously cast into a fire: I know, all the
ten Plagues of Egypt, to a gracious heart, who looks upon sin as the worst of
evils, if they had together fallen on the Nation would not be remembered in one
day, with this clear and undeniable evidence of the displeasure of the Lord;
that the Nation should be left to commit such a wickedness; Satan who had fled
seven ways before the fire of that zeal, which was found amongst the people of
the Lord, in the day when they entered into this Covenant with him, and took
on them these vows, knew well, that now a throne would be erected to him, and
that he should without control, exerce a soveraignity in the Nation, and we
have seen it so: How, Alas, has he since that day, exerced as a Prince a
dominion? and how has that spirit, wrought in the childreen of disobedience?

But secondly, because the generality did not observe, this dreadful evidence
of his displeasure; and were not sensibly affected with the wrath, that was
witnessed against men, by leaving them to post in the vvayes of perdition, and
run according to the drivings of Satan; he took other vvayes, to make the most
stupid of the nation sensible of his anger from that day; to say nothing
(which yet speaks the thing so distinctly, that idiots may understand it) of
disapointment of our hopes, and blasting of our big expectations; for we
dreamed of nothing, but, upon his Majesty's return, that we should be the
head, and all other nations the tail, that we should then floorish in trade,
and increase in treasure and strength, to the suppressing and overawing of all,
who would offer to compet with us; now in stead of this expectation, wherein we
blessed ourselves, and whereof we boasted, as if already arrived at our hoped
for harbor, our substance is consumed, there is a moth in our Estat, he
blows upon what we had, and blows it away, we lose our flesh and fatness,
our mirth is turned into mourning, and our organ into the voice of them that
weep, the whole nation filled with murmuring and complaints of penury, and,
which is a prodigy, the very Court that eat up all, cries out, my leanness my
leanness: To pass these things, I say, without insisting upon them; let us,
by a few crying evidences, remember, how God remembered this iniquity, and
visited us for this sin, with judgment: And because, England had never
nationaly so dared him to his face, as in his own sight, in the sight of Angels
and men, to burn that obligation by a decree; wherein, the nation had obliged
themselves to be his, to be no more their own, to be no more at the dispose of
others, but in a due subordination to him as supreme; he gives order, to a
destroying Angel, to fall upon that City, where this wickedness was decreed
and perpetrat, and then the chief Actors must flee for it, and seek another
seat and city; I need say no more of this, but as never Prince, never
Parliament, neither the Nation or City, had been guilty of such outrage, and
Rebellion against the Lord, so never did plague rage in the same manner, nor
did the destroying Angel get a command to put up his sword, till such heaps,
were laid upon heaps, and so many thousands upon thousands; that all who heard
thereof, behoved to observe, and say, never was there such a plague in England;
and, if resolved into it is true cause, we must say, righteous art thou O Lord
God injudging thus, we are worthy, for never was there such a provocation in
England.

One vvoe is past, and behold another vvoe comes quickly? An evil Spirit from
the Lord, enters into our counsels, and precipitateth us into a war with
the Dutch, soliciting a peace with us; (I forebeare to mention, the
unrighteousness of it, which was a greater plague upon the contrivers and
actors, then all that followed upon it, though the shame and loss, will make a
great total) in the beginning of this war, we were plagued with so much
success, as made us encourage our selves in this evil matter, victrix causa
diis placuit thought we; and yet in that little seeming succcesse we had, any
discerning person might have observed, how the hand of the Lord God of hosts,
was gone forth against us; for, though our enemies did flee, yet as being
deprived by the Lord, of both counsel and courage, we did not follow, when we
had them, even for the taking up; so that if our effrontry make us boast, of
this bout as a victory, we may, with blushing, remember the greater shame, that
the Lord poured upon us, in depriving us of the Spirit of conduct, that we knew
not, how to improve the advantage over a beaten enemy; so that the Lord by this
success, did seem only to lift us up, that he might, with the greater shame,
noise and observation, throw us down; and truly, whoever remembereth that
action and day, may confidently affirm, that the Lord fought for Holland and
against England, seeing he so observably interposed as a rere-vvard: But before
this Angel have done his work, that we might have a new proof of the
displeasure of the Almighty, and that he might make the World see, how he
himself, and not men, did cast us down; he sends a fire into our chief
City, before this war be ended, where we had burnt that Covenant; (I pass
all consideration of the immediate instruments; let us give and grant, it was
done upon design, even this, makes the judgment demonstrative, with a
witness, of his wrath and indignation) and as this fire, seemed to take wings,
or be carried from house to house, and street to street, by a destroying Angel;
so those, who were employed to quench it, (O it is ill quenching, where he
kindles, except with tears) were deprived of all wisdom, and discretion; or
rather, as if in the righteous judgment of the Lord, they had designedly set
themselves to obstruct the quenching of it, and so it burnt till the bulk of
the City was turned into ashes; That as the Nations abroad, had heard of our
rage in burning that Covenant, so they might hear of an act of holy revenge,
and be witnesses to the righteousness of his judgment, in giving us fire for
fire; and as the like fury, had never been witnessed against the Lord before,
so he had never kindled the like fire in the Nation before; Nay, nor almost the
like in the World, since the burning of Jerusalem; and truly the parallel,
between the judgments, may put us in mind of a parity, betwixt the
provocations; as the crucifying of the Son of God, and putting him to an open
shame, burnt the City of that bold abomination; so the crucifying of him again,
in shedding the blood of his servants, and putting him to such a shame, in
burning a Covenant made with him, (which is an unheard of indignity, amongst
Princes and Stats, even when after the violation of Leagues, they fall in open
hostility) kindled this fire, consumed the City of our solemnities, and buried
it into it is ashes.

But for all this, as we do not turn away from the evil of our way; but in
stead of stoping, and taking notice of the hand, that is gone forth against us,
we continue in putting forth our hand to iniquity; we become more insatiable in
sinning, rushing foreward in our course, as the horse does to the battle; every
bit and bridle, that is put in our mouth, is too weak to hold us; so his anger
is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. The Angel who had
drawn the sword, in stead of putting it up, seemed only to have been furbishing
it, while the flame was consuming our City: As we were become a froward
generation, Childreen in whom was no faith; so he continues, in his
righteousness, to heap mischiefs upon us, and to spend his arrows upon us: We
go on with the war; now, that God, who deprived us of wisdom how to improve
our former victory, first, leaves us in the pride and haughtiness of our
heart, to the folly and infatuation, of dividing our fleet, and then he
mustereth the host of the battle that comes against us; and so we are foiled
and put to flee, before that enemy, of whom we had said, we had no other
regret, but because engaged against an enemy, unvvorthy of our spirit and
courage; now are the Dutch their prisons filled with English prisoners: But
why do I insist? The close of the war, is the confusion of England, and a
perfect Eclipse of it is glory, our English vvalls are broken down and burnt,
wherein the hand of him who judged us, was so visible, that the actors
themselves do not mention it otherwise, then as the doing of the Lord, which
was mervellous in their eyes: Now is our Court confounded and distracted,
because the Lord, against whom they had sinned with so high a hand, made bare
his holy Arm, in the sight of the nations, by fighting against them; now is
the nation, in an universal consternation now is London seized with a panick
fear, to that height as it had been easy for the enemy, to have burnt the
remainders of our City, that had escaped the former fire: And whereas, we
would have a war, on any terms, with our peacable neighbors; now we must
post away our order, to accept of a peace on any terms, and (which is
remarkable) be forced to pass from those pretensions, on which we had
founded the equity of our war; thus are we stripped of our glory; and the
crown, which we had vvorn for many years, in the sight of the Nations,
falls from our head; (alas, that we should have forgotten to have said, woe
unto us that we have sinned) England who had upheld these Provinces, against
the pride of the Spanish Tyrranny, England who had conquered France, and at
the same time, were victorious over the Scotch their confederats, must now
find the nation perfectly besieged, by them, whom, in our pride, we thought
not a people; our ships burnt, in the most secure harbors of England, and we
necessitat, when under the feet of these whom we had despised, to accept of a
peace; which they might have made us condescend unto upon less honorable
terms: Which things befell us, that when the present generation shall
consider, and the succeeding ages inquire, into the cause of this disaster, and
ask the question, how we were so wonderfully brought down; It may be
answered, because in stead of keeping the Covenant with their God, they burnt
it, therefore, that they might read their sin and rage in their judgment, (or,
if they would not, others might) as he had formerly burnt their City, now he
burnt their ships, not in the sea, but within their harbors; and thus he
called the Nations to be vvitnesses, to the heat of his displeasure, in burying
our glory: As their was never such a sin before committed in the land, we were
never thus put to shame, and spit upon, in the sight of the nations; our being
made base and contemptible, in the eyes of them, who honored us, and had us
in estimation, must be refounded upon our bold sining against the most high
God; and our trampling upon his honor and interest, with such evidences of
contempt, has made us be greatly despised amongst the Nations, and caused him,
against whom we had lifted up our selves, trample us under foot, as the mire of
the streets: Well, we must now bear our shame, and find our selves sunk in
the gulf of ignominy, whereby the Lord was in a manner, trying us, if we
would turn from the evil of our way: But, Alas, that, which was the observe of
the Holy Ghost upon Ahaz, was manifestly verified upon us; so that it might
have been, with the same evidence and certainty, said; this is that Court, this
is that Kingdom, who being rebuked so remarkably, did, in stead of accepting
the punishment of their sin, trespass yet more and more against the Lord.

In this interval, wherein we seemed to have tranquillity from enemies without,
the plague upon our heart, is more evident, by the evil that was in our hand:
we had some quiet it is true, (wherein he gave us space to repent, and accept
of the punishment of our sins) but it was not so much a true peace, as the
dravving back of the hand of the great God, that he might fetch the sorer
blovv; for in stead of humbling our selves under the mighty hand of God; as if
we did meditat revenge against heaven, we not only continued in our former
unchristian practices; but, what our imperial crown had lost of it is luster,
we think to make it up, by appending the Mediator's crown to it; and
therefore, though we fall before others, yet we will, as we began, continue to
fight against God; and in this interval of peace from foreign enemies; as we
had burnt the bond of our subjection to Jesus Christ, so in prosecution of the
same quarrel, we advance our supremacy, to the degrading and exautorating of
him, by whom Kings reign; and carry with that height of insolence, as if we
had, not only resolved, to outdo all, that ever led the way to us, in this
opposition to Christ as King in Zion; but further, to give the defiance to all,
that ever should come after us, to make a law, which being considered in it is
most plain and obvious meaning, can, without straining, speak this more
explicitly; that, this man, this one Jesus, who calls himself a King, shall
not reign over us, we have no King but Caesar: we stated the question de
finibus Imperii mediatoris, and decided in our own favor, once for all;
making a decree, to take the house of God in possession to our selves; yea, and
as if, we intended to eternize our enmity and opposition to the son of God;
we, together with the imperial crown of the Nation, transmit a legal right
to our successors, to the crown and scepter of Jesus Christ; as if it were a
satisfaction for us, to lie down in the grave, with an assurance, that his
crown should not floorish upon his own head; by which one act, all our
former insolences were reacted, with this addition; that, whatever we
please to do in the house of the God of heaven hereafter, must be legal: And
thus, the Church has got an exotic head, and we have filled up the measure
of our iniquity: O that it might please the father of mercies, to give
repentance to his Majesty and the Nation, and to preserve both from reaping
that harvest of grief and desperate sorrow, which such a seed-time presageth:
In the mean time, the consumption, of the nation, is visible in it is
countenance, it is soul and substance is consumed; (as was excellently laid
openin that first and second discourse of my Lord Lucas, before the house of
Lords, in whom alone the ancient gallant spirit of the English Nation did show
it self and shine forth, and who, by that heroic act, has erected to himself
a monument, in the heart of all true Englishmen, and proposed himself as a
worthy pattern of imitation, to all who affect the glory of being true
Patriots) yet, while the Nation is in this low and languishing condition, we
are ploting and contriving a new war against the Dutch, and therefore we pick
quarrels with them, to give our own designs some color of justice, having
resolved upon the war, let them offer, what rational satisfaction they can;
yet, as if the Lord, from heaven would openly rebuke these secret mischievous
contriveances and works of darkness; he in a manner gives a commission, to
that very element, the stage on which we design to act this wickedness, to
fall upon us, sink our ships at sea, sweep away a considerable part of our
remaining substance, and swallow up our Land; and as upon Pestilence, fire
and svvord, this had been written, by the finger of the righteous judge of all
the earth, never the like before seen in England; so of this tempest, this
turnado and inundation (whereby the sea was become difficult and dangerous
for passage, in reguard of broken ships, filled also with the sad spectacle of
drowned men, driving to and fro in it, the land overflovved, houses, beasts
and men, having one common burial place) it was also said, never, did the Lord
witness at once, so much of his displeasure against the Nation, by any
sea-storme; hereby particularly pointing at and plaguing the Kingdom, both for
our breach of Covenant with the most High, and our former, and again resolved
upon breach of Covenant with our neighbors, as also our foolish pretension,
to an absolut dominion of the sea, to which we could set no bounds; if that
by taking notice of the displeasure of the living God against our iniquous
contriveances we might be stopped in this unhappy Carreer; but all in vain,
forevvard we will go. And the thing that makes the anger of the Lord, more
manifest against us, and our French confederat's, in this dispensation, was,
that remarkable passage of providence; while much havoc was at the same
time, made upon the French coast, as well as upon ours, the Dutch fleet, against
which we were making most fervid preparations, did ride all the time safe at
anchor, as it were in the center betwixt the two, without any lose; God thereby
in a manner manifesting, that he had taken these, whom we, in design and
endeavor, had devouted to destruction, into his own immediate protection; a
happy Omen; and who knows, but it is a speaking prognostic, of what he
intends, further to do for them and by them, to the frustration, and
disappointment of our projects and preparations; and how, because we would not
behold the Majesty of the Lord, nor see, when his hand was listed up, nor
listen to the voice of such a dreadfully menacing disswasive, he minds to
make us see, and put us to shame, for our envy at his people, and cause the
World take notice of it, when he makes the fire of his enemies to devour us.

Now, my friends and brethren, my design in this deduction, and the
assignement of it is cause, is not to lodge the provocation alone with the
Court, and leave it at their door, as if we were innocent, and in case to plead
guiltless; no, for besid's that we have made it our own, for not mourning as
we ought, for this horrid abomination, our shareing so deeply in the
punishment, points at, and proves us to be, deeply guilty in the
provocation: That we may therefore, by repentence, prevent the vvoeful day,
and by remembering whence we have fallen, renew first love, and return to
first works, before he remove the Candlestick, which is the terrible
judgment, vvherevvith we are this day threatened; let us consider, how
justly he may proceed, to the utmost of holy severity, and observe, what of
spotless equity, has been manifested, in all the smoakings of his wrath
against us, in all these blows of his hand, whereby our beauty is consumed;
let us think, how guilty we are, for not having been steadfast in his
Covenant, and for not performing our vows to the most High, before he make a
full end, and smite us so, that affliction shall not spring up the second time:
As it is neither possible for me, to enumerat all those ways, how we have made
our selves guilty, of a contempt and dreadful misreguard of that Oath of God,
whereby we were so expressly, so solemnly and indispensibly engaged in our
several places and stations, to walk before him to all pleasing, minding and
advancing, above all earthly concerns, reformation and Religion, witnessing and
showing forth it is power, in our conversation, that, the Nation might have been
called by that name, Jehovah Shammah, that so the reproach of Egypt (the
untendernesse, I mean, and profanity, which was amongst the multitude, kept
under superstitious ignorance for a great part, before our late reformation)
might have been rolled away from us; nor to accent and sharpen these
challenges, with their just aggravations and edge, that they may cut us at the
heart, and make us cry out; men and brethren, what shall we do, to be delivered
from the approaching destruction and impendent ruin, whereto, we and our
posterity, for the breach of our Covenant, and backslidings, are exposed? so, I
do purposely pass and forbear it; lest I should seem to exprobrat these to
one party as more guilty, while I pass by another as more innocent; but I am
sure while all are charged with this guilt, every gracious heart will suspect
himself, and say, Master is it I? And he is like to be found deepest in the
transgression before God, who is most ready to make light of the matter, and
with a supine misreguard of his own backslidings and Gods anger, dare in stead
of putting his mouth in the dust as guilty before him, wipe it, and say, What
have I done? Let us not only witness our repentance by a personal
reformation; but by a serious minding in our place and station, the reviving of
his work: Let us set ourselves to weep over the dust and stones of Zion: Let us
give him no rest, till he return and build his house, and fill it with his own
glorious presence, making thereby our gates salvation and our walls praise: God
seems by all the dispensations of the day, to put us, without more debat or
delay, to choose whether we will bleed or weep? And if we be sparing of our
tears, justice is like to be prodigal of our blood: If our eye do not trickle
down without intermission, at the sight of the desolations of the sanctuary,
and at the danger and distress of all the Churches of Christ, till the Lord
look down and behold from Heaven, he is threatening to bring distress upon us,
that we shall walk like blind-men, both because of our sining against the Lord,
and our security; and to pour out our blood as the dust and our flesh as the
dung: Do we not see the Church and Nation ready to be devoured, by the fire of
his jealousy? Do we not perceive the men with the slaughter weapon in their
hand? Why then do we delay to gather our selves together? Why do we not retire
within our selves, that we may return to the most High with rops about our
neck, as sentenced persons, upon the sight of the plague of our own heart, and
the iniquities that are in our hand, but particularly our woeful departings
from, and breaches of Covenant with our God, before the decree bring forth,
before the day pass as the chaff, before the fierce Anger of the Lord come
upon us? As A none such has been written over the head of these judgments,
which are already come; so we may certainly conclude, that A none such, to make
the ears of all that hear it tingle, and strike their hearts with amazement
and terror, at the report thereof, shall be written upon the wrath and woes,
that he will bring upon us for these breaches if not mourned over: If the Lord
employ the French, Irish and English Papists, which stand ready girt with their
sword upon their thigh, breathing out cruelty, and thirsting after blood, to be
the executioners of his displeasure, for a despised Gospel, and to avenge the
quarrel of a broken Covenant, and punish us, as our congregations have heard,
for our impenitencies and unperswadablenesse by all that has yet come upon us,
so to make our prayer before the Lord our God, that we might turn from our
iniquity and understand his truth; then may we conclude, that the nation shall
be made a Golgotha, a place of dead men's skuls, and that not only the Massacre
of Paris, Alva's murder and bloodshed in the Low Countries, the murders and
villainies committed in the valleys of Piedmont, with all the Marian bloodshed
and persecution in our own nation, but even that more bloody and barbarous
Massacre of Ireland, shall either be quit forgotten, or mentioned as light
things, when compared with the havocks, bloods, murders, fire and faggot,
whereby to the satiating the malice, fury, and revenge of her that must be
drunk with the blood of the Saints, and to the blunting of the edge of her
instrument's rage, keen to the utmost of cruelty, the land shall be laid wast
and made utterly desolat: If we still sleep on, after he has done so much to
awake us, after so many voices of word and rod, after he has been saying unto
us, Shall I not visit for these things? Shall not my soul be avenged upon such
a generation as this? Then there is no hope but that we shall be made a
generation of his wrath; nor is there another expectation, but that he will
accomplish his anger, and cause his fury to rest upon us, and be comforted: O
for grace to awake and prevent this woeful day, before he cause darkness, and
before our feet stumble upon the dark mountains! Let us therefore while it is
called to day, beware of hardening our hearts; let us consider one another, and
every man himself, to provok unto the exercise of repentance, Let us think on
our backslidings, and breaches of Covenant, that we may return unto the Lord
our God, before he cause his anger to fall upon us: Let us have while there is
a may be of hope, while there is yet a, who knows, if the Lord will return,
and repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, and think upon the Church, the
Nation, our selves and posterity, that we perish not.

The last thing wherewith I shall shut up this discourse, is, to remind you my
brethren, of what I formerly hinted, viz: That from the consideration of the
manifest unrighteousness of this war, not so much against the Dutch, as
against the Lord God, in concurring with, and assisting the sworn enemies of
the reformed Religion; yea and against our selves, our liberties, and our
posterity, by strengthening the hands of the most Stated adversary in the world
to the prosperity of the English nation, we may not only be humbled, that our
Court should be left of the Lord to these wicked contrivances, Religion and
libertydestroying courses, and that so many of our brethren, should be dragged
as slaves, to assist in this Religion-overturning Covenant Breaking war; but,
that as we would not by an association with the workers of these iniquities,
and a participation in their sin, share in the remarkable punishments, and
terrible plagues, whereby the righteous Lord will certainly be avenged, for
this breach of faith and Alliance, for this conspiracy against the reformed
Religion; so, we would withdraw and flee from, if we would not fall into the
hands of a provoked God, all concurrence in carrying on this war, directly or
indirectly: Neither let us think to please God, or be approved of him, if we
acquiesce in a simple forbearance, to contribut our assistance thereto; nay
somewhat else then such a neutrality is called for, in a day, when, all things
being considered, there seems to be the most formally pitched Battle, between
hrist and Antichrist, that has been in many generations: We are called under
the hafard of being reput and reckoned enemies to Christ and his cause (for
when he is crying so formally at this time, who is on my side who? All that are
not with him shall be esteemed enemies unto him) while some of our brethren in
the simplicity of their heart, not knowing any thing, are ensnared and seduced
into this quarrel, and more are deprived of their liberty, dragged as slaves,
and pressed to go fight, and sacrifice their lives to the Court, and French
interest, in prejudice of all these precious things and interests, which make
life desirable, and in the preservation whereof, it is glory to die: I say
while it is thus, we are called to pour out our hearts together and apart on
the behalf of our distressed, shamefully by us deserted, yea betrayed
Protestant brethren, that the Lord God of hosts, would make bare his strong Arm
and stand up for their help: We are not only debtors to them, when we can
contribut nothing else to their assistance, while they must jeopard their
lives, in contending against the mighty enemies of the Lord and his People, for
all the supply and help we can make them, by our assiduous and most importune
beggings and beseechings of God, for their safety and preservation, upon the
account of the reformed Religion, which, if they be foiled and put to the
worse, must also fall with them, as to it is visible profession; but also upon
the account of the true liberty and real interest of England; let the things
already mentioned, to demonstrat this, upon our supposed success against them,
be considered, and it will make the matter so evident, that I am sure, as he
cannot be a Christian or one who wishes the preservation of the Church, and
coming of the Kingdom of the Son of God in the World, since there has not
been for many ages, a People, whose civil interest was so twisted and
interwoven, with the great interest of Christ through the earth, in opposition
to Antichrist; so I am upon rational grounds persuaded, that he cannnot have
the heart of a true Englishman, he cannot be a true lover of the real good,
liberty and honor of our Nation, who does not wish well unto, and is not
earnestly solicitous for the safety of the United provinces in this juncture:
Alas! Shall our brethren the Dutch, go down into the valley to fight with the
enemy, and be engaged, not only upon the account of their own liberty, their
civil interests, and the reformed Religion; but also most evidently by an
undeniable consequence, for the liberty of England, and the preservation of the
same things amongst us? And will not we go up to the mount, and weep upon God
to stand by them? Shall they shed their blood by sea and land, for that truth
and doctrine, which is according to godliness, that should be dear to us
beyond and above our lives? And shall not we offer them the assistance, of our
utmost intercessions? What could we say to God? Or how could we satisfy our own
conscience, in so clear and crying an exigent, if we should, as nothing
concerned in the quarrel, or it is consequences, forbear to do this? How will
we make it appear, that we prefer Jerusalem to our chief joy, and are lovers
of righteousness, on whose side soever it is found, or are really desirous to
do all that is in our power, to prevent the bondage of the nation, and preserve
our selves and our posterity, from being sold slaves to foreign enemies and
the exorbitant lust of our own Court, if now, when there is no other work for
us to do, we make it not our work, to lift up our heart with our hands unto God
in the heavens, praying and pleading by all manner of prayer and supplication,
either to reclaim our rulers, from these unrighteous and violent courses; or
to preserve our oppressed brethren, and appear their protector, when deserted
of all humane help? We would take heed how we lay our selves aside from this
innocent and Christian concurrence. I doubt nothing but as the Lord will write
in most legible Characters, and witness either sooner or later, high and hoar
displeasure, against all the contrivers of this war, and willing contributers
of their assistance to it, and reckon them, who, if it were but by their
words and vvishes, witness their concurrence, and show themselves enemies
to our oppressed protestant friends, though they neither be guilty of that
theiving basensse of caping, or a more formal conjunction this abominable war,
adversaries to the reformed Religion, through the World, and enemies to all
righteousness amongst men, so, I am equally persuaded, they shall make
themselves guilty of a detestable neutrality, and incur the curse of not
helping the Lord against the mighty, who do not implore his Aid for our
oppressed brethren, and stir not up themselves to pray, that he would appear
to plead a cause that is so much his own: Let not the vain fancy of affection
to the honor of the Nation, when to the height of baseness engaged in a war,
or lothnesse to see our contrymen put to shame, even when it is impossible
to appear in this engagement and cover our shame, de murre or foreslovv us in
this duty: It Is true, our Nation ought to be dear unto us, the lives and
honor of our contrymen precious in our sight; but we should be so much
Protestants, so much Christians, as to acquiesce rather, that we, our
posterity, our name, and Nation should be delete and perish from under the
heavens of the Lord, before the reformed Religion, that great interest of
Christ in the World, by our success be destroyed, or his declarative glory
suffer an eclipse. Nay let us consult either reason or Religion, and then, the
thing which seems to demurre or dissvvade, will certainly drive us to the
duty that is pressed: Let us love our Lord Jesus Christ so well, let us love
the honor, prosperity and welfare of our Nation so well, let us love the reput
and renown of our contrymen so well, as to pray, that his Kingdom may come,
and that the designs of these who in this engagement, are engaged against us,
and our precious interests, may be defeat, and that their hands may not be able
to perform their enterprise, and there is no more driven at or desired; for,
if the sword that is now drawn against the Dutch, return victorious and drunk
with their blood, it will not be put up, till the yoke be wreathed about our
neck, and it have shed the blood of such, who are not so much beasts, as with a
tamenesse to take it on; and if we be deprived of, and outlive the lose of our
only treasure, Religion and liberty, where then is the blessedness we spoke
of? Where then is the glory of our nation whereof we boasted? Happy is the man,
who knows the times, and what Israel has to do, while it is the plague of
many, that they are as asses couching under the burden: Once for all, let us
fear, and stand aloof from, yea in our place and station withstand, all these
sinful combinations with such, as have turned aside unto their crooked vvayes,
and design and endeavor with so much vigor, the overturning of his work,
lest God lead us forth with the workers of Iniquity: It Is true, he must have
a Church, and his interest must be preserved; for the gates of hell cannot
prevail against it; yet if we either join with these consederats against him,
or forbear to witness our desire of his abiding with us, by pleading with
him, for the preservation of his low, his abandoned, born down, yea and
betrayed interests; deliverance shall come another way, for he is the God of
salvations, against whom in this conjunction, we have lifted up the head and
stretched out the hand; but we, our interest, and whatsoever is dear and
desirable to men, shall be destroyed and perish: But my brethren, as I hope for
better things of you, yea for all things, which may prove you to be lovers of
our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, of the Churches abroad and of our Nation's
interest, honor and liberty, though I thus speak; so, I desire to believe,
that not only that poor people against whom our Court, with the French are
engaged (the second part of Herod and Pilat's History) shall be preserved,
though they may be brought lovv; but that the destruction of the poor remnant
amongst our selves, which (that the actors may at once take away Religion and
liberty together with our lives) is intended, shall be prevented; for strong is
the Lord God who judges the enemies of his people and pleads the causes of
their soul: Let us therefore wait on him, and continue with him in these
tentations, carrying in the duties of the present day, and amidst all the
dangers which accompany, a faithful acquiting of our selves in our Masters
service, as knowing, that the adversaries of the Lord shall be broken in
pieces, out of heaven shall he thunder upon them: The Lord shall judge the ends
of the earth, he shall give strength unto his King (the coming of whose
Kingdom, is now so much opposed by these Kings, and destruction of whose
subjects and people, is so manifestly designed and furiously driven by them)
and exalt the horn of his anointed, when he has provided carpenters, to fray
the horns of these, who rejoice in a thing of naught, and have taken unto them
horns, by their own strength, to push the inheritance of the Lord: Faxit Deus
et festinet, and then we have the desire of our hearts.
