AN EXHORTATION TO the taking of the Solemn League and Covenant, FOR
REFORMATION AND Defense of Religion, the Honor and happiness of the King, and
the Peace and safety of the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.
IF the power of Religion, or solid Reason, if Loyalty to the King, and piety
to their Native Country, or love to themselves, and natural affection to their
posterity, if the Example of men touched with a deep sense of all these, or
extraordinary success from God thereupon, can awaken an embroyled bleeding
remnant to embrace the sovereign, and only means of their recovery, there
can be no doubt but this Solemn League and Covenant will find wheresoever it
shall be tendered, a people ready to entertain it with all cheerfulness and
duty.

And were it not commended to the Kingdom by the concurrent encouragement of
the Honorable Houses of Parliament, the Assembly of Divines, the renowned City
of London, multitudes of other persons of eminent rank and quality in this
Nation, and the whole Body of Scotland, who have all willingly sworn and
subscribed it, with rejoicing at the Oath, so graciously seconded from Heaven
already, by blasting the Counsels, and breaking the power of the Enemy more
than ever; yet it goes forth in its own strength, with such convincing
evidence of equity, Truth and Righteousness, as may raise in all (not wilfully
ignorant, or miserably seduced) inflamed affections to join with their
Brethren in this happy Bond, for putting an end to the present miseries, and
for saving both of King and Kingdom from utter ruin now so strongly and openly
labored by the Popish faction, and such as have been bewitched and besotted by
that viperous and bloody generation.

For what is there almost in this Covenant, which was not for substance either
expressed or manifestly included in that solemn Protestation of May 5. 1641.
wherein the whole Kingdom stands engaged until this day? The sinful neglect
whereof, does (as we may justly fear) open one floodgate the more to let in
all these calamities upon the Kingdom, and cast upon it a necessity of
renewing Covenant, and of entering into this.

If it be said, the extirpation of Prelacy, to wit, the whole Hierarchicall
Government (standing, as yet, by the known Laws of the Kingdom) is new, and
unwarrantable: This will appear to all impartial understandings, (though new)
to be not only warrantable, but necessary; if they consider (to omit what some
say, that this Government was never formally established by any Laws of this
Kingdom at all) that the very life and soul thereof is already taken from it
by an Act passed this present Parliament, so as (like Jezabels Carcass, of
which no more was left but the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands)
nothing of jurisdiction remains but what is precarious in them, and voluntary
in those who submit unto them: that their whole Government is at best but a
humane constitution, and such as is found and adjudged by both Houses of
Parliament, (in which, the judgment of the whole Kingdom is involved and
Declared) not only very prejudicial to the Civil State, but a great
hinderance also to the perfect Reformation of Religion; Yea, who knows it not
to be too much an enemy there unto, and destructive to the power of
godliness, and pure administration of the Ordinances of Christ: which moved
the well-affected, almost throughout this Kingdom, long since to Petition this
Parliament (as has been desired before, even in the Reign of Queen Elizabeth,
and of King James) for a total abolition of the same. Nor is any man hereby
bound to offer any violence to their persons, but only, in his place and
calling, to endeavor their extirpation in a lawful way.

And as for those Clergymen, who pretend that they (above all others) cannot
Covenant to extirpate that Government, because they have (as they say) taken a
solemn Oath to obey the Bishops, in licitis et honestis: they can tell, if
they please, that they that have sworn obedience to the Laws of the Land, are
not thereby prohibited from indevouring by all lawful means the abolition of
those Laws, when they prove inconvenient or mischievous. And if yet there
should any Oath be found into which any Ministers or others have entered, not
warranted by the Laws of God and the Land, in this case, they must teach
themselves and others, that such Oaths call for repentance, not pertinacy in
them.

If it be pleaded that this Covenant crosses the Oaths of Supremacy and
Allegiance; there can be nothing farther from truth: for, this Covenant binds
all, and more strongly engages them to preserve and defend the Kings Majesty's
Person, and authority in the preservation and defense of the true Religion and
Liberties of the Kingdoms.

That scruple, that this is done without the Kings consent, will soon be
removed, if it be remembered that the Protestation of the fifth of May before
mentioned, was in the same manner voted and executed by both Houses, and after
(by order of one House alone) sent abroad to all the Kingdom, his Majesty not
excepting against it, or giving any stop to the taking of it, albeit he was
then resident in Person at Whitehall.

Erra 10. Neh. 9.
Thus Ezra and Nehemiah drew all the people into a Covenant, without any
special Commission stom the Persian Monarchs (then their Sovereigns) so to
do, albeit they were not free Subjects, but Vassals, and one of them the
meniall Servant of Artaxerxes, Neh. 1.
then by Conquest King of Judah also.

Nor has this doctrine or practice been deemed seditious or unwarrantable by
the Princes that have sat upon the English Throne, but justified and defended
by Queen Elizabeth of blessed memory, with the expense of much Treasure and
Noble blood, in the united Provinces of the Netherlands combined not only
without, but against the unjust violence of Philip of Spain; King James
followed her steps, so far as to approve their onion, and to enter into
league with them as free States; which is continued by his Majesty now
reigning, onto this day; who both by his expedition for relief of Roebel in
France, and his strict confederacy with the Prince of Orange, and the States
General, notwithstanding all the importunity of Spain to the contrary, has
set to his Seal that all that had been done by his Royal Ancestors; in
maintenance of those who had so engaged and combined themselves, was just and
warrantable.

And what had become of the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of our sister Nation
of Scotland, had they not entered into such a solemn League and Covenant at the
beginning of the late troubles there? which course, however it was at first, by
the Popish and Prelatick Projectors, represented to his Majesty as an offense
of the highest nature, justly deserving chastisement by the fury of a puissant
Army; yet when the matter came afterward in cool blood to be debated, first
by Commissioners of both kingdoms, and then in open Parliament here, (when all
those of either House, who are now engaged at Oxford, were present in
Parliament, and gave their Votes, therein) it was found, adjudged and declared
by the King in Parliament, that our dear Brethren of Scotland had done
nothing, but what became loyal and obedient Subjects, and were thereupon by
Act of Parliament publicly righted in all the Churches of this Kingdom, where
they had been defamed.

Therefore however some men, hoodwinkt and blinded by the artifices of those
Jesuiticall Engineers, who have long conspired to sacrifice our Religion to the
Idolatry of Rome, our Laws, Liberties and persons to arbitrary slavery, and
our estates to their insatiable avarice, may possibly be deterred and amused
with high threats and Declarations, flying up and down on the wings of the
Royal Name and Countenance (now captivated and prostituted to serve all their
lusts) to proclaim all Rebels and Traitors who take this Covenant; yet let no
faithful English heart be afraid to join with our Brethren of all the three
Kingdoms in this solemn League, as sometimes the men of Israel (although
under another King) did with the men of Judah, 2 Chronicles. 30.
at the invitation of Hezekiah.

What though those tongues set on fire by Hell do rail and threaten? That God
who was pleased to clear up the innocence of Mordecai and the Jews against
all the malicious aspersions of wicked Haman to his and their Sovereign, so as
all his plotting produced but this effect, Esth. 9.
that when the Kings commandment and decree drew near to be put in
execution, and the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, it was
turned to the contrary; and the Jews had rule over them that hated them, and
laid hands on such as sought their hurt, so as no man could withstand them; and
that same God, who but even as yesterday, vouchsafed to disperse and scatter
those dark clouds and fogs which overshadowed that Loyal and Religious
Kingdom of Scotland, and to make they righteousness to shine as clear as the
Sun at noone day in the very eyes of their greatest enemies, will
doubtlessely stand by all those who with singleness of heart, and a due sense
of their own sins, and a necessity of reformation, shall now enter into an
everlasting Covenant with the Lord, never to be forgotten, to put an end to
all those unhappy and unnatural breaches between the King and such as are
faithful in the Land; causing their righteousness and praise to spring forth
before all the Nations, to the terror and confusion of those men of blood, the
confederate enemies of God and the King, who have long combined, and have now
raked together the dregs and scumme of many Kingdoms, to bury all the glory,
honor and liberty of this Nation in the eternal grave of dishonor and
destruction.

A SOLEMN League and Covenant, FOR Reformation, and Defense of Religion, The
Honor and Happiness of the KING, And the Peace and Safety of the three
Kingdoms OF England, Scotland, and Jreland.
WE Noblemen, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens, Burgesses, Ministers of the
Gospel, and Commons of all sorts in the kingdoms of England, Scotland and
Ireland, by the Providence of God living under one King, and being of one
Reformed Religion, halving before our eyes the glory of God, and the
advancement of the Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, the honor
and happiness of the Kings Majesty, and His Posterity, and the true public
Liberty, Safety and Peace of the Kingdoms, wherein every ones private condition
is included, and calling to mind the treacherous and bloody plots,
Conspiracies, Attempts, and practices of the Enemies of God, against the true
religion, and professors thereof in all places, especially in these three
Kingdoms ever since the reformation of religion, and how much their rage, power
and presumption, are of late, and at this time increased and exercised; whereof
the deplorable estate of the Church and Kingdom of Ireland, the distressed
estate of the Church and Kingdom of England, and the dangerous estate of the
Church and Kingdom of Scotland, are present and public Testimonies; We have
now at last, (after other means of Supplication, Remonstrance, Protestations,
and Sufferings) for the preservation of our selves and our religion, from utter
ruin and Destruction, according to the commendable practice of these Kingdoms
in former times, and the Example of Gods people in other Nations; after mature
deliberation, resolved and determined to enter into a mutual and solemn
League and Covenant, wherein we all subscribe, and each one of as for himself,
with our hands lifted up to the most high God, do swear:

I. THat we shall sincerely, really and constantly, through the Grace of God,
endeavor in our several places and callings, the preservation of the Reformed
Religion in the Church of Scotland, in doctrine, Worship, Discipline and
Government, against our common Enemies, the Reformation of Religion in the
Kingdoms of England and Ireland, in Doctrine, Worship, Discipline and
Government, according to the Word of God, and the Example of the best Reformed
Churches; And shall endeavor to bring the Churches of God in the three
Kingdoms, to the nearest conjunction and Uniformity in Religion, Confession of
Faith, Form of Church Government, Directory for Worship and Catechizing; That
we and our posterity after us may as Brethren live in Faith and Love, and the
Lord may delight to dwell in the midst of us.

II. That we shall in like manner, without respect of persons, endeavor the
extirpation of Popery, Prelacy, (that is, Church Government, by Archbishops,
Bishops, their Chancellours and Commissaries, Deanes, Deanes and Chapters,
Archdeacons, and all other Ecclesiastical Officers depending on that Hirarchy)
Superstition, Heresy, Schism, Profaneness, and whatsoever shall be found to
be contrary to found Doctrine, and the power of Godliness; lest we partake in
other men's sins, and thereby be in danger to receive of their plagues, and that
the Lord may be one, and his Name one in the three Kingdoms.

III. We shall with the same sincerity, reallity and constancy, in our several
Vocations, endeavor with our estates and lives, mutually to preserve the
Rights and Privileges of the Parliaments, and the Liberties of the Kingdoms,
and to preserve and defend the Kings Majesty's person and authority, in the
preservation and defense of the true Religion, and Liberties of the Kingdoms,
that the world may bear witness with our consciences of our Loyalty, and that
we have no thoughts or intentions to diminish His Majesty's just power and
greatness.

IIII. We shall also with all faithfulness endeavor the discovery of all such
as have been, or shall be Incendiaries, Malignants, or evil Instruments, by
hindering the Reformation of Religion, dividing the King from his people, or
one of the Kingdoms from another, or making any Faction or parties amongst the
people, contrary to this League and Covenant, that they may be brought to
public trial, and receive condign punishment, as the degree of their
offenses shall require or deserve, or the supreme Judicatories of both Kingdoms
respectively, or others having power from them for that effect, shall judge
convenient.

V. And whereas the happiness of a blessed Peace between these Kingdoms,
denied in former times to our Progenitors, is by the good providence of God
granted unto us, and has been lately concluded, and settled by both
Parliaments, we shall each one of us, according to our place and interest
endeavor that they may remain conjoined in a firm Peace and Union to all
Posterity; And that Justice may be done upon the wilful opposers thereof, in
manner expressed in the precedent Articles.

VI. We shall also according to our places and callings in this common cause of
Religion, Liberty and Peace of the Kingdoms, assist and defend all those that
enter into this League and Covenant, in the maintaining and pursuing thereof,
and shall not suffer our selves directly or indirctly by whatsoever
combination, persuasion or terror, to be divided, and withdrawn frm this
blessed Union and conjuction, whether to make defectio^ to the contrary part,
or to give our selves to a detestable indifferency or neutrality in this cause,
which so much concerns the glory of God, the good of the Kingdoms, and the
honor of the King; but shall all the days of our lives, zealously and
constantly continue therein, against all opposition, and promote the same
according to our power, against all Lets and Impediments whatsoever; and what
we are not able our selves to suppress or overcome, we shall reveal and make
known, that it may be timely prevented or removed; All which we shall do as in
the sight of God.

And because these Kingdoms are guilty of many sins and provocations against
God, and his Son Jesus Christ, as is too manifest by our present distresses and
dangers, the fruits thereof; We profess and declare before God and the world,
our unfayned desire to be humbled for our own sins, and for the sins of these
Kingdoms, especially, that we have not as m ought, valued the inestimable
benefit of the Gospel, that we have not labored for the purity and power
thereof, and that we have not endeavored to receive Christ in our hearts, nor
to walk worthy of him in our lives, which are the causes of other sins and
Transgressions, so much abounding amongst us; And our true and unfeigned
purpose, desire, and endeavor for our selves, and all others under our power
and charge, both in public and in private, in all duties we owe to God and
man, to amend our lives, and each one to go before another in the example of a
real Reformation, that the Lord may turn away his wrath, and heavy
indignation, and establish these Churches and Kingdoms in truth and peace. And
this Covenant we make in the presence of Almighty God the Searcher of all
hearts, with a true intention to perform the same, as we shall answer at that
great day, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed, Most humbly
beseeching the Lord to strengthen us by his Holy Spirit for this end, and to
bless our desires and proceedings with such success, as may be deliverance
and safety to his people, and encouragement to other Christian Churches
groaning under, or in danger of the yoke of Antichristian Tyranny; to join in
the same, or like Association and Covenant, to the glory of God, the
enlargement of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, and the peace and Tranquillity of
Christian Kingdoms and Commonwealths.

THE DECLARATION of the Kingdoms of ENGLAND And SCOTLAND, Joined in Arms for
the Vindication and Defense of their Religion, Liberties, and Laws, against the
Popish, Prelaticall, and Malignant Party
By the Honorable Houses of the Parliament of England, and the Honorable
Convention of Estates of the Kingdom of Scotland, Jan. 20. 1643.
IF either Christian Duty, which, by reason of the Light of the Gospel so
clearly shining amongst us, might have been expected from the Professors of
Religion; Or if natural Affection, which, even in the Heathen and Infidells,
ignorant of Christ, has abounded toward their Native Country; Or sincere
respect to His Majesty's Honor and Happiness, could have been found in the
waves or hearts of our common Enemies, the Enemies of Truth and Peace; If they
had either feared God, or regarded men, or yielded to our Importunities, We had
not, after so many Petitions, Declarations and Remonstrances as have filled all
men's ears and hands, been put to this necessity of a new Declaration (which
therefore must be more patheticke and pressing then any of the former) Nor
after so many troubles and sufferings of the Kingdom of Scotland, after the
desolation of the Kingdom of Ireland, and after so much blood, and so many
unnatural Tragedies in the Kingdom of England, had we been redacted to this
present condition, and joint posture of Arms, the Lord, whose counsels are a
great depth, and who is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his Works,
has just cause of controversy against us, and this whole Island.

But who would have believed, That our Religion, Liberties, and Laws, which for
so long a time have endured Opposition and Assaults of foreign Power, envying
our happiness, would have been opposed, oppressed, and trod under foot, by the
craft and cruelty of our own Natives and Contrymen?

In this our extremity, first of all we declare, That we place not our
confidence in our own counsels and strength, but our confidence is in God
Almighty, the Lord of Hosts, who will not leave nor forsake his people; It is
his own Truth and Cause which we maintain, with all the Reformed Churches, and
which has been witnessed and sealed by the Testimony, Sufferings, and Blood of
so many Confessors and Martyrs, against the Heresy, Superstition, and Tyranny
of Antichrist: The glory of his own Name, The exaltation of the Kingdom of his
Son, and The preservation of his Church, and of this whole Island from utter
ruin and devastation, is our Aim, and the End which we have before our eyes.
His Covenant have we in both Nations solemnly sworn and subscribed; which he
would not have put in our hearts to do, if he had been minded to destroy us:
The many Prayers and Supplications which these many years past, but especially
of late have been offered up with Fasting and Humiliation, and with strong
crying and tears, unto him that is able to deliver and save us, are a Seed
which promise unto us a plentiful Harvest of Comfort and Happiness: and the
Apostasy, Atheism, Idolatry, Blasphemies, Profaneness, Cruelty, Excess,
and open Mocking of all Godliness and Honesty, have filled the cup of our
adversaries to the brim, and threaten their speedy and fearful destruction,
unless it be prevented by such extraordinary repentance, as seems not yet to
have entered into their hearts.

Upon these and the like Grounds and Considerations, being confident that this
War wherein both Nations, now firmly united, are so deeply engaged, is of God;
we resolve with courage and constancy unto the end, to do our part; and the
Lord, who has stirred up our spirits, displayed his Banner before us, and
given the Alarm, do that which seems him good.

Secondly, although every man is to hope for the principal reward of his
service from God, rewards every one according to his works; yet we find our
selves bound in conscience and equity to Declare, That besides those who have
the Public Faith engaged to them for their security, such as since the
beginning have done valiantly, and dealt faithfully in this Cause, and such as
have chosen rather to suffer the spoiling of their goods, then to assist the
Enemy, or to take Arms against their Religion and Country, and shall continue
constant in the same course of doing or suffering unto the end, shall be
according to their Merits taken into public Notice and Consideration; their
losses (so far as may be) repaired, and themselves honored and rewarded by
such means and ways, as we trust God in his providence shall afford, and the
Parliaments or Estates of the two Kingdoms respectively shall in their
Wisdom, Justice, and Thankfulness, judge most convenient: so that no man who
has been eminent in action, or has suffered any notable loss for the
public, shall be neglected or slighted, but one way or other shall be
thankfully remembered, to his own honor and the good of his posterity.

Thirdly, although newtrality and indifferency in the time of the danger of
Religion be a thing detestable to God, who wills all Christians earnestly to
contend for the Truth: and such as have been Newtralists or indifferent in the
times of civil division and danger of the Commonwealth, have been in all
Nations severely punished as pernicious and public enemies: Yet that the
consciences of all men may be the more convinced, and all pretexts removed, We
give now PUBLIC WARNING to such persons to rest no longer upon their
Newtrality, or to please themselves with the naughty and slothful pretext of
Indifferency, but that they address themselves speedily to take the Covenant,
and join with all their power in the defense of this Cause, against the common
Enemy; and by their zeal and forwardness hereafter, to make up what has been
wanting through their lukewarmnesse; this they will find to be their greatest
wisdom and safety; Otherwise We do Declare them to be public Enemies to the
Religion and Country, and that they are to be censured and punished as
professed Adversaries and Malignants.

Fourthly, Because a great many of the multitude of the people, upon ignorant
Mistakings, false Informations, and Threats, or Compulsions, against their wills
and inclination, have been induced or constrained to join in Arms with the
Enemies against their Religion and Native country; We do Declare that all
common Soldiers, who upon the humble acknowledgement of their former errors,
shall offer themselves willingly and speedily to take the Covenant, and shall
join heartily and really in the defense of this Cause, as becomes good
Christians and lovers of their Country, shall be freely accepted into the
Covenant, and their former error passed by; otherwise let them expect the
punishment of wilful Delinquents and Malignants.

Fifthly, because some of the Scottish Nation, upon their own private respects,
or upon specious pretenses and fair persuasions, have joined themselves in
Arms with the popish Prelaticall, and Malignant party, against the Parliament
and Kingdom of ENGLAND, and not considering the nature of the Cause in which
they have been engaged, nor the deep interest of the Church and kingdom of
SCOTEAND, upon which this War was to turn in the end, have been fighting
against their own Religion and native Kingdom: We do therefore again WARN
all such, of whatsoever quality, and in whatsoever place, speedily to
withdraw themselves from that Faction, to confess their mistakes, and to
join in the Covenant and cause of God in both Kingdoms before the first day
of March next; otherwise we Declare, in the behalf of the Kingdom of ENGLAND,
that they are to expect no favor, but are to be used as desperate Malignants.
And We Declare in behalf of the kingdom of SCOTLAND, if they either continue
in Arms after the foresaid first day of March, or withhold their help and
assistance from their Native country in the time of trouble and danger, they
are to be censured and punished as public enemies to their Religion and
Country, perfidious transgressors of their National Covenant, and their
estates disposed of for the use of the Public.

Sixthly, Because there are diverse Noblemen, Knights, Gentlemen, Citizens; and
others, who by forsaking or deserting the Parliament of England, and by joining
themselves to the Enemies of Religion, his Majesty's happiness and peace of
the kingdoms, have made the Division greater, and the Breaches wider betwixt
the King and his Parliament; and thereby contrary to the duty of their places
and callings, have been the cause of the shedding of much innocent Blood, of
great Losses, and of many Miseries and Dangers to the public of both
Kingdoms, and of the sufferings of private men in their Estates, and Lives,
and yet are not to be reckoned amongst the prime Authors of this unnatural
War, nor amongst the malicious and desperate Enemies of their Religion and
country: We do Declare, That all such forsaking their former Opposition,
returning to their duty, and endeavoring the good of Religion and the public
Peace, shall, as to their lives and liberties of their persons, be secured, and
shall be received into favor: But to the end, that a just difference may be
made betwixt such persons returning so late to their duty, and those that never
departed from it, they must expect, that toward the payment of the public
Debts, relieving the common Burdens of the Kingdoms, and repairing of
particular losses: All which in a great part have been contracted and sustained
by their default or procurement: Their estates in some proportion should be
liable, and that as the wisdom and discretion of Parliament, or of such as
shall be authorized by them, (who will be as careful to prevent their ruin as
to punish their Delinquencies) shall find and judge to be necessary for that
end. Wherein also, the time of their returning and offering themselves, the
reality of their affections and intentions, and readiness to join in the
common Cause and Covenant, will be taken into special consideration. And in
case they persist in their Opposition, and shall not return before the first
day of March next, they are not to expect favor, but shall be punished as
public enemies to their Religion and Country.

Seventhly, Because Papists and popish Recusants, according to the principles
of their profession, have ever been plotting and contriving the change of
Religion in this Island, and the ruin of all the Professors thereof: And after
the frustration of their attempts, having waited upon such a time as this, have
alienated the heart or the Kings Majesty from his Protestant and loyal
Subjects, taken Arms against the Parliament and Kingdom; and by all their
means and power have maintained a bloody and unnatural War, presuming in the
end to have their execrable Superstition and Idolatry set up in the place of
the true Reformed Religion, and the King and his kingdoms to be brought under
the power and tyranny of the Pope. We do hereby Declare, that all such
Papists and popish Recusants, who have been, now are, or shall be actually in
Arms, under the false pretense of defending the Kings person and authority, are
to look for no favor, but to be punished as trayrors and professed and
intolerable Enemies of Religion and their Native country. The same Declaration
We also make against all such Irish Rebels, whether Papists or others, who have
come over from Ireland, and assisted in this war against the Parliament, and
Kingdom of England.

And Lastly, because there are some few wicked and divellish spirits of both
Kingdoms, who have kindled and fomented the fire of Division and War betwixt
the King and his Parliament, or have misgoverned his Majesty's Counsels and
courses to his own dishonor, and to the destruction of his loving and dutiful
subjects, or have infused malignancy in others, or have been restless and and
active Instruments of the troubles and miseries of his Majesty's Dominions.

We do Declare, concerning those who are or shall be found by the Supreme
Judicatories of the Kingdoms respectively, or their Committees appointed for
that effect, to be such, That as the conscience of their own bad deservings
has made them to despair of favor, and thereby uncessantly to work more and
more mischief against their Religion and Native country, so are they to look
for such execution of Justice, as is due to traitors and enemies of Religion,
of the King, and his Kingdoms for Terror and example to others, in all times
to come.

And it is further now Declared, That the whole estates real and personal,
moveable and inheritance of those that shall not come in at the times before
limited in the sixth Article, and of the persons before excepted from pardon,
(as of Papists in Arms, Irish Rebels, and those who shall be found to come
within the compass of the precedent Article) shall be forfeited and employed
for paying the public debts, relieving the common burdens of the Kingdoms,
and repairing of particular losses.

And this Declaration we make, not from any presumption or vain-glorying in the
strength of our Armies and Forces, but from the sense of that duty which is
required, and expected from the high places and public relations wherein we
stand, and from the assurance We have of the assistance of God, by whose
providence the trust and safety of these Kingdoms is put into our hands at
this time, having ofter long and grave consultation, resolved and deereed,
never to lay down Arms till Truth and Peace, by the blessing of God, be
settled in this Island upon a firm foundation, for the present and future
Generations, which shall be esteemed of Us an abundant reward of all that We

A DECLARATION Of the Kingdom of SCOTLAND, For Information and Satisfaction to
their Brethren of England, concerning the present Expedition into ENGLAND.
ALthough we have reason to believe that the bloody and barbarous attempts of
the Papists and their Faction, both in England and Ireland, and the manifold
oppressions and miseries endured by those that stand well affected to the
Protestant Religion, and their Countries Liberty, have made way in the hearts
of men for the ready entertainment of assistance from their Brethren, whose
earnest desire it is, and whose utmost endeavor it shall be, to preserve and
restore both unto them: Yet knowing how industrious the malice of the Devil
and his instruments are, in raising Prejudices, and fomenting jealousies
betwixt them whose hearts and minds ought to be one, because their happiness
is the same, and particularly betwixt us and our Brethren of England, that by
dividing us from each other, they might destroy us both: And that this our
second Expedition into England (which we doubt not but God will bless, to the
advantage of that Nation, as he did our first, to the happiness of our own)
in steal of wonder and opposition, may find the cheer ull concurrence of all
those who together with us desire, The Preservation and Reformation of
Religion: The honor and happiness of the King; The Peace and Liberty of the
Kingdoms: We thought fit to permit this short, but free and ingenuous
Declaration, of our Grounds and Intentions in this our present undertaking,
that so we may meet with none but such as we may either find peaceable or
leave inexcusable.

Whereas there ore the greatest questions that are like to arise in this
business, may be reduced to these three particulars, viz. The justness of our
Cause: The lawfulness of our calling thereto: And The faithfulness of our
carriages therein. We shall hereby endeavor to give satisfaction in them all,
and doubt not to do it, unless there remain some whose inve^erate malice has
produced in them a resolution to be unsatisfied.

As for the cause and ground of this undertaking, we are not ignorant with how
much earnestness the sons of slander and perdition (whose custom is to
traduce those proceedings which they know not how to disappoint) do endeavor
to possess the hearts of our Brethren, that we are coming to fish in the
troubled waters of England, to seek and take our own advantages in the midst of
your necessities. But suffer not your e^res, much less your hearts, to be open
to any such delusions, whereof we trust your eyes shall shortly witness the
falsehood. For as here after we doubt not to appeal to our carnages and your
consciences, besides your late experience of our Religious observance of our
former Declarations of this kind; so in the mean time give us leave to appeal
to the great searcher of hearts, who knows; That had not the love of Christ,
requiring Christians to bear one another burden; and the Law of nature
challenging our utmost care and endeavor, for the prevention of our own danger
and ruin, which an ordinary understanding will easily see to be wrapped up in
our neighbors, And our duty, and desire of rescuing the King from the dangers
wherein he is involved, by the company and pernicious Counsel of those who are
enemies to Religion, his Majesty's happiness, and Peace of his Dominions,
Called and compelled us to this Service, we could with far more content and
satisfaction to our selves, have enjoyed with quietness our dry morsel, then
entered into your houses full of sacrifices with strife: Which yet since we are
required and necessitated to, by that just Calling, hereafter to be mentioned,
We profess before God and the World, that our hearts and thoughts are clean
and free from any other Intentions then those expressed in our solemn League
and Covenant, in which we are confederate with England, viz. The Preservation
and Reformation of Religion; The Honor and Happiness of the King; and, The
Peace and Liberties of the Kingdoms. All which we now apprehend to be deeply
endangered, by the Councels and Confederacies of Papists, Prelates, Malignants,
and their adherents, so prevalent in England and Ireland: And we shall no
otherwise desire a blessing upon our endeavors, then as they shall be directed
to the conservation and establishment thereof.

And because it is not sufficient to be engaged in a good Cause, unless by a
good calling, we do hereby further declare, That though the inseparable
interests of both Nations in their Religion and Liberties, which having the
same common Enemies, must look to stand and fall together, might have given us
sufficient warrant to have endeavored the prevention of our own ruin, by
preserving our Friends and Brethren from destruction: yet that we might be the
more fully and formally obliged to this Christian duty and service, and so the
mouth of slander and malice be stopped, God has so ordered things in his wise
and just providence, that the Parliament, of England, who (beside, their
interest in the Preservation and Reformation of Religion, and the defense of
the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, to which our help is requited) have a
particular obligation upon this Nation (As we have formerly declared our
Intentions published before our last Expedition) for refusing to countenance or
maintain a War against us, in the year 1640. have thought fit by their
Commissioners enabled to that effect, to desire a firm Union with us; and this
just and necessary assistance from us.

And whereas it is too obvious an Objection, That the Kings command or consent
being no ingredient, our Calling is thereby rendered deficient: We answer, That
though, through the injury of mischievous Councels, both his Person and
personal Commands are withheld from us: Yet his Honor, his Happiness, his
Posterity, his great Council, and the welfare of his Kingdoms, call
importunately to us for this timely interposing. So that unless we can (which
God forbid) blot out of our thoughts the sense of Piety and Religion toward
God, of Honor and duty toward our Sovereign, and of Gratitude toward the
Parliament and Kingdom of England, we can in no wise resist our present Call
to this undertaking.

And lastly, for what concerns the manner of the pursuance of this just Cause
and lawful Calling: Although the many frustrate Petitions and Remonstrances
from both Kingdoms presented to his Majesty, have left us onley this way, which
yet is not intended against his Majesty's Person, not any of his good Subjects,
but those Enemies of the King and Kingdoms, and whom no other means can
prevailed Yet we shall diligently endeavor so to order the Affairs of our
Army, that all Insolences, Rapines, Plunderings, and those other calamities
that usually attend upon War, may be prevented. And herein as with no small
content to our selves, so with no less satisfaction to you, are we able to
refer you to the experience of out former Expedition (when our own necessity
drove us into England; as now yours do call us) to consider how little damage
was occasioned by out means, how little disorder was committed by us in any
place where we came: And we hereby promise the like care and diligence shall be
renewed, and if possible doubled to that effect.

And that we may not be looked with the prejudice of Strangers, which we hope
the firm Union of this mutual Covenant will wear out, There is a Committee
of your own Nation, the most of which are Parliament men, such to whom you
have committed the trust and care of your Religion, Laws and Liberties, joined
with us, without whose concurrence nothing that concerns you is to be
transacted. And to free you of all unjust suspicion, which if your minds are
not ready to conceive, yet the malicious mouths of our Adversaries and yours
are ready to suggest, That notwithstanding this Declaration, we have some
sinister and secret ends which may prove prejudicial to your Rights and
happiness: Be it hereby made known unto you, that we have freely engaged our
selves, by an Article of the late Treaty betwixt the Nations, to give the
public Faith of the Kingdom of Scotland unto the Kingdom of England, that
neither our entrance into, not continuance in that Kingdom, shall be made use
of to any other ends then expressed in the Covenant, and that Treaty subscribed
to us by the Commissioners of both Kingdoms, which we are resolved, to the
honor of God and of this Nation, to keep inviolate.

And as our Friends and Brethren may look for actions conform to the
expressions of this Declaration, so must the Malignants and implacable orposers
of the ends declared in our Covenant, expect nothing but an impartial and
vigorous prosecution of the same: In which, if any evil befall them, we are
confident that the judgment of wise and indifferent men will reduce it to
themselves, as the wilful Authors thereof.

And finally we declare against all false and artificial relations) that we
are so far from desiring harm or loss to any of our Brethren of England,
that our sincere and real intentions are not to add fuel, not bring oil,
but water to extinguish these lamentable combustions and fires, which we have
with so much duty and love labored to quench: That our taking of Arms is not
to make Wars (if we be not necessitated) but to obtain a better grounded and a
more durable Peace, for enjoying of our Religion and Liberties in all the three
Kingdoms: And that the wicked (who are the unworthy authors of all our
troubles) being removed from our King, a right understanding may be established
betwixt his Majesty and his people. And as we have solemnly sworn to protect
and defend all who shall enter in, and adhere to this Covenant: So do we
certainly expect, that all our Brethren in England, who are zealous for the
true Protestant Religion, loyal to the King and faithful for their Country,
will join and concur with us in the most noble and just ways of procuring
these just desires: Which being obtained, we shall be most willing and ready to
return to our native Country esteeming it our greatest happiness, that truth
with Peace may be established in all His Majesty's Dominions.
