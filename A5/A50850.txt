A VVONDER of WONDERS;
BEING A true Relation of the strange and invisible Beating of a Drum, at the
house of John Mompess^n, Esquire, at Tidcomb in the County of Wiltshire, being
about eight of the Clock at night, and continuing till four in the morning,
several days one after another, to the great admiration of many persons of
Honor, Gentlemen of quality, and many hundreds* who have gone from several
parts to hear this miraculous Wonder, since the first time it b^gan to beat
Roundheads and Cuckolds, come dig, come dig. Also the burning of a Drum that
was taken from a Drummer: Likewise the manner how the Stools and Chair^ danced
about the Rooms. The Drummer is sent to Gloucester Gaol: Likewise a g^^a^
Conflict betwixt the ^vil Spirit and Anthony a lusty Country fellow.

To the tune of, Br^gandary.


ALl you that fear the God on high
amend your lives and repent,
These latter days show Dooms-days nigh
such wonders strange are sent.
Of a strange Wonder shall you hear
at Tidcomb within fair Wilt-shire.
O news, notable news,
ye never the like did hear.
Of a Drummer his use was so
at great Houses for to beat,
He to one certain house did go
and entered in at Gate:
At the house of Master Mompesson
he began aloud to beat his Drum.
O news, notable news,
ye never the like did hear.
Alarm, March, and Troop likewise
he thundered at the Gate,
The Children frighted at the noise
forwarned he was to beat:
But he refused, and his Drum did rattle
as if he had bin in some battle.
O news, notable news,
ye never the like did hear.
HE said he would not be forbid,
neither by his bick nor brall,
And had power for what he did,
they did him Rascal call:
No Sir* I am no such quoth he
two Justices hands in my P^sse be.
O news, notable news,
ye never the like did hear.
'Twas counterfeit he did understand,
and then without delay,
He gave his Servants then command
to set this fellow away,
And likewise took away his Drum,
this you will repent the time will come.
O news, notable news,
ye never the like did hear.
About ^ight a clock that present night
a Drum beat in every Room
Which put them in amaze or fright,
not knowing how it did come:
The first it beat was this old Iig,
Roundheads and Cuckolds come dig, come dig.
O Wonders, notable wonders,
ye never the like did hear.
From eight till four in the morn
with a rattling thundering noise
The echo as loud as a Horn,
and frights them many ways,
To appeal the noise I understand
they burned the Drum out of hand.
O wonders, notable wonders,
ye never the like did hear.
But still about the same time
this noise continued,
Yet little hurt they did sustain
but Children thrown from bed,
And then by the hair of the head
they were plucked quite out of bed.
O wonders, notable wonders,
ye never the like did hear.
From one Room to another were they
tossed by a hellish Fiend,
As if he would them quite destroy
or make of them an end,
And t^en some ease after their pain
They Would be placed in their beds again.
O wonders, notable wonders,
ye never the like did hear.
The Gentleman did give command
to have the Children away
Unto a friends house out of hand
them safely to convey:
What ever they did it made them wonder
a rattling Drum was heard like thunder.
O wonders, notable wonders,
ye never the like did hear.
A Minister being devout at prayer
unto the God on high,
A bed-staff was thrown at him there
with bitter vehemence,
He said the Son of God appear
to destroy the works of Satan here.
O wonders, notable wond^rs,
ye never the like did hear.
There Is one they call him Anthony
that carried a Sword to bed,
And the Spirit at him will fly,
hard to be resisted,
If his hand out of the bed he cast,
the Spirit will unto it fast.
O wonders, notable wonders,
ye never the like did hear.
Both Rooms, Stables, and Orchard groun^
a Drum was heard to b^at.
And sometimes in the Chymney sound
by night make Cattle sweat,
Both Chears and Stools about would gig
and often times would dance a Iig.
O wonders, notable wonders,
ye never the like did hear.
So powerful were these motions all
by Satan sure appointed,
The Chamber floor would rise and fall
and never a board disjoynted:
Then they heard a show from high
three times a witch a witch did cry.
O wonders, notable wonders,
ye never the like did hear.
