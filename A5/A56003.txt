A Proper New Brummigham Ballad
to the Tune of Hey then up go we
KNow now my Brethren Heaven is clear
And all the Clouds are gone
The Righteous now shall flourish
And good days are coming on
Come now my brethren and be glad
And eke rejoice with me
Lawn sleeves and Rochetts shall go down
And hey then up go we.
We Will break the windows which the Whore
Of Babylon has painted
And then when Popish Saints are down
The Brownists shall be Sainted:
There'ss neither Cross nor Crucifix
Shall stand for men to see
Romes Pride and Trumpery shall go down
And hey, etc.
What ever the Popish hands have built
Our hammer shall undo,
We Will break their pipes and burn their caps
And pull down Churches too:
We Will Exercise within the Groves
And teach beneath the Tree
We Will make a Pulpit of a Cart
And hey, etc.
We Will down with Deans and Prebens too
But I rejoice to tell you
How then we will eat Pigg and Goose
And Capon by the belly:
We Will burn our Fathers witty Tombs
And make the Schoolmen flee
We Will down with all that smells of wit
And hey, etc.
We Will down with all the Versities
Where Learning is professed,
Because they practice and maintain
The language of the Beast:
We Will drive the Doctors out of doors
And their Arts where ere they be
We Will down with Arts and Learning both
And hey, etc.
The Ramping Beast amongst the rest
Which are in Churches painted,
The Unicorn you know whose horn
Our Fathers often have dented:
The Crosses in the Lions Crown
As superstitious be
Methinks the times cry pull 'um down
And hey, etc.
The name of Lords shall be abhorred
For every man's a Brother,
No reason why in Church or State
One man shall rule another:
But when the change of Government
Shall set her fingers free
We Will make the wanton Sister stoop
And hey, etc.
And when the Antichristian Crew
Be crushed and overthrown
We Will teach the Nobles how to bow
And keep the Gentry down:
Good manners has an ill report
And turned to pride you see
Therefore we will cry good manners down
And hey, etc.
If that the King and Parliament
Accord not both together
We have more cause to be content
This is our sunshine weather:
But if Reason should take place,
That they should once agree
Woe! would be to the Fanatics case
And hey then down go we.
If Parliaments will give consent
By us for to be guided
Then Protestants they shall not want
What Papists have abided:
They straight to Tyburn shall be drawn,
Where Ketch shall make them free:
But if once we see him cut them down
Then hey etc.
These Protestants who can abide?
They be fools in our conceit,
We Will pull them down on every side
Like Tares amongst the Wheat;
Though they pull up some Romish Weeds
Whereby to set them free,
Yet we will sow our Seditious Seeds;
And hey etc.
What shall we do now in this Case*
Let Us put it to a venture?
If we can hold out seven years space
We Will Sue forth our Indenture;
A time may come to make us Rue,
And time may set us free,
Except the Gallows claim her due.
And hey then up go we.
