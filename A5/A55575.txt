TO THE READER.
THIS Treatise though small in bulk, yet may be of more use then the many great
Volumes of controversy wherewith the Press and the World have so many years
been tired.

The method is very plain and familiar, by way of Dialgue, though it is
sometimes much abused, yet may be managed to the profit and benefit of the
Reader, as I hope this is, which is intended for the use of honest plain
hearted Christians, to show them almost all (in the words of Jesus Christ
himself) his exceeding willingness to save and help poor humble repenting and
returning Sinners, as also his rejecting and casting off, of proud, self
conceited, and self-righteous Pharisees and Hypocrites, who having never been
sensible of the exceeding sinfulness of Sin, do therefore never understand the
absolute necessity of a Savior: if any poor Soul receive the least spiritual
advantage by it, I have my end in this publication.

V.P.

Divine Love; Discovered in Three Dialogues, 1. Between Christ and a Publican.
2. Between Christ and a Pharisee: 3. Between Christ and a doubting Christian.

The first between Christ and a Publican.
IN the great day of the Feast, Jesus stood, and cried, saying, if any man
thirst, let him come to me, Joh. 7.31. Then drew near all the Publicans and
Sinners for to hear him, Luke 15.1. And he said unto one of them.

Jesus, Poor Publican, what makes thee draw near to me?


Publican, Because they say (Lord) that thou art a friend of Publicans and
Sinners, Mat. 11.19.


J. So I am, and thou art Welcome my beloved friend, sit down therefore with
me, and my Disciples, Mat. 9.10.


P. Good Master, though I am unworthy to come into thy presence, yet through
thy leave, I Will sit here at thy feet, to hear thy gracious words, Mark 7.25.
Luke 10.39. John 12.3.


J. How know thou that my words are gracious?


P. Lord I have heard thee say, that Publicans and Harlots shall enter into the
Kingdom of Heaven before the Pharisees which think themselves far better than
us, Mat. 21.31. Luke 18.11, 12.


J. And what say the Pharisees to that?


P. They murmur among themselves, and say, This man receives sinners, and
eats with them, Luke 15.2.


J. Did thou ever hear ine Preach besides that time?


P. Yes, once besides, and it was the best, and comfortablest Sermon that ever
I heard.


J. Do thou remember any of it?


P. Yes, (though I have a bad memory, yet) I remember thou did say, if a man
had a hundred sheep and did loose one of them, he would leave the ninety and
nine in the Wilderness, and go after that which was lost, until he find it; and
when he had found it, he says it on his shoulders rejoicing, and when he
comes home, he calls together his friends, and neighbors, saying unto them,
rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep that was lost.


J. Is that all thou do remember?


P. No, I remember somewhat more, that thou did speak of a woman, that had
ten pieces of Silver, and when she had lost one piece, she sought for it till
she had found it, and then called her neighbors together to rejoice with her.
Also thou speak of a man that had two Sons, the one that lived still at
home, and was obedient to his Father, the other that went away from his Father,
and spent his Fathers means among harlots, till he came to Poverty; and yet
when he returned to his Father, his Father did receive him willingly, and made
him great welcome, and entertainment.


J. Well done my friend, thou have well remembered; but do thou know why I
speak these comparisons?


P. No Sir, I do not well know that.


J. It was to comfort, and encourage the Publicans and great sinners, that did
here me, and to silence the Jews that did murmur, because they came to hear me,
and because I received them.


P. It is true Lord, there were many of us there then, but we did not know what
thou did mean by the lost sheep, the lost piece, and the wicked Son.


J. I did mean thy Countrymen, and Companions, the Publicans, Harlots, and
Sinuers, that are in a lost condition, because of your Sins, and Wickedness in
the Eyes of others (as the Pharisees) quite lost, and adjudged to perish for
ever.


P. But who was it Lord that did seek for the Lost sheep, and the Lost piece of
Silver?


J. It was I, who am the Savior of Sinners, and the Shepherd of the sheep,
that am come to seek and to save that which is lost, Luke 19.10. Mat. 18.11.


P. Lord I am one of those that are lost, what shall I do to be saved? Act.
16.31.


J. I am the way, and the door, if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and
whosoever believes on me, shall not perish, but have everlasting life, Joh.
14.6. and 10.9. and 3.15.16.


P. Lord can thou save such a Sinner as I am?


J. Yes, I have power to save, and Power to destroy, but I came not to destroy
Greek, (...), the Souls of men.
men's lives, but to Save them, Jam. 4.12. Luke 9.56.


P. And art thou willing, Lord, that I should be saved?


J. Yes, I am willing that all should be saved, and come to the knowledge of the
truth, 1 Timothy 2.5.


P. But, Lord, I am a wicked and a sinful man, Luke 5.8.


J. I know (dear Soul) thou art so; But, I came not to call the Righteous; but
Sinners to Repentance, Mat. 9.13.


P. But, Lord, I am not an ordinary, but an extraordinary Sinner.


J. Notwithstanding, poor man, hearken for thy comfort, there was a certain
Creditor, that had two Debtors, the one owed five hundred pence, and the other
fifty; and when they had nothing to pay, he freely forgave them both, Luke
7.41, 42.


P. But, Lord, I am a greater Sinner then either of them both, for I have
nothing but Sinned all my Life time.


J. What though, I am come to deliver those that were all their life time
subject to Or the bondage of Sin.
Bondage, Heb. 2.15.


P. Lord be merciful to me being a Sinner, for I think there is not a greater
sinner upon earth then I am, Luke 18.13.


J. I am merciful, and I will be merciful, and will pardon thy Sins, Jer. 3.12.
Heb. 8.12.


P. Lord, I am such a Sinner, I deserve no pardon, for I have wearied thee with
my Sins.


J. Though thou do not deserve pardon, and though thou have wearied me with
thy Sins, yet I will pardon thy iniquities for my own names sake, Esa. 43.25.


P. Lord, I do think my Sins are so great, that it is impossible for them to be
pardoned.


J. Do not think or say so, for all things are possible to him that believes,
Mark 9.23.


P. But my Sins are so red, I think all the Water in the Sea cannot wash them
away.


J. Though thy Sins be as Scarlet, they shall be as white as Snow, and though
they be red like Crimson, they shall be as Wool, (if thou will turn to me from
them) for my Blood can cleanse thee from all Sin, Esa. 1.18. 1 John 1.7.


P. But Lord, if I should turn to thee from them, yet they are written down and
thou will not blot them out, Jer. 18.23.


J. I am he that bloteth out thy transgressions, yea, have bloted out as a
thick cloud thy transgressions, and as a Cloud thy Sins; return therefore unto
me, for I have redeemed thee, Esa. 43.25. and 44.22.


P. But if I should return unto thee, yet when I Sin again, thou will remember
my Sins.


J. No, I will pardon thee, and thy Sins and iniquities will I remember no
more, Heb. 10.17.


P. Oh Lord! I am the child of wicked parents, and thou have said, thou will
visit the Sins of the Father, upon the Children, to the third and fourth
generation.


J. If a wicked Father begets a Son, that sees all his Fathers Sins which he
has done, and considers and does not such like; that Son shall not bare the
iniquity of the Father; Ezekiel. 18.14.20. Ezekiel. 16.3. to the 13.


P. But Lord were there any wicked parents that had good Children?


J. Yes, many, as wicked (a) Ahaz had good Hezekiah; So (b) Idolutrous Amon,
zealous Josiah, and ungodly Saul, had Godly Jonathan. (a) 2 Kin. 16.20. with 2
Kin. 18.3 (b) 2 Kin. 21.21, 22. with 2 King. 22, 2.


P. Lord, what if I be a Bastard, and the Child of whoredom?


J. That does not hinder thee neither to be saved, for my servant (c) Jeptha
was a Bastard; so was my servant Phares who is reckoned in my own Genealogy.
Compare Genesis 38.18. and 29. and Ruth 4.12. with Mat. 1.3. (c) Jud. 11.1. with
Heb. 11.32.


P. But Lord, is there not such a Scripture, that a Bastard shall not enter
into thy Congregation until the tenth Generation.


J. Yes there is such a (d) Scripture, and that should make People shun the Sin
of Whoredom, but that does not exclude men that are born Bastards after the
Flesh, if they be Born again of the Spirit, either out of my Church on Earth,
(now in the days of the Gospel) or yet out of Heaven, Deuteronomy. 23.2.


P. But what Lord, if my Father was a Bastard?


J. Neither does that hinder, for Sarah the brother of Phares (who was a
Bastard) begot my two wise and Godly Servants Ethan and Heman, compare Genesis
38.30. 1 Chronicles. 26. with Psalm. 88. and Psalm. 89. the titles of both being of
Heman, and Ethan.


P. Oh Lord, I am a very old Sinner, and have one foot already in the Grave,
and I fear it is too late for me now to be called.


J. No, it is not too late, for I call some at the ninth hour, yea some at the
(e) eleventh hour. Which is but one hour before night, or a little before death.
And I will pour out of my Spirit upon old men in these Gospel days, Mat.
20.6.9. Joel 2.28. with Act. 2.17.


P. But Lord, I have committed such great and heinous Sins, both by speaking
and doing, that I am afraid it is in vain for me to seek Mercy.


J. Though thou have spoken, and done evil things, as much as thou could,
yet return unto me, and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon thee, for I am
merciful, Jer. 3.5.


P. How shall I look upon thee, Gracious Lord, for I have multiplied sins
against thee.


J. As thou have multiplied sin, so will I Or will abundantly pardon.
multiply pardons, if thou will return unto me the Lord, Esa. 55.7.


P. Oh but Lord, I scarce think that any so wicked as my self were saved, for I
was an Idolater, an Adulterer, a Thief, a Drunkard, and what not that was
wicked.


J. Such were many of my servants that are now in heaven, but I according to my
own kindness, and pity to them, saved them by washing, sanctifying and
justifying them, by my own Or power
Name, Blood, and Spirit, 1 Cor. 9.6, 9, 10, 11. Tit. 3.3, 4, 5, 6, 7.


P. Oh but merciful Savior, I was a Ringleader of others into sin, and I
enticed, and drew many into wickedness, and therefore my case is far worse then
others.


J. As thou wast a Ringleader, and Enticer of others into sin, so I can make
thee a guide and leader of others into, and in the way of righteousness, as I
made thy Countryman Levi and others.


P. But that which makes me fear most, is because I was a Blasphemer, Reviler,
and Persecuter of thy people, yea many of thy Saints, did I shut up in Prison.


J. Yet thou shall have mercy, because thou did it ignorantly, through
unbelief, 1 Timothy 1.13.


P. Oh but Lord, I find my heart is hardened, through the deceitfulness and
custom of sin, that I cannot hope it will ever be otherwise.


J. I can and will take the stony heart out of thy flesh, and I will give thee
a heart of flesh, Eze. 36.26.


P. Lord will thou do all for me?


J. I must do all for thee, for without me thou can do nothing, Phil. 2.13.
Joh. 15.5.


P Lord, what then shall I do?


J. Before I teach thee what thou must do, I will first show thee, what I have
done, and suffered for thee.


P. Good Master I desire to know that.


J. 1. I left my own glory, and came into the world to save thee, and such
sinners as thou art, John 17.5. 1 Timothy 1.15.

2. Though I was the only Son of my Father, and in his own form, and equal to
him; yet I took upon me the form of a servant, for thee and thy brethrens sake,
Joh. 1.14. Phil. 2.6, 7, 8.

3. Though I was Heir of all things, and Possessor of Heaven and Earth, yet I
became poor and hungary, that thou might be made rich, Heb. 1.2. Genesis 14.19.
and 2 Cor. 8.9.

4. Though I deserved honor, and glory; yet I was reviled, threatened, and
perscuted by my own Creatures, and all for my good will to thee, Heb. 2.9. 1
Pet. 2.23.

5. Though I had no sin, yet I was made sin that thou poor sinner might
escape sin, 1 Pet. 1.19. and 2.22. 2 Cor. 1.21.

6. Though I was a Lawgiver, and Lawmakers, yet I became under the curse of my
own Law, that I might redeem thee from that curse, Esa. 33.22. Gal. 3.13.

7. When I had power over mine own life, and no man could take it from me, yet
I laid it down for thee, that thou might have life, Joh. 10.18. Romans 5.6.9.
1 John 3.16.

8. Though I was my fathers delight, and an object of his love from
everlasting, yet I became an object of his wrath, for my love to thee, Prove.
8.30. Psa. 88.16. and 102.10.

9. When thou wast an enemy, and stranger to God my Father, I made peace
between him and thee, and reconciled thee to him by my death, and sufferings,
Romans 5.10. Col. 1.20.21. Ephesians. 2.12, 13.

10. When thou were a slave to the Devil, and a firebrand of Hell; I did
rescue thee from the power of the one, and redeem thee from the plague and
punnishment of the other, 2 Timothy 2.25. Amos. 4.11. Heb. 2.14. 1 These. 1.10.


P. Oh Lord I did not deserve any of this from thee.


J. True thou did not deserve it, but yet I did it freely, and out of my love
to thee, Romans 3.24. Ephesians. 5.2.


P. Are all my sins, Lord, satisfied for, and done a way by thy death.


J. Yes, they are perfectly satisfied for, and absolutely done away out of my
fathers sight, never to be imputed again to thee, 2 Cor. 5.19.


P. And is there nothing now in the way that hinders me to be saved?


J. No, there is nothing, for I have taken all things out of the way, that
hindered thee to be saved, Col. 2.14.


P. And am I to do nothing to be saved?


J. No nothing at all toward thy own salvation, for I have bought thee from
death, and purchased thee life, and salvation, 1 Cor. 6.20. 1 Pet. 1.18, 19.
Ephesians. 1.14.


P. Shall I then be saved Lord?


J. Yes, if thou will believe, and trust wholly and only upon me, and upon my
righteousness and merits, thou shall be saved, Joh. 3.36. Romans 9.33. and Romans
10.9.11.


P. Lord I would believe, but I partly am afraid to believe; and partly I am so
weak I cannot believe.


J. Thou poor fearful heart, fear not, but be strong, Esa. 35.4. But tell me
why thou are afaid.


P. Least I should presume, or least I should believe, and have no ground for
my faith.


J. It is not presumption for thee to do what I command thee, but it is
obedience, and is not my word of promise a sufficient ground for thy faith? 1 John 3.23. Joh. 5.24.


P. Do thou then Lord command me to believe?


J. Yes, fear not, believe on me, and thou shall be saved, Lu. 8.50. with Act.
16.31.


P. But Lord though thou command me, yet I have no power to believe.


J. I will write my Laws in thy heart, and will enable and give thee power to
believe, Heb. 8.10. Mat. 12.21.


P. Lord if thou will also give me power to believe, I will acknowledge I am
nothing, but what I am in thee; and that I have nothing, but what I have
received from thee.


J. Do thou not believe?


P. Oh yes, now Lord I do believe, Joh. 9.38.


J. This is the work and gift of God that thou do believe; for flesh and
blood has not wrought this in thee, Joh. 6.29. Ephesians. 2.8.


P. Oh Lord, I do acknowledge it to be thy work, but I am afraid I shall loose
this faith again.


J. I that am the Author of thy faith, will also finish it: be therefore of
good cheer, for thou art one of my Fathers children, and of my Saints, and my
spirit shall abide in thee for ever, Heb. 12.2. Joh. 1.12. Joh. 4.14. John
7.38, 39.


P. Lord I have sinned against thy Father, and against thee, and I am unworthy
to be called either his Son or thy Servant, Luke 15.21.


J. Son thy sins are forgiven thee, sin no more, Luke 5.23. John 8.11.


P. Lord I am afraid I shall sin again, though I desire, and resolve never to
do it. But what Lord, if I should sin against my will?


J. Thou can not sin willingly and wilfully; for my seed of grace will remain
in thee, and if thou sinnest through weakeness, and frailty, I will be an
Advocate, propitiation for thy sins, 1 John 3.9. 1 John 2.12.


P. Is it then thy will Lord, that I should have forgiveness of my sins, and
doubt no more?


J. Yes sure, for these things have I spoken, that thou should have a full
assurance, and doubt no more.


P. But what if Satan, when he sees me sin, will tempt me to doubt again?


J. Say unto him, that I am faithful and just to forgive thee thy sins, and
that my blood cleanses thee from all sin, 1 John 17.


P. But Lord wilt not thou have me to confess my sins?


J. Yes, I will have thee confess them, and forsake them, 1 John 1.9. Prove.
28.13.


P. But Lord, is it thy mind, that I should always be sorrowful?


J. No, but it is my mind, rather that thou should always rejoice, and have
strong consolation, Phil. 4.4. Heb. 6.18.


P. Oh Lord, I cannot choose but cry, and mourn, and be ashamed, and hate my
self for all my former wickedness, and ungodliness Ezekiel. 16.61.


J. Thou may do that, and yet hold fast thy confidence; for the spirit of
mourning, and the spirit of grace and adoption, may be in thy heart at once,
and the one not destroy the other, Zac. 12.10.


P. Lord how is that?


J. Thou may mourn at the sight of thy sins, as they were committed against
me, and for thy denying, felling, and crucifying me, and yet thou may
believe (because I have said so) that they are all pardoned. As Joseph's
brethren cried, and complained for their guiltiness in selling him, yet they
were glad that he was alive, and could help them in their distress, Genesis 42.21,
22.


P. Now Lord thou have taught me what I should do in respect of my self, but
now Lord I would do something for thee.


J. Come then and follow me, Mat. 9, 9. And be arose and followed him.


The second Conference between Christ, and a Pharisee.
Pharisee. THen one of the Pharisees came to him, and asked him, what shall I
do to work the work of God, John. 6.28.


Jesus. This is the work of God, that thou believe in him (viz. me) whom he
has sent, Joh. 6.29.


Ph. But Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life, Mat.
19.16.


J. If thou will be saved by doing, then keep the Commandments.


Ph. I have kept them all from my youth, Mat. 19, 20.


J. Then thou art no sinner.


Ph. Yes, we are all sinners; but I thank God I am not as other men are,
Extortioners, Unjust, Adulterers, or even as this Publican, Luke 18.11.


J. Why, what do thou more than this Publican?


Ph. I fast twice in the week, and give tithes of all that I possess, and
concerning the Law, I live blameless, Luke 18.12. Phil. 3.6.


J. Have thou never read that they which followed after the Law of
Righteousness, have not attained to the Law of Righteousness, Romans 9.31.


Ph. No, I never observed that, but I remember another text, where God says, I
gave them my Satutes, and showed them my Judgments, which if a man do, he shall
live in them, Ezekiel. 20.11.


J. Daest thou think to go to heaven by doing?


Ph. Not by doing only, but by doing good, and departing from evil.


J. But does not the Law say, cursed is he that observes not all things that
are written in the words of the Law to do them, Deuteronomy. 27.26.


Ph. Yes, that is, whosoever breaks the Law is accursed, unless he repents for
it.


J. The Law does not say, unless men repent for breaking it they are accursed,
but it says absolutely they are cursed, and I say, whosoever keeps the whole
law and yet offends in one point, he is guilty of all, Gal. 3.10. Jam. 2.10.
Mat. 5.19.


Ph. I say so too, that except men keep the Law of Moses they ( a) cannot be
saved, and whosoever ( b) know not, and keep not the Law, they are accursed.
Acts 15.1.24. Joh. 7.49


J. Do thou know the Law


Ph. Yes, I know the Law for I am instructed daily out of the Law, by our ( c)
Doctors of the Law and holy Priests, ( c) Zeph. 3.4.


J. The Priests have done violence to the Law, and they that (d) handle the Law
know not the Lord, (d) Jer. 2.8.


Ph. Jehovah, has said, that the Law shall not perish from the Priests, for
the Priests lips is to keep knowledge, and we are to seek the Law at his mouth,
Jer. 18: 18. Mal. 2.7.


J God has said also, that the Law shall (c) perish from the Priests, and that
they (f) shall not every man teach his neighbor any more, for all shall know
the Lord, from the least to the greatest, Jer. 31.4.


Ph. I perceive thou go about to destroy the Law.


J. Think not so, for I am not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfill it, Mat.
5.17. Luke 16.17.


Ph. I Sir, I like that, that we should fulfill the Law, that we should perform
it.


J. Yes, Moses gave you the Law, but (a) none of you keeps it, but (b) you
have been partial in the Law. (c) Ye pay tithe of Mint, Annis, and Cumming, and
have omitted the weightier matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and Faith, Joh.
7.19. Mal. 2.9. Mat. 23.23.


P. It is true, we may come shore in some things, but he that keeps the Law
happy is he.


J. Thou that (d) restest in the Law, and make thy boast of the Law, through
breaking the Law thou do dishonor God, and causest many to (f) stumble at
the Law, verily I say unto thee, thou (g) shall be judged by the Law, Romans
2.17. ver. 23. Mal. 2.8. Romans 2.12.


Ph. No, I hope rather to be justified, then to be judged by the Law.


J. Verily, verily, I say unto thee, by the deeds of the Law, there shall no
flesh be justified in God: sight, Romans 3.20^ Gal. 3.11.


Ph. How then shall I be justified?


J. The righteousness of God without the Law is manifest, being witnessed by
the Law and the Prophets, Romans 3.21.


Ph. What Righteousness is that?


J. Not a man's (h) own righteousness, which is called, the (i) righteousness of
the Law; but the (k) righteousness which is of God by faith (h) Phil. 3.9. ( i)
To. 2.26. ( k) To. 4.13.


Ph. What difference is there between the righteousness of the Law, and the
righteousness of faith?


J. Moses describes the righteousness of the Law, thus that the man which does
those things which the Law requires shall live by them; but the righteousness
of faith, says, whosoever believes on me shall be saved, Romans 10.5.6, 11.


Ph. How can men be saved by believing in thee, for thou art but one?


J. As by one (l) man's offense death reigned, by one much m^^^ they which
receive abundance of grace, and of the gi^^ (...) righteousness, shall reign in
life by me. Who am the (m) Son of righteousness, (n) and made by God my Father
to be righteousness unto men. (l) Romans 5.7. ( m) Mal. 4.2. [ n] 1 Cor. 1.30.


Ph. Thou bear record of thy self, Joh. 8.13.


J. [o] Though I bear record of my self, yet my record is true. [p] My Father
also bears witness of me, and this is his witness, that he has given life,
and this life is in [me] his Son. [o] Joh. 8.14. [ p] 1 John 5.11.


Ph. But what say thou, how was our Father Abraham and his seed [who lived
before thee] justified and saved?


J. [q] Your Father Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it, and was
glad, for [l] I was before Abraham and he and his spiritual seed, were
justified and saved by faith in me. ( r) Romans 4.3.11, 13, 16. Gal. 3.14.18.20.


Ph. But was not Abraham justified by works?


J. If Abraham were justified by works, be has whereof to glory, but not
before God; for what says the Scripture, It is true Abraham's faith was
accompanied with works.
Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for Righteousness, Romans
4.2.3.


Ph. If I be not justified by my good works, to what end should I perform them?


J. Though thy good works cannot justify thee before God, yet they may
glorify God, and be prafitable unto men, Mat. 5.16. Tit. 3.8.


Ph. Well then, I am glad my good works be good for something.


J. Yes, thy good works would be good for something, if thy faith like
Abraham's) did work with thy works, but thou do not believe, and all thy good
works thou do to be seen of men, Jam. 2.22. Mat. 23.5.


Ph. No, I do not do my good works to be seen of men, but to please God.


J. I tell thee, that without faith it is impossible to please God, Heb. 11.6.


Ph. But God has said, if a man do well, he shall be accepted.


J. It is not for their welldoing that men are accepted with my Father, but
they are made acceptable in me, and their works are accepted for my sake, Ephesians.
1.6. 1 Pet. 2.6.


Ph. But am I no nearer Heaven, that perform good works, than this finfull and
ungodly Publican?


J. Thou Hypocrite that justifiest thy self, and judge another, I tell thee,
that Publicans and Harlots shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before such
as thou art, Mat. 7.5. and 21, 31.


Ph. Oh untrue, and false doctrine, to say, that those cursed men who know not
the Law, should be saved before us, who are the children of Abraham, Joh. 7.49.
and 8.33.


J. Thou blind, and selfconceited Pharisee, understandest thou not the
Scripture? I will have mercy, and not sacrifice, for I am not come to call the
righteous, but sinners to repentance. And I say unto thee, unless thou do
believe in me, thou art not the child of Abraham, Mat. 9.13. Gal. 3.26.


Ph. I believe in the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,
whose child and servant I am.


J. If thou did believe in God, thou would also believe in me, but thou
art the child of the Devil, and in bondage to this day, Joh. 8.44. Gal. 4.25.


Ph. How am I in bondage?


J. Thou art under the curse of the Law, and under the power of sin and Satan;
and can never be made free, unless I make thee free, Joh. 8.34, 35, 36.


Ph. How do thou free men?


J. By my (a) death and sufferings, I satisfy the Law; by the (b) power of my
resurrection, I overcome death; and by my Spirit I (m) cast out Satan, and (n)
subdue sin, (a) Gal. 3.13. ( b) 1 Cor. 15.55.57. ( m) Mat 12.28. ( n) Romans 8.2.


Ph. Sir, I hope to be freed another way, to wit, by my sacrifices, prayers,
and good works.


J. Thy sacrifices and thy prayers, are an abomination unto me, and thy works
are not found perfect before God, Esa. 66.3. Prove. 15.8. and 28.9. Rev. 3.2.


Ph. What do thou think to beat me off from my long prayers, and good works?
I hope by these, together with my fasting, and mourning, to lay a sure, and
happy foundation for my soul, for ever.


J. Thou worker of iniquity, that do (a) practice bypocrisie, I tell thee thy
prayers are (b) sin, thy works are done to be seen of men; thou also fastest
for (c) strife, and thy mourning is but hypocritical: therefore instead of
laying a sure and happy foundation, thou (d) heapest up wrath to thy self,
against the day of wrath, ( a) Esa. 32.6. ( b) Ps. 109.7. ( c) Es. 58.4.5. ( d)
Job. 36.13.


Ph. Sir, I am not a hypocrite, but a true child of God, and I hope I shall
belived, for I know most good men take me for a godly and righteous man.


J. Though thou do cutwardly (e) appear righteous unto men, yet within thou
art full of hypocrisy and iniquity; thou seed of the Serpent, thy (f) hope
will perish, for thou can not (g) escape the damnation of hell, ( e) Mat.
23.28. ( f) Job. 8.13. ( g) Mat. 23.33.


Ph. I do not fear what thou say, for I am better persuaded of my self.


J. Though thy scared conscience, and hardened heart hinders the yet from
fearing; yet fear, terror, and trembling shall (h) surprise, and fill thy
spirit, that thou shall roar in (i) flame; of fire, and in everlasting
burnings, ( h) Es. 33.14. Deuteronomy. 32.22. ( i) Luke 3.17. Mark. 9.43.44, 46.


Ph. I have joy and comfort in my spirit often from my performances, and I know
that God will hear my prayers, that I make publicly and privately unto him.


J. Thou painted Sepulcher, bast thou not read! that the (k) joy of an
hypacrite is but for a moment ^ and that an hypocrite shall not (l) come before
God, And do thou not (m) restrain prayer before God; and when thou praye^t,
do thou not do it publicly to be (n) seen of men? (k) Job. 20.5 ( l) Job.
13.16. ( m) Job. 15.4. ( n) Mat. 6.5.


Ph. I pray in private also.


J. Then it is either when (o) some punishment is upon thee, or else to quiet
thy carnal conscience, (s) Esa 26.16.


Ph. Mr. why do thou reproach me in saying thus?


J. Thou dissembler that (p) seek honor of men, and not the honor which
comes from God: thou art to expect nothing but shame, and (q) everlasting
contempt. (p) Joh. 5.44. ( q) Dan. 12.2.


Ph. Sir, thou judge rashly.


J. No, as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just and true, Joh. 5.30. and
8.16.26.


Ph. How know thou what I am, that thou so judge?


J. I am he that searches the heart and tries the reins, and I will give to
every one of you according to your works, Rev. 2.23.


Ph. When thou judge the world, what difference will thou make between us
that serve God, and the Heathens that served him not?


J. The difference will be this, that your [r] condemnation will be the
greater, because, though ye know God, yet ye served him [s] vainly, falsely, and
[t] hypocritically. (r) Mat. 23.14. Mar. 12.40. Luke 20.47. (s) Mat. 15.9. (t)
Esa. 57.4.


Ph. Good Master, I would escape this condemnation, for I believe it will be
great, and thy words begin to terrify me already.


J. I have told thee already, that there is no other way for thee to escape it,
but only by me, but yet thou do not believe me, Joh. 10.25.


Ph. How will thou have me believe in thee?


J. First, I will have thee see thy self to be the (v) greatest and vilest of
sinners, and then (...) thy [u] own righteousness, service, and performances,
to be as filthy and me^^ruous rags: And after thou have denied and (w) abhorred
thy self, then cry out, Master, save me, or else I perish; for the (x) whole
need not a Physician, but those that are sick, (v) 1 Timothy 1.15. (u) Esa. 64.6
(w) Eze. 36.31. [x] Mat. 9.12.


Ph. I do see my self a sinner, and I am sorry for my sins. And does nor God
say, that whosoever confesses and forsakes his sins shall find mercy.


J. I say unto thee (thou lukewarm Professor) Except thou eatest my flesh, and
drinkest my blood; and submittest unto my righteousness, thou can not be
saved, Joh. 6.53.


Ph. Well then; If I cannot be saved by my own works, and righteousness,
Master, let me be beholding to thee to save me.


J. Have thou not read, that (a) Salvation belongs only to the Lord, and
that men are saved by grace, without the works of the Law; why then do thou
so (b) lightly esteem of the Rock of thy Salvation? by seeking to be justified
and saved (as (c) it were) by thy own works: I tell thee again, thou must (d)
deny thy own righteousness wholly, and look to be found in my righteousness
only, else thou can not be saved (a) Psalm. 3.8. (b) Deuteronomy. 32.15. (c) Romans
9.32 (d) Phil. 3.9.


Ph. Indeed Master, thou make the way to Heaven very hard.


J. It is so hard, that many shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able,
Luke 13.24.


Ph. If it be as thou say. I am afraid that many of our best Scribes and
Pharisees will come short of Heaven.


J. Thou may be sure of that, for verily I say unto thee, Except thy
righteousness, exceeds the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, thou
shall in no ease enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Mat. 5.20.


Ph. But Master, there be some that do great works in thy name, shall not all
such be saved?


J. No, for many will say unto me hereafter, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied
in thy Name, and in thy name cast out devils, and in thy name done many
wonderful things; and then will I profess unto them, I never knew you, depart
from me ye workers of iniquity, Matthew. 7.22.23.


Ph. But why should not such rather be saved then cast away?


J. Because they did [as thou dost] d^ all th^se things to be seen of men, and
to gain honor unto themselves, and s^ built their Salvation upon this false
foundation, as the foolish builder built his house upon the sand, which in i.
e. Times of Trial and persecution. Luke 8.12.
time of flood, and wind, could not ^^and, but fell, Mat. 7.26, 27.


Ph. I see thou do reject me, I thought to be one of thy Disciples, and to
follow thee.


J. No, I do not reject thee, but am very willing to receive thee; but first
consider, what thou do, and what it will cost, thee, if thou will be my
Disciple, and follow me.


Ph. What will it cost me Master?


J. Thou must i. e. In comparison of Christ, and when they come in competition
with him. Mat. 10.37.
hate thy father and mother and wife and Children, and brethren, and sisters,
and thine own life also; yea thou must go, and sell all that thou have, and
take up thy cross daily, and follow me, else thou can not be my Disciple,
Luke 14.26, 27.


Ph. This is a hard saying, who can hear it, and he went away sorrowful, and
followed him no more, Joh. 6.60.66. Mat. 19.22.


The third Conference between Christ, and a doubting Christian.
Christ. COme unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give
you rest, Mat. 11.28.


Christian. Oh Lord I am a poor heavy laden sinner that would come unto thee,
but cannot come.


Chapter It is true O soul, no man can come unto me, except the Father which has
sent me draw him, Joh. 6.44.


Christian, How then Lord shall I come unto thee?


Chapter I and my Father are one, and we give power to the faint, and to them that
have no might, we add strength, Joh. 10.30 Esaias 40, 29.


Christian, Lord, I am altogether without strength therefore draw me unto thee
and I will come.


Chapter I will draw thee unto me with the cords o^ a man, with bands of love and
with loving kindness, Hos. 11.4. Jer. 31.3. Joh. 12.32.


Christian, But Lord no^ I look upon my self, I see I am unworthy to come unto
thee yea, unworthy of the least of thy mercies.


Chapter So said my servant (a) John the Baptist, and (b) Jacob, and (c) others,
yet do not judge thy selse (as the (d) Jews did) unworthy of eternal life, (a)
Mat. 3.11.6. (b) Genesis 32.10. (c) Luke 7.7. Mat. 8.8. (d) Acts 13.46.


Christian, I^ such men as John Baptist, and Jacob did judge themselves
unworthy; how many thousand times more unworthy am I, a wretched and wicked
sinner?


Chapter It is true, neither they, nor thou, could be worthy of your selves, but
yet I am willing to account you worthy, As the prodigals Father did his Son,
Luke 15.21, 22.
Luke 20.35. and 21.36, Rev. 3.4.


Christi. But Lord, if ther^ were any thing that were good in me, it might a
little encourage me to come unto thee, but I find nothing but evil in me.


Chapter Do thou not know^ that without me thou can (e) do nothing; and that a
man can (f) receive nothing, except it be give^ him from heaven. Why the^ do
thou stay away from me who must (g) work all thy works in thee And, (c) Joh.
15.5. (f) Joh. 3.27. (g) Esa. 26.12 2, 12.

2. Because thou see nothing but evil in thee, thou should thee rather come
unto me, who am the (h) Fountain wherein thy unclean soul must be washed; and
unless I (i) wash thee thou can not be clean, nor have any (k) part in me,
(h) Zac 13.1. (i) Eze. 36.25. and 1.9. (k) Joh. 13.8.


Christian, True Lord, thou art the Fountain and welspring of life, and it is
thy blood (and nothing else) that can wash a way my sins: but how can I come
near to thee, who am so wicked, that for ^ught I know, have counted thy blood
an (l) unholy thing, (l) Heb. 10.29.


Chapter Thou poor, dear, and doubting soul, what if thou had had a hand in
crucifying me (as the Jews had?) yet cannot I forgive thee, as I did many of
them. But thou have not counted my blood an unholy thing, for thou still
desire to have thy sins washed away by it, Act. 2.36.41.


Christian, What the Jews did, they did ignorantly; but I have sinned against
knowledge, which makes my sins worse then theirs.


Chapter If thou have sinned against knowledge, ye thou have not sinned so but that
thou may be forgiven: For my dear Disciple Peter sinned against knowledge,
when he denied with an oath that he knew me not, Mat. 26.72.


Christian, Oh but yet my sins are worse then his, for his sin was but one sin,
and that a sudden and short sin; but I have sinned many sins and continued
long in them.


Chapter So did my beloved servant David (who was a man according to my own heart)
commit several sins together, as Murder, Whoredom, etc. and continued a while
too in his sins.


Christian, Oh but Lord, those servants of thine though they sinned against
thee yet they expressed a great deal of sense of their sins, and sorrow for
them; but I can neither be sensible of, nor sorrowful for mine.


Chapter Oh sweet soul, thou mistakest, and forgettest thy self, for thou do
often confess thy sins before me with sense, shame, and sorrow. And I hear the
daily bemoaning, and complaining, and saying, I have (n) sinned against the
Lord, woe is me for I am undone, (n) Job. 7 20. Psalm. 51.4. Lam. 5.16.


Christian, Oh good Lord, it is not without a cause that I cry woe is me I am
undone; for I think there is no soul in such a dangerous, and desperate
condition, as mine is in.


Chapter Why do thou think, and say so?


Christian, Because I have sinned that unpardonable sin against thy spirit.


Chapter Oh thou poor and precious soul, thou do but think so, and fear so: But
tell me how can thou sin that sin against my Spirit, and yet pray for more of
my Spirit, and so much prize my Spirit as thou do?


Christian, Oh Lord, I have often grieved and quenched thy Spirit, and is not
this to commit that unpardonable sin?


Chapter My own dear and loving children may and do sometimes grieve my spirit by
sining and quench the gracious motions of it and yet do not sin that
unpardonable sin, Ephesians. 4.30. 1 These. 5.19. Esaias 63.10.


Christian, Oh but I can ^^^nk no less, but that I have ^^^^^red that sin, for
I have had hard, cruel and desperate thoughts in my heart, against the Holy
Spirit.


Chapter Though (my child) tho^ have had such thoughts in thy (...), yet thou have
no^ ^^oken evil of my Spirit (as the Jews did) which is the sin of blasphemy,
and that unpardonable sin, Mat. 12.24, 28, 31. Mark. 3.22, to 30.


Christian, Lord I am not sure but that I have spoken evil words of thy spirit;
for I know I have many times uttered vile, bitter, and cursed words.


Chapter Notwithstanding, thou did through the violence of thy temptations and
in the bitterness of thy Soul speak such words (as my servants Job, David,
Jeremy, Jonah, and Peter did) yet thou have not done despightfully (nor sinned
maliciously and wilfully) against my Spirit of grace as Reprobates do, Heb.
10.29. Job. 3. to 13. and 10.18. and 23.15, 16. Psa. 31.22. and 116.11. Jer.
20.14, etc. Jonah. 4.3, 4, 9. Mat. 26, 27, 74.


Christian, Oh I have been and still am very wilful, and have often sinned
wilfully, and thou say in thy word, that if any sin wilfully after they
receive the knowledge of the truth their remains no more sacrifice for sins,
Heb. 10.6.


Chapter Thou dear soul, have not I heard thee often in prayer complaining of, and
bewailing thy sins, and beging earnestly for power against them; therefore it
is rather against thy will (then wilfully) that thou do sin.


Christian, Oh but I find sins in power in my soul, which if I were a Saint
they would not be so.


Chapter My servant Paul found sin so strong in him that he confessed he was
carnal, Sin was in power in Paul when it could carry him captive.
and sold under sin; and that he found a law in his members, warring against
the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of sin, Romans
14.23.


Christian, Oh but neither Paul nor any other Saint, has sinned presumptuously
as I have done.


Chapter My servant David prayed, that he might be kept from presumptuous sins, for
he was subject thereunto, Ps. 19.13. It is probable that David sined
presumptuously in kiling Vriah.
and so are the best of my Saints.


Christi. But Lord I have rebelled against thee.


Chapter So did my servants of old, but I have received gifts for the Rebellious,
and to me belongs mercies and forgiveness, though thou have rebelled against
me, Dan. 9 9 Is. 1.2. and 63.20. Is 68.18.


Christian, Oh but my Rebellion is the worst Rebellion of all, for I have
rebelled against the light; I have professed thee, and yet I have belied thee,
and made an hypocritical profession; I seemed like Judas, to be thy friend,
whilst in my heart I did not love thee.


Chapter The house of Israel and the house of Judah dealt treacherously against me
the Lord, and belied me, and Ephraim my dear Son, compassed me about with lies,
yet was I gracious to them, Jer. 5.11.12. Hos. 11.12. with Jer. 23.6. and 31.20.


Christian, But Lord, Ephraim was never so wicked as I am, and guilty of such
Lukewarmness, Hypocrisy and Backsliding as I am guilty of.


Chapter Yea, Ephraim was a cake not turned. And Ephraim fed upon winds and
provoked me to anger most bitterly, yet my bowels did still work toward
Ephraim, that I could not destroy him Hos. 8.8. and 12.1.14. with 11.8.


Christian, But I increased in sin, and the more mercies I received, the more
my heart was exalted.


Chapter Even so did Ephraim sin more and more, according as he was filled, so his
heart was exalted, Hos. 13.2, 6.


Christian, But Lord what did thou do to Ephraim?


Chapter I drew them with the cords of man, and with bands of love, and I was as
the dew unto them, Heb. 11.4. and 14.5.


Christian, Oh but I have forsaken the Lord, and backslided from thee.


Chapter So did Israel and Judah, Jer. 2, 13. and 3.6. and 4.16.


Christian, But Lord I find that my heart is bent to continual backsliding,
yea, my bakslidings are increased.


Chapter So were they yet I healed their backslidings, so will I heal thine also,
Hos. 14.4. Jer. 3.14.22. Hos. 11.7. Jer. 5.6.


Christian, But I have fell into gross sins that has dishonored thee, and
caused thine enemies to blaspheme.


Chapter So did my servant David, 2 Samuel 12.14. and others of my Saints.


Christian, I but then he did mourn and repent greatly for his sins, but I
cannot do so, for I find my heart as hard as an Adamant.


Chapter So my people Isreal's hearts formerly were as hard as a Rock, Adamant, and
Flint, Jer. 5.3. Ezekiel. 3.9.


Christian, Oh but I have been long (yea ever) troubled with this hardness of
heart.


Chapter Though thou have, yet I will take the stony heart out of thy flesh, and I
will give thee a heart of flesh, Ezekiel. 36.26.


Christian, But I cannot repent me of the hardness of my heart.


Chapter What though, yet I am exalted to give repentance unto thee, Act. 5.31.


Christian, Oh but I do not find that I am sensible enough of my sin; for if I
were I should mourn, and be ashamed for all the wickedness which I have
committed against thee.


Chapter When thou do see me whom thou have pierced, and when thou see that I
am pacified toward thee; then thou shall mourn, loath thy self, and be
ashamed, for all thy sins and abominations which thou have committed against
me, Rev. 1.7. Ezekiel. 6.9. and 16.63.


Christian, But Lord I am a very great sinner, and I would fain see the nature
and number of my sins, that I might truly repent me of them, and be humbled for
them.


Chapter If thou see all thy sins with their nature, number, and aggravations, thou
could never look upon them, but with despair as Cain and Judas. And it is not
so much the sight of sin as the sight of my Love, Grace, Goodness, and Glory,
that will lead thee to repentance, and humble thee for thy sins, Luke 7.42.47.
Zach. 12.10. Romans 2.4. Esa. 6.5. Genesis 4.13. Mat. 27.3, 4, 5.


Christian, Oh Lord I know I am as wicked a sinner, and as ungodly a wretch as
ever lived: but though I know this, yet methinks I am not broken with the sense
thereof, I cannot weep nor shed tears for my sins, Oh no! I go many times to
prayer and to hear Sermons, and there is no more working, nor relenting upon my
soul, then if I were a dead stock, or stone.


Chapter Oh my dear soul, do not thou belie thy self, for I have heard many a
sorrowful sigh coming from thy heart, and I have seen many a tear drop from
thine Eyes: and I will yet pour out more of the Spirit of mourning upon thee*
But what if thou did no^ find these things in thy self* yet I have offered up
strong cries and tears unto my Father for thee, Ezekiel. 9.4. Psalm. 34.17. Zack.
12.11. Heb. 5.7.


Christian, Oh Lord that I had but faith to believe that I for my self.


Chapter Have faith in me, and be not faithless but believing, Mat. 11.22. Joh.
20.27.


Christian, Lord I find s^ much Atheism and unbelief in my heart, that I have
oftentimes questionings in my self concerning God, and concerning the
Scriptures, and word of God.


Chapter These are the temptations and suggestions of Satan, and my own Disciples
were, and are troubled with them, Luke 24.25.


Christian, Oh Lord I am troubled with a thousand temptations.


Chapter Yet fear not (my loving and dear Child) for thou have diverse temptations,
yet it is that which my best Saints have had, and I will not suffer thee to be
tempted above what thou art able, but I will succor thee in thy temptations,
and I will make a way that thou shall escape, and be delivered out of
temptations, Jam. 1.2.1^ Cor. 10.13. Heb. 2.18. 2 Pet. 2.9.

Christian. But I think n^ Saint has such temptations a^^ mine, for sometimes,
I am tempted to kill my self, and sometimes to kill others; in so much that I
cannot look upon any weapon, waters, or the like, but I am ready to do my self
away therewith.


Chapter Satan tempted me to cast my self off the Pinnacle of the Temple, and he
also tempted many of my dear Children, to destroy themselves: but do not thou
harken to the Accuser (for he does accuse thee to me and me to thee) but rather
say unto him, Satan it is written, my Lord Jesus has overcome thee, and I
hope through his blood, and through his might and spirit to overcome thee
likewise: say also my God has commanded me not to kill another, nor to do hurt
or violence to my self: therefore get thee behind me thou Lier, Murderer, and
Enemy, for I will put my trust in Christ though he kill me, and I will
endeavor to live to serve him, though he should afterward damn me Mat. 4.5.
Rev. 12.10. Job. 12.13. Exodus 20.13. Act. 16.28. Job. 13.15.


Christian, Though I d^ sometimes resolve against Satan's temptations, and
labor to resist them: yet I find my temptations are renewed; and I am not able
to withstand them, for they come in as a flood upon me.


Chapter I that say unto the proud waves, hitherto shall thou come, but no further*
I will by my spirit put the Enemy (Satan) to flight when he comes in like a
flood against thee, Job. 38.11. See Esa. 59.19. Marg.


Christian, But Lord I find am not only troubled with fear and sad temptations:
but also with strong and powerful corruptions.


Chapter I will subdue all thy iniquities and thy sins shall not have dominion over
thee, Mich. 7.19. Romans 6.14.


Christian, Oh but this does much trouble me, that I do not find any love in my
heart to thee.


Chapter What though thou do not, yet I will circumcise thy heart and thou shall
love me: and when thou apprehendest my love to thee, thou will love me again,
Deuteronomy. 30.6. 1 Job. 40.19.


Christian, I have sinned (Lord) against thy mercies and abased thy love, yea
love^ my sins more then thee, therefore I cannot think that eve^ thou will look
upon me with any love or delight.


Chapter So did my servant David, and my people Israel do, yet as I loved them, so
will I love the^ freely; and betroth the^ to me in loving kindnes^ and mercy, 2 Samuel 12.8 9. Hos. 2.5, and 14.4. and 2.9.


Christian, But Lord ^ have not only sinned against thy mercies but against thy
corrections, and chastisements also


Chapter So did my people Israel formerly do, for when I smote them, they went on
forwardly in the way of their evil hearts, but I led them, and restored
comforts to them, Esa. 57.17.18


Christian, I but my condition is worse then all that, for I have been long
under the means of grace, and yet I am altogether fruitless; and like the
barren Fig Tree.


Chapter Thou troubled soul, in me is thy fruit found, and I will purge thee, and
thou shall bring forth fruit abundantly, for they that are planted in my house
shall flourish and be fat, and like a green Olive Tree, Joh. 15.5. Psalm. 92.12,
13, 14.


Christian, I Lord, its true if I were a branch in thee, and a true member of
thy house then I could believe these promises of thine; alas! I am neither of
both, but separated from thee and thy people.


C. Do not say that thou art none of mine, (for ^ have bought thee with my
blood) and do not speak that thou art separated from my people, for I will give
thee in mine house and within my walls, a place, and a name of Son^ and
Daughters, Esa. 56.3.5.


Christian, Sure if I were not an outcast and a Reprobate, I should not be
thus (as I am) in a wilderness condition.


Chapter Israel was counted an outcast, and she cried out, yet I was then a God to
her, and she a people to me, Jer. 30.16.17.22.


Christian, Oh if I were but one of thine, I should then count my self the
happiest in all the world.


Chapter Fear not my Spouse, for I am thy Husband, and thy Father.


Christian, If I were one of thy Children thou would not hide thy self from
me as thou do.


Chapter I have hid my self and my face from some of my Prophers and people of
old, and yet it was in love to them, and so it is to thee, Psalm. 88.14. Esa.
8.17. and 64.7.


Christian, But thou have hid thy self from me, and thou seem also to be
angry with me, Esa. 54.5. Jer. 31.9.


Chapter Fury is not with me (toward thee) and though I be angry, yet my anger is
but for a moment, Esa. 27.4. and 54.8.


Christian, Yet Lord thou have been angry with me a long time, for thou have
forgotten me.


Chapter Zion did say so, the Lord has forsaken me, and my Lord has forgotten me:
yet I had not forgot her; for she was graven upon the palms of my hands. Esa.
49.14.15. Jer. 51.5.


Christian, But Lord if thou had not forgotten me, thou would never have
left me in such a wilderness and barren condition as I am in.


Chapter I have allured thee into the wilderness, that I might speak comfortably
unto thee, Hos. 2.14.


Christian, I have been many years in trouble, and terrors, and wanting peace
in my soul, which could not possibly have been, if I had truly believed in
thee.


Chapter But now will I speak peace unto thee, and I will guide thee into the way
of peace. Psalm. 85.8. Luke 1.79.


Christian, Lord will thou speak peace unto me and guide me into the way of
peace? i. e. The Preachers Lips that Preached peace.



Chapter I will create the fruit of the lips Peace, Peace, and my spirit shall be
in thee, and his fruit shall be peace to thy soul, Esa. 57, 19. and 55.12.


Christian, But Lord thy word says, there is no peace to the wicked.


Chapter No not to a man that will persist in his wicked way, and does not nor will
not believe in me, but thou art one of those that I bore the chastizement of
thy peace, and one of the children of peace, Esa. 53.5. and 54.13.


Christian, But Lord how can I have peace, seeing a man cannot have peace
before (and without) he does believe?


Chapter Thou shall have faith and peace, and I will give peace through believing,
2 These. 3.16.6.

The Character of a true Christian, with some Divine Contemplations,
Observations, and Directions to a Holy Life.
1.

A True Christian is one that has had clear convictions of sin, (especially
his Master sin and unbelief) and of Christ, that is, the want and worth of him;
and of Judgment, that is, of punishment, as the due desert of sin, Joh. 16.8.

2.

He is unbottomed and broken off from himself, he has no confidence in
himself; his Birth, Education, Parts, Performances, and best works, are impure
and imperfect in his own sight, Phil. 3.3. Isa. 64.6.

3.

He is hardly brought to believe; he hardly believes that he does believe, and
hardly casts away his confidence, when he does once truly believe.

4.

Upon self suspicion he does greatly desire to be searched, and does earnestly
search himself, Psalm. 139.1. and last, and Psalm. 77.6.

5.

He does resolve never to go on in any sin, or to neglect any duty.

6.

He prays to God most against his dearest and Master sin, and praises God most
when he has power against it.

7.

He never repents for any sin he has forsaken, for any good he has done, or
for any affliction he has suffered for Christ.

8.

He has Love to all Christians, and seeks Unity among all, and makes Union and
Godliness the ground of his fellowship and Communion, Phil. 1.5. 1 Pet. 2.17.
Romans 14.4. 1 Cor. 1.9, 10.

9.

In reading the Scripture he observes what helps on his holiness, and teaches
self-denial, as well as what increases knowledge.

10.

He cares not what he has, whether he goes, nor what he suffers with Christ
and for him without sin.

11.

His faith helps on his holiness, and his holiness helps up his faith.

12.

Though he always resolves to follow Christ, through every condition, yet he
much suspects and fears that he shall not be able to hold out.

13.

He seeks and prizes holiness to serve God here, as much as happiness hereafter.

14.

He fears God and sin, more then men and suffering, Genesis 39.9. Dan. 3.17.18.

15.

He neglects not his duty though he knows there is great danger in doing of it,
Deuteronomy. 6.10.

16.

He is one that is careful to lay in, and to get true grace in his heart, as
well as in his profession; as the wise Scribe, Mat. 13. and wise Virgin, Mat.
25.

17.

He can and dare do nothing against the Truth, 2 Cor. 13.8. especially if he
knows it.

18.

He cleaves to the Lord, and follows after the Lord fully in the worst times,
and when others forsake him, Number. 14.24. Joh. 6.68.

19.

He respects all, and rejects none of Gods commandments, Psalm. 119.6. 2 Samuel
22.23.

20.

He takes patiently and thankfully, the harshest words and the hardest dealings
of God, 1 Samuel 3.18. 2 Kings 20.19. Job. 1.14. to the end.

21.

He is much affected with, and afflicted for the sufferings of the Godly, and
the sins of the wicked; as David, Jeremiah, Lot, Paul, etc.

22.

He is one that when he is recovered from his former backsliding, remembers his
former good condition and prizes it, and praises God, and hates his sin more
then he did before, Hos. 2.7. and 14.2.3.8.

23.

He seeks and esteems sincerity more then any garnishing gifts and prizes,
plain and poor Christians that are honest and upright, more then they that have
parts and wealth if they be less sincere.

24.

He is one that exercises a good conscience in all things.

25.

He is one that fears God and his name, and desires Grace for Grace sake, Neh.
1.11.

26.

He is one that prays at his first conversion, Acts 9.11. God has no
still-born Children.

27.

He beholds Christ in the deepest affliction, as well as in the most spiritual
ordinance.

28.

He believes he shall sooner overcome his outward Enemies by praying for them,
then by praying against them.

29.

He prefers Christ before self, and suffering before sinning.

30.

He desires to live so holy that we may keep Christ in heaven undispleased; the
spirit within him ungreived, his conscience undefiled, unwounded and unseared,
his profession unstained, his brethren unoffended, and poor sinners unstumbled.

31.

His care is to wait on God, to walk with God, to work all his works in and for
God, to bring his will to submit to the will of God in all things, to glorify
God, and to gain good to himself by all he does and suffers, to do what good
he can to others, and receive what good he can from other Christians to deny
himself, and to be found in Christ's righteousness without his own, Phil. 3.9.

32.

A true Christian will desire to be freed from, 1. Doubts of his Eternal
condition, 2. From the power of corruption, 3. From the fire of the Law in his
conscience, 4. From the fierce Temptations of Satan, 5. From scruples in
matters of opinion, 6. From wicked places and persons, where he can neither do,
nor receive good, nor be without danger of Evil, 7. From a bad frame of heart,
as hardness, straightness, Lukewarmness, 8. From the fear of Death.

33.

A true Christian desires, 1. To know God in Christ, 2. To know himself in
Christ, 3. To know Christ in him, 4. To know himself as he was without Christ,
Ephesians. 2.12. 1 Timothy 1.13. Wicked and wretched in respect of sin, unwilling to
good, and weak in respect of good, Romans 3.9.10, 11. and 8.7. and 5.6.

A Miscellany of Divine Contemplations, Observations and Directions to a Holy
Life.
1.

A Christian is to put forth his faith in prayer, and afterward to follow his
prayer with faith.

2.

Reading of the Scripture helps Meditation, Meditation Prayer, and Prayer every
good work.

3.

Man may come too late to God when the door is shut, but God never comes too
late to men, Luke 13.26. Mat. 20.6.

4.

Pray that thy last days and last works may be best, and that when thou come
to die, thou may have nothing else to do but to die.

5.

It Is very hard to behold our own gifts without pride, and the gifts of others
(if they excel ours) without envy.

6.

Do not commend thy friend, nor discommend thy so too much, least thou be
judged to be partial.

7.

Oh my Soul! will neither great Love, great Mercy, great Forbearance, great
Entreaty, great Patience, great Promises, nor great Wages, prevail with thee to
serve Christ free, better, and more constant and selfdenying.

8.

A deep sense of sin, begets deep sorrow for sin; and true sorrow for sin leads
to well-grounded faith; and from hence flows inward Peace, Joy, and Holiness,

9.

A Passionate and troubled spirit is like a little Rill of water, which every
shower of rain changes the color of it, and makes it muddy.

10.

The fear of death is ingrafted in the common Nature of all men, but faith
works it out of Christians.

11.

Nothing will be terrible where the love of God is apprehended, and nothing
grievous where love to Christ is excercised.

12.

Careless hearing makes carnal hearts, and carnal hearts makes cursed lives.

13.

Oh my Soul! look for death hourly, long for it greatly, prepare for it
carefully, meet and welcome it joyfully for it is Christ's servant to direct his
spouse (the Soul) to him, and thy friend that comes to set thee at liberty from
thy sins; It will discharge thee from thy prison, dismissed thee from thy
sorrows, and bring thee at once to enjoy all thy desires.

14.

Christians, though disagrecing in opinion, should agree in affection; and
though differing in controversy, yet should agree in charity.

15.

He that cannot pity the sinner and hate sin, does not reprove out of love to
Christ, nor from a gracious spirit.

16.

God makes Christians feel him, (or his hand) that he may hear them; strokes
makes cries, and whippings mournful complaints to him.

17.

My Soul! bear up with Christ, bear off from Satan and the world, bear down
thy corruptions, and bear forth thy Testimony.

18.

Clear knowledge of Christ in the understanding, begets fervent love in the
heart; and both godliness in the life.

19.

He that would live for himself (only or chiefly) in the world, is not worthy
to live a day in it.

20.

I would be glad to be out of the world when I have no service to do for God in
it.

21.

God has set the tongue between the brains and heart, that it may advise with
both, and guarded it with Teeth to keep it in, and yet how unruly it is.

22.

A Christians security, and safety is, in doing his duty; and he should always
Study his duty more then his safety; for if he will take care to please God,
God will take care to preserve him.

23.

The love of the Master, the sweetness of the service, and the greatness of the
reward, are sufficient encouragements to serve Christ.

24.

The heaviest afflictions on earth are but light in comparison of Christ's
sufferings, sins desert, or the punnishment of the wicked in Hell.

25.

Lay in, lay up, lay out for Christ, and remember that you will shortly reach
immortallity, but never Eternity.

26.

Oh Christian, why should not he please thee, who art but finite, that pleases
God who is infinite, even Jesus Christ.

27.

A Christian should desire to dye that he may be fully freed from sin, and have
a full fruition of Christ that he may be above all fears and doubts, and may be
able to serve the Lord incessantly and unweariedly.

28.

A true Christian when he goes from hence, changes neither his work nor
company; but his place and condition only.

29.

Be still employed in doing good, and you shall not be much tempted, or
troubled with evil, for the Devil has great advantage, both against those that
are idle or ill-imployed. David was found guilty of the first, 2 Samuel 11.2. and
Jehosophat in the last, 2 Chronicles. 10.31.

30.

Sense of Misery must precede sense of Mercy, and the more we feel and fear
Misery, the more we desire, seek for, and prize Mercy.

31.

It is the least of afflictions to be afflicted by men, for they can afflict
but the outward man only; and of all E^emies man is the ^^ake^t E^^my; But God,
(...), yea Satan, and (...) do afflict the (...) is more intolerable.

32.

That Christian is most in prayer that has most sense of his own wants, and is
most comfortable ordinarily, that is most penitent, and the same word in the
Greek signifies to want and to pray; and the same word in Hebrew, to repent,
and to comfort.

33.

Be more thoughtful and careful how to use what you have to Gods glory, then to
gain more.

34.

Take heed of being humbled and yet unhumbled, that is, of being brought
outwardly Low, and yet the heart continue still high.

35.

Sometimes Ejaculations, or short and sudden pantings, and breathings out of
desires to God, may be more acceptable to him, and more prevailing with him
then long prayers.

36.

Never reckon what thou have of outward and worldly things, unless it be to
praise God for them, or to serve, God better with them.

37.

It is the property of a true Christian to justify God, and to judge himself
under the greatest afflictions.

38.

Learn to know sin, to disallow of it, to despise it, to overcome it inwardly
and to put it from thee: to fear its return, and to be more estranged toward
it, more watchful to avoid Temptations, and wise to shun occasions that lead to
it.

39.

To dye should be no more to a Christian then to breath, or to pass over a
great River on a sure Bridge, or in a safe Boat, or to return from a field
where a man has been working, to his own house to take his rest.

40.

Make have to do thy work (Christian) and God will make have to give thee thy
wages.

41.

The hardest dutys in Christianity are, to deny self, and to destroy sin.

42.

A heart unconverted, is contented with nothing but what is helping it on to
Hell, and it has never enough of that (to wit sin); and a heart converted, is
never satisfied but with what helps it toward heaven, and yet thinks he has
never enough thereof; to wit Christ and Grace.

43.

To take pains about unnecessary and unprofitable things, is laboriously to
mispend time.

44.

Get Christ (O Christian) to bind thy conscience to the peace, and thy
affections and flesh to the good behavior.

45.

Be not ambitious of love, and greatness, and thou shall not be so soon an
object of Envy.

46.

He that converts a sinner, covers a world (or multitude) of sins, and gains
more then a world, to wit, a Soul, Jam. 5.20. Pro. 11.30.

47.

Take heed of covering any man's good with his evil, but let the one plead for
him, as well as the other against him.

48.

One of the chiefest works of the soul, is self examination, and yet a
Christian will find himself most backward thereto, and soonest weary therein.

49.

Seasonable and unexpected mercys are very sweet and acceptable.

50.

The more a soul is exercised in spiritual meditation, the less with carnal
Temptation; and the more frequent and powerful in private prayer, the more free
from, and the more potent against Corruptions.

51.

Sin was condemned by Christ to save the sinner, Romans 8.3. Oh! then let not the
sinner seek to save the sin, to wound Christ again.

52.

Quick onsets and Endeavors to reform, are far better then many purposes and
Resolutions.

53.

Small sins yielded to make way for greater, and one sin for another.

54.

Be sure to praise God when you receive power against sin and Temptation; and
you shall be sure to find God ready to give you power another time when you
want it.

55.

When and where wickedness is most, then and there the godly should strive to
be most godly. It is a sign of sincerity to be good in bad times and in bad
places and among bad persons, as Noah, Lot, and Joseph were.

56.

At the day of death (but especially at the day of Judgment) a Christian will
wish he had sinned less, served God, and suffered for him more.

57.

If Christians were not sometimes afflicted, they would forget both themselves
and others; for affliction works humiliation in men themselves, and compassion
toward others.

58.

It is a hard thing for a profane man to attain the Shadow of Religion; or for
a careless (though true) Christian to attain the substance. And it is hard for
a true Christian that has the substance, to keep up the sense and savor,
either of the excellency of Jesus, or the evil of sin, always in his heart.

59.

Oh! what time do Christians mispend; what duties do they neglect, what mercies
do they slight, what corruptions do they embrace, what Temptations do they lie
under; what corrections do they undervalue. Oh! what heart qualms, and fleshly
weaknesses cry out upon us to make ready? and yet how unready, how unripe, how
unwilling, how unmindful, and unthoughtful are we of our latter end? and this
is because we are unassured of Christ, unweaned from the world, unweary of sin,
unbroken from self, and unapprehensive of the glory to be revealed and enjoyed
hereafter.

60.

Fear thy friends more then thy foes, thy sins more then thy sufferings, and
liberty more then bondage.

61.

Christians should not give offense carelessly, nor take offense causlesly.

62.

Bad times well Improved, are far better then good times not redeemed or
misspent.

63.

It is and shall be the care of a Christian, not to suffer for sin, nor to sin
in suffering.

64.

There is no real bondage, but what is either from sin, or for sin.

65.

Affections, parts, or applause from the world, or from Christians are very
dangerous, and not to be trusted in.

66.

I never trusted Christ but I found him faithful; nor my own heart, but I found
it false.

67.

Shut thy eyes from beholding thy ears from hearing and thy heart from
entertaining sin.

68.

Take heed of reproving or upbraiding another in passion, or to provoke them
thereto; for it is better be silent, then sin in speaking; it is better to keep
thy light under a bushel, then to put it into the hand of him that will blow it
out, or tread it under his feet.

69.

Self-loathing, destroys self-love, and the more we loath our selves, the
better we love others.

70.

Christians should not envy the patience of God toward their enemies, for it is
nothing in comparison of what grace he shows to them.

71.

Of all men a Christian may be freer to lose or to part with any thing then
another man, for he loses nothing but what is hurtful to him (to wit his sins)
or what he shall regain and recover of a better sort, and in a more abundant
degree. As if he lose a small Temporal Estate, he has in reversion an Eternal
inheritance. If he lays down a body that is full of Corruption, he shall have
another free from corruption; and therefore he may say, better then the Heathen
could, what I keep, I lose, and what I give or lay out, I save.

72.

Sins best is before, but its worst is behind; and the sting and Tail of it is
longer then it self; where sin is not killed, it will kill.

73.

A Christians conversation should keep from the show of sin, and his conscience
from the guilt of it.

74.

The power and strength of corruption is but seldom known, to wit, when
Temptations, Opportunities, and Occasions of Trial come.

75.

The best way to keep from Sin, is to set God in his power, Purity, and Glory
still before our eyes; to fear our selves, to keep near Christ, to fast and
pray privately; to engage other Christians for our help; to cherish the holy
spirit, to keep up constant practice of holiness; to provide contrary means
against it, to resolve strongly to withstand it, to eye Gods promises, commands
and threatenings; to withstand the first occasions of sin; to reason it off at a
distance, to believe it away when it comes near; to avoid all occasions
thereof, and to keep on still the Armor of God.

76.

Christians are often apt to be most weary of that condition that does them
most good; like Peter, not understanding what Christ did in washing his feet,
Joh. 13.1.9.

77.

Christians in and under afflictions, should be growing holy; and through their
afflictions should be going on toward happiness; affliction is part of the way
of sanctification leading to salvation, and it is like an up-hil, leading to an
house that is on the top of an hill, for so is heaven; and the greatest
hardship is nearest the end of the journey.

78.

They have but a slight profession whose profession does not lead them out of
sin and through sufferings, and he that is worse under affliction, as Ahar, may
well fuspect his own sincerity.

79.

Christ will soon be sensible of those Christians afflictions, that are
sensible of their own sins.

80.

It ought to be a great part of a Christians trouble, that he can be no time
what he should be, that is, sinless and servicable; that he is not at all
times, what he is sometimes, that is, slighting sin, Judging himself, Loving
Christ, and dispising the world greatly.

81.

It is strange, and a very bad sign, to see Christians, look more upon the sins
of the wicked; to ripen them for misery, then to mind self-humiliation and
holiness, to ripen and fit themselves for mercy.

82.

He loves not a reprover, not values his reproof, never profits thereby; but is
more his sins then his souls Friend.

83.

It Is a sign of a hard heart to desire the Eternal destruction of the wicked,
for obtaining of their own Temporal, and Corporal liberty, safety, or honor;
as if one should desire to have another cast into the fire and be burnt, that
himself may be warmed thereby.

84.

In the midst of earthly businesses the soul should redeem some special time
for secret and private duties.

85.

It is the will of Christ that Christians should rejoice more in what Christ
has done for them, then in what they have done or can do for him.

86.

Christ kept the Law legally, Christians kept it evangellically; He kept it
perfectly, they kept it with full purpose and endeavor.

87.

Ask thy soul (O Christian) whether he be willing to receive Christ upon his
own Terms, and for his own sake, and to accept of pardon and life through him
freely, without looking at all upon thy own righteousness. Art thou contented
that Christ should be honored in and by thee, and that thou should be
despised, and dishonored for his sake?

88.

God does never out-speak, or out-promise his Power, Truth and Faithfulness.

89.

He is a strong Christian that seeks Gods Glory more then his own salvation,
but he is no Christian that seeks neither.

90.

It is a great ease to, and an unburtherning of the to confess sin, sensibly,
humbly, brokenly, and with hatred to it.

91.

Christ and sin are most magnified in the eyes of believers in their
affliction; but in a very different manner, and to a different end: For Christ
appears as the greatest good, and sin as the greatest evil; and then Christ
will be most desired, and sin most despised

92.

It is the duty of a Christian to suspect and search himself, when he does not
know evil by himself.

93.

Account the least spiritual thing better then the greatest and best of outward
and temporal things.

94.

Keeking from sin is Soul-preservative Physic; but repentance for sin is
Soul-Restorative Physic.

95.

Strive greatly to have and exercise a good conscience toward God and men; to
commit thy Soul, Life, and condition to the Lord; and then expect the worst of
men, and the steb of Christ.

96.

Thou must die once whether thou suffer or no, and thou can but die once if
thou suffer.

97.

The sins of Christians are new sufferings to Christ; and the sufferings of
Christians are wounds of Christ, Ephesians. 1.30. Ezekiel. 6.9.

98.

Labor to act those Graces chiefly that are most contrary to your Mastersins.

99.

A Christian may know the weight of sin, by the sufferings of Christ; for if
that strong Bar of Steel did bend under the weight of our sins; what shall poor
weak man do, who is but a reed or rush.

100.

Satan accuses God to men, and men to God; but Christ excuses and answers all
his accusations against his people.

101.

He that will not take example from others, shall make an example himself.

102.

O Lord as a sign that I shall be able to die for thee! let me find my
corruptions dying in me, by power from thee.

103.

He that loves not Christ more then his life, is like to lose Christ, and his
life; but he that loves Christ more than his life, will be sure to save and
keep both, Mark. 10.49. Luke 14.26.

104.

Christians should account restraints from sin, great mercys to them, but
Recoveries out of sin, with spiritual advantage, greater.

105.

Sin has no Mother but a man's heart, nor Father but Satan.

106.

Satan draws the Soul into it, either by Power or Policy by Force or by Fraud.

107.

A Christian should desire to have his heart tied to the Lord, and to be strong
in faith upon Christ, in Love to Christ, and in Resolution for him.

108.

The reason why men do not more magnify Gods grace, is because they do not
behold their own vileness; and the reason why men do not see their own vileness
more, is because they do not apprehend Gods goodness more clearly and fully.

109.

When a Christian comes to be as weary of his sins as of his afflictions, God
will certainly put an end to them.

110.

There will be a reviving of old sins, if there be not effectual repentance for
them, and a care by faith through all duties and ordinances, to get new
strength against them, and a constant watch kept over them.

111.

A Christian comes not to know the weakness of his grace, till the spirit
ceases to work in and by it; nor the power of his corruption till Satan works
therein by his Temptations.

112.

It should trouble a Christian much to have such Graces as he receives from
God, beget so little good in him.

113.

The Lord would soon turn from his wrath, if men were turned from their
wickedness.

114.

He commands most and best that commands in love, humility, and self-denial.

115.

The world is a great nothing, deluding the bad, and disturbing and distracting
the good.

116.

The Holy Law of God teaches a man to see his own deformity, and requires from
a man Conformity to it self.

117.

Satan works more upon men by slight then by might; avoid therefore his
cunning, and thou will avoid his cruelty.

118.

He has not learned to rule well, that has not learned to obey well.

119.

An even, through-paced, self-fearing, heart-melting Christian is always best.

120.

Rusling, opinion-souring, and Church-renting persons, and professors, have
commonly more self then grace, if any at all.

121.

The less a man strives for himself, the more will Christ strive for him.

122.

Thoughts of our own death will much tend to deaden sin.

123.

Prayer is a good preparative to suffering; when Christ had prayed, he went out
to meet Judas, Joh. 18.4.

124.

Be never at peace with sin, Satan, or Christ's implacable Enemies.

125.

In two cases it is hard to act Faith. 1. When there is nothing sensible or
visible to second and support it. 2. When there is very much of these outward
things to fill and take the senses withal.

126.

As Christ was saved from death though he died, Heb. 5.7. So are true
Christians when they overcome death by their resurrection through Christ.

127.

Learn by lighter crosses to look and prepare for heavier.

128.

As our good works and ^^rformances should have an operation upon our souls and
hearts to strengthen faith, so should our weaknesses and sins to work
Repentance.

129.

No power can keep him in Bond whom truth and innocence acquits.

130.

If thou have fallen into sin through violent temptations seek speedily for
Repentance for it, recovery out of it, and Reformation under it. If God has
kept thee from falling, still fear, watch, pray, and live by faith in Christ.

131.

Prepare your self for death and pull out its sting. 1. By bewailing sins past.
2. Turning to God in time to come. 3. Purposing a new life, none can die ill
that has had a care of living well; persuade your self, if you live well, you
shall die well; and if you die well, doubt not but you shall have Eternal
Happiness.

132.

Wish not for a long life, so much as for a good life; he has lived long who
has lived well; a short life in grace, ends in an everlasting life of Glory.

133.

Distrust not Gods providence in any matter, although you see the means
wanting, neither when you have them, let them be re^^ed on more then God
himself, but pray to him for the prosperous use of them.

134.

Love all things for Gods sake, and God only for his own, and look you make him
your friend whosoever be your enemy for (...) this you shall do, if as an
obedient Child, you always live in the eye of your heavenly Father.

135.

Give no offense to any man justly, whether within or without; for woe to them
by whom offenses come.

136.

Carry your self unto all, so as the weak may be won, the strong may be
comforted, and the wicked be ashamed.

137.

Delight to do all the good you can to Gods Children, and to receive all the
good you can from them.

138.

Think it the greatest work in the world to die well, which to do, you must
inure your self to die before hand. 1. By dying to your sins. 2. Learning the
word of affection before it actually leave you. 3. In your last learning of if,
do it willingly, yea joyfully, whenever, wheresoever, or howsoever God shall
call you.

139.

Greive for nothing so much in the world, as for your own sins, and in them for
nothing so much as for offending so loving a God.

140.

Let your meat, apparel, and recreation be lawful, needful, and moderate.

141.

Labor always to learn to die, defy the world, deny the Devil, despise the
flesh, and delight your self in the Lord; be penitent for your sins past and
present, and yet despair not; be strong in Faith, and yet presume not. Desire
with the great Apostle to be dissolved, and to be with Christ, with whom even
in death, there is life.

142.

Use your life, and keep it with as much quietness as you can, so that you
offend not God; that ease that comes with his displeasure turns at length to
an unspeakable pain, and the gain of the world, with the loss of his favour^,
is extreme beggary and wretchedness.

143.

The greatest honor that man can give to God, is to confess his truth truly
and faithfully in time of trouble and affliction.

144.

It is but a folly for any one that truly professes Christ crucified, to look
for the love of the world.

145.

Infidelity is the cause of all our misery, which causes us to fear man more
then God, and to esteem things present, more than things to come.

146.

Love is that flower which shall never fade, but shall flourish more and more,
till it be made perfect in that place, where Faith and Hope shall have no
office, but shall then fully possess that which they have so long patiently
waited for in this world.

147.

After the Lord has made a Christian to know what he is in himself, he will
doubtless show him comfort, and declare to him what he is in Jesus Christ his
Son.

148.

The mind of man cannot be contented patiently to bear the troubles either of
Soul or body, until it be regenerated and possessed by Gods spirit.

149.

Why should we Christians fear death? can death deprive us of Christ, who is
all our comfort, our joy, and our life.

150.

Let us tarry with Christ one hour in Tribulation and affliction, and doubtless
he will keep us for ever with him in joys everlasting.

151.

Patience and Perseverance under great trials are the proper notes whereby Gods
children are known from counterfeits; they that persevere not, were always but
Hypocrites.

152.

If Christ be our Captain we must follow him as good Soldiers; if we keep
company with him in afflictions, we shall be ^^re of his society in Glory, if
we forsake not him, he will never forsake us; if we confess him, he will
confess us; if we be ashamed of him, he will be ashamed of us. Therefore as he
forsook Father, Heaven, and all things to come to us, so let us forsake all
things to come to him, being most sure and certain that we shall not lose
thereby.

153.

Afflictions are in separable, but not infallible notes of Salvation; for none
shall be saved but he must suffer afflictions; but all that are afflicted shall
not be saved.

154.

Wealth is not the way to heaven, but the Contrary; let all our care be, how to
live well, and then to be sure we shall never dye poor.

155.

Afflictions and sufferings are sometimes the way to Glory in this world;
Joseph had never been a Courtier, had he not first been a prisoner.

156.

Gods children are ever the better for being miserable; It is good for me that
I was afflicted: let God use us how he will on Earth, so that we may have what
he has promised to those that love him in Heaven; who would not be a Lazarus
for a day, that he might sit in Abraham's bosom for ever.

Some Heavenly Meditations, Exhortations, and Consolations, of that blessed
Martyr, Mr. John Bradford, and other Martyrs, written out of prison to several
Friends.
To Mr. J.H.
COnsider what this life is; Consider what death is; Consider what is prepared
for you after death.

1. Concerning this life; know it is full of misery, vanity, and woe, it is a
plain banishment, and has nothing in it that has continuance; it is therefore
compared to a vapor, to smoke, to a shadow, yea to a warfare, to a vail of
misery, wherein we are compassed about on every side with most fierce and
fearful Enemies; and should we desire to dwell there? should we be fond to live
in this toylsome and laborious world? should we wish to continue in this
wretched estate? should we take pleasure to remain in this dangerous condition?
Daniels den was not so dreadful, as is this Dungeon we dwell in.

2. Concerning death; to Gods dear children what other thing is it then the
dispatcher of all displeasure, the end of Travil, the door of desires, the gate
of gladness, the port of Paradise, the heaven of Heaven, the entiance into rest
and quietness, the pathway into Felicity, and the beginning of all
blessedness. It is a very bed of Down, (and therefore compared to a sleep) for
the bodies of Gods people to rest, out of which they shall arise, and awake
most fresh and flourishing to everlasting life. It is a passage to the Father,
a chariot to Heaven, the Lords messenger, a leader unto Christ, a going to our
home, a deliverance from prison and bondage, a dismission from war, a security
from all sorrow, and a freedom from all misery. Should we be dismayed at it?
should we be afraid of it? should we trouble to hear of it? should such a
friend as this is be unwelcome? should the foulness of his face, fear us from
his good conditions? should the hardness of his husk, hinder us from his sweet
kernel? should the roughness of the Tide tie us to the bank and shore? should
the hardness of the saddle set us on our feet to perish by the way, rather then
leap up and endure the same a little, and so to be where we would be?

3. Concerning that which is prepared for you after death; if I should go about
to express it, the more I should do so, the further I should be from it. For
the eye has not seen, neither has the ear heard, nor is the heart of man able
to conceive in any measure, the joy, mirth, melody, pleasure, power, wealth,
riches, honor, glory, wisdom, knowledge, treasures, security, peace,
quietness, and eternal felicity, which you shall enjoy world without end with
God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Amen.

O! woe to our blind eyes that see not this, woe to the hardness of our hearts
that feel not this, woe to the deafness of our ears that hear not this, in such
manner as we should do; whereby we should be so far from fearing death, that we
should rather wish, and desire it.

To the Professors of the Gospel By Mr. John Bradford, Martyr.
IT is I Lord that have sinned against thee, it is mine hypocrisy, my
vainglory, my covetuousness, my carnality, security, Idleness, unthankfulness,
self-love and such like, which have deserved the taking away of our King
Edward, of thy word and true Religion, of thy good Ministers, by exile,
imprisonment, and death, it is my wickedness that causes success and increase
of authority and peace to thy Enemies.

Let us reprove the works of darkness, let us fly from all idolatry; let us
abhor the Antichristian and Romish rotten service, let us detest the Popish
Mass, and forsake their Romish Idol, let us prepare our selves for the Cross;
let us be obedient to all in authority in things that are not against God and
his word; for then answer with the Apostle, It is better to obey God then Man.

If you find and feel in your selves, an hope and trust in God, that he will
never tempt you above what he will make you able to bear; then be assured the
Lord will be true to you, and you shall be able to bear all afflictions; but if
you want this hope and confidence, fly and get you hence, rather then by your
tarrying, Gods name should be dishonored.

Hang on the providence of God, not only when you have means to help you, but
also when you have no means, yea, when all means are against you.

Give God this honor which of all other things he chiefly and principally
requires at your hands, namely, To believe that you are his children through
Christ, that he is your Father and God through him, that he loves you, and
pardons you all your offenses, that he is with you in trouble, and will be
with you for ever; that when you fall he will put under his hand, and will not
let you lie long in sin.

Let the life you lead be in the Faith of the Son of God, for the just does
live by Faith; which Faith flies from all evil, and follows the word of God,
as a Lanthorn to her feet, and a light to her steps, her eyes be above where
Jesus Christ is; she beholds not things present, but rather things to come;
she glories in afflictions, and knows that the afflictions of this present
life are not to be compared with that far more exceeding and eternal weight of
glory, which God will reveal to us and in us.

Now of this glory the Lord grant us a lively taste here, then shall we run
after the scent that it sends forth; It will make us valiant men to take to
us the Kingdom of God, whether the Lord of his mercy bring us, in his good
time, through Christ our Lord.

To Dr. H. By Mr. John Bradford Martyr.
SEt before your eyes the end of this straight way, rather then the narrowness
of the passage; so does the husbandman in plowing and tilling the ground set
before him the harvest time; so does the Fisherman consider the draught of his
net, rather then the casting of it in. So does the Merchant, the return of his
Merchandise, and so should we in these stormy days, set before us, not the loss
of our goods, liberty, yea of our very life, but the reaping time, the coming
of our savior Jesus Christ to judgment.

The more we lose here, the greater joy shall we have in the world to come, the
more we suffer here, the greater triumph shall we have there; for corruptable
dross, we shall find incorruptable treasure; for Gold, we shall have glory; for
Silver, we shall have solace, and joy without measure; for riches, we shall
have Royal Robes; for earthly ^ouses, we shall have eternal Palaces; we shall
there have mirth without measure, pleasure without pain, and absolute
blessedness, felicity and happiness, without end.

To certain of his faithful Friends, by Mr. John Bradford, Martyr.
Ye have cause to rejoice (my dearly beloved Friends) in the days of trial and
confirmation, in and by which God our Father makes us like to the Image of
Jesus Christ here, that so we may be like unto him hereafter?

For if we suffer with him, we shall reign with him; if we be buried with him,
we shall rise with him; if we are companions with him in affliction, we shall
rejoice with him in glory; if we sow with him in tears, we shall reap with him
in joy; if we confess him before men, he will confess us before his father in
heaven; if we take his part, he will take ours, if we loose any thing for his
names sake, he will give us all things for his truth and promise sake; so that
we ought to rejoice, and be glad, for it is not given to every one to suffer
loss of country, life, goods, house, and all things for the Lords sake.

What can God the Father do more for us, then to call us into the camp of his
dear Son? what can Jesus Christ our Savior do more for us, then to make us his
Warriors, and fellow Soldiers? what can the holy Ghost do to us above this,
then to mark us with the badg and cognizance of the Lord of Hosts.

Be of good comfort, be of good comfort, my dear hearts in the Lord, confess
him and his truth, and fear not the prison, loss of goods, or life; fear rather
that prison, out of which there is no deliverance; fear rather the loss of
those goods which last for ever; fear rather the loss of that life which is
eternal, whereunto you are called, and the way by which God will bring you to
it; because you know not certainly whether it will be by prison, fire, or
halter; whenever these come, let them not dismay you, nor seem strange unto
you, for no small number of Gods children are gone that way.

The journey is but short, though unpleasant to the flesh; perchance if we
should dye in our beds by a corporal malady, it would be much longer and also
more painful; but in Gods sight it cannot be so precious and gainful as I know
this kind of death is.

And now I commend my self into the hands of my Father, by whose providence, I
came into this world, by whose providence, I have been kept in this world, and
by whose providence, I leave and depart out of this world.

Let us make our selves ready to ride in the fiery Chariot, leaving these sorry
Mantles, and old Cloaks of our carcases behind us in ashes for a little time,
which God shall restore unto us again in a glorious manner.

To a faithful friend of his, by Mr. John Bradford, Martyr.
BE willing to carry the Cross of Christ, least you carry the Cross of the
world, the flesh, and the Devil.

One of these four Crosses you must carry, three of them bring to hell, and
therefore the greatest part go that way, which is the broad way; only the forth
brings to Heaven, but few go that way, as well because the way is straight,
as also because but few walk in it; how beit though it be straight, it is but
short, and the few are many, if you consider the godly as the Patriarks,
Prophets, Apostles, Martyrs, and Confessors, and Christ Jesus with all his
guard and train.

Think not scorn to come after them who are gone before you.

I hourly look for Elias fiery Chariot to come and catch me up to Heaven; my
Cloak, that is my Carcass, I shall leave behind me in ashes, which I doubt not,
my Lord will raise up; and restore to me again at the last day, glorified even
like unto his most glorious Body. That portion of the good spirit which my
Father has lent me, I wish to be doubled, yea trebled upon you all.

If we suffer in the cause of Christ, our sufferings are but short, and the
time of ease to Gods Enemies is not long, the time of our rejoicing shall be
endless, but the time of their torments shall be everlasting and intolerable.
Our breakfast is sharp, but our supper will be sweet. The afflictions of this
life may not be compared in any part, with the glory that shall be revealed.

To his godly Friends. G. and N. By Mr. John Bradford, Martyr.
CAst your care on the Lord, for he cares for you; and has counted all the
hairs on your head so that one shall not perish; if you commit your selves to
his ordering, whereas else your heads and bodies, yea, and souls too shall
perish; if ye withdraw your selves as unwilling to take his Cup, and to drink
of it; not that I would have you to thrust your selves headlong or rashly to
pull them upon you; or that I would not have you use such honest and lawful
means as you may in the fear of God, and with a good conscience to a void the
Cross, and give place to evil, but that I would have you willingly to put forth
your hand to take it when God offers it, in such a manner as with a good
Conscience you cannot escape; then take it, kiss it, and thank God for it. It
is a most sure sign that God loves you; as he says, Whom I love I chastise,
Rev. 3.19. And if ye are not partakers of correction, surely ye are no
children, Heb. 12.8.

But if once chastise you, and ye kiss the rod, verily he will cast the rod
into the fire, and will embrace you, and kiss you as a mother does her child,
when she perceives it to take her correction in good part.

Consider not the things of this life (my dearly beloved brethren) which is a
very prison to all Gods children, but the things of Everlasting life, which is
our very home; but to the believing of this, you must open the eyes of your
Faith, as Moses did, who set more by trouble with Gods people, then by the
riches of Egypt and Pharoahs Court. Your house, home, goods, yea life, and all
that ever ye have, God has given you as love tokens, and to admonish you of
his love, and to win your love to him again; now he will try your love, whether
you set more by him, then by his tokens or no. If ye for his tokens sake, that
is, for your house, home, goods, yea life, will go with the world, least you
should lose them, then be assured your love, as he cannot but espy it to be a
Strumpets love, so will he reject and cast it away with the world.

In another Letter to the same persons, by Mr. John Bradford, Martyr.
MY dearly beloved, heavy is this anger fallen upon us all, doleful is this
day. Now has Antichrist gotten all his power again, now is Christ's Gospel
trodden under foot, now is Gods people a division, and a prey for the wicked.

Now is the greatest of all plagues fallen upon us, the want of Gods word, and
all these judgments we have, yea I alone have justly deserved.

Oh that as I write with my hands (I alone) so I could wish David, 2 Samuel 24
17. and with Jonas in heart say so. But I do not, I do not; I see how
grievously I have sinned, and how great a misery is fallen upon us, for my
unthankfulness for Gods word, for mine hypocrisy, in professing, preaching,
hearing, and speaking of Gods word; for my not praying to God for the
continuance of it, for my not loving it thoroughly as it required.

Oh good Father, it is we that have sinned, and therefore deserve the taking
away of thy good word; it is we that have done amiss, we have dealt unjustly
with thy Gospel, we have procured thy wrath, and therefore just art thou in
punishing us, just art thou in plaguing us, for we are very miserable.

But good Lord and dear Father of Mercies, whose justice is such that thou will
not punish the poor souls of this Realm, which yet have not thus sinned against
thee as we have done, (for many yet never heard thy word) for our trespasses;
and whose mercy is so great, that thou will put our sins out of thy Remembrance
for thy Christ sake; if we believe and repent.

O Lord, let us remember that all thy dearest children have carried the Cross
of gracious affliction in this life, in whose company thou do place us, and
do lay such a Cross upon us, as thou will make us able to bear, to thy glory,
and our Salvation in Christ, for whose sake we pray thee to shorten the days of
this our great misery, fallen upon us most justly, and in the mean season to
give us Patience, Repentance, Faith, and thy eternal Consolation, Amen, Amen,
Amen.

To Mr. J. H. and his wife, Prisoners in Newgate.
I have heard my good Brother and Sister, how God has brought you both into
his School-house of correction, he I say has brought you where you are, and
though your reason and wit tell you it is by chance and fortune, or otherwise;
yet my dear beloved, know for certain, that whatsoever was the means, God your
Father was the worker hereof, and that for your good, though it may be your old
Adam and poor senses may tell you otherwise; yet I say of a truth, it is your
duty to think that this Cross is of Gods sending, and comes from him, and it
is out of his love and Fatherly affection, for your benefit and profit sake.

But here perhaps you will object, what benefit, what advantage can it be? You
are now kept in close prison; your children and Family are without good
overseers; and by this means your goods are diminished, poverty will approach,
and it may be more dangers also, as loss of life, etc.

These you will say are no Benefits, but disadvantages, and those no mean ones
neither, so that you would be glad truly to know what benefit can come to you
by this Cross, which seems rather to bring you very great loss and damage.

To these things I answer, that it is true indeed as you say, of your bodies,
families, children, substance, poverty, life, etc.

But if you would consider a while with inward eyes, as you now behold them
with outward, then perhaps you would find more ease.

Do you not now by your inward sense perceive, that you must part from all
these things, as well as with other worldly benesits; Tell me then, have you
not this benefit by your Cross, to learn to loath, and leave the world, and to
long for, and desire another world, where is perpetuity and eternal happiness.

You ought of your own mind and free will, to have forsaken the world and all
earthly things, using this world as though you used it not, and having your
hearts only set upon your treasures in Heaaven, or else you can never be Christ
true Disciple, that is to be saved, and to be where he is.

And think you, my dear hearts in the Lord, think you that this is no benefit,
to be compelled to do thus by this cross, that so you may assuredly enjoy
enless glory with the Lord.

How does God now as it were fatherly correct you, to remember you of your
former offenses concerning these things, and all other your miscarriages, that
your repentance and remission might ensue thereupon? How does God now compel
you to call upon him, and to be earnest in prayer? Are these no benefits? does
not the Scripture say, that God does correct us in this world, because we
should not be damned with the world? That God chastneth every one whom he
loves? that the end of this his correction shall be joy and holiness? does not
the Scripture say, that they are happy that suffer for righteousness sake, as
ye do, that the glory and spirit of God rests upon them, that as you are now
made like unto Christ insuffering, so you shall be made like unto him in
reigning; does not the Scripture say, you are now going the highway and right
way to Heaven? My dearly beloved, what greater benefit then this can a godly
heart desire?

The Lord open our hearts to see and feel this indeed, then shall we think the
Cross and afflictions, which are the means to bring us to this, to be very
advantageous; Then shall we thank God that he would chastise us. And that we
may do this indeed, my dearly beloved, Let us still remember that our Cross
comes from God, and that they come from God as a Father, for our profit and
benefit, and therefore that we ought to call to mind our sins, and to ask
pardon for them; and to look certainly for help at Gods hand, in his good time,
such help as shall make most for Gods glory, and for the comfort and benefit of
our souls eternally.

Now if we do thoroughly believe, and sensibly conceive these things, then there
will issue out from us hearty thanksgiving, which God requires as a most
precious sacrifice.

And that we may all be thus thankful through Christ, let us use earnest prayer
to our God and dear Father, begging of him to bless us, keep us, and comfort us
under his sweet Cross for ever and ever. Amen, Amen.

To Mr. Laurence Sanders, By Mr. John Bradford, Martyr.
AH good brother, that I could always have God, his majesty, mercy, Heaven,
and Hell before me, then should I endure as Moses, as seeing him that is
invisible.

Blessed are they that die in the Lord, then how much more, they that die for
the Lord.

All here therefore (God be praised) do willingly pledge our Captain Christ of
his Cup, even when he will, or how he will.

Let us rejoice in the straight way, which few find, and fewer walk therein,
but fewest of all continue therein unto the end.

Doubting of Gods favor, is the very Dungeon of despair.

Who live soberly but such as are holy?

Once accepted and beloved of God in Christ, and ever beloved; for whom he
loves, he loves to the end.

Repentance and justification is the Gramar School, wherein we must first be
conversant and learned, before we go to the University of Gods most holy
predestination.

The pattern which we must follow is Christ himself, and not the multitude nor
custom.

In all things we must avoid the seeking of our selves, as well in doing, as in
learning things undone.

Long did the Lord linger and tarry to have showed mercy upon us, but we were
ever the longer the worse.

He that will not have Gods blessing, it shall be taken from him.

Bishop Ridly, In a Letter to the dispersed brethren.
WE never had a better or more just cause, either to continue our life, or shed
our blood; we cannot take in hand a more certain, clear, and manifest Truth.
For it is not any ceremony for which we contend, but it touches the very
substance of our whole Religion, yea even Christ himself.

What can all their cruelty do against us, but make our Crowns more glorious,
yea, beautify and multiply the same?

I esteem nothing available for me, which will not further the glory of God.

Whosoever knowingly neglects and regards not to keep a good conscience, he
cannot have peace with God, nor a lively Faith in his mercy.

If our Doctrine were once the truth of Gods word, do you think that the
alteration and change of the times can ever make it an untruth.

Let us join hands together in Christ, and if we cannot overthrow, yet over
power, and as much as in us lies, let us shake those strong holds, not with
carnal, but with spiritual weapons.

It is not the slanderers evil Tongue, but a man's own evil deed that can defile
him before God.

Yours by Gods grace in our Master Christ's cause unto the Stake, and
thenceforth without all dangeror peril for ever and ever.

Doctor Tailor, In a Letter to Bishop Cranmer.
GOD be praised again and again for this your excellent promotion, which you
are called unto at this present, in that you are counted worthy to be allowed
among the number of Christ's Records, and witnesses, England has had but a few
learned Bishops that would stick to Christ, so as to burn for his cause.

For Gods sake pray for us, for we fail not daily to pray for you, we are
strongter, and stronger in the Lord, his name be praised, and we doubt not but
ye be so also in Christ sweet School; Heaven is all and wholly on our side.

Rejoice therefore in the Lord, and again I say rejoice.

Pray for me, I will pray for you; God be praised, since my condemnation, I was
never afraid to die.

Bishop Hooper In a Letter to certain godly persons.
LEt us prav unto God so to furnish us with Faith and Patience, that we may
rather dye ten times, then to deny him once; it is very requisite that the
Members of Christ, comfort one another, make prayers together, confer one with
another, so shall you be stronger, and Gods spirit shall not be absent from
you, but be in the midst of you, to teach you, to comfort you, to make you wise
in all godliness, patient in tribulation and strong in persecution. Ye see how
the congregation of the wicked, by helping one another, make their wicked
Religion, and themselves strong against God, his truth and his people.

If any smart, Gods people shall be the first; if any suffer shame they begin;
if any be subject to slander it is those that he loves, so that Christ shows
no face, nor favor, nor love almost in this world outwardly to them, but does
as it were lay clay upon the sore eyes of those that are sorrowful, yet the
patient man sees (as St. Paul says) life hid under these miseries and
adversities, and light, and sight, hid under this foul clay.

The will of our Father be done in all things, if he will life, life be it, if
he will death, death be it.

It is a trouble to loose the treasures of this life, but yet a very great
pain, if they be kept with offense to God; cry, call, pray, and in Christ daily
require help, succor, mercy, wisdom, grace and defense, that the wickedness
of this world prevail not against us. We began well, God preserve us to the end.

This life is short and miserable, happy are they that can spend it to the
glory of God.

We may be tempted of the world, the flesh, and the Devil, but yet although
these things pinch, yet they do not pierce, and although they work sin in us,
yet in Christ no condemnation to them that are grafted in him.

Mr. Richard Rooth, In a Letter to certain Martyrs condemned at Colchester.
OH dear hearts in Christ, what a Crown of glory shall ye receive with Christ
in the Kingdom of God; Oh that it had been the good will of God that I had
been ready to have gone with you, for I lie in the Bishops little ease in the
day, and in the night I lie in the coal-house, and we look every day when we
shall be condemned, for they say, I shall be burned within ten days before
Easter; but I lie still at the pools brink, and every one stepeth in before me;
but we abide patiently the Lords leisure, in many bonds, in fetters and stocks,
by which we have received great joy in the Lord.

Oh my dear hearts, now shall you be clothed with long white garments upon
mount Sion, with the multitude of Saints, and with Jesus Christ our Savior,
who will never forsake us.

Oh blessed Virgins, you have played the wise Virgins part, because you have
taken oil into your lamps, that you may enter with the Bridegroom when he
comes into everlasting joy. But as for the foolish, they shall be shut out,
because they made not themselves ready to suffer with Christ, nor venture to
take up his Cross.

O how precious shall your death be in the sight of the Lord, dear and precious
in his sight is he detah of all his Saints: Farewell mine own dear Hearts, and
pray the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all Amen. Pray, pray, pray.

By me Richard Rooth, written with my own blood.

Mr. John Philpot, In a Letter to Mr. R.H.R.G.M.H. and J.C.
GLorious is the course of the Martyrs at this day; Never had the Elect of God
a better time for their glory then this is. Now may they be assured under the
Cross that they are Christ's Disciples for ever.

Many go on well, till they come to the Pikes, and then they turn their backs,
and give over in the plain field, to the shame of Christ and his Church, that
has so faint hearted Soldiers in his camp at the time of need, in that
wherein his glory ought most manfully to be showed.

Be content to have your Faith tried every day by some Cross or other, as it
pleases God to put it upon you, and if God put no grievous Cross upon you, let
your brethrens Cross be your Cross, which is a certain token of true brotherly
love.

Hitherto we have not resisted unto bloodshedding, our blood must not be too
dear for the Lord, and then his Kingdom shall not be too dear for us.

We have taken our Pressmony a great while, let us now learn to serve him
faithfully, and not to fly out of the Lords camp into the world, as many do.

Mr. John Careless, To several Martyrs condemned to die for the truth, in
Newgate.
SO great honor is not permitted to the highest Angel in Heaven, as to suffer
for the name of Christ.

Full glad may you be that ever God gave you a life to lose for his sake.

A weak Faith has ever a cold charity annexed unto it, which is quenched with
every unkind word.

Nothing can anger the malicious mind, and cankered heart of Satan more, then
the mirth, gladness, and hearty rejoicing of Gods Children in their good Christ.

Only Christ's true Disciples do mourn for his absence, therefore they shall
doubtless rejoice in his presence, which will be so much the more joyful, by
how much the more his absence is sorrowful.

According to your Faith and as you believe, so shall it be unto you, and as
you think God to be unto you, such a one you shall find him to be, think
therefore ever sweetly of the Lord, and of his goodness.

Mr. John Careless In a Letter to Mr. John Bradford.
NOw with a merry heart, and joyful tears, I take my farewell of you, mine own
dear brother in the Lord, begging him to send us shortly a joyful meeting in
his kingdom, that we may both sing praises together unto him with his holy
Angels, and blessed spirits for ever and ever.

Farewell thou blessed of the Lord, farewell in Christ, depart unto thy rest, and
pray for me for Gods sake.

Well, I will hope in God, and pray all night that God would send me some
comfort to morrow, and if the Lord give you leisure to morrow, let me hear four
words of comfort from you for Gods sake.

Oh that my life, and a thousand such wretched lives more might go for yours.
Oh why does God suffer me, and such other poor worms to live, that can do
nothing but consume the Alms of the Church, and yet take you away so worthy a
workman and Labourer in the Lords vineyard?

But woe be to our sins and great unthankfulness which is the cause of taking
away of such instruments of the Lord, as should set forth his glory, and
instruct his people; if we had been thankful to God for the good Ministers of
his word, we had not been so soon deprived of them; The Lord forgive our great
ingratitude and his, and give us true repentance and faith, and stretch forth
his hand of mercy over us, for his dear Son Christ his sake; take not away all
thy true Preachers out of this Realm O Lord, but leave us a seed, least England
be made as Sodom and Gomorrah, when thy true Lots are removed and gone.

But why go I about to mingle your mirth with my mourning, your just joy with
my deserved sorrow? if I loved you as I pretended, I should surely rejoice with
you most heartily, and praise God from the very bottom of my heart; I should
praise God night and day for your excellent Election, in and through his great
mercy.

I should give him most humble thanks for your vocation by his Gospel, and your
true knowledge in the same.

I should earnestly praise him for your sweet justification, whereof you are
most certain by Gods grace and spirit; I should earnestly pray to him for your
Glorification, which shall shortly ensue.

I should rejoice and be glad to see you dignified by the Crown of Martyrdom,
and to be appointed to that honor to testify his truth, and to seal it with
your blood.

I should highly extol the Lord, who has given you a glorious victory over all
your Enemies, visible and invisible, and has given you grace and strength to
finish your Course as you have begun.

Oh that the time were now come, that I might put off this frail Tabernacle of
the flesh, in this heavenly security, quietness of conscience in Jesus Christ.

Yours for ever in the Lord Jesus, John Careless, living in hope against hope

Mr. John Careless, to Mr. Philpot.
MY dearly beloved brother, God has brought you into a straight place; out of
your pinching and painful seat in prison, you have plentifully poured upon me
your precious Ointment, the sweet Savor whereof has greatly refreshed my
faint and tired soul.

Ah good Jeremiah, has Pashur put thee in the Stocks? why, now thou have the
reward of a Prophet, thy glory never began to appear until now.

Oh good Mr. Philpot, which art a principle Pot indeed, filled with most
precious liquor, as appears by thy plenteous pouring out of the same; O Pot
most happy, ordained to honor by the high Potter, thou do contain heavenly
treasure in thy earthen vessel. Oh Pot thrice happy, in whom Christ has
wrought a great miracle, altering thy nature, and turning water into Wine, and
that of the best, out of whom the Master of the Feast has filled my cup so
full, that I am even overcome in joy of the spirit through the same.

Be not offended, dear heart, at my Metaphorical speech, for I am disposed to
be merry, and with David, to dance before the Ark of the Lord, and though you
play on a painful pair of Organs, the Stocks, not very comely, nor easy to the
flesh, yet the sweet sound that came from thence to me, from you, causes me
thus to speak.

Oh that I were with you in the body (as I am present in spirit) that I might
sing all care away in Christ Jesus our blessed Savior and Redeemer from all
trouble, for now the time of comfort is come.

Mr. Laurence Sanders, In a Letter to the true Professors of the Gospel.
MY dear friends in the Lord, the times are perilous and dangerous, we must
therefore be circumspect and not solace, and delight our selves in carnal
security, but with a joyful and contented mind we must now venture into the
ship of Christ's Cross and afflictions; and now let us seriously weigh, and
consider, all the perils, dangers, and hazards that we must expect to meet in
our journey to our heavenly Country, yet let us account it comfort enough in
this dangerous Voyage, that we have the company and fellowship of such an
adventurer as our blessed Lord Jesus to go along with us; when he was once in
the ship with his Disciples, with his word he did assuage the swelling of the
dangerous Seas, and he has not left us alone in this ship, either to sink or
to swim, but will be awaked, if he be called upon by importunate prayer.

Holy Breathings: OR, A Divine Dialogue between Jesus and the Soul. With other
Poems.
Mat. 11.28. Come unto me all ye that labor, and are heavy laden, and I will
give you rest.
Soul. COme unto me; what voice is this I here?

Jesus. It is the sweet voice of thy Savior dear,
He calls laboring sinners, to him flee,
He calls laden sinners, such as thee.
He calls sinners, bids them come away,
He calls all, Oh why then should thou stay?
He calls such as by sin are undone,
He calls thee, therefore unto him run.

Soul. But how I should come to thee Blessed Lord,
Sin is the only thing by thee abhord.
And I am nothing else but sin, and thou,
Wilt not of sin, of the least sin allow;
Besides thou art in heaven, and how shall I,
Reach unto thee, thou art above the sky?
And I poor creature, grovling on the earth,
The mold from which at first I came by birth.

Jesus. Remember soul my blessed word that says,
That coming to me, is alone by Faith.

Soul. Thou Lord that put faith into man's heart,
Bestow on me that gift; to me impart
Such other graces as may let me see
My want of Christ, that I may come to thee.
My sins thou know a heavy burden are,
A load that is too big for me to bear.
No slave that is under Turkish Tyranny,
Is under such sad bondage as am I.
But it is unto thee O Christ I come,
Believing in thee; Oh make me a Room
Within thy Arms, take me into thy heart,
And since my Faith is weak, strong Faith impart.

Jesus. Poor Soul! take comfort, though thy Faith be small,
A grain of mustard seed's smallest of all.
Yet I of mustard seeds of Faith allow,
So that thy Soul unto my Scepter bow.
Nay of one grain; a wonder let it be,
To thy poor soul that such love is in me:
That I accept of Faith, even of the least,
That I receive so poor, so vile a guest
As wretched man, who nothing has to bring,
To make him acceptable but his sin.

Soul. O blessed Jesus! mount me on the wing
Of Holy Faith; let me not feel the sting
Of conscience; but let me answer all
That I believed, and went at Christ his call.
My Savior called, and I unto him went,
He gave me Faith, and helped me to repent.
I come with sorrow, that I sinned have,
I come with Faith, that thou my soul wilt save.
It is but weak, O Lord, I must confess,
It is a feeble hand, yet never the less,
It is the hand of Faith, and it is true,
It lays holds on thee, claiming but its due,
And that is Rest, which thou have promised me,
And my poor soul is restless, till with thee.
Rest is that good all creatures do desire;
Rest is that good, to which all Saints aspire.
If the bodies resting after labor be,
So sweet, so pleasant, as we know, and see,
Then what is it to have the soul to rest
In the enjoyment of a God still blessed.
From thee is all the rest for which I look,
For it is written in thy sacred book,
That those that cast, and roll themselves on thee,
Thou will receive; O Lord receive thou me.
For still this Prayer, I will pray, (though brief,)
Lord I believe, Lord help my unbelief.
Thou art now mine by faith, I thine by love,
From this persuasion let me never move.

Oh that my ways were directed to keep thy Statutes, Psalm: 119.5.
1.
O That I could stand firm at last,
And not be reeling too and fro!
O that I could my God hold fast,
And never, never, let him go!
2.
How often do I go astray,
And leave my rest, my wonted bliss?
Like a lost sheep in the Highway,
Which dangerous and barren is.
3.
I have no pleasure in my sin,
And yet I Act it over and over!
I Am still the same that I have been,
Though fain I would be so no more.
4.
I long to keep the Law of God,
But still I break it to my pain,
My stomach serves to take that food,
But straight I cast it up again.
5.
My God! O take me unto thee,
With fire hot zeal melt thou my heart,
That now I may newmoulded be,
And made sound in my better part.
6.
Lord lead me by thy grace, that I
May never wander from thee more,
Thou art my life, I cannot die,
Thou art my all, I cannot be poor.
I see another Law in my members, warring against the Law of my mind, etc. Romans
7.23.
WRetch that I am! my wishes are my pain,
Two Laws so different, rend my heart in twain.
My heart divided, bleeds in either part!
Offending either Law, I Am sure to smart!
Enslaved to sin, I Am forced to bear this yoke.
I kiss the rod, even whilst I feel the stroke.
The ungrateful serpent in my breast I warm!
How I drink poison, and embrace my harm.
My pleasure is my trouble, and the heat
Of fond desire, what is it but a cold sweat?
Alas! I Am taken with the baits of Sin!
Those corrupt joys but feed the worm within;
I triumph when my heart me prisoner takes,
My mind is grieved thus at the spoil it makes.
O Jesus for me wounded! see my wound!
Give me thy Bruises, that I may be sound!
With thy blood wash my heart, in blood imbrued!
Give me that peace, which may this War conclude.
Help thou my unbelief, Mark 9.24.
HElp Master of my faith! I Am forced to wink
At this bright truth! in these great depths I sink!
O it is beyond my reach, I cannot tread,
Nor can I swim unless thou hold my head!
My reasons at a stand, thus are thy ways
Past finding out! How dazzling are thy rays
O Sun of righteousness, to humane sight,
Thou art so glorious, I cannot see for light.
My joys are changed to doubts, and fears, which roll
Like stormy billows in my wavering soul!
Shine forth my Son, amidst these showers of tears,
Let thy clear beams pierce through these cloud of fears.
Show me thy hidden Mauna, Angels food,
I long to taste, and see that thou art good.
I Am come to see the Lord, though vile and poor,
O let me in; I Will die else at thy door.
Oh Lord restore me to thy Grace,
I hope thou do but hide thy face.
O Jesus do but look on me,
Like Peter, I Will weep bitterly.
By thy bright face show me my stain,
I Will pour forth tears to wash it clean.
I hope the day will come again anon,
The Sun of Righteousness is set, not gone.
Having the Loins of your mind girded.
THere is a God! my soul how durst thou stray?
Thou Wilt meet his vengeance if thou go this way.
Return, Return, Lo this path seems too broad,
Here many go, the way to heaven's, no road.
My soul put on thy Garments, gird them fast,
'Twill make thee comely thus to go straight-lac't.
And now I am resolved in spite of Hell,
And my false Heart; I'ie still strive to do well.
In all my warfare, I Will hold fast my shield,
Then Satan do thy worst, I Will win the field.
A Farewell to the World.
1.
FAls-hearted world; farewell, farewell, I find, thee too unkind.
I took thee for a friend, did love to play, with thee all day.
But thou did cheat me still I to my shame lost every game.
Thy stakes were pleasures and deceitful toies,
Mine were true coin, full weight, large solid joys.
2.
Now thou have got all that I had, I see Thou slightest me.
Thou used'st to embrace me kindly, and give me thy hand.
With many promises of love, but lo, Thou art my foe.
Though all my serious thoughts and company
(Fool that I was) I left to follow thee.
3.
But I Will return to them again; I Will rome no more from home.
The mind that stays within shall never complain, of Wind, or Rain,
Of care, or grief, for storms shake only breasts that seek their rests
Without doors; where is naught but toil, as though
To be kept warm, they would lie in beds of snow.
4.
Great God, I leave the world and come to thee, open to me,
I call! O let me find thy throne of grace, I seek thy face,
I Will die to sin, put off myself, and then, be born again.
Christ's blood shall be my life; the word (that can
Call up the Dead) is breath to the new Man.
