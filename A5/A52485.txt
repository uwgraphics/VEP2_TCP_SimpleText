THE NORWICH LOYAL LITANY.
DEfend us from all Popish Plots,
That so the People fray;
And eke also from Treacherous Scots,
As bad or worse then they.
From Parliaments long Rumps and Tails,
From House of Commons Furies,
Defend us eke from Protestant Flayls,
And Ignoramus Juries.
Protect us now, and evermore,
From a white Sheet and Proctor;
And from that Noble Peer brought over
The Salamancha Doctor.
A Doctor with a Witness sure,
Both in his Rise and Fall:
His Exit almost as obscure
As his Original.
Designs and Dangers far Remove,
From this Distressed Nation,
And Damn' the Traiterous Model of
Bold Tony's Association.
And may the Prick-Ear'd Party that
Have Coin enough in Cupboard,
Forbear to Shiver an Estate,
And Splinters mount for Hobart.
From sixteen self-conceited Peers,
Protect our Sovereign still;
And from the Damned Petitioners,
For the Exclusive Bill.
Guard (Heaven) great Charles, and his Estate
Against Tony upon Tony;
And from a House of Commons, that
Will give the King no Money.
From those that did design and laugh,
At Tangier in Distress;
And were Mahometans worse by half,
Then all the Moors of Fez.
From such as with Usurping hand,
Drive Princes to Extremes;
Confound all their Devices, and
Deliver Charles, and James.
But may the beauteous Youth come home,
And do the thing that is fit,
Or I must tell that Absalom,
He has more Hair then Wit.
May he be wise and soon expel
The old Fox, the old Fawning Elf;
The time draws nigh Achitophel,
Shant need to hang himself,
This Jury I Have Empanel'd here,
Of honest lines and true,
Vhom you will I doubt at Westminster,
Find Ignoramus too.
