A POEM ON THE RIGHT HONORABLE Sir James SMITH, The Present Lord MAYOR Of the
CITY of LONDON.
NOw may the Loyal once more hope to see
The CITY Blessed, with civil Majestry;
The People pleased with their Monarchs choice,
The WHIGS confounded, and the Church rejoice.
Since he is chosen to possess the CHAIR,
Who never knew no other honor here:
Then to discharge those duties, which the just
Carries untainted with them to the dust,
In whose exact, and credible demean,
Much Loyalty and Justice may be seen.
Justice, that may mistaken Zeal recall,
And turn the Sword, which pointed to Whitehall,
Against those Rebels, that would destroy us all.
Rebels, that would destructively once more,
Unthrone their King, and Tap our English gore,
Whose tender consciences digest no Law,
But what was made to keep their KING in awe,
Who rather than their cause should perish yet
Would draw on Heaven, if Heaven would suffer it,
Proud and ungrateful Wretches, that must be
By Justice lasht into fidelity.
Or nothing else their pride can countermand,
Not Argos Eyes, not yet Briarus hands;
In these letigious times can scarcely do,
Without the helir of Heaven and Ceasar too,
Therefore let Justice then their ACTS regard
And on this spacious CITY Watch and Ward:
But since the Scales will now be balanced true,
And held at once by God our King and you,
What can we fear when governed we shall be,
By this thrice great, thrice blessed Triumviry.
LONDON, Printed for S. W. 1684.
