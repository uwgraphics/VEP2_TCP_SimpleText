Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting Dan. v. 27.

Turn to ^ Light with-in

The Quakers Books.

To the Law and testimony

The Holy Bible



Religion here in Emblem you may Spy
Poisd in the Ballanse of the Sactuary
The Quaker on a Light within does Rest
But hence may Learn it will not Bide the Test
Into the Scale he Inspiration flings
Boasted perfection, notionary, things
Small pamphlets and large Folio's great Store
Whicth he as sacred Dictates does Adore
And so (all things Considerd) he may well
Who Counts his Authors All Infallible;
But still you see his side alost does fly
His Arguments are Light as Vanity;
One single Book (Gods word) does overpoize
Whole Heaps of such poor superficial Toys;
All Faith and Doctrine not Derived from thence
Is but aspecious Vain Impertinence.
