The Royal Law, and Covenant of God. What, and where it is, and who are in it:
And who are Reprobate to the Faith.
AS many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God, who are
begotten of the Royal Spirit, not of the Earthly, but of the Heavenly, a Seed
separated from the World, to serve in Spirit, who have the Royal Law written
in their hearts, and the Royal Worship in Spirit and power, which are of the
Royal Priesthood, of which the Spirit of the world makes an imitation, from
the letter, the words spoke by them who was of the Royal Seed, but knows not
the Spirit, therefore sets up the earthly Spirit to worship, contrary to the
Law Royal, which is spiritual and pure for ever, and this Spirit would rule
over the Spirit of God, which makes a profession of the words given sorth by
the Spirit of God. And such are you as make Laws which stand in respect of
persons, where self is eyed and would be honored. And by the Royal Law are
you condemned, which denies respect of persons, and leads to do to all men as
they would be done unto; and upon this foundation stands all the Law and the
Prophets. So you who profess the Law and the Prophets words, and set up
respect of persons, with the Law and the Prophets words you are judged, and
your, partial evil thoughts, James 2. And your profession shall arise in
condemnation against you; and from all that have the faith of Christ are you
condemned, which faith cannot be where respect of persons is, John 5. 44. James
2. because it stands in God, who respects no man's person; so with the
foundation of God you are cast out, and with the Royal Law are you condemned.
And all you that count the proud happy, and despise the poor, are against the
Royal Law And all you who do not as you would be done unto, are against the
Royal Law. And all you that say and do not, whose hearts teaches not, your
mouth, are out of the Royal Law, and not guided by that Spirit, nor of that
Priesthood, nor does those lips preserve knowledge, but all such darkens
Counsel by words without knowledge, and knows not the Royal Law of God. And
all who takes the Saints words to plead against the Saints life and practice,
are against the Royal Law, and the Royal Priesthood, and with it are judged
and condemned, and with it are seen to be perverters of the Scriptures; using
them to draw into the imitations and traditions, thereby making the Royal Law
of none effect; which Law is written in the heart, which is before tradition
was, which Law you make void, who receive not your Law and light there, and
Christ is not your Lawgiver, whose Law is spiritual, and so is his
Priesthood, and so is his Judgment, and his Kingdom Royal, and who are
united there are the Royal Diadem, joined to the Lord in everlasting Covenant,
married in the Spirit, where is no dissolution, but fruitful for ever. But all
you who respects persons, casts the Royal Law of God behind your backs, and
trample it under your feet, and makes it of none effect. And all you that
respect persons, are transgressors, and committers of sin, and judged with the
Royal Law of Liberty, which says, So speak, and so do, and Thou shall love
thy neighbor as thy self; and if you do so, you do well, but if you do
respect men's persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the Law as
transgressors. And you that respect him that wears the gay Clothing, and gold
Ring, and despise the poor, ye are the partial, and the Judgers with the evil
thoughts, and such are not Heirs of the Kingdom of Promise, but the poor
despised rich in faith, who are in the Law of Liberty, respects no man's person,
but it convinces all that does. And who are in the faith, without respect of
persons, for who are in respect of persons, are out of the faith of our Lord
Jesus Christ; and such are Reprobate concerning the faith, being filled with
unrighteousness, professing they know God, but in works they deny him,
worshipping and serving the Creature, more then the Creator.

A Paper showing the glory of man that God will stain, and shows the glory of
God that cannot be stained.
SCum off the filth, and come from under the thick Clay which ye are laden
withal, ease your selves of that burden, the Beasts of the South are great,
which goes on as the Ox to the slaughter, to whom the word of the Lord is a
sword, hammer, and fire. The wanton ones, and careless ones are many, and such
as be in pleasures, which be dead while they live, which stains and defiles
the earth, which the blessing comes not upon, but the Sword, and the Judgment,
and the Canker, and the Destroyer, and the Rust, and the Waster, and amongst
such as fear the Lord, God will him restrain, and rebuke the waster, and
destroyer, that the blessing of Abraham may be known.

But God is staining the glory of man, they which dwell in the Eternal, where
the glory of it is not seeked for, sees with the eternal light, how God has
stained, and does it stain daily, and so bring his glory to himself, and
brings man's honor and glory into contempt, we see it fades as the flower, and
withers as the grass, but the word of the Lord endures for ever, which the
Children of light delights in, and sees that to the wicked it is a hammer, to
beat down their pride, and it is as a sword to cut down their honor, and
lays it in the dust, and is as a fire, does b^^^^ them up, all the proud, and
them that do wickedly, for they are as the stubble; and though the fleshly
mind profess the letter, and call it the word, and call it the light, the
light they shall find to be their condemnation, and the word they shall find
to be as a hammer, and as a sword among them, and upon them, and as a fire to
burn them up.

Let this be publish^d abroad; for the cleansing of the Land of evil doers is
the Lord now come, and his Truth is he exalting, and Tares is known from
wheat, and chafe, and stubble which all is to be burnt with fire. Read and
understand every one with the life of God, that you may comprehend all the
powers of darkness, and the wiles, and temptations, and snares, with the life
and power that cannot be limited. Glory to the Lord God for ever.

Ye gazers, and mockers, and gluttonous ones, and drunkards, and evil beasts,
whose God is your belly, who mind earthly things, and lives in the lusts of
your own conceivings; who now say where is the time of his coming, and are
observers of times, but sees him not where he is manifested, and makes a mock
at his messengers, which are his witnesses, and stone them in your streets, and
casts them into holes and dungeons, corners and prisons, and houses of
correction, and whipping them, and beating them in your ma^kets stripping
naked, setting your dogs upon them and tearing their clothes, beating them with
cudgels and casting dirt upon them, who are made white through the blood of the
Lamb, and haling them out of your Synagogues before Magistrates and Counsels
and chief Priests, them which witness the everlasting Priest,

And here you are they that fulfill Christ's words, who said they should h^le
you before Rulers, and scourge you in Synagogues and Counsels, and Christ is
now manifest the same that ever was; and you are made manifest to be the
Generation to oppose him, who makes war against him; and the son of man now
raigns, Christ Jesus, amongst his children that learn of him, who hears the
Prophet that Moses spoke off, and every one that will not hear this Prophet is
to be cut off, and now many that will not hear this Prophet are numbered to the
sword. And you that deny the light that Christ Jesus has enlightened every man
that comes into the world withal that through him all might believe. So you
that deny this light which Christ has enlightened every one that comes into the
world withal, you do not believe, but calls it a natural light, who are in
your natural state and stumbleth at the Light, and are blind and led with the
blind, and so shall both go into the ditch; So Christ's Reign you know not
which receives not the Light which enlightneth every man that comes into the
world, that through him they might believe; So every one owning the Light which
comes from Christ, it will bring you to hear the true Prophet, and learn of
him, so with the Light you will come to see Christ Jesus Gods righteousness,
now you that do stumble and deny the Light which comes from Christ Jesus, which
is Gods righteosnesse, if you profess any righteousness (being in that state
driven from God) it is your own righteousness, though you may profess all the
Saints words and the Prophets and Christ's words and the holy men of God, and
deny the Light which comes from Christ, you stumble at Gods righteousness and
deny it that denies the Light which comes from Christ, which lightneth every
one that comes into the world, and are all found in your own Righteousness.
And you that deny that Christ Jesus is the Light of the world, and enlightens
every one that comes into the world, and do not own the Light, you are in your
will worships and all your worships are in your wills, and are to be condemned
with the Light, and so you be all in he state of wrath and darkness droven
from God, shut up in unbelief will worship and self righteousness your own
works, and are not yet come to own the Son of God, who lightneth every one that
comes into the world, that through him all may believe.

God who is light drove man from him, so he being in darkness and in the earth
and under the power of Satan, God sending his Son his Light, into the world,
which is the Light of the word, which lights every man that comes into the
world, that all men through him might believe, and learn of Christ, and hear
him who is the true Prophet; and he that does not believe in the Son of God,
the Light, is condemned already with the Light, for this is the condemnation
the light, says Christ Jesus; and he that hears not this Prophet shall be cut
off.

Also a Paper speaking of the two Seeds.
Dear Brethren and Sisters, in the visible life which has been hid from ages,
but now is made manifest in the Son by the revelation of his coming in this
life am I one with you, and does dearly sallute you all farewell.
Upon the first day of the week, being the 24th day of the 4 month, the word of
the Lord came unto me saying, thus says the Lord, If ye my dear children, whom
I have convine't by my pure Light in your consciences, will hearken to my
counsel and will stand in my fear, then shall my secrets be made known unto
you, and you shall grow up in the knowledge of me, as calves of the stall, and
my knowledge shall cover the whole earth, as the waters cover the Sea, and the
earth shall be removed out of its place; and the mountains under which my pure
seed suffers will I remove by my mighty power, says the Lord of hosts; and I
will raise up the mountain of my holiness, and establish it on the top of the
mountains, and ye shall become the glory of the whole earth, and ye shall be
called Sion, the City of the living God, the habitation of my holiness, from
whence my pure and righteous Law shall go forth, which shall cut down all the
unrighteous Laws made in the will of man, which are turned from my pure Light
in the conscience; and righteousness and truth shall k^sse each other, and run
down the Nations like a mighty stream; and violence and oppression shall cease,
and the rod of the wicked will I remove from off your backs, and their heavy
yoakes and bonds which have been made as bulwarks to keep my pure seed in
bondage, will I by my mighty power break in sunder, and the oppressed will I
set free, and the wild beasts of the field, which ye have long been a p^ey
unto, will I cause to cease out of your land, and you shall be no more a
rep^oach to the heathen says the Lord, but ye shall become a ter^our and a
dread to all your enemies, and I will mul^iply my blessings upon you, and will
establish my Covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David, and I will
write my pure Law in your hearts, and ye shall not depart from me, neither
shall you need to say to any man know the Lord, for ye shall all know me from
the least even to the greatest, and an open fountain will I be unto you, as
you abide in my pure fear, to cleanse you from your sins, and to refresh my own
in every one of you; and I will be unto you as the former and the latter rain
in its due season, and you shall sit under your own vine which is Christ in
you, and eat of your own fruit and none shall make you afraid, and ye shall be
my sheep and the flock of my pasture, and ye shall be no longer a prey to the
Idol Shepherds, who have sed themselves but not my flock, therefore will I
feed them with Judgment, and by my mighty power will I redeem you out of their
mouths, and I will be your alone Shepherd and you shall be my people says the
Lord of hosts.

And this is witnessed by many who have not thought their lives dear unto them,
but has freely given up to the death of the Cross, and has walked in
obedience of my pure Light in their consciences, contrary to their own wills,
and in these is my power known, and my glorious presence witnessed; and now
thus says the Lord, If ye who are convinced by my pure Light in your
consciences, and walk not in obedience to it, but slights my counsel, and cast
my Law behind your backs, and abide not in my fear, which would have kept you
out of all slavish fears, and will go on to uphold this filthy abominable
thing in my sight, in upholding with your outward estates a crooked viprous
serpentine Generation of Priests who devour the souls of the people for
dishonest gain, though you are convinced by my pure Light in your consciences,
that they ran and I sent them not, neither have they stood in my counsel but
have erred from my spirit, as their Father Balaam did, and because they have
unrighteous Laws m^de in the will of man for the upholding of their unrighteous
maintenance; which they with greediness do seek after, and where they cannot
have it there they bite and devour; and yet I, says the Lord according to my
promise made of old in love to your souls, have plucked you out of their mouths,
that ye should be no longer a prey unto them, and yet many of you for fear of
the unrighteous Laws, made in the will of proud flesh which is contrary to my
pure Law in the conscience, have consulted with flesh and blood, which shall
never enter in my rest, and so has cumbred your mind with fears and troubles
of what would come after if you should withstand them of what they call theirs,
being that they have a Law to compel us thereunto and we shall bring further
trouble upon our selves.

And hear the earthly mind that is not willing to suffer for my name sake
comes to be exalted and the will of man is bowed unto: and my pure seed which
boweth not unto the seed of evil doers, neither can uphold any deceit but
testifies against it, comes to to be betrayed into the hands of the murderer;
and now the witness* being slain you are at ease and can uphold the Idols
Temple and the Idols Shepherds and changeable Priests; and here the carnal
upholds the carnal, but my light which is eternal you are turned from, and
the hands of the wicked are strengthened by you, and you add afflictions to my
childrens bonds, who through faithfulness to me are made willing to suffer for
my names sake, the spoiling of their goods with joy, and to be cast into
dungeous and prisons for the testimony of a good conscience.

But ye who can conform and bow to the will of man, and stumble at the Cross,
and deal in hypocrisy, you are with my pure light by which my Saints are
perfected, to be judged and condemned, and I will rip off all your coverings,
says the Lord, which you in your earthly wills have made, to cover over your
deceipts withal. And you my dear children who have through ignorance upheld
them, Idol Shepherds with the carnal things, remember you have been warned
from me, says the Lord; see you uphold them no longer, for my hand is
stretched out against them* and by my mighty power will I bring them down, and
those that uphold them, therefore are you left without excuse, for at your
ignorance I winked at, but now by my pure light in your consciences, are you
convinced, that I the Lord am the sum of all figures, types, and shadows, and
all changeable things, and of the changeable Priesthood, and of the changeable
Temple for ye are my Temple says the Lord, and the habitation of my holiness,
whom I have separated and chosen by my power to place my name amongst you; and
I will be a Priest unto you, after the everlasting Order, and ye shall be Kings
and Priests, and shall reign over the earth, over the Beast and the false
Prophet; therefore my dear Lambs and Babes be bold and valiant for my truth
upon the earth, and contend earnestly for the faith which was once delivered to
my dear Children of old, your brethren the Prophets and Apostles, which has
passed before you, which was shamefully entreated by the wicked world,
therefore in my pure counsel stand and abide, and look not out at the
prosperity of the wicked, for by the red Sea of my wrath, and fierce
displeasure, will I destroy and consume all your enemies and oppressors, says
the Lord of Hosts; therefore rejoice and be glad ye righteous ones, and be
faithful to the Lord, for your redemption draws nigh.

Rich: Salle, Prisoner at Derby, writ to friends.

ALL you that have a set wages for reading the Scriptures, which was spoken
forth freely, Christ sent his Disciples to speak forth freely, and the words
which they spoke forth freely, do you make a Trade of, and have great sums of
money for, and the Apostles which writ the Epistles which was to be read among
the Saints, he charged them to read it by the Lord, and he did not say they
should have so much in the year for reading of it, for it was sent freely, to
be read freely; and the writing which was in the Revelations, was to be read
freely, which was sent to the Churches in Asia; they was not to have great sums
of money to read that which was written; and Jeremiah which was commanded to
write the Roll, which was to be read, he had not a great sum of money for it,
for they burnt it; and Moses which wrote the two Tables and the Law which was
to be read among the People, they had not so many hundreds a year for reading
of it; but oh what abundance do make merchandise of the Saints words? But let
these examples before that be mentioned, judge you all, to be such as are
greedy of filthy lucre, and through covetousness make merchandise of the
people, going in the way of Cain, after the error of Balaam, who perished in
the gain saying of Core, whose judgments of a long time lingers not, whose
damnation slumbers not; and there you may see your examples before mentioned.

FRiends, Had the Prophets, Christ, and the Apostles, when they were speaking
forth the Scripture if any spoke to them in their time, or asked them any
Question while they were speaking forth the Scriptures, a Law to send them to
Prison, and say they did disturb them? was they of such a perverse Generation
that spoke forth the Scriptures? by a Law did they cause them to suffer that
opposed the Prophets and the Apostles as you do, who does profess the words
that were given forth from them that were prisoned and contradicted; you with
your Law to prison them that witness the Life, and are in the Life that gave
forth the Scriptures; and with your Law holds up them: which has their words
but not their Life, as their fruits does make it appear; therefore some
examples, such as bear rule by their means, were cried against: with them who
were in the Life, and such as seek for their gain from their Quarter, and
such as are Hirelings, and seek for the fleece, and such as stands praying in
the Synagogues, and are called of men Masters, and has the chiefest seat in
the Assemblies, and such as sue men at the Law, which are not wise men: and
such as go in Cain's and Balaams way, such were cried against with the life
that gave forth the Scriptures, which used their tongues and said the Lord
says, when the Lord had not spoken to them: And such as have gotten the Saints
words, and talk of them for money, and must be maintained by a Law, and must
have a house maintained by poor people, when as the Life that gave forth the
Scriptures testified against such things, and now it comes to be made manifest,
what men you do hold up and justify.

FINIS.
