Delightful news to all loyal Subjects.
THe griefs and sorrows of both State and Parliament, have been almost
insupportable, the diff^rences betwixt the Parliament and his Majesty being the
ground, it being removed, how can it otherwise be, but that we shall have a
reformation (to our inexpressible joy) and removal of all obstacles that might
either hinder the propagation of the Gospel, (in which the happiness of this
State principally consists) as also for settling peace and tranquillity, and
giving every Subject (that are now cautious and fearful) encouragement with
alacrity to go about and exercise the employment belonging to every one of
their several callings: all these blessings are probably produced unto us, and
conferred upon us by this his M^jesties most royal assent, in granting his
subjects petitions (being for the benefit of his Kingdoms) and furthering
Parliamentary proceedings.

Our poor brethren in Ireland having a long time groaned under the burden of a
tyrannical and rebellious insulting enemy, whose barbarous cruelty and
inhumane butchery toward the Protestants there inhabiting, that they have not
only desired to root them out, and thereby to detain and take his Majesty's
Imperial dignity of that Kingdom, but proceed in massacring their bodies, to
the terror of all beholders. These things coming to the ears of the
honorable Houses of Parliament, whose judicious care resolving to find a
means to intervene and stop them in these their rebellions and insurrections
against his Majesty's regal power and authority, there presented themselves to
them in the mean time during the discussing of those affairs, diverse
Commissioners from his Majesty's Kingdom of Scotland, who as it were
sympathizing and bearing a fellow-feeling of their brethrens misery, proffered
their service for their aid and assistance against the Rebels; and withal
desiring the Parliaments favor therein, to assign over to them certain
places in that Kingdom to be a refuge for them as it were in time of
extremity; which the Parliament well weighing the reason and necessity of their
so expedient a request, with one accord assented unto, and withal writ a
petition, whereby to certify his Majesty, desiring his favorable assistance
therein, which notwithstanding was at that time denied, his Majesty being
thereto advised by some ill affected members, whose endeavors hindered that
present assent: But taking it into his more serious consideration, upon the
Parliaments further petitioning, he was pleased to grant unto the aforesaid
Scotch Commissioners, the Towns of Koock farges etc. after this grant his
Majesty being further petitioned to know who were those that gave him counsel
to deny the so reasonable Petition of the Scotch Commissioners, it was found
out that the Duke of Richmond, Mr. William Murray, and Mr. Endimion Porter,
belonging to his Majesty's bedchamber, Sir William Killegrey, Mr. Crofts and
Mr. Davis his Majesty's Barber, were all found tardy that way, whereupon they
were voted by the Parliament as incendiaries, and not fitting to have any place
of trust near his Majesty; therefore the Lords of the upper House, with the
House of Commons resolved to join in petitioning for the removal, and
thereupon some members of each house were sent to move him therein.

His Majesty was moreover graciously pleased upon mature deliberation
concerning the present estate of this Kingdom by reason of divisions, sects
etc. to move the Parliament for the settling of Religion, according to the
ancient order of Protestant Faith in Queen Elizabeth days, that all
delinquents, as well Bishops as others might come to their trialls, all
innovations and ceremonious superstitions (as should by this honorable House
of Parliament be thought fit) be expulst and utterly extinct, that thereby
there might be an unite and settled peace confirmed amongst his Subjects.

The Parliaments care for the King and Country, and for removal of grievances.
THE Parliament having with careful sedulity and indifatigable diligence
wrastled with the various distempers of the times and perils of this Kingdom,
and finding a malignant and impetuous enemy daily oppose them, who are the sole
and only obstacles and hindrance of their beneficial proceedinds (I need not
involve my self in a too mysterious description) I mean the Papists who like
foggy clouds strive to obscure the glorious Sunshine of the Church of England,
as also to derogate from the honor of Parliaments: And although they have
oftentimes conspired to subvert and dissolve, not only that illustrious
Assembly, but consequently the whole Kingdom, and not only this Kingdom but
that of Ireland likewise as is aforesaid; yet those famos Pillars of this Realm
now assembled have withstood their pernicious counsels, and dissipated their
designs; and as their inveterate malice has been most against this City of
London being the principal strength of this Kingdom, so the Parliaments
vigilance has been most for the security of the same: They have oftimes
intruded themselves to become the Kings favorites promising his Majesty all
fidelity and faithful loyalty to his Imperial Crown and roy all Dignity,
though indeed they did but flatter him in calumnious outshewes, for they are
the sole enemies that quotidianly strive rather to extenuate and diminish his
Crown then to maintain it, yet still they have sycophantized that they might
come to places of dignity and honor, and command in the City, so that by this
means they might the more easily bring their designs to maturity and
execution: Their plots had once almost come to a ripe perfection, when they had
gotten their arch conduct Lunsford to be Lieuetenant of the Tower.

The Parliament therefore taking these with many other like matters of high
consequence into their consideration as chiefly concerning the welfare of the
state, provided for the disarming of recusants, especially such as were of
power and of most ability to make resistance, as also for settling such offices
as were to be employed in matters of trust, choosing those whose former
demerits and virtues might challenge to them acceptance of such honors whose
endeavors have been peaceable, and laboring the propagation of Protestant
Religion, and the depressing of Papisticall superstitions, for the which they
have removed Officers as were formerly Captains of his Majesty's Forts and
Castles toward the sea, putting in such as were well affected by the Counties
whereas the Castles are, who best know their deserts, the putting their
souldery in a posture of warlike defense to the intent to avoid the danger of
innovations by a foreign enemy, lest they be surprised unawares, all which are
tokens of the Parliaments care toward this Kingdom, to the exceeding joy of
the Commons, and perpetual renown of both the honorable Houses, for whose
labors and endeavors all well affected subjects pray daily unto God to
bless, whose commands and good beginnings all are bound to further, and whose
works already finished, stand for a pattern of imitation to all worthy
successors that they may do by this example what may be for the glory of God,
accomplish all things for the honor of his Majesty, and setle all for the
peace and tranquillity of the Kingdom, Amen.

FINIS.
