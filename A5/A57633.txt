A Philosophical ESSAY for the REUNION OF THE LANGVAGES, OR, the Art of
Knowing all by the Mastery of one.

OXFORD Printed by HEN: HALL for JAMES GOOD. 1675.

The Printer to the READER.
MEeting by chance with this ingenuous offer, I thought it might not be
improper since I found it in another dress, to make it speak another Language
too, which among the most creditable of Europe, has not desisted from its
claim to Antiquity: There are very few Nations but have, at sometime or other,
laid in their pretenses to a supremacy for their Language, and have boasted an
assistance from unsuspected reason and Authority: But however variously the
controversy has been managed, the modesty, and ingenuity of this Author has
rendered, his design more plausible, for having without any private regard (in
such cases most usual to the spruc^ and flourishing Air of his own Native
tongue) made that noble Language of the Romans the Basis of his project; And
finding him throughout altogether free from prejudice and partiality, I thought
an anteview of so excellent and useful, a design would not be unacceptable to
the more ingenious part of the world, and that I ought not to neglect so fair
an opportunity of recommending to their consideration that illustrious dialect,
which as it is certainly of all others the most valuable, so to the shame of
these modern ages, is either exceedingly impaired or lost in its familiar uses
among those who challenge the title of the Beaux Esprits of the times. The aim
therefore of this Projector being to facilitate and expedite the Mastery of
this as well as others, its survey may possibly appear not altogether
ungrateful if it be but in hopes to find this encouragement that we shall be
able to reserve some number of years from our usually tadious application to
its study for other eminent uses, and commence men and Scholars at a much
easier rate and in an earlier age then now commonly practiced; I should prevent
the Author If I should entertain you with any farther commendation of it them
that he has taken for his model the most creditable and plausible Language of
the world. If at any time you divert your self with reading Novels; you will
here meet with notions that are both Philosophical and Airy, and in order to
the maine design for the most part purely scientifick and demonstrative; and
after If all you shall think that you have not misspent your time by observing
something that is either useful or pleasurable I shall have my design and the
Author the credit.

Farewell.
AS the Knowledge of foreign Languages ought not to be reputed one of those
vain and useless curiosities that serve only to amuse the mind, but is
certainly conducive to a thousand different ends; so we ought not to think it
strange if our age, which gives such aequall and secure judgment of the value
of things show more of passion then ever for it, notwithstanding all the
difficulties that are pretended. I am of an opinion, that one cannot do the
world a more acceptable piece of service, then to invent a certain and easy
way to become universally acquainted with the Languages, and to quit a subject
from those intrigues, in which the more knowing have at present involved it,
either from a pure impotence to disingage it, or possibly from a fond desire of
a freer breath of popular Air from those who are ordinarily most taken with
what they least understand.

This design being only a proper entertainment for the most critical of the
Virtuoses, I am the more inclinable to expose to the public, the project and
plain I have formed, before I entirely abandon the whole to their censure; that
I may at first anticipate all manner of reply, and take advantage from the
lights of the most accomplished and intelligent persons, if their zeal has
courage enough to make them willing to serve the world in their love and
communication.

The Authors design.
Most men being prepossest with two unjust prejudices against the nature of the
Languages, the one, that they have not all either resemblance or accord among
them, the other, that they only depend upon the inconstancy of chance, and the
whifling toyishness of custom, it might be thought no matter of extraordinary
concernment, if one pretended to succeed in a study of this nature by the
single efforts of the memory, without either the vivacitie of imagination, or
the force of reason being interress'd.

But being not very well persuaded of the agreeableness of this method, in
direct opposition to it, I have fastn'd the whole design in hand upon these
two propositions:

First, that there is a certain accord between the several Languages: and that
therefore they are attainable by comparison.

Secondly, they are unquestionably founded upon reason, and therefore that must
be made use of in their mutual reference. It is upon these two foundations
that I pretend to establish the true method of gaining a mastery of the
Languages, making it appear to the world by a sensible experience. that the
mind can as easily make reflections upon words, as upon the things they
represent: Imagination and Reason being the two faculties, that can reflect
upon their objects, they both will appear in the present design in their uses
suitable to their nature, the effects of Imagination shall be visible in the
several resemblances, and the inferences that are thence made; and it will be
the work of Reason to reduce all to certain principles, upon which the
argumentative part must rely.

The first part of the Design.
For the easier exercise of Imagination, I shall acquaint you with a method
that will appear very natural, by which instead of considering the Languages
precisely in themselves (as hitherto has been usual) they may be compared one
with the other without much difficulty, and at the same time their accord,
dependence, and mutual relation, discovered either from the resemblance of
words, the proportion of their scope or compass, and the conformity of their
expressions. It Is true that this agreement, and relation is not a little
obscured by the several od constitutions of men's minds, that checque at, and
satisfy themselves with the first, and naked appearance without any farther
inquiry; but withal its presently, and easily perceived by those who are
happy enough in a genius for such kind of Learning. Its something like the
paradoxes Geometry proposes upon the relation, and proportion of figures,
where we are mused at the first draught, and there appears so little
likelihood in them that the unexperienc't would take them only for the tricks
and whims of a melancholique brain; whereas an ingenuous Artist, from the most
natural, and simple notions gradually conducts the mind to a kind of
insensible discovery of truth, and makes it see on a sudden what it could not
expect, and that with such open assurances as quit that from all suspicion,
which but now had scarce any face of truth.

Knowing no other method then this, that may be proper to make new discoveries
in the sciences I endeavored to make what use I could of it, so far as my
subject permitted; And since amidst the several resemblances of the Languages,
there are some so evident, as necessarily grance upon the most unobserving eye,
I have so ordered my reflections, that by a reference to these, as models, I
might by degrees arrive at the knowledge of the others, which although
reserved, and sometimes more distanc't, yet are neither less certain, nor
real: not unlike the subalternate conclusions in speculation, which are not a
jot the less true for being farther removed from their first principle.

Thus it is that a Language with which we are already acquainted, either by the
assistance of Art, or Conversation, leads us to anintimacy with those that were
altogether unknown to us before, and that their relation redresseth the
treachery of the memory in the close and juncture of one with the other.

But that I may compass this my design with less trouble, my greatest care
is to make choice of one Language as a rule to measure by, and a principle to
reduce all the rest too: for to pretend to compare them immediately one with
another, as some would have it, is to cherish confusion among those things that
demand the most of order.

The veneration that I have always had for antiquity, made me think at first
of engaging for the Hebrew, as being (for ought we know) the earliest, the most
noble, and most natural Language of the world and that from which all others,
in a manner, derive themselves. But it was not long before I began to consider,
that this would directly cross the first principles of my intended method, and
appear a kind of endeavor to teach an unknown Language, by another, of which
we have the most imperfect, and slender information of all. The kindness, and
inclination I ought to have for my own Country, had almost persuaded me to rest
my self there, and to make my native tongue the basis of this universal
reduction but then the rest of the Europaean world (which I have no reason to
slur or contemn) would have as ill resented the project, as we did it in the
Germans, who would long ago have challenged this honor to themselves. I had
in the end no other course to take, but to throw my self upon the Latin, in
which I luckily met with all the necessary conditions that did easily, and
plausibly conduce to my designed attempt.

To say the truth Aristotle himself, a man of a judgment in such things the
most exact that ever was to take a measure from, demanded but three
qualifications, viz. Universality, Certainty, and Proportion; that it should be
generally known to all those that are to make use of it in the quality of a
measure, that it should be sixth, and determined in its self, and then that it
should be proportioned to all those things, to which it prescribes their
bounds, all which characters do with advantage combine in the Latin, and that
with such propriety that they cannot be attributed to any other without some
sort of injustice; for the greatest part of the other Languages they are
determind to the extent of a particular Kingdom or Country, the Latin has no
such disadvantage upon it; It is to speak properly the Language of Europe:
Religion, and the Sciences have more enlarged its dominions, then all the
conquests of the Romans, it is almost the common Idiom of the North, and
universally known to persons of birth and education, who alone are presumed
to stand in need of the assistance of foreign Languages.

It disownes the common imperfection of others, which by nature being subject
to change, cannot by consequence, serve for a certain determinate rule in all
ages; and if it now survive through the large extent of its entertainment, it
has much the advantage of others, that are in a manner deceased to this that
is fixed, and retaind by a well assured custom and if its being universally
known allows all persons to share its uses, so its being steady, and
unalterable, secures it from all the uneven changes of time.

As to its proportion, it in a manner keeps a mean between the Ancient and
Modern Languages, it is neither altogether so pure as the one, nor so corrupt
as the other, and so with the same ease is applicable to both; and in earnest
is infinitely the most compendious, it being far less trouble to pass from
the mean to an extreme, or from the extreme to the mean, then to trace it from
one extreme to another. However this would seem incommodious beyond all
redress, to attempt to reduce all the Languages, either to the most ancient,
or else to any one of the most modern, because in reality, the former have no
more relation to the later, then these have with others of the same age, which
have been as so many channels to derive Antiquity to us.

Besides the Latin makes a friendly meeting between the Eastern, and Western
Languages; as to the first alone it owes its birth and rise, so the others do
to it.

It seems then no more difficult to attain the one, by streaming it up to the
fountain, then to gain all the rest by making a like descent, by way of
resemblance to what we observe in nature when we discern, as well the effect by
the cause, as the cause by the effect. In one word, to make up all the
differences that may arise about the supremacy of the Languages, I consider
the Latin under three different regards, as the daughter of the Languages of
the East, as the Mother of those in the West, and as the Sister of the more
Northern.

As it is abundantly copious, and rich, having been refind, and improved for
more then 3000. years by an infinite variety of nations, with whose spoils it
is now invested, so it may have a very great number of resemblances, under
which with little difficulty it will admit of a reference to all the rest. For
in conclusion, to reduce all to the most refined, and polite Language, is not
what I pretend to; the Barbarous style of the ancient Romans will do me as much
service, as the quaintness, and elegance of Cicero; the Latin of the declining
Empire, since the irruptions of the Northern Nations, may be admitted into this
design to as good purpose, as the language of Augustus his time; any sense is
the same of that of the Sciences, which makes one almost altogether distinct
from what is common and vulgar; the proper names of Philosophy, natural
History, and Divinity, those of Physic, and the Mathematics, of Arts, Law,
and Commerce; the names of illustrious persons, people and places, of which
History furnishes us with a plausible account, will afford me no less
assistance on this occasion, then the names of things that are most common.

After having made choice of a Language in order to the design, I am in the
next place to determine my self to a certain number of them, the reunion of
which may be justly thought a modest and reasonable attempt; for as there are
some, the knowledge of which will be of very little use; so I am obliged to
prescribe some bounds to a design that would lead me to something
indetermin'd, and infinite, and withal I suspect the enlargement both of mind,
and memory to compass all; especially considering the consequence of some to
be indifferent, neither that of Biscany, nor the lower Brettaigne should in my
opinion much afflict any man's brain, nor do I believe that there are many more
in the world interes't for them, then there are for the dialect of Finland or
Frizland, or the Barbarous jangling of the Negroes and Savages. In the choice
that I was to make I could not but give the preference to those of the greatest
credit and repute, took some Prince (excuse the allusion) who having laid his
design to reunite all the Kingdoms of the world, began his conquest upon those
Nations that were most formidable and renowned, from an apprehension that the
rest in a little time would be less able to make any opposition.

As I am not of an humor to attempt any thing without an encouragement from
reason, or to give my self any trouble through a kind of caprice, purely to
gratify my curiosity; Religion, State, and the Sciences are the three grand
rules from which I make a judgment what Languages are really the most
important and noble; I have only therefore selected such as Europe may use to
the best advantage, either for the defense of the Church, the good of the
State, the advancement of the Sciences, or the perfection of the most laudable
Arts. It is for this end that I have entertained in my design all the
Languages that concern Religion, and make a particular mention of such as
furnish us with original texts, and the most authentic translations of the
Bible, being of no means consequence toward the faithful interpretation of
our sacred Records, and the confirmation of the Articles of our Creed.

I am in the next place obliged to find a place for such as concern and relate
to State affairs, the most renowned E^pires, Kingdoms, and warlike Nations,
which may afford a suitable entertainment for all sorts of people, and withal
very much conduce to the succesful management of foreign business, the most
important negotiations, Embassies, the transactions of war or peace, as well as
the most hopeful designs of travelers. But above all I find my self
concerned for those that give us the most refined and polite discoveries of wit
and Science, and have been cherisht and nursed up to our hands by the most
knowing and ingenious of all Nations.

I can hardly believe I shall meet with any inclinable to quarrel me for the
number of 24. that I have thought on for my design, since I presume it no
easy matter for the most nicely curious to find a just occasion; and although
there are none of them that are not unquestionably derived from the same
original, it being no great difficulty to convince any well settled head, that
in the propriety of speech there is but one mother Language: Yet to avoid
confusion I distribute them all into 7. different orders, as they seem to carry
an immediate reference to the Languages, which are the commonly supposed
originals: such are in the opinion of the Learned the Roman, and the Greec, the
Teutonic and Sclavonic, the Hebrew, Scythian, and the Persian.

The Roman Idioms are the Italian, Spanish and the French, which cannot now be
unknown to any but such as are shamefully ignorant; I may add likewise the
Portuguese, which although not very different from the Castilian, yet is not
wanting in its own particular beauties, and has received no mean accession of
use and honor from the conquests of its Kings in the most remote parts of the
world.

To the Greec I shall reduce its 3. principal relations, viz the Literal
Greec, such as we meet with in our old Classic Authors, the vulgar, as it is
commonly used since the declining age of the Empire at Constantinople, and the
Coptique or Egyptian, which is but a remainder of the famous government of the
Ptolomies in Egypt: for although in its idiome there be something yet
remaining of an original stamp, either in that its words seem to touch upon
the ancient Language of the Pharaous, or that its inflection no way resembles
the Greec, yet the Empire of Alexander and his successors induced such a
confusion, that the Greec has almost got the better, and involved all the
lesser remains of Antiquity.

Under the Teutonic I comprehend the Almain or high German, the Flemmish or low
Dutch, the English and the Danish, which is to this day entertained in the most
Northern regions, and may give us some intimations of a clearer light then any
besides, as having yet carefully secured some footsteps of the ancient Language.

The Sclavonic is accompanied with 3. more considerable dialects the true
Sclavonic, the Polish, and Muscovitish, to which the valor of the Nations that
speak them have brought more reputation then any other ingenious performances.

The Hebrew has no less then seven in its retinue, the pure Hebrew, such as we
meet with in our Bible, the Language of the Rabbis and Talmudists, the
Chaldee, the Syriaque, the Aethiopick or Abyssin, the Samaritan, and the
Arabique, which in our age has so enlarged its dominion, that its either spoke
or understood in the three parts of the Old World Asia, Africa and Europe; and
has alone produced such a prodigious number of books, that one would scarce
believe how a Nation so famous for its exploits in war should have so much
leisure to attend to the improvement of learning.

The Scythian has two very illustrious dialects in its train, the Turkish and
lesser Tartarian, both which may serve in some measure to acquaint us what
Languages are used in the North of Asia.

The last is the Persian, whch is not only universally prized in the Empire of
the Sophy, but a common entertainment in the Court of the grand Seigneur, as
well as in that of the Mogull, where it is hugely valued and esteemed.

As this reference of the Languages to one another would be to little purpose,
if the less qualified and accomplished were not capable of judging of it, since
it is for them principally I am most concerned, I believed therefore it would be
necessary entirely to retrench all that strange variety of characters, whose od
and fan^^sticall figures do strangely divert the imaginations of those, who are
not well qualified to conceive them. Neither do I intend to humor my self in
that vain kind of ostentation that some affect, to make this kind of writing
one of that most mysterious parts of their learning, but have found out a
method of expressing the sounds of all the distinguishing characters of each
Language only by the Roman, and that in a manner as easy and disengaged as it
is accurate and new; insomuch that the resemblances of words, which altogether
disappeared under those uncouth figures (which like a veil intercepted them
from the less clarified eye) presently face the light, there being nothing left
to interpose between them, and a closer consideration, which notwithstanding
shall not acquit me from my design of discovering an expedient to decypher
with ease all those several kinds of writing, and of fixing them upon the
imagination in such a manner as without difficulty can admit of no confusion.

After having removed this first obstruction, which has so long imbroild and
retarded the knowledge of the Languages, that I may with less trouble reduce
them to their first principle, I shall run near the same course, that has been
successively taken in their removal, so far as any history can inform us,
upon which I principally lay the stresse and basis of my design by producing
such arguments from it, the force of which cannot plausibly be eluded. For I do
not believe that any of the more curious will find fault with me for fastening
the origin, and alliance of the Language upon the same bottom with the
beginning and first society of mankind, who are observed never to shift their
Country, without having their Language to bear their Arms and Customs company.
As I never thought fit to dispute it with the Learned, why they did not make
use of the affinity of the Languages, which sometimes are of clearer notice to
them to discover the the first rise of a people more remote, and with which
they are less acquainted; So I hope I may be permitted to make what advantage
I can of the first combinations and colonies to give a clearer light to the
beginnings and connection of the several Tongues, there being something near
the same, or a like proportion between both: as for instance, To make good the
opinion of Dionysius Halicarnasseus, and Quintilian, who both pretend that the
Latin tongue is no more then a Dialect of the Ancient Greek, is but in plain
and easy words to give an account of all the little settlements, and
Plantations in Italy, which for some continuance of time was only inhabited by
colonies from Greece.

Upon what other terms I hardly understand this new project should be
surprising to any, it being not the mere effect of imagination, or an humorous
Idea, neither will it much engage any sort of people, but only such as can
easily dislodge their prejudices when their own lights shall assist in their
conviction, and that from such assurances as shall be most free from suspicion,
being faithful deductions from the histories of the Colonies. But as it is
impossible that the Languages should not be liable to several alterations and
mixtures from the different associations of people in several removes, so
neither is it to be believed that this was done all on a sudden; there seems to
be a recemblance between the words that make up the Language and Travesilers,
who do not put off their accustomed usages and manners so soon as they arrive
at a new Country, neither are they naturalized, but with time and by degrees
become masters of the Air, humors, and qualities of the persons with whom they
converse.

Since then this corruption is but of a graduall and intensible growth, there
is a necessity, for its more certain discovery, of an orderly reflection upon
the very first beginnings of the differences, being in the interim very
sollicitous to prevent a false retreat that might either engage me too far, or
else in some unluckie circumstances, from which it would be no little
difficulty to retire. And this seems to be the only way that I could find out
to scatter a certain Air and appearance of truth upon all that regard the
present subject, which has no farther a probability then what is given it from
such a careful mannagement, that shall suffer no pass from one extreme to the
other without touching upon that mean which is as it were the time of
communication between both, for it is from this chain of words and sequel of
alterations that all the suitableness, and likelihood of this present method
principally depends.

Although in reality there is no reason to doubt but that the French is a
corruption of the Latin, I could not however very easily persuade my self
that the word dechoir should derive its self from cadere of the Latins, if I
did not perceive all its several and distinct conveiances through the Alembic.
They that first corrupted the Language of the Romans instead of cadere made use
of cader, as the Italians do to this day, who commonly cut off the final vowels
where they obseve them to follow Liquids. They that came after proceeded yet
farther in their retrenchment, and from cader formed caer, as the Spaniards now
use it, by taking away the letter d according to their ordinary custom, when
it is seated in the middle of words. There are another sort of people yet more
sturdy and blunt in their forms of speech, who would say Car or Ker by a
contraction of the two Vowels into one, as is observable among the Peasants of
France, and those of Picardy, who retain very much of Antiquity, which seems to
be agreeable with the manner of speech among the Ancient French, who delighted
to shorten and contract their words as much as possible, that they might make
up a Language altogether as free as their humor; some of the most remote of
these would instead of Ker pronounce Cher by a change of that firm and surly
letter into one more easy and soft as we yet find it Customary in the remains
of some of the Ancient Romans, and then after all by the turn of a Vowel into a
Dipthong, from Cher is formed Choir, which now begins to be out of date although
its Composit dechoir be still of plausible and commendable use. Thus it is that
Cadere, Cader, Care, Car, Ker, Cher, Choir, and Dechoir make up but one entire
chain and connection, yet all to very little purpose if any one of the degrees
by chance should have been wanting.

For this reason although I consider every Language in its greatest perfection,
yet for clearing its original in rendering this sequel of words more open and
palpable I have been obliged to make numerous reflections upon the older forms
of speech as well as Orthographie, by which a better discovery may be made of
all the varieties that occure in pronunciation, as also of the several medlies
and Gibrish of the Provinces of Each Empire that speak the same Language, but
most of them in a singular fashion.

So that it is most certain that that Language which is most quaint and polite
is very often the less, pure and most debaucht, if we make an acquall judgment
from its original which is the most unquestionable rule: Upon which account
the dialects of Province, Gascogne, Languedoc, and that which is known by the
name of the Ancient Gauls is infinitely less altered and distanc't from its
original, then the Languages of the Court and Nobility, who take a pleasure in
receding from the Latin: Those of Lombardy and Naples are for the most part
less corrupt than these of Siena and Florence; Although the Spaniards have a
saying among them, that the Catalonian and that of Arragon is commonly more
pure then the Castilian that is more Pompous. And not to spare the French more
then the Spaniard, if they have reason to boast their Language to be the most
refined and Polite of the world, yet their Neighbors might justly return upon
them, that of all the Dialects of the Latin, there is none more degenerate than
theirs, forasmuch as its quaintness arises from its sweetness, so that it is
not attainable without a strange descent from its principle. Thus le Capo of
the Italians, le Cabo, of the Spaniards, le Cap, of the old French and le Kef
of Picardy are all variously alterd from Caput of the Latins, but none so much
as le Chef of the French, which notwithstanding claims the same Original.

But this is not all; as the resemblance and connection of the Languages is not
always the same but depends more or less upon the communication of the
Nations that speak them, So it is not necessary that this method should be
invariable, it must admit of alteration with its subjects, and accomodate it
self to the diversity of Tongues.

There is much more of Art required to reduce those which only carry a
resemblance in their words, and abundantly less for those which withal admit
of an analogy in inflexion, And Since the same words which allow of this
accord may have it in several distinct manners they are not all (if I may be
permitted to say so) neither of Kin, nor alliance in the same degree; their
relation is sometimes nearer, Sometimes at a greater distance, for we may by
way of analogy discourse at the same rate of the genealogy of words as we do
of the degrees of consanguinity; for if the one fort be ranged under the same
Line either direct or Collateral, the others admit of a little deflection and
do not exactly corespond; some are allied in the first, some in the 2d degree,
some in advancing from the branches to the stock, others in a descent from that
to the branches, in a word this accord is neither always immediate nor at all
directly opposite.

I add besides that as there are, some allied two or three ways and that since
the first division have contracted new and closer relations, so I confess
there are others that content themselves with their Original reference, and
that have scarce any other agreement among them than what depends upon the
common tie and union that they have with their first principle, which in
reallity is no more then this famous Mother Tongue of which some make a mystery
without well understanding what they say: For although it has subsisted in its
self before the first confusion, yet we must not think of discoursing of it at
the same rate, nor put our minds upon the harasse of receiving it.

It Is no more now as some fondly imagaine a particular and distinct Language
from others, so that there is but one way to regain it and reestablish it at
least so far as is necessary for a complete execution of my design, and that
is to make a judicious choice of all that is primitive and most simple among
the Remains of the ancient Language either by considering the first
combinations of sounds or by a regard to the earnest ideas of the mind, that
were applied to these sounds; to the end that we may referr thither by a
sequel, all the essential and fundamental words of each Language as to their
fountain; which admiting of divisions, runs now in lesser streams which
assume the names of Originalls; because they have their rise from that grand
Source where the first inhabitants of the world ingrost all. So that it may be
truly said of this Mother Tougue that it is in no sense a part as being really
every where either in sums of its divisions, or in its effects and dependances
something like your virtues of the elements and the original seeds of things,
that Subsist not of themselves but in the mixtures that compose them.

I shall possibly be wonderd at, that being able to accomplish all by this
single method, I have not in the interim recours to it, when all other ways
prove unserviceable; But after all, tho this method be perhaps more ingenuous
and of a more profound speculation, it is not however the most natural and
compendious, be it never so refind'd or accomodate to my design, and I hardly
understand the reason why any man should affect a crooked and uncouth road to
active at his purpose when the straight lies before him.

The second part of the desine.
Comparison alone is not (in the opinion of some) sufficient to accomplish the
present intention, however accurate it be; if it want the supports of reason,
it may rationally be suspected for being more airy then solid, and without
injustice the same character may be given to some of those unusual Chances
that sometimes produce the most surprising effects. Besides although the vivacity
and force of imagination be easily admitted into the relations of the
Languages, and leaves there forcible impressions, yet it neither warrants
certitude, nor dislodgeth confusion; it is reason alone that establishes the
mind in its cognizances, and credits all its conceptions with order, it is that
alone which perfects the combination of all their relations and agreements
according to the natural connection which they have with the same principles on
which they depend in Common.

That which seems to be of greatest moment is that the principles be plausible
and rational and such as man may lay a stress on without suspicion or fear,
and this is that which in a singular manner the principles of this Art
challenge to themselves, being in my opinion infinitely more sensible then
those which Philosophy proposes under the characters of uncontroleable truths;
I have therefore taken them all from the very natures of the subject of which I
am treating viz: from the deflections and different regards under which the
consideration of words may be managed; which may last of all serve for an
assurance, that chance has not all that Empire and authority, that is given it
over the Languages; and that it would be no great difficulty to make it appear,
that in the Languages themselves there are well framed and solid reasons, for
every thing that appears otherwise, and has been hitherto supposed to be the
bare effect of Caprice.

It may be perceived by the very effects themselves that it will make up a
science fully demonstrative, and backed with such consequences, as may very
well pass for complete models in this kind: And above all the scope of its
principles infinitely shortens the way without being at all obliged to make a
descent to a thousand taedious and wearisome differences; which appear much
better, and in a more elegant manner in their principles then in themselves,
which is an encouragement for me to hope that a Language for the acquest of
which we have formerly by a close application numbered several years, will by
this means be made the divertisement of some hours, or at most but some few
days.

Words being in the opinion of all men but significant sounds, they may be
taken either as they are Natural sounds, or arbitrary signs, I would say,
either as they are the proper effect of the motion of our organs, or as the
lively representation of the thoughts of our minds. And since they make their
passes from one Language to another they cannot well admit of any alteration in
this their transit but in three respects; for whatsoever change be supposed it
will necessarily fall out, either in the sounds themselves that compose the
words, or in their significations, or in their different modifications, and its
from these three distinct regards that the general principles have their rise,
upon which I have fastn'd this new Systime of the Philosophy of the Languages.

That I may make my procedure more justificable and artificial, I examine with
all exactness the different organs of the voice, the various motions of the
muscles belonging to these organs, and the admirable concent and accord of
those motions; and these I make use of to demonstratively explain the precise
number of all the simple sounds, that enter into the composition of the
Languages, to discover the nature and proper pronunciation of these sounds, and
by consequence to disclose their nearness and affinity, the resemblances of
some, and the disproportion of others, their accord and opposition, their
Sympathy and Antipathy, in a word, all their combinations and mixtures, their
divisions and distinctions, their orders and several degrees. From whence I
conclude that all the astonishing and surprising depravations and Corruptions
that are met withal in the words that one Language borrows from another, in
changing or in transposing, in adding or retrenching, have their basis in
nature; which never attempts any thing but to the purpose, and with a
sollicitous care, when to us it appears to have acted with an open and
observable neglect.

We may Study Nature upon the Latin it self which may serve as well for a
model as it does for a principle; It will in the first place acquaint us that
the Vowels are almost accounted for nothing, for although there are some of them
that admit of easy changes among themselves according as they are more open
or reserved, we know nevertheless that there are none of them but what may be
absolutely shifted into the place of another of what kind soever, either
immediately, or by succession and degrees. For a final confirmation of this we
have no more to do but to make an easy comparison of the different derivative
of the same word, the reference of these three Cepa; incipio and occupo, to the
Verb Capio may serve for an instance, if we shall but grant the truth of this
principle which the orientalists have always supposed, who form the greatest
part of their words from the sole change of their Vowels.

The same is not altogether allowable in relation to the Consonants, where we
must not admit indifferently all sorts of changes; the sole affinity of the
Organs is that which must regulate almost all their varieties: the Labiall
letters easily supplant one another but the Dentall or Linguall with more
difficulty succeed them as being not of the same order; For as these
consonants, M. B. P. V. F. make near the same sound, which is modified by the
diverse force of the Air, opening the lips after several forms. So the Letters
D. T. Z. S. ought to make an order by themselves, having a particular relation
to the point of the tongue, which only by touching upon the teeth in various
manners frame their pronunciation.

But it is not a single and easy reflection, that can absolutely determine
whether two letters have resemblance and proportion, because there are some of
them that being made up of the movements of several organs, may be differently
altered according to their various resemblances, so the letter H. carrys not
only the resemblance of a gutturall as it is pronounced by the assistance of
the muscles of the throat, but also as an Aspiration besides the regard it has
to the whispers of the tongue, and the 6. Aspirates of the Lips, Teeth, and
Palate. However if the precipitance or forwardness of any, has by chance
brought into use, other methods of altering sounds, as they have not so certain
a foundation in reason, so neither can they be received within the Compass of
this Art, at least being not established by a regular and constant analogy.

From the sound of words, I pass to their signification, which in the same
dialect may be called the soul of a word, as the sound is its body; to express
it in other terms, then what seem to relish the dry and unpleasant humor of
the Pedant or Grammamarian; I suppose that words being the expressions of our
thoughts, and our thoughts the representations of objects, the different
significations that are given to words, principally depend upon the various
conceptions, that every Nation frames of the same objects, agreeable to what
seems most nearly to concern it.

This ingageth me to explain the entire sequel, and natural dependances of
our Ideas, and the manner of their forming, of which the world has yet
received a very imperfect account. In order to this, you may understand what
those objects are, of which we have proper Ideas, and what those are which we
conceive by foreign images, and that we do not name but in figurative terms;
whence arises that alliance and resemblance of our Ideas, and why the greatest
share of our words if referred to their first original, are but metaphors which
represent objects to us in such terms as are proper to another, with which it
hathsome agreement, or near relation, and withal what are the grand
principles of metaphors; either of Attribution or Proportion, that do not only
make up the beauty, but almost the entire body of the Language.

Our Ancestors that gave no names to things, but by a directing prudence,
purposing to distinguish the works of Nature and Art, had an especial regard
to the natural resemblance they had with any thing that was most known to
them, and that was already distinguished by its character, or to any one of
their most prevailing properties, or to the principal action that distinguished
them from other beings. They made use of almost the same artifice, to impose
names upon things more expressive of their properties, by considering them only
with reference to their operations, of which they were the immediate
principles. As for the operations, themselves being not aequally known, nor
aequally obvious to sense they placed the same subordination in the terms they
made use of to represent them, that Nature has established in our apprehensions
and cognisances.

There being therefore nothing in the world of which they could have framed a
more distinct Idea, then of the motion of bodies; which is obvious to all the
senses, we must nor wonder if considering Local motion as the first and
principal object of their knowledge, they afterward gave no names to the
Operations of each being, but such as seemed to express some relation either to
motion in general, or to its different species, or to some one of its
dependances, such as are place, figure, situation, extention, Union and
separation, in a word to all the resemblances and agreements that in any way or
kind rely upon motion. For if Modern Philosophy that Studies Nature by a
closer application then formerly, pretend to a clear and evident explication of
Natural effects in the referring them all to the Sole movement of matter as
their true cause; there is much more reason that in order to the giveing an
account of all that is to this day past among the Languages, we should have
recours to such terms as are expressive of motion, since it is not to be
doubted but that all others that are reducible, may be referred hither as to
the first principle of their signification.

Besides motion is allowed a far greater Scope and extent among the Languages
then in Nature for it is to that we referr our most refined and spiritual
conceptions I mean such as we frame of the operations of our souls and the
propensions of our wills, So when we say that the mind or understanding applies
it self to think to conceive, to discourse, to explain to disimbroile to
disingage a business, to discover a truth; when we talk of troubles,
aversions, of hurries and consternations of the soul, to express such actions
as are most remote from sense, we make use of such Images as are corporeal in
their first original, although for the most part they have lost their proper
significance to assume another that is purely figurative.

It Is by these Principles Ireduce to natural reason all imaginable ways by
which words alter their primitive signification to embrace another, either more
enlarged or reserved, or never so little diversifi'd either in Proportion or
Alliance; for it is no easy matter for words to travel from one Country to
another without meeting with the same casualties, that use to befall foreign
Plants which are seldom removed into a new soil, but degenerate and either
lose some of their Native virtue, or acquire some new. But most people having
met with this general proposal, to express at first appearance, what they
think with as little trouble as is possible, it thence falls out that to
ingrosse a great deal of sense in few words, they scarce allow enough precisely
to mark out the simple ideas of their minds, fitted out to all their several
resemblances, they that are most simple in themselves, are commonly compounds
in their significations, neither is there any one of the least considerable,
but what is diversified in each Language by a thousand different modifications.

From thence proceed all the methods of inflexion, derivation, and composition
that give being to the most subtle kind of Sophistry; all the species and forms
of Nouns, Verbs, and particles that make up the aeconomy of a Language,
together withal diversity of Numbers, Genders Cases tenses Modes, and Persons
which have more of Art than at first sight is imagined, for the Custom of
Nations has not only authorized these inventions to vary the Cadence of words,
but with an admirable facility to express all the deflexions, by which an Idea
of the same object may be represented to our conceptions according as it
admitts of a mixture of resemblances, which it may have either to its effects
or Causes, or as it is related to the several estates, wherein it subsists, to
the differences of time or place, and to all the circumstances that may
accompany it, either within or without us. As the more sensible differences of
the Languages principally consist in all these modifications; so one of the
greatest, secrets of this Art is to know how choisly to select and distinguish,
both in our ideas and in the words that express them, that which is principal
and essential from what is purely accessory, subtly to difference the first
ideas from the second, the second from the third, the simple from the Compound,
the primitive and Original signification from its dependances and references,
its modifications and diverse restrictions, in one word (if I may so express
it) not to confound the habit with the person. For in a manner these
modifications are the same words, that the habit is to the body; this new
dress that is given to foreign words to fit them up alamode to the Country,
for the most part time so disfigures them and renders them so obscure, that
they impose as well upon our eyes as ears, and pass for originalls and Natives
of the Country, although in reality they are borrowed from our Neighborhood,
and sometime from beyond the seas.

To make a secure judgment therefore of the original, there remains nothing
but to consider them all, naked and entirely disspoil'd of all that trompery
that disguised them; and that this may be done with more safety we must follow
them step by step in their travels, and epsy out the different ranges they
have taken and the habits they have shifted, to come thus vizarded and masqued
to us.

These are the most enlarged principles and infallible ways by which I discover
this secret and misterious accord of the Languages which without doubt will
appear so much the more admirable, as having been never to this hour been
believed that they had any such close tie or relation: But these principles may
be applied several ways, and therefore least they should continue undermined,
I make it appear by the sequel, what in particular must be done in each
Language in conformity to its genius and proper Character, This is that which
obliges me to make an exact inquiry into the nature of those Languages I
pretend to reduce, I do not content my self infallibly to take my draught
either in the general consent of nations, which are as often cheated in their
Ideas they have of the Language of each Nation as they are commonly in its
manners, or from the particular sentiments of the more knowing or Learned, who
without any preoccupation of mind have studied their own Native Language with
more then ordinary care. But to make all yet more certain, I principally form
my examinations from the very history of the Languages, which is the most
aequall rule we can take our measures from, in relation to the present design.

In order to this, it is necessary that we make reflections upon the first
beginnings of each Nation, and that from other memoires then such with which we
are for the most part furnished by the Critics, and seriously to examine the
continual comerce it has had with the most considerable of its neighbors,
the wars, feuds and Leagues of its Governors with other Princes, the
irruptions and invasions of Conquering Nations, that have corrupted its
Language as they ingrost its spoils, the frequent Colonies that Conquerors have
sent thither besides its voyages at Sea, and its traffic, with the most remote
plantations, These are the more immediate causes of this confusion and mixture.

It may perhaps withal be no mean pleasure to see the basis of each Language
distinguished from the changes and accessions of time or revolutions of State,
what every Nation has contributed of its own to enrich it, what Religion, the
Government and what Sciences have communicated to it, what it retains of
Antiquity and what new acquests it has made to retrieve its losses with
advantage.

Afterall, this is yet but the sceleton, or at most but the body of a Language,
Its necessary that this rude and indigested mass made up of so many different
dialects should be animated by some secret spirit that should expand it self
through all its parts and several members, and reduce them to unity by
communicating the same air to them, and that this Spirit or Soul should be the
individual principle of all the effects, and sensible changes, which make us
easily distinguish one Language from another: The Temper, Humor, and Nature of
a people, the dispositions of their minds, their genius and particular gusts,
their more general and forcible inclinations, their ordinary passions, and
such singular qualities, by which one Nation is remarq'd and distinguished from
another, are the most evident signs to discover the true genius of a Language,
because they are in reality the immediate causes, and the very originalls after
which I have copied all my draughts to complete the present piece, which in my
opinion is not wanting in something that is very Natural, Besides this, the
very manners and customs of Nations, their Laws and policy, and their public
transactions, both of peace and war, are things so universally known, that
there is no need of any farther search, how to be bale to judge by proportion
of the genius, and characters of the Languages so securely, as by that of the
people that speak them.

But as the care of a Nation to improve and advance the Arts and sciences and
other kinds of good Learning, is that which contributes most to the perfection
of its Language, So it is upon the manner in which its received, and the
characters of its Authors, that I chiefly depend to determine, whether it be
modest or imperious, whether it relish more of a softness, sweetness, and
delicacy, than of a certain Noble brisque and generous air, whether it incline
more to the simplicity of Nature, or the subtle refinements of Art, whether it
be polite to affectation, or betray a certain negligence which has its graces
too, as well as its measures of Art, and last of all whether it be not a little
crampt in attempting to be too exact, or else better accomodate it self by its
freedom from all restraint.

Having discoverd the genius and proper character of each Language, I have
framed the most perfect Idea that is possible, by way of analogy with the
principles of the Platonists, with whose method I was always as much taken as I
am dissatisfied with their doctrine.

This Idea being unmasqued serves me in the sequel for a general rule, to
establish the true and proper reasons of all that pass for singular and
remarqueable in each Language, either in relation to the choice, the mixture,
and union of sounds, the force and significations of words, or the Air and
manner of expression; For it is most certain that all these things are altered
according to the genius of a people: So the Spaniards would distinguish
themselves from other Nations by their haughtiness, and affected gravity, and
their words are easily understood by a certain pompous Air, that seems to
border upon grandeur and Majesty: On the Contrary the Italians are the Nation
of the world that seems to be most fond of its pleasure, and its natural, that
this softness should be communicated to their Language, and that all their
words should breath nothing, but what is sweet, polite, and the most exact
harmony; their compositions admit of no sounds but such, as can slatter the
Ear, they suffer not the concours of consonants, whose rudeness may never so
little offend the Organ, but they are extremely in Love with Vowels, and often
allow their sequences to make their pronunciation more sweet and delicate. For
their signification, that they might mix an accord with their energie, they
have hardly any but what are more or less figurative, from a persuasion, that
a Metaphor represents objects to the mind in that most curious and diverting
manner, and withal they are careful to make choice of none, but such as
represent the fairest images: They are no less sollicitous to diversifie their
words by agreeable modifications, their inflexion has very little uneasy in
it, it is all of it aequally facile and gay; their diminutives are exceedingly
rellishing, because there is something more than ordinarily pretty in them,
they are rich in derivatives, and compounds, not only because their
pronunciation is more harmonious, but also because they express themselves in
a more natural manner, In one word they banish every thing that may appear
ungrateful, and are passionately in quest of all that may conduce to the
Sweetness of their Language.

My sense is much the same of other Languages, but because reason it self may
be suspected by some, especially if at any time it appear too just or
plausible, I was the rather concerned so to order my instances, that besides
the induction, I intended custom and experience should support reason, and
reason should confirm experience, and withal the examples are so naturally
chained with their principles, and all of them so distributed in their proper
places, that without so much as making the least reflection, I imperceptibly
comprize all the fundamental and essential words of each Lauguage, being
willing my self to draw all my conclusions from the principles I have
mentioned, and to make all necessary inductions, without leaving any thing of
trouble or disease to the reader, who in such cases is glad to be quitt from
pains and inconvenience, I have some hopes, that a composition thus
differently made up of History, reflections and Criticismes supported by
principles, deductions, and examples may contribute something to the
agreeableness of the design, and let off a subject that of it self is dry
and knotty enough, without making it more unacceptable by that mean and
disreputed method, that has so much decry'd the Critiques, and ordinarily has
given a disgust to a science before it has been allowed the least
consideration, besides that didacticque way, is by no means proper in the
present case, for as there is little pleasure in being taken notice of under
the character of a Scholar, so the only remedy is to contrive some way to come
to the knowledge of things without lying under the suspicion of having a master.

Thus you see in gross and general, the whole design expressed in as few words
as the brevity of the subject would permit me; And However rational it may be
in it self yet it wants not its adversaryes; Some with a great deal of heat,
plead that if this method acquiring the Languages, has any thing in it that is
Curious by way of speculation, it is however useless enough in relation to its
practice, since Custom and Conversation only (say they) is the great Master of
Language, and that we must entirely rely upon memory and the assiduity of
constant and resolved industry.

Others confess that it has in earnest its advantages, but doubt much of the
possibility of its execution, hardly believing that the Languages have in good
truth such an accord and resemblance as I suppose they have, or that there is a
possibility for the wit of man now to discover it.

By way of reply to the first, I confess that one thing I wonder at, is that
persons so knowing and ingenuous should so highly declare themselves against
the judgment in favor of the memory, I have a very great regard to their
quality and worth, but cannot submitt my self to their opinion, The only way
(as I imagine) to Learn the Languages, and that in what number we please, to do
it with ease without taediousnesse, confusion, trouble and loss of time, and
without the common hazard, of forgetting them with as much ease as we acquire
them with difficulty, and to be master of them all in such a manner, as shall
relish nothing that is mean or not becomeing a Rational man, is in one word,
to attribute more to the judging and reflecting faculty then to the memory; for
if the memory depend and rely only upon the reflections of the judgment, we
have no reason to expect much from its single Conduct, for however plausible it
may appear, it will always beslow, limited, confused, and faithless; its
laction is not vigorous enough to take us off from those fatigues that distaste
our most likely enterprises, and its efforts to weak and Languishing in a
little time to execute a design of so large a compass as this; being so
determined as it is, it is impossible it should reduce so great a number of
Languages so distanc't in appearance one from another; If at any time it seem
extraordinary in an action, its Species are soon displac't by their multitude,
and when they are ranged in the best order imaginable, they continue not so
long without being either effact by those that supervene or disappearing of
themselves, having nothing that can fix and retain them, So that the
Languages being of so vast an extent, there is no reason that the memory alone
should be confided to for their acquest, unless we could be content to
sacrifice an infinite space of time to the Sole knowledge of words, which being
so valuable as it ought to be to us, may be imployd with more discretion and
success, either toward the cognizance of things or the management of
business.

To satisfy others, I have nothing more at present to say to them but that if
the design shall appear to them at first sight either fantastical or
temerarious, the execution will soon justify me, and perhaps convince them
that it is not always rational positively to pass a judgment upon any thing
before a close and a narrow search, and that we ought not hastily to despair
of any thing; the gaining of which has not been attempted all imaginable ways.

Last of all, as I do not believe my self to be deceived in that which make up
the gross and main of the design, so I do not expect that all that I shall
advance in the sequel upon this connection of the Languages, should be received
by all for uncontrouleable truths, of which I my self am sufficiently
persuaded; I am too well acquainted with the nature of truth to believe my
self so succesfull as to have always discovered that in the most imbroyld and
the most doubtful affairs of the world; yet I confess that notwithstanding
that great respect that is due to it, I have in some cases less regarded it
when it did not appear to comply with the capacityes of ordinary men,
persuading my self that conjecture well framed and adjusted by a plausible Air
is more rellishing to ingenious persons, then an obscure and fainting truth, of
which sort there is a very great number in the present subject.

I propose then to the Learned, this new systeme of the Languages, not as an
incontestable Thesis in all its parts but only as an Hypothesis, not altogether
irrational and which besides has this particular advantage, that although it
should be the falsest thing in the world in speculation, it may at least be
allowable in the practice, And I hope to receive the same favor that persons
(that were most obstinately resolved against his Hypothesis) granted Copernicus
by their confession, that let it be never so false it is however the best
accommodated to use and Astronomicall supputations.

FINIS.
