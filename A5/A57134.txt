EVGENIAS TEARS FOR GREAT BRITTAYNES DISTRACTIONS.
MAn whose inward eyes are still representing him with that great Idea of
Uniuersall nature vewing her adorned in her richest Roabes, sitting in the
glorious throne of her Majesty, and only valewing things according to their
essential proportion and greatness, shall quickly read in her spacious
visage, that nothing is so constant as variety; next he shall see himself, and
not himself alone, but that whole Monarchies, and Kingdoms* are (in respect
of that great Circle of our future happiness) but the smallest point; and that
this great Globe (which some multiply as Species under one Genus) is but the
true looking Glass whence a good stamp should reflect; behold further in this
worlds frame as many strange humors, as sundry sects, as many various
judgments as self-willed opinions, with as many different laws, as fantastical
customs which should teach us rightly to determine of our unhappiness, and
instruct our judgments to acknowledge their imperfections, and natural
weakness; which I confess is no easy task, since the changes of times are
ever subject to afford us so many innovations of Estates, so many falls of
Princes, and so many alterations of public fortunes; all which inform us not
to make too great account of our selves though never so great; how many names
victories, and conquests have we known buried in dark oblivion; which makes
our hopes of pepetuating our memories but ridiculous; and the forgotten state
of so many Gorgious shows (with the glory of so much passed greatness) what
does it but confirm our resolution undantedly to bear the affronts, and
thunderclaps of distempered times, wherein

-- Nonne videmus
Quid Sibi quisque velit nescire et quaerere semper?
Worthy therefore (or rather lamentable) is the consideration, to see to what
pass things (even in this age) are brought, both in opinion and effect; and
would we employ some time in sounding our selves through^y, how easily should
we perceave that the contexture of the best, is built upon weak and decaying
pieces, quos fama obscurd recondit, it being an especial testimony of our
frayltie, that we cannot s^ttle our contentment on any on thing, and that it is
even beyond our desire and imagination to choose what we want, and find out our
Summum b^num; but are ever uncessantly wheeling in this endless Laborinth; we
discern nothing aright, but by a false light, puffed up with art and our own
opinionatednesse, we waver between diverse indifferences; each hour produces
new fantacies, every day (...) follies; in so much that whosoever looks home
shall hardly find himself twice in one and the same e^ate, ^o various is the
visage of our soul, subject to perpetual contrarieties, and the blast of
accidents; hence we prove the Microcosmos of all infirmities, and (the soul
excepted) of all creatures the worst* and what is this world but an
over-shadowed Picture enter-shining with infinite varieties of false lights,
to exercise our conjectures? Neither is there any reason but has another
contrary to it in this case what can be pleasing? since no good can bring us
pleasure, except that against whose loss we are prepared: Nam in aequo est
dolor amissae re^, et timor am^ttendj: Lo then unto what a rep^ atnesse of
h^rtfull humors are we subject, it being impossible to find even ground to
rest secure: Yea the very perfection of our health being too strong and joyful
must (as Physicians observe) in some ^ort be abated, least by ascending too
high they over violently recoyle into disorder: nay farther (though our evils
are essential) the very goods we possess, are only in imagination: we go
not, but are carried as things that floate, sometimes gliding gently and
sometimes Hulling violently, following the inclination of our appetities
according as the wind of occasions does transport us, and as the times shall
prove either stormy or calm: so that in respect of the many intermixtures of
our miserable infirmities, who can ^dicate his sincerity whilit he dwells in
this house of clay: yea the very soul in her passions will rather frame a
fantastical subject, then work upon nothing* So that with the eyes of contempt
we should look on all sublunary destractions, and never ascribe happiness to
that state which depends on the tranquillity and contentment of a well born
mind, and the resolution and assurance of a well ordered soul, until it have
acted the last, and (without doubt) the hardest part of its Tragedy: be no
longer then beguiled with the vain semblance of the world, since the bubbling
breath of man (whose life hanges on his nostrills) is but like the dew fallen
from some humid cloud and can no way secure it self from Titans scorching
view, but (having past its Meridian and afternoon of age) is still hastened to
the night of nature, thus the more we retire into our selves from all carnal
respects the nearer we soar to a divine nature: let not then thy unlimmited
appetite so much covet as con^emne the world ( Sen^ Epist* 62.
Contemn^re enim omnia aliquis potest) since all our friends, honors, and
pleasures like Physicians leave us when we lie a dying, or like wandering
Empericks beguile their credulous patients with great ostentation of
counterfeit cures, and like shadows set with the Sun: and how weak alas are
the worlds wonders, when fore-topt time with her wafting wings after so many
Myriades of years still, still inuolues into its accustomed Circle neither
will I instance how those glorious Monarchies and stately Palaces (sometimes
the seate^ and content of Princes) have become the rejected Ruin of
unrepairednesse, since these present times afford so large and unhappy an
experience: at which age of tears Democritus may laugh, Tymon express his
hatred, but Heraclitus cannot choose but dissolve, since the black Mantelled
night makes every thing to be silent, and the glittering Starr^ (affronting the
silver Moon) deny their wonted light to restless wanderers; and O thou
fairest of Kingdoms and favorite of Neptune, who art as it were departed from
the roundnesse of the world (as if forbidden to partake not only of the
superstitions but unhappiness of other Nations) what is now become of thy
fo^mer glory: what Seas of unequal passions now incompasse thee? Where are thy
^lowring hill tops, thy sweet smiling spring-tides, and those Golden times
when every brook and bush abounded with Milk and Honey? Alas how art thou left
to the favor of frowning fortune! thy stately Paradise once comparable to
those blessed bowers appointed for Sacred Souls, by destiny departed, is even
almost scorched with the displayed Beams of angry Phoebus; thy charming Is^.

melody is (with the dying Swan) tuning it is sad farewell, and despair (which
usually drives off all hope) is only left to be thy comfort: Look on the
groaning earth, and see what it has done against heaven through variety of
sins: cast thy eyes up to heaven, and behold what it has lately done upon
earth, through unusual moisture: So that the ground beginns to Rebel, and
from a Mother becomes a Step dame, yea the Heavens weep and are grown
Chataracts; send Noah's Turtle and it will return thee, that the d^luge is not
yet past, and that there is no place left for virtues tracts* that Sun which so
long has shin'de without those black clouds of ignorance and error beginns
now to be Ecclypsed; mutabillity and disrespect attend the Courts of Princes,
the great Ones of the Land are divided, and the poor man rejoices not in his
green and flowrishing Meadows, thus the State of the whole body (through ill
humors) is likely to produce but an ill issue: some fall out with nature for
casting them in so gross a mould, and never leave aspiring till they have
attained beyond their worth: So that now bring me on of a far famed family,
whose Ancestors have spent their blood to reach unto virtues Diadem, leaving
triumphant Trophies of their greatness to posterity and this Pyrocles shall
meet with a Dametas, who has lately extracted his Gentillity from a durty
soil; show me those lofty Caedars whose sollid growth and large experience,
might justly seem to claim priority, which are not affronted by every shrubb,
and indevoured to be vain gloriously over topt by every silly sprig of a few
years flourishing: nay bring me those of that holy calling, which deduce sound
conclusions from the Sacred truth, justifying the sober assertions from the
undeniable Scriptures, who shall not m^ete with such as dare set their stamp
of Divine Authority upon their Counterfeit Metal, and with an unreverent and
uncivil liberty censure the Magistrate: and hear they of their Prince such
strange things are Law and Justice) as that he is but a Shepherd to them; the
most valiant are now the most unfortunate, for what man can run with so
glorious an envy, or ambitious desire to the Goal of a Combat, but may at
last meet with an evident overthrow, and can no more assure himself of his
welfare then his ruin; Alas! where are ye now O ye valiant Caesar's with
your Trophaeall chariots? for on of whose deaths the Sun is reported to
inuelop her self in a Sable Mantle.

Ille etiam extincto miseratus Caesare Romam
Cum caput obscura nitidum ferrngine texit.
And why weeps learned Athens? which (like those young men and D^mosells) sets
mourning under the spreading Myrtle, which was once grac'^ with the wearied
limbs of their lost l^ves, burning whole piles of Beech-trees under that
hallowed shade, and hastening to be sprinkle it with the richest spices which
may send sweet perfumes to the Heavens; and (fi^ing sacred Tapers on every
side) do nothing but beat their breasts, and howl Epitaphes to the Ecchoing
Groves; why does learning and Religion (like Hypocrates Twinns) thus weep and
laugh together? where is the plea^g harmony of your well according tunes? Alas!
that the Militia of Theology should thus turn to a disaffected multitude* and
express nothing so much as the imbitternesse of discenting minds: which with
their own venom are likely to consume themselves and others: and O that those
gray-haires which like so many Champions have fought thy Duells against that
Idolatrous Key-keeper and his wicked adhaerents, should thus go down with
sorrow to their grave* it is only proper for a bloody Herod to take off the
innocent with the guilty, neither seems, it indifferent that if some few have
been faulty in the lightness of their ware, there should be no more of the
profession: but if any have too much leaned to the Bald-pates of Baalls
Priests, darkning the world and casting ^rronious Mists before the eyes of
ignorance and with the Athenians erected Altars to the unknown God, my heart
shall not think, neither dares my pen write any thing in their behalf, but
digna est tua religio odio; let one or more suffer as they have been faulty,
but O let there be some to excel others, least humane ignorance Mask, or
selfe-wil'd perverseness dangerously cloud the beauty of that Religion, which
is now otherwise likely to be rent into many various parcells: how has the
State been this way lately sick of too much repletion, when the very factious
appropriate to themselves the name of the true Israelits: certainly it is not
for every onezealously to worship his own opinion, when it savours not of
Divine inspiration: in this particular we need not seek our evils without us:
and because we feel our selves not thoroughly sick our recovery is likely to
be the more difficult: but O unhappy time when the ground of Religion (which is
the prop of our Soul shall thus consist in contradiction) we have no hopes of
gayning Heaven by disputing nicities: for the mind of that assailant which is
molested with different allarums is easily dismayed: neither can we be safe by
continually floting in the Ocean of diverse factions: and if we begin not by
time to secure our selves, Alas! who shall provide for so many greifes, so many
evils: nor will it be almost possible: after (so much digression) to reduce
divine things to their just balance that they suffer no impeachment: though it
will be but deserved of him (which is not satisfied with that true light which
the Sun by the virtue of its beams does please to Communicate) to have his
arrogance rewarded with the loss of his sight, And O the fond curiosity of our
nature! amusing it self to preoccupate future things: when it has enough to
do to digest the present; but thou will say perchance thou art zealous,
sincere, and Religious in thy profession: So far I go with thee, and only wish
it were with knowledge, temper* and discretion: for know though no man can be
too p^ in his life or doctrine, nor with his best endeavors attain perfection
as he should, yet though he offend not against the purity of doctrine, or
sincerity of his faith, yet if he rashly separate himself from the Church
(breaking the bond of unity) he may incur the censure of an Schismatic: and
most justly, if for any sinister ends private respects, vainglory, or
temporal commodity, either against the Articles of his faith or Doctrine of the
Church grounded upon Gods Word; which indeed proves too appar^t in these times;
Let such witness who are more ignorant then Platoes Phylodoxes, lovers of
their own opinions, which (through their windiness) are likely to resolve the
world again into its first Chaos, and make it a Babell not of Languages but
Sects: which like Hydraes stuffed with poison, or like old vessels full of new
wine, fantacies, and strange revellations, reject every thing as Profane which
is contrary to their opinion: who are too wise in Gods eternal Counsels,
making such as they fancy or please to be elect, others reprobates: when as
how dare thou pry into the secret designs of Gods Divine will, and the
incomprehensible motives of his works; and O vain Man how could thou thus
attain the depth of his sacred de^rees? Who has learned thee his high
conceits? or who can (...) ^ee with t^ (...) ^me thoughts which he does
possess? whilst in a moment he surrounds those Crystal mantled skie^;
surely as the worst things (well used) prove good ^o the best things (ill used)
become our evils; and is not Religion sick of some Hectic distemper, when
(...)-sick Pamphleters, and giddy headed li^ellors, shall up^aide even Majesty
to its face? audacity leading them (out of an assumed liberty) to express a^
ill governed zeal; and is it consonant to reason, that every illiterate
Mechannicke should play with the w^rd? Nay the weaker sex who are commanded
silence, and not to us^pe authority, have also freedom to vent their opinions
(O never so much as now immodest!) yea and to threaten reve^g with their tender
limbs, when as alas! hat small member which proclaims their valor is likely
to prove the be^ (or rather the worst) instrument for so weak a combita^t* I
deny not but seduced agents may (as, the Devil at first) work on the frailty
of their nature, but me thinks the first slip cost us so dear, as that
connivance and approbation should not ^ster the second unhappiness; but it so
be that every sex and sect shall have a several exposition on the Text, and
their fo^d opinions shall incite their intellects to rebel against the true
inspirer thereof, well may we cry out.

O Saeclum insipiens and infacotum! And certainly where all reverence is thus
laid aside, devotion will at last grow cold; and I think in time it will be
easier to find out the ^pecies and kinds of nature, then the Sects of this
age* mistake me not, I censure not all (...) H^cks, whi^ are not O^thodox,
neither condemn all to be Schismatickes because some fall out to ^e facti^us
in Israel; but where pride and discontent meet with novelty good parts wi^h
imp^dencie, and ignorance with pretended Sanctity, there division mu^t needs
(...) defect, as union is the Author of Beauty and blessedness: no humor
^eing so easily counterfeited as that of devotio^, which (...) sports so many
Ministers beyond themselves, some flashing in their ma^ter, but confused in
their Method, some being as inuective in their d^livery, as d^eaming in their
vtteranc^; some with the flaming fire of ill tempered and indiscreete zeal,
shake their Auditors (like Earthquakes) with i^ applied terrors of the Law,
oftentimes tending to desperation, 1 Kings 19. 1^.
but the Lord is not in that fire, but in the still voice; stanching the
bleeding heart and d^oping the oil of the Gospel into the wounded conscience;
some pride themselves with the bubble of popular applause (often as causelessly
gotten) as deservedly lost, soothing the people with such doctrine as may
comply with their humors, and thus as the Sun ris^g and declining makes long
shadows, but at midday being at the highest make* none at all, so oftentation,
sincerity, and learning seldommeet in those Pastors; which (l^ke the Par^redge)
run away with part of the shel on their heads; and l^aving their unripened
learning in those sacred Schools (if they vouc^sat't to see them) aim at
their advantage in the Country, and for a fit treasure become thieves; hence the
vulgar, and disaffected (...), (wanting the faculty to judge of things by
themselves) are led only with an out ward appearance, and if once possessed
with the boldness to despise, and malapertnesse to imp^gne those opinions
which were before intertain'd with an awful reverence, will (especially if
some Articles of their belief are made questionable) soon admit an equallitie
in all other parts of their Religion, rushing into an inevitable confusion and
at last reject (as a tyranicall yoke) all impressions formerly received,
either by the authority of Laws, or reverence of custom, and will thence
forward allow of nothing, unless they have given their voice and particular
consent to the same: thus also are those Professors (almost out of their wits)
opinionated in their hearing, so that be the Man not after their humor, the
matter shall have no honor; arrogating to the instrument what they de^ogate
from the agent* and let him never so much preach the abortive sigments of his
own Brain, his applause shall be Acts 12: (...).
Vox Dei, and non hominis: It is the voice of God and not of man: certainly,
though my hea^ abhor all unnecessary and superstitious Ceremonies. (earnestly
wishing that whatsoever is scandalous, contrary to the truth, and offensive in
the exercise of Religion, might be taken off,) yet am I thoroughly persuaded
that God ought to be intermixed in all our actions with an awful reverence,
and an attention full of respect, his voice being too Divine to have no other
use then to exercise the Lunges and please the fancies: good matter is like a
beautiful body, and Eloquence the well fashioned Garment, the one not rudely to
be ^lubbered up, nor the other expressed in careless words: neither ought we
(like Bees) always to resort to those flowers which are fair, and neglect the
wholesome herbs: but O how does it concern the reformers of these times, to
encourage and approve of none, but such moderate wits, whose depth of knowledge
has not led them ^o bypath in judgment, but have walked in the trodden way
of the truly reformed Church; esteeming it greater glory to establish an
Ancient Truth then ignorantly devise a new opinion: Yet, O yet, there is some
hopes that those Bonds wherewith we are fettered may be by you stricken off,
then will you preserve that contexture, whose dissolution is so much attempted,
which notice importes not so much weight, as it requires speed, least it
shortly be said,

Heu tantum attriticorporis ossa vides! Then only will the Church be most
happy when truth and peace shall kiss each other, truth without Peace being
but turbulent, and peace without truth but a secure injustice; the glorified
Spirits have but one, uniforme work, wherein they all join the praise of
their Creator: showing that the beauty of order, and the band of unity must be
our double support: why then should we uncessantly entangle our selves with
selfe-will'd extravagancies, which argues a mind full fraught with wind-puft
conceits, still floting up and down the supersicies of giddy brains, which
are ever governd by the instabillity of a private fantacie; and does not the
desease exasperate by the Jealousy of the debate; like that silly Bird which
perceiving fire near her young ones, seeks to blow it out with her wing^ so
long till she burn; and make here self a Prey in an unwise pity, so the
woeful experience of those times shows that such as indiscreetly meddle with
the flame of discention (kindled in the Church) rather increase then quench it;
Some will be naught but Ceremony, and hold fast the bows whilst they leave
the body; others out of too high a conceit of themselves (affecting nothing but
singularity) disdain to go in the right road, and through discontent (at
la^) reject all contradiction; both which like indiscree^e ^avellers) have
per^ce taken the fairest, but not the nearest way to the^r jour^ies end; then
does ^t not highly concern the present assembled body of this Kingdom to
direct, and track out such a way, as on the one side may be strongly hedged
from all superstition, and on the other fenced from affected ignorance; the
distempers of this sort are almost grown immedicable v^lnus, crying out to all
those which pass by, whither ever any sorrow or distraction were like that of
this Church, for which there is great grief in Sion; alas! ^ow is she
discipated, and sitts weeping in the dust, her lovers and her friends have
fo^saken her, ^ant. 3. 1.
She seeks whom her soul loves but find^ him not; and is become like some
forsaken Nymph whom solitariness invites to her gloomy grove; what but whole
rills of tears are perceived in thy streets, venting nothing but remorsefull
songs, and pouring out floods which will no longer be i^viron'd with the
drooping Willowes; thy Harps and Music lie mute, thy heart is filled with
fears and Plaints, yea and thy Temples almost forsaken; thou have not Aza's
sickness in thy feet^, but thy heart and art near (with Ezekiah) wounded to
death unless thou use his Physician, his remedy; thou that were in thy full
brightness, art now likely to droope into the wane of misery; and which is
worse it will not profit thee to seek outward cure, whilst thou have thy *
executioners within; thy Garments (thus Hose^ 1^. (...)
rent) are subject to be torn with every bryer; thy glory is defaced, yet
seek not (with the Elephant) for muddy channels to hide thy deformity, but
some Crystal stream as well to delineate, as cure thy malody; thy grief
then being over-past shall be pleasant to thy remembrance; till when bite not
at the stone and neglect him that threw it, neither in thy suffering evils so
far look on secondary causes as not to reflect on the highest; thy
abstinence must be thy cure; and (like poison used to a good Medicine) thy
sins and afflictions must prove thy gain. In Arts diverse subjects have no
life or essence, but in the agitation, and disputing; and as in virtue of two
equal effects, we hold that the fairest and worthyest, which affords most
lets, and wherein are proposed greatest hazards, so who knows whither it be
not one especial effect of Gods divine providence, thus to suffer his true
Church to be vexed and turmoyled with no fewer blasts then turbulent Storms,
whereby ^orowze, and awaken the godly and Religious ^oules from that Lethall
security, and ^upified slumber wherein so long tranquillity has plunged them;
and O thou supreme director of all things, look down on thy distressed Sion,
pity her tears, support her fears (bred from the seditious dregs of
slimyignorance) ^eepe her sides from wounding, let her triumph still in her
Sovereign head, and ^et not those whi^ lewindes dim her light; O how sacred
were those tears once cast on Jerusalem deploring their desease, and
Prophesying their woes ^ far exceeding those spent on the banks of Tygris, or
those sower-set Hebraick Plaints powered forth by mournful Captives (banished
Luke 19. 41. 42.
from their nation) into Crystal Euphrates, which so sadly incompast the
stately station of beautiful Babylon; thou only O Lord which involuest the
waters in a garment, and command the outrageous Sea to keep its bounds (to
whom all nations are but as the dust of the balance, or the drop of a Bucket,
who hold the wind in thy fist and madst the shadow to go backward) can
stay the unrulinesse of those headstrong enemies, which have thus overspread
thy Church; O refine and purge thy flore, cleanse this spittle of dis^eased
opinions; there is but on way, on truth; let not heresy prove error in the
fundamentalls of Religion; but settle those great and long-continuing
al^ercations about the best form of holiness, and show that high Assembly
which way assiduously to agitate such rules as may be most commodious to unite
our present distractions; that so succeeding posterity may say our modern
reformation has been exact to the oppugning of superstitious errors, sweetly
to inchant and allay our Schisms; and (concluding a timely peace) to fill this
little point of the world, with as pure a devotion, as requisite obedience; that
so there may be no longer difference amongst the Heards-men, whilst the
Cananites are yet in the Land, and the adversaries of the truth are mingled
amongst us, who make our discords their sweetest harmony; and that no scoffing
Cham, or deriding Ismael make music of our miseries; let them speedily be
covered with the cloth of silence, least it be told in Gath, and published in
Askelon, * 2 Samuel: 19. 10. Mica. 1. 10.
and the daughters of the Phy^istims triumph and rejoice that the beauty of
Israel is slain, and the mighty are fallen; and that leaving off that old
humor of loving new things; and that mayden-like religion (who are first won
by those by whom they are first wooed) whilst some Sacrifice their reverence to
one admired Preacher, others adore this affected Pastor, whilst some are of
Paul, others of Apollo (affecting a shining appearance) Gods ordinance is
neglected, his word had in respect of persons, and it be justly said, vt omnium
rerum, sic literarum quoque intemperantia laboramus, that as by our contempt we
seem too much abounding with all earthly blessings, so have we surfetted
(through our intemperance) with the plentiful enjoyment of our heavenly Manna;
is not this the age so sadly foretold by that Oracle of Divine Truth, wherein
not only one Nation shall rise against another, but be divided in its self,
yea their worst enemies shall be enclosed within their own confines; nay as if
the Fabric of the world should not want any thing to dissolve it, if wars and
Tumults sickness and famine may not sufficiently shake it, behold with grief,
how many Imaginary Christ's, are forged in the shops not only of Demetrius the
silver Smith, but (with the help of that great and well Ephe. 6. 11, 12.
experienced Artist of infernal fireworks) have bin hammered on the factious
Anvells of discenting spirits, who through the crasinesse of their heads and
not the soundness of their hearts, are so much of late grown the Bellows of
sedition; he that makes a doubt of the fulfilling of our Saviors prophecy,
let him but cast his eyes on the actions of our present Tragedy, and veiw the
new ways of our impious devotion, only reserved for this deplored time wherein
never any seemed more fierce for Religion, yet more barren in piety; this makes
pastime for our adversaries: yet if any more sincere and unspotted, be given us
from heaven to teach us the true path to those eternal Mansions, bidding those
personating sectaries of Christianity to carry more devotion in their hearts
then in their countinances, and to be more exemplary in doing, then violent in
saying, how shall he be the patient of their contumely, and dispa. ragement: so
willing are we to expire our latest breath in this lingting sickness of
dissimulation; O that so many discertions should be now so common within the
Orchard of the Church; that Satan should thus transform himself into an Angel
of light ^ certainly it is bad sinning in a Religious habit, and though there
may be a deceiving of our sights on earth, yet is there no way to blanch their
haulting corruption before their Creator; so that never more unhappy were any
times then these of the last, into which we are fallen; our best writers are
now most silent, and all our leaves become libells; every invective pen takes
the power to impart its own spleen, and every unstable head his brainlesse
opinion; nay do not ou^ streets daily swarm with variety of untruthes framed
(for some petty gain) by the frothy wit of those whose penns are still dipped,
either in the slattering, current of sinister ends, and affection, o^ the muddy
dreggs of 1 Timothy 3. 4.
Rebellious faction and ignorance, so that now many can no sooner speak, but
cry, and by lying (when all trades fail) are learnt to get their living: but
which is worst, to plead Authority for their countenance, though they may not
be imagined guilty of so great a connivance, whose blood has so long swelled
in their veins for the reformation of abuses, and to this end have no less
tired their spirits, then exhausted their estates, and not only neglected
their affairs, but even adventured their lives; neither are those the
Cisternes to convey the clear and refreshing streams which may water the
unprofitable Corners of this Land, where (with no less dislike then open
repining) it has bin sufficiently proclaym'd in this nature, that the chaff
over-topt the fairest Corn, threatening an untimely Harvest; neither is this
the way to weigh all things in an indifferent balance, and to quiet the
Iealousies of the times; or the Helm to guide that goulden vessel srought
with the incomparable treasure of perfectruth, and pure Religion, so longingly
expected into the harbor of every conscionable and relenting soul. But it is
rather to be wished that now those swelling Waves (with such big Volumes)
threaten her sinking, we should cast over board whatsoever might hinder a good
voyage, and so lighten her to undergo so dangerous a storm, since the
combustion of all the Elements threaten a^ ensuing tempest, wherein so many
smooth Devils wait to disturb the Air, and (being inveloped in the clouds
of corrupt vapors) strive under the color of grace to confound nature it
self; but before I wade further into this Deluge of distempers, let not any
think (either through the perverseness of their affected ignorance, or the
known blackness of their own thoughts) that it is my intent here to ay me or
invect against the truly Reli^ious or well minded Christian, or to brand any
honest man with the name of Puritan, being assured that though many with an
ignorant painted and superficial outside (deluding our eyes and gulling our
Souls) manifest themselves at last to be but mere Hypocrites, gilded Pills,
and the rich coverings of durty walls; yet the most zealcus and well governed
men of these times, who with no less pains then detestation, Preach down
sin and ungodliness, expressing the power of the Word by its operation in a
Sanctified, pure, and unspo^ted life, and without Hypocri^ie or senister en^s
striving both in life and doctrine to suppres^e all sin, are too often and
unjustly branded with that scandalous title; such Puritans we must all be which
mean to see Heaven, that Character being truly placed when it meets with the
contemners of the Church and State, which aim at the evertion of doctrine and
discipline; of which though it may now be said as Christ once did of the
Damsel, she is not dead but sleeps, yet is it not to be doubted, but
future time will distinguish between those over-mouth'd professors; whose
tongues are in their hearts, and those true Nathaniels whose hearts are in
their tongues; and though none are more bitterly invenomed against Sovereign
Authority, the State Ecclesiastical, and the lawful approved decency of the
Church* though none are more invective against the flourishing blessings of the
time, no mouths more raylingly open with the terms of Reprobate, and the
denouncing of Gods judgments upon all the world but himself and his Sect, and
none more lawless nor desirous to have all things in Common; yet the prayers
of Gods Children shall quench their fiery Furnace, Daniel shall not be hurt
with their Lyonlike mou^hes; the seditious Israelites shall be appea^'d for
Moses sake* (and by the powerful groans of the truly Religious) Paul's bands
shall be loosed, the barren womb of ignorance be made more fruitful, and
locked-up Heaven, be for ever and (more powerfully) opened; and I desire it may
not savor of too much presumption to tell the hopes of our hearts the
supporters of our State, the expectation of our best thoughts, yea and the very
life of our Souls, how that the eternal comfort and welfare of this
Kingdom, consists in the suppression of the spreading growth of those and the
like extremes, wheresoever apparent, by any impudent carriage or disorderly
behavior; So shall you be a^l glorious within, when you so sweetly sing of
mercy and judgment: having no less discretion to free the guil^lesse, then
justice to punish the Delinquent; otherwise so much liberty is assumed (in
those divided times) by factiously turbulent and disorderly Spirits, as will at
last threaten a confusion; then what valews it i^ a ship be sunk with a small
leake or a great, and where is our remedy if by avoiding surfeiting we kill our
selves with abstinence; how vain alas! are the attempts of those men which are
drunk with the strength of their own wits, and guided by what-soever their
appetites do most affect; like Machiavills they stumble at a Straw, but for
their own advantage leap over a block, their seeming devotion wants a
Saint-like sincerity, their professed conscience an expressed feeling, yea where
their faith is so voy'd of works, let them never so much bless for Israel^* I
know they can curse for Balack; let them never so much plead for order, they
desire to live without it, let their lives seem never so holy their hearts
alas are too too hollow; and though they draw near the Lord with their mouth,
and boast of nothing but Religion yet do they live without the power thereof,
but pulling down with one hand while they build with the other, they will at
last by their dangerous slights, unruly passions, and impetuous attempts, so
far express their ill disposed affections, (though with never so much gravity
in their behavior, so much Gospel in their mouths, and so much paintednesse
in all their actions) as to appear ^ Tim. 3. 5. 6.
like counterfeit Glo-wormes and rotten wood, or like high hanged Mills which
make much noise, but grind but little, or as* shallow streams raging
furiously when they carry least water; O how does it stand with the refining of
our Religion, (as to pluck down Idolatry even to the least rag or Relic of
superstitious inventions and humane traditions, (o) to avoid that dangerous
Rock of faction and Schisms; which now (through the low ebb of true Religion
or rather the abounding of so many falls) gives the whole Kingdom so sufficient
a warning; since both these extremes equally impart a blindfolded ignorance;
let Religion be no longer turned into the stalking ^orse of vainglory and
Hypocrisy, for though a hansome garment may for a time obscure their crooked
designs, yet when they have brought their ends to perfection (God grant the
Kingdom not to a general combustion) those gilded Cupps will prove full of
poison, and those glittering stones merely counterfeite; why should Ioab thus
kill with embracing! Why should Judas thus kiss with betraying? nay why should
the Pulpits or rather the unhallowed rooms of our too many Ps^do-zelots with
the unlawful assemblies of illiterate Artists, so freely, though ignorantly,
produce nothing but blasphemy, faction, and rebellions? what alas shall tender
consciences in this age conclude to be truth, when those of that (once
reverenced) habit, with Pilate shall wash their hands but not their heart, with
Ca^phas shall beat the Pulpits and rend their garments, yet pretend Blasphemy;
and with the Pharisees shall no sooner cry Master, but crucify. O that so
foul a matter vented from the breath of so many Sectists in those times should
be left to posterity in such fair Characters, that men with their hands should
write to condemn their hearts, and without any remorse of conscience or
feeling of their own weakness eternize their shame and false hoode; such
weather-cock^ certainly (like Phillips Clisophi) will halt with the times; but
yet let Jacobs voice be known from the rough hands of Esais, can those Hydra's
disgorge nothing but poison: then let not every Mechannick make his durty shop
a consecrated Pulpit, every Libertine vent his scens^esse tenants, and S. Paul's
decency be utterly extirpated: surely those things ought not so to be; the
Torrid Zone is too violent for so temperate, and well moderated^ climate, and
experience acquaintes us with that common Axiom (though in diverse matters of
less consequence) nullum violentum est perpetuum; the incomparable Fabric of
this Church and State, perfected by the assiduous endeavors of Pious Princes,
religious Martyrs, and unparralel'd Counsels, could never have thus far been
erected (to the admiration and envy of other Nations) without the well
quallified materials of stable heads, and the continual blessing of a
Supreme providence, which has thus long supported it; and shall we now rent
all in a moment? either through the ambition of discenting, if not discontented
spirits, or under the specious pretents of a larger freedom. It is not (I
confess) to be denied but that the frame of this Kingdom so admirably
supported, and thus long continued, may (like a distempered body) want a
Physician, yet ought the Apothecary to quallifie the materials, or else they
will miss of a good operation: some lenitive oil may soften a sollid matter,
when a harder substance will not pierce it, and certainly as that state cannot
long subsist which is full of broils, so what likelihood can there be of a
prosperous Church amongst so many divisions: be it so (and too true it is) that
needless Ceremonies have of late too much crept into the Church, in so much
that S. Paul's complaint might well be in force, Acts 17: ^2.
Men and Brethren I see that in all things you are too superstitious; and with
Auerrhoes sit anima mea cum Philosophis quia Christiani adorant id quod edunt;
what though? have we not sufficiently been miserable in the one but must we
needs make our selves unfortunate in the other; Oh that Religion were once
purged from the Lees of the Romish Grape: and for my own part I wish that (as
with the Papists) we make not more account of Ceremonies then the substance of
Religion, so on the other side we wrong not our consciences by admitting a
disconformity in matters beseeming and indifferent; (mistake me not) I drive
not to quench the smallest spark of zeal against the Romish Midianites; no,
go on for the Lord and for Gidion, let these assembled Worthies prove happy
I^siasses to free the Land of Idolatrous worship, and live for ever to
extirpate that brood of bloudsucking (...), but yet cast back their eyes and
reflect on that thousand shaped Proteus, whose cruelty and nonconformity
equalizeth their too much superstition; O let it not be said they have taken
away the Lord out of the Church, and we know not where they have laid him! let
not a Calumniating Libertine in a slovenly habit be more respected then a
Religious Aaron in a decent Garment, neither let us more desire some Apostata
to spoil, rather then a Constantine to enrich the Church; for what better
sign (though not always certain) is there of the inward Heavenly calling,
then an outward reverend gesture; though with grief we too too often behold
those ragged and railing Rabshachies, those blasphemous Sanballets, whose black
mouths are ever venting (from their durty cells) volumes of affronts against

Government and good order; yea miserable is it Jude 8.

corner of the streets, but also) with irreverent and ra^ling language in Gods

have hopes, that Baalims curses will reflect on himself, that Achitophells
wisdom will be turned into foolishness, that justice shall take place or vice
be extinguished; that the good shall be preferred or the ill disgraced, no, nor
Christ's Spouse kept spotless from the s^ames of division; how glorious (like
the Apple tree in the midst of the forest) might this Church render it self,
how might the sincere word of Christ be zealously taught ^ how sweetly might
truth and righteousness imorace each other? yea how might our present mourning
be turned into joy, and the daughters of Jerusalem rejoyco? were but those
turbulent weeds taken from the fairest flowers; but alas we are now almost
grown the Thistle amongst Roses, Ionah's storm does not cease, our enemies
say so would we have it. Israells destruction is of her self, and mournful
Sion sits weeping in the dust; and all for their sakes, who with the too much
expressed ^eruour of faction and false doctrine, strive to build with untempered
mortar, and like Church Rebels, upon some sudden rapsadie, or miraculous
Enthu^asme, affront the Minister, rent his clothes, spurn at the Prayer
book, scoff at the Lords Table, deride his ordinances, and with a holy
madness* and devout Phrenzie strive to cast the whole frame of Religion, and
good discipline in the mould of their own fancies and disordered humors, an
incivillity worse then Heathenisme how zealously read are they at sometimes, but
at other, how may you read all their profane actions in black characters; and
while they seem to reject the dotage of superstition, fall into the phrenzie
of Schism and profaneness, or by avoiding the worshipping of Idols, commit
Sacrilege; shall I say those are they against whom our Savior denounced so
many Mat. 23*

not the ordinary wisdom of flesh and blood which can judge of the spirit,
sure there is something more in it then for every illiterate and idle brain to
undertake so weighty a Task, grace being an especial concomitant thereunto.
Oh how hard (and with as much sweat of our brows, as toil of our minds) do
we labor for the provision of this ba^er life! and is it so easy a matter to
attain the food of a better? I deny not but as there are diversities of
gifts, so they are extraordinarily bestowed, but if all should be Teachers,
where would be the Hearers; Nay in time who would care to hear, if none care
to study; what need have we to sweat so many drops, watch so many hours,
peruse so many Tracts, endure so many perturbances of mind and body, and at
last (like the industrious Be) divide the sweetest Honey from the rankest
poison, sealing that long (...) for truth with our latest breath, if with so
much ease we may attain heaven; is learning now become so contemptible? O
charity whither art thou fled! how do those men fall out with learning and the
very name of a Scholar, and rail against all the degrees thereof because they
could never attain to any, including so much unhappiness therein, when it is
not Culpaartis sed utentis, as if the sharpness of the Knife, and not the
madness of the actor were the cause of hurt; can you account S. Paul
Vainglorious in saying he knew himself nothing inferior to the most excellent
of the Apostles? away then with those sons of ignorance who standing upon the
quaintness of their own fancies, descent from the opinions of all the
Fathers, and even with contumely reject their reverend authority; what
Rhetoric can dissuade, what Logic ^ectifie their bransick humors? Surgunt hi
indocti^t eaelum rapiunt, they take Heaven by violence, yea and if it were
possible would deceive the elect; when as nostra haec in literarum peregrinatio
sine supremaluce miserabilis quaedam est erratio, our greatest perfection in
this divine School is but apparent weakness without the chiefest light; and
how acceptable a service would it be to whisper into the ears of those whited
Sepulchers, that a charitable discretion were better then their zealous
ignorance: but Oh that we could yet rest here, and without farther grief
resound the Ecchoing groans of a bleeding State, Nam ut olim flagitijs, sic
nunc legibus laboramus,

Et patimur long ae pacis mala* Saenior armis
Luxuria incumbit.
Run this way also but the story of our evils, and see whither our
distractions have not proved as chargeable as our humors are changeable, and
whither our affections are not as different, as the cure is likely to prove
difficult: my heartakes to think that this Kingdom which was la^ely the Glory
and pride of Christendom reformed, when all the world was ready to come over
unto her, should thus shamefully run away from her self; fortunate (with
Pirrhus) have thou formerly been in conquering of Kingdoms but unhappy to
keep them; hard case! when the Mistrisse of the world shall be thus oppressed
by her own greatness; thy Albion Ch^ts are yet free from those crimson
stains, which have so deeply dyed thy Eastern neighbors; and though that
brood of Cadmus have lately turned those Western Mountains (contrary to their
nature) into rebellious Troops of Loathsome Serpents, filling their Boggs with
infernal furies, yet I hope their pretended president from their Northern
sister, shall as little advantage their designs, as palliate their intentions;
and (for their sufferance) I shall wish any, no other punishment then to pay
for the breach, who shall hereafter (without just occasion and dishonorable
terms) deny to maintain, what has been lately (God grant happly ordered.) I
am cuncti gens vna sumus, sic simus in aeuum, for if that Kingdom (so dearly
of late reunited unto us) should again appear in its former postures,
questionles^e by the illness of the example, though perchance upon less
grounds, others would so far learn the same lesson, as to make such rents
an occasion of loosing the whole; but I hope we need not in our time fear the
sight of so strange a Prodigy, since the cause being taken off the effect must
necessarily cease; especially, so glorious a Sun having (by his benign
influences) expelled those vapors and dislocated such ill humors as might
swell into the Timpanie of future disaffectednesse; and it were also to be
wished that those burning emotions (which have lately been amongst our selves,
and whereof we are hourly likely to be more sencible) might be diverted else
where; least the offending humors (at this instant so predominant within the
confines of this state) draw us into the feavour of civil descention; which
will so greatly endanger our ruin; for how near have our Enemies subverted
our public peace, introduced inevitable mischiefs, and occasioned the
general corruption of our manners; and whence proceeds the cause of so many
distempers amongst us, but from the likelihoode of some violent alterations
which are ever attended with inevitable greevances; so that when we suffer how
justly may we say,

Heu patior telis vulnerafactameis* Neither are these only the impressions of
our apprehension, without some real effects of our fear, though we are so
dull to conceive what woeful experience too plainly manifests; few men dying
with the resolution it is their last hour; and are in nothing more deceived,
something or other still ringing in our ears, that many have been sicker and
yet not dyed; when for the present distempers of this sad state (stupid as we
are) even the generallity of things seem to suffer, and protend the likelihood
of our (...)* the Heavens (through unwonted and unheard of moisture have seemed
to take compassion, the air bin clouded with unusual darkness* the fire
produced strange meteors, the water unknown Shipwreck; nay, have we not lately
had blows from a divine hand more to be admired then disputed; and shall we
thus cast our selves into the Sea with closed eyes? let us in our sad fortunes
look about us, and compare our estate to those who are better; our
Commonwealth is much crazed and out of tune, our greevan^es (by ill applied
medicines) have bin inflamed, and not cured; and yet (thus are we bewitched) we
still stand gazing on those burning Lamps; did we know the attendants of
intestine broiles we would (after so much surfeiting) use some abstinence in
hope of remedy; for alas! who can discribe the fruits of civil discentions?
who can endure to hear those sad Iudaick Songs? Mothers weeping for their
slaughtered children, widows mourning for their husbands; Maidens bewayling
the loss of their chastity, and helpelesse Orphans bursting with starved
groans; let us not then (like Lions sleep with our eyes open; ^ther let our
too much satiety beget our distaste; and though expectation in weak minds
makes a good less and an evil greater, yet in these times, as resolution and
sufferance must be thy preservatives, so preparation must be thy advantage; for

shall be those of his own house* what unparralel'd times of peace, we have
enjoyed is well known, (no nation having received the like blessings) O that we
had also* kept our first love) but what that providence (which with mercy ever
remembers man's miseries) will do, who can determine? our best wisdom being but
light if wayed with that eterna^l fore-caster, of all things, though justly we
may fear the worst, being likely better to know the worth of those Pearls by
loosing them, seeing

Hostis adest dextr^, laeu^que a part timendus
Vicinoque malo terret ^ trunque l^tus.
Neither can it be amiss in thy prosperity to make room for adversity, that
though it come unsent for, yet (as not undeserved) so not unlookt for; hence
thy expectation (though it cannot hinder) may lessen thy crosses; long have
thou bin like a Lilly amongst thorns and should thou always abound, it would
be hard not ^o grow proud; thy security has already bintoo much an enemy to
preventio^, otherwise might thou have seen thy own fall in thy neighbors,
whose sins being ^he same, it is Gods mercy his judgments are not; in which he
no less preaches then in his word; for when he strikes offenders it is but to
warn them that stand by; alas* that thou can only plead to have bin happy
too soon, and to have made such bad use of thy blessings; part not then (like
Herod) with a Kingdom for a Dance, but seeing the temper of this age differs
not from the Heavens (threatening a second deluge) take heed with Peter least
thou begin to sincke; prevent the time wherein (as the Tragedian told Pompey)
thou shall fetch deep sighs because thou sorrowed'st not sooner; let not thy
deathbed smart for those wilful adjournings of timely repentance, but
discharge thy sins be time (...) be at peace; what greater good can happen to a
diseased man then Physic to recure him, long (though perchance unfit) has thy
sound body carried about it a sick soul, then hazard not thy life rather then
offend thy palate, repay thy thanks and not repine a^ the Physician; adversity
sometimes best speaks a Christian, neither is it honor to overcome when it is
no danger to fight; every Bird can sing in a te^perate spring* and a clear
Heaven, every Epicure can be merry in the midst of his Cups and Dalliance; but
(when all things fail) to stand our ground and expect supply from above,
shows our faith, and becomes only the 3 children in the furnace, Paul and
Silas in the stocks, and the Marty^s at the stake; but methinks I hear some
say, quo diversus abis? where must we seek this cure, whence shall we expect
this remedy* if any should seem to make this question it is not to be doubted
but their own thoughts have likewise resolved so needless ascruple, especially
in these times where the world no less hates then admires the Physician, and
where those Saints of the cross (for brevities sake now called Crowched
Friars*) with which our streets so lately swarmd, so much opposed the
likelihood of a cure; Omake not your religion thus from being ridiculous, to be
come odious; forbear, forbear, with your Legends and false* miracles (most
proper for the great Prince of ceremonies) thus to oppose so great an Assembly,
least your desperate attempts (veiwed with an intentive judgment) exceed^ the
bounds of pity; there is but one Master of Requests i^ heaven, who will
assuredly recompense your bad designs* neither think (with those fond
Egyptians) sufficiently to satisfy divine justice by sacrificing the
counterfeit shadows of some painted creatures, or with some fond invention to
appease a substance ^o essential; no, no, shake off that spirit of slumber
which thus deludes you leave o^ hatching of such Cockatrice eggs, and thus
sin no more least a worse thing happen unto you; and what cause have we by
continual imploring of a supreme power to beg a prosperous event on the great
endeavors of that high Assembly, that so it may never be said that the greatest
folly should proceed from the subtilest wisdom, the extremest enmities from
the greatest friendship, and that our Physic should bring infection with it;
too much clearness may blind our sights and too deep an apprehension may at
last bereave us of our senses; the curious pursuit of diverse sciences has
brought many unto sottishness, and too much aptitude toward the exercise of
the mind has at last brought many without mind or exercise, but O God! Let
not our mortallest diseases proceed from our soundest health, let not
distempered and outrageous frenzies ensue from the rarest agitations of our
minds, neither let the best spirits be overthrown by their own force, least
thereby the enemies of thy truth have just cause to rejoice; thrice then
unhappy shall we be if our plants are thus choked with overmuch moisture, if
our Lamps are thus damned with too much oil, and the actions of our mind
overwhelmed with the abundance of too needless a study; and O that those
dissenting spirits were equally balanced to prevent all turbulent motions, and
to measure things with an indifferent poyse ^ least the discordance of
opinions, and diversity of languages occasion the like confusion in this
unhappy state, as it once did in the overthrow of that proudly-rais'd Pile, and
heaven-menacing Tower; but what power but the highest can direct this (...); we
may un-use our selves to the secrets of the Stars, yet still have a continual
bondage before our eyes* or like those Grammarians (at whom Dionisius scoffeth)
labor to know the Mysteries of Ulysses, and yet be ignorant of our own; and
with those Orators we may be derided who study to speak of justice, yet can
never frame away of execution, unless some director from above teach us
Servare modum, finemque tenere; neither I hope shall we have reason hereafter
to mistrust, but that those eminent Statesmen (which like discreet Pilots, are
now appointed to steer the weather-beaten vessel of this tottering kingdom)
sufficiently know sometimes how to loose a sail, now and then hoyst to the
main, for if they once chance to loose the Helm (unless they be good
swimmers) needs must they be drowned. As also that by an over*multiplying and
subdividing we fall again into the infinity of Epicurus Atoms, and so by
opening of the matter, spill it by distempering the ingredients; far* be it
also from the thoughts of any, that under the pretense of so much expressed
loyalty, there should be harbored in any of that grave Sinod the least desire
to bring in Innovations into the Church or Commonwealth, to derogate any thing
from his Majesty's honor, or just prerogative to have sinister respects, or
splinative intentions, to advance their own liberties by exemption from their
an* tient privileges, to allow of any government which might counter check the
Royal dignity of the Crown, for certainly should they either by private or
mallicious ends not concurring with the general good of the states, aim at
their particular advantage, in what sad Characters shall the misery of this
kingdom be hereafter recorded, or what mournful pen, or horrid breath will be
able to set forth so unparraleld a Treachery; neither I hope need we fear
that those which are thus employed for the defense of the laws, should first
enter into (...) actual rebellion against their own ordinances, well knowing
that the way to cure sedition is not to be first infected therewith, neither
can they seem to chastise disobedience if they show the example of it,
especially in these times of wildness and non-subjection; being fully assured
that those which first shake an estate are commonly first over-thrown by the
fall; and that the chief movers thereof r^ape not always the fruits of such
troubles, but mud only the waters for others to fish; and when all other
discriptions of policy, whither sained by art or supposition, prove merely
ridiculous and not worthy the practice, their privilege alone it is to
re-erect and range the same anew, who thoroughly know how far any estate is to
be wrested from the accustomed habit and fold it has taken seeing the extreme
will discipate all: neither is it likely that some unhappy destiny has seated
those Worthyes on the Theater of this age to be so dissonant and des^erent in
proportion from our deplorable troubles: and so far from agreeing with our
tumultuous storms, well considering that nothing does so nearly touch and
overlay an estate as Innovation: for if, one piece be out of Square it may be
under p^opt, but (after the removing the foundation of so vast a frame) to
reedifie so huge a Mass will prove more likely to deface the whole then refine
a part, and instead of cleansing, scrape out. This manner of cure always
brings death, and such amendment universal confusion; like Caesar's Murderers
who brought the commonwealth to so distresfull a plunge that they repented
themselves ever to have meddled with the same, and experience has often taught
that violent changes still shake and distemper an estate, ordinary evils being
more tolerable then an unexperienced mischief (...) hence this saying was so
often inculcated and that by none of the meanest

Medium non deserit unquam, Neither is it possible (unless quos perdere vult
Jupiter dementat prius) that they should forget their loyalty and due respect
to their Sovereign, it being not the least means to perpetuate the glory of
so high an advancement, especially meeting with such great encouragements of
expressing their faithful alleagiance through the temper, moderation, and
religious demeanor, which (so manifestly) has of late shown it self to the
whole world by his Majesty's gracious compliance with his honorable Assembly,
his willingness not only to assent to matters of an equal indifferency, but
to things (not only ungranted, but) undesired from any of his Predecessors. Nay
from whatsoever has bin most dear unto him, whereby to manifest his desire of
peace; his care of his Kingdoms, the welfare of his subjects, and his hearty
sincerity toward the profession of the true Protestant Religion; and whereas
many Princes have bin forced to sacrifice their favorites to the fury of the
multitude, how willingly nay how freely has he left those who have expected
their greatest shelter from him, to their deserved trial: and casting away all
respects of favor and affection referred the suspected to their condign
punishment. No speech being so frequent or so well becoming so Royal an
Orator as fiat justitia; nay perceiving the sad estate of that bleeding
Kingdom so near her ruin through the unheard of cruelties of an unmercifull
people, and after many fervent desires, inducements, and commands for the
relief of their misery (as being yet not s^ thoroughly sensible and assistant)
how forward and urgent has he been to adventure his Sacred person; had his
Majesty been addicted to any more the^ ordinary vice, (Princes not wanting
their especial fault^s wherein they are uncontrollable) some color of censure
might have been pleaded by the ignorant, misjudging, and ill affected
multitude, but where has appeared so much lenity in forgiving; justness
inpunishing, so much open profession, and private devotion in the exercises of
the true Religion. Whence come the numberless Pamphlets of these distracted
times, seditious Sermons or rather exclamations, tending to disorder, faction
and mutiny; how come so many leaves to become Libells, venting the invective
spleen of their brainlesse fancies, proceeding from filed tongues but defiled
hearts* such black-mouthed Machiauells (who will stumble at a Straw and for
their own advantage leap over a Block) should know, that Princes whilst they
live are Gods, and especially anointed from above, whom they ought not to
touch neither to Exo. 22. 28. Act. 23. 5.

thought; how far then such are from being subject to the higher powers, and
from submitting themselves to every ordinance for the Lords sake let the world
judge. It being I believe no part of their study or profession to fear God,
and honor the King; which makes that great Council so assiduous for the
discovery of these incendiaries, without whose freedom or connivance
questionless they assume this liberty, they well understanding, that the true
Christian Religion which has all the marks both of extreme justice and
profit has none more apparent then the exact commendation due to authority,
and that all their late fractions and grief of heart (through so greata
distance between them and the breath of their Nostrills) has proceeded through
the raising and encouragement of turbulent and seditious spirits, dissuading
tender consciences from yielding a due obedience to their superiors, with
sinister and affected distinctions, which being once harbored, the peace of
this Kingdom will speedily be dissolved; and what is it else after so
prosperous and hopeful a beginning, which has been the Remora to hinder the
weighty employments now in agitation, and every minute groaning for a speedy
event, but the woeful interruptions of Malignant dispositions? The time was,
and not long since, when the Sun shined most clearly in our troubled Horizon,
yielding as sweet an influence of Royal love as ever appeared in so drooping
a Hemisphere, until the black-cloudes of faction and disobedience obscured so
glorious a Majesty; O that there had never been occasion offered for so great
a distance and that those troublesome spirits might at last (through a condign
punishment) be truly sencible of so great a fraction; but it is not the least
part of their policy (by disguising their intents under the gloss of a few
smooth speeches) to avoid the notice of those grave Censors now assembled; who
well consider, that as children (striving to reduce a Mass of quicksilver to
a certain number) the more they press it to their will, the farther they
provoke the liberty of so generous a metal, which by dispersing it self
seems to scorn their art; even so by (too violently) extending and
diversifying difficulties (especially reflecting on so high a nature) they
should rather agravate then contract them; still taking all opportunities to
impart their duty to their supreme head, being well advised that a multitude
of opinionated and dissenting governors are for the most part accompanied with
confusion; And O that I could herein wave the mis-suggestions of the vulgar but
I cannot deprecate this truth, seeing authority is so much vilified with the
comic liberty of the times,

Nam verae voces tum demum pectore ab imo eijciuntur. Shall the smallest
cinders of a rich matter have its value, and shall we thus audaciously pluck
off the chain from Sacred authority? Equallity is the chief groundwork *1
Pet. 2. ^. ^7.
of equity; and it is our duty to submit our selves to the King as supreme;
nec debemus esse sapientiores legibus, it being not amiss for all to observe
the Laws of the place (...). which made Varro reply (upon the invitation of
making new laws) that if he were to begin to write of Religion, he would
plainly tell what his belief were of it; but being already received, he would
speak more of it according to the custom, then the nature; neither would give
admittance for the altering of those things, acted by better judgments
contrary to the opinion and gesture of this age, wherein Porters, Pesants and
Horse-groomes, shall attribute to them selves the power of reformation, when
Barbers shops shall have their Councell-Tables; when every Mechannick shall be
a Judge and adviser; Nay the weaker Sex under pretense of Preaching shall
prescribe remedies, and tell old-wives-tales: who (though it seem neither
lawful nor laudible) have invoak't so much resolution as approbriously to
defame, where they cannot justly reform; it being as improper for them to
assume this liberty, as for the Physician to discourse of war, or a mere
Scholar ^at of the secret designs of Princes; and though it be undeniable
that as amongst the functions of the soul some are mean and base, so in the
body of a state some members will be corrupt and seditious; so certainly as
Naturalists observe, that nothing sooner then fear transportes our judgment
out of its due seat, nothing will more speedily distract and ruin a
Commonwealth, then the dangerous consequence of Teditious heads, from whose
outrageous storms even the Diadem of a Prince shall not give him shelter;
whose least policy it is not, to keep down the factious that their impotency
may afford security; and though mercy is the richest Jewel which adorneth his
Crown (it being proper for Tyrants only to cut off those Stairs by which
they climb) yet is it not unworthy their notice, always in their proceedings
against men in power, either not to strike, or strike home least afterward
they hatch revenge for the disgrace, whence their liberty (after Delinquency)
may endanger his safety. But woe to that unhappy and untimely birth, who upon
any pretended respects whatsoever, shall thus wound the sides, nay the honor
of his Soveraign^ or having (through some by-ends, private advantages or
wilful malitiousnesse drawn themselves into a state most desperate, shall
for the safety of their own lives or wretched fortunes, hazard the ruin of
their Prince or Country, sheltering their Serpentine glosses, under the
protection of an unwilling (if not giddy headed) multitude, surely against such
popular domination, a little thing would make me conceive an (almost)
inexpiable hatred: alas ^ Is not this the way to gallop to our own
destruction? I wish woeful experience may never show it, but if unfortunate in
so sad a Tragedy, well may I say with Laberius, Haec die vna plu^ vixi mihi
quam vivendum fuit, too long have I lived to be thus miserable; but I hope such
snakes shall cast their skins before they be able to disgorge their poison
Tamen hoc genus Demoniorum, in * Mat. 11. 21.
nullo potest exire nisi in oratione et jejunio; it being good for such men
sapere ad sobrietatem, least with those Donatists which Saint Austin speaks of
in his retractions, they had rather destroy themselves with fire then return
to the Church; and doubtless such as thus yield to their own arrogancy
(properly called (...)) are most destitute of reason, and will at last fall
into m^dnesse, like those who formerly would be worshipped for Gods; though I
make the question whither I may say with Agrippa, multae literae hos ad
insaniam adegerunt, it be with too much wisdom that they are besides
themselves; for certainly (like Thales) thus veiwing the Stars they may fall
into the ditch; but my charity suggests me there are not many who thus
Camaelion-like change themselves into all colors, and endeavor to occasion
the privation of our health by a wilful sickness, for if the tares should
thus outgrow the corn we are undone, unless some Sovereign balm (and that
speedily) heal the faynting pulse of this divided Kingdom; thus was the
Troyan State betrayed with Simons tears: and thus are many weak consciences
in this age seduced by Ravening Wolves in a Sheepish habit, by whom their
fancies are bound, their purses exhausted, nay their very souls* damned unless
they willingly embrace their Tenants which often carry with them Treason and
rebellion, which is no small way to raise discention in a commonwealth; and
though with an Ancient Father I may say of those men, student plus alta, quam
apta proferre, yet would (...) not incur the sensure of a Libertin, my
thoughts being so far from disliking the purity of the primitive pattern, ^s
that they chearefully acknowledge too much zeal cannot be expressed in matters
which concern the glory of God, but in some causes discretion must be the
Mode^ator when a circumstance may be used or omitted, in which respect it often
falls out that obedience is better then Sacrifice, especially when it reflects
upon matters of government, where Kings are like Planets in their Orbs under
the primum mobile, moving by the sweet ^nfluence of love, and unreproveable
motion of justice to their subjects, an unmatchable president whereof quo nulla
aetas, tulit meliorem (no age having been blessed with the like) I dare boldly
say we are now happy in, and may ^e bequeathed as a pattern to the greatest
Potentat, show^ng so much piety to God both in public and private, so much
hatred of Popery and superstition, in matters of Religion, so much endeavor
not to greive his subjects; and for that more then common blessing which
attends the peacemaker, malice it self dares not (after so late and large an
expression) to withhold the Laurel; I deny not but some bad weeds may seek
shelter from the fairest flowers, but let not therefore any blea^ed eyes,
bemisted with their own fond opinions, or benighted with groundless aims,
think to out-view his brighter rays, though some there are who have habitum
falsorum principiorum, et falsarum opinionum, et excaecauit eos malitia eorum,
who fix their envious sightes upon wrong objects, and whose malice has made
them blind; whose particular reflections may (without a prevention from heaven)
give an unhappy period to our just and longing expectations, but far be such
black-clouds, from troubling our Horizon, withal ill advised heads, which
endeavor to undermine the groundwork of our present State, which build with
untempered mortar, or with unkindly flashes menace to set Religion and good
order in a flame; let such take heed of vengeance from above. This being the
way to exhaust our treasures without sign, to turn our Temples into dens of
thieves, to make this kingdom the mirror of misery, and to render her as
odious to the whole world* who was sometimes rich in her private fortunes, happy
in the love of her neighbors, stately in her structures* dreadful to her
enemies, and surrounded with an Ocean of all delights. These will be the events
of sudden innovations, and questionless those who thus attempt the change of
government may not be excused from distaste at the governors, though never so
much cloaked with the pretense of Loyalty; how safe is it when we are in a goo^
way, to avoid those by paths, which under the show o^ neernesse may prove not
only difficult but dangerous, tha^ policy being no less unprofitable then
unworthy to be commended which learn's us the hurt of ill council by
experience. And of him who is this way officious we may say, homo curiosus
utilior est hostibus quam sibi, he is more helpful to his enemies then himself;
and if any be displea'd with the present condition of their Prince or
goverment^ let them notwithstanding give Caesar his due, and neglect him not
who by no ordinary providence is appointed their supreme, you ought not to
tell him how. You will be governed, let your dispute be turned into
supplication* and if petitions may not prevail, O presume not to let your
swords come near the lap of his garment; so long as his commands are just obey
what he injoynes, and were i^ so that he sought to deprive you of your laws or
liberties goods or lives, yet should you not curse him in your heart no not
speak of him with an unbeseeming respect, but desire him by whom Princes rule
to rectify his heart, and in the mean time give you patience to suffer and
obey. And if therebe any which has more immediately tasted of his justice,
clemency, or favor, O how opprob^ious a thing is ^t and unworthy to be
mentioned, that such favorites should ^urne Apostates, abusing their received
kindness to the in^ury of the giver, retorting those freely bestowed benefits
^ike swords into his breast, certainly amongst all the ungratefullest of the
sons of men those are the worst; and for ^hy part who know how preposterous
it is for the feet to spurn at the head, being truly sencible what thy sins
have deserved, (and embracing the stroke) ve^west the approaching dangers (as
for some more then ordinary cause proceeding from the first agent) be not
dismayed, when a quiet conscience and preparation for a better life will be thy
comfort, then let the world ^osse as it list, and vary it self (as it ever
does) in storms and calmes, thy rest is pitched a loft above the sphere of
changeable mortallity, securely relying on the unevitable decree of an all
seeing providence, whose ground cannot be crossed with second thoughts or
unlooked for events. The Lillies then shall be thy comfort against the disasters
of the times, and thy repose on those words, man lives not by bread only,
neither comes promotion from the East or West: absence shall make the benefit
more acceptable* thy want shall not be thy hell, neither shall thy heart grow
heavy with the lightness of thy fortune, or thy mirth end with thy store; what
though some strange revolutions, and portending Comets seem to affright thy
tender senses? threatening the speedy annihillation of all things with their
streaming flashes? what though the raging seas exceed their bounds, bending
their swelling tides against the Crystal Heaven? what though dreadful
Bellona, with thundering reports and warlicke rumors invite thy trouble? yet
with cheerfulness may thou look up to that Star imbroidered Coat; that
Canopy of silver spangles, whence those glorious lights shall not dazell, but
direct thee, the rolling axell-tree shall support thee, those orderly Sphearick
Planets shall shelter thee, the Ovall Orb with its glassy wall shall defend
thee, thy soul being still furnish^ with oil for the Bridegrooms coming,
shall joyfully expect a passage from her teadious aprentiship, and death which
is the greatest of thy fears shall be but the rising of thy comforts, and
setting of thy crosses, a harbor for thy hope, a Sanctuary for thy sorrow, and
a welcome minute to free thee from the wretchedness of this life, to the joys
of heaven. Yea* though Han^bal be (as it were) now at our gates, and the
warlike allarums of beating Drums and sounding Trumpets (which are at this
present hourly in thy ears) send death to summon thee, to rest from thy
labors, yet thy sins being limited, thy conscience quieted and the world
renounced, some glorious star (directed by a supreme providence) shall lead
thee to a safer condition, where the thought of thy pain shall ease thee, the
remembrance of thy death revive thee, the dissolution of thy body unite thee,
and having at last soared above the clouds of those raging Tempests, disdained
the Rocks of adversity, triumph't in the tumultuous waves of misery^ scorned
the sulphury vapors of detracting obloquie and (after this sollitary night of
darkness) taken thy leave of all troublesome accidents, bidding farewell to thy
wants and miseries, thy soul shall sweetly solace her self in (...)
everlasting repose and contentment.

FINIS.
