A most sweet Song of an English Merchant-man, born in Chichester.
To an Excellent New Tune.


A Rich merchant-man there was,
that was both grave and wise,
Did kill a man at Embden town,
through quarrels that did rise,
Through quarrels that did rise;
the German being dead,
And for that fact the merchant-man
was judged to lose his head:
A sweet thing is love,
it rules both heart and mind.
There is no comfort in the world
to women that are kind.
A scaffold builded was,
within the marketplace,
And all the people far and near,
did thither flock apace:
Did thither flock apace,
this doleful sight to see.
Who all in velvet black as jet,
unto the place came he:
A sweet, etc.
Bear-headed as he was,
his hands was bound before,
A cambrick ruff about his neck,
as white as milk he wore:
His stockings were of silk,
as fine as fine might be,
Of person and of countenance,
a proper man was he:
A sweet, etc.
When he was mounted up
upon the scaffold high,
All women said, Great pity it was
so sweet a Man should dye:
The merchants of the town,
from death to set him free,
Did proffer there a thousand pound,
but yet all would not be:
A sweet thing is love,
it rules both heart and mind,
There is no comfort in the world,
to women that are kind.
The prisoner hereupon,
began to speak his mind,
Quoth he, I have deserved death,
in conscience I do find:
Yet sore against my will,
this man I killed, quoth he.
As Christ does know, which of my soul
must only Savior be:
A sweet, etc.
With heart I do repent
this most unhappy deed,
And for his wife and children small,
my very heart does bleed:
The deed is done and past,
my hope of life is vain,
And yet the loss of this my life,
to them is little gain:
A sweet, etc.
Unto the widow poor,
and to the babes therefore,
I give a hundred pound a piece,
their comfort to restore:
Desiring at their hands,
no one request but this,
They will speak well of Englishmen,
though I have done amiss:
A sweet thing is love,
it rules both heart and mind,
There is no comfort in this world,
like women that are kind.
This was no sooner done,
but that to stint the strife,
Four goodly maids did proffer him,
for love to save his life:
This is our law, quoth they,
we may your death remove.
So you in lieu of our good will,
will grant to us your love:
A sweet, etc.
Brave Englishman, quoth one,
It Is I will save thy life;
Nay quoth the second, it is I,
so I may be thy Wife;
It Is I, the third did say;
Nay, quoth the fourth, it is I,
So each one after the other said,
still waiting his reply:
A sweet, etc.
Fair maidens, every one;
I must confess and say,
That each of you well worthy is
to be a lady gay:
And I unworthy far,
the worst of you to have,
Though you have proffered willingly
my loathed life to save:
A sweet thing is love,
it rules both heart and mind.
There is no comfort in this world,
to women that are kind.
Then take a thousand thanks,
of me a dying man,
But speak no more of love or life,
for why my life is gone:
To Christ my soul I give,
my body unto death,
For none of you my heart can have,
since I must leave my breath:
A sweet, etc.
Fair maids, lament no more,
your country law is such,
It takes but hold upon my life,
my goods it cannot touch:
Within one chest I have
in gold a thousand pound,
I give it equal to you all,
for love that I have found;
A sweet, etc.
And now dear Friends farewell,
sweet England now adieu,
And Chicester where I was born,
where first this breath I drew:
And now thou man of death,
unto thy weapon stand.
O nay, another damsel said,
sweet Headsman hold thy hand:
A sweet, etc.
Now hear a maiden's plain,
brave Englishman, quoth she,
And grant me love for love again,
that craves but love of thee:
I woo and sue for love,
that had been wooed e're this,
Then grant me love, and therewithal:
she proffered him a kiss:
A sweet thing is love,
it rules both heart and mind.
There is no comfort in this world
to women that are kind.
I Will dye within thy arms,
if thou will dye, quoth she,
Yet live or dye, sweet Englishman,
I Will live and dye with thee.
But can it be (quoth he)
that thou do love me so!
It Is not by long acquaintance, sir,
whereby true love does grow:
A sweet thing is love,
it rules both heart and mind.
There is no comfort in this world
to women that are kind.
Then beg my life, quoth he,
and I will be thy own;
If I should seek the world for love,
more love cannot be shown:
The people at that word,
did give a joyful cry,
And said, Great pity it was
so sweet a man should dye:
A sweet, etc.
I go, my love, she said,
I run, I fly for thee,
And gentle head^man spare a while
my lover's head for me:
Unto the Duke she went,
who did her grief remove,
And with a hundred maidens more,
she went to fetch her love.
A sweet, etc.
With music sounding sweet,
the foremost of the train,
The gallant maiden like a bride,
did fetch him back again;
Yea, hand in hand away they went,
unto the Church that day,
And there were married presently,
in sumptuous rich array;
A sweet, etc.
To England came he then,
with his fair Lady bride,
A fairer creature never lay
by any merchant's side,
Where we must leave them now,
in pleasure and delight,
But of their names and dewlling place.
I must not here recite.
A sweet thing is love,
it rules both heart and mind,
There is no comfort in the world
to women that are kind.
