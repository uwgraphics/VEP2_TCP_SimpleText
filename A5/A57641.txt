The ROSE of Delight, Or, An excellent new Song in the praise of His GRACE
James D. of Monmouth: My Female Wishes may they never end,
For I Great Monmouth still will be thy friend,
While I retain my poor immortal soul,
I Will Joy with thee, and wanting thee condoul.

Tune of, No, no it is in vain to sigh and complain,
^ NOtwithstanding the frown the descends from the Crown on my Lord that once
was so dear, ^ Preferred above other, undone by a Brother, and the hate of an
Uncle so near, then ^et them tread on ^ and end as begun, my love it shall
never be forgot, but in envy's despite I Will take my delight in Monmouth; never
known in a Plot.

Of great places at Court,
Turned him out, as a sport,
Pretending that he soared too high,
Or fearing he might
At last claim a Right
And become a great Beam in their Eye;
'Cause the Mobile ran
And admired each man,
Yea, Welcomed him with a glad Heart,
But who can do less
For whom God does bless,
since Monmouth we know thy desert.
These monsters of Rome
They first hatched his Doom,
Because that he stood in their way,
And stopped their Carrire,
When their Plots did appear,
To make our Religion their Prey:
Now each Famous Lord,
As much is abhorred
And termed as great monsters as he
By that Tory Crew,
Who has nothing to do
But scandal brave Monmouth's degree.
May they Shimei like
In Cursing delight,
Till the Fall on their own Heads rebound,
And he like the Palm
Suppressed, firmer stand,
And the more shall be blessed with Renown,
For who can he be
That Is so happy as he,
That smilingly so can forgive,
The dangers of late,
supposed from the State,
Brave Monmouth be happy, and live.
For the Heavens may grow clear,
And great Charles may appear
With the smiles of a King as before,
As he promised to me,
He ever would be,
And he my great Monmouth restore
To hi^ Places of state,
That he may be great,
And his Enemies unmasked may be,
Who endeavored to bring
Him in frown^ with the King:
Brave Monmouth I love Charles and thee.
May thy Royal Father
Sway the Scepter for ever,
And flourishing Gov^^n this Land,
May the Turk and the Athiest,
Presbiterian and Papist
Turn one, and in Unity stand,
Then shall be firm Peace,
And our Jar's they shall cease,
In Church, Government when we agree,
And in the mean time,
may the Crown keep the line;
Brave Monmouth we happier shall be.
