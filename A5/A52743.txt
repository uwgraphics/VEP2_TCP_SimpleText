A NECESSARY WARNING TO THE MINISTRY OF THE KIRK OF SCOTLAND, From the
meeting of the Commissioners Of the General Assembly At Edinburgh 4. Jan. 1643.

Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw
away disciples after them: therefore watch, etc. Acts 20.30.31. EDINBURGH,
Printed by Evan Tyler, Printer to the Kings most excellent Majesty. 1643.

IT should be unto us no small matter of grief, that the Lord having done so
great things for us, and by his mavelous and merciful providence, having
according to our desires settled the truth of Religion, with Peace and Liberty
within this Kingdom, while other Kirks and Kingdoms about us are in so great
trouble, The Work of GOD should be so little regarded, and the spirit of Error
and Heresy, of Schism and Division, and of Atheism and Profanity, should
appear again, and be hearkened unto by any amongst us: yet should we think it
to be no strange or new thing, that Satan rage to be cast out of his Kingdom,
that Heresies, Sects and Profanity, which must be, and have ever less or more
infested the Kirk of Christ, show themselves, and set up their heads amongst us
in this springtime of Reformation, especially they being fomented by that
influence which the present troubles of our neighboring Kirks and Kingdoms
have upon this Kirk and Kingdom.

It is time for all the People of God, and after a special manner for us who
are the Ministers of the Gospel, seriously to set our selves to the performance
of the duty required of us, and in all vigilancie and faithfulness to use the
best means for preserving the rich Treasure committed to us, for transmitting
it without mixture, schism, or pollution to the posterity, and so far as in
us lies, to propagate the same to other Nations, which the Supreme providence
is preparing and making meet to receive so great an happiness.

First of all we have to take heed to our selves, that our hearts be right and
sincere in the sight of God, and that none of us be in the gall of bitterness,
or in the bond of iniquity, against the Work of Reformation, or against any
Article of that Covenant, which we have before God and the world so solemnly
sworn and subscribed: for if our own conscience condemn us, we will deal but
treacherously with the adversary in the cause of God.

Secondly, we are to look to the enemies of Religion, which are of three sorts:
Papists, Separatists, and malignant, malcontent, and profane Time-servers.

Concerning Papists: as we are encouraged by the Civil power and authority,
which will see the Laws executed against them, when it comes to their part,
so have we a particular and full direction in the late and former General
Assemblies, for our proceeding against them, and must be answerable for our
diligence to the next General Assembly; and therefore our care must be to
follow forth the Acts of the Assemblies in all points: But with an intention,
not so much to be rid of their persons for our ease, as to deliver them from
their error for their own salvation, which is a Work requiring great wisdom,
zeal and diligence on our part. And so much the more, that they are universally
kn^wn by their speeches, carriage, and hopes, grounded upon the confusion and
distemper of the times, to be more insolent and presumptuous then before.

Concerning Separatists upon the other hand: there be but very few in the Land
who profess themselves to be of that sort, and therefore the evil requires
rather a prevention then a cure. For this end these directions may serve:

First, that every Minister take such heed to himself, and his own Family, both
in private worship, and practice of Religion, that his Family may be a pattern
to all the Families of the Flock, and his own life and conversation a visible
example, and real proof of his doctrine: So shall the people know by the eye,
how and after what manner to practice that which they hear; they shall esteem
reverently of his judgment, and shall not be easily drawn from him, and from
the Flock which is fed by such a Pastor.

That by our doctrine in public, and by our conference in private, we labor
to bring the people to the sense of so great a mercy as God has shown to this
Land, in setting up our Reformation again: This will be a mean to keep them
from Popery in substance and ceremony, and from the love of all, whether
novation or separation.

That we be diligent in catechizing, and frequent in visiting particular
Families, for discharging the duties of our Pastoral Function, and especially
for setting up the worship of God in every Family, and enquiring how and by
whom it is performed: for the ignorant are easily drawn away by Sectaries and
Seducers, the profane that live without the worship of God, are alike disposed
to all Religions; and such as are in the general piously affected, and have
not the worship of God, in the Families wherein they live, do seek after it
where they may have it, and are ready rather then to want it altogether, to
suffer themselves to be drawn away into error.

That such as are rude and ignorant of the Principles of Religion, and such as
are notoriously profane and scandalous in life, be suspended from the
Communion; but so, as all diligence be used to inform the one sort, and
reform the other, which shall be a mean both to save their souls, and to
remove one principal pretext of Separation.

That when we hear there is danger of Popery or Separation, the absurdities
of the one and the other, which are many and gross, be frequently and plainly
represented to the People, that they may be brought to the detestation thereof,
and to the Love of the truth, and to steadfastness in the Reformed Religion.

That when we speak against the ignorance and profanitie of many of our common
Professors, we take heed that we give not occasion to any to abstain from
communicating with them in the external means, and to run away in the way of
schism and separation: And when we speak against Separatists, that we give no
occasion to the profane, to mock at the power and practice of Religion, or at
separation from the bad customs of the world, and the sins of the time. And
therefore a clear distinction would be made betwixt the Spirit of God, and
private spirits; betwixt Sanctification, and this separation; betwixt a
Spiritual, and a schismatic disposition; betwixt separatists, and such as
of late were called Precisians, and Puritans, who indeed were no other but the
Godly, longing after, and now resting in the Reformation of Religion; betwixt
Families worshipping God, and secret congregations or conventicles; and betwixt
the necessary duty of the Master of a Family, and promiscuous prophesying or
interpreting of Scripture. When a word is spoken against schism or separation,
a word also would be spoken for preventing the mis-application of the profane,
of the worldling, and of the carnal professor.

That as we have been, and have reason still to be zealous against all the
seeds of Popish superstition, and heresy, so must we often give warning to all
the Godly, to beware of the smallest beginnings, and least degrees of
separation, and of countenancing of such as under the color, whether of
singular zeal and holiness, or of the gifts of Illumination, or of Prayer, or
presence of the Spirit, go about as idle and busybodies, speaking evil of
that which they know not, and against all Christian Piety and Charity,
seeking to disgrace the Work of Reformation, and the Teachers and Professors
of the true Religion; remembering that Satan can transform himself into an
Angel of light: As also to take heed to such as bewray their inclination that
way, by absenting themselves from the Communion, by bringing home, or spreading
of Books and Pamphlets which press separation, and such other means; And for
this effect recommends to Presbyteries the observation of the Acts of General
Assemblies thereanent.

Concerning the third sort of Enemies, the malignants, whether they be such as
from the beginning did oppose the work of Reformation of Religion in this Land,
or such as show themselves, upon what soever pretense, backward and disaffected
to the Reformation of Religion in England, so much endeavored by this Kirk
from our zeal to the glory of Christ, our desire of the happiness of the
neighboring kingdoms, our fears of apparent danger to the Religion here, if
they be not made one with us in unity of Religion and uniformitie of
Kirk-Government, and our hopes, by the blessing of God, to have a pattern from
the word set up in this Island for the exsample of other Kirks abroad; Because
Enemies of this kind may prove most dangerous, if they be not discovered and
avoided, it is at this time a chief part of our duty to make such malignants
known to the people, that they be not deceived and drawn away from their own
steadfastness, and from the love of Christ, and their brethren: But in doing
this duty, we have great need of wisdom, and the spirit of discerning, that
we neither take our Friends to be our Enemies, and by that mistake discourage
the well affected, and multiply Enemies against our selves, nor such as are
indeed Enemies to be our Friends, and thereby wrong the cause of God, and
weaken our selves in seeking after Reformation. And therefore they must not be
taken for Enemies who hope the best of the Kings Majesty, and profess that
they love His Honor (which is the calumny of the malignant against the
seekers of Reformation) nor such as in the beginning through want of persuasion
were not so forward for Reformation, nor such as in debate of matters do
possibly differ in their judgment from others about some circumstances and
midses which may lead to the desired end of unity in Religion; providing their
conversation be such as beseems the gospel of Christ, and for the substance
and reality of their Speeches and Actions in private and public, they be known
to contribute their best endeavors for Reformation.

Upon the other part such as be Enemies indeed may be known: First by their
malicious censuring and calumniating of the Civil and Ecclesiastical meetings
of this Kirk and Kingdom which are held for conserving of peace betwixt the
Kingdoms, and for endeavoring by all good means the unity of Religion, as if
they tended to the diminution of the King His Greatness and Authority in
England: Secondly, by their despising or mis-regarding of the public
resolutions agreed upon for so good ends: Thirdly, by their notable injuring
the Kings Majesty in His Honor, in attributing to His Majesty whatsoever is
plotted by bad Counselors, or acted by the Popish and Prelaticall party, as
if there were not a difference betwixt the King and them, or betwixt the King
His Authority and the pretense and abuse thereof: Fourthly, by slandering and
traducing all such as labor to promove the Reformation in England, not sparing
them who are in places of government, and whom God has honored to be worthy
instruments in our own Reformation, as if they were Enemies to the Kings
Honor, and were serving their own private ends without respect to the public:
Fifthly, by their going about and endeavoring to make the hearts and hands of
others to faint in the work of Reformation; and if it were possible, to make
them as malignant and disaffected as themselves: Sixthly, by laboring to bring
the Parliament of England in suspicion, as if they intended to cast off the
yoke of Royal Authority, or intended not the Reformation of Religion, and
Unity with this Kirk: Seventhly, by their insolency and boasting when they
hear of the success of the Popish and Prelaticall party, and their readiness
to assist them according to their power, whereby they bewray their fear of the
Reformation of Religion, and their hopes to see the day when they shall be
avenged upon such as they malign at home. When they are known by these and the
like practices, we ought to warn the People to beware of their company,
counsels and seducements: And because such malignants shroud themselves under
the false pretense of loyalty to the Kings Majesty, without respect to
Religion, or the good of the public; we ought in all our speeches and prayers
to testify our faithfulness, and high respects to the Kings Majesty, and
also to press and pray for the unity of Religion, and for prospering all the
good ways that may conduce for so blessed a work, as serving for the honor of
GOD, and for the King His greatness, and the true peace of His Kingdoms,
declaring all such as oppose the unity of Religion to be enemies to God, to
the King, and to the peace and prosperity of the Kingdoms.

Next, since it is incumbent to us by our calling, and committed to us by the
General Assembly, according to our callings, to use all Lawful and
Ecclesiastical ways for furtherance of Reformation and Unity of Religion, for
continuance of our own peace at home, and of the common peace betwixt the
Kingdoms, A necessity is laid upon us:

the Protestant Religion through the Popish Armies in England and Ireland,
pretending that they are better and more dutiful Subjects then the
Protestants, but intending no less then the ruin of the reformed Religion,
and the planting of that Heresy, Idolatry and Tyranny, in a more compendious
way then could have been done by the late Service Book, and Book of Canons. In
which course if they shall by their power prevail, it will be impossible for
the Kings Majesty to suppress Popery, and maintain the true Religion
conform to the many promises contained in His Majesty's Declarations; they
will soon cast off their professed allegiance and subjection; and it will be
no easy matter for this Kirk and Kingdom, whence they conceive all their
troubles and disappointments have issued, to resist their violence, especially
considering what a disaffected and discontented party we have at home in our
own bosom.



established in His Majesty's presence, and with his Royal consent in both
Parliaments.



That the Presbytery be careful to discern and try these malignants, and to
reclaim or censure them, according to the Acts of the Assembly, and to make
report of their diligence to the next Assembly.

And because while the Commissioners of the Assembly are guarding themselves
against the opposition of these Enemies, they are secretly and covertly opposed
by a malignant Petition, crossing an humble Petition of theirs, presented to
the Lords and others Commissioners for conserving of Peace; against which, as
destructive of all that they had been building up, they were constrained to
emit their Declaration, which is sent also with this Warning, to all the
Ministry in the Land: it is necessary that the foresaid Declaration be
diligently perused by the Ministers, and by them made known and published to
all the people, that they be not deceived and drawn away from their
steadfastness, by the cunning and craft of the secret and subtle Enemies of our
National Covenant, upon any pretense whatsoever: And if any shall be found to
deal for subscribing the Cross Petition, and thereby to work division in the
Ministry, or among the People; or if any of the Ministry, (which God forbid)
shall be found to favor, countenance, or speak in defense thereof, or be
remiss in publishing the Declaration, in that case the Presbytery to proceed
against them as dis-covenanters, and enemies to the peace of the Kirk and
Kingdom, and to the intended unity of Religion, whatsoever their professed
intentions, and specious pretexts be to the contrary, as they will be
answerable to the next General Assembly: to which both we for our directions,
and they for their diligence must render a reckoning.

In end, because much every way does depend upon us of the Ministry, we have
need to stir up our selves to faithfulness in every pastoral duty, and to
keep our selves and the People in truth and unity. Which by the blessing of God
will be a powerful mean to preserve our Religion, and to propagate the same to
other Kirks, groaning under their several burdens, and panting for such a
Reformation as the Lord in mercy has granted unto us.

The Commissioners of the General Assembly upon mature deliberation judge it
necessary, that this Warning be publicly read in all the Parish Kirks, that
secret enemies may be discovered, and that none of the people pretend ignorance
in joining less or more, with any of the said three sorts of enemies.

A SOLEMN FAST AND HUMILIATION Appointed by the Commissioners of the General
Assembly, to be kept through the whole Kingdom, upon the last Sabbath of
February, and the next Thursday thereafter.
WHereas by the late General Assembly, power is committed to us to consider
and perform what we find necessary by all lawful and Ecclesiastic ways,
for furtherance of the Union in Religion, and Unity in Kirk-government, for
continuance of our own Peace at home, and of the common Peace betwixt the
Kingdoms: We find it necessary, that there shall be a Solemn Fast and
Humiliation kept in all the Kirks of this Kingdom, on the last Sabbath of
February, and the Thursday next thereafter, for the causes and motives
following.

of all ranks and callings are grown lukewarm, and are content with a mere
formalitie, and show of Godliness, without the inward power; yea, the most
part are profane; so that Blasphemy, Profanation of the Sabbath, Fornication,
Adultery, Drunkenness, and other vices abound as much as before in the time of
corruption* Family worship, mutual edification, and stirring up one of another
by information, admonition, consolation, rebuke much neglected, and Ministers
negligent in urging the same. All which are so much the more heinous, because
of our unthankfulness after so great mercies, and breach of Covenant.





Majesty's Dominions; especially that God would grant a good success to the
treaty and travels of the Commissioners for the conservation of Peace, and a
gracious acceptance to the Supplications unto His Majesty from the Lords of
Council, and the Commissioners both of Parliament, and of the General
Assembly.





FINIS.
