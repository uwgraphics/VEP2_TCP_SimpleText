Wherein they may clearly see themselves in their Persons, Offices, in their
Lives and Conversations.

THE BISHOPS Looking-glass.
THere is nothing more necessary for Mariners on the vast Ocean, than a
Prospective glass, to descry their enemies thereby to defend and preserve
themselves, looking in such a glass they my perceive things a far off as near
at hand; by which means they are the sooner readier to oppose an enemy and
prevent danger. Even so necessary is this Mirror, this Land-Glasse I intend to
treat of (a Parliament) in this may be discovered who are enemies and who
friends to the Kingdom, who are friends and who enemies to themselves: In this
Glass may be clearly discerned what dangers are near, and how to avoid and
prevent the same. This Looking-glass I have denominated the Bishops Mirror or
the Clergies Prospective, not but that it is necessary, yea of absolute
necessity for the whole State and body Pollitique of this Kingdom to look
into: But my reason why I attribute to it this only denomination is, because
these Persons of the Clergy, as well great Prelates as inferious Ministers,
have been the only Enemies of this Kingdom, as well to the Religion, as Civil
Laws and Statutes ordained for the Government thereof.

In this Prospective they may, if they look but in it, see clearly themselves
and all their actions; they may by the same discern the danger they are in,
and what means they may best use for prevention thereof: And in speaking
hereof, I shall observe 2 principal things.

1 The best way to look in this Glass to discern rightly. 2 When having
perfect sight herein, rightly to descry how to preserve the spectators from
danger, if they perceive themselves defective.
And first of the manner of looking in this Mirror, and that is twofold.

First, as the spectators are constrained to present themselves to the view
thereof; and secondly, as voluntarily of themselves look therein: And by this
we may perceive the exceeding virtue of this Mirror, in drawing to its view
like the Lodestone, persons be they never so refractory, never so obstinate,
be their hea^ts like Iron, this Glass if but looked into will make them
compliable, and mollify their cruel and hard-hartednesse. And secondly, the
virtue thereof, in refreshing, comforting, and curing the wounds, sores and
diseases, the spectators perceive themselves by the same to be infected withal.

1 And for the first, constrained inspection into this Prospective, is a
necessary virtue belonging to the same, for man by nature given altogether to
uncleannes and impurity being infected with all kind of wickedness and impiety,
blinded in understanding, averse in will and affection to any thing that is
good, unwilling to look into and examine themselves, or to be discerned and
taken notice of by others, thereby nourishing and suffering their infectious
diseases to spread and increase, not only in themselves, to the indangering
and hastening of their perpetual destructions, but is catching to others, and
of such a dangerous nature is this sickness of perverse and unclean spirits,
that when once caught, not easily again to be removed or cured by any ordinary
means, but requires great skill and extraordinary pains to remove and cure
the same, so that this virtue in this Prospective is for the reasons I have
alleged, not only necessary, but of absolute necessity.

2 Another virtue there is in this Glass, and that is the sovereign power and
efficacy thereof, in curing and remedyingall diseases and infirmities whatsoever
the State is infected withal, no ulcer being never so dangerous, no sore be it
never so infectious, but viewing it in this Mirror, will receive remedy; no
discontent, or trouble of mind whatsoever, of any person, of what degree or
dignity soever, of what function or profession soever, ^ut may receive comfort,
and contentment, and be pacified, if they view themselves in this Prospective,
and thus much of the 2 prime and sovereign virtues this Glass is attended and
endowed withal.

I come now to p^osecute my intentions touching the right manner of looking
into this Mirror, and that as I said is twofold.

1 Constrained obedience in presenting themselves to the view of this Glass,
the sovereign power of this Mirror in this particular, I have somewhat already
touched only, serving for proof of the necessity of this virtue. I now will
handle the virtue it self, the power and sovereignty of this Prospective is so
great, and spacious, that it brings within its circumference all persons
whatsoever in this Kingdom, from the highest to the lowest, no person be he
never so high in authority, never so great in honor and dignity, never so well
favored and beloved, either of his Prince or the People, of never so holy a
function and profession, be he of never so politic and subtle a Wit, and
Understanding; be he never so private in his actions and designs, but will he,
nill he, he must view himself and be viewed in this Glass, if he be within
the Circuit and Compass thereof: and thus much shall serve to be spoken of
the power of this Prospective.

2 I come to speak of the willing spectators that present themselves to the
view thereof, in which I observe these particulars.

1 Such persons as by command from the King present themselves cheerfully to
his Majesty with their advise and counsels in the service both of their King
and Country.

2 Such persons as present themselves to the view of this great Counsel by
Petitions and Complaints, wherein they set forth their diseases, griefs and
infirmities, wherewith they are pained and oppressed, not naturally infected
withal. The first of these I will not speak otherwise o^, than as the only
subject of my discourse, upon which the second has its only dependence, and
from and by which it only expects ease and redress; and this is the only
manner and best means to discover their griefs, and diseases, by their
Petitions, Remonstrances and Complaints, and the soonest way for speedy remedy.

And this brings me to the second thing I intimated at the beginning of this
Treatise, and that is the diseases and infirmities, nay the most dangerousest
wounds in a Commonwealth, that may be discovered by this Glass, and then the
remedies to salve and cure the same.

1 The diseases are many and great that have catched and infected both many and
great persons, and by them cast abroad and spread even over the whole Kingdom,
I will only name the chiefest and greatest wounds and sores of this State,
which has almost brought the same to destruction, the persons infected
herewith, and the Manner of their infecting many others with the same plagues.

The first disease in this Kingdom, was Innovation in Religion.

2 Endeavoring to subvert the Laws of this Land.

3 To endeavor to overthrow Parliaments, and destroy the just rights and
Privileges thereof, the securest and safest way of Government that ever was
in this Kingdom,

4 Oppression, Injustice, and cruel tyranny used and exercised over the
persons, lives, and estates of his Majesty's loving subjects, by Superiors, and
men in places of Authority.

5 Extortion, bribery and the like, used in Courts of Judicature.

6 Ship money, Leavies, Taxes, Customs, and the like illegally leavied upon
the subject.

7 And lastly undermining circumvention, and overburthening the Subjects by
unlawful Grants, Patents, and Leases of Offices and almost of all Commodities
of Free trade in this Land: And thus much of the diseases, I come now to the
Authors hereof, which have procured this general infection spread throughout
the Kingdom; and they I conceive to be of the best sort of men, the greatest
in Honor and Dignity, both Spiritual and Temporal, as well as the Inferior:
As 1, Bishops, Deanes, Archdeacons, Doctors, Proctors, Ordinaries and other
Officers, and men of account and authority in the Clergy. 2, Privy Counselors,
Peers, Noblemen, Lords and others following the Court, and have got into their
Princes favor. 3, Judges, and other Officers in places of Judicature. 4,
Pattentees, Grantees, Lessees and Farmers of Customs, and the like: These I
conceive have been the only authors and producers of all the troubles,
miseries, and diseases of this Kingdom: And now I come to the manner of their
increasing and spreading these their Plots and dangerous actions over the whole
Land; in which I shall only speak of the Bishops and Clergy, this present
Treatise, being only attributed to themselves and the troubles and distempers
by them raised in this body Pollitique is to be considered in three respects:
1, In respect of their Persons, in respect of their Offices, and in respect of
their Practices, in their Lives and Conversation.

1 In respect of their Persons Bishops; in great authority and power, not only
Teachers, but Rulers of the Children of God, Shepherds over the flock of
Christ; these persons being infected with Pride, Ambition, Hautinesse of heart,
with Popish superstition, Ceremonies, Arminianisme and the like; corrupt in
Doctrine and profane in Discipline; infected with Avarice, Luxury, and all
Laciviousnesse; puffed up with vain Glory self estimation of their own Merits,
Wisdom, and Learning, with too much confidency, trusting to their own power,
and the favor of their Prince, procured by their subtle wit and wily
practices, and upon their Alliances with Peers and other Grandees of this
Kingdom: these persons, I say, being thus infected, looking into this
Prospective may discover themselves and their infirmities, or rather
incommodities with which they are attainted,

2 I come now in the second places to their Offices, and they are two fold,
Spiritual and Temporal; the first, they claim to appartaine to the^ of that
function Jure Divino, and the latter they usurp to themselves under pretense
of both Swords, the Sword of the Spirit, and the Sword of the Magistrate: By
the first, they exercise Spiritual Jurisdiction in several Courts
Ecclesiastical: In the latter they administer Civil Injustice, Justice I
would have said, in Courts of common Judicature. I see in the first part of
their usurped authority Spiritual, they be infected with Bribery deceit,
cruelty, oppression and injustice, commanding as they are Rulers in the Church,
things not warranted by the Word of God, but altogether contrary and against
the same; Imagining the inferior Clergy to preach and teach only such things
that are delectable to their Palates, agreeable to their wills and pleasures, not
the truth but news inventions; instruments of the Devil, by him only lead,
ruled and seduced, to endeavor to build up the kingdom of Antichrist, and
hinder the increase and propagation of the Gospel and Kingdom of Christ, as
superstition, Popish Ceremonies, nay such corrupt and unfound doctrine, which
concurres altogether with the doctrine of the Church of Rome, binding men's
Consciences to the strict observance of their unlawful commands and injustly
punishing with rigor and severity, all such as in tender Conscience would not
agree or submit to the same, and comply with them in their error, degrading of
them from the Ministry, fining, imprisoning, banishing, confiscating their
goods, nay corporal punishment, as pillorcing, dismembring, branding and
stigmatizing of them and such like cruelties by them exercised and used over
Godly and Zealous Ministers, causing the flight of many hundreds, nay thousands
into Foreign nations and uninhabited and Savage Countries, to the indangering
their lives of themselves, their wives and children, and the loss of all their
fortunes to their utter impoverishment and desolation, if God of infinite mercy
had not wonderfully preserved them.

And thus much of the diseases wherewith they have infected their usurped
spiritual Jurisdiction, I proceed to their temporal: In this likewise if they
be infected with injustice and opression in their places of Civil Government:
to endeavor to seduce the Judges of the Land and other officers pertaining to
the Co^mon-Lawes of this Land in their opinions; and the better to color their
wicked practices to procure them, set forth in a high degree the Prerogative of
the King, his undoubted power and authority over the persons, lives and estates
of his Subjects, when he shall upon his own pleasure command the same: That all
the subject has is his, that the subject is but as it were tenant at will of
any thing he possesses and that it may be taken away at the pleasur^ (not of
their Lord and lawful Sovereign) but at the pleasure of the high and mighty
Prelates, who^ neither King nor Kesar must contradict or correct for their
insolences; I say if these persons have infected these their Offices usurped
either Spiritual or Temporal, with any or all of these dangerous sores before
mentioned, if they look but in this Crystal, either by constraint or
voluntarily, they may receive cure.

3 I come now to the last thing I am to speak of concerning this subject and
that is the 3 means by these persons Prelates and their adherents used to
spread abroad their venomous intentions, by their actions in their lives and
conversations; If therefore they be infected in their lives with malice, anger,
hatred, revenge of and against such as are not flexible to their dispositions,
and yielding to their desires, profane, wanton, dallying, mo^king, scoffing at
the pure and sincere preaching of the Word of God, reviling and disdaining the
painful and zealous* teachers of the same, tollerating, approving, conniving,
and wi^cking at* nay commanding as w^^^ by their Proclamations and Edicts of
their own devising and setting sorth, as instancing the same by their own
examples, using recreation, dancing, music, playing, drinking, whoring, etc.
encouraging and animating wicked and lascivious persons in their ungodly ways,
placing in the Ministry, dissolute and scandalous persons, void of all fear of
God, yea of Civil Government of themselves affable and pliable only to their
Superiors, that do by their evil examples and erroneous doctrines draw more
souls from God to the Devil than, I verily believe, would have fallen away of
themselves, if no teaching had been since these corruptions have been admitted
in Religion, both in doctrine and discipline, I say, if they have been infected
with these foul ulcers and diseases, i^ they look into this Mirror, they may
receive cure.

I come now in a word or two to the means and medicinal remedies whereby
these troubles of the Commonwealth are to be cured and removed; and they are
these.

1 By wholesome Laws by the whole King and State made for the restraining of
the exercise and longer usage of such corrupt doctrine and discipline,
superstition and ceremonies introduced and innovated in Religion by these
Prelates authors of the same.

2 For these persons thus defective, penitently to submit themselves to this
safe and secure way for their cure, and in time leave off their vicious courses
and perverse actions by them hitherto practiced.

3 And lastly, if obstinatly they refuse to submit themselves to this way and
means for their cure, but still let their corruption and infection increase to
that height that ordinary means cannot cure the same, then to cut off these as
rotten, and altogether unprofitable and dangerous members of the Commonwealth,
is the safest way to prevent future trouble by this infection: And thus much
for this present Discourse, desiring all things amiss in this Kingdom both in
Church and State, may by this Crystal Mirror be discovered and rectified, to
the everlasting peace and tranquillity of his Sacred Majesty and all his
Dominions.

FINIS.
