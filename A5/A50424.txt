To the Honorable PEREGRENE BERTIE, ESQUIRE.
May it please Your Honor,
MY present Service is so much the more valuable to me, since I was preferred
thereto by Your Recommendation, which I shall endeavor to preserve with
unwearied Industry and constant Fidelity. Your Favor, Sir, is a Blessing my
Soul is too narrow to enclose, and me thinks I can hardly be reconciled to that
Divinity which calls Pride a Sin. But if I am guilty, I heartily beg Your
pardon, and permission to subscribe,

YOUR HONORS Most humbly devoted Servant, John Main.

To the Worshipful PETER CALVERD, SAMUEL VINCENT, EDMUND BOSTOCK, JOHN PARSONS,
And RICHARD BRET, ESQUIRES, FARMERS of His Majesty's Revenue of EXCISE within
the Kingdom of England, Dominion of Wales, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed; John
Main
Wishes Increase of Happiness here, and everlastingly hereafter.

To the Reader.
HAving been commanded by my Masters into the North-west Parts of this
Kingdom, I found there many ingenious Men, employed in their Service, viz. the
Revenue of Excise, which were willing to gain some little knowledge in the Art
of Gauging, but had been frighted therefrom by the seeming difficulty of
obtaining their desires. I thought it no disservice to endeavor to inform
these Men, upon whose shoulders the whole Matter of Fact, in this Affair,
between the King and the Subject lay. And accordingly I wrote and read to some
of them these short Rules thou have now before thee, endeavoring to make the
Art plain and easy, even to the meanest Capacity, without much expense of Time
in reading the Text, or breaking his Teeth with hard Terms of Art: And not
having leisure to write so many Copies, as my Friends in those Parts desired,
and I could afford them, I am prevailed with to commit it to the Press.
Farewell.

THE PRACTICAL GAUGER.
IT would be very convenient, that every Gauger were well acquainted with the
Art of Decimal Arithmetic; but it is necessary that he be so well seen in
Vulgar, as to be able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide any whole Numbers.

It is also necessary, that he understand the three sorts of Quantity, viz. a
Line, a Superficies, and a Solid.

A Line has length, but no breadth.

A Superficies has length and breadth, but no depth.

A Solid has length, breadth, and depth.

Moreover there is no kind of Quantity but is commensurable by some Common
Measure thereto assigned, as a Line by a Line of Inches, Feet, Poles, Furlongs,
etc. and a Superficies by a Superficies, as the Square Inch, etc. and also a
Solid by a Solid: So when it is known how many Inches, Poles, or Furlongs is
contained in any Line, the length of that Line is said to be known; and when it
is known how many square Inches, square Feet, or square Perches are contained
within any Superficies, the Content or Area of that Superficies is said to be
known; and also when it is known how many solid Inches are contained in any
Solid, the Content of that Solid is known.

To find the Content of a Back in the form of a Square or Parallelogram.
The Rule is:
Multiply the length by the breadth, and the Product divide by 282 (the number
of solid Inches contained in the Ale Gallon) and the Quotient is the Ale
Gallons contained upon one Inch in depth of that Back or Tun.

A Square.
^

An Oblong or Parallelogram.
^

One contains 10 Gallons, and 205/282 parts of a Gallon; the other 21 Gallons
and 128/282 of a Gallon. To reduce which Fraction into Pints, you need only
multiply the Remainder or Numerator by 8, and divide by the old Divisor, and
the Quote will be the Pints contained in that Fraction.

To find the Area or Content of one Inch of a Back or Tun, in the form of a
Triangle, in Ale Gallons:
The Rule is:
Multiply the Line a c ( viz. the Line falling perpendicularly from any Angle
on its opposite Base) by half the Line b c d, here the Base, and the Product
divide by 282, the Quotient will be the Ale Gallons contained in one Inch of
depth upon that Triangle.

Example.

^

There is contained in the first Inch of this Back or Tun 63 Ale Gallons, 6
Pints, and above an half.

But admitting the Back or Tun be of an irregular Form, divide it into
Triangles, and let fall Perpendiculars in each, and find their several Area's,
as in the last Example, then add them together, and you have the Content or
Area of the whole Figure.

Example.



First I find the Triangle abe.

^

Now in the other two Triangles, the two Perpendiculars falling upon one common
Base, I multiply the Sum of the Perpendiculars by half the Base, and that
Product is the Area or Content of both Triangles.

^

So does one Inch of this Back or Tun appear to contain of Ale Measure, 9
Barrels, 3 Firkins, and 3 Gallons.

Here Note, That formerly the Ale Gallon was accounted to contain 288 Cube
Inches; but by the care and pains of my good Friend, Mr. Nicholas Gunton, the
just quantity of the Quart, remaining in the hands of the Chamberlains of His
Majesty's Exchequer, appears to be 70, as some of late have found to their no
small cost. And I am of opinion, that if the Wine Gallon were carefully
examined, it would prove to contain less than it is commonly holden to do, by
so much as would improve the Revenue of the Crown some thousands per annum.

Now having showed thee how to find the superficial Quantity of any Figure
enclosed or bounded by Right Lines, if the Dimensions be alike above and below,
multiply the Area by the Depth and you have the Content of the whole; or by any
part, and you will find thereby the Solidity of that part.

But if the Dimensions above and below be unequal, take your Dimensions or
cross Diameters at every Foot or half Foot, and so find the Solidity.

Of a Circle.
A Circle is a Figure contained or bounded by one Line, which is called the
Circumference, as the Line abgd.



Within which Line there is a Point, from whence all Lines drawn from the
Circumference are equal: And that Point is called the Center, as the Point c:
And through which all Right Lines drawn from one side of the Circumference to
the other divide the Circle into two equal parts, and that Line is called the
Diameter, as the Line a c b; and the two parts of the Circle, divided by the
Diameter, are called Semi^circles, as the part a c b g or a c b d.

And although there is not yet found any true proportion between a Square and a
Circle, (a Square Inch being our Common Measure) yet is there an Approximation
found by Vanculen, which comes almost infinitely near the truth, being as Unity
to 3.14159 etc. to the Square of the Semi-diameter. But the old Proportion
comes near enough for common practice, viz. As 14 to 11, so is the Square of
the Diameter to the Area in Square Inches, etc.

Example.

^

Which Area in Square Inches divided by 282 quote the Ale Gallons contained in
one Inch of depth in that Circle, or by 231 the Wine Gallons.

Example.

^

But I would advise my young Gauger not to trouble himself with the Inches, his
business being to find the Gallons the shortest way he can: In order whereunto,
let him observe the following Rule.

Having the Diameter of a Circle in Inches, to find the Area or Content in Ale
or Wine Gallons.
The Rule.
Square the Diameter ( viz. multiply it by it self) and that Square or Product
divide by 359 for Ale, and 294 for Wine, and the Quotes will be the Ale or Wine
Gallons respectively, that shall be contained in a Circle of that Diameter, and
one Inch in depth.

^

^

If the Tun be in form of a Cylinder, viz. like the Rolling-stone of a Garden,
the Circles above and below of equal Diameters, then to find the Content of
that Tun, or any part thereof, you need only find the Area of the Circle, and
multiply by the whole Depth, or such part as you desire, and the Product will
be the Solidity of the whole, or part, respectively.



Diameter ab or cd = 80 Inches, the Area before found to be 17 gallons 6 pints,
and the Depth = 40 Inches: To find the Content.

^

The Content of this Tun in Beer Measure.

But if your round Tun have unequal Dimensions above and below, it is then
taken to be the part of a Cone or round Pyramid, having the top cut off as the
following Diagram; the whole Cone = abcdefg, the part or Frustum = abcdeg.



Having the two Diameters and Depth of the Tun, to produce the whole Cone the
Rule is by Proportion thus:

As the Semidifference of Diameters is to half the Diameter at the Base: So is
the height of the Frustum to the Cones whole Axis.

Admit ab 80, cd 140, eg 50, then is the Difference 60, half the Base 70.

Example.

^

Having all these Dimensions, the Content of the Tun is not hard to be found.

For if you find the Area of the Base, and multiply that Area by of the
Altitude, or of the Area by the whole Altitude, the Product is the Solidity of
the whole Cone. Then having found the whole Cone, find also the lesser Cone,
and subduct that from the greater, the Remainder will be the Content of the
Frustum.

Or if you would find the Content of the Frustum, without producing the whole
Cone,

The Rule is:
Multiply the Sum of the two Diameters by it self, then multiply the two
Diameters by each other, subduct the lesser Product from the greater, and the
Remainder multiply by the depth, the last Product divide by 1077, and the Quote
is the Ale Gallons contained in that Tun.

^

^

The Content appears to be 1727 Ale Gallons, or 47 Barrels, 3 Firkins, 8
Gallons.

If it be desired in Feet or Inches, you may find all the Differences of the
Diameters, at every Foot, half Foot, or Inch, by this Proportion:

As the whole Depth, is to the Difference of Diameters: So is any part of the
Depth, to its respective difference of Diameter.

Then by Addition or Subduction, you have the Diameters all the way upward or
downward.

Or, if you please, you may take the Diameters actually, in the midst of every
Foot or half Foot, and seek its Area in the Table of Area's hereto annexed,
which Area multiplied by the Foot or half Foot gives the Solidity accordingly,
without any sensible error. This way I would oblige the young Gauger to, if he
be not ready at Proportion.

Example.

^

All these Mean Diameters cut this Tun into so many Cylinders.

^

Now having the Area of each Circle, which is an Arithmetical Mean of the half
Foot, multiply this Area by 6, and the Product is the Solidity of that half
Foot.

^

This Tun cast up by the Rule, page 19.

^ ^

Whereby appears not a Gallon difference.

If the Conjugate or Cross Diameters above and below are not equal, then do
Geometricians call that Tun Eliptical; to reduce which to a Circle, there ought
to be a Geometrical Mean taken, but the common practice is to add them
together, and take the half, which if the Diameters differ not much, the error
is the less.

Coppers are commonly taken at every 6 Inches, as that Tun in page 21.

To find the Content of a Coppers Crown, take this Rule:

Square the Diameter at the Base, to this add 4/3 of the Square of the Crowns
Altitude, the Sum multiply by the Altitude, the last Product divide by 718, the
Quote is the Ale Gallons contained in that Crown.

To find the Content of the Mash Tun, in Quarters, Bushels, and Gallons, there
can be no certain Rule in taking the Depth of the Goods, by reason of the
difference in the goodness of Malt, some spending it self much more in the
wetting than other; yet that considered, there may be some estimate given
thereto, whereby a very considerable fraud may be discovered.

In a square Mash Tun, divide the Product of the Length and Breadth by 227 for
indifferent, or by 200 for the finest, and the Product will be the Gallons
wetted; and for round Mash Tuns, let your Divisors be 288 or 260, respectively.

For Cask-Gauging, wholly full, I have given many Precepts and Examples in a
Treatise called The Merchants Companion, Printed about a year since; but that
the Reader may not be left here wholly without, take the following Rule, which
considers the Cask as the Frustum of a Spheroid, that being the most general
form.

To find the Content of a Cask in Ale or Wine Gallons.
The Rule.
To the doubled Square of the Boung Diameter add the Square of the Head
Diameter, and that Sum multiply by the Casks Length, the last Product divide by
1077, and the Quote is the Ale Gallons, or by 882 quotes the Wine Gallons
contained in that Cask.

Example.

^ ^ The Content of this Cask is 73 Ale Gallons, 2 Pints, and almost an half.

Or, by the Table of Area's, thus:

To twice the Area of the Boung Circle in Gallons and parts add the Area of the
Head Circle, the Sum of these multiply tby of the Casks Length, and the Product
is the Content in Gallons and parts, as in the former Example.

^

Which Fraction being reduced is 2 Pints and better, as was before found.

Divide the Square of the Diameter by 359, and the Quote exhibits the Area of
that Circle in Ale Gallons.

Thus may be made any Number, greater or lesser than the Table does exhibit,
the difference here being not 1/1000 part of a Gallon.

To make a Table of ds of Area's of Ci^cles in Wine Gallons,

The Rule is:
Multiply of the Square of the Diameter by.0034, or multiply the whole Square
by.0034 and the Product divide by 3; and the Product of the former Work, or the
Quotient of the latter, is the Circles Area.

To Gauge a Cask by the precedent Table,

The Rule is:
To the Double of the Boung Diameter add the Head Diameter, their Sum multiply
by the Length, and the Product is the Content.

Example.

A Casks Boung Diameter 29.5 Inches, Head Diameter 23, and the Length 48
Inches, I demand its Content in Wine Gallons?

The Use of the precedent Table.
Having taken the Diameter of the Vessel, and also the Depth of the Liquor,
seek the Diameter in the first Column of the Table, and casting your Eye
upwards, you find over all the other Columns (except that for 1 Inch of Depth,
over which stands the Title Area) one of the Digits, amongst which you shall
find your Depth of Liquor, if it exceed not 8 Inches; then under that Figure,
and against your Diameter you shall find your number of Gallons and parts.

Example.

To find the Content of a Cylinder, whose Diameter is 38, and Depth 4 Inches.

I first seek the Diam. 38, and against it in the Column under 4 I find 16.08,
which is 16 Gallons and 8/100 parts.

^To reduce which Fraction into Pints, multiply it by 8, and cut off two places
in the Product, the figures to the left hand are Pints, and those cut off parts
of a Pint, as in the Margin.

present intention is to apply it to Cask-Gauging, viz. To find the vacant
Frustums in a Cask partly full, lying with its Axis parallel to the Horizon,
the Cask being taken as the Frustum of a Spheroid cut with two Planes parallel,
bisecting the Axis at Right Angles.

And here it is requisite, the Boung and Head Diameters, Casks Length, the

by the Boung Diameter, and the Quote seek in the Table, under V or Versed Sine,
against it stands a number, which multiplied by the Content exhibits the
Vacuity, if your Dividend were the dry, or the remaining Liquor, if it were the

FINIS.
A SHORT SYNOPSIS OR INDEX OF THE LAWS OF EXCISE.

LONDON: Printed by William Godbid, 1676.

The Use of the precedent Table is very considerable in Geometry, but my
present intention is to apply it to Cask-Gauging, viz. To find the vacant
Frustums in a Cask partly full, lying with its Axis parallel to the Horizon,
the Cask being taken as the Frustum of a Spheroid cut with two Planes parallel,
bisecting the Axis at Right Angles.

And here it is requisite, the Boung and Head Diameters, Casks Length, the
whole Content, and dry or wet Inches be known. Then, if the Question be what is
wanting, or what is remaining in the Cask? divide either the dry or wet Inches
by the Boung Diameter, and the Quote seek in the Table, under V or Versed Sine,
against it stands a number, which multiplied by the Content exhibits the
Vacuity, if your Dividend were the dry, or the remaining Liquor, if it were the
wet Inches.

Some Examples of the Use of this Table of Area's of Segments, in finding the
Vacuity of Cask.

QUEST. I.
What is the Vllage of a Cask, whose Boung Diameter is 28 Inches, Content 60
Gallons, and dry Inches 7?

According to the precedent Rule, I divide 7 by 28, which I do by adding two
Ciphers, thus: ^

Then seeking 25 in the Table in the Column under V, in the next Column against
it I find.1955, which number I multiply by the whole Content, and cutting off
four places toward the right hand of the Product, it exhibits the Ullage or
Wants in that Cask in Gallons and parts.

Example.

^

So is the Ullage or Wants 11 Gallons and almost of a Gallon.

QUEST. II.
What quantity of Liquor is there remaining in this Cask?

Divide the wet Inches by the Boung-Diameter, after this manner: ^

Against which number (75) I find in the Table.8045, which I multiply by the
whole Content as before, and the Product gives the quantity of remaining Liquor.

Example.

^

Now if after Division there happen a Remainer, and that be above half the
Divisor, I take the next bigger number; or if it be less than half the Divisor,
I take the next lesser number, as in the following Examples.

QUEST. III.
If in the forementioned Cask there be 9 Inches of the Boung Diameter dry,
what is the Wants?

^

Here the Remainer being under half the Divisor I take 32, ^

QUEST. IV.
There being 19 wet Inches, what is the remaining Gallons?

^

Here the Remainer being above half the Divisor, I take the next bigger number,
viz. 68, ^

THE DESCRIPTION AND USE Of the GAUGING-RULE.

THE DESCRIPTION and USE OF THE GAUGING-RULE.
THis Rule is commonly four Foot in length, and is made to double in four
joints, for convenient portage: It has also four Sides, on which are drawn
several Lines, viz.

1. There is two Lines called Diagonals, the one for Wine, the other for Beer
or Ale-measure. These are so commonly known, that I suppose there are few
Officers but are well acquainted with them; however, lest any should be
ignorant, take this following advice.

Put the end which is cut slope-ways in at the Boung-hole, and let i^ touch the
bottom of the Head, the Number that appears at the Boung is the Number of Ale
or Wine Gallons respectively.

As for Example.

a Cask.


Put your Rule down at the Boung-hole e to the bottom of the Head c, if 60
appear at the Boung on the Diagonal for Wine, then is the Content 60 Wine
Gallons, and almost 49 Ale Gallons, for the Sub-divisions between the Numbers
from 10 upwards signify each one Gallon.

This way will give a very good estimate of the Content of all Cask, in ^he
form of the London Beer Barrel, or the French wine Hogshead. These Lines being
together serve also very well for a Table of Reduction of Wine into Ale
measure, and the Converse, by inspection only.

2. On another Side or Face there is put a Line of Inches, from 1 to 48 Inches,
and each decimally divided; and also upon the same Side you have Oughtred's
Gauge-Line, it being a Line of One thirds of Area's of Circles, in Wine
Gallons, by which you may Gauge a Cask after this manner: Put your Rule down at
the Boung perpendicularly, observing what Number appears j^^t even with the
inside of the Cask, admit it be 7, set that down twice, then take the Diameter
at the Head, and let that show you 6 upon the same Line, set that down to the
former, add these three Numbers together, and multiply the Sum by the Casks
Length, here 30, then cut off one place from the Product toward the right hand,
and the Figures toward the left hand are your Number of Wine Gallons contained
in the Cask.

Example.

^

Note, If your Diameter fall amongst the Divisions, between the Numbers, you
must cut off two places from the Product.

Example.

^

Content as before 60.00 Wine Gall.

3. On a third Face of this Rule (which meets the precedent Line of One thirds
of Area's upon one Angle or Edge of the Rule) is put a Line of equal parts,
numbered from 1 to 96, and is divided into halves: This Line considered together
with that before mentioned, do make a Table of Area's of Circles in Ale
Gallons, so that if you find your Diameter in this Line, turn up the other
Face, and against your Diameter you shall have the Area of your Circle in Ale
measure.

As for Example:

The Diameter of a Circle is 19 Inches, the Area of that Circle upon the other
Edge in Oughtrea's Line is a little above one Gallon.

Again, the Diameter being 30 Inches, the Area is 2.5 Gallons; and if the
Diameter be 67 Inches, it holds 12.5 Gallons upon one Inch of depth.

The Use of these Lines, thus together, is the same with that of the Table of
Area's page 29, etc.

4. On the fourth Side of this Rule is drawn a Line of Numbers, vulgarly called
Gunters's Line, which Line with a pair of Compasses is of excellent use upon
sundry occasions, it being a Line of Logari^hms, and by it is performed
Multiplic^^ion, Division, Extraction of the Square and Cube Roots, and many
other Calculations Arithmetical: Of this Line alone, are two or three Books of
like magnitude with this already printed, to which for those things I r^fer
you, and shall here only apply it to Cask-Gauging; of which take the following
Instructions: First learn to find any Number upon the Line; from 1 to 10 you
have the Figures Arithmetically placed, and the subdivisions are tenths; but
from 10 to 20 the divisions signify each an additional Unite, and so to 100.
At 17.2 you have a small brass Pin, whereon to set the Foot of your Compasses,
and is called the Gauge-point for Wine Gallons, almost at 19 is the Gauge-point
for Ale Gallons, the first has w g, and the other a g placed over it, by which
they are easily known. To Gauge a Cask by this Line, you must first find the
Diameter at the Head and Boung, and also the Casks Length, by the Line of
Inches: These being had, find your mean Diameter, by adding double the Boung
Diameter to once the Diameter at the Head, and divide their Sum by 3, the Quote
take for your Mean: Then with your Compasses set one Foot in the Gauge-point,
and extend the other to the mean Diameter upon your Line of Numbers, so keeping
your points at that distance, set one Foot at the number expressing the Casks
Length, and from thence double the distance of the Feet of the Compasses
exhibits the Content in Ale or Wine Gallons respectively.


As for Example:

A Cask, Boung Diameter 27, Head 24, Length 30 Inches, if the Content be
required in Ale or Wine Gallons, I find the mean Diameter according to the Rule
thus: ^

The mean Diameter being 26, I take my Rule and Compasses, if the Question be
Ale Gallons, and set one Foot in the Gauge-point for Ale, and the other I
extend to 26, then I take off the Compasses so extended, and setting one Foot
at 30, the Length, giving the Compasses one turn upon the other Foot, whereby
to take the double distance, and the point touches at 57, which is the Content
of that Cask in Ale Gallons.

If the Question be Wine Gallons, I take the distance from the Gauge-point for
Wine to 26, the mean Diameter, and the Compasses applied to the Casks Length,
and turned as before, exhibits 69, the Content of the Cask in Wine Gallons.

This is a very quick and easy way of Gauging Cask, and is also an
approximation near enough the truth for common practice.

Having the mean Diameter of any Conical Tun, and the Depth of Liquor, the
Quantity is found after the same manner.

Example.

The mean Diameter of a Tun 28, Depth of Liquor 29, Quantity of Ale Gallons
will be found 63.

The common way of finding the mean Diameter of a Conical Tun, is by adding the
Diameters above and below together, and take the half. This I allow, as an
easy and practical way for young Gaugers; but note, that the greater the
difference of the Diameters are, the greater is your error, but in Diameters
that differ not much, it does very well.

There is also another Line, that runs parallel with this Line of Numbers, and
is called a Line of Segments, but I like not the Hypothesis upon which it is
framed, and the way of finding the Wants of a Cask (lying with its Axis
parallel to the Horizon, being partly empty of Liquor) made so plain and easy,
by the precedent Exampl^s upon the Table of Area's of Segments, I had thought
to have left it out, but lest any having a Rule and not Table by him, should
have such occasion, let him take one

Example.

A Casks Boung 24 Inches, wet 18 Inches, Content 50 Ale Gallons, what is the
Ullage or Wants in this Cask?

As 24 on the Line of Numbers, is to Radius on the Segments: So is 6 on the
Numbers, to 17.8 on the Segments.

Then, As Unity, to 50 on the Numbers: So 17.8 on the Numbers, to 8.9 Ale
Gallons, the Wants required.

FINIS.
