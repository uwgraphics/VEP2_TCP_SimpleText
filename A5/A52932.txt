Note, That in Two Years last past there are more Ships sent out than in Seven
Years before.

An Account of several sorts of Woollen Cloths Exported to India from the Port
of London, in Two Years last past, as appears by His Majesty's Books kept in
the Searchers-Office. From the 31 December 1697, to the 31 December 1699.

The Cargoes of the 26 Ships comes to One Million one hundred fourteen thousand
nine hundred and thirty three Pounds, -- 1,114,933 The Cargoes carried out by
Captains super Cargoes, and Ships Company in Private Trade, is above a Tenth
part as much as the whole: But suppose they were no more than a Tenth, they
come to -- 111,993 Total Cargoes of 26 Ships amounts to -- 1,226,426 Note, If
26 Ships carries out One Millon two hundred twenty six thousand four hundred
and twenty six Pounds, then 52 Ships must carry out Two Millions four hundred
fifty two thousand eight hundred fifty two Pounds, by the Rule of
ProProportion, -- 2,452,852
Of this not one Fortieth part consists of our Woollen Cloth, as appears by the
Custom-House Account; and what Cloth they send does more Prejudice to the
Turkey Trade, than Service to the Kingdom, as by a Memorial lately delivered to
the King and Council of Trade, by the Turkey Merchant, does evidently appear.

Note, That according to the usual account of Sales by the Candle, the Goods
amount to Treble the first Cost; if so, the whole Cargoes brought in will come
to Sever Millions three hundred eighty eight thousand five hundred fifty six
Pounds 7,388556 These sold by the Wholesale Buyer to the Retailers, allowing 10
per Cent. Profit to such Wholesale Buyer, comes to -- 738855 Total Value in the
Retailers Hands -- 8,127411
Of this, by the best Information we can at present get upon the strictest
Inquiry, find, That of this prodigious Cargoe, there will not be above One
fourth part restrained by the intended Prohibition, which will in a great
measure be made good again by the much greater vend of Raw Silk, and other
Materials, and by greater quantities of White Callicoes which will be Dyed,
Printed, and Stained here.

Note, That in case a stop be put to but One fourth part, it will hinder the
consumption of above Two Millions of Manufactures; to supply which, 'twill give
an Employment to great numbers of Manufacturers in many places where the Silk
and Worsted Trades are settled, and be a means to keep up the Prices of Wool
and Provisions, which else must in a short time sink very low.

Query, Whether it may not be thought reasonable that the East India Companies,
and other Traders, give an Account what Money and Bullion they have taken in at
Cairz. and other Foreign Parts, and carried to the Indies in two years last
past?

Query, Whether it be not as reasonable t o send our Money to the East
Countries to buy up Corn, (which is there very cheap) to seed us, as it is to
send it to the East Indies for Garments to cloth us.

Query, Whether it be not as necessary to restrain the Trade to the
East Indies, as 'twas to put a stop to the Irish, since the same and greater
Reason is given for the doing thereof?

Query, Whether the East India Traders (it not restrained) may not in a short
time bring over vast quantities of Stuffs for Men's wear, since they have dately
imported fine Cotton Druggers very fit for that purpose?

Query, Whether the sending above Two Millions to employ the Indians to make
our wearing Apparel, while our own Poor starve for want of Employment, be not a
Consideration of great wright, and deserve some speedy Remedy.

Query, Whether the Linen Drapers cannot as well turn their hands now to the
Selling of such Manufactures as may be profitable to the (...), as they fi^erly
turned them the other way by ^ing Mastic instead of Cambrick and Lew^s, and
from Green Says to ^ces.

POSTSCRIPT, 26 January, 1699.
THree Days ago we received Advice, That the Rising Eagle, a Ship of 240 Tonns,
in Private Trade, is arrived from China, having Completed her whole Voyage in
less than Twenty three Months, and carried out about Twenty thousand Pounds in
Bulleigne, and have brought above Eleven thousand Pieces of Wrought Silks, (and
not One Pound of Raw Silk,) valued about Forty thousand Pounds; which has put a
great Damp upon the few Silk Weavers that are left, and will, no doubt, cause
many to be turned out of Work.

There Is likewise Advice in Yesterday's London Gazette, That a Ship belonging
to the French East India Company is lately arrived at Diepe, from Surrat: It Is
said her Cargo is worth near Two hundred thousand Crowns, and that a great part
of it consists in Gold and Silver, which she brought from the Island of
Bourbon, to which Place she carried a new Governor, and a Recruit of Five
hundred Men.

Note the Difference between the Two Ships Cargo's: Ours brings over Wrought
Silks, to the Destruction of our own Manufactures, and the French brings Gold
and Silver, to Support their Government and Trade.

February 3. There is Advice, That the Thomas and the Mary are Arrived from
Bombay; and by their Cargoes in Print, there is above 93000 Pieces of
Manufactured Silks, Stuffs, and Calico's, (besides what came in Private Trade)
and not One Pound of Raw Silk to Employ the English Manufacturers.

February ^0. This Day there is Advice, That the Thorndon, a Ship of 500 Tonns,
from the Bay of Bengal, is Arrived; but her Cargo is not yet in Print. It Is
said she brings great Quantities of Wrought Goods, and ^ Raw Silk.
