The Epilogue in the Island Princess Set by Mr. Clarke Sung by Mrs* Lindsey and
the Boy, and exactly engraved by Tho Cross.
^Now to you ye dry Wovers old Beaus and no doers so Doughty so Gouty so
Useless and Toothless your ^ ^Blindness cold kindness has nothing of Man still
Doting or Glouting still Stumbling or Fumbling still ^ ^Hawking still Baulking
you flash in the Pan unfit like old Brooms for sweeping our Rooms your ^ ^sunk
and your shrunk then repent or look to it in vain your so upish in vain your
so upish your down every foot. ^

For the Flute.
