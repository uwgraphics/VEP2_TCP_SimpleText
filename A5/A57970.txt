CHRISTIAN READER.
I Intended at first, to have given thee, the trouble of a larger Preface to
these Epistles; but I perceived upon second thoughts, that as thou should be
at a loss in being thereby kept up too long a^ the entry, so I should gain but
little by following my first look; and therefore I have on purpose foreborn
what I intended: Wherein as I have pleased my self no worse; so I am sure I
have pleased thee much better, then if I had followed forth a design, whereby
thou could have reaped so little advantage: And therefore leaving and laying
it aside, I shall confine my self to what does more peculiarly relat to this
great, little book.

In the entry give me leave to tell thee, that as there are many of the Authors
Papers, both polemick and practical, which he intended for public use and
advantage, that will never see the light; because (being like Appelles picture
which was either to be perfected by his own pencil or wholly laid aside) he
carried his pen away with himself, leaving few in the generation that would
undertake to follow his notion and finish it, or if they should essay it, it
would be in the issue; humano capit^ cervicem jungere equinam: upon which
account the Church of God may lament the loss of such a Master in Israel: as
the world (I say) is, at no small loss, by being robbed of so rich a treasure,
which was intended for them; so, these few, which the Author did not at all
intend for public use, are here sent abroad: he did violence to the desires of
many in refusing to publish them (howbeit he was known to consult the
satisfaction and advantage of the truly godly, more then his own contentment
or ease) not because he thought them unworthy of a scholar, as not being
stuffed with a great many sterril notions: If any allege this, it is non Causa
pro Causa; but the true reason why he endeavored to suppress and conceal them
from the world, was, lest any man should think of him above what was meet;
because (if not of the abundance of revelation, which yet God did indeed give
his suffering servant, as will be clear by comparing what he foresaw, both as
to the work in general, and as to some particular persons, with the event;
yet) of the abundance of soul-refreshing manifestations that he had: This was
the true reason which made him inexorable and kept him from listening to the
most pressing and assiduous entreaties of his friends: he had many things which
commended him to the people of God; but his covering his great seize as a
Christian, and the pregnancie of his parts as a scholar, with the vail of
humility (which is the chief ornament of a gracious spirit) as it did render
him peculiarly and deservedly dear to them; so it made both the one and the
other shine more brightly, and did besides their native and intrinseck beauty,
give an adventitious brightness and luster to all that great stock of grace,
and store of Parts, which were found (rara avis interris) jointly in him. It
was manifest to all who were but a little acquaint with him, that his modesty
and humility was such, that in all his most eminent appearances for God, he
studied to disappear, lest he should by standing up, be guilty of intercepting
any part of that glory, which belongs to him alone; of whom are all things, and
for whom are all things: neither was he at any loss hereby; for thus he became
great in the Kingdom of God: his growing downward, in that high and
Gospel-adorning grace of humility, made him grow upward in favor with God and
all Good men; and thus by denying himself, and seeking God alone; he both found
what he sought, and got what he was not willing to take, nor would own as his
due.

But, besides this true account I have given, why the world was deprived of so
useful and edifying a piece to this day; I think it should not pass without a
remarke, that God in his good providence, has reserved the publication
thereof, for such a time as this, wherein it seems to promise a singular
advantage, beyond and above, what was probably attainable at any other season:
First as to the suffering people of God, who while they are deprived of these
things in public, for the most part, which comforted them over all their
sorrows, and while the songs of the Sanctuary (because the Philistims have
stopped most of these wells out of which they used to draw and drink with joy,
that, which was sweter to the taste, then honey to the mouth; or they have
thrown that into them, which has not only made them lose their former relish
and sweetness; but has rendered them so bitter, that they are now become gall
and wormwood) are turned into howling and bitter lamentation; while it is thus
I say, with the people of God, that in stead of being made glad in his house of
prayer as formerly, they are sighing for the ceasing of these solemn
assemblies: they may in their sad hours commune with this sufferer, who not
being willing to eat his morsel his alone, speaks to them good words and
comfortable: he tells you, beloved sufferers, what a heaven is to be had in
Christ's company, even when ye are put to bear the cross, and to have shame and
suffering for his sake, as your inseparable companion: Neither is his discourse
upon this subject, an empty or idle speculation; nay, he speaks what he
knows: the God for whose Cause he suffered, comforted him in the like
tribulation, and so he is in case to comfort you, by the comforts, wherewith he
himself was comforted of God. Next, as to these of the Ministers of the Gospel,
who by the violence of their Adversaries are driven from their flocks [which to
a godly Minister is the greatest of afflictions] such I say, may see for
strengthening of their hands, while they are put to contend with these that are
too strong for them; how this noble witness, who suffered for the same cause,
carried, how he acquit himself, and overcame: the Archers shot sore at him, but
his bow abod in it is strength^ The arms of his hands were made so strong, by
the hand of the mighty God of Jacob, that he was too hard for all that entered
the lists with him, and when they thought they had done sufficient, either to
force him to a compliance, or to make him faint under the effects of their
fury, by depriving him of his ministry, which was dearer to him then his life;
he was not by all this, so much put to suffering (to speak properly) as he was
for a season, a little removed from the noise and distraction that is abroad in
the world, to be alone with God. O blessed solitude! O sweet society!) he was
taken out of the clamor and confusion that is here below, up to the mount,
where he was admitted to a near familiarity, and experienced the sweetness of
that fellowship with God, which he had preached unto others: Though he was not
taken from the earth; yet he was not only kept from the evil that was then,
and is now, in the world; but he enjoyed such a heaven under his heavy
pressurs, that if the being about of his Master's business, had not been prized
by him, as preferable to his own consolation, he would have been in hazard of
forgetting the troubles of Zion, and of saying, it is good for me to be here;
but he was such a servant, as made is his meat and drink to do his Masters
will, he had so learned Christ, as to prefer his concernments to his Chief joy:
and therefore, ye will find him often in these Epistles, feasting upon the
consolations of God, with the tear in his eye, while he remembers Zion, and
calls to mind the desolat condition of the flocks of Christ [particularly his
own] for whom nothing was prepared. He found in his solitude such a measure of
presence, as could hardly have been expected, out of the chamber of presence,
where there is fullness of joy and pleasures for evermore: he know more in this
happy retirement, of the exercise of them who are above (who being made Kings
unto God, have crowns upon their head, and being made priests also, sacrifice
these to the giver) then he could have learned, by revolving all the volumes
that are written in many ages, amidst the greatest outward calm and
tranquillity: This is the summer fruit which grew out of the hard tree of the
cross of Christ that he was put to bear, which was so sweet to his taste, that
it made him disdain the dainties of his Adversaries, and disrelish these sour
and unsavory delights of the sons of men, which however they may at first seem
to have some petty sweet in them; yet they quickly set the teeth of the eater
on edge, and are found bitter in the belly and of a bad digestion: These were
the quiet fruits of ighteousness that his servant reaped by hi sufferings for
Christ, and that in such plenty, that out of his abundance, he sends some
baskets of these sweet fruits abroad amongst his friends, both to bring up a
good report upon his liberal Lord and Master, who allows on his followers,
while they are pinched with penury of other comforts, full measure, heaped up,
running over, and shaken together: And upon the cross of Christ also, to the
end it might appear, that this burden is so far from imbittering the life of a
suffering saint, that by the contrary, as the sufferings of Christ abound in
him, so his consolation also abounds by Jesus Christ. The publication then, I
say, of these Epistles, seems in providence to be trysted on purpose, with the
sufferings of his servants at this time, that we may be encouraged by his
example, to a Zealous faithfulness, and a cheerful suffering, and may wax
bold by his bonds, under, and in which, he did experience, much of the glorious
liberty of the sons of God: How often do we find him preferring his
confinement, to all the sublunary contentments of his persecurers? here did he
feed upon these pure and unmixed delights, which put such gladness in the
heart, as expells all the Latent and lurking griefs that are there, and causes
the soul, while surrounded with all outward trouble to sing; while they feed
upon ashes, and fill their belly with the east wind, who feast upon the tears
of the people of God, and seem to have nothing else to interrupt their
tranquillity, but how they may trouble the children of peace: It was under this
restraint, and in this house of his bondage, when being shut up from, and
spoiled of all creatur-comforts, that he found the surpassing sweetness of the
consolations of God, which taste best, when they are most free of the mud, and
mixture of other enjoyments: there it was where he found the truth of that
saying of Augustine, Tanta est dulcedo caelestis gaudii, ut si una guttula
difflueret in infernum; totam amaritudinem infer^i absorberet: If one drop of
heavenly joy should fall into hell, it would swallow up, or sweeten, all the
bitterness of that place of torment: The love of God and the joy of the Holy
Ghost, was so abundantly shed abroad in his heart, while he was in the furnace,
that his cross was not only made there by light and easy, and his life
pleasant; but ye have him often saying (because he found by these foretasts
what inconceivable consolation must be, in the immediate vision and full
fruition of God) that if there were no other way, to come at the possession of
that blessedness, he would, not only choose to swime through a sea of outward
troubles; but he would wade through the lake of fire and brimstone, to be
possessed of God himself: and there is none, who knew the gracious sobriety of
this holy man, that will judge he complemented in saying so: nay, there are
none, who have found what a cool refreshing shade and abundant consolation the
soul finds, in the company of the son of man, while they walk with him amdist
the flames of the most scorching fiery trials; but they would think strange, if
he spoke otherwise. Let us then be ashamed, to scare at the cross, or at
Christ's company, because of it; since it bears the man, who bears it: Let us
resolve to take joyfully the ^os of all things, life it self not being
excepted, in the service of such a Master, who maks us gainers by our loses,
and then in a special way maks up all our wants, according to his riches in
glory, when we have forsaken all to follow him: Let us study to carry in the
sight of Adversaries, as men who cannot be made miserable by affliction; for if
we be but indeed faithful to him, we are more happy at our worst, then we
know; or rather we are only in so far miserable, as we know not how happy we
are: he who is admitted to know that he has a place in the heart of God, needs
but care little what he meet with from the hand of man: this may wipe all
tears from his eyes, even while he sighs out that sad word, I am poor and
needy, that he knows, and is in case to add that other, yet the Lord
thinks upon me, and does earnestly remember me still: And by the way (though
it is neither far out of my way nor thine, nor eccentrick to my present purpose)
let me say, that if the question were moved, how it comes to pass, that he
found so much, and other worthy sufferers also before him, that these things
seem almost dreams, and incredible to us? truly (without speaking any thing of
the absolut sovereignty of God, who may do with his own what he will, and
dispense as he pleases, both as to measure and time) the reason may seem to be
very obvious: his, and their witnessbearing for Jesus Christ, did every way,
and in all respects, exceed our's: They gave to God as Kings [though it was of
his own they served him] their Testimonies, against the corruptions of their
times, whither in King, or Parliament, or Churchmen, had so much of
ministerial faithfulness, so much of freedom, so much of grave and
Gospel-becoming boldness in them, so much holy zeal, even for the least of
these concernments of the Kingdom of Christ [upon which we are loath to state
our sufferings, or for the keeping whereof, we are unwilling to hazard the loss
of any thing] that it was apparent, they loved him so well, that they loved not
their lives unto the death, and that Christ could require nothing of them, as a
signification of their zeal for his interests, which they were not at a point
to part with, and were not ready to give away: And he upon the other hand, to
make it appear, that they could not serve the Lord for nothing, and to evidence
his special complacency in such a zealous frame of spirit, did, not only
extraordinarily support them under their trouble, so that they did not sink,
even when they seemed to others, to be pressed out of measure, and beyond
strength; but did manifest himself in a most familiar manner unto them, so that
when they were almost at this, that they had not whereupon to lay their head,
they had then free access, to lean it and lay it on his bosom: in a word, God
did declare, that he thought nothing too great, nor too good for them, who gave
themselves away so entirely to him: so that if the question were asked at God,
whence is it, that there is so vaste a difference, betwixt his dealing with his
former witnesses, and these who now give some kind of testimony to his name?
He could quickly silence and put to shame the movers of that question, by
sending us back, to see what a difference there is, betwixt what these worthies
did and suffered for him, and what we have done; though under more obligations,
at least subjective, under more oaths, Covenants, engagements, protestations,
and these often reiterat, then many of them were: He met them, as men whose
hearts were listed up in the ways of the Lord, as men who rejoiced and wrought
righteousness, and could neither be flattered nor frowned out of their
fidelity and freedom; and he hids himself from us, as it were ashamed of such
witnesses, whose very testimony, is so unworthy of such a Master, and so far
short of what it ought to be, as if indeed we were ashamed of him and his
truth, or thought the torn and the lame, a sufficient sacrifice for him. It
was not the maine question of these men, in a suffering time, how much they
might let go, and yet keep the substantialls of religion, or how long they
should be silent, out of fear, lest while they endeavored to acquit themselves
faithfully, they should both be reput rash and imp^udent, and provoke the
Magistrate, by venting their needless jealousies, to do what he intended not:
They did not think it enough to give some oblique intimation of their dislike,
or half signification of their detestation of these courses, whereby they
conceived their Master's interests wronged, his prerogative incroched upon, and
the whole endangered: Nay, nay, these men of God who knew the times and what
Israel had to do, thought such a carriage unworthy of the Ambassadors of
Christ, who are set for the defense of the Gospel, and upon the matter but as a
couching of Asses under the burden: they would sooner have parted with their
lives, then with one hoof of what belonged to their Master: They thought it
more worthy of a watchman, to put all on their guard, upon the Least appearance
of the approach of an enemy, then suffer themselves to be shamefully surprised
in their security: And they thought it more like the good soldiers of Jesus
Christ, to cover the ground where they stood with their dead bodies; then, as
afraid or terrified by their adversaries in any thing, to make a dishonorable
retreat: He who would have put them from witnessing a good confession, when the
danger of the work of God, called them to cry aloud and not to spare; behov^d,
not only to have threatened them (for that would not have done the business,
they being men of such metal, as could have looked death out of countenance
in it is most formidable shape, and carried in the face of all opposition, as
these whom no affliction could make miserable) but to silence them perfectly,
he behoved to have sent them into the other world; whith could not be terrible
to them, who had the certain expectation, that if so dismissed, they should
take up their place amongst the soul under the Altar, slain for the word of
God, and their testimony that they held: And I may say particularly, to the
commendation of the grace of God, in this his faithful servant (who having
served his generation according to the will of God, is now fallen asleep) that
to the observation of all, he never was afraid of the face of man, in appearing
for the interests of Christ; neither knew he what it was to be silent, when he
saw these in hazard; nay, he was such a son of Levi, as knew neither friend nor
brother in the matters of God: Which blessed disposition did accompany him to
his grave; for though such was the indulgence of his Master to so faithful a
servant, that he would have him to die in peace (though he denied him not the
honor of a martyr, dying under a sentence of confinement to his own house]
plucking him out of the jaws of a bloody death, wherewith he was threatened, and
which was intended for him, by them whose indignation had almost come to that
hight, as to say upon the matter, bring him hither upon the bed that we may
kill ^im: for not being satisfied with the testimony of the Physicans, nor the
Magistrates, nor the Ministers of the place, certifying, that he was not able to
travel to Edinburgh [as by the s^quel was too sadly confirmed] he was confined
in his own house, when he was not able to go a broad, and put to shame in that
place, where he had deservedly gained the reput of one of the most learned and
succesfully laborious Doctors, that ever had filled that chair, and of one of
the most faithful and diligent Minister that ever watched over, or labored
amongst a people. Ah Scotland, Scotland whither have thou caused thy shame to
go? If it had been an enemy who had sought to deal thus with thy Secrs and
faithful Prophets, it had become thee better, to have hide these by fifties in
caves, from the fury of their enemi^s, or if thou could not have preserved
the lives of such worthies; either to have died with them, or to have made it
appear, thou only lived, to lament the loss of a greater treasure, then if
thou had lost all the gold of Indie and Ophir; but for thy own sword to
devour thy own Prophets, and that under the color of law, what can thou say
for this that will satisfy? what Apology can thou make to God, for misusing
his Prophets and shedding the blood of the just in the midst of thee? What
can thou say for satisfying the Nations, who have heard of the renown of
these men, these precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, who have been
dashed in pieces in the midst of thee, and dealt with, as earthen pitchers, the
work of the hands of the potter? will thou not be speechless, and not have
wherewith to Answer him that reproves and reprocheth thee? Can thou look
fordward, and not blush to think, what succeeding generations will say of thee?
What will thou say, when it shall be asked, by one whom thou must Answer, what
manner of men were these whose blood thou did had? (however thou have
represented them now as malefactors, that thou might deal so with them; yet
then must thou say) all of them were as the sons of Kings. Ah Scotland,
Scotland, the most solemnly engaged to God, and the most guilty and ungrate of
all the nations under the heaven: Do thou not fear after all this, the cry
of the souls under the Altar? Saying with a loud voice, how long O Lord, holy
and true, do thou not judge and avenge our blood, on them that dwell on the
earth? Thou was once made use of as a Carpenter, to f^ay the horns of them,
who did push the in heritance of the Lord; but now the spirit of the horns
has entered into the Carpenters: and do thou think thy self secure after
all this? It Is true their is no visible power or party upon earth, of whom thou
have much reason to be a afraid; but remember that he who is higher then the
highest regards, who will make inquisition for the blood of his saints which
thou have shed and his interests: If thou will fear nothing else, let me
recommend the Scythian fear unto thee, of whom it is reported, that they fear
nothing, but that the heavens should fall upon them: Alas* if thy enemy be
above thee, how will thou guard thy head, o^ secure thy heart, when he gives
the blow, and recompenses thy way upon thine own head? but if thou will still
go on, and in stead of smiting on thy thigh, and saying what have I done?
harden thy self, and think to prosper, I shall desire Grace to have such a
frame of soul, as to weep for thee in secret: But to return to my purpose from
which this sad meditation has a little withdrawn me: though such I say, was
the tenderness of his master to this servant; yet when he had nothing else to
complain of (being for many days together before his death, filled with as
much joy of the Holy Ghost as he could hold) he went away regrating this
(though with a sweet submission to his Master's will) that he died not in that
bed of honor, and was not brought forth, to breath out his life and last upon
a scaffold; since his Master was dealing such favors amongst his followers
(for to some (and blessed be he eternally who carried them honorably through)
it was given, not only to believe; but also to suffer, and to the conviction
of their enemies, as men who seemed rather to triumph over that King of
terrors, then to de daunted by it is dreadful aspect) and since he was taking
such proofs of the fidelity and affection of some of his followers. It will
not be amiss, for this purpose, to insert his own words, which were taken from
his mouth, not once but often reiterat: Now [said that faithful servant, even
when he was upon the threshold of glory, ready to receive the immortal crown]
my tabernacle is weak, and I would think it a more glorions way of going hence,
to lay down my life for the cause, at the Cross of Edinburgh or St Andrews; but
I submit to my Master's will. Is it any wonder then I say, since he, and these
other worthy men's way in witnessing for God, was so unlike ours and so far
beyond what is to be found in our faint appearances for him, as the one keeps
no proportion with the other; that there should be so remarkable a difference,
betwixt his bearing witness to; and testifying his complacencie in what they
did, and what we do: if there be, for the most part; some proportion, betwixt
the dispensation of God, and the disposition of men; What wonder; that he who
admitted them to the nearest familiarity with himself, deal thus with us, and
so let us know his breach of promise^ nay, if there be any thing strange, and
to be wondered at in this? It is rather, that he has not been more terrible to
us, by writting his displeasure against our lukwarmness in greater Characters;
then that we have not been more indulgently dealt with. It is exceedingly of
all our concernments, to lay this to heart, and seriously to consider, whether
this be not the very thing that maks him keep a distance from us? I suppose,
upon a very overly search, and survey of our way, it will be found, that by our
unworthy carriage in his matters, we have rewarded this evil to our own souls:
Our suffering [if it deserve that name] is with less edification and advantage
to the Church, and less comfort to our own souls; because of our testimony be
weighed in the balance of the sanctuary, it will be found light, and to want
many pounds, not only of what it ought to have, but what theirs had, whose
work was found perfect, before God. But if we be really desireous, to be dealt
with as they were [and what is so desirable, next to heaven, and the coming of
the Kingdom of the son of God upon the earth] let us endeavor to carry as they
did: were they not men of the like passions and infirmities with us? why then,
should not we aim, to be men of the like faithfullness and zeal with them:
then is it, that we may hope to have sweet and halcyon days in his service;
such as will make us the envy of our enemies, a comfort to our friends, and an
ornament to our profession: hereby shall a good report be brought up upon the
ways of God, and we shall be living witnesses, that Godliness with all
disadvantages, and when accompanied with the fiery trial, is great gain, and
has it is hundred fold in this life, even with persecution. Let us study to be
like them in going about our Master's work, and then we have rational ground
to hope, that he who showed by his dealing with the cloud of witnesses that
went before us [and do still compass us about, and call us to follow on] that
he was not unrighteous, to forget their zeal in doing, their patience in
suffering, their work and labor of love; will also remember us, with the
favor that he bore to these who went before us: then may we expect that he
will say to our soul in secret, when we have faithfully acquit our selves for
him in public, go your way now, and eat your bread, though it be brown, with
joy, and drink your drink, though it be not wine, with a merry heart; for I
have accepted your works, and these are come up in remembrance with me. O but
one of these hours, which (...) Rutherfoord had in God's company, were worth
many years suffering, and sweating in the heat of the day! I know the Pre^^us
and their Party, will think themselves at a loss, to hear of it, or have it
said, that God did admit to such familiarity with himself, his faithful
witness against the wickedness of their way [(...) grant indeed, it is a
special prejudice to them, for though it b^ ^^range, yet they who persecut his
favorites and followers, would even he thought to do God good service] but
lest I should seem to say, that there was some singularity in God's dealing
with him [which I know would great the ear of some of them, who pretend to be
chief amongst the rest, that had a particular splen agai^^ this eminent servant
of Jesus Christ, I need not trouble the world in telling them who he is, that
being no secret, though I know not, whether he would blush to have it said, he
hated and persecuted a man, so greatly beloved of God, and dear to all his
people, or if he would not rather boast of it, I owe him the charity that the
latter of the two will be his choice, and that for fear of being charmed he
will stop his ear from hearing that, why persecutest thou me? and will essay
to justify himself, and satisfy others, by saying (according to his
accustomed candor and conscience) that he was a ringleader amongst the
Phanaticks: it will sound harsh also I know, in the ears of them, who, in
joining with him, have served themselves heirs, to these, who went before them,
in persecuting him, and such faith full men as he was: For as they have come in
their places, so they persist in there practices, only with this difference,
that in making havoc of the Church of God, they out do all that ever made
Apostasy to that way, and run at that rate, in endeavoring the ruin of the
work of Reformation, as if they were afraid to be outrun by any who should
come after them, or have it said, that there had ever been men, who with more
malice did persecut, and stretch forth their hands, not against certain of the
disciples, but against the whole Church of God: Reader Pardon I pray thee, that
I now and then digress in a parenthesis, while these men come my way, for thou
know very well according to the proverb, that the devil should have his due
and I desire to do them justice, and here I close it) If they should take it
ill I say, to have so much said to the advantage of this worthy man, If it will
be acceptable to them to hear it, I have a mind to gratify them so far, as to
say, that Mr Rutherfoord was not alone in this; as his practice in that
opposition, was not peculiar to himself (for he but wakled in the way of them
who left him an example, to continue with Christ in his temptations) so, his
privileges were not so peculiar to himself, that he had none to share with him:
And therefore I say [if they can reap any satisfaction by having it said, or if
they have a mind still to quarrel, see if there be any of them in case to
convince me of a falshood] that God mad it known, not only to themselves but
to the world, how highly he esteemed the fidelity of others also before him,
who were his constant witnesses against introducing and est bl^^hing of Prelacy
in Scotland, he not only made themselves find what favorites they, were by
putting them (if I may say so) upon his secrets: (for Mr Davidson, Mr Welsh, Mr
Bruce and many others of the valiant soldiers of Christ and worthy witnesses
in their time, were known to have been Prophets (which I could evince by many
particular passages, but they deserve a more honorable mention, and it may be
some will undertake it, then to be shut up within the limits of a parenthesis)
particularly renowned Mr Welsh, who at home, and a broad in France, was taken
notice of, as an extraordinary man, as a servant from whom his! Master did not
conceal what he was about to do: not one word has fallen to the ground, of
all that, which by that Seer was foretold, concerning the trouble of Scotland:
Has not the sword of strangers, according to his prediction, been made drunk
with the blood of the slain? Is not Christ crucified this day in Scotland,
which he foresaw would follow? Yea, and buried too; and for fear that he should
^ise again, there is by the procurment of the chief Priests, a watch set, the
great stone rolled to the mouth of the s^pulchre is sealed, and all made as
sure as they can: because if he rise upon them again, this last error will
prove worse then the first by far: the Lord I say has fullfilled in every
circumstance the word of his servant hithe^to; only the last part of it is not
vet accomplished, wherein he foretells of the glorious resurrection of Christ
crucified and buried in Scotland; but the exact accomplishment of the former,
puts us in expectation of the latter, not^ithstanding that the great stone of
an Act res^^ssary, and many subsequent Acts suitable to that sad One, is rolled
to the mouth of the s^pulehre, and not withstanding that the Priests (the
Prelates I should say) have by their importunity, procured an order from the
Magistrate to make it as sure as they can, and being now clothed with the for
mality of that law whereby he was crucified (for alas we have a law now, by
which law he must die!) they are most diligent in setting their watches and
making all fast: This is the thing I say, that his sad hearted disciples are in
expectation of; notwithstanding of all the endeavors of his enemies to the
contrary, and then Prelacy in Scotland will breath out it is life and last
together: for between Christ's rising and reigning, and their falling, there
has ever been seen amongst us, a certain connection: And truly for as great
an enemy as they may think me, I would make a very friendly overture unto them
(I grant I come to counsel uncalled, and I hope also, that my soul shall never
enter into their secrets) and this is the advice I have to give them, that they
would even look so far before their nose, as to make their Testament, so long
as they are in case to go to Kirk and market; but I fear I lose my labor; for
ere ever Judas will part with his pieces, he is in the next door to hang
himself, and who can help it) God not only dealt thus with them, I say, as to
put them upon his secrets; but he made their very enemies take notice of them
oftimes, as men that had been with Jesus. Has it not been a heart-staying, and
hand-strengthening, remarke amongst the servants and people of God in our
native Land, especially in a declining time, that God did singularly shine from
heaven upon, and show his satisfaction in the way, and toward the persons of
these of his servants, who stood firm in their opposition to Prelacy; and that
he did as signally, one way or other, either sooner or latter, give
significations of his dislike of the way and persons of them who turned aside
to these crooked courses: And was it ever more visible (as to the latter part)
then at this day: It may be that they will think it sufficent to convince me of
a^ly, that their greatness and grandeur is such, as if they had monopolized to
themselves all the riches and honor of the Nation; but if they will have
patience to hear me to Amen, I may possibly convince them of a truth they, are
not willing to hear; for I not only grant, that they have forgotten their
Master's directions, inhibiting them, to to lift up themselves above their
brethren; but I will grant them this also [for they most have much given them]
that they have carried away the primacy, and precedence from the Nobility, on
whose necks they now trample; but when all this is granted them, yet they have
not convinced me of telling an untruth: they must have leave to put out mine
and other men's eyes besides, (which we are not willing to give them; though if
any man would gratify his Grace, and their Lordships, he must part with these
in the first place; for an implicit faith is the basis and foundation of their
Kingdom of darkness, without which, it would fall about their cars, and but
overwhelme them in the rubbish, and that would be very sad to them, for I
suspect they have no great mind to die) before this come so much as under
debat, almost with indifferent men, whither God be angry at their way? His very
giving of them up, to persecute his people and servants, says nothing, if it
say not this; that what ever be their outward prosperity, he has classed them
with Pharaoh, in pouring out his plagues upon their heart: Is not this seen,
that so soon as a man becoms serious in seeking of God; he becoms the butt of
their malice, and the mark against which they bend their bow, and shoot the
arrows of their indignation? And so soon as any begins to mind seriously the
concernments of his soul, then, sine monitore, he falls in a dislike with them,
and their way: I do not say, that all who hate the Prelates are Saints, for
their is sufficient in their way to make them odious to others; but is not this
known, that these who once begin to set their face toward God, turn their back
upon them: I am sure this observation does seldom fail, or can be proved false
in our native Land: And then on the other hand, since these men were exalted,
do not the wicked walk on every side? Is there not a profane spirit (the
constant attendant of Episcopacy in Scotland) broken loose in the land? Is
there not such a flood of impiety running through the land, that carries most
men down the current, as has hardly been seen? has not this leprousie spread
it self over the whole land? So, that we are an abomination and talk to all
about us: And if any would endeavor to accomplish a diligent search, to find
out the fountain that casts forth this mire and dirt, to the defiling of the
Land, and defacing of congregations, he would it may befind it, where it ought
lest to be expected: These streams of impety and impurity run from the
sanctuary, hence is it, that profanity goes forth through the whole land; and
can it be otherwise when so many faithful Ministers are driven away, and men
put in their places to handle the law, of most of whom without breach of
Charity, it may be said, that they know not God, and care not for the souls of
his people: It Is under the shadow of this plant (which because it is not of
our heavenly father's planting, we live under the expectation, and, though our
eyes should be shut before we see it, we hope to die in the faith of it is being
plucked up) that these weeds have grown up, so that alas! The vineyard of the
Lord of hosts, is now no more like his enclosure, it brings forth briers and
thorns in stead of good fruit: He planted the church of Scotland a noble vine;
Wholly a right seed, but since it became a seminary for Prelates, the
conversation of the generality proclaims this, that we are turned into the
degenerat plant of a strange vine unto him: This is the Prelaticall
reformation, which is suitable to it self all along; for having purged out of
the church, the faithful Ministers of Christ [and the few who are yet
remaining, being in expectation of the same lot) what can follow among the
people; but, that the Land should be drowned with a deluge of profanity: And
are we not for the most part [Oh if with a suitable measure of sorrow I could
make mention of it] as the children of the Ethiopians to him? Are not our
spots, unlike the spots of his people? This observation I say, as it was a very
heart-staying consideration in former times, and was in stead of many arguments
amongst them who where no great disputants; so I hope: [since it was never more
evident) it will still prove a heart-establishing consideration in the faith
once delivered to the saints.

Reader, how desireous soever thou may be, to have dead Mr Rutherfoord live,
in the hearts of the present and succeeding generations, by an account of his
singularly gracious life, and answerably glorious death: yet, I shall not (for
that would lead me a length beyond the just limits of an Epistle, where,
contrary to my purpose, I find my self almost arrived already) be able to
satisfy thy desire, nor answer thy expectation. It Is not my present work to
tell thee, that he was a Gentleman by extraction. That he was educat at Schools
and Colleges, where he was admired for the Pregnancy of his parts, and
deservedly looked upon, even then, as a person of whom great things might be
expected: Of his being pitched upon for a Profession of Philosophy by the
College of Edinburgh (where he was educat) when he was yet very young: Of his
being called thence to the Ministry in Anwoth (to which charge be entered, by
the means of that worthy Nobleman my Lord Kenmur, without giving any engagment
to the Bishop) where he labored night and day with great success, the whole
country being to him, and accounting themselves, as his particular flock:
There it was, where he wrote that great Masterpiece of Learning against the
Arminians (which yet was but a compend of what he then intended) his
Exercitationes Apologeticae: Of his persecution by the Prelates, who were so
sound in the faith, as to challenge and accuse him for writting that book:
Being called before their high Commission court, he appeared and declined it,
as none of the Courts of Christ [nor was there need of any thing else for a
confirmation that it came not from on high, but from below, save it is procedor;
for it is Acts had the very die and visage of hell upon them: If they will plead
that it is from above, they will be pusled to pitch upon a period, or fix upon
any other time when it came down, except with the fallen Angels; but it may be,
this please such Angels of the Church [so they will be called] for they boast
much of Antiquity: And truly that which gives ground ^or this conjecture, that
it came down from heaven in that company, is, that it persecuts the saints, and
servants of the most high; and if there were none such upon earth, it would
have no work] and was by this high Commission put from his ministry, and sent
to Aberdeen, where the Doctors found to their confusion, that the Puritans were
Clergymen as well as they: Of his returning to his former Charge, upon that
happy change of affairs, in the Year 1638: and his being shorthly after sent to
the profession of Theology in the University of St Andrews by the General
Assembly (where he was also called to be worthy Mr Blair's Colleague in the
Ministry) which being the seat of the Arch-pre^ate, was the very Nursery of
all superstition in worship, and Error in Doctrine, and the sink of all
Profanity in conversation amongst the Students: where God did so singularly
second his servants indefatigable pains, both in teaching in the Schools, and
preaching in the Congregation, that it became forth with a Lebanon, out of
which were taken Cedars for building the house of the Lord through the whole
land: Not a few of whom are this day, amongst these, who have obtained mercy of
the Lord, to be his faithful witnesses, against Scotland's present, shamfull,
and unparaleelled defection: Of his being sent with other worthy Ministers, by
the General Assembly, to the famous Synod at London; where, during the time of
his abode, he published several pieces: In a word of his unparaleelled
painfullness, and holy Zeal in being about his Master's business; so that he
seemed to pray Constantly, to preach constantly, to catechize constantly, to be
still in visiting the sick, in exhorting from house to house, to teach as much
in the schools, and spend as much time with the young men, as if he had been
sequestrat from all the world besides: and withal, to write as much, as if he
had been constantly shut up in his closet [sufficient proof whereof, has been
given to the world, by the many pieces he has published; but the great bulk of
Manuscripts which he has left behind him, and must lie buried with himself,
will put this further out of doubt] so that one Mr Rutherfoord seemed to be
many able godly men in one, or one, who was furnished with the grace, and
abilities of many. It is not I say my present purpose; to give any particular
account to the world of these; or of the many things he had to wrestle with,
especially toward the end of his days, and of his edifying death; that may be
done herafter, by a more dexterous hand, and skillfull pen, with much advantage
and edification to the Church of God: Only I may say, that if amongst the
heathens, Hercules was looked upon, as so far both above the applause of any,
who undertook to commend him, and beyond the reach of the obloquie and reproach
of any, who had so fallen out with his wits, as to derogat from his worth; that
it was a Problem amongst them, whether he who undertook to praise him, or he
who vented any thing to his prejudice, did commit the greatest Soloecisme
(though it was but Belluina gloria whereof he could boast) I suppose, with more
reason, among them who know better to make the true paralleel betwixt things
that differ, and are more fit to judge of that, which is of true worth, and
great price in the sight of God, I should seem more ridiculous to say much to
the advantage of the Author, whose praise [without the help of my blunt pen] is
in all the Churches of Christ; whose manner of life, in all Godliness and holy
conversation, rendered him dear to the lovers of holmess, and who has left his
name for a blessing to the chosen of God: he was a true John the Baptist
indeed, totus, vox, a voice in habit, gesture, and conversation: in a word, in
his life, and at his death, he obtained that mercy of the Lord, even when he
said nothing, to preach to all who beheld his conversation (which was observed
to be in heaven, while he conversed amongst men] that their was nothing good;
but to draw near to God: And now being got up above, amongst these pages of
honor, who wait upon the King's own person, and having taken up his place
amongst the spirits of just men made perfect (after which this saint often
panted and for which he prayed night and day) he does by these Epistles, which
he has left behind him [wherein thou will perceive how his soul was drawn
forth in uncessant longings after that whereof he is now possessed] cry aloud
to you his companions, the saints that are in the world, to come up hither and
see, that, which cannot be seen while ye are there; that, which is only worth
the seeing, that, which if it were known, would make you quarrel with death for
delaying to shut your eyes upon other objects: Leave the dark world (does he
say) and come up hither to this blessed land of light, where all our childish
thoughts of God are gone, and evanished in this noon-day-vision, where the
understanding is fully illuminat, and there is no cloud to be-night or eclipse
the soul in it is uptakings of God, where the will has a through compliance
with, and a perfect complacencie in the will of God, where the affections do
eternally run in a straight line toward him, and are for ever put beyond
hazard of diverting toward any other thing, or of being enamoured with any
other object. Though I have no purpose, to insist on the particulars of his
life, or death I say, yet before I close this section, there are two things
which I cannot, I ought not, for all the haste, to conceal or let pass without
a remarke, because one was looked upon by many, as a thing very observable, and
the other, will I know, be taken notice of, and welcomed by all the people of
God: The first relats to the time when this faithful labourer was removed to
his rest, which was the night following that dark, and dismal day, wherein
the Act Rescissorie was past; the Lord thereby showing a special piece of
indulgence to his servant, in not adding grief to his sorrow, but hiding it
from these eyes, which had accoustomed themselves to trickle down without
intermission, both for what he saw, and what he foresaw: Since the Parliament
of Scotland, so solemnly engaged to God, would at once burst all these bonds,
and cast away these Cords from them, which were neither our bondage nor our
burden, but the badge of that glorious liberty, whereinto with a strong hand he
had vindicat us: and upon the matter, they would needs say to the God, whose
sworn subjects and servants they were, be gone from us; he would not let his
faithful servant (whose zeal to the work of God was such, that if the report
of this shameful revolt had not killed him at the first hearing outright; yet
it alone without any other sickness, would have been more then enough, to have
brought down his head with sorrow to the grave) see another sun arise upon that
Land, out of which the sun of righteousness was banished by a law: And alas!
Who would desire to dwell, where Christ may not reside, with freedom, honor,
and safety? Who, that prefers Jerusalem to there chief joy, would love to
outlive the departing of the glory? Might not Jesus Christ have said to our
Parliament, for which of my good deeds is it, that ye stone me? Have I been a
wilderness or land of drought unto you? Were ye not honorable and renowned
amongst the Churches abroad, after ye became precious in my sight? Did I not
make your Adversaries sensible, that he who touched you, touched the apple of
mine eye, so long as ye were steadfast in my Covenant; and even after ye had
left your first love, and declined from the integrity of your espousalls, I
only visited this transgression with the rod, and this iniquity with strips;
nevertheless, my loving kindness did I not utterly take from you, nor suffered
I my faithfulness to fail: though I punished you as a Nation, I dwelt amongst
you as a Church; and I did not remove your teachers into corners, but your eyes
did see these, and ye did still hear the joyful sound, and, as if all that had
been to little, I gave you the desire of your heart, restored you to your
civil liberties, which ye had sinned away, and set you down in a free
Parliament: And do ye thus requit me? What, is this my entertainment, where I
was once crowned and cried up for a King? What a strange and astonishing change
is this, that the very persons who swore unto me the Oath of alleagance, and
did sing in my company, spreading their garments in the way with shouting, are
now crying, Crucify him, Crucify him? Shall I not have whereupon to lay my
head, except it be on a cold stone in a prison, amongst a people, who after a
most solemn manner, had given themselves away unto me? Can these be the very
men, who with hands lifted up to heaven, did so often, and so solemnly swear,
before my father, and before his holy Angels, and in the sight of all the
Nations, that they would be mine; and that I should have their lives and
fortuns at my disposal? Is it possible that these are the men, who carried, as
if they would have plucked out their very eyes, and given them unto me, who now
plat a crown of thorns and put upon my head? Is this the Nation and
Parliament, who swore that they would serve the Lord their God, and that
according to the Pattern showed them in the mount, and bound their soul to his
obedience by an Oath, and as they should answer to him, or expect a comfortable
appearance before the judge of quick and dead? Are they [might he say] the very
same persons, or is it another generation, who have not heard of that solemn
transaction betwixt me and the Nation, who have used me worse then the very
Gaderens? though these were void of religion; yet they had so much civility, as
to complement me out of their coasts, and pray me to be gone, without
committing any other Act of hostility against me, or beating me out of their
borders with tuck of drum; but now, shall it be by a law, sedition, and
treason, to assert any obligation to me, from all these Oaths? Shall it be a
Note of incapacity for any place of trust in Church or State, to say, that the
land is under the Oath of God, and that no power on earth can loose themselves,
or make void that obligation as to others; nay, that the formal abjuring of
these engagments to me, shall be, if not the unum necessarium; yet the sine quo
non, to qualify a man, for any public employment: Ah! Scotland by dealing thus
with thy Covenanted God, what have thou done? may not God who was thy own God
expostulat with thee, as he did with that people Jer. 2: 10, 11, 12. Go abroad
amongst the Nations, turn over all History sacred, and profane: Call for the
records of the nations, and see, if in these thou caust find any who have
dealt with their God, as thou have done? A precedent thou may possibly
find; but a paralleel in every respect thou can not: Thou art singular, and
by thy self, in committing these two evils (but such two, as are comprehensive
of all others: such two, as a third is not possible) departing from the living
God, and digging to thy self broken Cisterns that can hold no water: Thou will
find what folly is in this [I wish it be not too late] to pain thy self in
digging an empty Cisterne and in forsaking the fountain of all consolation, and
that a broke on too: as it has nothing in it, so it can hold nothing if it had
it: is not this to commit two such evils as makes a soul or nation truly
miserably: And yet this have thou done: O! may not the heavens be astonished
and horribly afraid at this requital we have given unto Jesus Christ? yea, we
were so bent to backsliding, and so hasty and headstrong in departing from
him, that we seemed to have lost, together with our loyalty to the son of God,
all respect to our own reputation [as it often falls out, that men lose the
better part of their reason, together with their religion: He who Lets go the
one, does seldom retain the other] for by that very vote (never to be
mentioned, without tears and detestation) whereby Christ was robbed of his
prerogative, they did (besides their design) divest themselves of their own
privileges, and while they un-king him, whom God has made King in Zion, [or
do that which he will-account so] they un-parliament themselves [Dirum omen to
them, and it may be, a token for good to the Nation] I nothing doubt, but some
of the most sagacious amongst them saw this then (though the generality without
considering either the ditch they were digging for themselves, by what they
did; or the danger that would follow upon their falling into it, suffered
themselves to be carried down with the current, and did run as they were
driven) or they have had time enough since, to think, in what capacity they
could sit, and act, after that Vote; for all laws being then repealed, which
did exautorat the Prelates: and incapacitat them for sitting, as one of the
Estats in Parliament, and these laws then, only being in force, which made
them an integrall and essential part of the high court of Parliament, the
third Estate was wanting, while they were away; without which the other two were
not in Capacity to Act as a Parliament; and if so, they may at their own
leisure consider, whether, the precious blood that they did shed after that
Vote, before the close of that session, may not be required at their hands
as-they would do well, to think what they would answer before men, if the
question were asked, quo warranto did ye shed this blood? It may be, they would
find themselves further to seek, as to what to say for satisfying any, the
they found these worthies in answering all the accusations of their accusers:
But what shall I say? It were more fit, to weep over this, then to write it,
and to cry unto him, against whom this is done, Will thou refrain thy self for
these things O Lord? Will thou hold thy peace and afflict us very sore? Alas we
made such haste, to pull down that beautiful house, wherein we and our fathers
had praised him, and to overturne the very foundations of the dwelling place of
his name to the ground; that in our precipitation to raze it, we have buried
our selves under the rubbish; for they are blind who do not see the me^ who
have done this, snarred in the work of their own hands: and this till more
come, should make the people of God Sing a Higgaion Selah. O if all who have
had a hand in it, would in time bethink themselves! Sure, in that reflection,
if they were serious, they would smit on their thigh, and say, Alas what have
we done? The second thing that I have to acquaint the with, and wherein I know
(if thou be one of them, who take pleasure in the dust of Zion's demolished
walls) thou will have a special complacencie, is, that as his servant did with
much sorrow of soul foresee, Scotland's shameful revolt (which is plain by the
last letter in this book) so, his Lord and Master, put him so far on this
secrets, as to let him see a delivery to the church on the other side of it:
Let us have but patience, there is a Plaudi^e for the saints and a song of
praise for the most high, after this storm is over and ended: mourn we may
and ought; but let us mourn in hope; for he is the Lord Jehovah who will
hasten it in his time: Which as it cannot be antidated by us, so it shall not
lie in the power of all that oppose themselves to postpone it: And to that
purpose, besides what thou may see in the last letter of this book, I shall
set down some of his own words without either comment, alteration, or addition.
Upon the last of Februvary 1661. Which was about a month before he died, at
the close of a large Testimony he gave to the work of Reformation: These were
his words (after he had been speaking of suffering for Christ,) blessed soul
(said he) who loves not his life to death; for on such rests the spirit of
Glory and of God, 1 Pet. 4: 14. But we cannot say, but this is a day of
darkness, and a day of blasphemy, and rebuke: The Lord has covered himself
with a cloud in his anger: we looked for peace but behold evil, our souls
rejoiced when his Majesty did swear the Covenant of God, and put thereto his
seal and subscription, and after confirmed it by his royal promise, so, that
the subjects mind blessed the Lord, and rested upon the healing word of a
Prince, but ^ow Alas! The contrary is enacted by law, the carved work broken
down, Ordinances defaced, so that we are brought to the former bondage, and
Chaos of Prelaticall confusions, and Anarchy: And the royal prerogative due to
Christ, pulled off his head: we havo seen days of sorrow, and have just cause
to fear we be made to read, and eat that book, wherein is written, Lamentation,
and mourning, and ^^e; but we are to believe, that Christ will not so depart
from the land, but a remnant shall be saved, and he shall reign a victorious
conquering king to the ends of the earth: O! That there were Nations. Kinreds,
tongues, and all the people of Christ's habitable world, encom passing his
throne with cries, and tears for the spirit of suppl^^ation, promised to be
poured upon the inhabitants of Judah, for that effect. Thus he closed his
Testimony: I shall only add another passage to this purpose: About two hours
and an half before he was removed: Amongst other things he spoke, which did
relish of heaven, and refreshed the souls of all that heard them, he had this
expression: I do no ways doubt of it, but Christ will arise and wound his
enemies in their ^oins: This was only taken, but the observer says, he had
many to the same purpose. Now, this was that very night, wherein the Act
Rescissorie was past: As if God who had taken notice of such an high affront
done to him, would let his dying servant know, to the end he might communicate
it to others, that he would not only repeal that Act, but that he would
rescinde the rescinders: A wound in the loins, when the blow is given by the
hand of him, who is God Almighty most prove mortal; If he wound them there,
they most fall, though they were stronger then lions; for who may stand before
him, when once he is angry? The men of might will not find their hands, when
the party they engage with, is the Omnipotent God: When men are become so high,
that they are too hard a party for any on earth to deal with, if their way be
contrary to him, then they fall directly in his hand, to deal with them; and
it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God: He is such a
party, as thou can neither fight nor flee: Oh Scotland, Scotland, if thou
would yet think on thy way and remember this, before he come to enter the
lists with thee, who quickly puts his enemies out of a posture of defense! O,
if thou would yet kneel before him, whom God had made King in Zion, and kiss
the son lest he be angry! For if he be angry thou must perish, and there is no
way to prevent this, but to remember from whence thou art fallen and repent and
do the first works.

As for the letters themselves, I shall not offer to commend them, they had
letters of recommendation deeply engraven on the hearts of all who have seen
them, and can savor the things that are of God; this they had I say, amongst
them who have their senses exercised to discern good and evil, long before they
were made thus public in the world; so they need not my commendation, nor will
the detraction of any, who have a mind for that, blast their reput; as they
are above the one, so they despise the other; but sure I am, this may besaid,
if thou have any acquaintance with the sweet breathings of the spirit of God,
if thou have ever seen by tasting how good he is, or have found what
soul-anguish does follow upon the hiding of his face from a person, who has
placed his satisfaction so entirly in the light of his countenance lifted up
upon the soul, that the man cannot enjoy himself, when he does not enjoy him,
but carries as one deprived of all that, which made life more desirable then
death; if thou be such I say, then thou will find somewhat hereto take thee:
here thou will perceive both these conditions set before thine eye, and
examplified in an eminent saint: thou will both find what a heaven the saints
have, or is to be had in this side of glory and how, as a sensible presence
maks them forget all their sorrows, so, a felt absence does imbitter a^l their
other enjoyments.

In General I may say this of these Epistles [and it may be after thou have
perused them, thou will seal it] that thou have many volumes wrapped up together
in a few words, a great soul shut up in a little body, much of the marrow of
real religion, enclosed in every line: If thou be only taken and delighted
with obstruse and high-flown notions, which have not a native connection with
inflaming the heart, with love to God; but are rather the Ignis fatuus of the
age, being for the most part, smoke for light, or at best, a dime flash, rising
out of the darkened understanding of men, whose light, till they be illuminat
from above; as it arises out of a dark dungeon; so, it leads to destruction,
and in stead of directing the man who follows it, to a place of rest, it leads
him to the pit, and leaves him there to perish. If thou be taken, I say with
such kind of stuff; I shall not bide thee, but I know thou will go else
where; but if thou be one, who loves not to feed upon ashes, and have no mind
to fill thy belly with that east wind, which in stead of nourishment,
produces nothing but much torment in the inward parts, I know thou will
welcome this piece, as that which has both meat and medicine for thy soul in
it: Here thou will meet with one warmed with the love of God, shining and
reflecting heat upon all that are about him, letting thee know from his own
experience, what is to be found in a fellowship with God, and desireous of
nothing so much, as that thou and others may share with him in that same love,
which is better then life, and be partakers of that same blessedness, which
made him boast of God all the day and bless him self in his afflicted lot: He
would have thee taste of that, which made him cheerful under the cross, and
put him in case, not only to look, but to laugh all his troubles out of
countenance: And if thou will but converse with him a little, it may be, thou
find thy heart burn within the while thou talkest with this warm soul, whose
words seem as they drop, to cast fire in the affections, and set the heart in a
flame. The Author in his other writtings (which have always a special tincture
of holiness; for even in following the most obstruse notion, and apparently
remot from practice, thou will still perceive him spirare sanctitatem) he is
much above many men; but in these (how low soever at the first look they may
appear) he is above himself, being often, either as a man elevate above the
pitch of mortality, and caught up already into the Quire of Angels, or as an
Angel come down amongst men, showing the inhabitants of this lower world,
somewhat of that, which will be still a great secret, while we are here, to wit,
what a life they live, who see God as he is, and enjoy him.

For the subject matter thou will meet with in these Epistles, I shall not say
much, there is a sweet and pleasant variety of purpose to be found in them,
whereof thou can only expect a just account by a perusal of the whole; but
mostly thou will find these things insisted upon. 1. What high spring-tides of
joy and consolation, did fill and overflow the soul of this sufferer, so, as
sometimes ye have him expressing himself as pained with a surcharge of love [O
rare and blessed disease] and having nothing else to seek, there are earnest
longings, after a more capacious soul, to contain more of that infinite Ocean,
which has neither brime nor bottom: This is the gain of one who can suffer
the loss of all things for Christ: This is the cool refresing shade that they
find in the furnace, which not only keeps the fire of affliction from
scorching them, or consuming them into ashes; but maks it a more desirable lot,
then what others account the best of lives: the soul amidst these flames being
admitted to such a neerness with God, as causes joy to overflow all it is
banks, and perfumes the heart with delight, is so far from complaining, because
of the fiery trial, that the cross of Christ is more desirable to it, then a
crown: and since it is there, where nex to heaven, his people enjoy most of
himself, it maks them sing sweetly amidst all the outward sorrows that befall
them, and puts them in case to command a consort of Music within, while others
in their fool's paradise, laugh as they list, have sadness at their heart, and
find themselves peirced through with many sorrows. 2. Ye have sometimes a
felt emptiness (for this full feast, is not, or cannot be the ordinary diet, it
may well be the extraordinary disert of the people of God, while they walk by
faith and not by sight; the constancy of that joy, as well as the fullness of
it, is reserved for the chamber of presence, no saint how eminent soever, even
in suffering for Christ, can expect, that all tears shall be wiped from his
eyes, till he come to that land, where all the inhabitants have ever lasting
joy upon their heads, and where he will be put beyond hazard of sinning, as well
as without the reach of suffering) there is sometimes a felt emptiness I say,
that casts into a fever of desires: That river of God that is full of water,
which did overflow and refresh the soul, running again into that sea whence it
came; and in this low ebb, ye see how the patient, is pained with absence; and
what a panting there is for a sensible presence; the soul as it were is
evapourate in such wishes as these, O when will thou come unto me! Or, O when
shall I come and appear before thee, and be put once for all, and for ever
beyond the fear of the arising of any cloud to eclipse the light of thy
countenance! The soul in this absence, is scorched with the fever and flame of
burning desires; but to keep it from being burnt up, there is hope, this holds
the soul in life that it expire not; this saves from swooning and perserves
from sinking into despondency: And though while hope is deferred, the heart be
sick; yet there is ease in this very pain, for an unerring expectation of a
future good, yields a present ease to the expectant, and maks the man give
himself the Check thus, why art thou cast down O my soul? This sickness was
never yet unto death, but ever to the glory of God, therefore hope thou in him,
for I shall yet praise him: In a word that which is principally insisted upon,
in these short summaries of a communion with God, is this on the one hand, how
a hungry and longing soul is filled and feasted with the Consolations of God,
and when in that posture, how pufled and non-plus'd, as to what to think, or
say of God: It knows not what to do, or how to lay out it self for him, the
satisfaction that it has in him, and the obligation it sees it self under to
him, making it look one very thing it does for him, says or thinks of him,
with a kind of regrate and holy dissatisfaction: It does not please it self in
pleasing him, and though he accept what love offers, yet love desiderats so
much in the offering, that it presents all with a blush: and suitable to this
amiable and orderly confusion of spirit, it is greatest Oratory and Eloquence,
is, a kind of abrupt, concise, and broken discourse: It is most desireous to
speak, but not knowing what to say, which is not unworthy of him, it falls
into silent admiration, and yet some thing it must say; wherein though, it do
not please it self; yet it maks good sense before him, and is a most pleasent
melody in his ears; it is then, when he seems to be so taken with that, wherein
the soul finds so many failings and defects, that he says speak on, let me see
that blushing countenance, ^^t me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice and
thy countenance is comely. And truly thou may perceive much of this kind
of discourse in these Epistles, whereto the holy writter was so habituat in
these soliloquies with God, which were ordinary to him in his retirement, that
his pen, and preaching, did ever after keep the tincture, and had the relish of
that: For while many preached notions, and so^e spoke because they believed; he
was perceived oftimes, not so much to speak as believing; as seeing: His being
so long in the mount with God, made his face to shine ever thereafter in his
public appearances: And there was some peculiar sweetness in his Phrase
[especially in crying up, and commending the love of Christ: In mentioning the
joy of the Holy Ghost, or the Glory of the life to come] beyond what was to be
found, even with other holy men: Neither was it amongst the dry Schoolmen, nor
at Arestotle his feet (though there were few in the age, so well acquaint with
either) that he learned this; Nay, nay, flesh and blood did not, could not
reveal it unto him, he was a student above the clouds, and there it was, where
he learned these Metaphysics. This I say i the thing upon the one hand which
is insisted upon, and on the other, thou have the sad condition of a soul
deprived of these sweet enjoyments: He who was just now taken in to the
banqueting house, and had the banner of love for his canopy, has that spiced
wine which his soul was drinking with delight, snatched out of his hand, and is
panting for a drop of the rivers of his pleasure, wherein not long ago he was
bathing himself: Where upon follows a night of sorrow in the soul; because the
sun that did illuminat and warm it, with his rays, is set: Then, as if the
soul would break forth at many passages together, for have to be after him, who
has withdrawn himself, it runs out at the eyes in tears, and at the mouth in
complaints, because of his absence; yet faith sets down the fainter, upon the
brink of the river, and puts him under an arrest (that he run not away) till
the sea flow again: And desire maks him look out with a watery eye as impatient
of delay, the inward Echo of the heart, in the mean time, being still this, how
long will thou hide thy face from me? How long? and while he is in thi^
posture, ye would not know him to be the m^n, that a few minutes since he was
and a few minut hence he man and will be: and no wonder, sinc^ that is wanting
and away, which wa the health of his countenance, that he look pale: As the
weeping man's eye, being blinded with water, cannot take up objects as they
are, especially if they be at any distance; so ye have this holy man in these
heavy hours, venting his jealousies, and because of withdrawing, giving way to
his sorrow: Now, as the joy of enjoying God, is by the former, made clear to be
of all the greatest (for under these full manifestations, the soul may be
transported to such an ecstasy of delight that for the time, whether in the
body, or out of the body, the man knows not) so, the sorrow for being deprived
of that, (the giver seeing it necessary, to withold and suspend these
manifestations, knowing that heaviness for a season through manifold
temptations, is fit for these, who are sons of consolation and who shall have a
few days hence, an everlasting year of Jubilee) is, of all sorrows seen to be
the sorest and sharpest. This is soul anguish, and so l^st of any supportable:
because it maks the very spirit, which if it were sound would sustain a man's
infirmities, sink under it: While it is thus with him, ye may perceive that his
bed cannot comfort him, nor his couch ease his complaint: And in this fever,
there are some expressions dropped, which after the hight is over, he does
retract, as rash and unadvised, and upon more mature deliberation, i^ mad^ to
say, this was my infirmity: And truly he who intends the advantage of the
whole, in his way of dealing with every member of that body, whereof he is
head, has excellently ordered this matter, that they who have the fullest
feasts of joy, and are admitted to the nearest fellowship upon earth, to the
end, that pride may be hide from their eyes; have ordinarily the deepest
downcastings: These warm hours and hot blenks of a sensible presence, are
often followed with a sharp shower and dark night of bitter desertion; so
that if poor souls in reading these, should begin to think or say, Alas! We are
sparingly dealt with, we are great strangers to such a favourit's feasts; let
them consider also (besides that he was an Ambassador now in bonds, and so his
Master allowed liberally upon him) that their soul-anguish is short of his, and
so, if they consider his condition well, they will see, that though he had much
yet he had nothing over; and if they take notice of the mercy that is in their
own, they will perceive also, that though they have little yet they have no
lake; for he abounds toward his, in all wisdom and prudence. There is a third
condition spoken frequently to in these Epistles also, which lies in the middle
betwixt these two: And that is, such a communion with God, as consists in the
soul's being well pleased with him and being most desireous to please him in
all things, abstracting from these extraordinary transpotts of joy upon the one
hand, and free likewise of these deep down-castings upon the other: And this is
the more ordinary way of the saints, whose daily exercise it is, to come and
take out their directions from their Master, and endeavor to walk according to
these, both as men who are still under their Masters eye and as these who must
give an account of themselves to him: In which service, they want not their own
sweet peace; for the way wherein they walk is a way of pleasantness, and all
these paths are peace; though it be not such an overflowing peace, as amounts
to a joy unspeakable and full of glory; for full joy is nothing else, but peace
swelling without it is ordinary channel and overflowing all it is banks: And on
the other hand, they want not their own checks and challenges, they are often
before God with the tear in their eye, and knows what it is, to sigh because
of a body of death within them: Because of that law which is in their members
warring against that law which is in their mind, and bringing them into
Captivity to the law of sin, which is in their members; yet this is short of
the sorrow of some dear to him, who are made to roar, by reason of the
disquietness of their heart and to cry out of the arrows of the Almighty
sticking within them and the poison thereof drinking up their spirit; so that
while they suffer this, they are with wi^e Heman almost distracted. These
things I say, are mainly insisted upon, which according to an epistolar method,
lie scattered in several parcells, up and down the book: In reading whereof,
thou will easily perceive also, that though the whole of these Epistles may be
of singular use for a Christian in every condition, yet a great many of them
have a more special reference, both to the comforts and the carriage of a
Christian under the Cross (whether his affliction be outward trouble, or inward
soul-Excercise and terror) where he is most frequently to be found: Which is
all I have to say for the matter. There are not a few in this generation I
know, who will make i^ their business, and think it of their interest, to
derogat from the esteem which these Epistles do justly challenge, and will
readily get, from all who know how to prize things according to their worth; as
knowing very well, that what respect these get and gain amongst readers, they
lose; though I may truly say, and they will at last sinde it so, that if they
get the thing they seek by this artifice, they lose by that getting: and I may
asure my self also, if these either find the a Christian or make thee such,
they may well lose by this labor any esteem thou had for them, but they will
not prosylite thee, to their profan contempt of so spiritual matter; yet I
know they will essay it: First, somewhat to this purpose may be said and will be
suggested by them, that here is a needless and nauseating repetition of the
same thing; though it may be, they are not so displeased, that it is said
often, as that it said at all; or if the frequenency of it offend them, it is
out of a fear, that what is often said, be once listened to, and at ast
learned. I grant that the same matter and purpose is diverse times touched and
insisted upon; But consider 1. that thi^ is to diverse persons, and is there
either reason or religion in it, to envy him the Liberty of telling all the
fearers of God, to whom he writs, what was done for his soul, or the people of
God, the advantage of that relation? Was it not for the edification of the
Church, that all who had heard of his persecution for the Gospel, should hear
also, that the world, do there worst, cannot make a sufferer truly miserable,
while God maks him happy in a communion with himself: The heat of persecution
may dry up, or imbitter all the nether springs, but then the soul has free
access to the upper, and is admitted to drink yea drink abundantly of these
rivers of his pleasure: This is the spiced wine he drinks, and the meat the
gets to eat in secret, which the world knows not of, and cannot take from
him; and having found how sweet to the taste this bread of God, which comes
down from heaven, is, he cannot forbear to tell others, how he is feasted; to
excite desires in all to come and share with him in these dainties, and
forbear to surffet themselves with the world's deceitful meat 2. consider,
that it is at diverse times, and surely, he finding the consolations of God new
every morning, and abounding every moment, it had been a piece of base
ingratitude in him, to have made mention of that but once, which God had given
him often. 3. Consider, though the same matter be often mentioned; yet it is
mostly with a sweet and taking variety of phrase; he brings forth the old and
new together, nay, there is ever so much new in it, as may contribute to kindle
new desires in the, in order to the satisfaction of thy own soul, to seek what
he found, and when thou have fallen upon that, and art filled with it, thy
practice in telling it over to others, will, without doubt, have such a
coincidency with his, as will justify what he has done, and thou will then
judge, that an apology for publishing and frequent proclaming the goodness of
the Lord in the land of the living is either wholly superfluous. Or it does
suppose the reader not be a Christian, at least in case.

Secondly something will be said by malicious mutterers, (I know) against the
apparent courseness of some phrases, and commonness of some words made use of
by the Author; who all along sets himself, to make use of the most ordinary
expressions, which are in use among the common sort of people. Something I say,
of this kind may probably be belched forth, by this carping, criticizing,
profane, and prejudicat age: But If they would remember, what was said (by men
much more knowing then themselves, and more able to discern what ought to be
spoken, both as to matter and words) to the commendation of Plautus, who made
use of the most common words that were in use, amongst the most common sort of
people in Rome, Si ipsae Musae loquerentur ore Plautino uterentur; they would
see reason, rather to commend a dexterous making use of common phrases, in
writing to people of no extraordinary capacity then take, because of this, any
occasion to quarrel at, or cry down, that which is so useful and excellent:
And if in the opinion of men faithful and famous in their generation, he be
the best preacher to a people (and consequently writter too) Qui, quam maxim
trivialiter, pueriliter, populariter docet, as to words, and phrases; I see no
great reason such have to carpe, or necessity I have to make an Apology: But
their is sufficient to be said, if not for silencing of bablers, whose tongue
has more dimensions then their reason (which maks it not worth the while to
take notice of their barking) yet for satisfying of the more sober minded.
First, Consider that this disciple learned at his Master, both so to write and
speak, as not to hide his purpose in a cloud of new coined words: He consulted
his own reputation so little, while he sought his Master's honor, that he
would rather seem a Babbler to them, who minded nothing but words; then a
Barbarian to the meanest, who was taken with spiritual matter: If Christ's
example, who taught these high and heavenly mysteries of salvation, by plain
and obvious similitudes, be not sufficient to silence such persons, who have
habituat their tongue to drope satyrs against what is good, whether persons or
things; yet it is enough to guard against the prejudice of what they take
liberty to say. 2. Consider, that the most common word's and ordinary phrases,
in use amongst a people, may, by the greatest Orator, be very pertinently
used, for illustrating and pressing his purpose: Nay, in some cases, these have
a special emphasis, beyond what can be wrapped up, in a great many more count
words, and seemingly neat expressions, and then, they are so far from being a
blemish to a discourse, that they seem to give a kind of life, and add a
certain Iustre to the whole frame: and thou will find it often fall out here,
that the Author has so happy a dexterity in making the most common (and
sometimes contemptible-like) phrase, with a graceful sweetness, subservient to
his purpose, that let the greatest master of words, alter but one of these
words, or change one of these expressions (which if they stood not there might
almost seem a Barbarism) he marres what he undertook to mend, and while he
endeavors to co^ct the Author, he leaves himself to be put in amongst the
Errata. 3. Consider that a great many of the persons to whom he wrote, were no
scholars, nay, had so little acquaintance With that, which passes in the
world for elegancy of speech, that he had as good have said nothing at all to
them, as have made use of any other words then what are pitched upon, in
expressing his purpose; and so his design being to make affection, or to move
it in the hearts of these to whom he wrote, there was a necessity to suit his
style to their capacity; which condescension in him, is yet managed with so
much spiritual prudence and discretion, as it is without debasing high matter
or giving the least rational ground to mock at spiritual mysteries: Yea I may
say further, that there is so much majesty in the strain, as that the lowness
of the style is abundantly thereby made up: And further, I might ask thee, if
thou who maks the challenge do pretend to be a Master of reason, whether he
is the best Orator, who can with the least noise, cast fire into the
affections of these to whom he speaks or writs, and bring down the highest
mysteries in religion, to the capacity of the meanest hearer and reader, or he
who wraps up plain truths and obvious purposes, in such an obscurity of phrase,
and perplexing intricacy of words, as carries the matter quite beyond the reach
of a vulgar capacity: without making any other impression upon the mind of the
hearer, then that the man has forgotten his message, and while he seeks
himself, flights his Master's business: It often creats also a suspicion, that
the writter or speaker either desires not to be understood, or, while he
endeavors to sore too high above others, that is he has fallen into such a
confusion, as he knows not where to find himself? and if thou concede here,
what with reason thou can not deny, thou have granted all against thy self,
which I need seek, for putting thee to silence. 4. Consider, that though there
be some here written to, of the greatest quality in the Nation, and a great
many others, who are eminent for their understanding and parts, as well as their
grace; yet as these of the greatest quality and parts, may reap advantage, by
what has been written to the meanest and most obscure person; God in his
providence led his servant to speak to these of understanding and parts, so,
that what was particularly intended for them, might be of special use and
advantage to every one: And thus all occasion of carping is taken away; unless,
amongst the rest of the regularites of this time, Episcopal Authority be
interposed, to make us read and understand that axiom backward, bonum quo
communius eo melius, which if it be; I have no more to say, but that it is of a
piece with the rest of their Reformation. I suppose by this time; it may be
thought, I have said too much upon this head, since it would seem that
something ought rather to be said, for making many things in them plain that
are mysterious and dark; then to say so much for taking off prejudice, because
of some common words and expressions; but as to that, I shall not undertake it:
For there are many things in them, only intelligible by tasting: and he who
wants that commentary, will never understand this text. I have no more to say,
either for the one or the other, but if any dislike them, he may let them
alone; for I intend to obtrude them upon none, who distasts them; yet I cannot
for bear to advise even such, so far to consult their own reputation, as, by
speaking against what the Author has here written, not to discover that secret
to the world, that they are persons void of a gracious principle, to whom the
things that are of God are unsavory: The wind of thy mouth, though accompanied
with all the venom thou can vomit up, will not blast the Authors reputation,
it will only be a blazing of thy own shame, and then thou will see thy self so
unhappy, as to have hit the mark at which thou did not aim: For without
doing him any hurt, who is far above thy reach, thy tongue falls upon thy own
head, and in striking at one whom thou can not wound, thy sword rebounds back
upon thy self, and enters into thine own bowels; but if thou remainest a man
of imperswasion, and have so much pleasure in publishing thine own shame, I
cannot help it, it is sufficient for me, to have warned thee of thy hazard; nor
shall I endeavor hence forth to deprive the world of their liberty (since thou will have it so) to look upon thee, according to the character which thou have
given of thy self, and that is, Deest aliquid intus, to make the a man and a
Christian, and since this Brutish shape pleases thee, thou may go eat
grass and let alone this bread, which is only designed for Children? And so I
leave thee to make use of that liberty, of saying what thou pleases, which thou
have now purchased with the loss of thy own reputation.

If any think, it had been more convenient, to have concealed the names of
these to whom the Author wrote, for some reasons obvious, in regard of the
present Lamentable posture of affairs (when it is almost sufficent, to make a
man guilty, that ever he was really zealous for God) I have only this to say
for my self, that I designed their honor and not their prejudice nor hurt in
prefixing their names: Neither can I well imagine (what ever others may
apprehend) what prejudice they can sustain, by this; since none, or very few of
them, come from the Author, as returns to any thing they had written to him;
and there being no law, either discharging him to write, or any persons to
receive his letters, there can be no transgression upon their part, and so
nothing to ground a prejudice, or found a rational plea against them: And much
less in that their names are prefixed; or if there be any thing in this blame
worthy, I alone am in the transgression, who have done it without consulting
themselves, or asking their consent; yet in order to the satisfaction of any,
who may be offended at what is done, I have this to say for my self further,
that I was induced to it, first, that thereby it might appear these were indeed
the very Letters, which that faithful sufferer and witness of Jesus Christ
wrote (though there is sufficient in the style and strain to put this beyond
debat) and no forgeries 2. many of these worthy persons being removed (whereby
the Church of God is at a seen and sad loss, in that she is deprived of so
many, who would have weeped and made supplication on her behalf in this day of
her distress, when not a few of her friends have dealt treacherously with her,
and are become her enemies) their Posterity might think themselves wronged, if
I should have deprived their worthy Predecessors, by suppressing their names
and smothering their affection to the work of God, of the honor, of making
their faithfullness known to the world: And truly, I judged it the least that
was due, to the memory of these, who ought to be had in everlasting
remembrance, to erect this poor monument over their grave, whereby they may live
amongst the posterity, when they are gone, as persons who obtained mercy of the
Lord, to be faithful in their generation: and that when the account of such
comes to be taken, it may be said, this and that man was borne there. 3. I did
it to encourage the posterity of such, to be followers of the faith and
patience of their worthy proge^^tors, and that the may not, without shame and
horror think of declining, or turning aside, either to the right or left hand,
from the way of these dear relations, who by following the Lord fully, in an
evil time, left them a noble Pattern, worthy of imitation. 4. As for such who
are yet alive, I hope they will think, that God by this Providence, is making a
honorable mention of their fidelity before the nations, and is remembering for
them, the Love of their espousals, when they went after him; thereby to engage
them, to cleave more closely, and adhere more firmly to him, with full purpose
of heart when the generality have gadded about to change their way, and many of
his professed disciples have gone back, and are like to walk no more with him:
And upon the other hand, God will have this to be a witness before the world,
against any of them, who shall depart from the good way of the Lord, and be
offended in him, because of persecution: I hope what ever hazard threaten these
who abide in Christ's company, that they will never forsake him, nor give him
cause to say, what iniquity have ye found in me, that ye are gone far from me?
But if it should prove otherwise, they may be sure, that he whose soul has no
pleasure in any man that draws back, and hats the work of such as turn aside,
will count himself engaged in a peculiar way to lead them forth with the
workers of iniquity; but we hope for better things of them all, though we thus
speak: If none of these reasons which moved me to do this be strong enough
then let it be judged my weakness, for it is more fit, that I should pass in
the world as such (which is no great mistake) then these honorable and worthy
persons, should suffer any prejudice, by a deed whereto they had not the least
accession.

Reader, much pains has been taken, in collecting these together, that they
might be in the hands of many (a thing greatly desired of a long time by the
godly) which have been hitherto only in some broken and imperfect parcells, in
the hands of a few: Several of the most correct copies that could be had, have
been carefully compared, and many fruits thereby corrected, which were crept in,
by their being often transcribed, and that by unskillfull hands. If it fall out
so (as I suppose it shall not often be found) that they who have the Autographs
by them, perceive any difference in a word or sentence, betwixt this printed
copy and these, let them imput it to my want of he principals; for though I had
a good number of them, yet it was not possible for me to get the most part: In
some very few places also, to the end that this book might be of more
universal use, it may be, that a scottish word, which would have darkened the
sense, or rendered the sentence wholly unintelligble to strangers, is either
changed into some equivalent one, or a synonimous term inserted by it; but in
most places these words are retained, without any alteration; because either
alteration, or addition, would have made them less taking with, and acceptable
to them, for whom they were at first written, and to these for whom they are
now principally intended; because the life and emphasis of the Phrase, is often
found to lie, in that very word. But having kept thee under too long an arrest
in the entry, I leave thee now to peruse these profitable Epistles, which are
an account of the many sweet hours and comfortable soliloquies which that
eminent saint and sufferer had with God in the furnace of his affliction:
Wherein there is much to be seen, beyond the ordinary attainment of a
Christian, even who has made some remarkable progress, and is no small
proficient in the ways of God. I nothing doubt; but when thou perceivest,
while thou read, how much pure zeal to God, does burn in these lines, thou will Lament the lose of such a blessed instrument, now, when the Church of God
is brought so very low, and there are so few of all the sons whom she has
nourished and brought up, to take her by the hand. I grant it is both a
rational and religious sorrow; for when we remember the many eminent lights
(the removal of whom, has brought a sad and dark night upon the Church) which
did la^ly shine amongst us, and most say, they are gone who were our faithful
guids, it would almost seem pardonable, to abandon our selves to sorrow, and
refuse to be comforted: Quis ^alia fando tempere^ a lachrimis? Yet give me
leave to suggest these things (1) Let not the tear so blind thine eye, as not
to observe the goodness of God, who gave us such: It was a saying of an eminent
and excercised Christian (worthy to be remembered in this present case and to be
put upon record for posterity) perceiving many sorrowful, upon the removal, of
one of the most burning and shining lights, that Britain had to boast of (that
great Interpreter Mr Durhame I mean) turn your tears and sighs for this loss
(said that worthy person) though it seem to you almost irreeparable [an age
hardly producing such an other] into songs of praises, and do not so indulge
your sorrow, because the Master has called home an Ambassador, who did so
faithfully and successfully negotiat for him; as ye forget in the mean time to
praise the Lord of the harvest, who thrust forth such a labourer into his
vinyard: Let not the greatness of your grief, make you forget the riches of his
goodness to the Church of Christ in Scotland, in that there was a Mr Durhame to
die out of it: So I say, when in reading of these, thou remembers that the
worthy Author is gone to his rest; yet be not guilty of so much ingratitude,
through the excess of thy grief, as to froget God's care of, and kindness to
the Church of Scotland, who amongst others gave her a Mr Rutherfoord: one who
was not only famous at home and abroad for his great Learning; but such a
Minister of the Gospel, as I suppose, there is not a godly Minister in the
Nation, who knew his painfulness, his tenderness, his zeal, his shining, and
Gospel adorning Conversation, that will think he wrongs himself, in giving the
presence to him, whose watching and weeping and unwearied pains, to propagate
the truth, and profit the souls of men, made him without a match or equal and
Left deep convictions of shortcoming, even upon them, who may with a rational
confidence, expect the approbation of well done good and faithful servants, at
the day of their appearance, and die in the faith of this, that when the great
shepherd shall appear, they shall receive a crown of glory, that fades not
away. (2) If no other consideration can d^y up thy tears, or divert thy sorrow,
while thou do remember thy own and the Churches loss; yet remember that this
is sufficient to make the mourn in hope; that the resid^e of the spirit is
with him. We cannot I grant weep back again (though it is like some would be
content to weep themselves blind, if that were lawful and would do it) our
famous and faithful Knoxes, Davidsons, Welshes, Bruces, Hendersons,
Rutherfoords, Gil^spies, Guthries, with a great many (...) sids, of their
brethren and companions, who did build and fight with them, and were the
restorers of the breaches amongst us; whereby they obtained a good report, and
are at this day of blessed memory indeed; but is there no hope to see them
alive in other men's persons? I grant their is but little appearance of that,
for the present: For Alas may we say, where is the^e a man of that spirit to be
found? Yet let us not add this to all the rest of our provocations in this
wilderness-lot, to limit the holy one of Israel; since these had nothing but
what they did receive; he can furnish the Church with men of the same parts and
zeal: With men who will shine in light, so, that their enemies must lay their
hand upon their mouth when they have spoken; and burn in love to God and his
interests: and truly it concerns all the people of God, to be much in
importuning him, that he would again give us such standard bearers, and that
that he would remember us now, in our low estate, by raising up such, who may
be as the Charets and horsemen of Israel, when the spirit of most is under such
a faint, and the men of might do not find their hands: If we were up and
doing in this, which is one great part of our work in such a sad time, and gave
him no rest, who knows, but he would yet breath upon many, who are now as dry
bones, without life or motion, and make them stand up for him and plead his
cause against them, who have lifted up their head against heaven, and their
heel against his people? They who by falling asleep, till their hair was cut,
that they were not in case to shake themselves as at other times, when their
enemies were upon them, might yet spil their adversaries sport, and bring down
their Babel about their ears, if the spirit of the Lord came upon them as at
othertimes: Or if this were not to be expected, he could raise up a generation,
who would serve him with more zeal and faithfulness, then we have done, and
that in such a number, as should make his Church say, who has begotten me all
these? And where have they been? It my be that he who waits to be gracious, is
waiting to be en^ated to do this good thing for us: Surely if we were a people
of prayer, and particularly for this Church and Nation-mercy, we might be
surprised now, when we have scarce a tokenn for good, and when our lukwarme
temper has banished the faith of such a mercy almost out of the earth, with
such a re^ur^^ a^ that, I will clothethy Priests with salvation, and thy sai^s
^all yet shout aloud for joy: I will pour down such a plentiful the ^sure of
the spirit upon them, that by their zeal and faithfulness, the years which thi^
cankerworme and caterpillar of luke warness has eaten up, shall be restored
unto you seven fold; which would carry along with it, the accomplishment of
that other great and Gospel promise, his enemies will I clothe with shame; but
upon himself shall his crown flourish. Faxit Deus, and ^es^^ness should be the
constant Echo of our hearts.

Reader there is one thing more I have to acquaint thee with, and so I have
done, and that is to tell thee, that I have made bold for this once, to send
these Epistles abroad into the world, without the Prelat's Imprimatur: If he
please to take this for an Apology, that the Author sought not his permission
to write them, which emboldned me to transmit them to thy hands, without his
approbation, he may; for I am not in an humor to give him any other account of
this action. I know it is very probable, that the fat of these may be the fire;
for our late fulious Prelates (that Draco volans which being got upon the wing
spouts down fire upon the Church, whereby the Tabernacles of God are burnt up
through the land: For the appearance of this fiery meteor did always portend
somewhat fatal to the Church to follow upon it) are a little more hot then
their predecessors: It Is true, these went so high in their persecution, and
drove so hard, that it was thought scarce possible, for any to out-doe them in
persecuting, for they run them selves out of breath, and never drew bridle till
they fell in the ditch, and we thought they had died their without succession;
but Alas! The Church finds this day, that (...) respect of their successors,
they were mere novices, and had scarce served their Aprentiship in the blake
Art: And this puts me to think whether the people of God should not rather
submit to be chastised even with this scourge of scorpions; then to wish that
he would throw the ^od in the fire, lest if they were gone, and we not fit for
a delivery [as indeed we are not] it should fall out with us, according to the
story of the old wife of Syracuse, who was afraid of Dyon sius his death, lest
the devil should succeed him: but if any should say to me, what and if be
already come? For if the Holy Ghost call these men such Rev. 2: 10. Who did
But cast in prison, and did but cast some in prison, may he not be said to be
already come down now having great wrath; when deposition, imprisonment,
banishment, yea any thing less, then declared worthy to die, is thought a
savor: If any should urge me with this, I say, I confess he would pose me into
an absolut silence; or force an acknowledgment from me: If the Prelates
themselves who are of age, be in case to make a reply, let them answer it: For
the truth is, they are so hot upon their work, that if it be a heresy to think
so of them, they who plead the necessity of their office, for preventing of
schism and heresy, are like to turn the better part of the world heretics;
but to my purpose I say, their is some reason to fear; that this be thought
very sit fuel, to make a fire in Cajapcas his hall: However, though it should
be so, yet this is not the first time, that some of the worthy Author's works,
have got such entertainment: and truly their is so much zeal to the interests
of Christ, so much love to God, and the salvation of men, burning in these
lines; that, that spirit, whose element is fire, will endeavor to blow the
bellows, and seek this as a sacrifice at their hands, whose once professed
sincerity, and personat zeal for God and his interests, is now broken out, in
such high Acts of rebellion against him, and hatred against his servants;
whereby the proverb is become plain Scottish, or Inglish, or both if ye will:
Omnis Apostata secta suae Osor: But if the Prelates would take a poor
Presbyter's advice, they wou^ even let it alone, lest the smoke of that fire,
wherein they burn this; kindle a flame of just indignation against them, in
the hearts of all the lovers of God, as men who have a very perfect hatred
against piety; but if they care not to be so looked upon, I have no more to
say, be it so: It Is like nothing that I can say, will hinder them, from
puttingh this piece in his hands, to whom, as I hear, they have committed the
revising of learned and worthy Mr. Wood's Testimony, etc. and who it seems, is
made choice of by them, as Secretary in Chief, for fevising all such pieces, to
^i^, Ioannes Dunmuraeus, cum Fratri^^^^, and Collegis suis: And therefore I
must leave them to their own liberty, which I only do, because I cannot help
it: and I am afraid besides, lest if I should work too hard, in carrying water
to cool them, I over-heat my self, and leave them at last nothing, cooler then
I found them: But as for thee Christian Reader; it will be a sufficent
imprimatur, to tell thee, that these are MR. RUTHERFOORD'S LETTERS: Wherein he
gives thee an account, of many a good day, and joyful hour, he had in his
Master's company; while his fellow servants did beat and thrust him out of the
vineyard: and he invits thee to take a share of his feast, and truly I wish
that both of us would go try and taste, since neither of us are like to have
very good entertainment any where else.

I have but one word more to say, for I know it is long since thou expected I
should have made an end, and it is only to crave the pardon that I have not
done it sooner: when I wrote the first nes. I thought to have made the end and
the beginning so contiguous, that I should neither have put thee to this
trouble, nor my self to the necessity of an Apology; and in order to that, I
did really forbear what (as I told thee) at first I intended, and am carried
this length besides my design; but if the length of what is here offend thee,
thou art in case without doing me any wrong, to give thy self the same
satisfaction, as if I had said nothing, by passing it, as so much waste paper,
and turning over to the Epistles themselves: If thy soul be profited by these
(as I hope it shall) I have my design, and all I seek of the be side, is, that
thou would wish his soul's welfare, who was at this little pains, in order
to thine, and who desires to be reockened by thee, amongst the meanest and most
unworthy of.

The favorers of the dust of Zion, And thy Well^^^kers.

To Mr ROBERT CUNYNGAME, Minister of the Gospel at Holywood in Ireland. (Epist.
1.)
WElbeloved and reverend Brother, grace mercy and peace be to you; upon
acquaintance in Christ, I thought good to take the opportunity of writing to
you; seeing it has seemed good to the Lord of the harvest, to take the hooks
out of our hands for a time, and to lay upon us a more honorable service, even
to suffer for his name. It were good to comfort one another in writing: I have
had a Desire to see you in the face, yet now being the prisoner of Christ it is
taken away: I am greatly comforted to hear of your soldiers stately spirit,
for your princely and royal Captain Jesus our Lord, and for the grace of god
in the rest of our dear brethren with you; you have heard of my trouble I
suppose, It has pleased our sweet Lord Jesus, to let loose the malice of these
interdicted Lords in his house to deprive me of my Ministry at Anwoth and to
confine me, eight score miles from thence to Aberden; and also (which was not
done to any before) to inhibit me to speak at all in Jesus his name, within
this Kingdom, under the pain of rebellion: The cause that ripened their
hatred was my book against the Arminians, whereof they accused me, these three
Days I appeared before them; But let our crowned king in Zion reign, by his
grace the loss is theirs, the advantage is Christ's and truths; albeit this
honest cross gained some ground on me; by my heavniesse, and inward Challenges
of conscience for a time were sharp, yet now for the incouragment of you all,
I dare say it, and write it under my hand, welcome, welcome, sweet, svveet,
Cross, of Christ: I verily think the Chains of my Lord Jesus are all overlaid
with pure gold, and that his cross is perfumed, and that it smells of
Christ, and that the Victory, shall be by the blood of the lamb, and by the
word of his truth, and that Christ laying on his back, in his weak servants,
and oppressed truth, shall ride over his enemies bellies, and shall stricke
through Kings in the day of his wrath: It is time we laughe when he laugheth,
and seeing he is now pleased to sit with wrongs for a time, it becomes us to
be silent, until the Lord has let the enemies enjoy their hungerie, lean,
and fecklesse paradise: Blessed are they who are content to take stroks with
weeping Christ, faith will trust the Lord, and is not hasty, nor head strong;
neither is faith so timorous as to flatter a tentation, or to bud and bribe the
cross, It is little up or little down that the lamb and his followers can get
no lavv-suitie, nor truce with crosses; it must be so, till we be up in our
fathers house; my heart is woe indeed for my mother Church, that has played the
harlot with many lovers, her husband has a mind to sell her for her horrible
transgressions, and heavy will the hand of the Lord be upon this backsliding
nation. The ways of our Zion mourn, her gold is become dim, her white
Nazarites are blck like a coal, how shall not the Children weep, when the
husband and the mother can not agree; yet I believe Scotlands sky shall clear
again, and that Christ shall build again, the old wast places of Jacob, and
that our dead and dry bones, shall become ane army of living men, and that, our
beloved may yet feed among the lillies, until the day break and the shaddows
flee away. My dear brother let us help one another with our prayers, Our king
shall mowedown his enemies, and shall come from Bozra, with his garments all
died in blood, and for our onsolation shall he appear, and call his wife
Hephzibah, and his land Beulah; for he will rejoice over us and marie us, and
Scotland shall say what have I to do any more with Idols? Only let us be
faithful to him that can ride through hell, and death, upon a windlestrae, and
his horse never stumble, and let him make of me a bridge over a water so that
his high and holy name may be glorified in me: stroks with the sweet mediators
hand, are very sweet, he was always sweet to my soul, but since I suffered for
him, his breath has a sweeter smell then before, Oh that every hair of my
head, and every member, and every bone in my body, were a man to witness a
fair confession for him, I would think all too little for him, when I look over
beyond the line, and beyond death to the laughing side of the world, I trimmph,
and ride upon the high places of Jacob, howbeit otherways I am a faint
dead-hearted cowardly man; often borne down, and hungry in waiting for the
mariage-supper of the lamb; nevertheless I think it the Lords wise love that
feeds us with hunger, and makes us fat with wants, and desertions: I know not
my dear brother if our worthy brethren, be gone to sea, or not, they are on my
heart and in my prayers, if they be yet with you, salute my dear friend John
Stuart, my weilbeloved brethren in the Lord, Mr Blair, Mr Hamilton, Mr
Livingston, and Mr Mak-Cleland, and acquaint them with my troubles, and entreat
them to pray for the poor afflicted prisoner of Christ, They are dear to my
soul: I seek your prayers and theirs for my flock, their remembrance breaks my
heart: I desire to love that people, and others my dear acquantance in Christ
with love in God, and as God loves them; I know that he who sent me to the
west, and south, sends me also to the north: I will Charge my soul to believe
and to wait for him, and will follow his providence and not go before it, nor
stay behind it. Now my dear brother taking farewell in paper, I commend you
all to the word of his grace, and to the work of his spirit, to him who holds
the seven stars in his right hand, that you may be keept spotless till the day
of Jesus our Lord. I am.

From Irwing being on my Journey to Christ's palace in Aberden August 4. 1636.
Your Brother in affliction in our sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To his Parochiners. (2)
DEarly beloved, and longed for in the Lord, my crown and my joy in the day of
Christ: Grace be to you, and peace, from God our father, and our Lord Jesus
Christ. I long exceedingly to know, if the oft-spoken-of match betwixt you and
Christ holds; and if you follow on to know the Lord. My day thoughts, and my
night thoughts are of you, while ye sleep, I am afraid of your souls that they
be off the rock: next to my Lord Jesus, and this fallen kirk, ye have the
greaest share of my sorrow, and also of my joy; ye are the matter of the tears,
care, fear, and daily prayers of an oppressed prisoner of Christ: as I am in
bonds for my high and lofty one, my Royal and princely master, my Lord Jesus;
so I am in bonds for you, for I should have sleeped in my warm nest, and kept,
the fat world in my arms, and the cords of my tabernacle should have been
fastened more strongly, I might have sung an Evangel of Ease to my soul and you
for a time, with my brethren, the sons of my mother, that were angry at me, and
have thrust me out of the vineyard, if I should have been broken and drawn on
to mire you the Lords flock; and to cause you eat pastures trodden upon with
men's feet, and to drink foul and muddie waters: But truly the almighty was a
rerror to me, and his fear made me afraid. O my Lord judge if my ministry be
not dear to me, but not so dear by many degrees, as Christ Jesus my Lord: God
knows the heavy, and sad Sabbaths I have bad since I laid down at my Masters
feet my two shepherds staves, I have been often saying as it is written, Lam. 3:
52. my enemies chased me sore like a bird without cause, they have cut off my
life in the dungeon and cast a stone upon me: for next to Christ, I had but one
joy, the apple of the eye of my delights, to preach Christ my Lord, and they
have violently plucked that away from me, and it was to me like the poor man's
one eye, and they have put out that eye, and quenched my light in the
inheritance of the Lord; but my eye is toward the Lord; I know I shall see the
salvation of God, and that my hope shall not always be forgotten; And my
sorrow shall want nothing to complete it, and to make me say, what avails it
me to live? if ye follow the voice of a stranger, of one that comes in to the
sheepfold not by Christ the door, but climbeth up another way, if the man build
his hay and stuble upon the golden foundation, Christ Jesus already laid among
you, and ye follow him, I assure you the man's work shall burn and never bide
Gods fire, and ye and he both shall be in danger of everlasting burning, except
ye repent. O if any pain, any sorrow, any loss that I can suffer for Christ,
and for you were laid in pledge to buy Christ's love to you, and that I could
lay my dearest joys, next to Christ my Lord in the gap, betwixt you and
eternal destruction! O if I had paper as broad as heaven and earth, and ink
as the sea, and all the rivers and fountains of the earth, and were able to
write the love, the worth, the excellency, the Sweetness, and due praises of
our dearest, and fairest welbeloved; and then if ye could read and understand
it! what could I want if my ministry among you, should make a marriage between
the little bride in that bounds, and the bridegroom? O how rich a prisoner were
I, if I could obtain of my Lord (before whom I stand for you) the salvation of
you all! O What a prey had I gotten to have you catched in Christ's net! O then
I had cast out my Lords lines and his net with a rich gain! O then wel-wared
pained breast and sore back, and a crased body, in speaking early and late to
you! my witness is above, your heaven would be two heavens to me, and the
salvation of you all, as two salvations to me, I would subscribe a suspension,
and a fristing of my heaven, for many hundred years, (according to Gods good
pleasure) if ye were sure in the upper lodging, in our fathers house before me.
I take to witness heaven and earth against you, I take instruments in the
hands of that sun, and day light, that beheld us, and in the hands of the
timber and walls of that kirk, if I drew not up a fair contract of marriage
betwixt you and Christ, if I went not with offers betwixt the bridegroom, and
you, and your conscience did bear you witness, your mouths confessed, that
there were, many fair trysts, and meetings drawn on, betwixt Christ and you, at
communion-feasts, and other occasions; there were braclets, jewels, rings, and
loveletters, sent to you, by the bridegroom, it was told you what a fair dowry
ye should have, and what a house your husband and ye should dwell in, and what
was the bridgroomes excellency, Sweetness, might, Power. The Eternity, and
glory of his Kingdom, the exceeding deepnesse of his love, who sought his
black wife through pain, fires, shame, death, and the grave; and swimmed the
salt sea for her, undergoeing the curse of the law, and then was made a curse
for you, and ye then consented and said, Even so I take him: I counsel you
beware of the new and strange leaven of men's inventions, beside, and against
the word of God, contrair to the oath of this kirk. now comeing among you: I
instructed you of the superstition, and Idolatry, of kneeling in the instant of
receiving the Lords supper, and crosseing in baptism, and the observing of
men's days, without any vvarrant of Christ our perfect lawgiver: Countenance
not the Surplice the attire of the Mass^ priest, the garment of Baals priests,
the abominable bowing to altars of tree is comeing upon you: hate and keep
your selves from idols: forbear in any case to hear the reading of the new
fatherless service book, full of gross heresees, popish and superstitious
errors, without any vvarrant of Christ, tending to the overthrow of
preaching: you ovv no obedience to the bastard Canons, they are unlawful,
blasphemous and superstitious; all the ceremonies that lie in the Antichrists
foul womb, the vvares of that great mother of fornications, the kirk of Rome,
are to be refused, ye see vvhither they lead you: Continue still in the
Doctrine, which ye have recieved; ye heard of me the whole counsel of God,
so we no cl^^ts upon Christ's robe, take Christ in his rags, and losses and as
persecuted by men, and be content to sigh, and pant up the mountain, with
Christ's cross on your back, let me be repute a false prophet (and your
conscience once said the contrair) if your Lord Jesus shall not stand by you,
and mantaine you, and mantaine your cause, aganst your enemies: I have heard,
(and my soul is greived for it) that since my departure from you, many among
you are turned back from the good old way to the dogs vomit again; let me
speak to these men, it was not without Gods special direction, that the
first sentence that ever my mouth uttered to you, was that of John Chap. 9:
39. And Jesus said for judgment came I into the world that they which see not
might see, and they which see might be made blind. It is possible, my first
meeting and yours be, when we shall both stand before the dreadful judge of
the World, and in the name and authority of the Son of God, my great King and
Master, I write by these presents, summonds to these men, I arrest their souls
and bodies to the day of our compearance; their eternal damnation stands
subscribed, and sealed in heaven; by the hand-write of the great Judge of quick
and dead, and I am ready to stand up, as a preaching witness against such to
their face, that day, and to say, Amen to their condemnation, except they
repent: The vengeance of the Gospel is heavier, nor the vengeance of the law,
the Mediators malediction and vengeance, is twice vengance, and that vengeance
is the due portion of such men, and there I leave them, as bound men, ay and
while they repent and amend: You were vvitnesses how the Lords day was
spent, while I was among you: O sacrilegious robber of Gods day, what will
thou answer the Almighty, when he seeks so many Sabbaths back again, from
thee? What will the Curser, Svvearer, and Blasphemer do, when his tongue
shall be roasted in that broad, and burning lake of fire and brimstone? And what
will the drunkard do, when tongue, lights, and liver, bones, and all, shall
boil and frye in a torturing fire for he shall be far from his barrels of
strong drink then, and there is not a cold well of water for him in hell?
What shall be the case of the wretch, the covetous man? the opperssor? the
deceaver? the earth worm, who can never get his vvombfull of clay, when in the
day of Christ, Gold and Silver must lie burnt in ashes, and he must compear and
answer his judge, and quite his clayie and naughty heaven? woe, woe, for ever
more be, to the time-turning Atheist, that has one God, and one religion for
summer, and another God, and another religion, for winter, and the day
offanning; when Christ fanneth all that is in his barn floor, who has a
conscience for every fair and market, and the soul of him runs upon these
oiled wheels, Time, Custom, the world and Command of men: O if the careless
Atheist, and sleeping man, who edgeth by all, (with, God forgive our Pastors if
they lead us wrong, we must do as they command,) and lays down his head upon
times bosom, and gives his conscience to a deputy, and sleeps so, while the
smoke of hell fire fly up in his throat, and cause him start out of his
dooleful bed. O if such a man would awake, many woes are for the over-guilded,
and gold-plastered Hypocrite, a heavy doom is for the liar and white tongued
flatterer, and the fleing book of Gods irefull vengeance, twenty cubits long,
and twenty cubits broad, that goes out from the face of God, shall enter into
the house, and in upon the soul of him that steals, and swears falsely by
Gods name, Zechar. 5: ver. 23. I denounce eternal burning, hotter then Sodoms
flames, upon the men, that boil in their filthy lusts of fornication,
adultery, incest, and the like wickedness; no Room, no not a footbroad for
such viledogs, within the clean Jerusalem: Many of you put off all with this,
God forgive us, we know no better: I renew my old answer, 2 Thessalonians. 1. the judge
is coming in flaming fire, with all his mighty Angels to render vengeance to
all these, that know not God, and believe Not. I have often told you security
shall slay you, all men say they have faith, as many men and women now, as many
saints in heaven; and all believe (say ye) every foul dog is clean enough, and
good enough, for the clean and new Jerusalem above: Every man has conversion,
and the new birth; but it is not ^^el come; they had never a sick night for
sin, conversion came to them in a night dream: in a word hell will be empty at
the day of judgment, and heaven panged full: Alace it is neither easy, nor
ordinary to believe and to be saved; many must stand in the end at heavens
gates; when they go to take out their faith they take out a fair nothing (or
as ye use to speak) a bl^^^ume: O lamentable Disappointment: I pray you, I
charge you in the name of Christ, make fast work of Christ, and salvation: I
know there are some believers among you; and I write to you O poor broken
hearted believers, all the comforts of Christ, in the New and Old Testament are
yours. O what a father and husband you have! O if I had pen, and ink, and
ingine, to write of him! Let heaven and earth be consolidat, in massy and pure
gold, it will not weigh the thousand part of Christ's love to a soul, even to me
a poor prisoner; O that is a massy and mavelous love! Men and Angels unit
your force, and strength in one; ye shall not heave, nor poise it off the
ground: Ten thousand thousand worlds, as many worlds, as Angels can number, and
then as a new world of Angels can multiply, would not all be the balk of a
balance, to weigh Christ's excellency, sweetness, and love; Put ten earth's
in one, and let a rose grow greater then ten whole earths, or ten worlds, O
what beauty would be in it, and what a smell would it cast! but a blast of the
breath of that fairest rose in all Gods Paradise, even of Christ Jesus our
Lord, one look of that fairest face, would be infinitely in beauty, and smell
above all imaginable, and created glory. I wonder that men dow bide off Christ,
I would esteem my self blessed if I could make an open proclamation, and gather
all the world, that are living upon the earth, Jew, and Gentile, and all that
shall be borne, to the blowing of the last trumpet, to flock round about
Christ, and to stand looking, wondering, admiring, and adoring his beauty, and
sweetness; for his fire is hotter then any other fire, his love sweeter then
common love, his beauty surpasses all other beauty: When I am heavy and sad,
one of his love-looks, would do me meekel worlds good, o if ye would fall in
love with him! How blessed were I, how glad would my soul be, to help you to
love him, but amongst us all we could not love him enough, he is the Son of the
Fathers love, and Gods delight, the Fathers love lies all upon him, o if all
mankind would fetch all their love, and lay it upon him, invit him, and take
him home to your houses, in the exercise of prayer, morning, and evening, as I
often desired you; especially now, let him not want lodgeing in your houses,
nor lie in the feilds, when he is shut out of pulpits, and Kirks: If ye will be
content to take heaven by violence, and the wind on your face for Christ and
his cross, I am here one, who has some trial of Christ's cross, I can say,
that Christ was ever kind to me, but he overcomes himself (if I may speak so)
in kindness while I suffer for him, I give you my word for it, Christ's cross
is not so evil as they call it, it is sweet, light, and comfortable, I would
not want the visitations of love, and the very breathings of Christ's mouth,
when he kisseth, and my Lords delightsome smiles, and love-embracements, under
my sufferings for him, for a mountain of fine gold, nor for all the honors,
court, and grandour of velvet-kirk-men: Christ has the yolke and heart of my
love, I am my beloveds, and my welbeloved is mine. O that ye were all
handfasted to Christ! o my Dearly beloved in the Lord, I would I could change
my voice, and had a tongue tuned with the hand of my Lord, and had the art of
speaking of Christ, that I might paint out unto you, the worth, and highness,
and greatness, and excellency, of that fairest, and renowned bridegroom! I
beseech you by the mercies of the Lord, by the sighs, tears, and heart blood,
of our Lord Jesus, by the salvation of your poor and precious souls, set up the
mountain, that ye and I may meet before the Lambs throne, amongst the
congregation of the first borne: Lord grant, that, that may be the trysting
place, that ye and I may put up our hands together, and pluck, and eat the
apples, o^ the tree of life, and we may feast together, and drink together, of
that pure river of the water of life, that comes out from under the throne of
God, and from the Lamb: O how little is your hand-breadth, and span length of
days here, your inch of time is Less, then when ye and I parted, eternity,
eternity, is comeing posting on with wings, then shall every man's black's, and
whit's; be brought to light. O how low will your thoughts be of this
fair-skined but heart roten apple, the vain, vain, fecklesse world, when the
worms shall make their houses, in your eye holes, and shall eat a^^ the flesh,
from the ball of your cheeks, and shall make that body a number of dry bones!
think not the common gate of serving God, as neighbor and others do, will
bring you to heaven; few, few are saved, the Devils court, is thick and many,
he haththe greatest number of mankind for his vassels: I know this world is a
great forest of thorns in your way to heaven, but ye most through it,
acquaint your selves with the Lord, hold fast Christ, hear his voice only,
bless his name, sanctify and keep his day, keep the new commandment, love one
another, let the Holy Spirit dwell in your bodies, and be clean and holy, love
not the worldly not, love, and follow truth, learn to know God, keep in mind
what I taught you, for God will seek ane account of it, when I am far from you:
abstain from all evil and all appearance of evil, follow good carefully and
seek peace; and follow after it honor your King, and pray for him; remember me
to God in your prayers, I dow not forget you; I told you often, while I was
with you, and now I write it again, heavy, sad, and sore, is that strok of the
Lords wrath, that is comeing upon Scotland, woe, woe, woe, to this Harlotland,
for they shall take the cup of Gods wrath, from his hand, and drink, and spue,
and fall, and net rise again. In, In, In, with speed, to your strong hold, ye
prisoners of hope, and hide you there, while the anger of the Lord pass;
Follow not the Pastors of this Land, for the sun is gone down upon them; as the
Lord lives they lead you from Christ, and from the good old way, yet the Lord
will keep the holy City, and make this withered Kirk, to bud again like a
rose, and a field blessed of the Lord. The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be
with you all. The prayers and blessing of a prisoner of Christ's in bonds for
him, and for you, be with you all,

AMEN.
Aberden, July 14. 1637. Your Lawful and loving Pastor, S. R.

To the Honorable, Reverend, and Welbeloved Professors of Christ, and his
Truth in sincerity in Ireland. (3)
DEarly beloved in our Lord, and partakers of the heavenly calling, Grace,
mercy and peace be to you, from God our father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ:
I always but most of all now in my bonds (most sweet bonds for Christ my Lord)
rejoice, to hear of your faith, and love, and to hear that our King, our
welbeloved, our bridegroom, without tireing, stays still to woo you, as his
wife; and that persecutions, and mockings of sinners have not chased away the
wooer from the house, I persuade you in the Lord, the men of God now Scattered,
and driven from you; put you upon the right sent and pursuit of Christ, and my
salvation on it (if ten heavens were mine) if this way, this way that I now
suffer for, this way that the world nicknameth, and reproacheth, and no other
way, be not the Kings gate to heaven; and I shall never see Gods face (and
alace I were a beguiled wretch if it were so) if this be not the only saving
way to heaven. Oh that you would take a prisoner of Christ's word for it, nay I
know you have the greatest Kings word for it, that it shall not be your wisdom
to spier out another Christ, another way of worshipping him, then is now
savingly revealed to you. Therefore though I never saw your faces let me be
pardoned to write to you ye honorable persons, ye faithful Pastors yet
amongst the flocks, and ye sincere professors of Christ's truth, or any weak
tired strayers who cast but half an eye after the bridegroom; if possibly I
could by any weak experience, confirm and strengthen you, in this good way
every where spoken against. I can with greatest assurance (to the honor of our
highest, and greatest and dearest Lord let it be spoken) assert, (though I be
but a child in Christ, and scarce able to walk, but by a hold, and the meanest
and less then the least of Saints) that we do not come nigh, by twenty
degrees, to the due love and estimation of that fairest among the sons of men;
for if it were possible that heaven yea ten heavens, were laid in the balance
with Christ, I would think the smell of his breath, above them all: sure I am
he is the far best half of heaven, yea he is all heaven, and more then all
heaven; and my testimony of him is, that ten lives of black sorrow, ten
deaths, ten hells of pain, ten furnaces of brimstone, and all exquisit
torments; were all too little for Christ, if our suffering could be a hire to
buy him: and therefore faint not in your sufferings, and hasards for him, I
proclaim and cry hell, sorrow, and shame upon all lusts, upon all by-lovers,
that would take Christ's room over his head in this little inch of love, of
these narrow souls of ours that is due to sweetest Jesus. O highest, O fairest,
O dearest Lord Jesus, take thine own from all bastard lovers! O that we could
wodset, and sell all our part of times glory and times good things, for a
lease, and tack of Christ for all eternity! O how are we misted, and mired
with the love of things that are in this side of time and in this side of
deaths water! where can we find a match to Christ, or an equal or a better
then he among created things? Oh this world is out of all conceit, and all love
with our welbeloved. O that I could sell my laughter, joy, ease, and all for
him; and be content of a straw-bed, and btead by weight, and water by measure,
in the camp of our weeping Christ! I know his sackcloth and ashes, are better,
then the fools laughter which is like the crackling of thorns under a pot. But
alace we do not harden our faces against the cold north storms, which blow
upon Christ's fair face, we love well summer religion, and to be that which Sin
has made us, even as thin skinned, as if we were made of white paper, and
would fain be carried to heaven in a cl^sse covered chariot, wishing from our
hearts, that Christ would give us surety, and his hand write, and his seal,
for nothing but a fair summer, until we be landed, in at heavens gates; how
many of us have been here deceived, and fainted, in the day of trial; amongst
you there are some of this Stamp, I shall be sorry if my acquantance A. T.
has left you, I will not believe he dare stay from Christ's side, I desire
that ye show him this from me, for I loved him once in Christ, neither can I
change my mind, suddenly of him. But the truth is that many both of you, and
too many also of your neighbor church of Scotland, have been like a rennent
that sits mealfree, and knovveth not his holding while his rights be
questioned, and now I am persuaded, it vvil be asked at every one of us, on
what terms we brook Christ, for we have sitten long meal-free, we found
Christ without a vvett foot, and He, and his gospel, came upon small charges
to our Doors, but now we must wet our feet to seek him: our evil manners; and
the bad fashions of a people at ease from our youth, and like Moab not casten
from vessel, to vessel, Jer. 48: 11. hes made us like standing waters, to
gather a foul scumme, and when we are jumbled, our dregs come up, and are seen,
many take but half a grip of Christ, and the wind blows them and Christ
asunder; indeed when the mast is broken, and blown in the sea, it is ane art
then to swim upon Christ, to dry land: 't is even possible that the children
of God in a hard trial, lay them selves down, as hidden in the lea-side of a
bush, while Christ their master be taken; as Peter did; and lurk there; while
the storm be overpast: all of us know the way to a whole skin, and the
singlest heart that is, has a by-purse; that will contian the denial of
Christ, and a fear^ull backslding. O how rare a thing is it, to be loyal, and
honest to Christ, when he has a controversy vvth the sheelds of the earth, I
vvish all of you, would consider, that this trial is from Christ, it is come
upon you unbought (indeed when we buy a tentation with our own money, no marvel
that we be not easily free of it, and that God be not at our elbow to take it
off our hand) this is Christ's ordinary house-fire that he maks use of, to try
all the vessels of his house Withal, and Christ now is about to bring his
treasure out before sun and moon, and to tell his money, and in the telling, to
try what weight of gold, and what weight of watered copper is in his house:
Do not now jouke, or bovv, or yield to your adversaries in a hairbreadth;
Christ and his truth will not divide, and his truth has not latitude and
breadth, that ye may take some of it, and leave other some of it, nay the
gospel is like a small hair, that has no breadth and vvil not cleave in two,
it is not possible to tryste and compound a matter betwixt Christ and
Antichrist, and therefore ye must either be for Christ, or ye must be against
him; It was but man's wit, and the wit of Prelates, and their god father the
Pope (that man without law) to put Christ, and his prerogatives royal, and his
truth or the smallest nail-breadth of his latter vvil, in the new calendar of
Indifferencies, and to make a blank, of un-inked paper in Christ's Testament,
that men may fill up, and so shufle the truth, and matters they call indifferent
thorovv other, and spin both together that the Antichrists vvares may sell the
better, this is but the device and forged dream of men, whose consciences are
made of stoutnesse, and have a throat that a graven image, greater then the
bounds of the Kirk door, would give free passage unto; I am sure when Christ
shall bring us all out in our black's, and vvhit's, at that day when he shall
cry down time, and the world, and when the glory of it shall lie in white
ashes, like a may flower cut down and having lost the blosome, there shall be
few yea non that dare make any point that touches the worship and honor of
our king and lawgiver, to be indifferent; O that this mislead and blindfolded
world, would see, that Christ does not rise and fall, stand or lie, by men's
apprehensions; what is Christ the lighter, that men do with him by open
proclamation, as men do with clipped and light money; they are now crying down
Christ some grain weights, and some pounds or shillings, and they will have him
lie for a penny or a pound, for one, or for ane hundredth, according as the wind
blows from the east, or from the west; but the Lord hes weighed him, and
balanced him already, This is my welbeloved Son in whom I am well pleased ^ear
ye him, his worth, and his weight stands still; It is our part to cry up, up
with Christ, and down, down with all created glory before him. O that I could
highten him, and highten his name, and highten his throne! I know, and am
persuaded, that Christ shall again be high, and great in this poor withered,
and sunburnt Kirk of Scotland, and that the sparks of our fire, shall flee over
sea, and round about, to warm you, and other sister-churches, and that this
tabernacle of David's house that is fa^len, even the Son of David his waste
places shall be built again, and I know the prison, crosses, persecutions, and
trials of the two slain witnesses, that are now dead, and buried Rev. 11. and
of the faithful professors have a backdoor and back entry of escape, and
that death and hell, and the world and tortures, shall all cleave, and split
in tvvain, and give us free passage and liberty to go through them toll-free,
and we shall bring all Gods good metal out of the furnace again, and leave
behind us but our dross, and our scumme: we may then before hand proclaim
Christ to be victorious, He is crowned King in mount Sion, God did put the
crown upon his head, Psalm. 2. And who dare take it off again? out of question
he has sore and grievous quarrels against his church, and therefore, He is
called, Is. 39. 10. He whose fire is in Sion and whose furnace is in Jerusalem.
But when he has performed his work on mount Sion, all Sions haters shall be as
the hungry, and thirsty man, that dreams he is eating and drinking, and behold
when he awaketh he is faint, and his soul empty: and this advantage we have
also, that he will not bring before sun, and moon, all the infirmities of his
wife; it is the modesty of marriage-anger, or husband-wrath, that our sweet
Lord Jesus will not come with chiding to the streets, to let all the world hear
what is betwixt him, and us; his sweet gloomes stay under roof, and that
because he is God. Two special things ye are to mind. 1. Try and make sure
your profession; that ye carry not empty lamps: alace security, security is the
bane, and the wrack of the most part of the world! Oh how many professors go
with a golden luster, and gold-like before men, (who are but witnesses to our
white skin) and yet are but bastard and base metal: consider how fair before
the wind some do ply, with up sails, and white, even to the nick of
illumination, Heb. 6: 5, And tasting, of the heavenly gift, and a share and
part of the holy Ghost, and the tasting of the good word of God, and the powers
of the world to come: and yet this is but a false nick of renovation, and in a
short time, such are quickly broken upon the rocks, and never fetch the
harbor, but are sanded in the bottom of hell. O make your heaven sure, and
try how ye come by conversion; that it be not stolen goods, in a white and
wel-lustred profession! a white skin over old wounds makes an under-cotting
conscience: false under-water not seen, is dangerous, and that is a lek, and
rift in the bottom of an enlightened conscience, often falling, and sinning
against light. Woe, woe is me, that the holy profession of Christ, is made a
stage garment by many, to bring home a vain fame; and Christ is made to serve
men's ends: this is as it were to stop an oven with a Kings robes. Know. 2.
except men martyr and slay the body of sin, in sanctified self-denial, they
shall never be Christ's martyrs, and faithful witnesses. Oh if I could be
master of that house-idol my self, my own, mine, my own will, wit, credit, and
ease! how blessed were I? O but we have need to be redeemed from our selves,
rather then from the Devil, and the world! learn to put out your selves, and
to put in Christ for your selves: I should make a sweet b^rtering, and
niffering, and give old for new, if I could shuffle out self, and substitute
Christ my Lord in place of my felf to say, not I, but Christ, not my will, but
Christ's; not my ease, not my lust, not my feckl^ss Credit, but Christ, Christ.
But alace in leaving our selves, in s^t^ng Christ before our Idol, self, we
have yet a glaik^d back-look to our old Idol. O wretched Idol, my self, when
shall I see thee wholly decourted, and Christ wholly put in thy room? Oh if
Christ, Christ, had the full place and room of my self, that all my aims,
purposes, thoughts, and desires, would coast and land upon Christ, and not upon
my self! and yet howbeit we can not attain to this denial of me, and mine, that
we can say I am not my self, my self is not my self, mine own is no longer mine
own; yet our aiming at this in all we do, shall be accepted: for alace I think
I shall di^, but minting and aiming to be a Christan: Is it not our comfort
that Christ the mediator of the new covenant is come betwixt us, and o^od in
the bussinesse, so that green and young heirs, the like (...) sinners, have now
a Tutour that is God, and now God be thanked, our salvation is bottomed on
Christ: sure I am the he bottom shall never fall out of heaven and happiness
to us: I would give over the bargain, a thousand times, were it not, that
Christ his free grace, has taken our salvation in hand. Pray, pray, and
contend with the Lord, for your sister-Church; for it would appear the Lord is
about to spier for his scattered sheep, in the dark and cloudy day. O that it
would please our Lord to set up again David's old wasted, and fallen tabernacle,
in Scotland; that we might see the glory of the second temple in this land! O
that my little heaven were wodset, to redeem the honor of my Lord Jesus, among
Jews, and Gentiles! let never dew lie upon my branches, and let my poor flower
wither at the root, so being Christ were enthroned, and his glory advanced in
all the world, and especially in these three Kingdoms: but I know he has no
need of me, what can I add to him? but oh that he would cause his high and
pure glory run through such a foul channel as I am! and howbeit he has caused
the blossom fall off my one poor joy, that was on this side of heaven, even my
liberty to preach Christ to his people, yet I am dead to that now, so being he
would hew and carve glory, glory for evermore, to my royal King, out of my
silence, and sufferings. Oh that I had my fill of his love, but I know ill
manners make an uncouth and strange bridegroom. I entreat you earnestly for the
aid of your prayers, for I forget not you, and I salute with my soul in
Christ, the faithful Pastors, and honorable and worthy Professors in that
Land. Now the God of peace that brought again our Lord Jesus from the dead, the
great shephered of the sheep, by the blood of the everlasting covenant, make
you perfect, in every good work, to do his will; working in you that which is
well pleasing in his sight, Grace, Grace be with you.

Aberden, Feb. 4. 1638. Yours in his sweeetest Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the truly noble and elect lady my lady VICOUNTESSE of KENMURE. (4)
Noble and elect Lady.
THat honor that I have prayed for these sixteen years, with submission to my
Lords will, my kind Lord has now bestowed upon me; even to suffer for my
royal and princely King Jesus and for his Kingly crown, and the freedom of his
Kingdom, that his father has given him. The forbidden Lords have sentenced me
with deprivation, and confinement within the town of Aberden. I am charged in
the Kings name, to enter against the twenty day of August next, and there to
remain during the Kings pleasure, as they have given it out. howbeit Christ's
green cross newly laid upon me, be somewhat heavy, while I call to mind the
many fair days, sweet and comfortable to my soul, and to the souls of many
others, and how young ones in Christ; are plucked from the breast, and the
inheritance of God laid waste: yet that sweet smelled and perfumed cross of
Christ, is accompanied with sweet refreshments, with the kisses of a King, with
the joy of the holy Ghost, with faith that the Lord hears the sighing of a
prisoner, with undoubted hope (as sure as my Lord lives) after this night, to
see day light, and Christ's sky to clear up again upon me, and his poor Kirk,
and that in a strange Land amongst strange faces he will give favor in the
eyes of men, to his poor oppressed servant, who dow not but love that lovely
one, that princely one, Jesus the comforter of his soul. All would be well if I
were free of old challanges for guiltiness, and for neglect in my calling, and
for speaking too little for my welbeloveds crown, honor, and Kingdom. Oh for a
day in the assembly of the saints to advocate for King Jesus! If my Lord go on
now to quarrels also, I die, I cannot endure it: but I look for peace from him,
because he knows I dow bear men's feud but I dow not bear his feud: this is my
only exercise, that I fear I have done little good in my ministry: but I dare
not but say, I loved the bai^^s of the wedding chamber; and prayed for and
desired the thriving of the marriage, and coming of his Kingdom. I apprehend no
less then a judgment upon Galloway, and that the Lord shall visit this whole
nation, for the quarrel of the covenant. But what can be laid upon me, or any
the like of me, is too light for Christ: Christ dow ^ear more and would bear
death and burning quick, in his we^k servants, even for this honorable cause,
that I now suffer for. Yet for all my complaints (and he knows that I dare
not now dissemble) he was never sweeter, and Kinder then he is now; one kiss
now, is sweeter then ten long since, sweet, sweet is his cross; light, light
and easy is his yoke. O what a sweet step were it, up to my fathers house
through ten deaths, for the truth, and cause, of that unknown and so,
not-halfe-wel-loved plant of renown, the man called the Branch, the chief among
ten thousands, the fairest among the sons of men! O what unseen joys, how many
hidden heart-burnings of love, are in the remnants of the sufferings of Christ!
my dear worthy Lady I give it to your La: under my own hand (my heart-writing
as well as my hand) welcome, welcome, sweet, sweet, and glorious cross of
Christ, welcome sweet Jesus, with thy light cross, thou have now gained and
gotten all my love from me, ^eep what thou have gotten. Only, woe, woe is me,
for my bereft-flock, for the Lambs of Jesus, that I fear shall be fed with dry
breasts, but I sparenow. Madam, I dare not promise to see your La: because of
the little time I have alloted me, and I purpose to obey the King, who has
power of my body, and rebellion to Kings is unbeseeming Christ's Ministers. Be
pleased to acquiant my Lady Mar with my case, I will look your La: and that
good Lady will be mindful to God of the Lords prisoner, not for my cause, but
for the Gospels sake. Madam bind me more (if more can be) to your La: and write
thanks to your brother my Lord of Lorne for what he has done for me, a poor
unknown stranger to his Lo: I shall pray for him, and his house, while I live,
It is his honor, to open his mouth in the streets for his wronged, and
oppressed master Christ Jesus. Now Madam commending your La: and the sweet
child to ^he tender mercies of mine own Lord Jesus, and his good will who
dwelt in the bush; I Rest.

Edinb: July 28. 1636. Yours in his own sweetest, Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the Noble and Christian Lady the VICOUNTESSE of KENMURE. (5)
My very Honorable and dear Lady
GRace mercy and peace, be to you, I cannot forget your La: and that sweet
child, I desire to hear what the Lord is doing to you, and him: to write to me
were charity, I cannot but write to my friends, that Christ has try^ted me in
Aberden, and my adversaries have sent me here, to be feasted with love-banquets
with my royal, high, high, and princely King Jesus. Madam why should I smother
Christ's honesty, I dare not conceal his goodness to my soul, he looked framed
and uncouth-like upon me, when I came first here; but I believe himself better
then his looks: I shall not again quarrel Christ for a gloome, now he has
taken the mask off his face and says kiss thy fill, and what can I have more,
while I get great heaven in my little arms. O how sweet are the sufferings of
Christ, for Christ! God forgive them that raise an ill report upon the sweet
cross of Christ, it is but our weak and dim eyes, that look but to the black
side that makes us mistake: these who can take that crabbed-tree hand-somely
upon their back, and fasten it on cannily, shall find it such a burden, as
wings unto a bird, or sails to ship. Madam rue not of your having chosen the
better part: upon my salvation this is Christ's truth I now suffer for, if I
found but cold comfort in my sufferings, I would not beguile others, I would
have told you plainly; but the truth is, Christ's crown, his scepter, and the
freedom of his Kingdom, is that, which is now called in question: because we
will not allow that Christ pay tribute and be a vassal to the shields of the
earth, therefore the sons of our mother are angry at us: but it becomes not
Christ to hold any man's stir^up: It were a sweet and honorable death to die
for the honor of that royal, and princely King Jesus: his love is a mystery
to the world: I would not have believed that there was so much in Christ, as
there is, Come and see makes Christ to be known in his excellency and glory. I
wish all this Nation knew how sweet his breath is, it is little to see Christ
in a book, as men do the world in a card, they talk of Christ by the book and
the tongue, and no more; but to come nigh Christ and hausse him, and embrace
him, is another thing. Madam I write to your Honor for your encouragement in
that honorable profession, Christ has honored you with: Ye have gotten the
Sunny side of the brae, and the best of Christ's good things; he has not given
you the bastard's portion, and howbeit ye get strokes and sour looks from your
Lord, yet believe his love more then your own feeling, for this world can take
nothing from you, that is truly yours, and death can do you no wrong: your
rock does not ebb and flow, but your sea: that which Christ has said he will
bide by it, he will be your tutour, you shall not get your charters of heaven
to play you with: It is good that ye have lost your credit with Christ, and
that Lord fr^ewill shall not be your tutour, Christ will lippen the taking of
you to heaven neither to your self, nor any deputy, but only to him self,
blessed be your tutour: When your head shall appear, your bridegroom and Lord,
your day shall then dawn and it shall never have an afternoon nor an evening
shadow. Let your child be Christ's, let him stay beside you, as the lords
pledge, that you shall willingly render again if God will. Madam I find folks
here kind to me, but in the night, and under their breath; my masters cause may
not come to the crown of the causey, others are kind according to their
fashion, many think me a strange man, and my cause not good; but I care not
much for man's thoughts or approbation: I think no shame of the cross. The
preachers of this town pretend great love, but the Prelates have added to the
rest this gentle cruelty (for so they think of it) to discharge me of the
pulpits of this town, the people murmur, and cry out against it, and to speak
truly howbeit Christ is most indulgeat to me otherwise, yet my silence on the
Lords day keeps me from being exalted above measure, and from ^^artling in the
heat of my Lords love. Some people affect me, for the which cause, I hear the
preachers here, purpose to have my confinement changed, to another place; so
cold is northern love: but Christ and I will bear it. I have vvrestled long
with this sad silence, I said what aileth Christ at my service, and my soul
has been at a pleading with Christ, and at yea and nay; but I will yield to
him, providing my suffering, may preach more then my tongue did; for I gave not
Christ an inch but for twice as good again: in a word I am a fool, and he is
God. I will hold my peace hereafter. Let me hear from your La: and your Dear
Child pray for a prisoner of Christ who is mindful of your La: Remember my
obliged obedience to my good Lady Mar, Grace, Grace be with you. I write and
pray blessings to your sweet child.

Aberd. Nov. 22. 1636. Yours in all Dutiefull obedience in his only Lord
Jesus, S. R.

To the right honorable and Christian Lady, my Lady VICOUNTESSE of KENMURE. (6)
MADAM.
GRace, Mercy and peace be to you: I received your La: letter, it refreshed me
in my heaviness: the blessing and prayers of a prisoner of Christ's come upon
you. Since my coming hither, Galloway sent me not a line, except what my
Brother, Earlstoun, and his son did write: I cannot get my papers transported:
but Madam I want not kindness of one, who has the gate of it, Christ (if he
had never done more for me since I was borne) has engaged my heart, and gained
my blessing, in this house of my pilgrimage. It pleases my welbeloved to dine
with a poor prisoner, and the Kings spiknard casts a fragrant smell: nothing
grieveth me, but that I eat my feasts my alone, and that I cannot edify his
saints: O that this Nation knew what is betwixt him and me, none would skar at
the cross of Christ! my silence eats me up, but he has told me, he thanketh
me no less, then if I were preaching daily, he sees how gladly I would be at
it, and therefore my wages are going to the fore up in heaven, as if I were
still preaching Christ. Captains pay duly bedfast soldiers, howbeit they dow
not march, nor carry armor; Though ^srael be not gathered, yet shall (...) be
glorious in the eyes of my Lord, and my lord shall be my strength, If^^ 49: 5.
my garland, The Banished Minister, (the te^ne of Aberden) ashameth me not: I
have seen the white side of Christ's cross, lovely, has he been to his
oppressed servant: Psalm. 146: 7. The Lord executes judgment for the
oppressed, he gives food to the hungry, the Lord loses the prisoner, the
Lord raiset^ them that are bowed down, the Lord preserves the stranger. If it
were come to exchanging of crosses, I would not exchange my cross with any, I
am wel-pleased with Christ, and he with me; I hope none shall hear us. It Is
true for all this, I get my meat with many stroks, and am seven times a day up
and down, and am often anxious, and cast down for the case of my oppressed
brother, yet I hope the Lord will be surty for his servant. But now upon some
weak, very weak experience, I am come to love a rumbling and raging devil beit,
seeing we must have a devil to hold the saints waking, I wish a cumbersome
devil, rather then a secure and sleeping one. At my first coming hither, I took
the dorts at Christ; and took up a stoma^k against him, I said he had cast me
over the dike of the vineyard, like a dry tree; but it was his mercy I see,
that the fire did not burn the dry tree, and now as if my Lord Jesus had done
the fault, and not I, (who belied my Lord,) he has made the first mends, and
he spoke not one word against me, but has come again, and quickened my soul
with his presence: nay now I think the very a^^uety, and casualities of the
cross of Christ Jesus my Lord, and these comforts that accompany it, better,
then the worlds set rent. O how many rich off-fallings are in my Kings house, I
am persuaded, and dare pawnd my salvation on it, that it is Christ's truth I now
suffet for: I know his comforts are no dreams, he would not put his seal on
blank paper, nor deceive his afflicted ones, that trust in him. Your La; wrote
to me, that ye are yet an ill scholar: Madam ye must go in at heavens gates,
and your book in your hand, still learning, you have had your own large share
of troubls, and a double portion; but i^ says your Father counts you not a
ba^tard; fu^-begotten bairns are nurtured, Heb. 12. 8. I long to hear of the
child, I write the blessings of Christ's prisoner and the mercies of God to
him; let him be Christ's and yours betwixt you, but let Christ ^e whole
play-maker, let him be the lender, and ye the borrower, not an owner: Madam it
is not long since I did write to your La: that Christ is keeping mercy for you,
and I bide by it still, and now I write it under my hand: love him dearly, win
in to see him, there is in him, that which you never saw, he is a^ ^igh, he is
a tree of life, green, and blossoming, both summer and winter. there is a nick
in Christianity, to the which whosoever comes, they see and feel more then
others can do: I invite you of new to come to him, Come and See will speak
better things of him then I can do, come nearer, come nearer will say much. God
thought never this world a portion worthy of you, he would not even you to a
gift of dirt and clay, nay he will not give you Esa^'s portion, but reserves
the inheritance of Jacob for you: are ye not well married now? have you not a
good husband now? my heart cannot express what sad nights I have for the
virgin daughter of my people: woe is me for our time is coming, Ezekiel. 7: 10.
behold the day, behold it is come, the morning has gone forth, the rod has
blossomed, pride has bu^ded, violence is risen up in a rod of wickedness, the
sun is gone down upon our prophets: A dry wind upon Scotland, but neither to
fan nor to cleanse; but out of all question when the Lord has cut down his
forest, the after-growth of Lebanon shall flourish, they shall plant vines in
our mountains, and a cloud shall yet fill the Temple. Now the blessing of our
dearest Lord Jesus, and the blessing of him that is seperat from his brethren
come upon you.

Yours at Aberden the prisoner of Christ, S. R.

To the honorable and truly noble lady, the VICOUNTESSE of KENMURE. (7)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to your La: I long to hear from you, I am here
waiting if a good wind long-looked for, sha^^ at length blow in Christ's sails
in this land: But I wonder if Jesus be not content, to suffer more yet in his
members, and cause, and beauty of his house; rather then he should not be
avenged upon this land: I hear many worthy men (who see more in the Lords
dealing, then I can take up with my dim sight) are of a contrait mind, and do
believe the Lord is coming home again to his house in Scotland: I hope he is on
his journey that way, yet I look not, but that he shall feed this land, with
their own blood, before he establish his throne amongst us: I know your Honor
is not looking after things here-away, ye have no great cause to think, that
your stock, and principal, is under the roof of these visible heavens: and I
hope ye would think your self a beguiled and co^sened Soul if it were so, I
would be sorry to counsel your La: to make a covenant with time, and this
life; but rather desire you to hold in fair generals, and far off, from this
ill founded heaven that is on this side of the water. It speaks some what,
when our Lord blows the bloome off our daft hopes in this life, and loppeth
the branches of our worldly joys well nigh the root, on purpose, that they
should not thrive. Lord spill my fools heaven in this life, that I may be saved
for ever. A forfeiture of the saints part of the yolke and marrow, of
short-laughing happiness worldly; is not such a real evil, as our blinded eyes
do conceive: I am thinking long now for some deliverance, more then before;
but I know I am in an error: It is possible I am not come to that measure of
trial, that the Lord is seeking in his work. If my friends in Galloway would
effectualy do for my deliverance, I would exceedingly rejoice: but I know not,
but the Lord has a way, whereof he will be the only reaper of praises. Let me
know with the bearer, how the child is, the Lord be his Father, and Tutour,
and your only comforter: There is nothing here where I am, but profanitie and
atheism. Grace, grace be with your La.

Aberd. Feb. 13. 1637. Your La: at all oblidged obedience in Christ, S. R.

To the noble and Christian lady the VICOUNTESSE of KENMURE. (8)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you, I would not omit the occasion to write to
your La: with the bearer: I am glad the child is well, Gods favor even in the
eyes of men be seen upon him: I hope your La: is thinking upon these sad and
woeful days, wherein we now live; when our Lord in his righteous judgment, is
sending the kirk the gate she is going, to Romes brothell house to seek a lover
of her own, seeing she has given up with Christ her husband. O what sweet
comfort, what rich salvation, is laid up for these, who had rather wash and
roll their garments in their own blood, then break out from Christ by
Apostasy! keep your self in the love of Christ, and stand far aback from the
pollutions of the world: side not with these times, and hold off from coming
nigh the signs of a conspiracy with these, that are now come out against
Christ; that ye may be One keept for Christ only: I know your La: thinks
upon this, and how ye may be humbled for your self and this backsliding land;
for Iavouch, that wrath from the Lord is gone out against Scotland. I think ay
the longer the better of my Royal and worthy master, he is become a new
welbeloved to me now, in renewed consolations, by the presence of the spirit of
grace and glory: Christ's garments smell of the powder of the merchant when he
comes out of his Ivory chambers; O his perfumed face, his fair face, his
lovely and kindly kisses, have made me a poor prisoner see, there i^ more to be
had of Christ in this life, then I believed: we think all is but a little
earnest, a four hours, a small tasting we have, or is to be had in this life,
(which is true compared with the inheritance) but yet I know it is more, It is
the Kingdom of God within us. Woe, woe, is me, that I have not ten loves, for
that one Lord Jesus, and that love f^ileth, and d^ieth up in loving him; and
that I find no way to spend my love-desires, and the yolke of my heart upon
that fairest, and dearest one: I am far behind with my narrow heart. O how
ebb a soul have I to take in Christ's love! for let worlds be multiplied
according to Angels understanding, in millions, while they weary themselves;
these worlds would not contain, the thousand part of his love. O if I could
yoke in amongst the thick of Angels, and Seraphims, and now-glorified Saints;
and could raise a new love-song of Christ, before all the world! I am pained
with wondering at new opened treasures in Christ, if every finger, member,
bone, and joint, were a torch burning in the hottest fire in hell, I would they
could all send out love-praises, high songs of praise for evermore, to that
plant of renown, to that royal and high Prince Jesus my Lord: but alace his
love swells in me, and finds no vent: alace what can a dumb prisoner do or
say for him. O for an ingine to write a book of Christ and his love, nay I am
left of him bound, and chained with his love, I cannot find a loosed soul to
lift up his praises, and give them out to others; but oh my day light has
thick clouds, I cannot shine in his praises, I am often like a ship plying
about to seek the wind, I sail at great leisure, and cannot be blown upon
that lovliest Lord. O if I could turn my sails to Christ's right arth, and that
I had my hearts wishes of his love! But, I but mar his praises, nay I know no
comparison of what Christ is, and what his worth is, all the Angels, and all
the glorified, praise him not so much as in halfes, who can advance him or
utter all his praises? I want nothing, unknown faces favor me, enemies must
speak good of the truth, my masters cause purchases commendation. The hopes of
my enlargement from appearances are cold, my faith has no bed to sleep upon,
but omnipotency. The goodwill of the Lord, and his sweetest presence be with
you and that child. Grace and peace be yours.

MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to your La: I would not omit to write a line with
this christian bearer, one in your La: own case, driven near to Christ, in, and
by, her affliction. I wish that my friends in Galloway forget me not, however
it be Christ is so good, that I will have no other tutour, suppose I could have
wail and choice of ten thousand beside: I think now five hundred heavy hearts
for him too little. I wish Christ now weeping, suffering, and contemned of men,
were more dear and desirable to many souls then he is: I am sure if the saints
wanted Christ's cross, so profitable and so sweet, they might for the gain and
glory of it, wish it were lawful, either to buy or borrow his cross; but it
i^ a mercy that the saints have it laid to their hand for nothing, for I know
no sweeter way to heaven, then through free grace, and hard trials together,
and one of these cannot well want another. O that time would Post faster, and
hasten our long-looked for communion, with that fairest, fairest among the sons
of men! O that the day would favor us, and come, and put Christ and us in
others arms? I am sure a few years will do our turn, and the soldiers
hour-glasse will soon run out. Madam look to your lamp, and look for your Lords
coming, and let your heart dwell aloof from that sweet child; Christ's
jealousy will not admit two equal loves in your La: heart, he must have one,
and that the greatest; a little one to a creature may, and must suffice a soul
married to him, your maker is your husband, Isa. 54. I would wish you well, and
my obligation these many years by gone speak no less to me, but more I can
neither wish, nor pray, nor desire for to your La: then Christ singled and
wailed out, from all created good things: or Christ howbeit wet in his own
blood, and wearing a crown of thorns. I am sure the saints at their best, are
but strangers to the weight, and worth of the incomparable sweetness of
Christ: He is so new, so fresh in excellency, every day of new, to these that
search more and more in him, as if heaven could furnish as many new Christ's (If
I may speak so) as there are days betwixt him and us, and yet he is one and
the same. Oh we love an unknown lover, when we love Christ! Let me hear how the
child is every way, the Prayers of a prisoner of Christ be upon him, grace for
evermore even while glory perfect it, be with your La:

NOtwithstanding the great haste of the bearer I would bless your La: in
paper: desiring, that since Christ has ever envied, that the world should have
your love by him, that ye give your self out for Christ, and that ye may be for
no other. I know none worthy of you but Christ, Madam I am either suffering for
Christ, and this is either the sure and good way, or I have done with heaven
and will never see Gods face (which I bless him cannot be.) I write my
blessing to that sweet child that ye have borrowed from God, he is no heritage
to you but a loan, love him as folks do borrowed things: my heart is heavy
for you. They say the Kirk of Christ has neither son, nor heir, and therefore
her enemies shall possess her: but I know she is not that ill friended, her
husband is her heir, and she his heritage. If my Lord would be pleased I would
desire some were dealt with, for my return to Anwoth, but if that never be, I
thank God Anwoth is not heaven, preaching is nor Christ, I hope to wait on. Let
me hear how the child is, and your La: mind and hopes of him, for it would
ease my heart to know that he is well. I am in good terms with Christ, but oh
my guiltiness, yet he brings not plea's betwixt him and me to the streets,
and before the sun. Grace, grace, for evermore be with your La:

To the right honorable and Christian Lady, my Lady VICOUNTESSE of KENMURE (11)
MADAM.
GRace mercy and peace to you: I am refreshed with your Letter: the right hand
of him to whom belong the issues from death, has been gracious to that sweet
child, I dow not, I do not forget him, and your La: in my prayers. Madam for
your own case, I love careful, and withal doing-complaints of want of
practice, because I observe many who think it holiness enough, to complain and
set themselves at nothing; as if to say I am sick, would cure them: they think
complaints a good charm for guiltiness. I hope ye are wrestling and struggling
on, in this dead age, wherein folks have lost tongue, and legs and arms for
Christ. I urge upon you Madam, a nearer communion with Christ and a growing
communion: There are curtains to be drawn by, in Christ, that we never saw; and
new foldings of love in him: I despair that ever I shall win to the far end of
that love, there are so many plies in it. Therefore dig deep, and sweat, and
labor, and take pains for him; and set by so much time in the day for him; as
you can: he will be win with labor. I, his exiled prisoner sought him, and he
has rued upon me, and has made a moan for me, as he does for his own, Jer.
31: 20. Isa 45: 11. and I know not what to do with Christ, his love
surroundeth, and surchargeth me. and burdened with it, but O how sweet and
lovely is that burden, I dow not keep it within me: I am so in love with his
love, that if his love were not in heaven, I would be unwilling to go there. O
what weighing and what telling is in Christ's love! I fear nothing now so much,
as the laughing of Christ's cross, and the love-showers that accompany it: I
wonder what he means to put such a slave at the board-head, at his own elbow.
Oh that I should lay my black mouth to such a fair, fair, fair face as Chri^s:
but I dare not refuse to be loved, the cause is not in me why he has looked
upon me, and loved me, for he got neither budde nor hire of me, it co^t me
nothing, it is good cheap love. O the many pound-weights of his love under
which I am sweetly pressed! Now Madam, I persuade you, the greatest part but
play with Christianity, they put it by hand easily: I thought it had been an
easy thing to be a Christian, and that to see^ God, had been at the next door,
but oh the windings, the turnings, the up's, and the down's, that he has led
me through, and I see yet much way to the foord, he speaks with my reins in
the night season and in the morning, when I awake I find his love-arrowes that
he shot at me, sticking in my heart: who will help me to praise? who will come
lift with me, and set on high his great love? and yet I find that a
fir^-flaught of challanges will come in at mid-summer, and question me, but it
is only to keep a ^inner in order. As for Friends I shall not think the world,
to be the world, if that well go not dry, I trust in God, to use the world as
a Canny or Cunning-master do^th a knave-servant (at lest God give me grace to
do so) he gives him no handling or credit, only he intrusteth him with
common errands, wherein he cannot play the knave: I pray God I may not give this
world credit of my joys, and comforts, and confidence, that were to put Christ
out of his office: nay I counsel you Madam, from a little experience, let
Christ ke^p the great seal, and entrust him so, as to hing your vessels great
and small, and pin your burdens upon the nail fastened in David's house, Isai.
22: 23. Let me not b^ well, if ever they get the tutouring of my comforts:
away, away with irresponsall Tutours, that would play me a slip, and then
Christ would laugh at me, and say well-wared, try again ere ye trust. Now woe
is me for my whorish mother the Kirk of Scotland; Oh who will bewail her: Now
the presence of the great Angel of the covenant to be with you and that sweet
child.

Aberd. March. 7. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the right honorable and Christian Lady, my Lady KENMURE. (12)
MADAM.
UPon the offered opportunity of this worthy bearer I could not omit to answer
the heads of your letter. 1. I think not much to set down in paper some good
things anent Christ, that sealed and holy thing, and to feed my soul with raw
wishes to be one with Christ; for a wish is but broken and half-love, but
verily to obey this, come and see: is a harder matter. but oh I have rather
smoke then fire, and guessings rather then real assurances of him: I have
little or nothing to say, that I am as one who has found favor in his eyes;
but there is some pining and mismannered hunger, that makes me miscall and
nickname Christ as a changed Lord, but alace it is ill flitten. I can not
bel^eve without a pledge, I cannot take Gods word without a Caution; as if
Christ had lost and sold his credit, and were not in my books responsall and
law-biding, but this is my way, for his way is, Ephesians. 1: 13. after that ye
believed ye were sealed, with the holy spirit of promise. 2. Ye write that I am
filled with knowledge, and stand not in need of these warnings, but certainly
my light is dim, when it comes to handy-grips: and how many have full coffers
and yet empty bellies: light and the saving use of light, are far different. O
What need have I to have the ashes blown away from my Dying-out fire! I may be
a book-man, and be an Idiot and stark fool in Christ's way, learning will not
beguile Christ, the Bible beguiled the Pharasees, and so may I be misted:
Therefore as night watches hold one another waking, by speaking to one another,
so have we need to hold one another on foot; sleep steals away the light of
watching, even the light that reproves sleeping. I doubt not but more should
fetch heaven, if they believed not heaven to be at the next door: the worlds
negative holiness, no adulterer, no murderer, no thief, no Cousiner, makes men
believe they are already glorified saints: but the, 6. Chap. to the, Heb: may
affright us all, when we hear that men may take of the gifts, and common graces
of the holy spirit, and a taste of the powers of the life to come, to hell with
them: here is reprobate silver which yet seems to have the Kings Image, and
superscription upon it. 3. I find you complaining of your self, and it
becomes a sinner so to do, I am not against you in that, sense of death, is a
sib friend, and and of kin and blood to life, the more sense, the more life,
the more sense of sin, the less sin. I would love my pain, and sorness, and my
wounds, howbeit these should bereave me of my nights sleep, better then my
wounds without pain. O how sweet a thing is it, to give Christ his handful of
broken arms, and legs, and disjointed bones. 4. Be not afraid for little
grace, Christ sows his livingseed, and he will not lose his seed: if he have
the guiding of my stock, and state, it shall not miscarry. Our spilt works,
losses, deadness, coldness, wretchedness; are the ground which the good
husbandman labors. 5. Ye write that his compassions fail not,
notwithstanding that your service to Christ miscarrieth: To the which I answer:
God forbid that there were buying, and selling, and blocking for as good again,
betwixt Christ and us; for then free grace might go play it, and a Savior
sing dumb, and Christ go and sleep: but we go to heaven with light shoulders,
and all the bairn-time, and the vessels great and small that we have, are
fastened upon the sure nail, Isa 23: 24. the only danger is, that we give grace
more a do then God gives it, that is, by turning his grace into wantonness.
6. Ye write few see your guiltiness, and ye cannot be free with many, as with
me: I Answer: blessed be God, Christ and we are not heard before men's courts,
it is at home betwixt him and us, that pleas are taken away: Grace be with you.

Aberd. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the right honorable and Christian Lady, my Lady KENMURE. (13)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to your La: God be thanked ye are yet in possession
of Christ and that sweet child: I pray God the former may be sure heritage,
and the latter a loan for your comfort; while he do good to his poor
afflicted, withered mount Sion: and who knows but our Lord has comforts laid
up in store for her and you. I am persuaded Christ has bought you by, the
devil, and hell, and sin, that they have no claim to you; and that is a rich
and unvaluable mercy. Long since, ye were half challenging deaths cold
kindness, in being so slow and swier to come and loose a tired prisoner: but ye
stand in need of all the erosses, losses, changes, and sad hearts that befell
you since that time: Christ knows the body of sin unsubdued; will take them
all and more: we know that Paul had need of the devils service, to buffet him,
and far more we. But my dear and honorable Lady, spend your sand-glasse well:
I am sure ye have law to raise 2 suspension against all, that devils, men,
friends, world, losses, hell, or sin can decree against you: it is good your
crosses will but convey you to heavens gates: In ^an they not go, the gate
shall be closed on them, when ye shall be admitted to the throne. Time stands
not still, eternity is hard at our door. O what is laid up for you! Therefore
harden your face against the wind, and the Lamb your husband is making ready
for you, the bridegroom would fain have that day, as gladly as your Honor
would wish to have it, he has not forgotten you. I have heard a rumor of the
Prelates purpose to banish me, but let it come if God so will, the other side of
the sea is my fathers ground as well as this side: I ow bowing to God but no
servil bowing to crosses, I have been but too soft in that: I am comforted that
I am persuaded fully that Christ is halfer with me in this well-born and honest
cross, and if he claim right to the best half of my troubles, (as I know he
does to the whole;) I shall remit it over to Christ, what I shall do in this
case: I know certainly my Lord Jesus will not mar nor spill my sufferings, he
has use for them in his house. O what it works on me, to remember that a
stranger who comes not in by the door, shall build hay and stuble upon the
golden foundation I la^d amongst that people in Anwoth: but I know providence
looks not asquint but looks straight out, and through all men's darkness: O
that I could wait upon the Lord: I had but one eye, one joy, one delight, even
to preach Christ, and my mothers sons were angry at me, and have put out the
poor man's one eye, and what have I behind? I am sure this sour world has
lost my heart deservedly, but oh that there were a d^^es-man to lay his hand
upon us both, and determine upon my part of it. Alace that innocent and lovely
truth should be sold, my tears are but little worth, but yet for this thing I
weep, I weep: alace that my fair and lovely Lord Jesus should be miskent in his
own house, it reckons little of five hundred the like of me: Yet the water
goes not over faiths breath, yet our King lives: I write the prisoners
blessing, the good will, and long lasting Kindness, with the comforts of the
very God of peace be to your La: and to your sweet child, grace, grace be with
you.

Aberd. Sep. 7. 1637 Your honors at all obedience in his sweet Lord Jesus, S.
R.

To the much honored JOHN GORDON, Of Cardoness elder. (14)
MUch honored and dearest in my Lord, Grace, mercy and peace be to you, my
soul longs exceedingly to hear how matters go betwixt you and Christ; and
whether or not there be any work of Christ in that parish, that will bide the
trial of fire and water: let me be weighed of my Lord in a just balance, if
your souls lie not weighty upon me: you go to bed and you rise with me,
thoughts of your soul (my dearest in our Lord) depart not from me in my sleep;
ye have a great part of my tears, sighs, supplications, and prayers: O if I
could buy your souls salvation with any suffering whatsoever, and that ye and I
might meet with joy up in the Rainbow, when we shall stand before our judge! O
my Lord forbid I have any hard thing to depon against you in that day! O that
he who quickneth the dead, would give life to my sowing among you! what joy is
there (next to Christ) that stands on this side of death, would comfort me
more, then that the souls of that poor people were in ^afety, and beyond all
hazard of losing? Sir, show the people this, for when I write to you I think I
write to you all old and young. fulfill my joy and seek the Lord: Sure I am,
once I discovered my, lovely, royal, princely Lord Jesus to you all. Woe, woe
woe shall be your part of it for evermore, if the Gospel be not the savor of
life unto life to you: as many sermons as I preached, as many sentences as I
uttered, as many points of dittay shall they be, when the Lord shall plead with
the world, for the evil of their doings Believe me, I find heaven a city hard
to be won, the righteous will scarcely be saved: O what violence of thronging,
will heaven take! alace I see many deceiving them selves, for we will all to
heaven, now every foul dog with his foul feet will in at the nearest, to the
new and clean Jerusalem: all say they have faith, and the greatest part in the
world know not and will not consider, that a slip in the matter of their
salvation, is the most pitiful slip that can be; and that no loss is
comparable to this loss. O then see that there be not a loose pin in the work
of your salvation! for ye will not believe how quickly the judge will come? and
for your self, I know that death is waiting and hovering, and lingering at Gods
command, that ye may be prepared. Then ye had need to stir you time and to take
eternity, and death, to your riper advisment; a wrong step o^ a wrong stot in
going out of this life, in one property, is like the sin against the holy
Ghost, and can never be forgiven, because ye cannot come back again through the
last water, to mourn for it. I know your counts are many, and will take
telling, and laying, and reckoning betwixt you and your Lord; fit your counts,
and order them; lose not the last play, what ever ye do; for in that play with
death, your precious soul is the prize: for the Lords sake spill not the play,
and lose not such a treasure. Ye know out of love I had to your soul, and out
of desire I had to make an honest count for you, I testified my displeasure and
disliking of your ways very often, both in private and public: I am not now a
witness of your doings, but your judge is always your witness. I beseech you
by the mercies of God, by the salvation of your soul, by your comforts when
your eye strings shall break, and the face wax pale, and the soul shall tremble
to be out of the lodging of clay; and by your compearance before your awful
Judge, after the sight of this letter take a new course with your ways, and
now in the end of your day, make sure of heaven: examine your self if ye be in
good earnest in Christ, for some, Heb. 6. 4. are partakers of the holy Ghost,
and taste of the good word of God, and of the powers of the life to come: and
yet have no part in Christ at all. Many think they believe, but never tremble:
the devils are further on, then these, Jam. 2: 19. Make sure to your self that
ye are above ordinary professors; the sixth part of your span-length and
handbreadth of days, is scarcely before you: Haste, haste, for the tide will
not bide: Put Christ upon all your accounts, and your secrets: Better it is
that ye give him your counts in this life, out of your own hand, then that
after this life, he take them from you. I never knew so well what sin was, as
since I came to Aberden; howbeit I was preaching of it to you. To feel the
smoke of hel's fire, in the throat, for half an hour, to stand beside a river
of fire and brimstone, broader then the earth, and to think to be bound hand
and foot, and casten in the midst of it, quick, and then to have God locking
the prison door, never to be opened for all eternity: O how will it shake a
conscience, that has any life in it! I find the fruits of my pains to have
Christ and that people once fairly met, now meets my soul in my sad hours,
and I rejoice that I gave fair warning of all the corruptions, now entering in
Christ's house, and now many a sweet, sweet, soft kiss, many perfumed well
smelled kisses, and embracements, have I received of my royal Master: He and I
have had much love together. I have for the present a sick, dwining life, with
much pain, and much love-sickness for Christ: O what I would give to have a bed
made to my wearied soul, in his bosom! I would frist heaven for many years, to
have my fill of Jesus in this life, and to have occasion to offer Christ to my
people: and to woo many people to Christ. I cannot tell you what sweet pain,
and delight some torments are in Christ's love? I often challenge time, that
holds us sundry. I profess to you I have no rest, I have no ease while I be
over head and ears in lov's-ocean. if Christ's love, (that fountain of delight)
were laid as open to me as I would wish; O how would I drink, and drink
abundantly! O how drunken would this my soul be! I half call his absence
cruel, and the mask and veil on Christ's face, a cruel covering, that hides
such a fair, fair face, from a sick soul. I dare not challenge himself, but his
absence is a mountain of iron upon my heavy heart. O when will we meet! O how
long is it to the dawning of the marriage-day! O sweet Lord Jesus take wide
steps! O my Lord come over mountains at one stride! O my beloved flee like a
roe, or young heart, upon the mountains of separation! O if he would fold the
heavens together like an old cloak, and shovle time and days out of the way,
and make ready in haste the lambs wife for her husband! Since he looked upon
me, my heart is not mine own, he has run away to heaven with it: I know it was
not for nothing, that I spoke so meekle good of Christ to you in public. O if
the heaven and the heaven of heavens were paper, and the sea ink, and the
multitude of mountains pens of brass, and I were able to write that paper,
within, and without, full of the praises of my fairest, my dearest, my
loveliest, my sweetest, my matchless, and my most marrowlesse and mavelous
welbeloved! woe is me I cannot set him out to men and Angels. O there are few
tongues to sing love-songs of his incomparable excellency! what can I poor
prisoner do to exalt him? or what course can I take to extol my lofty, and
lovely Lord Jesus? I am put to my wits end, how to get his name made great.
Blessed they who would help me in this, how sweet are Christ's back-parts? O
what then is in his face! These that see his face, how dow they get their
eyeplucked off him again! Lookup to him and love him, O love and live. It were
life to me ifye would read this letter to that people, and if they did profit
by it. O if I could cause them die of love for Jesus! I charge them by the
salvation of their souls, to hang about Christ's neck, and take their fill of
his love, and follow him as I taught them: part by no means with Christ; hold
fast what ye have received; Keep the truth once delivered, If ye or that people
quite it in an hair, or in an hoof; ye break your conscience in twain: and who
then can mend it, and cast, a knot on it? my dearest in the Lord stand fast in
Christ: Keep the faith; contend for Christ; wrestle for him, and take men's feud
for Gods favor, there is no comparison betwixt these. O that my Lord would
fulfill my joy, and keep the young bride to Christ: that is at Anwoth, And now
whoever they be, that have returned to the old vomit since my departure; I
bind upon their back, in my masters name and authority; the long-lasting
weighty vengeance, and curse of God, in my Lords name I give them a doom of
black, unmixed, pure wrath, which my master shall ratify and make good, when
we stand together before him: except they timously repent, and turn to the
Lord. And I write to thee, poor mourning, and broken hearted believer, be who
thou will, of the free salvation: Christ's sweet balm for thy wounds, O poor
humble believer: Christ's kisses for thy watery checks; Christ's blood of
atonement for thy guilty soul, Christ's heaven for thy poor soul, though once
banished out of paradise: and my master shall make good my word ere long. O
that people were wise! O that people were wise! O that people would spier out
Christ, and never, est while they find him! O how shall my soul mourn in
secret, if my nine years pained head, and sore breast, and pained back, and
grieved heart, and private, and public prayers to God, shall all be for nothing
among that people. Did my Lord Jesus send me but to summond you before your
judge, and to leave your summonds at your houses? was I sent as a witness onnly
to gather your dittay's. O my God forbid: often did I tell you of a fan of Gods
word to come among you, for the contempt of it. I told you often of wrath,
wrath from the Lord, to come upon Scotland, and yet I bide by my Masters word;
it is quickly coming, desolation for Scotland, because of the quarrel of a
broken covenant. Now worthy Sir, now my dear people, my joy, and my crown in
the Lord, let him be your fear, seek the Lord, and his face, save your souls:
doves flee to Christ's windows: pray for me, and praise for me. The blessing of
my God, the prayers and blessing of a poor prisoner and your lawful pastor be
upon you.

Abrd. June. 16. 1367. Your Lawful and Loving Pastor, S. R.

To the right honorable and Christian Lady, my Lady BOYD. (15)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you, from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus
Christ: I cannot but thank your La: for your Letter that has refreshed my
soul. I think my self many ways obliged to your La: for your love to my
afflicted brother, now embarked with me, in that same cause: his Lord has been
pleased to put him upon truths side: I hope your La: will befriend him with
your counsel, and countenance in that country, where he is a stranger: and
your La: needeeth not fear but your kindness to his own, shall be put up in
Christ's accounts. Now Madam for your La: case, I rejoice exceedingly that the
Father of lights, has made you see, that there is a ni^^ in Christianity,
which ye contend to be at; and that is to quit the right eye, and the right
hand, and to keep the Son of God: I hope your desire is to make him your
garland, and your eye looks up the mount, which certainly is nothing but the
new creature: fear not, Christ will not cast water upon your smoking coal, and
then who else dare do it, if he say nay? Be sorry at corruption and not
secure, that companion lay with you in your mothers womb, and was as early
friends with you, as the breath of life, and Christ will not have it otherwise;
for he delights to take up fallen bairns and to mend broken brow^: binding up
of wounds, is his office: Isai. 61. First, I am glad Christ will get employment
of his calling in you, many a whole soul is in heaven, which was sicker then ye
are: He is content ye lay broken arms, and legs on his knee, that he may spelk
them. 2. Hiding of his face is wise love, his love is not fond, doting, and
reasonless, to give your head no other pillow, while ye be in at heavens gates,
but to lie betwixt his breasts, and lean upon his bosom: Nay hisbairns, must
often have the frosty cold side of the hill, and set down both their bare feet
among thorns: His love has eyes, and in the mean time is looking on. Our pride
must have winter weather to rot it. But I know Christ and ye shall not be
heard, ye will whisper it over betwixt your selves, and agree again, for the
Anchor-tow abides fast within the veil; the end of it is in Chrssts ten
fingers, who dare pull if he hold? I the Lord thy God will hold thy right hand,
saying, fear not, I will help thee: Isa. 41: 13. fear not Jacob. The sea-sick
passenger shall come to Land, Christ will be the first that will meet you on
the shore. I hope your La: will keep the Kings highway; go on in the strength
of the Lord in haste, as if ye had not leisure to speak to the Inne-keepers by
the way: he is over beyond time in the other side of the water who thinks
long for you. For my unfaithful self, Madam, I must say a word. At my first
coming hither, the devil made many black lies of my Lord Jesus, and said the
court was changed, and he was angry and would give an evil servant his leave at
mid-terme; but he gave me grace not to take my leave, I resolved to bide
summonds, and sit, howbeit it was suggested and said, what should be done with
a withered tree, but over the duke with it? But now, now, (I dare not, I dow
not keep it up) who is feasted as his poor exiled prisoner? I think shame of
the board-head, and the first mess, and the royal Kings dining-hall; and that
my black hand should come on such a rulers table: but I cannot mend it, Christ
must have his will; only he paineth my soul so, sometimes with his love, that
I have been nigh to pass modesty, and to cry out, he has lest a smoking
burning coal in my heart, and gone to the door himself, and left me and it
together; yet it is not desertion, I know not what it is; but I was never so
sick for him as now. I durst not challenge my Lord, if I got no more for
heaven, it is a dating cross. I know he has other thing to do, then to play
with me, and tr^^le an apple with me, and that this feast will end. O for
instruments in Gods name, that this is he! and that I may make use of it, when
it will be a near friend within me, and when it will be said by a
challengingdevil were is my God? Since I know it will not last, I desire but
to keep broken meat: but let no man after me, slander Christ for his cross.
The Great Lord of the Covenant, who brought from the dead, the great shepherd
of his sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant, establish you, and keep
you and yours to his appearance.

Aberd. March. 7. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To Mr ALEXANDER HENDERSON. (16)
My reverend and dear Brother.
I Received your Letters: They are as apples of gold to me, for which my sweet
feasts (and they are above the deserving of such a sinner, high and out of
measure) I have sadness to ballast me, and weight me a little. It is but his
boundless wisdom, who has taken the tutouring of his witless child, and he
knows, to be drunken with comforts, is not safest for our stomachs: However
it be, the din and noise and glooms of Christ's cross, are weightier then it
self. I protest to you (my witness is in heaven) I could wish many pound
weights added to my cross, to know that by sufferings, Christ were set forward
in his kingly office in this Land. Oh what is my skin to his glory, Or my
losses, or my sad heart, to the apple of the eye of our Lord, and his beloved
spouse, his precious truth, his royal privileges, the glory of manifested
justice in giving of his foes a dash, the testimony of his faithful servants,
who do glorify him when he rides upon poor weak worms, and triumphs in
them! I desire you to pray that I may come out of this furnace with honesty,
and that I may leave Christ's truth no worse then I found it, and that this most
honorable cause, may neither be stained, nor weakened. As for your case my
Reverend and Dearest Brother, ye are the talking of the North and South; and
looked to so, as if ye were all crystal glass, your mots and dust should soon
be proclaimed, and trumpets blown at your slips: But I know ye have laid help
upon one that is mighty. Entrust not your comforts to men's airy and frothy
applause, neither lay your down-castings on the tongues of salt mockers, and
reproachers of godliness: As deceivers and yet true, as unknown and yet well
known. God has called you to Christ's side, and the wind is now on Christ's face
in this land; and seeing ye are with him ye cannot expect the lee-side, or the
sunny-side of the brae: But I know ye have resolved to take Christ upon any
terms whatsoever: I hope ye do not rue, though your cause be hated, and that
prejudices are taken up against it; The shields of the world think our Master
cumbersome wares; and that he makes too great din, and that his cords and yoks
make blains and deep scores in their neck, therefore they kick, they say this
man shall not reign over us. Let us pray one for another, He who has made you
a chosen arrow in his quiver, hide you in the hollow of his hand: I am.

Aberd. March. 9. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the right honorable my Lord LOWDON. (17)
MY very noble and honorable Lord, Grace, mercy and peace be to you, I make
bold to write to your Lo: that you may know the honorable cause ye are graced
to prosesse, is Christ's own truth. Ye are many ways blessed of God, who has
taken upon you, to come out to the strects, with Christ on your forehead; when
so many are ashamed of him, and hide him (as it were) under their cloak, as if
he were a stolen Christ. If this faithless generation, (and especially the
Nobles of this Kingdom,) thought not Christ dear wares, and Religion expensive,
hazardous, and dangerous, they would not slip from his cause as they do and
stand looking on, with their hands folded behind their back; when lowns are
running away with the spoil of Sion on their back, and the boards of the Son
of Gods tabernacle. Law and Justice are to be had to any, especially for money,
and moyen; but Christ can get no law, good cheap nor dear. It were the glory
and honor of you who are the Nobles of this land, to plead for your wronged
bridegroom, and his oppressed Spouse, as far as zeal and standing law will go
with you. Your ordinary logic from the event (that it will do no good) to
the cause (and therefore silence, is best, till the Lord put to his own hand)
it is not (with reverence of your Lo: Learning) worth a straw: Events are Gods,
let us do, and not plead against Gods Office, let him sit at his own helm who
moderateth all events. It is not a good course to complain that we cannot get a
providence of gold, when our lasiness, cold zeal, temporizing, and faithless
fearfulness spilleth good providence. Your Lo: will pardon me, I am not of that
mind, that tumults or arms is the way to put Christ on his throne, or that
Christ will be served and truth vindicated only with the arm of flesh and
blood: nay, Christ does his turn with less din then with garments rolled in
blood. But I would, the zeal of God were in the Nobles, to do their part for
Christ: and I must be pardoned to write to your Lo: this: I dow not, I dare not
but speak to others, what God has done to the soul of his poor, afflicted,
exiled prisoner: his comfort is more then I ever knew before, he has sealed
the honorable cause I now suffer for, and I shall not believe that Christ will
put his Amen and ring upon an imagination: he has made all his promises good
to me, and has filled up all the blanks with his own hand: I would not
exchange my bonds with the plaistered joy of this whole world. It has pleased
him to make a sinner the like of me, an ordinary banquetter in his house of
wine, with that royal Princely one Christ Jesus. O what weighing! O what
telling is in his love! how sweet must he be, when that black and Burdensome
tree, his own cross, is so perfumed with joy and gladness! O for help to lift
him up by praises, on his royal throne! I seek no more but that his name may
be spread abroad in me, that meekle good may be spoken of Christ on my behalf:
this being done, my losses, place, stipend, credit, case, and Liberty, shall
all be made up to my full contentment, and joy of heart. I will be confident
your Lo: Will go on in the strength of the Lord and keep Christ and avouch
him, that he may read your name publikly before men and Angels. I will entreat
your Lo: to exhort and encourage that Nobleman your Chief to do the same: but
I am woe, many of you find a new wisdom, which deserves nor such a name; it
were better that men should see, that their wisdom be holy and their holiness
wise: I must be bold to desire your Lo: To add to your former favors to me
(for the which your Lo: has a prisoners blessing and prayers) this, that ye
would be pleased to befriend my brother, now suffering for the same cause. For
he is to dwell nigh your Lo: Bounds; your Lo: word and countenance may help
him. Thus recommending your Lo: to the saving grace and tender mercy of Christ
Jesus our Lord. I rest.

Aberd. March. 9. 1637. Your Lo: obliged Servant in Christ, S. R.

To Mr. WILLIAM DALGLISH, Minister of the Gospel. (18)
Reverend and Dear Brother,
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am well, my Lord Jesus is Kinder to me
then ever he was, it pleases him to dine and sup with his afflicted prisoner,
a King feasteth me, and his spiknard casts a sweet smell. Put Christ's love to
the trial and put upon it burdens, and then it will appear love indeed: we
employ not his love, and therefore we know it not. I verily count more of the
sufferings of my Lord, then of this worlds lustred and overguilded glory: I
dare not say but my Lord Jesus has fully recompensed my sadness, with his
joys: my losses, with his own presence: I find it a sweet and rich thing to
exchange my sorrows with Christ's joys, my afflictions with that sweet peace I
have with himself. Brother this is his own truth I now suffer for, he has
sealed my sufferings with his own comforts; and I know he will not put his seal
upon blank paper; his seals are not dumb, nor delusive, to confirm imaginations
and lies. Go on my dear Brother in the strength of the Lord, not fearing man
that is a worm, or the son of man that will die. Providence has a thousand
keys to open a thousand sundry doors, for the deliverance of his own, when it
is even come to a conclamatum est: Let us be faithful and care for our own
part, which is to do and suffer for him, and lay Christ's part on himself, and
leave it there: duties are ours, events are the Lord's: when our faith goes to
meddle with events and to hold a court (if I may so speak) upon Gods providence
(and begineth to say, how will Thou do this, and that?) we lose ground: we have
nothing to do there, it is our part to, let the Almighty exerce his own
office, and stir his own helm: there is nothing left to us but to see how we
may be approved of him, and how we may roll the weight of our weak souls (in
weldoing) upon him who is God Omnipotent: and when, what we thus essay,
miscarrieth; it shall neither be our sin nor cross. Brother, remember the
Lord's word to Peter, Simon, love thou me? Feed my sheep: no greater
testimony of our love to Christ can be, then to feed painfully and faithfully
his lambs. I am in no better neighborhood with the Ministers here then before;
they cannot endure that any speak of me, or to me: thus I am in the mean time
silent, (which is my greatest grief.) Dr Barron has often disputed with me,
especially about Arminian-controversies, and for the Ceremonies: three yokings
laid him by, and I have not been troubled with him since: now he has appointed
a dispute before witnesses; I trust Christ and truth shall do for themselves.
I hope Brother ye will help my people, and write to me what ye hear the Bishop
is to do to them: Grace be with you.

Aberd. Your Brother in bonds. S. R.

To Mr HUGH MC KAILL, Minister of the Gospel. (19)
Reverend and Dear Brother.
I bless you for your Letter: he is come down as rain upon the mowen grass, he
has revived my withered root, and he is as the dew of herbs, I am most secure
in this prison, salvation is for walls in it, and what think ye of these walls?
he makes the dry plant to bud as the lilie, and to blossom as Lebanon. the
great husband man's blessing comes down upon the plants of righteousness, who
may say this (my dear Brother) if I, his poor exiled stranger, and prisoner may
not say it? Howbeit all the world should be silent I cannot hold my peace. O
how many black counts has Christ and I rounded over together, in the house of
my pilgrimage! and how sat a portion has he given to a hungry soul? I had
rather have Christ's four-hours, then have dinner and Supper both in one from
any other; his dealing, and the way of his judgments pass finding out: No
preaching, no book; no learning could give me that, which I behooved to come
and get in this Town, but what of all this, if I were not misted, confounded,
and astonished how to be thankful, and how to get him praised for evermore?
And which is more, he has been pleased to pain me with his love, and my pain
grows through want of real possession. Some have written to me that I am
possibly too joyful of the cross, but my joy over-leapeth the cross, it is
bounded and terminat upon Christ: I know the sun will over-cloud and eclipse,
and I shall again be put to walk in the shadow, but Christ must be welcome to
come and go as he thinks meet; yet he would be more welcome to me I trow, to
come then go, and I hope he pitieth and pardons me, in casting apples to me,
at such a fainting time as this, holy and blessed is his name. It was not my
flattering of Christ, that drew a kiss from his mouth, but he would send me as
a spy into this wilderness of suffering, to see the land, and to try the
foord, and I cannot make a lie of Christ's cross; I can report nothing but good
both of him, and it, lest others should faint. I hope when a change comes, to
cast anchor at midnight upon the rock (which he has taught me to know in this
day light) whether I may run, when I must say my lesson without book, and
believe in the dark. I am sure it is sin to tarrow of Christ's good meat, and
not to eat when he says, eat O welbeloved and, drink abundantly. If he bear me
on his back, or carry me in his arms over this water, I hope for grace to set
down both my feet on dry ground, when the way is better: but this is slippery
ground, my Lord thought good I should go by an hold, and lean on my
welbeloved's shoulder: it is good to be ever taking from him. I desire he may
get the fruit of praises for dating, and thus dandling me upon his knee, and I
may give my bond of thankfulness; sobeing I have Christ's back-bond again for
my relief, that I shall be strengthened by his powerful grace, to pay my vows
to him. But truly I find we have the advantage of the brae upon our enemies,
we are more then conquerours through him who has loved us, and they know not
wherein our strength lies. Pray for me, grace be with you.

Aberd. Your Brother in Christ, S. R.

To my Lady Boyd. (20)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: the Lord has brought me to Aberd: where I
see God in few. This town has been advised upon of purpose for me: It
consists either of Papists, or men of Gallio's naughty faith, it is counted
wisdom in the most, not to countenance a confined Minister, but I find Christ
neither strange nor unkind; for I have found many faces smile upon me since I
came hither. I am heavy and sad, considering what is betwixt the Lord and my
soul, which none sees but he. I find men have mistaken me, it would be no art
(as I now see) to spin small, and make hypocrisy, seem a goodly web, and to
go through the market as a saint among men, and yet steal quietly to hell,
without observation: So easy is it to deceive men. I have disputed whether or not I ever knew any thing of Christianity, save the letters of that name: Men
see but as men, and they call ten twenty, and twenty, an hundred, but O to be
approved of God in the heart, and in sincerity, is not an ordinary mercy: my
neglects while I had a pulpit, and other things whereof I am ashamed to speak,
meet me now, so, as God makes an honest cross, my daily sorrow, and for fear
of scandal and stumbling, I must hide this day of the law's pleading: I know
not, if this court kept within my soul, be fenced in Christ's name. If
certainty of salvation were to be bought, God knows, if I had ten earths, I
would not prig with God. like a fool, I believed, under suffering for Christ,
that I my self should keep the key of Christ's treasures, and take out
comforts, when I listed, and eat, and be fat: But I see now, a sufferer for
Christ, will be made to know himself, and will be holden at the door, as well
as another poor sinner; and will be fain to eat with the bairns, and to take
the by-board, and glad so: my blessing on the cross of Christ, that has made
me see this. Oh if we could take pains for the Kingdom of heaven, but we sit
down upon some ordinary marks of God's children; thinking we have as much as
will seperat us from a Reprobat, and thereupon we tak the play, and cry
Holy Day: and thus the devil casts water on our fire, and blunteth our zeal
and care: but I see heaven is not at the next door: and I see howbeit my
challenges be many; I suffer for Christ, and dare hazard my salvation upon it,
for some times my Lord comes with a fair hour, and O but his love be sweet,
delightful, and comfortable! half a kiss is sweet, but our doting love will
not be content of a right to Christ, unless we get posfession; like the man who
will not be content of rights to bought land, except he get also the ridges,
and acers laid upon his back, to carry home with him. However it be, Christ is
wise, and we are fools; to be browden and fond of a pawn in the loof of our
hand: living on trust by faith, may well content us. Madam I know your La:
knows this, and that made me bold to write of it, that others might reap some
what by my bonds for the truth, for I should desire, and I aim at this, to
have my lord well spoken of and honored, howbeit he should make nothing of me,
but a bridge over a water. Thus recommending your La: your son, and children to
his grace, who has honored you with a name and room among the living in
Jerusalem, and wishing Grace to be with your La: I rest.

Aberd. Your La: in his sweetest Lord Jesus S. R.

To Mr. DAVID DICKSON, (21)
Reverend and Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I find great men, especially old friends
skar to speak for me, but my kingly and Royal Master bids me try his moyen
to the uttermost, and I shall find a friend at hand: I still depend on him,
his court is as before, the prisoner is welcome to him, the black crabbed tree
of my Lord's cross has made Christ and my soul very entire, he is my song in
the night: I am often laid in the dust with challenges and apprehensions of his
anger, and then if a mountain of iron were laid upon me, I cannot be heavier:
and with much wrestling I win in to the Kings house of wine, and for the most
part my life is joy, and such joy through his comforts, as I have been afraid
to shame my self, and to cry out, for I can scarce bear what I get: Christ
gives me a measure heaped up, pressed down, and running over: and believe it,
his love paineth me more then prison and banishment. I cannot get a gate of
Christ's love, had I known what he was keeping for me, I would never have been
so faint-hearted. In my heaviest times when all is lost, the memory of his love
makes me think Christ's gloomes are but for the fashion: I seek no more but a
vent to my wine, I am smothered and ready to burst for want of a vent. Think
not much of persecution, it is before you, but it is not as men conceive of it,
my suggared-cross forces me to say this to you, ye shall have wailed meat, the
sick bairn is often times the spilt ba^rn, ye shall command all the house. I
hope ye help a tired prisoner to pray and praise, had I but the annuell of
annuell to give to my Lord Jesus, it should ease my pain; but Alace I have
nothing to pay, he will get nothing of poor me, but I am woe I have not room
enough in my heart for such a stranger. I am not cast down to go further
North, I have good cause to work for my Master, for I am well paid before the
hand, I am not behind, howbeit I should not get one smile more, till my feet
be up within the Kings dininghall. I have gone through yours upon the Covenant,
it has edified my soul and refreshed an hungry man, I judge it sharp, sweet,
quick, and profound: take me at my word, I fear it get no lodging in Scotland.
The Brethren of Ireland write not to me; chide with them for that, I am sure
that I may give you and them a commission (and I will bide by it) that you tell
my beloved, I am sick of love. I hope in God to leave some of my rust, and
superfluites in Aberd: I cannot get an house in this town wherein to leave
drink-silver in my Master's name, save, one only, there is no sale for Christ
in the North, he is like to lie long on my hand ere any accept him. Grace be
with you.

Aberd. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To Mr MATTHEW MOWAT. (22)
REverend and dear brother, I am a very far misstaken man, if others knew how
poor my stock were, they would not think upon the like of me, but with
compassion; for I am as one kept under a strict Tutour: I would have more then
my Tutour allows upon me, but it is good that a bairns wit is not the rule
which regulateth my Lord Jesus: let him give what he will it shall ay be above
merit, and my ability to gain therewith. I would not wish a better stock (while
heaven be my stock) then to live upon credit at Christ's hands, daily borrowing:
surely running over love, that vast, hudge, boundless love of Christ (that
there is telling in for man and Angel) is the only thing, I fainest would be
in hands with: He knows I have little but the love of that love, and that I
shall be happy, suppose I never get another heaven, but only an eternal
lasting feast of that love: but suppose my wishes were poor, He is not poor;
Christ all the seasons of the year is dropping sweetness, if I had vessels I
might fill them, but my old riven, holly, and running out dish, even when I am
at the well, can bring little away: Nothing but Glory will make tight, and
fast, our looking and rifty vessels. Alace I have skailed more of Christ's
Grace, love, faith, humility, and godly sorrow, then I have brought with me.
How little of the sea can a child carry in his hand, as little dow I take
away, of my great sea, my boundless and Runing-over-Christ-Jesus: I have not
lighted upon the right gate of putting Christ to the bank, and making my self
rich with him: my misguiding and childish trafficking, with that matchless
pearl, That heaven's jewel, the jewel of the fathers delights, has put me to
a great loss. O that he would take a loan of me, and my stock, and put his
name in all my bonds, and serve himself Heir to the poor mean portion I have:
and be countable for the talent himself! gladly would I put Christ in my room,
to guide all; and let me be but a servant to run errands, and do by his
direction, let me be his interdicted heir: Lord Jesus, work upon my minority,
and let him win a pupil's blessing. Oh how would I rejoice to have this work of
my salvation legally fastened upon Christ! a back-bond of my Lord Jesus that it
should be forthcoming to the Orphan, should be my happiness: dependency on
Christ, were my surest way: if Christ were my bottom I were sure enough. I
thought guiding of grace had been no art, I thought it would come of will; but
I would spill my own heaven yet, if I had not burdened Christ with All: I but
lend my bare name to the sweet covenant, Christ behind and before, and on
either side, makes all sure: God will not take an Arminian-cautioner Freewill,
a weathercock, turning at a serpents tongue, a Tutor that couped our father
Adam unto us, and brought down the house, and sold the Land, and sent the
father, and mother, and all the bairns through the earth, to beg their bread:
nature in the Gospel has cracked credit. O well to my poor soul for evermore,
that my Lord called grace to the council and put Christ Jesus with free merits,
and the blood of God foremost in the chase, to draw sinners after a ransomer. O
what a sweet block was it, by way of buying and selling, to give and tell down
a ransom for grace, and glory to Dyvours! O would to my Lord, I could cause
paper and ink speak the worth and excellency, the high, and loud praises of a
Brother-ransomer! O the Ransomer needs not my report, but oh if he would take
it, and make use of it: I should be happy if I had an errand to this world but
for some few years, to spread proclamations and out-crys, and love letters, of
the highness [the highness for evermore] the glory (the glory for evermore) of
the Ransomer, whose clothes were wet, and died in blood; howbeit that after I
had done that, my soul and body should go back to the mother nothing, that
their Creator brought them once out from, as from their beginning. But why
should I pine away, and pain my self with wishes, and not believe rather, that
Christ will hire such an outcast as I am, a masterlesse-body, put out of the
house, by the sons of my mother, and give me employment, and a calling, one
way, or other, to out Christ, and his wares, to country buyers, and propose
Christ unto, and press him upon some poor souls, that fainer then their life
would receive him. You complain heavily, of your short coming in practice, and
venturing on suffering for Christ: you have many marrowes. For the first, I
would not put you off sense of wretcheduesse, hold on, Christ never yet slew a
sighhing, groaning child; more of that would make you won goods, and a meet
prey for Christ, Alace I have too little of it! For venturing on suffering; I
had not so much free gier, when I came to Christ's camp, as to buy a sword, a
wonder that Christ should not laugh, at such a soldier: I am no better yet;
but faith lives and spends upon our Captains charges, who is able to pay for
all: we need not pity him, he is rich enough. Ye desire me also not to mistake
Christ under a mask, I bless you and thank God for it, but alace masked or
barefaced, kissing or glooming I mistake him! yea I mistake him furthest when
the mask is off; for then I play me with his sweetness: I am like a child that
has a golden book, that plays more with the ribbens, and the guilding, and
the picture in the first page; then reads the contents of it. Certainly, if
my desires, to my welbeloved, were fulfilled, I could provoke devils, and
crosses, and the world, and tentations to the fields: but oh my poor weakness,
makes me, lie behind the bush and hide me, Remember my service and my blessing
to my Lord; I am mindful of him as I am able: desire him from a prisoner, to
come and visit my good master, and feel but the smell of his love: it sets him
well howbeit he be young, to make Christ his garland. I could not wish him in a
better case, then in a fever of love-sickness for Christ: Remember my bonds,
the Lord Jesus be with your spirit.

To WILLIAM HALLIDAY. (23)
Loving friend.
I Received your letter: I wish ye take pains for salvation, mistaken grace,
and somewhat like conversion, which is not conversion, is the sadest and most
doleful thing in the world: make sure of salvation, and Lay the foundation
sure, for many are beguiled: Put a low price upon world's clay, put a high
price upon Christ, temptations will come, but if they be not made welcome by
you ye have the best of it: be jealous over your self, and your own heart, and
keep touches with God: let him not have a faint and feeble soldier of you,
fear not to back Christ, for he will conquer and overcome: let no man skar at
Christ, for I have no quarrels at his cross. He and his cross are two good
guests, and worth the lodging: men would fain have Christ good cheap, but the
market will not come down: acquaint your self with prayer, make Christ your
captain and your armor, make conscience of sinning when no eye sees you.
grace be with you.

Aberd. Yours in Ch: Jesus. S. R.

To a Gentle Woman after the Death of her Husband. (24)
DEar and loving sister, I know ye are minding your sweet country and not
taking your Innes [the place of your banishmet] for your home; this life is not
worthy to be the thatch or outer wall of your Lord Jesus his paradise, that he
did sweat for to you, and that he keeps for you: Short, and silly, and
sandblinde were our hope, if it could not look over the water to our best
heritage, and if it stayed only at home about the doors of our clay-house. I
marvel not my dear sister, that ye complain that ye come short of your old
wrestlings you had for a blessing, and that now you find it not so, bairns are
but hired to learn their lesson when they first go to school; and it is enough
that these who run a race see the gold only at the starting place; and
possibly they see little more of it, or nothing at all, till they win to the
rink's-end and get the gold in the loof of their hand: Cur Lord makes
delicates and dainties of his sweet presence and love-visits to his own, but
Christ's love under a veil is love, if ye get Christ, howbeit not the sweet and
pleasant way you would have him, it is enough, for the wel-beloved comes not
our way, he must wail his own gate himself. For worldly things, seeing they
are medows and fair flowers in your way to heaven, a smell in the by-going is
sufficient: he that would reckon and tell all the stones in his way, in a
journey of three or four hundred miles, and write up in his count book all the
herbs, and flowers growing in his way, might come short of his journey, you
cannot stay in your inch of time to lose your day (seeing you are in haste, and
the night and your afternoon will not bide you) in setting your heart on this
vain world, it were your wisdom to read your count book and to have in
readin^s^ your bussinesse against the time you come to deaths waterside: I
know your lodging is taken, your forerunner Christ, has not forgotten that,
and therefore you must set your self to your one thing, which ye cannot well
want. In that our Lord took your husband to himself, I know it was that he
might make room for himself: he cuteth off your love to the creature, that ye
might learn that God only is the right owner of your love, sorrow, loss,
sadness, death, or the worst things that are, except sin: but Christ knows
well what to make of them, and can put his own in the crosses common, that we
shall be obliged to affliction, and thank God who learned us to make our
acquaintance with such a rough companion, who can hale us to Christ: you must
learn to make evils your great good, and to spin out comforts, peace, joy,
communion with Christ, out of your troubls that are Christ's wooers sent to
speak for you to himself. It is easy to get good words, and a comfortable
message from our Lord, even from such rough sergeants, as diverse temptations:
Thanks to God for crosses, when we count and reckon our losses in seeking God,
we find godliness is great gain. Great partners of a shipfull of gold, are
glad to see the ship come to the harbor: surely we and our Lord Jesus
together, have a shipfull of gold coming home, and our gold is in that ship.
Some are so in love (or rather in lust) with this life, that they sell their
part of the ship, for a little thing; I would counsel you to buy hope, but sell
it not, and give not away your crosses for nothing, the inside of Christ's
cross is white and joyful, and the far end of the black cross is a fair and
glorious heaven of ease: and seeing Christ has fastened heaven to the far end
of the cross, and he will not loose the knot him self, and none else can, (for
when Christ casts a knot all the world cannot loose it) let us then count it
exceeding joy when we fall into diverse temptations. Thus recommending you to
the tender mercy, and grace of our Lord I rest.

Aberd. Your Loving Brother. S. R.

To JOHN GORDON Of Card nes Younger. (25)
Honored and Dear Brother.
I Wrote of late to you: multitudes of letters burden me now. I am refreshed
with your letter: I exhort you in the bowels of Christ, set to work for your
soul, and let these bear weight with you, and ponder them seriously. 1. Weeping
and gnas^ing of teeth in utter-darkness, or heaven's joy. 2. Think what ye
would give for an hour when ye shall lie like dead, cold, blackned clay. 3.
there is sand in your glass yet, and your sun is not gone down. 4. Consider
what joy and peace is in Christ's service. 5. Think what advantage it will be to
have Angels, the world, life, and death, crosses, yea and devils, all for you,
as the Kings sergeants, and servants, to do your bussinesse. 6. To have mercy
on your seed, and a blessing on your house. 7. To have true honor, and a name
on earth: that casts a sweet smell. 8. How ye will rejoice when Christ lays
down your head under his chinne, and betwixt his breasts, and dries your face,
and welcometh you to glory and happyness? 9. Imagine, what pain, and torture is
a guilty conscience? What slavery to carry the Devils unhonest loads? 10. Sins
joys are but night-dreames, thoughts, vapors, imaginations and shadows. 11.
What dignity it is to be a son of God? 12. Dominion and mastery over
tentations, over the world, and sin. 13. That your enemies should be the tail,
and you the head. For your bairns now at their rest, I speak to you and your
wife (and cause her read this.) 1. I am a witness of Barbara's glory in heaven.
2. For the rest, I write it under my hand, there are days coming on Scotland,
when barren wombs and dry breasts, and childless parents, shall be pronounced
blessed: they are then in the lee of the harbor, ere the storm come on. 3.
They are not lost to you, that are laid up in Christ's treasury in heaven. 4. At
the Resurrection ye shall meet with them, there they are sent before, but not
sent away. 5. Your Lord loves you, who is homely to take and give, borrow and
lend. 6. Let not bairns be your Idols, for God will be jealouse, and take away
the Idol, because he is greedy of your love wholly. I bless you, your wife and
children. Grace for evermore be with you.

Aberd. Your Loving Pastor. S. R.

To JOHN GORDON, Of Cardoness elder. (26)
Honorable and dearest in the Lord. Your Letter has refreshed my soul. My joy
is fulfilled, if Christ and ye be fast together: ye are my joy and my crown: ye
know I have recommended his love to you. I defy the world, Satan, and sin, His
love has neither brim nor bottom in it. My dearest in Christ, I write my
souls desire to you: heaven is not at the next door: I find Christianity an
hard task: set to it in your evening: we would all keep both Christ and our
right eye, our right hand and foot; but it will not be with us. I beseech you,
by the mercies of God; and your compearance before Christ, look Christ's count
book and your own together, and collation them: give the remnant of your time
to your soul: this great Idol-god, the world, will be lying in white ashes, in
the day of your compearance; and why should night-dreames, and day-shaddowes
and water-froth, and May-flowers run away with your heart: when we win to the
waterside, and black deaths river brinke, and put our foot in the boat, we
shall laugh at our folly, Sir, I recommend you unto the thoughts of death, and
how ye would wish your soul to be, when ye shall lie cold, blew, ill-smelling
clay. For any hireling to be intruded, I being the Kings prisoner can not say
much, but as Gods minister I desire you to read, Act. 2, 15, 16. to the end,
and Act. 6. 2, 3, 4, 5. and ye shall find God's people, should have a voice in
choosing Church-rulers and teachers. I shall be sorry if willingly ye shall give
way to his unlawful intrusion upon my labors: The only wise God direct you.
God's grace be with you.

Aberd. Your loving Pastor, S. R.

To EARLESTOUN YOUNGER. (27)
Much honored and welbeloved in the Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you. Your letters give a dash to my laziness in
writing: I must first tell you, there is not such a glassie, Icie, and slippery
piece of way, betwixt you and heaven as Youth: I have experience to say with me
here, and seal what I assert: the old ashes of the sins of my youth, are new
fire of sorrow to me: I have seen the Devil, as it were, dead and buried, and
yet rise again and be a worse Devil then ever he was. Therefore, my brother,
beware of a green young Devil that has never been buried: the Devil in his
flowers (I mean, the hot fiery lusts and passions of youth) is much to be
feared: better yoke with an old gray-haired, withered, dry Devil: For in youth
he finds dry sticks, and dry coals, and an hot hearth-stone, and how soon can
he with his flint cast fire, and with his bellows blow it up, and fire the
house: sanctified thoughts, thoughts made conscience of, and called in, and
kept in aw, are green fuel, that burn not, and are a water for Satan's coal.
Yet I must tell you, the whole saints now triumphant in heaven and standing
before the throne, are nothing but Christ's forlorn and beggarly Dyvours: What
are they but a pack of redeemed sinners? But their redemption is not only past
the seals, but completed, and yours is on the wheels, and in doing: All
Christ's good bairns go to heaven with a broken brow, and with a crooked leg.
Christ has an advantage of you, and I pray you let him have't, he shall find
employment for his calling in you: if it were not with you as you write, grace
should find no sale nor market in you; but ye must be content to give Christ
somewhat ado: I am glad that he is employed that way: let your bleeding soul,
and your sores be put in the hand of this expert physician: let young and
strong corruptions, and his free grace be yoked together, and let Christ and
your sins deal it betwixt them. I will be loath to put you off your fears, and
your sense of deadness: (I wish it were more) there be some wounds of that
nature, that their bleeding should not be soon stoped: ye must take a house
beside the Physician, it shall be a miracle if ye be the first sick man he put
away uncured, and worse then he found you: nay, nay, Christ is honest, and in
that flyting free with sinners (Ioh. 6. 37. And him that comes to me, I will
in no, case cast out) Take ye that: It cannot be presumption to take that as
your own, when ye find your wounds stound you, presumption is ever whole at the
heart, and has but the truant-sickness, and groaneth only for the fashion:
faith has sense of sickness, and looks like a friend to the promise, and
looking to Christ therein, is glad to see a known face. Christ is as full a
feast, as ye can have to hunger: nay Christ, I say, is not a full man's
leavings; his mercy sends always a letter of defiance to all your sins, if
there were ten thousand more of them. I grant you, it is a hard matter for a
poor hungry man, to win his meat upon hidden Christ, for then the key of his
pantrie door, and of the house of wine is a seeking, and cannot be had; but
hunger must break through ironlocks. I be moan them not who can make a din, and
all the fields ado, for a Lost Savior: ye must let him hear it (to say so)
upon both the sides of his head, when he hides himself: it is no time then to
be bird-mouth'd and patient. Christ is rare indeed, and a delicate to a sinner;
he is a miracle and a world's wonder, to a seeking and a weeping sinner, but
yet such a miracle, as will be seen by them, who will come and see: the seeker,
and sigher is at last a singer and enjoyer: nay, I have seen a dumb man get an
alms from Christ. He that can tell his tale, and send such a letter to heaven,
as he has sent to Aberden, it is very like he will come speed with Christ. It
bodeth Gods mercy to complain heartily for sin. Let wrestling be with Christ
till he say, How is it, Sir, that I cannot be quite of your bills, and your
misl^arned cries? And then hope for Christ's blessing, and his blessing is better
then other ten blessings. Think not shame because of your guiltiness; necessity
must not blush to beg; it stands you hard to want Christ, and therefore that
which idle on-waiting cannot do, mis^ur^ured crying and knocking will do. And
for doubtings, because ye are not as ye were long since with your master,
consider three things. 1. What if Christ had such tottering thoughts of the
bargain, of the new covenant, betwixt you and him, as you have. 2. Your heart
is not the compass Christ saileth by: He will give you leave to sing as ye
please: But he will not dance to your daft spring. It is not referred to you,
and your thoughts, what Christ will do with the charters betwixt you and him,
your own misbeleef has torn them, but he has the principal in heaven, with
himself; your thoughts are no parts of the New covenant, dreams change not
Christ. 3. Doubtings are your sins; but they are Christ's d^ugges, and
ing^^dients, that the Phisician makes use of, for the cu^ing of your pride. Is
it not suitable for a beggar, to say, at meat, God re^ard the winners? for then
he says, he knows who bears the charges of the house. It is also meet ye
should know by experience, that faith is not natur's il gotten bastard, but
your Lords free gift, that lay in the womb of Gods free grace, praised be the
winner. I may add a 4. In the passing of your bill, and your charters, when
they went through the Mediators great seal, and were concluded, faith's advice
was not sought: says has not a vote beside Christ's merits, blood, blood, dear
blood that came from your cautioners holy body, makes that sure work. The use
then which ye have of faith now, (having already closed with Jesus Christ for
justification) is, to take out a copy of your pardon; and so ye have peace with
God, upon the account of Christ: for since faith apprehends pardon, but never
pays a penny for it, no marvel that Salvation does not die and live, ebb,
or flow, with the working of faith, but because it is your Lords honor to
believe his mercy, and his fidelity, it is infinite goodness in our Lord, that
misbeleef gives a dash to our Lords glory, and not to our Salvation: and so
who ever want (yea, howbeit God here bear with the want of what we are obliged
to give him, even the glory of his grace, by believing, yet) a poor covenanted
sinner wants not: but if guiltiness were removed, doubtings would find no
friend, nor life; and yet faith is to believe the removal of guiltiness, in
Christ. A reason why ye get less now (as ye think) then before (as I take it)
is, because at our first conversion, our Lord puts the meat in young bairns
mouths, with his own hand, but when we grow to some further perfection, we
must take heaven by violence, and take by violence from Christ, what we get;
and he can, and does hold, because he will have us to draw. Remenber now ye
must, live upon violent plucking, laziness is a greater fault now, then long
since; we love always to have the pape put in our mouth. No for my self;
alace, I am not the man I go for in this nation men have not just weights to
weigh me (...) (...), but I am a li^^y^^^less Body, and ove^ (...) (...) ^ ^
whom (...) (...) (...) If Christ would refer the matter to (...) (in his
presence I speak it) I might think shame to vote my own salvation: I think
Christ might say, think^^ thou not shame to claim heaven, who does so (...) for
it I am very often so, that I know not whether (...) ^^nk o^ swine in the
water; I find my self a bag of light froth; I would bear no weight, (but
vanities and nothing's weigh in Christ's balance) if my Lord cast not in
borrowed weight and metal, even Christ's righteousness, to weigh for me: the
stock I have is not mine own, I am but the merchand that traffiques with other
folks goods, if my creditor Christ would take from me what he has lent, I
would not long keep the causey; but Christ has made it m^^e and his: I think
it manhood to play the coward, and jouke in the lee-side of Christ, and thus I
am not only saved from my enemies, but I obtain the victory. I am so empty
that I think it were an almes-deed in Christ, if he would win a poor prisoners
blessing for evermore, and fill me with his love. I complain when Christ
comes, he comes always to fetch fire, he is ever in haste, he may not tarry;
and poor (...) [a beggarly Dyvour,] get but a standing visit, and a standing
kiss, and but, how do thou? in the by-going. I dare not say, he is lordly
because he is made a King now, at the right hand of God, or is grown miskenning
and dry to his poor friends, [for he cannot make more of his kisses then they
are worth:] but I think it my happiness to love the love of Christ; and when he
goes away, the memory of his sweet presence is like a feast in a dear summer.
I have comfort in this, that my soul desires that every hour of my
imprisonment were a company of heavenly tongues, to praise him on my behalf;
howbeit my bonds were prolonged for many hundred years. O that I could be the
man, who could procure my Lords glory to flow like a full sea, and blow like a
mighty wind upon all the four Airths of Scotland, England and Ireland! O if I
could write a book of his praises! O fairest among the sons of men, why stayest
thou so long away? O heavens, move fast! O time, run, run, and hasten the
marriage-day, for love is tormented with delays! O Angels, O Seraphims who
stand before him, O blessed Spirits who now see his face, set him on high, for
when ye have worn your harps in his praises, all is too little, and is nothing,
to cast the smell of the praise of that fair flower, that fragrant rose of
Sharon, through many worlds! Sir, take my hearty commendations to him, and tell
him that I am sick of love. Grace be with you.

Aberd. June 16. 1637. Yours in his sweet L. Jesus, S. R.

To his Honored and Dear Brother, ALEXAND: GORDON of KNOCKGRAY. (28)
Dearest and truly honored Brother,
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have seen no letter from you since I came
to Aberdeen; I will no tinterpret it to be forgetfulness. I am here in a fair
prison, Christ is my sweet and honorable fellow-prisoner, and I his sad and
joyful Lordprisoner, [if I may speak so.] I think this cross becomes me well,
and is suitable to me in respect of my duty to suffer for Christ; howbeit not
in regard of my deserving, to be thus honored. However it be, I see Christ is
strong, even lying in the dust, in prison, and in banishment. Losses and
disgraces are the wheels of Christ's triumphing chariot. In the sufferings of
his own saints, as he intends their good, so he intends his own glory, and
that is the butte his arrows shoot at, and Christ shoots not at the tovers,
he hitteth what he purposes to hit: Therefore he does make his own feckless
and weak nothing's, and these who are the contempt of men, a new sharp
threshing instrument having teeth, to thresh the mountains, and beat them
small, and to make the hills as chaff, and to fan them. Isa. 51: 15, 16. What
harder stuff, or harder grain for threshing out, then high and rockie
mountains? But the Saints are Gods threshing instruments to beat them all in
chaff: are we not Gods leem vessels, and yet when they cast us over an house,
we are not broken in sheards: we creep in under our Lords wings in the great
shower, and the water cannot go through these wings. It is folly then for men
to say, this is not Christ's plea, he will lose the wed-fee, men are like to
beguile him: that were indeed a strange play. Nay I dare pledge my soul, and
lay it in pawn on Christ's side of it, and be half-tiner half-winner with my
Master: Let fools laugh the foolslaughter, and scorn Christ, and bid the
weeping captives in Babylon, sing us one of the songs of Zion, play a spring to
cheer up your sad-hearted God: We may sing upon lucks head before hand, even in
our winter-storme, in the expectation of a summer-sun at the turn of the year:
no created powers in hell or out of hell, can mar our L. Jesus his music, nor
spill our song of joy: let us then be glad and rejoice in the salvation of our
Lord; for faith had never yet cause to have wet cheeks, and hingingdown brows,
or to droup or die: what can aile faith, seeing Christ suffers himself, (with
reverence to him be it spoken) to be commanded by it; and Christ commands all
things: faith may dance, because Christ sings, and we may come in the Quite and
lift our hoarse and rough voices, and chirp, and sing, and shout for joy with
our Lord Jesus. We see oxen go to the shambles leaping and startling; We see
Gods fed oxen prepared for the day of slaughter, go dancing and singing down
to the black chambers of hell; and why should we go to heaven weeping, as if
we were like to fall down through the earth for sorrow. If God were dead (if I
may speak so, with reverence of him ho lives for ever and ever) and Christ
buried, and rotten among the worms, we might have cause to look like dead
folks; but, the Lord lives and blessed be the rock of our salvation, Psalm. 18:
46. None have right to joy but we, for joy is sown for us, and an ill summer or
harvest will not spill the crop. The children of this world have much robbed
joy that is not well come: It is no good sport they laugh at: They steall joy,
as it were, from God; for he commands them to mourn and howl: Then let us
claim our ^eel-come and lawfully conquished joy. My dear Brother, I cannot but
speak what I have felt, seeing my Lord Jesus has broken a box of spikenard
upon the head of his poor prisoner, and it is hard to hide a sweet smell; it is
pain to smother Christ's love, it will be out; whether we will or not. If we did
but speak according to the matter; a cross for Christ should have another name;
yea a cross, especially when he comes with his arms full of joys, is the
happiest hard tree that ever was laid upon my weak shoulders. Christ and his
cross together are sweet company and a blessed couple. My prison is my palace
my sorrow is with child of joy, my losses are rich losses, my pain easy pain,
my heavy days are holy and happy days. I may tell a new tale of Christ to my
friend. Oh if I could make a love-song of him, and could commend Christ and
tune his praises aright! O if I could set all tongues in great Britain and
Ireland, to work, to help me to sing a new song of my welbeloved! O if I could
be a bridge over a water for my Lord Jesus to walk upon and keep his feet dry!
O if my poor bit heaven could go betwixt my Lord and blasphemy and dishonor!
(upon condition he loved me] O that my heart could say this word and bide by it
for ever. Is it not great art and incomparable wisdom in my Lord, who can bring
forth such fair apples, out of this crabbed tree of the cross! nay my fathers
never enough admired providence, can make a fair feast out of a black Devil:
nothing can come wrong to my Lord in his sweet working. I would even fall sound
a sleep in Christ's arms, and my sinful head on his holy breast, while he
kisseth me; were is not that often the wind turns to the north, and whiles my
sweet Lord Jesus, is, that he will neither give nor take, borrow nor lend with
me: I complain he is not social, I half call him proud and lordly of his
company, and nice of his looks; which yet is not true. It would content me to
give, howbeit he should not take; I should be content to want his kisses at
such times, providing he would be content to come near hand and take my wersh,
dry and feckless kisses: But at that time he will not be entreated, but lets a
poor soul stand still and knock, and never let it on him that he hears; and
then the old leavings and broken meat, and dry sighs, are greater cheer then I
can tell: all I have then, is, that howbeit the law and wrath have gotten a
decret against me, I yet lippen that meekle good in Christ as to get a
suspension, and to bring my cause in reasoning again before my welbeloved: I
desire but to be heard. And at last he is content to come, and agree the matter
with a fool, and forgive freely, because he is God. Oh if men would glorify him
and taste of Christ's sweetness. Brother, ye have need to be busy with Christ,
for this whorish-Kirk: I fear Christ cast water upon Scotlands coal; nay I know
Christ and his wife will be heard, he will plead for the broken covenant. Arm
you against that time. Grace be with you.

Aberd. June. 16, 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To the Lady Kilconqhuair. (29.)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am glad to hear that you have your face
home-ward toward your fathers house, now when so many are for a home nearer
hand: but your Lord calls you to another life and glory, then is to be found
hereaway: and therefore I would counsel you to make sure the charters, and
rights, which ye have to Salvation. You came to this life about a necessary and
weighty business, to tryst with Christ anent your precious soul, and the
eternal salvation of it: this is the most necessary business ye have in this
life, and your other adoes beside this, are but toys and feathers, and dreams,
and fancies: this is the greatest haste and should be done first. Means are
used in the Gospel to draw on a meeting betwixt Christ and you: if ye neglect
your part of it, it is, as if you would tear the contract before Christ's eyes,
and give up the match, that there shall be no more communing of that business.
I know other lovers beside Christ are in suit of you, and your soul wants not
many wooers, but I pray you make a chaste virgin of your soul, and let it love
but one: most worthy is Christ alone of all your souls love, howbeit your love
were higher then the heaven and deeper then the lowest of this earth, and
broader then this world: many, alas too many, make a common strumpet of their
soul, for every lover that comes to the house. Marriage with Christ would put
your love, and your heart by the gate, out of the way, and out of the eyes of
all other unlawful suitors; and then you had a ready answer for all others, I
am already promised away to Christ, the match is concluded, my soul has a
husband already, and it cannot have two husbands. Oh if the world did but know
what a smell the ointments of Christ cast, and how ravishing his beauty, even
the beauty of the fairest of the sons of men is, and how sweet and powerful his
voice is, the voice of that one welbeloved! Certainly where Christ comes, he
runs away with the souls love, so that they cannot command it. I would far
rather look but through the hole of Christ's door, to see but the one half of his
fairest, and most comely face [for he looks like heaven] suppose I should
never win in to see his excellency and glory to the full; then to enjoy the
flower, the bloome, and chiefest excellency of the glory, and riches, of ten
worlds. Lord send me for my part but the meanest share of Christ, that can be
given to any of the indwellers of the new Jerusalem; But I know my Lord is no
niggard: He can, and it becomes him well to give more, then my narrow soul can
receive. If there were ten thousand, thousand millions of worlds, and as many
heavens full of men and Angels, Christ would not be pinched to supply all our
wants, and to fill us all. Christ is a well of life, but who knows how deep
it is to the bottom? This soul of ours has love, and cannot but love some fair
one: And O what a fair one, what an only one, what an excellent lovely
ravishing one is Jesus! Put the beauty of ten thousand thousand worlds of
Paradises like the garden of Eden in one, put all trees, all flowers, all
smells, all colors, all tastes, all joys, all sweetness, all lovelyness is
one, O what a fair and excellent thing would that be! and yet it should be
less, to that fair and dearest welbeloved Christ then one drop of rain to the
whole seas, rivers, lakes, and fourtains of ten thousand earths. O but Christ
is heavens wonder and earths wonder! what marvel that his bride says, Cant 5:
v. 16. He is altogether lovely. Oh that black souls will not come, and fetch
all then love to this fair one! O if I could invite and persuade thousands, and
ten thousand times ten thousand of Adam's sons; to flock about my Lord Jesus,
and to come and take their fill of love! Oh pity, for evermore, that there
should be such an one as Christ Jesus, so boundless, so bottomless, and so
incomparable in infinite excellency, and sweetness, and so few to take him. Oh,
oh, ye poor, dry and dead souls, why will ye not come hither with your toom
vessels, and your empty souls, to this huge, and fair, and deep, and sweet well
of life, and fill all your toom vessels! Oh that Christ should be so large in
sweetness, and worth, and we so narrow, so pinched so ebb, and so void of all
happiness, and yet men will not take him! They lose their love miserably who
will not bestow it upon this lovely one. Alas, these five thousand years,
Adam's fools, his waster-heirs, have been wasting and lavishing out their love,
and their affections upon black lovers, and black harlots: upon bits of dead
creatures, and broken idols, upon this, and that feckless creature, and have
not brought their love, and their heart to Jesus. O pity, that fairness has so
few lovers! O woe, woe to the fools of this world; who run by Christ to other
lovers! Oh misery, misery, misery, that comeliness can scarce get three, or
four hearts in a town, or a country! Oh that there is so much spoken and so
much written and so much thought of creature-vanity, and so little spoken, so
little written, so little thought of my great, and incomprehensible, and
never-enough-wondered-at Lord Jesus. Why should I not curse this forlorn, and
wretched world, that suffers my Lord Jesus to lie his alone? O damned souls,
O miskenning world, O blind, O beggarly, and poor souls, O bewitched fools,
what aileth you at Christ, that you run so from him? I dare not challenge
providence, that there are so few buyers, and so little sale for such an
excellent one as Christ. O the depth, and O the hight of my Lords ways, that
pass finding out. But oh if men would once be wise, and not fall so in love
with their own hell, as to pass by Christ, and misken him! But let us come
near, and fill our selves with Christ, and let his friends drink, and be
drunken, and satisfy our hollow and deep desires, with Jesus. Oh come all and
drink at this living well; come drink and live for ever more, come drink and
welcome: welcome, says our fairest Bridegroom, no man gets Christ with ill
will, no man comes and is not welcome, no man comes and rueth his voyage: all
men speak well of Christ who have been at him; men and Angels who know him,
will say more then I dow do, and think more of him then they can say. O if I
were misted and bewildered in my Lords love! Oh if I were fettered and chained
to it! O sweet pain to be pained for a sight of him! O living death, O good
death! O lovely death to die for love of Jesus! Oh that I should have a sore
heart and a pained soul for the wanting of the love of this, and that idol!
woe, woe to the mistakings of my miscarrying heart, that gapeth and cries for
creatures, and is not pained, and cutted, and tortured, and in sorrow for the
want of a souls-fill of Christ. Oh that thou would come near, my Beloved: O
my fairest one, why stand thou a far? come hither that I may be satiat with
thy excellent love: O for an union, O for a fellowship with Jesus! O that I
could buy with a price that lovely one, suppose hells torments for a while were
the price! I cannot believe but Christ will ru^ upon his pained lovers, and
come and ease sick hearts, who sigh and swoond for the want of Christ: who dow
bide Christ's love to be nice? What heaven can there be liker to hell, then to
lust, and grein, and dwine, and fall a swoon for Christ's love, and to want it?
is not this hell and heaven woven through other? Is not this pain and joy,
sweetness and sadness to be in one web, the one the woft, the other the warp.
Therefore I would Christ would let us meet; and join together, the soul and
Christ in others arms. O what meeting is like this, to see blackness and
beauty, contemptibleness and glory, highness and baseness, even a soul and
Christ kiss one another! Nay but when all is done I may be wearied in speaking
and writing, but O how far am I from the right expression of Christ o^ his
love. I can neither speak, nor write feeling, nor ^alling, nor smeling^ come
feel, and smell, and taste Christ, and his love(...)d and ye shall call it more
then can be spoken: to write how sweet the honeycomb it is not so lovely as to
eat and suck the honey comb: and nights rest in a bed of love with Christ, will
say more then he(...) can think, or tongue can utter. Neither need we fear
crosses, or sigh, or be sad for any thing that is on this side of heaven, if we
have Christ: our crosses will never draw blood of the joy of the holy Ghost,
and peace of conscience; ou^ joy i^ laid up in such a high place as temptations
cannot climb up to take it down: this world may boast Christ; but they dare not
strike, or if they strike, they break their arm in fetching a stroke upon a
rock. O that we could put our treasure in Christ's hand, and give him our gold
to keep, and our crown. St^iv^, Mistress, to throng through the thorns of this
life to be at Christ: ^in^ not sight of him in this cloudy, and dark day: Sleep
with him in your heart in the night: Learn not at the world to serve Christ,
but speir at himself the way, the world is a false copy and a lying guide to
follow. Remember my love to your husband, I wish all to him I have written
here. The sweet presence, the long lasting goodwill of our God, the warmely and
lovely comforts of our Lord Jesus be with you. Help me his prisoner in your
prayers: For I remember you.

Worthy Mistress.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear from you: I hear Christ has
been that Kind as to visit you with sickness, and to bring you to the door of
the grave, but ye found the door shut (blessed be his glorious name) while ye
be riper for eternity: He will have more service of you, and therefore he
seeks of you, that hence forth ye be honest to your new husband, the Son of
God. We have all Idol-love, and are wh(...)y inclined to love other things
beside our Lord; and therefore our Lord hunteth for our love, more ways then
one or two. Oh that Christ had his own of us: I know he will not want you, and
that is a sweet wilfulness in his Love; and ye have as good cause o^ the other
part to be head strong and peremptory in your love to Christ, and not to part
or divide your love betwixt Him and the world; if it were more it is little
enough, yea too little for Christ. I am now every way in good terms with
Christ, he has set a banished prisoner as a seal on his heart, and as a
bracelet on his arm: that crabbed and black tree of the cross, laugheth upon
me now: the alarming noise of the cross is worse then it self. I love Christ's
glooms, better, then the world's worm-eaten joys. Oh if all the Kingdom were
as I am, except these bonds: my loss is gain: my sadness, joyful: my bonds,
liberty: my tears comfortable. This world is not worth a drink of cold water. O
but Christ's love casts a great heat, (...) hell and all the salt sea and the
rivers of the earth cannot quench it: I remember you to God, ye have the
prayers of a prisoner of Christ: Grace, grace be with you.

MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear how your La: is: I know not
how to requite your La: kindness, but your love to the Saints Madam, is Laid up
in heaven, I know it is for your welbeloved Christ's sake, that ye make his
friends so dear to you, and concern your self so much in them. I am in this
house of my pilgrimage every way in good case, Christ is most kind and loving
to my soul, it pleases him to feast with his unseen consolations a stranger,
and an exiled prisoner, and I would not exchange my Lord Jesus, with all the
comfort out of heaven: his yoke is easy and his burden light. This is his
truth I now suffer for, for he has sealed it ^ith his blessed presence, I know
Christ shall yet win the day, and gain the battle in Scotland. Grace be with
you.

Aberd. March. 7. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To Mr. JAMES BRUCE. Minister of the Gospel. (32)
Reverend and welbeloved Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Upon the nearest acquaintance, that we are
fathers children, I thought good to write to you. My case in my bonds for the
honor of my royal Prince, and King Jesus, i^ as good as becomes the witness
of such a Sovereign King. At my first coming hither, I was in great heaviness,
wrestling with challenges, being burdened in heart, (as I am yet) for my
silent Sabbaths, and for a bereft people; young ones newborn plucked from the
breasts, and the Childrens table drawn. I thought I was a dry tree cast over
the dike of the vineyard; but my secret conceptions of Christ's love, at his
sweet and longdesired return to my soul, were found to be a lie of Christ's love
forged by the tempter, and my own heart, and I am persuaded that it was so: Now
there is greater peace and security within then before: the court is raised and
dismissed for it was not fenced in God's name: I was far mistaken, who should
have summoned Christ for unkindness: misted faith, and my sever conceived amiss
of him: now, now, he is pleased to feast a poor prisoner, and to refresh me
with joy unspeakable and glorious; so, as the holy Spirit is witness, that my
sufferings are for Christ's truth, and God forbid I should deny the testimony of
the holy Spirit, and make him a false witness. Now I testify under my hand, out
of some small experience, that Ch^ists cause [even with the cross,] is better
then the Kings crown, and that his reproaches are sweet, his cross perfumed,
the walls of my prison fair and large, my losses gain. I desire you, my dear
Brother, help me to praise, and remember me in your prayers to God. Grace,
grace be with you.

Aberd. March. 14. 1637. Yours in our Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the Lady Earlstoun. (33)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear how your soul prospers. I
exhort you to go on in your journey: your day is short, and your afternoon-sun
will soon go down: make an end of your accounts with your Lord: for Death and
Judgment are tides, that bide no man: salvation is supposed to be at the door,
and Christianity is thought an easy task; but I find it hard, and the way
strait and narrow, were it not but my guide is content to wait on me, and to
care for a tired traveller. Hurt not your conscience with any known sin: let
your children be as so many flowers, borrowed from God; if the flowers die or
wither, thank God for a summers-loan of them, and keep good neighborhood, to
borrow and lend with him. Set your heart upon heaven, and trouble not your
spirit with this clay-Idol of the world, which is but vanity, and has but the
luster of the Rainbow in the air, which comes and goes with a flying
March-shower: Clay is the Idol of bastards, not the inheritance of the
children. My Lord has been pleased to make many unknown faces laugh upon me,
and has made me well content of a borrowed fireside, and a borrowed bed: I am
feasted with the joys of the holy Ghost, and my royal King bears my charges
honorably. I love the smell of Christ's sweet breath, better then the worlds
gold. I would I had help to praise him. The great Messenger of the Covenant,
the Son of God establish you on your rock, and keep you to the day of his
coming.

Aberd. March. 7. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To CARLETOUN. (34)
Worthy and much honored.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter from my Brother, to
the which I now answer particularly. I confess two things of my self. 1. Woe,
woe is me, that men should think there is any thing in me: He is my witness
before whom I am as crystal, that the secret hous^-devils that bear me too often
company, and that this sink of corruption which I find within, makes me go
with low sails: and if other^ saw what I see, they would look by me, but not
to me. 2. I know this shower of his free grace behooved to be on me, otherwise
I would have withered. I know also, I have need of a buffeting tempter that
grace may be put to exercise and I kept low. Worthy and dear Brother in our
Lord Jesus, I write that from my heart which ye now read. 1. I avouch that
Christ, and sweating, and sighing under his cross, is sweeter to me by far,
then all the Kingdoms in the world could possibly be. 2. If you and my dearest
acquaintance in Christ, reap any fruit by my sufferring; let me be weighed in
God's even balance, if my joy be not fulfilled: What am I to carry the marks
of such a great King? But howbeit I am a sink and sinful mass, a wretched
captive of sin, my Lord Jesus can hew heaven out of worse timber then I am (if
worse can be.) 3. I now rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorious, that I never
purposed posed to bring Christ no^ the least hoof or hair-breadth of truth
under (...): I desired to have and keep Christ all alone, and that he should
never rub clothes with that black-skin'd harlot of Rome. I am now fully paid
home, so that nothing aileth me for the present, but love-sickness for a ^^all
possession of my fair ^t welbeloved. I would give him my bond under my faith
and hand, to frist heaven an hundred years longer, so being he would lay his
holy face to my sometimes wet cheeks. Oh, who would not pity me, to know how
fain I would have the King shaking the tree of life upon me, or letting me in
to the well of life with my old dish, that I might be drunken with the
fountain, here, in the house of my pilgrimage! I cannot, nay I would not, be
quite of Christ's love: H^ has left the mark behind him where he gripped: He
goes away and leaves me and his burning love to wrestle together, and I can
scarce win my meat of his love because of absence: My Lord gives me but hungry
half-kisses, which serve to feed pain and increase hunger, but do not satisfy
my desires: His dieting of my soul for this race makes me lean. I have gotten
the wail and choice of Christ's crosses, even the ^ithe and the flower of the
gold of all crosses, to bear witness to the truth, and herein find I liberty,
joy, access, life, comfort, love, ^aith, submission, patience, and resolution
to take delight in on-waiting: and with all in my race he has come near me and
let me see the gold and crown: What then want I but fruition and real
enjoyment, which is reserved to my country? Let no man think he shall lose at
Christ's hands in suffering for him. 4. For these present trials they are most
dangerous: for people shall be stolen off their feet with well washen, and
whiteskin'd pretenses of indifferency; but it is the power of the great
Antichrist working in this land. Woe, woe, woe be to Apostat Scotland: there is
wrath, and a cup of the red wine of the wrath of God Almighty in the Lords
hand, that they shall drink and spue and fall and not rise again. The star
called Wormwood and Gall is fallen in the fountains, and rivers, and has made
them bitter: the sword of the Lord is ^ourbished against the Idol-shepherds of
the l^nd; women shall bless the barren womb and miscarrying breasts; all hearts
shall be faint, and all knees shall tremble, an end is coming, the leopard and
the lion shall watch over our cities, houses great and fair shall be desolate
without an inhabitant: the Lord has said, Pray not for this people, for I have
taken my p^ace from them; yet the Lord's third part shall come through the
fire, as refined gold for the treasure of the Lord, and the outcasts of
Scotland shall be gathered together again, and the wilderness shall blossom as
the flower, and bud, and grow as the rose o^ Sharon, and great shall be the
glory of the Lord upon Scotland. 5. (...) am here as^aulted with the learned
and pregnant wits of this Kingdom; but all honor be to my Lord, truth but
laugheth at be^isted and blinded Scribes, and disputers of this world, and Gods
wisdom confounds them, and Christ triumphs in his own strong truth, that
speaks for it self. 6. I doubt not but my Lord is preparing me for heavier
trial^: I am most ready at the good pleasure of my Lord, in the strength of his
grace, for any thing he shall be pleased to call me to: neither shall the last
blackfaced messenger, Death, be holden at the door, when it shall knock. If my
Lord will take honor of the like of me, how glad and joy^ull shall my soul be:
Let Christ come out with me to an hotter battle then this, and I shall fear no
flesh: I know that my master will win the day, and that he has taken the
ordering of my sufferings in his own hand. 7. As for my deliverance, that
miscarrieth: I am here, by my Lords grace, to lay my hand on my mouth, to be
silent and wait on: my Lord Jesus is on his Journey for my deliverance; I will
not grudge that he runs not so fast as I would have him: On-waiting till the
swelling rivers fall, and till my Lord arise as a mighty man after strong wine,
shall be my best: I have not yet resisted to blood. 8. O how often am I laid in
the dust, and urged by the tempter (who can ride his own errands upon our lying
apprehensions,) to sin against the unchangeable love of my Lord. When I think
upon the sparrowes, and swallows that build their nests in the Kirk of Anwoth,
and of my dumb sabbaths, my sorrowful bl^ired eyes, look asquint upon Christ,
and present him as angry. But in this trial, all honor to our princely and
^oyall ^ing, faith ^aileth ^^ir before the wi^d, with top ^aile up, and
carries the poor pass^nger through. I ^ay inhibitions upon my thoughts, that
they receive no slanders of my only, only Beloved: let him even ^ay out of
his own mouth. There is no hope, yet I will die in that sweet beguile, (...) is
not so: I^ all see the Salvation of God. Let me be deceived really, and never
win to dry land, it is my joy to believe under the water, and to die with faith
in my hand gripping Christ: let my conceptions of Christ's love, go to the
grave with me and to hell with me, I may not, I dare not quite them. I hope to
keep Christ's pawn: if he never come to loose it, let him see to his own
promise. I know, Presumption, howbeit it be made of stoutness, will not thus be
wilful in heavy trials. Now, my dearest in Christ, the great messenger of the
Covenant, the only wise and alsufficient Jehovah establish you to the end. I
hear the Lord has been at your house and has called home your (...) to her
rest. I know, Sir, ye see the Lord loosing the p^^s of your tabernacle, and
wooing your love from this plaistered and over-guilded world; and calling upon
you, to be making your self ready to go to your fathers country, which shall
be a sweet fruit of that visitation. Ye know, to send the Comforter was a King,
word when he ascended on high: ye have claim to, and interest in that promise.
Remember my love in Christ to your father: show him, it is late and black might
with him; his long lying at the waterside, is, that he may look his papers e^^
he take shipping, and be at a point for his last answer before his judge and
Lord. All love, all mercy, all grace, and peace, all multiplied saving
consolations, all joy and faith in Christ, all stability and confirming
strength of grace, and the good will of him that dwelt in the bush be with you.

To MARION MC KNAUGHT. (35)
Worthy and dearest in the Lord.
I Ever loved, (since I knew you,) that little vineyard of the Lord's planting
in Galloway; But now much more since I have heard that he who has his fire in
Zion and his furnace in Jerusalem, has been pleased to set up a furnace
amongst you, with the first in this Kingdom: He who makes old things new,
seeing Scotland an old drossie and rusted Kirk, is beginning to make a new
clean bride of her and to bring a young chaste wife to him self out of the fire.
This fire shall be quenched, so soon as Christ has brought a clean spouse
through the fire: Therefore, my dearly beloved in the Lord, fear not a worm:
fear no^ worm Jacob, Christ i^ i^ that plea and shall win the plea: Charge an
unbeleeving heart, under the pain of treason against our great and royal King
Jesus, to dependence by faith, and quiet on-waiting on our Lord: Get you in to
your chambers and shut the doors about you: In, in with speed to your strong
hold ye prisoners of hope, ye doves flee in to Christ's windows, till the
indignation be over and the storm be past: Glorify the Lord in your
sufferings, and take his banner of love and spread over you; others will follow
you if they see you strong in the Lord, their courage shall take life from your
Christian carriage: look up and see who is coming, lift up your head, he is
coming to save, in garments died in blood, and traveling in the greatness of
his strength. I laugh, I smile, I leap for joy, to see Christ coming to save
you so quickly: O such wide steps as Christ takes! Three or four hills are but
a step to him; he skippeth over the mountains: Christ has set a battle
betwixt his poor weak saints and his enemies; he waileth the weapons for both
parties, and says to the enemies, Take you a sword of steel, Law, Authority,
Parliaments, and Kings upon your side, that is your armor: and he says to his
saints, I give you a feckless treesword in your hand, and that is suffering,
receiving of strokes, spoiling of your goods, and with your tree-sword ye shall
get and gain the Victory. Was not Christ dragged through the ditches of deep
dist^esses, and great straits? and yet Christ who is your head has win through
with his life, howbeit not with a whole skin. Ye are Christ's members, (...) is
drawing his members through the thorny hedge up to heaven after him; Christ one
day will not have so much as a pained toe; but there are great (...) and
portions of Christ's mystical body, not yet within the gates of the great high
city, the new Jerusalem and the dragon will strike at Christ so long as there
is one (...) member of Christ's body out of heaven. I tell you, Christ (...)
make new work out of old fore-cast^n Scotland, and gather (...) old broken
boards of his tabernacle, and pin them, and nail them together: our bills, and
supplications are up in heaven Christ (...) ^offers full of them: there is
mercy on the other (...) of this hi^, a good answer to all our bills is agreed
(...): I must tell you what lovely Jesus, fair Jesus, King Jesus ^ath done to
my soul, sometimes he sends me out a standing drink, and whispereth a word
through the wall; and I am well content of kindness^t the second hand, his bode
is ever welcome to ^^e be what it will: but at other times he will be messenger
himself, and I get the cup of salvation out of his own hand, ((...) to me) and
we cannot rest till we be in others arms: and O how sweet is a fresh kiss from
his holy mouth, his ^athing that goes before a kiss upon my poor soul, is
sweet, and (...) fault^ but that it is too short: I am careless, and stand not
much on this; howbeit ^oines, and back, and shoulders, and head ^ive in pieces
in steping up to my fathers house. I know my Lord can make long, and broad, and
high, and deep glory to his name, out of this bit feckless body; for Christ
looks not what stuff (...) ^eth glory ou^ of. My dearly beloved ye have
often fr^hed (...), but that is put up in my Master's accounts, ^e have him
debtor for me, but if, ye will do any thing for me ((...) ^^ow ye will) now in
my extremity, tell all my dear friends, that a prisoner is fettered, and
chained in Christ's love, Lord never lo^ the fetters; and ye and they together
take (...) hartiest comm^tions to my Lord Jesus, and thank him for a poor
friend: I desire your husband to read this letter, I send him a prisoners
blessing, I will be obliged to him if he will be willing to suffer for my dear
Master, suffering is the professors golden garment, there shall be no losses on
Christ's side of it. ye have been witnesses of much joy betwixt Christ and me
at communionfeasts, the remembrance whereof [howbeit I be feasted in secret]
holleth my heart, for I am put from the board-head and the kings first mess to
his by-board, and his broken meat is sweet unto me: I thank my Lord for
borrowed crumbs, no less then when I was feasted at the communion table in
Anwoth and Kirk^udbright: pray that I may get one day of Christ in public, as
I have had long since, before my eyes be closed. Oh that my Master would take
up house again, and lend me the keys of his wine-cellar again, and God send me
borrowed drink till then. Remember my love to Chist's kinsmen with you. I pray
for Christ's father's blessing to them all: Grace be with you: a prisoners
blessing be with you: I write it, and I bide by it, God shall be glorious in
Marion Mc Knaught when this stormy blast shall be over. O woman beloved of God,
believe, rejoice, be strong in the Lord, Grace is thy portion.

Aberd. 15. June. 1637. Your brother in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To JOHN GORDON At Risco in Galloway. (36)
My worthy and dear Brother.
MIspend not your short sand-glass which runs very fast: seek your Lord in
time: let me obtain of you a letter under your hand for a promise to God, by
his grace to take a new course of walking with God: heaven is not at the next
door: I find it hard to be a Christian; there is no little thrusting and
thronging to thrust in at heavens gates, it is a castle taken by force, many
shall strive to enter in and shall not be able. I beseech and obtest you in the
Lord make conscience of rash and passionat oaths, of raging and sudden
revenging anger, of night-drinking, of needless companionry, of
Sabbath-breaking, of hurting any under you by word or deed, of hating your very
enemies. Except ye receive the Kingdom of God as a little child and be as meek
and sober-minded as a babe, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of God: That is a
word which should touch you near, and make you stoop and cast your self down
and make your great spirit fall. I know this will not be easily done, but I
recommend it to you, as you tender your part of the Kingdom of heaven. Brother,
I may from new experience speak of Christ to you: Oh if ye saw in him what I
see: a river of God's unseen joys has flowed from bank to brae over my soul
since I parted with you: I wish I wanted part, so being ye might have, that
your soul might be sick of love for Christ, or rather satiat with him: this
clay-idol the world, would seem to you then not worth a fig; time will eat you
out of possession of it, when the eye strings break and the breath grows cold
and the imprisoned soul looks out at the windows of the clay house, ready to
leap out into eternity, what would ye then give for a lamp full of oil? Oh seek
it now. I desire you, to correct and curb banning, swearing, lying, drinking,
sabbath-breaking and idle spending of the Lords day, in absence from the Kirk,
as far as your Authority reaches in that Parish. I hear a man is to be thrust
in to that place to the which I have God's right: I know ye should have a voice
by God's word in that: Act. 1, 15, 16. to the end, and Act. 6, 3, 5. Ye would
be loath that any Prelat should put you out of your possession earthly, and
this is your right. What I write to you, I write to your wife. Grace be with
you.

Aberd. March. 14, 1637. Your loving Pastor. S. R.

To the Lady HALHILL. (37.)
DEar and Christian Lady, Grace, mercy and peace be to you: I longed much to
write to your La: But now the Lord offering a fit occasion, I would not omit to
do it: I cannot but acquaint your Lae: with the Kind dealing of Christ to my
soul in this house of my pilgrimage, that your La: May know Christ is as good
as he is called: For at my first entry into this trial (being easten down and
troubled with challenges and jealousies of his love whose name and testimony I
now bear in my bonds,) I feared nothing more, then that I was casten over the
dike of the vineyard as a dry tree, but blessed be his great name, the dry tree
was in the fire and was not burnt, his dew came down and quickened the root of a
withered plant, and now he is come again with joy, and has been pleased to
feast his exiled and afflicted prisoner with the joy of his consolations: now I
weep, but am not sad; I am chastned, but I die not; I have loss, but I want
nothing: this water cannot drown me, this fire cannot burn me, because of the
goodwill of him that dwelt in the bush. The worst things of Christ, his
reproaches, his cross, is better then Egypt's treasures. He has opened his
door and taken into his house of wine, a poor sinner, and has le^t me so sick
of love for my Lord Jesus, that if heaven were at my disposing, I would give it
for Christ, and would not be content to go to heaven except I were persuaded
Christ were there: I would not give nor exchange my bonds for the I'relats
velvets, nor my prison for their coaches, nor my sighs for all the world's
laughter: this clay idol, the world, has no great court in my soul, Christ
has come and run away to heaven with my heart and my love, so that neither
heart nor love is mine: I pray God, Christ may keep both without reversion. In
my estimation, as I am now disposed, if my part of this world's clay were
rooped and sold, I would think it dear of a drink of water. I see Christ's love
is so Kingly, that it will not abide a marrow, it must have a throne, all alone
in the soul, and I see apples beguile bairns howbeit they be worm-eaten: the
moth-eaten pleasures of this present world make bairns believe ten is a hundred
and yet all that are here are but shadows; if they would draw by the curtain
that is hanged betwixt them and Christ, they should think themselves fools who
have so long miskenned the Son of God. I seek no more next to heaven, but that
he may be glorified in a prisoner of Christ, and that in my behalf many would
praise his high and glorious name, who hears the sighing of the prisoner.
Remember my service to the Lord your husband and to your son my aquaintance: I
wish Christ had his young love, and that in the morning he would start to the
gate to seek that which this world knows not and therefore does not seek it:
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.

Aberd. March. 14. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To the right honorable my Lord LINDSAY. (38)
Right honorable and my very good Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to your Lo: Pardon my boldness to express my self to
your Lo: At this so needful a time, when your wearied and friendless
mother-kirk is looking round about her, to see if any of her sons does really
bemoan her desolation: Therefore, my dear and worthy Lord, I beseech you in the
bowels of Christ, pity that widow-like sister and spouse of Christ. I know, her
husband i^ not dead, but he seems to be in another country, and sees well
and beholds who are his true and tender hearted friends, who dare venture
under the water to bring out to dry land sinking truth, and who of the Nobles
will cast up their arm to ward a blow off the crowned head of our Royal
lawgiver who reigns in Zion, who will plead and contend for ^acob in the day
of his controversy. It i^ now time, my worthy and noble Lord, for you who are
the little nurse-fathers (under our Sovereign Prince] to put on courage for the
Lord Jesus, and to take up a fallen orphan speaking out of the dust, and to
embrace in your arms Christ's Bride: he has no more in Scotland that is the
delight of his eyes, but that one little sister, whose breasts were once well
fashioned; She once ravished her welbeloved with her eyes, and overcame him
with her beauty; She looked forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as
the sun, terrible as an army with banners; Her stature was like the palm tree,
and her breasts like clusters of grapes, and she held the King in his
galleries, Cant. 4: 9. and 6: 10. and 7: 5, 7. But now the crown is fallen from
her head, and her gold waxed dim, and our white Nazarites are become black as
the coal. Blessed are they who will come out and help Christ against the
mighty: The shields of the earth and the Nobles are debtors to Christ for their
honor, and should bring their glory and honor to the new Jerusalem, Rev. 21:
24. Alas that great men should be so far from subjecting themselves to the
sweet yoke of Christ, that they burst his bonds asunder, and think, they dow
not go on foot when Christ is on horseback, and that every nod of Christ
commanding as a King, is a load like a mountain of iron, and therefore they
say, This man shall not reign over us, we must have another King then Christ in
his own house. Therefore kneel to Christ and kiss the Son, and let him have
your Lo: vote as your alone Lawgiver. I am sure when you leave this old waste
J^nes, of this perishing life, and shall reckon with your host, and depart
hence and take shipping, and make over for eternity, which is the yonder side
o^ time, and a sand-glass of threescore short years is running out; To look
over your shoulder then, to that which ye have done, spoken, and suffered for
Christ, his dear bride (that he ransomed with that blood, which is more
precious then gold,] and for truth and the freedom of Christ's Kingdom; your
accounts shall more sweetly smile and laugh upon you, then if you had two
world's of gold to leave to your posterity. O my dear Lord, consider that our
Master, eternity, judgment, and the last reckoning will be upon us in the
twinkling of an eye: The blast of the last trumpet; now hard at hand, will cry
down all Acts of Parliaments, all the determinations of pretended Assemblies
against Christ our Lawgiver: There will be shortly a proclamation by one
standing in the clouds, that time shall be no more, and that court with Kings
of clay shall be no more, and prisons, confinements, forfeiturs of Nobles,
wrath of Kings, hazard of lands, houses, and name for Christ, shall be no more.
This world's span-length of time is drawn now to less then half an inch, and to
the point of the evening of the day, of this old and gray-haired world: And
therefore be fixed and fast for Christ and his truth for a time, and fear not
him whose life goes out at his nostrils, who shall die as a man. I am
persuaded Christ is responsall, and law-biding, to make recompense for any
thing that is hazarde^, or given out for him: losses for Christ are but our
goods given out in bank in Christ's hand. Kings earthly are well-favoured little
clay gods and tim's-idol, but a sight of our invisible King shall decry and
darken all the glory of this world. At the day of Christ, truth shall be truth,
and not treason. Alas it is pitiful, that silence, when the thatch of our
Lord's house has taken fire, is now the flower and the bloom of court and
state-wisdom; And to cast a covering over a good profession, (as if it blushed
at light,) is thought a canny and sure way through this life: But the safest
way I am persuaded, is, to tine and win with Christ, and to hazard fairly for
him; for heaven is but a company of Noble venturers for Christ. I dare hazard
my soul, Christ shall grow green and blossom as the rose of Sharon yet in
Scotland; howbeit now his leaf seems to wither and his root to dry up. Your
noble Ancestors have been enrolled amongst the worthies of this nation, as the
sure friends of the bridegroom and valiant for Christ: I hope, ye will follow
on, to come to the streets for the same Lord; the world is still at yea and nay
with Christ: it shall be your glory and the sure foundation of your house (now
when houses are tumbling down, and birds building their nests, and thorns and
briers are growing up where Nobles did spread a table) if you engage your
estate and nobility for this noble King Jesus, with whom the created Powers of
the world are still in tops: all the world shall fall before him, and (as God
lives) every arm lifted up to take the crown off his royal head, or that
refuses to hold it upon his head, shall be broken from the shoulder-blad: the
eyes that behold Christ weep in sackcloth, and wallow in his blood, and will
not help, even these eyes shall rot away in their eye-holes, O if ye and the
Nobles of this land, saw the beauty of that worlds wonder, Jesus our King, and
the glory of him who is Angels wonder and heavens wonder for excellency! Oh
what would men count of clay-estates, of time-eaten life, of wormeaten and
moth-eaten worldly glory, in comparison of that fairest, fairest of Gods
creation, the son of the father's delights. I have but small experience of
suffering for him, but let my Judge and witness in heaven, lay my soul in the
balance of justice, if I find not a young heaven, and a little Paradise of
glorious comforts, and soul-delighting love-kisses of Christ, here beneath the
moon in suffering for him and his truth: and that glory, joy, and peace, and
fire of love, I thought had been kept while supper time, when we shall get
leisure to feast our fill upon Christ; I have felt it in glorious beginnings,
in my bonds, for this princely Lord Jesus. Oh it is my sorrow, my daily pain,
that men will not come and see: I would now be ashamed to believe that it
should be possible for any soul to think that he could be a loser for Christ,
suppose he should lend Christ the Lordship of Lindsay, or some such great
worldly estate. Therefore my worthy and Dear Lord set your face against the
opposits of Jesus, and let your soul take courage to come under his banner, to
appear as his soldier for him, and the blessings of a falling Kirk, the
prayers of the prisoners of hope who wait for Sions joy, and the good will of
him that dwelt in the bush and it burned not, shall be with you. To his saving
Grace I recommend your Lo: and your House and am still Christ's prisoner and.

Aberd. Sept. 7. 1637. Your Lo: obliged servant in his sweet Lord Jesus S. R.

To my Lord Boyd. (39)
My very honorable and good Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am glad to hear that ye in the morning of
your short day mind Christ, and that ye love the honor of his crown and
Kingdom. I beseech your Lo: begin now to frame your love, and to cast it in no
mould but one, that it may be for Christ only; For when your love is now in
the framing, and making, it will take best with Christ: if any other then Jesus
get a grip of it, when it is green and young, Christ will be an uncouth and
strange world to you. Promise the lodging of your soul first away to Christ,
and stand by your first covenant, and keep to Jesus, that he may find you
honest. It is easy to master an arrow, and to set it right ere the string be
drawn, but when once it is shot and in the air, and the flight begun, then ye
have no power at all to command it: It were a blessed thing, if your love could
now level only at Christ, that his fair face were the black of the mark ye
shot at; For when your love is loosed, and out of your grips, and in its motion
to fetch home an^ Idol, and has taken a whorish gading-journey to seek an
unknown and strange lover, ye shall not then have power to call home the arrow,
or to be master of your love, and ye shall hardly give Christ, what ye scarcely
have your self. I speak not this, as if youth it self could fetch heaven and
Christ. Believe it my Lo: It is hardly credible what a nest of dangerous
tentations youth i^, how inconsiderat, foolish, proud, vain, heady, rash,
profane, and careless of God, this piece of your life is, so that the devil
finds in that age a garnished and swept house for himself, and seven devils
worse then himself; for then affections are on horseback, lofty and stirring,
then the old man has blood, lust, much will; and little wit, and hands, feet,
wanton eyes, profane ears as his servants, and as a Kings officers at command,
to come and go at his will: Then a green conscience is as souple as the twig
of a young tree, it is for every way, every religion, every lewd course
prevails with it; And therefore O what a sweet couple, what a glorious yoke
are youth and Grace, Christ and a young man! This is a meeting not to be found
in every town. None who have been at Christ can bring back to your Lo a report
answerable to his worth; for Christ cannot be spoken of, or commended according
to his worth; Come and see is the most faithful messenger to speak of him,
little persuasion would prevail where this were: It is impossible in the
setting out of Christ's love, to lie, and pass over truth's line: The
discourses of Angels, or Love-books written by the congregation of Seraphims
[all their wits being conjoined and melted in one] would for ever be in the
nether side of tru^ and plentifully declaring the thing as it is. The
infinitness, the boundlesness of that incomparable excellency that is in Jesus,
is a great word. God send me, if it were but the relicts and leavings, or an
ounce weight or two, of his matchless love, and suppose I never got another
heaven [providing this blessed fire were evermore burning] I could not but be
happy forever. Come hither then and give out your money wisely for bread: Come
here and bestow your love. I have cause to speak this, because except ye enjoy
and possess Christ, ye will be a cold friend to his spouse; For it is love to
the husband that causes kindness to the wife. I dare swear, it were a blessing
to your House, the honor of your Honor, the flower of your credit, now in
your place, and as far as ye are able, to lend your hand, to your weeping
Mother, even your oppressed and spoiled Mother-kirk. If ye love her and bestir
your self for her, and hazard the Lordship of Boyd for the recovery of her vail
[which the smiting-watchmen have taken from her] then surely her husband will
scorn to sleep in your common or reverence: Bits of Lordships are little to him
who has many crowns on his head and the Kingdoms of the world in the hollow
of his hand. Court, Honor, Glory, riches, Stability of houses, Favor of
Princes are all on his finger ends. O what glory were it to lend your honor to
Christ, and to his Jerusalem. Ye are one of Zions born sons, your Honorable
and Christian Parents would venture you upon Christ's errands: Therefore I
beseech you by the mercies of God, by the death and wounds of Jesus, by the
hope of your glorious inheritance and by the comfort and hope of the joyful
presence ye would have at the waterside, when ye are putting your foot in the
dark grave, take courage for Christ's truth, and the Honor of his free
Kingdom; for howbeit ye be a young flower and green before the sun, ye know not
how soon death will cause you cast your bloom, and wither root and branch and
leaves: And therefore write up what ye have to do for Christ, and make a
treasure of good works, and begin in time: by appearance ye have the advantage
of the brae: see what ye can do for Christ against these, who are waiting
while Christ's Tabernacle fall, that they may run away with the boards thereof,
and build their nests on Zion's ruins: They are blind who see not lowns now
pulling up the stakes and breaking the cords and renting the curtains of
Christ's (some times) beautiful tent in this land. Antichrist is lifting that
tent up upon his shoulders and going away with it, and when Christ and the
Gospel are out of Scotland, dream not that your houses shall thrive, and that
it shall go well with the Nobles of the land; As the Lord lives the streams
of your waters shall become pitch, and the dust of your land brimstone, and
your land shall become burning pitch, and the Owl and the Raven shall dwell in
your houses, and where your table stood there shall grow briers, and nettles:
Isa. 34: 9, 11. The Lord gave Christ and his Gospel as a pawn to Scotland, the
watchmen have fallen foul, and lost their part of the pawn; and who sees not
that God has dried up their right eye, and their right arm, and has broken
the shepherds staves, and men are treading in their hearts upon such unsavory
salt, that is good for nothing else. If ye the Nobles put away the pawn also,
and refuse to plead the controversy of Sion with the professed enemies of
Jesus, ye have done with it. Oh where is the courage, and zeal now, of the
ancient Nobles of this land, who with their swords and hazard of life, honor
and houses brought Christ to our hands? And now the Nobles cannot be but guilty
of shouldering out Christ, and murdering of the souls of the posterity, if
they shall hide themselves, and lurk in the lee-side of the hill, till the wind
blow down the temple of God. It goes now under the name of wisdom, for men to
cast their cloak over Christ and their profession, as if Christ were stolen
goods, and durst not be avouched, though this be reputed a pi^ce of policy; yet
God estemeeth such men to be but State-fool and Court-gooks, what ever they or
other Heads of wit, like to them think of themselves, since their damnable
silence, is the ruin of Christ's Kingdom. Oh but it be true honor, and glory,
to be the fast friends of the bridegroom, and to own Christ's bleeding head,
and his forsaken cause, and to contend legally, and in the wisdom of God for
our sweet Lord Jesus, and his Kingly crown. But I will believe your Lo: will
take Christ's honor to heart, and be a man in the streets (as the prophet
speaks) for the Lord and his truth To his rich grace and sweet presence, and
the everlasting consolation of the promised comforter I recomend your Lo: and
am.

Aberd. Sept. 7. 1637. Your Lo: in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To my Lady Boyd. (40.)
My Very Honorable and Christian Lady.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter and am well pleased
that your thoughts of Christ stay with you, and that your purpose still is, by
all means to take the Kingdom of heaven by Violence, which is no small
conquest, and it is a degree of watchfulness and thankfulness also, to observe
sleepiness and unthankfulness: we have all good cause to complain of false
light that plays the thief, and steals away the lantern when it comes to
the practice of constant walking with God: our journey is ten times a day
broken in ten pieces, Christ gets but only broken and halfed and tired work
of us, and alas too often against the hair. I have been some what nearer the
bridegroom, but when I draw nigh, and see my vileness, for shame I would be out
of his presence again, but yet desire of his soulrefreshing love, puteth
blushing-me under an arrest. O what am I, so loathsome a burden of sin, to stand
beside such a beautiful and holy Lord, such an high and lofty one who
inhabiteth eternity: but since it pleases Christ to condescend to such an one
as me, let shamefa^^eness be laid aside, and lose it self in his condescending
love. I would heartily be content to keep a corner of the Kings hall: Oh if I
were at the yonder end of my weak desires, then should I be where Christ my
Lord, and lover, lives and reigns, there I should be overlastingly solaced with
the sight of his face, and satisfied with the surpassing sweetness of his
matchless love: But truly now I stand in the nether side of my desires, and
with a drowping head, and panting heart, I look up to fair Jesus standing a far
off from us, while corruption and death shall scour and refine the body of
clay, and rot out the bones of the old man of sin: In the mean time we are
blessed in sending word to the beloved, that we love to love him, and till then
there is joy in wooing, suiting, lying about his house, looking in at the
windows and sending a poor souls groans and wishes through a hole of the door to
Jesus, till God send a glad meeting: And blessed be God that after a low-ebbe,
and so sad a word Lord Jesus it is long since I saw thee, That even then, our
wings are growing and the absence of sweet Jesus breeds a new fleece of
desires and longings for him: I know no man has a velvet cross, but the cross
is made of that which God will have it. But verily howbeit it be no warrantable
market, to buy a cross; yet I dare not say, O that I had liberty to sell
Christ's cross, lest therewith also I should sell joy, comfort, sense of love,
patience and the kind visits of a bridegroom: And therefore blessed be God, we
get crosses unbought and good cheap. S^^^ I am, it were better to buy crosses
for Christ, then to sell them; howbeit neither be allowed to us: And for
Christ's joyful coming, and going which your La: speaks of, I bear with it,
as love can permit: it should be enough to me, if I were wise, that Christ will
have joy and sorrow halfers of the life of the saints, and that each of them
should have a share of our days, as the night and the day are kindly partners
and halfers of Time, and take it up betwixt them: But if sorrow be the
greediest halfer of our days here, I know joy's day shall dawn, and do more
then recompense all our sad hours: Let my Lord Jesus (since he will do so)
weave my bit and span-length of time, with white and black, well and woe, with
the bridgroom's coming and his sad departure, as warp and woof in one web, and
let the rose be neighboured with the thorn, yet hope (that makes not ashamed)
has written a letter and lines of hope to the mourners in Zion, that it shall
not be long so: when we are over the water Christ shall cry down crosses and up
heaven for evermore, and down hell and down death, and down sin, and down
sorrow, and up glory, up life, up joy for evermore: In this hope I sleep
quietly in Christ's bosom, while he come who is not slack; and would sleep so,
were it not, that the noise of the devil, and Sin's feet, and the cries of an
unbeleeving heart awaken me; but for the present I have nothing whereof I can
accuse Christ's cross. Oh if I could please my self in Christ only! I hope
Madam your Sons will improve their power for Jesus, for there is no danger,
neither is there any question or justling betwixt Christ and Authority; though
our enemies falsely state the question, as if Christ and Authority could not
abide under one roof; the question only is betwixt Christ and men in
Authority: Authority is for and from Christ, and sib to him; how then can he
make a plea with it? Nay the truth is, worms and Gods of clay, are risen up
against Christ. If the fruit of your La: Womb be helpers of Christ, ye have
good ground to rejoice in God. All your La: can expect for your goodwill to me
and my Brother (a wronged stranger for Christ) is, the prayers of a prisoner of
Jesus, to whom I recommend your La: and house and children, and in whom I am.

Aberd. Sept. 8. 1637. MADAM. Your (...): in Christ. S. R.

To the Lady Culross. (41)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I dare not say I wonder that ye have never
written to me in my bonds, because I am not ignorant of the cause; yet I could
not but write to you: I know not whether joy or heaviness in my soul carries
it away; sorrow without any mixture of sweetness, has not often love-thoughts
of Christ, but I see the devil can insinuat himself and ride his errands upon
the thoughts of a poor oppressed prisoner. I am woe that I am making Christ my
unfriend by seeking pleas against him, because I am the first in the Kingdom
put to utter silence, and because I cannot preach my Lord's righteousness in
the great congregation: I am notwithstanding the less solicitous how it go, if
there be not wrath in my cup. But I know, I but claw my wounds when my
physician has forbidden me: I would believe in the dark upon luck's head, and
take my hazard of Christ's goodwill and rest on this, that in my fever my
Physician is at my bedside, and that he sympathizeth with me when I sigh. My
borrowed house, and another man's bed and fireside and other losses have to
room in my sorrow, a greater heat to eat out a less fire, is a good remedy for
some burning. I believe when Christ draws blood he has skill to cut the
right vein and that he has taken the whole ordering and disposing of my
sufferings. Let him tutour me, and tutour my crosses as he thinks good, there
is no danger nor hazard in following such a guide; howbeit he should lead me
through hell, if I could put faith foremost, and fill the fieldwith a quiet
on-waiting, and believing to see the salvation of God. I know Christ is not
obliged to let me see both the sides of my cross, and turn it over and over,
that I may see all, My faith is richer to live upon credit, and Christ's
borrowed money, then to have much in my hand. Alas I have forgotten that faith
in times past has stopped a lek in my crazed bark, and has filled my sails
with a fair wind: I see it a work of God that experiences are all lost, when
summonds of improbation, to prove our Charters of Christ to be counterfit, are
raised against poor souls in their heavy trials: but let me be a sinner, and
worse then the chief of sinners, yea a guilty devil, I am sure my welbeloved is
God, and when I say Christ is God, and my Christ is God, I have said all
things, I can say no more: I would I could build as much on this, my Christ is
God, as it would bear, I might lay all the world upon it: I am sure Christ
untried, and untaken up in the power of his love, Kindness, mercies, goodness,
wisdom, long-suffering and greatness, is the rock that dim-sighted travelers
dash their foot against, and so stumble fearfully. But my wounds are sorest,
and pain me most, to sin against his love, and his mercy, and if he would set
me and my conscience by the ears together and resolve not to rid the plea, but
let us deal it betwixt us; my spitting upon the fair face of Christ's love, and
mercies, by my Jealousies, unbelief, and doubting would be enough to sink me.
Oh, oh, I am convinced O Lord, I stand dumb before thee for this: Let me be
mine own Judge in this, and I take a dreadful doom upon me for it; for I still
misbeleeve, though I have seen that my Lord has made my cross, as if it were
all Crystal, so as I can see through it Christ's fair face and heaven, and that
God has honored a lump of sinful flesh and blood the like of me, (...) to be
Christ's honorable Lord-prisoner, I ought to esteem the walls of the
theeves-hole (if I were shut up in it) or any stinking dungeon, all hung with
tapestrie, and most beautiful for my Lord Jesus, and yet I am not so shut up,
but that the sun shines upon my prison, and the fair wide heaven is the
covering of it. But my Lord in his sweet visits has done more, for he make me
find that he will be a confined prisoner with me: he lies down, and rises up
with me, when I sigh, he sigheth: When I weep, he suffers with me; and I
confess here is the blessed issue of my sufferings already begun, that my
heart is filled with hunger and desire, to have him glorified in my sufferings.
Blessed ye of the Lord, Madam, if ye would help a poor Dyvour, and cause others
of your acquaintance in Christ help me, to pay my debt of love, even real
praises to Christ my Lord. Madam let me charge you in the Lord, as ye will
answer to him, help me in this duty [which he has tied about my neck with a
chain of such singular expressions of his loving kindness] to set on high
Christ, to hold in my honesty at his hands, for I have nothing to give him. O
that he would arrest and comprise my love and my heart for all! I am a Dyvour
who have no more free goods in the world for Christ, save that, it is both the
whole heritage I have and all my movables besides: Lord give the thirsty man a
drink. Oh to be over the ears in the well! Oh to be swattering, and swimming
over head and ears in Christ's love! I would not have Christ's love entering in
me, but I would enter into it, and be swallowed up of that love. But I see not
my self here, for I fear I make more of his love then of himself; whereas
himself is far beyond and much better then his love. Oh if I had my sinful
arms filled with that lovely one Christ! Blessed be my rich Lord Jesus who
sends not away beggars from his house with a toom dish. He fills the
vessels of such as will come and seek: We might beg our selves rich, [if we
were wise,] if we could but hold out our withered hands to Christ, and learn to
suit, and seek, ask, and knock. I ow my salvation for Christ's glory, low it
to Christ, and desire that my hell, yea a new hell, seven times hotter then the
old hell, might buy praises before men and Angels to my Lord Jesus; providing
always I were free of Christ's hatred and displeasure. What am I to be
forfeited and sold in soul and body, to have my great and royal King set on
high, and extolled above all? O if I knew how high to have him set, and all the
world far, far beneath the soles of his feet! Nay I deserve not to be the
matter of his praises, far less to be an agent in praising of him. But he can
win his own glory out of me, and out of one worse then I [if any such be] if it
please his holy Majesty so to do; he knows that I am not now flattering him.
Madam let me have your prayers, as ye have the prayers and blessing of him that
is separated from his Brethren. Grace, Grace be with you.

Aberd. June 15. 1637. Your own in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the Earl of Cassills. (42)
My very Noble and honorable Lord.
I make bold (out of the honorable and Christian report I hear of your Lo:
having no other thing to say, but that which concerns the honorable cause,
which the Lord has enabled your Lo: to profess) to write this, that it is
your Lo: crown, your glory, and your honor to set your shoulder under the
Lords glory, now falling to the ground; and to back Christ now, when so many
think it wisdom to let him send for himself: the shields of the earth ever did,
and do still believe, that Christ is a cumbersom neighbor, and that it is a
pain to hold up his yea's, and nay's: They fear he take their chariots, and
their crowns, and their honor, from them; but my Lord stands in need of
none of them all: But it is your glory to own Christ and his buried truth, for
let men say what they please, the plea with Sion's enemies in this day of
Jacob's trouble, is, If Christ should be King, and no mouth steak laws but
his? It concerns the apple of Christ's eye, and his royal privileges, what
now is debated: and Christ's Kingly honor is come to yea, and nay: But let me
be pardoned my, my dear and Noble Lord, to beseech you by the mercies of God,
by the comforts of the Spirit, by the wounds of your dear Savior, by your
compearance before the Judge of quick and dead; to stand for Christ, and to
back him. Oh if the Nobles had done their part, and been zealous for the Lord
it had not been as it is now; but men think it wisdom to stand beside Christ,
till his head be broken, and sing dumb. there is a time coming when Christ will
have a thick court and he will be the glory of Scotland, and he shall make a
diadem, a garland, a seal upon his heart and a ring on his finger, of these,
who have avouched him before this faithless generation: Howbeit ere that come,
wrath from the Lord is ordained for this land. My Lord, I have cause to write
this to your Lo: for I dare not conceal his kindness to the soul of an
afflicted, exiled prisoner: Who has more cause to boast in the Lord then such
a sinner as I? Who am feasted with the consolations of Christ, and have no pain
in my sufferings, but the pain of soul-sickness of love for Christ, and sorrow
that I cannot get help to sound aloud the high praises of him who has heard
the fighing of the prisoner, and is content to lay the head of his oppressed
servant in his bosom, under his chinne, and let him feel the smell of his
garments. This I behooved to write that your Lo: might know, Christ is as good
as he is called, and to testify to your Lo: the cause your Lo: now professes
before this faithless world is Christ's: and your Lo: shall have no shame of
it. Grace be with you.

To the much honored JOHN OSBURN, Provest of Air. (43).
Much honored Sir,
GRrace mercy, and peace be to you; Upon our small acquaintance and the good
report I hear of you, I could not but write to you: I have nothing to say, but
Christ in that honorable place lie has put you in, has entrusted you with a
dear pledge which is his own glory; and has armed you with his sword to keep
the pledge and make a good account of it to God. Be not afraid of me. Your
master can mow down his enemies and make with red hay of fair flowers. your
time will not be long; after your after(...) will come your evening, and after
evening night: serve Christ, back him, lethis cause be your cause; give not an
hair breadth of (...) away, for it is not yours but God's: then, since ye are
going take Christ's t^^ti^cat with you out of this life, Well done good and
faithful servant. His well done is worth a shipfull of Good-dayes and earthly
honors. I have cause to say this, because I find him truth it self: In my sad
days, Christ laugheth cheerfully and says, All will be well. Would to God,
all this Kingdom, and ye, and all that know God, knew, what is betwixt me and
Christ in this prison, what kisses, embracements, and love-communings: I take
his cross in my arms with joy, I bless it, I rejoice in it: suffering for
Christ is my garland; I would not exchange Christ for ten thousand worlds; nay
[if the comparison could stand] I would not exchange Christ with heaven. Sir,
pray for me, and the prayers and blessing of a prisoner of Christ meet you in
all your straits. Grace be with you.

Aberd. March. 14. 1637. Yours in Christ Jesus his Lord. S. R.

To ROBERT GORDON Bailiffe of Air. (44)
Worthy Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear from you in paper. Remember
your Chief's speeches on his deathbed: I pray your Sir sell all and buy the
pearl; time will cut you from this world's glory: Look what will do you good,
when your glass shall be run out, and let Christ's love bear most court in
your soul, and that court will bear down the love of other things: Christ
seeks your help in your place, give him your hand: Who has more cause to
encourage others to own Christ then I have? for he has made me sick of love
and le^t me in pain to wrestle with his love, and love is like to fall a swoon
through his absence: I mean not that he deserteth me, or that I am ebb of
comforts, but this is an uncouth pain. Oh that I had a heart and a love to
render to him back again! O if principalities and powers, thrones and dominions
and all the world, would help me to praise. Praise him in my behalf. Remember
my love to your wife. I thank you most kindly for your love to my brother.
Grace be with you.

Aberd. March. 13. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To JOHN KENNEDY, Bailiffe of Air. (45)
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: Your nor writing to me, cannot bind me up
from remembering you now and then, that at least ye may be a witness and a third
man, to behold in paper what is betwixt Christ and me. I was in his eyes like a
young Orphan, wanting known parents, casten out in the open fields; either
Christ behooved to take me up, and to bring me home to his house and fireside,
else I had dyed in the fields: and now, I am homly with Christ's love, so that
I think the house mine own, and the master of the house mine also. Christ
enquired not when he began to love me, whether I was fair, or black, and
sunburned? love takes what it may have. He loved me before this time I know,
but now I have the flower of his love, his love is come to a fair bloom, like a
young rose opened up out of the green leaves, and it casts a strong and
fragrant smell. I want nothing but ways of expressing Christ's love: A full
vessel would have a vent. O if I could smoke out and cast out coals to make a
fire in many breasts of this land! Oh it is a pity that there were not many
imprisoned for Christ, for no other purpose, but to write books and love-songs
of the love of Christ. This love would keep all created tongues of men and
Angels in exercise, and busy, night and day to speak of it. Alas I can speak
nothing of it, but wonder at three things in his love. First, Freedom. O that
lumps of sin should get such love for nothing. Secondly. The Sweetness of his
love, I give over either to speak or write of it, but these that feel it may
better bear witness What it is: but it is so sweet that next to Christ himself
nothing can match it: nay I think a soul could live eternally blessed only on
Christ's love, and feed upon no other thing: yea when Christ in love gives a
blow, it does a soul good, and it is a kind of comfort and joy to it, to get
a cuff with the lovely, sweet, and soft hand of Jesus. And Thirdly, what power
and strength is in his love? I am persuaded it can climb a^st^ep hill, and hell
upon it is back, and swim through the water and not dro^n, and sing in the fire
and find no pain, and triumph in losles, prisons, sorrows, exile, disgrace,
and laugh and rejoice in death. Oh for a yeer's lease of the sense of his love
without a cloud, to try what Christ is! Oh for the coming of the bridegroom! Oh
when will I see the bridegroom and the bride meet in the clouds and kiss each
other! Oh when will we get our day and our hearts full of that love! Oh is it
were lawful to complain of the f^mine, and want of that love of the immediate
vision of God! O time, time, how do thou torment the souls of these that
would be swallowed up of Christ's love, because thou movest so slowly! Oh if he
would pity a poor prisoner, and blow love upon me, and give a prisoner a taste,
or draught of that surpassing sweetness (which is glory as it were begun) to be
a confirmation, that Christ and I shall have our fill of other for ever! Come
hither O love of Christ, that I may once kiss thee before I die, what would I
not give to have time that lies betwixt Christ and me taken out of the way
that we might once meet? I cannot think but ^t the first sight I shall see of
that most lovely and fairest face, love shall come out of his two eyes and fill
me with astonishment, I would but desire to stand at the utter side of the
gates of the new Jerusalem, and look through a hole of the door and see Christ's
face: a borrowed vision in this life would be my borrowed and begun heaven,
while the long, long-looked for day dawn. It is not for nothing that it is said
Colos. 1. 27. Christ in you the hope of glory. I will be content of no pawn of
heaven but Christ himself; for Christ possessed by faith here is young heaven
and glory in the bud: If I had that pawn I would bide horning and hell both
ere I gave it again. All we have here, is scarce the picture of glory: Should
not we young bairns long and look for the expiring of our minority. It were
good to be daily begging propines and love-gifts, and the bridegroom's favors,
and if we can do no more seek Crumbs and hungry dinners of Christ's love, to
keep the taste of heaven in our mouth while supper time. I know it is far
afternoon and nigh the marriagesupper of the Lamb, the table is covered
already. O welbeloved run, run fast! O fair day when will it thou dawn! O
shaddows flee away! I think hope and love woven through other, make our absence
from Christ spiritual torment: It is a pain to wait on, but hope that makes
not a hamed swalloweth up that pain. It is not unkindness that keeps Christ
and us so long asunder. What can I say to Christ's love? I think more then I
can say: To consider that when my Lord Jesus may take the air [if I may so
speak) and go abroad; yet he will be confined and keep the prison with me: but
in all this sweet communion with him what am I to be thanked, for I am but a
sufferer, whether I will or not he will be kind to me, as if he had defied my
guiltiness to make him unkind, so he bears in his love on me. Here I die with
wondering, that justice hinders not love; for there are none in hell nor out
of hell, more unworthy of Christ's love. Shame may confound and scar me, once
to hold up my black mouth, to receive one of Christ's undeserved kisses. If my
inner-side were turned out, and all men saw my vileness, they would say to me,
It is a shame for thee to stand still, while Christ kiss thee and embrace thee:
It would seem to become me rather to run away from hi love, as ashamed at my
own unworthiness. Nay I may think shame to take heaven, who have so higly
provoked my Lord Jesus: But seeing Christ's love will shame me, I am content to
be shamed. My desire is that my Lord would give me broader and deeper thoughts,
to feed my self with wondering at his love: I would I could weigh it, but I
have no balance for it. When I have worn my tongue to the stump in praising of
Christ, I have done nothing to him, I must let him alone, for my withered arms
will not go about his high, wide, long and broad love: What remains then,
but that my debt to the love of Christ lie unpaid for all eternity. All that
are in heaven are black shamed with his love as well as I, we must all be
Dyvours together, and the blessing of that house-full, or heaven-full of
Dyvours, shall rest for ever upon him. Off this Land and Nation would come and
stand beside his inconceivable and glorious perfections, and look in, and love,
and wonder, and adore! would to God I could bring in many lovers to Christ's
house! But this Nation has forsaken the fountain of living waters. Lord cast
not water on Scotland's coal. Woe, woe will be to this Land, because of the day
of the Lord's fierce anger that is so fast coming. Grace be with you.

Aberd. Your affectionat Brother in our Lord Jesus, S. R.

To JOHN KENNEDY Bailiffe of Air. (46)
Worthy and Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to see you in this Northern world in
paper; I know it is not forgetfulness that ye write not: I am every way in good
case both in soul and body, all honor and glory be to my Lord: I want nothing
but a further revelation of the beauty of the unknown Son of God. Either I know
not what Christianity is, or we have stinted a measure of so many ounce
weights, and no more upon holiness, and there we are at a stay, drawing our
breath all our life: a moderation in God's way, now, is much in request. I
profess I have never taken pains to find out him whom my soul loves, there is
a gate yet of finding out Christ, that I have never lighted upon. Oh if I could
find it out! Alas how soon are we pleased with our own shadow in a glass! It
were good to be beginning in sad earnest to find out God, and to seek the
right tread of Christ: time, custom, and a good opinion of our selves, our
good meaning, and our lazy desires, our fair shows, and the world's
glistering lustres, and these broad passements and buskings of religion, that
bear bulk in the Kirk, is that wherewith most satisfy themselves: but a
watered bed with tears a dry throat with praying, eyes a fountain of tears for
the sins of the land is rare to be found among us. Oh if we could know the
power of godliness! This is one part of my case, and an other is, that I like a
fool once summoned Christ for unkindness, and complained of his sickelness and
unconstaney, because he would have no more of my service nor preaching, and had
casten me out of the inheritance of the Lord: And I confess now, this was but a
bought plea, and I was a fool, yet he has born with me: I gave him a fair
advantage against me, but love and mercy would not let him take it: and the
truth is, now he has childed himself friends with me, and has taken away the
mask, and has renewed his wounted favor in such a manner, that he has paid
me my hundredfold in this life; and one to the hundred. This prison is my
banqueting house, I am handled as softly and delicatly as a dated child: I am
nothing behind (I see) with Christ, he can in a month make up a years losses:
and I write this to you, that I may entreat, nay, adjure and charge you, by the
love of our welbeloved to help me to praise, and to tell all your Christian
acquaintance to help me, for I am as deeply drowned in his debt, as any Dyvour
can be: and yet in this fair sun-blenke I have something to keep me from
startling, or being exalted above measure. His word is a fire shut up in my
bowels, and I am weary with forbearing: the ministers in this town are saying
they shall have my prison changed into less bounds, because they see God with
me: my mother has born me a man of contention, one that striveth with the
whole earth. The late wrongs and oppressions done to my brother keep my sails
low: yet I defy crosses to embarke me in such a plea against Christ, as I was
troubled with of late: I hope to overhope and overbeleeve my troubles: I have
cause now to trust Christ's promise, more then his gloom. Remember my hearty
affection to your wife, My soul is grieved for the success of our brethrens
journey to New England, but God has somewhat to reveal that we see not. Grace
be with you. Pray for the prisoner.

To MARGARET BALANTINE. (47)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: It is more then time that I should have
written to you, but it is yet good time, if I could help your soul to mend your
pace, and to go more swiftly to your heavenly country; for truly ye have need
to make all haste, because the inch of your day that remains will quickly
slip away, for whether we sleep or wake our glass runs, the tide bideth no
man: Beware of a beguile in the matter of your salvation: woe, woe for evermore
to them that lose that prize, for what is behind when the soul is once lost;
but that sinners warm their bits of clay-houses at a fire of their own
kindling for a day or two, which does rather suffocat with it is smoke then
warm them, and at length they lie down in sorrow and are clothed with
everlasting shame. I would seek no further measure of faith to begin withal,
then to believe really, and steadfastly the doctrine of God's Justice, his
all-devouring wrath and everlasting burning, where sinners are burnt soul and
body in a river and great lake of fire and brimstone: Then they would wish no
more goods but the thousand part of a cold fountain well to cool their tongue,
they would then buy death with enduring of pain and torment for as many years,
as God has created drops of rain since the creation: but there is no market in
buying or selling life or death there. Oh alas the greatest part of this world
run to the place of that torment rejoicing and dancing, eating, drinking and
sleeping! my counsel to you is, that ye start in time to be after Christ; for
if ye go quickly, Christ is not far before you: Ye shall overtake him. O Lord
God, what is so needful as this, salvation, salvation: Fie upon this condemned
and foolish world that will give so little for salvation. Oh, if there were a
free market of salvation proclaimed in that day when the trumpet of God shall
awake the dead, how many buyers would be then? God send me no more happiness
but that salvation which the blind world [to their eternal woe] lets slip
through their fingers: Therefore look if ye can give out your money [as Isa:
speaks 55: 2.] for bread, and lay Christ and his blood in wodset for heaven:
It is a dry and hungry bairn's-part of goods, that Esau's are hunting for here:
I see thousands following the chase and in the pursuit of such things, while in
the mean time they lose the blessing, and when all is done they have caught
nothing to roast for supper, but lie down hungry; and besides they go to their
bed [when they die] without a candle, for God says to them, Isa: 50: 21. This
shall ye have at my hand, ye shall lie down in sorrow: And truly this is as ill
made a bed to lie upon, as one could wish; for he cannot sleep soundly nor rest
sweetly who has sorrow for his pillow. Rouse, rouse up therefore your soul,
and spier how Christ and your soul met together: I am sure they never got
Christ who were not once sick at the yolk of the heart for him: too too many
whole souls think they have met with Christ who had never a wearied night for
the want of him: But alas, what richer are men that they dreamed the last night
they had much gold, and when they awoke in the morning they found it was but a
dream? what are all the sinners in the world in that day when heaven and earth
shall go up in a flame of fire, but a number of beguiled dreamers? every one
shall say of his hunting and his conquest. Behold it was a dream, every man in
that day will tell his dream. I beseeeh you in the Lord Jesus, beware, beware
of unsound work in the matter of your salvation, ye may not, ye cannot, ye dow
not want Christ: then after this day conveen all your lovers before your soul,
and give them their leave, and strike hands with Christ, that there after there
may be no happiness to you but Christ, no hunting for any thing but Christ, no
bed at night (when death comes) but Christ; Christ, Christ, who but Christ. I
know this much of Christ. He is not ill to befound, not Lordly of his love; woe
had been my part of it for evermore, if Christ had made a dainty of himself to
me; but God be thanked, I gave nothing for Christ; and now I protest before men
and Angels Christ cannot be exchanged. Christ cannot be sold, Christ cannot be
weighed: Where would Angels or all the world find a balance to weigh him in?
All lovers blush when ye stand beside Christ, woe upon all love but the love of
Christ. Hunger, hunger for evermore be upon all heavens but Christ. Shame,
shame for evermore be upon all glory but Christ's glory. I cry death, death
upon all life's but the life of Christ. O what is it that holds us asunder! O
that once we could have a fair meeting. Thus recommending Christ to you, and
you to him for evermore: I rest. Grace be with you.

To JONET KENNEDY. (48)
Loving and Dear Sister.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I received your letter: I know the savor
of Christ in you (that the virgins love to follow) cannot be blown away with
winds either from hell, or the evil smelled air of this polluted world: Sir for
aback from the walls of this pesthouse, even the pollutions of this defiling
world. Keep your taste, your love and hope in heaven, it is not good your love
and your Lord should be in two sundry countries. Up, up after your lover, that
ye and he may be together. A King from heaven has sent for you, by faith he
shows you the new Jerusalem, and takes you along in the Spirit through all
the ease-rooms, and dwellinghouses in heaven, and says, All these are thine,
this palace is for thee and Christ, and if ye only had been the chosen of God,
Christ would have built that one house for you and himself: Now, it is for you
and many also: take with you in your journey what ye may carry with you, your
conscience, faith, hope, patience, meekness, goodness, brotherly kindness; for
such wares as these are of great price in the high and new country whether ye
go: As for other things, that are but the world's vanity and trash, since they
are but the house-sweepings, ye shall do best not to carry them with you, ye
found them here, leave them here, and let them keep the house. Your Sun is well
turned, and low: be nigh your lodging against night. We go, one and one, out
of this great market, till the town be empty, and the two lodgings Heaven and
Hell be filled: At length there will be nothing in the earth but room walls and
burnt ashes, and therefore it is best to make away. Antichrist and his Master
are busy to plenish Hell, and to seduce many; and Stars, great church-lights,
are falling from heaven, and many are missed and seduced and make up with their
faith, and sell their birthright, by their hungry hunting for, I know not
what: Fasten your grips fast upon Christ, I verily esteem him the best aught
that I have: He is my second in prison, having him, though my cross were as
heavy as ten mountains of iron, when he puts his sweet shoulder under me
and it, my cross is but a feather. I please my self in the choice of Christ, he
is my wail in heaven and earth, I rejoice that he is in heaven before me, God
send a joyful meeting; and in the mean time the traveller's charges for the
way, I mean a burden of Christ's love to sweeten the journey, and to encourage
a breathless runner, for when I lose breath climbing up the mountain, he makes
new breath. Now, the very God of peace establish you to the day of his
appearance.

Aberd. Sept. 9* 1637. Your^ in his only Lord Jesus, S. R.

To MARGARET REID. (49)
My very Dear and worthy Si^^er,
GRace, mercy, and peace be to you: Ye are truly blessed of the Lord, however a
lowre world gloom upon you, if ye continue in the faith, grounded and settled
and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel, it is good, there is a
heaven, and it is not a night dream or a fancy: It is a wonder that men deny
not that there is a heaven, as they deny there is a way to it, but of men's
making: You have learned of Christ that there is a heaven; contend for it, and
contend for Christ; bear well and submissivily the hard cross of this
stepmother world, that God will not have to be yours. I confess, it is hard,
and I would I were able to ease you of your burden; But believe me, this
world, [which the Lord will not have to be yours] is but the dross, the refuse
and scum of God's creation, the portion of the Lord's poor hired servants; the
movables, not the heritage; a hard bone casten to the dogs holden out of the
new Jerusalem, whereupon they rather break their teeth then satisfy their
appetite: It is your father's blessing, and Christ's birthright, that our Lord
is keeping for you; and I persuade you, your seed also shall inherit the earth
(if that be good for them) for that i^ promised to them, and God's bond is as
good and better then if men would give every one of them a bond for thousand
thousands. Ere ye was born, cross^s in number, measure and weight were written
for you, and your Lord will lead you through them: make Christ sure, and the
blessings of the earth shall be at Christ's back. I see many professors for the
fashion follow on, but they are professors of glass; I would cause a little
knock of persecution ding them in twenty pieces, and so the world should laugh
at the sheards: Therefore make fast work, see that Christ lay the ground-stone
of your profession, for wind and rain and speats will not wash away his
building: his works have no shorter date then to stand for evermore. I should
twenty times have perished in my affliction if I had not leaned my weak back
and laid my pressing burden both upon the stone, the foundation-stone, the
cornerstone laid in Zion: and I desire never to rise off this stone. Now the
very God of peace confirm and establish you unto the day of the blessed
appearance of Christ Jesus. God be with you.

Aberd. Yours in his dearest Lord Jesus, S. R.

To JAMES BAUTIE. (50)
Loving Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I received your letter and renders you
thanks for the same; but I have not time to answer all the heads of it as the
bearer can inform you. 1. Ye do well to take your self at the right stot when
ye wrong Christ by doubting and misbeleef, for this is to nickname Christ and
term him a liar, which being spoken to our Prince would be hanging or heading,
but Christ hangs not always for treason: It is good that he may registrat a
believers bond a hundred times, and more then seventy times a day have law
against us, and yet he spares us as a man does his son that serves him: No
tender hearted mother who may have law to kill her sucking child, would put in
execution that law. 2. For your failings even ye have a set tryst with Christ
and when ye have a fair seen advantage by keeping your appointment with him,
and Salvation comes to the very passing of the seals: I would say two things.
1. Concluded and sealed Salvation may go through and be ended, suppose ye
write your name to the tail of the Covenant with ink that can hardly be read:
Neither think I ever any man's Salvation passed the seals, but there was an
odd trick or slip in less or more, upon the fools part, who is infested in
heaven: In the most grave and serions work of our Salvation, I think Christ had
ever good cause to laugh at our filliness, and to put on us his merits, that we
might bear weight. 2. It is a sweet law of the new Covenant, and a privilege
of the new burgh, that the citizens pay according to their means, for the new
covenant says not so much obedience by ounce weights, and no less under the
pain of damnation: Christ takes as poor men may give, where there is a mean
portion, he is content with the less; if there be sincerity: broken sums and
little feckless obedience will be pardoned, and hold the foot with him: know ye
not that our kindly Lord retains his good old heart yet? He breaks not a
bruised reed nor quenches the smoking flax: but if the wind blow, he holds
his hands about, it till it rise to a flame. The Law comes on with three
Oyes's, with all the heart: with all the soul, and with all the whole strength:
and where would poor folk like you and me furnish all these sums? it fears
me, (may it is most certain) that if the payment were to come out of our purse,
when we should put our hand in our bag, we would bring out the wind or worse:
But the new Covenant seeks not heap mete nor stented obedience as the
condition of it, because forgiveness has always place. Hence I draw this
conclusion: To think matters betwixt Chirst and us go back for want of heaped
measure, is a piece of old Adam's pride, who would either be at legal payment
or nothing: We would still have God in our common and buy his kindness with our
merits; for beggarly pride is Devil'shonest, and blusheth to be in Christ's
common, and scarce gives God a grammercy and a lifted cap [except it be the
Pharisee's unlucky God I (...) thee] or a bowed knee to Christ: it will only
give a good-day for a good-day again; and if he dissemble his kindness as it
were in jest and seem to misken it, it in earnest spurneth with the heels and
snuffeth in the wind, and cares not much for Christ's kindness: If he will not
be friends let him go, says pride: beware of this thief, when Christ offers
himself. 3. No marvel then of whisperings, whether you be in the Covenant or
not? For Pride it makes loose work of the Covenant of grace, and will not let
Christ be full bargainmaker. To speak to you particularly and shortly. 1. All
the truly regenerated cannot determinatly tell you the measure of their
dejections, because Christ begins young with many and steals into their
heart ere they wit of themselves and becomes homely with them with little din,
or noise. I grant, many are blinded in rejoicing in a good-cheap conversion,
that never cost them a sick night; Christ's physic wrought in a dream upon
them: But for that, I would say; if other marks be found that Christ is indeed
come in, never make a plea with him because he will not answer, Lord Jesus how
came thou in? whether in at door or window? Make him welcome since he is
come. The wind blows where it lists; all the world's wit cannot perfectly
render a reason, why the wind should bea month in the east, six weeks possibly
in the west: and the space only of an afternoon in the south or north: Ye will
not find ^^t all the nicks and steps of Christ's way with a foul do what ye
can; for sometimes he will come in stepping softly, like one walking beside a
sleeping person and slip to the door, and let none know he was there. 2. Ye
object, the truly regenerat should love God for himself: and ye fear that ye
love him more for his benefits (as incitements and motives to love him) then
for himself. I Answer, to love God for himself as the last end, and also for
his benefits as incitements and motives to love him, may stand well together,
as a son loves his mother because she is his mother, howbeit she be poor, and
he loves her for an apple also: I hope ye will not say that benefits are the
only reason and bottom of your love; it seems there is a better foundation
for it: Always if a hole be in it, sow it up shortly. 3. Ye feel not such
mourning in Christ's absence as ye would. I Answer, that the regenerat mourn at
all times, and all in alike measure for his absence, I deny: There are
different degrees of mourning less or more, as they have less or more love to
him and less or more sense of his absence: But, 1. Some they must have. 2.
Sometimes they miss not the Lord, and then they cannot mourn, howbeit it is not
long so: At least it is not always so. 3. Ye challenge your self that some
truths find more credit whith you then others: Ye do well, for God is true
in the least as well as in the greatest, and he must be so to you: Ye must not
call him true in the one page of the leaf, and false in the other, for our Lord
in all his writtings never contradicted himself yet, although the best of the
regenerat have slipped here, always labor ye to hold your feet. 4. Comparing
the estate of one truly regenerat [whose heart is a temple to the Holy Ghost]
and yours [which is full of uncleanness and corruption] ye stand dumb and
discouraged and dare not sometimes call Christ heartsomely your own. I Answer,
the best regenerat have their defilements and [if I may speak so] their
draff-poke that will ^log behind them all their days, and was la as they
will, there will be filth in their bosom: But let not this put you from the
well. 2. I Answer, albeit there be some ounce weights of carnality and some
squint look, or eye in our neck to an idol, yet love in it is own measure may be
sound; for glory must purify and perfect our love, it will never till then be
absolutely pure: yet if the idol reign and have the yolk of the heart and the
keys of the house, and Christ only be made an underling to run erra^ds, all
is not right; therefore examine well. 3. There is a two fold discouragement:
one of unbeleef to conclude and make doubting the conclusion for a mote in your
eye, and a by-look to an idol, this is ill. There is another discouragement of
sorrow for sin, when ye find a by-look to an idol: this is good and a matter
of thanksgiving, therefore examine here also. 5. The assurance of Jesus's love
ye say would be the most comfortable news that ever ye heard: Ans. That may
stop twenty holes, and loose many objections: That love has tellng in it I
trow. Oh that ye knew and felt it as I have done! I wish ye a share of my
feast; sweet, sweet has it been to me: If my Lord had not given me his love, I
would have fallen through the causey of Aberdeen ere now: But for you, hing on,
your feast is not far off, ye shall be filled ere ye go, there is as much in
our Lord's pantry as will satisfy all his bairns, and as much wine in his
cellar as will quench all their thirst: hunger on, for there is meat in hunger
for Christ: Go never from him, but fash him [who yet is pleased with the
importunity of hungry souls] with a dish-full of hungry desires till he fill
it; and if he delay, yet come not ye away, albeit ye should fall a swoon at his
feet. 7. Ye crave my mind, whether found comfort may be found in prayer, when
conviction of a known idol is present. I answer, an idol as an idol can not
stand with found comfort; for that comfort that is gotten at Dagon's sect is a
cheat or blea-flumme: yet sound comfort and conviction of an eye to an idol,
may as well dwell together, as tears and joy: But let this do you no ill, I
speak it for your encouragement, that ye may make the best out of your joys ye
can, albeit ye find them mixed with motes. 2. Sole conviction, if alone
without remorse and grief, is not enough, therefore lend it a tear if ye dow
win at it. 7. Ye question, when ye win to more fervency sometimes with your
neighbor in prayer then your alone, whether hypocrisy be in it, or not? I
answer, if this be always, no question a spice of hypocrisy in in it, which
would be taken head to; out possibly desertion may be in private, and presence
in public, and then the case is clear. 2. A fit of applause may occasion by
accident a rubbing of a cold heart and so heat and life may come, but it is not
the proper cause of that heat: hence God of his free grace will ride his
errands upon our stinking corruption, but corruption is but a mere occasion and
accident; as the playing on a pipe removed anger from the prophet and made him
fitter to prophecy: 2. King. 3: v. 15. 8. Ye complain of Christ's short
visits, that he will not bear you company one night, but when ye lie down warm
at night, ye rise cold at morning. Ans. I cannot blame you [nor any other who
knows that sweet guest] to bemoan his withdrawings, and to be most desirous
of his abode and company; for he would captivat and engage the affection of any
creature that saw his face: since he looked on me and gave me a sight of his
fair love, he gained my heart wholly, and got away with it: Well, well may he
brook it, he shall keep it long ere I fetch it from him. But I shall tell you
what ye shall do: treat him well, give him the chair and the board-head, and
make him welcome to the mean portion ye have; a good supper and kind
entertainment makes the guest love the innes the better: Yet sometimes Christ
has an errand elsewhere, for mere trial, and then though ye give him
king's-chear he will away; as is clear in desertions for mere trial, and not
for sin. 9. Ye seek the difference betwixt the motions of the Spirit in their
least measure, and the natural joys of your own heart. Ans. as a man can tell
if he joy and delight in his wife, as his wife, or if he delight and joy in her
for satisfaction of his lust, but hating her person, and so loving her for her
her flesh and not grieving when ill befalls her: so will a man's joy in God,
and his who ^ish natural joy be discovered, if he sorrow for any thing that
may offend that Lord, it will speak the singleness of his love to him. 10. Ye
ask the reason why sense overcomes faith Ans. because sense is more natural,
and near of kin to our own selfish and soft nature. Ye ask, if faith in that
ease be found? Ans: If it be chased away, it is neither sound nor unsound,
because it is not faith; but it might be and was faith before sense did blow
out the act of believing. Lastly, ye ask what to do when promises are born in
upon you, and sense of impenitency for sins of youth, hinders application. I
answer; if it be living sense, it may stand with application, and in this case,
put to your hand and eat your meat in God's name: if false, so that the sins of
youth are not repented of, then as faith and impenitency cannot stand together,
so neither that sense and application can consist. Brother, excuse my brevity,
for time straitneth me, that I get not my mind said in these things, but must
refer that to a new occasion, if God offer it. Brother, Pray for me. Grace be
with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his dearest Lord Jesus. S. R.

To JOHN STUART. Provest of Air, now in Ireland. (51)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I long to hear from you, being now removed
from my flock and the prisoner of Christ at Aberd: I would not have you to
think it strange that your journey to New England has gotten such a dash: It
indeed has made my heart heavy, yet I know it is no dumb providence but a
speaking one, whereby our Lord speaks his mind to you, though for the
present ye do not well understand what he says, however it be, he who sits
upon the floods has showen you his mavelous kindness in the great depths: I
know your loss is great and your hope is gone far against you; But I entreat
you, Sir, expound aright our Lord's laying an hinderance is the way: I persuade
my self your heart aims at the footsteps of the flock, to feed beside the
shepherds tents, and to dwell beside him whom your soul loves, and that it is
your desire to remain in the wilderness where the woman is kept from the
Dragon, and this being your desire, remember that a poor prisoner of Christ
said it to you, that, That miscarried journey is with child to you of mercy
and consolation: and shall bring forth a fair birth, and the Lord shall be
midwife to the birth: wait on, he that believes makes not haste, Isa: 28. 16.
I hope ye have been asking what the Lord means and what further may be his
will in reference to your return: my dear Brother, let God make of you what he
will, he will end all with consolation, and shall make glory out of your
sufferings, and would ye wish better work: this water was in your way to heaven
and written in your Lord's book, ye behooved to cross it: and therefore kiss
his wise and unerring providence: Let not the censures of men, who see but the
out side of things [and scarce well that] abate your courage and rejoicing in
the Lord, howb^it your faith sees but the black side of providence, yet it
has a better side. and God shall let you see it. Learn to believe Christ
better then his strokes, himself and his promises better then his gloomes:
dashes and disappointments, are not Canonick scripture; fighting for the
promised land, seemed to cry to God's promise, thoulyest. If our Lord rideupon
a straw, his horse shall neither stumble nor fall, Romans 8. 28. For we know that
all things work together for good to them that love God, Ergo shipwrak, losses
etc: work together for the good of them that love God: Hence I infer that
losses, disappointments, ill tongues, loss of friends, houses or country, are
God's work men set on work, to work out good to you out of every thing that
befalls you, let not the Lord's dealing seem harsh, rough, ot unfatherly,
because it is unpleasant; when the Lord's blessed will blows cross your
desires, it is best in humility to strike sail to him, and to be willing to be
led any way our Lord pleases: it is a point of denial of your self, to be as
if ye had not a will, but had made a free disposition of it to God and had sold
it over to him; and to make use of his will for your own, is both true holiness
and your ease and peace: ye know not what the Lord is working out of this, but
ye shall know it hereafter and what I write to you I write to your ^ife, I
compassionat her case; but entreat her not to fear or faint, this journey is a
part of her wilderness to heaven and the promised land, and there are sewer
miles behind, it is nearer the dawning of the day to her, then when she went
out of Scotland: I would be glad to hear that ye and she have comfort and
courage in the Lord. Now as concerning our Kirk: Our Service Book is ordained
by open proclamation and sound of trumpet to be read in all the Kirks of this
Kingdom: Our Prelates are to meet this month for It and our Canons, and for a
Reconciliation betwixt us and the Lutherians. The Professors of
Aberden-Universitie are charged to draw up the Articles of an Uniform
Confession: But Reconciliation with Popery is intended; this is the day of
Jacob's Visitation, the ways of Zion mourn, our gold is become dim, the sun is
gone down upon our Prophets, a dry wind, but neither to fan nor to cleanse is
coming upon this land and all our ill is coming from the multiplied
transgressions of this land and from the friends and lovers of Babel amongst
us, Jer: 31: 35. The violence done to me and my flesh be upon thee Babylon
shall the inhabitants of Zion say and my blood upon the inhabitants of Caldea
shall Jerusalem say. Now for my self, I was three days before the High
Commission, and accused of treason preached against our King: A Minister being
witness went well nigh to swear it: God has saved me from their malice. 1.
They have deprived me of my Ministry. 2. Silenced me, that I exercise no part
of the Ministerial function within this Kingdom, under the pain of Rebellion.
3. Confined my person within the town of Aberden, where I find the Ministers
working for my confine meant in Caithnesse or Orknay far from them; because some
people here (willing to be edified) resort to me. At my first entry I had
heavy challenges within me, and a court fenced [but I hope not in Christ's
name] wherein it was asserted that my Lord would have no more of my service and
was tired of me: And like a fool I summoned Christ also for unkindness, my soul
fainted and I refused comfort and said, what ailed Christ at me, for I desired
to be faithful in his house? thus in my rovings and mistakings my Lord Jesus
bestowed mercy on me, who am less then the least of all saints. I lay upon the
dust and bought a plea from Satan against Christ, and he was content to sell
it, but at length Christ did show himself friends with me and in mercy pardoned
and past my part of it, and only complained, that a court should be holden in
his bounds without his own allowance; now I pass from my compearance, and as
if Christ had done the fault he has made the mends and returned to my soul; so
that now his poor prisoner feeds on the feast of love: my adversaries know
not what a courtier I am now with my Royal King, for whose crown I now suffer,
it i^ but our soft and lazy flesh that has raised an ill report of the cross
of Christ. O sweeet, sweet is his yoke! Christ's chains are of pure gold,
sufferings for him are perfumed: I would not give my weeping for the laughing
of all the fourteen Prelates, I would not exchange my sadness with the world's
joy. O lovely, lovely Jesus, how sweet must thy kisses be when thy cross
smells so sweetly! O if all the three Kingdoms had part of my love feasts,
and of the comforts of a dated prisoner. Dear Brother I charge you to praise
for me and seek help of our acquaintance there, to help me to praise: Why
should I smother Christ's honesty to me: my heart is taken up with this, that
my silence and sufferings may preach; I beseech you in the bowels of Christ to
help me to praise: Remember my love in Christ to your wife, to Mr Blair and Mr
Livingston, and Mr Cuninghame, let me hear from you for I am anxious what to
do: If I saw a call for New England, I would follow it. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in our Lord Jesus, S. R.

To JOHN STUART Provest of Air. [52.]
Much honored and Dearest in Christ.
GRace, mercy and peace from God our father and from our Lord Jesus Christ be
upon you: I expected the comfort of a letter to a prisoner from you ere now. I
am here, Sir, putting off a part of my inch of time, and when I awake first in
the morning [which is always with great heaviness and sadness] this question
is brought to my mind, Am I serving God or not? Not that I doubt of the truth
of this honorable cause wherein I am engaged, [I dare venture in to eternity
and before my judge that I now suffer for the truth: because that I cannot
endure that my Master who is a freeborn King, should pay tribute to any of the
shields or pot-sheards of the earth: Oh that I could hold the crown upon my
Princely King's head with my sinful arm, howbeit it should be stroke from me
in that service from the shoulder blade] but my closed mouth, my dumb Sabbaths,
the memory of my communion with Christ, in many fair, fair days in Anwoth
[whereas now my master gotteth no service of my tongue as then] has almost
broken my faith in two halves; yet in my deepest apprehensions of his anger, I
see through a cloud that I am wrong, and he in love to my soul has taken up the
controversy betwixt faith and apprehensions, and a decret is past on Christ's
side of it, and I subscribe the decret: The Lord is equal in his ways, but my
guiltiness often overmastereth my believing, I have not been well known, for
except as to open out-breakings I want nothing of what Judas and Cain had;
only he has been pleased to prevent me in mercy and to cast me into a fever
of love for himself, and his absence makes my fever most painful, and beside,
he has visited my soul and watered it with his comforts, but yet I have not
what I would, the want of real and felt possession is my only death, I know
Christ pitieth me in this. The great men my friends that did for me, are dried
up like winter brooks of water: All say, no dealing for that man, ^is best will
be, to be gone out of the Kingdom: so I see they tire of me, but believe me I
am most gladly content that Christ breaks all my idols in pieces: it has put
a new edge upon my blunted love to Christ, I see he is Jealouse of my love, and
will have all to himself. In a word these six things are my burden. 1. I am not
in the vineyard as others are, it may be because Christ thinks me a withered
tree not worthy it is room, but God forbid. 2. Woe, woe, woe is coming upon my
harlot-mother this Apostat-kirk, the time is coming when we shall wish for
doves wings to flee and hide us, Oh for the desolation of this land. 3. I see
my dear master Christ going his alone [as it were] mourning in sackeloth, his
fainting friends fear that King Jesus shall lose the field, but he must carry
the day. 4. My guiltiness and the sins of my youth are come up against me, and
they would come in the plea in my sufferings, as deserving causes in God's
justice; but I pray God for Christ's sake he never give them that room, woe's
me that I cannot get my Royal, dreadful, mighty and glorious Prince of the
Kings of the earth set on high. Sir, ye may help me and pity me in this, and
bow your knee and bless his name, and desire others to do it, that he has
been pleased in my sufferings to make Atheists, Papists, and enemies about me,
say, It is like God is with this prisoner. Let hell and the powers of hell [I
care not] be let loose against me to do their worst, so being Christ and my
Father, and his Father be magnified in my sufferings. 6. Christ's love has
pained me, for howbeit his presence has shamed me and drowned me in debt, yet
he often goes away when my love to him is burning, he seems to look like a
proud wooer who will not look upon a poor match who is dying of love, I will
not say he is lordly, but I know he is wise in hiding himself from a child and
a fool, who makes an idol and a God of one of Christ's kisses, which is
Idolatry: I fear I adore his comforts more then himself, and that I love the
apples of life better then the tree of life. Sir write to me. Commend me to
your wife, mercy be her portion. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637 Yours in his dearest Lord Jesus, S. R.

To JOHN STUART. Provest of Air. [53]
Worthy and dearly beloved in our Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I was refreshed and comforted with your
letter: what I wrote to you for your comfort, I do not remember, but I believe
love will prophecy home-ward as it would have it. I wish I could help you to
praise his great and holy name, who keeps the feet of his saints, and has
numbered all your goings. I know our dearest Lord will pardon and pass by our
honest errors and mistakes when we mind his honor; yet I know none of you
have seen the other half and the hidden side of your wonderful return home to
us again. I am confident ye shall yet say that God's mercy blew your sails
back to Ireland again. Worthy and dear Sir, I cannot but give you an account of
my present state, that ye may go an errand for me, to my high and royal
master, of whom I boast all the day. I am as proud of his love, [nay, I bless
my self and boast more of my present lot] as any poor man can be of an earthly
Kings court, or of a Kingdom. First I am very often turning both the sides of
my cross, especially my dumb and silent Sabbaths, not because I desire to find
a crook or defect in my Lord's love, but because love is sick with phansies,
and fears, whether or not the Lord has a process leading against my
guiltiness, that I have not yet well seen: I know not, my desire is to ride
fair, and not to spark dirt [if with reverence of him I may be permitted to
make use of such a word] in the face of my only, only welbeloved; but fear of
guiltness, i^ a talebearer betwixt me and Christ, and is still whispering ill
tales of my Lord, to weaken my faith: I had rather a cloud went over my
comforts by these messages, then that my faith should be hurt, for if my Lord
get no wrong by me, verily I desire grace not to care what become of me. I
desire to give no faith, nor credit to my sorrow, that can make a lie of my
best friend Christ. Woe, woe be to them all who speak ill of Christ. Hence
these thoughts awake with me in the morning and go to bed with me. Oh what
service can a dumb body do in Christ's house! Oh I think the word of God is
imprisoned also! Oh I am a dry tree! Alas I can neither plant, nor water! Oh if
my Lord would make but dung of me, to fatten, and make fertile his own
corn-ridges in mount Sion! Oh if I might but speak to three or four herd-boyes
of my worthy master, I would be satisfied to be the meanest and most obscure of
all the Pastors in this land, and to live in any place, in any of Christ's
basest out-hous^s; but he says, Sir, I ^ill not send you, I have no errands
for you there away: My desire to serve him is sick of jealousy lest he be
unwilling to employ me. Secondly, this is seconded with another, Oh all that I
have done in Anwoth, the fair work that my Master began there, is like a bird
dying in the shell! and what will I then have to show of all my labor in the
day of my compearance before him, when the Master of the vineyard calls the
laborers, and gives them their hire. Thirdly, but truly when Christ's sweet
wind is in the right airth, I repent, and I pray Christ to take law-borrows of
my quarrelous, and unbeleeving sadness and sorrow [Lord rebuke them that put
ill betwixt a poor servant like me, and his good master] then I say whether the
black cross will or not, I must climb, hands and feet up to my Lord. I am now
ruing from my heart, that I pleasure the law [my old dead husband] so far as to
apprehend wrath in my sweet Lord Jesus, I had far rather take an hire to plead
for the grace of God, for I think my self Christ's sworn debtor, and the truth
is to speak of my Lord what I cannot deny, I am over head and ears drowned in
many obligations to his love and mercy, he handles me sometimes so, that I am
ashamed almost to seek more for a four-hours, but to live content till the
marriage-supper of the Lamb with that which he gives; but I know not how
greedy and how ill to please love is, for either my Lord Jesus has taught me
ill manners, not to be content of a seat except my head lie in his bosom, and
except I be fed with the fattest of his house, or else I am grown impatiently
dainty and ill to please, as if Christ were obliged under this cross to do no
other thing but bear me in his arms, and as if I had claim by merit for my
suffering for him: But I wish he would give me grace to learn to go on my own
feet, and to learn to want his comforts, and to give thanks and believe, when
the snn is not in my firmament, and when my welbeloved is from home and gone
another errand. O what sweet peace have I, when I find Christ holds and I
draw, when I climb up and he shuts me down, when I grip him and embrace him,
and he seems to loose the grips and flee away from me: I think there even is
a sweet joy of faith and contentedness and peace in his very tempting
unkindness, because my faith says, Christ is not in sad earnest with me, but
trying if I can be kind to his mask and cloud that covers him, as well as to
his fair face: I bless his great name that I love his vail that goes over his
face while God send better: for faith can kiss Gods tempting reproaches, when
he nicknameth a sinner, a dog, not worthy to eat bread with the bairns, I think
it an honor that Christ miscalleth me and reproacheth me: I will take that
well of him, howbeit I would not bear it well if another would be that homely;
but because I am his own [God be thanked] he may use me as he pleases: I must
say, the saints have a sweet life betwixt them and Christ, there is much sweet
solace of love betwixt him and them, when he feeds among the lilies and
comes in to his garden and makes a feast of honey combs, and drinks his
wine and his milk, and cries, Eat O friends, drink, be ye drunken O
welbeloved. One hour of this labor, is worth a shipfull of world's drunken and
muddy joy: nay even the gate of heaven is the sunny side the of brae and the
very garden of the world; for the men of this world have their own unchristned
and profane crosses and woe be to them and their cursed crosses both; for their
ills are salted with Gods vengeance, and our ills seasoned with our fathers
blessing: So they are no fools who choose Christ and sell all things for him;
it is no bairns market nor a blind block, we know well what we get and what we
give. Now for any resolution to go to any other Kingdom, I dare not speak one
word: my hopes of enlargement are cold, my hopes of re-entry to my Master's ill
dressed, vineyard again are far colder: I have no seat for my faith to sit on
but bare omnipotency, and Gods holy arm and good will, here I desire to stay
and ride at anchor and winter while God send fair weather again, and be pleased
to take home to his house my harlot-mother: Oh if her husband would be that
kind as to go and fetch her out of the brothel-house and chase her lovers to
the hills, but there will be sad days ere it come to that. Remember my bonds.
Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in our Lord Jesus. S. R.

To the Lady Busbie. (54)
MISTRESS.
ALthough not acquaint, yet because we are father's children I thought good to
write unto you: howbeit my first discourse and communing with you of Christ, be
in paper; yet I have cause since I came hither to have no paper-thoughts of
him; for in my sad days he is become the flower of my joys, and I but lie
here, living upon his love; but cannot get so much of it as fain I would have,
not because Christ's love is Lordly and looks too high; but because I have a
narrow vessel to receive his love and I look too low: But I give under my own
hand-write to you a testimonial of Christ and his cross, that they are a sweet
couple, and that Christ has never yet been set in his own due chair of honor
amongst us all. Oh, I know not where to set him! O for a high seat to that
royal princely one! O that my poor withered soul had once a running-over flood
of that love, to put sap in my dry root, and that, that flood would spring out
to the tongue and pen, to utter great things to the high and due commendation
of such a fair one! O holy, holy, holy one! Alas there are too many dumb
tongues in the world, and dry hearts, seeing there is employment in Christ for
them all, and ten thousand worlds of men and Angels more, to set on high and
exalt the greatest Prince of the Kings of the earth. Woe's me that bits of
living clay dare come out to rush hard heads with him, and that my unkind
mother, this harlot-Kirk, has given her sweet half-marrow such a meeting; for
this land has given up with Christ, and the Lord is cutting Scotland in two
halves, and sending the worst half, the harlotsister, over to Rome's
brothell-house, to get her fill of Egypt's love. I would my sufferings [nay,
suppose I were burnt quick to ashes] might buy an agreement betwixt his fairest
and sweetest love, and his gaddy lewd wife: Fain would I give Christ his
welcome-home to Scotland again, if he would return. This is a black day, a day
of clouds and darkness, for the roof-tree of my Lord Jesus his fair temple is
fillen, and Christ's back is toward Scotland. O thrice blessed are they who
would hold Christ with their tears and prayers! I know ye will help to deal
with him, for he shall return again to this land; the next day shall be
Christ's, and there shall be a fair green young garden for Christ in this land,
and God's summerdew shall lie on it all the night, and we shall sing again our
new marriage-song to our Bridegroom, concerning his vineyard; but who knows
whether we shall live and see it? I hear the Lord has taken pains to afflict
and dress you as a fruitful vine for himself, grow and be green, and cast out
your branches and bring forth fruit: fat and green and fruitful may ye be in
the true and sappy root. Grace, grace, free grace be your portion. Remember my
bonds with prayers and praises.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his sweet L. Jesus, S. R.

To NINIAN MURE. (55.)
Loving friend.
I Received your letter: I entreat you now in the morning of your life, seek
the Lord and his face: Beware of the follies of dangerous youth, a perilous
time for your soul: Love not the world, keep faith and truth with all men in
your covenants and bargains: Walk with God, for he sees you: Do nothing but
that which ye may and would do if your eye-strings were breaking, and your
breath growing cold. Ye heard the truth of God from me, my dear heart; follow
it and forsake it not: prize Christ and salvation above all the world: To live
after the guise and course of the rest of the world, will not bring you to
heaven: Without faith in Christ and repentance, ye cannot see God: take pains
for salvation: press forward toward the mark of the prize of the high calling:
If ye watch not against evils, night and day which beset you, ye will come
behind: Beware of lying, swearing, uncleanness and the rest of the works of
the flesh; because for these things the wrath of God comes upon the children
of disobedience; how sweet soever they may seem for the present, yet the end of
these courses is the eternal wrath of God and utter darkness, where there is
weeping and gnashing of teeth. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your Loving Pastor. S. R.

To Mr THOMAS GARVEN. (56)
Reverend and Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I am sorry that what joy and sorrow drew
from my imprisoned pen in my love-fits, has made you and many of God's
children believe, that there is something in a broken reed the like of me,
except that Christ's grace has bought such a sold body, I know not what else
any may think of me, or expect from me: my stock is less [my Lord knows I
speak truth] then many believe: my empty sounds have promised too much: I would
be glad to lie under Christ's feet, and keep and receive the off-fallings or
the old pieces of any grace that fall from his sweet fingers to forlorn
sinners: I lie often uncouth-like, looking in at the King's windows: surely I
am unworthy of a seat in the King's hall-floor: I but often look afar off, both
feared and framed-like to that fairest face, fearing he bid me look away from
him: my guiltiness rises up upon me and I have no answer for it: I offered my
tongue to Christ and my pains in his house, and what know I what it means
when Christ will not receive my poor propine: when love will not take, we
expone, it will neither take nor give, borrow nor lend. Yet Christ has another
sea-compass he saileth by, then my short and raw thoughts: I leave his part of
it to himself. I dare not expound his dealing as sorrow and misbelief often
dictateth to me: I look often with bleared and blind eyes to my Lords cross,
and when I look to the wrong-side of his cross, I know I miss a step and slide:
surely I see I have not legs of my own for carrying me to heaven, I must go in
at heavens gates borrowing strength from Christ. I am often thinking, Oh if he
would but give me leave to love him, and if Christ would but open up his wares,
and the infinite, infinite plyes and windings and corners of his
soul-delighting-love, and let me see it backside and fore-side, and give me
leave but to stand beside it, like an hungry man beside meat, to get my fill of
wondering as a preface to my fill of enjoying: but verily I think my foul eyes
would defile his fair love to look to it: Either my hunger is over humble [if
that may be said] or else I consider not what honor it is to get leave to love
Christ. O that he would pity a prisoner, and let out a flood upon the dry
ground! it is nothing to him to fill the like of me, one of his looks would do
me meekle world's good and him no ill. I know I am not at a point yet with
Christ's love, I am not yet fitted for so much as I would have of it; my hope
sits neighbor with meekle black hunger, and certainly I dow not but think,
there is more of that love ordained for me, then I yet comprehend, and I know
not the weight of the pension the King will give me; I shall be glad, if my
hungry bill get leave to lie beside Christ waiting on an answer: now I would be
full and rejoice, if I got a poor man's alms of that sweetest love: but I
confidently believe there is a bal made for Christ and me, and that we shall
take our fill of love in it: and I often think, when my joy is run out and at
the lowest ebb, that I would seek no more but my rights past the King's great
seal, and that these eyes of mine could see Christ's hand at the pen. If your
Lord call you to suffering, be not dismayed; there shall be a new allowance of
the King for you when ye come to it: One of the softest pillowes Christ has,
is laid under his witnesses head, though often they must set down their bare
feet among thorns. He has brought my poor soul to desire and wish, O that my
ashes and the powder I shall be dissolved into, had well tuned tongues to
praise him. Thus in haste, desiring your prayers and praises, I recommend you
to my sweet, sweet Master, my honorable Lord of whom I hold all. Grace be with
you.

To JEAN BROWN. (57.)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am glad that ye go on at Christ's back in
this dark and cloudy time: It were good to sell other things for him; for when
all these days are over, we shall find it our advantage, that we have taken
part with Christ. I confidently believe his enemies shall be his footstool, and
that he shall make green flowers dead withered hay, when the honor and glory
shall fall off them, like the bloom or flower of a green herb shaken with the
wind. It were not wisdom for us to think that Christ and the Gospel will come
and sit down at our fire side, nay, but we must go out of our warm houses and
seek Christ and his gospel: It is not the sunny side of Christ that we must
look to, and we must not forsake him for want of that, but must set our face
against what may befall us in following on till he and we be through the briers
and bu^hes on the dry ground: Our soft nature would be born through the
troubles of this miserable life in Christ's arms: and it is his wisdom who
knows our mould, that his bairns go wet-shod and cold-footed to heaven. O
how sweet a thing were it for us, to learn to make our burdens light, by
framing our hearts to the burden and making our Lord's will a law! I find
Christ and his cross not so ill to please, nor yet such troublesome guests as
men call them: Nay, I think patience should make Christ's water good wine; and
this dross good metal: and we have cause to wait on, for ere it be long, our
Master will be at us, and bring this whole world out before the sun and the
daylight in their black's and white's: Happy are they who are found watching:
Our sand-glass is not so long as we need to weary; time will eat away and root
out our woes, and sorrow: our heaven is in the bud and growing up to an
harvest; why then should we not follow on seeing our span length of time will
come to an inch: Therefore I commend Christ to you as your last living, and
longest living husband, and the staff of your old age: let him have now the
rest of your days; and think not much of a storm upon the ship that Christ
saileth in, there shall no passenger fall over board, but the craised ship and
the sea-sick passenger shall come to land safe. I am in as sweet communion with
Christ as a poor sinner can be, and am only pained that he has much beauty
and fairness, and I little love, he great power and mercy and I little faith,
he much light and I bliered eyes. Oh that I saw him in the sweetness of his
love and in his marriage clothes, and were over head and ears in love with that
princely one Christ Jesus my Lord! Alas, my riven dish and running-out vessel
can hold little of Christ Jesus. I have joy in this, that I would not refuse
death before I put Christ's lawful heritage in men's trysting, and what know I,
if they would have pleased both Christ and me. Alas, that this land has put
Christ to open rooping, and to an any man more b^^ Blessed are they who would
hold the crown on his head, and buy Christ's honor with their own losses. I
rejoice to hear your son John is coming to visit Christ and taste of his love:
I hope he shall not lose his pains or rue of that choice. I had always [as I
said often to you] a great love to dear Mr John Brown because I thought I saw
Christ in him more then in his brethren, fain would I write to him to stand by
my sweet Master, and I wish ye would let him read my letter, and the joy I
have, if he will appear for, and side with my Lord Jesus. Grace, grace, be
with you.

Loving Sister.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I cannot come to you to give you my counsel,
and howbeit I would come I cannot stay with you; but I beseech you keep Christ,
for I did what I could to put you within grips of him; I told you Christ's
Testament and latterwill plainly, and I kept nothing back that my Lord gave me,
and I gave Christ to you with good will: I pray you make him your own, and go
not from that truth I taught you in one hair breadth, that truth shall save you
if ye follow it: salvation is not an easy thing and soon gotten; I often told
you few are saved, and many, many damned: I pray you make your poor soul sure
of salvation, and make the seeking of heaven your daily task: if ye never had a
sick night and a pained soul for sin, ye have not yet lighted upon Christ; look
to the right marks of having closed with Christ, if ye love him better then the
world, and would quite all the world for him then that says the work is sound.
O if ye saw the beauty of Jesus and felt the smell of his love, ye would run
through fire and water to be at him: God send you him. Pray for me, for I
cannot forget you. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your loving Pastor, S. R.

To the Lady Busbie. (59)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you. I am glad to hear that Christ and ye are
one, and that ye have made him your one thing: Whereas many are painfully
t^iled in seeking many things and their many things are nothing. It Is only
best, ye set your self apart as a thing laid up and out of the gate for Christ
alone, for ye are good for no other thing but Christ, and he has been going
about you these many years by afflictions, to engage you to himself, it were a
pity and a loss to say him nay. Verily I could wish, that I could swim through
hell and all the ill weather in the world and Christ in my arms; but it is my
evil and folly, that except Christ come unsent for, I dow not go to seek, him:
When he and I fall in reckoning, we are both behind, he in payment, and I in
counting, and so marches lie still unrid and counts uncleared betwixt us. O
that he would take his own blood for counts and miscounts, that I might be a
free man, and none had any claim to me, but only, only Jesus. I will think it
no bondage to be rooped, comprised and possessed by Christ, as his bondman.
Think well of the visitations of your Lord: For I find one thing I saw not
well before, that when the saints are under trials and well humbled, little
sins raise great cries and war-shouts in the conscience; and in prosperity
conscience is a Pope to give dispensations, and let out and in, and give
latitude, and elbow-room to our heart. O how little care we for pardon at
Christ's hand, when we make dispensations! And all is but bairns-play, till a
cross without, beget an heavier cross within, and then we play no longer with
our Idols: It is good still to be severe against ourselves, for we but
transform God's mercy into an Idol, and an Idol that has a dispensation to
give for turning of the grace of God into wantonness. Happy are they who take
up God, wrath, justice and sin, as they are in themselves: For we have
miscarrying light that parts with child, when we have good resolutions: But
God be thanked that Salvation is not rolled upon our wheels. O but Christ has
a saving eye! Salvation is in his eyelids: When he first looked on me, I was
saved; It cost him but a look to make hell quite of me: O merits, free merits,
and the dear blood of God, was the best gate that ever we could have gotten of
hell! O what a sweet, O what a safe and sure way is it, to come out of hell
leaning on a Savior! That Christ and a sinner should be one and have heaven
betwixt them and be halvers of Salvation, is the wonder of Salvation: What more
humble could love be? and what an excellent smell does Christ cast on his
lower garden, where there grow but wild flowers, if we speak by way of
comparison; but there is nothing but perfect garden flowers in heaven, and the
best plenishing that is there, is Christ: We are all obliged to love heaven for
Christ's sake, he graceth heaven and all his father's house with his presence:
He is a rose that beautifieth all the upper garden of God; a leaf of that rose
of God, for smell, is worth a world: O that he would blow his smell upon a
withered and dead soul, let us then go on to meet with him and to be filled
with the sweetness of his love: Nothing will hold him from us; he has decreed
to put time, sin, hell, devils, men and death out of the way, and to rid the
rough way betwixt us and him, that we may enjoy one another. It Is strange and
wonderful that he would think long in heaven without us, and that he would
have the company of sinners to solace and delight himself withal in heaven.
and now the supper is abiding us: Christ the bridegroom with desire is waiting
on till the bride, the Lamb's wife, be busked for the marriage, and the great
hall be rid for the meeting of that joyful couple. O fools, what do we here?
and why sit we still? Why sleep we in the prison? Were it not best to make us
wings to flee up to our blessed match, our marrow and our fellow-friend? I
think, Misterss, ye are looking there-away, and this is your second or third
thought: make forward, your guide waits on you. I cannot but bless you for
your care and kindness to the saints. God give you to find mercy in that day
of our Lord Jesus, to whose saving grace I recommend you.

To WILLIAM RIGGE. Of Athernie. (60.)
Much honored and worthy Sir.
YOur letter full of complaints bemoaning your guiltiness has humbled me; but
give me leave to say, ye seem to be too far upon the law's side, ye will not
gain much to be the Law's Advocat, I thought ye had not been the law's but
grace's man; Nevertheless I am sure ye desire to take God's part against your
self: what ever your guiltiness be, yet when it falls into the sea of God's
mercy, it is but like a drop of blood fallen in the great Ocean: There is
nothing here to be done, but let Christ's doom light upon the old man, and let
him bear his condemnation, seeing in Christ he was condemned; for the Law has
but power over your worst half; let the blame therefore lie where the blame
should be and let the new man be sure to say, I am comely as the tents of
Kedar, how beit I be black and sunburned by sitting neighbor beside a body of
sin: I seek no more here but room for Grace's defense and Christ's white throne
whereto a sinner condemned by the law may appeal: But the use that I make of ^t,
is, I am sorry that I am not so tender and thin skinned, though I am sure Christ
may find employment for his calling in me, if in any living, seeing from my
youth upward I have been making up the blackest process that any minister in
the world, or any other can answer to: and when I had done this, I painted a
providence of my own, and wrote ease for my self and a peaceable ministry and
the sun shining on me, till I should be in at heaven's gates: Such green and
raw thoughts had I of God. I thought also of a sleeping Devil that would pass
by the like of me, lying in moors and out-fields: So I bigged the gook's nest,
and dreamed of dying at ease and living in a fools paradise; but since I came
hither I am often so, as that they would have much Rhetoric that would
persuade me, that Christ has not written wrath on my dumb and silent Sabbaths
[which is a persecution of the latest edition, being used against none in this
land, that I can learn of besides me] and often I lie under a non-entry, and
would gladly sell all my joys to be confirmed King Jesus's free tennent, and
to have sealed assurances; but I see often blank papers: and my greatest
desires are these two. 1. That Christ would take me in hand to cure me, and
undertake for a sick man, I know I should not die under his hand: and yet in
this, while I still doubt, I believe through a cloud, that sorrow which has no
eyes; has but put a vail on Christ's love. 2. It pleases him often since I
came hither, to come with some short blenks of his sweet love, and then because
I have none to help me to praise his love, and can do him no service in my own
person, [as I thought once I did in his temple] then I die with wishes and
desires, to take up house and dwell at the well-side and to have him praised
and set on high: But alas, what can the like of me do to get a good name
raised upon my welbeloved Lord Jesus, suppose I could desire to be suspended
for ever of my part of heaven for his glory? I am sure, If I could get my will
of Christ's love, and could be once over head and ears in the believed,
apprehended, and seen love of the Son of God, it were the fulfilling of the
desires of the only happiness I would be at; but the truth is, I hinder my
communion with him, because of want of both faith and repentance, and because I
will make an idol of Christ's kisses: I will neither lead nor drive, except I
see Christ's love run in my channel and when I wait and look for him the upper
way, I see his wisdom is pleased to play me a slip and come the lower way; so
that I have not the right art of guiding Christ: for there is art and wisdom
required in guiding of Christ's love aright, when we have gotten it. O how far
are his ways above mine! O how little of him do I see! and when I am as dry
as a burnt heath in a drouthy summer, and when my root is withered, howbeit I
think then that I would drink a sea-full of Christ ere ever I would let the cup
go from my head; yet I get nothing but delays, as if he would make hunger my
daily food: I think my self also hungered of hunger; The rich Lord Jesus
satisfy a famished man. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 10. Sept. 1637. Your own in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To his worthy and much honored friend FULK ELIES. (61)
Worthy and much honored in our Lord
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am glad of our more then
paper-acquaintance: Seeing we have one father, it reckons the less though we
never saw one another faces. I profess my self most unworthy to follow the
camp of such a worthy and renowned captain, as Christ. Oh alas, I have cause to
be grieved, that men expect any thing of such a wretched man as I am: It is a
wonder to me, if Christ can make any thing of my naughty, short and narrow
love to him; surely it is not worth the up-taking. 2. As for our lovely and
beloved Church in Ireland, my heart bleedeth for her desolation; but I believe
our Lord is only lopping the vinetrees, but not intending to cut them down or
root them out. It is true, seeing we are heart-Atheists by nature, and cannot
take providence aright, [because we halt and crook ever since we fell] we dream
of an halting providence, as if God's yard whereby he measures joy and sorrow
to the sons of men, were crooked and unjust, because servants are on horseback
and Princes go on foot; but our Lord deals good and evil and some one
portion or other to both, by ounce-weights; and measures them in a just and
even balance. It is but folly to measure the Gospel by summer or
winter-weather: The summer-sun of the saints, shines not on them in this life:
how should we have complained if the Lord had turned the same providence, that
we now stomach at, up-side down, and had ordered matters thus, that first the
saints should have enjoyed heaven, glory, and ease, and then Methusalem's days
of sorrow and daily miseries; we should think a short heaven no heaven:
certainly his ways pass finding out. 3. Ye complain of the evil of
heart-atheism, but it is to a greater atheist then any man can be, that ye
write to of that: Oh, light finds not that reverence and fear as a plant of
God's setting should find in our soul! How do we by nature, as others, detain
and captivat the truth of God in unrighteousness, and so make God's light a
bound prisoner, and even when the prisoner breaks the jayle and comes out in
belief of a Godhead, and in some practice of holy obedience; how often do we
of new, lay h^nds on the prisoner and put our light again in fetters: Certainly
there comes great mist and clouds from the lower part of our soul, our earthly
affections, to the higher part, which is our conscience, either natural or
renewed, as smoke in a lower house breaks up and defiles the house above: If
we had more practice of obedience, we should have more sound light. I think,
lay aside all other guiltiness, this one, the violence done to God's candle in
our soul, were a sufficient dittay against us; for there is no helping of this,
but by striving to stand in aw of God's light; lest light tell tales of us we
de^re little to hear: but since it is not without God that light sits
neighbor to will [a lawless Lord] no marvel that such a neighbor should
l^aven our Judgment and darken our light. I see there is a necessity that we
protest against the doings of the old man, and raise up a party against our
worst half to accuse, condemn, sentence, and with sorrow bemoan the dominion of
sin's Kingdom and withal, make Law in the new Covenant against our guiltness;
for Christ once condemned sin in the flesh and we are to condemn it over again:
and if there had not been such a thing as the grace of Jesus, I should have
long since given up with heaven and with the expectation to see God: But grace,
grace, free grace, the merits of Christ for nothing, white and fair and large
Saviour-mercy [which is another sort of thing then creature-mercy, or
law-mercy; yea a thousand degrees above Angel-mercy] has been and must be the
rock, that we drowned souls must swim to: New washing, renewed application of
purchased redemption by that sacred blood, that seals the free Covenant is a
thing of daily and hourly use to a poor sinner: Till we be in heaven our issue
of blood will not be quite dried up, and therefore we must resolve to apply
peace to our soul from the new and living way, and Jesus who cleanses and
cures the leprous^^oul, lovely Jesus, must be our song on this side of heavens
gates: and even when we have won the castle, then must we eternally sing,
Worthy, worthy is the Lamb, who has saved us and washed us in his own blood. I
would counsel all the ransomed ones to learn this song, and to drink and be
drunk with the love of Jesus. O fairest, O highest, O loveliest one, open the
well! O water the burnt and withered travelers with this love of thine! I
think it is possible on earth to build a young new Jerusalem, a little new
heaven of this surpassing love. God either send m^ more of this love, or take
me quickly over the water, where I may be filled with his love: My softness
cannot take with want; I profess I bear not hunger of Christ's love fair: I
know not if I play foul play with Christ, but I would have a link of that chain
of his providence mended in pining and delaying the hungry on-waiters: For my
self I could wish that Christ would let out upon me more of that love: Yet to
say Christ is a niggard to me, I dare not; and if I say, I have abundance of
his love I should lie: I am half straightened to complain and cry, Lord Jesus hold
thy hand no longer. Worthy Sir, let me have your prayers in my bonds. Grace be
with you.

Aberd. 7 Septr, 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord. Jesus, S. R.

To JAMES LINDSAY. (62.)
Dear Brother.
THe constant and daily observing of God's going along with you, in his
coming, going, ebbing, flowing, embracing and kissing, glooming and striking
gives me [a witless and lazy observer of the Lord's way and working] an
heavy stroke: could I keep sight of him, and know when I want, and carry as
became me in that condition, I would bless my case. But. 1. For desertions, I
think them like lying-lay of lean and weak land, for some years, while it
gather sap for a better crope: It is possible to gather gold where it may be
had with moon light. Oh if I could but creep one foot, or half a foot nearer in
to Jesus in such a dismal night as that, when he is away: I should think it an
happy absence. 2. If I knew the beloved were only gone away for trial, and
for further humiliation, and not smoked out of the house with new provocations,
I would forgive desertions, and hold my peace at his absence, but Christ's
bought absence [that I bought with my sin] is two running boils at once, one
upon either side, and what side then can I lie on? 3. I know as night and
shaddows are good for flowers, and moonlight, and dews are better then a
continual sun; so is Christ's absence of special use, and it has some
nourishing virtue in it, and gives sap to humility, and puts an edge on
hunger, and furnishes a fair field to faith to put forth it self, and to
exercise it is fingers in gripping, it sees not what. 4. It is mercy's wonder,
and grace's wonder, that Christ will lend a piece of the lodging, and a
back-chamber beside himself to our lusts, and that he and such swine should
keep house together in our soul: For suppose they couch and contract themselves
into little room, when Christ comes in, and seem to lie as dead under his
feet; yet they often break out again: And that a foot of the old man, or a leg
or arm nailed to Christ's cross loses the nail or breaks out again; and
yet Christ beside this unruly and misnurtured neighbor can still be making
heaven in the saints one way or other, may not I say, Lord Jesus, what do
thou here? Yet here he must be; but I will but lose my feet to go on into this
depth and wonder, for free mercy and infinite merits took a lodging to Christ
and us beside such a loath some guest as sin. 5. Sanctification and
mortification of our lusts, are the hardest part of Christianity: It is in a
manner as natural to us to leap when we see the new Jerusalem, as to laugh
when we are tickled, joy is not under command, or at our nod when Christ
kisseth: but O how many of us would have Christ divided in two halves, that we
might take the half of him only and take his office Jesus and salvation, but
Lord is a cumbersome word, and to obey and work out our own salvation and to
perfect holiness, is the cumbersome and stormy north-side of Christ, and that
we eshew and shift. 6. For your question, the access that reprobats have to
Christ [which is none at all, for to the Father in Christ neither can they, nor
will they come, because Christ dyed not for them; and yet by law, God and
justice overtaketh them] I say, First, there are with you more worthy and
learned then I am Mrs Dickson, Blair, and Hamilton who can more fully satisfy
you; but I shall speak in brief what I think of it in these assertions. 1. All
God's justice toward man and Angels flows from an act of the absolut
sovereign free will of God, who is our former and potter, and we are but clay;
for if he had forbidden to eat of the rest of the trees of the Garden of Eden,
and commanded Adam to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that
command no doubt had been as just as this, Eat of all the trees, but not at all
of the tree of knowledge of good and evil: The reason is, because his will is
before his justice by order of nature, and what is his will, is his justice,
and he wills not things without himself because they are just: God cannot,
God needs not to hunt sanctity, holiness or righteousness from things without
himself, and so not from the actions of men or Angels; because his will is
essentially holy and just, and the prime rule of holiness and justice: as the
fire is naturally light, and inclines upward and the earth heavy, and
inclines downward. The 2 assertion then is, that God says to reprobats
believe in Christ [who has not dyed for your salvation] and ye shall be saved,
is just and right, because his eternal and essentially just will, has so
enacted and decreed: Suppose natural reason speak against this, this is the
deep and special mystery of the Gospel. God has obliged hard and fast all the
reprobats in the visible Church to believe his promise, he that believes shall
be saved, and yet in God's decree and secret intention, there is no salvation
at all decreed and intended to reprobats; and yet the obligation of God being
from his Sovereign free will, is most just, as said is in the first assertion.
3. Assertion: The righteous Lord has right over the reprobats and all
reasonable creatures that violat his commandments, this is easy. 4.
Assertion: the faith that God seeks of reprobats, is, That they rely upon
Christ as despairing of their own righteousness, leaning wholly, and withal
humbly, as weary and leaden, upon Christ, as on the resting stone laid in Sion;
but he seeks not that without being weary of their sin they rely on Christ,
mankind's Savior; for to rely on Christ and not to weary of sin, is
presumption, not faith: faith is ever neighbor to a contrite spirit, and it is
impossible that faith can be where there is not a casten down and contrite
heart in some measure for sin: Now it is certain God commands no man to
presume. 5. Assertion: then Reprobats are not absolutely obliged to believe,
that Christ dyed for them in particular; for in truth neither reprobats nor
others are obliged to believe a lie, only they are obliged to believe, Christ
dyed for them, if they be first weary, burdened, sin-sick and condemned in
their own consciences, and stricken dead and killed with the law's sentence, and
have indeed embraced him as offered, which is a second and subsequent act of
faith, following after a coming to him, and closing with him. 6. Assertion:
Reprobatsare not formally guilty of comtempt of God, and misbelief because they
apply not Christ and the promises of the Gospel to themselves in particular,
for so they should be guilty because they believe not a lie, which God never
obliged them to believe. 7. Assertion: justice has a right to punish
reprobats, because out of pride of heart, confiding in their own righteousness,
they rely not upon Christ, as a Savior of all them that come to him: This, God
may justly oblige them unto; Because in Adam they had perfect ability to do,
and men are guilty because they love their own inability and rest upon
themselves, and refuse to deny their own righteousness, and to take them to
Christ, in whom there is righteousness for wearied sinners. 8. Assertion: It is
one thing to rely, lean, and rest upon Christ in humility and weariness of
spirit, and denying our own righteousness believing him to be the only
righteousness of wearied sinners, and it is another thing to believe Christ
dyed for me, John, Thomas, Anna, upon an intention and decree to save us by
name. For 1. the first goes first, the latter is always after in due order 2.
The first is faith, the second is a fruit of faith. 3. The first obliges
reprobats and all men in the visible Kirk, the latter obliges only the weary
and leaden, and so only the elect and effectually called of God. 9. Assertion:
It is a vain order, I know not if Christ dyed for me, John, Thomas, Anna by
name; and therefore I dare not rely on him? The reason is, because It is not
faith, to believe God's intention and decree of election at the first, ere ye
be wearied: look first to your own intention and soul, if ye find sin a
burden, and can, and do rest, under that burden upon Christ; if this be once,
now come and believe in particular or rather apply by sense [for in my
judgment it is a fruit of belief, not belief] and feeling the goodwill,
intention, and gracious purpose of God anent your salvation: Hence because
there is malice in reprobats and contempt of Christ, guilty they are; and
justice has law against them: And which is the mystery, they cannot come up to
Christ because he dyed not for them; but their sin is, that they love this
their inability to come to Christ, and he who loves his chains, deserves
chains: And thus in short remember my bonds.

Aberd. Sept, 7. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To the Earl of Cassills. (63)
My very honorable and Noble Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to your Lo: pardon me to express my earnest desire
to your Lo: for Zions sake, for whom we should not hold our peace. I know your
Lo: will take my pleading on this behalf in the better part, because the
necessity of a falling and weak church is urgent. I believe your Lo: is one of
Zion's friends, and that by obligation; for when the Lord shall count and write
up the people, it shall be written this man was born there: Therefore because
your Lo: is a born son of the house, I hope your desire is, that the beauty and
glory of the Lord may dwell in the midst of the city, whereof your Lo: is a
son. It must be without all doubt the greatest honor of your place and house,
to kiss the son of God, and for his sake to be kind to his oppressed and
wronged bride, who now in the day of her desolation beggeth help of you that
are the shields of the earth: I am sure ma^y Kings, Princes and Nobles in the
day of Christ's second coming, would be glad to run errands for Christ, even
bare footed through fire and water; but in that day he will have none of their
service: Now he is asking if your Lo: will help him against the mighty of the
earth, when men are setting their shoulders to Christ's fair and beautiful
tent in this land, to loose it is stakes and to break it down, and certainly
such as are not with Christ are against him: and blessed shall your Lo: be of
the Lord, blessed shall your house and seed be, and blessed shall your Honor
be, if ye empawnd and lay in Christ's hand the Earledom of Cassills [and it is
but a shadow in comparison of the city made without hands] and lay it even at
the stake, rather then Christ and born-down truth want a witness of you,
against the apostasy of this land. Ye hold your lands of Christ, your charters
are under his seal, and he who has many crowns on his head, deals, cutteth,
and carveth pieces of this clay-heritage to men at his pleasure. It is little
your Lo: has to give him, he will not sleep long in your common, but shall
surely pay home your losses for his cause. It is but our bliered eyes that look
through a false glass to this idol-god of clay and think some thing of it: They
who are past with their last sentence to heaven or hell, and have made their
reckoning and departed out of this smoky inn, have now no other conceit of
this world, but as a piece of beguiling, wel-lustred clay: and how fast does
time [like a flood still in motion] carry your Lo: out of it? and is not
eternity coming with wings? Court goes not in heaven as it does here. Our
Lord, [who has all you the Nobles lying in the shell of his ballance]
esteems you, accordingly as ye are the bridegroom's friends or foes. Your
Honorable Ancestors with the hazard of their lives brought Christ to our
hands, and it shall be cruelty to the posterity if ye lose him to them. One of
our tribes, Levi's Sons, the watchmen, are fallen from the Lord, and have sold
their mother, and their father also, and the Lord's truth, for their new
velvet-world, and there satin-church. If ye the Nobles play Christ a slip, now
when his back is at the wall [if I may so speak] then may we say that the Lord
has casten water upon Scotland's smoking coal: But we hope better things of
you. It is no wisdom; however it be the State-wisdom now in request, to be
silent, when they are casting lots for a better thing then Christ's coat. All
this land, and every man's part of the play for Christ, and the tears of poor
and friendless Zion [now going doollike in sackcloth] are up in heaven before
our Lord, and there is no question but our king and Lord shall be master of the
fields at length, and we would all be glad to divide the spoil with Christ,
and to ride in triumph with him; but Oh how few will take a cold bed of straw
in the camp with him! How fain would men have a wel-thatched house above their
heads, all the way to heaven? And many now would go to heaven the land way
[for they love not to be sea-sick] riding up to Christ upon footmantles, and
rattling coaches, and rubbing their velvet with the Princes of the Land, in the
highest seats. If this be the way Christ called strait and narrow. I quite all
skill of the way to salvation. Are they not now rooping Christ and the Gospel?
Have they not put our Lord Jesu to the market and he who outbideth his fellow,
shall get him? O my Dear and Noble Lord, go on [howbeit the wind be in your
face] to back our princely Captain, be courageous for him: fear not these who
have no subscribed lease of days, the worms shall eat kings, let the Lord
Jehovah be your fear: And then, as the Lord lives the victory is yours. It is
true many are striking up a new way to heaven, but my soul for theirs, if they
find it, and if this be not the only way whose end is Christ's father's
house: And my weak experience since the day I was first in bonds has confirmed
me in the truth and assurance of this: Let doctors and learned men cry the
contrair, I am persuaded this is the way: the bottom has fallen out of both
their wit and conscience at once, their book has beguiled them, for we have
fallen upon the true Christ. I dare hazard, if I alone had ten souls, my
salvation upon this stone that many now break their bones upon. Let them take
this fat world, Oh poor and hungry is their paradise! Therefore let me entreat
your Lo: By your compearance before Christ, now while this piece of the
afternoon of your day is before you, [for ye know not when your sun will turn,
and eternity shall benight you] let your glory, honor and might worldly, be,
for our Lord Jesus: And to his rich grace, and tender mercy, and to the
never-dying comforts of his gracious Spirit I recommend your Lo: And Noble
house.

To the Lady Largirie. (64)
MISTRESS.
GRace, Mercy and Peace be to you. I hope ye know what conditions past betwixt
Christ and you at your first meeting: Ye remember he said, your summer days
would have clouds and your rose a prickly thorn bend it: Christ is unmixt in
heaven, all sweetness and honey, here we have him with his thorny and rough
cross; yet I know no tree bears sweeter fruit then Christ's cross, except I
would raise a lving report on it: It is your part to take Christ as he is to be
had in this life: Sufferings are like a wood planted round about his house,
over door and window: If we could hold fast our grips of him; the field were
won: Yet a little while and Christ shall triumph: Give Christ his own short
time to spin, out these two long threeds of heaven and hell to all mankind, for
certainly the thread will not break; and when he has accomplished his work in
mount Zion and has refined his silver, he will bring new vessels out of the
furnace, and plenish his house and take up house again. I counsel you to free
your self of clogging temptations, by overcoming some, and contemning others;
and watching over all: abide true and loyal to Christ, for few now are fast to
him: they give Christ blank paper for a bond of service and attendance, now
when Christ has most ado: to waste a little blood with Christ, and to put out
part of this drossie world in pawn over in his hand, as willing to quite it
for him, is the safest cabinet to keep the world in: But these who would take
the world and all their flitring on their back and run away from Christ, they
will fall by the way and leave their burden behind them, and be taken captive
themselves. Well were my soul to put all I have; life and soul, over in
Christ's hands; let him be forthcoming for all. If any ask, how I do? I
answer, none can be but well that are in Christ: And if I were not so, my
sufferings had melted me away in ashes and smoke; I thank my Lord that he has
something in me that this fire cannot consume. Remember my love to your husband
and show him from me, I desire that he may set aside all things and make sure
work of salvation, that it be not a seeking when the sand-glass is run out, and
time and eternity shall tryst together: There is no errand so wieghty as this:
O that he would take it to heart. Grace be with you.

Aberd. Yours in Christ Jesus his Lord. S. R.

To the Lady DUNGUEIGH. (65)
MISTRESS.
I Long to hear from you, and how ye go on with Christ: I am sure that Christ
and ye once met: I pray you fasten your grips; there is holding and drawing and
much sea-way to heaven, and we are often sea-sick; but the voyage is so
needful, that we must on any terms take shipping with Christ. I believe it is
a good country we are going to, and there is ill lodging in this smoaky house
of the world, in which we are yet living. Oh that we should love smoke so well
and clay, that holds our feet fast! It were our happiness to follow on after
Christ, and to anchor our selves upon the rock in the upper side of the vail.
Christ and Satan are now drawing to parties, and they are blind who see not
Scotland divided in two camps, and Christ coming out with his white banner of
love, and he hangs that over the heads of his soldiers: And the other
Captain, the Dragon, is coming out with a great black flag, and cries, the
world, the world, case, honor, and a whole skin, and a soft couch, and there
lie they, and leave Christ to fend for himself: My counsel is that ye come out
and leave the multitude and let Christ have your company: Let them take clay
and this present world who love it: Christ is a more worthy and noble portion:
Blessed are these who get him: It is good ere the storm rise to make ready all,
and to be prepared to go to the camp with Christ, seeing he will not keep the
house, nor sit at the fireside with couchers: A shower for Christ is little
enough Oh I find all too little for him! Woe, woe, woe's me, that I have no
propine for my Lord Jesus: My love is so feckless that it is a shame too offer
it to him. Oh if it were as broad as heaven, as deep as the sea, I would gladly
bestow it upon him! I pers^ade you God is wringing grapes of red wine for
Scotland, and this land shall drink and spue and fall: His enemies shall drink
the thick of it and the grounds of it: But Scotland's withered tree shall
blossom again, and Christ shall make a second marriage with her, and take home
his wife out of the furnace; but if our eyes shall see it, he knows who has
created time. Grace be with you.

Loving Sister.
GRace, mercy, and peace be to you: Hold on your course, for it may be, I will
not soon see you: venture through the thick of all things after Christ, and
tine not your Master Christ in the throng of this great market. Let Christ know
how heavy and how many a stone weight you and your cares, burdens, crosses, and
sins are; let him bear all: Make the heritage sure to your self, get charters
and writs pass^d and through, and put on arms for the battle, and keep you fast
by Christ, and then let the wind blow out of what airth it will, your soul will
not blow in the sea. I find Christ the most steadable friend and companion in
the world to me now: the need and usefulness of Christ i seen best in trials.
Oh if hebe not well worthy of his room! Lodge him in house and heart; and stir
up your husband to seek the Lord: I wonder he has never written to me: I do
not forget him. I taught you the whole counsel of God and delivered it to you,
it will be inquired for, at your hands, have it in readiness against the time
that the Lord ask for it: make you to meet the Lord; and rest and sleep in the
love of that fairest among the sons of men: Desire Christ's beauty: give out
all your love to him and let none fall by: Learn in prayer to speak to him:
help your mother's soul, and desire her from me to seek the Lord and his
salvation, it is not soon found, many miss it. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your Loving Pastor. S. R.

To my Lord CRAIGHALL. (67)
My Lord.
I cannot expound your Lo: contrary tides and these tentations wherewith ye are
assaulted to be any other thing but Christ trying you, and saying unto you and
will ye also leave me. I am sure Christ has a great advantage against you, if
ye play foul play to him, in that the holy Spirit has done his part, in
evidencing to your conscience, that this is the way of Christ wherein ye shall
have peace, and the other, as sure as God lives, the Antichrist's way:
Therefore as ye fear God, fear your light and stand in aw of a convincing
conscience: it is far better for your Lo: to keep your conscience, and to
hazard in such a honorable cause, your place; then wilfully and against your
light to come under guiltiness: Kings cannot heal broken consciences; and when
death and judgment shall comprize your soul, your counselors and others
cannot become caution to Justice for you. Ere it be long our Lord will put a
final determination to Acts of Parliament and men's laws, and will clear you
before men and Angels of men's unjust sentences. Ye received honor, and place,
and Authority, and riches and reputation from your Lord, to set forward and
advance the liberties and freedom of Christ's Kingdom: Men whose consciences
are made of stoutness, think little of such matters, which notwithstanding
incroach directly upon Christ's prerogative royal. So would men think it a
light matter for VZZah to put out his hand to hold the Lord's falling ark, but
it cost him his life. And who doubts but a carnal friend will advise you to
shut your window and pray beneath your breath: Ye make too great a d^^ with
your prayers, so would a head-of-wit speak, if ye were in Daniel's place: But
men's overguilded reasons will not help you when your conscience is like to rive
with a double charge. Alas, alas, when will this world learn to submit their
wisdom to the wisdom of God. I am sure your Lo: has found the truth; go not
then to search it over again; for it is ordinary for men to make doubts, when
they have a mind to desert the truth. Kings are not their own men, their ways
are in God's hand. I rejoice and am glad that ye resolve to walk with Christ,
howbeit his court be thin. Grace be with your Lo:

Aberd. Sept. 7. 1637. Your Lo: in his sweet Master and Lord Jesus, S. R.

To WILLIAM RIGGE. of Atherny. (68)
Worthy and much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: How sad a prisoner would I be, if I knew not
that my Lord Jesus had the keys of the prison himself, and that his death and
blood has bought a blessing to our crosses as well as to our selves. I am sure,
troubles have no prevailing right over us, if they be but our Lord's Sergeants
to keep us in ward while we are in this side of heaven: I am persuaded also,
that they shall not go over the bound-road, nor enter in to heaven with us;
for they find no welcome there, where there is no more death, neither sorrow
nor crying, neither any more pain: and therefore we shall leave them behind
us. Oh if I could get as good a gate of sin, even this woeful and wretched body
of sin, as I get of Christ's cross! Nay indeed I think the cross beared b^th me
and it self, rather then I it, in comparison of the tyranny of the lawless
flesh and wicked nighbour that dwells beside Christ's new creature: But Oh,
this is that which presses me down, and pai^eth me: Jesus Christ in his saints
sits neighbor with an ill second, corruption, deadness, coldness, pride,
lust, worldliness, self-love, security, falsehood, and a world of ^o^ the like,
which I find in me, that are daily doing violence to the new man. O but we
have cause to carry low sails, and to cleave fast to free grace, free, free
grace! Blessed be our Lord that ever that way was found out: If my one foot
were in heaven and my soul half in, if free will and corruption were absolute
Lords of me, I should never win wholly in. O but the sweet, new and living way
that Christ has stroke up to our home, be a safe way! I find now presence and
acc^ss a greater dainty then before, but yet the bridegroom looks through the
lattes and through the hole of the door. O if he and I were in fair dry land
together in the other side of the water. Grace be with you.

Aberd. Sept. 30. 1637 Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S R.

To the Lady KILCONQUHAIR. (69)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter: I am heartily
content ye love and own this opp^essed and wronged cause of Christ, and that
now when so many are miscarried, ye are in any measure taken with the love of
Jesus: weary not, but come in and see if there be not more in Christ then the
tongue of men and Angels can express: If ye seek a gate to heaven, the way is
in him, or, he is it: What ye want is treasured up in Jesus, and he says, all
his are yours, even his Kingdom, he is content to divide it betwixt him and
you, yea his throne and his glory, Luke 21. 29. Ioh. 17. 24. Rov. 3. 21. and
Therefore take pains to climb up to that bes^eged house to Christ: for devils,
men and armies of temptations are lying about the house to hold out all that
are out; and it is taken with violence: It is not a smooth and easy way,
neit^er will your weather be fair and pleasant; but whosoever saw the invisible
God and the fair city, make no reckoning of loss^s or crosses: in ye must be,
cost you what it will; stand not for a price and for all that ye have, to win
the castle; the rights to it are won to you, and it is disponed to you in your
Lord Jesus's testament, and see what a fair legacy your dying friend Christ
has left you: And there wants nothing but possession. Then get up in the
strength of the Lord; get over the water to poss^ss that good land: It is
better then a land of olives and wine-trees, for the tree of life that bears
twelve manner of fruits every month is there before you, and a pure river of
life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb, is
there. Your time is short, therefore lose no time: Gracious and faithful is he
who has called you to his Kingdom and glory. The city is yours by free
conquest and by promise, and therefore let no uncouth Lord-idol put you from
your own. The devil has cheated the simple heir of his Paradise, and by
enticing us to taste of the forbidden fruit, has, as it were, bought us out of
our kindly heritage: But our Lord, Christ Jesus, has done more then bought the
devil by, for he has redeemed the wodset and made the poor heir free to the
inheritance. If we knew the glory of our elder brother in heaven, we would long
to be there to see him, and to get our fill of heaven: We children think the
earth a fair garden, but it is but God's out-field and wild, cold, barren
ground: All things are fading that are here: It is our happiness to make sure
Christ to our selves. Thus remembering my love to your husband and wi^king to
him what I write to you, I commit you to God's tender mercy.

Aberd. Sepr. 13. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To the Lady CRAIGHALL. (70)
Honorable and Christian Lady.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I cannot but write to your La: of the sweet
and glorious terms I am in with the most joyful King that ever was, under this
well thrifing and prosperous cross: it is my Lord's salvation wrought by his
own right hand, that the water does not suffocat the breath of ^^pe and
joyful courage in the Lo^d Jesus: For his own person is still in the camp with
his poor soldier. I see, the cross is tied with Christ's hand to the end of an
honest profession: We are but fools to endeavor to loose Christ's knot. When I
consider the comforts of God, I durst not consent to sell or wod-set my short
life-rent of the cross of the Lord Jesus. I know that Christ bought with his
own blood a right to sanctified and blessed crosses, in as far, as they blow me
over the water to my long desired home: and it were not good that Christ should
be the buyer and I the seller. I know time and death shall take sufferings
fairly off my hand: I hope we shall have an honest parting at night, when this
piece cold and frosty afternoon-tide of my evil and rough day, shall be over:
Well is my soul of either sweet or sour that Christ has any part or portion
in: if he be at the one end of it, it hall be well with me. I shall die ere I
libell faults against Christ's cross; it hall have my testimonial under my
hand, as an honest and saving mean of Christ for mortification and faith's
growth. I have a stronger assurance since I came over Forth, of the excellency
of Jesus then I had before. I am rather about him then in him, while I am
absent from him in this house of clay: But I would be in heaven for no other
cause, but to essay and try, what boundies joy it must be, to be over head and
ears in my welbeloved Christ's love. O that fair one has my heart for
evermore! but alas, it is over little for him! O if it were better and more
worthy for his sake! O if I might meet with him face to face in this side of
eternity, and might have leave to plead with him that I am so hungered and
famished here, with the niggardly portion of his love that he gives me! O that
I might be carver and steward my sel^ at mine own will of Christ's love! [if I
may lawfully wish this] then would I enlarge my vessel [alas, a narrow and ebb
soul] and take in a sea of i* love. My hunger for it is hungry and lean in
believing that ever I shall be satisfied with that love, so fain would I have,
what I know I cannot hold. O Lord Jesus, delightest thou, delightest thou to
pine and torment poor souls with the want of thy incomparable loved. O if I
durst call thy dispensation cruel! I know thou thy selfa^t mercy without
either brim or bottom; I know tho^ art a God bankfull of mercy and love, but Oh
alas, little of it comes my way: I die to look a far off to that love, because
I can get but little of it: But hope says, this providence shall ere long look
more favorably upon poor bodies, and me also. Grace be with your La: Spirit.

To Mr JAMES HAMILTON. (71)
Reverend and dear Brother.
PEace be to you from God our father and from our Lord Jesus: I am laid low
when I remember what I am, and that my outside casts such a luster when I
find so little within. It is a wonder that Christ's glory is not defiled in
running through such an unclean and impure channel: But I see Christ will be
Christ in the dreg and refuse of men: his art, his shining wisdom, his beauty
speaks loudest in blackness, weakness, deadness, yea in nothing. I see,
nothing, no money, no worth no good, no life, no deserving is the ground that
omnipotency delights to draw glory out of. O how sweet is the inner side of
the walls of Christ's house, and a room beside himself! my distance from him
makes me sad. O that we were in others arms! O that the middle things betwixt
us were removed! I find it a difficult matter to keep all stots with Christ:
when he laugheth I scarce believe it, I would so fain have it true. But I am
like a low man looking up to a high mountain, whom weariness and fainting
overcomes. I would climb up, but I find that I do not advance in my journey
as I would wish: Yet I trust he shall take me home against night. I marvel not
that Antichrist in his slaves is so busy, but our crowned King sees and
beholds, and will arise for Zion's safety. I am exceedingly distracted with
letters and company that vilite me; what I can do, or time will permit, I
shall not omit: Excuse my brevity, for I am straightened. Remember the Lord's
prisoner: I desire to be mindful of you. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. Sept. 7. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To Mr GEORGE DUMBAR. (72)
Reverend and Dearly beloved in the Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Because your words have strengthened many, I
was silent expecting some lines from you in my bonds, and this is the cause why
I wrote not to you: but now I am forced to break off and speak. I never
believed till now, that there was so much to be found in Christ in this side of
death and of heaven. O the ravishments of heavenly joy that may be had here, in
the small gleanings of comforts that fall from Christ! what fools are we who
know not and consider not the weight and the telling that is in the very
earnest-penny and the first fruits of our hoped for harvest! How sweet, how
sweet is our infeftment? O what then must personal possession be? I find that
my Lord Jesus has not miscooked or spilt this sweet cross, he has an eye on
the fire and the melting gold, to separate the metal and the dross. O how
much time would it take me, to read my obligations to Jesus my Lord, who will
neither have the faith of his own to be burnt to ashes; nor yet will have a
poor believer in the fire to be half raw, like Ephraim's unturned cake^ this is
the wisdom of him who has his fi^el^ Zion and his fur^ace in Jerusa^em. I need
not either bud or flatter temptations, cr^sses, nor strive to buy the Devil or
this malicious world by, or r^deem their kindness with half a han-breadth of
truth: He who is sur^ty for his servant for good does power fully overruled
all that. I s^e my prison has neither lock nor door; I am free in my bonds,
and my chains are made of rotten straw, they shall not bide one pull of faith.
I am sure they are in hell who would exchange their torments with our crosses,
suppose they should nev^r be delivered, and give twenty thousand years torment
to boot, to be in our bonds for ever: and therefore we wrong Christ who si^h
and fear and doubt and despond in them. Our suff^^ings are washen in Christ's
blood as well as our souls; for Christ's merits bought a blessing to the
crosses of the sons of God; and Jesus has a backbond of all our temptations,
that the free warders shall come out by law and justice, in respect of the
infinite and great sum that the Redeemer paid. Our troubles ow us a free
passage through them: devils and men and crosses are our debtors, and death and
all storms are our debtors, to blow our poor tossed bark over the water
fraught-fr^e, and to set the travelers in their own known ground: Therefore we
shall die and yet live: we are over the water [some way] already; we are
married, and our tocher-good is paid; we are already more then conquerours: If
the devil and the world knew how the court with our Lord shall go, I am sure
they would hire death to take us off their hand; our sufferings are the only
w^ack and ruin of the black Kingdom: and yet a little and the Antichrist must
play himself with the bones and slain bodies of the Lamb's followers; but
withal we stand with the hundred forty and four thousand who are with the
Lamb upon the top of ^ount Sion: Antichrist and his followers are down in the
valley ground, we have the advantage of the hill: our temptation are always
beneath, our waters are beneath our breath; as dying and behold we live: I
never heard before of a living death, or a quick death, but ours: our death i^
not like the common death; Christ's skill, his handy work and a new cast of
Christ's admirable art may be seen in our quick death. I bless the Lord that
all our troubles come through Christ's singers, and that he casts sugar among
them, and casts in, some ounce weights of heaven and of the spirit of glory
[that rests on suffering beleevers] in our cup in which there is no taste of
hell. My dear Brother, ye know all these better then I: I send water to the
sea, to speak of these things to you: But it eases me to desire you to help me
to pay tribute of praise to Jesus. O what praises I ow him! I would I were in
my free heritage, that I might begin to pay my debts to Jesus. I entreat for
your prayers and praises: I forget not you.

Aberd. Sept. 17. 1637 Your brother and fellow sufferer in and for Christ. S. R.

To Mr DAVID DICKSON. (73)
Reverend and welbeloved brother in the Lord.
I Bless the Lord who has so wonderfully stopped the on-going of that lawless
process against you. The Lord reigns, and has a saving eye upon you and your
ministry, and therefore fear not what men can do. I bless the Lord that the
Irish ministers find employment, and the professors comfort of their
ministry: Believe me, I durst not, as I am now disposed, hold an honest
brother out of the pulpit: I trust, the Lord shall guard you and hide you in
the shadow of his hand: I am not pleased with any that are against you in that.
I see this, in prosperity men's conscience will not start at small sins: But if
some had been where I have been since I came from you, a little more would have
caused their eye water and troubled their peace. O how ready are we to incline
to the world's-hand? Our arguments being well examined are often drawn from our
skin: the whole skin and a peaceable tabernacle is a topic maxim in great
request in our Logic. I find a little breirding of God's seed in this town,
for the which the Doctors have told me their mind, that they cannot bear with
it, and have examined and threatened the people that haunt my company: I fear I
get not leave to winter here, and whether I go, I know not; I am ready at the
Lord's call. I would I could make acquaintance with Christ's cross, for I
find, comforts lie to, and follow upon the cross. I suffer in my name by them:
I take it as a part of the crucifying of the old man: Let them cut the throat
of my credit and do as they like best with it, when the wind of their
calumnies has blown away my good name from me in the way to heaven, I know
Christ will take my name out of the mire and wash it and restore it to me
again. I would have a mind (if the Lord would be pleased to give me it] to be
a fool for Christ's sake. Sometimes while I have Christ in my arms, I fall
asleep with the sweetness of his presence, and he in my sleep steals away out
of my arms, and when I awake I mis^ him. I am much comforted with my Lady
Pi^sligo, a good woman and acquainted with God's ways. Grace be with you.

Right honorable.
GRace mercy and peace be to your Lo: I rejoice exceedingly that I hear your
Lo: has a good mind to Christ and his now-born-down truth. My very dear Lord,
go on in the strength of the Lord to carry your honor and worldly glory to
the new Jerusalem: For this cause your Lo: received these of the Lord: this is
a sure way for the establishment of your house if ye be of these who are
willing in your place to build Zion's old waste places in Scotland. Your Lo:
wants not God's and man's law both, now to come to the streets for Christ:
and suppose the bastard laws of man were against you, it is an honest and
zealous error, if here ye slip against a point or punctilio of standing
policy: when your foot slippeth in such known ground as is the royal
prerogative of our high and most truly dread ^overaign [who has many crowns on
his head] and the liberties of his house, he will hold you up. Blessed shall
they be who take Babel's little ones and dash their heads against stones: I
wish your Lo: have a share of that blessing with other worthy Nobles in our
land. It is true, it is now accounted wisdom for men to be partners in pullin
up the stakes and loo^ng the cords of the tent of Christ: but I am peswaded,
that that wisdom is cried down in heaven, and shall never pass for true wisdom
it^ the Lord, whose word cries shame upon wit against Christ and truth: and
accordingly it shall prove shame and confusion of face in the end. Our Lord
has given your Lo: (...) of a better stamp, and learning also wherein year
not behind th disputer and the s^^be. O what a blessed thing i^ it to see
No^ility, Learning and Sanctification, all co curre in one! For these ye ow
your sell to Christ and his ^ingdom: God has be-wildered and b^-misted the wit
and the learning of the scribes and disputer of this time; they look asquint to
the Bible: This blinding and be-^ing world blindfoldeth men's light, that they
are afraid to se straight out before them, nay their very light plays the
knave, or wo^s, to truth. Your Lo: knows, within a little while, Policy
against trut^ will blu^h, and the works of men shall burn, even their
spider-w^b, who spin out many hundred else and webs of indifferency in the
Lord's worship, more then ever ^oses, who would have an^oof m^^t rial; and
Daniel, who would have a look out at a wi^dow a matter of life and death, then
ever [I say] these men of God dreamed of. Alas, that men dare shape, carve, cut
and clippe our King's princ^ly Testament in length and breadth and in all
dimensions answerable to the conceptions of such policy as a h ad-of-wit
thinks a safe and trim way of serving God. How have men forgotten the Lord,
that they dare go against even that truth which once they preached themselves,
howbeit their sermons now be as thin sown as strav-berri^s in a wood or
wilderness. Certainly the s^eetest and safest course is, for this short time of
the afternoon of this ol^ and declining world, to stand for Jesus: he has said
it and it is our part to believe it, that ere is be long Time shall be no more,
and the heaven shall wax old as a garment: (...) Do we not see it already an
old hollie and threed-bare garment? does not or ple and la^e ature t^^l us,
that the Lord will fold up the old garment, (...) and lay it aside, and that
the heavens shall be folded together as a scroll and this pesthouse shall be
burnt with fire, and that both plenishing and walls shall melt with fervent
heat? for at the Lord's coming he will do with this earth as men do with a
leper house, he will burn the walls with fire and the plenishing of the house
also, 2 Pet. 3, 10, 11, 12. My very Daer Lord, how shall ye rejoice in that day
to have Christ, Angels, heaven, and your own conscience to smile upon you. I am
persuaded one sick night through the terrors of the Almighty, would make men
[whose conscience has such a wide throat as an image like a Chathedral Church
would go down it] have other thoughts of Christ and his worship then now they
please themselves with. The scarcity of faith in the earth says, We are hard
upon the last nick of time: Blessed are these who keep their garments clean
against the bridegroom's coming: There shall be spotted clothes and many
defiled garments at his last coming; and therefore few found worthy to walk
with him in white. I am persuaded, my Lord, this poor traveling woman, our
pained Church, is with child of victory and shall bring forth a man-child
that shall be caught up to God and his throne, howbeit the Dragon [in his
followers] be attending the childe-birth-pain, as an Egyptian midwife, to
receive the birth and strangle it: Isa. 29: 8. But they shall be disappointed
who thirst for the destruction of Zion, they shall be as when a hungry man
dreameth that he eats but behold he awaketh and his soul is empty, or when a
thirsty man dreameth, that he drinks but behold he awaketh and is faint and
his soul is not satisfied: so shall it be, I say, with the multitude of all the
nations that fight against mount Zion. Therefore the weak, and feeble, these
that are as signs and wonders in Israel, have chosen the best side, even the
side that victory is upon; and I think, this is no evil policy. Verily for my
self, I am so well pleased with Christ and his noble and honest-born cross,
this cross that is come of Christ's house, and is of kin to himself, that I
should weep if it should come to niffering and bar^^ring of lots and condition
with these that are at ease in Zion: I hold still my choice and bless my self
in it. I see, and I believe there is salvation in this way that is every where
spoken against: I hope to go to eternity and to venture upon the last evil to
the saints, even upon death, fully persuaded that this only, even this, is,
the saving way for rackel consciences and for weary and laden sinners to find
ease and peace for evermore into: and indeed it is not for any worldly respect
that I speak so of it: the weather is not so hot that I have great cause to
startle in my prison, or to boast of that ^ntertainment that my good friends
the Prelates, intend for me, which is banishment, if they shall obtain their
desire and effectu at what they design; but let it come, I rue not that I made
Christ my wail and my choice; I think him ay the longer the better. My Lord,
It shall be good service to God to hold your noble friend and Chief upon a good
course for the truth of Christ. Now the very God of peace establish your Lo: in
Christ Jesus unto the end.

Aberd. Sept, 10. 1637. Your Lo: in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To the Lord of GAITGIRTH. (76)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I can do no more but thank you in paper,
and remember you to him whom I serve, for your kindness and care of a prisoner.
I ble^s the Lord, the cause I suffer for needs not to blu^h before Kings:
Christ's white, honest and fair truth needs neither wax pale for fear, nor
blush for shame. I bless the Lord who has graced you to own Christ now, when
so many are afraid to profess him, and hide him for fear they suffer loss by
avouching him. Alas that so many in these days are carried with the times: As
if their conscience rolled upon oyled wheels so do they go any way the wind
blows them, and because Christ is not market-sweet, men put him away from
them. Worthy and much honored Sir, go on to own Christ and his oppressed
truth: The end of sufferings for the Gospel is rest and gladness: light and joy
is sown for the mourners in Zion and the harvest [which is of God's making for
time and manner] is near: Crosses have right and claim to Christ in hs members,
till legs and arms and whole mystical-Christ be in heaven: There will be rain
and hail and storm^^n the saints clouds, ever till God cleanse with fire the
works of creation, and till he burn the botch-house of heaven and earth that
men's sin has subjected unto vanity. They are blessed who suffer and sin not,
for suffering is the badge that Christ has put upon his followers. Take what
way we can to heaven, the way is hedged up with crosses, there is no way, but
to break through them; wit and wiles, shifts and laws will not find out a way
about the cross of Christ but we must through, one thing by experience my Lord
has taught me, that the waters betwixt this and heaven may all be ridden if ^e
be well horsed, I mean if we be in Christ, and not one shall drown by the way
but such as love their own destruction. Oh if we could wait on for a time and
believe in the dark the salvation of God! At least we are to believe good of
Christ till he give us the slip [which is impossible] and to take his word for
caution that he shall fill up all the blanks in his promises and give us what
we want: but to the unbeleever Christ's Testament is white, blank, unwritten
paper, worthy and dear Sir, set your face to heaven and make you to stoop at
all the low entries in the way: that ye may receive the Kingdom as a child:
without this, he that knew the way said, there is no entry in. O but Christ be
willing to lead a poor sinner! O what love my poor soul has found in him in
the house of my pilgrimage! Suppose love in heaven and earth were lost, I dare
swear it may be found in Christ. Now the very God of peace establish you till
the day of the glorious appearance of Christ.

Aberd. Sept. 7. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To the Lady GAITGIRTH. (77)
Much honored and Christian Lady.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear how it goes with you and
your children: I exhort you not to lose breath nor to faint in your journey:
The way is not so long to your home as it was, it will wear to one step or an
inch at length, and ye shall come ere long to be within your armlength of the
glorious crown. Your Lord Jesus did sweat and pant ere he got up that mount, he
was at father save me with it, it was he who, Psalm. 22: 14. said. I am poured
out like water; all my bones are out of joint [Christ wa^ as if they had broken
him upon the wheel] my heart is like wax, it is melted in the midst of my
bowels v. 15. My strength is dried up like a po^sheard: I am sure ye love the
way the better that his holy feet trod it before you: Crosses have a smell of
crossed and pained Christ. I believe your Lord will not leave you to die your
alone in the way. I know ye have sad hours when the comforter is hid under a
vail and when ye inquire for him, and find but a toom nest: This I grant is
but a cold good-day when the seeker misseth him whom the soul loves; but even
his unkindness is kind, his absence lovely, his mask a sweet fight, till God
send Christ himself in his own sweet presence: make his sweet comforts your
own, and be not strange and shame fast with Christ: homely dealing is best for
him, it is his liking. When your winter storms are over, the summer of your
Lord shall come: Your sadness is with child of joy, he will do you good in
the latter end. Take no heavier lift of your children then your Lord allows,
give them room beside your heart, but not in the yolk of your heart, where
Christ should be; for then they are your idols, not your bairns: if your Lord
take any of them home to his house before the storm come on, take it well, the
owner of the orchard may take down two or thr^ ^pples off his own trees before
midsummer and ere they get the harvest sun, and it would not be seemly that his
servant, the gardener, should chide him for it: Let our Lord pluck his own
fruit at any season he pleases; they are not lost to you, they are laid up so
well as that they are coffered in heaven where our Lord's best jewely lie: They
are all free goods that are there, death can have no law to arrest any thing
that is within the walls of the new Jerusalem. All the saints, because of sin,
are like old rusty horologies that must be taken down, and the wheels scoured
and mended, and set up again in better case then before: Sin has rusted both
soul and body: our dear Lord by death takes us down to scour the wheels of
both, and to purge us perfectly from the root and remainder of sin, and we
shall be set up in better case then before. Then pluck up your heart, heaven is
yours, and that is a word few can say. Now the great Shepherd of the sheep and
the very God of peace confirm and establish you to the day of the appearance of
Christ our Lord.

To his revend and very dear brother Mr GEORGE GILLESPIE. [78]
My very Dear Brother.
I Received yours: I am still with the Lord, his cross has done that which I
thought impossible once: Christ keeps tryst in the fire and water with his
own, and comes ere our breath go out and ere our blood grow cold. Blessed are
they whose feet escape the great golden net that is now spread: it is our
happiness to take the crabbed, rough and poor side of Christ's world, which is
a lease of crosses and losses for him; for Christ's in comes and casualities
that follow him are many: and it is not a little one, that a good conscience
may be had in following him this is true gain and most to be labored for and
loved. Many give Christ for a shadow, because Christ was rather beside their
con^cience in a dead and reprobate light, then in their conscience. Let us be
ballasted with grace, that we be not blown over and that we staggar not. Yet a
little while and Christ and his redeemed ones shall fill the field and come out
victorious: Christ's glory of triumphing in Scotland is yet in the bud and in
the birth, but the birth cannot prove an abortive: He shall not faint nor be
discouraged till he have brought forth judgment unto victory. Let us still
mind our Covenant: and the very God of peace be with you.

Aberd. 9. Sept. 1637. Your Brother in Christ. S. R.

To Mr MATTHEW MOWAT. (79)
Reverend and Dear Brother.
I Am refreshed with your letters: I would take all well at my Lord's hands
that he has done, If I knew I could do my Lord any service in my suffering:
suppose my Lord would make a stop-hole of me to fill a hole in the wall of his
house, or a pinning in Zion's new work: For any place of trust in my Lord's
house, as steward or chamberlain, or the like: surely I think my self [my very
dear brother, I speak not by any proud figure or trope] unworthy of it; nay I
am not worthy to stand behind the door: if my head and feet and body were half
out, half in, in Christ's house, so I saw the fair face of the Lord of the
house, it would still my grieuing and lovesick desires. When I hear that the
men of God are at work and speaking in our Lord Jesus his name, I think my self
but an outcast or outlaw chased from the City to lie on the hills and live
amongst the rocks and out-fields. O that I might but stand in Christ's
out-house, or hold a candle in any low vault of his house! But I know this is
but the vapors that arise out of a quarrellous and unbeleeving heart, to
darken the wisdom of God. And your fault is just mine, that I cannot believe my
Lord's bare and naked word: I must either have an apple to play me with and
shake hands with Christ, and have seal, caution, and witness to his word, or
else I count my self loose; how beit I have the word and faith of a King. Oh, I
am made of unbelief and cannot swim but where my feet may touch the ground!
Alas, Christ under my temptations is presented to me as lying-waters, as a
dyvour and a cousener! We can make such a Christ as temptations [casting us in
a night-dream] does feign and devise [and tempeations represent Christ ever
unlike himself] and we in our folly listen to the tempter. If I could minister
one saving word to any, how glad would my soul be: But I my self [which is my
greatest evil] often mistake the cross of Christ: For I know if we had wit and
knew well that ease slays us fools, we would desire a market where we might
barter or niffer our lazy ease with a profitable cross; howbeit there be an
outcast natural betwixt our desires and tribulation: But some give a dear
price and gold for physic which they love not and buy sickness, howbeit they
wish rather to have been whole then to be sick. But surely. Brother, ye shall
not have my advice [howbeit alas I cannot follow it my self] to contend with
the honest and faithful Lord of the house; for go he or come he, he is ay
gracious in his departure: There are grace and mercy and loving kindness upon
Christ's back-parts: and When he goes away, the proportion of his face, the
image of that fair sun that staveth in eyes, senses and heart after he is gone,
leaves a mass of love behind it in the heart. The sound of his knock at the
door of his beloved after he is gone and past, leaves (...) share of joy and
sorrow both: So we have something to feed upon till he return, and he is more
loved in his departure, and after he is gone then before, as the day in the
declining of the sun and toward's the evening is often most desired. And as for
Christ's cross I never received evil of it, but what was of mine own making:
when I miscooked Christ's physic, no marvel that it hurt me: For since it was
on Christ's back it has always a sweet smell and these 1600 Years it keeps
the smell of Christ; nay it is elder then that too, for it is a long time since
Abel first hansel'd the cross and had it laid upon his shoulders and down from
him all along to this very day all the saints have known what it is. I am
glad that Christ has such a relation to this cross, and that it is called the
cross of our Lord Jesus, Gal. 6: v. 14. His reproaches, Heb. 13: 13. As if
Christ would claim it as his proper goods, and so it comes in the reckoning
among Christ's own property: If it were simple evil, as sin is, Christ, who is
not the author nor owner of sin, would not own it. I wonder at the enemies of
Christ [in whom malice has run away with wit, and will is up and wit down]
that they would essay to lift up the stone laid in Zion: surely it is not laid
in such sinking ground as that they can raise it or remove it; for when we are
in their belly and they have swallowed us down, they will be sick and spue us
out again. I know Zion and her Husband cannot both sleep at once: I believe our
Lord once again shall water with his dew the withered hill of mount Zion in
Scotland and come down and make a new marriage again, as he did long since.
Remember our Covenant: Your excuse for your advice to me is needless: Alas,
many sit beside light as sick folks beside meat and cannot make use of it.
Grace be with you.

Aberd. Sept. 7. 1637. Your brother in Christ, S. R.

To Mr JOHN MEINE. (80)
Dear Brother.
I Received your letter: I cannot but testify under mine own hand, that Christ
is still the longer the better, and that this time is the time of loves. When I
have said all I can, others may begin and say, I have said nothing of him. I
never knew Christ to ebb or flow, wax or wane: his winds turn not when he
seems to change, it is but we who turn our wrong side to him. I never had a
plea with him in my hardest conflicts but of mine own making. Oh that I could
live in peace and good neighborhood with such a second, and let him alone! My
unbelief made many black lies, but my recantation to Christ is not worth the
hearing. Surely he has born with strange gades in me: He knows my heart has
not natural wit to keep quarters with such a Savior. Ye do well to fear your
own backsliding: I had stood sure, if I had in my youth borrowed Christ to be
my bottom: But he that bears his own weight to heaven, shall not fail to slip
and sink. Ye had no need to be barefooted among the thorns of this apostat
generation, lest a stob strike up in your foot and cause you to halt all your
days: And think not, Christ will do with you in the matter of suffering as
the Pope does in the matter of sin: Ye shall not find that Christ will sell a
Dispensation or give a Dyvour's Protection against crosses: Crosses are
proclaimed as common Accidents to all the saints, and in them stands a part
of our communion with Christ: But there lies a sweet casuality to the cross;
even Christ's presence and his comforts when they are sanctified. Remember my
love to your father and mother. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 7. Sept. 1637 Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To JOHN FLEEMING. Bailiffe of Leith. (81)
Much honored in the Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am still in good terms with Christ,
however my Lord's wind blow, I have the advantage of the calm and sunny side of
Christ. Devils, and hell, and Devil's servants, are all blown blind in
pursuing the Lord's little Bride: They shall be as a night-dream who fight
against mount Zion. Worthy Sir, I hope ye take to heart the worth of your
calling: This great fair and meeting of people will skaile, and the port is
open for us: As fast as time wears out, we flee away: Eternity is at our
elbow. O how blessed are they who in time make Christ sure for themselves;
Salvation is a great errand; I find it hard to fetch heaven. Oh that we could
take pains on our lamps for the Bridegroom's coming! the other side of this
world will be turned up incontinent, and up shall down, and these that are
weeping in sackcloth shall triumph on white horses, with him whose name is The
word of God. These dying idols, the fair: creatures that we whorishly love
better then our Creator, will pass away like snow water. The Godhead, the
Godhead, a communion with God in Christ, to be halvers with Christ of the
purchased house and inheritance in heaven, should be your scope and aim. For
my self, when I lay my counts, O what telling, O what weighing is in Christ! O
how soft are his kisses! O love, love surpassing in Jesus! I have no fault to
that love, but that it seems to deal niggardly with me: I have little of it.
O that I had Christ's seen and read band, subscribed by himself, for my fill of
it! What garland have I, or what crown, if I looked right on things, but Jesus?
Oh there is no room in us on this side of the water for that love! This narrow
bit earth and these ebb and narrow souls can hold little of it because we are
full of rifts. I would glory, glory would enlarge us [as it will] and make us
tight, and close up our seams and rifts, that we might be able to comprehend
it, which yet is incomprehensible. Remember my love to your wife. Grace be with
you.

Aberd. Sept. 7. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To ALEXANDER GORDON Of Earlestoun. [82.)
Much honored Sir.
HOwbeit I would have been glad to have seen you; yet seeing our Lord has been
pleased to break the snare of your adversaries, I heartily bless our Lord on
your behalf. Our crosses for Christ are not made of iron, they are softer and
of more gentle metal: It is easy for God, to make a fool of the Devil the
father of all fools. As for me, I but breath out what my Lord breaths in: The
scum and froth of my letters, I father upon my own unbeleeving heart. I know
your Lord has something to do with you, because Satan and malice have shot
sore at you; but your bow abides in it is strength. Ye shall not by my advice
be a halver with Christ, to divide the glory of your deliverance betwixt your
self and him; or any other second mean whatsoever: Let Christ [as it sets
him well] have all the glory, and triumph his alone. The Lord set himself on
high in you: I see Christ can borrow a cross for some hours, and set his
servants beside it, rather then under it, and win the plea too, yea and make
glory to himself and shame to his enemies and comfort to his children out of
it: But whether Christ buy or borrow crosses, he is King of crosses, and King
of Devils, and King over hell, and King over malice: When he was in the grave,
he came out, and brought the keys with him: he is Lord-Jaylor, nay what say I,
he is Captain of the castle, and he has the keys of deaths hell; and what are
our troubles but little deaths: and he who commands the great castle
commands the little also. 2. I see, a hardened face and two skins upon our
brows, against the winter hail, and stormy wind, is meetest for a poor
traveller in a winter journey to heaven. O what art is it to learn to endure
hardness and to learn to go bare footed either through the devil's fiery coals
or his frozen waters! 3. I am persuaded a sea-venture with Christ makes great
riches: Is not our King Jesus his ship coming home, and shall not we get part
of the gold? Alas, we fools miscount our gain when we seem losers. Believe me,
I have no challenges against this well-born cross, for it is come of Christ's
house and is honorable and his propine, To you it is given to suffer. O what
fools are we to undervalue his gifts, and to lightly that which is true
honor! For if we could be faithful, our tackling shall not loose, nor our
mast break, nor our sails blow into the sea. The bastard crosses, the kinless
and base-born crosses of worldlings for evil doing, must be heavy and
grievous; but our afflictions are light and momentany. 4. I think my self happy
that I have lost credit with Christ, and that in this bargain I am Christ's
sworn dyvour, to whom he will lippen nothing, no not one pin in the work of my
salvation: Let me stand in black and white in the Dyvourbook be ore Christ, I
am happy that my salvation is concredited to Christ's mediation: Christ owes
no faith to me, to lippen any thing to me; but O what faith and credit I ow to
him! Let my name fall and let Christ's name stand in honor with man and angel.
Alas, I have no room to spread out my affection before God's people, and I see
not how I can shout out and cry out the loveliness, the high honor and the
glory of my fairest Lord Jesus. Oh that he would let me have a bed to lie in,
to be delivered of my birth, that I might paint him out in his beauty to men as
I dow. 5. I wondered once at providence and called white providence black and
unjust, that I should be smothered in a town where no soul will take Christ off
my hand: But providence has another luster with God, then with my bliered
eyes. I proclaim my self a blind body who know not black and white in the
uncouth course of God's providence. Suppose Christ would set hell where heaven
is and devils up in glory beside the elect Angels [which yet cannot be] I would
I had a heart to acquiesce in his way without further dispute. I see, infinite
wisdom is the mother of his judgments and his ways pass finding out. 6. I
cannot learn, but I desire to learn to bring my thoughts, will, and lusts, in
under Christ's feet, that he may trample upon them: But alas, I am still upon
Christ's wrong side. Grace be with you.

Aberd. Sept. 12. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus: S. R.

To ROBERT LENNOX. Of Disdove. [83]
Worthy and dear Brother.
I Forget you not in my bonds: I know ye are looking to Christ, and I beseech
you, follow your look. I can say more of Christ now by experience [though he be
infinitely above and beyond all that can be said of him] then when I saw you. I
am drowned over head and ears in his love. Sell, sell, sell all things for
Christ. If this whole world were the balk of a balance, it should not be able
to bear the weight of Christ's love; man and angels have short arms to fathom
it: Set your feet upon this piece blew and base clay of an over-guilded and
fair plaistered world; an hours kissing of Christ is worth a world of worlds.
Sir, make sure work or your salvation, build not upon sand, lay the foundation
upon the rock in Zion: strive to be dead to this world and to your will and
lusts: Let Christ have a commanding power and a King throne in you: Walk with
Christ, howbeit the wind should take the hide off your face: I promise you
Christ will win the field: Your pastors cause you to err; except you see
Christ's word, go not one foot with them: Countenance not the reading of that
Romish Service Book: Keep your garments clean, as ye would walk with the Lamb
clothed in white. The wrongs I suffer are upon record in heaven: our great
Master and Judge will be upon us all, and bring us before the sun in our
black's and white's: Blessed are they who watch and keep themselves in God's
love. Learn to discern the Bridegroom's tongue, and to give your self to prayer
and reading. Ye was often a hearer of me: I would put my heart blood upon the
doctrine I taught, as the only way to salvation: go not from it, my dear
Brother. What I write to your self, I write to your wife also. Mind heaven and
Christ, and keep the spunk of the love of Christ you have gotten; Christ shall
blow on it, if ye entertain it, and your end shall be peace. There is a fire in
our Zion; but our Lord is but seeking a new Bride refined and purified out of
the furnace. I assure you, howbeit we be nicknamed Puritans, all the powers of
the world shall not prevail against us: Remember, though a sinful man write it
to you, these people shall yet be in Scotland as a green olive tree and a field
blessed of the Lord, and it shall be proclaimed, up, up with Christ, and down,
down with all contrary powers. Sir, pray for me, [I name you to the Lord] for
further evil is determined against me. Remember my love to Christian Murray and
her daughter: I desire her in the edge of her evening to wait a little, the
King is coming, and he has something, that she never saw, with him: heaven is
no dream: Come and see will teach her best. Grace, grace be with you.

To MARION McKNAUGHT: [84]
Dearest in our Lord Jesus.
COunt it your honor that Christ has begun at you to fine you first: Fear
not, says the Amen, the true and faithful witness: I write to you, as my
Master lives, upon the word of my royal King, continue in prayer and in
watching, and your glorious deliverance is coming: Christ is not far off, a
fig, a straw for all the bits of clay that are risen against us: Ye shall
thresh the mountains and fan then like chaff, Isa. 41. If ye slack your hands
at your meetings and your watching to prayer, then it would seem our rock has
sold us; but be dililigent and be not discouraged. I charge you in Christ
rejoice, give thanks, believe, be strong in the Lord: That burning bush in
Galloway and Kirk^dbright shall not be burnt to ashes; for the Lord is in the
bush. Be not discouraged that banishment is to be procured by the King's
warrant to the Council, against me: the earth is my Lord's; I am filled with
his sweet love; and running over: I rejoice to hear ye are in your journey:
such news as I hear of all your faith and love, rejoice my sad heart. Pray for
me, for they seek my hurt, but I give my self to prayer. The blessing of my
Lord and a prisoner of Christ's blessing be with you. O chosen and greatly
beloved woman, faint not: Fie, fie, if ye faint now: Ye lose a good cause: double
your meetings; cease not for Zion's sake, and hold not your peace till he make
Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in Christ Jesus his Lord. S. R.

To THOMAS CORBET. [85]
Dear friend.
I Forget you not: It shall be my joy that ye follovv after Christ till ye
find him: My conscience is a feast of joy to me, that I sought in singleness
of heart, for Christ's love, to put you upon the King's high-vvay to our
Bridegroom and our father's house: Thrice blessed are ye, my dear Brother, if
ye hold the way: I believe, ye and Christ once met, I hope ye will not sunder
with him: Follovv the counsel of the man of God Mr William Dalgl^ish. If ye
depart from what I taught you in a hair-breadth, for f^ar or favor of men or
desire of ease in this world, I take heaven and earth to witness that ill shall
come upon you in end. Build not your nest here: This world is an hard ill made
bed, no rest in it, for your soul: awake, awake, and make haste to seek that
pearl Christ, that this world sees not. Your night and your Master Christ,
will be upon you within a clap; your hand-breadth of time will not bide you:
Take Christ, howbeit a storm follow him: howbeit this day be not yours and
Christ's, the morrow will be yours and his. I would not exchange the joy of my
bonds and imprisonment for Christ, with all the joy of this dirty and
soul-skinned world. I have a lovebed with Christ, and am filled with his love.
I desire your wife to do what I write to you: Let her remember how dear
Christ would be to her, when her breath turns cold, and the eye-strings shall
break. O how joyful should my soul be, to know that I had brought on a
marriage betwixt Christ and that people, fevv or many: if it be not so, I
will be woe to be a vvitness against them. Use prayer, love not the world, be
humble and esteem little of your self; love your enemies and pray for them;
make conscience of speaking truth when none knows but God. I never eat, but I
pray for you all. Pray for me: Ye and I shall see one another up in our
father's house. I rejoice to hear that your eye is upon Christ. Follow on, hing
on, and quite him not. The Lord Jesus be with your spirit.

Aberd. 1637. Your affectionat Brother in our Lord Jesus, S. R.

To ALEXANDER GORDON of Earlestoun. (86.)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter which refreshed me:
Except from your son and my brother; I have seen few l^tters from my
acquaintance in that country, which makes me heavy: But I have the company
of a Lord, who can teach us all to be kind and has the right gate of it:
though for the present I have seven up's and down's every day, yet I am
abundantly comforted and feasted with my King and welbeloved d^ily. It pleases
him to come and dine with a sad prisoner, and a solitary stranger: His
spikenard casts a smell, yet my sweet has some sour mixed with it; wherein
I must acquiesce, for there is no reason that his comforts be too cheap, seeing
they are delicates, why should he not make them so to his own? But I verily
think now, Christ has led me up to a nick in Christianity that I was never at
before, I think all before was but childhood and bairns-play. Since I
departed from you, I have been scalded, while the smoke of hell's fire went
in at my throat, and I would have bought peace with a thousand years torment
in hell: and I have been up also, after these deep dovvn-castings and sorrovvs,
before the Lamb's white throne in my father's inner court, the great King'^
dininghall, and Christ did cast a cove^ing of love over me, he has casten in a
coal in my soul, and it is s^oking among the straw and keeping the hearth
warm: I look back to what I was before, and I laugh to see the sand-houses I
built when I was a child^. At first the remembrance of many fair feast-dayes
with my Lord Jesus in public, which are now changed into silent sabbaths,
raised a great tempest, and [if I may speak so] made the Devil a do in my
soul: the devil came in, and would prompt me to make a plea with Christ, and to
lay the blame on him as a hard master: But now these mists are blown away, and
I am not only silenced as to all quarrelling, but fully satisfied. Now I
wonder that any man living can laugh upon the world or give it a hearty
good-day. The Lord Jesus has handled me so, that as I am now disposed, I think
never to be in this world's common again for a night's lodging: Christ bears
me good company; he has eased me when I saw it not, lifting the cross off my
shoulders, so that I think it to be but a feather, because underneath are
everlasting arms. God forbid, it came to bartering or niffering of crosses, for
I think my cross so sweet, that I know not where I would get the like of it.
Christ's honey-combs drop so abundantly that they sweeten my gall: Nothing
breaks my heart but that I cannot get the daughters of Jerusalem to tell them
of my bride-groom's glory: I charge you in the name of Christ, that ye tell all
ye come to, of it, and yet it is above telling and understanding. Oh if all the
kingdom were as I am, except my bonds! they know not the love-kisses that my
only Lord Jesus wastes on a dated prisoner. On my salvation, this is the
only way to the new city. I know Christ has no dumb seals; would he put his
privy seal upon blank paper? he has sealed my sufferings with comforts. I
write this to confirm you. I write now what I have seen as well as heard. Now
and then my silence burns up my spirit: But Christ has said, thy stipend is
running up with interest in heaven as if thou were preaching: And this from a
King's mouth rejoices my heart. At other times, I am sad for dwelling in
Kedar's tents: There are none [that I yet know of] but two persons in this
town, that I dare give my word for: And the Lord has removed my brethren and
my acquaintance far from me: and it may be, I be forgotten in the place, where
the Lord made me the instrument to do some good. But I see this is vanity in
me: Let him make of me what he pleases, if he make salvation out of it to me.
I am tempted and troubled that all the fourteen Prelates should have been armed
of God against me only, while the rest of my brethren are still preaching: But
I dare not say one word but this, it is good, Lord Jesus, beacuse thou have
done it. Woe is me for the virgin daughter, woe is me for the desolation of the
virgin daughter of Scotland! O if my eyes were a fountain of tears to weep day
and night for that poor widow Kirk, that poor miserable harlot! Alas that my
father has put to the door my poor harlot mother! Oh for that cloud of black
wrath and fury of the indignation of the Lord, that is hanging over the Land.
Sir, write to mel beseech you: I pray you also, be kind to my ^fflicted
brother. Remember my love to your wife: and The prayers and the blessin^ of the
prisoner of Christ be on you. Frequent your meetings for prayer and communion
with God, they would be sweet meerings to me.

Aberd. 16. Febr. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To ROBERT GORDON of Knockbrex. (87)
My Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be multiplied upon you: I am almost wearying, yea
wondering that ye write not to me; though I know it is not forgetfulness. As
for my self, I am every way well, all glory to God: I was before at a plea with
Christ, but it was bought by me and unlawful; because his whose providence was
not yea and nay to my yea and nay, and because I believed Christ's outward look
better then his faithful promise: Yet he has in patience waited on, while
I'be come to my self, and has not taken advantage of my weak apprehensions of
his goodness: Great and holy is his name: He looks to what I desire to be,
and not to what I am. One thing I have learned, If I had been in Christ by way
of adhesion only, as many branches are, I should have been burnt to ashes,
and this world should have seen a suffering minister of Christ turned (of
something once in shew] into unsavory salt. But my Lord Jesus had a good eye
that the tempter should not play foul play, and blow out Christ's candle; he
took no thought of my stomach, and fretting and grudging humor, but of his
own grace: when he burnt the house he saved his own goods: And I believe, the
devil and the persecuting world shall reap no fruit of me, but burnt ashes: for
he will see to his own gold, and save that from being consumed with the fire. O
what ow I to the file, to the hammer, to the furnace of my Lord Jesus! Who has
now let me see how good the wheat of Christ is, that goes through his mill and
his oven, to be made bread for his own table: Grace tried is better then grace,
and it is more then grace, it is glory in it is infancy. I now see, godliness is
more then the outside and this world's passements and their buskings: Who
knows the truth of grace without a trial? O how little gets Christ of us,
but that which he wins, [to speak so] with much toil and pains! And how soon
would faith frieze without a cross! How many dumb crosses have been laid upon
my back, that had never a tongue to speak the sweetness of Christ, as this
has? when Christ blesses his own crosses with a tongue, they breath out
Christ's love, wisdom, kindness and care of us. Why should I start at the
plough of my Lord, that makes deep furrows on my soul? I know he is no idle
husbandman, he purposes a crop. O that this white withered lay-ground were
made fertile to bear a crop for him, by whom it is so painfully dressed, and
that this fallow ground were broken up! Why was I [a fool] grieved that he put
his garland and his rose upon my head, the glory and honor of his faithful
witnesses? I desire now to make no more pleas with Christ: Verily he has not
put me to a loss by what I suffer, he owes me nothing; for in my bonds, how
sweet and comfortable have the thoughts of him been to me: where in I find a
sufficient recompense of reward! How blind are my adversaries who sent me to a
banqueting house, to a house of wine, to my lovely Lord Jesus his lovefeasts,
and not to a prison or place of exile? Why should I smother my husband's
honesty, or sin against his love, or be a niggard in giving out to others, what
I get for nothing. Brother, eat with me and give thanks: I charge you before
God, that ye speak to others, and invite them to help me to praise. Oh my debt
of praise, how weighty is it, and how far run up! Oh that others would lend me
to pay, and learn me to praise! Oh, I a drowned Dyvour! Lord Jesus, take my
thoughts for payment. Yet I am in this hot summer-blenk with the tear in my
eye; for, by reason of my silence, sorrow, sorrow has filled me: My harp is
hanged upon the willow trees, because I am in a strange land. I am still kept
in exercise with envious brethren: My mother has born me a man of contention.
Write to me your mind anent Y. C. I cannot forget him, I know not what God
has to do with him: and your mind anent my Parishoners behavior, and how
they are served in preaching, or if there be a Minister as yet thrust in upon
them, which I desire greatly to know, and which I much fear. Dear Brother, ye
are in my heart, to live and to die with you. Visit me with a letter; Pray for
me: Remember my love to your wife. Grace, grace be with you: and God who
hears prayer visit you, and set it be unto you according to the prayers of.

Aberd. Jan. 1. 1367. Your own Brother and Christ's Prisoner. S. R.

To my welbeloved and reverend brother Mr ROBERT BLAIR. [88]
Reverend and dearly beloved Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace from God our father and from our Lord Jesus Christ be
to you: It is no great wonder, my Dear Brother, that ye be in heaviness for a
season, and that God's will in crossing your design and desires to dwell
amongst a people whose God is the Lord, should move you: I deny not, but ye
have cause to enquire what his providence speaks in this to you; but God's
directing and commanding will, can by no good logic, be concluded from events
of providence. The Lord sent Paul many errands for the spreading of his Gospel,
where he found lions in his way: a promise was made to his people of the holy
land and yet many nations in the way fighting against, and ready to kill them
who had the promise, or keep them from poss^ssing that good land which the Lord
their God had given them. I know ye have most to do with submission of spirit;
but I persuade my self, ye have learned in every condition wherein ye are cast,
therein to be content, and to say, good is the will of the Lord, let it be
done. I believe, the Lord tackleth his ship often to fetch the wind, and that
he purposes to bring mercy out of your sufferings and silence, which [I know
from mine own experience] is grievous to you: s^eing he knows our willing
mind to serve him, our wages and stipend is running to the fore with our God;
even as some tick soldiers get their pay when then they are bed-^ast and not
able to go to the fields with others. Though Israel be not gathered yet shall
I be glorious in the eyes of the Lord and my God shall be my strentgh, Isa. 49:
3. and we are to believe it shall be thus ere all the play be played, Ier. 51:
35. The violence done to me and my flesh, be upon Babylon, and the great
whore's lovers, shall the inhabitants of Zion say, and my blood be upon Caldea,
shall Jerusalem say and Zech. 12: 2. Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cap of
trembling to all the people about, where they shall be in the siege bosh
against Judah and Ierus them v. 3. And is that day, I will make Jerusalem a
burden so(...) stone for all people, they that burden themselves with it, shall
be broken in pieces: though all the people of the earth be gathered against it.
When they have eaten and swallowed us up, they shall be sick and vomit us out
living men again: the devil's stomach cannot digest the Church of God.
Suffering is the other half of our ministry, howbeit the hardest: For we would
be content our King Jesus would make an open proclamation and cry down crosses;
and cry up joy, gladness, ease, honor, and peace; but it must not be so;
through many affections we must enter into the Kingdom of God: not only by
them, but through them must we go: and wiles will not take us by the cross: It
is folly to think, to steal to heaven with a whole skin. For myself I am here a
prisoner confined in Aberd^n, threatened to be removed to Caithness, because I
desire to edify in this town; and I am openly preached against in the pulpits
in my hearing, and tempted with disputations by the Doctors, especially by D.
B. Yet I am not ashamed of my Lord Jesus his garland and crown: I would not
exchange my weeping with the fourteen Prelat, painted laughter. At my first
coming here, I took the Dorts at Christ and would forsooth summond him for
unkindness; I sought a plea of my Lord and was tossed with challenges, whether
he loved me or not? and disputed all over again that he had done to me; because
his word was a fire shut up in my bowels and I was weary with forbearing;
because I said I was cast out of the Lord's inheritance: but now I see I was a
fool: My Lord miskend all and did bear with my foolish jealousies and miskend
that ever I wronged his love, and now he is come again with mercy under his
wings: I past from my [O witless] summonds: he is God [I see] and I am man. Now
it has pleased him to renew his love to my soul, and to date his poor
prisoner. Therefore, my dear Brother, help me to praise, and show the Lord's
people with you, what he has done to my soul, that they may pray and praise:
and I charge you, in the name of Christ, not to omit it; for, for this cause I
write to you that my sufferings may glorify my royal King and edify his
church in Ireland. He knows how one of Christ's love-coals has burnt my soul
with a desire to have my bonds to preach his glory, whose cross I now bear. God
forgive you if ye do it not; But I hope the Lord will move your heart to
proclaim in my behall, the sweetness, excellency and glory of my royal King. It
is but our soft flesh that has raised a slander on the cross of Christ; I see
now the white side of it: My Lord's chains are all overguilded. O if Scotland
and Ireland had part of my feast! and yet I get not my meat but with many
strokes. There are none here to whom I can speak; I dwell in Kedar's tents.
Refresh me with a letter from you: Few know what is betwixt Christ and me. Dear
Brother, upon my salvation, this is his truth that we suffer for: Christ would
not seal a blank charter to souls. Courage, courage, joy, joy for evermore! O
joy unspeakable and glorious! Oh for help to set my crowned King on high! O for
love to him who is altogether lovely! That love which many waters cannot
quench, neither can the floods drown! I remember you, and I bear your name on
my breast to Christ: I beseech you forget not his afflicted prisoner. Grace,
mercy and peace be with you. Salute in the Lord from me Mr Cuninghame, Mr
Livingston, Mr Ridge, Mr Colwart, etc.

Aberd. Feb. 7. 1637. Your Brother and fellow prisoner. S. R.

To JOHN KENNEDY Bailiffe of Air. (89:)
Worthy and welbeloved Brother
GRace mercy and peace be unto you: I am yet waiting what our Lord will do for
his afflicted church, and for my reentry to my Lord's house. Oh that I could
hear the forfeiture of Christ [now casten out of his inheritance] recalled and
taken off by open proclamation, and that Christ were restored to be a Free
holder and a landed Hieritour in Scotland: and That the courts fenced in the
name of the bastard Prelates [their Godfather's the Pop's Bailiffes and
Sherifes] were cried down! Oh how sweet a sight were it to see all the Tribes
of the Lord in this land fetching home again our banished king Christ to his
own palace, his Sanctuary and his throne! I shall think it mercy to my soul, if
my faith shall out-watch all this winter night and not nod or slumber, till my
Lord's summer day dawn upon me. It is much if faith and hope in the sad nights
of our heavy trial escape with a whole skin, and without crack or crook: I
confess unbelief has not reason to be either father or mother to it: [for
unbelief is always an irrational thing] but how can it be, but such weak eyes
as ours must cast water in a great smoke; or that a weak head should not turn
giddy when the water runs deep and strong? But God be thanked that Christ in
his children can endure a stress and storm: howbeit soft nature would fall down
in pieces. Oh that I had that confidence as to rest rest on this, though he
should grind me into small powder, and bray me into dust, and scatter the dust
to the four winds of heaven; that my Lord would gather up the powder and make
me up a new vessel again to bear Christ's name to the world: I am sure that
love bottomed and seated upon the faith of his love to me would desire and
endure this, and would even claim and thriep kindness upon Christ's strokes,
and kiss his lovely glooms: and both spell and read salvation upon the wounds
made by Christ's sweet hands. Oh that I had but a promise from the mouth of
Christ, of his love to me; and then howbeit my faith were as tender as paper I
think longing and dwining and griening of sick desires would cause it bide out
the siege, till the Lord came to fill the soul with his love: and I know also
in that case faith should abide green and sappy at the root, even at mid
winter, and stand out against all storms: However it be I know Christ wins
heaven in dispite of hell; But I ow as many praises and thanks to free grace as
would lie betwixt me and the utmost border of the highest heaven, suppose ten
thousand heavens were all laid above other: But oh I have nothing that can hire
or bud grace, for if grace would take hire it were no more grace; but all our
stability, and the strength of our salvation is anchored and fastened upon free
grace: and I am sure Christ has by his death and blood casten the knot so fast
that the fingers of devils and hel-fuls of sins cannot loose it; and that bond
of Christ [that never yet was nor never shall nor can be registrated] stands
surer then heaven or the days of heaven, as that sweet pillar of the covenant,
whereupon we all hang: Christ and all his little ones under his two wings, and
in the compass or circle of his arms, is so sure, that cast him and them in
the ground of the sea, he shall come up again and not loose one: An odd one
cannot, nor shall not be lost in the telling. This was always God's aim since
Christ came in the play betwixt him and us, to make men dependent creatures,
and in the work of our salvation to put created strength, and arms, and legs of
clay, quit out of play, and out of office and court: and now God has
substituted in our room and accepted his Son the mediator for us and all that
we can make. If this had not been I would have skinked over and foregone my
part of paradise and salvation, for a breakfast of dead moth-eaten earth; but
now I would not give it, nor let it go for more then I can tell: and truly they
are silly fools, and ignorant of Christ's worth [and so full ill trained and
tutoured] who tell heaven and Christ over the board, for two feathers or two
straws of the devil's painted pleasures, only lustred in the utter side. This
is our happiness now, that our reckonings at night when eternity shall come
upon us, cannot be told; we shall be so far gainers and so far from being super
expended [as the poor fools of this world are, who give out their money and get
in but black hunger] that Angels cannot lay our counts nor sum our advantage
and in-comes. Who knows how far is it to the bottom of our Christ, and to the
ground of our heaven? Who ever weighed Christ in a pair of balances? Who has
seen the foldings, and plyes, and the heights and depths of that glory which is
in him and kept for us? Oh for such a heaven as to stand afar off and see and
love and long for him; while time's thread be cut, and this great work of
creation dissolved at the coming of our Lord! Now to his Grace I recommend you.
I beseech you also pray for a re-entry to me into the Lord's house, if it be
his good will:

Aberd. Jan. 6. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus: S. R.

To ELIZABETH KENNEDY. (90)
MISTRESS.
GRace mercy and peace be unto you: I have long had a purpose of writing to
you, but I have been hindered: I heartily desire that ye would mind your
journey; and consider to what airth your soul sets it is face; for all come
not home at night, who suppose they have set their face heavenward: it is a
woeful thing to die and miss heaven, and to lose house-room with Christ at
night: It is an evil journey where travelers are benighted in the fields. I
persuade my self that thousands shall be deceived and ashamed of their hope:
because they cast their anchor in sinking sands they must lose it. Till now I
knew not the pain, labor, nor difficulty that there is to win home; nor did I
understand so well before this, what that means: The righteous shall scarcely
be saved. Oh how many a poor Professor's candle is blown out and never lighted
again! I see ordinary profession, and to be ranked amongst the children of God,
and to have a name among men, is now thought good enough to carry professors to
heaven; but certainly a name is but a name, and will never bide a blast of
God's storm: I counsel you not to give your soul or Christ rest, nor your eyes
sleep, till ye have gotten something that will bide the fire and stand out the
storm. I am sure if my one foot were in heaven and then he would say, fend thy
self, I will hold my grips of thee no longer: I should go no further; but
presently fall down in as many Pieces of dead nature. They are happy for
evermore who are over head and ears in the love of Christ, and know no sickness
but love-sickness for Christ: and feel no pain but the pain of an absent and
hidden welbeloved. We run our souls out of breath and tire them in coursing and
galloping after our own night-dreams [such are the rovings of our miscarrying
hearts] to get some created good thing in this life and on this side of death:
We would fain slay and spin out a heaven to our solves in this side of the
water; but sorrow, want, changes, crosses and sin are both woof and warp in
that ill-spun web. O how sweet and dear are these thoughts that are still upon
the things which are above! and how happy are they who are longing to have
little sand in their glass and to have time's thread cut and can cry to Christ,
Lord Jesus have over, come and fetch the driry passenger! I wish our thoughts
were more frequently then they are on our country. O but heaven casts a
sweet smell afar off, to these who have spiritual smelling! God has made many
fair flowers, but the fairest of them all is heaven, and the flower of all
flowers is Christ. O why do we not flee up to that lovely one? Alas that there
is such scarcity of love, and lovers of Christ amongst us all. Fie, fie upon us
who love fair things, as fair gold, fair houses, fair lands, fair pleasures,
fair honors and fair persons; and do not pine and melt away with love for
Christ. O would to God I had more love for his sake. O for as much love as
would lie betwixt me and heaven for his sake. O for as much love as would go
round about the earth and over the heaven, yea the heaven of heavens and ten
thousand worlds, that I might let all out upon fair, fair, only fair Christ!
But alas I have nothing for him; yet he has much for me: it is no gain to
Christ that he gets my little feckless span-length and hand-breadth of love.
If men would have something to do with their hearts and their thoughts that
are always rolling up and down, like men with oars in a boat after sinful
vainities, they may find great and sweet employment to their thoughts upon
Christ: If these frothie fluctuaring and restless hearts of ours, would come
all about Christ and look in to his love, to bottomless love, to the depth of
mercy, to the unsearchable riches of his grace, to enquire after and search
into the beauty of God in Christ; they would be swallowed up in the depth, and
height, length, and breadth of his goodness. Oh if men would draw the curtains
and look in to the inner side of the arc, and behold how the fullness of the
Godhead dwells in him bodily! O who would not say let me die, let me die ten
times to see a sight of him! ten thousand deaths were no great price to give
for him. I am sure, sick fainting love would highten the market and raise the
price to the double for him: But alas if men and Angels were rouped and sold at
the dearest price, they would not all buy a night's love or a four and twenty
hours sight of Christ! O how happy are they who get Christ for nothing! God
send me no more for my part of Paradise, but Christ: and surely I were rich
enough and as well heaven'd as the best of them, if Christ were my heaven. I
can write no better thing to you, then to desire you, if ever ye laid Christ in
a count; to take him up and count over again; and weigh him again and again:
And after this have no other to court your love, and to woo your soul's,
delight but Christ: he will be found worthy of all your love; howbeit it should
swell upon you from the earth to the uppermost circle of the heaven of heavens.
To our Lord Jesus and his love I commend you.

Aberd. 1637 Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To JONET KENNEDY. (91)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: Ye are not a little obliged to his rich
grace who has separat you for himself, and for the promised inheritance with
the saints in light, from this condemned and guilty world: Hold fast Christ,
contend for him, it is a lawful plea to go to holding and drawing for Christ;
and it is not possible to keep Christ peaceably, having once gotten him, except
the devil were dead. It must be your resolution to set your face against
Satan's northern tempests and storms for salvation: Nature would have heaven
come sleeping to us in our beds: we would all buy Christ, sobeing we might make
price our selves; but Christ is worth more blood and lives then either ye or I
have to give him. When we shall come home and enter to the possession of our
brother's fair kingdom, and when our heads shall find the weight of the
eternal crown of glory, and when we shall look back to pains and sufferings;
then shall we see life, and sorrow, to be less then one step or stride from a
prison to glory: and that our little inch of time-suffering is not worthy of
our first night's welcome-home to heaven. O what then will be the weight of
every one of Christ's kisses! O how weighty and of what worth shall every one
of Christ's love-smiles be! O when once he shall thrust a wearied traveller's
head betwixt his blessed breasts, the poor soul shall think one kiss of Christ
has fully paid home forty or fifty years wet feet, and all it is sore hearts
and light sufferings it had in following after Christ! O thrice blinded souls
whose hearts are charmed and betwitched with dreams, shadows, feckless things,
night-vanities and night fancies of a miserable life of sin! Shame on us who
sit still fettered with the love and liking of the loan of a piece dead clay. O
poor fools who are beguiled with painted things and this world's fair weather
and smooth promises, and rotten worm-eaten hopes! may not the devil laugh to
see us give out our souls and get in but corrupt and counterfeit pleasures of
sin. O for a sight of eternity's glory, and a little tasting of the Lamb's
marriage-supper! halt a draught or a drop of the wine of consolations that is
up in our banqueting house, out of Christ's own hand would make our stomachs
loath the brown bread and the sour drink of a miserable life. O how far are we
berest or wit, to chase and hunt and run, till our souls be out of breath after
a condemned happiness of our own making! and do we not sit far in our own
light, to make it a matter of bairns-play to skink and drink over paradise and
the heaven that Christ did sweat for, even for a blast of smoke and for Esau's
morning breakfast? O that we were out of ourselves and dead to this world, and
this world dead and crucified to us, and then we should be close out of love
and conceit of any masked and fairded lover whatsoever: then Christ would win
and conquer to himself a lodging in the inmost yolk of our heart: then Christ
should be our night-song and our morning-song: then the very noise and din of
our welbeloved's feet when he comes, and his first knock or rap, at the door
should be as the news of two heavens to us. Oh that our eyes and our
soul's-smelling should go after a blasted and sunburned flower, even this
plaistered fair out-sided world, and then we have neither eye nor smell for the
flower of I^sse, for that plant of renown, for Christ the choicest, the
fairest, the sweetest rose that ever God planted! O let some of us die to feel
the smell of him, and let my part of this rotten world be forfeited and sold
for evermore, providing I may anchor my tottering soul upon Christ! I know it
is sometimes at this, Lord, what will thou have for Christ? But O Lord can
thou be budded or propined with any gift for Christ? O Lord, can Christ be
sold, or rather may not a poor needy sinner have him for nothing? If I can get
no more, O let me be pained to all eternity with longing for him. The joy of
hungring for Christ, should be my heaven for evermore. Alas that I cannot draw
souls and Christ together: but I desire the coming of his Kingdom, and that
Christ [as I assuredly hope he shall] would come upon withered Scotland as rain
upon the new mowen grass. O let the king come! O let his Kingdom come! O let
their eyes rot in their eye holes who will not receive him home again to reign
and rule in Scotland! Grace, grace be with you.

To his Reverend and Dear Brother, Mr DAVID DICKSON. (92)
Reverend and dearest. Brother.
WHat joy have I out of heaven's gates, but that my Lord Jesus be glorified in
my bonds? Blessed be ye of the Lord who contribut any thing to my obliged and
indebted praises: dear Brother help me a poor dyvour to pay the interest, for I
cannot come nigh to render the principal: It is not jest nor sport which
makes me to speak and write as I do: I never before came to that nick or
pitch of a communion with Christ that I have now attained unto, for my
confirmation. I have been these two Sabbaths or three in private, taking
instruments in the name of God, that my Lord Jesus and I have kissed each other
in Aberden, the house of my pilgrimage: I seek not an apple to play me with he
knows, whom I serve in the spirit but a seal; I but beg earnest, and am
content to suspend and frist glory while supper time: I know this world will
not last with me; for my moonlight is noonday light, and my four-hours above
my feasts when I was a preacher; at which times also, I was embraced very often
in his arms: But who can blame Christ to take me on behind him [if I may say
so] on his white horse or in his chariot paved with love through a water: Will
not a father take his little dated Davie in his arms, and carry him over a
ditch or a mire? my short legs could not step over this laire or sinking mire
and therefore my L: Jesus will bear me through: If a change come and a dark day,
so being that he will keep my faith without flaw or crack, I dare not blame
him; howbeit I get no more while I come to heaven: But ye know the physic
behooved to have sugar, my faith was fallen a swoon, and Christ but held up a
swooning man's head: Indeed I pray not for a Dated Bairn's diet, he knows I
would have Christ sour or sweet; any way. sobeing it be Christ indeed: I stand
not now upon paired apples or sugared dishes; but I cannot blame him to give,
and I must gape and make a wide mouth: since Christ will not pantry-up joys,
he must be welcome who will not bide away: I seek no other fruit but that he
may be glorified: he knows, I would take hard fare to have his name set on
high. I bless you for your counsel: I hope to live by faith and swim without a
mass or bundle of joyful sense under my chinne; at lest to venture albeit I
should be ducked. Now for my case I think the Council should be essayed, and
the event referred to God: Duties are ours and events are God's. I shall go
through yours upon the Covenant at leisure, and write to you my mind
thereanent; and anent the Arminian Contract betwixt the father and the son. I
beseech you set to, to go through scripture: yours on the Hebrews is in great
request with all who would be acquaint with Christ's Testament. I purpose God
willing to set about Hosea and to try if I can get it to the press here. It
refreshes me much that ye are so kind to my brother, I hope your counsel shall
do him good, I recommend him to you, since I am so far from him: I am glad
that the dying servant of God, famous and faithful Mr Cuninghame sealed your
ministry before he fell asleep: Grace, grace be with you.

To the Much honored WILLIAM RIGGE of Athernie. (93)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your longlooked-for and short
letter; I would ye had spoken more to me who stand in need: I find Christ as
ve write ay the longer the better, and therefore cannot but rejoice in his
salvation, who has made my chains my wings, and has made me a King over my
crosses and over my adversaries: glory, glory, glory to his high, high and holy
name: Not one ounce, not one grain-weight more is laid on me, then he has
enabled me to bear: And I am not so much wearied to suffer as Sion's haters are
to persecute. Oh if I could find a way in any measure to strive to be even
with Christ's love, but that I must give over! Oh who would help a dyvour to
pay praises to the King of saints, who triumphs in his weak servants? I see
if Christ but ride upon a worm, or a feather, his horse will neither stumble
nor fall: The worm Jacob is made by him a new sharp threshing instrument having
teeth to thresh the mountains, and beat them small, and to make the hills as
chaff and to fan them, so as the wind shall carry them away, and the whirlwind
shall scatter them. Isa. 41: 14, 15, 16. Christ's enemies are but breaking
their own heads in pieces upon the rock laid in Zion, and the stone is not
removed out of it is place: Faith has cause, to take courage from our very
afflictions, the devil is but a whet-stone to sharpen the faith and patience of
the saints: I know he but heweth and polisheth stones all this time for the new
Jerusalem: But in all this, three things have much moved me, since it has
pleased my Lord to turn my moon light into daylight. First, he has yoked me
to work, to wrestle with Christ's love of longing, wherewith I am sick, pained,
fainting and like to die, because I cannot get himself, which I think a strange
sort of desertion; for I have not himself [whom if I had my love-sickness would
cool and my fever go away, at least I should know the heat of the fire of
complacencie, which would cool the scorching heat of the fire of desire] and
yet I have no penury of his love, and so I dwin, I die, and he seems not to
rue on me. I take instruments in his hand that I would have him; but I cannot
get him, and my best cheer is black hunger: I bless him for that feast.
Secondly, old challenges now and then revive and cast all down, I go halting
and sighing, fearing there be an unseen process yet coming out, and that
heavier then I can answer: I cannot read distinctly my Surtie's act of
cautionrie for me in particular, and my discharge; and sense rather then faith
assures me of what I have: So unable am I to go but by an hold. I could [with
reverence of my Lord] forgive Christ, if he would give me as much faith as I
have hunger for him: I hope the pardon is now obtained, but the peace is not so
sure to me as I would wish: Yet, one thing I know; there is not a way to heaven
but the way he has graced me to profess and suffer for. Thirdly, woe, woe is
me for the virgin daughter of Scotland and for the fearful desolation and
wrath appointed for this land; And yet all are sleeping, eating and drinking,
laughing and sporting, as if all were well. Oh our dim gold, our dumb, blind
pastors, the sun is gone down upon them, and our Nobles bid Christ send for
himself if he be Christ: It were good we should learn in time the way to our
strong hold. Sir howbeit not acquainted remember my love to your wife, I pray
God establish you.

To JOHN EWART Bailiffe of Kirkcudbright. (94)
My very worthy and dear Friend.
I Cannot but most kindly thank you for the expressions of your love: your love
and respect to me is a great comfort to me. I bless his high and glorious name
that the terrors of great men, have not affrighted me from open avouching of
the Son of God; nay his cross is the sweetest burden that ever I bare: It is
such a burden as wings are to a bird, or sails to a ship to carry me forward
to my harbor. I have not much cause to fall in love with the world; but rather
to wish that he who sits upon the floods would bring my broken ship to Land,
and keep my conscience safe in these dangerous times: for wrath from the Lord
is coming on this sinful Land. It were good that we prisoners of hope knew of
our strong hold to run to, before the storm come on: Therefore Sir I beseech
you by the mercies of God and comforts of his Spirit, by the blood of your
Savior, and by your compearance before the sin-revenging Judge of the world,
keep your garments clean and stand for the truth of Christ, which ye profess:
When the time shall come that your eye strings shall break, your face wax pale,
your breath grow cold, and this house of clay shall totter, and your one foot
shall be over the march in eternity, it shall be your comfort and joy that ye
gave your name to Christ. The greatest part of the world think heaven at the
next door, and that Christianity is an easy task; but they will be beguiled.
Worthy Sir, I beseech you make sure work of salvation: I have found by
experience that all I could do, has had much ado in the day of my trial; and
therefore lay up a sure foundation for the time to come. I cannot requite you
for your your undeserved favors to me and my nowafflicted brother; but I trust
to remember you to God: remember me heartily to your kind wife.

Aberd. March. 13. 1637. Yours in his only Lord Jesus. S. R.

To WILLIAM FULLERTON. Provest of Kirkcudbright. (95)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am obleiged to your love in God: I beseech
you Sir let nothing be so dear to you as Christ's truth, for salvation is worth
all the world; and therefore be not afraid of men that shall die: the Lord
shall do for you in your suffering for him, and shall bless your house and
seed, and ye have God's promise that ye shall have his presence in fire, water
and in seven tribulations. Your day will wear to an end, and your sun go down:
in death it will be your joy that ye have ventured all ye have for Christ, and
there is not a promise of heaven made but to such as are willing to suffer for
it: it is a Castle taken by force. This earth is but the clay-portion of
bastards, and therefore no wonder the world smile on it is own; but better
things are laid up for hi^ lawfully begotten bairnes; who^ the world hates: I
have experience to speak this: for I would not exchange my prison and sad
nights with the court, honor, and ease of my adversaries: My Lord is pleased
to make many unknown faces to laugh upon me, and to provide a lodging for me:
and he himself visits my soul with feasts of spiritual comforts. O how sweet
a Master is Christ! Blessed are these who lay down all for him. I thank you
kindly for your love to my distressed brother. Ye have the blessing and prayers
of the prisoner of Christ to you, your Wife and Children. Remember my love and
blessing to William and Samuel: I desire them in their youth to seek the Lord
and fear his great name, to pray twice a day [at least] to God, and to read
God's word, to keep themselves from cursing, lying and filthy talking. Now the
only wise God and the presence of the Son of God be with you all.

Aberd. March. 13. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the worthy and much honored Mr ALEXANDER COLVILL, Of Blair. (96)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: The bearer hereof M. R. F. is most kind to
me; I desire you to thank him: But none is so kind as my only royal King and
Master, whose cross is my garland: The King dineth with his prisoner and his
spikenard casts a smell: He has led me up to such a pitch and nick of
joyful communion with himself, as I never knew before: When I look back to
by-gones, I judge my self to have been a child at A, B, C. with Christ. Worthy
Sir, pardon me, I dare not conceal it from you, it is as a fire i^ my bowels:
In hi^ pres^nce who sees me I sp^ak it, I am pained, pained with the love of
Christ; he has made me sick and wounded me: Hunger for Christ out-runneth
faith: I miss faith more then love. O if the three Kingdoms would come and see!
O if they knew his kindness to my soul! It has pleased him to bring me to
this, that I will not strike sails to this world nor flatter it, nor adore this
clay idol that fools worship: As I am now disposed, I think I will neither
borrow nor lend with it; and yet I get my meat from Christ with nurture; for
seven times a day I am lifted up and casten down. My dumb Sabbaths burden my
heart and make it bleed: I want not fearful challenges and jealousies sometimes
of Christ's love, that he has casten me over the dike of the vineyard as a dry
tree: But this is my infirmity: By his grace I take my self in these ravings:
It is kindly that faith and love both be sick, and fevers are kindly to most
joyful communion with Christ. Ye are blessed who avouch Christ openly before
the Princes of this Kingdom, whose eyes are upon you: It is your glory to lift
him up on his throne, to carry his tr^in and bear up the hem of his robe royal:
He has an hiding place for M. A. C. against the storm: go on and fear not
what man can do: The saints seem to have ^he worst of it, [for apprehensions
can make a lie of Christ and of his love] but it is not so: Providence is not
rolled upon unequal and crooked wheels: All things work together for the good
of these who love God and are called according to his purpose. Ere it be long
we shall see the white side of God's Providence. My Brother's case has moved
me not a little: He wrote to me your care and kindness. Sir, the prisoner's
blessings and prayers I trust shall not go by you. He that is able to keep you
and to present you before the presence of his face with joy, establish your
heart in the love of Christ.

Aberd. 19. Febr. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To EARLESTOWN Younger. (97)
Honored and Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter which refreshed my
soul. I thank God the court is closed, I think shame of my part of it: I pass
now from my unjust summonds of unkindness libelled against Christ my Lord: He
is not such a Lord and Master as I took him to be, verily he is God, and I am
dust and ashes: I took Christ's glooms to be as good as Scripture speaking
wrath, but I have seen the other side of Christ and the white side of his cross
now. I behooved to come to Aberdeen to learn a new mystery in Christ, that his
promise is better to be believed then his looks, and that the devil can cause
Christ's glooms speak a lie to a weak man: Nay, verily I was a child before,
all by-gones are but b^irns play: I would I could begin to be a Christian in
sad earnest: I n^ed not blame Christ if I be not one, for he has showed me
heaven and hell in Aberdeen: But the truth is, for all my sorrow, Christ is
nothing in my debt; for his comforts have refreshed my soul: I have heard and
s^en him in his sweetness, so, as I am almost saying, it is not he that I was
wont to meet with: He laugheth more cheerfully, his kisses are more sweet and
soul-refreshing then the kisses of the Christ I saw before were [though he be
the same] or rather, the King has led me up to a measure of joy and communion
with my Bridegroom, that I never attained to before; so that often I think, I
will neither borrow nor lend with this world, I will not strike sail to crosses
nor flatter them, to be quite of them as I have done. Come all crosses,
welcome, welcome! So I may get my heartfull of my Lord Jesus. I have been so
near him as I have said, I take instruments this is the Lord, leave a token
behind thee that I may never forget this. Now what can Christ do more to date
one of his poor prisoners? Therefore, Sir, I charge you in the name of my Lord
Jesus, praise with me and show to others what he has done unto my soul. This
is the fruit of my sufferings that I desire Christ's name may be spread abroad
in this Kingdom in my behalf. I hope in God not to slander him again; yet in
all this I get not my feasts without some mixture of gall; neither am I free of
old jealousies, for he has removed my lovers and friends far from me, he has
made my congregation desolate and taken away my crown: and my dumb sabbaths are
like a stone tied to a bird's foot that wants not wings, they seem to hinder
me to fleo: Were it not that I dare not say one word, but, Well done, Lord
Jesus. We can in our prosperity sport our selves and be too bold with Christ,
yea be that insolent as to chide with him; but under the water we dare not
speak. I wonder now of my sometimes boldness, to chide and quarrel Christ, to
nickname Providence when it stroaked me against the hair; but now swimming in
the waters, I think my will is fallen to the ground of the water: I have lost
it. I think I would fain ^et Christ alone and give him leave to do with me
what he pleases, if he would smile upon me. Verily we know not what an evil it
is to spill and indulge our selves, and to make an idol of our will: I was
once, I would not eat except I had wailed meat; now I dare not complain of
crumbs and pairings under his table: I was once that I would make the house
ado, if I saw not the world carved and set in order to my liking; now I am
silent when I see God has set servants on horseback, and is fatning and
feeding the children of perdition. I pray God I never find my will again: Oh
if Christ would subject my will to his and trample it under his feet, and
liberate me from that lawless Lord. Now Sir, in your youth gather fast, your
sun will mount to the Meridian quickly and thereafter decline: Be greedy of
grace: Study above any thing, my dear Brother, to mortify your lusts. Oh but
pride of youth, vainty, lust, idolizing of the world and charming pleasures,
take long time to root them out! As far as ye are advanced in the way to
heaven, as near as ye are to Christ as much progress as ye have made in the way
of mortification, ye will find that ye are far behind and have most of your
work before you. I never took it to be so hard, to be dead to my lusts and to
this world: When the day of visitation comes and your old idols come weeping
about you, ye will have much ado not to break your heart, it is best give up in
time with them, so as ye could at a call quite your part of this world for a
drink of water or a thing of nothing. Verily I have seen the best of this
world, a moth-eaten, thread bare coat: I purpose to lay it aside being now
hollie and old. O for my house above not made with hands! Pray for Christ's
prisoner and write to me: Remember my love to your mother: Desire her from me
to make for removing; the Lord's tide will not bide her; and to seek an
heavenly mind, that her heart may be often there. Grace, be with you.

To ROBERT GLENDINING [98]
My Dear Friend
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I thank you most kindly for your care of me,
and your love and respective kindness to my brother in his distress: I pray
the Lord ye may find mercy in the day of Christ, and I entreat you Sir to
consider the times ye live in, and that your soul is of more worth to you then
the whole world, which in the day of the blowing of the last trumpet shall lie
in white ashes, as an old castle burnt to nothing: and Remember that judgment
and eternity is before you. My dear and worthy friend, let me entreat you in
Christ's name, and by the salvation of your soul, and by your compearance
before the dreadful and sin-revenging judge of the world, make your accounts
ready: read them ere ye come to the water side; for your afternoon will wear
short, and your sun fall low and go down: and ye know that this long time your
Lord has waited on you: O how comfortable a thing shall it be to you when time
shall be no more and your soul shall depart out of the house of clay to vaste
and endless eternity, to have your soul dressed up and prepared for your
bridegroom! No loss is comparable to the loss of the soul, there is no hope
of regaining that loss. O how joyful would my soul be to hear that ye would
start to the gate, and contend for the crown, and leave all vanities, and make
Christ your garland! Let your soul put away your old lovers and let Christ have
your whole love: I have some experience to write of this to you: My witness is
in heaven, I would not exchange my chains and bonds for Christ, and my sighs
^or ten worlds glory. I judge this clay-idol that Adam's sons are rouping and
selling their souls for, not worth a drink of cold water. O if your soul were
in my soul's stead, how sick would ye be of love for that fairest one, that
fairest among the sons of men! Mayflowers and morning vapors and summer mist
posteth not so fast away as these worm-eaten pleasures that we follow: We build
castles in the air, and night dreams are our day idols that we dote on:
Salvation, Salvation is our only one necessary thing. Sir, call home your
thoughts to this work, to inquire for your welbeloved: This earth is the
portion of bastards, seek the sons inheritance, and let Christ's truth be dear
to you. I pawnd my salvation on it that this is the honor of Christ's Kingdom,
I now suffer for [and this world I hope shall not come between me and my
garland] and that this is the way to life. When ye and I shall lie lumps of
pale clay upon the cold ground, our pleasures that we now naturally love, shall
be less then nothing in that day: dear Brother, fulfill my joy and betake you
to Christ without further delay, ye will be fain at length to seek to him or
do infinitely worse. Remember my love to your wife, grace be with you.

Welbeloved and dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I thank you most kindly for your care and
love to me, and in particular to my brother in hi^ distress in Edinburgh: Go
on through your waters without wearying, your guide knows the way, follow him
and cast your ca^es and tentation upon him: and let not worms, the sons of men
affright you; they shall die and the moth shall eat them: keep your garland,
there is no less at the stake in this game betwixt us and the world then our
conscience and salvation: we have need to take heed to the game, and not to
yield to them: Let them take other things from us; but here, in matters of
conscience we must hold and draw with Kings, and set our selves in terms of
opposition with the shields of the earth. O the sweet communion for evermore
that has been between Christ and his poor prisoner! He wearieth not to be
kind: He is the fairest sight I see in Aberd: or any part that ever my feet
were in. Remember my hearty kindness to your wife, I desire her to believe and
lay her cares on God, and make fast work of salvation. Grace be with you.

To JEAN BROWN. [100]
Welbeloved and dear Sister.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter, which I esteem an
evidence of your Christian affection to me, and of your love to my honorable
Lord and Master. My desire is that your communion with Christ may grow, and
that your reckonings may be put by hand with your Lord, ere ye come to the
water side. O who knows how sweet Christs' kisses are! who has been more
kindly embraced and kissed then I his banished prisoner? If the comparison
could stand, I would not exchange Christ with heaven it self: He has left a
dart and arrow of love in my soul, and it paineth me till he come and take it
out: I find pain of these wounds because I would have possession. I know now
this worm-eaten apple, the plaistered rotten world, that the silly Children of
this world are beating and buffetting and pulling others ears for; is a portion
for bastards good enough: and that is all they have to look for. I offend not
that my adversaries stay at home at their own fireside with more yearly rent
then I; should I be angry that the good man of this house of the world casts
a dog a bone to hurt his teeth? he has taught me to be content with a borrowed
fireside and an uncouth bed: and I think I have lost nothing, the in come is
so great. O what telling is in Christ! O how weighty is my fair garland, my
crown, my fair supping-hall in glory, where I shall be above the blows and
buffettings of Prelates! Let this be your desire and let your thoughts dwell
much upon that blessedness that abides you in the other world: The fair side
of the world will be turned to you quickly, when ye shall see the crown: I hope
ye are near your lodging: O but I would think my self blessed for my part to
win the house before the shower come on! For God has a quiver full of arrows
to shoot at and shower down upon Scotland. Ye have the prayers of a prisoner of
Christ. I desire Patrick to give Christ his young love even the flower of it,
and put it by all others it were good to start soon to the way: He should
thereby have a great advantage in the evil day. Grace be with you.

Aberd. March. 7. 1637. Yours in his only Lord Jesus, S. R.

To Mr JOHN FERGUSHILL. [101]
Reverend and welbeloved in the Lord.
I Was refreshed with your letter: I am sorry for that lingering and long some
visitation that is upon your wife; but I know ye take it as a mark of a
lawfully begotten child and not of a bastard to be under your father's rod:
till ye be in heaven it will be but foul weather, one shower up and another
down: The lintel-stones and pillars of the new Jerusalem suffer more knocks of
God's hammer and tool, then the common side-wall stones: and if twenty crosses
be written for you in God's book, they will come to ninteen and then at last to
one, and after that nothing but your head betwixt Christ's breasts for
evermore: and his own soft hand to dry your face and wipe away your tears. As
for public sufferings for his truth, your Master also will see to these: Let
us put him in his own office, to comfort and deliver: the gloom of Christ's
cross is worse then it self. I cannot keep up what he has done to my soul: My
dear Brother, will I not get help of you to praise and to lift Christ up on
high? He has pained me with his love, and has left a love arrow in my heart
that has made a wound and swelled me up with desires, so, that I am to be
pitied for want of real possession: love would have the company of the party
loved: and my greatest pain is the want of him, not of his joys and comforts,
but of a near union, and communion. This is his truth I am fully persuaded I
now suffer for: For Christ has taken upon him to be witness to it, by his
sweet comforts to my soul; and shall I think him a false witness, or that he
would subscribe blank paper? I thank his high and dreadful name, for what he
has given, I hope to keep his seal and his pawn till he come and loose it
himself. I defy hell to put me off it, but he is Christ and he has met with
his prisoner: and I took instruments in his own hand, that it was he and no
other for him. When the Devil fenceth a bastard court in my Lord's ground and
gives me forged summonds, it will be my shame to misbeleeve after such a fair
broad seal: and yet Satan and my apprehension sometimes make a lie of Christ,
as if he hated me; but I dare believe no evil of Christ: if he would cool my
lovefever for himself with real presence and possession, I would be rich; but
I dare not be mislearned and seek more in that kind; howbeit it be no shame to
beg at Christ's door. I pity my adversaries, I grudge not that my Lord keeps
them at their own fireside, and has given me a borrowed b^d and a borrowed
fireside. Let the good man of the house cast a dog a bone why should I offend?
I rejoice that the broken bark shall come to land, and that Christ will on the
shore welcome the sea-sick passenger. We have need of a great stock against
this day of trial that is coming; neither chaff nor corn in Scotland, but it
shall once pass through God's sieve. Praise, praise, and pray for me; for I
cannot forget you: I know ye will be friendly to my afflicted brother, who is
now embarked in the same cause with me: Let him have your counsel and comforts.
Remember my love in Christ to your wife, her health is coming and her salvation
sleeps not. Ye have the prayers and blessing of a prisoner of Christ Sow
fast, deal bread plentifully: The pantry door will be locked on the bairns in
appearance ere long. Grace, grace be with you.

To his reverend and dear Brother, Mr ROBERT DOUGLASS. [102]
My very reverend and dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to see you in paper. I cannot but
write to you that this which I now suffer for, is Christ's truth; because he
has been pleased to seal my sufferings with joy unspeakable and glorious: I
know he will not put his seal upon blank paper: Christ has not dumb seals,
neither will he be witness to a lie. I beseech you, my dear Brother, help me to
praise and to lift Christ up on his throne above the shields of the earth. I am
astonished and confounded at the greatness of his Kindness to such a sinner. I
know, Christ and I shall never be even, I shall die in his debt: He has left
an arrow in my heart that paineth me for want of real possession: and hell
cannot quench this coal of God's kindling. I wish no man slander Christ or his
cross for my cause; for I have much cause to speak much good of him: He has
brought me to a nick and degree of communion with himself that I knew not
before. The din and gloom of our Lord's cross, is more fearful and hard then
the cross it self: He takes the bairns in his arms when they come to a deep
water, at least when they lose ground, and are put to swim, then his hand is
under their chin. Let me be helped by your prayers, and remember my love to
your kind wife. Grace be with you.

Loving friend.
COntinue in the love of Christ and the doctrine which I taught you faithfully
and painfully according to my measure: I am free of your blood: Fear the
dreadful, name of God: Keep in mind the examinations which I taught you, and
love the truth of God. Death, as fast as time flies, chaseth you out of this
life: It is possible ye make your reckoning with your judge before I see you;
let salvation be your care night and day, and set aside hours and times of the
day for prayer. I rejoice to hear that there is prayer is your house: See that
your servants keep the Lord's day. This dirt and god of clay, I mean the vain
world, is not worth the seeking. An hireling pastor is to be thrust in upon
you, in the room to which I have Christ's warrant and right: Stand to your
liberties, for the word of God allows you a vote in choosing your Pastor. What
I write to you, I write to your wife: commend me heartily to her. The grace of
God be with you.

Aberd. March. 14. 1637. Your loving friend and Pastor. S. R.

To Mr HUGH HENDERSON. (104)
My reverend and dear Brother.
I hear ye bear the marks of Christ's dying about with you, and that your
brethren have cast you out for your Master's sake: Let us wait on till the
evening and till our reckoning in black and white come before our Master.
Brother, since we must have a devil to trouble us, I love a raging devil best:
Our Lord knows what for of devil we have need of: It is best Satan be in his
own skin and look like himself: Christ weeping looks like himself also, with
whom Scribes and Pharisees were at yea and nay and sharp contradiction. Ye
have heard of the patience of Job, when he lay in the ashes, God was with him
clawing and curing his scabs, and letting out his boils, and comforting his
soul, and he took him up at last: That God is not dead yet, he will stoop and
take up fallen bairns: many broken legs since Adam's days has he spelked, and
many weary hearts has he refreshed. Bless him for comfort: Why? None comes
dry from David's well; let us go amongst the rest and cast down our toom
buckets into Christ's Ocean and suck consolations out of him: We are not so
sore stricken, but we may fill Christ's hall with weeping: We have not gotten
our answer from him yet: Let us lay up our broken plea's to a full sea, and
keep them till the day of Christ's coming: We and this world will not be even
till then: They would take our garment from us, but let us hold and them draw.
Brother, it is a strange world if we laugh not: I never saw the like of it, if
there be not paiks the man for this contempt done to the Son of God? We must
do as these who keep the bloody napkin to the Bailiffe and let him see blood:
we must keep our wrongs to our Judge and let him see our bluddered and foul
faces: Prisoners of hope must run to Christ with the gutters that tears have
made on their cheeks. Brother, for my self, I am Christ's dated one for the
present, and I live upon no deaf nuts [as we use to speak] he has opened
fountains to me in the wilderness: Go look to my Lord Jesus, his love to me is
such that I defy the world to find either brim or bottom in it. Grace be with
you.

Aberd. March. 13. 1637. Your Brother in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To the Lady ROBERTLAND. [105.]
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I shall be glad to hear that your soul
prospers and that fruit grows upon you after the Lord's husbandry and pains
in his rod, that has not been a stranger to you from your youth. It is the
Lord's kindness that he will take the scum off us in the fire: Who knows how
needful winnowing is to us, and what dross we must want ere we enter into the
Kingdom of God? So narrow is the entry to heaven that our knots, our bunches
and lumps of pride, and self-love, and idol-love, and world-love must be
hammered off us, that we may throng in, stooping low and creeping through that
narrow and thorny entry. And now for my self, I find it the most sweet and
heavenly life, to take up house and dwelling at Christ's fireside, and set
down my tent upon Christ that foundation-stone, who is sure and faithful
ground and hard under foot. Oh if I could win to it and proclaim my self not
the world's debtor, nor a lover obliged to it; and that I mind not to hire or
bud this world's love any longer; but defy the kindness and feud of God's
whole creation whatsomever; especially the lower vault and clay part of God's
creatures, this vain earth: For what hold I of his world? A borrowed lodging
and some years houseroom, and bread and water, and fire and bed and candle,
etc. are all a part of the pension of my King and Lord to whom I ow thanks and
not to a creature. I thank God that God is God, and Christ is Christ, and the
earth the earth, and the Devil the devil, and the world the world, and that sin
is sin, and that every thing is what it is: Because he has taught me in my
wilderness not to shuffle my Lord Jesus, nor to intermix him with
creature-vanities, nor to spin or twine Christ or his sweet love in one web, or
in one thread with the world and the things thereof. Oh if I could hold and
keep Christ all alone and mix him with nothing! O if I could cry down the price
and weight of my cursed self and cry up the price of Christ, and double and
triple and augment and heighten to millions the price and worth of Christ! I am
[if I durst speak so and might lawfully complain] so hungredly tutoured by
Christ Jesus my liberal Lord, that his nice love which my soul would be in
hands with, flies me; and yet I am trained on to love him, and lust and long
and die for his love whom I cannot see: it is a wonder to pine away with love
for a covered and hid lover, and to be hungered with his love, so as a poor soul
cannot get his fill of hunger for Christ: It is hard to be hungered of hunger,
whereof such abundance for other things is in the world: But sure if we were
tutours and stewards and Masters, and Lordcarvers of Christ's love, we should
be more lean and worse fed then we are: Our meat does us the more good, that
Christ keeps the keys, and that the wind and the air of Christ's sweet
breathing and of the influence of his spirit is locked up in the hands of the
good pleasure of him, who blows where he lists: I see there is a sort of
impatient patience required in the want of Christ as to his manifestations, and
waiting on: They thrive who wait on his love and the blowing of it and the
turning of his gracious wind; and they thrive who in that on-waiting make haste
and din and much ado for their lost and hidden Lord Jesus: However it be, God
feed me with him any way. If he would come in, I shall not dispute the matter,
where he got a hole, or how he opened the lock: I should be content that Christ
and I met, suppose he should stand on the other side of hell's lake and cry to
me, Either put in your foot and come through, else ye shall not have me at all.
But what fools are we in the taking up of him and of his dealing! He has a
gate of his own beyond the thoughts of men, that no foot has skill to follow
him: But we are still ill Scholars and will go in at heavens gates wanting the
half of our lesson, and shall still be bairns so long as we are under time's
hands, and till eternity cause a sun to arise in our souls that shall give us
wit. We may see how we spill and man our own fair heaven and our salvation, and
how Christ is every day putting in one bone or other in these fallen souls of
ours, in the right place again: and that in this side of the new Jerusalem, we
shall still have need of forgiving and healing grace. I find crosses Christ's
carved work that he marketh out for us, and that with crosses he figureth and
pourtraieth us to his own image, cutting away pieces of our ill and corruption:
Lord cut, Lord carve, Lord wound, Lord do any thing that may perfect thy
Father's image in us and make us meet for glory. Pray for me [I forget not you]
that our Lord would be pleased to lend me house-room to preach his
righteousness and tell what I have heard and seen of him. Forget not Zion that
is now in Christ's calmes and in his forge: God bring her out new work. Grace,
grace be with you.

To the Earl of Cassills. [106]
Right honorable and my very good Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to your Lo: I hope your Lo: Will be pleased to
pardon my boldness, if [upon report of your zealous and forward mind that I
hear our Lord has given you in this his honorable cause, when Christ and his
Gospel are so foully wronged] I speak to your Lo: in paper, entreating your Lo:
to go on in the strength of the Lord toward, and against a storm of
Antichristian wind, that blows upon the face of this your poor Mother Church,
Christ's lilie amongst the thorns. It is your Lo: Glory and happiness when ye
see such a blow coming upon Christ, to cast up your arm to prevent it: Neither
is it a cause that needs to blush before the sun, or to flee the sentence or
censure of impartial beholders, seeing the Question indeed [if it were rightly
stated] is about the Prerogative royal of our princely and royal lawgiver, our
Lord Jesus, whose ancient march-stones and land-bounds our bastard Lord's, the
earthly generation of tyrannizing Prelates, have boldly and shamefully removed:
and they who have but-half an eye may see that it is the greedy desires of
time-idolizing Demas's and the itching scab of ambitous and climbing
Diotrephes's [who love the goat's life to climb till they cannot find a way to
set their soles on ground again] that has made such a wide breach in our
Zion's beautiful walls: and these are the men who seek no hire for the
crucifying of Christ, but his coat. Oh how forlorn and desolate is the Bride of
Christ made to all passers by! Who sees not Christ buried in this land, his
prophets hidden in caves, silenced, banished and imprisoned; Truth weeping in
sackcloth before the Judges, Parliament and the Rulers of the land? But her
bill is cast by them, and Holiness hides it self, fearing the streets for the
reporoaches and persecution of men: Justice is fallen a swoon in the gate, and
the long shadows of the evening are stretched out upon us: Woe, woe to us, for
our day flies away: what remains but that the Antichrist set down his tent
in the midst of us, except your Lo: and others with you read Christ's
supplication, and give him that which the most lewd and scandalous wretches in
this land may have before a judge, even the poor man's due, law and justice for
God's sake. O therefore, my noble and dear Lord, as ye have begun, go on in
the mighty power and strength of the Lord, to cause our Lord in his Gospel and
afflicted members laugh, and to cause the Christian Churches [whose eyes are
all now upon you] to sing for joy, when Scotland's moon shall shine like the
light of the sun, and the sun like the light of seven days in one: ye can do
noless then run and bear up the head of your dying and swooning Mother Church,
and plead for the production of her ancient charters: They hold out and put
out, they hold in and bring in at their pleasure men in God's house; they stole
the keys from Christ and his Church, and came in like the thief and the robber,
not by the door Christ; and now their song is, Authority, Authority, obedience
to Church Governors. When such a bastard and lawless pretended step-dame as
our prelacy is gone mad, it is your place who are the Nobles to rise and bind
them; at least, law should fetter such wild bulls as they are, who push all
who oppose themselves to their domination. Alas! What have we lost since
Prelates were made Master coiners to change our gold in brass, and to mix the
Lord's wine with their water? Blessed for ever shall ye be of the Lord if ye
help Christ against the mighty, and shall deliver the flock of God scattered
upon the mountains in the dark and cloudy day, out of the hands of these
idol-shepherds. Fear not men that shall be moth-eaten-clay that shall be rolled
up in a chest, and casten under the earth: Let the holy one of Israel be your
fear, and be courageous for the Lord and his truth. Remember your accounts
coming upon you with wings, as fast as time posteth away: Remember what peace
with God in Christ and the presence of the Son of God in the revealed and felt
sweetness of his love, will be to you, when eternity shall put time to the
door, and ye shall take goodnight at Time, and this little shepherd's tent of
clay, this Innes of a borrowed earth. I hope your Lo: is now and then sending
out thoughts to view this world's naughtiness and vanity and the hoped-for
glory of the life to come, and that ye resolve that Christ shall have your self
and all yours at command for him, his honor and Gospel. Thus trusting your Lo:
Will pardon my boldness, I pray that the only wise God, the very God of peace,
may preserve, strengthen and establish you to the end.

Aberd. 1637. Your Lo: at all command and obedience in Chrst. S. R.

To the Lady ROVVALAND. [107]
MADAM.
THough not acquainted I am bold in Christ to speak to vour La: in paper: I
rejoice in our Lord Jesus on your behalf, that it has pleased him [whose love
to you is as old as himself] to manifest the savor of his love in Christ Jesus
to your soul; in the revelation of his will and mind to you, now, when so many
are shut up in unbelief. O the sweet change ye have made, in leaving the black
kingdom of this world and sin, and coming over to our bridegroom's new kingdom,
to know and to be taken with the love of the beautiful Son of God. I beseech
you, Madam, in the Lord make now sure work, and see that the old house be
casten down, and razed from the foundation, and that the new building of your
soul be of Christ's own laying; for then wind and storm shall neither loose it,
nor shake it asunder. Many now take Christ by guess: Be sure that it be he, and
only he whom ye have met with: His sweet smell, his lovely voice, his fair
face, his sweet working in the soul will not lie, they will soon tell if it be
Christ indeed [and I think your love to the saints speaks that it is he] and
therefore I say, be sure that ye take Christ himself, and take him with his
father's blessing: his father allows him well upon, you, your lines are well
fallen, it could not have been better, nor so well with you if they had not
fallen in these places: In heaven or out of heaven there is nothing better,
nothing so sweet and excellent as the thing ye have lighted on, and therefore
hold you with Christ: Joy, much joy may ye have of him: But take his cross with
himself cheerfully: Christ and his cross are not separable in this life;
howbeit Christ and his cross part at heaven's door, for there is no house-room
for crosses in heaven: one tear, one sigh, one sad heart, one fear, one loss,
or thought of trouble cannot find lodging there: they are but the marks of
our Lord Jesus down in this wide innes and stormy country on this side of
death: Sorrow and the saints are not married together, of suppose it were so,
heaven shall make a divorce. I find his sweet presence eats out the
bitterness of sorrow and suffering. I think it a sweet thing that Christ says
of my cross Halfmine, and that he divides these sufferings with me and takes
the largest share to himself; nay that I and my whole cross are wholly
Christ's. O what a portion is Christ! O that the saints would dig deeper in the
treasures of his wisdom and excellency! Thus recommending your La: to the
goodwill and tender mercies of our Lord, I rest

Aberd. Sept. 7. 1637 Yours La: in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To ROBERT GORDON. Of Knockbrex. (108)
My very worthy and dear Friend.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: Though all Galloway should have forgotten
me I would have expected a letter from you ere now: But I will not expound it
to be forgetfulness of me. Now, My dear Brother, I cannot show you how matters
go betwixt Christ and me: I find my Lord going and coming seven times a day:
His visits are short, but they are both frequent and sweet. I dare not for my
life think of a challenge of my Lord: I hear ill tales, and hard reports of
Christ from the Tempter and my flesh; but love believes no evil: I may swear
that they are liars, and that apprehensions make lies of Christ's honest and
unalterable love to me. I dare not say that I am a dry tree, or that I have no
room at all in the vineyard; but yet I often think that the sparrows are
blessed who may resort to the house of God in Anwoth, from which I am banished.
Temptations that I supposed to be stricken dead and laid upon their back, rise
again and revive upon me; yea. I see that while I live temptations will not
die: The devil seems to brag and boast as much, as if he had more court with
Christ then I have, and as if he had charmed and blasted my ministry that I
shall do no more good in public; but his wind shakes no corn: I will not
believe Christ would have made such a mint to have me to himself, and have
taken so much pains upon me as he has done, and then slip so easily from
possession, and lose the glory of what he had done; Nay, since I came to
Aberden I have been taken up to see the new land, the fair palace of the Lamb:
And will Christ let me see heaven to break my heart, and never give it to me? I
shall not think my Lord Jesus gives a dumb earnest, or puts his seal^ to
blank paper, or intends to put me off with fair and false promises: I see
that now, which I never saw well before. 1. I see faith's necessity in a fair
day is never known aright; but now I miss nothing so much as faith: Hunger in me
runs to fair and sweet promises, but when I come, I am like a hungry man
that wants teeth, or a weak stomach having a sharp appetite that is filled
with the very sight of meat; or lik one stupefied with cold under the water
that would fain come to land, but cannot grip any thing casten to him: I can
let Christ grip me, but I cannot grip him: I love to be kissed and to sit on
Christ's knee; but I cannot set my feet to the ground, for afflictions bring
the cramp upon my faith: All I dow do is to hold out a lame faith to Christ,
like a beggar holding out a stump in stead of an arm or leg and cry Lord Jesus
work a miracle. O what would I give to have hands and arms to grip strongly and
fold heart somly about Christ's neck, and to have my claim made good with real
possession! I think my love to Christ has feet abundance, and ruinneth swiftly
to be at him, but it wants hands and fingers to apprehend him. I think I
would give Christ every morning my blessing, to have as much faith as I have
love and hunger; at least I miss faith more then love and hunger. 2. I see
mortification, and to be crucified to the world is not so highly accounted of
by us as it should be. O how heavenly a thing is it to be dead and dumb and
deaf to this world's sweet music! I confess it has pleased his Majesty to
make me laugh at children who are wooing this world for their match: I see men
lying about the world, as Nobles about a King's court; and I wonder what they
are a doing there: As I am at this present I would scorn to court such a
feckless and petty Princess, or buy this world's kindness with a bow of my
knee. I scarce now either hear or see what it is that this world offers me; I
know it is little it can take from me, and as little it can give me. I recommend
Mortification to you above any thing: For alas we but chase feathers flying in
the air, and tire our own spirits for the froth and overguilded clay of a dying
life: One sight of what my Lord has let me see within this short time is worth
a world of worlds. 3. I thought courage in the time of trouble for Christ's
sake, a t^ing that I might take up at my foot, I thought the very remembrance
of the honesty of the cause would be enough; but I was a fool in so thinking: I
have much ado now, to win to one smile; but I see joy grows up in heaven,
and it is above our short arm: Christ will be steward and dispenser himself,
and non^ else but He: Therefore, now, I count much of one dram weight of
spiritual joy; one smile of Christ's face, is now to me as a Kingdom, and yet
he is no niggard to me of comforts: Truly I have no cause to say that I am
pinched with penury or that the consolations of Christ are dried up, for he
has poured down rivers upon a dry wilderness the like of me to my admiration:
and in my very swoonings he holds up my head, and stays me with flagons of
wine and comfort me with apples: My house and bed is strowed with kisses of
love. Praise, praise with me. O if ye and I betwixt us could lift up Christ
upon his throne, howbeit all Scotland should cast him down to the ground! My
Brother's case touches me near, I hope ye will be kind to him and give him
your best counsel: Remember my love to your Brother, to your wife and G. M.
desire him to be faithful and repent of his hypocrisy, and say that I wrote
it to you: I wish him salvation: Write to me your mind anent. C. E. And C. Y.
And their wives. and I. G. Or any others in my parish: I fear I am forgotten
amongst them; but I cannot forget them. The prisoner's prayers and blessing
come upon you: Grace, grace be with you.

To my Lord. BALMERINOCH. [109]
My very Noble and truly honorable Lord.
I Make bold to write news to your Lo: from my prison, though your Lo: have
experience more then I can have. At my first entry here, I was not a little
casten down with challenges for old unrepented of sins, and Satan and my own
apprehensions made a lie of Christ, that he had casten a dry withered tree over
the dike of the vineyard; but it was my folly, blessed be his great name the
fire cannot burn the dry tree: He is pleased no^ to feast the exiled prisoner
with his lovely presence, for it suiteth Christ well to be kind, and he dineth
and suppeth with such a sinner as I am. I am in Christ's tutouring here; He
has made me content with a borrowed fireside, and it casts as much heat, as
mine own: I want nothing at all but real possession of Christ: And he has
given me a pawn of that also, which I hope to keep till he come himself to
loose the pawn. I cannot get help to praise his high name: He has made me a
King over my losses, imprisonment, banishment and only my dumb sabbaths stick
in my throat: But I forgive Christ's wisdom in that: I dare not say one word:
He has done it and I will lay my hand upon my mouth: If any other had done it
to me, I could not have born it. Now My Lord, I must tell your Lo: That I would
not give a drink of cold water for this clay idol, this plaistered world. I
testify and give it under mine own hand, that Christ is most worthy to be
suffered for. Our lazy flesh [which would have Christ to cry down crosses by
open proclamation] has but raised a slander upon the cross of Christ. My Lord,
I hope ye i will not forget what he has done for your soul: I think ye are n
Christ's count-book as his obliged debtor. Grace, grace be with your spirit.

To ALEXANDER GORDON. Of Knockgray. (110)
Dear. Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace, be to you: I long to hear how your soul prospers: I
expected letters from you ere now. As for my self I am here in good case, well
feasted with a great King: At my first coming here, I was that bold as to to
take up a jealousy of Christ's love: I said I was cast over the dike of the
Lord's vineyard as a dry tree; but I see if I had been a withered branch, the
fire would have burnt me long ere now: blessed be his high name who has kept
sap in the dry tree: and now as if Christ had done the wrong, he has made the
mends, and has miskent my ravings [for a man under the water cannot well
command his wit, far less his faith and love] because it was a fever, my Lord
Jesus forgave me that among the rest: He knows, in our afflictions we can
find a spot in the fairest face that ever was, even in Christ's face: I would
not have believed that a gloom should have made me to misken my old Master; But
we must be whiles sick: Sickness is but kindly to both faith and Love. But O
how execedingly is a poor dated prisoner obliged to sweet Jesus! My tears are
sweeter to me, then the laughter of the fourteen Prelates to them: The worst of
Christ, even his chaff, is better then the world's corn. Dear Brother, I
beseech you, I charge you in the name and authority of the Son of God, help me
to praise his highness, and I charge you also to tell all your acquaintance,
that my Master may get many thanks. O if my hairs, all my members and all my
bones, were well tuned tongues to sing the high praises of my great and
glorious King! Help me to lift Christ up upon his throne, and to lift him up
above all the thrones of the clay Kings, the dying scepter-bearers of this
world. The prisoner's blessing, the blessing of him that is separated from his
brethren, be upon them all who will lend me a lift in this work: Show this to
that people with you to whom sometimes I preached. Brother, my Lord has
brought me to this, that I will not flatter the world for a drink of water: I
am no debtor to clay, Christ has made me dead to that: I now wonder that ever
I was such a Child long since, as to beg at such beggars: Fie upon us, who woo
such a black skinned harlot; when we may get such a fair, fair match up in
heaven. Oh that I could give up with this clay-idol, this masked painted
overguilded dirt, that Adam's sons adore! We make an idol of our Will: as many
iusts in us as many Gods: We are all God-makers: We are like to lose Christ the
true God in the throng of these new and false Gods. Scotland has cast her
crown off her head: The virgin Daughter has lost her garland: woe, woe to our
harlot mother: Our day is coming, a time when women shall wish they had been
childless, and fathers shall bless miscarrying wombs and dry breasts: many
houses, great and fair, shall be desolate. This Kirk shall sit on the ground
all the night and the tears shall run down her cheeks: The sun has gone down
upon her Prophets: Blessed are the prisoners of hope who can run in to their
strong hold, and hide themselves for a little till the indignation be overpast.
Commend me to your Wife, your Daughters, your Son in law, and to A. T. write to
me of the case of your Kirk. Grace be with you. I am much moved for my Brother,
I entreat for your kindness and counsel to him.

My Very noble and dear Lady.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your La: letter, which has
comforted my soul. God give you to find mercy in the day of Christ. I am in as
good terms and court with Christ, as an exiled oppressed prisoner of Christ
can be: I am still welcome to his house, he knows my knock and lets in a
poor friend: Under this black rough tree of the cross of Christ, he has
ravished me with his love, and taken my heart to heaven with him: well and long
may he bruik it. I would not niffer Christ with all the joys that man or Angel
can devise beside him. Who has such cause to speak honorably of Christ as I
have? Christ is King of all crosses and he has made his saints little Kings
under him, and he can ride and triumph upon weaker bodies then I am [if any can
be weaker] and his horse will neither fall nor stumble. Madam, your La: has
much ado with Christ for your soul, husband, children, and house: Let him
find much employment for his calling with you; for he is such a friend as
delights to be burdened with suits and employments, and the more ye lay on
him and the more homely ye be with him, the more welcome. O the depth of
Christ's love! It has neither brim nor bottom. O if this blind world saw his
beauty! When I count with him for his mercies to me, I must stand still and
wonder and go away as a poor dyvour who has nothing to pay: Free forgiveness
is my payment. I would I could get him set on high, for his love has made me
sick and I die except I get real possession. Grace, grace be with you.

My very dear and worthyfriend.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear of your growing in grace, and
of your advancing in your journey to heaven: It will be the joy of my heart to
hear that ye hold your face up the brae and wade through tentations without
fearing what man can do. Christ shall, when he arises, mow down his enemies
and lay bulks [as they use to speak] on the green and fill the pits with dead
bodies, Psalm. 110: 6. they shall lie like handfulls of withered hay when he
arises to the prey. Salvation, Salvation is the only necessary thing: this
clay-idol, the World, is not to be sought, it is a morsel not for you, but for
hunger-bitten bastards. Contend for Salvation: Your Master Christ, won heaven
with strokes: It is a besieged castle, it must be taken with violence. Oh, this
world thinks heaven but at the next door, and that godliness may sleep in a
bed of downs till it come to heaven; but that will not do it. For my self, I
am as well as Christ's prisoner can be: For by him, I am master and King of all
my crosses; I am above the prison and the lash of men's tongues: Christ
triumphs in me. I have been casten down and heavy with fears and hunted with
challenges, I was swimming in the depths; but Christ had his hand under my chin
all the time and took good heed that I should not lose breath: And now I have
gotten my feet again, and there are love feasts of joy and spring-tides of
consolation betwixt Christ and me: We agree well, I have court with him, I am
still welcome to his house. O my short arms cannot fathom his love! I beseech
you, I charge you help me to praise: Ye have a prisoner's prayers, therefore
forget me not. I desire Sibilla to remember me dearly to all in that Parish who
know Christ, as if I had named them. Grace, grace be with you.

To my very dear Brother WILLIAM LIVINGSTONE. (113)
My very dear Brother.
I Rejoice to hear that Christ has run away with your young love and that ye
are so early in the morning matched with such a Lord; for a young man is often
a dressed lodging for the devil to dwell in: be humble and thankful for grace,
and weigh it not so much by weight as if it be true: Christ will not cast water
on your smoking coal, he never yet put out a dim candle that was lighted at the
sun of righteousness. I recommend to you prayer and watching over the sins of
your youth; for I know missive letters go between the Devil and young blood;
Satan has a friend at court in the heart o^ youth, and there, pride, luxury,
lust, revenge, forgetfulness of God are hired as his agents: happy is your soul
if Christ man the house and take the keys himself and command all [as it
suiteth him full well to rule all where ever he is] keep him and entertain
Christ well, cherish his grace, blow upon your own coal, and let him tutour
you. Now for my self, know I am fully agreed with my Lord: Christ has put the
father and me in other's arms, many a sweet bargain he made before, and he has
made this among the rest. I reign as King over my crosses, I will not flatter a
temptation nor give the Devil a good word, I defy Hell's iron gates: God has
past over my quarrelling of him at my entry here, and now he feeds and
feasteth with me: praise, praise with me and let us exalt his name together.

Aberd. March. 13. 1637. Your brother in Christ, S. R.

To WILLIAM GORDON. of White park. (114)
Worthy Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I long to hear from you: I am here the
Lord's prisoner and patient, handled as softly by my Physician as if I were a
sick man under cure. I was at hard terms with my Lord and pleaded with him; But
I had the worst side: It is a wonder he should have suffered the like of me to
have nicknamed the Son of his love Christ, and to call him a changed Lord who
had forsaken me; but misbelief has never a good word to speak of Christ. The
dross of my cross, gathered a scum of fearsin the fire, doubtings, impatience,
unbelief, challenging of providence as sleeping, and not regarding my sorrow;
but my gold smith Christ was pleased to take off the scum and burn it in the
fire: And blessed be my finer he has made the metal better and furnished new
supply of grace to cause me hold out weight and I hope has not loosed one
grain weight by burning his servant. Now his love in my heart casts a mighty
heat: He knows that the desire I have to be at himself paineth me: I have
sick nights and frequent fits of love-fevers for my welbeloved: Nothing paineth
me now but want of presence: I think it long till day: I challenge time as too
slow in it is pace, that holds my only, only fair one, my love, my
welbeloved from me: O if we were together once! I am like an old crazed ship
that has endured many storms and that would fain be in the lee of the shore,
and fears new storms: I would be that nigh heaven, that the shadow of it
might break the force of the storm and the crazed ship might win to land. My
Lord's s^n casts a heat of love and beam of light on my soul. My blessing
thrice every day upon the sweet cross of Christ: I am not ashamed of my garland
The banished ^inister. [which is the term of Aberden] Love, Love defieth
reproaches: The love of Christ has a croslet of proof on it, and arrows will
not draw blood of it: We are more then conquerours through the blood of him
that has loved us, Romans 8. The devil, and the world they cannot wound the love
of Christ. I am further from yielding to the course of defection then when I
came hither: sufferings blunt not the fiery edge of love: Cast love in the
floods of hell it will swim above: it cares not for the world's busked and
plaistered offers. It has pleased my Lord so to line my heart with the love of
my Lord Jesus, that as if the field were already won, and I on the other side
of time, I laugh at the world's golden pleasures and at this dirtie Idol that
the sons of Adam worship: This worm-eaten God, is that which my soul has
fallen out of love with. Sir, ye were once my hearer: I desire now to hear from
you and your wife: I salute her and your children with blessings: I am glad
that ye are still hand-fasted with Christ: go on in your journey and take the
city by violence: Keep your garments clean: Be clean virgins to your husband
the Lamb: the world shall follow you to heaven's gates; and ye would not wish
it to go in with you: Keep fast Christ's love: Pray for me as I do for you:
the Lord Jesus be with your Spirit.

To Mr GEORGE GILLESPIE. [115]
Reverend and dear Brother.
I Received your letter: as for my case Brother, I bless his glorious name, my
losses are my gain, my prison a palace, and my sadness joyfulness. At my first
entry, my apprehensions wrought so upon my cross, that I bec^me jealouse of the
love of Christ, as being by him thrust out of the vineyard, and I was under
great challenges, [as ordinarily melted gold casts first a drossie scum, and
Satan and our corruption form the first words that the heavy cross speaks and
say ^od is angry. He loves you not.] But our apprehensions are not
cannonicall: they dite lyes' of God and Christ's love; but since my spirit was
settled, and the clay fallen to the bottom of the well, I see better what Christ
was doing: And now my Lord is returned with salvation under his wings, now I
want little of half a heaven, and I find Christ every day so sweet,
comfortable, lovely and Kind, as three things only trouble me. 1. I see not
how to be thankful, or how to get help to praise that royal King who raises
up these that are bowed down. 2. His love paineth me and wounds my soul, so
as I am in a fever for want of real presence. 3. An excessive desire to take
instruments in God's name, that this is Christ and his truth I now suffer for,
yea the apple of the eye of Christ's honor, even the Soveraignity and royal
privileges of our King and lawgiver Christ: and therefore let no man scar at
Christ's cross, or raise an ill report upon him or it; for he bears the
sufferer and it both. I am here troubled with the disputes of the great Doctors
[especially with D. B. in Ceremonial and Arminian controver^^es for all are
corrupt here] but I thank God, with no detriment to the truth, or discredit to
my profession: So then I see that Christ can triumph in a weaker man nor I, and
who can be more weak? But his grace is sufficient for me. Brother remember our
old Covenant, and pray for me, and write to me your case. The Lord Jesus be
with your spirit.

To JOHN MEINE. (116)
Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I wonder ye sent me ^ot an answer to my
last letter; for I stand in need of it: I am still (...) some piece of court
with our great King, whose love would cause a dead man speak and live: whether
my court will continue or not, I cannot well say; but I have his ear frequently
and [to his glory only I speak it] no penury of the love-kisses of the Son of
God: He thinks good to cast apples to me in my prison to play withal; lest I
should think long and faint: I must give over all attempts to fathom the depth
of his love: all I can do is but to stand beside his great love, and look and
wonder: my debts of thankfulness affright me: I fear my Creditor get a
Dyvour-bill and a ragged account: I would be much the better of help: O for
help, and that ye would take notice of my case: Your not writing to me makes
me think ye suppose that I am not to be bemoaned, because he is comfortable;
but I have pain in my unthankfulness, and pain in the feeling of his love,
while I am sick again for real presence, and real possession of Christ; yet
there is no gooked [if I may speak so] nor fond love in Christ: He casts me
down sometimes with challenges for old faults, and I know, he knows well that
sweet comforts are swelling and therefore sorrow must make a vent to the wind:
my dumb sabbaths are undercotting wounds: The condition of this oppressed kirk,
and my brother's case [I thank you and your wife for your kindness to him] hold
my sore smarting and keep my wounds bleeding; but the groundwork stands
sure. Pray for me. Grace be with you. Remember meto your wife.

Aberd. March. 14. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To Mr THOMAS GARVEN. (117)
Reverend and dear Brother.
I Bless you for your letter: it was a shower to the new mowen grass: The Lord
has given you the tongue of the Learned: Be fruitful and humble: It is
possible ye come to my case, or the like; but the water is neither so deep, nor
the stream so strong as it is called: I think my fire is not hot, my water dry
land, my loss rich loss. O if the walls of my prison be high, wide and large,
and the place sweet! No man knows it, no man I say knows it [my Dear
Brother] so well, as he and I, no man can put it down in black and white as my
Lord has sealed it in my heart: My poor stock is grown since I came to
Aberden: And if any had known the wrong I did in being jealous of such an
honest lover as Christ, who witheld not his love from me, they would think the
more of it; but I see he must be above me in mercy: I will never strive with
him: To think to recompense him is folly: If I had as many Angel's tongues as
there have fallen drops of rain since the creation, or as there are leaves of
trees in all the forests of the earth, or stars in the heaven to praise; yet
my Lord Jesus would ever be behind with me: We will never get our accounts
sitted: A pardon must close the reckoning; for his comforts to me in this his
honorable cause, have almost put me beyond the bounds of modesty; howbeit I
will not let every one know what is betwixt us: Love, love [I mean Christ's
love] is the hottest coal that ever I felt: O but the smoke of it be hot! Cast
all the salt sea on it, it will flame, hell cannot quench it: Many, many waters
will not quench love: Christ is turned over to his poor prisoner in a mass and
globe of love: I wonder he should waste so much love upon such a waster as I
am; but he is no waster but abundant in mercy: He has no niggards alms when
he is pleased to give. O that I could invite all the nation to love him! Free
grace is an unknown thing: This world has heard but a bare name of Christ and
no more: There are infinite plyes in his love, that the saints will never win
to unfold: I would it were better known and that Christ got more of his own due
then de does. Brother, ye have chosen the good part who have taken part with
Christ: Ye will see him win the field, and ye shall get part of the spoil when
he divides it: They are but fools who laugh at us; for they see but the
backside of the moon; yet our moonlight it better th^n their twelve-hours-sun:
We have gotten the new heavens and as a pledge of that the bridegroom's
love-ring: The children of the wedding chamber have cause to skip and leap for
joy, for the marriage supper is drawing nigh and we find the fours-hours sweet
and comfortable. O time be not slow! O sun move speedily, and hasten our
banquet? O bridegroom be like a roe, or a young heart upon the mountains! O
welbeloved run fast that we may once meet! Brother, I contain my self for want
of time: Pray for me: I hope to remember you. The goodwill of him who dwelt in
the bush, the tender mercies of God in Christ enrich you: Grace be with you.

Aberd. March 14. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To BETHAIA AIRD. [118]
Worthy Sister.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I know ye desire news from my prison, and
I shall show you news. At my first entry hither, Christ and I agreed not well
upon it: The devil made a plea in the house and I laid the blame upon Christ;
for my heart was fraughted with challenges, and I feared that I was an outcast,
and that I was but a withered tree in the vineyard, and but held the sun off
the good plants with my idle shadow, and therefore my Master had given the evil
servant ^he fields to fend him: Old guiltiness said [as witness] all is true:
My apprehensions were with child of faithless fears, and unbelief put a seal
and Amen to all. I thought my self in a hard case: Some said I had cause to
rejoice that Christ had honored me to be a witness for him: and I said in my
heart these are words of men who see but mine outside and cannot tell if I be a
false witness or not. If Christ had in this matter been as wilful and short as
I was, my faith had gone over the brae and broken it is neck; But we were well
met, a hasty fool and a wise patient and meek Savior: he took no
law-advantage of my folly, but waited on till my ill blood was fallen and my
drumbled and troubled well began to clear: He was never a whit angry at the
feverravings of a poor tempted sinner; but he mercifully forgave, and came (as
it well becomes him) with grace and new comfort to a a sinner, who deserved
the contrary: And now he is content to kiss my black mouth, to put his hand in
mine, and to feed me with as many consolations as would feed ten hungry souls;
Yet I dare not say he is a waster of comforts, for no less would have born me
up, one grain weight less would have casten the balance. Now, who is like to
that royal king crowned in Zion? where will I get a seat for royal Majesty to
set him on? If I could set him as far above the heavens as thousand thousands
of heights devised by men and Angels, I would think him but too low. I pray you
for God's sake, my dear Sister, help me to praise: His love has neither brim
nor bottom: His love is like himself, it pass^th all natural understanding: I
go to fathom it with my arms, but it is, as if a child would take the globe
of sea and land in his two short arms: Blessed and holy is his name. This must
be his truth I now suffer for, for he would not laugh upon a lie, nor be
witness with his comforts to a night-dream. I entreat for your prayers, and the
prayers and blessing of a prisoner of Christ be upon you. Grace be with you.

Aberd. March. 14. 1637. Yours in his s^eet Lord Jesus S. R.

To ALEXANDER GORDON Of Knockgray. (119)
Dear Brother.
I Have not leisure to write to you: Christ's ways were known to you, long
before I [who am but a childe] knew any thing of him. What wrong and violence
the Prelates may by God's permission do unto you for your trial, I know not;
but this I know that your ten days tribulation will end: Contend to the last
breath for Christ. Banishment out of these Kingdoms is determined against me
as I hear; this land dow not bear me: I pray you, recommend my case and bonds
to my brethren and sisters with you: I entrust more of my spiritual comfort to
you and them that way, my dear Brother, then to many in this Kingdom besides. I
hope, ye will not be wanting to Christ's prisoner. Fear nothing, for I assure
you, Alexander Gordon of Knockgray shall win away and get his soul for a prey:
And what can he then want that is worth the having? Your friends are cold [as ye
write] and so are these in whom I trusted much: Our husband does well in
breaking our idols in pieces: dry wells send us to the fountain. My life is not
dear to me, sobeing I may fulfill my course with joy. I fear you must remove if
your new hireling will not bear your discountenancing of him; for the Prelat is
afraid Christ get you, and that he has no will of. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord and Master, S. R.

To JOHN FLEMING, Bailisse of Leith [120]
Worthy and dearly beloved in the Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I received your letter: I wish I could
satisfy your desire in drawing up and framing for you a Christian directory:
But the learned have done it before me more judiciously then I can; especially
Mr Rodgers, Greenhame and Perkins; not withstanding, I shall show you what I
would have been at my self [howbeit I I came always short of my purpose.] 1.
That hours of the day less or more time, for the word and prayer, be given to
God, not sparing the twelfth hour or midday, howbeit it should then be the
shorter time. 2. In the midst of wordly employments, there would be some
thoughts of sin, judgment, death and eternity, with a word or two of
ejaculatory prayer [at least] to God. 3. To beware of wandering of heart in
private prayers. 4. Not to grudge howbeit ye come from prayer without sense or
joy: Down-casting, sense of guiltiness and hunger is often best for us. 5. That
the Lord's day from morning to night be spent always either in private or
public worship. 6. That words be observed, wandering and idle thoughts be
avoided, sudden anger and desire of revenge, even of such as persecute the
truth, be guarded against; for we often mix our zeal with our own wild fire.
7. That known, discovered and revealed sins that are against the conscience be
eshewed as most dangerous preparative, to hardness of heart. 8. That in dealing
with men, faith and truth in covenants and traffiquing be regarded, that we
deal with all men in sincerity, that conscience be made of idle and lying
words, and that our carriage be such as that they who see it, may speak
honorably of our sweet Master and profession. 9. I have been much challenged.
1. For not referring all to God as the last end: That I do not eat, drink,
sleep, journey, speak and think for God. 2. That I have not benefited by good
company, and that I left not some word of conviction even upon natural and
wicked men, as by reproving swearing in them, or because of being a silent
witness to their loose carriage, and because I intended not in all companies to
do good. 3. That the woes and calamities of the Kirk and particular professors
have not moved me. 4. That the reading of the life of David, Paul and the like
when it humbled me, I [coming so far short of their holiness] labored not to
imitate them afar off at least, according to the measure of God's grace. 5.
That unrepented sins of youth were not looked to and lamented for. 6. That
sudden stirrings of pride, lust, revenge, love of honors were not resisted and
mourned for. 7. That my charity was cold. 8. That the experiences I had of
God's hearing me in this and the other Particular, being gathered; yet in a new
trouble I had always [once at least] my faith to seek, as if I were to begin
at A. B. C. Again. 9. That I have not more boldly contradicted the enemies
speaking against the truth, either in public church-meetings, or at tables, or
ordinary conference. 10. That in great troubles I have received false reports
of Christ's love and misbeleeved him in his chastning, whereas the event has
said all was in mercy. 11. Nothing more moves me and weighteth my soul, then
that I could never for my heart in my prosperity, so wrestle in prayer with
God, nor be so dead to the world, so hungry and sick of love for Christ, so
heavenly minded, as when ten stone weight of a heavy cross was upon me. 12.
That the cross extorted vows of new obedience which ease has blown away as
chaff before the wind. 13. That practice was so short and narrow, and light so
long and broad. 14. That death has not been often meditated upon. 15. That I
have not been careful of gaining others to Christ. 16. That my grace and gifts
bring forth little or no thankfulness. There are somethings also whereby I have
been helped: As, 1. I have benefited by riding alone a long journey, in giving
that time to prayer. 2. By abstinence and giving days to God. 3. By praying
for others; for by making an errand to God for them; I have gotten something
for my self. 4. I have been really confirmed in many particulars that God
hears prayers, and therefore I used to pray for any thing of how little
importance soever. 5. He enabled me to make no question that this mocked way,
which is nicknamed, is the only way to heaven. Sir, these and many more
occurrences in your life would be looked unto: and, 1. Thoughts of Atheism
would be watched over as If there be a God in heaven: Which will trouble and
assault the best at some times. 2. Growth in grace would be cared for above all
things, and falling from our first love mourned for. 3. Conscience made of
praying for the enemies who are blinded. Sir, I thank you most kindly for your
care of my brother and me also: I hope it is laid up for you and remembered in
heaven. I am still ashamed with Christ's kindness to such a sinner as I am: He
has left a fire in my heart that hell cannot cast water on to quench or
extinguish it. Help me to praise and pray for me: for ye have a prisoner's
blessing and prayers. Remember my love to your wife. Grace be with you.

Aberd. March. 15. 1367. Yours in Christ Jesus S. R.

To ROBERT GORDON of Knokbrex. (121)
My very dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I thought to have answered your two
letters upon this occasion; though I cannot say all that I would. Your timeous
word [not to delight in the cross, but in him who sweetneth it] came to me in
due time: I find the consolations and off-fallings that follow the cross of
Christ so sweet, that I almost forget my self: my desire and purpose is, when
Christ's honey combs drop, neither to refuse to receive and feed upon his
comforts, nor yet to make joy, my bastard-god, or my new found heaven: But what
shall I say? Christ very often in his sweet comforts comes unsent for, and it
were a sin to close the door upon him: It is not unlawful to love and delight
in Christ's apples, when I am not dottingly wooing, nor eagerly begging kisses:
but when they come clean from the timber [like kindness it self that comes of
it is own accord] then I cannot but laugh upon him, who laugheth upon me: If joy
and comforts came single and alone, without Christ himself, I think I would
send them back again the gate they came, and not make them welcome; But when
the King's train comes, and the King in the midst of the company, O how am I
overjoyed with floods of love! I fear not that too great speats, of love wash
away the growing corn, and loose my plants at the roots: Christ does no skaith
where he comes; but certainly I would wish such spiritual wisdom as to love
the bridegroom better then his gifts, his propines, or drink-money. I would be
further in upon Christ then at his joys; they but stand in the utter side of
Christ: I would wish to be in as a seal on his heart, in where his love and
mercy lodges, beside his heart. My welbeloved has ravished me; but it is done
with consent of parties, and it is allowable enough: But my dear Brother, ere I
part with this subject, I must tell you, [that ye may lift up my King in
praises with me] Christ has been keeping something these fourteen years for
me, that I have now gotten in my heavy days, that I am in for his name sake;
even an opened coffer of perfumed comforts and fresh joys coming new, and
green, and powerful from the fairest, fairest face of Christ my Lord. Let the
sour law, let crosses, let hell be cried down: Love, love has shamed me from
my old ways. Whether I have a race to run or some work ado, I see not; but I
think, Christ seems to leave heaven [to say so] and his court, and come down
to laugh and play and sport with a daft bairn. I am not this plain with many I
write to: It is possible I be misconstructed and deemed to seek a name; but my
witness above knows, I seek to have a good name raised upon Christ. I observe
it to be our folly, to seek little from Christ; because our four-hours may not
be our supper: nor our propine sent by the Bridegroom our tocher-good; nor our
earnest our principal sum: But I trow few of us know how much may be had of
Christ for a four-hours and a propine and earnest: We are like the young heir
who knows not the whole bounds of his own Lordship. Certainly it is more then
my part to say, O sweetest Lord Jesus, what ho^ beit I were split and broken in
five thousand sheards or bits of clay, so being every sheard ^ad a heart to
love thee, and every one as many tongues as there are stars in heaven to sing
praises to thee, before man and angel for evermore? Therefore if my sufferings
cry goodness, and praise, and honor upon Christ, my stipend is well paid.
Each one knows not what a life Christ's love is: Scar not at suffering for
Christ, for Christ has a chair and a cushion and sweet peace for a sufferer:
Christ's trencher from the first mess of the high-table is for a sinful
witness. O then Brother, who but Christ! Who but Christ? Hold your tongue of
lovers where he comes out! O all flesh, O dust and ashes, O Angels, O
glorified spirits, O all the shields of the world, be silent before him, come
hither and behold our Bridegroom, stand still and wonder for evermore at him!
Why cease we to love and wonder, to kiss and adore him? It is a hard matter
that days lie betwixt me and him and hold us asunder. O how long, how long! O
how many miles are there to my Bridegroom's dwelling house! It is a pain to
frist Christ's love any longer: But it may be a drunken man lose his feet and
miss a step. Ye write to me, hall bi^ks are slippery: I do not think my dating
world will still last, and that feasts will be my ordinary food: I would have
humlity, patience and faith, to set down both my feet when I come to the
north-side of the cold and thorny hill. It is ill my common to be swier to go
an errand for Christ, and to take the wind upon my face for him. Lord, let me
never be a false witness to deny that I saw Christ take the pen in his hand and
subscribe my writes. My Dear Brother, ye complain to me ye cannot hold sight of
me; but were I a footman I should go at leisure, but sometimes the King takes
me into his coach, and draws me; and then I ontrun myself; but alas I am
still a forlorn transgressour: O how unthankful! I will not put you off your
sense of deadness, but let me say this, who gave you Proctor-fee, to speak for
the law, that can speak for it self, better then ye can do? I would not have
you to bring your dittay in your own bosom with you to Christ: Let the old man
and the new man be summoned before Christ's white throne, and let them be
confronted before Christ, and let each one of them speak for themselves: I hope
howbeit the new man complain of his lying among the pots, which makes the
believer look black; yet he can say also, I am comely as the tents of Kedar: Ye
shall not have my advice not to bemoan your deadness: but I find by some
experience [which ye knew before I knew Christ] it suiteth not a ransomed man
of Christ's buying, to go and plea for the sour law, our old forecaste^
husband; for we are now not under the law [as a covenant] but under grace: Ye
are in no man's common but Christ's: I know he bemoaneth you more then ye do
your self: I say this, because I am wearied of complaining. I thought it had
been humility to imagine that Christ was angry with me, both because of my dumb
sabbaths and my hard heart, but I feel now nothing but aching wounds: my grief
whether I will or not swells upon me: But let us die in Grace's hall-floor
pleading before Christ: I deny nothing that the Mediator will challenge me of;
but I turn it all back upon himself: Let him look his own old counts if he be
angry, for he will get no more of me: when Christ says I want Repentance: I
meet him with this, True Lord; but thou art made a King and Prince to give me
Repentance Act. 5^ 31. When Christ binds a challenge upon us, we must bind a
promise back upon him: Be woe and lay your self in the dust before God [which
is suitable] but withal let Christ take payment in his own hand, and pay
himself, off the first end of his own merits; else he will come behind for any
thing we can do. I am every way in your case, as hard hearted and dead as any
man; but yet I speak to Christ through my sleep: Let us then proclaim a free
market for Christ and swear our selves bare, and desire, and cry on him to come
without money and buy us, and take us home to our ransom-payer's fireside, and
let us be Christ's free-boarders: because we dow not pay the old, we may not
refuse to take on Christ's new debt of mercy: Let us do our best, Christ will
still be behind with us, and many terms will run together: For my part let me
stand for evermore in his book for a forlorn Dyvour: I must desire to be this
far in his common of new, as to desire to kiss his feet: I know not how to win
to a heartsom fill and feast of Christ's love; for I dow neither buy, nor beg,
nor borrow: and yet I cannot want it: I dow not want it. O if I could praise
him! yea I would rest content with a heart submissive and dying of love for
him; and howbeit I won never personally in at heaven's gates; O would to God I
could send in my praises to my incomparable welbeloved, or cast my love-songs
of that matchless Lord Jesus over the walls, that they might light in his lap
before men and Angels! Now, grace, grace be with you. Remember my love to your
wife and daughter and brother John.

Aberd. June. 11. 1638. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To ALEXANDER GORDON, Of Earlestown. (122)
Much honored and worthy Sir.
GRace, Mercy and peace be unto you: I long to hear from you: I received few
letters since I came hither: I am in need of a word: A dry plant would have
some watering: My case betwixt Christ my Lord and me stands between love and
jealousy, faith and suspicion of his love: It is a marvel he keeps house
with me: I make many pleas with Christ, but he makes as many agreements with
me: I think his unchangeable love has said, I defy thee to break me and
change me: If Christ had such changeable and new thoughts of my salvation as I
have of it, I think I should then be at a sad loss: He humoureth not a fool
like me in my unbelief, but rebukes me and ^athereth kindness upon me: Christ
is rather like the poor friend and needy prisoner [begging love] then I am: I
cannot for shame get Christ said Nay of my whole love; for he will not want his
errand for the seeking: God be thanked my bridegroom tireth not of wooing:
Honor to him he is a wilful suitor of my soul: But as love is his, pain is
mine that I have nothing to give him: His count-book is full of my debts of
mercy, kindness and free love toward me: Oh that I might read with watery
eyes! O that he would give me the interest of interest to pay back! Or rather
my soul's desire is, that he would comprize my person, soul and body, love,
joy, [confidence, fear, sorrow and desire, and drive the Puynd, and let me be
rouped, and sold to Christ, and taken home to my creditor's house and his
fireside. The Lord knows, if I could, I would sell my self without reversion
to Christ. O sweet Lord Jesus make a market, and over-bid all my buyers! I dare
swear there is a Mystery in Christ which I never saw: A mystery of love. O if
he would lay by the lap of the covering that is over it, and let my griening
soul see it! I would break the door and be in upon him, to get an wombfull of
love; for I am an hungered and ^amished soul. Oh Sir, if ye or any other would
tell him, how sick my soul is, dying for want of a hearty draught of Christ's
love. Oh if I could dote [if I may make use of that word in this case] as much
upon himself as I do upon his love: It is a pity that Christ himself, should
not rather be my heart's choice then Christ's manifested love: It would
satisfy me in some measure, if I had any bud to give for his love; shall I
offer him my praises? Alas he is more then praises! I give it over to get him
exalted according to his worth, which is above what can be known; yet all this
time I am te^pting him to see if there be both love and anger in him against
me. I am plucked from his flock [dear to me] and from feeding his lambs: I go
therefore in sackcloth as one who has lost the wife of his youth: Grief and
sorrow are suspicious and spue out against him the smoke of jealousies, and I
say often, Show me wherefore thou contendest with me? Tell me Lord, read the
process against me: but I know I cannot answer his alleagance: I will lose the
cause when it comes to open pleading. Oh if I could force my heart to believe
dreams to be dreams! Yet when Christ gives my fears the lie and says to me
thou art a liar, then I am glad. I resolve to hope to be quiet and to lie on
the brink upon my side, till the water fall and the foord be ridable, and
howbeit there be pain upon me in longing for deliverance, that I may speak of
him in the great congregation; yet I think there is joy in that pain and on
waiting: and I even rejoice that he puts me off for a time and shifteth me:
Oh if I could wait on for all eternity, howbeit I should never get my soul's
desire, sobeing he were glorified! I would wish my pain and my ministry could
live long to serve him, for I know I am a clay vessel and made for his use. O
if my very broken sheards could serve to glorify him! I desire Christ's grace
to be willingly content, that my hell [excepting his hatred and displeasure,
which I put out of all play [for submission to this is not called for] were a
preaching of his glory to men and Angels for ever and ever! When all is done
what can I add to him? or what can such a clay-shadow as I do? I know he
needs not me: I have cause to be grieved and to melt away in tears [if I had
grace to do it, Lord grant it to me] to see my welbeloved's fair face spitted
upon by dogs, to see lowns pulling the crown off my royal King's head, to see
my harlot-mother and my sweet father agree so ill, that they are going to skail
and give up house: My Lord's palace is now a nest of unclean birds. Oh if
harlot, harlot Scotland would rue upon her provoked Lord; and pity her good
husband, who is broken with her whorish heart! But these things are hid from
her eyes. I have heard of late of your new trial by the Bishop of Galloway:
Fear not clay and worm's meat: Let Truth and Christ get no wrong in your hand:
it is your gain, if Christ be glorified, and your glory to be Christ's witness:
I persuade you, your sufferings are Christ's advantage and victory; for he is
pleased to reckon them so. Let me hear from you: Christ is but winning a clean
Kirk out of the fire: He will win this play: He will not be in your common for
any charges ye are at in his service: He is not poor to sit in your debt: He
will repay an hundred fold more, it may be even in this life. The prayers and
blessing of Christ's prisoner be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your Brother in his sweet Lord. Jesus, S. R.

To his Reverend and loving Brother. Mr JOHN NEVAY. (123)
Reverend and Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I received yours o^^ Aprile 11. As I did
another of March 25. and a letter for Mr Andrew Cant. I am not a little grieved
that our mother church is running so quickly to the brothel-house, and that we
are hiring lovers, and giving gift; to the great mother of fornications: Alas
that our husband is like to quite us so shortly! It were my part [if I were
able] when our husband is departing, to stir up myself to take hold of him and
keep him in this land; for I know him to be a sweet second, and a lovely
companion to a poor prisoner: I find my extremity has sharpened the edge of
his love and Kindness, so as he seems to devise new ways of expressing the
sweetness of his love to my soul: Suffering for Christ is the very element
wherein Christ's love lives, and exercises it self, in casting out flames of
fire and sparks of heat, to warm such a frozen heart as I have: And if Christ
weeping in sackeloth be so sweet, I cannot find any imaginable thoughts to
think what he will be, when we clay-bodies [having put off mortality] shall
come up to the marriage-hall, and great Palace, and behold the King clothed in
his robes royal, sitting on his throne. I would desire no more for my heaven
beneath the moon, while I am sighing in this house of clay, but daily renewed
feasts of love with Christ, and liberty now and then to feed my hunger with a
kiss of that fairest face, that is like the sun in his strength at noonday. I
would willingly subscribe an ample resignation to Christ of the fourteen
Prelacies of this land, and of all the most delightful pleasures on earth, and
forfeit my part of this clay-God, this earth which Adam's foolish children
worship, to have no other exercise but to lie in a love-bed with Christ, and
fill this hungered, and famished soul with kissing, embracing and real enjoying
of the Son of God: And I think then I might write to my friends. That I had
found the golden world, and look out and laugh at the poor bodies who are
slaying one another for feathers: For verily, Brother, since I came to his
prison I have conceived a new and extraordinary opinion of Christ which I had
not before; for I perceive we frist all our joys to Christ, till he and we be
in our own house above, as married parties; thinking that there is nothing of
it here to be sought or found, but only hope and fair promises: and that
Christ will give us nothing here but tears, sadness, crosses: and that we shall
never feel the smell of the flowers of that high garden of Paradise above, till
we come there: Nay, but I find it is possible to find young glory and a young
green Paradise of joy even here: I know Christ's kisses will cast a more strong
and refreshfull smell of incomparable glory and joy in heaven; then they do
here: Because a drink of the well of life up at the wel^'s head, is more sweet
and fresh by far, then that which we get in our borrowed, old, running-out
vessels and our wooden dishes here; yet I am now persuaded it is our folly to
f^^st all, till the term day; seeing abundance of earnest, will not diminish
any thing of our principal sum: We dream of hunger in Christ's house while we
are here, although he allows feasts upon all the bairns within God's
household: It were good then to store our selves with more borrowed kisses of
Christ, and with more borrowed visites till we enter Heirs to our new
inheritance, and our Tutour put us in possession of our own, when we are past
minority. Oh that all the young heirs would seek more and a greater and a
nearer communion with my Lord-tutour, the prime heir of all, Christ! I wish for
my part I could send you and that gentleman, who wrote his commendations to me,
in to the kings innermost cellar and house of wine, to be filled with love: A
drink of this love is worth the having indeed: We carry our selves but too too
nicely with Christ our Lord, and our Lord loves not niceness and dryness and
uncouthness in friends: Since need force we must be in Christ's common, then
let us be in his common; for it will be no otherwise. Now for my present case
in my imprisonment, deliverance [for any appearance I see] looks cold like:
My hope if it looked to or leaned upon men, should wither soon at the root like
a May-flower: Yet I resolve to ease my self with on-waiting on my Lord, and to
let my faith swim where it loses ground: I am under a necessity either
offainting [which I hope my master of whom boast all the day shall avert] or
then to ^ay my faith upon omnipotency, and to wink and stick by my grip: And I
hope my ship shall ride it out, seeing Christ is willing to blow his sweet wind
in my sails and mendeth and closes the leks in my ship, and rules all: It
will be strange if a believing passenger be casten ^ver beard. As for your
Master, My Lord and my Lady I will be loath to forget them: I think my prayers
[such as they are] are due debt to him, and I shall be fa^ more engaged to his
Lo: if he be fast for Christ (as I hope he will) now when so many of his coat
and quality slip from Christ's back and leave him to send for himself. I
entreat you remember my love to that woe thy Gentleman A. C. who salated me in
your letter: I have heard that he is one of my Master's friends, for the which
cause I am tied to him: I wish he may more and more fall in love with Christ.
Now for your question as far as I rawly conceive: I think God is praised two
ways: First, by a concional profession of his highness before men, such as is
the very hearing of the word, and receiving of either of the Sacraments, in
which acts by profession, we give out to men, that he is our God, with whom we
are in covenant, and our Lawgiver: Thus eating and drinking in the Lord's
supper, is an annunciation and profession before men, that Christ is our slain
Redeemer: Here because God speaks to us, not we to him, it is not a formal
thanks giving; but an annunciation, or predication of Christ's death,
concionall, not adorative; neither has it God for the immediate object, and
therefore no kneeling can be here. Secondly, there is another praising of God,
formal, when we are either formally blessing God, or speaking his praises: And
this I take to be twofold: 1. When we directly and formally direct praises and
thanksgiving to God: This may well be done kneeling in token of our
recognizance of his highness; yet not so, but it may be standing or sitting,
especially seeing joyful elevation [which should be in praising] is not
formally signified by kneeling. 2. When we speak good of God, and declare his
glorious nature and attributes, extolling him before men, to excite men to
conceive highly of him: The former I hold to be worship every way immediate,
else I know not any immediate worship at all: the latter has God for the
subject, not properly the object, seeing the predication is directed to men
immediately, rather then to God; for here we speak of God by way of praising,
rather then to God: And for my own part, as I am for the present minded, I see
not how this can be done kneeling seeing it is praedicatio Dei and Christ^, non
laudatio aut benedictio Dei: But observe that it is formal praising of God and
not merely concional, as I distinguished in the first member: for in the first
member any speaking of God or of his works of creation, providence and
redemption, is indirect and concional praising of him, and formally preaching
or an act of teaching, not an act of predication of his praises; for there is a
difference betwixt the simple relation of the virtues of a thing, which is
formally teaching, and the extolling of the worth of a thing by way of
commendation, to cause others to praise with us. Thus recommending you to God's
grace, I rest.

Aberd. June. 15. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To Mr J. R. (124.)
Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: upon the report I hear of you [without any
further acquaintance except our straitest bonds in our Lord Jesus] I thought
good to write unto you, hearing of your danger to be thrust out of the Lord's
house for his name sake: Therefore my earnest and humble desire to God is, that
ye may be strengthened in the grace of God, and by the power of his might to go
on for Christ, not standing in aw of a worm that shall die. I hope ye will not
put your hand to the ark to give it a wrong totch and to overturn it, as many
now do, when the archers are shooting sore at Joseph, whose bow shall abide
in it is strength: We ow to our royal King and Princely Master a testimony. O
how blessed are they who can ward a blow off Christ and his born-down truth!
Men think Christ a gone man now, and that he shall never get up his head again:
And they believe his court is failed, because he suffers men to break their
spears and swords upon him, and the enemies to plow Sion, and make long and
deep their furrows on her back: But it would not be so, if the Lord had not a
sowing for his plowing: What can he do, but melt an old drossie Kirk, that he
may bring out a new bride out of the fire again (...) I think Christ is just
now reparing his house, and exchanging his old vessels with new vessels, and is
going through this land and taking up an inventure and a roll of so many of
Levi's sons and good Professors, that he may make them new work for the second
temple: And whatsoever shall be found, not to be for the work shall be casten
over the wall: When the house shall be builded, he shall lay by his hammers as
having no more to do with them: It is possible he do worse to them then lay
them by: and I think the vengeance of the Lord and the vengeance of his temple
shall be upon them: I desire no more but to keep weight when I am past the
fire: and I can now in some weak measure give Christ a testimonial of a lovely
and loving companion under suffering for him. I saw him before but afar off;
his beauty to my eye's sight grows: a fig, a straw for ten worlds plaistered
glory and for childish shadows: The idol of clay [this God, the world] that
fools fight for. If I had a lease of Christ of my own dating [for whoever once
comes nigh hand and takes a hearty look of Christ's inner side, shall never
wring nor wrestle themselves out of his love-grips again] I would rest
contented in my prison; yea in a prison without light of sun or candle,
providing Christ and I had a love-bed, not of mine but of Christ his own
making; that we might lie together among the lilies, till the day break and the
shadows flee away. Who knows how sweet a drink of Christ's love is? O but to
live on Christ's love is a King's life! The worst things of Christ even that
which seems to be the refuse of Christ, his hard cross, his black cross, is
white and fair: and the cross receives a beautiful luster and a perfumed
smell from Jesus, Mydear Brother, scar not at it. While ye have time to stand
upon the watch tower and to speak, contend with this land, plead with your
harlot-mother, who has been a treacherous half-marrow to her husband Jesus:
For I would think liberty to preach one day, the root and top of my desires,
and would seek no more of the blessings that are to be had on this side of
time, till I be over the water; but to spend this my crazed clay-house in his
service and saving of souls: But I hold my peace because he has done it: my
shallow and ebb thoughts are not the compass Christ saileth by: I leave his
ways to himself for they are far, far above me: Only I would contend with
Christ for his love and be bold to make a plea with Jesus my Lord for a
heart-fill of his love; for there is no more left to me. What stands beyond
the far end of my sufferings, and what shall be the event he knows, and I
hope to my joy shall make me know, when God shall unfold his decrees concerning
me; for there are windings and too's and fro's in his ways which blind bodies
like us cannot see. This much for further acquaintance: So recommending you and
what is before you to the grace of God, I rest.

Aberd. June 16. 1637. Your very loving Brother in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To Mr WILLIAM DALGLEISH. (125)
Reverend and welbeloved Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be unto you: I have heard somewhat of your trials in
Galloway: I bless the Lord who has begun first in that corner to make you a
new Kirk to himself: Christ has the less ado behind, when he has refined
you. Let me entreat you, my dearly beloved, to be fast to Christ: My witness is
above, My dearest Brother, that ye have added much joy to me in my bonds, when
I hear that ye grow in the grace and zeal of God for your Master. Our ministry
whether by preaching or suffering, will cast a smell through the world both of
heaven and hell, 2 Cor. 2: 15, 16. I persuade you, my dear Brother, there is
nothing out of heaven, next to Christ, dearer to me then my ministry, and the
worth of it in my estimation is swelled and paineth me exceedingly; yet I am
content for the honor of my Lord, to surrender it back again to the Lord of
the vineyard: let him do with me and it both what he thinks good: I think my
self too little for him: and let me speak to you, how kind a fellow prisoner
is Christ to me! Believe me, this kind of cross [that would not go by my
door, but would needs visit me,] is still the longer the more welcome to me:
It Is true my silent sabbaths have been and are still as glassy ye, whereon my
faith can scarce hold it is feet, and I am often blown on my back, and off my
feet, with a storm of doubting; yet truly my bonds all this time cast a mighty
and rank smell of high and deep love in Christ: I cannot indeed see through my
cross to the far end; Yet I believe I am in Christ's books, and in his decree
[not yet unfolded to me] a man triumphing, dancing and singing over on the
other side of the red sea, and laughing and praising the lamb over beyond time,
sorrow, deprivation, prelat's indignation, losses, want of friends and death:
Heaven is not a foul flying in the air (as men use to speak of things that are
uncertain) nay it is well paid for, Christ's comprizement lies on Glory, for
all the mourners in Zion, and shall never be loosed: Let us be glad and rejoice
that we have blood, losses, and wounds to show our Master and Captain at his
appearance, and what we suffered for his cause. Woe is me, my dear Brother,
that I say often I am but dry bones, which my Lord will not bring out of the
grave again, and that my faithless fears say, Oh I am a dry tree that can bear
no fruit, I am an useless body who ^an beget no children to the Lord in his
house. Hopes of deliverance look cold and uncertain and afar off, as if I had
done with it: it is much for Christ [if I may say so] to get Lawborrows of my
sorrow, and of my quarrelous heart: Christ's love plays me fair play, I am
not wronged at all; but there is a tricking and false heart within me, that
still plays Christ foul play: I am a cumbersom neighbor to Christ: It is a
wonder that he dwells beside the like of me; yet I often get the advantage of
the hill above my temptations, and then I despise the temptation, even hell it
self and the stink of it, and the instruments of it, and am proud of my
honorable Master: And I resolve whether contrary winds will or not to fetch
Christ's harbor: and I think a wilful and stiff contention with my Lord
Jesus for his love very lawful: it is sometimes hard to me to win my meat upon
Christ's love, because my faith is sick, and my hope withers, and my eyes wax
dim, and unkind and comfort-eclipsing clouds go over the fair, and bright,
and light S^n-Jesus: And then when I and my temptation tryste the matter
together, we spill all through unbelief: Sweet, sweet for evermore would my
life be, if I could keep faith in exercise: But I see my fire cannot always
cast light. I have even a poor man's hard world, when he goes away: But surely
since my entry hither, many a time has my fair sun shined without a cloud: Hot
and burning has Christ's love been to me: I have no vent to the expression of
it: I must be content with stolen and smothered desires of Christ's glory: O how
far is his love behind the hand with me! I am just like a man, who has
nothing to pay his thousands of debt: All that can be gotten of him is to se^^e
upon his person: Except Christ would se^^e upon my self, and make the readiest
payment that can be of my heart and love to himself, I have no other thing to
give him: If my sufferings could do beholders good, and edify his Kirk, and
proclaim the incomparable worth of Christ's love to the world, O then how would
my soul be overjoyed, and my sad heart cheered and calmed! Dear Brother, I
cannot tell what is become of my labors among that people: If all that my Lord
builded by me be casten down, and the bottom fallen out of the profession of
that parish, and none stand by Christ, whose love I once preached, as clearly
and plainly as I could [though far below it is worth and excellency] to that
people; if so, how can I bear it? and If another make a foul harvest where I
have made a painful and honest sowing, it will not soon digest with me: but I
know his ways pass finding out: Yet my witness both within me and above me
knows, and my pained breast upon the Lord's day at night, my desire to have
had Christ awful and amiable and sweet to that people, is now my joy: and it
was my desire and aim to make Christ and them one: If I see my hopes die in
the bud ere they bloom a little, and come to no fruit I die with grief. O my
God seek not an account of the violence done to me by my brethren; whose
salvation I love and desire: I pray that they and I be not heard as contrary
parties in the day of our compearance before our judge, in that process led by
them against my ministry, which I received from Christ: I know a little inch,
and less then the third part of this span-length and handbreadth of time which
is posting away will put me without the stroke and above the reach of either
brethren or foes: And it is a short-lasting injury done to me and to my pains
in that part of my Lord's vineyard: O how silly an advantage is my deprivation
to men, seeing my Lord Jesus has many ways to recover his own losses, and is
irresistible to compass his own glorious ends, that his lilie may grow amongst
thorns, and his little Kingdom exalt it self, even under the swords and spears
of contrary powers! But, my dear Brother, go on in the strength of his rich
grace whom ye serve: Stand fast for Christ: Deliver the Gospel off your hand,
and your ministry to your Master with a clean and undefiled conscience: Loose
not a pin of Christ's tabernacle: Do not so much as pick with your nail at
one board or border of the ark: Have no part or dealing upon any terms, in a
hoof, in a closed window, or in a bowing of your ^nce, in casting down of the
temple: But be a mourning and speaking witness again them who now ruin Zion.
Our Master will be on us all in a clap ere ever we wit: That day will discover
all our white's and our black's concerning this controversy of poor oppressed
Zion: Let us make our part of it good, that it may be able to abide the fire
when hay and stuble shall be burnt to ashes: Nothing, nothing [I say nothing]
but sound sanctification can abide the Lord's fan: I stand to my testimony that
I preached often of Scotland: Lamentation, mourning and woe abides th^^ O
Scotland: O Scotland, the fearful quarrel of a broken Covenant stands good
with thy Lord. Now, remember my love to all friends, and to all my parishoners
as if I named each one of them particularly: I recommend you and God's people
committed by Christ to your trust, to the rich grace of our alsufficient Lord.
Remember my bonds: Praise my Lord who bears me up in my sufferings: As ye
sinde occasion [accorcording to the wisdom given you] show our acquaintance
what the Lord has done to my soul: This I seek not verily to hunt my own
praise, but that my sweetest and dearest Master may be magnified in my
sufferings I rest.

Aberd. June 17. 1637. Your brother in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To MARION MCKNAUGHT. (126)
Dearly beloved in our Lord Jesus Christ.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Few know the heart of a stranger and
prisoner, I am in the hands of mine enemies: I would honest and lawful means
were essayed for bringing me home to my charge, now when Mr A. R. and Mr H. R.
are restored. It concerns you of Galloway most to use supplications and
addresses for this purpose, and try if by fair means I can be brought back
again: As for liberty, without I be restored to my flock, it is little to me,
for my silence is my greatest prison: However it b^, I wait for the Lord, I
hope not to rot in my sufferings: Lord give me submission to wait on my heart
is sad that my days flee away and I do no service to my Lord in his house,
now when his harvest and the souls of perishing people require it; but his ways
are not like my ways, neither can I find him out. O that he would shine upon
my darkness, and bring forth my morning light from under the thick cloud, that
men have spread over me! O that the Almighty would lay my cause in a balance
and weigh me, if my soul was not taken up, when others were sleeping, how to
have Christ betrothed with a Bride in that part of the land! but that day that
my mouth was most unjustly and cruelly closed, the bloom fell off my branches,
and my joy did cast the flower; How beit I have been casting my self under
Christ's feet, and wrestling to believe under a hidden and covered Lord; yet my
fainting comes before I eat, and my faith has bowed with the sore cast and
under this almost insupportable weight: O that it break not! I dare not say
that the Lord has put out my candle, and has casten water upon my poor coal,
and broken the stakes of my tabernacle; But I have tasted bitterness and eaten
gall and wormwood since that day, my Master laid bonds upon me to speak no
more: I speak not this because the Lord is uncouth to me, but because beholders
that stand on dry land see not my sea-storm: The witnesses of my cross are but
strangers to my sad days and nights. O that Christ would let me alone and
speak love to me and come home to me and bring summer with him! O that I might
preach his beauty and glory as once I did, before my clay-tent be removed to
darkness, and that I might lift Christ off the ground and my branches might be
watered with the dew of God, and my joy in his work might grow green again and
bud and send out a flower! But I am but a short sighted creature and my candle
casts not light afar off: He knows all that is done to me, how that when I
had but one joy and no more, and one green flower that I esteemed to be my
garland, he came in one hour and dried up my flower at the root, and took away
mine only eye, and mine only one crown and garland: What can I say? Surely my
guiltiness has been remembered before him, and he was seeking to take down my
sails and to land the flower of my delights, and to let it lie on the coast
like an old broken ship that is no more for the sea: But I praise him for this
wailed stroke, I welcome this surnace, God's wisdom made choice of it for me,
and it must be best because it was his choice. O that I may wait for him till
the morning of this benighted Kirk break out! This poor afflicted Kirk had a
fair morning; but her night came upon her before her noonday, and she was like
a traveller forced to take house in the morning of his journey: and now her
adversaries are the chief men in the land, her ways mourn, her gates languish,
her children sigh for bread, and there is none to be instant with the Lord,
that he would come again to his house and dry the face of his weeping spouse
and comfort Zion's mourners, who are waiting for him: I know, he shall make
corn to grow upon the top of his withered mount Zion again. Remember my bonds
and forget me not: Oh that my Lord would bring me again amongst you with
abundance of the Gospel of Christ! But O that I may set down my desires where
my Lord bids me! Remember my love in the Lord to your husband, God make him
faithful to Christ, and my blessing to your three children. Faint not in
prayer for this Kirk: Desire my people not to receive a stranger and intruder
upon my ministry: let me stand in that right and station that my Lord Jesus
gave me. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord and Master, S. R.

To JOHN GORDON. At Risco. (127)
Dear Brother.
I Earnestly desire to know the case of your soul, and to understand that ye
have made sure work of heaven and salvation. 1. Remember, Salvation is one of
Christ's dainties he gives but to a few. 2. That it is violent sweating and
striving that takes heaven. 3. That it cost Christ blood to purchase that
house to sinners and to set mankind down, the King's free tenants and
freeholders. 4. That many make a start toward heaven who fall on their back
and win not up to the top of the mount, it plucketh heart and legs from them,
and they sit down and give it over, because the devil sets a sweet smelled
flower to their nose [this fair busked World] wherewith they are bewitched and
so forget or refuse to go forward. 5. Remember, many go far on and reform
many things and can find tears as Esau did, and suffer hunger for the truth as
Judas did, and wish and desire the end of the righteous as Balaam did, and
profess fair and fight for the Lord as Saul did, and desire the saints of God
to pray for them as Pharaoh and Simon Magus did, and prophecy and speak of
Christ as Caiaphas did, walk softly and mourn for fear of judgment as Ahab
did, and put away gross sins and idolatry as Iehu did, and hear the word of God
gladly and reform their life in many things according to the word as Herod did,
and say, Master, to Christ, I will follow thee whither soever thou go, as
the man who offered to be Christ's servant, Math. 8. and may taste of the
virtues of the life to come and be partaker of the wonderful gifts of the holy
spirit and taste of the good word of God, as the Apostates who sin against the
Holy Ghost, Heb 6. and yet all these are but like gold in clink and color and
watered brass and base metal. These are written that we should try our selves
and not rest till we be a step nearer Christ then sunburned and withering
professors can come, 6. Consider, it is impossible that your Idol-sins and ye,
can go to heaven together, and that they who will not part with these, can
indeed love Christ at the bottom; but only in word and show: which will not
do the business. 7. Remember how swiftly God's post, time, flies away, and
that your forenoon is already spent, your afternoon will come and then your
evening and at last night, When ye cannot see to work: let your heart be set
upon finishing of your journey, and summing and laying your accounts with your
Lord. O how blessed shall ye be, to have a joyful welcome of your Lord at
night! How blessed are they who in time take sure course with their soul! Bless
his great name for what ye possess in goods and children, ease and worldly
contentment, that he has given you; and seek to be like Christ in humility and
lowliness of mind, and be not great and entire with the world: make it not
your God nor your lover that ye trust into; for it will deceive you: I
recommend Christ and his love to you in all things, let him have the flower of
your heart and your love, set a low price upon all things but Christ, and cry
down in your thoughts clay and dirt that will not comfort you, when ye get
summonds to remove, and compear before your Judge, to answer for all the deeds
done in the body. The Lord give you wisdom in all things: I beseech you
sanctify God in your speaking, for holy and reverend is his name: and be
temperate and sober, companionry [as it is called] is a sin that holds men
out of heaven. I will not believe that ye will receive the ministry of a
stranger, who will preach a new and uncouth doctrine to you: Let my salvation
stand for it, if I delivered not the plain and whole counsel of God to you in
his word. Read this letter to your wife, and remember my love to her, and
request her to take heed to do what I write to you: I pray for you and yours.
Remember me in your prayers to our Lord, that he would be pleased to send me
amongst you again. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your lawful and loving Pastor, S. R.

To Mr HUGH HENDERSON. (128)
Reverend and dear Brother.
WHo knows but the wind may turn in to the West again upon Christ and his
desolate bride in this land? And that Christ may get his summer by course
again; for he has had ill weather this long time, and could not find law or
justice for himself and his truth these many years. I am sure, the wheels of
this crazed and broken Kirk run all upon no other axel-tree, nor is there any
other to roll them, and cogge them, and drive them, but the wisdom and good
pleasure of our Lord: And it were a just trick and glorious, of never-sleeping
providence, to bring our brethrens darts they have shot at us, back upon their
own heads: Suppose they have two strings in their bow, and can take one as
another saileth them, yet there are more then three strings upon our Lord's
bow; and besides he cannot miss the white that he shoots at. I know, he
shuffleth up and down in his hand the great body of heaven and earth, and that
Kirk and Commonwealth are in his hand, like a stock of Cards, and that he
deals ^he play to the mourners in Zion and these that say, lie down, that we
may go over you, at his own sovereign pleasure: And I am sure, Zion's
adversaries in this play shall not take up their own stakes again. O how sweet
a thing it is to trust in him! When Christ has sleeped out his sleep [if I may
speak so of him who is the watchman of Israel that neither slumbereth nor
sleepeth] and his own are tried, he will arise as a strong man after wine, and
make bare his holy arm, and put on vengeance as a cloak, and deal vengeance
thick and double amongst the haters of Zion. It may be we see him sow and send
down maledictions and vengeances as thick as drops of rain or hail upon his
enemies: For our Lord owes them a black day and he uses duly to pay his
debts neither his friends and followers, nor his foes and adversaries shall
have it to say, that he is not faithful and exact in keeping his word. I know
no bar in God's way but Scotland's guiltiness, and he can come over that
impediment and break that bar also, and then say to guilty Scotland as he said
Ezekiel. 36. Not for your sakes, etc. On-waiting had ever yet a blessed issue, and
to keep the word of God's patience keeps still the saints dry in the water,
cold in the fire, and breathing and blood-hot in the grave. What are prisons of
iron walls and gates of brass to Christ? Not so good as feal dikes,
fortifications of straw, or old tottering walls: If he give the word, then the
chains will fall off the arms and legs of his prisoners. God be thanked that
our Lord Jesus has the tutouring of King and Court and Nobles, and that he can
dry the gutters and the mires in Sion, and lay causeys to the Temple with the
carcases of bastard Lord-Prelats and idol-shepherds: The corn on the house-tops
got never the husband-man's prayers, and so is seen on it, for it fills not
the hand of mowers. Christ and truth and innocence works even under the
earth, and verily there is hope for the righteous: We see not what conclusions
pass in heaven anent all the affaris of God's house: we need not give hire to
God to take vengeance of his enemies; for Justice works without hire. O that
the seed of hope would grow again and come to maturity! And that we could
importune Christ and double our knocks at his gate, and cast our cries and
shouts over the wall, that he might come out and make our Jerusalem the praise
of the whole earth, and give us Salvation for walls and bulwarks! If Christ bud
and grow green and bloom and bear seed again in Scotland. and his father send
him two summers again in one year, and bless his crop; O what cause have we to
rejoice in the free salvation of our Lord and to set up our banners in the name
of our God! O that he would hasten the confusion of the leprous strumpet, the
mother and mistress of abominations in the earth, and take graven images out of
the way, and come in with the Jews in troops, and agree with his old out cast
and forsaken wife, and take them in again to his bed of love! Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in our Master and Lord, S. R.

To the Lady LARGIRIE. [129.]
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I exhort you in the Lord to go on in your
journey to heaven, and to be content of such fare by the way as Christ and his
followers have had before you; for they had always the wind on their faces,
and our Lord has not changed the way to us for our ease; but will have us
following our sweet guide. Alas how does sin dog us in our journey and retard
us! What fools are we to have a by-god or an other lover or match to our souls
beside Christ? It were best for us like ill bairns [who are best heard at home]
to seek our own home, and to sell our hopes of this little clay Innes and idol
of the earth, where we are neither well summered nor well wintered. Oh that our
souls would fall so at odds with the love of this world, as to think of it as
a traveller does of a drink of water, which is not any part of his treasure,
but goes away with the using; for ten miles journey makes that drink to him
as nothing! O that we had as soon done with this world and could as quickly
dispatch the love of it! But as a child cannot hold two apples in his little
hand, but the one puts the other out of it is room; so neither can we be
masters and Lords of two loves: Blessed were we if we could make our selves
masters of that invaluable treasure the love of Christ; or rather suffer our
selves to be mastered and subdued to Christ's love, so as Christ were our all
things, and all other things our nothings and the refuse of our delights. O let
us be ready for shipping against the time our Lord's wind and tide call for us!
Death is the last thief that shall come without din or noise of feet, and take
our souls away, and we shall take our leave at Time and f^ce Eternity, and our
Lord shall lay together the two sides of this earthly Tabernacle and fold us
and lay us by, as a man lays by his clothes at night, and put the one half of
us in a house of clay, the dark grave, and the other half of us in heaven or
hell. Seek to be found of your Lord in peace and gather in your flitting and
put your soul in order, for Christ will not give a nail-breadth of Time to our
little sand-glass. Pray for Zion, and for me his prisoner, that he would be
pleased to bring me amongst you again full of Christ and fraughted and laden
with the blessings of his Gospel. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his only Lord and Master, S. R.

To EARLESTOWN Younger [130]
Worthy and dearly beloved in the Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear from you: I remain still a
prisoner of hope, and do think it service to the Lord to wait on still with
submission, till the Lord's morning-skie break and his summer day dawn: for I
am persuaded it is a piece of the chief errand of our life, that God sent us
for some years down to this earth among devils and men, the firebrarnds of the
devil, and temptations, that we might suffer for a time here amongst our
enemies; otherwise he might have made heaven to wait on us at our coming out of
the womb, and have carried us home to our country, without letting us set down
our feet in this knotty and thorny life; but seeing a piece of suffering is
carved to every one of us, less or more, as infinite wisdom has thought good,
our part is to harden and habituat our soft and thin skinned nature to endure
fire and water, devils, lions, men, losses, woe hearts, as these that are
looked upon by God, Angels, men and devils. O what folly is it to sit down and
weep upon a decree of God, that is both dumb and deaf at our tears, and must
stand still as unmovable as God who made it, for who can come behind our Lord
to alter or better what he has decreed and done? It were better to make
windows in our prison and to look out to God and our country Heaven, and to
cry like fettered men who long for the King's free air, Lord, let t^y Kingdom
come: O let the Bridegroom come! And O day, O fair day, O everlasting summer
day, dawn and shine out, break out from under the black night sky and shine! I
am persuaded, if every day, a little stone in the prison walls were broken, and
thereby assurance given to the chained prisoner lying under twenty stone of
irons upon arms and legs, that at length his chain should wear in two pieces,
and a hole should be made at length as wide as he might come safely out to his
long desired liberty; he would in patience wait on till time should hole the
prison wall and break his chains: The Lord's hopeful prisoners under their
trials are in that case: Years and months will take out now one little stone,
then another, of this house of clay, and at length time shall win out the
breadth: of a fair door and send out the imprisoned soul to the free air in
heaven, and time shall fil^ off by little and little our iron bolts, which are
now on legs and arms, and out-date and wear our troubles threed-bare and
hollie, and then wear them to nothing: For what I suffered yesterday I know
shall never come again to trouble me. O that we could breath out new hope and
new submission every day in Christ's lap! For certainly a weight of glory well
weighed [yea increasing to a far more exceeding and eternal weight] shall
recompense both weight and length of light and clipped and short-dated crosses:
Our waters are but ebb and come neither to our chin nor to ^he stopping of our
breath. I may see [if I would borrow eyes from Christ] dry land and that near:
Why then should we not laugh at adversity and scorn our short-born and
soon-dying temptations: I rejoice in the hope of that glory to be revealed, for
it is no uncertain glory we look for; our hope is not hung upon such an
untwisted thread as, I imagine so, or it is likely; but the cable, the strong
tow of our fastened anchor, is the oath and the promise of him who is eternal
verity, our Salvation is fastened with God's own hand and with Christ's own
strength to the strong stoup of God's unchangeable nature. Mal 3. 6. I am the
Lord, I change not, and therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed: We may
play and dance and leap upon our worthy and immovable rock: the ground is sure
and good and will bide hell's brangling and devils brangling and the world's
assaults. Oh if our faith could ride it out against the high and proud winds
and waves, when our sea seems all to be on fire! O how often do I let my grips
go! I am put to swimming and half sinking: I find the devil has the
advantage of the ground in this battle, for he fights in known ground in our
corrupt nature: Alas that is a friend near of kin and blood to himself, and
will not fail to fall foul upon us: And hence it is that he who saves to the
uttermost and leads many sons to glory, is still righting my salvation and
twenty times a day I ravel my heaven, and then I must come with my ill raveled
work to Christ to cumber him [as it were] to right it and to seek again the
right end of the thread, and to fold up again my eternal glory with his own
hand, and to give a right cast of his holy and gracious hand to my marred and
spilt salvation: Certainly it is a cumbersom thing to keep a foolish child
from falls and broken brows, and weeping for this and that toy, and rash
running and sickness and bairns diseases; ere he win through them all, and win
out of the mires, he costeth meekle black cumber and fashrie to his keepers:
And so is a believer a cumbersom piece of work and an ill raveled hesp [as we
use to say] to Christ: But God be thanked, for many spilt salvations and many
ill raveled hesps has Christ mended since first he entered tutour to lost
mankind. O what could we bairns do without him! how soon would we mar all?
But the less of our weight be upon our own feeble legs, and the more that we be
on Christ the strong Rock the better for us: It is good for us that ever Christ
took the cumber of us: it is our heaven to lay many weights and burdens upon
Christ, and to make him all we have, root and top, beginning and ending of our
salvation: Lord hold us ^ere. Now to this tutour and rich Lord I recommend you:
Hold fast till he come and remember his prisoner. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his and your Lord Jesus, S. R.

To Mr WILLIAM DALGLEISH. [131]
Reverend and dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter. I bless our high and
only wise Lord who has broken the s^are that men had laid for you, and I hope
that now he shall keep you in his house in despite of the powers of hell. Who
knows but the streets of our Jerusalem shall yet be filled with young men and
with old men and boys and women with child and that they shall plant vines in
the mountains of Samaria. I am sure, the wheels, paces and motions of this poor
Church, are tempered and ruled not as men would, but according to the good
pleasure and infinite wisdom of our only wise Lord. I am here waiting in hope,
that my innocence in this honorable cause shall melt this cloud that men have
casten over me. I know my Lord had his own quarrels against me and that my
dross stood in need of this hot furnace; but I rejoice in this, that fair
truth, beautiful truth, [whose glory my Lord clears to me more and more]
bearth me company, and that my weak aims to honor my Master in bringing
guests to his house, now swell upon me in comforts, and that I am not afraid
to want a witness in heaven, that it was my joy to have a crown put upon
Christ's head in that country. O what joy would I have to see the wind turn
upon the enemies of the cross of Christ, and to see my Lord Jesus restored with
the voice of praise to his own f^ee throne again, and to be brought amongst you
to see the beauty of the Lord's house! I hope that country will not be so
silly, as to suffer men to pluck you away from them, and that ye will use means
to keep my place empty and to bring me back again to the people to whom I have
Christ's right and his Church's lawful calling. Dear Brother, let Christ be
dearer and dearer to you, let the conquest of souls be top and root, flower and
bloom of your joys and desires in this side of sun and moon: and in the day
when the Lord shall pull up the four stakes of this clay tent of the earth, and
the last pickle of sand shall be at the nick of falling down in your
watch-glass, and the master shall call the servants of the vincyard to give
them their hire; ye will esteem the bloom of this world's glory like the
colors of the rainbow, that no man can put in his purse and treasure: Your
labors and pains shall then smile upon you. My Lord now has given me
experience [howbeit weak and small] that our best fare here is hunger; we are
but at God's by-board in this lower house, we have cause to long for
supper-time and the high table, up in the high palace: This world deserves
nothing but the utter court of our soul. Lord hasten the marriage-supper of the
Lamb. I find it still peace to give up with this present world as with an old
decourted and cast-off lover: My bread and drink in it, is not so much worth,
that I should not loath the Innes, and pack up my desires for Christ, that I
have sent out to the feckless creatures in it. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your affectionat Brother and Crhist's prisoner. S. R.

To the Lord of CALLY. (132)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear how your soul prospers: I
have that confidence that your soul minds Christ and salvation: I beseech you
in the Lord give more pains and diligence to fetch heaven, then the
countrey-sort of lazy professors; who think their own faith and their own
godliness, because it is their own, best; and content themselves with a
coldrife custom and course, with a resolution to summer and winter in that sort
of profession, that the multitude and the times favor most, and are still
shaping and clipping and carving their faith, according as it may best stand
with their summer-sun and a whole skin; and so breath out both hot and cold in
God's matters, according to the course of the times: This is their compass they
sail toward heaven by, in stead of a better. Worthy and dear Sir, separate your
self from such, and bend your self to the utmost of your strength and breath,
in running fast for salvation, and in taking Christ's Kingdom, use violence: It
cost Christ and all his followers sharp showers and hot sweats ere they won to
the top of the mountain: But still our soft nature would have heaven coming to
our bedside when we are sleeping, and lving down with us, that we might go to
heaven in warm clothes; but all that came there ^ound wet feet by the way, and
sharp storms that did take the hide off their face, and ^ound to's and fro's
and up's and down's and many enemies by the way. It is impossible a man can
take his lusts to heaven with him, such wares as these will not be welcome
there. O how loath are we to forgo our packalds and burdens that hinder us to
run our race with patience! It is no small work to displease and anger nature,
that we may please God. O if it be hard to win one foot or half an inch out of
our own will, out of our own wit, out of our own ease and worldly lusts, and so
to deny our self, and to say, It is not I but Christ, not I but grace, not I
but God's glory, not I but God's love constraining me, not I but the Lord's
word, not I but Christ's commanding power as King in me! O what pains and what
a death is it to nature, to turn me, my self, my lust, my ease, my credit, over
in, my Lord, my Savior, my King and my God, my Lord's will, my Lord's grace!
But alas that idol, that whorish creature my self, is the master-idol we all
bow to: What made Evah miscarry? and what hurried her headlong upon the
forbidden fruit, but that wretched thing her self? What drew that
brother-murtherer to kill Abel? That wild himself What drove the old world on
to corrupt their ways? Who but themselves, and their own pleasure? What was
the cause of Solomon's falling into idolatry and multiplying of strange wives?
What but himself, whom he would rather pleasure then God. What was the hook
that took David and snared him first in adultery but his self-lust, and then in
murder but his self-credit and self-honour? What led Peter on to deny his
Lord? Was it not a piece of himself and self-love to a whole skin? What made
Judas sell his Matter for 30 pieces of money, but a piece of self-love
idolizing of avaritions self? What made Demas to go off the way of the Gospel,
to embrace this present world? even self love and love of gain for himself:
Every man blames the devil for his sins, but the great devil, the house-devil
of every man, the house-devil that eats and lies in every man's bosom, is
that idol that kills all, himself. O blessed are they who can deny themselves
and put Christ, in the room of themselves! O would to the Lord, I had not a my
self, but Christ; nor a my lust, but Christ, no^ a my ease, but Christ; nor a
my honor, but Christ! O sweet word, Gal. 2: 20. I live no more, but Christ
lives in me! O if every one would put away himself, his own self, his own
ease, his own pleasure, his own credit, and his own twenty things, his own
hundred things, that he sets up as idols above Christ! Dear Sir, I know ye
will be looking back to your old self and to your self-lust and self-idol that
ye set up in the lusts of youth above Christ. Worthy Sir, pardon this my
freedom of love: God is my witness that it is out of an earnest desire after
your soul's eternal welfare, that I use this freedom of speech. Your sun I know
is lower and your evening sky and sunsetting nearer then when I saw you last:
Strive to end your task before night, and to make Christ your-self, and to
acquaint your love and your heart with the Lord Stand now by Christ and his
truth, when so many fail foully and are false to him: I hope ye love him and
his truth, let me have power with you to confirm you in him. I think more of my
Lord's sweet cross then of a crown of gold and a free Kingdom lying to it. Sir,
I remember you in my prayers to the Lord, ^ding to my promise: Help me with
your prayers that our Lord would be pleased to bring me amongst you again with
the Gospel of Christ: Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his sweetest Lord and Master, S. R.

To JOHN GORDON Of Cardoness younger. (133).
Dearly beloved in our Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long exceedingly to hear of the case of
your soul which has a large share both of ^y prayers and careful thoughts.
Sir, remember that a precious treasure and prize is upon this short play that
ye are now upon, even the eternity of well or woe to your soul stands upon
the little point of your ill or well employed short and swift posting
sand-glass: Seek the Lord while he may be found, the Lord waits upon you:
Your soul is of no little price: gold or silver of as much bounds as would
cover the highest heavens round about, cannot buy it: To live as others do and
to be free of open sins that the world cries shame upon, it will not bring you
to heaven: as much civility and countrey-discretion as would lie between you
and heaven, will not lead you one foot or one inch above condemned nature: and
therefore take pains upon seeking of salvation, and give your will, wit, humor
the green desires of youth's pleasures, off your hand to Christ, It is not
possible for you to know, till experience teach you, how dangerous a time Youth
is: It is like green and wet timber; when Christ casts fire on it, it takes
not fire: There is need here of more then ordinary pains; for corrupt nature
has a good back-friend of Youth, and sinning against light will put out your
candle and stupifie your conscience and bring upon it more coverings and skins
and less feeling and sense of guiltiness, and when that is done the Devil is
like a mad horse that has broken the bridle and runs away with his rider
whither he lists. Learn to know that which the Apostle knew, the
deceitfulness of sin: strive to make prayer and reading and holy company and
holy conference your delight, and when delight comes in, ye shall by little
and little smell the sweetness of Christ, till at length your soul be over head
and ears in Christ's sweetness: then shall ye be taken up to the top of the
mountain with the Lord, to know the ravishments of spiritual love and the glory
and excellency of a s^en, revealed, felt and embraced Christ: and then ye shall
not be able to loose your self off Christ and to bind your soul to old lovers:
then and never till then are all the paces, motions, walkings and wheels of
your soul in a right tune and in a spiritual temper: But if this world and the
lusts thereof be your delight, I know not what Christ can make of you, ye
cannot be metal to be a vessel of glory and mercy: as the Lord lives,
thousand thousands are beguiled with security, because God and wrath and
judgment is not terrible to them: stand in aw of God, and of the warnings of a
checking and rebuking conscience: make others to see Christ in you moving,
doing, speaking and thinking; your actions will smell of him, if he be in you:
there is an instinct in the new born babes of Christ, like the instinct of
nature, that leads birds to build their nests and bring up their young and
love such and such places as woods, forests and wildernesses better then other
places: The instinct of nature makes a man love his mother-countrey above all
countries: The instinct of renewed nature and supernatural grace, will lead you
to such and such works, as to love your country above, to sigh to be clothed
with your house not made with hands, and to call your borrowed prison here
below a borrowed prison, and to look upon it servant-like and pilgrim-like: And
the pilgrim's eye and look, is a disdainful like discontented cast of his eye,
his heart crying after his eye, Fie, fie, t^ is is not like my country. I
recommend to you the mending of a hole and reforming of a failing, one or
other, every week, and put off a sin or a piece of it, as of anger, wrath,
lust, intemperance, every day, that ye may more easily master the remnant of
your corruption. God has given you a wife, love her and let her breasts
satisfy you, and for the Lord's sake drink no waters but out of your own
cistern, strange wells are poison. Strive to learn some new way against your
corruption from the man of God M. W. D. or other servants of God: sleep not
sound till ye find your self in that case, that ye dare look death in the face
and durst hazard your soul upon eternity. I am sure many else and inches of the
short thread of your life are by hand, since I saw you: and that thread has an
end, and ye have no hands to cast a knot and add one day or a finger-breadth
to the end of it: When hearing and seeing and the utter walls of the clay-house
shall fall down and life shall render the besieged castle of clay to death and
judgment, and ye find your time worn ebb and run out, what thoughts will ye
then have of idol-pleasures, that possibly are now sweet? what bud or hire
would ye then give for the Lord's favor? and what a price would ye then give
for pardon? It were not amiss to think, what if I were to receive a doom and to
enter into a surnace of fire and brimstone? What if it come to this: that I
shall have no portion but utter darkness? And what if (...) be brought to this,
to be banished from the presence of God and to be given over to God's
sergeants, the Devil and the power of the second Death? Put your soul by
supposition in such a case, and ^sider what horror would take hold of you and
what then ye would esteem of pleasing your self in the course of sin! O dear
Sir, for the Lord's sake awake to live righteously and love your poor soul, and
after ye have seen this my letter, say with yourself, the Lord will seck an
account of this warning I have received. Lodge Christ in your family. Receive
no stranger hireling as your Pastor. I bless your children. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your lawful and loving Pastor. S. R.

To my Lord BOYD. [134]
My very honorable and good Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to your Lo: Out of the worthy report that I hear of
your Lo: zeal for this born down and oppressed Gospel, I am bold to write to
your Lo: beseeching you by the mercies of God, by the honor of our royal and
princely King Jesus, by the sorrows, tears and desolation of your afflicted
mother church, and by the peace of your conscience and your joy in the day of
Christ, that your Lo: would go on in the strength of your Lord and in the
power of his might, to bestir your self for the vindicating of the fallen
honor of your Lord Jesus. O blessed hands for evermore that shall help to put
the crown upon the head of Christ again in Scotland! I dare promise in the name
of our Lord that this shall fasten and fix the pillars and the stakes of your
own honorable house upon earth, if ye lend and lay in pledge in Christ's hand
[upon spiritual hazard] life, estate, house, honor, credit, moyen, friends,
the favor of men [suppose King's with three crown^] sobeing ye may bear
witness and acquit your self as a man of valor and courage to the Prince of
your salvation, for the purging of his temple and s^eeping out the Lordly
Diotrephes's, time-courting Demas's, corrupt Hymeneus's and Philetus's and
other such oxen that with their dung defile the Temple of the Lord. Is not
Christ now crying, Who will help me? Who will come out with me, to take part
with me and share in the honor of my victory over these mine enemies who have
said: We ^ill not have this man to rule over us; My very honorable and dear
Lord, join, join [a^ ye do^] with Christ, he is more worth to you and your
posterity then this world's May flowers and withering Riches and Honor, that
shall go away as smoke and evanish in a nightvision, and shall in one half
hour after the blast of the Archangel's trumpet, lie in white ashes. Let me
beseech your Lo: to draw by the lap of Time's curtain and look in through that
window to great and endless Eternity, and consider if a worldly price [suppose
this little round clay globe of this ashie and dirty earth, the dying idol of
the fools of this world were all (your own] can be given for one smile of
Christ's God-like and soul ravishing countenance, in that day when so many
joints and knees of thousand thousands wailing shall stand before Christ
trembling, shouting and making their prayers to hills and mountains to fall
upon them and hide them from the face of the Lamb. O how many would sell
Lordships and Kingdoms that day and buy Christ! But Oh the market shall be
closed and ended ere then. Your Lo: has now a blessed venture of winning court
with the Prince of the Kings of the earth: He himself weeping, truth born down,
and fallen in the streets and an oppressed Gospel, Christ's bride with watery
eyes and spoiled of her vail, her hair hanging about her eyes forced to go in
ragged apparel, the banished, silenced and imprisoned prophets of God, who have
not the favor of liberty to prophecy in sackcloth, all these I say, call for
your help: Fear not worms of clay, the moth shall eat them as a garment, let
the Lord be your fear, he is with you and shall fight for you: thus shall ye
cause the blessing of these who are ready to perish come upon you, and ye shall
make the heart of this your Mother Church to sing for joy. The Lamb and his
armies are with you and the Kingdoms of the earth are the Lord's. I am
persuaded there is not another Gospel nor another saving truth, then that which
ye now contend for, I dare hazard my heaven and salvation upon it, that this is
the only saving way to glory. Grace, grace be with your Lo:

Aberd. 1637. Your Lo: at all respective obedience in Christ. S. R.

To ROBERT GORDON. Bailiffe of Air. (135)
Worthy Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear from you. Our Lord is with
his afflicted Kirk, so that this burning bush is not consumed to ashes. I know
submissive on-waiting for the Lord shall at length ripen the joy and
deliverance of his own, who are truly blessed on-waiters: What is the dry and
miscarrying hope of all them who are not in Christ, but confusion and wind? O
how pitifully and miserably are the children of this world beguiled, whose wine
comes home to them water, and their gold brass and tin! And what wonder that
hopes builded upon sand, should fall and sink? It were good for us all to
abandon the forlorn and blasted and withered hope we have had in the creature,
and let us henceforth come and drink water out of our own well, even the
fountain of living waters, and build our selves and our hope upon Christ our
rock: But alas that natural love that we have to this borrowed home that we
were born in, and that this clay-city, the vain earth, should have the largest
share of of our heart! Our poor lean and empty dreams of confidence in
something beside God are no further traveled then up and down the naughty and
feckless creatures. God may say of us, as he said, Amos 6: 13. Ye rejoice in a
thing of noug^t. Surely we spin our spider's web with pain, and build our
rotten and tottering house upon a lie and falsehood and vanity. O when will we
learn to have thoughts higher then the sun and moon, and learn our joy, hope,
confidence and our soul's desires to look up to our best country, and to look
down to clay tents set up for a night's lodging or two, in this unknown land,
and laugh at our childish conceptions and imaginations that suck our joy out of
creatures, woe, sorrow, losses and grief. O sweetest Lord Jesus! O fairest
Godhead! O flower of man and angels, why are we such strangers to, and far-off
beholders of thy glory? O it were our happiness for evermore, that God would
cast a pest, a botch, a leprosy upon our part of this great whore, a fair and
well busked World, that clay might no longer deceive us! but O that God may
burn and blast our Hope hereaway, rather then our Hope should live to burn us!
Alas the wrong side of Christ [to speak so] his blackside, his suffering side,
his wounds, his bare coat, his wants, his wrongs, the oppressions of men done
to him, are turned toward men's eyes and they see not the best and fairest side
of Christ, nor see they his amiable face and his beauty, that man and angels
wonder at. Sir, lend your thoughts to th^se things, and learn to contemn this
world, and to turn your eyes and heart away from beholding the masked beauty of
all things under Time's law and doom: See him who is invisible and his
invisible things, draw by the curtain and look in with liking and longing to a
Kingdom undefiled that fades not away, reserved for you in the heaven: This is
worthy of your pains and worthy of your soul's sweating and laboring and
seeking after night and day: Fire will flee over the earth and all that is in
it, even destruction from the Almighty: Fie, fie upon that hope that shall be
dried up by the root! Fie upon the drunken night-bargains, And the drunken and
mad covenant that sinners make with death and hell after cups, and when men's
souls are mad and drunken with the love of this lawless life! They think to
make a nest for their hopes, and take quarters and conditions of hell and
death, that they shall have ease, long life, peace, and in the morning when the
last trumpet shall awake them, then they rue the block. It is time and high
time for you to think upon death and your accounts, and to remember what ye
are, where ye will be before the year of our Lord 1700. I hope ye are thinking
upon this: pull upon your soul and draw it aside from the company that it is
with, and round and whisper in to it news of eternity, death, judgment,
heaven and hell. Grace, grace be with you.

To ALEXANDER GORDON, Of Earlestown. (136)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: It is like if ye the Gentry and Nobility of
this nation, be men in the streets [as the word speaketh] for the Lord, that he
will now deliver his flock and gather and rescue his scattered sheep from the
hands of cruel and rigorous Lords, that have ruled over them with force. O that
mine eyes might see the moonlight turn to the light of the sun! But I still
fear the quarrel of a broken Covenant in Scotland stands before the Lord:
However it be, I avouch it before the world, the tabernacle of the Lord shall
again be in the midst of Scotland, and the glory of the Lord shall dwell in
beauty as the light of many days in one, in this land, O what could my soul
desire more next to my Lord Jesus, while I am in this flesh, but that Christ
and his Kingdom might be great amongst Jews and Gentiles, and that the Isles
[and amongst them, overclouded and darkened Britan] might have the glory of a
noon-day's sun! Oh that I had any thing [I will not except my part in Christ]
to wodset or lay in pledge to redeem and buy such glory to my highest and royal
Prince, my sweet Lord Jesus! my poor little heaven were well bestowed, if it
could stand a pawn for ever to set on high the glory of my Lord; But I know,
he needs not wages nor hire at my hand: Yea, I know, if my eternal glory
could weigh down in weight it is alone, all the eternal glory of the blessed
Angels and of all the spirits of just and perfect men glorified and to be
glorified, Oh alas, how far am I engaged to forgo it for, and give it over to
Christ; sobeing he might thereby be set on high above ten thousand thousand
millions of heavens, in the conquest of many, many nations to his Kingdom! Oh
that his Kingdom would come! O that all the world would stoop before him! O
blessed hands that shall put the crown upon Christ's head in Scosland! But
alas, I can scarce get leave to ware my love on him: I can find no ways to
^u^ my h^at upon Christ and my love that I with my soul bestow on him, it is
like to die upon my hand, and I think it no bairns-play to be hungered with
Christ's love: To love him and to want him wants little of hell. I am sure he
knows how my joy would swell upon me from a little well to a great sea, to
have as much of his love and as wide a soul answerable to comprehend it, till I
cried, hold Lord, no more: But I find he will not have me to be mine own
steward nor mine own carver: Christ keeps the keys of Christ [to speak so]
and of his own love, and he is a wiser distributer then I can take up: I know
there is more in him then would make me run over like a coast-full-sea. I were
happy for evermore to get leave to stand but beside Christ and his love, and to
look in, suppose I were interdicted of God to come near hand, touch or embrace,
kiss or set too my sinful head and drink my self drunken with that lovely
thing. God send me that I would have, for I now verily see, more clearly then
before, our folly in drinking dead waters and in playing the whore with our
soul's love upon runningout wells, and broken sheards of creatures of
yesterday, whom Time will unlaw with the penalty of losing their being and
natural ornaments. O when a soul's love is itching [to speak so] for God, and
when Christ in his boundless and bottomless love, beauty and excellency comes
and rubbeth up and exciteth that love, what can be heaven if this be not
heaven? I am sure this bit feckless, narrow and short love of regenerated
sinners was born for no other end, but to breath and live and love and dwell in
the bosom and betwixt the breasts of Christ: Where is there a bed or a lodging
for the saints love but Christ? O that he would take our selves off our hand,
for neither we nor the creatures can be either due conquest or lawful heritage
to love! Christ and none but Christ is Lord and proprietour of it. Oh alas, how
pitiful is it that so much of our love goes by him! O but we be wretched
wasters of our soul's love! I know it is the deep of bottomless, and
unsearchable providence, that the saints are suffered to play the whore from
God, and that their love goes a hunting, when God knows it shall roast
nothing of that at supper-time: The renewed would have it otherwise; and why is
it so, seeing our Lord can keep us without nodding, tottering or reeling, or
any fall at all? Our desires I hope shall meet with perfection; but God will
have our sins an office-house for God's grace, and has made sin a matter of an
unlaw and penalty for the Son of God's blood; and howbeit sin should be our
sorrow, yet there is a sort of acquiescing and resting upon God's dispensation
required of us, that there is such a thing in us as Sin, whereupon mercy,
forgiveness, healing, curing, in our sweet Physician, may find a field to work
upon. O what a deep is here, that created wit cannot take up! However matters
go, it is our happiness to win new ground daily in Christ's love, and to
purchase a new piece of it daily and to add conquest to conquest, till our
Lord Jesus and we be so near other, that Satan shall not draw a straw or a
thread betwixt us. And for my self, I have no greater joy in my welfavoured
bonds for Christ, then that I know, time shall put him and me together; and
that my love and longing has room and liberty amidst my bonds and foes
[whereof there are not a few here of all ranks] to go visit the borders and
utter coasts of my Lord Jesus's country and see at least afar off and darkly,
the country which shall be mine inheritance, which is my Lord Jesus's due,
both through birth and conquest. I dare avouch to all that know God, that the
saints know not the length and largeness of the sweet earnest and of the sweet
green sheaves before the harvest, that might be had on this side of the water,
if we should take more pains: And that we all go to heaven with less earnest
and lighter purses of the hoped-for sum, then otherwise we might do, if we
took more pains to win further in upon Christ, in this pilgrimage of our
absence from him. Grace, grace and glory be your portion.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To JOHN LAWRIE. (137)
Dear Brother.
I Am sorry that ye or so many in this Kingdom should expect so much of me an
empty reed: Verily I am a naughty and poor body: But if the tinkling of my Lord
Jesus's iron chains on legs and arms could sound the high praises of my royal
King, whose prisoner I am, O how would my joy run over! If my Lord would bring
edificatio^ to one soul by my bonds, I am satisfied; but I know not what I can
do to such a princely and beautiful welbeloved: He is far behind with me:
Little thanks to me to say to others, his wind blows on me who am but
withered and dry bones: But since ye desire me to write to you, either help me
to set Christ on high for his running-over love, in that the heat of his sweet
breath has melted a frozen heart, else I think ye do nothing for a prisoner.
I am fully confirmed that it is the honor of our Lawgiver I suffer for now: I
am not ashamed to give out letters of recommendation of Christ's love to as
many as will extol the Lord Jesus and his cross. If I had not sailed this
sea-way to heaven, but had taken the land-way as many do, I should not have
known Christ's sweetness in such a measure: But the truth is, let no man thank
me; for I caused not Christ's wind to blow upon me: His love came upon a
withered creature whether I would or not; [and yet by coming it procured from
me a welcome] A heart of iron and iron doors will not hold Christ out: I give
him leave to break iron locks and come in, and that is al: and now I know not
whether pain of love for want of possession, or sorrow that I dow not thank
him, paineth me most: but both work upon me. For the First, O that he would
come and satisfy the longing soul and fill the hungry soul with these good
things? I know indeed my guiltiness may be a bar in his way, but he is God, and
ready to forgive: And for the other, woe, woe is me that I cannot find a heart
to give back again my unworthy little love for his great sea-full of love to
me: O that he would learn me this piece of gratitude! O that I could have leave
to look in through the hole of the door to see his face and sing his praises! or
could break up one of his chamber windows to look in upon his delighting
beauty, till my Lord send more: any little communion with him, one of his
love-looks should be my begun heaven: I know he is not Lordly, neither is the
bridegroom's love proud, though I be black and unlovely and unworthy of him. I
would seek but leave, and withal, grace, to spend my love upon him: I counsel
you to think highly of Christ and of free, free grace more then ye did before;
for I know that Christ is not known amongst us; I think I see more of Christ
then ever I saw, and yet I see but little of what may be seen: O that he would
draw by the curtains and that the King would come out of his gallerie and his
palace, that I might see him! Christ's love is young glory and young heaven: It
would soften hell's pains to be filled with it: What would I refuse to suffer,
if I could but get a draught of love at my hearts desire? O what price can be
given for him! Angels cannot weigh him, O his weight, his worth, his sweetness,
his overpassing beauty! If men and Angels would come and look to that great and
Princely one, their ebbeness would never take up his depth, their narrowness
would never comprehend his breadth height and length: If ten thousand thousand
worlds of Angels were created, they might all tire themselves in wondering at
his beauty, and begin again to wonder of new. O that I could win nigh him to
kiss his feet, to hear his voice, to find the smell of his ointments! But Oh
alas I have little, little of him; yet I long for more! Remember my bonds and
help me with your prayers for I would not niffer or exchange my sad hours with
the joy of my velvet-adversaries. Grace be with you.

Aberd. June. 10. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To Mr JAMES FLEMING. (138)
Reverend and welbeloved in our Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter, which has refreshed
me in my bonds. I cannot but testify unto you, my dear Brother, what sweetness
I find in our Master's cross; but alas, what can I either do or suffer for
him? If I my alone had as many lives as there have been drops of rain since the
creation, I would think them too little for that lovely one, our welbeloved;
but my pain and my sorrow is above my sufferings, that I find not ways how to
set out the praises of his love to others: I am not able by tongue, pen or
sufferings to provoke many to fall in love with him, but he knows whom I love
to serve in the spirit, what I would do and suffer by his own strength,
sobeing I might make my Lord Jesus lovely and sweet to many thousands in this
land. I think it amongst God's wonders that he will take any praise or glory or
any testimony to his honorable cause, from such a forlorn sinner as I am: But
when Christ works he needs not ask the question by whom he will be
glorious: I know, seeing his glory at the beginning did shine out of poor
nothing to set up such a fair house for man and Angels, and so many glorious
creatures to proclaim his goodness, power and wisdom, if I were burnt to ashes,
out of the smoke and powder of my dissolved body he could raise glory to
himself: His glory is his end, Oh that I could join with him to make it my end!
I would think that fellowship with him sweet and glorious. But alas, few know
the guiltiness that is on my part, it is a wonder that this good cause has not
been marred and spilt in my foul hands: But I rejoice in this that my sweet
Lord Jesus has found something ado, even a ready market for his free grace
and incomparable and matchless mercy in my wants: Only my loathsome
wretchedness and my wants have qualified me for Christ and the riches of his
glorious grace, he behooved to take me for nothing or else to want me: Few know
the unseen and private reckonings betwixt Christ and me; yet his love, his
boundless love would not bide away nor stay at home with himself, and yet I dow
not make it welcome as I ought, when it is come unsent for and without hire. How
joyful is my heart that ye write ye are desirous to join with me in praising;
for it is charity to help a Dyvour to pay his debts; but when all have helped
me, my name shall stand in his count-book under ten thousand thousands of
sums unpayed: But it eases my heart that ^is dear servants will but speak of
my debts to such a sweet creditour. I desire he may lay me in his own balance
and weigh me, if I would not fain have a feast of his boundless love made to my
own soul and to many others. One thing I know, we shall not all be able to come
near his excellency with eye, heart or tongue; for he is above all created
thoughts; All nations before him are as nothing and as less then nothing, he
^itteth in the circuit of heaven and the inhabitants of the earth are as
grasshoppers before him! O that men would praise him! Ye complain of your
private case: Alas, I am not the man who can speak to such an one as ye are:
Any sweet presence I have had in this town is [I know] for this cause, that I
might express and make it known to others: but I never find my self nearer
Christ and with that royal and Princely One, then after a great weight and
sense of deadness and gracelesness! I think the sense of our wants, when
withal we have a restlesness and a sort of spiritual impatience under them
and ^an make a din because we want him whom our soul loves, is that which
makes an open door to Christ: and when we think we are going backward because
we feel deadness, we are going forward: For the more sense the more life, and
no sense argues no life. There is no sweeter fellowship with Christ, then to
bring our wounds and our sores to him. But for my self, I am ashamed of
Christ's goodness and love since the time of my bonds, for he has been pleased
to open up new treasures of love and felt sweetness, and give visitations of
love and access to himself in this strange land. I would think a fill of his
love, young and green heaven: and when he is pleased to come, and the tide is
in, and the sea full, and the King and a poor prisoner together in the house of
wine, the black tree of the cross is not so heavy as a feather. I cannot, I
dow not but give Christ an honorable and glorious testimony: I see, the Lord
can ride through his enemies bands and triumph in the sufferings of his own,
and that this blind world sees not, that Suffering is Christ's armor wherein
he is victorious: and they that contend with Zion, see not what he is doing
when they are set to work as under-smiths and servants to the work of refining
of the saints [Satan's hand also by them is at the melting of our Lord's
vessels of mercy] and their office in God's house, is to scour and cleanse
vessels for the King's table. I marvel not to see them triumph and sit at ease
in Zion, our father must lay up his rods and keep them carefully for his own
use: our Lord cannot want fire in his house, his furnace is in Zion and his
fire in Jerusalem: but little know the adversaries the counsel and the thoughts
of the Lord. And for your complaints of your ministry, I now think all I did
too little: Plainness, freedom, watchfulness, fidelity, shall swell upon you in
exceeding large comforts in your sufferings: The feeding of Christ's lambs in
private visitations, and catechizing, in painful preaching, and fair, honest
and free warning of the flock is a sufferer's garland. O ten thousand times
blessed are they, who are honored of Christ to be faithful and painful in
wooing a Bride to Christ! My dear Brother. I know ye think more on this then I
can write, and I rejoice that your purpose is, in the Lord's strength to back
your wronged Master and to come out and call your self Christ's man, when so
many are now denying him, as fearing that Christ cannot do for himself and
them. I am a lost man for ever, or this, this is the way to Salvation, even
this way that they call Heresy, that men now do mock and scoff at. I am
confirmed now that Christ will accept of his servants sufferings as good
service to him at the day of his appearance, and that ere it be long he will be
upon us all, and men in all their black's and white's shall be brought out
before God Angels and men. Our Master is not far off: Oh if we could wait on
and be faithful! The good will of him who dwelt in the bush, the tender favor
and love, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Help me with your
pravers, and desire from me, other brethren to take courage for their Master.

Aberd. Aug. 15. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To Mr JOHN MEINE. (139)
Worthy and dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have been too long in answering your
letter, but other business took me up. I am here waiting if the fair wind will
turn upon Christ's sails ^o Scotland, and if deliverance be breaking out to
this overclouded and benighted Kirk. Oh that we could contend by prayers and
supplications with our Lord for that effect! I know he has not given out his
last doom against this land. I have little of Christ in this prison, but
groanings and longings and desires: All my stock of Christ is some hunger for
him [And yet I cannot say but I am rich in that] my faith and hope and holy
practice of new obedience are scarce worth the speaking of: But blessed be my
Lord who takes me, light and clipped and naughty and feckless as I am. I see
Christ will not prig with me nor stand upon stepping stones, but comes in at
the broad side without ceremonies or making it nice, to make a poor ransomed
one his own. O that I could feed upon his breathing and kissing and embracing,
and upon the hopes of my meeting and his, when love letters shall not go
betwixt us, but he shall be messenger himselfthen: But there is required
patience on our part till the summer-^^uit in heaven be ripe for us; it is in
the bud, but there be many things to do before our harvest come: And we take
ill with it and can hardly endure to set our paper-face to one of Christ's
storms, and to go to heaven with wet feet and pain and sorrow: We love to
carry heaven to heaven with us, and would have two summers in one year, and no
less then two heavens; but this will not be for us, one, and such an one, may
suffice us well enough: The man Christ got but one only, and shall we have
two? Remember my love in Christ to your Father and help me with your prayers.
If ye would be a deep Divine, I recommend to you Sanctification: Fear him, and
he shall reveal his Covenant to you. Grace be with you.

Aberd. Jan. 5. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To CARDONNESS Elder. (140)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have longed to hear from you and to know
the estate of your soul and the estate of that people with you: I beseech you
Sir, by the salvation of your precious soul and the mercies of God, make good
and sure work of your salvation and try upon what ground-stone ye have builded.
Worthy and dear Sir, if ye be upon sinking sand, a storm of death and a blast
will loose Christ and you and wash you close off the rock: O for the Lord's
sake look narrowly to the work! read over your life with the light of God's
daylight and sun; for Salvation is not casten down at every man's door: It is
good to look to your compass and all ye have need of, ere ye take shipping; for
no wind can blow you back again. Remember when the race is ended and the play
either won or lost and ye are in the utmost circle and border of time and shall
put your foot within the march of eternity and all your good things of this
short night-dream shall seem to you like the ashes of a bleaze of thorns or
straw, and your poor soul shall be crying, Lodging, lodging, for God's sake:
Then shall your soul be more glad at one of your Lord's lovely and homely
smiles; then if ye had the charters of three worlds for all eternity. Let
pleasures and gain, will and desires of this world be put over in God's hands,
as arrested and fenced goods that ye cannot intromet with: Now when ye are
drinking the ground of your cup and ye are upon the utmost ends of the last
link of time, and old age like death's long shadow is casting a covering upon
your days, it is no time to court this vain life, and to set love and heart
upon it: It is near after supper, seek rest and ease for your soul in God
through Christ: Believe me I find it hard wrestling to play fair with Christ
and to keep good quarters with him, and keep love to him in integrity and life,
and to keep a constant course of sound and solid daily communion with Christ:
temptatations are daily breaking the thread of that course, and it is not easy
to cast a knot again, and many knots make evil work. O how fair have many ships
been plying before the wind, that in an hour's space have been lying in the sea
bottom! How many professors cast a golden luster, as if they were pure gold,
and yet are under that skin and cover but base and reprobate metal! And how
many keep breath in their race many miles, and yet come short of the prize and
the garland! Dear Sir, my soul would mourn in secret for you, if I knew your
case with God to be but false work: Love to have you anchored upon Christ
makes me fear your tottering and slips: False under-water not seen in the
ground of an enlightened conscience, is dangerous; so is often failing and
sinning against light: Know this, that these who never had sick nights nor days
in conscience for sin, cannot have but such a peace with God, as will undercot
and break the flesh again and end in a sad war at death. O how fearfully are
thousands beguiled with false hide grown over old sins, as if the soul were
cured and healed! Dear Sir, I saw ever nature mighty, lofty, heady and strong
in you, and it was more for you to be mortified and dead to the world then
another common man: Ye will take a low ebb, and a deep cut and a long lanc^ to
go to the bottom of your wounds in saving humiliation, to make you a won prey
for Christ: Be humbled, walk softly; down, down for God's sake, my dear and
worthy Brother, with your topsail: Stoop, Stoop, it is a low entry to go in at
heaven's gates: There is infinite Justice in the party ye have to do with, it
is his nature not to acquit the guilty and the sinner: The Law of God will not
want one farthing of the sinner: God forgets not both the Cautioner and the
sinner, and every man must pay either in his own person [O Lord save you from
that payment] or in his cautioner, Christ. It is violence to corrupt nature for
a man to be holy, to lie down under Christ's feet, to quite will, pleasure,
wordly love, earthly hope and an itching of heart after this fairded and
overguilded world, and to be content that Christ trample upon all. Come in,
come in to Christ and see what ye want and find it in him: He is the short cut
[as we use to say] and the nearest way to an outgate of all your burdens: I
dare avouch ye shall be dearly welcome to him, my soul would be glad to take
part of the joy ye should have in him. I daresay, Angels pens, Angels tongues,
nay as many worlds of Angels as there are drops of water in all the seas and
fountains and rivers of the earth, cannot paint him out to you: I think his
sweetness since I was a prisoner has swelled upon me to the greatness of two
heavens: O for a soul as wide as the outmost circle of the highest heaven that
contains all, to contain his love! And yet I could hold little of it. O
world's wonder! O if my soul might but lie within the smell of his love,
suppose I could get no more but the smell of it! O but it is long to that day
when I shall have a free world of Christ's love! O what a sight to be up in
heaven in that fair orchard of the new Paradise, and to see and smell and touch
and kiss that fair field-flower, that ever green tree of life! His bare shadow
were enough for me, a sight of him would be the earnest of heaven to me: Fie, sy
upon us, that we have love lying rusting beside us, or which is worse, wasted
away upon loathsome objects, and Christ should lie his alone. Woe, woe is me,
that Sin has made so many mad men, seeking the fool's Paradise, fire under
ice, and some good and desirable thing without, and apart from Christ: Christ,
Christ, nothing but Christ can cool our love's burning languor: O thirsty love,
will thou set Christ the well of life to thy head and drink thy fill; drink and
spare not, drink love and be drunken with Christ: Nay alas, the distance
betwixt us and Christ is a death: O if we were clasped in other's arms! We
should never twin again except heaven twinned and sundered us, and that cannot
be. I desire your children to seek this Lord: Desire them from me to be
requested for Christ's sake to be blessed and happy, and come and take Christ
and all things with him: Let them beware of glassy and slippery youth, of
foolish young motions, of worldly lusts, of deceivable gain, of wicked company,
of cursing, lying, blaspheming and foolish talking: Let them be filled with the
Spirit, acquaint themselves with daily praying, and with the storehouse of
wisdom and comfort, the good word of God. Help the souls of the poor people: O
that my Lord would bring me again among them, that I might tell uncouth and
great tales of Christ to them! Receive not a stranger to preach any other
doctrine to them. Pray for me his prisoner of hope, I pray for you without
ceasing: I write my blessing, earnest prayers, the love of God and the sweet
presence of Christ to you and yours and them. Grace, grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your lawful and loving Pastor. S. R.

To the Earl of LOTHIAN. (141)
Right honorable and my very worthy and Noble Lord.
OUt of the honorable and good report that I hear of your Lo: goodwill and
kindness in taking to heart the honorable cause of Christ and his afflicted
Church and wronged truth in this land, I make bold to speak a word in paper to
your Lo: at this distance, which I trust your Lo: will take in good part. It is
your Lo: honor and credit to put to your hand [as ye do, all honor to God]
to the fa^ling and tottering tabernacle of Christ in this your Mother Church,
and to own Christ's wrongs as your own wrongs. O blessed hand which shall wipe
and dry the watery eyes of our we^ping Lord Jesus, now going mourning in
sackcloth in his members, in his spouse, in his truth and in the prerogative
royal of his Kingly power! He needs not service and help from men, but it
pleases his wisdom to make the wants and losses, sores and wounds of his
spouse, a ^ield and an office-house for the zeal of his servants to exercise
themselves in: Therefore, my noble and dear Lord, go on, go on in the
strength of the Lord against all opposition to side with wronged Christ: The
defending and warding of strokes off Christ; his Bride, the King's daughter, is
like a piece of the rest of the way to heaven, knotty, rough, stormy and full
of thorns: Many would follow Christ, but with a reservation, that by open
proclamation Christ would cry down crosses, and cry up fair weather and a
summer-skie and sun till we were all fairly landed at heaven. I know your Lo:
has not so learned Christ, but that ye intend to fetch heaven, suppose your
father were standing in your way, and to take it with the wind on your face;
for so both storm and wind was on the fair face of your lovely forerunner
Christ all his way. It is possible the success answer not your desire in this
worthy cause: what then? Duties are ours but events are the Lord's: and I hope,
if your Lo: and others with you shall go on, to dive to the lowest ground and
bottom of the knavery and perfidious treachery to Christ, of the cursed and
wretched Prelates, the Anti-Christ's firstborn and the first fruit of his foul
womb, and shall deal with our Sovereign [Law going before you] for the
reasonable and impartial hearing of Christ's bill of complaints, and set your
selves singley to seek the Lord and his face, your righteousness shall break
through the clouds, that prejudice has drawn over it: and ye shall in the
strength of the Lord bring our banished and departing Lord Jesus home again to
his Sanctuary. Neither must your Lo: advise with flesh and blood in this, but
wink, and in the dark reach your hand to Christ and follow him. Let not men's
fainting discourage you, neither be afraid of men's canny wisdom, who in this
storm take the nearest shore and go to the lee and calm side of the Gospel,
and hide Christ [if ever they had him] in their cabinets, as if they were
ashamed of him, or as if Christ were stolen wares and would blush before the
sun. My very dear and noble Lord, ye have rejoiced the hearts of many, that ye
have made choice of Christ and his Gospel, whereas such great temptations do
stand in your way: But I love your profession the better that it endures
winds: If we knew our selves well, to want temptations is the greatest
temptation of all: Neither is father nor mother, nor court, nor honor, in this
overlustred world with all it is paintry and fairding any thing else, when they
are laid in the balance with Christ; but feathers, shadows, night-dreams and
straws. O if this world knew the excellency, sweetness and beauty of that high
and lofty one, that fairest among the sons of men! verily they should see, if
their love were bigger then ten heavens, all in circles without other, that it
were all too little for Christ our Lord. I hope your choice shall not repent
you, when life shall come to that twilight betwixt Time and Eternity, and ye
shall see the utmost border of Time and shall draw the curtain and look in to
Eternity, and shall one day see God take the heavens in his hands and fold them
together like an old holly garment, and set on fire this clay-part of the
creation of God, and consume away in smoke and ashes the idol-hopes of poor
fools, who think there is not a better country then this low country of dying
clay. Children can not make comparison aright betwixt this life and that to
come; and therefore the babes of this world who see no better, mould in their
own brain a heaven of their own coining, because they see no further then the
nearest side of Time. I dare lay in pawn my hope of heaven that this
reproached way, is the only way of peace: I find it is the way that the Lord
has sealed with his comforts now in my bonds for Christ: and I verily esteem
and find chains and fetters for that lovely one Christ, to be watered over
with sweet consolations and the love-smiles of that lovely Bridegroom, for
whose coming we wait: and when he comes, then shall the black's and white's of
all men come before the sun, then shall the Lord put a final decision upon the
pleas that Zion has with her adversaries: And as fast as Time posteth away
[which neither sits, nor stands, nor sleepeth] as fast is our handbreadth
of this short winter-night flying away and the sky of our long lasting day
drawing near it is breaking. Except your Lo: be pl^ased to plead for me against
the tyranny of Prelates, I shall be forgotten in this prison: for they did shape
my doom according to their new lawless Canons, which is, that a deprived
minister shall be utterly silenced and not preach at all, which is a cruelty
contrary to their own former practices. Now the only wise God, the very God of
peace confirm, strengthen and establish your Lo: upon the stone laid in Zion
and be with you for ever.

To JEAN BROWN. (142)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear how your soul prospers: I
earnestly desire your on-going toward your countr^y: I know ye see your day
melts away by little and little, and that in short time ye will be put beyond
Time's bounds; for life is a post that stands not still, and our joys here
are born weeping rather then laughing and they die weeping: Sin, Sin, this body
of sin and corruption, imbittereth and poisoneth all our enjoyments. O that I
were where I shall sin no more! O to be freed of these chains and iron fetters
that we carry about with us! Lord loose the sad prisoners. Who of the children
of God have not cause to say, that they have their fill of this vain life, and
like a full and sick stomach to wish at mid-supper, that the supper were ended
and the table drawn, that the sick man might win to bed and enjoy rest? We
have cause to tire at mid-supper of the best messes that this world can dress
up for us, and to cry to God that he would remove the table and put the
sin-sick souls to rest with himself. O for a long play-day with Christ, and our
long lasting vacance of rest! Glad may their souls be that are safe over the
fi^th, Christ having paid the fraught: Happy are they who have past their hard
and wearisom time of apprentiship, and are now freemen and citizens in that
joyful high city, the new Jerusalem. Alas that we should be glad of, and
rejoice in our fetters and our prisonhouse and this dear Innes, a life of sin,
where we are absent from our Lord and so far from our home. O that we could get
bonds and law-suretiship of our love, that it fasten not it self on these
clay-dreams, these clayshadows and worldly vanities! We might be oftener seeing
what they are doing in heaven and our heart more frequently upon our sweet
treasure above: We smell of the smoke of this lower house of the earth, because
our heart and our thoughts are here: If we could haunt up with God, we should
smell of heaven and of our country above, and we should look like our country
and like strangers or people not born or brought up hereaway: Our crosses would
not bite upon us, if we were heavenly minded. I know no obligation the saints
have to this world, seeing we fare but upon the smoke of it, and if there be
any smoke in the house, it blows upon our eyes: all our part of the table is
scarce worth a drink of water, and when we are stricken we dare not weep, but
steal our grief away betwixt our Lord and us, and content our selves with stolen
sorrow behind backs. God be thanked we have many things that so stroke us
against the hair, as we may pray, God keep our better home, God bless our
Father's house, and not this smoke that blows us to seek our best lodging. I
am sure this is the best fruit of the cross, when we from the hard fare of the
dear Innes cry the more, that God would send a fair wind to and us hungered and
oppressed strangers at the door of our Father's house, which now is made in
Christ our kindly heritage. O then let us pull up the stakes and stoups of our
tent, and take our tent on our back and go with our flitting to our best home,
for here we have no continuing city! I am waiting in hope here, to see what my
Lord will do with me: Let him make of me whath he pleases; providing he make
glory to himself out of me, I care not. I hope, yea I am now sure, that I am
for Christ, and all that I can or may make is for him: I am his everlasting
debtor or dyvour, and still shall be; for alas I have nothing for him and he
gets little service of me! Pray for me, that our Lord would be pleased to
give me houseroom, that I may serve him in the calling he has called me unto.
Grace be with you.

To ROBERT STUART. (143.)
My Very dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Ye are heartily welcome to my world of
suffering and heartily wel-come to my Master's house, God give you much joy of
your new Master: If I have been in the house before you, I were not faithful
to give the house an ill name, or to speak evil of the Lord of the family: I
rather wish God's Holy Spirit [O Lord breath upon me with that Spirit] to tell
you the fashions of the house. One thing I can say, by on-waiting ye will grow
a great man with the Lord of the house: Hang on till ye get some good from
Christ: Lay all your loads and your weights by faith upon Christ: Ease your
self and let him bear all: he can, he dow, he will bear you, howbeit hell were
upon your back. I rejoice that he is come and has chosen you in the furnace,
it was even there where ye and he set tryst, that is an old gate of Ch^ist's,
he keeps the good old fashion with you, that was in Hosea's days, Hos. 2, 14.
Therefore behold I will allure her and bring her to the wilderness and speak to
her heart: There was no talking to her heart while he and she were in the fair
and flourishing city and at ease; but out in the cold, hungry, waste
wilderness, he allureth her, he whispered in news into her ear there, and
said, Thou art mine. What would ye think of such a bed? Ye may soon do worse
then say, Lord holds all, Lord Jesus a bargain be it, it shall not go back on
my side. Ye have gotten a great advantage in the way to heaven, that ye have
started to the gate in the morning: Like a fool as I was, I suffered my sun to
^e high in the heaven and near afternoon, before ever I took the gate by the
end: I pray you now, keep the advantage ye have: My heart, be not lazy, set as
quickly up the b^ae on hands and feet, as if the last pickle of sand were
running out of your glass, and death were coming to turn the glass: and be very
careful to take heed to your feet in that slippery and dangerous way of youth,
that ye are walking in: The devil and temptations now have the advantage of the
brae of you, and are upon your wand-hand and your working hand: Dry timber will
soon take fire: Be covetous and greedy of the grace of God, and beware that it
be not holiness that comes only from the cross, for too many are that way
disposed, Psalm. 78. 34. When he slew them then they sought him and they
r^turned and enquired early after God. v. 35. Nevertheless they did flatter him
with their mouth and they lied unto him with their tongues. It is a part of our
hypocrisy to give God ^air white words, when he has us in his grips [if I may
speak so] and to flatter him till we win to the fair fields again. Try well
green godliness, and ex^mine what it is ye love in Christ: if ye love but
Christ's sunny side, and would have only summerweather and a land-gate, not a
sea-way to heaven, your profession will play you a slip, and the winter-well
will go dry again in summer: Make no sports nor bairns-play of Christ: But
labor for a sound and lively sight of sin, that ye may judge your self an
undone man, a damned slave of hell and sin, one dying in your own blood, except
Christ come and rue upon you, and take you up; and therefore make sure and fast
work of conversion: Cast the earth deep; and down, down with the old work, the
building of confusion that was there before, and let Christ lay new work and
make a new creation within you: look if Christ's rain goes down to the root of
your withered plants, and if his love wound your heart while it bleed with
sorrow for sin, and if ye can pant and fall a swoon and be like to die for that
lovely one, Jesus: I know Christ will not to be hid where he is, grace will
ever speak for it self, be fruitful in weldoing: The sanctified cross, is a
fruitful tree, it brings forth many apples. If I should tell you by some
weak experience what I have found in Christ, ye or others could hardly believe
me: I thought not the hundred part of Christ long since that I do now, though
alas my thoughts are still infinitely below his worth. I have a dwining, sickly
and pained life for a real possession of him, and am troubled with lovebrashes
and love-fevers, but it is a sweet pain: I would refuse no conditions, not hell
excepted [reserving always God's hatred] to buy possession of Jesus; but alas
I am not a merchant who have any money to give for him, I must either come to a
good cheap market where wares are had for nothing, else I go home empty: But I
have casten this work upon Christ to get me himself: I have his faith and truth
and promise [as a pawn of his] all engaged, that I shall obtain that which my
hungry desires would be at, and I esteem that the choice of my happiness: And
for Christ's cross, especially the garland and the flower of all crosses, to
suffer for his name, I esteem it more then I can write or speak to you: And I
write it under mine own hand to you, it is one of the steps of the ladder up to
our country, and Christ [who ever be one] is still at the heavy end of this
black tree, and so it is but as a feather to me: I need not run at leisure
because of a burden on my back, my back never bare the like of it, the more
heavily crossed for Christ, the soul is still the lighter for the journey. Now
would to God, all coldblooded, faint-hearted soldiers of Christ, would look
again to Jesus and to his love, and when they look, I would have them to look
again and again, and fill themselves with beholding of Christ's beauty, and I
dare say then, that Christ should come in great court and request with many:
The virgins would flock fast about the Bridegroom, they would embrace and take
hold of him and not let him go. But when I have spoken of him till my head
rive, I have said just nothing, I may begin again: A Godhead, a Godhead is a
world's wonder: Set ten thousand thousand new made worlds of angels and elect
men, and double them in number, ten thousand, thousand, thousand times, let
their heart and tongues be ten thousand, thousand times more agile and large,
then the heart and tongues of the Seraphims that stand with six wings before
him, Isa. 6. 2. When they have said all for the glorifying and praising of the
Lord Jesus, they have but spoken little or nothing: his love will bide all
possible creatures to praise. Oh if I could wear this tongue to the stump in
extolling his highness! but it is my daily growing sorrow, that I am confounded
with his incomparable love, and he does so great things for my soul, and he
got never yet any thing of me worth the speaking of. Sir, I charge you help me
to praise him: It is a shame to speak of what he has done for me and what I
do to him again. I am sure, Christ has many drowned Dyvours in heaven beside
him, and when we are conveened, man and angel, at the great day in that fair
last meeting, we are all but his drowned Dyvours: It is hard to say who owes
him most: If men could do no more, I would have them to wonder: If we cannot
be filled with Christ's love; we may be filled with wondering. Sir, I would I
could persuade you to grow sick for Christ and to long after him, and be pained
with love for himself; but his tongue is in heaven, who can do it! To him and
his rich grace I recommend you. I pray you, pray for me and forget not to
praise.

Aberd. June. 17. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To the Lady GAITGIRTH. (144)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to know how matters stand betwixt
Christ and your soul: I know ye find him still the longer the better: time
cannot change him in his love: ye may your self ebb and flow, rise and fall,
wax and wane, but your Lord is this day as he was yesterday: and it is your
comfort that your salvation is not rolled upon wheels of your own making,
neither have ye to do with a Christ of your own shaping: God has singled out
a Mediator, strong and mighty, if ye and your burdens were as heavy as ten
hills or hells, he is able to bear you and save you to the utt^rmost: Your
often seeking to him cannot make you a burden to him. I know, Christ
compassionateth you and makes a moan for you in all your dumps, and under your
downcastings; but it is good for you that he hides himself sometimes, it is
not niceness dryness, nor coldness of love, that causes Christ withdraw and
slip in under a curtain and a vail, that ye cannot see him; but he knows, ye
could not bear with up-sailes, a fair gaile, a full moon and a high springtide
of his felt love, and always a fair summer-day and a summer-sun of a felt and
poss^ssed and embracing Lord Jesus: His kisses and his visits to his dearest
o^es are thin sown: He could not let out his rivers of love upon his own, but
th^se rivers would be in hazard to loose a young plant at the root; and he
knows this of you: Ye should therefore first Christ's kindness as to it is
sensible and full manife^^ations, till ye and he be above sun and moon: that is
the country where ye will be enlarged for that love which ye dow not now
contain. Cast the burden of your sweet babes upon Christ, and lighten your
heart by laying your All upon him, he will be their God. I hope to s^e you up
the mountain yet, and glad in the salvation of God: Frame your self for Christ
and gloom not upon his cross. I find him so sweet, that my love, suppose I
would charge it to remove from Christ, it would not obey me: His love has
stronger fingers then to let go it is grips of us bairns, who cannot go but by
such a hold as Christ. It is good that we want legs of our own, since we may
borrow from Christ: and it is our happiness that Christ is under an act of
cautionry for heaven, and that Christ is booked in heaven as the principal
debtor for such poor bodies as we are. I request you, give the Lord your
husband thanks for his care of me, that he has appeared in public for a
prisoner of Christ: I pray and write mercy and peace and blessings to him and
his. Grace, grace be with you for ever.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus S. R.

To Mr JOHN FER GUSHILL. (145.)
Reverend and Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: My longings and desires for a sight of the
new builded tabernacle of Christ again in Scotland, that tabernacle that came
down from heaven, has now taken some l^fe again, when I see Christ making a
mint to sow vengeance among his enemies. I care not, if this land be ripe for
such a great wonderful mercy; but I know he must do, when ever it is done,
without hire. I find the grief of my silence and my f^ar to be holden at the
door of Christ's house swelling upon me: and the truth is, were it not that I
am dated now and then with pieces of Christ's sweet love and comforts, I fear I
should have made an ill browst of this honorable cross, that I know such a
soft and sillyminded body as I am, is not worthy of: For I have little in me
but softness and superlative and excessive apprehensions of fear and sadness
and sorrow, and often God's terrors do surround me, because Christ looks not
so favorably upon me, as a poor witness would have him: And I wonder how I
have past a year and a quarter's imprisonment without shaming my sweet Lord, to
whom I desire to be faithful; and I think I shall die but even minting and
aiming to serve and honor my Lord Jesus: Few know how toom and empty I am at
home; but it is a part of Marriage-love and husband love, that my Lord Jesus
goes not to the streets with his chiding against me: It is but stolen and
concealed anger that I find and feel, and his glooms to me are kept under
roof, that he will not have mine enemies hearing what is betwixt me and Christ:
And believe me, I say the truth in Christ, the only gall and wormwood in my
cup, and that which has filled me with fear; has been, lest my sins, that sun
and moon and the Lord's children were never witness to, should have moved my
Lord to strike me with dumb sabbaths: Lord pardon my soft and weak jealousies,
if I be here in an error. My very dear Brother, I would have looked for more
large and more particular letters from you, for my comfort in this; for your
words before have strengthened me: I pray you, mend this: and be thankful and
pain^ull while ye have a piece or corner of the Lord's vineyard to dress. O
would to God, I could have leave to follow you to break the clods! but I wish I
could command my soul silence and wait upon the Lord. I am sure while Christ
lives I am well enough friend-stead: I hope he will extend his Kindness and
power for me; but God be thanked, it is not worse with me then a cross for
Christ and his truth. I know he might have pitched upon many more choice and
worthy witnesses, if he had pleased; ^ut I seek no more [be what timber I will,
suppose I were made of a piece of hell] then that my Lord in his infinite art,
hew glory to his name and enlargement to Christ's Kingdom out of me. C^ that I
could attain to this, to desire that my part of Christ might be laid in pledge
for the heightning of Christ's throne in Britain! Let my Lord redeem the
pledge, or, if he please, let it sink and drown unredeemed: But what can I add
to him? Or what way can a smothered and born-down prisoner set out Christ in
open market as a lovely and desirable Lord to many souls? I know he sieth to
his own glory better then my ebb thoughts can dream of, and that the wheels
and paces of this poor distempered Kirk are in his hands, and that things shall
roll as Christ will have them: Only, Lord tryst the matter so, as Christ may
be made a householder and Lord again in Scotland, and wet faces for his
departure, may be dried at his sweet and much desired welcome-home. I see in
all our trials, our Lord will not mix our wares and his grace over head through
other; but he will have each man to know his own, that the like of me man say
in my sufferings, This is Christ's grace, and this is but my course stuff, this
is free grace and this is but nature and reason: We know what our legs would
play us, if they should carry us through all our waters: and the least thing
our Lord can have of us, is, to know we are grace's debtors, or grace's
dyvours, and that nature is of a base house and blood, and grace is better born
and of^ in and blood to Christ and of a better house. Oh that I were free of
that Idol that they call my self, and that Christ were for myself, and my self
a decourted cipher and a denied and forsworn thing! But that proud thing my
self, will not play except it ride up side for side with Christ, or rather have
place before him. O my self, another devil, as evil as the prince of devils, if
thou could give Christ the way and take thine own room, which is to sit as low
as nothing or corruption! O but we have much need to be ransomed and redeemed
by Christ from that master-tyrant, that cruel and lawless Lord, our self! Nay,
when I am seeking Christ and out of my self, I have the third part of a squint
eye upon that vain, vain thing, my self, my self, and something of mine own:
But I must hold here. I desire you to contribute your help, to see if I can be
restored to my wasted and lost flock: I see not how it can be; except the Lords
would procure me a liberty to preach; and they have reason: 1. Because the
opposers and my adversaries have practiced their new Canons upon me, whereof
one is, That no deprived Minister preach under the pain of excommunication. 2.
Because my opposing of these Canons was a special thing that incensed Sidserf
against me. 3. Because I was indicially accused for my book against the
Arminians, and commanded by the Chancellor to acknowledge I had done a fault
in writing against Dr Iackson, a wicked Arminian. Pray for a room in the house
to me. Grace, grace be, [as it is] your portion.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To JOHN STUART. Provest of Air, (146.)
Worthy Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long for the time when I shall see the
beauty of the Lord in his house, and would be as glad of it, as of any sight on
earth, to see the halt, the blind and the lame, come back to Zion with
supplications, Ier. 31, 8, 9. going and weeping and seeking the Lord, asking
the way to Zion with their faces thitherward Ier. 50. 5, 6. and to see the
woman traveling in birth, delivered of the man child, of a blessed
Reformation. If this land were humbled, I would look that our sky should clear
and our day dawn again, and ye should then bless Christ who is content to save
your travel, and to give himself to you in pure ordinances on this side of the
sea. I know, the mercy of Christ is engaged by promise to Scotland,
notwithstanding he bring wrath, as I fear he shall, upon this land. I am
waiting on for enlargement, and half content that my faith bow, if Christ while
he bow it, keep it unbroken; for who goes through a fire without a mark or a
scald. I see the Lord making use of this fire to scour his vessels from their
rust. Oh that my will were silent and as a child weaned from the breasts!
Psalm. 130. But alas, who has a heart that will give Christ the last word in
flyting, and will hear and not speak again? Oh contestations and quarrelous
replies [as a soon sadled spirit, I do well to be angry, even to the death,
Ion. 4: 9.] Smell of the stink of strong corruption! O blessed soul that could
sacrifice his will and go to heaven having lost his will and made resignation
of it to Christ! I would seek no more but that Christ were absolute King over
my will, and that my will were a sufferer in all crosses, without meeting
Christ with such a word, why is it thus? I wish still that my love had but
leave to stand beside beautiful Jesus, and to get the mercy of looking to him
and burning for him, suppose possession of him were suspended and fristed, till
my Lord fold together the leaves and two sides of the little shepherds tents of
clay. Oh what pain is in longing for Christ under an overclouded and eclipsed
assurance! What is harder then to burn and dwine with longings and deaths of
love, and then to have blanks and uninked paper for assurance of Christ in real
fruition or possession? O how sweet were one line or half a letter of a written
assurance under Christ's own hand! But this is our exercise daily, that
guiltiness shall overmist and darken assurance: It is a miracle to believe, but
for a sinner to believe is two miracles. But O what obligations of love are we
under to Christ, who bears with our wild apprehensions, in suffering them to
nickname sweet Jesus and to put a lie upon his good name! If he had not been
God; and if long-suffering in Christ were not like Christ himself, we should
long ago have broken Christ's mercies in two pieces, and put an iron bar upon
our own salvation, that mercy should not have been able to break or overleap;
but long-suffering in God, is God himself, and that is ou^ salvation, and the
stability of our heaven is in God: He knew (who said Christ in you the hope of
glory. Col. 1. 27. For our hope and the bottom and pillars of it is Christ-God]
sinners are anchor-fast and made stable in God: So that if God do not change
(which is impossible] then my hope shall not fluctuat. O sweet, stability of
su^e-bottomed salvation! Who could win heaven if this were not? and who could
be saved if God were not God, and if he were not such a God as he is? O God be
thanked that our Salvation is coasted and landed and shored upon Christ, who is
master of winds and storms! and what sea-winds can blow the coast or the land
out of it is place? Bulwarks are often casten down, but coasts are not removed;
but suppose that were, or might be, yet God cannot reel nor remove. Oh that we
go from this strong and unmovable Lord, and that we loose our selves (if it
were in our power) from him! Alas, our green and young love has not taken with
Christ, as being unacquainted with him: He is such a wide and broad and deep
and high and surpassing sweetness, that our love is too little for him: But O
if our love, little as it is, could take ba^d with his great and huge sweetness
and transcendent excellency! O thrice blessed and eternally blessed are they,
who are out of themselves and above themselves, that they may be in love united
to him! I am often rolling up and down the thoughts of my faint and sick
desires of expressing Christ's glory before his people; but I see not through
the throng of impediments, and cannot find eyes to look higher, and so I put
many things in Christ's way to hinder him, that I know he would but laugh at,
and with one stride set his foot over them all. I know not if my Lord will
bring me to his sanctuary or not; but I know he has the placing of me either
within or without the house, and that nothing will be done without him: But I
am often thinking and saying within my self, that my days flee away, and I see
no good, neither yet Christ's work thriving; and it is like the grave shall
prevent the answer of my desires of saving souls as I would: But alas I cannot
make right work of his ways, I neither spell nor read my Lord's providence
aright: My thoughts go a way, that I fear they meet not God; for it is like
God will not come the way of my thoughts: and I cannot be taught to crucify to
him my wisdom and desires, and to make him King over my thoughts; for I would
have a Princedom over my thoughts and would boldly and blindly prescribe to
God, and guide my self in a way of my own making: But I hold my peace here, let
him do his will. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his sweetest Lord and Master, S. R.

To CARSLUTH. (147)
Much honored Sir.
I Long to hear how your soul prospers. I earnestly desire you to try how
matters stand between your soul and the Lord: think it no easy matter to take
heaven by violence: Salvation comes now to the most part of men in a night
dream: there is no scarcity of faith now, such as it is; for ye shall not now
light upon the man, who will not say he has faith in Christ: But alas! dreams
make no man's rights. Worthy Sir, I beseech you in the Lord, give your soul no
rest till ye have real assurance and Christ's rights confirmed and sealed to
your soul: The common faith and countrey-holiness and week-day's zeal that is
among people, will never bring men to heaven: Take pains for your salvation,
for in that day when ye shall see many men's labors and conquests and
idol-riches lying in ashes, when the earth and all the works thereof shall be
burnt with fire, O how dear a price would your soul give for God's favor in
Christ! It is a blessed thing to seek Christ with up-sun, and to read over your
papers and soul-accounts with fair daylight: It will not be time to cry for a
lamp when the Bridegroom is entered into his chamber and the door shut. Fie, fie
upon blinded and base souls who are committing whoredom with this idol-clay and
hunting a poor wretched hungry heaven, a hungry breakfast, a day's meat, from
this hungry world, with the forfeiting of God's favor and the drinking over
their heaven over the board [as men use to speak] for the laughter and sports
of this short forenoon! All that is under this vault of heaven and betwixt us
and death, and in this side of sun and moon, are but toys, night-visions,
head-fancies, poor shadows, watery froth, godless vanities at their best, and
black hearts and salt and sour miseries sugared over and confected with an
hour's laughter or two and the conceit of riches, honor, vain, vain Court and
lawless pleasures. Sir, if ye look both to the laughing side and the weeping
side of this world, and if ye look not only upon the skin and color of
things, but in to their inwards and the heart of their excellency, ye shall see
that one look of Christ's sweet and lovely eye, one kiss of his fairest face,
is worth ten thousand worlds of such rotten stuff as the foolish sons of men
set their heart upon. Oh Sir, turn, turn your heart to the other side of
things, and get it once free of these entanglements, to consider Eternity,
Death, the clay-bed the Grave, awsom Judgment, everlasting burning quick in
Hell, where Death would give as great a price [if there were a Market where
Death might be bought and sold] as all the world. Consider heaven and glory:
But alas, why speak I of considering these things which have not entered into
the heart of man to consider? Look into these depths [without a bottom] of
loveliness, sweetness, beauty, excellency, glory, goodness, grace and mercy
that are in Christ, and ye shall then cry down the whole world and all the
glory of it, even when it is come to the summer-bloom, and ye shall cry up with
Christ, up with Christ's father, up with eternity of glory. Sir, there is a
great deal of less sand in your glas^ then when I saw you, and your afternoon
is nearer even-tide now then it was. As a flood carried back to the sea, so
does the Lord's swi^t post, Time, carry you and your life with wings to the
grave: Ye eat and drink, but Time stands not still; ye laugh, but your day
flees away, y^ sleep, but your hours are reckoned and put by hand. O how soon
will Time shut you out of the poor and cold and hungry Innes of this life! and
then what will yesterday's short-born pleasures do to you, but be as a
snow-ball melted away many years since, or worse; for the memory of these
pleasures uses to fill the soul wit^ bitterness: Time and experience will
prove thi^ to be true, and dying men, if they could speak, would make this
good: Lay no more on the creatures then they are able to carry: Lay your soul
and your weights upon God: Make him your only, only best beloved: Your errand
to this life is to make sure an eternity of glory to your soul, and to match
your soul with Christ: your love, if it were more then all the love of Angels
in one, is Christ's due: Other things worthy in themselves, in respect of
Christ are not worth a windlestraw, or a drink of cold water. I doubt not but
in death ye will see all things more distinctly, and that then the world shall
bear no more bulk then it is worth, and that then it shall couche and be
contracted into nothing, and ye shall see Christ longer, higher, broader and
deeper then ever he was. O blessed conquest to lose all things and to gain
Christ! I know not what ye have if ye want Christ: Alas, how poor is your gain
if the earth were all yours in f^ee heritage, holding it of no man of clay, if
Christ be not yours? O seek all midses, lay all oars in the water, put forth
all your power, and bend all your endeavors to put away and part with all
things, that ye may gain and enjoy Christ: try and search his word, and stri^e
to go a step above and beyond ordinary professors, and resolve to sweat more
and run faster then they do for Salvation: men's midway, cold and wise courses
in godliness, and their neighbour-li^e cold and wise pace to heaven, will cause
many a man want his lodging at night and li^ in the fields. I recommend Christ
and his love to your seeking, and yourself to the tender mercy and rich grace
of our Lord. Remember my love in Christ to your wife: I desire her to learn to
make her soul's anchor fast upon Christ himself: Few are saved: Let her
consider what jo^ the smiles of God in Christ will be, and what the love-kisses
of sweet, sweet Jesus, and a welcome home to the new Jerusalem from Christ's
own mouth, will be to her soul; when Christ shall fold together the clay tent
of her body and lay it by his hand for a time, till the fair morning of the
general resurrection. I avouch before God, man and Angel, that I have not
seen, nor can imagine a lover to be comparable to lovely Jesus: I would not
exchange or niffer him with ten heavens: If heaven could be without him, what
could we do there. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your soul's eternal wellwisher, S. R.

To CASSINCARRIE. (148.)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have been too long in writing to you. I am
confident ye have learned to prize Christ and his love and favor more then
ordinary professors, who scarce see Christ with half an eye, because their
sight is taken up with eying and liking the beauty of this over-guileded world
that promises fair to all it is lovers, but in the push of a trial when need
is, can give nothing but a fair beguile. I know ye are not ignorant that men
come not to this world as some do to a market, to see and be seen, or as some
come to behold a May Game, and only to behold and to go home again: Ye came
hither to treat with God and to tryst with him in his Christ, for salvation to
your soul, and to seek reconcilation with an angry and wrathful God in a
covenant of peace made to you in Christ, and this is more then an ordinary
sport or the play that the greatest part of the world give their heart unto:
And therefore, Worthy Sir, I pray you by the salvation of your soul and by the
mercy of God and your compearence before Christ, do this in sad earnest, and
let not salvation be your by-work or your holy-day's task only, or a work by
the way: For men think that this may be done in three days space on a
feather-bed, when death and they are fallen in hands together, and that with a
word or two they shall make their soul-matters right: Alas, this is to ^it
loose and unsure in the matters of our salvation: Nay, the seeking of this
world and the glory of it, is but an odd and by-errand that we may slip,
sobeing we make salvation sure. Oh when will men learn to be that heavenly wise
as to divorce from and free their soul of all Idol-lovers, and make Christ the
only only One, and trim and make ready their lamps while they have time and
day! How soon will this house skail and the Innes where the poor soul lodges
fall to the earth! How soon will some few years pass away, and then when the
day is ended and this life's lease expired, what have men of world's glory, but
dreams and thoughts? O how blessed a thing is it to labor for Christ and to
make him sure! Know and try in time your holding of him and the rights and
charters of heaven, and upon what terms ye have Christ and the Gospel, and what
Christ is worth in your estimation, and how lightly ye esteem of other things
and how dearly of Christ! I am sure if ye see him in his beauty and glory, ye
shall see him to be all things, and that incomparable jewel of gold that ye
should seek, howbeit ye should sell, wod-set and forfeit your few years portion
of this life's joys. O happy soul for evermore who can rightly compare this
life with that long-lasting life to come, and can balance the weighty glory of
the one, with the light golden vanity of the other! The day of the Lord is now
near hand, and all me^ shall come out in their black's and white's as they are:
There shall be no borrowed lying colors in that day, when Christ shall be
called Christ and no longer nicknamed: now men borrow Christ and his white
color and the luster and fairding of Christianity; but how many counterfeit
masks will be burnt in the day of God, in the fire, that shall burn the earth
and the works that are in it: And howbeit Christ have the hardest part of it
now, yet in the presence of my Lord whom I serve in the spirit, I would not
niffer or exchange Christ's prison, bands and chains, with the gold chains and
Lordly rents, and smiling and happy-like heavens of the men of this world. I am
far from thoughts of repenting because of my losses and bonds for Christ, I
wish all my adversaries were as I am except my bonds. Worthy, worthy, worthy
for evermore is Christ, for whom we should suffer pains like hell's pains, far
more the short hell that the saints of God have in this life. Sir, I wish your
soul may be more acquainted with the sweetness of Christ. Grace, grace be with
you.

Abord. 1637. Yours in his only Lord and Master, S. R.

To his Parishoners at Anwoth. (149).
Dearly beloved in our Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace from God our father and from our Lord Jesus Christ be
multiplied upon you: I long exceedingly to hear of your on-going and
advancement in your journey to the Kingdom of God: My only joy out of heaven
is, to hear that the seed of God sown among you is growing and coming to an
harvest; for I ceased not while I was among you, in season and out of season
[according to the measure of grace given unto me] to warn and stir up your
minds, and I am free from the blood of all men, for I have communicated to you
the whole counsel of God: And I now again charge and warn you in the great and
dreadful name, and in the sovereign authority of the King of Kings and Lord of
Lords; and I beseech you also by the mercies of God, and by the bowels of
Christ, by your appearance before Christ Jesus our Lord, by all the plagues
that are written in God's book, by your part of the holy city, the new
Jerusalem, that ye keep the truth of God as I delivered it to you, before many
witnesses, in the sight of God and his holy Angels; for now the last days are
come and coming when many forsake Christ Jesus, and he says to you, will ye
also leave me? Remember that I forewarned you to forbear the dishor ouring of
the Lord's blessed name, in swearing, b^^spheming, cursing, And the prefaning
of the Lord's sabbath; willing you to give that day from morning to night to
praying, praising, hearing of the word, conferring, and speaking not your own
words but God's word, thinking and meditating on God's nature, word and works;
And that every day at morning and at right [at least] ye should sanctify the
Lord by praying in your houses publicly in the hearing of all; that ye should
in any sort forbear the receiving of the Lord's supper, but after the form that
I delivered it to you, according to the example of Christ our Lord, that is,
that ye should sit as banquetters, at one table with our King, and eat and
drink, and divide the elements one to another: The timber and stones of the
church walls shall bear witness that my soul was refreshed with the comforts of
God in that supper; and that crossing in baptism was unlawful and against
Christ's ordinances; And that no day [besides the sabbath which is of his own
appointment] should be kept holy, and sanctified with preaching and the public
worship of God for the memory of Christ's birth, death, resurrection and
ascension; seeing such days so observed are unlawful, will worship, and not
warranted in Christ's word; And that every thing in God's worship not warranted
by Christ's Testament and word, was unlawful; And also, that Idolatry,
worshipping of God before hallowed creatures, and adoring of Christ by kneeling
before bread and wine was unlawful; And that ye should be humble, sober,
modest, forbearing pride, envy, malice, wrath, hatred, contentim, debate,
lying, slandering, stealing, and defrauding your neighbors in grass, corn or
cattle, in buying or selling, borrowing or lending, taking or giving, in
bargains or covenants; And that ye should work with your own hands, and be
content with that which God has given you; That ye should study to know God
and his will, and keep in mind the doctrine of the Catechism which I taught
you carefully, and speak of it in your houses and in the fields, when ye lie
down at night, and when ye rise in the morning; That ye should believe in the
Son of God and obey his commandments, and learn to make your accounts in time
with your judge, because death and judgment are before you: And if ye have now
penury and want of that word which I delivered to you in abundance; yea [to
God's honor I speak it, without arrogating any thing to my self, who am but a
poor empty man] ye had as much of the word in nine years while I was among you,
as some others have had in many. Mourn for your loss of time and repent: My
soul pitieth you that ye should suck dry breasts, and be put to draw at dry
wells. O that ye would esteem highly of the lamb of God, your welbeloved Christ
Jesus, whose virtues and praises I preached unto you with joy, and which he did
countenance and accompany with some power; and that ye would call to mind the
many fair days and glorious feasts in our Lord's house of wine, that ye and I
have have had with Christ Jesus! But if there be any among you that take
liberty to sin, because I am removed from amongst you, and forget that word of
truth which ye heard, and turn the grace of God into wantoness; I here under my
hand in the name of Christ my Lord, write to such persons all the plagues of
God and the curses that ever I preached in the pulpit of Anwoth against the
childrens of disobedience: And as the Lord lives the Lord Jesus shall make
good what I write unto you: Therefore, Dearly beloved, fulfill my joy: Fear the
great and dreadful name of the Lord: seek God with me, Scotland's judgment
sleeps not, awake and repent: the sword of the Lord shall go from the North
to the South, from the East to the West and through all the corners of the
land, and that sword shall be drunk with your blood amongst the first; and I
shall stand up as witness against you, if ye do not amend your ways and your
doings, and turn to the Lord, with all your heart: I beseech you also my
beloved in the Lord, my joy and my Crown, offend not at the sufferings of me,
the prisoner of Jesus Christ; I am filled with joy and with the comforts of
God: Upon my salvation I know and am persuaded it is for God's Truth and the
Honor of my King and Royal Prince Jesus I now suffer: and howbeit this town
be my prison, yet Christ has made it my palace, a garden of pleasures, a field
and orchard of delights: I know likewise albeit I be in bonds, that yet the
word of God is not in bonds, my spirit also is in free ward: Sweet, svveet have
his comforts been to my soul: my pen, tongue and heart have not words to
express the kindness, love and mercy of my vvelbeloved to me in this house of
my pilgrimage. I charge you to fear and love Christ, and to seek a house not
made with hands, but your father's house above: This laughing and white
skinned world beguileth you; and if ye seek it more then God, it shall play you
a slip, to the endless sorrow of your heart: Alas, I could not make many of you
fall in love with Christ, howbeit I endeavored to speak much good of him, and
to commend him to you [which as it was your sin, so it is my sorrow] yet once
again suffer me to exhort, beseech and obtest you in the Lord, to think of his
love and to be delighted with him, who is altogether lovely: I give you the
word of a King ye shall not repent it: ye are in my prayers night and day, I
cannot forget you: I do not eat, I do not drink, but I pray for you all: I
entreat you all and every one of you to pray for me. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. Sept. 23. 1636. Your lawful and loving Pastor, S. R.

To the Lady CARDONNESS. [150]
MISTRESS.
I Beseech you in the Lord Jesus make every day more and more of Christ, and
try your growth in the grace of God, and what new ground ye win daily on
corruption; for travelers are day by day either advancing further on, and
nearer home, or else they go not right about to compass their journey: I think
still the better and better of Christ: Alas I know not where to set him, I
would so fain have him high! I cannot set heavens above heavens till I were
tired with numbering, and set him upon the highest step and story of the
highest of them all: But I wish I could make him great through the world,
suppose my loss and pain and shame were set under the soles of his feet, that
he might stand upon me. I request you faint not because this world and ye are
at yea and nay, and because this is not a home that laugheth upon you, The wise
Lord who knows you will have it so, because he casts a net for your love to
catch it and gather it in to himself; therefore bear patiently the loss of
children and burdens and other discontentments either within or without the
house: Your Lord in them is seeking you, and seek ye him: Let none be your love
and choice, and the flower of your delights but your Lord Jesus: Set not your
heart upon the world, since God has not made it your portion; for it will not
fall you to get two portions, and to laugh twice, and to be happy twice, and to
have an upper-heaven and an under-heaven too: Christ our Lord and his saints
were not so; and therefore let go your grip of this life and of the good
things of it: I hope your heaven grows not hereaway: Learn daily both to
possess and miss Christ in his secret bridegroom-smiles: He must go and come
because his infinite wisdom thinks it best for you: we will be together one
day: We shall not need to borrow light from sun, moon or candle: There shall be
no complaints on eiher side in heaven: There shall be none there but He and we,
the bridegroom and the bride; Devils, temptations, trials, desertions, losses,
sad hearts, pain and death shall all be put out of play, and the Devil must
give up his office of Tempting: O blessed is the soul whose hope has a face
looking straight out to that day! It is not our part to make a treasure here:
Any thing under the covering of heaven we can build upon, is but ill ground,
and a sandy foundation: Every good thing except God wants a bottom, and
cannot stand it is alone; how then can it bear the weight of us? Let us not lay
a load upon a windlestraw, there shall nothing find my weight or found my
happiness, but God: I know all created power should sink under me, if I should
lean down upon it; and therefore it is better to rest on God then sink or fall:
and we weak souls must have a bottom and being-place; for we cannot stand our
alone: let us then be wise in our choice, and choose and wail our own
blessedness, which is to trust in the Lord: Each one of us has a whore and
idol besides our husbend Christ: But it is our folly to divide our narrow and
little love: It will not serve two, best then hold it whole and together, and
give it to Christ; for then we get double interest for our love, when we lend
it to, and lay it out upon Christ, and we are sure besides, that the stock
cannot perish. Now, I can say no more, remember me: I have God's right to that
people; howbeit by the violence of men, stronger then I, I am banished from you
and chased away: The Lord give you mercy in the day of Christ: It may be God
clear my sky again; howbeit there is small appearance of my deliverance: But
let him do with me what seems good in his own eyes: I am his clay, let my
porter frame and fashion me as he pleases. Grace be with you,

Aberd. 1637. Your lawful and loving Pastor, S. R.

To SIBILLA Mc ADAM. (151)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I can bear witness in my bonds that Christ
is still the longer the better, and no worse, yea, inconceivably better then he
is, or can be called: I think it half an heaven to have my fill of the sm^ll of
his sweet breath, and to sleep in the arms of Christ my Lord with his left hand
under my head, and his right hand embracing me: There is no great reckoning to
be made of the withering of my flower, in comparison of the foul and manifest
wrongs done to Christ: Nay, let never the dew of God lie upon my branches
again, let the bloom fall from my joy and let it wither, let the Almighty blow
out my candle; sobeing the Lord might be great among Jews and Gentiles, and his
oppressed church delivered: Let Christ fare well, suppose I should eat ashes: I
know he must be sweet himself, when his cross is so sweet: And it is the part
of us all, if we marry Himself, to marry the crosses, losses, and reproaches
also that follow him; for mercy follows Christ's cross: His prison for beauty
is made of marble and ivory, his chains that are laid on his prisoners are
golden chains, and the fighes of the prisoners of hope are perfumes with
comforts, the like whereof cannot be bred of found in this side of sun and
moon: Follow on after his love, ^ire not of Christ; but come in and see his
beauty and excellency, and feed your soul upon Christ's sweetness: This world
is not yours, neither would I have your heaven made of such metal as mire and
clay: Ye have the choice and wail of all lovers in heaven or out of heaven
when ye have Christ, the only delight of God his father: Climb up the mountain
with joy and faint not; for time will cut off, the men who pursue Christ's
followers: Our best things here have a worm in them: Our joys besides God; in
the inner half are but woes and sorrows: Christ, Christ is that which our love
and desires, can sleep sweetly and rest safely upon. Now, the very God of peace
establish you in Christ: Help a prisoner with your prayers, and entreat that
our Lord would be pleased to visit me with a fight of his beauty in his house,
as he has sometimes done. Grace, be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To the Lord of CALLY. (152)
Worthy Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have been too long I confess in writing to
you. My suit now to you in paper [since I have no access to speak to you as
formerly] is, that ye would lay the foundation sure in your youth: When ye
begin to seek Christ, try I pray you upon what terms ye covenant to follow him,
and lay your accounts what it may cost you; that summer nor winter, nor well
nor woe, may not, cause you change your master, Christ: Keep fair to him and be
honest and faithful that he find not a crack in you. Surely ye are now in the
throng of temptations: When youth is come to it is fairest bloom, then the Devil
and the lusts of a deceiving world and sin are upon horseback and follow with
up sails: If this were not, Paul needed not to have written to a sanctified and
holy youth Timothy [a faithful preacher of the Gospel] flee the lusts of
youth. Give Christ your virgin-love, ye cannot put your love and heart in a
better hand. O if ye knew him and saw his beauty! Your love, your liking, your
heart, your desires would close with him and cleave to him. Love by nature when
it sees, cannot but cast out it is spirit and strength upon amiable objects and
good things and things love-worthy: and what fairer thing then Christ? O fair
sun and fair moon and fair stars, and fair flowers and fair roses and fair
lilies, and fair creatures; but O ten thousand thousand times fairer Lord
Jesus! Alas, I wronged him in making the comparison this way! O black sun and
moon, but O fair Lord Jesus! O black flowers and black lilies and roses, but O
fair, fair, ever fair Lord Jesus! O all fair things, black and deformed without
beauty, when ye are beside that fairest Lord Jesus! O black heaven, but O fair
Christ! O black Angels, but O surpassingly fair Lord Jesus! I would seek no
more to make me happy for evermore, but a through and clear sight of the beauty
of Jesus my Lord: Let my eyes enjoy his fairness and store him for ever in the
face, and I have all that can be wished. Get Christ rather then gold or silver,
seek Christ howbeit ye should lose all things for him: They take their marks by
the moon and look asquint in looking to fair Christ, who resolve for the world
and their ease, and for their honor and court and credit, or for fear of
losses and a sore skin that they will turn their back upon Christ and his
truth. Alas, how many blind eyes and squint-lookers look this day in Scotland
upon Christ's beauty, and they see a spot in Christ's fair face! Alas, they are
not worthy of Christ who look this way upon him, and see no beauty in him why
they should desire him! God send me my fill of his beauty, if it be possible
that my soul can be full of his beauty here: But much of Christ's beauty
needs not abate the eager appetite of a soul [sick of love for himself] to
see him in the other world, where he is seen as he is. I am glad with all my
heart that ye have given your greenest morning age to this Lord Jesus: Hold on
and weary not, faint not, resolve upon suffering for Christ, but fear not ten
days tribulation, for Christ's sour cross is sugared with comforts and has a
taste of Christ himself. I esteem it my glory, my joy and my crown, and I bless
him for this honor, to be yoked with Christ and married with him in suffering,
who therefore was born and therefore came into the world that he might bear
witness to the truth. Take pains above all things for salvation, for without
running, fighting, sweating, wrestling, heaven is not taken. O happy soul, that
crosses nature's stomach, and delights to gain that fair garland and crown
of glory! What a feckless loss is it for you to go through this wilderness and
never taste of sin's sugared pleasures! What poorer is a soul to want pride,
lust, love of the world and the vanities of this vain and worthless world!
Nature has no cause to weep at the want of such toys as these. Esteem it your
gain to be an heir of glory, O but that is an eye-look to a fair rent! The very
hope of heaven under troubles, is like wind and sails to the soul, and like
wings when the feet come out of the share. O for what stay we here! Up, up,
after our Lord Jesus, this is not our rest nor our dwelling: What have we to
do in this prison, except only to take meat and house-room in it for a time?
Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your soul's welwisher and Christ prisoner, S. R.

To WILLIAM GORDON. At Kenmure. (153
Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have been long in answering your letter,
which came in good time to me. It is my aim and hearty desire that my furnace,
which is of the Lord's kindling, may sparkle fire upon standers by, to the
warming of their hearts with God's love. The very dust that falls from
Christ's feet, his old ragged clothes, his knotty and black cross, is sweeter
to me then Kings golden crowns and their time-eaten pleasures: I should be a
liar and false witness, if I should not give my Lord Jesus a fair testimonial
with my whole soul: my word I know will not heighten him, he needs not such
props under his feet to raise his glory high: But Oh that I could raise him the
height of heaven and the breadth and length often heavens in the estimation of
all his young lovers! for we have all shapen Christ but too narrow and too
short, and formed conceptions of his love in our conceit very unworthy of it.
Oh that men were taken and catched with his beauty and fairness! They would
give over playing with idols, in which there is not halfroom for the love of
one soul to exspatiat itself, and man's love is but heart-hungered in gnawing
upon bare bones and sucking at dry breasts: It is well wared they want who will
not come to him who has a world of love and goodness and bounty for all. We
seek to thawe our frozen hearts at the cold smoke of the short-timed creature,
and our souls gather neither heat nor life nor light, for these cannot give to
us what they have not in themselves. Oh that we could thrust in through these
thorns and this throng of bastardlovers, and be ravished and sick of love for
Christ! We should sinde some footing and some room and sweet ease for our
tottering and wirless souls in our Lord. I wish it were in my power after this
day, to cry down all love but the love of Christ, and to cry down all Gods but
Christ, all Saviors but Christ, all welbeloveds but Christ, and all
soul-suters, all love-beggers but Christ. Ye complain that ye want a mark of
the sound work of grace and love in your soul. For answer, consider for your
satisfaction (till God send more) 1. Ioh. 3: 14. And as for your complaint of
Deadness and Doubtings, Christ I hope will take your deadness and you together:
They are bodies full of holes, running boils, and broken bones that need
mending, that Christ the Physician takes up: whole vessels are not for the
Mediator Christ's art: Publicans, sinners, whores, harlots, are ready
market-wares for Christ: The only thing that will bring sinners within a cast
of Christ's drawing arm, is, that which ye write of, some feeling of death and
Sin that brings forth complaints: and therefore out of sense complain more,
and be more acquaint with all the cramps, stitches and soul-swoonings that
trouble you: The more pain and the more night-watching and the more fevers, the
better: A soul bleeding to death till Christ were sent for and cried for in all
haste to come and stem the blood and close up the hole in the wound, with his
own hand and balm, were a very good disease when many are dying of a whole
heart. We have all too little of hell-pain and terrors that way: Nay, God send
mesuch a hell as Christ has promised to make a heaven out of. Alas, I am not
come that far on in the way as to say in sad earnest, Lord Jesus, great and
sovereign Physician, here is a pained patient for thee. But the thing that we
mistake, is the want of victory, we hold that to be the mark of one that has
no grace: Nay, I say, the want of fighting were a mark of no grace, but I shall
not say, the want of victory is such a mark. If my fire and the Devil's water
make crackling like thunder in the air, I am the less feared; for where there
is fire, it is Christ's part that I lay and bind upon him to keep in the coal,
and to pray the father that my faith fail not, if I in the mean time be
wrestling and doing and sighing and mourning: For prayer puts not Paul's
devil [the prick in the flesh and the messenger of Satan] to the door at first,
but our Lord will have them trying every one another and let Paul send himself
by God's help, God keeping the stakes and moderating the play: And ye do well
not to doubt if the ground-stone be sure, but to try if it be so, for there is
great ods between doubting that we have grace and trying if we have grace: the
former may be sin, but the latter is good. We are but loose in trying our
free-holding of Christ and making sure work of Christ: Holy fear is a searching
the camp that there be no enemy within our bosom to betray us, and a seeing
that all be fast and sure: For I see many lecking vessels fair before the wind,
and professors who take their conversion upon trust, and they go on securely
and see not to the under-water till a storm sink them: Each man had need twice
a day and oftener, to be ryped and searched with candles. pray for me that the
Lord would give me house-room again to hold a candle to this dark world. Grace,
grace be with you.

To MARGARET FULLERTON. (154)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am glad that ever ye did cast your love on
Christ, fasten more and more love every day upon him. O if I had a river of
love, a sea of love that would never go dry, to bestow upon him! But alas the
pity, Christ has beauty for me, but I have not love for him. O what pain is it
to see Christ in his beauty, and then to want a heart and love for him! But I
see, want we must, till Christ lend us, never to be paid again. O that he
would empty these vaults and lower houses of these poor souls, of these bastard
and base lovers which we follow! And verily I see no object in heaven or in
earth that I could ware this much of love upon that I have, but upon Christ.
Alas that clay and time and shadows run away with our love, which is ill spent
upon any but upon Christ: each fool at the day of judgment shall seek back his
love from the creatures, when he shall see them all in a fair fire, but they
shall prove irresponsall debtors: And therefore best here look ere we leap, and
look ere we love. I find now under his cross that I would fain give him more
then I have to give him, if giving were in my power: But I rather wish him my
heart then give him it, except he take it and put himself in possession of it
[for I hope he has a market-right to me, since he has ransomed me] I see not
how Christ can have me. O that he would be pleased to be more homely with my
soul's love, and to come in to my soul and take his own! But when he goes away
and hides himself, all is to me that I had of Christ, as if it had fallen in
the seabottom. Oh that I should be so fickle in my love, as to love Christ
only by the eyes and the nose! That is, to love him only in as far as fond
and foolish sense carries me and no more: And when I see not, and smell not,
and touch not, then I have all to seek. I cannot love parquier, nor rejoice
parquier: But this is our weakness till we be at home and shall have aged men's
stomachs to bear Christ's love. Pray for me, that our Lord would bring me back
to you with a new blessing of the Gospel of Christ. I forget not you. Grace.
grace be with you.

Dear Brother.
YE are heartily welcome to that honor that Christ has made common to us
both, which is to suffer for his name: Verily I think it my garland and crown,
and if the Lord should ask of me my blood and life for this cause, I would
gladly in his strength pay due debt to Christ's honor and glory in that kind.
Acquaint your self with Christ's love and ye shall not miss to find new golden
mines and treasures in Christ: Nay truly, we but stand beside Christ, we go
not in to him to take our fill of him. But if he should do two things, 1. Draw
the curtains and make bare his holy face, and then 2. Clear our dim and bleared
eyes to see his beauty and glory, he should find many lovers. I would seek no
more happiness but a sight of him so near hand as to see, hear, smell, and
touch and embrace him: But oh, closed doors and vails and curtains and thick
clouds hold me in pain while I find the sweet burning of his love that many
waters cannot quench! O what sad hours have I when I think, that love of Christ
scarreth at me and blows by me! If my Lord Jesus would come to bargaining for
his love, I think he should make price himself, I should not refuse ten
thousand years in hell, to have a wide soul enlarged and made wider, that I
might be exceedingly [even to the running over] filled with his love. O what am
I to love such an one, or to be loved by that high and lofty One! I think the
Angels may blush to look upon him, and what am I to file such infinite
brightness with my sinful eyes? O that Christ would come near and stand still
and give me leave to look upon him! For to look seems the poor man's
privilege, since he may for nothing and without hire behold the sun. I should
have a King's life, if I had no other thing to do, but for evermore to behold
and eye my fair Lord Jesus: Nay, suppose I were holden out, at heaven's fair
entry, I should be happy for evermore to look through an hole in the door and
see my dearest and fairest Lord's face. O great King, why stand thou aloof?
Why remainest thou beyond the mountains? O welbeloved, why do thou pain a
poor soul with delays? a long time out of thy glorious presence is two deaths
and two hells to me; We must meet, I must see him, I dow not want him: hunger
and longing for Christ has brought on such a necessity of enjoying Christ,
that cost me what it will, I cannot but assure Christ, I will not, I dow not
want him: For I cannot master or command Christ's love: nay, hell [as I now
think] and all the pains in it laid on me alone, would not put me from loving:
Yea, suppose my Lord Jesus would not love me, it is above my strength or power
to keep back or imprison the weak love I have, but it must be out to Christ: I
would set heaven's joy aside, and live upon Christ's love it is alone: Let me
have no joy but the warmness and fire of God's love, I seek no other: God
knows, if this love be taken from me, the bottom is fallen out of all my
happiness and joy; and therefore I believe, Christ will never do me that, as
to bereave a poor prisoner of his love, it were cruelty to take it from me, and
he who is kindness it self cannot be cruel. Dear Brother, weary not of my sweet
Master's chains, we are so much the sibber to Christ that we suffer: Lodge not
a hard thought of my royal King: rejoice in his cross: Your deliverance
sleeps not, he that will come is not slack of his promise: Wait on for God's
timeous salvation, ask not when or How long? I hope he shall lose nothing of
you in the furnace, but dross: Commit your cause in meekness [forgiving your
oppressours] to God, and your sentence shall come back from him laughing: Our
Bridegroom's day is posting fast on, and this world, that seems to go with a
long and a short foot, shall be put in two ranks: Wait till your ten days be
ended and hope for the crown, Christ will not give you a blind in the end.
Commend me to your wife and father, and to Bailiffe M. A. And send this letter
to him. The prayers of Christ's prisoner be upon you, and the Lord's presence
accompany you.

To ROBERT LENNO X. of Disdove. (156.)
Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I beseech you in the Lord Jesus make fast
and sure work of life eternal: Sow not rotten seed, every man's work will
speak for it self what his seed has been. O how many see I, who sow to the
flesh! Alas what a crop will that be, when the Lord shall put in his hook to
reap this world, that is ripe and white for judgment. I recommend to you
holiness and sanctification, and that ye keep your self clean from this present
evil world: We delight to tell our own dreams, and to flatter our own flesh
with the hope we have: It were wisdom for us to be free, plain, honest and
sharp with our own souls, and to charge them to brew better, that they may
drink well and fare well, when time is melted away like snow in a hot summer. O
how hard a thing is it to get the soul to give up with all things on this side
of death and doomsday! We say we are removing and going from this world; but
our heart stirs not one foot off it is seat. Alas I see few heavenly minded
souls that have nothing upon the earth, but their body of clay going up and
down this earth, because their soul and the powers of it are up in heaven, and
there, their hearts live, desire, enjoy, rejoice. Oh men's souls have no wings,
and therefore night and day they keep their nest and are not acquaint with
Christ! Sir, take you to your one thing, to Christ, that ye may be acquainted
with the taste of his sweetness and excellency, and charge your love not to
dote upon this world; for it will not do your business in that day, when
nothing will come in good stead to you, but God's favor: Build upon Christ
some good, choice and fast work; for when your soul for many years has taken
the play and has posted and wandered through the creatures ye will come home
again with the wind: They are not good, at least not the souls good, it is the
infinite Godhead that must allay the sharpness of your hunger after happiness:
otherwise there shall still be a want of satisfaction to your desires: And if
he would cast in ten worlds in your desires, all shall fall through, and your
soul shall still cry red hunger, black hunger: But I am sure there is
sufficient for you in Christ, if ye had seven souls and seven desires in you.
Oh if I could make my Lord Jesus market-sweet, lovely desirable and fair to
all the world both to Jew and Gentil! O let my part of heaven go for it,
sobeing he would take my tongue to be his instrument, to set out Christ in his
whole braveries of love, virtue, grace, sweetness and matchless glory, to the
eyes and hearts of Jews and Gentiles! But who is sufficient for these things? O
for the help of Angels tongues to make Christ eye-sweet and amiable to many
thousands! O how little does this world see of him, and how far are they from
the love of him, seeing there is so much loveliness, beauty and sweetness in
Christ that no created eye did ever yet see! I would that all men knew his
glory, and that I could put many in at the bridegroom's chamber door to see his
beauty, and to be partakers of his high and deep and broad and boundless love.
O let all the world come nigh and see Christ, and they shall then see more then
I can say of him! O if I had had a pledge or pawn to lay down for a sea-full
of his love! that I could come by so much of Christ, as would satisfy griening
and longing for him, or rather increase it, till I were in full possession! I
know we shall meet and therein I rejoice. Sir, stand fast in the truth of
Christ, that ye have received: Yield not to winds, but ride out and let Christ
be your anchor and the only He, whom ye shall look to see in peace: Pray for
me his prisoner, and that the Lord would send me among you to feed his people.
Grace, grace be with you.

To JOHN FLEMING Bailiffe of Leith. (157)
Worthy Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: The Lord has brought me safe to this
strange town: Blessed be his holy name, I find his cross easy and light, and
I hope he shall be with his poor sold Joseph, who is separated from his
brethren: His comforts have abounded toward me, as if Christ thought shame [if
I may speak so] to be in the common of such a poor man as I am, and would not
have me lose any thing in his errands: My enemies have, beside their intention,
made me more blessed, and have put me in a sweeter possession of Christ, then
ever I had before: Only the memory of the fair days I had with my welbeloved
amongst the flock entrusted to me, keeps me low, and sowreth my unseen joy:
But it must be so, and he is wise who tutoureth me this way: For that which my
brethren have and I want, and others of this world have, I am content, my faith
will frist God my happiness: No Son offends that his father gives him not
hire twice a year, for he is to abide in the house, when the inheritance is to
be divided: It is better God's children live upon hope then upon hire. Thus
remembering my love to your worthy and kind wife: I bless you and her and all
yours in the Lord's name.

To WILLIAM GLENDINING. Bailiffe of Kirkcudbright. [158]
Worthy Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am well, honor be to God, and as well as a
r^joycing prisoner of Christ can be, hoping that one day He for whom I now
suffer shall enlarge me, and put me above the threatenings of men: I am
sometimes sad, heavy and casten down at the memory of the fair days I had with
Christ in Anwoth, Kirk cudbright and cet: The remembrance of a feast increases
hunger in a hungry man; but who knows but our Lord will yet cover a table in
the wilderness to his hungry bairns and build the old waste places in Scotland,
and bring home Zion's captives: I desire to see no more glorious sight, till I
see the Lamb on his throne, then to see Mount Zion all green with grass, and
the dew lying upon the tops of the grass, and the crown put upon Christ's head
in Scotland again: And I believe it shall be so, and that Christ shall mow
down his enemies and fill the pits with their dead bodies. I find people here
dry and uncouth: A man pointed at for suffering dare not be countenanced; so
that I am like to sit mine alone upon the ground: But my Lord pays me well
home again, for I have neither tongue nor pen nor heart to express the
sweetness and excellency of the love of Christ: Christ's honey-combs drop honey
and sloods of consolation upon my soul: My chains are gold: Christ's cross i^
all overguilded and perfumed: His prison is the garden and orchard of my
delights: I would go through burning quick to my lovely Christ: I sleep in his
arms all the night and my head betwixt his breasts: My welbeloved is altogether
lovely: This is all nothing to that which my soul has felt: Let no man for my
cause scar at Christ's cross: If my stipend, place, country, credit, had been
an Earledom, a Kingdom, ten Kingdoms and a whole earth, all were too little for
the crown and scepter of my royal King: Mine enemies, mine enemies have made
me blessed: They ave sent me to the bridegroom's chamber: Love is his banner
over me: I live a Kings life: I want nothing but heaven, and the possession of
the crown, my earnest is great, Christ is no niggard to me. Dear Brother, be
for the Lord Jesus and his heart-broken bride. I need not [I hope] remember my
distressed brother to your care. Remember my love to your wife. Let Christ want
nothing of us: His garments shall be rolled in the blood of the slain of
Scotland. Grace, grace be with you: pray for Christ's prisoner.

Aberd. Sept. 21. 1637 Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To ROBERT GORDON. Of Knockbrex. (159]
Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am by God's mercy come now to Aberden, the
place of my confinement, and settled in an honest man's house: I find the
town's-men cold and general and dry in their kindness, yet I find a lodging
in the heart of many strangers: My challenges are revived again, and I find
old sores bleeding of new; so dangerous and painful is an undercotted
conscience; yet I have an eye to the blood that is physic for such sores: But
verily I see Christianity is conceived to be more easy and lighter then it is;
so that I sometimes think I never knew any thing, but the letters of that name;
for our nature contenteth it self with little in godliness. Our Lord, Lord,
seems to us ten Lord Lords: little holiness in our balance is much because
it is our own hol^ness, and we love to lay small burdens upon our soft natures,
and to make a fair courtway to heaven: And I know it were necessary to take
more pains then we do, and not to make heaven a city more easily taken then
God has made it: I persuade my self many runners shall come short and get a
disappointment. Oh how easy is it to deceive our selves, and to sleep and wish
that heaven may fall down in our laps! Yet for all my Lord's glooms I find him
sweet, gracious, loving, kind, and I want both pen and words to set forth the
fairness, beauty and sweetness of Christ's love, and the honor of this cross
of Christ, which is glorious to me, though the world thinks shame thereof: I
verily think that the cross of Christ would blush and think shame of these
thin-skined worldlings, who are so married to their credit that they are
ashamed of the sufferings of Christ. O the honor to be scourged, stoned with
Christ, and to go through a furious-faced death to life eternal! But men
would have Lawborrows against Christ's cross. Now, My dear Brother forget not
the prisoner of Christ; for I see very few here who kindly fear God. Grace be
with you. Let my love in Christ and hearty affection be remembered to your kind
wife, to your Brother John and to all friends. The Lord Jesus be with your
Spirit.

Abed. Sept. 20. 1636. Yours in his only, only Lord Jesus, S. R.

To EARLESTOWN Younger. 160.
Much Honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am well, Christ triumphs in me, blessed
be his name: I have all things, I burden no man: I see this earth and the
fullness thereof is my father's: sweet, sweet is the cross of my Lord: The
blessing of God upon the cross of my Lord Jesus: My enemies have contributed
[beside their designe] to make me blessed: This is my palace, not my prison,
especially, when my Lord shines and smileth upon his poor afflicted and sold
Joseph, who is separated from his brethen: But often he hides himself, and
there is a day of law, and court of challenges within me; I know not if fenced
in God's name, but Oh my neglects! Oh my unseen guiltiness! I imagined that a
sufferer for Christ kept The keys of Christ's treasure, and might take out his
womb-full of comforts when he pleased; but I see a sufferer and witness will be
holden at the door as well as another poor sinner, and be glad to eat with the
bairns and to take the by-board. This cross has let me see that heaven is not
at the next door and that it is a castle not soon taken: I see also, it is
neither pain nor art to play the hyprocrite: We have all learned to sell our
selves for double price and to make the people who call ten twenty, and twenty
an hundred esteem us half-gods, or men fallen out of the clouds: But Oh
sincerity, sinc^rity, if I knew what sincerity means. Sir, lay the foundation
thus and ye shall not soon shrink nor be shaken: Make tight work at the bottom,
and your ship shall ride against all storms, if with all your anchor be fastened
upon good ground, I mean with in the vail; and verily I think this is All, to
gain Christ: All other things are shadows, dreams, fancies and nothing. Sir,
remember my love to your mother: I pray for mercy and grace to her: I wish her
ongoing toward heaven: As I promised to write, so show her, I want nothing in
my Lord's service, Christ will not be in such a poor man's common as mine.
Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. Sept. 22. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To JOHN GORDON. (161)
Worthy and dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have been too long in writing to you, but
multitude of letters takes much time from me. I bless his great name whom I
serve in the spirit, if it came to voting amongst Angels and men, how excellent
and sweet Christ is, even in his reproaches and in his cross; I cannot but vote
with the first, that all that is in him, both cross and crown, kisses and
glooms, embracements and frownings and strokes are sweet and glorious: God send
me no more happiness in heaven or out of heaven, but Christ: For I find this
world when I have looked upon it on both sides, within and without, and when I
have seen even the laughing and lovely-like side of it, to be but a fool's
idol, a clay prison: Lord, let it not be the nest that my hope builds in. I
have now cause to judge my part of this earth not worth a blast of smoke or a
mouth-full of brown bread. I wish my Hope may take a running-leap and skip over
Time's pleasures, Sin's plaistering and gold-^o^e, this vain earth, and rest
upon my Lord. O how great is our night-darkness in this wilderness! To have any
conceit at all of this world, is, as a man would close his handful of water
and holding his hand in the river, say, all the water of the flood is his, as
if it were indeed all within the compass of his hand: Who would not laugh at
the thoughts of such a crack-brain? Verily they have but an handful of water
and are but like a child clasping his two hands about a night-shadow, who
idolize any created hope, but God. I now ligh lie and put the price of a dream
or fable or black nothing upon all things, but upon God and that desirable and
love-worthy one my Lord Jesus: Let all the world be nothing [for nothing was
their seed and mother] and let God be all things. My very dear Brother, know ye
are as near heaven as ye are far from your self and far from the love of a
bewitching and whorish world: For this World in it is gain and glory, is but the
great and notable common whore that all the sons of men have been in fancy and
lust withal these 5000 years: the children that they have begotten with this
uncouth and lustful lover are but vanity, dreams, golden imaginations and
night-thoughts: For there is no good ground here under the covering of heaven
for men and poor wearied souls to set down their foot upon. O he who is called
God, that one whom they term Jesus Christ, is worth the having indeed, even if^
had given away all without my eye-holes, my soul and my self for sweet Jesus my
Lord! O let the claim be cancelled that the creatures have to me, except that
claim my Lord Jesus has to me! Oh that he would claim poor me, my silly, light
and worthless soul! O that he would pursue his claim to the utmost point and
not want me! For it is my pain and remediless sorrow to want him. I see nothing
in this life but sinks and mires and dreams and beguiling ditches and ill
ground for us to build upon. I am fully persuaded of Christ's victory in
Scotland, but I fear this land be not yet ripe and white for mercy: Yet I dare
be halfer [upon my salvation] with the losses of the church of Scotland, that
her foes afternoon shall sing dole and sorrow for evermore, and that her joy
shall once again be cried up and her sky shall clear: But vengeance and
burning shall be to her adversaries and the sinners of this land. Oh that we
could be awakened to prayers and humiliation! Then should our sun shine like
seven suns in the heaven, then should the temple of Christ be builded upon the
mountains tops, and the land from coast to coast should be filled with the
glory of the Lord. Brother, your day-task is wearing short, your hourglass of
this span-length and hand-breadth of life will quickly pass, and therefore take
order and course with matters betwixt you and Christ before it come to open
pleading there are no quarters to be had of Christ in open judgment. I know ye
see your thread wearing short, and that there are not many inches to the
threed's end, and therefore lose not time. Remember me his prisoner, that it
would please the Lord to bring me again amongst you with abundance of the
Gospel. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To Mr HUGH Mc KAILL. (162)
Reverend and dear Brother.
I thank you for your letter: I cannot but show you that as I never expected
any thing from Christ but much good and kindness, so he has made me to find
it in the house of my pilgrimage? And believe me, Brother, I give it to you
under mine own hand-writ, that who so looks to the white side of Christ's
cross and can take it up handsomely with faith and courage shall find it such a
burden as (...) are to a ship or wings to a bird. I find my Lord has
overguilded that black tree and has perfumed it and oiled it, with joy and
consolation. Like a fool once I would chide and plead with Christ and slander
him to others of unkindness, but I trust in God not to call his glooms unkind
again, for he has taken from me my sackcloth, and I verily cannot tell you
what a poor sold Joseph and prisoner [with whom my mother's children were
angry] does now think of kind Christ: I will chide no more, providing he will
quite me all by-gones; for I am poor. I am taught in this ill weather to go on
the lee-side of Christ and to put him in between me and the storm, and I thank
God I walk on the sunny side of the brae. I write it, that ye may speak in my
behalf the praises of my Lord to others, that my bonds may preach. O if all
Scotland knew the feasts and love-blenks and visites that the Prelates have sent
me unto! I will verily give my Lord Jesus a free discharge of all that I like a
fool, laid to his charge, and beg him pardon to the mends. God grant that in my
temptations I come not on his wrong side again, and never again fall a raving
against my Physician in my fever. Brother, plead with your mother while ye have
time: A pulpit would be a high feast to me, but I dare not say one word against
him who has done it, I am not out of the house as yet, my sweet Master says,
I shall have house-room at his own elbow, albeit their synagogues will need
force cast me out. A letter were a work of charity to me. Grace be with you.
Pray for me.

Aberd. November. 22. 1636. Your Brother and Christ's prisoner, S. R.

To JAMES MURRAY. (163)
Dear Brother.
I Received your letter: I am in good health of body, but far better in my
soul. I find my Lord no worse then his word, I will be with him in trouble is
made good to me now: He hears the sighing of the prisoner. Brother, I am
comforted in my royal Prince and King: This world knows not our life, it is a
mystery to them: We have the sunny side of the world, and our Paradise is far
above theirs, yea our weeping above their laughing, which is but like the
crackling of thorns under a pot; And therefore we have good cause to fight it
out, for the day of our Laureation is approaching. I find my prison the
sweetest place that ev r I was in, my Lord Jesus is kind to me, and has taken
the mask off his face, and is content to quite me, all by-gones: I dare not
complain of him. And for my silence, I lay it before Christ, I hope it shall be
a speaking silence: He who knows what I would, knows that my soul desires
no more, but that King Jesus may be great in the North of Scotland, in the
South and in the East and West, through my sufferings for the freedom of my
Lord's house and Kingdom. If I could keep good quarters in time to come with
Christ, I would fear nothing: But Oh! Oh! I complain of my woeful
out-breakings; I tremble at the remembrance of a new outcast betwixt him and
me, and I have cause, when I consider what sick and sad days I have had for
his absence who is now come. I find Christ dow not be long unkind, our
Ioseph's bowels yern within him, he cannot smother love long, it must break out
at length. Praise, praise with me Brother, and desire my acquaintance to help
me: I dare not conceal his love to my soul, I wish you all a part of my feast,
that my Lord Jesus may be honored: I allow you not to hide Christ's bounty to
me, when ye meet with such as know Christ. Ye write nothing to me what are the
cruel mercies of the Prelates toward me: The ministers of this town, as I hear,
intend that I shall be more strickly confined, or else transported, because
they find some people affect me. Grace be with you.

To JOHN FLEMING. Bailiffe of Leith. (164)
My very worthy friend.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter: I bless my Lord
through Jesus Christ, I find his word good, Isa, ^8, ^0. I have chosen thee in
the furnace of affliction. And Psalm. 91. 15. I will be with him in trouble. I
never exp^cted other at Christ's hand, but much good and comfort, and I am not
disappointed: I find my Lord's cross overguilded and oiled with comforts: My
Lord has now showen me the white side of his cross: I would not exchange my
weeping in prison with the fourteen Prelates laughter amidst their hungry (...)
lean joys. This world knows not the sweetness of Christ's love, it is a
mystery to them. At my first coming here, I found great heaviness, especially
because it had pleased the Prelates to add this gentle cruelty to my former
sufferings [^or it is gentle to them] to inhibite the Ministers of the town to
give me the liberty of a pulpit: I said, what adeth Christ at my service? But I
was a fool, he has chided himself friends with me: If ye and others of God's
children shall praise his great name who makes worthless men witnesses for
him, my silence and sufferings shall preach more then my tongue could do; if
his glory be seen in me I am satisfied; for I want no kindness of Christ: And
Sir, I dare not smother his liberality: I write it to you, that ye may praise,
and desire your brother and others to join with me in this work. This land
shall be made desolate, our iniquities are full: the Lord says, we shall drink
and spue and fall. Remember my love to your good kind wife. Grace be with you.

To EARLESTOVVN ELDER. Rev. 12: 11. And they overcame the Dragon by the blood
of the Lamb and the word of their testimony, and they loved not their lives
unto the death. (165)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to see you in paper and to be
refreshed by you. I cannot but desire you and charge you to help me to praise
him, who feeds a poor prisoner with the fatness of his house. O how weighty
is his love! O but there is much telling in Christ's kindness! The Amen, the
faithful and true witness has paid me my hundred fold well told and one to
the hundred: I complained of him, but he is owing me nothing now. Sir, I charge
you to help me to praise his goodness, and to proclaim to others my
Bridegroom's kindness, whose love is better then wine. I took up an action
against Christ and bought a plea against his love, and libelled unkindness
against Christ my Lord, and I said, this is my death, he has forgotten me: But
my meek Lord held his peace and beheld me, and would not contend for the last
word of flyting, and now has chided himself friends with me: And now I see, he
must be God and I must be flesh: I pass from my summonds, I acknowledge he
might have given me my fill of it and never troubled himself: But now he has
taken away the mask, I have been comforted, he could not smother his love any
longer to a prisoner and a stranger: God grant that I may never buy a plea
against Christ again, but may keep good quarters with him. I want no kindness,
no love-token; but Oh, wise is his love! for notwithstanding of this hot
summer-blenk, I am kept low with the grief of my silence, for his word is in
me as a fire in my bowels, and I see the Lord's vineyard laid waste, and the
heathen entered into the sanctuary, and my belly is pained and my soul in
heaviness, because the Lord's people is gone into captivity and because of the
fury of the Lord and that wind, [but neither to fan nor to purge] that is
coming upon Apostate Scotland. Also I am kept awake with the late wrong done to
my brother, but I trust ye will counsel and comfort him. Yet in this mist I see
and believe, the Lord will heal this halting Kirk and will lay her stones with
fair colors and her foundations with Saphires, and will make her windows of
Agates and her gates Carbuncles, Isa. 54. 11, 12. And for brass he will bring
gold: He has created the smith that formed the sword, no weapon in war shall
prosper against use Let us be glad and rejoice in the Lord, for his Salvation
is near to come. Remember me to your wife and your son John: And I entreat you
to write to me. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. December. 30. 1636. Yours in his only, only Lord Jesus. S. R.

To Mr JOHN FERGUSHILL. [166]
Reverend and welbeloved in our Lord Jesus.
I Must still provoke you to write by my lines, whereat ye need not wonder; for
the cross is full of talk, and speak it must, either good or bad: Neither can
grief be silent. I have no dittay nor indictment to bring against Christ's
cross, seeing he has made a friendly agreement betwixt me and it, and we are
in terms of love together: If my former miscarriages, and my nowsilent sabbaths
seem to me to speak wrath from the Lord, I dare say, it is but Satan borrowing
the use and loan of my cowardly and feeble apprehensions, which start at
straws: I know faith is not so saint and foolish, as to tremble at every false
alarm; Yet I gather this out of it, Blessed are they who are graced of God
(...) guide a cross well, and that there is some art required herein. I pray
God I may not be so ill friend-stead, as that Christ my Lord should leave me to
be my own Tutour and my own Physician. Shall I not think but my Lord Jesus who
deserves his own place very well, will take his own place upon him, as it
becomes him, and that he will fill his own chair? For in this is his office,
to comfort us, and these that are casten down in all their tribulations. 2 Cor.
1. 4. Alas I know I am a fool to seek an hole or defect in Christ's way with my
soul. If I have not a stock to pre sent to Christ at his appearance, yet I pray
God I may be able with joy, faith and constancy, to show the Captain of my
savation in that day, a bloody head that I received in his service: howbeit my
faith hang by a small tack and thread, I hope the tack shall not break: and
howbeit my Lord get no service of me but broken wishes; yet I trust these shall
be accepted upon Christ's account. I have nothing to comfort me, but that I
say, Oh will the Lod disappoint an hungry on-waiter? The smell of Christ's wine
and apples which surposse the uptaking of dull sense, blows upon my soul, and
I get no more for the mean time: I am sure to let a famishing body see meat and
give him none of it, is a double pain: Our Lord's love it not so cruel as to
let a poor man see Christ and heaven and never give him more, for want of money
to buy; nay, I rather think Christ such fair market-wares, as buyers may have
^it out money and without price: And thus I know it shall not stand upon my
want of money; for Christ upon his own charges must buy my wedding garment, and
redeem the inheritance which I have forfeited, and give his word for one the
like of me, who am not law-biding of my self: Poor folks must either borrow or
beg from the rich, and the only thing that commends sinners to Christ is
extreme necessity and want: Christ's love is ready to make and provide a
ransom and money for a poor body who has lost his his purse. Ho, ye that have
no money come and buy Isa: 55. 1. That is the poor man's market. Now Brother I
see old crosses would have done nothing at me, and therefore Christ has taken
a new fresh rod to me, that seems to talk with my soul, and make me tremble.
I have often more ado now with faith when I lose my compass, and am blown on
a rock, then these who are my beholders standing upon the shore are aware of: a
counsel to a sick man is sooner given then taken: Lord send the wearied man a
borrowed bed from Christ: I think often it is after supper with me, and I am
heavy: O but I would sleep soundly with Christ's left hand under my head and
his right hand embracing me: the devil could not spill that bed. When I
consider how tenderly Christ has cared for me in this prison, I think he has
handled me as the bairn that it pitied and bemoaned: I desire no more till I be
in heaven; but such a feast and fill of Christ's love as I would have: This
love would be fair and adorning passements, which would beautify and set forth
my black unpleasant cross: I cannot tell, my Dear Brother, what a great lead I
would bear if I had a hearty fill of the love of that lovely one, Christ Jesus:
Oh if ye would seek and pray for that to me! I would give Christ all his love
styles and titles of honor if he would give me but this; nay, I would sell my
self (if I could) for that love. I have been waiting to see what friends of
place and power would do for us; But when the Lord loses the pins of his own
Tabernacle, he will have himself to be acknowledged as the only builder up
thereof, and therefore I would take back again my hope that I lent and laid in
pawn in men's hands and give it wholly to Christ: it is no time for me now to
set up idols of my own, it were a pity to give an ounce weight of hope to any
besides Christ: I think him well worthy or all my hope, though it were as
weighty as both heaven and earth: Happy were I, if I had any thing that Christ
would seek or accept of: But now alas I see not what service I can do to him,
except it to be talk a little and babble upon a piece of paper, concerning the
love of Christ. I am often as if my faith were wedset so that I cannot command
it, and then when he hides himself, I run to the other extreme, in making each
wing and toe of my case as big as a mountain of iron: And then misbelief can
spin out an hell of heavy and desponding thoughts; then Christ seeks
law-borrows of my unbeleeving apprehensions, and charge me to believe his
daylight at midnight: But I make pleas with Christ, though it be ill my common
so to do: It were my happiness when I am in his house of wine and when I find
a feast day, if I could hearken and hear for the time to come, Isa: 42. 3. But
I see we must be off our feet in wading a deep water; and then Christ's love
finds time^us employment at such a dead lift as that: And besides, after
broken brows, bairns learn to walk more circumspectly: If I come to heaven any
way, howbeit like a tired traveller upon my guide's shoulder, it is good enough
for these who have no legs of their own for such a journey: I never thought
there had been need of so much wrestling to win to the top of that ste^p
mountain as now I find. Woe's me for this broken and backsliding Church, it is
like an old bowing wall, leaning to the one side, and there is none of all her
sons who will set a prop under her: I know I need not bemoan Christ; for he
cares for his own honor more then I can do; but who can blame me to be woe
[(...) (...) had grace so to doe] to see my welbeloved', fair face spitt^d
upon, and his crown plucked off hi^ head, and the ark of God taken and carried
in the Philistines ca^t, and the ^ine put to carry it who will let it fall to
the ground? The Lord put to his own helping hand. I would desire you to prepare
your self for a fight with beast, ye will not get leave to steel quietly to
heaven in Christ's company without a conflict and a cross. Remember my bonds,
and praise my second, and fellow prisoner, Christ. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in Christ Jesus his Lord. S. R.

To WILLIAM GLENDINNING. (167)
Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Your ease is unknown to me, whether ye be
yet our Lord's prisoner at W^gton or not: However it be, I know our Lord Jesus
has been enquiring for you, and that he has honored you to bear his chains,
which is the golden end of his cross, and so has wailed out a chosen and
honorable cross for you: I wish you much joy and comfort of it, for I have
nothing to say of Christ's cross but much good, I hope my ill word shall never
meet either Christ or his sweet and easy cross. I know he seeks of us an
outcast with this house of clay, this mother-prison, this earth, that we love
fall well: and verily, when Christ snuffeth my candle and causes my light to
shine upward, it is one of my greatest wonders that dirt and clay has so much
court with a soul not made of clay, and that our soul goes out of kind so
far; as to make an idol of this earth, such a deformed harlot, as that it
should wrong Christ of our love. How fast, how fast does our ship sail! And
how fair a wind has Time to blow us off these coasts and this land of dying
and perishing things! And alas, our ship saileth one way and flees many miles
in one hour to hasten us upon eternity, and our love and hearts are sailing
close back over and swimming toward ease, lawless pleasure, vain honor,
perishing riches, and to build a fool's nest I know not where, and to lay our
eggs within the sea-mark, and fasten our bits of broken anchors upon the worst
ground in the world, this fleetting and perishing life; and in the mean while,
time and tide carry us upon another life, and there is daily less and less oil
in our lamp, and less and less sand in our watch-glass. O what a wise course
were it for us, to look away from the false beauty of our borrow^d prison, and
to mind and eye and lust for our country! Lord, Lord, take us home. And for
my self, I think, if a poor, weak, dying sheep seek for an old dike and the
lee-side of an hill in a storm, I have cause to long for a covert from this
storm in heaven: I know none will take my room over my head there; But
certainly sleepy bodies would be at rest and a well made bed, and an old crazed
bark at a shore, and a wearied traveller at home and a breathless horse at the
rink's end. I see nothing in this life but sin and the sour fruits of sin: And
O what a burden is sin; and what a slavery and miserable bondage is it, to be
at the nod and yea's and nay's of such a lord-master as a body of sin! Truly
when I think of it, it is a wonder that Christ makes not fire and ashes of
such a dry branch as I am. I would often lie down under Christ's feet, and bid
him trample upon me, when I consider my guiltiness: But seeing he has sworn
that sin shall not loose his unchangeable covenant, I keep house-room amongst
the rest of the ill learned bairns, and must cumber the Lord of the house with
with the rest, till my Lord take the fetters off legs and arms, and destroy
this body of sin, and make a hole or a breach in this cage of earth, that the
bird may flee out and the imprisoned soul be at liberty. In the mean time the
least intimation of Christ's love is sweet, and the hope of marriage with the
Bridegroom holds me in some joyful on-waiting, that when Christ's
summer-birds shall sing upon the branches of the tree of life, I shall be tuned
by God himself to help them to sing the home-coming of our welbeloved and his
Bride to their house together. When I think of this, I think winters and
summers and years and days and time do me a pleasure that they shorten this
untwisted and weak thread of my life, and that they put sin and miseries by
hand, and that they shall carry me to my Bridegroom within a clap. Dear
Brother, pray for me, that it would please the Lord of the vineyard to give me
house-room to preach his righteousness again to the great congregation. Grace,
grace be with you. Remember me to your wife.

MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be multiplied upon you: I greatly long to be refreshed
with your letter: I am now [all honor and glory to the King eternal, immortal
and invisible] in better terms with Christ then I was. I like a fool summoned
my husband and Lord, and libelled unkindness against him, but now I pass from
that foolish pursuit, I give over the plea, he is God and I am man: I was
loosing a fast stone and digging at the groundstone [the love of my Lord] to
shake and unsettle it, but God be thanked, it is fast, all i^ sure: In my
prison he has showen me daylight; he dought not hide his love any longer:
Christ was disguised and masked, and I apprehended it was not he, and he has
said It is(...), be not afraid: And now his love is better then wine. Oh that
all the virgins had part of the Bridegroom's love, whereupon he makes me to
feed! Help me to praise: I charge you, Madam, help me to pay praises, and tell
others, the daughters of Jerusalem, how kind Christ is to a poor prisoner: he
has paid me my hundred fold, it is well told me and one to the hundred: I am
nothing behind with Christ: Let not fools, because of their lazy soft flesh,
raise a slander and an ill report upon the cross of Christ, it is sweeter then
fair: I see, grace grows best in winter: This poor, p^rsecuted Kirk, this
lilie amongst the thorns, shall blossom and laugh upon the gardener, the
husband-man's blessing shall light upon it. Oh if I could be free of jealousies
of Christ after this, and believe and keep good quarters with my dearest
husband! for he has been kind to the stranger: and yet in all this fair hot
summer-weather, I am kept from saying (...) is good to be here, with my
silence, and with grief to see my mother wou ded and her vail taken from her,
and the fair Temple casten down: and my belly is pained, my soul is heavy for
the captivity of the daughter of my people, and because of the fury of the Lord
and his fierce indignation against Apostate Scotland. I pray you, Madam, let me
have that which is my prayer here, that my sufferings may preach to the four
quarters of this land, and therefore tell others how open-handed Christ has
been to the prisoner and the oppressed stranger: Why should I conceal it? I
know no other way how to glorify Christ, but to make an open proclamation of
his love, and of his his soft and sweet kisses to me in the furnace, and of his
fidelity to such as suffer for him. Give it me under your hand that ye will
help me to pray and praise, but rather to praise and rejoice in the salvation
of God. Grace, grace be with you.

To the Lady CARDONNESS. (169)
My dearly beloved and longed for in the Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear how your soul Prospers and
how the Kingdom of Christ thriveth in you. I exhort you and beseech you in the
bowels of Christ faint not, weary not: There is a great necessity of heaven, ye
must needs have it: All other things, as houses, lands, children, husband,
friends, country, credit, health, wealth, honor, may be wanted; but Heaven is
your one thing necessary, the good part that shall not be taken from you: See
that ye buy the field where the pearl is, sell all and make a purchase of
salvation: think it not easy, for it is a steep ascent to eternal glory: Many
are lying dead by the way that are slain with security. I have now been led by
my Lord Jesus to such a nick in Christianity as I think little of former
things. Oh what I want! I want so many things, that I am almost asking if I had
any thing at all: Every man thinks he is rich enough in grace, till he take
out his purse and tell his money, and then he finds his pack but poor and
light in the day of a heavy trial. I found I had not to bear my expenses, and
should have fainted if want and penury had not chased me to the storehouse of
all. I beseech you, make couscience of your ways, deal kindly and with
conscience with your Tenants: to fill a breach or a hole make not a greater
breach in the conscience: I wish plenty of love to your soul: let the world be
the portion of bastards, make it not yours: after the last trumpet is blown,
the world and all its glory will be like an old house that is burnt to ashes,
and like an old fallen castle without a roof. Fie, fie upon us fools who think
our selves debtors to the world. My Lord has brought me to this, that I would
not give a drink of cold water for this world's kindness: I wonder that men
long after, love, or care for these feathers: it is almost an uncouth world to
me to think, that men are so mad as to block with dead earth: to give cut
conscience and to get in clay again, is a strange bargain. I have written my
mind at length to your husband, write to me again his case, I cannot forget
him in my prayers, I am looking Christ has some claim to him: My counsel is,
that ye bear with him when passion overtaketh him, A soft answer puts away
wrath, answer him in what he speaks and apply your self in the fear of God to
him, and then ye will remove a pound weight of your heavy cross that way, and
so it shall become light. When Christ hides himself, wait on and make di^ till
he return, it is not time then to be carelessly patient; I love it to be grieved
when he hides his smiles: yet believe his love in a patient on-waiting and
believing in the dark: Ye must learn to swim and hold up your head above the
water, even when the sense of his presence is not with you, to hold up your
chin: I trust in God, he shall bring your ship safe to land. I counsel you to
study sanctification, and to be dead to this world: urge kindness on Knockbrex,
labor to benefit by his company, the man is acquaint with Christ. I beg the
help of your prayers, for I forget not you: counsel your husband to fulfill my
joy and to seek the Lord's face, show him from me that my joy and desire is to
hear he is in the Lord, God casts him often in my mind, I cannot forget him,
I hope Christ and he have something to do together: Bless John from me, I
write blessings to him and to your husband and the rest of your children. Let
it not be said, I am not in your house, through neglect of the Sabbath-exercise.

Dear Sister.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear how your soul prospers. I
am as well as a prisoner of Christ can be, feasted and made fat with the
comforts of God: Christ's kisses are made sweeter to my soul then ever they
were. I would not change my Master with all the Kings of clay upon the earth.
O, my welbeloved is altogether lovely and loving! I care not what flesh can
do. I persuade my soul, I delivered the truth of Christ to you, slip not from
it for no boasts or fear of men: If ye go against the truth of Christ that I
now suffer for, I shall bear witness against you in the day of Christ. Sister,
fasten your grips fast on Christ, follow not the guises of this sinful world:
Let not this clay-portion of earth take up your soul, it is the portion of
bastards, and ye are a child of God, therefore seek your father's heritage,
send up your heart to see the dwelling house and fair rooms in the new City:
Fie, sy upon these who cry up with the World and down with Conscience and
Heaven: We have bairns wits, and therefore we cannot prize Christ aright.
Counsel your husband and mother to make them for eternity, that day is drawing
nigh. Pray for me the prisoner of Christ; I cannot forget you.

To my Lord CRAIGHALL. [171]
My Lord.
I Received Mr Ls letter with your Lo: and his learned thoughts in the matter
of Ceremonies: I ow respect to the man's learning, for that I hear him opposite
to Arminian Heresies: but [with reverence of that worthy man] I wonder to hear
such popish-like expression as he has in his letter, as, Your Lo: may spare
doubtings when the King and Church have agreed in the settling of such orders,
and the Church's direction in things indifferent and circumstantial [as if
Indifferent and Circumstantial were all one] should be the rule of every
private Christian. I only viewed the papers in two hour, space, the bearer
hasting me to write. I find the worthy man not so seen in this controversy,
as some turbulent men of our country, as he calls refusers of conformity:
And let me say it, I am more confirmed in nonconformity, when I see such a
great (...) it play the age^t so slenderly; but I will lay the blame on the
weakness of the cause, not on the meanness of Mr Ls. learning. I have ever been
and still I am confident that Britain cannot answer one argument a scandalo, and
I longed much to hear Mr L. speak to the cause, and I would say, if some
ordinary Divine had answered as Mr L. does, that he understood not the nature
of a Scandal: but I dare not vilify, that worthyman so. I am now upon the heat
of some other employment, I shall, but God willing, answer this to the
satisfying of any not prejudged. I will not say that every one is acquaint with
the reason in my letter from God's presence and bright shining face in
suffering for this cause, Aristotle never knew the medium of the clusion, and
Christ says few know it. See Rev. 2. 17. I am sure a conscience standinginaw
of the Almighty, and fearing to make a little hole in the bottom for fear of
under-water, is a strong medium to hold off an erroneous conclusion in the
least wing or lith of sweet, sweet Truth, that concerns the royal Prerogative
of our Kingly and highest Lord Jesus: And my witness is in heaven, I saw
neither pleasure nor profit nor honor to hook me or catch me in entering in
prison for Christ, but the wind on my face for the present: and if I had loved
to sleep in a whole skin with the ease and present delight that I saw on this
side of sun and moon, I should have lived at ease in good hopes to fare as well
as others. The Lord knows, I preferred preaching of Christ and still do, to
any thing next to Christ himself, and their new Canons took my one, my one joy
from me, which was to me as the poor man's one eye that had no more, and alas,
there is little lodging in their heart for pity or mercy, to pluck out a poor
man's one eye for a thing indifferent, id est, for knots of straws and things
[as they mean] off the way to heaven. I desire not that my name take journey
and go a pilgrim to Cambridge, for fear I come in the ears of Authority: I am
sufficiently burnt already. In the mean time be pleased to try if the Bishop of
St Andrews, and Glasgow, Galloway's Ordinary, will be pleased to abate from
the heat of their wrath and let me go to my charge. Few know the heart of a
prisoner, yet I hope the Lord shall hew his own glory out of as knotty timber
as I am. Keep Christ, my dear and worthy Lord: pretended paper-arguments from
angering the Mother Church that can reel and nod and stagger, are not of such
weight as peace with the father and husband: let the wife gloom, I care not, if
the husband laugh, Remember my service to my Lord your father, and Mother, and
your Lady. Grace be with you.

Aberd. Jan. 24. 1637. Yours at all obodience in Christ, S, R.

To his Reverend and dear Brother Mr ROBERT BLAIR. (172).
Reverend and dear Brother.
THe reason ye gave for your not writing to me, affects me much and gives me
a dash, when such an one as ye conceive an opinion of me or any thing in me:
The truth is, when I come home to my self, O what penury do I find, and how
feckless is my supposed stock, and how little have I! He to whom I am as
crystal and who sees through me and perceives the least mote that is in me,
knows that I speak what I think and am convinced of: But men cast me through
a gross and wide sieve: my very dear Brother, the room of the least of all
saints is too great for the like of me: But lest this should seem art to fetch
home reputation I speak no more of it: It is my worth to be Christ's ransomed
sinner and sick one: His relation to me, is, that I am sick and He is the
physician of whom I stand in need: Alas, how often play I fast and loose with
Christ: He binds I loose, he builds I cast down, he t^immeth up a salvation
for me and I mar it, I cast out with Christ and he agrees with me again twenty
times a day, I forfeit my Kingdom and heritage, I lose what I had; but Christ
is at my back, and following on to stoop and take up that falls from me: Were
I in heaven and had the crown on my head, if Freewill were my tutour I should
lose heaven; seeing I lose my self, what wonder I should let go and lose Jesus
my Lord: O well to me for evermore that I have cracked my credit with Christ,
and cannot by law at all borrow from him upon my feckless and worthless bond
and faith! for my faith and reputation with Christ, is, that I am a creature
that God will not put any trust into; I was, and am bewildered with
temptations, and wanted a guide to heaven. O what have I to say of that
excellent, surpassing and supereminent thing they call The Grace of God, the
way of free redemption in Christ! And when poor poor I, dead in law, was sold,
fettered and imprisoned in Justice's closest ward, which is hell and damnation;
when I a wretched one lighted upon noble Jesus, eternally kind Jesus, tender
hearted Jesus, nay, when he lighted upon me first and knew me, I found that he
scorned to take a price or any thing like hire of Angels, or Seraphims, or any
of his creatures; and therefore I would praise him for this, that the whole
army of the redeemed ones sit rent-free in heaven: Our holding is better then
Blench: We are all Freeholders, and seeing our eternal feuduty is but thanks,
Oh woeful me that I have but spilt thanks and broken, lame and miscarried
praises to give him, and so my silver is not good and current with Christ, were
it not that free merits have stamped it and washen it and me both! And for my
silence, I see somewhat better through it now: If my high and lofty one, my
princely and Royal Master say, Hold, hold thy peace, I lay bonds on thee thou
speak none, I would fain be content, and let my fire be smothered under ashes,
without light or flame, I cannot help it, I take laws from my Lord, but I give
none. As for your journey to F. ye do well to follow it: The camp in Christ's
ordinary bed: A carried bed is kindly to the Beloved down in this lower house:
It may be, and who knows but our Lord has some Centurions ye are sent to:
Seeing your angry mother denies you lodging and house-room with her, Christ's
call to unknown faces must be your second wind, seeing ye cannot have a first.
O that our Lord would water again with a new visit this piece withered and dry
hill of our widow-mount Zion! my Dear Brother, I will think it comfort if ye
speak my name to our welbeloved: wherever ye are I am mindful of you. O that
the Lord would yet make the light of the moon in Scotland like the light of the
sun, and the light of the sun seven fold brighter. For my self, as yet I have
received no answer whither to go: I wait on: O that Jesus had my love! Let
matters frame as they list, I have some more to do with Christ; yet I would
fain we were nearer. Now, the great shepherd of the sheep, the very God of
peace, establish and confirm you till the day of his coming.

To the Lady CARLETON. (173)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: My soul longs once again to be amongst
you, and to behold that beauty of the Lord that I would see in his house: But I
know not if he in whose hands are all our waves sees it expedient for his
glory; I ow my Lord [I know] submission of spirit, suppose he should turn me
into a stone or pillar o^ salt. Oh that I were He, in whom my Lord could be
glorified, suppose my little heaven were forfeited to buy glory to him before
men and Angels, suppose my want of his presence, and separation from Christ
were a pillar as high as ten heavens for Christ's glory to stand upon above all
the world! What am I to him? How little am I [though my feathers stood out as
broad as the morning ligh^] to such a high, to such a lofty, to such a
never-enough admired and glorious Lord? My trials are heavy, because of my sad
sabbaths; but I know they are less then my high provocations: I seek no more
but that Christ may be the gainer and I the loser, that he may be raised and
hightned, and I cried down, and my worth made dust before his glory. Oh that
Scotland, all with one shout, would cry up Christ, and that his name were high
in this land! I find the very utmost borders of Christ's high excellency and
deep swe^tness heaven and earth's wonder. O what is he, if I could win in to
see his inner side! Oh I am run d^y of loving and wondering and adoring of that
greatest and most admirable one! Woe, woe is me I have not half-love for him!
Alas what can my drop do to his great sea! What gain is it to Christ that I
have casten my little sparkle in his great fire! What can I give to him? Oh
that I had love to fill a thousand worlds, that I might empty my soul of it
all upon Christ! I think I have now just reason to quite my part of any hope or
love that I have to this scum and the refuse of the dross of God's
work-man^hip, this vain earth: I ow to this stormy world [whose kindness (...).
heart to me has been made of iron, or of a piece of a wild sea-Island, that
never a creature of God yet lodged in] not a look: I ow it no love, no hope;
and therefore Oh if my love were dead to it, and my soul dead to it! What am I
obliged to this house of my pilgrimage? A straw for all that God has made, to
my soul's liking, except God and that lovely one Jesus Christ: Seeing I am not
this world's debtor, I desire I may be striped of all confidence in any thing
but my Lord, that he may be for me, and I for my only, only, only Lord; that
he may be the morning and evening-tide, the top and the root of my joys, and
the heart and flower and yolk of all my soul's delights. O let me never lodge
any creature in my heart and confidence! Let the house be for him: I rejoice
that sad days cut off a piece of the lease of my short life, and that my
shadow [even while I suffer] wears long, and my evening hasteneth on: I have
cause to love home with all my heart, and to take the opportunity of the day to
hasten to the end of my journey, before the night come on wherein a man cannot
see to walk or work; that once after my falls I may at, night fall in, weary
and tired as I am, in Christ's bosom, and betwixt his breasts: Our prison
cannot be our best country: This world looks not like heaven and the
happiness that our tired souls woul be at; and therefore it were good to seek
about for the wind, and hoise up our sails toward our new Jerusalem, for that
is our best. Remember a prisoner to Christ. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his only Lord and Master, S. R.

To my Lord CRAIGHALL. (174)
My Lord.
I Received one letter of your Lo: from C and another of late from A. B.
wherein I find your Lo: in perplexity what to do: But let me entreat your Lo:
not to cause your self mistake Truth and Christ, because they seem to encounter
with your peace and ease: My Lord, remember that a prisoner ^ath written it to
you, As the Lord lives, if ye put to your hand with other Apostates in this
land, to pull down the sometime beautiful tab^rnacle of Christ in this land,
and join hands with them in one hair-breadth to welcome Antichrist to Scotland,
there is wrat^ gone out from the Lord against you and your house. If the terror
of a King has overtaken you, and your Lo: looks to sleep in your nest in
peace and to take the nearest shore, there are many ways, too too many ways
how to shift Christ with some ill-washen and foul distinctions; but assure your
self, suppose a King should assure you he would be your God [as he shall never
be, for that piece of service] your clay-god shall die and your carnal
counselors, when your conscience shall storm against you, and ye complain to
them, they will say, What is that to us? Believe not that Christ is weak, or
that he is not able to save: Of two fires that ye cannot pass, take the least:
Some few years will bring us all out in our black's and white's before our
Judge, Eternity is nearer to you then ye are aware of: To go on in a course of
defection, when an enlightened conscience is stirring, and looking you in the
face, and crying within you, That ye are going in an evil way, is, a step to
the sin against the holy Ghost: Either many of this land are near that sin, or
else I know not what it is: And if this for which I now suffer be not the way
of peace, and the King's highway to salvation, I believe there is not a way at
all: There is not such breadth and elbow-room in the way to heaven as men
believe, Howbeit this day be not Christ's, the morrow shall be his: I believe
assuredly our Lord shall repair the old ^a^e places and his ruined house in
Scotland; and this wilderness shall yet blossom as the rose. My very worthy and
dear Lord, Wait upon him who hides his face from the house of Jacob and look
for him: wait patiently a little upon the bridegroom's return again, that your
soul may live and ye may rejoice with the Lord's inheritance: I dare pawnd my
life and soul for it, if ye take this storm with bor^-down Christ, your sky
shall quickly clear, and you^ fair morning dawn. Think [as the truth is] that
Christ is just now saying, And will ye also leave me? Ye have a fair occasion
to gratify Christ now, if ye will stay with him, and want the night's sleep
with your suffering Savior one hour, now when Scotland has fallen asleep and
leaves Christ to fend for himself. I profess my self but a weak feeble man,
when I came first to Christ's camp I had nothing to maintain this war or to
bear me out in this encounter, and I am little better yet; but since, I find
furniture, armor and strength from the consecrated Captain, the Prince of our
salvation, who was perfected though suffering, I esteem suffering for Christ a
King's life: I find that our wants qualify us for Christ; and howbeit your
Lo: write, ye despair to attain to such a communion and fellowship [which I
would not have you to think] yet would ye nobly and courageously venture to
make over to Christ, for his honor now lying at the stake, your estate, place
and honor; He would lovingly and largely requite you, and give you a King's
word for a recompense: Venture upon Christ's come, and I dare swear ye shall
say as it is Psalm: 16: 7. I bless the Lord who gave me counsel. My very worthy
Lord, many eyes in both the kingdoms are upon you now, and the eye of our Lord
is upon you, acquit your self manfully for Christ: Spill not this good play:
Subscribe a blank submission, and put it in Christ's hands: Win, win the
blessings and prayers of your sighing and sorrowful mother church seeking your
help: Win Christ's bond [who is a King of his word] for a hundred fold more
even in this life. If a weak man has past a promise to a King to make a slip
to Christ [if we look to flesh and blood I wonder not of it, possibly. I might
have done worse my self, but] add not further guiltiness to go on in such a
scandalous and foul way: Remember that there is a we, ^oe to him by whom
offenses come: This woe came out of Christ's m^ut^, and it is heavier then the
woe of the Law: It is the Mediato^'s vengeance, and that is two vengeances to
these who are enlightened: Free your self from unlawful anguish about advising
and resolving: When the truth is come to your hand, hold it fast, go not again
to make a new search and enquiry for truth: It is easy to cause conscience
believe as ye will, not as ye know: It is easy for you to cast your light into
prison, and detain God's truth in unrighteousn^ss; But that prisoner will break
ward to your incomparable torture: Fear your light, and stand in aw of it, for
it is from God: Think what honor it is in this life also to ^e ^nrolled to the
succeeding ages amongst Christ's witnesses, standing against the re-entry of
Antichrist: I know certainly your light looking to two ways, and to the two
sides, cries shame upon the course that they would counsel you to follow: The
way that is halfer and compartner with the smoke of this fat world and with
ease, smells strong of a foul and false way. The Prince of peace, he who
brought again from the dead, the great shepherd of his sheep, by the blood of
the eternal covenant, establish you, and give you sound light, and counsel you
to follow Christ. Remember my obliged service to my Lord your Father, and
Mother, and your Lady. Grace be with you.

My very dear and loving Sister.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear from you: I exhort you to set
up the brac to the King's city that must be taken with violence: Your
afternoon's sun is wearing low: Time will eat up your frail life like a worm
gnawing at the root of a May-flower: Lend Christ your heart: Set him as a seal
there: Take him in within, and let the world and children stand at the door;
they are not yours, make you and them for your proper owner, Christ: It is good
He is your husband and their father: What missing can there be of a dying man,
when God fills his chair? Give hours of the day to prayer: Fash Christ [If I
may speak so] and importune him, be often at his gate, give his door no rest; I
can tell you he will be found: O what sweet fellowship is betwixt him and me! I
am imprisoned, but he is not imprisoned: He has shamed me with his kindness:
He has come to my p^ison and run away with my heart and all my love: Well may
he brook it: I wish my love get never an owner but Christ: Fie, fie upon old
lovers that held us so long asunder! We shall not parr now: He and I shall be
heard before he win out of my grips: I resolve to wrestle with Christ ere I
quite him: But my love to him has casten my soul in a fever, and there is no
cooling of my fever till I get r^all possession of Christ: O strong, strong
love of Jesus, thou have wounded my heart with thine arrows! O pain! O pain of
love io^ Christ! Who will help me to praise? Let me have your prayers. Grace be
with you,

To GRISSAL FULLERTON. (176)
Dear Sister.
I Exhorr you in the Lord to seek your one thing, Marie's good part that shall
not be taken from you: Set your heart and soul on the Childrens inheritance:
This clay-idol the world, is but for Bastards and ye are his lawful begotten
child: Learn the way [as your dear mother has has gone before you] to knock
at Christ's door: Many an alms of mercy has Christ given to Her, and has
abundance behind to give to you: Ye are the seed of the faithful and born
within the Covenant, claim your right. I would not exchange Christ Jesus for
ten worlds of glory: I know now [blessed be my teacher] how to shut the lock
and unbolt my welbeloved's door, and he makes a poor stanger welcome when he
comes to his house: I am swelled up and satisfied with the love of Christ that
is better then wine: It is a fire in my soul; let hell and the world cast water
on it, they will not mend themselves: I have now gotten the right gate of
Christ: I recommend him to you above all things: Come and find the smell of
his breath: See if his kisses be not sweet: He desires no better then to be
much made of: Be homely with him and ye shall be the more welcome: Ye know not
how fain Christ would have all your love. Think not this is imaginations and
bairns-play we make din for: I would not suffer for it if it were so: I dare
pawnd my heaven for it, that it is the way to glory: Think much of truth, and
abhor these ways devised by men in God's worship. The Grace of Christ be
with you.

To PATRICK CARSEN, (177)
Dear and loving friend.
I Cannot but upon the opportunity of a bearer exhort you to re^gn^ the love of
your youth to Christ, and in this day while your sun is high and your youth
serves you, to seek the Lord and his face; for there is nothing out of heaven
so necessary for you as Christ: And ye cannot be ignorant but your day will
end, and the night of death will call you from the pleasures of this life, and
a doom given out in death stands for ever as long as God lives. Youth
ordinarily is a Post and ready servant for Satan to run errands; for it is a
nest for lust, cursing, drunkenness, blaspheming of God, lying, pride and
vanity. O that there were such an heart in you as to fear the Lord, and to
dedicate your soul and body to his service: When the time comes that your
eye-strings shall break, and your face wax pale, and legs and arms trem^le, and
your breath grow cold, and your poor soul look out at you^ prison-hous^ of clay
to be set at liberty; then a good conscience and your Lord's favor shall be
worth all the world's glory: Seek it as your garland and crown. Grace be with
you.

To JOHN CARSEN. (178)
My welbeloved and dear friend.
EVery one ^eeketh not God, and far fewer find him, because they seek amiss:
He is to be sought for above all things, if men would find what they seek: Let
feathers and shadows alone to children and go seek your welbeloved: Your only
errand to the world, is, to woo Christ; therefore put other lovers from about
his house, and let Christ have all your love, without miniching or dividing it:
It is little enough if there were more of it: The serving of the world and sin
has but a base reward, and smoke in stead of pleatures, and but a night-dream
for true case to the soul: Go where ye will your soul shall not sleep sound
but in Christ's bosom: Come in to him and lie down and rest you on the slain
Son of God and enquire for him: I sought him, and now a fig for all the
worm-eaten pleasures, and moth-eaten glory out of heaven, since I have found
him, and in him all I can want or ^ish: He has made me a King over the world:
Princes cannot overcome me: Christ has given me the marriage-kiss, and he has
my ma^^ing -love: We have made up a full bargain that shall not go back on
either side: O if ye and all in that country knew what sweet terms of mercy
are betwixt him and me! Grace be with you.

To my Lady BOYD. [179]
MADAM.
I Would have written to your La: ere now, but peoples believing there is in me
that which I know there is not, has put me out of love with writing to any;
for it is easy to put religion to a market and public fair, but alas it is
not so soon made eyesweet for Christ: My Lord sees me a tired man far behind:
I have gotten much love from Christ, but I give him little or none again: My
whiteside comes out in paper to men, but at home and within, I find much
black work, and great cause of a low sail and of little boasting; and yet
Howbeit I see challenges to be true, the manner of the Tempter's pressing of
them is unhonest, and in my own thoughts knavish-like: My peace is, that Christ
may find sale and ^uting of his wares in the like of me, I mean for saving
grace: I wish all professors to fall in love with Grace; All ou^ songs should
be of his Free Grace: We are but too lazy and careless in seeking of it: It is
all our riches we have here, and glory in the bud: I wish I could set out ^ree
Grace: I was the Law's man and under the Law, and under a curse; but Grace
brought me from under that hard Lord, and I rejoice that I am Grace's
Freeholder: I pay tribute to none for heaven, seeing my land and heritage
holds of Christ my new King: Infinite wisdom has devised this excellent way
of Free-holding for sinners: It is a better way to heaven then the old way that
was in Adam's days: It has this fair advantage that no man's emptiness and
want lays an inhibition upon Christ or hinders his salvation: [and that is
far best for me] but our new Landlord puts the names of Dyvours and Adam's
forlorn Heirs, and beggars and crooked and blind in the free charters: Heaven
and Angels may wonder that we have gotten such a gate of sin and hell: Such a
back-entry out of hell as Christ made and brought out the captives by, is, more
then my poor shallow thoughts can comprehend: I would think sufferings, glory
[and I am sometimes not far from it] if my Lord would give me a new alms of
free grace. I hear that the Prelates are intending banishment for me; but for
more grace, and no other hire, I would make it welcome: The bits of this
clay-house, the earth, and the other side of the sea, are my father's: If my
sweet Lord Jesus would bud my sufferings with a new measure of grace, I were a
rich man: But I have not now of a long time found such high spring-tides as
formerly: The sea is out, and the wind of his Spirit calm, and I cannot buy a
wind, or by requesting the sea cause it to flow again; only I wait on, upon
the banks and shore-side, till the Lord send a full sea, that with up-sailes I
may lift up Christ: Yet sorrow for his absence is sweet, and sighs with Saw ye
him whom my soul loves, have their own delights: Oh that I might gather hunger
against his long-looked for return! Well were my soul if Christ were the
element, mine own element, and that I loved and breathed in him, and if I could
not live without him: I allow not laughter upon my self when He is away; yet He
never leaves the house, but the leaves drink-money behind him, and a pawn
that he will return: Woe, woe to me if he should go away and take all his
flitting with him: Even to dream of him is sweet: To build a house of pining
wishes for his return, to spin out a web of sorrow and care and languishing and
sighs, either dry or wet as they may be, because he has no leisure (if I may
sp^a^ so) to make a visit, or to see a poor friend, sweetneth and refre^heth
the thoughts of the heart: A mistie dew will stand for rain, and do some good,
and keep some greenness in the herbs, till our Lord's clouds ^ue upon the
earth, and send down a watering of rain: Truly I think Christ's mistie dew a
welcome message from heaven till my Lor^'s rain fall: Woe, woe is me for the
Lord's vineyard in Scotland: Howbeit the Father of the house embrace a child,
and feed him and kiss him; yet it is sorrow and sadness to the children, that
our poor mother has gotten her leave, and that our Father has given up house:
It is an unheartsom thing to see our Father and mother agree so ill, yet the
Bastards if they be fed care not: O Lord cait not water on Scotland's smoking
coal. It is a strange gate the saints go to heaven, our enemies often eat and
drink us, and we go to heaven through their bellies and stomachs, and they
vomit the church of God undigested among their hands, and even while we are
shut up in prisons by them, we advance in our j^urney. Remember my service to
my Lord, your kind Son, who was kind to me in my bonds, and was not ashamed
to own me: I would be glad that Christ got the morning-service of his life now
in his young years: It would suit him well to give Christ his young and green
love: Christ's stamp and seal would go far down in a young soul, If he would
receive the thrust of Christ's stamp: I would desire him to make search for
Christ, for Nobles now are but dry friends to Christ. The Grace of God our
Father, and the goodwill of him who dwelt in the bush be with your La.

To the Lady CARDONNESS ELDER. (180.)
Worthy and welbeloved in the Lord
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear from you in paper, that I may
know how your soul prospers: My desire and longing in, to hear that ye walk
in the truth, and that ye are content to follow the despised, but most lovely
Son of God: I cannot but recommend him unto you as your husband, your
welbeloved, your portion, your comfort and your joy: I speak this of that
lovely one, because I praise and commend the foord [as we use to speak] as I
find it: He has watered with his sweet comforts an oppressed prisoner: He was
always kind to my soul, but never so kind as now in my greatest extremittes:
I dine and sup with Christ: He visits my soul with the visitations of love in
the night-watches. I persuade my soul that this is the way to heaven, and his
own Truth, I now suffer for: I exhort you in the name of Christ to continue in
the truth which I delivered to you: Make Christ sure to your soul; for your day
draws nigh to an end: Many slide back now, who seemed to be Christ's friends,
and prove dishonest to him: But be ye faithful to the death, and ye shall have
the crown of life: This span-length of your days, whereof the Spirit of God
speaks, Psalm. 39. will within a short time, come to a finger-breadth and at
length to nothing: O how sweet and comfortable shall the feast of a good
conscience be to you, when your eye-strings shall break, your face wax pale,
and the breath turn cold, and your poor soul come sighing to the windows of the
house of clay of your dying body, and shall long to be out, and to have the
jailer to open the door, that the prisoner may be set at liberty: Ye draw nigh
the waterside, look your accounts: Ask for your guide to take you to the other
side: Let not the world be your portion; What have ye to do with dead clay? Ye
are not a bastard but a lawful begotten child; therefore set your heart on
the inheritance; Go up before hand and see your lodging: Look through all your
father's rooms in heaven, in your father's house are many dwelling-places: Men
take a sight of lands ere they buy them: I know Christ has made the bargain
already: But be kind to the house ye are going to, and see it often: Set your
heart on things that are above, where Christ is, at the right hand of God: Stir
up your husband to mind his own country at home: Counsel him to deal
mercifully with the poor people of God under him: They are Christ's and not
his; therefore desire him to show them merciful dealing and kindness, and to
be good to their souls. I desire you to write to me: It may be that my Parish
forget me; but my witness is in heaven I dow, not, I do not forget them:
They'are my sighs in the night and my tears in the day: I think my self like
an husband plucked from the wife of his youth: O Lord be my Judge what joy it
would be to my soul to hear, that my ministry has left the Son of God among
them, and that they are walking in Christ! Remember my love to your Son and
Daughtre: Desire them from me to seek the Lord in their youth, and to give him
the morning of their days: Acquaint them with the word of God and prayer.
Grace be with you. Pray for the prisoner of Christ: In my heart I forget you
not.

To Mr. JAMES HAMILTON. (181)
Reverend and dearly beloved in our Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Our acquaintance is neither in bodily
presence, nor in paper, but as sons of the same father and sufferers for the
same truth. Let no man doubt but the state of our question we are now forced to
stand to by suffering exile and imprisonment, is, If Jesus should reign over
his Kirk or not? Oh if my sinful arm could hold the crown on his head, howbeit
it should be stricken off from the shoulder blade. For your ensuing and feared
trial, my very dearest in our Lord Jesus, Alas what am I to speak, to comfort a
soldier of Christ, who has done an hundred times more for that worthy and
honorable cause then I can do? But I know these whom the world was not worthy
of, wandered up and down in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of
the earth, and that while there is one member of mystical Christ out of heaven,
that member must suffer strokes till our Lord Jesus draw in that member within
the gates of the new Jerusalem, which he will not fail to do at last; for not
one toe or finger of that body but it shall be take in within the city. What
can be our part in this pitched battle betwixt the Lamb and the Dragon? But to
receive the darts in patience, that rebound off us on upon our sweet Master, or
rather light first upon him and then rebound off him upon his servants. I think
it a sweet North Wind that blows first upon the fair face of the chief among
ten thousand and then lights upon our sinful and black faces: When once the
wind blows off him upon me, I think it has a sweet smell of Christ, and so
must besome more then a single cross. I know ye have a guard about you, and
your attendance and train for your safety, is far beyond your pursuers force or
fraud: It is good under feud to be near our war-house and strong hold: We can
do but little to resist them who persecut us and oppose him, but keep our
blood and our wounds to the next Court-day, when our complaints will be read:
If this day be not Christ's, I am sure the morrow shall be his. As for any
thing I do in my bonds when now and then a word falls from me, alas it is
very little! I am exceedingly grieved that any should conceive any thing to be
in such a broken, and empty reed, let no man impute it to me that the free and
unbought wind [for I gave nothing for it] blows upon an empty reed: I am his
overburdened debtor. I cry down with me, down, down with all the excellency of
the world, and up, up with Christ: Long, long may that fair One, that holy One
be on high: My curse be upon them that love him not. O how glad would I be if
his glory would grow out and spring up out of my bonds and sufferings!
Certainly since I became his prisoner, he has won the yolk and heart of my
soul: Christ is even become a new Christ to me and his love greener then it
was, and now I strive no more with him, his love shall carry it away: I lay
down my self under his love, I desire to sing and to cry and to proclaim my
self even under the water, in his common, and eternally indebted to his
kindness: I will not offer to quite commons with him [as we use to say] for
that will not be: All, all for evermore be Christ's. What further trials are
before me I know not, but I know Christ will have a saved soul of me, over on
the other side of the water, in the yonder side of crosses and beyond men's
wrongs. I had but one eye and that they have put out: My one joy, next to the
flower of my joys, Christ, was to preach my sweetest, sweetest Master and the
glory of his Kingdom, and it seemed no cruelty to them to put out the poor
man's one eye. And now I am seeking about to see if suffering will speak my
fair One's praises, and I am trying if a dumb man's tongue can raise one note
or one of Zion's springs to advance my Welbeloved's glory: Oh if he would make
some glory to himself out of a dumb prisoner! I go with child of his word, I
cannot be delivered, none here will have my Master, Alas! What aileth them at
him? I bless you for your prayers, add to them praises: As I am able I pay you
home. I commend your diving in Christ's Testament, I would I could set out the
dead man's goodwill to his friends in his sweet Testament: Speak a prisoner's
hearty commendations to Christ: fear not, your ten days will over. These that
are gathered against mount Zion, their eyes shall melt away in their eye-holes
and their tongues consume away in their mouths, and Christ's withered garden
shall grow green again in Scotland: My Lord Jesus has a word hid in heaven for
Scotland, not yet brought out. Grace be with you.

To MISTRESS STUART. [182]
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am sorry that ye take it so hardly that I
have not written to you. I am judged to be that which I am not: I fear if I
were put in the fire, I should melt away and fall down in sheards of painted
nature: For truly I have little stuff at home, that is worth the eye of God's
servants: If there be any thing of Christ's in me (as I dare not deny some of
his work) it is but a spunk of borrowed fire that can scarce warm my self and
has little heat for standers by: I would sain have that which ye and others
believe I have, but ye are only witnesses to my utter side and to some words
in paper. Oh that he would give me more then papergrace or tongue-grace! Were
it not that want paineth me, I should have skailed house and gone a begging
long since, but Christ has left me with some hunger that is more hot then
wise, and is ready often to say, If Christ longed for me as I do for him, we
should not be long in meeting, and if he loved my company as well as I do his,
even while I am writing this letter to you, we should flee in other's arms: But
I know there is more will then wit in this languor and pining love for Christ,
and no marvel; for Christ's love would have hot harvest long ere mid-summer:
But if I have any love to him, Christ has both love to me and wit to guide his
love: and I see, the best thing I have, has as much dross beside it, as might
curse me and it both; and if it were for no more, we have need of a Savior to
pardon the very faults and diseases and weakness of the new man, and to take
away [to say so] our godly sins, or the sins of our sanctification and the
dross and scum of spiritual love: woe, woe is me! O what need is there then of
Christ's calling to scour and cleanse and wash away an ugly old body of sin,
the very image of Satan! I know nothing surer then that there is an office for
Christ among us: I wish for no other heaven in this side of the last sea, that
I must cross, then this service of Christ, to make my blackness beauty, my
deadness life, my guiltiness sanctification: I long much for that day when I
will be holy: O what spots are yet unwashen! O that I could change the skin of
the leopard and the Moor, and niffer it with some of Christ's fairness! Were my
blackness and Christ's beauty carded through other [as we use to speak] his
beauty and holiness would eat up my filthiness: But Oh I have not casten old
Adam's hew and color yet! I trow the best of us has a smell yet of the old
loathsome body of sin and guiltiness: Happy are they for evermore who can employ
Christ and set his blood and death on work, to make clean work to God, of foul
souls: I know, it is our sin, that we would have sanctification on the sunny
side of the the hill, and holiness with nothing but summer, and no crosses at
all: Sin has made us as tender as if were made of paper or glass. I am often
thinking what I would think of Christ and burning quick together, of Christ and
torturing and hot melted lead poured in at mouth and navel: yet I have some
weak experience [but very weak indeed] that suppose Christ and hell's torments
were married together and if there were no finding of Christ at all, except I
went to hell's furnace, that there and in no other place I could meet with him,
I trow, if I were as I have been since I was his prisoner, I would beglodging
for God's sake in hell, hottest furnace, that I might rub souls with Christ:
But God be thanked I shall find him in a better lodging: We get Christ better
cheap then so, when he is rouped to us, we get him but with a shower of
summertroubles in this life, as sweet and as soft to believers as a May-dew. I
would have you and my self helping Christ mystical to weep for his wife, and O
thatf we could mourn for Christ buried in Scotland, and for his two slain
witnesses killed, because they prophesied! If we could so importune and solicit
God, our buried Lord and his two buried witnesses should rise again: Earth and
clay and stone will nto bear down Christ and the Gospel in Scotland. I know not
if I will see the second temple and the glory of it; but the Lord has deceived
me if it be not to be reared up again: I would wish to give Christ his
welcome-home again: My blessing, my joy, my glory and love be on the
home-comer. I find no better use of suffering then that Christ's winnowing
puts chaff and corn in the saints to sundry places, and discovers our
dross from his gold, so, as corruption and grace are so seen, that Christ says
in the furnace, that is mine and this is yours: The scum and the grounds, thy
stomach against the persecuters, thy impatience, thy unbelief, thy quarreling,
these are thine: And faith, on-waiting, love, joy, courage, are mine. Oh let me
die one of Christ's on-waiters and one of his attendants: I know your heart and
Christ are married together, it were not good to make a divorce: Rue not of
that meeting and marriage with such a husband: Pray for me his prisoner. Grace,
grace be with you.

To Mr HUGH Mc KAILL. (183)
Reverend and dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter, I bless you for it:
My dry root would take more dew and summer-rain then it gets, were it not
Christ will have dryness and deadness in us to work upon: If there were no
timber to work upon, art would die and never be seen: I see, grace has a field
to play upon and to course up and down in our wants, so that I am often
thanking God, not for guiltiness, but for guiltiness for Christ to whet and
sharpen his grace upon: I am half content to have boils for my Lord Jesus's
plasters: sickness has this advantage that it draws our sweet Physician's
hand and his holy and soft fingers to touch our withered and leper skins: it is
a blessed fever that fetches Christ to the bedside: I think my Lord's How
do thou with it, sick body? Is worth all my pained nights: Surely I have no
more for Christ but emptiness and want; take or leave, he will get me no other
wise. I must sell my self and my wants to him, but I have no price to give for
him: If he would put a fair and a real seal upon his love to me, and bestow
upon me a larger share of Christ's love [which I would fainest be in hands with
of any thing, I except not heaven it self] I should go on sighing and singing
under his cross: But the worst is, many take me for somebody, because the wind
blows upon a withered prisoner: But the truth is, I am both lean and thin in
that wherein many believe I abound. I would [if bartering were in my power]
niffer joy with Christ's love and faith, and in stead of the and hot sunshine,
becontent to walk under a cloudy shadow with more grief and sadness, to have
more faith and a fair occasion of setting forth and commending Christ, and to
make that lovely One, that fair One, that sweetest and dearest Lord Jesus,
market-sweet for many ears and hearts in Scotland: and if it were in my power
to roup Christ to the three Kingdoms and withal to persuade buyers to come,
and to take such sweet wares as Christ, I would thin^ to have many sweet
bargains betwixt Christ and the sons of men. I would I could be humble and go
with a low sail, I would I had desires with wings and running upon wheels,
swift and active and speedy in longing for Christ's honor: But I know my Lord
is as wise here, as I dow be thirsty, and infinitely more zealous of his honor
then I can be hungered for the manifestation of it to men and angels: But Oh
that my Lord would take my desires off my hand, and add a thousand-fold more
unto them, and sow spiritual inclinations upon them, for the coming of
Christ's Kingdom to the sons of men, that they might be higher and deeper and
longer and broader! For my longest measures are too short for Christ, my depth
is ebb, and the breadth of my affections to Christ narrow and pinched. Oh for
an ingine and a wit to prescribe ways to men how Christ might be all, in all
the world! Wit is here behind affection, and affection behind obligation. Oh
how little dow I give to Christ: and how much has he given me! Oh that I could
sing grace's praises, and love's praises! Seeing I was like a fool, solisting
the Law and making moyen to the Law's court for mercy, and found challenges
that way; but now I deny that Judge's power; for I am Grace's man; I hold not
worth a drink of water of the Law or of any Lord but Jesus: And till I
bethought me of this, I was slain with doubtings and fears and terrors. I
praise the new court, and the new Landlord, and the new Salvation purchased in
Jesus his name and at his instance: Let the old man, if he please, go make his
moan to the Law and seek acquaintance thereaway, because he is condemned in
that Court: I hope, the new man and I, and Christ together shall not be heard:
and this is the more soft and the more easy way for me and for my cross
together: Seeing Christ sings my welcome-home, and takes me in and makes
short counts and short work of reckoning betwixt me and my Judge, I must be
Christ's man and his Tennant and subject to his Court: I am sure, suffering for
Christ could not be born otherwise: But I give my hand and my faith to all who
would suffer for Christ, they shall be well handled and fare well in the same
way, that I have found the cross easy and light. Grace be with you.

Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: If Christ were as I am, that time could work
upon him to alter him, or that the morrow could be a new day to him, or bring a
new mind upon him, as it is to me a new day, I could not keep a house or a
covenant with him: But I find Christ to be Christ, and that he is far, far,
even infinite heavens height above man: And that is all our happiness. Sinners
can do nothing but make wounds that Christ may heal them, and make debts that
he may pay them, and make falls that he may raise them, and make deaths that he
may quicken them, and spin out and dig hells to themselves that he may ransom
them: Now I will bless the Lord that ever there was such a thing as the free
Grace of God and a free ransom given for sold souls: Only, alas guiltiuess
makes me ashamed to apply Christ, and to think it pride in me to put out my
unclean and withered hand to such a Savior! but it is neither shame nor pride
for a drowning man to swim to a rock, nor for a ship-broken soul, to run
himself a shore upon Christ: Suppose once I be guilty, need force I cannot, I
dow not go by Christ: We take in good part that pride, that beggars beg from
the richer: and who is so poor as we, and who is so rich as he who sells fine
gold, Rev. 3: 18. I see then, it is our best [let guiltiness plead what it
listeth] that we have no mean under the covering of heaven but to creep in
lowly and submissively with our wants to Christ: I have also cause to give his
cross as good name and report. O how worthy is Christ of my feckless and light
suffering, and how has he deserved it at my hands, that for his honor and
glory I should lay my back under seven hells pain in one, if he call me to
that! but alas my soul is like a ship run on ground through ebbeness of water:
I am sanded, and and my love is sanded: I find not how to bring it on float
again, it is so cold and dead that I see not how to bring it to a flame: Fie, fie
upon the meeting that my love has given Christ: woe, woe is me, I have a lover
Christ, and yet I want love for him: I have a lovely and desirable Lord who is
loveworthy, and who beggeth my love and heart and I have nothing to give him.
Dear Brother, come further in on Christ and see a new treasure in him: come in
and look down and see Angels wonder, and heaven and earth's wonder of love,
sweetness, majesty and excellency in him. I forget you not, pray for me that
our Lord would be pleased to send me among you again, fraughted and full of
Christ. Grace, grace be with you.

To JOHN BELL Elder. (185)
My very loving friend
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have very often and long expected your
letter, but if ye be well in soul and body I am the less solicitous: I beseech
you in the Lord Jesus to mind your country above, and now when old age, the
twilight going before the darkness of the grave, and the falling low of your
sun before your night, is now come upon you, advise with Christ ere ye put your
foot in the ship and turn your back on this life: Many are beguiled with this,
that they are tree of scandalous and crying abominations; but the tree that
brings not forth good fruit is for the fire: the man that is not born again
cannot enter into the kingdom of God: common honesty will not take men to
heaven: Alas that men should think they ever met with Christ, who had never a
sick night through the terrors of God in their soul or a sore heart for sin: I
know the Lord has given you light and the knowledge of his will, but that is
not all, neither will that do your turn: I wish you an awakned soul, and that
ye beguile not your self in the matter of your salvation. My dear Brother,
search your self with the candle of God, and try if the life of God and Christ
be in you: Salvation is not casten to every man's door: Many are carried over
see and land to a far country in a ship, whileas they sleep much of all the
way: but men are not landed at heaven sleeping: The righteous are scarcily
saved, and many run as fast as either ye or I, who miss the prize and the
crown: God send me salvation, and save me from a disappointment, and I seek no
more: Men think it but a stryde or a step over to heaven, but when so few are
saved, even of a mumber like the sand of the sea, but a handful and a remnant
(as God's word says) what cause have we to shake our selves out of our selves
and to ask our poor soul, whether go thou? where shall thou lodge at night?
Where are thy charters and writes of thy heavenly inheritance? I have known a
man turn a key in a door and lock it by: Many men leap over [as they think] and
leap in. O see! see that ye give not your salvation a wrong cast, and think all
is well and leave your soul loose and uncertain: look to your building, and to
your groundstone, and what signs of Christ are in you, and set this world
behind your back: It is time now in the evening, to cease from your ordinary
work, and high time to know of your lodging at night: It is your Salvation that
is in dependence, and that is a great and weighty business, though many make
light of the matter. Now, the Lord enable you by his grace to work it out.

Aberd. 1637. Your lawful and loving Pastor, S. R.

To WILLIAM GORDON Of Robertovvn. (186)
Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: So often as I think on our case in our
soldiers night-watch, and of our sighting life in the fields, while we are
here: I am forced to say, prisoners in a dungeon condemned by a judge, to want
the light of the sun and moon and candle, till their dying day, are no more,
nay not so much to be pitied as we are; for they weary of their life, they hate
their prison: But we fall to in our prison, where we see little, to drink our
selves drunk with the night-pleasures of our weak dreams, and we long for no
better life then this; but at the blast of the last trumpet, and the shout of
the Archangel, when God shall take down the shepherd's tent of this fading
world, we shall not have so much as a drink of water of all the dreams that we
now build on. Alas that the sharp and bitter blasts on face and sides which
meet us in this life, have not learned us mortification, and made us dead to
this world! We buy our own sorrow, and we pay dear for it, when we spend out
our love, our joy, our desires, our confidence upon an handful of snow and ice
that time will melt away to nothing, and go thirsty out of the drunken Innes
when all is done: Alas that we enquire not for the clear fountain; but are so
foolish as to drink foul muddy and rotten waters even till our bedtime; and
then in the resurrection when we shall be awakned, our yesternight's sour
drink and swinish dregs shall rift up upon us, and sick, sick shall many a
soul be then: I know no wholesome fountain but one: I know not a thing worth the
buying but heaven: And my own mind is, if comparison were made betwixt Christ
and heaven, I would sell heaven with my blessing and buy Christ. Oh if I could
raise the market for Christ, and heighten the market a pound for a penny, and
cry up Christ in men's estimation ten thousand talents more then men think of
him! But they are shaping him and crying him down and valuing him at their
unworthy halfpenny, or else exchanging and bartering Christ with the miserable
old fallen house of this vain world, or then they lend him out upon interest
and play the usurers with Christ: Because they profess him and give out before
men that Christ is their treasure and stock, and in the mean time, praise of
men, and a name, and case, and the summmer-sun of the Gospel is the usury they
would be at, so when the trial comes, they quite the stock for the interest
and loose all: Happy are they who can keep Christ by himself alone, and keep
him clean and whole till God come and count with them. I know in your hard and
heavy trials long since, ye thought well and highly of Christ; but truly no
cross should be old to us: We should not forget them, because years are come
betwixt us and them, and cast them by hand as we do old clothes: We may make a
cross old in time, new in use, and as fruitful as in the beginning of it: God
is where and what he was seven years ago, what ever change be in us: I speak
not this, as if I thought ye had forgotten what God did to have your love long
since; but that ye may awake your self in this sleepy age, and remember
fruitfully of Christ's first wooing and suiting of your love both with fire and
water, and try if he got his answer, or if ye be yet to give him it: For I
find in my self that water runs not faster through a sieve, then our
warnings slip from us; for I have lost and casten by hands many summonds the
Lord sent to me, and therefore the Lord has given me double charges, that I
trust in God shall not rive me. I bless his great name who is no niggard in
holding in crosses upon me, but spends largely his rods, that he may save me
from this perishing world: how plentiful God is in means of this kind is
esteemed by many, one of God's unkind mercies; but Christ's cross is neither a
cruel nor unkind mercy, but the love-token of a father. I am sure a lover
chasing us for our well and to have our love, should not be run away from or
fled. God send me no worse mercy then the sanctified cross of Christ
portendeth, and I am sure I should be happy and blessed. Pray for me that I may
find house-room in the Lord's house to speak in his name. Remember my dearest
love in Christ to your wife. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1636. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To my Lady BOYD. (187)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace from God our father and from our Lord Jesus Christ, be
multiplied upon you. I have reasoned with your son at large, I rejoice to see
him set his face in the right airth, now when the Nobles love the sunny side of
the Gospel best, and are afraid that Christ want soldiers and shall not be
able to do for himself. Madam, our debts of obligation to Christ are not
small, the freedom of grace and salvation is the wonder of man and Angels, but
mercy in our Lord scorneth hire: Ye are bound to lift Christ on high, who has
given you eyes to discern the Devil now coming out in in his white's, and the
Idolatry and Apostasy of the time well washen with fair pretenses, but the skin
is black and the water foul: It were art, I confess, to wash a black Devil and
make him white. I am in strange up's and down's, and seven times a day I lose
ground, I am put often to swimming, and again my feet are set on the rock that
is higher then my self: He has now let me see 4 Things I never saw before 1.
The supper will be great cheer that is up in the great hall with the royal King
of glory, when the four-hours, the standing drink in this driery wilderness is
so sweet: When he blows a kiss a far off to his poor heart broken mourners in
Zion, and sends me but his hearty commendations till we meet, I am confounded
with wonder to think what it shall be, when the fairest among the sons of men
shall lay a King's sweet soft cheek to the sinful cheeks of poor sinners. O
time, time, go swiftly and hasten that day! Sweet Lord Jesus post, come flying
like a young Heart or a Roe upon the mountains of separation. I think we should
tell the hours carefully and look often how low the sun is: For love has no
ho, it is pained, pained in it self, till it come in grips with the party
beloved. 2. I find Christ's absence love's sickness and love's death: The wind
that blows out of the airth where my Lord Jesus reigns, is sweet-smelled,
soft, joyful, and heartsom to a soul burnt with absence. It is a painful
battle for a soul sick of love to fight with absence and delays: Christ's not
yet, is a stounding of all the joints and liths of the soul: a nod of his head
when he is under a mask would be half a pawn: to say, fool, what aileth thee?
He is coming, would be life to a dead man. I am often in my dumb sabbaths
seeking a new plea with my Lord Jesus, God forgive me: and I care not, if there
be not two or three ounce weight of black wrath in my cup. For the 3 Thing, I
have seen my abominable vileness: If I were well known there would none in this
Kingdom ask how I do: Men take my ten to be an hundred, but I am a deeper
hypocrite and shallower professor then every one believes, God knows I
feign not: But I think, my reckonings on the one page written in great
letters, and his mercy to such a forlorn and wretched Dyvour on the other, more
then a miracle. If I could get my finger ends upon a full assurance, I trow I
should grip fast: But my cup wants not gall, and upon my part despair might
be almost excused, if every one in this land saw my inner side: But I know I am
one of them who have made great sale and a free market to free grace: If I
could be saved, as I would fain believe, sure I am I have given Christ's blood,
his free grace and the bowels of his mercy, a large field to work upon, and
Christ has manifested his art [I dare not say, to the uttermost; for he can,
if he would, forgive all the Devils and damned reprobates in respect of the
wideness of his mercy] I say, to an admirable degree. 4. I am stricken with fear
of unthankfulness: This Apostate Kirk has played the harlot with many lovers;
they are spitting in the face of my lovely King and mocking him and I dow not
mend it, and they are running away from Christ in troops, and I dow not mourn
and be grieved for it: I think Christ lies like an old forecasten castle
forsaken of the inhabitants, all men run away now from him: Truth, innocent
Truth goes mourning and wringing her hands in sackcloth and ashes. Woe, woe,
woe is me, for the virgin-daughter of Scotland: Woe, woe to the inhabitants of
this land, for they are gone back with a perpetual backsliding: These things
take me so up, that a borrowed bed, another man's fireside, the wind upon my
face. [I being driven from my lovers and dear acquaintance and my poor flock,]
find no room in my sorrow: I have no spare of odd sorrow for these: Only I
think the sparrows and swallows that build their nests in the Kirk of Anwoth
blessed birds: Nothing has given my faith a harder back-set, till it crack
again, then my closed mouth: But let me be miserable my self alone, God keep my
dear brethren from it: But still I keep breath, and when my royal and never,
never-enough praised King returns to his sinful prisoner, I ride upon the
high places of Jacob, I divide Shechem, I triumph in his strength: If this
Kingdom would glorify the Lord in my behalf, I desire to be weighed in God's
even balance in this point, if I think not my wages paid to the full: I shall
crave no more hire of Christ. Madam, pity me in this, and help me to praise
him: For what ever I be, the chief of sinners, a devil and a most guilty devil,
yet it is the apple of Christ's eye, his honor and glory as the head of the
church, that I suffer for now, and that I will go to eternity with. I am
greatly in love with Mr M. M. I see him stamped with the image of God. I hope
well of your son my Lord Boyd. Your La: and your children have a prisoner's
prayers. Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. May. 1. 1637. Your La: at all obedience in Christ, S. R.

To Mr THOMAS GARVEN. (188.)
Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I rejoice that ye cannot be quite of Christ
[if I may speak so] but he must, he will have you: Betake your self to Christ,
my dear Brother: It is a great business to make quite of superfluities and of
these things which Christ cannot dwell with. I am content with my own cross,
that Christ has made mine by an eternal lot, because it is Christ's and mine
together. I marvel not that winter is without heaven, for there is no winter
within it: All the saints therefore have their own measure of winter before
their eternal summer. Oh for the long day and the high sun and the fair garden
and the King's great city up above these visible heavens! What God lays on,
let us suffer: For some have one cross, some seven, some ten, some half a
cross, yet all the saints have whole and full joy, and seven crosses have seven
joys. Christ is cumbred with me [to speak so] and my cross, but he falls not
off me, we are not at variance. I find the very glooms of Christ's wooing a
soul, sweet and lovely: I had rather have Christ's buffet and love-stroke then
another King's kiss: Speak evil of Christ who will, I hope to die with
love-thoughts of him. Oh that there are so few tongues in heaven and earth to
extol him! I wish his praises go not down amongst us: Let not Christ be low
and lightly esteemed in the midst of us, but let all hearts and all tongues
cast in their portion and contribute something to make him great in mount Zion.
Thus recommending you to his grace, and remembering my love to your wife and
mother and your kind brother R. and entreating you to remember my bonds, I
rest.

Aberd. Sept. 8. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the Lord of MONCRIEFE. (189)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Although not acquaint, yet at the desire of
your worthy sister, the Lady Ley's, and upon the report of your kindness to
Christ and his oppressed truth, I am bold to write to you, earnestly desiring
you to join with us [so many as in these bounds profess Christ] to wrestle with
God one day of the week, especially the Wedensday, for mercy to this fallen and
decayed Kirk, and to such as suffer for Christ's name, and for your own
necessities and the necessities of others who are by covenant engaged in that
business: For we have no other armor in these evil times but prayers, now when
wrath from the Lord is gone out against this backsliding land: for ye know we
can have no true public fasts, neither are the true causes of our humiliation
ever laid before the people. Now, very worthy Sir, I am glad in the Lord, that
the Lord reserveth any of your place, or of note, in this time of common
Apostasy, to come forth in public to bear Christ's name before men, when the
great men think Christ a cumbersom neighbor and that religion carries
hazards, trials and persecutions with it. I persuade my self, it is your glory
and your garland and shall be your joy in the day of Christ, and the standing
of your house and seed to inherit the earth, that ye truly and sincerely
profess Christ: Neither is our King, whom the father has crowned in mount
Zion, so weak, that he cannot do for himself and his own cause. I verily
believe, they are blessed who can hold the crown upon his head and carry up the
train of his robe royal, and that he shall yet be victorious and triumph in
this land. It is our part to back our royal King, howbeit there were not six in
all the land to follow him. It is wisdom now to take up and discern the devil
and the Antichrist coming out in their whites, and the Apostasy and Idolatry of
this land washen with foul water: I confess it is art to wash the Devil till
his skin be white: For my self, Sir, I have bought a plea against Christ since
I came hither, in judging my princely Master angry at me, because I was cast
out of the vineyard as a withered tree, my dumb sabbaths working me much
sorrow: But I see now sorrow has not eyes to read love written upon the cross
of Christ, and therefore I pass from my rash plea: Woe, woe is me that I should
have received a slander of Christ's love to my soul: and for all this, my Lord
Jesus has forgiven all, as not willing to be heard with such a fool, and is
content to be as it were confined with me and to bear me company and to feast a
poor oppressed prisoner. And now I write it under my hand, Worthy Sir, that I
think well and honorably of this cross of Christ: I wonder that he will take
any glory from the like of me: I find that when he but sends his hearty
commendations to me, and but blows a kiss afar off, I am confounded with
wondering what the supper of the Lamb will be, up in our father's dining-palace
of glory, since the four-hours in his dismal wilderness, and when in prisons
and in our sad days a kiss of Christ is so comfortable, O how sweet and
glorious shall our case be, when that fairest among the sons of men shall lay
his fair face to our now sinful faces, and wipe away all tears from our eyes!
O Time, Time, run swiftly and hasten that day! O sweet Lord Jesus, come flying
like a roe or a young heart! Alas that we blind fools are fallen in love with
moonshine and shadows! how sweet is the wind that blows out of the airth
where Christ is! Every day we may see some new thing in Christ, his love has
neither brim nor bottom. Oh if I had help to praise him! He knows if my
sufferings glorify his name, and encourage others to stand fast for the honor
of our supreme Lawgiver Christ, my wages then are paid to the full. Sir, help
me to love that never-enough praised Lord. I find now that the faith of the
saints under suffering for Christ is fair before the wind and with full sails
carried upon Christ, and I hope to lose nothing in this furnace but dross; for
Christ can triumph in a weaker man then I am, if there be any such: And when
all is done, his love paineth me and leaves me under such debt to Christ as I
can neither pay principal nor interest. Oh if he would comprize my self, and if
I were sold to him as a bondman, and that he would take me home to his house
and fireside; for I have nothing to render to him! Then after me let no man
think hard of Christ's sweet cross, for I would not change my sighs with the
painted laughter of all my adversaries. I desire grace in patience to wait on,
and to lie upon the brink till the water fill and flow: I know he is fast
coming. Sir, ye will excuse my boldness, and till it please God I see you, ye
have the prayers of a prisoner of Christ, to whom I recommend you and in whom I
rest.

Aberd. May, 14. 1637. Yours at all obedience in Christ, S. R.

To JOHN CLARK. (190.)
Loving Brother.
HOld fast Christ without wavering, and contend for the faith, because Christ
is not easily gotten nor kept: The lazy professor has put heaven [as it
were] at the very next door, and thinks to fly up to heaven in his bed and
in a night-dream; but truly that is not so easy a thing as most men believe:
Christ himself did sweat ere he won this city, howbeit he was the freeborn
Heir. It is Christianity, My heart, to be sincere, unfeigned, honest and
upright-hearted before God, and to live and serve God, suppose there were not
one man or woman in all the world dwelling beside you to eye you: Any little
grace that ye have, see that it be sound and true: Ye may put a difference
betwixt you and reprobats if ye have these marks. 1. If ye prize Christ and
his truth so, as ye will sell all and buy him and suffer for it. 2. If the love
of Christ keeps you back from sinning more then the Law or fear of hell. 3.
If ye be humble, and deny your own will, wit, credit, ease, honor, the world
and the vainity and glory of it. 4. Your profession must not be barren and void
of good works. 5. Ye must in all things aim at God's honor, ye must eat,
drink, sleep, buy, sell, sit, stand, speak, pray, read, and hear the word with
a heart-purpose that God may be honored. 6. Ye must show your self an enemy to
sin, and reprove the works of darkness, such as drunkenness, swearing and
lying, albeit the company should hate you for doing so. 7. Keep in mind the
truth of God that ye heard me teach, and have nothing to do with the
corruptions and new guises entered into the house of God. 8. Make conscience of
your calling, in covenants, in buying and selling. 9. Acquaint your self with
daily praying, commit all your ways and actions to God by prayer, supplication
and thank giving, and count not much of being mocked; for Christ Jesus was
mocked before you. Persuade your self that this is the way of peace and comfort
I now suffer for, I dare go to death and in to eternity with it, though men
may possibly seek another way. Remember me in your prayers, and the state of
this oppressed Church. Grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Your soul's Well-wisher. S. R.

To CARDONNESS Elder. (191)
Much honored Sir.
I long to hear how your soul prospers: I wonder that ye write not to me, for
the holy Ghost bears me witness, I cannot, I dare not, I dow not forget you,
nor the souls o these with you, who are redeemed by the blood of the greaf
Shepherd: Ye are in my heart in the night watches, ye are my^ joy and crown in
the day of Christ: O Lord bear witness, if my soul thirsts for any thing out
of heaven, more then for your salvation: Let God lay me in an even balance and
try me in this. Love heaven let your heart be on it: Up, up and visit the new
land and view the fair city and the white throne and the Lamb, the bride's
husband, in his bridegroom's clothes sitting on it: It were time your soul
should cast it self and all your burdens upon Christ. I beseech you by the
wounds of your Redeemer, and by your compearance before him and by the
salvation of your soul, lose no more time, run fast for it is late: God has
sworn by himself who made the world and time, that time shall be no more, Rev.
10 Ye are now upon the very border of the other life; your Lord cannot be
blamed for not giving you warning: I have taught the truth of Christ to you and
delivered unto you the whole counsel of God, and I have stood before the Lord
for you, and I shall yet still stand: awake, awake to do righteously: Think
not to be eased of the burdens and debts that are on your house, by oppressing
any or being rigorous to these that are under you: remember how I endeavored
to walk before you in this matter as an example: behold here am I, witness
against me, before the Lord and his Anointed, whose ox or whoseass have I
taken? Whom have I defrauded? Whom have I oppressed? Who knows how my soul
feeds upon a good conscience, when I remember how I spent this body in
feeding the lambs of Christ? At my first entry hither, I grant, I took a
stomach against my Lord, because he had casten me over the dike of the vineyard
as a dry tree, and would have no more of my service: My dumb sabbaths broke my
heart, and I would not be comforted: but now he whom my soul love this come
again, and it pleases him to feast me with the kisses of his love: A King
dineth with me and his spikenard casts a sweet smell: The Lord my witness is
above, that I write my heart to you, I never knew by my nine years preaching,
so much of Christ's love, as he has taught me in Aberden by six months
imprisonment. I charge you in Christ's name help me to praise and show that
people and country, the loving kindness of the Lord to my soul, that so my
sufferings may someway preach to them when I am silent: He has made me know
now better then before, what it is to be crucified to the world: I would not
now give a drink of cold water for all the world's kindness: I ow no service to
it: I am not the flesh's debtor: My Lord Jesus has dated his prisoner, and
has thoughts of love concerning me: I would not exchange my sighs with the
laughing of my adversaries. Sir, I write this to inform you, that ye may know
it is the truth of Christ I now suffer for, and he has sealed nay sufferings
with the comforts of his spirit on my soul, and I know he puts not his seal
upon blank paper. Now, Sir, I have no comfort earthly, but to know that I have
espoused, and shall present a bride to Christ in that congregation. The Lord
has given you much, and therefore he will require much of you again: Number
your talents and see what ye have to render back again, ye cannot be enough
persuaded of the shortness of your time: I charge you to write to me, and in
the fear of God be plain with me, whether or no ye have made your salvation
sure, I am confident and hope the best, but I know your reckonings with your
Judge are many and deep. Sir, be not beguiled, neglect not your one thing
[Philip. 3, 13] your one necessary thing [Luke 10: 42] the good part that shall
not be taken from you. Look beyond time: things here are but moonshine, they
have but Childrens wit who are delighted with shadows and deluded withfeathers
flying in the air. Desire your children in the morning of their life to begin
and seek the Lord, and to remember their Creator in the days of their youth
[Eccles. 12: 1.] to cleanse their way by taking heed thereto according to God's
word [Ps. 119: 9.] youth is a glassy age: Satan finds a swept chamber [for the
most part] in youth-hood, and a garnished lodging for himself and his train:
Let the Lord have the flower of their age: The best sacrifice is due to him:
Instruct them in this, that they have a soul, and that this life is nothing in
comparison of eternity: They will have much need of God's conduct in this
world, to guide them by these rocks upon which most men split; but far more
need when it comes to the hour of death and their compearance before Christ. O
that there were such a heart in them to fear the name of the great and
dreadful God, who has laid up great things for these that love and fear him!
I pray that God may be their portion. Show others of my parishoners, that I
write to them my best wishes and the blessings of their lawful Pastor: Say to
them from me, that I beseech them by the bowels of Christ, to keep in mind the
Doctrine of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, which I taught them; that so
they may lay hold on eternal life, striving together for the faith of the
Gospel, and making sure salvation to themselves: Walk in love and do
righteousness: seek peace, love one another, wait for the coming of our Master
and Judge: Receive no doctrine contrary to that which I delivered to you: If ye
fall away and forget it and that Catechism which I taught you, and so forsake
your own mercy, the Lord be judge betwixt you and me, I take heaven and earth
to witness, that such shall eternally perish; but if they serve the Lord, great
will their reward be, when they and I shall stand before our Judge. Set forward
up the mountain to meet with God: climb up, for your Savior calls on you. It
may be, God call you to your rest when I am far from you, but ye have my love
and the desires of my heart for your souls welfare. He that is holy, keep you
from falling and establish you, till his own glorious appearance.

I Long to hear whether or not your soul be hand-fasted with Christ: Lose your
time no longer: Flee the follies of youth: Gird up the loins of your mind, and
make you ready for meeting the Lord. I have often summoned you, and now I
summond you again, to compear before your Judge, to make a reckoning of your
life: while ye have Time, look upon your papers and consider your ways: O that
there were such an heart in you, as to think what an ill conscience will be to
you, when year upon the border of eternity, and your one foot out of time! O
then, ten thousand thousand floods of tears cannot extinguish these flames, or
purchase to you one hour's release from that pain! O how sweet a day have ye
had! But this is a fair day that runs fast away, see how ye have spent it,
and consider the necessity of salvation: and tell me [in the fear of God] if ye
have made it sure: I am persuaded ye have a conscience that will be speaking
somewhat to you: Why will ye die and destroy yourself? I charge you in Christ's
name to rouse up your conscience, and begin to indent and contract with Christ
in time while salvation is in your offer: This is the accepted time, this is
the day of salvation: play the merchant, for ye cannot expect another
market day when this is done; therefore let me again beseech you to consider in
this your day, the things that belong to your peace, before they be hid from
your eyes. Dear Brother, fulfill my joy, and begin to seek the Lord while he
may be found: Forsake the follies of deceiving and vain youth: Lay hold upon
eternal life: Whoring, night-drinking, and mispending of the sabbath, and
neglecting of prayer in your house, and refusing of an offered salvation, will
burn up your soul with the terrors of the Almighty, when your awakened
conscience shall flee in your face. Be kind and loving to your wife, make
conscience of cherishing her and not being rigidly austere. Sir, I have not a
tongue to express the glory that is laid up for you in your father's house, if
ye reform your doings and frame your heart to return to the Lord. Ye know this
world is but a shadow, a shortliving creature, under the law of time; within
less then fifty years, when ye look back to it, ye shall laugh at the
evanishing vanities thereof, as feathers flying in the air, and at the houses
of sand within the sea-mark, which the children of men are building: Give up
with courting of this vain world: Seek not the bastard's movables, but the
Son's heritage in heaven. Take a trial of Christ, look unto him and his love
shall so change you, that ye shall be taken with him and never choose to go
from him: I have experience of his sweetness in this house of my pilgrimage
here: My witness who is above, knows, I would not exchange my sighs and tears
with the laughing of the fourteen Prelates: There is nothing will make you a
Christian indeed, but a taste of the sweetness of Christ, come and see will
speak best to your soul: I would fain hope good of you: be not discouraged at
broken and spilt- resolutions, but to it, and to it again: Woo about Christ,
till ye get your soul espoused as a chaste virgin to him: Use the means of
profiting with your conscience: Pray in your family, and read, the word:
Remember how our Lord's day was spent when I was among you: It will be a great
challenge to you before God, if ye forget the good that was done within the
walls of your house on the Lord's days, and if ye turn aside after the
fashions of this world, and if ye go not in time to the kirk to wait on the
public worship of God, and if ye tarry not at it, till all the exercises of
religion be ended: Give God some of your time both morning and evening and
afternoon, and in so doing, rejoice the heart of a poor oppressed prisoner. Rue
upon your own soul, and from your heart fear the Lord. Now he that brought
again from the dead the great Shepherd of his sheep, by the blood of the
eternal Covenant, establish your heart with his grace, and present you before
his presence with joy.

Much honored Sir.
I Will not impute your not writing to me, to forgetfulness: how ever, I have
one above who forgets me not, nay, he grows in his kindess: It has
pleased his holy Majesty to take me from the pulpit and teach me many things in
my exile and prison that were mysteries to me before: As, 1. I see his
bottomless and boundless love and kindness, and my jealousies and ravings,
which at my first entry into this furnace were so foolish and bold, as to say
to Christ, who is truth it self, in his face, thou lie. I had well nigh lost
my grips: I wondered if it was Christ or not, for the mist and smoke of my
perturbed heart, made me mistake my Master Jesus: My faith was dim and hope
frozen and cold, and my love which caused jealousies, it had some warmness and
heat and smoke but no flame at all: yet I was looking for some good of Christ's
old claim to me: I thought I had forfeited all my rights, but the tempter was
too much upon my counsels and was still blowing the coal: Alas I knew not well
before how good skill my Intercessor and advocate, Christ, has of pleading,
and pardoning me such follies: Now he is returned to my soul with healing under
his wings, and I am nothing behind with Christ now, for he has overpaid me by
his presence, the pain I was put to by on-waiting, and any little loss I
sustained by my witnessing against the wrongs done to him. I trow it was a pain
to my Lord to hide himself any longer: In a manner he was challenging his
unkindness and repented him of his glooms, and now what want I on earth that
Christ can give to a poor prisoner? O how sweet and lovely is he now! Alas that
I can get none to help me to lift up my Lord Jesus upon his throne above all
the earth! 2. I am now brought to some measure of submission, and I resolve to
wait till I see what my Lord Jesus will do with me: I dare not now nick name
or speak one word against the all-seeing and over-watching providence of my
Lord: I see, providence runs not on broken wheels; but I like a fool carved
a providence for mine own ease, to die in my nest, and to sleep still till my
gray hairs, and to lie on the sunny side of the mountain in my ministry at
Anwoth: But now I have nothing to say against a borrowed fireside and another
man's house, nor Kedars tents where I live, being removed far from my
acquaintance, my lovers and my friends: I see God has the world on his wheels
and casts it as a potter does a vessel on the wheel: I dare not say that
there is any inordinat or irregular motion in Providence; The Lord has done
it, I will not go to law with Christ, for I would again nothing of that. 3. I
have learned some greater mortification and not to mourn after or seek to suck
the world's dry breasts: Nay, my Lord has filled me with such dainties, that I
am like to a full banquettor who is not for common cheer. What have I to do to
fall down upon my knees and worship mankind's great idol, The World? I have a
better God then any clay-God; Nay, at present as I am now disposed, I care not
much to give this world a discharge of my life-rent of it, for bread and water:
I know it is not my home, nor my father's house; it is but his footstool, the
outer clo^ster of his house, his out-field and moorground: Let bastards take
it, I hope never to think my self in it is common for honor or riches, nay now,
I say to laughter, Thou art madness. 4. I find it most true, that the greatest
temp^ (...) (...) (...) is to live without temptations if my waters should
stand, they would rot: Faith is the better of the free air, and of the sharp
winter-storm in it is face: Grace withers without adversity: The Devil is but
God's Masterfencer to teach us to handle our weapons. 5. I never knew how weak
I was till now, when he hides himself, and when I have him to seek seven times
a day. I am a dry and withered branch and a piece of a dead carcass, dry bones
and not able to step over a straw: The thoughts of my old sins are as the
summonds of death to me: And of late my Brother's case has stricken me to the
heart; when my wounds are closing, a little rifle, causes them to bleed
afresh: So thin-skin'd is my soul, that I think it is like a tender man's skin,
that may touch nothing: ye see how short I would shoot of the prize, if his
grace were not sufficient for me. Woe's me for the day of Scotland, Woe, woe is
me for my harlot-mother; for the decree is gone forth: women of this land shall
call the childless and miscarrying wombs blessed: The anger of the Lord is gone
forth and shall not return till he perform the purpose of his heart against
Scotland: Yet he shall make Scotland a new sharp instrument having teeth to
thresh the mountains and fan the hills as chaff. The prisoners blessing be upon
you.

MTSTRESS.
I Know ye are thinking sometimes what Christ is doing in Zion, and that the
haters of Zion may get the bottom of our cup and the burning coals of our
furnace, that we have been tried in these many years by gone. O that this
Nation would be awakened to cry mightily unto God, for the setting up of a new
^abernacle to Christ in Scotland. O if this Ki^gdom kne^ how worthy Christ were
of his room! His worth wa^ eve^ above man's ^stimation of him: And for my self
I a^ pained at the heart, that I cannot find my self disposed to leav^ myself
and go wholly in to Christ: Alas that there should b^ o^e bit o^ me out of
him, and that we leave too much liberty and latitude for our selves, and our
own ease, and credit, and pleasures; and so little room for All-love-worthy
Christ! O what pains and charges it costeth Christ ere he get us, and when all
is done we are not worth the having: It is a ^ond^r that he should seek the
like of us, but love overlooketh blacknes and ^ecklesness; for if it had not
been so, Christ would never have made so fair and blessed a bargain with us, as
the covenant of Grace is. I find that in all our sufferings, Christ is but
^iddi^g marches, that every one of us may say, Mine and T^ine, and that men may
know by their crosses, how weak a bottom nature is to stand under a trial; that
then, which our Lord intends in all our sufferings, is, to bring Gra^e in
^^uit and r^qu^st amongst us: I would succumb and ^^me sho^t of hea en, if I
had no more but my own strength to s^pport me, and if Christ should say to me,
Eit^^r do or die, it were easy to determine what should become of me, the
ch^ice were easy, for I b^hooved to die, if Christ should pass by wit^
strai^ned bowel* and who then would take us up in our str^its? I know we may
say that Christ is kindest in his love, when we are at our weakest, and that if
Christ had not been to the fore in our sad days, the waters had gone over our
soul: His mercy ha^h a ^et period and appointed place, how far and no further
the s^a of affliction shall flow, and where the waves thereof shall be st^yed;
he prescribes how much pain and sorrow both for weight and measure, we must
have: Ye have then good cause to r^call your love from all lovers and give it
to Christ: He who is afflicted in all your afflictions, looks not o^ you i^
your sad hours with an insensible heart or dry eyes: All the Lords saints may
see, that it is lost love which is bestowed upon this perishing world: death
and judgment will make men lament that ever their miscarrying heart* ^arryed
them to lay and lavish out their love upon false appearances right-dreams. Alas
that Christ should fare the worse, because o^ (...) own goodness, in making
peace and the gospel to ride together, and that w^ have never yet weighed the
worth of Christ in his ordinances, and that now we are like to be deprived of
the well, ere we have tasted the sweetness of the water: it may be with water^
eyes (...) a w^t face and wea^i^d feet, we seek Christ and shall not find^ him.
^h that this land were humbled in time, and by prayers, ^^ye and humiliation,
would bring Christ in at the churchdoor again, now, when his back is turned
toward us, and he is gone to the threshold and his one foot [as it wer^] is out
of the ^oor: I am sure his departure is our deserving, we have bought it with
our iniquities; for even the Lord's own children are fallen asleep: And alas
professors are made all of shows and fashions, and are not at pains to recover
themselves again: Every one has his set measure of faith and holiness, and
co^te^teth himself with a stinted measure of godliness, as if that were ^^ough
to bring them to heaven: We forget, that as our gifts and light grow, so God's
gain and the interest of his talents should grow also, and that we cannot pay
God with the old use and wont [as we use to speak] which we gave him seven
years ago; for this were to mock the Lord and to make price with him as we
list. O what difficulty is there in our christian journey, and how often come
we short of many thousand things that are Christ's due, and we consider not how
far our dear Lord is behind with us! Mistress, I cannot render you thanks as I
would for your kindness to my Brother, ^n oppr^ss^d stranger; but I remember
you unto the Lord as I am able: I entreat you think upon me his prisoner, and
pray that the Lord would be pleased to give me ^oom to speak to (...) people in
his name. Grace grace be with you.

To FULWOOD Younger. (195)
Much honored Sir
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Upon the report of this worthy bearer
concerning you, I thought good to spea^ a wo^d to you: It is enough for
acquaintance that we are one in Christ: My earnest desire to you is, that ye
would in the fear of God, compare your inch and hand-breadth of time with vaste
Eternity, and your thoughts of this now fair, blooming and green world, with
the thoughts ye shall have of it, when corruption and worms shall make their
houses in your eyeholes, and shall eat your flesh and make that body dry bones;
if ye do so, I know then, that your light of this world's vanity shall be more
clear then now it is: And I am persuaded ye shall then think, that men's labors
for this clay-idol are to be laughed at: Therefore come near and take a view of
that transparent beauty that is in Christ, which would busy the love of ten
thousand millions of world's and Angels, and hold them all at work: Surely I am
grieved that men will not spend their whole love upon that royal and princely
Welbeloved, that High and lofty One: For it is cursed love that runs another
way then upon him. And for my self, if I had ten loves and ten souls, O how
glad would I be if he would break in upon me and take possession of them all!
Woe, woe is me, that He and I are so far asunder! I hope we shall be in one
country and one house together: truly pain of love-sickness for Jesus, makes
me to think it long, long, long to the dawning of that day. Oh that he would
cut short years and months and hours, and overleap Time, that we might meet!
And for this truth, Sir, that ye profess, I avow before the world of men and
Angels, that it is the way and only way to our country, the rest are
by-ways; and that what I suffer for, is the apple of Christ's eye, even his
honor as Lawgiver and King of his Church. I think death too little ere I
forsook it. Do not, Sir, I beseech you in the Lord, make Christ's court
thinner by drawing back from him, it is ^oo thin already; for I dare pledge my
heaven upon it, he shall win this plea, and the fools that plea against him
shall lose the wager which is their part of salvation, except they take better
heed to their ways. Sir, free grace that we give no hire for, is a jewel our
Lord gives to few: Stand fast in the hope ye are called unto: Our Master will
rend the clouds and will be upon us quic^ly, and clear our cause, and bring us
all out in our black's and white's: Clean, clean garments in the Bridegroom's
eye, are of great worth: Step over this hand-breadth of world's glory, in to
our Lord's new world of grace, and ye will laugh at the feathers that children
are chasing in the air. I ve^^ly judge that this Inne^, men are building their
nest in, is not worth a drink of cold water. It is a rainny and smoky house,
b^st we come out of it, lest we be choked with the smoke thereof. O that my
adversaries knew how sweet my sighs for Christ are, and what it were for a
sinner to lay his head between Christ's breasts, and to be over head and ears
in Christ's love! Alas, I cannot cause paper speak the height and breadth and
depth of it! I have not a balance to weigh my Lord Jesus's worth, heaven, ten
heavens would not be the beam of a balance, to weigh him in. I must give over
praising of him, Angels see but little of him: O if that fair one, would take
off the mask off his fair face, that I might see him* a kiss of him through his
mask is half a heaven. O day, dawn! O time, run fast! O Bridegroom, post, post
fast that we may meet! O hea vens, cleave in two, that, that bright face and
head may set it self through the clouds! O that the corn were ripe and this
world prepared for his hook! Sir, be pleased to remember a prisoner's bonds.
Grace be with you.

Aberd. July. 10. 1637, Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To Mr HUGH MC KAILL. (196)
My very dear Brother.
YE know, that men may take their sweet fill of the sour Law in Grace's ground
and betwixt the Mediator's breasts, and this is sinners safest way; for there
is a bed for wearied sinners to rest them in, in the new Covenant, though no
bed of Christ's making to sleep in: The Law shall never be my doomster by
Christ's grace, if I get no more good of it: I shall find a sore enough doom
in the Gospel to humble and to cast me down: It is [I grant] a good rough
friend to follow a traitor to the bar and to back him till he come to Christ:
We may blame our selves who cause the Law to crave well paid debt, to scar us
away from Jesus and dispute about a righteousness of our own, a world in the
moon, a chim^rd, and a night-dream, that pride is Father and mother to: There
cannot be a more humble soul then a believer, it is no pride for a drowning man
to catch hold of a rock. I rejoice that the wheels of this confused world, are
rolled and cogged and driven according as our Lord will: Out of whatever ai^th
the wind blow, it will blow us on our Lord: No wind can blow our sails
overboard; because Christ's skill, and the honor of his wisdom are empawned
and laid down at the stake for the sea-passengers, that he shall put them safe
off his hand on the shore, in his father's known bounds, our native homeground.
My dear Brother, scar not at the cross of Christ: It is not seen yet, what
Christ will do for you, when it comes to the worst: He will keep his grace
till ye be at a strait, and then bring forth the decreed birth for your
salvation: Ye are an arrow of his own making, let him shoot you against a wall
of brass, your point shall keep whole. I cannot for multitude of letters and
distractions of friends prepare what I would for the times: I have not one hour
of spare time, suppose the day were forty hours long. Remember me in prayer:
Grace be with you.

Aberd. Sept. 5. 1637. Your in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R,

To his Reverend and Dear Brother Mr DAVID DICKSON. (197)
My Reverend and Dear Brother.
I Fear ye have never known me well: If ye saw my innerside, it is possible ye
would pity me, but ye would hardly give me either love or respect: Men mistake
me the whole length of the heavens: My sins prevail over me and the terrors of
their guiltiness: I am put often to ask, if Christ and I did ever shake hands
together in earnest, I mean not that my feast-dayes are quite gone; but I am
made of extremities: I pray God ye never have the woeful and driery experience
of a closed mouth; for then ye shall judge the sparrows that may sing in the
Church of Irwin, blessed birds: But my soul has been refreshed and watered,
when I hear of your courage and zeal for your never-enough-praised, praised
Master, in that ye put the men of God, chased out of Ireland, to work: O if I
could confirm you! I dare say in God's presence, That this shall never hasten
your suffering, but shall be David Dickson's feast and speaking joy, that while
he had time and leisure, he put many to work, to lift up Jesus, his sweet
Master, high in the skies. O man of God, go on, go on, be valiant for that
plant of renown, for that chief among ten thousands, for that Prince of the
Kings of the earth: It is but little that I know of God, yet this I dare write,
Christ shall be glorified in David Dickson, howbeit Scotland be not gathered: I
am pained, pained, that I have not more to give my sweet bridegroom: His
comforts to me are not dealt with a niggard's hand, but I would fain learn not
to idolize comfort, sense, joy, and sweet felt-presence: All these are but
creatures, and nothing but the kingly robe, the Gold-ring and the Bracelets of
the Bridegroom: The Bridegroom himself is better then all the ornaments that
are about him. Now, I would not so much have these, as God him s^l^, and to be
swallowed up of love to Christ: I see in delighting in a communion with Christ,
we may make more Gods then one^, but however, all was but bai^ns-play between
Christ and me till now: If one would have sworn unto me, I would not have
believed, what may be found in Christ: I hope ye pity my pain that much in my
prison, as to help me your self, and to cause others help me a Dyvour, a
sinful wretched Die your to pay some of my debts of praise to my great King:
Let my God be judge and witness, if my soul would not have sweet ease and
comfort, to have many hearts confirmed in Christ, and enlarged with his love,
and many tongues set on work to set on high my Royal and princely welbeloved. O
that my sufferings could pay tribute to such a King! I have given over
wondering at his love: for Christ has manifested a piece of art upon me, that
I never revealed to any living: He has gotten fair and rich employment, and
sweet sale, and a goodly market for his honorable calling of showing mercy, on
me the chief of sinners: Every one knows not so well as I do, my woefully
oftenbroken covenants: My sins against light working in the very act of
sinning, has been met with admirable mercy: But Alas! He will get nothing back
again but wretched unthankfulness! I am sure, if Christ pity any thing in me,
next to my sin, it is pain of love for an armfull and soul-full of himself, in
faith, love and begun fruition: My sorrow is, that I cannot get Christ lifted
off the dust in Scotland, and set on high above all the skies and heaven of
heavens.

Aberd. May. 1. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To His Reverend and dear Brother Mr JOHN LIVINGSTONE. (198)
My Reverend and dear Brother
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I long to hear from you, and to be refreshed
with the comforts of the bride of our Lord Jesus in Ireland: I suffer with you
in grief, for the dash that your desires to be at N. E: have received of late:
But if our Lord, who has skill to bring up his children, had not seen it your
best, it should not have befallen you: Hold your peace and stay your selves
upon the holy one of Israel: hearken what he says in crossing of your desires,
he will speak peace to his people. I am here removed from my flock, and
silenced and confined in Aberden, for the testimony of Jesus: And I have been
confined in spirit also with desertions and challenges: I gave in a bill of
quarrels and complaints of unkindness against Christ, who seemed to cast me
over the dike of the vineyard as a dry tree, and separated me from the Lord's
inheritance: But high, high and loud praises be to our royal crowned King in
Zion, that he has not burnt the dry branch: I shall yet live and see his
glory. Your Mother Church for her whoredom is like to be cast off: The bairns
may break their heart to see such chiding betwixt the husband and the wife. Our
Clergy is upon a Reconciliation with the Lutherians, and the Doctors are
writing books, and drawing up a Common Confession at the Councel's command: Our
Service Book is proclaimed with sound of trumpet: The night is fallen down upon
the P'rophets: Scotland's day of visitation is come: It is time for the bride
to weep, while Christ is a saying, He will choose another wife: But our sky
will clear again: The dry branch of cut-down Lebanon will bud again and be
glorious, and they shall yet plant vines upon our mountains. Now, My dear
Brother, I write to you for this end, that ye may help me to praise, and seek
help of others with you that God may be glorified in my bonds. My Lord, Jesus
has taken the withered dry stranger and his broken-in-heart prisoner, in to
his house of wine: O! O, If ye and all Scotland, and all our brethren with you,
knew how I am feasted! Christ's hon^combs drop comforts: He dineth with his
prisoner, and the King's spikenard casts a smell: The Devil cannot get it
denied, but we suffer for the apple of Christ's eye, his royal prerogatives as
King and Lawgiver: Let us not fear or faint, He will have his Gospel once
again rouped in Scotland, and have the matter going to voices, to see who will
say, let Christ be crowned King in Scotland: It is true, Antichrist stirs
his tail, but I love a rumbling and raging Devil in the kirk [^nc^ the Church
militant cannot, or may not want a Devil to trouble her] rather then a subtle
or sleeping Devil: Christ never yet go^ a bride without stroke of sword: It is
now nigh the bridegroom's entering in to his chamber, let us awake and go in
with him: I bear your name to Christ's door: I pray you, Dear Brother, forget
me not: Let me hear from you by Letter, and I charge you, smother not Christ's
bounty toward me: I write what I have found of him in the house of my
pilgrimage. Remember my love to all our brethren and sisters there. The keeper
of the vineyard watch for his besieged city and for you.

To Mr EPHRAIM MELVIN. (199)
Reverend and dear Brother.
I Received your letter and am contented with all my heart that our
acquaintance in our Lord continue. I am wrestling as I dow, up the mount with
Christ's cross: My second is kind and able to help. As for your questions,
because of my manifold distractions, and letters to multitudes, I have not time
to answer them: What shall be said in common for that, shall be imparted to
you; for I am upon these questions: therefore spare me a little; for the
Service Book would take a great time^ but I think, Sicut deosculatio religio sa
imaginis aut etiam el^mentorum, est in se idololatria externa, etsi intentio
deosculandi tota quanta in actu est, feratur in Deum (...), it a geniculatio
coram pane, quando nempe ex instituto totus homo externus and internus ver sar^
debeat circa elementaria signa, est adoratio relativa, and adoration sius
panis. Ratio: Intentio adorandi objectum materiale, non est de essentia
externae adorationis, ut pate^ i^ deosculatione religio sa. Sic geniculatio
coram imagine Babylonica, est externa adoratio imaginis, etsitr^s pueri mente
intendissent adorare Iehovam. Sic qui ex metu solo, aut spe pretij aut inanis
gloria, geniculatur coram aureo vitulo Ieroboami (quod ab ipso rege, qui nulla
religione induct^s, sed libidine domin^ndi tantum, vitulumerexit, factitatum
esse, textus satis luculenter clamat) adorat vitulum externa adoratione, esto
quod putaret vitulum esse meram creaturam, and honor nullo dignum: quia
geniculatio, sive nos nolum^s sive volumus, ex instituto Dei and naturae, in
actu religioso, est symbolum religiosae adorationis: Ergo sicut panis signat
corpus Christi etsi absit actus omnis nostrae intentionis, sic religiosae
geniculatio sublata omni intention humana, est externae adoratio paniscoram
quo adoramus, ut coram signo vicario and repraesentativo Dei: Thus recommending
you to God's tender mercy, I desire that ye would remember me to God:
sanctification shall settle you most in the truth. Grace be with you.

To a Gentle woman upon the death of her husband. [200]
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I cannot but rejoice, and withal be grieved
at your case: It has pleased the Lord to remove your husband, [my friend, and
this Kirk's faithful professor] soon to his rest; but shall we be sorry, that
our loss is his gain, seeing his Lord would want his company no longer; think
not much of short summonds, for seeing he walked with his Lord in his life and
desired that Christ should be magnified in him at his death, ye ought to be
silent and satisfied: When Christ comes for his own, he runs fast; mercy,
mercy to the saints goes not at leisure; love, love in our Redeemer is not
slow, and withal he is homely with you, who comes at his own hand to your
house and intrometeth as a friend with any thing that is yours: I think he
would fain borrow and lend with you. Now he shall meet with the solacious
company, the fair flock and blessed bairn-time of the firstborn, banqueting
at the marriage-supper of the Lamb. It is mercy that the poor wand. i^g sheep
get a dike-fide in this storn i^ day, and a lecking ship a safe harbrie, and a
sea-sick passenger a sound and soft bed a shore. Wrath, wrath, wrath from the
Lord i^ coming upon this land that he has left behind him: know therefore
that your Lord Jesus his wounds, are the wounds of a lover, and that he will
have compassion upon a sad hearted servant and that Christ has said, he will
have the husband's room in your heart, he loved you in your first husband's
time, and he is but wooeing you still, give him heart and chair, house and all;
he will not be made companion with any other, love is full of Jealousies, he
will have all your love, and who should get it but He? I know ye allow it upon
him, there are comforts both sweet and satisfying, laid up for you, wait on,
first Christ, he is an honest debtor. Now for mine own case, I think some poor
body would be glad of a dated prisoner's leavings, I have no scarcity of
Christ's love, he has wasted more comforts upon his poor banished servant, then
would have refreshed many souls: my burden was once so heavy that one cunce
weight would have casten the balance and broken my back, but Christ said,
hold, hold to my sorrow, and has wiped a bluchered face, which was foul with
weeping. I may joyfully go^ my Lord's errands with wages in my hands; deferred
hopes need not to make me dead swier [as we use to say] my cross is both my
cross and my reward, Oh that men would sound his high praises! I love Christ's
worst reproaches, his glooms, his cross, better then all this world's
plastered glory, my heart is not longing to be back again from Christ's
country, it' a sweet soil I a^ come to I, [if any in the world] have good
cause to speak much good of him. O Hell were a good cheap price to buy him a^!
Oh if all the three Kingdoms were witnesses to ^y pained, pained soul, overcome
and wounded with Christ's love! I thank you most kindly, my dear Sister, for
your love and render care to my brother, I will think my self obliged to you if
ye continue his friend, he is more to me then a brother now, being engaged to
suffer for so honorable a master and cause. pray for Christ's prisoner, and
Grace, grace be with you.

To His reverend and dear Brother Mr JOHN NEVAY. (201)
My reverend and dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have exceeding many ^w^ite to, else I
would be kinder in paper. I rejoice that my sweet Master has any to oack him:
Thick, thick may my royal Kings Court be: O that his Kingdom, might grow! It
were my joy to have his house full of guests. Except that I have some cloudy
days for the most part I have a King's life with Christ, he is all perfumed
with the powders of the merchant, he has a King's face and a King'^ smell, his
chariot wherein be carries his poor prisoneri of the wood of Lebanon, it is
paved with love, is not that soft ground to walk or lie on? I think better of
Christ then ever I did, my thoughts of his love grow and swell on me, I never
write to any of him so much as I have felt. Oh if If could write a book of
Christ and of his love! Suppose I were made white ashes and burnt for this same
truth that men count but as knots of straws, it were my gain, if my ashes could
proclaim the worth, excellency and love of my Lord Jesus: There is much telling
in Christ, I give over the weighing of him, Heaven would not be the beam of a
balance to weigh him in. What eyes be on me, or what wind of tongues be on me,
I care not: Let me stand in this stage in the fools coat and act a fools part
to the rest of this nation: If I can set my welbeloved on high and witness fair
for him, a fig for their Hosanna: If I can roll my self in a lap of Christ's
garment, I will ^e there and laugh at the thoughts of dying bits of clay.
Brother, we have cause to weep for our harlot-mother, her husband is sending
her to Rome's brothell-house, which is the gate she likes well: Yet I persuade
you, there shall be a fair after-growth for Christ in Scotland, and this Church
shall sing the Bridegroom's welcome-home again to his own house: The worms
shall eat them first ere they cause Christ take goodnight at Scotland. I am
here assaulted with the Doctors gun, but I bless the father of lights they draw
not blood of truth. I find no lodging in the heart of natural men, who are
cold friends to my Master: I pray you, Remember my love to that Gentleman A. C.
My heart is knit to him, because he and I have one Master. Remember my bands,
and present my service to my Lord and my Lady: I wish Christ may be dearer to
them, then to many of their place. Grace be with you.

Aberd. July. 5. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To my Lady BOYD. [202.]
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Few [I beleeve] kn^w the pain and torment of
Christ's fristed love, fristing of Christ's presence is a matter of torment. I
know a poor soul that would lay all oars in the water for a banquet or feast
o^^ Christ's love. I cannot think but it must be uptaking and sweet to see the
white and red of Christ's fair face; for he is white and ruddy and the chiefest
among ten thousands. Cant, 5, 10. I am sure that must be a well made face of
his, heaven must be in his visage; glory, glory for evermore must ^it on his
countenance. I dare not curse the mask and covering that is on his face, but O
if there were a hole in it! O if God would tear the mask! Fie, fie upon us, we
were never shamed till now^ that we do not proclaim our pining and languishing
for him. I am sure, nev^r tongue spoke of Christ as he is: I am still of that
mind and still will be, that we wrong and undervalue that holy, holy One in
having such short and shallow thoughts of his weight and worth. O if I could
have but leave to stand beside and see the Father weigh Christ the Son, if it
were possible! But how every one of them comprehends another, we who have
eyes of clay cannot comprehend: But it is pity for evermore and more then
shame, that such an one as Christ, should sit in heaven his alone for us: To
go up thither one's errand and on purpose to see, were no small glory. O that
he would strike out windows and fair and great lights in this old house, this
fallen down soul, and then set the soul near hand Christ, that the rays and
beams of light and th soul-delighting glances of the fair, fair Godhead, might
shine in at the windows and fill the house! A fairer and more near and direct
sight of Christ would make room for his love, for we are but pinched and
straightened in his love: Alas it were easy to measure and weigh all the love that
we have for Christ by inches and ounces! Alas that we should love by measure
and weight, and not rather have floods and feasts of Christ's love! Oh that
Christ would break down the old narrow vessels of these narrow and ebb souls;
and make fair, deep, wide and broad souls, to hold a sea and a full tide
flowing over all it is banks, of Christ's love! Oh that the Almighty would give
me my request! That I might see Christ come to his temple again [as he is
minting and it is like minding to doe] and if the land were humbled, the
judgments threatened are with this reservation I know, if we shall turn and
repent. O what heaven should we want on ear^h, to see Scotland's moon like the
light of the Sun and Scotland's sun-light seven fold like the light of seven
days, in the day that the Lord binds up the breach of his people and heals
the stroke of their wounds! Isa. 30: 26. Alas that we will not pull and draw
Christ to his old tents again, to come and feed among the lilies till the day
break and shadows flee away! O that the Nobl^s would go on in the strength and
courage of the Lord to bring our lawful King Jesus home again! I am persuaded
he shall return again in glory to this land, but happy ^ere they who could help
to convoy him to his sanctuary and set him again up upon the mercy-seat betwixt
the Cher^b^ms. O Sun return to darkened Britain! O fairest among all the sons of
men! O most excellent One, come home again, come home and win the praises and
blessings of the mourners in Zion, the prisoners of hope that wait for thee! I
know he can also triumph in suffering, and weep and reign, and die and triumph,
and remain in prison and yet subdue his enemies: But how happy were I to s^e
the coronation day of Christ, to see his mother who bare him put the crown upon
his head again, and cry with shouting till the earth should ring, Let Jesus our
King live and reign for evermore! Grace, grace be with your La.

Aberd. 1637. Your La: at all obedience in Christ, S. R.

To Mr ALEXANDER COLVILL. Of Blair. (203.)
Much honored Sir.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I would desire to know how my Lord took my
letter I sent him, and how he is: I desire nothing but that he be fast and
honest to my royal Master and King. I am well every way, all praise to him in
whose books I must stand for ever as his debtor: Only my silence paineth me: I
had one joy out of heaven next to Christ my Lord, and that was to preach him to
this faithless generation, and they have taken that from me: It was to me as
the poor man's one eye and they have put out that eye. I know the violence done
to me and his poor be-rest Bride, is come up before the Lord: and suppose I see
not the other side of my cross, or what my Lord will bring out of it; yet I
believe the vision shall not tarry, and that Christ is on his journey for my
deliverance, he goes not slowly but passes over ten mountains at one stride:
In the mean time, I am pained with his love, because I want real possession,
when Christ comes he stays not long, but certainly the blowing of his breath
upon a poor soul is heaven upon earth, and when the wind turns into the North
and he goes away, I die till the wind change in the West and he visit his
prisoner: But he holds me not often at his door. I am richly repayed for
suffering for him. O if all Scotland were as I am, except my bonds! O what pain
I have, because I cannot get him praised by my sufferings! O that heaven,
within and without, and the earth were paper, and all the rivers, fountains and
s^as were ink, and I able to write all the paper within and without, full of
his praises and love and excellency, to be read by man and Angel! Nay this is
little, I ow my heaven for Christ, and to desire, howbeit I should never enter
in at the gates of the new Jerusalem, to send my love and my praises over the
wall to Christ. Alas that Time and Days lie betwixt him and me, and adjourn our
meeting! It is my part to cry, O when will the night be past and the day dawn,
that we shall see one another! Be pleased to remember my service to my Lord to
whom I wrote, and show him, that for his affection to me, I cannot but pray for
him and earnestly desire that Christ miss him not out of the roll of these who
are his witnesses, now, when his kingly honor is called in question: It is his
honor to hold up Christ's royal train and to be an instrument to hold the
crown upon Christ's head: Show him, because I love his true honor and
standing, that this is my earnest desire for him. Now I bless you, and the
prayers of Christ's prisoner come upon you, and his sweetest presence whom ye
serve in the spirit accompany you.

Aberd. June. 23. 1637. Yours at all obliged obed^ince in Christ, S. R.

To Mr JOHN ROW. (204)
Reverend and dear Brother.
I Received yours: I bless his high and great name, I like my sweet Master
still the longer the better: A sight of his cross is more awsom then the weight
of it. I think the worst things of Christ, even his reproaches and his cross
[when I look on these not with bleared eyes] far rather to be chosen then, the
laughter and wormeaten joys of my adversaries. Oh that they were as I am,
except my bonds! My witness is above, my Ministry next to Christ is dearest to
me of any thing; but I lay it down at Christ's feet for his glory and his
honor as supreme Lawgiver, which is dearer to me. My dear Brother, if ye will
receive the testimony of a poor prisoner of Christ, who dare not now dissemble
for the world, I believe certainly and expect thanks from the Prince of the
Kings of the earth, for my poor hazards [such as they are] for his honorable
cause, whom I can ever enough extol for his running-over love to my sad soul,
since I came hither. O that I could get him set on high and praised! I seek no
more as the top and root of my desires, but that Christ may make glory to
himself and edification to the weaker out of my sufferings. I desire ye would
help me both to pray and praise, Grace be with you.

Aberd. July. 8. 1637. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the Lady CULROSS. (205)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am much refreshed with your letter, now at
length come to me. I find my Lord Jesus comes not in that precise way that I
lay wait for him, he has a gate of his own: O how high are his ways above my
ways! I see but little of him: It is best not to offer to learn him a lesson,
but to give him absolutely his own will in coming, going, ebbing, flowing and
in the manner of his gracious working. I want nothing but a back burden of
Christ's love: I would go through hell and the thick of the damned Devils to
have a hearty feast of Christ's love, for he has fettered me with his love,
and run away and left me a chained man. Woe is me that I was so loose, rash,
vain and graceless in my unbeleeving thoughts of Christ's love: But what can a
soul under a non-entry [when my rights were wod-set and lost] do else, but
make a false libel against Christ's love? I know your self, Madam, and many more
will be witnesses against me, if I repent not of my unbelief; for I have been
seeking the Pope's wares, some hire for grace within my self: I have not
learned as I should do, to put my stock and all my treasure in Christ's hand,
but I would have a stock of mine own, and ere I was aware, I was taking hire to
be the Law's advocate, to seek Justification by works: I forgot that grace is
the only garland that is worn in heaven upon the heads of the glorified. And
now I half rejoice that I have sickness for Christ to work upon: since I must
have wounds, well's my soul I have a day's work for my Physician Christ: I hope
to give Christ his own calling, it sets him full well to cure diseases. My
ebbings are very low and the tide is far out when my Beloved goes away; and
then I cry, Oh cruelty! to put out the poor man's one eye and that, that was my
joy next to Christ, to preach my welbeloved, then I make a noise about Christ's
house, looking uncouth-like in at his window and casting my love and my desires
over the wall, till God send better. I am often content my bill lie in heaven,
till the day of my departure, providing I had assurance that mercy shall be
written on the back of it: I would not care for on-waiting, but when I draw in
a tired arm and empty hand withal, it is much to me; to keep my thoughts in
order; but I will not get a gate for Christ's love: When I have done all I can
I would fain yield to his stream, and row with Christ and not against him. But
while I live, I see, that Christ's Kingdom in me will not be peaceable, so many
thoughts in me rise up against his honor and kingly power. Surely I have not
expressed all his sweet kindness to me, I spare to do it lest I ^e deemed to
seek my self; but his breath has sinelled of the powder of the merchants and
of the King's spikenard. I think I conceive new thoughts of heaven, because the
Card and the Map of Haven that he lets me now see, is so fair, and so
sweet: I am sure we are niggards and sparing bodies in seeking: I verily judge,
we know not how much may be had in this life, there is yet something beyond all
we see, that seeking would light upon. O that my lovesickness would put me to a
business, when all the world are sound sleeping, to cry and knock! But the
truth is, since I came hither, I have been wondering, that after my importunity
to have my fill of Christ's love, I have not gotten a real sign, but have come
from him crying, hunger, hunger. I think Christ lets me see meat in my
extremity of hunger, and gives me none of it: When I am near the apple he
draws back his hand and goes away, to cause me follow: And again when I am
within an arm-length to the apple he makes a now break to the gate, and I have
him to seek of new: He seems not to pity my dwining and my swooning for his
love. I dare sometimes put my hunger over to him to be judged, if I would not
buy him with a thousand years in the hottest furnace in hell, sobeing I might
enjoy him: But my hunger is fed with want and absence: I hunger and I have not,
but my comfort is to lie and wait on, and to put my poor soul and my sufferings
in Christ's hand: Let him make any thing out of me, sobeing he be glorified in
my salvation, for I know I am made for him: O that my Lord may win his own
gracious end in me! I will not be at ease, while I but stand so far aback: O if
I were near him and with him, that this poor soul might be satisfied with
himself! Your son in law W. G. is now truly honored for his Lord and Master's
cause: when the Lord is fanning Zion, it is a good token that he is a true
branch of the vine, that the Lord begins first to dress him: He is strong in
his ^^r^ as he has written to me, and his wife is his encourager, which should
make you rejoice. For your son, who is your grief, your Lord waited on you and
me till we were ^ipe and brought us in: It is your part to pray and wait upon
him; When he i^ ripe he will b^ spoken for, who can command our Lord's wind to
blow? I know it shall be your good in the latter end: That is one of your
waters to heaven, ye could not go about it, there are the fewer behind. I
remember you and him and yours, as I am able: But alas, I am believed to be
something, and I am nothing but an empty reed: Wants are my best riches,
because I have these supp^ed by Christ, Remember my dearest love to your
brother: I know he pleads with his harlot-mother for her Apostasy. I know
also ye are kind to my worthy Lady Kenmure. a woman beloved of the Lord, who
has been very mindful of my bonds: The Lord give her to find mercy and her
child in the day of Christ. Great men are dry and cold in doing for me, the
tinckling of chains for Christ, affrighteth them; but let my Lord break all my
idols, I will yet bless him. I am obliged to my Lord Lord: I wish him mercy.
Remember my bonds with praises, and pray for me that my Lord my leaven the
North by my bands and sufferings. Grace be with you.

Aberd. July 9. 1637, Yours ^his s swe Lord Jesus, S. R.

To ALEXANDER GORDON. Of Knockgray. (206.)
Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you. There is no question but our mother church
has a father and that she shall not die withont an heir, that her enemies*
hall not make mount Zion the^ heritage. We see, whethersoever Zion's enemies
go, suppose they dig many miles under the ground, yet our Lord finds them
out, and he has vengeances laid up in ^or^ for them, and the poor and needy
shall not always be forgotten. Our hope was drouping and withering, and man
was saying, what can God make out of the old dry bones of this buried Kirk? The
Prelates and their followers were a grave above us: it is like our Lord is to
open our graves and purposes to cause his two slain witnesses rise the third
day, O how long wait I to hear our weeping Lord Jesus sing again and triumph
and rejoice and divide the spoil! I find it hard work to believe when the
course of providence goes cross-wayes to our faith, and when misted souls in a
dark night cannot know East by West, and our sea Compass seems to fail us:
Every man is a believer in daylight: A fair day seems to be made all of
faith and hope: What a trial of gold is it to smoke it a little above the fire?
But to keep gold perfect ^ellow-coloured amidst the flames and to be turned
from vessel to vessels, and yet to cause out furnace sound and speak and cry
the praises of the Lord, is another matter. I know my Lord made me not for
fire, howb^it he has fitted me in some measure for the fire. I bless his high
name that I wax not pale, neither have I lost the color of gold and that his
fire has made me somewhat thin and that my Lord may pour me in any vessel he
pleases: For a small wager I may justly quite my part of this world's
laughter, and give up with time, and cast out with the pleasures of this world.
I know a man who wondered to see any in this life laugh and sport: surely our
Lord seeks this of us, as to any rejoicing in present perishing things. I see
above all things, and that we may sit down and fold legs and arms and stretch
our selves upon Christ and laugh at the feathers that children are chasing
here: For I think the men of this world like children in a dangerous storm in
the sea, that play and make sport with the white foam of the waves thereof,
coming in to sink and drown them; so are men making fool's sports with the
white pleasures of a stormy world that will sink ^em. But alas, what have we to
do with their sports that they make! If Solomon said of Laughter that it was
madness, what may we say of this world's laughing and sporting themselves with
gold and silver and honors and court and broad large conquests, but that they
are poor souls in the height and rage of a fever gone mad? Then a straw, a fig
for all created sports and rejoicing out of Christ: Nay I think that this world
at it is prime and perfection, when it is is come to the top of it is excellency
and to the bloom, might be bought with an half penny, and that it would scarce
weigh the worth of a drink of water: There is nothing better then to esteem it
our crucified idol, that is dead and slain, as Paul did; ^al. 6, 14. Then let
pleasures be crucified, and riches be crucified, and court and honor be
crucified, and since the Apostle faith, the world is crucified to him, we may
put this world to the hanged man's doom and to the gallows, and who will give
much for a hanged man? and as little should we give for a hanged and crucified
world: Yet what a sweet smell has this dead carrion to many fools in the
world, and how many wooers and suitors finds this hanged carrion? Fools are
pulling it off the gallows and contending for it. O when shall we learn to be
mortified men, and to have our fill of these things that have but their short
summer-quarter of this life! If we saw our father's house and that great and
fair city, the new Jerusalem which is up above sun and moon, we would cry to
be over the water and to be carried in Christ's arms out of this borrowed
prison. Grace, grace be with you.

To the ^aird of CARLETOUN. (207)
Worthy Six.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter and am heartily glad
that our Lord has begun to work for the apparent delivery of this poor
oppressed Kirk: O that salvation would come for Zion! I am for the present
hanging by hope, waiting what my Lord will do with me, and if it will please
my sweet Master to send me amongst you again, and keep out a hireling from my
poor people and flock: It were my heaven till I come home, even to spend this
li^e in gathering in some to Christ. I have still great heaviness for my
silence and my forced standing idle in the market, when this land has such a
plentiful thick harvest; but I know, his judgments who has done it, pass
fi^ding out: I have no nowledge to take up the Lord in all his strange ways
(...) p^ssages of deep and unsearchable providence, for the Lord is before me
and I am so be-misted that I cannot follow him: He is behind me and following
at the heels and I am not aware of him, he is above me, but his glory so (...)
my twilight of short knowledge* that I cannot look up to him: He is upon my
right hand, and I see him no: He is upon my left hand and within me and goes
and com^th, and his going and coming are a dr^a^ to me: He is round about me
and comp^th ^l my going^ and still I have him to eek: He is every way higher
and d^eper and broad^r then the shallow and ebb hand-breadth of my sho^t and
d^ light can take up, and therefore I would my heart could be silent and sit
down in the learnedly-ignorant wondering at that Lord, whom m n and Ang^ls
cannot comprehend. I know, the noon-day-light of the highest Angels, who see
him face to face, sees not the borders of his infiniteness: They apprehend God
near hand, but they cannot comprehend him: And therefore it is my happiness to
look afar off and to come near to the Lord's back parts, and to light my dark
candle at his brightness, and to have leave to sit and content my self with a
traveller's light, without the clear vision of an enjoyer. I would seek no more
till I were in my country, but a little watering and sprinkling of a withered
soul, with some half out breakings and half-outlookings of the beam and small
ravi^hing smiles of the fairest face of a revealed and believed on Godhead: A
little of God would make my soul bank-full. O that I had but Christ's odd off
fallings, that he would let but the meanest of his love-rayes and love-beams
fall from him, so, as I might gather and carry them with me! I would not be ill
to please with Christ and veiled visions of Christ, neither would I be dainty
in seeing and enjoying of him* A kiss of Christ blown over his shoulder, the
parings and crumbs of glory that fall under his table in heaven, a shower like
a thin May-mist of his love, would make me green and sappy and joyful, till
the summer-sun of an eternal glory break up. O that I had any thing of Christ!
O that I had a sip or half a drop out of the hollow of Christ's hand, of the
sweetness and excellency of that lovely One! O that my Lord Jesus would ^ue
upon me, and give me but the meanest alms of felt and believed salvation! O
how little were it for that infinite sea, that infinite fountain of love and
joy, to fill as many thousand thousand little vessels the like of me, as there
are minutes of hours since the creation of God! I find it true that a poor
soul finding half a smell of the Godhead of Christ, has desires paining and
wounding the poor heart so, with longings to be up at him, that make it
sometimes think, were it not better never to have felt any thing of Christ then
thus to lie dying twenty deaths under these felt wounds for the want of him? O
where is he! O fairest! Where dwell thou? O never enough admired Godhead!
how can clay win up to thee? How can creatures of yesterday be able to enjoy
thee? O what pain is it, that time and sin should be as so many thousand miles
betwixt a loved and longed-for Lord and a dwining and lovesick soul, who would
rather then all the world have lodging with Christ! O let this bit love of
ours, this inch and half span-length of heavenly longging, meet with thy
infinite love! O if the little I have were swallowed up with the infiniteness
of that excellency which is in Christ! O that we little ones were in at the
greatest Lord Jesus! our wants should soon be swallowed up with his fullness.
Grace, grace be with you.

To ROBERT GORDON. Of Knockbrex. (208)
Dear Brother.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I received your letter from Edinburgh. I
would not wish to see another heaven wh^^e I get mine own heaven, but a new
moon like the light of the sun, and a new sun like the light of seven days
shining upon my poor self and the Church of Jews and Gentiles, and upon my
withered and sunburned mother, the Church of Scotland, and upon her sister
Churches, England and Ireland; and to have this done to to the setting on high
our great King: it makes not, howbeit I were separate from Christ and had a
sense of ten thousand years pain in hell, if this were. O blessed Nobility, O
glorious renouned Gentry, O blessed were the tribes in this land to wipe my
Lord Jesus's weeping face, and to take the sackcloth off Christ's loins and to
put his kingly robes upon him! O if the Almighty would take no less wager of me
then my heaven, to have it done! But my fears are still for wrath once upon
Scotland: But I know her day shall clear up and glory shall be upon the top of
the mountains and joy at the noise of the married wife once again. O that our
Lord would make us to contend and plead and wrestle by prayers and tears for
our husband's restoring of his forfeited heritage in Scotland. Dear Brother, I
am for the present in no small battle betwixt felt guiltiness and pining
longings and high fevers for my welbeloved's love. Alas! I think Christ's love
plays the niggard to me, and I know, it is not for scarcity of love, there is
enough in him; but my hunger prophesies of in-holding and sparingness in
Christ, for I have but little of him and little of his sweetness: It is a dear
summer with me, yet there is such joy in the eagerness and working of hunger
for Christ, that I am often at this, that if I had no other heaven but a
continual hunger for Christ, such a heaven of ever-working hunger, were still
a heaven to me. I am sure, Christ's love cannot be cruel, it must be a rueing,
a pitiful, a melting-hearted love: But suspension of that love* I think it
half a hell, and the want of it more then a whole hell. When I look to my
guiltiness, I see my salvation one of our Savior's greatest miracles either in
heaven or earth: I am sure, I may defy any m^n to show me a greater wonder,
but seeing I have no wares, no hire, no money for Christ, he must either take
me with want, misery, corruption, or then want me. O if he would be pleased to
be compassionat and pitiful hearted to my pining fevers of longing for him, o^
then give me a real pawn to keep, out of his own hand, till God send a
meeting betwixt him and me! But I find neither as yet; howbeit he who is
absent be not cruel nor unkind, yet his absence is cruel and unkind: His love
is like it self, his love is his love; but the cove^ing and the cloud, the vail
and the mask of his love, is more wise then kind, if I durst speak my
apprehensions. I lead no process now against the suspension and delay of God's
love: I would with all my heart frist till a day, ten heavens and the sweet
manifestations of his love: Certainly I think I could give Christ much on his
word: But my whole pleading is about intimated and born-in assurance of his
love. O if he would persuade me of my heart's desire of his love at all, he
should have the term-day of payment at his own carving: But I know, raving
unbeleef speaks it is pleasure; while it looks upon guiltiness and this
body of corruption. O how loathsome and burdensome is it to carry about a dead
corpse, this old carrion of corruption! O how steadable a thing is a Savior to
make a sinner rid of his chains and fetters! I have now made a new question,
Whether Christ be more to be loved for giving Sanctification, or for free
Justification? And I hold he is more and most to be loved for S^n^tification:
it is in some respect greater love in him to sanctify then to justify, for he
makes us most like himself in his own essential pourtraiture and image, in
sanctifying us: Justification does but make us happy, which is to be like the
Angels only: Neither is it such a misery to lie a condemned man and under
unforgiven guiltiness, as to serve sin and work the works of the Devil; and
therefore I think Sanctification cannot be bought, it is above all price, God be
thanked for ever that Christ was a told down price for Sanctification: Let a
sinner [if possible] lie in hell for ever, if he make him truly holy, and let
him lie there burning in love to God, rejoicing in the Holy Ghost, hanging upon
Christ by faith and hope; that is heaven in the heart and bottom of hell. Alas,
I find a very thin harvest here and few to be saved! Grace, grace be with you.

Aberd. 1637. Yours in his lovely and longedfor Lord ^^sus, S. R.

To my Lord CRAIGHALL. (209)
My Lord.
I Persuade my self, notwithstanding of the greatness of this temptation, ye
will not let Christ want a witness of you, to avow him before this evil
generation. And if ye advise with God's truth, the perfect testament of Christ,
that forbids all men's additions to his worship, and with the truly learned
and withal the sanctified in this land, and with that warner within you [that
will not fail to speak against you in God's time, if ye be not now fast and
fixed for Christ] I hope then your Lo: will acquit your self as a man of
courage for Christ, and refuse to bow your knee superstitiously and
idolatrously to wood or stone or any creature whatsoever. I persuade my self
when ye shall take goodnight at this world, ye shall think it God's truth I
now write. Some fear your Lo: have obliged your self to his Maj: by promise to
satisfy his desire: If it be so, my dear and worthy Lord, hear me for your
soul's good: Think upon swimming a shore after this ship wrack, and be pleased
to write your humble Apology to his Majesty, it may be God give you favor in
his eyes: However it be, far be it from you to think, a promise made out of
weakness and extorted by the terror of a King, should bind you to wrong your
Lord Jesus. But for my self, I give no faith to that report, but I believe ye
shall prove fast (...) Christ: To his grace I recommend you.

Aberd. July. 8. 1637. Your Lo: at all obedience in Christ. S. R.

To my Lord CRAIGHALL. (210.)
My Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I am not only content but I exceedingly
rejoice, that I find any of the Rulers of this Land, and especially your Lo:
so to affect Christ and his truth, as ye dare for his name come to yea and nay
with Monarchs in their face. I hope he who has enabled you for that, will give
more, if ye show your self courageous, and as his word speaks, a man in the
streets for the Lord: But I pray your Lo: give me leave to be plain with you,
as one who loves both your honor and your soul. I verily believe, there was
never Idolatry at Rome, never Idolatry condemned in God's word by the Prophets,
if religious kneeling before a consecrate creature standing in room of Christ
crucified, in that very act, and that for reverence of the Elements (as our Act
clears) be not Idolatry. Neither will your intention help, which is not of
the essence of Worship: for then Aaron saying, To morrow shall be afeast for
Jehovah, that is, for the golden Calf, should not have been guilty of Idolatry;
for he intended only to decline the lash of the people's fury, not to honor
the Calf: Your intention to honor Christ is nothing, seeing religious kneeling
by God's institution does necessarily import religious and divine adoration,
suppose our intention were both dead and sleeping: Otherwise kneeling before
the Image of God, directing prayer to God, were lawful, if our intention go
right. My Lord, I cannot in this bounds dispute, but if Cambridge and Oxford
and the learning of Britain will answer this argument, and the argument from
active scandal, which your Lo: seems to stand upon, I will turn a formalist
and call my self an arrant fool by doing what I have done in my suffering for
this truth. I do much reverence Mr Ls. learning, but my Lo: I will answer what
he writes in that to pervert you from the truth, else repute me beside an
hypocrite, an ass also, and I hope ye shall see something upon that subject, if
the Lord permit, that no sophistry in Britain shall answer. Courtiers arguments
for the most part, are drawn from their own skin, and are not worth a straw for
your conscience. A Marquess or a King's word, when ye stand before Christ's
tribunal, shall be lighter then wind. The Lord knows I love your true honor
and the standing of your house, but I would not your honor or house were
established upon sand, and hay and stubble. But let me, my very dear and worthy
Lord, most humbly beseech you by the mercies of God, by the consolations of his
Spirit, by the dear blood and wounds of your lovely Redeemer, by the salvation
of your soul, by your compearance before the awful face of a sin-revenging and
dreadful Judge, not to set in comparison together your soul's peace, Christ's
love and his Kingly honor now called in question, with your place, honor,
house, or ease, that an inch of time will make out of the way. I verily
believe, Christ is now begging a testimony of you, and is saying, And will ye
also leave me. It is possible the wind shall not blow so fair for you all your
life, for coming out and appearing before others to back and countenance Christ
the fairest among the sons of men, the Prince of the Kings of the earth. Isa.
51. 7. Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be afraid of their revilings.
v. 8. For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm shall eat
them like wool. When the Lord shall begin, he shall make an end, and mow down
his adversaries, and they shall lie before him like withered hay, and their
bloom shaken off them. Consider how many thousands in this Kingdom veshall
cause to fall and stumble, if ye go with them, and that ye shall be out of the
prayers of many who do stand before the Lord for you and your house: and
further, when the time of your accounts comes, and your one foot shall be
within the border of eternity, and the eye-strings shall break, and the face
wax pale, and the soul shall look out at the windows of the house of clay,
longing to be out, and ye shall find your self arraigned before the Judge of
quick and dead to answer for the putting to your hand with the rest,
confederate against Christ, to the overturning of his Ark and the loosing of
the pins of Christ's tabernacle in this land, and shall certainly s^e your self
mired in a course of Apostasy, then, then a King's favor and your worm-eaten
honor shall be miserable comforters to you. The Lord has enlightened you with
the knowledge of his will: and as the Lord lives, they lead you and others to
a communion with great Babel, the mother of fornications: and God said of old,
and continues to say the same to you, Come out of her my people, lest ye be
partakers of her plagues: will ye then go with them, and set your lip to the
whore's golden cup, and drink of the wine of the wrath of God Almighty with
them? O poor hungry honor! O cursed pleasures! And O damnable ease, bought
with the loss of God! How many shall pray for you! What a sweet presence shall
^efinde of Christ under your sufferings, if ye shall lay down your honor and
place at the feet of Christ! What a fair recompense of reward! I avouch before
the Lord that I am now showing you a way how the house of Craighall may stand
on sure pillars: If ye will set it on rotten pillars, ye cruelly wrong your
posterity: Ye have the word of a King for an hundred fold more in this life [if
it be good for you] and for life everlasting also: Make not Christ a liar, in
distrusting his promise. Kings of clay cannot back you when ye stand before
him, a straw for them and their hungry heaven that stands on this side of
time, a fig for the dayes-smile of a wo^m. Consider who have gone before you to
eternity and would have given a world for a new occasion of a vouching that
truth: It Is true, they call it not substantial, and we are made a scorn to
these that are at ease, for suffering these things for it; but it is not time
to judge of our losses by the morning, stay till the evening and we shall count
with the best of them. I have found by experience since the time of my
imprisonment [my witness is above] Christ fealing this honorable cause with
another and a nearer fellowship then ever I knew before, and let God weigh me
in an even balance in this, if I would exchange the cross of Christ or his
truth with the fourteen Prelacies or what else a King can give. My dear Lord,
venture to take the wind on your face for Christ: I believe, if he should come
from heaven in his own person, and seek the charters of Craighall from you, and
a dimission of your place, and ye saw his face, ye would fall down at his feet
and say, Lord Jesus, it is too little for ^ee. If any man think it not a truth
to die for, I am against him: I dare go to eternity with it, that this day the
honor of our royal Lawgiver and King in the Government of his own free
Kingdom [who should pay tribute to no dying King] is the true state of the
question. My Lord, be ye upon Christ's side of it, and take the word of a poor
prisoner, nay the Lord Jesus be surety for it; ye have incomparably made the
wisest choice: for my own part, I have been in this prison that I would be half
a hamed to seek more, till I be up at the wellhead. Few know in this world the
sweetness of Christ's breath, the excellency of his love which has neither
brim nor bottom: the world has raised a slander upon the cross of Christ,
because they love to go to heaven by dry land and love not sea-storms: But I
write it under my hand [and would say more, if possibly a reader would not deem
it hypocrisie] My obligation to Christ for the smell of his garments, for his
lovekisses these thirty weeks, stands so great, that I should, and I desire
also to choose to suspend my salvation, to have many tongues loosed in my behalf
to praise him: and suppose in person I never entered within the gates of the
new ^erusalem, yet sobeing Christ may be set on high and I had the liberty to
cast my love and praises for ever over the wall to Christ, I would be silent
and content. But O he is more then my narrow praises! O time, time, flee
swiftly, that our communion with Jesus may be perfected. I wish your Lo: would
urge Mr L. to give his mind in the Ceremonies and be pleased to let me s^e it
as quickly as can be, and it shall be answered. To his rich grace I recommend
your Lo: and shall remain.

Aberd. Juny 8. 1637. Yours at all respective obedience in Christ, S. R.

To the Lady CULROSS. (211)
MADAM.
YOur letter came in due time to me, now a prisoner of Christ and in bonds for
the Gospel: I am sentenced with deprivation, and confinement within the town of
Aberdeen: but Oh my guiltiness, the follies of my youth, the neglects in my
calling, and especially in not speaking more for the Kingdom, crown and scepter
of my royal and princely King Jesus, do so stare me in the face, that I
apprehend anger in that which is a crown of rejoicing to the dear saints of
God! This before my compearance [which was three several dayes] did trouble me,
and burdeneth me more now; howbeit Christ, and in him, God reconciled, met me
with open arms, and trysted me precisely at the entry of the door of the
Chancellour's hall, and assisted me to answer so, as the advantage that is, is
not their's but Christ's. Alas! There is no cause of wondering that I am thus
born down with challenges, for the world has mistaken me, and no man knows
what guiltiness is in me, so well as these two [who keep my eyes now waking and
my heart heavie] I mean, my Heart and Conscience, and my Lord who is greater
then my Heart. Show your brother that I desire him while he is on the
watchtower to plead with his mother, and to plead with thi^land, and spare not
to cry for my sweet Lord Jesus his fair crown, that the interdited and
forbidden Lords are plucking off his royal head. If I were free of challenges
and a High Commission within my soul. I would not give a straw to go to my
father's house through ten deaths for the truth and cause of my lovely, lovely
one* Jesus: But I walk in heaviness now. If ye love me and Christ in me, my
dear Lady, pray, pray for this only, that by-gones betwixt my Lord and me may
be by-gones, and that he would pass from the summonds of his High Commission,
and seek nothing from me, but what he will do for me and work in me. If your
La: knew me as I do my self, ve would say, Poor soul, no marvel. It is not my
apprehension that creates this cross to me, it is too real and has sad and
certain grounds. But I will not believe that God will take this advantage of
me, when my back is at the wall: He who forbids to add affliction to
affliction, will he do it himself? Why should ^e pursue a dry lea^ and
stubble? Desire him to spare me now. Also the memory of the fair feast-dayes
that Christ and I had in his banqueting house of wine, and the scattered flock
once committed to me and now taken off my hand by himself, because I was not so
faithful in the end, as I was in the first two years of my entry, when sleep
departed from my eyes, because my soul was taken up with a care for Christ's
lambs, even these add sorrow to my sorrow. Now my Lord has only given me
this to say, and I write it under mine own hand [be ye the Lord's servant's
witness] Welcome, welcome, sweet, sweet cross of Christ: welcome fair. fair,
lovely, royal King with thine own cross: Let us all three go to heaven
together. Neither care I much to go from the South of Scotland to the North,
and to be Christ's prisoner amongst (...) couth faces, a place of this Kingdom
which I have little reason to be in love with. I know, Christ shall make
Ab^rdeen my garden of delights. I am fully persuaded that Scotland shall ^at
Ez^kiel's book that is written within and without; Lamen^ and mourni^g and ^oe.
Ezekiel. 2, 10. But the saints shall get a drink of the well that goes through
the streets of the n^w Jerusalem to put it down. Thus hoping ye will think upon
the poor prisoner of Christ, I pray, Grace, grace be with you.

Edinb. July. 30. 1636. Your La: in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. (...).

To ALEXANDER GORDON. of Earlestovvn. (212)
Much honored Sir.
I Find small hopes of Qs. business: I intend after the Councel-day to go on
to Aberdeen: The Lord is with me, I care not what man can do. I burden no man,
and I want nothing: No King is better provided then I am: Sweet, sweet and
easy is the cross of my Lord: All men I look in the face [of whatsoever rank,
Nobles and poor, acquaintance and strangers] are friendly to me. My welbeloved
is some kinder and more warmly then ordinary, and comes and visits my soul:
My chains are overguilded with gold. Only the remembrance of my fair days
with Christ in Anwoth, and of my dear flo^^ [whose case is my heart's sorrow]
is vinegar to my sugared wine, yet both sweet and sour feed my soul: No pen,
no words, no ingine can express to you, the loveliness of my only, only Lord
Jesus. Thus in haste, making for my palace at Aberdeen, I bless you, your wife,
your eldest son and other children. Grace, grace be with you.

Edinb. Sept. 5. 1636. Your in his only, only Lord Jesus. S. R.

To ROBERT GORDON of Knockbrex. (213.)
My dearest Brother.
I See Christ thinks shame [if I may speak so] to be in such a poor man's
common as mine. I burden no man, I want nothing, no face has gloomed upon me
since I left you. God's son and fair weather conveyeth me to my time- Paradise
in Aberdeen. Christ has so handsomely fitted for my shoulders this ^^ugh ^^ee
of the cross, as that it hurts me no ways. My treasure is up in Christ's
^^ffers, my comforts are greater then ye can believe: my per shall ye for
p^^ury of words to write of them. God knows* I am filled with the joy of the
Holy Ghost. Only the memory of you, my dearest in the Lord, my flock and
others* keeps me under, and from being exalted above measure: Christ's sweet
sa^ has this sour mixed with it; but O such a sweet and pleasant taste! I
find small hopes of Qs: matter. Thus in haste. Remember me to your wife, and
to William Gordon. Grace be with you.

Edinb. Sept. 5. 1636. Yours in his only, only Lord Jesus, R. S.

To my Lord LOWDOUN. (214)
Right honorable and my very worthy Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Hearing of your Lo: zeal and courage for
Christ our Lord, in owning his honorable cause, I am bold [and I plead pardon
sor it] to speak in paper by a line or two to your Lo: [since I have not access
any other way] beseeching your Lo: by the mercies of God, and by the
everlasting peace of your soul, and by the tears and prayers of our
Mother Church, to go on as ye have worthily begun, in purging of the Lord's
house in this land and plucking down the sticks of Antichrist's filthy nest,
this wretched Prelacy, and that black Kingdom, whose wicked aims have ever been
and still are, to make this fat world the only Compass they would have Christ
and Religion to sail by, and to mount up the man of sin, their godfather the
Pope of Rome, upon the highest stair of Christ's throne, and to make a
velvet-Church [in regard of Parliament-grandour and wordly pomp, whereof
always their stinking breath smelleth] and to put Christ and truth in
sackcloth and prison, and to eat the bread of adversity and drink the water
of affliction: Half an eye of any not misted with the darkness of Antichristian
smoke, may see it thus in this land: and now our Lord has begun to awaken the
Nobles and others to plead for born-down Christ and his weeping Gospel: My dear
and noble Lord, the eye of Christ is upon you; the eyes of many noble, many
holy, many learned and worthy ones in our neighbor Churches about are upon
you: This poor Church, your mother and Christ's spouse, is holding up her hands
and heart to God for you, and does beseech you with tears to plead for her
husband, his Kingly Scepter, and for the liberties that her Lord and King has
given to her, as to a free Kingdom, that owes spiritual tribute to none on
earth, as being the freeborn Princess and daughter to the King of Kings. This
is a Cause that before God, his Angels, the World, before Sun and Moon, needs
not to blush. O what glory and true honor is it to lend Christ your hand and
service, and to be amongst the repairers of the breaches of Sion's walls, and
to help to ^uild the old waste places, and stretch forth the curtains and
strengthen the stakes of Christ's tent in this land! O blessed are they, who,
when Christ is driven away, will bring him back again and lend him lodging! And
blessed are ye of the Lord; your name and honor shall never rot or wither in
heaven [at least] if ye deliver the Lord's sheep that have been scattered in
the dark and cloudy day, out of the hands of strange Lords and hirelings, who
with rigor and cruelty, have caused them to eat the pastures trodden upon with
their foul feet, and to drink muddy water, and who have spun out such a world
of yards of ^ndifferencies in God's Worship, to make and weave a web for the
Antichrist [that shall not keep any from the cold] as they mind nothing else,
but that by the bringing in of the Pope's foul tail first upon us [their
wretched and beggarly Ceremonies] they may thrust in after them, the
Antichrist's legs and thighs and his belly, head and shoulders, and then cry
down Christ and the Gospel and up the merchandise and wares of the great whore.
Fear not, my worthy Lord, to give your self and all ye have, out for Christ and
his Gospel: No man dare say who ever did thus hazard for Christ, that Christ
paid him not his hundred fold in this life duly, and in the life to come,
life everlasting. This is his own truth ye now plead for, for God and man
cannot but commend you to beg justice from a just Prince for oppressed Christ,
and to plead that Christ, who is the King's Lord, may be heard in a free court
to speak for himself, when the standing and established laws of our nation can
strongly plead for Christ's crown in the pulpits, and his chair as Lawgiver in
the free Government of his own house: But Christ shall never be content and
pleased with this land, neither shall his hot fiery indignation be turned away,
so long as the Prelate, [the man that l^y in Antichrist's foul womb and the
Antichrist's Lord Bailiffe] shall sit Lord-carver in the Lord Jesus his courts:
The Prelate is both the egg and the nest to cleck and bring forth Popery:
Plead therefore in Christ's behalf for the plucking down of the nest and
crushing of the egg, and let Christ's Kingly Office suffer no more unworthy
indignities. Be valiant for your royal King Jesus, contend for him; your
adversaries shall be moth-eaten worms, and shall die as men: Christ and his
honor now lies upon your shoulders, let him not fall to the ground: Cast your
eye upon him who is quickly coming to decide all the controversies in Zion, and
remember the sand in your night-glass will run out: Time with wings will fly
away, Eternity, is hard upon you, and what will Christ's lovesmiles and the
light of his lovely and soul delighting countenance be to you in that day, when
God shall take up in his right hand this little lodge of heaven [like as a
shepherd lifts up his little tent] and sold together the two leaves of his
tent, and put the earth and all the plenishing of it into a fire, and turn this
clay-Idol, the god of Adam's sons, in to smoke and white ashes! O what hire and
how many worlds would many then give to have a favorable decree of the Judge!
Or what moneys would they not give to buy a mountain to be a grave above both
soul and body, to hide them from the awsom looks of an angry Lord and Judge! I
hope, your Lo: thinks upon this, and that ye mind loyalty to Christ and to
the King both. Now the very God of peace, the only wise God, establish and
strengthen you upon the rock laid in Zion.

Aberd. Jan. 4. 1638. Your Lo: at all obedience in Christ, S. R.

To a Christian Gentlewoman. (2^5)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Though not acquainted, yet at the desire of
a Christian brother, I thought good to write a line unto you, entreating you in
the Lord Jesus under your trials, to keep an ear open to Christ, who can speak
for himself, howbeit your visitations and your own sense should dream hard
things of his love and favor: Our Lord never gets so kind a look of us,
nor our love in such a degree, nor our faith in such a measure of stedfastness,
as he gets out of the furnace of our tempting fears and sharp trials. I
verily believe [and too sad proofs in me, say no less] that if our Lord would
grind our whorish lust in powder, the very old ashes of our corruption should
take life again, and live and hold us under so much bondage that may humble us
and make us sad, till we be in that country where we shall need no Physic at
all. O what violent means does our Lord use to gain us to him, as if indeed we
were a prize worthy his fighting for! And be sure if leading would do the
turn, he would not use pulling of hair and drawing: But the best of us will
bide a strong pull of our Lord's right arm ere we follow him: Yet I say not
this as if our Lord always measured afflictions by so many ounce weights
answerable to the grain weights of our guiltiness: I know he does in many [and
possibly in you] seek nothing so much as faith that can endure summer and
winter in their extremity. O how precious to the Lord is faith and love, that
when threshed, beaten, and chased away, and boasted [as it were] by God
himself, does yet look warm-like, love-like, kindlike, and life-like home-over
to Christ, and would be in at him, ill and well as it may be! Think not much
that your husband or the dearest to you in the world, proves to have the
bowels and mercy of the Ostrich, hard and rigourous and cruel: For Psalm. 27.
10. The Lord takes up such fallen ones as these. I could not wish a more sweet
life nor more satisfying expressions of kindness till I be up at that Prince of
kindness, then the Lord's saints find when the Lord takes up men's refuse and
lodges this world's out-lawes whom no man seeks after: His breath is never
so hot, his love casts never such a flame, as when this world and these who
should be the helpers of our joy, cast water on our coal: It is a sweet thing
to see them cast out, and God take in, and to see them throw us away as the
refuse of men, and God take us up as his jewels and his treasure: Often he
makes gold of dross, as once he made the castaway stone, the stone rejected
by the builders, the head of the corner. The Princes of this world would not
have our Lord Jesus a pinning in the wall or to have any place in the building,
but the Lord made him the Master-stone of power and place. God be thanked that
this world has not power to cry us down so many pounds, as rulers cry down
light gold, or light silver: We shall stand for as much as our master-coiner
Christ, whose coin, arms and stamp we bear, will have us: Christ has no
miscarrying balance. Thank your Lord, who chaseth your love through two
Kingdoms and follows you and it over sea, to have you for himself, as he
speaks Hos. 3. For God lays up his saints as the wail and the choice of
all the world for himself, and this is like Christ and his love. O what in
heaven or out of heaven is comparable to the smell of Christ's garments! Nay,
suppose our Lord would manifest his art, and make ten thousand heavens of good
and glorious things, and of new joys devised out of the deep of infinite
wisdom, he could not make the like of Christ, for Christ is God, and God cannot
be made: and therefore let us hold us with Christ, howbeit we might have our
wail and will of an host of lovers, as many as three heavens could contain. O
that he and we were together! O when Christ and ye shall meet about the outmost
march and borders of time and the entry into eternity, ye shall see heaven in
his face at the first look, and salvation and glory sitting in his countenance
and betwixt his eyes! Faint not, the miles to heaven are but few and short: he
is making a green bed [as the word speaks Cant. 1.] of love for himself and
you: There are many heads lying in Christ's bosom, but there is room for yours
among the rest: And therefore go on and let hope go before you: Sin not in
your trials, and the victory is yours: pray, wrestle and believe, and ye shall
overcome and prevail with God as Jacob did: No windle-straws, no bits of clay,
no temptations which are of no longer life then an hour, will then be able to
withstand you, when once ye have prevailed with God. Help me with your prayers,
that it would please the Lord to give me house-room again, to speak of his
righteonsness in the great congregation, if it may seem good in his sight.
Grace, grace be with you.

THE SECOND PART.
Containing Some letters of the same Author, from Anwoth, before his
confinement, at Aberdeen: And others from St Andrevvs, London, etc. after his
enlargement.
To the Vicountess of Kenmure. (1.)
MADAM..
ALL dutiful obedience in the Lord remembered: I have heard of your La:
Infirmity and sickness with grief yet I trust ye have learned to say. It is the
Lord, let him do whatsoever seems good in his eyes. It is now many years
since the Apostate Angels made a question, whether their will or the will of
their Creator should be done, and since that time, fr^ward mankind has
always in that same suit of Law compeared, to plead with them against God, in
a daily repining against his will: but the Lord being both party and Judge,
has obtained a decree and says, Isa. 46. 10. My counsel shall stand, and I
will do all my pleasure. It is then best for us in the obedience of faith and
in an holy submission, to give that to God which the Law of ^is almighty and
just power will have of us. Therefore, Madam, your Lord wills you in all
states of life to say Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven: and herein
shall ye have comfort, that he who sees perfectly through all your evils, and
knows the frame and constitution of your nature, and what is most healthful
for your soul, holds every cup of affliction to your head with his own
gracious hand: Never believe that your tenderhearted Savior who knows the
strength of your stomach, will mix that cup with one dram weight of poison:
Drink then with the patience of the saints, and the God of patience bless your
Physic. I have heard your La: complain of deadness and want of the bestirring
power of the life of God, but courage, he who walked in the garden and made a
noise that made Adam hear his voice, will also at sometimes walk in your soul
and make you hear a more sweet word: Yet ye will not always hear the no^se and
the din of his feet when he walks: Ye are at such a time like Jacob mourning
at the supposed death of Joseph, when Joseph was living: The new creature, the
image of the second Adam is living in you, and yet ye are mourning at the
supposed death of the life of Christ in you: Ephraim is bemoaning and mourning,
Ier. 31. 18. When he thinks God is far off and hears not, and yet God is
like the Bridegroom, Cant. 2. standing only behind a thin wall and laying to
his ear, for he says himself, ver 18. I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning
himself. I have good confidence, Madam, that Christ Jesus whom your soul
through forests and mountains is seeking, is within you: And yet I speak not
this to lay a pillow under your head, or to dissuade you from an holy fear of
the loss of your Christ or of provoking and stirring up the beloved before he
please, by sin. I know, in spiritual confidence the Devil will come in, as in
all other good works, and cry half mine, and so endeavor to bring you under a
fearful sleep, till he whom your soul loves be departed from the door and
have left off knocking and therefore, here the Spirit of God must hold your
souls feet in the golden mid-line betwixt confident resting in the arms of
Christ, and presumptuous and drousie sleeping in the bed of fleshly security.
Therefore, worthy Lady, so count little of your self, because of your own
wretchedness and sinful drousiness, that ye count not also little of God in
the course of his unchangeable mercy: For there be many Christians, most like
unto young sailers, who think the shore and the whole land does move, when the
ship and they themselves are moved; just so, not a few do imagine that God
moves and saileth and changes places, because their giddy souls are under
sail and subject to alteration, to ebbing and flowing; but the foundation of
the Lord abides sure. God knows that ye are his own: Wrestle, fight, go
forward, watch, fear, believe, pray, and then ye have all the infallible
symptoms of one of the elect of Christ within you. Ye have now, Madam, a
sickness before you and also after that a death, gather then now food for the
journey: God give you eyes to see through sickness and death, and to see
something beyond death. I doubt not but if hell were betwixt you and Christ, as
a river which ye behooved to cross ere ye could come at him, but ye would
willingly put in your foot and make through to be at him, upon hope that he
would come in himself in the deepest of the river and lend you his hand. Now I
believe your hell is dried up and ye have only these two shallow brooks,
Sickness and Death, to pass through, and ye have also a promise that Christ
shall do more then meet you, even that he shall come himself and go with you
foot for foot, yea and bear you in his arms. O then! O then for the joy that is
set before you! For the love of the man [who is also God over all, blessed for
ever] that is standing upon the shore to welcome you, run your race with
patience: The Lord go with you. Your Lord will not have you nor any of his
servants to exchange for the worse. Death in it self includes both the death
of the soul and the death of the body, but to God's children the bounds and the
limits of death are abridged and drawn into a more narrow compass: So that when
ye die, a piece of death shall only seize upon you, or the least part of you
shall die, and that is the dissolution of the body; for in Christ ye are
delivered from the second death: and therefore, as one born of God commit not
sin [although ye cannot live and not sin] and that serpent shall but eat your
earthly part? As for your soul, it is above the law of Death: But it is
fearful and dangerous to be a debtor and servant to sin, for the count of sin
ye will not be able to make good before God, except Christ both count and pay
for you. I trust also, Madam, that ye will be careful to present to the Lord
the present estate of this decaying Kirk: For, what shall be concluded in
Parliament anent her, the Lord knows: sure I am, the decree of a most
fearful Parliament in heaven, is at the very point of coming forth, because of
the sins of the land: For, We have cast away the law of the Lord and despised
the words of the holy one of Israel, Isa. 5, 24. Judgment is turned away
backward and justice stands afar off, truth is fallen in the stre^ts and
equity cannot enter. Lo, the prophet, as if he had seen us and our Kirk,
resembles justice to be handled as an enemy holden out at the ports of our
city, so is she banished: and Truth to a person sickly and diseased, fallen
down in a deadly swooning sit in the streets before he can come to an house:
Isa. 59. 14. The Priests have caused many to stumble at the Law, and have
corrupted the Covenant of Levi: Mal. 2. 8. But what will they do in the end?
Ier. 5 31. Therefore give the Lord no rest for Zion. Stir up your husband, your
brother, and all with whom ye are in favor and credit, to stand upon the
Lord's side against Baal. I have good hope your husband loves the peace and
prosperity of Zion: The peace of God be upon him for his intended courses anent
the establishment of a powerful Ministry in this land. Thus not willing to
weary your La: further, I recommend you now, and always, to the grace and
mercy of that God who is able to keep you that ye fall not. The Lord Jesus be
with your spirit.

Anwoth. July. 27. 1628. Your La: servant at all dutiful obedience in Christ,
S. R.

To the Parishoners of KILMACOLME. (2)
Worthy and welbeloved in Christ Jesus our Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Your letters could not come to my hand in a
greater throng of business then I am now pressed with at this time, when our
Kirk requires the public help of us all; yet I cannot but answer the heads of
both your letters, with provision that ye choose after this, a fitter time for
writing. 1. I would not have you pitch upon me as the man able by lettters to
answer doubts of this kind, while there are in your bounds, men of such great
parts, most able for this work: I know the best are unable, yet it pleases
that Spirit of Jesus to blow his sweet wind through a pi^ce dry stick, that the
empty reed may keep no glory to it self; but a Minister can make no such wind
as this to blow, he is scarce able to lend it a passage to blow through him. 2.
Know that the wind of this Spirit has a time when it blows sharp and
pierces so strongly that it would blow through an iron door, and this is
commonly rather under suffering for Christ then at any other time: Sick
children get of Christ's pleasant things to play them withal, because Jesus is
most tender of the sufferer, for he was a sufferer himself. O if I had but the
leavings and the drawing of the byboard of a sufferer's table! But I leave this
to answer yours.

First, ye write that God's vows are lying on you, and security strong and ^^b
to nature, stealing on you who are weak. I answer, 1. Till we be in heaven the
best have heavy heads, as is evident Cant. 5. 1. Psalm. 30. 6. Job. 29. 18.
Matthew. 26. 33. Nature is a sluggard and loves not the labor of religion:
Therefore rest should not be taken till we know the disease be over and in the
way of turning, and that it is like a fever past the cool: And the quietness
and the calms of the faith of victory over corruption, would be entertained in
place of security, so that if I sleep, I would desire to sleep faith's sleep in
Christ's bosom. 2. Know also, none that sleep sound can seriously complain of
sleepiness, sorrow for a slumbering soul, is a token of some watchfulness of
spirit: But this is soon turned into wantonness, [as grace in us too often is
abused] therefore our waking must be watched over, else sleep will even grow
out of watching, and there is as much need to watch over grace, as to watch
over sin: full men will soon sleep and sooner then hungry men. 3. For your
weakness to keep off security, that like a thief steals upon you, I would say
two things. 1. To want complaints of weakness, is for heaven and Angels that
never sinned, not for Christians in Christ's camp on earth: I think our
weakness makes us the Church of the redeemed ones and Christ's field that the
Mediator should labor in: If there were no diseases on earth, there needed no
Physicians on earth: If Christ had cried down weakness, he might have cried
down his own calling; but weakness is our Mediator's world, Sin is Christ's
only, only fa e and market; no man should rejoice at weakness and diseases,
but I think we may have a sort of gladness at boils and sores, because without
them, Christ's fingers as a slain Lord should never have touched our skin. I
dare not thank my self, but I dare thank God's depth of wise Providence, that I
have an errand in me, while I live, for Christ to come and visit me and bring
with him his drugs and his balm. O how sweet is it, for a sinner to put his
weakness in Christ's strengthening hand and to father a sick soul upon such a
Physician and to lay weakness before him, to weep upon him and to plead and
pray! weakness can speak and cry when we have not a tongue. Ezekiel 16. 6. And
when I passed by thee and saw thee polluted in thine own blood, I said unto
thee when thou wast in thy blood, Live. The Kirk could not speak one word to
Christ then, but blood and guiltiness out of measure, spoke, and drew out of
Christ pity and a word of life and love. 2. For weakness, we have it, that we
may employ Christ's strength because of our weakness: Weakness is to make us
the strongest things, that is, when having no strength of our own, we are
carried upon Christ's shoulders and walk [as it were] upon his legs: If our
sinful weakness swell up to the clouds, Christ's strength will swell up to the
sun and far above the heaven of heavens. 2. Ye tell me that there is need of
counsel for strengthening of new beginners, I can say little to that, who am not
well begun my self; but I know, honest beginnings are nouri head by him, even by
lovely Jesus, who never yet put out a poor man's dim candle, who is wrestling
betwixt light and darkness. I am sure if new beginners would urge themselves
upon Christ, and press their souls upon him and importune him for a draught of
his sweet love, they could not come wrong to Christ: Come once in upon the
right nick and step of his lovely love, and I defy you to get free of him
again: If any beginners fall off Christ again and miss him, they never lighted
upon Christ as Christ; it was but an idol, like Jesus, they took for him. 3.
Whereas ye complain of a dead Ministry in your bounds, ve are to remember that
the Bible among you, is the contract of Marriage, and the manner of Christ's
conveying his love to your heart, is not so absolutely dependent upon, even
lively preaching, as that there is no conversion at all, no life of God, but
that, that is tied to a m^n's lips: The daughters of Jerusalem have done often
that, which the watchmen could not do: Make Christ your Minister, he can woo
a soul at a dikefide in the field, he needs not us, howbeit the flock be
obliged to seek him in the shepherds tents: Hunger of Christ's making may
thrive, even under stewards who mind not the feeding of the flock, O blessed
soul, that can leap over a man and look above a pulpit up to Christ, who can
preach home to the heart, howbeit we were all dead and rotten! 4. So to
complain of your self as to justify God is right, and providing ye justify
his Spirit in your self; for men seldom advocate against Satan's work and sin
in themselves, but against Gods work in themselves: some of the people of God
slander God's grace in their souls as some wretches use to do, who complain
and murmr of want, I have nothing [say they] all is gone, the ground yields
but weeds and windlestraws; when as their fa^ harvest, and their money on bank
makes them liars. But for my self, alas! I think it is not my sin, I have
scarce wit to sin this fin: But I advise you to speak good of Christ, for his
beauty and sweetness, and speak good of him for his grace to your selves. 5.
Light remains, ye say, but ye cannot attain to painfulness: See if this
complaint be not booked in the new Testament, and the place Romans 7 18. Is like
this, To will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I know
not. But every one has not Paul's spirit in complaining: For osten in us,
complaining is but an humble back biting and traducing of Christ's new work in
the soul. But for the matter of the complaint I would say: The light of glory
is perfectly obeyed in loving and praising and rejoicing and resting in a seen
and known Lord; but that light is not hereaway in any clay body, for while we
are here, light i^ in the most part broader and longer then our narrow and
feckless obedience: But if there be light with a fair train and a great back, I
mean, armies of challenging thoughts and sorrow for coming short of performance
in what we know and see ought to be performed, then that sorrow for not doing
is accepted of our Lord for doing: Our honest sorrow and sincere aims,
together with Christ's intercession pleading that God would welcome that which
we have and forgive what we have not, must be our life, till we be over the
bound-road and in the other country, where the law will get a perfect soul. 6.
In Christ's absence there is [as ye write] a willingness to use means, but
heaviness after the use of them, because of formal and slight performance. In
Christ's absence I confess the work lies behind, but if ye mean absence of
comfort and absence of sense of his sweet presence, I think that absence is
Christ's trying of us, not simply our sin against him: Therefore howbeit our
Obedience then, be not sugared and sweetened with joy [which is the sweet meat
bairns would still be at] yet the less sense and the more willingness in
obeying, the less formality in our obedience, howbeit we ^^in^ not so; for I
believe many think obedience formal and lif les, except the wind be fair in the
West, and sails filled with joy and sense, till souls like a ship fair before
the wind can spread no more sail; but I am not of their mind who think so. But
if ye mean by absence of Christ, the withdrawing of his working grace, I see
not how willingness to use means can be at all under such an absence: Therefore
be humbled for heaviness in that obedience, and thankful for willingness: for
the Bridegroom is busking his Spouse often times while she is half sleeping,
and your Lord is working and helping more then ye see. Also I recommend to you
Heaviness for formality and lifeless deadness in obedience: Be casten down as
much as ye will or can, for deadness, and challenge that slow and dull carcass
of sin that will neither lead nor drive in your spiritual obedience. O how
sweet to lovely Jesus are bills and grievances given in against corruption and
the body of fin! I would have Christ, in such a case, fashed [if I may speak
so] and deaved with our cries, as ye see the Apostle does, Romans 7, 24. O
wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death!
Protestations against the law of sin in you, are law-grounds why sin can have
no law against you: Seek to have your Protestation discussed and judged, and
then shall ye find Christ on your side of it. 7. Ye hold that Christ must
either have hearty service or no service at all: If ye mean he will not half a
heart or have fained service, such as the hypocrites give him, I grant you
that: Christ must have honesty or nothing: But if ye mean, he will have no
service at all where the heart draws aback in any measure, I would not that
were true, for my part of heaven and all that I am worth in the world: If ye
mind to walk to heaven without a cramp or a crook, I fear ye must go your
alone: He knows our dross and defects, and sweet Jesus pitieth us when
weakness and deadness in our obedience is our cross and not our darling. 8. The
liar [as ye write] challenges the work as formal, yet ye bless your cautioner
for the groundwork he has laid and dare not say but ye have assurance in some
measure. To this I say. 1. It shall be no fault to say Satan's labor, and
challenge it your self, or at least examine and censure; but beware of Satan's
ends in challenging, for he minds to put Christ and you at odds. 2. Welcome
home faith in Jesus, who washes still when we have defiled our souls and made
our selves loathsome, and seek still the blood of atonement to faults little or
meekle: Know the gate to the well and lie about it. 3. Make meekle of
assurance, for it keeps your anchor fixed. 9. Out-breakings [ye say]
discourage you, so that ye know not if ever ye shall win again to such
overjoying consolations of the Spirit in this life, as formerly ye had, and
therefore a question may be, If after assurance and mortification, the children
of God be ordinarily fed with sense and joy? I answer, I see no inconvenience to
think, it is enough in a race, to see the gold at the starting place; howbeit
the runners never get a view of it till they come to the rink's end, and that
our wise Lord thinks it fittest we should not always be singering and
playing with Christ's apples. Our Welbeloved, I know, will sport and play with
his Bride, as much as he thinks will allure her to the rink's end: Yet I
judge it not unlawful to seek renewed consolations, providing first, the heart
be submissive and content, to leave the measure and t^ing of them to him. 2.
providing they be sought to excite us to praise, and strengthen our assurance,
and sharpen our desires after himself. 3. Let them be sought not for our humors
or swelling of nature; but as the earnest of heaven: and I think many do
attain to greater consolations after mortification then ever they had formerly:
But I know, our Lord walks here, still by a sovereign latitude, and keeps
not the same way as to one hair-breadth without a miss, toward all his
children. As for the Lord's people with you, I am not the man fit to speak to
them. I rejoice exceedingly that Christ is engaging souls amongst you: But I
know in conversion all the winning is in the first buying [as we use to say]
for many lay false and bastard foundations, and take up conversion at their
foot, and get Christ for as good as half nothing, and had never a sick night
for sin, and this makes loosework: I pray you dig deep, Christ's Palace-work,
and his n^w dwelling laid upon hell felt and feared, is most firm: And heaven
grounded and laid upon such a hell, is surest work and will not wash away with
winter-storms. It were good that Professors were not like young heirs that
come to their rich estate long ere they come to their wit, and so is seen on
it: the tavern and the cards and the harlots, steal their ridges from them ere
ever they be aware what they are doing. I know, a Christ bought with strokes is
sweetest. 2. I recommend to you conference and Prayer at Private Meetings, for
warrant whereof see Isa. 2, 3. Ier. 50, 4, 5. Hos. 2, 1 2. Ezech. 8, 20, 21,
22, 23. Mal. 3, 16. Luke 24, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. Ioh. 20, 19. Act. 12. 12. Col.
3, 16. and 4. 6. Ephesians. 4, 29. 1 Pet. 4, 10. 1 Thessalonians. 5, 14. Heb. 3, 13, and 10,
25. Many coals make a good fire, and this is a part of the communion of saints.
I must entreat you and your Christian acquaintances in the Parish to remember
me to God in your prayers, and my flock and ministry, and my transportation and
removal from this place, which I fear at this assembly: And be earnest with God
for our mother Kirk. For want of time I have put you all in one letter: The
rich grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

Anwoth August. 5. 1639. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus. S. R.

To a Christian Gentlewoman. (3)
MISTRESS.
MY love in Christ remembered to you: I was indeed sorrowful at my departure
from you, especially since ye were in such heaviness after your daughters
death; yet I do persuade my self, ye know, that the weightiest end of the
cross of Christ that is laid upon you, lies upon your strong Savior, for
Isaiah says 62. 9. In all your afflictions ^e is afflicted: O blessed second
who suffers with you! and glad may your soul be, even to walk in the fiery
furnace with one like unto the Son of man, who is also the Son of God. Courage,
up your heart, when ye do tire he will bear both you and your burden, Psalm.
^5. 22. Yet a little while and ye shall see the salvation of God. Remember of
what age your daughter was, as long was your lease of her: if she was 18, 19,
or 20 years old, I know not, sure I am, seeing her term was come and your
lease run out, ye can no more justly quarrel your great Superior for taking his
own at his just termeday, then a poor farmer can complain, that his Master
takes a portion of his own land to himself when his lease is expired. Good
Mistress, if ye would not be content that Christ would hold from you the
heavenly inheritance, which is made yours by his death, shall not that same
Christ think hardly of you, if ye refuse to give him your daughter willingly,
who is a part of his inheritance and conquest? I pray the Lord to give you all
your own, and to grace you with patience, to give God his also: he is an ill
debtor who pays that which he has borrowed, with a grudge: indeed that long
loan of such a good daughter, an heir of grace, a member of Christ [as I
beleeve] deserves more thanks at your Creditor's hand, then that ye should
gloom and murmr when he craveth but his own: I believe ye would judge them to
be but thankless neighbors, who would pay you a sum of money after this
manner. But what, do ye think her lost, when she is but sleeping in the bosom
of the Almighty? think her not absent who is in such a friend's house: Is she
lost to you who is found to Christ? If she were with a dear friend, although ye
should never see her again, your care for her would be but small: Oh now, is
she not with a dear friend, and gone higher upon a certain hope that ye shall
in the Resurrection see her again, when [be ye sure] she shall neither be
hectic nor consumed in body! Ye would be sorry either to be, or to be
esteeemed an Atheist, and yet not I, but the Apostle, 1 Thessalonians. 4^ 13. thinks
these to be hopeless Atheists who mourn excessively for the dead: but this is
not a challenge on my part, I do speak this only fearing your weakness; for
your daughter was a part of yourself, and therefore nature in you being as it
were cut and halved, will indeed be grieved, but ye have to rejoice that when a
part of you is on earth, a great part of you is glorified in heaven: Follow
her, but envy her not, for indeed it is self-love in us that makes us mourn
for them that die in the Lord: Why? because for them we cannot mourn, since
they are never happy till they be dead; therefore we mourn for our own private
respect: take heed then that in showing your affection in mourning for your
daughter, ye be not out of self-affection mourning for your self. Consider what
the Lord is doing in it, your daughter is plucked out of the fire and she
rests from her labors, and your Lord in that is trying you and casting you
in the fire: Go through all fires to your rest, and now remember that the eye
of God is upon you, beholding your patience and faith: he delights to see you
in the burning bush and not consumed, and he is gladly content that such a weak
woman as ye, should send Satan away frustrate of his design: Now honor God and
shame the strong roaring lion, when ye seem weakest: Should such a one as ye
faint in the day of adversity? Call to mind the days of old, the Lord yet
lives, trust in him although he should stay you: faith i^ exceeding charitable
and believes no evil of God. Now is the Lord laying in the one scale of the
balance your making conscience of submission to his gracious will, and in the
other your affection and love to your daughter, which of the two will ye then
choose to satisfy? Be wise then, and as I trust ye love Christ better then a
sinful woman, pass by your daughter and kiss the Lord's rod. Men do lop the
branches off their trees round about, to the end they may grow up high and
tall: The Lord has this way lopped your branch, in taking from you many
children, to the end ye should grow upward like one of the Lord's cedars,
setting your heart above where Christ is at the right hand of the father: what
is next, but that your Lord cut down the stock after he has cutted the
branches? Prepare your self, ye are nearer your daughter this day then ye were
yesterday, while ye prodigally spend time in mourning for her, ye are speedily
posting after her: Run your race with patience: let God have his own, and ask
of him in stead of your daughter which he has taken from you, the daughter of
faith, which is Patience, and in patience possess your soul. Lift up your head,
ye do not know how near your redemption does draw. Thus recommending you to
the Lord who is able to establish you, ^^^st.

Anwoth. April 23. 1628. Your loving and affects not f^ in the Lord Jesus S. R.

To the elect and noble Lady my Lady Kenmure. (4)
MADAM.
SAluting your La: with grace and mercy from God our father and from om Lord
Jesus Christ, I was sorry at my departure, leaving your La: in grief, and would
still be g^d at it, if I were not assured that ye have one with you in the
^urnace, (...) visage is like unto the Son of God: I am glad that ye have been
acquainted from your youth with the wrestlings of God, and that ye getscarce
liberty to swallow down your spittle, being casten from furnace to furnace,
knowing if ye were not dear to God, and if your health did not require so much
of him, he would not spend so much Physic upon you. All the brethren and
sisters of Christ must be conform to his image and copy in suffering. Rom, 8,
And some do more vively resemble the copy then others: Think Madam, that it is
a part of your glory to be enrolled among these, whom one of the Elders, Rev.
7, 14. points out to John, th^se are they which came out of great
tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of
the Lamb. Behold your forerunner going out of the world all in a lake of blood,
and it is not ill to die as he did: Fulfill with joy the remnant of the grounds
and remainders of the afflictions of Christ in your body. Ye have lost a
child: Nay: She is not lost to you, who is found to Christ, she is not sent
away, but only sent before, like unto a star, which going out of our sight
does not die and evanish, but shines in another hemisphere: ye see her not,
yet she does shine in another country: If her glass was but a short hour,
what she wants of time, that she has gotten of eternity: and ye have to
rejoice that ye have now some plenishing up in heaven: Build your nest upon no
tree here, for ye see God has sold the forest to death, and every tree
whereupon we would rest, is ready to be cut down, to the end we may flee and
mount up and build upon the rock and dwell in the holes of the rock. What ye
love besides Jesus your husband, is an adulterous lover: Now it is God's
special blessing to Judah that he will not let her find her paths in following
her strange lovers, Hos. 2, 6. Therefore behold, I will hedge up her way with
thorns, and make a wall, that she shall not find her paths, v. 7. And she
shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not overtake them. O thrice happy
Judah, when God builds a double stone-wall betwixt her and the fire of hell!
The World and the things of the World, Madam, is the lover ye naturally affect
beside your own husband, Christ: The hedge of thorns and the wall which God
builds in your way, to hinder you from this lover, is the thorny hedge of
daily grief, loss of children, weakness of body, iniquity of the time,
uncertainty of estate, lack of worldly comfort, fear of God's anger for old
unrepented of sins: What lose ye, if God twist and ^let the hedge daily
thicker? God be blessed, the Lord will not let you find your paths: Return to
your first husband: Do not weary, neither think that Death walks toward you
with a slow pace, ye must be riper ere ye be shaken: your daves are no longer
then Job's, that were swifter then a post and passed away as the ships of
desire and as the Eagle that hastes for the prey, Job. 9: 25, 26. There is
less sand in your glass now, then there was yesternight, this span-length of
ever-posting time, will soon be ended: But the greater is the mercy of God, the
more years ye get to advise upon what terms and upon what conditions ye cast
your soul in the huge gulf of never-ending Eternity: The Lord has told you
what ye should be doing till he come, wait and hasten [saith Peter] for the
coming of our Lord: All is night that is here, in respect of ignorance and
daily ensuing troubles, one always making way to another, as the ninth wave of
the sea to the tenth; therefore sigh and long for the dawning of that morning,
and the breaking of that day of the coming of the So^ of man, when the shadows
shall flee away: Persuade your self, the King is coming: read his letter sent
before him, Rev. 3. 11. Behold, I come quickly: Wait with the wearied
night-watch for the breaking of the eastern sky, and think that ye have not a
morrow: As the wise father said, who being invited against to morrow to dine
with his friends, answered, These many days I have had no morrow at all. I am
loath to weary you: Show your self a Christian by suffering without murmuring,
for which sin fourteen thousand and seven hundred were slain, Numb. 16. 49. In
patience possess your soul, they lose nothing who gain Christ. Thus remembering
my brother's and my wife's humble service to your La: I commend you to the
mercy and grace of our Lord Jesus, assuring you, that your day is coming and
that God's mercy is abiding you. The Lord Jesus be with your spirit.

Anwoth. Jan. 15. 1629. Yours in the Lord Jesus at all dutiful obedience, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (5.)
MADAM..
SAluting you in Jesus Christ, to my grief I must bid you [(...) may be] for
ever farewell in paper, having small assurance (...). to see your face again,
till the last general Assembly, where the whole church universal shall meet:
Yet promising by his grace to present your La: and your burdens to him who is
able to save you and give you an inheritance with the saints, after a more
special manner then ever I have done before. Ye are going to a country where
the Sun of righteousness in the Gospel shines not so clearly as in this
Kingdom; but if ye would know where he whom your soul loves does rest and
where he feeds at the noontide of the day, where ever ye be, get you forth
by the footsteps of the stock and feed your self beside the shepherds tents.
Cant. 1, 7. that is, ask for some of the watchmen of the Lord's city, who will
tell you truly, and will not lie, where ye shall find him whom your soul
loves. I trust ye are so betrothed in marriage to the true Christ, that ye
will not give your love to any false Christ: Ye know not how soon your
marriage-day will come, nay, is not Eternity hard upon you? It were time then
that ye had your wedding garment in readiness, be not sleeping at your Lord's
coming: I pray God, ye may be upon your feet standing when he knocks. Be not
discouraged to go from this country to another part of the Lord's earth, the
earth is his and the fullness thereof, Psalm. 24, 1. This is the Lord's lower
house, while we are lodged here we have no assurance to lie ever in one
chamber, but must be content to remove from one corner of our Lord's
nether-house to another, resting in hope, that when we come up to the Lord's
upper city, Jerusalem that is above, we shall remove no more; because then we
shall be at home. And go wheresoever ye will, if your Lord go with you, ye
are at home, and your lodging is ever taken before night, so long as he who is
Israel's dwelling house is your home, Psalm. 90, 1. Believe me Madam, my mind
is that ye are well lodged and that in your house there are fair ease-rooms and
pleasant lights, if ye can in faith lean down your head upon the breast of
Jesus Christ, and till this be, ye shall never get a sound sleep: Jesus, Jesus
be your shadow and your covering: It is a sweet soul-sleep to lie in the arms
of Christ, for his breath is very sweet. Pray for poor friendless Zion; Alas!
No man will speak for her now, although at home in her own country she has
good friends, her husband Christ, and his father, her father in law: Beseech
your husband to be a friend to Zion and pray for her. I have received many and
diverse dashes and heavy strokes since the Lord called me to the Ministry, but
indeed I esteem your departure from us amongst the weightiest: but I perceive
God will have us to be deprived of whatsoever we idolize, that he may have his
own room. I see exceeding small fruit of my Ministry, and would be glad to
know of one soul to be my crown and rejoicing in the day of Christ. Though I
spend my strength in vain, yet my labor is with my God, Isa. 49, 9. I wish and
pray that the Lord would harden my face against all, and make me to learn to
go with my face against a storm. Again I commend you, body and spirit to him
who has loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood. Grace, grace,
grace for ever be with you. Pray, pray continually.

Anwoth. Sept, 14. 1629. Your La: at all dutiful obedience in Christ, S. R.

To JOHN KENNEDY. (6.)
My loving and most affectionat brother in Christ.
I Salute you with grace, mercy and peace from God our father, and from our
Lord Jesus Christ. I promised to write to you, and although late enough, yet
now I make it good. I heard with grief, of your great danger of perishing by
the sea, but of your merciful deliverance with joy. Sure I am, Brother, Satan
will leave no stone unrolled [as the proverb is] to roll you off your rock, or
at least to shake and unsettle you: For at that same time, the mouths of wicked
men were opened in hard speeches against you by land, and the Prince of the
power of the air was angry with you by sea: See then how much ye are obliged to
that malitions murderer, who would beat you with two rods at one time, but
blessed be God, his arm is short: If the sea and winds would have obeyed him,
ye had never come to land: Thank your God who says: Rev. 1, 18. I have the
keys of hell and of death. Deuteronomy, 32, 39. I kill and I make alive. 1, Sam. 2, 6.
The Lord brings down to the grave and brings up. If Satan were Iayl^ur and
had the keys of Death and or the Grave, they should be stored with more
prisoners. Ye were knocking at these black gates and ye found the doors shut,
and we do all welcome you back again: I trust ye know it is not for nothing,
that ye are sent to us again: The Lord knew ye had forgotten something that was
necessary for your journey, that your armor was not as yet thick enough
against the stroke of death: Now in the strength of Jesus, dispatch your
business: that debt is not forgiven, but fristed: Death has not bidden you
farewell, but has only left you for a short season: End your journey ere the
night come upon you, have all in readiness against the time that ye must sail
through that black and impetuous Jordan, and Jesus, Jesus who knows both
these depths and the rocks and all the coasts, be your Pilot: That last tide
will not wait for you one moment: if ye forget any thing, when your sea is full
and your foot in that ship, there is no returning again to fetch it: What ye
do amiss in your life to day, ye may amend it to morrow: for as many suns as
God makes to arise upon you, ye have as many new lives: but ye can die but
once, and if ye mar or spill that business, ye cannot come back to mend that
piece of work again: No man sins twice in dying ill: As we die but once, so
we die but ill or well once. Ye see now the number of your months is written
in God's book, and as one of the Lord's hirelings, ye must work till the shadow
of the evening come upon you, and ye shall run out your glass even to the last
pickle of sand: fulfill your course with joy, for we take nothing to the grave
with us, but a good or evil conscience. And although the sky clear after this
storm, yet clouds will engender another: Ye contracted with Christ, I hope,
when first ye began to follow him, that ye would bear his cross; fulfill your
part of the Contract with patience and break not to Jesus Christ: Be honest,
Brother, in your bargaining with him, for who knows better how to bring up
children then our God? For [to lay aside his knowledge, of the which there is
no searching out] he has been practiced in bringing up his heirs these 5000
years, and his bairns are all well brought up, and many of them are honest men
now at home up in their own house in heaven, and are entered heirs to their
father's inheritance: Now the form of his bringing up was by chastisements,
scourging, correcting, nurturing: See if he makes exception of any of his
bairns, Rev. 3. 19. Heb. 12. 7, 8. No: His eldest Son and his heir, Jesus, is
not excepted. Heb. 2. 10. Suffer we must, ere we were born God dcreed it, and
it is easier to complain of his decree then to change it. It is true, terrors
of conscience cast us down, and yet without terrors of conscience we cannot be
raised up again; fears and doubtings shake us, and yet without fears and
doubtings we would soon sleep and loose our grips of Christ; tribulation and
tentations will almost loose us at the root, and yet without tribulations and
temptations we can now no more grow, then herbs or corn without rain. Sin and
Satan and the World will say and cry in our ear that we have a hard reckoning
to make in Judgment, and yet none of these three, except they lie, dare say in
our face that our sin can change the Tenor of the new Covenant. Forward then,
dear Brother, and lose not your grip, hold fast the Truth, for the world sell
not one dram weight of God's truth, especially now when most me^ measure Truth
by time, like young seamen setting their Compass by a cloud: For now Time is
father and mother to Truth in the thoughts and practices of our evil Time. The
God of Truth establish us; for Alas! Now there are none to comfort the
prisoners of hope and the mourners in Zion: We can do little except pray and
mourn for Iosep^ in the stocks: And let their tongue cleave to the roof of
their mouth, who forget Jerusalem now in her day: And the Lord remember Edom
and render to him as he has done to us. Now, Brother, I will not weary you,
but I entreat you remember my dearest love to Mr David Dickson; with whom I
have small acquaintance, yet I bless the Lord, I know he both prays and does
for our dying Kirk. Remember my dearest love to John Stuart, whom I love in
Christ, and show him from me, I do always remember him, and hope for a
meeting: The Lord Jesus establish him more and more, though he be already a
strong man in Christ. Remember my heartiest affection in Christ to ^illiam
Rodger, whom I also remember to ^od: I wish the first news I hear of him and
you and all that love our common Savior in these bounds, may be, that ye are
so knit and linked and kindly fastened in love with the Son of God, that ye may
say, now if we would never so fain escape out of Christ's hands, yet love has
so bound us, that we cannot get our ^ands f^ce again, he has so ravished our
hearts, that there is no loosing of his grips, the chains of his soul-ravishing
love are so s^rong, that the Crave nor Death will not b^^^k them. I hope,
Brother, yea I doubt not of it, but ye lay me and my first entry to the Lord's
vineyard, and my flock before him who has put me in his work, as the Lord
knows since first I saw you, I have been mindful of you. Marion Mcknaught
does remember most heartily her love to you and to John Stuart: Blessed be the
Lord, that in God's mercy I found in this country such a woman, to whom Jesus
is dearer then her own heart, when there be so many that cast Christ over their
shoulder. Good Brother, call to mind the memory of your worthy father now
asleep in Christ, and as his custom was, pray continually, and wrestle for the
life of a dying breathless Kirk: And desire John Stuart not to forget poor
Zion, she has ^ew friends and few to speak one good word for her. Now I
commend you, your whole soul and body and spirit to Jesus Christ and his
keeping, hoping ye will die and live, stand and fall, with the cause of our
Master, Jesus: The Lord Jesus himself be with your spirit.

Anwoth. Feb. 2. 1637. Your loving Brother in our Lord Jesus, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (7)
MADAM.
I Have longed exceedingly to hear of your life and health, and growth in the
grace of God. I lacked the opportunity of a bearer, in respect I did not
understand of the hasty departure of the last, by whom I might have saluted
your La: and therefore I could not write before this time. I entreat you, Madam
let me have two lines from you concerning your present condition: I know ye are
in grief and heaviness, and if it were not so, ye might be afraid, because then
your way should not be so like the way that our Lord says, leads to the new
Jerusalem: Sure I am, if ye knew what were before you or if ye saw but some
glances of it, ye would with gladness swim through the present floods of
sorrow, spreading forth your arms out of desire to be at land: If God have
given you the earnest of the Spirit as part of payment of God's principal
sum, ye have to rejoice, for our Lord will not lose his earnest, neither will
he go back or repent him of the bargain. If ye find at some time a longing to
see God, joy in the assurance of that sight [howbeit that feast be but like the
Passover that comes about only once a year] peace of conscience, liberty of
prayer, the doors of God's treasure casten up to the soul; and a clear sight of
himself looking out and saying with a smiling countenance, Welcome in to me,
afflicted soul; this is the earnest that he gives sometimes, and which makes
glad the heart, and is an evidence that the bargain will hold: But to the end
ye may get this earnest, it were good to come often in terms of speech with God,
both in prayer and hearing of the word: For this is the house of wine, where ye
meet with your Welbeloved, here it is where he kisseth you with the kisses of
his mouth, and where ye feel the smell of his garments, and they have indeed a
most fragrant and glorious smell: Ye must, I say, wait upon him, and be often
communing with him whose lips are as lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh,
and by the moving thereof he will assuage your grief: for the Christ that
saves you is a speaking Christ, the Church knows him, Cant. 2. By his voice,
and she can discern his tongue amongst a thousand: I say this to the end ye
should not love th^se dumb masks of Antichristian Ceremonies, that the Church
where ye are for a time, has casten over the Christ whom your soul loves:
This is to set before you a dumb Christ: ^ut when our Lord comes, ^e speaks
to the heart in the simplicity of the Gospel. I have neither tongue nor pen to
express to you the happiness of such as are in Christ: When ye have sold all
that ye have and bought the field wherein this pearl is, ye will think it no
bad market, for if ye be in him, all his is yours, and ye are in him, therefore
because he lives, ye shall live also, Ioh. 14. 19. And what is that else? But
as if the Son had said, I will not have heaven except my redeemed ones be with
me, they and I cannot live asunder. Abide in me and I in you, Ioh. 15. 5. O
sweet communion, when Christ and we are through other, and are no longer two!
Father, I will that these whom thou have given me, be with me where I am, to
behold my glory that thou have given me. Ioh. 17. 24. Amen; dear Jesus, let it
be according to that word. I wonder that ever your heart should be casten down,
if ye believe this truth: and they are not worthy of Jesus Christ, who will not
suffer forty years troubles for him, since they have such glorious promises:
But we fools believe these promises as the man that read Plato's writings
concerning the immortality of the soul, so long as the book was in his hand, he
believed all was true, and that the Soul could not die; but so soon as he laid
by the book, presently he began to imagine that the Soul is but a smoke or airy
vapor that perishes with the expiring of the breath: So we at starts do
assent to the sweet and precious promises, but laying aside God's book we begin
to call all in question: It is faith indeed to believe without a pledge and to
hold the heart constant at this work, and when we doubt, to run to the Law and
to the Testimony and stay there: Madam, hold you here, here is your father's
Testament, read it, in it he has left to you Remission of sins and life
everlasting If all that ye have here be crosses and troubles, down-castings,
frequent desertions, and departure of the Lord, who is suiting you in marriage;
courage, he who is wooer and suitor should not be an houshold-man with you,
till ye and He come up to his father's house together: He purposes to do you
good at your latter end. Deuteronomy. 8: 16. and to give you rest from the days of
adversity, Psalm. 94, 13. It is good to bear the yoke of God in your youth, Lam.
3: 27. Turn in to your strong hold as a prisoner of hope, Zech. 9, 12. For the
vision is for an appointed time, but at the end it shall speak and not lie,
though it tarry, wait for it, because it will surely come, it will not tarry,
Hab, 2, 3. Hear himself saying, Isa, 26, 20. Come my people [rejoyce, he
calls on you] enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee:
hide thy self as it were for a little moment, till the indignation be past.
Believe then, believe and be saved: think not hard ^f ^e get not your will, nor
your delights in this life; God will have you to rejoice in nothing but
himself: God forbid that ye should rejoice in any thing, but in the cross of
Christ, Gal 4. 16. Our Church, Madam, is decaying, she is like Ephraim's cake,
and gray hairs are here and there upon her, and she knows it not, Hos. 7, 9.
She is old and gray haired, near the grave, and no man takes it to heart, her
wine is sour and is corrupted. Now if Phinehas wife did live, she might travel
in birth and die to see the Ark of God taken and the glory departing from our
Israel: The power and life of religion is away: Woe be to us, for the day goes
away, for the shadows of the evening are stretched out, Ier, 6, 4. Madam, Zion
is the ship wherein ye are carried to Canaan, if she suffer sh^p-wrack ye will
be casten overboard upon death and life, to swim to land upon broken boards:
It were time for us by prayer to put upon our Master-pilot Jesus, and to cry,
Master save us, we perish. Grace, grace ^e with you. We would think it a
blessing to our Kirk to see you here, but our sins withold good things from us.
The great Messenger of the covenant preserve you in body and spirit.

Anwoth. Feb. 1. 1630. Yours in the Lord, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (8)
MADAM.
GRace mercy and peace be multiplied upon you: I received your La: letter, in
the which I perceive your case in this world smells of a fellowship and
communion with the Son of God in his sufferings: Ye cannot, ye must not have a
more pleasant or more easy condition here, then he had, who through
afflictions was made perfect, Heb. 2: 10, We may indeed think, Cannot God bring
us to heaven with ease and prosperity? Who doubts but he can? But his
infinite wisdom thinks and decrees the contrary, and we cannot see a reason
of it, yet he has a most just reason: We never with our eyes saw our own soul,
yet we have a soul; we see many rivers, but we know not their first spring and
original fountain, yet they have a beginning. Madam, when ye are come to the
other side of the water and have set down your foot on the shore of glorious
Eternity, and look back again to the waters and to your wearisom journey, and
shall see in that clear glass of endless glory, nearer to the bottom of God's
wisdom; ye shall then be forced to say, If God had done otherwise with me then
he has done, I had never come to the enjoying of this crown of glory. It is
your part now to believe and suffer and hope and wait on, for I protest in the
presence of that all-discerning eye, who knows, what I write and what I
think, that I would not want the sweet experience of the consolations of God,
for all the bitterness of affliction: nay, whether God come to his children
with a rod or a crown, if he come himself with it, it is well: Welcome, welcome
Jesus, what way soever thou come, if we can get a sight of thee: and sure I am,
it is better to be sick, providing Christ come to the bedside and draw the
curtains and say, Courage, I am thy salvation, the^ to enjoy health being
lusty and strong, and never to be visited of God. Worthy and de a^ Lady, in
the strength of Christ, fight and overcome: Ye are now your alone, but ye may
have for the seeking, three always in your company, the Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit: I trust they are near you. Ye are now deprived of the comfort of a
lively Ministry, so was Israel in their captivity, yet hear God's promise to
them, Ezekiel. 11: 16. Therefore say, Thus says the Lord God, Although I have
cast them far off among the heat e^ and although I have scattered them among
the countries, yet will be to them as a little Sanctuary in the countries where
they shall come: Behold a Sanctuary, for a Sanctuary, God himself in the place
and room of the Temple of Jerusalem: I trust in God, carrying this Temple about
with you, ye shall see Iehovah's beauty in his house. We are in great fears of
a great and fearful trial to come upon the Kirk of God; For these who would
build their houses and nests upon the ashes of mourning Jerusalem, have drawn
our King upon hard and langerous conclusions against such as are termed
Puritans, for the rooting of them out. Our Prelates [the Lord take the keys of
his house from these bastard-porters] assure us, that for such as will not
confor^, there is nothing but Imprisonment and Deprivation^ The Spouse of Jesus
will ever be in the fire, but I trust in my God, she shall not consume, because
of the goodwill of him who dwells in the bu^h for he dwells in it with good
will. All sort of crying sins without controlment abound in our Land (...) the
glory of the Lord is departing from Israel, and the Lord is looking back over
his shoulder, to see if any will say, Lord tarry, and no man requesteth him to
stay. Corrupt and false doctrine is openly preached by the Idol-shepherds of
the Land. For myself, I have daily griefs through the disobedience unto, and
contempt of the word of God. I was summoned before the High Commission by a
profligate person in this Parish, convicted of incest: in the business Mr
Alexander Colvill [for respect to your La:] was my great friend, and wrote a
most kind letter to me: The Lord give him mercy in that day. Upon the day of
my compearance, the sea and winds refused to give passage to the Bishop of St
Andrews. I entreat you La: thank Mr Alexander Colvill with two lines of a
letter. My wife now after long disease and torment, for the space of a year and
month, is departed this life: the Lord has done it, blessed be his name. I
have been diseased of a fever tertian for the space of thirteen weeks, and am
yet in that sickness, so that I preach but once on the sabbath with great
difficulty: I am not able either to visit or examine the Congregation. The
Lord Jesus be with your spirit.

Anwoth. 26. June. 1630. Your La: at all obedience, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE (9.)
MADAM.
HAving saluted you in the Lord Jesus, I thought it my duty, having the
occasion of this bearer, to write again unto your La: though I have no new
purpose but what I wrote of before: Yet ye cannot be too often awakned to go
forward toward your city, since your way is long, and [for any thing ye know]
your day is short; and your Lord requires of you as ye advance in years, and
steal forward insensibly toward eternity, that your says may grow and ripen
for the Lords harvest, for the great husbandman gives a season to his fruits
that they may come to maturitie, and having gotten their fill of the tree, they
may then be shaken and gathered in for his use; whereas the wicked rot upon the
tree, and their branch shall not be green. Job. 15. 32. 33. He shall shake off
his unripe grapes as the vine, and shall cast often his flower as the olive. It
is God's mercy to you, ^adam, that (...) gives you your fill, even to
loathing, of this bitter world, that ye may willingly leave it, and like a full
and satisfied banquetter, long for the drawing of the table; and at last having
trampled under your feet, all the ^otten pleasure that are under un and Moon;
and having rejoiced as though ye rejoiced not, and having bought as though ye
possessed not, 1 Cor. 7. 30. Ye may like an old crazie ship, arrive at your
Lord's harbor, and be made welcome, as one of these who have ever had one foot
loose from this earth, longing for that place where your soul shall feast and
banquet for ever and ever, upon a gloriou^ sight of the incomprehensible
Trinity, and where ye shall see the fair face of the man Christ; even the
beautiful face that was once for your cause more marred then any of the
visages of the sons of men. Isa: 52, 14. And was all covered with spitting and
blood: Be content to wade through the waters betwixt you and glory with Him,
holding his hand fast, for he knows all the foords: Howbeit ye may be duckt,
yet ye cannot drown, being in his company: and ye may all the way to glory, see
the way bedewed with his blood who is the forerunner: be not afraid therefore,
when ye come even to the black and swelling river of death, to put in your foot
and wade after him; the current how strong soever cannot carry you down the
water to Hell, the Son of God, his death and resurrection are stepping-stones
and a stay to you: set down your feet by faith upon these stones, and go
through as on dry land: If ye knew what he is preparing for you, ye would be
too glad; he will not [it may be] give you a full-draught, till ye come up to
the wellhead, and drink, yea drink abundantly of the pure river of the water
of Life, that proceeds out from the Throne of God and from the Lamb. Rev. 22,
1. Madam, ^tire not, weary not, I dare find you the Son of God caution when ye
are got up thither, and have casten your eyes to view the golden city and the
fair and never-withering tree of Life, that bears twelve manner of fruits
every month, ye shall then say, four and twenty hours abode in that place is
worth threescore and ten years sorrow upon earth. If ye can but say, ye long
earnestly to be carried up thither [as I hope you cannot for shame deny him the
honor of having wrought that desire in your soul] then has your Lord given
you earnest: And, Madam, do ye believe that our Lord will lose his earnest,
and rue of the bargain, and change his mind, as if he were a man that can lie,
or the son of man that can repent? Nay, he is unchangeable, and the same this
year that he was the former year: And his Son Jesus, who upon earth eat and
drank with publicans and sinners, and spoke and conferred with whores and
harlots, and put up his holy hand and touched the lepers filthy skin, and came
evermore nigh sinners; even now in glory, is yet that same Lord: His honor and
his great court in leaven has not made him forget his poor friends on earth:
In him, honors change not manners, and he does yet desire your company: Take
him for the old Christ, and claim still kindness to him, and say, Oh it is so,
He is not changed, but I am changed: Nay, it is a part of his unchangeable
love, and an article of the new covenant to keep you that ye cannot dispon him,
nor sell him: He has not played fast and loose with us in the Covenant of
Grace, so, that we may run from him at our pleasure: His love has made the
bargain surer then so; for Jesus, as the cautioner is bound for us, Heb, 7, 22.
And it cannot stand with his honor to die in the burrows [as we use to say]
and lose these whom he must render again to the father, when he shall give up
the Kingdom to him: Consent and say Am^ to the promises, and ye have sealed
That God is tru^ and Christ is yours: This is an easy market: Ye but look on
with faith; for Christ suffered all and paid all. Madam, fearing I be tedious,
to your La: I must stop here, desiring always to hear that your La: is well,
and that ye have still your face up the mountain. Pray for us, Madam, and for
Zion whereof ye are apart: We expect a trial: God's wheat in this land must go
through Satan's sieve, but their faith shall not fail. I am still wrestling in
our Lord's work, and have been tried and tempted with brethren who look awry to
the Gospel. Now he that is able to keep you until that day, preserve your
soul, body and spirit, and present you before his face with his own Bride,
spotless and blamless.

Anwoth. Nov. 26. 1631. Your La to be commanded always in the Lord Jesus. S R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (10.)
MADAM.
I Am grieved exceedingly that your La: should think, or have cause to think
that such as love you in God, in this country, are forgetful of you: For my
self, Madam, I ow to your La; all evidences of my high respect (in the sight of
my Lord, whose truth I preach, I am bold to say it) for his rich grace in you:
My Communion put off till the end of a longsom and rainny harvest and the
Presbyteriall exercise [as the bearer can inform your La:] hindered me to see
you: And for my people's sake [finding them like hot iron, that cools being
out of the fire, and that is pliable to no work] I do not stir abroad, neither
have I left them at all since your La: was in this country, save at one time
only, about two years ago; yet I dare not say but it is a fault, howbeit no
defect in my affection: and I trust to make it up again, so soon as possibly I
am able, to wait upon you. Madam, I have no new purpose to write unto you, but
of that which I think, nay, which our Lord thinks needful, that one thing,
Marie's good part, which ye have chosen, Luk: 10, 42. Madam, all that God has,
both himself and the creatures, he is dealing and parting amongst the sons of
Adam: There are none so poor as that they can say in his face, He has given
them nothing; But thereis no small ods betwixt the gifts given to lawful
bairns and to bastards: And the more greedy ye are in suiting, the more willing
he is to give, delighting to be called open handed: I hope your La: labors
to get assurance of the surest patrimony, even God himself; ye will find in
Christianity, that God aims in all his dealings with his children, to bring
them to a high contempt, of and deadly feud with the world, and to set an high
price upon Christ, and to think him one who cannot be bought for gold, and
well-worthy the fighting for: And for no other cause, Madam, does the Lord
withdraw from you the childish toys and the earthly delights that he gives
unto others; but that he may have you wholly to himself: Think therefore of the
Lord, as of one who comes to woo you in marriage, when ye are in the furnace;
He seeks his answer of you in affliction, to see if ye will say even so I
take him: Madam, give him this answer pleasantly, and in your mind do not
secretly grudge nor murmr: When he is striking you in love, beware to st^e
again: That is dangerous, for these who strike again, shall get the last blow:
If I hit not upon the right string, it is because I am not acquainted with your
La: present condition; But I believe your La: goes on foot laughing and
putting on a good countenance before the world, and yet ye carry heaviness
about with you: Ye do well, Madam, not to make them witnesses of your grief
who cannot be curer^ of it: But be exceeding charitable of your dear Lord: As
there be some friends worldly of whom ye will not entertain an ill thought, far
more ought ye to believe good evermore of your dear friend, that lovely fair
person Jesus Christ. The thorn is one of the most cursed and angry and crabbed
weeds, that the earth yields, and yet out of it springs the Rose, one of
the sweetest smelled flowers and most delightful to the eye, that the earth
has: Your Lord shall make joy and gladness out of your afflictions, for all
his roses have a fragrant smell: wait for the time when his own holy hand shall
hold them to your nose, and if ye would have present comfort under the cross,
be much in prayer, for at that time your faith kisseth Christ and he kisseth
the soul, and O if the breath of his holy mouth be sweet! I dare be caution,
out of some small experience, that ye shall not be beguiled; for the world
[yea, not a few number of God's children] know not well what that is, which
they call a Godhead: But Madam, come near to the Godhead and look down to the
bottom of the well, there is much in him, and sweet were that death to drown in
such a well: Your grief takes liberty to work upon your mind, when ye are not
busied in the meditation of the eveedelighting and all-blessed Godhead. If ye
would lay the price ye give out [which is but some few years pain and trouble]
beside the commodities ye are to receive, ye would see they are not worthy to
be laid in the balance together; but it is Nature that makes you look what ye
give out, and weakness of Faith that hinders you to see what ye shall take
in. Amend your hope and frist your faithful Lord a while, he makes himself
your debtor in the new Covenant, he is honest, take his word, Na^um. 1. 9.
Affliction ^hail not spr^g up the second time. Rev. 21. 7 He that overcomes
shall inherit all things. Of all thing. then which ye want in this life, Madam,
I am able to say nothing, if that be not believed which ye have, Rev. 2, 7. and
Rev. 3. 5. the overcomer shall be clothed in white raiment, etc. and ver: 8.
(...) the overcomer I will give to sit ^ite me (...) my throne (...) I overcame
and am set down with my father in his throne. Consider, Madam, if ye are not
high up now, and far ben in the palace of our Lord, when ye are upon a throne
in white raiment at lovely Christ's elbow. O th ice fools are we, who like new
born Princes weeping in the cradle, know not that there is a Kingdom before
them! Then let our Lord's sweet hand square us and hammer us, and strike off
the knots of pride, self-love, and world-worship and infidelity, that he may
make us stones and pillars in his father's house. Rev. 3, 12. Madam, what think
ye to take binding with the fair cornerstone Jesus? The Lord give you wisdom
to believe and hope, your day is coming: I hope to be a witness of your joy, as
I have been a hearer and beholder of your grief. Think ye much to follow the
heir of the crown, who had experience of sorrows and was acquainted with grief,
Isa 53. It were pride to aim to be above the King's son: It is more then we
deserve that we are equals in glory, in a manner. Now commending you to the
dearest grace and mercy of God, I rest.

MADAM.
UNderstanding, a little after the writing of my last letter, of the going of
this bearer, I would not omit the oppornity of remembering your La: still
harping upon that string, which in our whole lifetime is never too often
touched upon, nor is our lesson well enough learned, that there is a necessity
of advancing in the way to the Kingdom of God, of the contempt of the world, of
denying our self and bearing of our Lord's cross, which is no less needful for
us then daily food: and among many marks that we are on this journey and under
sail toward heaven, this is one, when the love of God so fills our hearts,
that we forget to love and care too much for the having or wanting of other
things, as one extreme heat burns out another. By this, Madam, ye know ye
have betrothed your soul in marriage to Christ, when ye do make but small
reckoning of all other suitors or wooers, and when ye can [having little in
hand, but much in hope] live as a young heir, during the time of his nonage
and Minority, being content to be as hardly handled and under as precise a
reckoning, as servants, because his hope is upon the inheritance: For this
cause God's bairns take well with spoiling of their goods; Heb. 10. 34. knowing
in themselves that they have in heaven a better, and an enduring substance.
That day that the earth and the works therein shall be burnt with fire, 2 Pet.
3. 10. your hidden hope and your hidden life shall appear: and therefore since
ye have not now many years to your endless eternity, and know not how soon the
sky above your head will rive, and the Son of man will be seen in the clouds
of heaven, what better and wiser course can ye take then to think that your one
foot is here and your other foot in the life so come, and to leave off loving,
desiring, or grieving for the wants that shall be made up when your Lord and ye
shall meet, and when ye shall give in your bill, that day, of all your wants
here? If your losses be not made up, ye have place to challenge the Almighty,
but it shall not be so, Ye shall then rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
glory, and your joy shall none take from you. Ioh. 16, 22. It is enough that
the Lord has promised you great things, only let the time of bestowing them
be in his own carving: It is not for us to set an hou^-glass to the creator of
time, since he and we differ only in the the of payment: Since he has
promised payment and we believe it, it is no great matter, we will put that in
his own will, as the frank buyer who comes near to what the seller seeks,
uses at last to refer the difference to his will and so cutteth off the course
of mutual prigging. Madam, do not prigge wish your frank-hearted and gracious
Lord about the time of the fulfilling of your joys, it will be, God has said
it, bide his harvest, wait on upon his Whitsorday: His day is better then your
day, he puts not the hook in the corn till it be ripe and full-eared: The
great Angel of the covenant bear you company, till the trumpet shall sound and
the voice of the Archangel awaken the dead. Ye shall find it your only
happiness under whatever thing disturbeth and ^^^sseth the peace of your mind
in this life, to love nothing for it self, but only God for himself: It is the
crcoked love of some harlots, that they love bracelets, earrings, and rings
better then the lover that sends them: God will not be so loved, for that
were to behave as harlots and not as the chaste Spouse, to abate from our love
when these things are pulled away: Cur love to him should begin on earth as it
shall be in heaven, for the Bride takes not by a thousand degrees so much
delight in her wedding garment, as she does in her Bridegroom; so we in the
life to come, howbeit clothed with glory as with a robe, shall not be so much
affected with the glory that goes about us, as with the Bridegroom's joyful
face and presence. Madam, if ye can win to the here, the field is won; and your
mind, for anything ye want or for any thing your Lord can take from you, shall
soon be calmed and quieted: Get himself as a pawn and keep him, till your dear
Lord come and loose the pawn, and ^ue upon you and give you all again, that he
took from you, even a thousand talents for o^e penny: It is not ill to lend God
willingly, who otherwise both will and may take from you against your will: It
is good to play the ^surer with him, and take in, in stead of ten of the
hundred, an hundred often, an hundred of one. Madam, fearing to be tedious to
you, I break off here, commending you [as I trust to do, while I live] your
person, ways, burdens and all that concerns you, to that Almighty who is
able to bear you and your burdens: I still remember you to him who will cause
you one, day to laugh. I expect that what ever ye can do by word or deed, for
the Lord's friendless Zion, ye will do it: She is your mother, forget her not,
for the Lord intends to melt and try this land, and it is high time we were
all upon our feet, and falling about to try what claim we have to Christ: It is
like the the Bridegroom will be taken from us and then we shall mourn: Dear
Jesus, remove not, else take us with thee! Grace, grace be with you for ever.

Anwoth, 14. Jan. 1632. Your La: at all dutiful obedience, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (12)
MADAM.
YOur La: will not [I know] weary nor offend, though I trouble you with many
letters; the memory of what obligations I am under to your La: is the cause of
it. I am possibly impertinent in what I write, because of my ignorance of your
present estate: But for all that is said, I have learned of M: W. D. that ye
have not changed upon, nor wearied of your sweet Master, Christ, and his
service; neither were it your part to change upon him, who rests in his love.
Ye are among honorable company and such as affect grandour and court. But,
Madam, thinking upon your estate, I think I see an improvident wooer coming too
late to seek a Bride, because she is contracted already and promised away to
another, and so the wooer's busking and bravery [who comes to you as who but
he] is in vain: the outward pomp of this busy wooer, a beguiling world, is now
coming in to suit your soul too late, when ye have promised away your soul to
Christ many years ago: And I know, Madam, what answer ye may now justly make
to the late suter, even this, Ye are to long of coming: my soul, the Bride, is
away already, and the contract with Christ subscribed, and I cannot cause, but
I must be honest and faithful to him. Honourable-Lady, keep your first love,
and hold the first match with that soul-delighting lovely Bridegroom, our
sweet, sweet Jesus, fairer then all the children of men, the Rose of Sharon,
and the fairest and sweetest smelled Rose in all his father's garden, there is
none like him: I would not exchange one smile of his lovely face, with
Kingdoms. Madam, let others take their silly feckless heaven in this life, envy
them not, but let your soul, like a tarrowing and misiearned child take the
dorts [as we use to speak] or cast at all things and disdain them, except one
only, either Christ or nothing: your welbeloved, Jesus, will be content that
ye be here devotely proud and ill to please, as one that contemns all
husbands but himself: Either the King's son or no husband at all, this is
humble and worthy ambition: What have ye to do to dally with a whorish and
foolish world? Your jealous husband will not be content that ye look by him to
another, he will be jealous indeed and offend, if ye kiss another but himself.
What weights do burden you, Madam, I know not; but think it great mercy that
your Lord from your youth has been hedging in your out-straying affections,
that they may not go a whoring from himself: If ye were his bastard, he would
not nurture you so: If ye were for the slaughter, ye would be fatned: But be
content, ye are his wheat growing in our Lord's field, Matthew. 13: v. 25, 38.
And if wheat, ye must go under our Lord's threshing instrument in his
barn-^oor and through his sieve, Amos 9: v. 9. And through his mill to be
bruised, as the Prince of your salvation, Jesus, was, Isa. 53: 9. that ye may
be found good bread in your Lord's house. Lord Jesus, bless the spiritual
husbandry, and separate you from the chaff that dow not bide the wind. I am
persuaded your glass is spending it self by little and little, and if ye knew
who is before you, ye would rejoice in your tribulations: Think ye it a small
honor to stand before the throne of God and the Lamb, and to be clothed in
white, and to be called to the Marriage-supper of the Lamb, and to be led to
the fountain of living waters and to come to the wellhead, even God himself,
and get your fill of the clear, cold, sweet, refreshing water of life, the
King's own well, and to put up your now sinful hand to the tree of life, and
take down and eat the sweetest apple in all God's heavenly Paradise, Jesus
Christ, your life and your Lord? Up your heart. shout for joy, your King is
coming to fetch you to his father's house. Madam, I am in exceeding great
heaviness, God thinking it best for my own soul thus to exercise me, thereby
(it may be) to fit me to be his mouth to others: I see and hear, at home and
abroad, nothing but matter of grief and discouragement, which indeed makes my
life bitter: And I hope in God never to get my will in this world, and I expect
ere long a fiery trial upon the Church, for as many men almost in England and
Scotland, as many false friends to Christ, and as many pulling and drawing, to
pull the crown off his holy head, and for fear that our Beloved stay amongst us
[as if his room were more desirable then himself] men are bidding him go seek
his lodging. Madam, if ye have a part in silly friendless Zion [as I know ye
have] speak a word on her behalf to God and man: If ye can do nothing else,
speak for Jesus, and ye shall thereby be a witness against this declining age.
Now from my very soul, laying and leaving you on the Lord, and desiring a part
in your prayers [as my Lord knows, I remember you] I deliver over your body,
spirit and all your necessities to the hands of our Lord, and remains for ever.

To my Lady KENMURE. (14)
MADAM.
THe cause of my not writing to your La: is not my forgetfulness of you, but
the want of the opportunity of a convenient bearer, for I am under more then a
simple obligation to be kind [in paper, at least] to your La: I bless our Lord
through Christ, who has brought you home again to your country from that
place where ye have seen with your eyes that which our Lord's truth taught you
before, to wit, that worldly glory is nothing but a vapor, a shadow, the foam
of the water, or something less and lighter, even nothing, and that our Lord
has not without cause said in his word, 1 Cor. 7. 31. The countenance or
fashion of this world passes away: In which place our Lord compares it to an
Image in a looking-glass, for it is the looking-glass of Adam's sons: Some come
to the glass and see in it the picture of Honor and but a picture indeed, for
true Honor is to be great in the sight of God; and others see in it the shadow
of Riches, and but a shadow indeed, for durable Riches stand as one of the
maids of Wisdom upon her left hand, Prove. 3. 16. and a third sort see in it the
face of painted Pleasures, and the beholders will not believe but the Image
they see in this glass is a living man, till the Lord come and break the glass
in pieces and remove the face, and then, like Pharaoh awakened, they say, And
behold it was a dream. I know your La: thinks your self little in the common
of this world, for the favorable aspect of any of these three painted faces,
and blessed be our Lord that it is so, the better for you: Madam, they are not
worthy to be wooers to suit in marriage your soul, that looks to an higher
match then to be married upon painted clay: know therefore, Madam, the place
whither our Lord Jesus comes to woo a Bride, it is even in the furnace: for
if ye be one of Zion's daughters (which I ever put beyond all question, since I
first had occasion to see in your La: such pregnant evidences of the grace of
God) the Lord who has his fire in Zion and his furnace in Jerusalem, Isa. 31:
9. is purifying you in the furnace. And therefore be content to live in it, and
every day to be adding and sowing-to a pasment to your wedding garment, that ye
may be at last decored and trimmed as a Bride for Christ, a Bride of his own
busking, beautified in the hidden man of the heart, forgetting your Father's
house, so shall the King greatly desire your beauty, Psalm. 45: 11. If your La:
be not changed (as I hope ye are not) I believe ye esteem your self to be of
these whom God has tried these many years and refined as silver. But, Madam, I
will show your La: a privilege that others want and ye have in this case: Such
as are in prosperity and are fatted with earthly joys, and increased with
children and friends, though the Word of God is indeed written to such for
their instruction, yet to you [who are in trouble] spare me, Madam, to say this
[from whom the Lord has taken many children, and whom he has exercised
otherwise] there are some chapters, some particular promises in the Word of
God, made, in a most special manner, which should never have been yours so, as
they now are, if ye had your portion in this life as others: and therefore, all
the comforts, promises and mercies God offers to the afflicted, they are as
many love letters written to you; take them to you, Madam, and claim your right
and be not robbed: It is no small comfort that God has written some Scriptures
to you, which he has not written to others, ye seem rather in this to be
envied then pitied, and ye are indeed in this, like people of another world and
these that are above the ordinary rank of mankind, whom our King and Lord, our
Bridegroom Jesus, in his love-letter to his welbeloved Spouse, has named
beside all the rest, and has written comforts and his hearry commendations, in
the 56 of I saiah, verse 4, 5. Bsal. 147, 2, 3, to you: Read these and the like,
and think your God is like a friend that sends a letter to a whole house and
family, but speaks in his letter to some by name that are dearest to him in
the house: Ye are then, Madam, of the dearest friends of the Bridegroom: If it
were lawful, I would envy you, that God honored you so above many of his
dear children. Therefore, Madam, your partis, in this case [seeing God takes
nothing from you, but that which he is to supply with his own presence] to
desire your Lord to know his own room, and take it even upon him to come in, in
the room of dead children, Jehovah know thy own place and take it to thee, is
all ye have to say: Madam, I persuade my self, that this world is to you an
uncouth Innes, and that ye are like a traveller who has his bundel upon his
back and his staff in his hand and his feet upon the door-threshold: Go
forward, honorable and elect Lady, in the strength of your Lord [let the world
bide at home and keep the house] with your face toward him who longs more for
a sight of you, then ye can do for him: ere it be long he will see us: I hope
to see you laugh as cheerfully afternoon, as ye have mourned before-noon: The
hand of the Lord, the hand of the Lord be with you in your journey: What have
ye to do here? This is not your mountain of rest, arise then and set your foot
up the mountain, go up out of the wilderness leaning upon the shoulder of your
Beloved, Caent, 8, v. 5, If ye knew the welcome that abides you when ye come
home, ye would hasten your pace, for ye shall see your Lord put up his own holy
hand to your face and wipe all tears from your eyes, and I trow, then ye shall
have some joy of heart. Madam, paper wills me to end before affection:
Remember the estate of Zaon, pray that Jerusalem may be as Zechariah
prophesied, Chapter 12: 3. A burdensome stone for all, that whosoever boweth down to
roll the stone out of the way, may hurt and break the joints of their back and
strain their arms and disjoynt their shoulder-blades, and pray Jehovah that the
stone may lie still in it is own place and keep bond with the cornerstone, I
hope it shall be so, he is a skilled Master Builder who laid it. I would,
Madam, under great heaviness be refreshed with two lines from your La: pen,
which I refer to your own wisdom. Madam, I would seen undutifull not to show
you that great solistation is made by the town of Kircudbright for to have the
use of my poor labors amongst them: If the Lord shall call and his people cry,
who am I to resist? but without his seen calling and till the flock whom I now
oversee, be planted with one to whom I dare entrust Christ's Spouse, gold nor
silver nor favor of men, I hope, shall not loose me. I leave your La: praying
more earnestly for grace and mercy to be with you and multiplied upon you here
and hereafter, then my pen can express. The Lord Jesus be with your spirit.

Kirkcudbright. Your La at all obedience in the Lord, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (15.)
MADAM.
HAving saluted you with grace and mercy from God our father and from our Lord
Jesus Christ, I long both to see your La: and to hear how it goes with you; I
do remember you, and present you and your necessities to him who is able to
keep you and present you blameless before his face with joy: and my prayer to
our Lord is that ye may be sick of love for him who died of love for you, I
mean, your Savior Jesus: And O sweet were that sickness to be soul-sick for
him! And a living death it were, to die in the fire of the love of that
soul-lover, Jesus! And Madam, if ye love him ye will keep his commandments,
and this is not one of the least, to lay your neck cheerfully and willingly
under the yoke of Jesus Christ: For I trust your La: did first contract and
bargain with the Son of God to follow him upon these terms, that by his grace
ye should endure hardship and suffer affliction as the soldier of Christ: They
are not worthy of Jesus who will not take a blow for their Master's sake: For
our glorious peacemaker, when he came to make up the friendship betwixt God
and us, God bruised him and struck him, the sinful world also did beat him
and crucify him; yet he took buffets of both the parties, and honor to our
Lord Jesus, he would not leave the field for all that, till he had made peace
betwixt the parties. I persuade ^y self, your sufferings are but like your
Savior's [yea incomparably less and lighter] which are called but a bruising
of his ^eel. Genesis 3. 15, a wound far from the heart: Your life is hid with
Christ in God, Col. 3. 3. And therefore ye cannot be robbed of it. Our Lord
handles us as fathers do their young children; they lay up jewels in a place
above the reach of the short arm of bairns, else ^ai^ns would put up their
hands and take them down and lose them soon: So has our Lord done with our
spiritual life, Jesus Christ is the high coffer in the which our Lord has hid
our life, we children are not able to reach up our arm so high as to take down
that life and lose it, it is in our Christ's hand: O, long, long may Jesus be
Lord Keeper of our life! and happy are they that can with the Apostle, 2 Timothy
1. lay their soul in pawn in the hand of Jesus, for he is able to keep that
which is committed in pawn to him against that day. Then, Madam, so long as
this life is not hurt, all either troubles are but touches in the heel: I trust
ye will soon be cured. Ye know, Madam, Kings have some servants in their court
that receive not present wages in their hand, but live upon their hopes: The
King of Kings also has servants in his court that for the present get little
or nothing but the heavy cross of Christ, troubles without and terrors
within, but they live upon hope, when it comes to the parting of the
inheritance, they remain in the house as heirs: It is better to be so, then to
get present payment and a portion in this life, an inheritance in this world
[God forgive me that I should honor it with the name of an inheritance, it is
rather a farme-room] and then in the end to be casten out of God's house with
this word, Ye have received your consolation, ye will get no more: Alas! What
get they? The rich glutton's heaven: Oh but our Lord, Luke 16. makes it a
silly heaven! He fared well [saith our Lord] and delicately every day: Oh no
more! A silly heaven! Truly no more, except that he was clothed in purple, and
that is all: I persuade my self. Madam, ye have joy when ye think that your
Lord has dealt more graciously with your soul. Ye have gotten little in this
life: It is true indeed: Ye have then the more to crave, yea ye have all to
crave: For except some tastings of the first fruits and some kisses of his
mouth whom your soul loves, ye get no more: But I cannot tell you what is to
come; yet I may speak as our Lord does of it: The foundation of the city is
pure gold, clear as crystal, the twelve ports are set with precious stones: If
orchards and rivers commend a soil upon earth, there is a Paradise there,
wherein grows the tree of life that bears twelve manner of fruits every
month, which is seven score and four harvests in the year, and there is there,
a pure river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the
Lamb, and the city has no need of the light of the sun or moon or of a candle,
for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb is the light thereof. Madam, believe and
hope for this, till ye see and enjoy: Jesus is saying in the Gospel, Come and
see; and he is come down in the chariot of Truth wherein he rides through the
world to conquer men's souls, Psalm. 45. 4. and is now in the word saying, Who
will go with me? will ye go? my Father will make you welcome and give you
house-room, for in my Father's house are many dwelling places: Madam, consent
to go with him. Thus I rest, commending you to God's dearest mercy.

Anwoth. Yours in the Lord Jesus, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (16.)
MADAM.
I Am afraid now [as many others are] that at the sitting down of our
Parliament, our Lord Jesus his Spouse shall be roughly handled: And it must be
so, since false and deelining Scotland, whom our Lord took off the dunghill and
out of hell, and made a fair Bride to himself, has broken her faith to her
sweet husband, and has put on the forehead of a whore; and therefore he says
he will remove: would God we could stir up our selves to lay hold upon him, who
being highly provoked with the handling he has met with, is ready to depart!
Alas, we do not importune him by prayer and supplication, to abide amongst us^
If we could but we^p upon ^^m and in the holy pertinacy of faith, wrestle wit^
and say We will not let thee go, it may be that then, he who is easy to be
entreated would yet, notwithstanding of our high provocations, condescend to
stay and feed among the lilies, till that fair and desirable day break and the
shadows fl^e away. Ah! What cause of mourning is there? When our gold is become
dim, and the visage of our Nazarites sometimes whiter then snow, is now become
blacker then a coal, and Levi's house, once comparable to fine gold, is now
changed, and become like vessels in whom he has no pleasure. Madam, think upon
this, that when our Lord who has his handkerchief to wipe the face of the
mourners in Zion, shall come to wipe away all tears from their eyes, he may
wipe yours also in the passing amongst others. I am confident, Madam, that our
Lord will yet build a new house to himself, of our rejected and scattered
stones: for our bridegroom cannot want a wife: Can he live a widow? Nay, he
will embrace both Us the little young sister, and the elder sister The church
of the Jews, and there will yet be a day of it; and therefore we have cause to
rejoice, yea to sing and shout for joy. The Church has been ^nce the world
began, ever hanging by a small thread, and all the hands of hell and of the
wicked have been drawing at the thread, but God be thanked they only break
their arms by pulling, but the thread is not broken, for the sweet fingers of
Christ our Lord have spun and twisted it: Lord hold the thread whole! Madam,
stir up your husband to lay hold upon the Covenant, and to do good: What has
he to do with the World? It is not his inheritance: Desire him to make him
home over, and put to his hand to lay one stone or two upon the wall of God's
house before he go hence. I have heard also, Madam, that your child is
removed: But to have or want is best as he pleases: Whether she be with you or
in God's keeping, think it all one; nay think it the better of the two by far,
that she is with him. I trust in our Lord that there is something laid up and
kept for you; for our kind Lord who has wounded you, will not be so cruel as
not to allay the pain of your green wound; and therefore claim Christ still as
your own, and own him as your One thing. So resting I recommend your La: your
soul and spirit in pawn to him who keeps all his father's pawnes, and will
make an account of them faithfully, even to that fairest amongst the sons of
men, our sweet Lord Jesus, the fairest, the sweetest, the most delicious rose
in all his father's great field: The smell of that rose perfume your soul.

Anwoth. April. 1. 1633. Your La: in his sweetest Lord Jesus, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (17)
MADAM.
I Determined and was desirous also to have seen your La: but because of a pain
in my arm I could not: I know ye will not impute it to any unsuitable
forgetfulness of your La: from whom at my first entry to my calling in this
country, and since also, I received such comfort in my affliction, as I trust
in God, never to forget it, and shall labor by his grace to recompense it the
only way possible to me, and that is, by presenting your soul, person, house
and all your necessities, in prayer, to him (whose I hope ye are, and) who is
able to keep you till that day of appearance, and to present you before his
face with joy. I am confident your La: is going forward in the begun journey to
your Lord and father's home and Kingdom; howbeit ye want not temptations within
and without: And who among the saints has ever taken that castle without
stroke of sword? The chief of the house, our elder brother our Lord Jesus, not
being excepted, who won his own house and home, due to him by birth, with much
blood and many blows. Your La: has the more need to look to your self,
because our Lord has placed you higher then the rest, and your way to heaven
lies through a more wild and waste wilderness then the way of many of your
fellow-travellers, not only through the midst of this wood of thorns The
cumbersom world, but also through these dangerous paths The vain glory of it:
The consideration whereof has often moved me to pity your soul, and the soul
of your worthy and noble husband: And it is more to you to win heaven, being
ships of greater burden, and in the main sea, then for little vessels that are
not so much in the mercy and reverence of the storms, because they may come
quietly to their port by lanching along the coast: For the which cause ye do
much, if in the midst of such a tumult of business, and crowd of temptations,
ye shall give Christ Jesus his own court and his own due place in your soul. I
know and am persuaded that, that lovely one Jesus is dearer to you then many
Kingdom, and that ye esteem him your welbeloved and the standard bearer among
ten thousand Cant. 5, 10, And it becomes him full well to take the place and
the board-head in your soul, before all the world: I knew, and saw him with you
in the furnace of affliction; for there he wooed you to himself, and chose you
to be his, and now he craveth no other hire of you but your Love, and that he
get no cause to be jealous of you: And therefore, Dear and Worthy Lady, be like
to the fresh river, that keeps it is own fresh taste in the salt sea. This
world is not worthy of your soul: Give it not a good-day when Christ comes in
competition with it. Be like one of another country: Home and stay not; for
the sun is fallen low, and nigh the tops of the mountains, and the shadows are
stretched out in great length: linger not by the way: The world and sin would
train you on and make you turn aside: Leave not the way for them, and the Lord
Jesus be at the voyage! Madam, many eyes are upon you, and many would be glad
your La: should spill a Christian, and man a good professor: Lord Jesus mar
their godless desires, and keep the conscience whole without a crack! If there
be a hole in it, so that it take in water at a leck, it will with difficulty
mend again: It is a dainty delicate creature, and a rare piece of the
workmanship of your maker; and therefore deal gently with it, and keep it
entire, that amid^^ this world's glory, your La: may learn to entertain Christ,
and whatsoever creature your La: finds not to smell of him, it may have no
better relish to you then the white of an egg. Madam, it is a part of the
truth of your profession, to drop words in the ears of your Noble husband
continually, of Eternity, Judgment, Death, Hell, Heaven, The honorable
Profession, The sins of his Father's House: He must reckon with God for his
father's debt: Forgetting of accounts pays not debt: Nay, the interest of a
forgotten bond runs up with God to interest upon interest: I know he looks
homeward and loves the truth; but I pity him with my soul, because of his many

a pack-horse of men's souls, when they are wholly set upon this world: We ow the
Devil no such service; It were wisdom to throw off that load into a mire, and
to cast all our cares over upon God. Madam, think ye have no child: Subscribe

HAving received a letter from some of the worthiest of the Ministry in this
Kingdom, the contents where of I am ^^nred to communicate to such professors
in these parts as I know love the beauty of Zion, and are afflicted to see the
Lord's vineyard froden under foot by the wild boars out of the wood, who lay
it waste; I could not but also desire your La: help, to join with the rest,
desiring you to impart it to my Lord your husband, and if ye think it needful,
I shall write to his Lo: as Mr G. G. shall advertise me. Know therefore that
the best affected of the Ministry have thought it convenient and necessary at
such a time as this, that all who love the truth should join their prayers
together, and cry to God with humiliation and fasting: The times which are
agreed upon, are, the two first sabbaths of February next, and the six days
interveening betwixt these sabbaths, as they may conveniently be had, and the
first sabbath of every Quarter: And the Causes, as they are written to me, are
these. 1. Besides the distresses of the Reformed Churches abroad, the many
reigning sins of uncleanness, ungodliness and unrighteousness in this land, the
present judgments on the land, and many more hanging over us, whereof few are
sensible, or yet know the right and true cause of them. 2. The lamentable and
pitiful estate of a glorious Church [in so short a time, against so many
bonds] in Doctrine, Sacraments and Discipline, so sore persecuted, in the
persons of faithful Pastors and professors, and the door of God's house kept
so strait, by Bastard-Porters, in so much, that worthy instruments, able for
the work, are held at the door, the Rulers having turned over Religion into
Policy, and the Multitude ready to receive any Religion that shall be enjoined
by Authority. 3. In our Humiliation, besides that we are under a necessity of
deprecating God's wrath, and vowing to God sincerely new obedience, the
weakness, coldness, silence and luke warmness of some of the best of the
Ministry, and the deadness of Professors, who have suffered the truth both
secretly to be stolen away and openly to be plucked from us, would be confessed.
4. Atheism, Idolatry, profanity and vanity would be confessed: Our King's heart
recommended to God, and God entreated that he would stir up the Nobles and the
People to turn from their evil waves. Thus, Madam, hoping that your La: will
join with others, that such a work be not slighted at such a necessary time,
when our Kirk is at the overturning: I will promise to my self your help, as
the Lord in secrecy and prudence shall enable you, that your La: may rejoice
with the Lord's people when deliverance shall come; for true and sincere
humiliation came always speed with God: And when Authority, King, Court and
Churchmen oppose the truth, what other armor have we but prayer and faith?
Whereby if we wrestle with him, there is ground to hope that these who would
remove the burdensome stone out of it is place shall but hurt their back, and the
stone shall not be moved, at least not removed, Zech: 12: 3. Grace, grace be
with you, from him who has called you to the inheritance of the saints in
light.

Jesus, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (19)
MADAM.
ALl submissive and dutiful obedience in our Lord Jesus remembered: I trust I
need not much entreat your La: to look to him who has stricken you at this
time, but my duty in the memory of that comfort I found in your La: kindness,
when I was no less heavy in a case not unlike that, speaks to me, to say
something now: and I wish I could ease your La: at least with words. I am
persuaded your Physician will not slay you, but purge you: and seeing he
calls himself the Chirurgian who makes the wound and binds it up again,
[for to lance a wound is not to kill, but cure the patient] Deuteronomy. 32. 30. 1 Samuel 2: 6. Job 6: v. 18. Hos. 6. 1. I believe, Faith will teach you to kiss a
striking Lord, and so acknowledge the sovereignty of God [in the death of a
childe] to be above the power of us mortal men, who may pluck up a flower in
the bud and not be blamed for it: If our dear Lord pluck up one of his Roses,
and pull down sour and green fruit before harvest, who can challenge him? For
he sends us to his world as men to a market, wherein some stay many hours,
and eat and drink, and buy and sell, and pass through the fair, till they be
weary, and such are these who live long and get a hearty fill of this life: And
others again come slipping in to the morning-market, and do neither sit nor
stand, nor buy nor sell, but look about them a little and pass presently home
again, and these are infants and young ones, who end their short market in the
morning, and get but a short view of the fair: Our Lord, who has numbered
man's months and set him bounds that he cannot pass, Job. 14, 5. has written
the length of our market, and it is easier to complain of the decree then to
change it. I verily believe when I write this, your Lord has taught your La:
to lay your hand on your mouth: But I shall be far from desiring your La: or
any others to cast by a cross, like an old useless bill that is only for the
fire, but rather would wish, each cross were looked in the face seven times,
and were read over and over again: It is the Messenger of the Lord, and speaks
something, and the man of understanding will hear the rod and him that has
appointed it: Try what is the taste of the Lord's cup, and drink with God's
blessing, that ye may grow thereby. I trust in God, whatever other speech it
utter to your soul, this is one word in it, Job. 5. 17. Behold, blessed is the
man whom God corrects: And that it says to you, Ye are from home while here,
ye are not of this world, as your Redeemer, Christ, was not of this world:
There is something keeping for you, which is worth the having: All that is here
is condemned to die, to pass away like a snow-ball before a summer-sun: and
since Death took first possession of something of yours, it has been and daily
is creeping nearer and nearer to your self, howbeit with no noise of feet. Your
husbandman and Lord has lopped off some branches already, the tree it self is
to be transplanted to the high harden; in a good time be it, our Lord ripen
your La: all these crosses [and indeed when I remember them, they are heavy and
many: peace, peace be the end of them] are to make you white and ripe for the
Lord's harvest-hook. I have seen the Lord weaning you from the breasts of this
world: it was never his mind it, should be your patrimony, and God be thanked
for that, ye look the liker one of the heirs: let the movables go, why not?
They are not yours: fasten your grips upon the heritage; and our Lord Jesus
make the charters sure, and give your La: to grow as a palm tree on God's mount
Zion, howbeit shaken with winds, yet the root is fast. This is all I can do,
to recommend your case to your Lord, who has you written upon the palms of his
hand: if I were able to do more, your La: may believe me, that gladly I would.
I trust shortly to see your La: Now he who has called you, confirm and
stablish your heart in grace unto the day of the liberty of the sons of God.

Lord Jesus, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (20)
My very Noble and worthy Lady.
SO often as I call to mind the comforts that I my self, a poor friendless
stranger, received from your La: here in a strange part of the country, when
my Lord took from me the delight of mine eyes, as the word speaks, Ezekiel. 24.
16. [which wound is not yet fully healed and cured] I trust your Lord shall
remember that and give you comfort now at such a time as this, wherein your
dearest Lord has made you a widow that ye may be a free Woman for Christ who
is now suteing for marriage-love of you; and therefore since you lie alone in
your bed, let Christ be as a bundle of myrrh to sleep and lie all the night
betwixt your breasts, Cant. 1, 13. and then your bed is better filled then
before: And seeing amongst all crosses spoken of in our Lord's word, this
gives you a particular right to make God your husband, [which was not so yours
while your husband was alive] read God's mercy out of this visitation: And
albeit I must out of some experience say, the mourning for the husband of your
youth, be, by God's own mouth the heaviest wordly sorrow, Joel 1. 8. and though
this be the weightiest burden that ever lay upon your back; Yet ye know [when
the fields are e^ptied and your husband now asleep in the Lord] if ye shall
wait upon him who hides his face for a while, that it lies upon God's honor
and truth to full the field and to be a husband to the widow: See and consider
then what ye have lost and how little it is. Therefore, Madam, let me entreat
you in the bowels of Christ Jesus and by the comforts of his Spirit and your
appearance before him, let God and men and Angels now see what is in you: The
Lord has p^irced the vessel, it will be known whether there be in it wine or
water: let your faith and patience be seen, that it may be known, your only
beloved first and last has been Christ: And therefore now were your whole love
upon him, he alone is a suitable object for your love and all the affections of
your soul: God has dried up one channel of your love by the removal of your
husband, let now that speat run upon Christ. Your Lord and lover has
graciously taken out your husband's name and your name out of the summonds that
are raised at the instance of the terrible sin-revenging Judge of the world
against the house of the Kenmure: And I dare say that God's hammering of you
from your youth is only to make you a fair carved stone in the high upper
temple of the new Jerusalem: Your Lord never thought this world's vain painted
glory a gift worthy of you; and therefore would not bestow it on you, because
he is to propine you with a better portion: Let the movables go, the
inheritance is yours: Ye are a child of the house and joy is laid up for you,
it is long in coming, but not the worse for that. I am now expecting to see,
and that with joy and comfort, that which I hoped of you since I knew you
fully, even that ye have laid such strength upon the Holy One of Israel that
yed ^sie troubles, and that your soul is a castle that may be be^^^ged but
cannot be taken. What have ye to do here? This would never looked like a
friend upon you, ye ow it little love, it looked ever sowre-like upon you:
Howbeit ye should woo it, it will not match with you; and therefore never seek
warm fire under cold ice: This is not a field where your happiness grows, it
is up above, where, Rev. 7. 9. there are a great multitude, which no man can
number, of all nations, and Kindreds, and people, and tongues standing before
the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with w^^te robes, and palms in their
hands: What ye could never get here, ye shall find there. And withal consider
how in all these trials [and truly they have been many] your Lord has been
loosing you at the root from perishing things, and hunting after you, to grip
your soul: Madam for the Son of God's sake, let him not miss his grip, but stay
and abide in the love of God, as Jude says, ver: 21 Now, Madam. I hope your
La: will take these lines in good part, and wherein I have fallen short and
failed to your La: in not evidencing what I was obliged to your more then
undeserved love and respect, I request for a full pardon for it. Again, my dear
and noble Lady, let me beseech you to list up your head, for the day of your
redemption draws near: And remember, that star that shined in Galloway is now
shining in another world. Now I pray that God may answer his own style to your
soul, and that he may be to you the God of all consolations. Thus I remain.

Anwoth. Sept. 14. 1634. Your La: at all dutiful obedience in the Lord, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (21)
MADAM.
ALl dutiful obedience in our Lord remembered. I know ye are now near one of
these strairs in which ye have been before: But because your outward comforts
are fewer, I pray him whose ye are, to supply what ye want, an other way: for
howbeit we cannot win to the bottom of his wise Providence who rules all: yet
it is certain, this is not only good which the Almighty has done, but it is
best: and he has reckoned all your steps to heaven, and if your La: were
through this water, there are the fewer behind; and if this were the last, I
hope your La: has learned by on-waiting to make your acquaintance with Death,
which being to the Lord, the woman's seed Jesus, only a bloody heel and not a
broken head, Genesis 3: 15. cannot be ill to his friends, who get f^r less of
Death then himself: Therefore, Madam, seeing ye know not but the journey is
ended and ye are come to the waterside, in God's wisdom look all your papers
and your counts, and whether ye be ready to receive the Kingdom of heaven as a
little child, in whom there is little haughtiness and much humility. I would
be far from discouraging your La: but there is an absolute necessity, that near
eternity, we look ere we leap, seeing no man wins back again to mend his
leap. I am confident your La: thinks often upon it, and that your old guide
shall go before you and take your hands His love to you will not grow sour
nor wear out of date, as the love of men, which grows old and gray haired
often before themselves. Ye have so much the more reason to love a better life
then this, because this world has been to you a cold fire, with little heat to
the body and as little light, and much smoke to hurt the eyes: But, Madam, your
Lord would have you thinking it but day breasts, full of wind and empty of
food. In this late visitation that has befallen your La ^e have seen God's
love and care in such a measure, that I thought, our Lord brake the sharp point
off the cross, and made us and your La: see Christ take possession, and
infestment upon earth of him who is now reigning and triumphing with the
hundred forty and four thousand, who stand with the Lamb on mount Zion. I know,
the sweetest of it, is bitter to you; but your Lord will not give you painted
crosses: He paireth not all the bitterness from the cross, neither takes he
the sharp ^dge quite from it, then it should be of your wailing and not of his,
which should have as little reason in it, as it should have profit for us.
Only, Madam, God commands you now to believe and cast anchor in the dark
night, and climb up the mountain: He who has called you, establish you and
confirm you to the end. I had a purpose to have visited your La: but when I
thought better upon it, the truth is, I cannot see what my company could profit
you: and this has broken off my purpose, and no other thing. yknow many
honorable friends and worthy professors will see I our La: and that the Son
of God is with you, to whose love and mercy, from my soul, I recommend your La:
and remain

MADAM.
MY humble obedience in the Lord remembered: Know, it has pleased the Lord to
let me see, by all appearance, my labors in God's house here are at an end,
and I (...) now learn to suffer, in the which I am a dull Scholar. By a strange
Providence, some of my papers anent the corruptions of this time, are come to
our King's hand: I know, by the wise and well affected, I shall be censured as
not wise nor circumspect enough, but it is ordinary, that, that should be a
part of the cross of these who suffer for him: Yet I love and pardon the
instrument, I would commit my life to him, howbeit by him this has befallen
me; but I look higher then to him. I make no question of your La: love and car
to do what ye can for my help, and am persuaded that in my adversities our La:
will with me well. I seek no other thing, but that my Lord may be honored by
me in giving a ^ony: I was wi^ling to do him more service, but seeing he will
have no more of my labors and this land will thrust me out, I pray for grace
to learn to be acquaint with misery, i^^ may give so rough a name to such a
mark of these who shall be crowned with Christ: And howbeit I will possibly
prove a faint-hearted unwise man in that, yet I dare say, I intend otherwise:
And I desire not to go on the lee-side or sunny-side of Religion, to put Truth
betwixt me and a storm; my Savior did not so for me, who in his suffering took
the windy side of the hill. No further, but the Son of God be with you.

To my Lady KENMURE. (23.)
MADAM.
I Received your La; letter from I. G. I thank our Lord, ye are as well, at
least as one may be, who is not come home: it is a mercy in this stormy sea to
get a second wind, for none of the saints get a first, but they must take the
winds as the Lord of the seas causes them to blow, and the Inn as the Lord
and Master of the Innes has ordered it: if contentment were here, heaven were
not heaven: Who ever seek the world to be their bed, shall at best find it
short and ill made, and a stone under their side to hold them waking rather
then a soft pillow to sleep upon: Ye ought to bless your Lord that it is not
worse: we live in a sea where many have suffered ship wrack, and have need that
Christ sit at the helm of the ship: it is a mercy to win to heaven, though with
much hard toil and heavy labor, and to take it by violence ill and well as it
may be: better go swimming and wet through our waters, then drown by the way;
especially now when Truth suffers, and great men bid Christ sit lower and
contract himself in less bounds, as if he took too much room. I expect our new
Prelate shall try my sitting: I hang by a thread, but it is (if I may speak so]
of Christ's spinning, there is no quarrel more honest or honorable, then to
suffer for truth: but the worst is, that this Kirk is like to sink, and all her
lovers and friends stand afar off, none mourn with her and none mourn for her.
But the Lord Jesus will not be put out of his conquest so soon in Scotland; it
will be seen, the Kirk and Truth will rise again within three days, and Christ
again shall ride upon his white horse, howbeit his horse seem now to stumble,
yet he cannot fall: the fullness of Christ's harvest in the end of the earth is
not yet come in. I speak not this because I would have it so, but upon better
grounds then my naked liking: but enough of this sad subject. I long to be
fully assured of your La: welfare and that your soul prospers, especially now
in your solitary life, when your comforts outward are few, and when Christ has
you for the very uptaking. I know, his love to you is still running over, and
his love has not so bad a memory as to forget you, and your dear child, who
has two fathers in heaven, the one the Ancient of days: I trust in his mercy,
he has something laid up for him above, however it may go with him here, I
know it is long since your La: saw this world turned your stepmother and did
forsake you. Madam, ye have reason to take in good part a lean dinner and spare
diet in this life, seeing your large supper of the Lamb's preparing will
recompense all. let it go, which was never yours, but only in sight, not in
property: the time of your loan will wear shorter and shorter, and time is
measured to you by ounce-weights: and then I know, your hope shall be a full
ear of corn and not blasted with wind: it may be your joy, that your anchor is
up within the vail, and that the ground it is cast upon, is not false but firm.
God has done his part, I hope ye will not deny to fish and fetch home all your
love to himself, and it is but too narrow and short for him, if it were more:
if ye were before pouring all your love [if it had been many gallons more] in
upon your Lord, if drops fell by in the in-pouring, he forgiveth you: he has
done now all that can be done, to win beyond it all, and has left little to
woo your love from himself, except one only child: what is his purpose
herein, he knows best, who has taken your soul in tutouring: Your faith may
be boldly charitable of Christ, that however matters go, the worst shall be a
tired traveller, and a joyful and sweet welcome-home: the back of your
winter-night is broken: Look to the East, the day sky is breaking: think not
that Christ loses time or lingereth unsutably. O fair, fair, and sweet
morning! We are but here as sea-passengers, if we look right, we are upon our
countrey-coast, our Redeemer is fast coming to take this old worm-eaten world,
like an old moth-eaten garment, in his two hands, and to roll it up and lay it
by him. These are the last days, and an oath is given, Rev. 10. by God
himself, that Time shall be no more: and when Time it self is old and
gray-haired, it were good we were away. Thus, Madam, ye see I am, as my custom
is, tedious in my lines: your La: will pardon it. The Lord Jesus be with your
spirit.

I Cannot find time for writing some things I intended on Job, I have been so
taken up with the broils that we are incumbered with in our calling: for our
Prelat will have us either to swallow our light over and digest it contrary to
our stomachs, howbeit we should vomit our conscience and all, in this
troublesome Conformity; or then he will try if Deprivation can convert us to the
Ceremonial faith. I write to your La: Madam, not as distrusting your affection
or willingness to help me, as your La: is able by your self or others, but to
advertise you, that I hang by a small thread: for our learned Prelat, because
we cannot see with his eyes, so far in a mil-stone as his light does, will not
follow his Master, meek Jesus, who waits upon the wearied and short-breathed
in the way to heaven: and where all see not alike and some are weaker, he
carries the lambs in his bosom, and leads gently these that are with young.
But we must either see all the evil of Ceremonies to be but as indifferent
strawes, or suffer no loss then to be easten our of the Lord's inheritance.
Madam, if I had time, I would write more at length, but your La: will pardon me
till a fitter occasion. Grace be with you and your child, and bear you company
to your best home.

Much honored Sir.
I Have heard of the mind and malice of your adversaries against you: It Is
like they will extend the law they have, in length and breadth answerable to
their heat of mind; but it is a great part of your glory that the cause is not
yours, but your Lord's whom ye serve, and I doubt not but Christ will count it
his honor to back his weak servant, and it were a shame for him (with
reverence to his holy Name) that he should suffer himself to be in the common
of such a poor man as ye are, and that ye should give out for him and not get
in again: Write up your depursments for your Master Christ, and keep the count
what ye give out, whether name, credit, goods, or life, and suspend your
reckoning till nigh the evening, and remember that a poor weak servant of
Christ wrote it to you, ye shall have Christ, a King, caution for your incomes
and all your losses: Reckon not from the fore-noon: Take the word of God for
your warrant, and for Christ's act of cautionry; howbeit body, life and goods
go for Christ your Lord, and though ye should lose the head for him; yet Luk
21. 18. There shall not one hair of your head perish. ver. 19. in patience
therefore possess your soul: and because ye are the first man in Galloway
called out and questioned for the name of Jesus, his eye has been upon you as
upon one whom he has designed to be among his witnesses: Christ has said,
Alexander Gordon shall lead the ring in witnessing a good confession; and
therefore he has put the garland of suffering for himself first upon your
head: think your self so much the more obliged to him, and fear not; for he
lays his right hand on your head: He who was dead and is alive will plead
your cause, and will look attentively upon the process from the beginning to
the end, and the Spirit of glory shall rest upon you. Rev. 2: 10. Fear none of
these things which thou shall suffer, behold the Devil shall cast some ^f you
into prison that ye may be tried, and ye shall have tribu^^tion ten days: Be
thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the crown of life: That
lovely one esus, who also became the Son of man that he might take strokes for
you, write the cross-sweetning and soul-supporting sense of these words in your
heart: These rumbling wheels ^f Scotland's ten days tribulation are under his
look who has seven eyes: Take a house on your head, and slip your self by
faith in under Christ's wings, till the storm be over: And remember when they
have drunken us down, Jerusalem will be a Cup of trembling and of poison, Zech.
12: 2. They shall be fain to vomit out the saints; for Judah, v. 6. Shall be a
hearth of ^ire in a sheaf, and they shall devour all the people round about, on
the right band and on the ^ft. Woe to Zion's enemies; they have the worst or
it; for we have write for the victory. Sir, ye were never honorable till now:
this is your glory that Christ has put you in the roll with himself, and the
rest of the witnesses, who are come out of great tribulation, and have washen
their garments and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. Be not cast down
for what the servants of Antichrist cast in your t^eth, that Year ahead to,
and favourer of the Puritanes, and leader to th^^ ^^ct, if your conscience say,
Alas, here is much din and little done [is the proverb is] because ye have not
done so much service to Christ that way as ye might and should: Take courage
from that same temptation; for ^our Lord Christ looks ^po^ that very
challenge as an hungring desire in you to have done more then ye did, and that
fills up the blank, and he will accept of what ye have done in that kind. If
great men be kind to you, I pray you overlook them; if they smile on you,
Christ but borrows their face to smile through them upon his afflicted
servant: know the wellhead, and for all that, learn the way to the well it
self. Thank God that Christ came to your house in your absence and took with
him some of your children: He presumed that much on your love, that ye would
not offend; and howbeit he should take the rest, he cannot come upon your wrong
side: I question not, if they were children of gold, but ye think them well
bestowed upon him: Expound well two rods on you, one in your house at home,
another on your own person abroad: Love thinks no evil: If ve were not
Christ's wheat appointed to be bread in his house, he would not grind you thus:
But keep the middle line, neither despise nor faint. Hebr 12. 6. Ye see your
father is homely with you: Strokes of a father evidence kindness and care, take
them so: I hope your Lord has manif^sted himself to you and suggested these or
more choice thoughts about his dealing with you: we are using our weak moyen
and credit for you, up at our own court; as we dow we pray the King to hear us,
and the Son of man to go side for side with you, and hand in hand in the fiery
oven, and to quicken and encourage your unbeleeving heart when ye droop and
despond. Sir, to the honor of Christ be it said, my faith goes with my pen
now, I am presently believing Christ shall bring you out, Truth in Scotland
shall keep the crown of the causey yet: the saints shall see Religion go naked
at noonday free from shame and fear of men: We shall yet divide Sechem and ride
upon the high places of Jacob. Remember my obliged respects and love to my lady
Kenmure and her sweet child.

MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I know ye are near many comforters and that
the promised comforter is near hand also: yet because I found your La:
comfortable to my self in my sad days that are not yet over my head, it is my
part and more in many respects [howbeit I can do little, God knows, in that
kinde] to speak to you in your wilderness-lot. I know, Dear and Noble Lady,
this loss of your dear child came upon you, one piece and part of it after
another, and that ye was looking for it, and that now the Almighty has brought
on you that which ye feared, and that your Lord gave you lawful warning, and I
hope for his sake who brewed and masked this cup in heaven, ye will gladly
drink, and salute and welcome the cross. I am sure, it is not your Lord's mind
to f^ed you with judgment and worm wood, and to give you waters of gall to
drink, Ezekiel. 34. 16. Ier. 9. 15. I know your cup is sugared with mercy, and
that the withering of the bloom, the flower, even the white and red of worldly
joys, is for no other end, but to buy out at the ground the reversion of your
heart and love. Madam, subscribe the Almightie's will, put your hand to the
pen, and let the cross of your Lord Jesus have your submissive and resolute
AMEN. If ye ask and try whose this cross is? I dare say, it is not all your
own, the best half of it is Christ's; then your cross is no born bastard, but
lawfully begotten, It sprang not out of the dust, Job. 5. 6. if Christ and ye
be halvers of this suffering, and he say half mine, what should aile you? and I
am sure, I am here right upon the style of the word of God. Phil. 3. 10. The
fellowship of Christ's sufferings, Col. 1. 29. The remnant of the afflictions
of Christ. Heb. 11. 28. The reproach of Christ. It were but to shi^t the
comforts of God, to say, Christ had never such a cross as mine, he had never a
dead child, and so this is not his cross, neither can he in that meaning be
the owner of this cross: but I hope, Christ when he married you, married you
and all the crosses and wo^-hearts that follow you, and the word makes no
exception. Isa. 63. 9. In all their afflictions he was afflicted: Then Christ
bore the first stroke of this cross, it rebounded off him on upon you, and ye
got it at the second hand, and ye and he are halvers in it: And I shall believe
for my part, he minds to destill heaven out of this loss and all others the
like: for wisdom devised it, and love laid it on, and Christ owneth it as his
own, and puts your shoulder only beneath a piece of it: take it with joy as
no bastard cross, but as a vintation of God, well born; and spend the rest of
your appointed time till your change come in the work of believing; and let
faith, that never yet made a lie to you, speak for God's part of it, he will
not, he does not make you a sea or a whalefish, that he keeps you inward,
lob. 7. 12. It may be, ye think not many of the children of God in such a hard
case as your self, but what would ye think of some who would exchange
afflictions and give you to the boot; but I know, yours must be your own alone
and Christ's together. I confess it seemed strange to me, that your Lord should
have done that which seems to ding out the bottom of your comforts worldly;
but we see not to the ground of the Almightie's soveraignity, he goes by on
our right hand, and on our left hand, and we see him not: We see but pieces of
the broken links of the chain of his providence, and he coggeth the wheels of
his own providence that we see not. O let the former work his own clay in what
frame he pleases! Shall any teach the Almighty knowledge? If he pursue dry
stubble, who dare say, what do thou? do not wonder to see the Judge of the
world weave in one web, your mercies, and the judgments of the house of the
Kenmure: he can make one web of contraries. But my weak advice, with reverence
and correction, were for you, Dear and worthy Lady, to see how far
mortification goes on, and what scum the Lord's fire casts out of you. I
know ye see your knottiness, since our Lord whyteth and heweth and plaineth
you, and the glanceing of the furnace is to let you see, what scum or refuse ye
must want, and what froath is in nature, that must be boiled out, and taken off
in the fire of your trials. I do not say, heavier afflictions prophecy
heavier guiltiness; a cross is often but a false prophet in this kind: but I
am sure, our Lord would have the tin and the bastard metal in you, removed,
least the Lord say, the bellows are burnt, the lead is consumed in the fare,
the founder melts in vain. Ier. 6, 29, And I shall hope, that grief shall not
so far smother your light as not to practice this so necessary a duty to concur
with him in this blessed design. I would gladly plead for the comforter's part
of it, not against you, Madam, [for I am sure ye are not his party] but against
your grief, which will have it is own violent incursions in your soul, and I
think it be not in your power to help it; But I must say, there are comforts
allowed upon you, and therefore want them not: When ye have gotten a
running-over soul with joy now, that joy will never be missed out of the
infinite Ocean of delight which i^ not diminished by drinking at it, or drawing
out of it. It is a Christian art to Comfort your self in the Lord, to say, I
was obliged to render back again this child to the giver, and if I have had
four years loan of him, and Christ eternitie's possession of him, the Lord has
kept condition with me. If my Lord would not have him and me to tryst both in
one hour at death's door threshold together, it is his wisdom so to do, I am
satisfied, my tryst is suspended, not broken off, nor given up. Madam, I would
I could divide sorrow with you for your ease; But I am but a beholder, it is
easy to me to speak: The God of comfort speak to you, and allure you with his
feasts of love. My removal from my flock is so heavy to me, that it makes my
life a burden to me; I had never such a longing for death: The Lord help and
hold up sad clay. I fear ye sin in drawing Mr William Dalgleish from this
country, where the labourrers are few and the harvest great: Madam, desire my
Lord Argyle to see for provision to a Pastor for this poor people. Grace be
with you.

Kircudbright, October. 1. 1639. Your La: at all obedience in Christ, S. R.

To the persecuted Church in Ireland. (27)
Much honored, reverend and dearly beloved in our Lord.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you all: I know there are many in this Nation,
more able then I, to speak to the sufferers for, and witnesses of Jesus Christ;
yet pardon me to speak a little to you, who are called in question for the
Gospel once committed to you. I hope ye are not ignorant that if peace was left
to you in Christ's Testament, so the other half of the Testament was a legacy
of Christ's sufferings. Ioh. 16: 35. These things I have spoken that in me ye
might have peace, in the world ye shall have trouble. Because then ye are made
assignayes and he^^s to a life-rent of Christ's Cross, think that fiery trial
no strangething: For the Lord Jesus shall be no loser by purging the dross and
tin out of his Church in Ireland: his wine press is out squising out the dreg,
the scum, the froath and refuse of that Church. I had once the proof of the
sweet smell, and the honest and honorable peace, of that slandered thing, the
Cross, of our Lord Jesus: But though [Alas!] that these golden days that then
I had, be now in a great part gone; yet I dare say, that the issue and outgate
of your sufferings shall be the advantage, the golden reign and dominion of the
Gospel, and the high glory of the never-enough-praised Prince of the Kings of
the earth, and the changing of the brass of the Lord's temple among you into
gold and the iron into silver and the wood into brass, your officers shall yet
be peace, and your exactors righteousness, Isa. 60: v. 17, 18. Your old fallen
walls shall get a new name, and the gates of your Jerusalem, shall get a new
style; they shall call your walls, Salvation, and your gates, Praise. I know
that Deputy, Prelates, Papists, temporizing Lords and proud mockers of our Lord,
crucifiers of Christ for his coat, and all your enemies, have neither fingers
nor instruments of war to pick out one stone out of your wall, for each stone
of your wall is Salvation. I dare give you my royal and Princely Master's word
for it, that Ireland shall be a fair Bride to Jesus, and Christ shall build on
her a palace of silver, Cant. 8: 9. Therefore weep not, as if there were no
hope; fear not, put on strength, put on your beautiful garments, Isa. 52: 1.
Your foundation shall be saphires, Isa. 54: 11, 12. Your windows and gates
precious stones. Look over the water and behold and see who is on the dry land
waiting for your landing: Your deliverance is concluded, subscribed and sealed
in heaven: Your goods that are taken from you for Christ and his truth's sake,
are but arrested and laid in pawn and not taken away: There is much laid up
for you in his storehouse, whose the earth and the fullness thereof is: your
garments are spun, and your flocks are feeding in the fields, your bread is
laid up for you, your drink is browen, your gold and silver is at the bank, and
the interest goes on and grows, and yet I hear that your taskmasters do
robe and spoil you and fine you: your prisons [my brethren] have two keys, the
Deputy, Prelates and Officers keep but the iron keys of the prison wherein they
put you; but he that has created the smith has other keys in heaven,
therefore ye shall not die in the prison: other men's ploughs are laboring for
your bread, your enemies are gathering in your rents. He that is kissing his
Bride on this side of the sea in Scotland, is beating her beyond the sea in
Ireland, and feeding her with the bread of adversity and the water of
affliction, and yet he is the same Lord to both. Alas! I fear that Scotland be
undone and slain with this great mercy of Reformation, because there is not
here that life of Religion, answerable to the huge greatness of the work that
dazleth our eyes: For the Lord is rejoicing over us in this land as the
Bridegroom rejoices over the Bride, and the Lord has changed the name of
Scotland, they call us now no more Forsaken nor Desolate, but our land is
called Heph Zibah and Beislah, Isa. 62: 4, for the Lord delights in us, and
this land is married to himself: there is now an high way made through our
Zion; and it is called the way of holiness, the unclean shall not pass over it,
the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err in it: the wilderness does
rejoice and blossom as the rose: the ransomed of the Lord are returned back
unto Zion, with songs and everlasting joy up on their heads, Isa. 35. The
Canaanite is put out of our Lord's house, there is not a beast left to do hurt
[at least professedly) in all the holy mountain of the Lord: our Lord is fallen
to wrestle with his enemies, and has brought us out of Egypt: we have the
strength of an Unicorn. Numb. 23: 22. The Lord has eaten up the sons of Babel,
he has broken their bones and has pierced them through with his arrows: we
take them captives whose captives we were, and we rule over our oppressors,
Isa, 14: 2. It is not brick nor clay nor Babel's cursed timber and stones, that
is in our second temple: but our Princely King jesus is building his house all
palace-work and carved stones, it is the habitation of the Lord: We do welcome
Ireland and England to our Welbeloved: we invite you, O daughters of Jerusalem,
to come down to our Lord's garden and seek our Welbeloved with us, for his love
will suffice both you and us: we do send love letters over the sea, to request
you to come and to marry our King and to take part of our bed: and we trust our
Lord is fetching a blow upon the Beast and the scarlet-colored Whore, to the
end he may bring in his ancient widowwife, our dear Sister, the Church of the
Jews. O what a heavenly heaven were it to see them come in by this mean, and
suck the breasts of their little Sister, and renew their old love with their
first husband, Christ, our Lord! They are booked in God's word as a Bride
contracted upon Jesus: O for a sight in this, flesh of mine, of the prophesied
marriage between Christ and and them! The Kings of Tarshish and the Isles, must
bring presents to our Lord Jesus. Psalm. 72: 10. And Britain is one of the
chiefest Isles: Why then but we may believe that our Kings of this Island shall
come in and bring their glory to the new Jerusalem, wherein Christ shall dwell
in the latter days? It is our part to pray that the Kingdoms of the earth may
become Christ's. Now I exhort you in the Lord Jesus not to be dismayed nor
afraid for the two tails of these two smoking fire-bands, the fierce anger of
the Deputy with his Civil Power, and of the bastard Prelates with the Power of
the Beast, for they shall be cut off: They may well eat you and drink you, but
they shall be forced to vomit you out again alive. If two things were firmly
believed, sufferi^gs would have no weight: If the fellowship of Christ's
suffering were well known, who would not gladly take part with Jesus? For
Christ and we are halvers and joint owners of one and the same cross: and
therefore he that knew well what sufferings were, as he esteemed all things but
loss for Christ and did judge them but dung, so did he also judge of them that
he might know the fellowship of his sufferings. Philip. 3: 10. O how sweet a
sight is it, to see across betwixt Christ and us, to hear our Redeemer say at
every sigh and every blow, and every loss of a believer, half mine! So they are
called the sufferings of Christ, and the reproach of Christ, Col. 2: 24. Heb.
11: 26. As when two are partners and owners of a ship, the half of the gain and
half of the loss belongs to either of the two; so Christ in our sufferings is
half-gainer and half-loser with us: Yea, the heaviest end of the black tree of
the cross lies on your Lord, it falls first upon him, and it but reboundeth
off him upon you: The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon
me. Psalm. 69: 9. Your sufferings are your treasure, and are greater riches then
the treasures of Egypt, Heb, 11; 26. And if your cross come first through
Christ's fingers ere it come to you, it receives a fair luster from him, it
gets a taste and a relish of the King's spikenard and of heaven's perfume,
and the half of the gain, when Christ's ship full of gold comes home, shall be
yours: It is an augmenting of your treasure to be rich in sufferings, to be in
labors abundant, in stripes above measure, 2. Cor. 11: ver. 23. and to have
the sufferings of Christ abounding in you 2. Cor. 1: 5. is a part of heaven's
stock: Your goods are not lost which they have plucked from you, for your Lord
has them in keeping; they are but arrested and seized upon, he shall loose the
arrest: Ye shall be fed with the heritage of Jacob your father, for the mouth
of the Lord has spoken it, Isa. 38. 14. Till I shall be in the hall-floor of
the highest palace and get a a draught of glory out of Christ's hand above and
beyond Time and beyond Death, I will never it is like see fairer days, then I
saw under that blessed tree of my Lord's cross: His kisses then were King's
kisses, these kisses were sweet and soul-reviving, one of them at that time was
worth two and a half [if I may speak so] of Christ's week-dayes kisses. O
sweet, sweet for evermore, to see a rose of heaven growing in as ill ground as
hell, and to see Christ's love, his embracements, his dinners and suppers of
joy, peace, faith, goodness, long-suffering and patience, growing and springing
like the flowers of God's garden, out of such stony and cursed ground as the
hatred of the Prelates and the malice of their High Commission and the
Antichrist's bloody hand and heart! Is not here art and wisdom? is not here
heaven indented in hell [if I may say so] like a jewel set with skill in a ring
with the enamle of Christ's cross? The rubie and riches of glory that grows
up out of this cross, is beyond telling. Now the blackest and hottest wrath and
most fiery and all-devouring indignation of the Judge of men and Angels, shall
come upon them that deny our sweet Lord Jesus and put their hand to that oath
of wickedness now pressed: the Lord's coal at their heart shall burn them up
both root and branch: the estates of great men that have done so, if they do
not repent, shall consume away, and the ravens shall dwell in their houses, and
their glory shall be shame. O for the Lord's sake, keep fast by Christ, and
fear not man that shall die and wither as the grass: the Deputy's bloom shall
fall, and the Prelates shall cast their flower, and the East wind of the Lord,
of the Lord strong and mighty, shall blast and break them: therefore fear them
not, they are but idols that can neither do evil nor good. Walk not in the way
of these people that slander the footsteps of our royal and princely anointed
King Jesus, now riding upon his white horse in Scotland: let Jehovah be your
fear. That decree of Zion's deliverance, passed and sealed up before the
throne, is now ripe, and shall bring forth a child, even the ruin and fall of
the Irelats black Kingdom and the Antichrist's throne in these Kingdoms: the
Lord has begun and he shall make an end. Who did ever h^ar the like of this?
Before Scotland traveled, she brought forth, and before her pain came, she was
delivered of a manchilde. Isa. 66. 7. 8. And when all is done, suppose there
were no sweetness in our Lord's cross, yet it is sweet for his sake, for that
lovely one, Jesus Christ, whose Crown and Royal Supremacy is the question this
day in Great Britain betwixt us and our adversaries: and who would not think
him worthy of the suffering for? what is burning quick? what is drinking of our
own heart-blood? and what i^ a draught of melted lead, for his glory? less then
a drink of cold water to a thirsty man, if the right price and due value were
put on that worthy, worthy Prince Jesus. O who can weigh him! Ten thousand
thousand heavens would not be one scale, or the half of the scale of the
balance, to lay him in. O black Angels, in comparison of him! O dim and dark
and lightless Sun, in regard of that fair Sun of Righteousness! O feckless and
worthless heaven of heavens, when they stand beside my worthy and lofty and
high and excellent Welbeloved! O weak and infirm clay-Kings! O soft and feeble
mountains of brass, and weak created strength, in regard of our mighty and
strong Lord of armies! O foolish wisdom of men and Angels, when it is laid in
the balance beside that spotless substantial wisdom of the Father! If heaven
and earth and ten thousand heavens, even round about these heavens that now
are, were all in one garden of Paradise, decked with all the fairest roses,
flowers and trees that can come forth from the art of the Almighty himself; yet
set but our one flower that grows out of the root Iesse, beside that orchard
of pleasure, one look of him, one view, one taste, one smell of his sweet
Godhead would infinitely exceed and go beyond the smell, color, beauty and
loveliness of that Paradise. O to be with child of his love, and to be
suffocate [if that could be] with the smell of his sweetness, were a sweet fill
and lovely pain! O worthy, worthy loveliness! O less of the creatures and more
of thee! O open the passage of the well of love and glory on us, dry pits and
withered trees! O that jewel and flower of heaven! If our Beloved were not
mistaken by us and unknown to us, he would have no scarcity of wooers and
suitors, he would make heaven and earth both see that they cannot quench his
love, for his love is a sea: O to be a thousand fathoms deep in this sea of
love! He, He Himself is more excellent then heaven: for Heaven, as it comes
into the souls and spirits of the glorified, is but a creature, and He is
something, and a great something, more then a Creature. Oh what a life were it
to sit beside this well of love, and drink and sing, and sing and drink, and
then to have desires and soul-faculties stretched and extended out many
thousand fathoms in length and breadth, to take in seas and rivers of love! I
earnestly desire to recommend this love to you, that this love may cause you to
keep his commandments, and to keep clean fingers and make clean feet, that ye
may walk as the redeemed of the Lord. Woe, woe be to them that put on his name,
and shame this love of Christ with a loose and prophanelife: their feet,
tongue, and hands and eyes give a shameless lie to the holy Gospel which they
profess. I beseech you in the Lord, keep Christ and walk with him, let not his
fairness be spotted and stained by godless living. Oh who can find in their
heart to sin against love? And such a love as the glorified in heaven shall
delight to dive into and drink of for ever, for they are evermore drinking-in
love, and the cup is still at their head, and yet without loathing, for they
still drink and still desire to drink for ever and ever: is not this a long
lasting supper? Now if any of our countrey-people professing Christ Jesus, have
brought themselves under the stroke and wrath of the Almighty, by yielding to
Antichrist in an hair-breadth, but especially by swearing and subscribing that
blasphemous Oath (which is the Church of Ireland's black hour of temptation) I
would entreat them, by the mercies of God at their last summonds, to repent and
openly confess before the world, to the glory of the Lord, their denial of
Christ: Or otherwise, if either man or woman will stand and abide by that Oath,
then in the name and authority of the Lord Jesus, I let them see that they
forfeit their part of heaven, and let them look for no less then a back-burden
of the pure unmixed wrath of God and the plague of Apostates and deniers of our
Lord Jesus. Let not me a stranger to you, who never saw your face in the flesh,
be thought bold in writing to you: For the hope I have of a glorious Church in
that land, and the love of Christ constrains me. I know, the worthy servants
of Christ who once labored among you, cease not to write to you also, and I
shall desire to be excused that I do join with them. Pray for your Sister
Church in Scotland, and let me entreat you for the aid of your prayers for my
self and flock and ministry, and my fear of a transportation from this place
of of the Lord's vineyard. Now the very God of peace sanctify you throughout.
Grace be with you all.?

Anwoth. 1639. Your brother and companion in the Kingdom and patience of Jesus
Christ, S. R.

To his reverend and much honored Brother, Dr WILLIAM LIGHTON, Christ's
prisoner in bonds at London. (28)
Reverend and much honored prisoner of hope.
GRace, mercy, and peace be to you: It was not my part whom our Lord has
enlarged, to forget you his prisoner. When I consider how long your night has
been, I think Christ has a mind to put you in free grace's debt, so much the
deeper, as your sufferings have been of so long a continuance. But what if
Christ mind you no jo^ but public joy with enlarged and triumphing Zion: I
think, Sir, ye would love it best to share and divide your song of joy with
Zion, and to have mystical Christ in Eritain halfer and compartner with your
enlargement. I am sure, your joy bordering and neighboring with the joy of
Christ's Bride, would be so much the sweeter that it were public. I thought,
if Christ had halved my mercies, and delivered his Bride and not me, that his
praises should have been double to what they are: But now two rich mercies
conjoined in one have stolen from our Lord more then half-praises: Oh that mercy
should so beguile us, and steal away our counts and acknowledgements! Worthy
Sir, I hope I need not exhort you to go on, in hoping for the salvation of
God: There has not been so much taken from your time of ease and created
joys, as Eternity shall add to your heaven: Ye know when one day in heaven
has paved you, yea, and overpayed your blood, bonds, sorrow and sufferings,
that it would trouble Angels understanding to lay the count of that superplus
of glory, which Eternity can and will give you. O but your sand-glass of
sufferings and losses, comes to little, when it shall be counted and compared
with the glory that bideth you on the other side of the water! Ye have no
leisure to rejoice and fing here while time goes about you, and where your
Psalms will be short, therefore ye will think Eternity and the long day of
heaven that shall be measured with no other sun nor horologe then the long life
of the Ancient of days, to measure your praises, little enough for you: if
your spanlength of time be cloudy, ye cannot but think, your Lord can no more
take your blood and your band without the in-come and reeompence of free grace
h^e would take the sufferings of Paul and his other dear servants that were
well paid home beyond all counting, Romans 8: 18. If the wisdom of Christ has
made you Antichrist's eyesore and his envy, ye are to thank God that such a
piece of clay as ye are, is made the field of glory to work upon: it was the
potter's aim that the clay should praise him, and I hope it satisfies you that
your clay is for his glory. Oh who can suffer enough for such a Lord! and who
can lay out in bank enough of pain, shame, losses, tortures, to receive in
again the free interest of eternal glory? 2 Cor. 4: 17. O how advantageous a
bargaining is it with such a rich Lord! If your hand and pen had been at
leisure to gain glory in paper, it had been but paper-glory: but the bearing of
a public cross so long for the now controverted privileges of the crown and
scepter of free King Jesus, the Prince of the Kings of the earth, is glory
booked in heaven. Worthy and dear Erother, if ye go to weigh Jesus his
sweetness, excellency, glory and beauty, and say fore-against him your ounces
or drams of Suffering for him, ye shall be straightened two ways. 1. It will be a
pain to make the comparison, the disproportion being by no understanding
imaginable: nay, if heaven's Arithmetic and Angels were set to work, they
should never number the degrees of difference. 2. It should straiten you to
find a scale for the balance to lay that High and Lofty One, that
overtranscending Prince of excellency into: If your mind could fancy as many
created heavens as time has had minutes, trees have had leaves and clouds have
had rain drops, since the first stone of the creation was laid, they should not
make half a scale to bear and weight boundless excellency it to. And therefore
the King whose marks ye are bearing and whose dying ye carry about with you in
your body, is out of all cry and consideration beyond and above all our
thoughts. For my self, I am content to feed upon wondering sometimes at the
beholding but of the borders and skirts of the incomparable glory which is in
that exalted Prince: and I think ye could wi^h for more ears to give him then
ye have, since ye hope these ears ye now have give him, shall be passages to
take in the music of his glorious voice. I would fain both believe and pray
for a new Bride of Jews and Gentiles to our Lord Jesus, after the land of
graven images shall be laid waste; and that our Lord Jesus is on horseback
hunting and pursuing the beast, and that England and Ireland shall be well
sweeped chambers for Christ and his righteousness to dwell in: for he has
opened our graves in Scotland, and the two dead and buried witnesses are risen
again and are prophesying. O that Princes would glory and boast themselves in
carrying the train of Christ's tobe royal in their arms! Let me die within an
half-hour after I have seen the Son of God his temple enlarged, and the cords
of I^rusalem's tent lengthned, to take in a more numerous company for a Bride
to the Son of God. Oh if the corner or foundation-stone of that house, that new
house, were laid above my grave! O who can add to him, who is that great ALL:
If he would create suns and moons; new heavens, thousand thousand degrees more
perfect then these that now are, and again make a new creation ten thousand
thousand degrees in perfection beyond that new creation, and again still for
eternity multiply new heavens, they should never be a perfect resemblance of
that infinite excellency, order, weight, measure, beauty and sweetness that is
in him. O how little of him do we see! O how shallow are our thoughts of him!
Oh if I had p^in for him, and shame and losses for him and more clay and
spirits for him, and that I could go upon earth without love, desire, hope,
because Christ has taken away my love, desire and hope to heaven with him! I
know, Worthy Sir, your sufferings for him are your glory, and therefore weary
not, his salvation is near hand and shall not tarry. Pray for me: his grace be
with you.

St Andrews. Nov. 22. 1639. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S, R.

To Mr HENRY STUART, his Wife, and two Daughters, all Prisoners of Christ at
Dublin.
Rev. 2: 10. Fear none of these things, which ye shall suffer, etc. (29.)
Truly Honored and Dearly beloved.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you, from God our father and our Lord Jesus
Christ. Think it not strange, beloved in our Lord Jesus, that Satan can command
keys of prisons and bolts and chains; this is a piece of the Devil's Princedom
that he has over the world: interpret and understand our Lord well in this: be
not jealous of his love, though he make devils and men his under-servants to
scour the rust off your faith and purge you from your dross. And let me charge
you, O prisoners of hope, to open your window and to look out by faith, and
behold heavens post, that speedy and swift salvation of God, that is coming to
you; it is a broad river that faith will not look over; it is a mighty and a
broad sea that they of a lively hope cannot behold the furthest bank and other
shore thereof: Look over the water, your anchor is fixed within the vail, the
one end of the cable is about the prisoner of Christ, and the other is entered
within the vail, whither the forerunner is entered for you, Heb. 6: 19, 20. It
can go straight through the flames of the fire of the wrath of men, devils,
losses, tortures, death, and not a thread of it be either singed or burnt; men
and devils have no teeth to bite it in two: Hold fast till he come: Your cross
is of the color of heaven and Christ, and pasmented over with the faith and
comforts of the Lord's faithful Covenant with Scotland; and that die and color
will abide the foul weather, and neither be stained nor cast the color; yea it
reflects a scad like the cross of Christ, whose holy hands, many a day lifted
up to God praying for sinners, were fettered and bound, as if these blessed
hands had stolen and shed innocent blood: When your lovely, lovely Jesus had no
better then the thief's doom, it is no wonder that your process be lawless and
turned upside down; for he was taken, fettered, buffetted, whipped, spitted
upon, before he was convicted of any fault, or sentenced. Oh, such a pair of
sufferers and witnesses, as high and royal Jesus and a poor piece guilty clay
marrowed together, under one yoke! O how lovely is the cross with such a
second! I believe that your prison is enacted in God's court, not to keep you
till your hope breath out it is life and last: Your cross is under law to
restore you again safe to your brethren and sisters in Christ: take heaven and
Christ's back-bond for a fair backdoor out of your suffering. The Savior is
on his journey with salvation and deliverance for mount Zion and the sword of
the Lord is drunk with blood and made fat with fatness, his sword is bathed in
heaven against Babylon, for it is the day of the Lord's vengeance and the year
of recompenses for the comtroversie of Zion: And persuade your selves, the
streams of the rivers of Babylon shall be pitch, and the dust of the land
brimstone and burning pitch, Isa. 34: 8. And if your deliverance be conjoined
with the deliverance of Zion, it shall be two salvations to you. It were good
to be armed before hand for death or bodily tortures for Christ, and to think
what a crown of honor it is, that God has given you pieces of living clay to
be tortured witnesses for saving truth, and that ye are so happy as to have
some pints of blood to give out for the crown of that royal Lord, who has
caused you to avouch himself before men. If ye can lend fines of three thousand
pound sterling for Christ, let heaven's register and Christ's count-book keep
in reckoning your depursments for him: It shall be engraven and printed in
great letters upon heaven's throne, what you are willing to give for him:
Christ's papers of that kind cannot be lost or fall by. Do not wonder to see
clay boast the great potter, and to see blinced men to threaten the Gospel with
death and burial and to raze out Truth's name: but where will they make a grace
for the Gospel and the Lord's bride! Earth and hell shall be but little bounds
for their burial: lay all the clay and rubbish of this inch of the whole earth
above our Lord's spouse, yet it will not cover her nor hold her down; she shall
live and not die, she shall behold the salvation of God. Let your faith frist
God a little and be not afraid for a smoking firebrand: there is more smoke in
Babylon's furnace then there is fire: till doomsday shall come, they shall
never see the Kirk of Scotland and our Covenant burnt to ashes, or if it should
be thrown in tho fire, yet it cannot be so burnt or buried, as not to have a
resurrection: angry clay's wind shall shake none of Christ's corn; he will
gather in all his wheat into his barn: only let your fellowship with Christ be
renewed: ye are sibber to Christ now when you are imprisoned for him, then
before; for now the strokes laid on you, do come in remembrance before our
Lord, and he can own his own wounds: a drink of Christ's love, which is better
then wine, is the drink-silver which Suffering for his majesty leaves behind
it: it is not your sins which they persecute in you, but God's grace, and
loyalty to King Jesus: they see no treason in you to your Prince, the King of
Britain, albeit they say so, but it is heaven in your that earth is fighting
against, and Christ is owning his own cause: grace is a party that fire will
not burn, not water drown: when they have eaten and drunken you, their stomach
shall be sick, and they shall spue you out alive. O what glory is it to be
suffering abjects, for the Lord's glory and royalty! Nay, though his servants
had a body to burn for ever, for this Gospel, so being that triumphing and
exalted Jesus his high glory did rise out, of these flames and out of that
burning body, Oh, what a sweet fire! O what soul-refreshing torment should that
be! What if the pickles of dust and ashes of the burnt and dissolved body, were
musicians to sing his praises, and the highness of that never-enough-exalted
Prince of ages? O what love is it in him, that he will have such musicians as
we are to tune that Psalm of his everlasting praises in heaven! Oh what shining
and burning flames of love are these, that Christ will divide his share of
life, of heaven and glory with you. Luke 22. 29. Ioh. 17: 24. Rev. 3: 21. A
part of his throne, one draught of his wine (his wine of glory and life, that
comes from under the throne of God and of the Lamb) and one apple of the tree
of life will do more then make up all the expenses and charges of clay, lent
out for heaven. Oh! Oh but we have short and narrow and creeping thoughts of
Jesus, and do but shape Christ in our conceptions according to some created
portraiture! O Angels, lend in your help to make love-books and songs of our
fair and white and ruddy standard bearer amongst ten thousand! O heavens! O
heaven of heavens! O glorified tennants and triumphing house-holders with the
Lamb, put in new Psalms and love-sonnets of the excellency of our bridegroom
and help us to set him on high! O indwellers of earth and heaven, sea and air!
and O all ye created beings within the bosom of the outmost circle of this
great world! O come help to set on high the praises of our Lord! O fairness of
creatures, blush before his uncreated beauty! O created strength, be amazed to
stand before your strong Lord of hosts! O created love, think shame of thy self
before this unparalleled love of heaven! O angel-wisdom, hide thy self before
our Lord whose understanding passes finding out! O sun in thy shining beauty,
for shame put on a web of darkness and cover thy self before thy brightest
master and maker! O who can add glory by doing or suffering, to this
never-enough-admired and praised lover! Oh we can but bring our drop to this
sea, and our candle, dim and dark as it is, to this clear and lightsom sun of
heaven and earth! Oh but we have cause to drink ten deaths in one cup dry, to
swim through ten seas, to be at that land of praises, where we shall see that
wonder of wonders and enjoy this jewel of heavens jewels! O death, do thy
outmost against us! O torments! O malice of men and devils, waste thy-strength
on the witnesses of our Lord's testament! O devils, bring hell to help you in
tormenting the followers of the Lamb! we will defy you to make us too soon
happy, and to waft us too soon over the water to the land where the noble
plant, the plant of venown grows. O cruel Time, that torments us and suspends
our dearest enjoyments that we wait for, when we shall be bathed and steeped,
soul and body, down in the depths of this love of loves! O Time, I say, run
fast! O motions, mend your pace! O Welbeloved, be like a young Roe upon the
mountains of Separations! Post, post; and hasten our desired and hungered-for
meeting: love is sick to hear tell of to morrow. And what then can come wrong
to you, O honorable witnesses of his Kingly truth? Men have no more of you to
work upon, but some few inches and span-lengths of fick, coughing and
phlegmatic clay: your spirits are above their benches, courts, or High
Commissions: your souls, your love to Christ, your faith, cannot be summoned
not sentenced nor accused nor condemned by Pope, Deputy, Prelat, Ruler or
Tyrant: your faith is a free Lord, and cannot be a captive: all the malice of
hell and earth, can but hurt the scabbard of a believer: and death at the worst
can get but a clay-pawne in keeping till your Lord make the King's keys and
open your graves. Therefore upon luck's head [as we use to say] take your sill
of his love, and let a post way or a causey be laid betwixt your prison and
heaven, and go up and visit your treasure: Enjoy your Beloved and dwell upon
his love, till Eternity come in Time's room and possess you of your eternal
happiness: Keep your love to Christ, lay up your faith in heaven's keeping; and
follow the chief of the house of the Martyrs, that witnessed a fair confession
before Pontius Pilate; your cause and his is all one. The opposers of his cause
are like drunken Judges and transported, who in their cups would make Acts and
Laws in their drunken courts, that the Sun should not rise and shine on the
earth, and send their Officers and Pursevants to charge the Sun and Moon to
give no more light to the world, and would enact in their Court-bookes that the
Sea after once ebbing should never flow again: But would not the Sun and Moon
and Sea break these Acts and keeep their Creator's directions. The Devil, the
great fool and father of these under-fools, is older and more malicious then
wise, that sets the spirits in earth on work to contend and clash with heaven's
wisdom, and to give mandats and law summonds to our Sun, to our great Star of
heaven, Jesus, not to shine, in the beauty of his Gospel, to the chosen and
bought ones, O thou fair and fairest Sun of righteousness, arise and shine in
thy strength, whether earth and hell will or not! O Victorious! O Royal! O
stout Princely soul-conqueror, ride prosperously upon truth, stretch out thy
Scepter as far as the Sun shines and the Moon waxes and ^aineth! Put on thy
glistering crown, O thou maker of Kings! and make but one stride or one step of
the whole earth, and travel in the greatness of thy strength, Isa. 63: 1, 2.
and let thy apparel be red and all dyed with the blood of thy enemies: Thou art
fallen righteous heir by line to the Kingdoms of the world. Laugh ye at the
giddy-headed clay pots and stout brainsick worms, that dare say in good
earnest, this man shall not reign over us: as though they were casting the dice
for Christ's crown, who of them shall have it. I know, ye believe the coming of
Christ's Kingdom, and that their is a hole out of your prison through which ye
see daylight: let not faith be dazzled with the temptation from a dying Deputy
and from a sick Prelat: believe under a cloud, and wait for him, when there is
no moonlight nor starlight: Let faith live and breath and lay hold on the sure
salvation of God, when clouds and darkness are about you and appearance of
rotting in the prison, before you: take heed of unbeleeving hearts which can
father lies upon Christ: beware of, Does his promise fail for evermore? Psalm.
77. 8. For is was a man and not God that said it, who dreamed that a promise of
God could fail, fall a-swoon or die: we can make God sick or his promises weak,
when we are pleased to seek a plea with Christ. O sweet! O stout word of faith,
Job. 13. v. 15. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him. O sweet Epitaph
written on the gravestone of a dying believer! To wit, I died hoping, and my
dust and ashes beleevelife. Faith's eyes, that can see through a millstone, can
see through a gloom of God, and under it read God's thoughts of love and peace.
Hold fast Christ in the dark: surely ye shall see the savation of God. Your
adversaries are ripe and dry for the fire, yet a little while and they shall
go up in a flame: the breath of the Lord like a river of brimstone shall
kindle about them, Isa. 30: 33. What I write to one, I write to you all, that
are sound hearted in that Kingdom, whom in the bowels of Christ, I would exhort
not to touch that Oath; albeit the adversaries put a fair meaning on it, yet
the swearer must swear according to the professed intent and godless practice
of the oath-breakers, which is known to the world: otherwise I might swear that
the Creed is false, according to yet this private meaning and sense put upon
it. Oh let them not be beguiled to wash petjury and the denial of Christ and
the Gospel with ink-water, some foul and rotten distinctions: Wash and wash
again and again the devil and the lie, it shall be long ere their skin be
white. I profess, it should beseem men of great parts, rather then me, to write
to you; but I love your C^use, and desires to be excused, and must entreat for
the help of your prayers in this my weighty charge here for the University and
Pulpit, and that ye would entreat your acquaintance also to help me. Grace be
with you all. Amen.

St. Andrews. 1640. Your brother and companion in the patience and Kingdom of
Jesus Christ, S. R.

For Mistress PONT prisoner at Dublin. (30)
Worthy and dear Mistress.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you. The cause ye suffer for (...) your
willingness to suffer, is ground enough of acquaintance, for me to write to
you; although I do confess my self unable to speak for a prisoner of Christ's
encouragement. I know ye have advantage beyond us, who are not under suffering:
for your sighing [Psal. 102. 20.] is a witten bill, for the ears of your Head,
the Lord Jesus; and your breathing, Lam. 3. 51. and your looking up, Psalm. 5.
3. and 69. 3. And therefore your meaning half spoken, half unspoken, will seek
no jaylor's leave, but will go to heaven without leave of Prelat or Deputy,
and be heartily welcome: so that ye may sigh and gro^n out your mind to him who
has all the keys of the King's three Kingdoms and dominions: I dare believe
your hope shall not die; your trouble is a part of Zion's burning, and ye know
who guides Zion's furnance, and who loves the ashes of his burnt Bride, because
his servants love them, Psalm. 102. 14. I believe your ashes, if ye were burnt
for this cause, shall praise him: For the wrath of men and their malice shall
make a psalm to praise the Lord, Psalm. 76: 10. and therefore stand still and
behold and see what the Lord is to do for this Island; his work is perfect,
Deuteronomy. 32: 4. the nations have not seen the last end of his work; his end is
more fair and more glorious then the beginning. Ye have more honor then ye can
be able to guide well, in that your bonds are made heavy for such an honorable
cause. The seals of a controlled Gospel, and the seals by bonds and blood and
sufferings, are not committed to every ordinary professor. Some that would
back Christ honestly in summertime, would but spill the beauty of the Gospel,
if they were put to suffering. And therefore let us believe, that wisdom
dispenses to every one here as he thinks good who bears them up that bear the
cross: and since our Lord has put you to that part which was the flower of his
own sufferings, we all expect that as ye have in the strength of our Captain
begun, so ye will go on without fainting. Providence makes use of men and
devils for the refining of all the vessels of God's house, small and great, and
for doing of two works at once in you, both for smothing of a stone to make it
take bond with Christ in Ierusalem's wall, and for witnessing to the glory of
this reproached and born down Gospel, which cannot die though hell were made a
grave about it. It shall be timous joy for you to divide joy betwixt you and
Christ's laughing Bride, (...) these three Kingdoms: and what if your mourning
continue till mystical Christ in Ireland and in Britain and ye laugh both
together? your laughing and joy were the more blessed, that one sun should
shine upon Christ, the Gospel, and you, laughing altogether, in these three
Kingdoms. Your time is measured and your days and hours of suffering from
eternity were by infinite wisdom considered: If heaven recompense not to your
own mind inches of sorrow, then I must say that infinite mercy cannot get you
pleased: but if the first kiss of the white and ruddy cheek of the standard,
bearer and chief among ten thousand [Cant. 5: 10] shall over-pay your prison at
Dublin in Ireland, then ye shall have no counts unanswered, to give in to
Christ: if your faith cannot see a nearer term-day; yet let me charge your hope
to give Christ a new day till eternity and time meet in one point: a paid
sum, if ever paid, is paid, if no day be broken to the hungry creditour:
take heaven's bond and subscribed obligation for the sum, John 14. 3. If Hope
can trust Christ, I know he can, and will pay: but when all is done and
suffered by you, ten hundred deaths for lovely, lovely Jesus, is but
eternitie's half penny; figures and ciphers cannot lay the proportion. O but
the super-plus of Christ's glory is broad and large! Christ's Item's of eternal
glory are hard and cumbersom to tell, and ifye borrow by faith and hope ten
days or ten hundred years from that eternity of glory that abides you, ye are
paid and more in your own hand. Therefore, O prisoner of hope, wait on!
posting, hasting salvation sleeps not. Antichrist is bleeding and in the way to
death, and he bites forest when he bleeds fastest. Keep your intelligence
betwixt you and heaven, and your court with Christ: he has in heaven the keys
of your prison, and can set you at liberty when he pleases: His rich grace
support you. I pray you help me with your prayers. Grace be with you.

St Andrews 1640. Your brother in the patience and Kingdom of Jesus Christ, S.
R.

To Mr JAMES WILSON. (31)
Dear Brother
GRace, mercy and peace be multiplied upon you: I bless our rich and only wise
Lord, who cares so for his new creation, that he is going over it again and
trying every piece in you, and blowing away the motes of his new work in you.
Alas! I am not so fit a Physician as your disease requires: sweet, sweet,
lovely Jesus be your Physician, where his under-Chirurgians cannot do any
thing for putting in order the wheels, paces, and goings of a marred soul. I
have little time; but yet the Lord has made me so concern my self in your
condition that I dow not, I dare not be altogether silent. First, ye doubt
from. 2 Cor. 13: 5. whether ye be in Christ or not, and so whether ye be a
reprobate or not? I answer three things to the doubt. 1. Ye ow charity to all
men, but most of all, to lovely and loving Jesus, and some also to your self,
especial to your renewed self; because your new self is not yours but another
Lord's, even the work of his own Spirit: therefore to slander his work is to
wrong himself: Love thinks no evil: if ye love Grace, think not ill of Grace
in your self; and ye think ill of Grace in your self, when ye make it but a
bastard and a work of nature: for a holy fear that ye be not Christ's, and
withal a care and a desire to be his and not your own, is not, nay cannot be
bastard nature. The great Advocate pleads hard for you, be upon the
Advocate's side, O poor feared client of Christ! stay and side with such a
lover, who pleads for no other man's goods but his own [for he, if I may say
so, scorneth to be enriched with an unjust conquest] and yet he pleads for
you, whereof your letter [though too too full of jealousie] is a proof: for if
ye were not his, your thoughts, which I hope are but the suggestion of his
Spirit (that only brings the matter in debate to make it sure to you) would
not be such nor so serious as these, am I his? or whose am I? 2. Dare ye
forswear your owner, and say in cold blood, I am not his? what nature or
corruption says at starts in you, I regard not: your thoughts of your self,
when sin and guiltiness round you in the ear, and when ye have a sight of your
deservings, are Apocrypha and not Scripture, I hope. Hear what the Lord says
of you, he will speak peace: if your Master say, I quite you, I shall then bid
you eat ashes for bread and drink waters of gall and wormwood. But howbeit
Christ out of his own mouth should seem to say, I came not for thee, as he did
Matthew. 15: 24. yet let me say, The words of tempting Jesus are not to be
stretched as Scripture beyond his intention, seeing his intention in speaking
them is to strengthen, not to deceive: and therefore here Faith may contradict
what Christ seems at first to say, and so may ye. I charge you by the mercies
of God, be not that cruel to Grace and the new birth as to cast water on your
own coal by misbelief: If ye must die (as I know ye shall not) it were a folly
to slay your self. 3. I hope ye love the new birth and a claim to Christ,
howbeit ye dow not make it good: and if ye were in hell and saw the heavenly
face of lovely, ten thousand times lovely Jesus, that has God's hew and God's
fair, fair and comely red and white wherewith it is beautified beyond
comparison and imagination, ye could not forbear to say, Oh! if I could but
blow a kiss from my sinful mouth, from hell up to heayen upon his cheeks, that
are as a bed of spices as sweet flowers, Cant. 5: 13. I hope ye dare say, O
fairest sight of heaven! O boundless mass of crucified and slain love for me,
give me leave to wish to love thee! O flower and bloom of heaven and earth's
love! O Angels wonder! O thou the Father's eternally sealed love! and O thou
God's old delight! give me leave to stand beside thy love and look in and
wonder, and give me leave to wish to love thee, if I can do no more. 2. We
being born in atheism and bairns of the house that we are come off, it is no
new thing, my dear Brother, for us to be under jealousies and mistakes about
the love of God: what think ye of this that the man Christ was tempted to
believe there were but two Persons in the blessed Godhead, and that the Son of
God, the substantial, and coerernal Son, was not the lawful Son of God? Did
not Satan say, If thou be the Son of God? 3. Ye say that ye know not what to
do? Your Head said once that same word or not far from it, Ioh. 12. 27. Now is
my soul troubled, and what shall I say? and faith answered Christ's What shall
I say? with these words, O tempted Savior, ask thou What shall I say? say,
pray, Father save me from this hour. What course can ye take but pray and first
Christ his own comforts? He is no dyvour, take his word. Oh [say ye] I cannot
pray! Ans. Honest sighing is faith breathing and whispering him in the ear: the
life is not out of faith, where there is sighing, looking up with the eyes and
breathing toward God, Eam. 3: 36. Hide not thine ear at my breathing. But what
shall I do in spiritual exercises, say ye? Ans. 1. If ye knew particularly
what to do, it were not a spiritual exercise. 2. In my weak judgment, ye
would first say, I will lorifie God in believing David's Salvation and the
Bride's Marriage with the Lamb, and love the Church's stain husband, although I
cannot for the present believe mine own Salvation. 3. Say, I will not pass from
my claim, suppose Christ would pass from his claim to me, it shall not go back
upon my side; howbeit my love to him be not worth a drink of water, yet Christ
shall have it such as it is. 4. Say, I shall rather spill twenty prayers then
not pray at all; let my broken words go up to heaven: when they come up into
the great Angel's golden censer, that compassianat Advocate will put together
my broken prayers and perfume them: Words are but Accidents of Prayer. Oh [say
y] I am slain with hardness of heart; and troubled with confused and
melancholious thoughts? Ans. My dear Brother, What would ye conclude thence,
that ye know not well who ought you? I grant, Oh my heart is hard! Oh my
thoughts of faithless sorrow! Ergo, I know not who ought me; were good Logic
in heaven amongst Angels and the glorified: but down in Christ's Hospital,
where sick and distempered souls are under cure, it is not worth a straw. Give
Christ time to end his work in your heart: hold on in feeling and bewailing
your hardness, for that is softness to feel hardness. 2. I charge you to make
Psalms of Christ's praises for his begun work of Grace, make Christ your Music
and your song, for Complaining and feeling of want does often swallow up your
Praises. What think ye of these who go to hell, never troubled with such
thoughts? If your exercise be the way to hell, God help me; I have a cold coal
to blow at, and a blank paper for heaven: I give you Christ caution, and my
heaven surety for your Salvation. Lend Christ your Melancholy; for Satan has
no right to make a chamber in your Melancholy; borrow joy and comfort from the
Comforter; bid the Spirit do his office in you: and remember, that faith is
one thing, and the feeling and notice of faith another: God forbid that feeling
were Proprium quarto modo to all the Saints, and that this were good reasoning,
No feeling, no grace: I am sure ye were not always these twenty years bypast,
actually knowing that ye live, yet all this time ye are living: so is it with
the life of faith. But Alas! Dear Brother, it is easy for me to speak words
and syllables of peace, but Isa. 57. 19. tells you, I create peace: there is
but one Creator, ye know: O that ye may get a Letter of peace sent you from
heaven! Pray for me, and for grace to be faithful, and gifts to be able with
tongue and pen to glorify God. I forget you not.

St. Andrews Jan 8. 1640. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To my Lady BOYD. (32)
MADAM.
I Received your La: letter: but because I was still going through the country
for the affairs of the Church, I have had no time to answer it. I had never
more cause to fear then I have now, when my Lord has restored me to my second
created heaven on earth, and has turned my apprehended fears into joys and
great deliverance to his Church, whereof I have my share and part. Alas that
weeping prayers answered and sent back from heaven with joy, should not have
laughing praises! O that this land would repent and lay burdens of praises
upon the top of fair mount Zion. Madam, except this land be humbled, a
Reformation is rather my wonder, then belief at this time: but surely it must
be a wonder, and what is done already is a wonder: our Lord must restore beauty
to his Churches without hire; for we were sold without money, and now our
buyers repent them of the bargain, and would gladly give again better cheap
then they bought us: they devoured Jacob and eat up his people as bread; now
Jacob is grown a living child in their womb, and they would fain be delivered
of the child and render the birth: Our Lord shall be midwife. O that this land
be not like Ephraim an unwise son, that stays too long in the place of
breaking forth of children! Your La: is blessed with children who are honored
to build up Christ's waste places again: I believe your La: will think them
well bestowed on that work, and that Zion's beauty is your joy, this is a mark
and evidence for heaven which helps weak ones to hold their grip when other
marks fail them. I hope your La: is at a good understanding with Christ, and
that, as becomes a Christian, ye take him up aright [for many mistake and
misshape Christ] in his comings and goings: Your wants and falls proclaim ye
have nothing of your own but what ye borrow (nay, your self is not your own)
but Christ has given himself to you: Put Christ to the bank and heaven shall
be your interest and income: Love him, for ye cannot over-love him: Take up
your house in Christ, let him dwell in you and abide ye in him, and then ye may
look out of Christ and laugh at the clay-heavens that the sons of men are
seeking after in this side of the water. Christ minds to make your losses
grace's great advantage: Christ will lose nothing of you, nay, not your sins,
for he has an use for them as well as for your service, howbeit ye are to loath
your self for these. I hope ye fetch all the heaven ye have here in this life,
from that which is up above, and that your anchor is casten as high and deep as
Christ: O but it is far and many a mile to his bottom! If I had known long since
as I do now (though still, alas! I am ignorant) what was in Christ, I would
not have been so late in starting to the gate to seek him. O what can I do or
say to him who has made the North render me back again! A grave is no sure
prison to him for the keeping of dry bones. Woe's me that my foolish sorrow and
unbelief being on horseback did ride so produly and witlesly over my Lord's
Providence: but when my Faith was asleep, Christ was awake, and now when I am
awake I say he did all things well. O infinite wisdom! O incomparable loving
kindness! Alas that the heart I have is so little and worthless for such a Lord
as Christ is! O what odds find the saints in hard trials, when they feel sap
at their roots, betwixt them and sunburned withered professors: crosses and
storms cause them to cast their blooms and leaves: poor worldlings what will ye
do when the spanlength of your forenoon's laughter is ended and when the
weeping side of Providence is turned to you? I put up all the favors ye have
bestowed on my Brother upon Christ's score, in whose book are many such counts
and who will requite them. I wish you to be builded more and more upon the
stone laid in Zion and then ye shall be the more fit to have a hand in
rebuilding our Lord's fallen tabernacle in this land, in which ye shall find
great peace when ye come to grips with Death the King of terrouis. The God of
peace be with your La: and keep you blameless till the day of our Lord Jesus.

St Andrews. Your La: at all obedience in his sweet Lord and Master, S. R.

To his very dear friend JOHN FENNICK. (33)
Much honored and dear friend.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: The necessary impediments of my calling have
hitherto kept me from making a return to your letter, the heads whereof I shall
now briefly answer. As. 1. I approve your going to the fountain, when your own
Cisterne is dry: A difference there must be betwixt Christ's well and your
borrowed water, and why but ye have need of emptiness and drving up, as well as
ve have need of the well? want and a hole there must be in our vessel, to leave
room to Christ's art; his well has it is own need of thirsty drinkers, to
commend infinite love, which from eternity did brew such a cellar of living
waters for us. Ye commend his free love; and it is well done: Oh if I could help
you, and if I could be master-conveener to gather an earth-full and an
heaven-full of tongues dipped and steeped in my Lord's well of love or his wine
of love, even tongues drunken with his love, to raise a song of praises to him,
betwixt the East and West End and furthest points of the broad heavens! If I
were in your case [as alas! my dry and dead heart is not now in that garden] I
would borrow leave to come and stand upon the banks and coasts of that sea of
love, and be a feasted soul to see Love's fair tide, free Love's high and lofty
waves, each of them higher then ten earths, flowing in upon pieces of lost
clay: O welcome, welcome, great sea! O if I had as much love for wideness and
breadth, as twenty outmost shells and spheres of the heaven of heavens, that I
might receive in a little flood of his free love! Come, come, dear Friend, and
be pained that the King's wine-cellar of free love and his banqueting house [O
so wide, so stately! O so God-like, so glory-like!] should be so abundant, so
overflowing, and your shallow vessel so little to take in some part of that
love: but since it cannot come in you for want of room, enter your self in this
sea of love, and breath under these waters, and die of love, and live as one
dead and drowned of this Love. But why do ye complain of waters going over
your soul, and that the smoke of the terrors of a wrathful Lord, does almost
suffocate you and bring you to death's brink? I know the fault is in your eyes,
not in him; its not the rock that flees and moves, but the green sailer: if
your sense and apprehension be made judge of his love, there is a graven image
made presently, even a changed God and a foe-God, who was once [when ye washed
your steps with butter, and the rock poured you out rivers of oil, Job. 29. 6.]
a friend-God: either now or never let God work; ye had never since ye was a
man, such a fair field for faith: for a painted hell and an apprehension of
wrath in your father, is faith's opportunity to try what strength is in it: now
give God as large a measure of charity as ye have of sorrow; now see faith to
be faith indeed, if ye can make your grave betwixt Christ's feet, and say,
Though he should flay me, I will trust in him; his believed love shall be my
winding sheet, and all my grave-cloaths; I shall roll and sow in my soul, my
slain soul, in that web, his sweet and free love: and let him write upon my
grave Here lies a believing dead man, breathing out and making an hole in
death's broad side, and the breath of faith comes forth through the hole. See
now if ye can overcome and prevail with God, and wrestle God's tempting to
death and quit out of breath, as that renowned wrestler did, Hos 12. 3. And by
his strength he had power with God. v. 4. Yea he had power over the Angel and
prevailed. He is a strong man indeed who overmatcheth heaven's strength and the
holy One of Israel, the strong Lord: which is done by a secret supply of divine
strength within, wherewith the weakest being strengthened, overcome and conquer.
It shall be great victory to blow out the flame of that furnace year now in,
with the breath of faith: and when hell, men, malice, cruelty, falsehood,
Devils, the seeming glooms of a sweet Lord, meet you in the teeth, if ye then
as a captive of Hope, as one fettered in Hope's prison, run to your strong
hold, even from God glooming to God glooming, and believe the salvation of the
Lord in the dark, which is your only victory: your enemies are but pieces of
malicious clay, they shall die as men and be confounded. But that your troubles
are many at once, and arrows come in from all airths, from country, friends,
wife, children, foes, estate, and right down from God who is the hope and stay
of your soul, I confess is more and very heavy to be born; yet all these are
not more then Grace, all these bits of coals casten in your sea of mercy cannot
dry it up: your troubles are many and great, yet not an ounce-weight beyond the
measure of infinite wisdom, I hope, not beyond the measure of grace that he is
to bestow; for our Lord never yet brake the back of his child, nor spilt his
own work: nature's plastering and counterfit work he does often break in
sheards, and puts out a candle not lighted at the Sun of righteousness; but
he must cherish his own reeds and handle them softly, never a reed gets a
thrust with the Mediator's hand to lay together the two ends of the reed. O
what bonds and ligaments has our Surgeon of broken spirits, to bind up all
his lame and bruised ones with! cast your disjoynted spirit in his lap, and lay
your burden upon one who is so willing to take your cares and your fears off
you, and to exchange and niffer your crosses, and to give you new for old and
gold for iron, even to give you garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
It Is true in a great part what ye write of this Kirk, that the letter of
Religion only is reformed and scarce that: I do not believe out Lord will
build his Zion in this land, upon this skin of Reformation: so long as our scum
remains and our heart-idols are kept, this work must be at a stand; and
therefore our Lord must yet sift this land and search us with candles; and I
know, he shall give and not sell us his Kingdom: his Grace and our remaining
guiltiness must be compared, and the one must be seen in the glory of it and
the other in the sinfulness of it: But I desire to believe and would gladly
hope to see, that the glancing and shining luster of glory, coming from the
diamonds and stones set in the crown of our Lord Jesus, shall cast rays and
beams many thousand miles about. I hope Christ is upon a great Marriage, and
that his wooing and suting of his excellent Bride, does take it is beginning
from us the ends of the earth. O what joy and what glory would I judge it, if
my heaven should be suspended, till I might have leave to run on foot, to be a
witness of that Marriage-glory, and see Christ put on the glory of his last
married Bride and his last Marriage-love on earth, when he shall enlarge his
lovebed and set it upon the top of the mountains, and take in the elder Sister,
the Jews, and the fullness of the Gentiles! It were heaven's honor and glory
upon earth, to be his lackey to run at his horse-foot and hold up the train of
his Marriage-roberoyal, in the day of our high and royal Solomon's espousals.
But O what glory to have a seat or ^e^ in King Jesus his chariot, that is
bottomed with gold and paved and lined over and floored within with Love, f^
the daughters of Jerusalem! Cant. 3. 10. To lie upon such a King's love, were a
bed next to the flower of heaven's glory. I am sorry to hear you speak in your
Letter, of a God an^ry at you, and of the sense of his indignation, which only
arises from suffering for Jesus, all that is now come upon you: Indeed
apprehended wrath flameth out of such ashes as apprehended sin; but not from
suffering for Christ: But suppose ye were in hell for by-gones and for old
debt, I hope ye ow Christ a great sum of charity to believe the sweetness of
his love: I know what it is to sin in that kind, it is to sin our [if it were
possible] the unchangeableness of a Godhead out of Christ, and to sin away a
lovely and unchangeable God. Put more honest apprehensions upon Christ, put on
his own mask upon his face, and not your vail made of unbelief, which speaks,
as if he borrowed love to you, from you and your demerits and sinful
deservings. Oh no! Christ is man, but he is not like man; he has man's love in
heaven, but it is lustered with God's love, and it is very God's love, ye have
to do with: When your wheels go about, he stands still: Let God be God and
be ye a man, and have ye the deserving of man and the sin of one who has
suffered your Welbeloved to slip away, nay has refused him entrance, when he
was knocking till his head and locks were frozen: Yet what is that to him? his
book keeps your name, and is not printed and reprinted and changed and
corrected: And why but he should go to his place and hide himself? Howbeit his
Departure be his own good work, yet the belief of it in that manner is your
sin: But wait on till he return with Salvation and cause you rejoice in the
latter end. It is not much to complain: but rather believe then complain, and
sit in the dust and close your mouth, till he make your sown light grow again;
for your afflictions are not eternal, Time will end them, and so shall ye at
length see the Lord's salvation: his love sleeps not, but is still in working
for you, his Salvation will not tarry nor linger, and Suffering for him is the
noblest cross that is out of heaven: Your Lord had the wail and choice of ten
thousand other crosses beside this, to exercise you withal; but his wisdom and
his love wailed and choosed out this for you, beside them all, and take it as a
choice one, and make use of it, so, as ye look to this world as your
stepmother in your borrowed prison: For it is a love-look to heaven and the
other side of the water, that God seeks: and this is the fruit, the flower
and bloom growing out of your cross, that ye be a dead man to time, to clay, to
gold, to country, to friends, wife, children, and all pieces of created
nothings, for in them there is not a seat nor bottom for your soul's love. O
what room is for your Love [if it were as broad as the sea] up in heaven and in
God! and what would not Christ give for your love? God gave so much for your
soul, and blessed are ye, if ye have a love for him and can call in your soul's
love from all idols, and can make a God of God, a God of Christ and draw a line
betwixt your heart and him. If your deliverance come not, Christ's presence and
his believed love must stand as caution and surety for your deliverance, till
your Lord send it in his blessed time: for Christ has many Salvations, if we
could see them: and I would think it better born comfort and joy that comes
from the faith of deliverance and the faith of his love, then that which comes
from deliverance it self. It is not much matter, if ye find ease to your
afflicted soul, what be the means, either of your own wishing, or of God's
choosing; the latter I am sure is best and the comfort strongest and sweetest:
let the Lord absolutely have the ordering of your evils and troubles, and put
them off you by recommending your cross and your furnace to him, who has skill
to melt his own metal and knows well what to do with his surnace: let your
heart be willing that God's fire have your tin and brass and dross: to consent
to want corruption is a greater mercy then many professors do well know, and
to refer the manner of God's Physic to his own wisdom, whither it be by
drawing blood, or giving sugared drinks that cure sick folks without pain, it
is a great point of faith; and to believe Christ's cross to be a friend as he
himself is a friend, is also a special act of faith: but when ye are over the
water, this case shall be a yesterday past an hundred years ere ye were born,
and the cup of glory shall wash the memory of all this away and make it as
nothing: Only now take Christ in with you under your yoke, and let patience
have her perfect work, for this haste is your infimity. The Lord is rising up
to do you good in the latter end, put on the faith of his salvation and see
him posting and hasting toward you. Sir, my employments being so great, hinder
me to write at more length excuse me: I hope to be mindful of you. I shall be
obliged to your if ye help me with your prayers for this people, this College,
and my own poor soul. Grace be with you. Remember my love to your wife.

To the much honored PETER STIRLING. (34)
Much honored and worthy Sir.
I Received yours, and cannot but be ashamed that mistaking love has brought
me in court and account in the heart of God's children, especially of another
nation: I should not make a lie of the grace of God, if I should think I have
little share of it my self: O how much better were it for me to stand in the
counting table of many for a halfpenny and to be esteemed a liker rather than a
lover of Christ! If I were weighed, vanity should bear down the scale, as
having weight in the balance above me; except my lovely Savior should cast in
beside me some of his borrowed worth; and Oh if I were writing now sincerely in
this extenuation, which may be and I fear is, subtle and coosening pride! I
would I could love something of heaven's worth in you and all of your metal.
O how happy were I, if I could regain and conquer back from the creature my
sold and lost love, that I might lay it upon heaven's jewel, that ever, ever
blooming flower of the highest garden, even my soul-redeeming and
never-enoughprized Lord Jesus! O that he would wash my love and put it on the
Mediator's wheel and refine it from it is dross and tin, that I might propine
and gift that Lord so love-worthy, with all my love! Oh if I could set a lease
of thousands of years and a suspension of my part of heaven's glory, and frist
till a long day my desired salvation, sobeing I could in this lower kitchen and
under-vault of his creation, be feasted with his love, and that I might be a
footstool for his glory before men and Angels! Oh if he would let out heaven's
fountain upon withered me, dry and sapless me! If I were but sick of love for
his love [and O how would that sickness delight me!] How sweet would that
easing and refreshing pain be to my soul! I shall be glad to be a witness to
behold the Kingdom: of the world become Christ's: I could stay out of heaven
many years to see that victorious triumphing Lord act that prophesied part of
his soul-conquering love, in taking in to his Kingdom the greater Sister, that
Kirk of the Jews, who sometimes courted our Welbeloved for her little Sister,
Cant. 8: 8. to behold him set up as an ensign and a banner of love to the ends
of the world. And truly we are to believe that his wrath is ripe for the land
of graven images, and for the falling of that millstone in the midst of the
sea. Grace be with you.

St Andrews March. 6. 1640. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To the Lady FINGASK. (35.)
MADAM.
GRace mercy and peace be to you: Though not acquainted, yet at the desire of a
Christian, I make bold to write a line or two unto you by way of counsel
[howbeit I be most unfit for that] I hear, and I bless the father of lights
for it, that ye have a spirit set to seek God, and that the posture of your
heart is to look heavenward; which is a work and cast of the Mediator Christ's
right hand, who puts on the heart a new frame, for the which I would have
your La: to see a tie and bond of obedience laid upon you, that all may be done
not so much from obligation of Law, as from the tie of free love; that the law
of ransom-paying by Christ may be the chief ground of all your obedience,
seeing that ye are not under the Law but under Grace: withal know that
unbeleef is a spiritual sin and so not seen by nature's light, and that all
that Conscience says is not Scripture: Suppose your heart bear witness against
you for sins done long ago; yet because many have pardon with God, that have
not peace with themselves, ye are to stand and fall by Christ's esteem and
verdict of you and not by that which your heart says: Suppose it may by
accident be a good sign to be jealouse of your heavenly husband's love, yet it
is a sinful sign: as there be some happy sins [If may speak so] not of
themselves but because they are neighboured with faith and love: and so, worthy
Lady, I would have you hold by this that the ancient love of an old husband
stands firm and sure, and let faith hing by this small thread, that he loved
you before he laid the cornerstone of the world, and therefore, he cannot
change his mind because he is God, and rests in his love; neither is sin in
you, a good reason wherefore ye should doubt of him, or think because sin has
put you in the courtesy and reverence of justice, that therefore he is wroth
with you: Neither is it presumption in you to lay the burden of your salvation
upon one mighty to save; so being ye lay aside all confidence in your
self-worth and righteousness. True faith is humble and sees no way to escape
but only in Christ: And I believe ye have put an esteem and high price upon
Christ: and they cannot but believe, and so be saved, who love Christ and to
whom he is precious: for the love of Christ has chosen Christ as a lover, and
it were not like God, if ye should choose him as your liking and he not choose
you again, nay he has prevented you in that, for ye have not chosen him but he
has chosen you. O consider his loveliness and beauty, and that there is
nothing which can commend and make fair, heaven or earth, or the creature, that
is not in him, in infinite perfection, for fair sun and fair moon are black and
think shame to shine before his fairness, Isa. 24, 23. Base heavens and
excellent Jesus: weak Angels, and strong and mighty Jesus: foolish angel-wisdom
and only wise Jesus: short-living creature and long living and everliving
Ancient of days: miserable and sickly and wretched are these things that are
within times circle and only, only blessed Jesus! If ye can wynd-in in his
love: [and he gives you leave ^o love him and allurements also] what a second
heaven's paradise, a young heaven's glory is it, to be hot and burned with
fevers of love-sickness for him? and the more your La: drink of this love,
there is the more room and the greater delight and desire for this love: be
homely and hunger for a feast and fill of his love, for that is the borders and
march of heaven: nothing has a nearer resemblance to the color and hew and
luster of heaven; then Christ loved, and to breath out love-word, and
love-sighs for him. Remember what he is: when twenty thousand millions of
heavens lovers have worn their hearts threed-bare of love, all is nothing, yea
less then nothing to his matchless worth and excellency: O so broad and so deep
as the sea of his desirable loveliness is! Glorified spirits, triumphing
Angels, the crowned and exalted lovers of heaven, stand without his loveliness
and cannot put a cricle on it. O if sin and time were from betwixt us, and that
royal and King's love! That high Majesty, eternitie's bloom and flower of
high-lustred beauty might shine upon pieces of created spirits, and might bedew
and overflow us who are portions of endless misery and lumps of redeemed sin:
Alas what do I! I but spill and lose words in speaking highly of him, who will
bide and be above the music and songs of heaven, and never be enough praised
by us all, to whose boundless and bottomless love I recommed your La: and am.

St Andrews. March. 27. 1640. Your La: in Christ Jesus, S. R.

To his reverend and dear Brother Mr DAVID DICKSON. (36)
Reverend and dear Brother.
YE look like the house whereof ye are a branch: the Cross is a part of the
life rent that lies to all the sons of the house. I desire to suffer with you,
if I take a lift of your housetrial off you: but ye have preached it ere I knew
any thing of God: your Lord may gather his roses, and shake his apples, at what
season of the year he pleases; each husbandman cannot make harvest when he
pleases, as He can do: ye are taught to know and adore his soveraignity which
he exercises over you, which yet is lustered with mercy: the child has but
changed a bed in the garden, and is planted up higher nearer the sun, where he
shall thiive^ better then in this out-held moor-ground: Ye must think your bold
would not want him one hour longer, and since the (...) of your loan of him was
expired [as it is, if ye read the ^eas^] let him have his own with gain, as
good reason were. I read on it an exaltation and a richer measure of grace, as
the s^t fruit of your cross: and I am bold to say, that, that College where
your Master has set you now, shall find it. I am content that Chirst is so
homely with my dear Brother David Dickson, as to borrow and lend, and take and
give with him, and ye know what are called the visitations of such a friend,
it' s to come to the house and be homely with what is yours: I persuade my sel^
upon his credit, he has left drink-money, and that he has made the house the
better of him. I envy not his waking love; who saw that this water was to be
past through and that now the number of crosses lying in your way to glory, are
fewer by one then when I saw you; they must decrease: it is better then any
ancient or modern commentary on your Text that ye preach upon in Glasgow: read
and spell right, for he knows what he does, he is only lopping and snedding
a fruitful tree that it may be more fruitful. I congratulate heartily with
you, his new welcome to your new charge. Dearest Brother, go on and faint not,
something of yours is in heaven, beside the flesh of your exalted Savior, and
ye go on after your own: time's thread is shorter by one inch then it was: an
oath is sworn and past the seals; whether afflictions will or not, ye must grow
and swell out of your shell, and live and triumph and reign, and be more then
conqueror, for your captain who leads you on, i^ more then conqueror, and
he makes you a partaker of his conquest and Victory. Did not love to you
compel me, I would not fetch water to the well, and speak to one who knows
b^ter then I can do, what God is doing with him. Remember my love to your
wife, to Mr John, and all friends there. Let us be helped by your prayers, for
I cease not to make mention of you to the Lord as I dow. Grace be with you.

St Andrews. May. 28. 16^0. Yours in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To my Lady BOYD. (37)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Impute it not to a disrespective
forgetfulness of your La: who ministered to me in my bonds, that I write not to
you: I wish I could speak or write what might do good to your La: especially
now, when I think ye cannot but have deep thoughts of the deep and bottomless
ways of our Lord, in taking away, with a sudden and wonderful stroke your
brethren and friends. Ye may know, all that die for sin, die not in sin, and
that none can teach the Almighty knowledge, he answers none of our Courts,
and no man can say, What do thou? It Is true, your brethren saw not many
summers; but adore and fear the sovereignty of the great Potter, who makes and
marreth his clay-vessels when and how it pleases him. This under-garden is
absolutely his own and all that grows in it, his absolute liberty is
law-biding, the flowers are his own, if some be but summer-apples he may pluck
them down before others. O what wisdom is it to believe and not to dispute, to
subject the thoughts to his Court and not to repine at any act of his justice!
He has done it, all flesh be silent: it is impossible to be submissive and
religiously patient if ye stay your thoughts down among the confused rollings
and wheels of second causes, as, Oh the place! Oh the time! Oh if this had
been, this had not followed! Oh the linking of this accident with this time and
place! Look up to the Master-motion and the first wheel, see and read the
decree of heaven and the Creator of men, who breweth death to his children and
the manner of it: and they see far in a millstone, and have eyes that make a
hole to see through the one side of a mountain to the other, who can take up
his ways: How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
His Providence halteth not, but goes with even and equal legs: yet are they
not the greatest sinners, upon whom tower of Siloam fell: was not time's lease
expired, and the sand of heaven's sand-glass set by our Lord, run out? Is not
he an unjust debtor who pays due debt with chiding? I believe, Christian
Lady, your faith leaves that much charity to our Lord's judgments, as to
believe, how beit ye be in blood sib to that cross, that yet ye are exempted
and freed from the gall and wrath that is in it. I dare not deny but (Job. 18:
15.) the King of terrors dwells in the wicked man's tabernacle: brimstone
shall be scattered on his habitation: yet, Madam, it is safe for you to live
upon the faith of his love, whose arrows are over-watered and pointed with love
and mercy to his own, and who knows how to take you and yours out of the roll
and book of the dead. Our Lord has not the eyes of flesh in distributing wrath
to the thousand generation without exception. Seeing ye are not under the Law,
but under Grace and married to another husband: Wrath is not the Court that ye
are liable to. As I would not wish, neither do I believe, your La: does
despise; so neither faint: read and spell aright all the words and syllabes in
the visitation, and miscall neither letter nor syllabe in it. Come along with
the Lord, and see, and lay no more weight upon the Law then your Christ has
laid upon it: If the Law's bill get an answer from Christ, the curses of it can
do no more: And I hope ye have resolved that if he should grind you to powder,
your dust and powder shall believe his salvation: And who can tell what
thoughts of love and peace our Lord has to your children? I trust he shall
make them famous in excuting the written judgments upon the enemies of the
Lord, this honor have all his saints, Psalm. 149: 9. and that they shall bear
stones on their shoulders, for building that city that is called, Ezekiel. 46: 35.
The Lord is there: and happy shall they be who have a hand in the sacking of
Babel, and come out in the year of vengeance for the controversy of Zion,
against the land of graven images. Therefore, Madam, let the Lord make out of
your father's house any work, even of judgment, that he pleases: What i^
wrath to others, is mercy to you and your house. It is Faith's work to claim
and challenge loving kindness out of all the roughest strokes of God. Do that
for the Lord, which ye will do for time; time will calm your heart at that
which God has done, and let our Lord have it now. What love ye did bear to
friends now dead, seeing they stand now in no need of it, let it fall as just
legacy to Christ. O how sweet to put out many strange lovers, and to put in
Christ! It is much for our half-slain affections to part with that which we
believe we have right unto; but the servant's will should be our will, and he
is the best servant who retains least of his own will and most of his
Master's. That much wisdom must be ascribed to our Lord, that he knows how to
lead his own in-through and outthrough the little time-hells and the pieces of
time-during wraths in this life, and yet keep safe his love without any blurre
upon the old and great seal of free Election: And seeing his mountains of
brass, the mighty and strong decrees of free grace in Christ, stand sure, and
the Covenant stands fast for ever as the days of heaven, let him strike and
nurture, his striking must be a very act of saving; seeing strokes upon his
secret ones, come from the soft and heavenly hand of the Mediator, and his
rods are steeped and watered in that flood and river of love that comes from
the God-man's heart of our soul-loving and soul-redeeming JESUS. I hope ye are
content to frist the Cautioner of mankind his own conquest, heaven, till he
pay it you and bring you to a state of glory, where he shall never crook a
finger upon, nor lift a hand to you again: And be content, and withal greedily
covetous of Grace, the interest and pledge of Glory. If I did not believe your
crop to be on the ground, and your part of that heaven of the saints heaven,
white and ruddy, fair, fair and beautiful Jesus, were come to the bloom and
the flower, and near your hook I would not write this; but seeing time' thread
is short, and ye are upon the entry of heaven's harvest, and Christ the field
of heaven's glory is white and ripe-like, the losses that I write of to your
La: are but summer-showers that will only wet your garments for an hour or
two, and the Sun of the new Jerusalem shall quickly dry the wet coat;
especially seeing rains of Affliction cannot stain the image of God or cause
Grace cast the color: And since ye will not alter upon him, who will not
change upon you, I durst in weakness think my self no spiritual Seer, if I
should not prophecy, that daylight is near when such a morning-darkness is
upon you and that this trial of your Christian mind toward him whom ye dare
not leave howbeit he should slay you, shall close with a doubled mercy. It is
time for faith to hold fast as much of Christ as ever ye had and to make the
grip stronger and to cleave closer to him, seeing Christ loves to be believed
in and trusted to: The glory of laying strength upon one that is mighty to
save, is more then we can think: That piece of service of believing in a
smiting Redeemer is a precious part of obedience. O what glory to him to lay
over the burden of our heaven upon him that purchased for us an eternal
Kingdom! O blessed soul who can adore and kiss his lovely, free Grace. The rich
grace of Christ be with your spirit.

St. Andrews. October. 15. 1640. Yours at all obedience in Christ Jesus, S. R.

To AGNES MCMATH. (38)
Dear Sister.
IF our Lord has taken away your child, your lease of him is expired, and
seeing Christ would want him no longer, it is your part to hold your peace, and
worship and adore the sovereignty and liberty that the potter has over the
clay and pieces of clay-nothings that he gave life unto: And what is man to
call and summond the Almighty to his lower Court down here? For he gives
account of none of his doings: And if ye will take a loan of a child and give
him back again to our Lord, laughing, as his borrowed goods should return to
him, believe he is not gone away, but sent before, and that the change of the
country should make you think, he is not lost to you who is found to Christ,
and that he is now before you, and that the dead in Christ shall be raised
again: A going down star is not annihilat, but shall appear again: If he have
casten his bloom and flower, the bloom is fallen in heaven in Christ's lap; And
as he was lent a while to Time, so is he given now to Eternity, which will take
yourself: And the difference of your shipping and his, to heaven and Christ's
shore, the land of life, is only in some few years, which wears every day
shorter, and some short and soon-reckoned summers will give you a meeting with
him; but what? with him? ^^y, with better company, with the chief and leader of
the heavenly troops that are riding on white horses, that are triumphing in
glory. If Death were a sleep that had no wakening, we might sorrow: But our
Husband shall quickly be at the bed-sides of all that lie sleeping in the
grave, and shall raise their mortal bodies. Christ was Death's Cautioner, who
gave his word to come and loose all the clay-pawnes and set them at his own
right hand, and our Cautioner, Christ, has an Act of Law-surety upon Death to
render back his captives: And that Lord Jesus, who knows the turnings and
windings that is in that black trance of Death, has numbered all the steps of
the stair up to heaven; he knows how long the turnpike is or how many pair of
stairs high it is, for he ascended that way himself. Rev. 1: 18. I was dead and
am alive. and now he lives at the right hand of God, and his garments have not
so much as a smell of death. Your afflictions smell of the childrens case, the
bairns of the house are so nurtured, and Suffering is no new life, it is but
the rent of the sons, bastards have not so much of the rent: take kindly and
heartsomly with his cross, who never yet slew a ehilde with the cross: He
breweth your cup, therefore drink it patiently and with the better will: Stay
and wait on, till Christ loose the knot that fasteneth his cross on your back,
for he is coming to deliver: and I pray you, Sister, learn to be worthy of his
pains who corrects, and let him wring, and be ye wa^hen, for he has a
father's heart and a father's hand who is training you up and making you meet
for the high hall. This School of Suffering is a preparation for the King's
higher house: and let all your visitations speak all the letters of your Lord
summonds: they cry. 1. O vain World! 2. O bitter Sin! 3 O short and uncertain
Time! 4. O fair Eternity; that is above sickness and Death! 5. O Kingly and
Princely Bridegroom! Hasten Glorie's Marriage, shorten Time's short-spun and
soonbroken thread, and conquer Sin! 6. O happy and blessed Death, that golden
bridge laid over by Christ my Lord betwixt Time's clay-banks and heaven's
shore! and the Spirit and the Bride say Come, and answer ye with them, Even so,
come Lord jesus! Come quickly! Grace be with you.

St Andrews. October. 15. 1640. Your brother in his sweet Lord Jesus, S. R.

To Mr MATTHEW MOWAT. (39)
Reverend and dear Brother.
WHat am I to answer you? Alas! my books are all bare and show me little of
God: I would fain go beyond books in to his house of love, to see himself.
Dear Brother, neither ye nor I, are parties worthy of his love or knowledge.
Ah! how has sin bemisted and blinded us that we cannot see him? But for my
poor self, I am pained and like to burst, because he will not take down the
wall, and fetch hi^ uncreated beauty, and bring his matchless, white and ruddy
face out of heaven one's errand, that I may have heaven meeting me ere I go to
it, in such a wonderful sight: ye know that Majesty and Love do humble,
because homely love to sinners dwells in him with Majesty: Ye should give him
all his own court-stiles, his high and heaven-names. What am I to shape
conceptions of my highest Lord? How broad and how high and how deep he is above
and beyond what these conceptions are, I cannot tell: but for my own weak
practice [which alas! can be no rule to one so deep in love-sickness with
Christ as ye are] I would fain add to my thoughts and esteem of him, and make
him more high, and would wish an heart and love ten thousand times wider then
the outmost circle and curtain that goes about the heaven of heavens, to
entertain him in that heart and with that love. But that which is your pain, my
dear Brother, is mine also, I am confounded with the thoughts of him: I know
God is casten [if I may speak so] in a sweet mould and lovely image, in the
person of that heaven's jewel, the man Christ, and that the steps of that steep
ascent^ stair to the Godhead is the flesh of Christ, the new and living way;
and there is footing for faith in that curious Ark of the humanity: therein
dwells the Godhead married upon our Humanity. I would be in heaven, suppose I
had not another errand, but to see that dainty golden Ark and God personally
looking out at ears and eyes and a body such as we sinners have, that I might
wear my sinful mouth in kisses on him for evermore: and I know all the Three
blessed Persons should be well pleased, that my piece of faint and created love
should first coast upon the man Christ; I should see them all through him. I am
called from writing by my great employments in this town, and have said
nothing: but what can I say of him: Let us go and see.

To my Lady KENMURE. (40)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to your La: I am heartily sorry that your La: is
deprived of such an husband, and the Lord's Kirk of so active and faithful a
friend. I know your La: long ago made acquaintance with that wherein Christ
will have you joined in a fellowship with himself, even with his own Cross, and
has taught you to stay your soul upon the Lord's goodwill, who gives not
account of his matters to any of us: When he has led you through this water
that was in your way to glory, there are fewer behind: and his order in
dismissing us, and sending us out of the market, one before another, is to be
reverenced. One year's time of heaven shall swallow up all sorrows, even beyond
all comparison: What then will not a duration of blessedness so long as God
shall live fully and abundantly recompense? It is good that our Lord has given
a debtor obliged by gracious promises, for more in Eternity then Time can take
from you: and I believe, your La: has been now many years advising and
thinking what that Glory will be which is abiding the pilgrims and strangers on
the earth, when they come home, and which we may think of, love and thirst for,
but we cannot comprehend it, nor conceive of it as it is, far less can we
over-think or over-love it. O so long a Chapter, or rather, so large a Volume,
as Christ is in that Divinity of Glory! There is no more of him let down now to
be seen and enjoyed by his children, but as much as may feed hunger in this
life, but not satisfy it. Your La: is a debtor to the Son of God's Cross, that
is wea^ing out love and affiance in the creature, out of your heart by degrees:
or rather, the obligation stands to his free grace, who cares for your La:
in this gracious dispensation, and who is preparing and making ready the
garments of Salvation for you, and who calls you with a new name that the
mouth of the Lord has named, and purposes to make you a crown of glory and a
royal diadem in the hand of your God. Isa. 62. 2. 3. Ye are obliged to frist
him more then one heaven, and yet he craveth not a long day, it is fast coming
and is sure payment. though ye gave no hire for him, yet has he given a great
price and ransom for you: and if the bargain were to make again, Christ would
give no less for you then what he has already given; he is far from ruing. I
shall wish you no more till Time be gone out of the way, then the earnest of
that which he has purchased and prepared for you, which can never be fully
preached, written or thought of, since it has not entered into the heart to
consider it. So recommending your La: to the rich grace of our Lord Jesus, I am
and rests

St Andrews Your La: at all respective observance in Christ Jesus, S, R.

To Mistress TAILOR. (41)
MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: Though I have no relation worldly or
acquaintance with you, yet (upon the testimony and importunity of your Elder
son now at London, where I am, but chiefily because I esteem Jesus Christ in
you to be in place of all relations] I make bold in Christ to speak my poor
thoughts to you concerning your Son lately fallen asleep in the Lord [who was
some time under the ministry of the worthy servant of Christ, my
fellow laborer Mr Blair, and by whose ministry I hope he reaped no small
advantage] I know, grace rooteth not out the affections of a mother, but
puts them on his wheel who makes all things new, that they may be refined,
therefore sorrow for a dead child is allowed to you, though by measure and
ounce-weights; the redeemed of the Lord have not a dominion or Lordship over
their sorrow and other affections, to lavish out Christ's goods at their
pleasure; for ye are not your own, but bought with a price, and your sorrow is
not your own, nor has he redeemed you by halves; and therefore ye are not to
make Christ's cross no cross: He commands you to weep, and that Princely one
who took up to heaven with him a man's heart, to be a compassionat high priest,
became your fellow and companion on earth by weeping for the dead Ioh. 11: 35.
And therefore ye are to love that cross, because it was once on Christ's
shoulders before you; so that by his own practice he has overguilded and
covered your cross with the Mediator's luster: The cup ye drink was at the lip
of sweet Jesus, and he drank of it, and so it has a smell of his breath: And I
conceive ye love it not the worse that it is thus sugared, therefore drink and
believe the resurrection of your Son's body: If one coal of hell could fall off
the exalted head Jesus, Jesus the Prince of the Kings of the earth, and burn me
to ashes, knowing I were a partner with Christ, and a fellow-sharer with him
[though the unworthiest of men] I think I should die a lovely death in that
fire, with him: The worst things of Christ, even his cross, have much of heaven
from himself, and so has your Christian sorrow, being of kin to Christ's in
that kind: If your sorrow were a Bastard, and not of Christ's house [because
of the relation ye have to him in conformity with his death and sufferings] I
should the more compassionat your condition; but kind and compassionat Jesus,
at every sigh ye give for the loss of your now-glorified child [so I believe,
as is meet] with a man's heart cries half mine. I was not a witness to his
death, being called out or the Kingdom; but ye shall credit these whom I do
credit (and I dare not lie) he died comfortably: It is true he died before he
did so much service to Christ on earth, as I hope and heartily desire your Son
Mr Hugh [very dear to me in Jesus Christ] shall do: But that were a real
matter of sorrow, if this were not to counterballance it, that he has changed
service-houses, but has not changed services or master Rev. 22: 3. And there
shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it,
and his servants shall serve him. What he could have don in this lower house,
he is now upon that same service in the higher house, and it is all one, it is
the same service and the same Master, only there is a change of conditions:
And ye are not to think it a bad bargain for your beloved son, where he has
gold for copper and brass, Eternity for Time. I believe Christ has taught you
[for I give credit to such a witness of you as your Son Mr Hugh] not to sorrow
because he died: All the knot must be, he died too soon, he died too young, he
died in the morning of his life, this is all; but soveraignity must silence
your thoughts: I was in your condition, I had but two children, and both are
dead since I came hither: The supreme and absolut former of all things gives
not an account of any of his matters: The good husbandman may pluck his roses,
and gather in his lilies at midsummer, and for ought I dare say, in the
beginning of the first summer-moneth: and he may transplant young trees out of
the lower-ground to the higher, where they may have more of the sun and a more
free air, at any season of the year: what is that to you or me: The goods are
his own. The Creator of time and winds did a merciful injury [if I dare
borrow the word] to nature, in landing the passenger so early. They love the
sea too well, who complain of a fair wind and a desirable tide, and a speedy
coming ashore, especially a coming ashore in that land where all the
inhabitants have everlasting joy upon their heads: He cannot be too early in
heaven: His twelve hours were not short hours: And withal if ye consider this,
had ye been at his bedside, and should have seen Christ coming to him, ye
would not, ye could not have adjourned Christ's free love, who would want him
no longer: And dying in an other land where his mother could not close his
eyes, is not much: who closed Mose's eyes? And who put on his winding sheet?
For ought I know, neither father nor mother nor friend, but God only: And
there is as expedite, fair and easy a way betwixt Scotland and heaven, as if
he had died in the very bed he was born in: The whole earth is his father's:
Any corner of his father's house is good enough to die in. It may be, the
living child (I speak not of Mr. Hugh) is more grief to you then the dead: Ye
are to wait on, if at any time God shall give him repentance: Christ waited as
long possibly on you and me, certainly longer on me: and if he should deny
repentance to him, I could say some thing to that; but I hope better things of
him: It seems that Christ will have this world your step-dame: I love not
your condition the wo^se, it may be a proof that ye are not a child of this
lower house, but a stranger: Christ sees it not good only, but your only
good, to be lead thus to heaven: and think this a favor, that he has bestowed
upon you, Free, free grace, that is, mercy without hire, ye paid nothing for
it: And who can put a price upon any thing of Royal and Princely Jesus Christ?
And that God has given to you to suffer for him the spoiling of your goods,
esteem it as an act of free grace also: Ye are no loser, having himself: And I
persuade my self, if ye could prize Christ, nothing could be bitter. to you.
Grace, grace be with you.

To BARBARA HAMILTON. (42)
Worthy Friend.
GRace be to you: I do unwillingly write unto you of that which God has done
concerning your son in law; only, I believe ye look not below Christ and the
higest and most supreme act of providence, which moves all wheels: And
certainly what came down enacted and concluded in the great book before the
throne, and signed and subscribed with the hand which never did wrong, should
be kissed and adored by us: we see God's decrees, when they bring forth their
fruits, all actions, good and ill, sweet and sour in their time; But we see
not presently the afterbirth of God's decree, to wit, his blessed end and the
good that he brings out of the womb of his holy and spotless counsel: we see
his working, and we sorrow: The end of his counsel and working lies hidden and
underneath the ground, and therefore we cannot believe: Even amongst men, we
see hewn stones, timber and an hundred scattered parcels and pieces of an
house, all under-tools, hammers and axes and saws; yet the house, the beauty
and ease of so many lodgings and ease-rooms, we neither see nor understand for
the present: these are but in the mind and head of the builder as yet: we see
red earth, unbroken clods, furrows and stones; but we see not summer-lilies,
roses, and the beauty of a garden: If ye give the Lord time to work [as often
he that believes not, makes haste, but not speed] his end is under the
ground, and ye shall see it was your good that your Son has changed
dwelling-places, but not his Master: Christ thought good to have no more of his
service here, yet Rev. 22: 3. His servants shall serve him: He needs not us
or our service, either in earth or in heaven: But ye are to look to him, who
gives the hireling both his leave and his wages for his naked aim and purpose
to serve Christ, as well as for his labors: It is put up in Christ's account,
such a labourer did sweat forty years in Christ's vineyard, howbeit he got not
leave to labor so long, because he who accepts of the will for the deed,
counts so: None can teach the Lord to lay an account: He numbereth the drop
of rain, and knows the stars by their names: It would take us much studying
to give a name to every star in the firmament, great or small. See Lev. 13: 13.
And Aaron held his peace: Ye know his two Sons were ^^ain, whilst they offered
strange fire to the Lord: Command your thoughts to be silent: If the soldiers
of Newcasile had done this, ye might have stomacked, but the weapon wa in
another hand: Hear the rod what it preaches, and see the name of God, M^. 6.
9. And know that there is somewhat of God and Heaven in the ^od: The Majesty of
the unsearchable and bottomless ways and judgments of God is not seen in the
rod, and the seeing of them r^quireth the eyes of the man of wisdom. If the
sufferings of some other with you in that loss could ease you, ye want them
not: But He can do no wrong, he cannot halt, his goings are equal who has
done it. I know our Lord aims at more mortification: let him not come in vain
to your house, and lose the p^ins of a merciful visit: God, the founder,
never melts in vain; howbeit to us, he seems often to lose both fire and
metal: But I know year more in this work then I can be: There is no cause to
faint or weary. Grace be with you, and the rich consolations of Jesus Christ
sweeten your cross and support you under it. I rest.

To Mis^ress HUME. (43.)
Loving Sister.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you; If ye have any thing better then the husband
of your youth, ye are Jesus Christ's de^ter for it: Pay not then your debts
with grudging: Sorrow may diminish from the sweet fruit of righteousness; but
quietness, silence, submission and faith, put a crown upon your sad losses: ye
know whose voice the voice of a crying rod is. Micah. 6. 9. The name and
majesty of the Lord is written on the rod, read and be instructed: Let Christ
have the room of the husband, he has now no need of you or of your love; for
he enjoys as much of the love of Christ as his heart can be capable of: I
confess it is a dear-bought experience to teach you to undervalue the creature;
yet it is not too dear if Christ think it so. I know that the disputing of your
thoughts against his going thither, the way and manner of his death, the
instruments, the place, the time, will not ease your spirit, except ye rise
higher then second causes, and be silent because the Lord has done it: If we
measure the goings of the Almighty and his ways, the bottom whereof we see
not, we quite mistake God: O how little a portion of God see we! He is far
above our ebb and narrow thoughts: He ruled the world in wisdom, ere we
creatures of yesterday were born, and shall rule it when we shall be lodging
beside the worms and corruption: Only, learn heavenly wisdom, self-denial and
mortification by this sad loss: I know that it is not for nothing (except ye
deny God to be wise in all he does) that ye have lo^ one in earth: There has
been too little of your love and heart in heaven, and therefore the jealousy
of Christ has done this: It is a mercy that he contendeth with you and all
your lovers: I should desire no greater savor for my self, then that Christ
laid a necessity and took on such bonds upon himself; Such an one I must have,
and such a soul I cannot live in heaven without. Ioh. 10. 16. And believe it,
it is incomprehensible love, that Christ says, If I enjoy the glory of my
father, and the crown of heaven far above men and Angels, I must use all means,
though never so violent, to have the company of such an One, for ever and ever:
If with the eyes of wisdom, as a child of wisdom, ye justify your mother The
wisdom of God [whose child ye are] ye shall kiss and embrace this loss, and
see much of Christ in it: Believe and submit, and refer the income of the
consolations of Jesus, and the event of the trial to your heavenly father, who
numbereth all your hairs: And put Christ in his own room in your Love: It may
be he has either been out of his own place, or in a place of love inferior to
his worth: Repair Christ in all his wrongs done to him, and love him for a
husband, and he is a husband to the widow shall be that to you, which he has
taken from you. Grace be with you.

London. October. 15. 1645. Your sympath Zing Brother. S. R.

To BARBARA HAMILTON. (44)
Loving Sister.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I have heard with grief, that Newcastle has
taken one more, in a bloody account, then before; even your Son in Law, and my
friend. But I hope ye have learned that much of Christ, as not to look to
wheels rolled round about on earth: Earthen vessels are not to dispute with
their Former: pieces of sinning-clay may by reasoning and contending with the
Potter, mar the work of him, who has his fire in Zion and his furnace in
Jerusalem, as bullocks sweating and wrestling in the furrow make their yoke
more heavy: In quietness and rest ye shall be saved: If men do any thing
contrary to our heart, we may ask both who did it? And what is done? And why?
When God has done any such thing we are to enquire who has done it? And to
know that this comes from the Lord, who is wonderful in counsel: but we are
not to ask what? or why? If it be from the Lord [as certainly their is no evil
in the city without him Amos. 3. 6.] it is enough the fairest face of his
spotless way is but coming, and ye are to believe his works as well as his word.
Violent death is a sharer with Christ in his death, which was violent: it
makes not much what way we go to heaven: the happy home is all, where the
roughness of the way shall be forgotten: He is gone home to a friend's house
and made welcome, and the race is ended: Time is recompensed with eternity, and
copper with gold: God's order is in wisdom, the husband goes home before the
wife, and the throng of the marker shall be over ere it be long, and another
generation where we now are, and at length an empty house, and not one of
mankind shall be upon the earth within the sixth part of an hour after the
earth and the works that are therein shall be burnt up with fire: I fear more
that Christ is about to remove when he carries home so much of his plenishing
before hand: we cannot teach the Almighty knowledge: when he was directing the
bullet against his servant, to fetch out the soul, no wise man could cry to
God, Wrong, wrong Lord, for he is thine own: There is no mist over his eyes who
is wonderful in counsel: If Zion be builded with your son in law's blood, the
Lord [deep in counsel] can glue together the stones of Zion with blood, and
with that blood which is precious in his eyes: Christ has fewer laborers in
his vineyard then he had; but some more witnesses for his cause and the Lord's
Covenant with the three Nations. What is Christ's gain is not your loss: Let
not that which is his holy and wise will be your unbeleeving sorrow: Though I
really judge I had interest in his dead servant; yet because he now lives to
Christ, I quite the hops I had of his succesfull laboring in the ministry: I
know he now praises the grace that he was to preach: And if there were a
better thing on his head now in heaven then a crown, or any thing more
excellent then heaven, he would cast it down before his feet, who sits on
the throne: Give glory therefore to Christ as he now does, and say, Thy will
be done. The grace and consolation of Christ be with you.

MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to your La: though Christ lose no time; yet when
sinful men drive his chariot, the wheels of (...) chariot move slowly: The
woman Zion as soon as she traveled brought forth her children, yea Isa. 66: 7.
before she traveled she brought f^rth, before her pain came she was delivered
of a man-child: Yet the deliverance of the people was with the woman's going
with child seventy years, that is more then nine months: There be many
oppositions in carrying on the work; but I hope the Lord will build his own
Zion, and evidence to us that it is done not by might not by power, but by the
Spirit of the Lord. Madam, I have heard of your infirmities of body and
sickness: I know the issue shall be mercy to you, and that God's purpose, which
lies hidden underground to you, is, to commend the sweetness of his love, and
care to you from your youth: And if all the sad losses, trials, sicknesses,
infirmities, griefs, heaviness and inconstancy of the creature, be expounded
[as sure I am they are] the rods of the jealousy of an husband in heaven,
contending with all your lovers on earth (though there were millions of them)
for your love, to fetch more of your love home to heaven, to make it single,
unmixt and chaste to the fairest in heaven and earth, to Jesus the Prince of
ages, ye will forgive [to borrow that word] every rod of God, and not let the
Sun go down on your wrath against any messinger of your afflicting and
correcting Father. Since your La: cannot but see, that the mark at which Christ
has aimed at, these twenty four years and above, is, to have the company and
fellowship of such a sinful creature in heaven with him for all eternity, and
because he will not (such is the power of his love) enjoy his father's glory
and that crown due to him by eternal generation, without you by name, Ioh. 17:
24. Ioh. 10: 16. Ioh. 14: 3. Therefore Madam believe no evil of Christ: Listen
to no hard reports that his rods make of him to you: He has loved you and
washed you from your sins, and what would ye have more? Is that too little,
except he adjourne all crosses till ye be where ye shall be out of all capacity
to sigh or to be crossed? I hope ye can desire no more, no greater, nor more
excellent suit, then Christ and the fellowship of the Lamb for evermore: And if
that desire be answered in heaven (as I am sure it is, and ye cannot deny but
it is made sure to you) the want of these poor accidents of a living husband,
of many children, of an healthful body, of a life of case in the world,
without one knot in the rush, are nobly made up and may be comfortably born.
Grace, grace be with your La:

London. October. 16. 1645. Your La: at all obedience in Christ. S. R.

To a Christian friend upon the death of his wife. (46)
Worthy friend.
I Desire to suffer with you in the loss of a loving and good wife, now gone
before, [according to the method and order of him of whose understanding there
is no searching out] whither ye are to follow: He that made yesterday to go
before this day, and the former generation, in birth and life, to have been
before this present generation, and has made some flowers to grow and die and
wither in the month of May, and others in June, cannot be challenged in the
order he has made of things without souls: And some order he must keep also
here, that one might bury another: Therefore I hope ye shall be dumb and silent
because the Lord has done it: what creatures or under-causes do in sinful
mistakes, are ordered in wisdom by your Father, at whose feet your own soul and
your heaven lies, and so the days of your wife. If the place she has left
were any other then a prison of sin, and the home she is gone to, any other
then where her ^ead and Savior is King of the land, your grief had been more
rational; But I trust your faith of the resurrection of the dead in Christ, to
glory and immortality, will lead you to suspend your longing for her, till the
morning and dawning of that day, when the Archangel shall descend with a shout,
to gather all his prisoners out of the grave up to himself: To believe this is
best for you, and to be silent because he has done it, i^ your wisdom: It is
much to come out of the Lord's School of trial, wiser and more experienced in
the ways of God: And it is our happiness, when Christ opens a vein, he
takes nothing but ill blood from his sick ones: Christ has skill to do (and
if our corruption mar not) the art of mercy in correcting: we cannot of our
selves take away the tin, the lead and the scum that remains in us: And if
Christ be not Master-of-work, and if the furnace go it is alone, he not
standing nigh the melting of his own vessel, the labor were lost and the
founder should melt in vain: God knows some of us have lost much fire,
sweating and pains to our Lord Jesus, and the vessel is almost marred, the
furnace and rod of God spilt, and daylight burnt, and the reprobat metal not
taken away, so as some are to answer to the Majesty of God for the abuse of
many good crosses and rich afflictions lost without the quiet fruit of
righteousness: And it is a sad thing when the rod is cursed that never fruit
shall grow on it, and except Christ's d^w fall down, and his summer-sunshine,
and his grace follow afflictions, to cause them bring f^rth fruit to God, they
are so fruitless to us that our evil ground [rank and fat enough for briers]
casts up a crope of noisome weeds: The rod [as the prophet says, Ezekiel 7: 10,
11.] blossometh, pride buddeth forth, violence rises up into a rod of
wickedness, and all this has been my case under many rods since I saw you.
Grace be with you.

To a Christian Brother. (47)
Reverend and beloved in the Lord.
IT may be I have been too long silent, but I hope ye will not impute it to
forgetfulness of you. As I have heard of the death of your daughter with
heaviness of mind on your behalf, so am I much comforted, that she has
evidenced to your self and other witnesses, the hope of the resurrection of the
dead: as sown corn is not lost [for there is more hope of that which is sown,
then of that which is eaten. 1 Cor. 15. 42.] so also is it in the resurrection
of the dead; the body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it
is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. I hope ye wait for the crope and
harvest, 1 Thessalonians. 4. 14. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even
so also them which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him: then they are not
lost who are gathered in to that Congregation of the firstborn and the General
Assembly of the Saints: though we cannot outrun nor overtake them that are gone
before, yet we shall quickly follow them, and the difference is, that she has
the advantage of some months or years of the Crown, before you and her mother:
and we do not take it ill, if our children outrun us in the life of grace, why
then are we sad if they outstrip us in the attainment of the life of glory? It
would seem that there is more reason to grieve that children live behind us,
then that they are glorified and die before us: all the difference is in some
poor hungry accidents of-time, less or more, sooner or later: so the godly
child, though young, died of an hundred years old: and ye could not now have
bestowed her better, though the choice was Christ's, not yours: and I am sure,
Sir, ye cannot now say, she is married against the will of her parents; she
might more readily, if alive, fall in the hand of a worse husband, but can ye
think that she could have fallen in the hands of one better? and if Christ
marry with your house, it is your honor not any cause of grief, that Jesus
should portion any of yours ere she enjoy your portion, is it not great love?
the patrimony is more then any other could give as good a husband is
unpossible; to say a better, is blasphemy. The King and Prince of ages can keep
them better then ye can do: while she was alive, ye could entrust her to
Christ and recommend her to his keeping, now by an after-faith ye have resigned
her unto him, in whose bosom do sleep all that are dead in the Lord: ye would
havelent her to glorify the Lord upon earth, and he has borrowed her [with
promise to restore her again, 1 Cor. 15: 53. 1 Thessalonians. 4: 15. 16:] to be an
organ of the immediate glorifying of himself in heaven: sinless glorifying of
God is better then sinful glorifying of him. And sure your prayers concerning
her are fulfilled: I shall desire, if the Lord shall be pleased the same way to
dispose of her mother, that ye have the same mind: Christ cannot multiply
injuries upon you, if the fountain be the love of God (as I hope it is) ye are
enriched with losses. Ye know all I can say, better, before I was in Christ,
then I can express it. Grace be with you.

MISTRESS.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: If Death, which is before you and us all,
were any other thing but a friendly dissolution, and a change, not a
destruction of Life, it would seem a hard voyage to go through such a sad and
dark trance, so thorny a valley, as is the wages of sin: but I am confident,
the way ye know, though your foot never trod in that black shadow: the loss of
life is gain to you: if Christ Jesus be the period, the end and lodging-home at
the end of your journey, there is no fear ye go to a friend: and since ye have
had a communion with him in this life, and he has a pawn and pledge of yours,
even the largest share of your love and heart, ye may look Death in the face
with joy: If the heart be in heaven, the remnant of you cannot be kept the
prisoner of the second Death. But though he be the same Christ in the other
life, ye found him to be here, yet he is so far in his excellency, beauty,
sweetness, irradiations and beams of Majesty, above what he appeared here, when
he is seen as he is, that ye shall misken him, and he shall appear a new
Christ, and his kisses, breathings, embracements, the perfume; the ointment of
his name poured out on you, shall appear to have more of God, and a stronger
smell of heaven, of eternity, of a Godhead, of Majesty and glory there, then
here: As water at the fountain, apples in the orchard and beside the tree, have
more of their native sweetness, taste and beauty, then when transported to us
some hundred miles. I mean not that Christ can lose any of his sweetness in the
carrying, or that he in his Godhead and lovileness of presence, can be changed
to the worse, betwixt the little spot of the earth ye are in, and the right
hand of the father far above all heavens; but the change will be in you, when
ye shall have new senses, and the soul shall be a more deep and more capacious
vessel to take in more of Christ; and when means, the chariot, the Gospel that
he is now carried in, and ordinances that conveigh him, shall be removed: sure
ye cannot now be said to see him face to face, or to drink of the wine of the
highest fountain, or to take in seas and tides of fresh love, immediately,
without vessels, mids's or messengers, at the fountain it self, as ye shall do
a few days hence: when ye shall be so near as to be with Christ, Luke 23: 43,
Ioh, 17: 24. Phil. 1: 23. 1 Thessalonians. 4: 17. ye would no doubt bestow a days
journey, yea, many days journey on earth, to go up to heaven and fetch down
any thing of Christ: how much more may ye be willing to make a journey, to go
in person to heaven [it is not lost time, but gained eternity] to enjoy the
full Godhead, and then in such a manner as he is not there in his week-dayes
apparel, as he is here with us, in a drop or the tenth part of a night's dewing
of grace and sweetness, but he is there in his Marriagerobe of glory, richer,
more costly, more precious, in one hem or button of that garment of
fountain-majesty, then a million of worlds. O the well is deep! ye shall then
think that Preachers and sinful Ambassadors on earth, did but spill and mar
his praises, when they spoke of him and preached his beauty. Alas! we but make
Christ black and less lovely, in making such insignificant and dry and cold and
low expressions of his highest and transcendent super-excellency, to the
daughters of Jerusalem. Sure, I have often for my own part sinned in this
thing: No doubt, Angels do not fulfill their task according to their
obligation, in that Christ kept their feet from falling with the lost Devils,
though I know they are not behind in going to the utmost of created power: but
there is sin in our praising, and sin in the quantity, besides other sins: but
I must leave this, it is too deep for me: Go and see and we desire to go with
you: But we are not masters of our own diet. If in that last journey ye tread
on a serpent in the way, and thereby wound your heel, as Jesus Christ did
before you, the print of the wound shall not be known at the resurrection of
the just. Death is but an aw^om step over Time and Sin to sweet Jesus Christ,
who knew and felt the worst of Death, for Death's teeth hurt him: We know Death
has no teeth now, no jaws, for they are broken: it is a free prison, Citizens
pay nothing for the Grave, the Jailer who had the power of Death is destroyed,
praise and glory be to the first begotten of the dead. The worst possibly that
may be, is, that ye leave behind you, children, husband, and the Church of God
in miseries; but ye cannot get them to heaven with you for the present, ye
shall not miss them, and Christ cannot miscount one of the poorest of his
lambs: no lad, no girl, no poor one shall be a missing, ere ye see them again,
in the day that the Son shall render up the Kingdom to his Father. The evening
and the shadow of every poor hireling is coming, the Church of Christ's Sun in
this life is declining Low, not a soul of the Militant company will be here
within few Generations, our Husband will send for them all. It is a rich mercy,
we are not married to Time longer then the course be finished. Ye may rejoice
that ye go not to heaven till ye know that Jesus is there before you, that
when ye come thither, at your first entry ye may find the smell of his
ointments, his Myrrh, Aloe^s and Cassia: and this first salutation of his will
make you find, it is no uncomfortable thing to die. Go and enjoy your gain,
live on Christ's love while ye are here, and all the way, as for the Church ye
leave behind you, the Government is upon Christ's shoulders, and he will plead
for the blood of his Saints: The bush has been burning above five thousand
years and we never yet saw the ashes of this fire: yet a little while and the
vision shall not tarry, it shall speak and not lie. I am more afraid of my
duty, then of the Head, Christ's government, he cannot fail to bring judgment
to victory. O that we could wait for our hidden life! O that Christ would
remove the covering, draw aside the curtain of time, and rent the heavens and
come down! O that shadows and night were gone, that the day would break, and he
that feeds among the lilies would cry to his heavenly trumpetters, mark
ready, let us go down and fold together the four corners of the world and
marry the Bride. His grace be with you. Now if I have found favor with you and
if ye judge me faithful, my last suit to you is, that ye would leave me a
legacy, and that is, that my name be at the very last in your prayers, as I
desire also it may be in the prayers of these of your Christian Acquaintance
with whom ye have been intimate.

London. Jan. 9. 1646. Your Brother in his own Lord Jesus, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (49)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: It is the least of the princely and royal
bounty of Jesus Christ, to pay a King's debts and not to have his servants at a
loss: his gold is better then yours, and his hundred fold is the in-come and
rent of heaven and far above your revenues: ye are not the first who have
casten up your accounts that way: better have Christ your factor then any
other, for he tradeth to the advantage of his poor servants. But if the hundred
fold in this life be so well told, as Christ cannot pay you with miscounting or
deferred hope, O what must the rent of that Land be, which rendereth every day,
and every hour of the years of long Eternity, the whole rent of a year, yea, of
more then thousand thousands of ages, even the weighty in-come of a rich
Kingdom, not every summer once, but every moment! That sum of glory will take
you and all the Angels telling. To be a Tennant to such a Landlord, where
every berry and grape of the large field bears no worse fruit then glory,
fullness of joy and pleasures that endure for evermore, I leave it to your self
to think what a summer, what a soil, what a garden, must be there, and what
must be the commodities of that highest Land, where Sun and Moon are under the
feet of the inhabitants: Surely the Land cannot be bought with gold, blood,
banishment, loss of father and mother, husband, wife, children: We but dwell
here because we can do no better; it is need, not virtue, to be sojourners in
a prison; to weep and sigh, and Alas! to sin 60 or 70 years in a land of tears:
the fruits that grow here are all seasoned and salted with sin. O how sweet
is it that the company of the first born should be divided in two great bodies
of an Army, and some in their country, and some in the way to their country!
If it were no more but to see once the face of the Prince of this good land,
and to be feasted for eternity with the fatness, sweetness, dainties of the
rays and beams of matchless glory and incomparable fountain-love, it were a
well spent journey to creep, hands and feet, through seven deaths and seven
hells, to enjoy him up at the wellhead. Only let us not weary, the miles to
that Land are fewer and shorter then when we first believed: strangers are not
wise to quarrel with their Host and complain of their lodging; it is a foul way,
but a fair home. O that I had but such grapes and clusters out of the Land, as
I have sometime seen and tasted in the place where of your La: makes mention!
but the hope of it in the end is a heartsom convoy in the way: if I see little
more of the gold till the race be ended, I dare not quarrel: it is the Lord: I
hope his chariot shall go through these three Kingdoms, after our suffering
shall be accomplished. Grace be with you.

London. Jan. 26. 1646 Your La: in Jesus Christ, S. R.

To Mr I. G. (50)
Reverend and dear Brother
I shall with my soul desire the peace of these Kingdoms, and I do believe, it
shall at last come as a river and as the mighty waves of the sea; but O that we
were ripe and in readiness to receive it! The preserving of two or three or
four or five berries in the outmost boughs of the Olive Tree after the vintage,
is like to be a great matter ere all be done: yet I know, a Cluster in both
Kingdoms shall be saved, for a blessing is in it: but it is not [I fear] so
near to the dawning of the day of Salvation, but that the clouds must send down
more showers of blood, to water the vineyard of the Lord, and to cause it to
blossom. Scotland's scum is not yet removed, nor is England's dross and tin
taken away, nor the filth of our blood purged by the spirit of judgment and
the spirit of Burning. But I am too much on this sad subject. As for my self, I
do esteem nothing out of heaven and next to a communion with Jesus Christ,
more, then to be in the hearts and prayers of the saints: I know, he feeds
there amongst the lies till the day break: but I am at a low ebb, as to any
sensible communion with Christ, yea, as low as any soul can be, and do scarce
know where I am, and do now make it a Question, If any can go to him who
dwells in light inaccessible through nothing but darkness? Sure, all that
come to heaven have a stock in Christ, but I know not where mine is: It cannot
be enough for me to believe the Salvation of others, and to know Christ to be
the honeycomb, the Rose of Sharon, the Paradise and Eden of the Saints and
firstborn written in heaven, and not to see afar the borders of that good
land: But what shall I say? Either this is the Lord making grace a new
creation, where there is pure nothing and sinful nothing to work upon, or I am
gone. I should count my soul engaged to your self and others there with you, if
ye would but carry to Christ for me a letter of ciphers and nonsense [for I
know not how to make language of my condition] only showing that I have need
of his love; for I know, many fair and washen ones stand now in white before
the throne, who were once as black as I am. If Christ pass his word to wash a
sinner, it is less to him then a word to make fair Angels of black Devils:
Only let the art of free Grace be engaged. I have not a Cautioner to give
Surety, nor does a Mediator, such as he is in all perfection, need a Mediator:
But what I need, he knows: only, it is his depth of wisdom to let some pass
millions of miles over score in debt, that they may stand between the winning
and the losing, in need of more then ordinary free grace. Christ has been
multiplying Grace and Mercy above these sive thousand years, and the latter
born heirs have so much greater guiltiness, that Christ has passed more
experiments and multiplied essays of heart-love on others, by misbeleeving,
after it is past all question many hundreds of ages, that Christ is the
undeniable and now uncontroverted Treasurer of multiplied redemptions; so now
he is saying, The more of the disease there is, the more of the Physician's art
of Grace and tenderness, there must be: Only I know, no sinner can put
infinite Grace to it, so as the Mediator shall have difficulty or much ado to
save this or that man: Millions of hells of sinners cannot come near to exhaust
infinite Grace. I pray you [remembring my love to your wife and friends there]
let me find that I have Sollicitors there amongst your acquaintance, and
forget not Scotland.

To my Lady KENMURE. [51]
MADAM.
IT is too like, the Lord's controversy with these two Nations is but yet
beginning, and that we are ripened and white for the Lord's sickle. For the
particular condition your La: is in, another might speak, (if they would say
all) of more sad things. If there were not a fountain of free Grace to water
the dry ground and an uncreated wind to breath on withered and dry bones, we
were gone. The wheels of Christ's Chariot to pluck us out of the womb of many
deaths, are winged like Eagles. All I have, is, to desire to believe that
Christ will show all good will to save, and as for your La: I know that the
Lord Jesus carries on no design against you, but seeks you to save and
redeem you: He lies not in wait for your falls, except it be to take you up:
His way of redeeming is ravishing and taking: There are more miracles of
glorified sinners in heaven, then can be on the earth. Nothing of you, Madam,
nay not your leaf can wither: Verily it is a King's life to follow the Lamb:
But when ye see him in his own country at home, ye will think ye never saw him
before: He shall be admired of all them that believe, 2 Thessalonians 1: 10. Ye may
judge how far all your now sad days and tossings, changes, losses, wants
conflicts, shall then be below you. Ye look to the Cross, now it is above your
head and seems to threaten Death as having a Dominion; but it shall then be ^o
far below your thoughts, or your thoughts so far above it, that ye shall have
no leisure to lend one thought to old-dated crosses, in youth, in age, in this
country or in that, from this instrumet or from another, except it be to the
heightning of your consolation; being now got above and beyond all these. Old
age and waxing old as a garment is written on the fairest face of the Creation,
Psalm. 102: 26, 27. Death from Adam to the second Adam's appearance plays the
King and reigns over all, the prime heir died, his children which the Lord
has given follow him; and we may speak freely of the life which is here, were
it heaven, there were not much gain in godliness: but there a is a rest for the
people of God, Christ-man possesses it now 1600. years before many of his
members, but it wears not out. Grace be with you.

London. Febr. 16. 1646. Your La: in his sweet Lord, S. R.

To the Lady ARDROSS. (52)
MADAM.
GRace, mercy and peace be to you: It has seemed good [as I hear] to him who
has appointed a bounds for the number of our months, to gather-in a sheaf of
ripe corn [in the death of your Christian Mother] into his garner: It Is the
more evident that winter is near, when apples without violence of wind, do of
their own accord fall off the tree. She is now above the winter, with a little
change of place, not of a Savior, only she enjoys him now without messages
and in his own immediate presence, from whom she heard by letters and messengers
before. I grant, Death is to her a very new thing, but Heaven was prepared of
old: and Christ, as enjoyed in his highest throne and as loade^ with glory and
incomparably exalted above men and Angels, having such a heavenly Circle of
glorified harpers and Musicians above, compassing the throne with a song, is to
her a new thing; but so new, as the first summer-rose or the first fruits of
that heavenly field, or as a new Paradise to a traveller broken and worn out of
breath with the sad occurrences of a long and dirty way. Ye may easily judge,
Madam, what a large recompense is made to all her service, her walking with
God, and her sorrows, with the first cast of the soul's eye upon the shining
and admirably beautiful face of the Lamb that is in the midst of that fair and
white Army that is there, and with the first draught and taste of the fountain
of life fresh and new at the wellhead: To say nothing of the enjoying of that
face without a date, for more then this term of life which we now enjoy. And
it cost her no more to go thither, but to suffer Death to do her this piece
of service: For by him who was dead and is alive, she was delivered from the
second death: What then is the first death to the second? Not a scratch of the
hide of a singer, to the endless second death. And now she ^itteth for eternity
meal-free, in a very considerable Land, which has more then four summers in
the year: O what Springtime is there! Even the smelling of the odours of that
great and eternally blooming Rose of Sharon for ever and ever? What a singing
life is there? There is not a dumb bird in all that large field, but all sing
and breath out heaven, joy, glory, dominion, to the high Prince of that new
found Land. And verily the Land is the sweeter, that Jesus Christ paid so dear
a rent for it, and he is the glory of the Land. All which, I hope, does not so
much mitigate and alley your grief for her part [and truly this should seem
sufficient] as the unerring exprctation of the dawning of that day upon your
self, and the hope ye have the the fruition of that same King and Kingdom to
your own soul: Certainly, the hope of it when things look so dark-like on both
Kingdoms, must be an exceeding great quickening to languishing spirits, who are
far from home while we are here. What misery to have both a bad way all the
day, and no hope of lodging at night? But He has taken up your lodging for
you. I can say no more now but I pray that the very God of peace may establish
your heart to the end. I rest.

London. Febr. 24. 1646. MADAM. Your La: at all respective obedience in the
Lord. S. R.

To M. O. (53)
Sir.
I can write nothing for the present concerning these times [what ever others
may think] but that which speaks wrath and judgment to these Kingdoms. If
ever ye, or any of that Land received the Gospel in truth [as I am confident,
ye and they did] there is here a great departure from that faith, and our
sufferings are not yet at an end. However, I dare testify and die for it, that
once Christ was revealed in the power of his excelency and glory to the saints
there, and in Scotland, of which (...) was a witness. I pray God, none dceeive
you or take the crown from you: Hell or the gates of Hell cannot ravel, mar, or
undo what Christ has once done amongst you. It may be that I am incapable of
new light, and cannot receive that Spirit [whereof some vainly boast) but that
which was from the beginning which we have heard, which we have seen with our
eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, even the word of
life, 1 Ioh. 1: 2, 3. has been declared to you: Thousands of thousands walking
in that light and that good old way, have gone to heaven and are now before the
throne: Truth is but one, and has no numbers. Christ and Antichrist are both
now in the camp, and are come to open blows: Christ's poor ship saileth in a
sea of blood, the passengers are so sea-sick of a high fever, that they miscall
one another, Christ [I hope] shall bring the broken bark to land: I had rather
swim for life and death on an old plank, or a broken board, to land with
Christ, then enjoy the rotten peace we have hitherto had. It is like, the Lord
will take a severe course with us, to cause the children of the family agree
together. I conceive that Christ has a great design of free grace to these
Lands; but his wheels must move over mountains and rocks: He never yet wooed a
Bride on earth, but in blood, in fire, and in the wilderness. A cross of our
own choosing, honeyed and sugared with consolations, we cannot have: I think not
much of a cross when all the children of the house weep with me and for me, and
to suffer when we enjoy the communion of Saints, is not much; but it is hard
when Saints rejoice in the suffering of Saints and redeemed ones hurt, yea,
even go nigh to hate redeemed ones. I confess, I imagined there had no more
been such an affliction on earth, or in the world, then that one elect Angel
should fight against another: but for contempt of the communion of Saints, we
have need of newborn crosses, scarce ever heard of before: the saints are not
Christ, there is no misjudging in him, there is much in us, and a doubt it is,
if we shall have fully one heart till we enjoy one heaven: our starlight hides
us from our selves, and hides us one from another, and Christ from us all; but
he will not be hidden from us. I shall wish that all the sons of our father in
that Land be of one mind, and that they be not shaken nor moved from the Truth
once received: Christ was in that Gospel, and Christ is the same now that he
was in the Prelates time: That Gospel cannot sink, it will make you free and
bear you out. Christ, the subject of it, is the chosen of God, and comes from
Bozrah, with garments dyed in blood. Ireland and Scotland both must be his
field in which he shall feed and gather lilies: suppose [which yet is
impossible] that some had an eternity of Christ in Ireland, and a sweet summer
of the Gospel, and a feast of fat things for evermore in Ireland, and one
should never come to heaven, it should be a desirable life; the King's
spikenard, Christ's perfume, his apples of love, his ointments, even down in
this lower house of clay, are a choice heaven: O what then is the King in his
own land! where there is such a throne, so many Kings palaces, ten thousand
thousands of crowns of glory that want heads yet to fill them: O so much
leisure as shall be there to sing! O such a tree as grows there in the midst
of that paradise, where the inhabitants sing eternally under it is branches! To
look in at a window and see the branches burdened with the apples of life, to
be the last man that shall come in thither, were too much for me. I pray you
remember me to the Christians there and remember our private Covenant. Grace be
with you.

London April 17. 1646. Your friend in the Lord Jesus, S. R.

To EARLESTOWN Elder. (54)
Sir.
I Know ye have learned long ago, ere I knew any thing of Christ, that if we
had the Cross at our own election, we would either have law-surety for freedom
from it, or then we would have it honeyed and sugared with comforts, so, as the
sweet should over-master the gall and wormwood. Christ knows how to breed the
sons of his house, and ye will give him leave to take his own way of
dispensation with you, and though it be rough, forgive him: he defieth you to
have as much patience to him, as he has born to you. I am sure, there cannot a
dram-weight of gall be less in your cup, and ye would not desire, he sold both
afflict you and hurt your soul. When his people cannot have a Providence of
silk and roses, they must be content with such an one as he carveth out for
them: ye would not go to heaven but with company, and ye may perceive that the
way of these who went before you, was through blood, sufferings, and many
afflictions: Nay, Christ, the Captain, went in over the doorthreshold of
Paradise, bleeding to death. I do not think but ye have learned to stoop,
though ye (as others) be naturally stiff, and that ye have found that the
apples and sweet fruits which grow on that crabbed tree of the Cross are as
sweet as it is so ^re to bear it; especially considering that Christ has born
the whole complete Cross, and his Saints bear but bits and chipes, as the
Apostle says The remnants or leavings of the Cross. I Judge you ten thousand
times happy that ever ye was Grace's debtor, for certainly Christ has engaged
you over head and ears to free Grace, and take the debt with you to Eternity,
Immanuel's. highest land, where ye find before you a house-full of Christ's
everlasting debtors; the less shame to you. Yea, and this lower Kingdom of
Grace is but Christ's Hospital and Guest-house of sick folks, whom the brave
and noble Physician Christ has cured upon a venture of life and death. And if
ye be near the waterside [as I know ye are] all that I can say is this, Sir,
that I feel by the smell of that land which is before you, that it is a goodly
Country, and it is well payed-for to your hand, and he is before you who will
heartily welcome you. O to suck these breasts of full consolation above, and to
drink Christ's new wine up in his father's house, is some greater matter then
is believed! since it was brewed from eternity for the head of the house, and
so many thousand crowned Kings: Rubs in the way where the lodging is so good
are not much. He that brought again from the dead the great Shepherd of the
sheep, by the blood of the eternal Covenant, establish you to the end.

London May 15. 1646. Your friend and servant in Christ Jesus, S. R.

To his reverend and worthy Brother Mr G. GILLESPIE. (55)
Reverend and dear Brother.
I Cannot speak to you: the way ye know the passage is free and not stopped,
the print of the footsteps of the forerunner is clear and manifest, many have
gone before you: Ye will not sleep long in the dust before the day break: it is
a far shorter piece of the hinder-end of the night to you, then to Abraham and
Moses, beside all the time of their bodies resting under curruption, it is as
long yet to their day as to your morning light of awaking to glory; though
their spirits having the advantage of yours, have had now the fore-start of the
shore before you. I dare say nothing against his dispensation: I hope to follow
quickly: The heirs that are not there before you, are posting with haste after
you, and none shall take your lodging over your head. Be not heavy, the life of
faith is now called for: doing was never reckoned in your accounts, (though
Christ in and by you has done more, then by twenty, yea an hundred gray-haired
and godly Pastors) believing now is your last: Look to that word: Gal. 2: v.
20. Nevertheless I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me: Ye know the I that
lives, and the I that lives not: It is not single Ye that lives, Christ by
law lives in the broken debtor: It is not a life by doing or holy walking, but
the living of Christ in you: If ye look to your self as divided from Christ, ye
must be more then heavy: All your wants [dear Brother] be upon him, ye are his
debtor, Grace must sum and subscribe your accounts as paid: stand not upon
Items, and small or little Sanctification: ye know, inherent Holiness must
stand by, when imputed is all. I fear the clay-house is a-taking down and
undermining; but it is nigh the dawning, look to the East, the dawning of glory
is near: your Guide is good company and knows all the miles and the up's and
down's in the way; the nearer the morning, the darker. Some traveller sees the
city 20 miles off and at a distance; and yet within the eight part of a mile,
he cannot see it. It is all keeping, that ye would now have, till ye need it:
and if sense and fruition come both at once, it is not your loss: let Christ
tutour you as he thinks good; ye cannot be marred nor miscarry in his hand.
Want is an excellent qualification, and no money, no price, to you [who, I
know, dare not glory in your own righteousness] is ritness warrantable enough
to cast your self upon him who justifies the ungodly. Some see the gold once,
and never again till the race's end: it is coming all in a sum together, when
ye are in a more gracious capacity to tell it then now. Ye are not come to the
mount that burns with fire, nor unto blackness, darkness and tempest; but ye
are come to mount Zion, unto the city of the living God, the heavenly
Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels, to the general Assembly and
Church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of
all, and the Spirits of just men made perfect, and to Jesus the Mediator of the
new Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, etc. Ye must leave the wife to a
more choice husband, and the children to a better father. If ye leave any
testimony to the Lord's work and Covenant, against both Malignants and
Sectaries [which I suppose may be needfull] let it be under your hand and
subscribed before faithful witnesses.

St Andrews. Sept. 27. 1648. Your loving and afflicted Brother, S. R.

To Mistress GILLESPIE. (56)
Dear Sister.
I have heard how the Lord has visited you in removing the child Archibald. I
hope ye see the setting down of the weight of your confidence and affection
upon any created thing, whether husband or child, is a deceiving thing, and
that the Creature is not able to bear your weight, but sinketh down to very
nothing under your confidence: and therefore ye are Christ's debtor for all
providence of this kind, even in that he builds an hedge of thorns in your
way, for so ye see, his gracious intention is to save you [If I may say so]
whether ye will or not. It is a rich mercy that the Lord Christ will be Master
of your will and of all your delights, and that his way is so fair for the
landing of husband and children beforehand in the country wherherto ye are
journeying. No matter, how little ye be engaged to the world, since ye have
such experience of crossdealing in it: had ye been a child of the house, the
world would have dealt more warmly with it is own: there is less of you out of
heaven that the child is there and the husband is there, but much more that
your Head and Kinsman and Redeemer does fetch home such as are in danger to be
lost: and from this time forward, fetch not your comforts from such broken
cisterns and dry wells: if the Lord pull at the rest, ye must not be the
creature that shall hold when he draws. Truly to me your case is more
comfortable, then if the fireside were well plenished with ten children: the
Lord saw ye was able by his grace to bear the loss of husband and child, and
that ye are that weak and tender as not to be able to stand under the mercy of
a gracious husband living, and flourishing in esteem with Authority, and in
reputation for Godliness and Learning: for he knows the weight of these
mercies would crush you and break you: and a there is no searching out of his
understanding, so he has skill to know what providence will make Christ
dearest to you: and let not your heart say, it is an ill wa^led dispensation:
sure Christ who has seven eyes, had before him, the good of a living husband
and children for Margaret Murray, and the good of a removed husband and
children translated to glory; now he has opened his decree to you: say, Christ
has made for me a wise and gracious choice, and I have not one word to say on
the contrary. Let not your heart charge any thing, or Unbeleef libell injuries
upon Christ; because he will not let you alone, nor give you leave to play the
idolatress with such as have not that right to your love that Christ has. I
should wish, at the reading of this that ye may fall down and make a surrender
of these that are gone and these that are yet alive, to him: and for you, let
him have all, and wait for himself, for he will come and will not tarry: live
by faith, and the peace of God guard your heart: he cannot die whose ye are. My
wife suffers with you and remembers her love to you.

St Andrews. August. 14. 1649 Your brother in Christ, S. R.

To the worthy and much honored Colonel G. KER. (57)
Much honored and truly worthy.
I hope I shall not need to show you that ye are in greater hazard from
yourself and your own spirit, which would be watched over [that your actings
for God may be clean, spiritual, purely for God, for the Prince of the Kings
of the earth] then ye can be in danger from your enemies. O how hard is it to
get the intentions so cut off from, and raised above the creature, as to be
without mixture of creature and carnall-interests, and to have the soul in
heavenly actings only, only eveing himself and acting from love to God
revealed to us in Jesus Christ! Ye will find your self, your delights, your
solid glory [far above the air and breathings of mouths, and the thin, short,
poor applauses of men] before you in God. All the creatures, all the swords,
all the hosts in Britain and in this poor glob of the habitable world, are but
under him single ciphers making no number, the product being nothing, and but
painted men and painted swords in a brod, without influence from him: And O
what of God is in Gideon's sword when it is the sword of the Lord! I wish a
sword from heaven to you, and orders from heaven to you to go out, and as much
peremptorinesse of a heavenly will, as to say and abide by it, I will not, I
shall not go out, except thou go with me. I desire not to be rash in judging,
but I am a stranger to the mind of Christ, If our Adversaries who have
unjustly invaded us be not now in the camp of these that make war with the
Lamb; but the lamb shall overcome them at length, for he is the Lord of Lords
and King of Kings, and they who are with him are called and chosen and
faithful: and though ye and I see but the dark side of God's dispensations
this day toward Britain, yet the fair beautiful and desirable close of it
must be the confederacy of the nations of the world with Britain's Lord of
Armies: and let me die in the co^forts of the faith of ^^i, that a throne shall
be set up for Christ in this Island of great Britain [which is and shall be a
garden more fruitful of trees of righteousness, and pays and shall pay more
thousands to the Lord of the vineyard then is paid in thrice the bounds of
great Britain upon the earth] And then there can be neither Papist, Prelate,
Caval^er, Malignant, nor Sectarie who dare draw a sword against him, that
sits upon the throne. Sir, I shall wish a clean Army so far as may be, that
the shout of a King, who has many crowns, may be among you, and that ye may
fight in faith and prevail with God first. Think it your glory to have a sword
to act, and suffer, and die (if it please him) so being ye may add any thing
to the declarative glory of Christ, the plant of renown, Immanuel God with us:
Happy and thrice blessed are they by whose actings, or blood, or pain, or loss;
the diadems and rubies of his highest and glorious crown (whose ye are) shall
gli^ter and shine in this quarter of the habitable world: Though he need not
Gilbert Ker nor his sword; yet this honor have ye with his redeemed soldiers,
to call Christ High Lord General, of whom ye hope for pay, and all areers well
told: Go on worthy Sir, in the courage of faith, following the Lamb, make not
haste unbeleevingly; but in hope and silence keep the watch tower and look out,
he will come in his own time, his salvation shall not tarry, he shall place
salvation in Britain's Zion, for Israel his glory. His good will who dwelt in
the bush and it burnt not, be yours, and with you, I am.

WHat I wrote to you before I spoke not upon any private warrant: I am where I
was, Cromwell and his [I shall not say but there may be, and are, several
sober and godly amongst them, who have either joined through misinformation, or
have gone along with the rest in the simplicity of their hearts, not knowing
any thing] fight in an unjust cause, against the Lord's secret ones: and now to
the trampling of the worship of God and persecuting the people of God in
England and Ireland, he has brought upon his score, the blood of the people of
God in Scotland: I entreat you, Dear Sir, as ye desire to be serviceable to
Jesus Christ, whose free grace prevented you, when ye were his enemy, go on
without fainting, equally eschewing all mixture with Sectaries and Malignants,
neither of the two shall ever be isntrumental to save the Lords people, or
build his house: And without prophesying or speaking further then he whose I
am, and whom I desire to serve in the Gospel of his son, shall warrant; I
desire to hope, and do believe there is a glory, and a majesty of the Prince
of the Kings of the earth, that shall shine and appear in great Britain, which
shall Darken all the glory of men, confound Sectaries and Malignants, and
rejoice the spirits of the followers of the Lamb, and dazzle the eyes of
beholders. Sir, I suppose that God is to gather Malignants and Sectaries ere
all be done, as sheaves in a barn-floor; and to bid the Daughter of Zion arise
and thresh: I hope ye will mix with none of them: I am abundantly satisfied
that our Army through the sinful miscarriage of men has fallen, and dare
say, it is a better and a more comfortable dispensation, then if the Lord had
given us the victory and the necks of the reproachers of the way of God,
because he has done it: For. 1. More blood, blasphemies, cruelty, treachery,
must be upon the accounts of the men, whose land the Lord forbade us to invade.
2. Victory is such a burdening and weighty mercy, that we have not strength to
bear it as yet. 3. That was not the Army nor Gideon's three hinderth, by whom
he is to save us. We must have one of the Lord's carving. 4. Our enemies on
both sides, are not enough hardened nor we enough mortified to multitude,
valor, and Creatures. Grace grace be with you.

IT is considerable; that the Lord may, and often does call to a work, and yet
hide himself, and try the faith of his own: If I conceive aright, the Lord has
called you to act against that enemy, and the withdrawers of their sword, in my
weak apprehension, add their seal unto, and take upon them the guilt of that
unjust invasion of this Land, made by Cromwell's Army, and of the blood of the
Lord's people in this Kingdom; since the sword put into the hand of his
Children is to execute wrath and vengeance upon evil doers: the Lord's time of
appearing for his broken Land, is reserved to the breathings of the Spirit of
the Lord, such as came upon Gideon and Sampson, and that is an Act of princely
and royal soveraignity in God: Ye are, Sir, to lay hold on opportunities of
providence and to wait for him. As for your parcular treating by your selves
with the invaders of our land, I have no mind to it, and do look upon their
way as a carriyng on of the mystery of iniquity [for Babylon is a seat of many
names] Sir, let this controversy stand undecided till the second appearance of
Jesus Christ, and our Appeal lie before the throne undiscussed till that day: I
hope to lie down in the grave, in the faith of the justness of our cause: I
speak nothing of the mantaining the greatness of men, not subordinate to the
Prince of the Kings of the earth: I Judge that the blood of the witnesses of
Jesus is found upon the skirts of this society; asweel as in Babylons skirts: I
believe the way of the Lord is Col: Gilbert Ker's strength, and glory, and
should be countent to want my part of him (which is, I confess, precious and
dear in Christ) so, he be spent in the service of him, who will anon make
inquisition for the blood of the truly godly, which these men have shedafter
fair warning that they were the godly of Scotland. Worthy Sir, believe, faint
not, set your shoulder under the glory of Jesus, that is misprised in Scotland,
and give a testimony for him, he has many names in Scotland who shall walk
with him in white: This despised Covenant shall ruin Malignants, Sectaries and
Atheis^s: Yet a little while and behold he comes, and walks in the
greatness of his strength, and his garments dyed with blood. Oh for the sad
and terrible day of the Lord upon England, their ships of Tarshish, their
fenced Cities, etc. because of a broken Covenant! A conference with the and
enemy, not to hinder Acting [O that the Lord would thereby or some other way
remove the cloud that is over you] if authority would concur, were to be
desired, but it can hardly be exspected; however in the way of duty and in the
silence of faith go on, if ye perish, ye are the first of the creation with
whom the Lord has taken that dispensation. I should humbly advise you Sir, to
look to that, Dying and behold we live, killed all the day long, and yet more
then conquerours. There shall be the heat and warmenesse of life in your
graves, and buried bones: But look not for the Lord's coming the higher way
only, for he may come the lower way: O how little of God do we see, and how
mysterious is he! Christ known is amongst the greatest secrets of God: Keep
your self in the love of God, and in order to that, as far in obedience and
subjection to the King (whose salvation and true happiness my soul desires)
and to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, and to the foundamentall
laws of this kingdom, as your Lord requires. Sir, ye are in the hearts and
prayers of the Lord's people in this kingdom, and in the other two: The Lord
has said, There is a blessing in the cluster of graps, destroy it not. Grace,
grace be upon the head of him that is separated from his brethren, and the
goodwill of him that dwelt in the bush be with you.

I know not why the people of God should not take notice of the bonds of any,
who have blood in readiness to be let out for his cause: And I judge it was
not of you, that ye died not in the undecided controversy, which the Lord of
the whole earth has with the men, whom he has sent against us. Dear and much
honored in the Lord, Let me entreat you to be far from the thoughts of leaving
this Land: I see it, and find it, that the Lord has covered the whole land
with a cloud in his anger; but though I have been tempted to the like, I had
rather be in Scotland, beside angry Jesus Christ, knowing he minds no evil to
us; then in any Eden or garden in the earth: If we can remain united with the
Lord's remant in the land, he lays up wrath for all sort of Adversaries in
Britain: Though I never see the glory of his glistering sword shining in
Britain, I would be solaced in the innocent thoughts [far from revenge] that
the saints shall dip their feet in the blood of the s^ain of the Lord: and
truly Sir, I suppose, ye cannot but come to these thoughts and weak desires,
before the hearer of prayers, for as little as ye think of, and value your
self: for me, if I could mind you in your bonds, I purpose not to stand to the
account ye give, or thoughts ye have, of your self; though I know ye are not in
a whit more or less before him (who weighs his own according to the weight
of imputed righteousness,] for my apprehensions. Christ cannot mistake you men
may, and the calculation and esteem of free grace makes you to be what ye are.
I hope to see you an everlastingly obliged debtor to him, whom ye shall praise,
but never pay: And truly, ye have no riches but that debt, and I know ye Love
to be engaged to Jesus Christ, the most excellent of creditors: much joy and
sweetness may ye have in standing written in his book: I desire to do it my
self, and I would have you also, highly to esteem the design of Christ, who
has raised the riches of the glory of so much grace, above the Circle of the
heaven of heavens out of very nothings, and contrived his thoughts of love, so,
that' lumps of glorified clay, should stand before him for all ages, the
burdenes and laden debtors of free, eternally free grace. Sir, ye cannot cast
the count of the rents of your so great inheritance of glory. Grace be with you.

Much honored and worthy Sir.
YOur chains now shine as much for Christ, the cause being his, as your sword
was made famous in acting for that cause: And blessed are such as can willingly
tender to Christ both action and blood, doing and suffering: Resisting unto
blood is little for that precious and never-enough exalted Redeemer, who when
ye were a buying, gave blood somewhat dearer then ye gave for him, even the
blood of God, Act. 20: 28. I know a man who upon the receipt of a letter that ye
were killed, and the people of God destroyed, wished that he might be quickly
under the wall of the higher palace, from under the dint of the storm, and who
longed to have the weather-beaten and crazie bark safely landed in that harbor
of eternal quietness. What further service Christ has for you I know not, it
is enough, in that your captivity ye offer your service to Christ; but if I see
any thing it looks like a merciful defeat. I see the Nobles and the State
falling off from Christ, and the night coming upon the Prophets, which we would
pray to prevent, because it is a rare thing to see a fallen star win ever up
again to the firmament to shine: And what if this be the thick darkness going
before the break of day. Sure, Sir, the Sun shall rise upon Scotland; but if I
shall see it, or how near it is to day, I leave that to him, even unto Jehovah,
who creats upon every dwelling in mount Sion, and upon her assemblies a cloud,
and a smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night. But, Sir, the
wilderness shall rejoice and blossom as a rose, and happy he, who has a bone
or an arm, to put the Crown upon the head of our highest King, whose chariot is
paved with love: were there ten thousand millions of heavens created above
these highest heavens, and again and as many above them, and as many above
them, till Angels were wearied with counting, it were but too low a seat to fix
the princely throne of that Lord Jesus [whose ye are] above them all: Created
heavens are too low a seat of majesty for him. Since then there is none equal
to your master and Prince, who has chosen out for you amongst many sufferings
for sin, that only cross, which comes nearest in liknesse to his own cross,
watered with consolations, take courage, and comfort your self in him who has
chosen you to glory hereafter and to a conformity with him here: we fools would
have a cross of our own choosing, and would have our gall and wormwood sugared,
our fire cold, and our death and grave warmed with heat of life; but he who
has brought many children to glory and lost none, is our best Tutour. I wish
when I am sick that he may be keeper and comforter. I judge it a blessed fall,
that we are forfaited Heirs, broken and out of credit, and that Christ is
become a Tutour in the place of Freewill, and that we are no more our own. I am
broken and wasted with the wrath that is on the land, and have been much
tempted with a design to have a Pass from Christ, which if I had, I would not
stay to be a witness of our defection for no man's entreaty; but I know it is
my softness and weakness who would ever be ashore when a fit of sea-sickness
comes on; Though I know I shall come soon-enough to that desirable country,
and shall not be displaced, none shall take my lodging. Sir, many eyes are upon
you, and the Godly are exceedingly refreshed that ye listen not to the ways of
many about you, who with fair words make merchandise of souls. Sir, if the way
you are in be not the way of Christ, then woe to me, for I am eternally lost;
but truly, the Lord Christ's dealing with with Col: Gilbert Ker has proven to
me that the new restament and the covenant of grace is a piece, that a solemn
meeting and assembly of all created Angels, join all their wits together,
could not have devised: fince Sir, ye paid nothing for the change that Christ
made, and ye will take that debt of free grace to heaven with you, [for what
was Christ Jesus indebted to you more then to all your kindred and name?]
Therefore since ye are made his own, follow no other way. What is my salvation
though I should lay it in pawn, [It is but a poor pledge] that this, this
only is the way; but Christ is surety himself that it is the way, the
forerunner went before you, and he is safely landed, and there is a fair
company before you of such as have come out of great tribulation, and have
washed their garments, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; to whom
these promises are now performed, he that overcomes shall eat of the tree of
life, that is in the midst of the Paradise of God, and God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
crying, neither shall therebe any more pain: He that siteth on the throne shall
dwell among them; they shall hunger no more neither thirst any more, neither
shall the sun light on them, nor any heat; for the lamb that is in the midst of
the throne shall feed them and shall take them unto the living fountains of
waters. I may, Sir, possibly keep you from better work: The God of peace that
brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood
of the eternal covenant, make you perfect.

I have heard of your continued captivity in England as well as in this
afllicted land; but go where ye will, ye cannot go from under your shadow,
which is broader then many Kingdoms: Ye change lodgings and countries, but the
same Lord is before you: if ye were carried away captive to the other fide of
the sun, or as far as the rising of the morningstar; It is spoken to your
Mother who has yet received no bill of divorce, which was written to Judah.
Mic: 4: 10: Be in pain and labor to bring forth, O Daughter of Zion, like a
woman in travel: for now shall thou go fort^out of the city, and thou shall
dwell in the field, and thou shall go even to Babylon, there shall thou be
delivered, there the Lord shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.
England shall be countable for you, to render you back, Isai. 44: 6. I will say
to the North give up, and to the South, keep not back. It Is a sermon that flesh
and blood laughteth at, Ezekiel. 37: 4. Prophecy upon these dry bones, and say
unto them; O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord! It is a preaching to the
cold grave. Thus says the Lord unto the bones, behold I will cause breath
enter into you, and ye shall live, and I will lay sine^s upon you, and bring
flesh upon you, and cover you with skin and put breath in you and ye shall
live. Rev. 20: 13. And the sed gave up the dead that were in it. Berwick must
render back the Scottish captives, and Col. Gilbert Ker with them. Isa. 43: v.
14 For thus says the Lord your Redeemer the holy one of Israel, for your sake
I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down all their Nobles, and the
Caldeans whose cry is in the ships. Deuteronomy. 30: 4. If any of them be driven out
to the utmost parts of heaven, from (...) will the Lord thy God gather thee,
and from thence will he fetch thee Zech. 8: 7. Thus says the Lord of hosts,
behold I will save my People from the cast country, and from the west
country, and I will bring them and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem,
and they shall be my People, and I will be their God in truth and in
righteousness. Sir, ye are both booked by the Lord, who writes up the People
Ps. 87: 5, 6. And counted to the Lord, as one of the house and stock. Ps. 22:
30. Fear not, faint not, all your hairs are numbered. It is the desire of the
People of God, that as your bonds hitherto have been exempla^y, to the
strengthening of the seeble, and to the stopping of the Mouth of the adversary,
without any declining to the right or left hand, so your sufferings in the
place ye now go to, may be [as we are confident in the Lord of you, and in
humility boast of his grace in you] savoury, convincing, and like unto this
honorable cause, that will prevail in Britain, contrary to all the
Machinations and counsels of Devils and men, and though there were no other ink
in the pen I now write with, but some dewing of my last cooling blood, this I
purpose [his grace, whose I am, enabling me] to Stand too. Sir, we desire to
adore no instruments, yet we conceive the shining and rays of grace from the
fountain Jesus Christ, the fullness of the Godhead, bestowed on sinfulmen, hold
forth the good thoughts of Christ to this poor land, whose multipied graves,
and whose souls under the Altar, slain by Sestaries and Malignants, cry aloud
to heaven: I see nothing Sir, if the Lord be not near [though I dare not say
how soon] to awak for the year of Zion's controversy, Isai. 34: 5. for my
sword shall be bathed in heaven. behold it shall come down upon England and the
residue of his enemies in Scotland. Woe is me for England, that land shall be
soaked with blood, and their dust made fat with fatness: That pleasant land
shall be wilderness, and the dust of their land pitch: A judgment upon their
walled towns' the pleasant feilds, their strong ships etc, if they do not
repent. Ye have not I conceive, seen such searching and trying times as now
these are, and yet the question will be drawn to a more narrow state and
multitudes will yet leave the cause; for we took all in to the Covenant that
offered to build with us, but Christ must have but a small remnant: few Nobles
if any, few Ministers, few Professors; though our way stands unchanged, 2
Cor. 6: 8. by honor and di honor by good report and evil report, as dece^ers
and yet true, as unknown and yet well known, as dying and behold we live, as
chastned and yet not killed. Neither is this your condition alone, but the
experienced lot of all the saints that have gone before you. It is one and the
same cross of Christ, but there be sundry faces and diverse circumstances in
the same remnant, the sufferings of Christ, and yours. Sir, to be delivered to
Soldiers, and in captivity, looks like his sufferings, of whom Isaiah says
Chap. 53: 8. he was taken from prison, and from judgment, yea and taken bound,
Ioh. 18: 12. when the cause is the truth of God, the luster and face of
suffering is so much the more lovely, that it has the hew and color of
Christ's sufferings, who endured contradiction of sinners, and despised the
shame: O it is a great word, Christ shamed and Christ abased! but thus was the
Head and so are the members dealt with in the world: and truly any thing of
Christ even the worst of him (to speak so) his reproach and shame are lovely.
Though superstitious love to the material cross he suffered upon, be foolery,
and doting upon the holy grave be cursed idolatry; yet is there a communion
with him in his sufferings most desirable, 1 Pet. 4: 15. but rejoice in as much
as ye are Partakers of Christ's sufferings: in which sense, the cup that his
lip touched, has the sweeter taste, even though death were in it: The grave,
because He did lie in it, is so much the softer, and the more refreshfull a bed
of rest: And that part of the sky and clouds that the Beloved shall break
through and come to judgment, it is as lovely a piece of the created heaven as
any is, if we may love the ground he goes on the better; But all this is to be
understood in a spiritual manner. The Lord calls you, Sir, [upon whom the
Spirit of God and his glory resteth] to put your soul's Amen to this
dispensation, and requires of us that our desires follow the now-declared
decree of God concerning the desolation of our sinful land, so many ways
guilty of a despised Gospel and a broken Covenant, and that with all
submission: Certainly no man has failed more in this thing then he who writes
to you; for I have brought my health in great hazard, and tormented my spirit
with excessive grief so* our present provocations and the rentings of our Kirk;
and I see it is a challenging of, and a bold pleading against him, upon whose
^er the government is, Isa. 22: 2^. The Father has ^ut a glorious (...) (...)
Christ, v. 23. and I will fasten him as a na^ a sure place, and he shall be for
a glorious throne to his Father's house. v. 24. And they shall hang upon him
all the glory of his Father's house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels
of small quantity; from the vessels of cups even to all the vessels of slagons.
Our unbeleeving apprehensions do so quarrel at the prosperity of enemies in an
evil cause, that we wrestle with defeat^, spoiling, captivity of the Godly,
killing of his people, the wasting of our land, starving and famishing of the
Kingdom, which is worse then the sword; but this is a sinful coutradicting of
the Lord's revealed decree: His wisdom says Spoiling and desolation is best
for Scotland, and we say, Not, and so accuse Christ of misgovernment, and of
not being true to the trust put upon him: But since he does not drag the
government at his heels, but has it upon his shoulder, and since the (...)
fastened in a sure place cannot be broken, nor can the smallest vessel fail to
find sweet security in dependence upon him, since all the weight of heaven and
earth, of redeemed saints and confirmed Angels, is upon his shoulder; I am a
fool, and brutish to imagine, that I can add any thing to Christ's special
care of and tenderness to his people: He who keeps the basins and knives of
his house, and bring^th the vessels back again to the second temple Ezra: 1: 8,
9, 10. must have a more tender care of his redeemed ones, then of a spoon, or
of Peter's old shoes, which yet must not be lost in his captivity Act. 12: 8. O
for grace to suffer Christ to tutour his own Minors and young Heirs! But we
cannot endure to be under the actings of his government: We love too much to be
our own: O how sweet to be wholly Christ's, and wholly in Christ! To be out of
the creatures owning, and made complete in Christ, to live by faith in Christ,
and to be once for all clo^ with the (...) Majesty and glory of the Son of God,
wherein he makes all his friends and followers sharers! To dwell in Immanuel's
high and blessed land, and live in that sweetest air, where no wind blows,
but the breathings of the Holy Ghost! No seas or sloods flow, but the pure
water of life, that proceeds from under the throne and from the Lamb: No
planting but the tree of life, that yields twelve manner of fruits every
month: What do we here but fin and suffer? O when shall the night be gene,
the shadows (...) away and the morning of that long, long day, without cloud or
night, dawn! The Spirit and the Bride say Co^, O when shall the Lamb's wife be
ready, and the Bridegroom say Come! Worthy Sir, I mind you to the hearer of
prayer, O help me in that kind! The Spirit of Jesus be with your Spirit.

GRace^ mercy and peace be to you: We are fallen in win^owing and trying times:
I am glad that your breath serves you to run to the end, in the same condition
and way wherein ye have walked these twenty years past: It is either the way of
peace, or, we are yet in our sins, and have missed the way: the Lord [it's
true] has stained the pride of all our glory, and now last of all the sun has
gone down upon many of the Prophets; but stumble not, men are men, and God
appears more and more to be God, and Christ it still Christ. Madam, stronger
then I am, had, almost stumbled me and cast me down; But O what mercy is it, to
discern betwixt what is Christ's and what is man's, and what way the hew,
color and luster of gifts and grace, dazzle and deceive our weak eyes! Oh to be
dead to all things that are below Christ, were it even a created heaven and
created grace! Holiness is not Christ, nor are the blossoms and flowers of the
tree of life, the tree it self: Men and creatures may wind themselves in
between us and Christ; and therefore the Lord has done much to take out of the
way all betwixt him and us: There are not in our way now, Kings, or Armies, or
Nobles, or Judicatories, or strong holds, or watchmen, or godly professors:
The fairest things and most eminent in Britain are stained and have lost their
luster: Only, only Christ keeps his greenness and beauty, and remains what
he was: Oh! If he were more and more ezcellent to our apprehensions then ever
he was [whose excellency is above all apprehensions] and still more and more
sweet to our taste, I care for nothing, if so be I were nearer to him, and yet
he flies not from me, I flee from him, but he pursues. I hear your La: has
the same estee^ of the despised cause and Covenant of our Lord, ye had before:
Madam, hold you there: I dare and would gladly breath out my spirit in that
way, with a nearer communion and fellowship with the Father and the Son, and
would seek no more, but, that I might die, believing: And also I would hope
that the earth shall not cover the blood of the Godly slain in Scotland; but
that the Lord will make inquisition for their blood, when the sufferings of the
saints in these lands shall be fulfilled. The goodwill of him that dwelt in the
bush be with you.

GRace, mercy and peace be to you: I know, ye think of an out-going and that
your quartering in Time, and your abode in this life is short; for we flee away
as a shadow, the declining of the Sun and the lengthning of the shadow says,
our journey is short and near the end: I speak it because I have warnings of my
removal. Madam, I know not any, against whom the Lord is not: for he is against
the proud and lofty, the day of the Lord is upon all the Cedars, upon all the
high mountains, upon every high tower and upon every fenced wall, upon all the
ships of Tarshish and, upon all pleasant pictures. I know not any thing
comparable to a nearness and spiritual communion with the Father and the Son
Christ: there is much deadnes and witheredness upon many spirits, sometimes
near to God: and I wish the Lord have not more to say and to do against the
Land. Ye have, Madam, in your accounts, mercies deliverances, rods, warnings,
plenty of means, consolations, when refuge failed you, when ye looked on the
right hand, and behold no man would know you nor care for your soul, when young
and weak, manifestations of God, the outgoings of the Lord for you,
experiences, answers from the Lord; by all which ye may be comforted now and
confirmed in the certain hope that Grace, free Grace in a fixed and established
Surety, shall perfect that good work in you: happy they who see not and yet
believe. Grace, grace eternally in our Lord Jesus be with you.

I have been so long silent that I am almost ashamed now to speak. I hear of
your weakly condition of body which speaks some warning to you, to look for a
longer life, where ye shall have more leisure to praise then Time can give you
here: it shall be a loss to many, but sure, your self, Madam, shall he only
free of any loss. And truly considering what days we are now fallen into, if
failing were not serving of the Lord [which I can hardly attain] a calm harbor
were very good, when storms are so high: The forerunner who has landed first,
must help to bring the sea-beaten vessel safe to the port, and the sick
passengers who are following the forerunner, safe ashore. Much deadness
prevaile^h over some; but there is much life in him who is the resurrection and
tho life, to quicken. O what of our hid life is without us, and how little and
poor a stock is in the hand of some! The only wise God supply what is wanting:
the more ye want, and the more your joy has run on, the more is owing to you
by the promise of Grace: by gons of waterings from heaven, which your La:
wanted in Kenmure, Rusco, the West, Clasgow, Edinburgh, England, etc. Shall all
come in a great sum together: the marriagesupper of the Lamb must not be
marred with too large a fourhours-refreshment. Know, Madam, he who has
tutoured you from the breasts, knows how to time his own day-shinings and
love-visits. Grace that runs on, be with you,

MADAM.
I Confess I have cause to be grieved at my long silence or Laziness in
writing: I am also afflicted to hear, that such, who were debtors to your La:
for better dealing, have served you with such prevarication: Ye know
crookedness is neither strong nor long-enduring, and ye know likewise that
these things spring not out of the dust: It Is sweet to look upon the lawless
and sinful stirrings of the creatures, as ordered by a most holy hand in
heaven O if some could make peace with God! It would be our wisdom, and afford
us much sweet peace, if oppressors were looked upon as passive instruments,
like the saw or ax in the Carpenters hand; they are bidden [if such a
distinction may be admitted] but not commanded of God (as Shimei was, 2. Sam.
16: 10.) to do what they do. Madam, these many years the Lord has been
teaching you, to read and study well the book of holy, holy and spotless
soveraignity, in suffering from some nigh hand and some far off: Whoever be the
instruments, the replying of ^lay to the Potter, the Former of all, is
unbeseeming the nothing creature: I hope he shall clear you, but when Zion's
publict evils lie not nigh some of us, and leave no impression upon our hearts,
it is no wonder that we be exercised with domestic troubles; but I know ye are
taught of God to prefer Jerusalem to your chiefest joy. Madam, there is no
cause of fainting: Wait upon the not-carrying vision, for it will speak. The
only wise God be with you, and God even your own God bless you.

I Should not forget you; but my deadness under a threatning-stroke, both of a
failing Church, a broken Covenant, a despised remnant, and craziness of body
[that I cannot get a piece sickly clay carried about from one house or town to
another] lies most he^vy on me: The Lord has removed Scotland's crown; for we
owned not his crown; we fretted at his Catholic Government of the world, and
fretted that he would not be ruled and led by us, in breaking our adversaries;
and he makes us suffer and pine away in our in quities under the broken
Government of his house. It Is like, it would be our snare to be tried with the
honor of a peaceable Reformation, we might mar the carved work of his house
worse then th^se against whom we cry out. It Is like he has bidden us lie on
our left side three hundred and ninety days, and yet so astonishing is our
stupiditie, that we ^oan not our sore side: Our gold is become dim the visage
of our Nazarites is become black, the Sun is gone down on our See^s, the crown
is sallen from our head, we roar like bears. Lord save us from that, He that
has made them, will not have me^^, on them. The heart of the Scribe meditats
terror. Oh, Madam if the Lord would help to more, self-judging, and to make
sure an interest in Christ! Ah, we forget eternity, and it approaches quickly.
Grace be with you.

St Andrews, 20 Nov. 1657. Your La: at all obedience in the Lord, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. (68)
MADAM.
I am ashamed of my long silence to your L^: Your ^ossings and wanderings are
known to him, upon whom ye have been cast from the breasts, and who has been
your God of old. The temporal loss of creatures dear to you there, may be the
more easily endured, that the gain of one who only has immortality grows.
There is an universal complaint of deadness of spirit on all that know God; he
that writes to you, Madam, is as deep in this as any, and is afraid of a strong
and hot battle before time be at a close; but no matter if the Lord crown all
with the victorious triumphing of faith. God teaches us by terrible things in
righteousness: we see many things, but we observe nothing. Our drink is sour,
gray hairs are here and there on us, and we change many Lords and Rulers; but
the same bondage of soul and body remains: We live little by faith, but much by
sense, according to the times, and by humane policy: The watchmen sleep, and
the people perish for lack of knowledge. How can we be enlightened when we turn
our back on the Sun? And must we not be withered when we leave the fountain? It
should be my only desire to be a minister gifted with the white stone and the
new name written on it. I judge it were fit [now when tall Professors, and when
many stars fall from heaven, and God pours the Isle of great Britain from
vessel to vessel, and yet we sit and are settled on our lees] to consider [as
sometimes I do, but, ah, rarely] how irrecoverable a ^oe it is, to be under a
beguile in the matter of eternity; and what if I who can have a subscribed
testimonial of many, who shall stand at the right hand of the judge, shall
miss Christ's approving testimony, and be set upon the left hand among the
goats? there is such a beguile, Math. 7: 22. Math. 25: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. Luke
13. 25, 26. And i^ befalls many, and what if it befall me, who have but too
much art to coosen my own soul and others with the flourish of ministerial or
Countrey-holiness? Dear Lady, I am afraid of prevailing security, we watch
little, [I have mainly relation to my self] we wrettle little: I am like one
traveling in the night, who sees a Spirit and sweats for fear, and dare not
tell it to his fellow for increasing his own fear; however, I am sure when the
Master is nigh his coming, it were safe to write over a double and new copy of
our accounts, of the sins of nature, childhood, youth, riper years, and old
age. What if Christ have another written representation of me then I have of my
self, sure his is right, and if it contradict my mistaking and sinfully
erroneous account of myself, ah where am I then? But, Madam, I discourage none,
I know Christ has made a new marriage contract of love, and sealed it with his
blood, and the trembling believer shall not be confounded. Grace be with you.

St Andrews, May 26. 1659. Yours at all obedience in Christ, S. R.

To my Lady KENMURE. [69]
MADAM.
I should be glad that the Lord would be pleased to lengthen our more time to
you, that ye might yet before your eyes be shut, see more of the work of the
right hand of the Lord, in reviving a now-swooning and crushed Land and Church.
Though I was lately knocking at deaths gate, yet could I not get in, but was
sent back for a time. It is well, if I could yet do any service to him; but ah
what deadness lies upon the spirit! and deadness breeds distance from God.
Madam, These many years the Lord has let you see a clear difference betwixt
these who serve God, (...) love his name, and these who serve him not: and I
judge ye look upon the way of Christ as the only best way, and that ye would
not exchange Christ for the world's God, or their Mammon, and that ye can give
Christ a testimony of chief among ten thousand: True it is, that many of us
have fallen from our first love; but Christ has renewed his first love of our
^^pousals to himself, and multiplied the seekers of God all the country over,
even where Christ was scarce named, East and West and South and North, above
the number that our fathers ever knew. But ah! Madam, what shall be done or
said of many fallen stars, and many near to God, complying woefully and failing
to the nearest shore? Yea, and we are consumed in the furnace but not melted,
burnt but not purged, our dross is not removed, but our scum remains in us: and
in the furnace we fret, we faint and [which is more strange] we slumber: The
fire burns round about us, and we lay it not to heart: Gray hairs are upon us
and we know it not. It were now a desirable life to send away our love to
heaven, and well becomes it us to wait on for the appointed change, yet so as
we should be meditating thus, Is there a new world above the Sun and moon, and
is there such a blessed company harping and singing Hallelujahs to the lamb up
above? Why then are we taken with a vain life of sighing and sinning? O where
is our wisdom that we sit still laughing, eating, sleeping prisoners, and do
not pack up all our best things for the journey, desiring always to be clothed
with our house from above, not made with hands! Ah, we savor not the things
that are above, nor do we smell of glory ere we come thither, but we transact
and agree with Time for a new lease of clay-mansions: Behold he comes we
sleep, and turn all the work of duties into a dispute of events for
deliverance; but the greatest haste, to be humbled for a broken and a buried
Covenant, is first and last forgotten: And all our grief is, the Lord lingers,
enemies triumph, Godly ones suffer, Atheists blaspheme. Ah, we pray not! but
wonder that Christ comes not the higher way by might, by power, by garments
rolled in blood! What if he come the lower way? sure, we sin in putting the
book in his hand, as if we could teach the Almighty knowledge: we make haste,
we believe not: Let the only wise God alone, he stirs well, he draws straight
lines, though we think and say they are crooked: It is right that some should
die and their breasts full of milk, and yet we are angry that God deals so
with them. O if I could adore him in his hidden ways, when there is darkness
under his feet and darkness his pavilion and clouds about his throne! Madam,
hoping, believing, patient praying is our life: he lo^^s no time. The Lord
Jesus be with your spirit.

St Andrews 12: Sept. 16^5. Yours at all oblidged observance in Christ. S.

To his reverend and dear Brethren. MR GUTHRIE, MR TRAIL, And the rest of their
Brethren imprisoned in the Castle of Edinburgh. (70.)
Reverend, Very Dear, and now much honored Prisoners for Christ.
I Am, as to the point of light, at the out-most of perswassion in that kind,
that this is the cause of Christ ye now suffer for, and not men's interest: If
it be for men, let us leave it; but if we plead for God, our own personal sa^
and man's deliverance will not be peace. There is a s^lv^tion called the
salvation of God, which is cleanly, pure, spiritual, unmixed, near to the holy
Word of God; it is that which we would seek, even the favor of God that he
bears to his people, not simple gladness, but the gladness and goodness of the
Lord's chosen: And sure [though I be the weakest of his witnesses and unworthy
to be among the meanest of them, and (...) afraid the Cause be hurt [but it
cannot be lost] by my unbeleeving faintness] I should not desire a deliverance
separated from the deliverance of the Lord's Cause and People: It is enough to
me to sing when Zion sings, and to triumph when Christ triumphs. I should
judge it an unhappy joy, to rejoice when Zion sigheth. Not one hoof will be
your peace. If Christ does own me, let me be in the grave in a bloody
windingsheet, and go from the scaffold in four quarters to a grave, or no
grave, I am his debtor to seal with sufferings this precious truth; but Oh when
it comes to the push, I dare say nothing, considering my weakness, wickedness
and faintness! But fear not ye, ye are not, ye shall not be alone, the Father
is with you: It was not an unseasonable, but a seasonable and necessary duty,
ye were about: Fear him who is Sovereign, Christ is Captain of the Castle, and
Lord of the keys. The cooling wellspring and refreshment from the promises, is
more then the ^^ownings of the furnace. I see snares and temptations in
capitulating, composing, ceding, minching with distinctions of circumstances,
formalities, complements and extenuations in the Cause of Christ: A long spoon,
the broth is hell's hot: Hold a distance from carnal compositions, and much
nearness to the fountain, to the favor and refreshing light from the Father of
lights, speaking in his oracles; this is sound health and salvation. Angels,
men, Zion's Elders eye us; but what of all these, Christ is by us and looks on
us and writes up all: Let us pray more and look less to men. Remember me to Mr
Scot and all the rest. Blessings be upon the head of such as are separated from
their Brethren: Joseph is a fruitful bough by a well. Grace be with you.

S. Andrews, 1660. Your loving Brother and companion in the Kingdom and
patience of Jesus Christ, S. R.

To Mr ROBERT CAMPBELL. (71.)
Reverend and dear Brother.
YE know this is a time in which all men almost seek their own things and not
the things of Jesus Christ: year your alone, as a beacon on the top of a
mountain; but saint not, Christ is a numerous multitude himself, yea millions:
though all the nations were conveened against him round about, yet doubt not
but he will at last arise for the cry of the poor and needy. For me, I am now
near to eternity, and for ten thousand worlds I dare not adventure to pass from
the Protestation against the corruptions of the time, nor go along with the
shameless apostasy of the many silent and dumb watchmen of Scotland: but I
think it my la ^^my to enter a Protestation in heaven before the righteous
Judge, against the practical and legal breach of Covenant, and all Oaths
imposed on the consciences of the Lord's people, and all Popish, superstitious
and idolattous mandats of men: Know that the overthrow of the (...)
Reformation, the introducing of Popery and the Mystery of Iniquity, is now set
on foot in the three Kingdoms, and whosoever would keep their garments clean
are under that command, Touch not, (...) not, handle not. The Lord calls you,
Dear Brother, to be still steadfast, unmovable, and abundant in the work of
the Lord. Our royal Kingly Master is upon his journey, and will come and will
not ^^rry, and bl^ssed is the servant who shall be found watching, when he
comes: fear not men, for the Lord is your light and salvation. It is true,
it is somewhat sad and comfortless that ye are your alone, but so it was with
our precious Master: nor are ye your alone, for the father is with you. It is
possible I shall not be an eyewitness to it to the flesh, but I believe he
comes quickly, who will remove our darkness, and will shine gloriously in the
Isle of Britain, as a crowned King, either in a formally sworn Covenant, or in
his own glorious way, which I leave to the determination of his infinite wisdom
and goodness: and this is the hope and confidence of a dying man who is longing
and fainting for the salvation of God. Beware of the ensuaring bonds and
obligations by any hand-writ or other waves, to give unlimited obedience to any
authority, but only in the Lord: for all innocent self-defence, [which is
according to the Covenant, the Word of God and the laudable example of the
Reformed Churches] is now intended to be utterly subverted and condemned: and
what is taken from Christ, as the slower of his Prerogative Royal, is now put
upon the head of a mortal power, which must be that great, idol of (...) that
provok^ the eyes of his glory. Dear Brother, let us (...)* the rich promises
that are made to these that overcome, knowing that these that endure to the end
shall be saved. Thus recommending you to the rich grace of God, I remain.

St. Andrews. 1661. Your affectionat Brother in Christ.

FINIS.
