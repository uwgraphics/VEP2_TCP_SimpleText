A NEW ANSWER TO AN ARGUMENT AGAINST A Standing Army.
WOuld they who have Nine Years looked Sow'r,
Against a French and Popish Power,
Make Friends with both in half an Hour?
This is the Time.
Would they discreetly break that Sword,
By which their Freedom was restored,
And put their Trust in Lewis Word?
This is the Time.
Would you turn Hero's into Pads,
And crush the Spirits of our brave Lads,
And make them look like Bedlam Mads?
This is the Time.
Would they leave England unprotected,
To show how well they are affected,
And get themselves next Bout Elected?
This is the Time.
Against the Soldiers Lusts and Gullets,
Would they preserve their Wives and Pullets,
And break our Guns to save our Bullets?
This is the Time.
Would they oblige a Winter-Sea,
Their prudent Orders to obey,
Or keep a straying Wind in pay?
This is the Time.
Would they but say what they are pursuing,
Who they are advancing, who undoing,
Which sort of Men do threaten ruin?
This is the Time.
I pray then let 'em show their Games,
Fix us to one of their Extremes;
A Commonwealth, or else K. James?
This is the Time.
