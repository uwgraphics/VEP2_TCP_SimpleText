A ROYAL STORY, FOR LOYAL READERS.

For they intended mischief against thee, and imagined such a device as they
are not able to perform.

And why? because the King puts his trust in the Lord, and in the mercy of
the most Highest, He shall not miscarry.

Ejaculation.
MAy God and his Anointed the King, and all that are God's, and his Anointed
the King's, forgive me, if in these thoughts, whilst they were yet invisible,
or now that they are become legible, I have offended him, or them: humane
fraielties excepted, I hope I may appeal to Heaven, the searcher of all hearts
in point of my integrity, in the matter of Loyalty, and in the honest and
hearty intendment of these Papers; Lord, continue and increase all good
designs in my breast, until they come to that perfection thou will please to
accept: And O thou, whose proper work it is, to make the people of one house
to be of one mind, and to whom it is equally possible, to make those of one or
more Kingdoms to be so too: Bless (in thy time and way, and that in the time
and way present, if it be thy holy will) these distracted, divided Kingdoms,
with composed, united minds; that after so horrible, and so long a separation
from thee, by Rebellion, Blasphemy, Sacrilegde, Murder, and all other deadly
sins, we may once again, enjoy thee our God of Peace, in Peace, and by thee,
thy Vicegerent our King, and under him, our Church, our Laws, our Liberties,
and our mutual Loves, through Jesus Christ the eternal son of thy love, in
whom thou have loved us first. Amen.

Now know I that the Lord helps his Anointed, and will hear him from his
Holy Heaven, even with the wholesome strength of his right hand.
NAy, nay! forbear, forbear Gentlemen; judge not that ye be not judged; It Is
not to you, high flying Youths, but to the soberly Loyal souls, who have
candor as well as judgment, that I intend these; for your parts, you were
ever too rash in your actions, and uncharitable in your censures for my
conversation: Pray pardon me that I am by mischance rusht into your company;
indeed, I was looking for a more grave society; you know I affect not yours,
and I am not ignorant that you hate mine; therefore if you take ill this my
misfortune, pray tell me before I go, it is not generous, to calumniate behind
any man's back; if I have offended, I am ready to cry you mercy, or give you any
handsome satisfaction in its defect, mean while, I kiss your hands Gentlemen,
and leave you to the wise man's first Course, eat, drink, and be merry: yet may
I find you hereafter to be recollected, or but once becalmed amidst the surges
and surfets of your sinful excesses, I shall then present you with his second
course; but remember, that for all these things you must come to judgment, and
I Will add too, that you know not how soon, the times are dangerous, swords are
drawn, and the thread of man's life, as it was ever soon cut or knapt asunder,
so it seems now to be environed with Armies of weaponed and engin'd men, at
contest, which shall give first that fatal blow, and as the tree falls, so it
lies, as life leaves, death and Judgment find; Vestigia nulla retrorsum, who
rememembreth thee in the grave? says valiantly holy David; shall the dead
praise thee? no, no, the living, the living, they shall praise God: Therefore
damn not, sink not now, lest you sink and be damned for ever: God will not
bless, nor the King accept such persons; some of you know it from Breda, and I
could tell you more from His Majesty's own mouth to an acquaintance of ours;
His Majesty now stands upon His Fathers headless shoulders, and sees the
plagues attending the cursing, drinking, debaucht crew which helped bring to
the Scaffold the barbarously murdered (but most blessed Martyr) CHARLES the
first, who saw indeed in His time, and sorrowed for, but could not help, the
vic^s of His Armies and abuses of His Commisioners and Governors, the former
His gracious Meditations let you and all the world know. As to the latter, I am
satisfied from His own sacred lips, when upon occasion of my giving His
Majesty (according to the duty of my command) an account of affairs and
persons in the West of England, His Majesty (dear King) was pleased
passionately to tell me, that he was confident the relation I gave was just,
and patiently he added (Oh the mirror!) that he was reduced to that unhappy
condition, as to be forced to trust Knaves and knew not how to help it. Our
present King, CHARLES the second (such a Son to such a Father, as I believe the
world never paraleld) though reduced certainly to as much necessity, as ever so
great a Prince was, what time as he went from one Nation to another, from one
Kingdom to another people, (God suffering no man though to do him wrong
abroad) he became an object of pity (mixed with admiration) from all the nobly
disposed persons in the world, and an object of scornings and lashings of the
Independent English tongues, especially in Holland, that had never seen him,
but such as with the Queen of Sheba (hearing of his fame) came to behold the
magnanimity of his courage, and the constancy of his virtues in the banishment
from His other Royal possessions, became astonished, and either returned
convinced, penitent and Loyal, or else seized with horror, went home
trembling in their souls, at the sight of His sacred Presence, that I have
charity to hope, an holy operation from His Majesty's divine influence, will
steal them also by degrees to their own salvation; yet this King (strangely
happy, and I know not how it comes to pass) in this low condition, (as it
seemed to the world) was then (now His Majesty is in power is more) a strict
reprehender of vice, and a vigilant observer of those who became too saucy with
Majesty (clouded in fortune only, not in face) and kept up by his own grace
and presence, a Kingship perfectly in himself, not discovering the least
passion for the absence from His Crowns, which was the greater conquest then
of the world, and that desire of His Martyred Father has therein taken effect,
when he wished, rather that he might prove CHARLES le bon, then CHARLES le
grand; indeed as the world already knows Him CHARLES the good, for I believe,
that goodness is now leading His Majesty by the hand to greatness (having
sought the Kingdom of Heaven first, the rest shall be added,) and according to
the old Prophecy, as he is e Carolo Carolus, so he will be shortly Deo annuente
Carolo magno major; and that I always saw with the eye of faith; but since the
beginning (stilo novo) of June 1650. Gods immediate hand has guided the King
visibly to the eye of sense and reason (yet above comprehension too:) And at
this day His Majesty, by the conduct of Heaven, is arrived, from the most
uncertain (I may say desperate) condition, wherein His Majesty then was, to so
great a degree of glory, as was then wholely despaired of by most, that ever he
would have compassed in this world; for, what clouds were over His Majesty's
affairs at Breda! after a treaty there began with the Scots Commissioners? to
effect which treaty, there was no small difficulty attended His Majesty at
Jersey, where His Majestyes Privy Counsel, Lords, and Counsel at Law were
divided in opinion; nay, the Duke of York, that most hopeful and illustrious
Prince was persuaded in judgeme^t, for the King to declare against all treaties
with that party of Rebel Scots, His Highness and the discenting Lords,
relying wholely with Gods blessing, on the formerly almost miraculous Marquess
of Montrosse, who was then gone to kindle a loyal fire by His Majesty's
Commission, in the Highlands of the Scottish Nation, but Gods ways are
unsearchable, and his works past finding out; the Kings heart is in Heavens
hand, and he disposes it as Rivers of waters, which way soever pleases him;
and though most think it tedious to wait on Gods providence in the weary steps
which must be taken, about the meanders, dividings, and unitings, turnings and
returnings of the streams (after many miles straggling, passing again near
the same place) and though almost all that look not with the eye of faith more
steddily than the eye of reason, not only lose the current when it enters the
concaves and hollowes of the earth, but their hopes too, and are possessed with
despair of ever seeing those refreshing waters break out any more: yet the
hand of God brings them to life again, though they channelled under many an
hill and rocky cragge, he cuts a way to their appearance, and satisfies the
world by experience, That his leading Providence never leaves them until they
be sefely brought to the Sea, their Center, where they embosome in the
greatness and glory of the triumphant Ocean. Blessed be God, that leaves not
his Anointed comfortless, nor our Sovereign Councellesse; He himself whose
name is Mighty, Counselor, proves his Council; designing strangely, first to
winnow and try the Kings faith by affliction, laying low that foundation,
whereon he intends to erect so glorious a fabric, as ever since (and before)
Heaven has been modelling in our gracious King, whose heart divided in the
division of his friends and Council, unites again in God, who strongly
enclines his soul to treat, with the illest looked and falsest hearted party
that ever drew breath, in that noble Nation of Scotland, in almost all whose
Countenances, any man that durst look in their faces (which I confess I could
never scarce do, without fear and trembling, for our dear Kings sake) might
visibly read treachery and most abominable falsehood; their Priests Prayers and
Preachings, premising nothing but slavery to the King, and their groanings and
whinings, only to gull the silly flock that could have so much unchristian
patience as to hear them. His Majesty by this Treaty, if he could not convince
them into an agreement, (which if any thing, unless a contract to lay down his
life, and (which was infinitely dearer) his Honor, he was resolved to bring
them to, if not,) yet his Majesty would leave them excuselesse in whatsoever
might be the consequence, that so they should by their own irreligious, and
avaritious capitulations, and saucy rejections, affronting their Maker in the
person of his Anointed, draw their own guilt, and their own blood, upon the
pates of them and their posterities. The King during this Treaty, had a hard
task, to comport with variety of tempers and constitutions, so, as to keep
them, though enemies one to another, friends to himself. The Commissioners
often grew peremptory; but at such time, his Majesty would quickly awe them
into some reverence, by letting them know he was their King. His Majesty's old
friends, that all wished one end, yet unhappily divided in their opinions of
the means thereunto conducing, grew to as much jealousy and enmity one with
another, as ever the Presbyterians and Independents were at: So, that the
friends to the Treaty, look on the opposers, as enemies to the King, and the
other party reciprocally on them, that not only the declarers, became averse
one to another, but the moderate or neuters, (who waited for the Kings Highway)
having their souls bound up in Buffe of obedience to Him in either, became
neglected or mistrusted of both; yet the Treaty goes on, the antipathy
undermines the whilst, and it is believed Marquess MONTROSSE was persuaded
from thence, by private instructions from eminent persons, to make a bolt or a
shaft of his business, to win the horse, or lose the saddle; break the
Treaty by Conquest, or at least attempt something to make the Treaters more
modest, which his Excellency putting in execution during the Treaty, failed of
those friends in Scotland, and of those supplies of horse, arms, men, and (as
the sinew of all war) money, from Foreign Kings and Princes, which probably
had the Treaty never began, or had been then ended, he would have found, and
have been accompanied with wonted success. But his Excellency (all these
things falling under a strong fate) became most unfortunately taken in his
first design, was carried Prisoner to Edenborough, where he was met with the
Sentence of Condemnation, to be hanged by the common Hangman, (O unworthy
bloody Judges!) which he cheerfully embraced, and they most barbarously put in
Execution with all speed, to hasten his death and glory and their own sin
and shame together, and that power which the Kirk only feared in the person
of that gallant MONTROSSE, being now laid low, they resolve to break all
treaties with the King, but in the nick the Commissioners had concluded with
His Majesty, and His Majesty was removed with them from Breda toward Scotland;
His Majesty no sooner came to Hounslowdike (an house of the Prince of Oranges
near the sea side) in order to his voyage, but His Majesty's cares were there
saluted with the unwelcome news of the death of that incomparable MONTROSSE,
the deep sense whereof so pierced His Majesty's Royal heart, that there could
not but arise new conflicts within His Princely soul: The opposite Lords it is
probable take this advantage to renew their arguments of disswasion: And His
Majesty was no doubt at a great strait what to resolve; to take notice of
pittyed MONTROSSE either by word or look, (I may say) His Majesty durst not,
(though he dared do any thing heaven should command) lest then the squinting
Commissioners should grow jealous of his love to them, by any kindness His
Majesty might show to his dear MONTROSSE'S memory; if His Majesty should go
with them now, He saw well, that that party that had contributed to the
Execution of his Royal Fathers Person, had already executed his own present
power in His Commission to brave MONTROSSE; and therefore if His Majesty went,
'twas with apparent danger to His own life: If he stayed he knew not which way
to turn himself, that year must needs be quite lost, for all the Offers and
Officers from Denmark and Sweden, and all other asistance, the Scots had
rejected, as able to do the business (they intended) alone; besides, His
Majesty should be strangely looked on the world over: And more then this, His
Majesty's word was passed, and no other visible means left for His Majesty to
be active toward His Crowns at present; after all which considerations,
Heaven inclines the Kings heart, and His Majesty most cheerfully approves, and
on Sunday morning 9. of June (stilo novo) 1650. before the Sun appeared, was
His Majesty taking Coach for Trehagh, and so to take shipping, diverse of His
Majesty's Lords and Servants having been aboard three or four days before in
His Majesty's ship, and diverse of the Scots Commissioners and Priests had been
as long in their ship; a noble young Lord and my self having on the Saturday
evening come off from His Majesty's Ship, were only after His Majesty's
departure from Hounslowdike left there behind, condoling His Majesty's
condition, and following him with our prayers for Heavens protection: His
Majesty had not been gone two hours, (my Lord and my self retiring to the
next harbor to refresh before we took Boat for the Hague) but in comes a
wagon full of those Priest-ridden Commissioners, and those Commissioner-ridden
Priests) such a Gallimofery of ill looks I know not how to express them)
enquiring strictly for His Majesty, whom we soon let know, that His Majesty was
newly gone, at which they seemed much troubled, and going into the next room
to us, they drew out their papers and perused them, in consultation what next
to do, by which and their ill-boding countenances, we easily guessed that they
had brought some new tormenting Propositions, and so, soon after we heard,
they had received, sent to them from the power in Scotland, after Marquess
MONTROSSE was shamefully butchered, which it is believed were so much higher
then formerly, that His Majesty could not with honor have granted, but would
rather in probability have dissolved the Treaty, which was their design,
intending (as it is thought, having now freed themselves of their fears of
MONTROSSE) no more compliance with His Majesty, rather choosing to adhere to
the fortune of their swords: But a good providence had (before these tormentors
could recover the Sea shore again) safely conveyed His Majesty on Shipboard; so
the Commissioners they take Shipping too, and His Majesty (with three ships
only of Hollands men of War) sets sail for Scotland, relying on heaven as
His best Convoy, under the shadow of whose wings he shall not miscarry, which
brought him, in his time to a desired Port: His Majesty had no sooner quitted
the Holland shore, but the three new-built English rebel Friggots (the best
that ever were) called the faithful Speaker, the President, and the FAIRFAX,
came upon the Holland Coast in quest of the King, sending to the Hague, they
found the King was newly gone, thereupon set sail Northwards in pursuance of
His Majesty, whom after they had sought two days, with a brave gale of wind
they came upon the North Coast of England near Scotland, where missing the
Kings Fleet, they called a Counsel, at which 'twas concluded, that if the King
had the same wind with them, (whereof there was no doubt) then His Majesty by
that time must needs be in Scotland, setting sail a day (at least) before them,
so the Counsel resolved to sail according to their former orders toward the
West of England, quitting all hopes of their old trade of King-catching for
that bout. This Relation ANTH. YOUNG Captain of the President made to me.
Whereas His Majesty was three and twenty days at Sea, blessed (as it proved)
with contrary winds, and crossed (as they thought then) with calmes; so that
His Majesty was forced to put into an Island, in the King of Denmarks
dominions, for fresh provisions, where His Majesty himself in a disguise went
on shore, and soon returned, and at length they came near the Scottish
ground, very far Northwards (so far that they out went night, being able to
read under decks the smallest print, when 'twas least light) and when the King
with his Fleet came to the mouth of Straboggy on one side of the harbor, a
squadron of the English Rebel Ships, which had layen thereabouts, as an
ambushment for his Majesty (having their expectation of him wearied) then
sailed outward on the otherside, so near were they meeting each other, that
they on the shore looked with no small admiration, whilst one party was sailing
in, and the other out; But by reason of a thick Scottish mist that then fell,
they were indiscernable each to other, at least the Rebel English did not espy
the Royal Fleet, God being to them as to the Israelites of old, a cloud to
conceal them from their English Enemies; indeed Scotch ones had then
possession of his Majesty's Person, as more clearly every day appeared; for
before his Majesty was permitted to land, they offered a disloyal violence to
his Majesty's righteous Soul, and it is admirable to observe, the wonders that
God wrought in the deep for His Majesty's Preservation so far, for in all
probability, had His Majesty not set sail when he did, (neither sooner nor
later) had He had one gale of wind more, or one calm less, or any thing but
what God did (now apparently) then allot for Him, His Majesty had been made a
prey to His devouring Enemies, or entombed in the monumentall Ocean: But his
Majesty (thanks be to God) safely lands at Straboggy in the Highlands, being
entertained the first night by the Loyal Marquis HUNTLEY, at his house, and
that being so far Northwards, proves no small advantage to His Affairs; for
the people all the way came in to see, seeing admire, and admiring love with
honor their distressed (but made by Gods blessing on their affection a most
hopeful) Prince: Whereas had His Majesty landed nearer St. Johnstones (if
possibly he could) yet in all probability it had been very unhappy; for when
His Majesty comes thither, though they salute him with hail Master (King of
Jews indeed) yet they cut Him short in reallity, not admitting His Majesty to
sit in their Councels, either of State or War, nor to be in the Army, because
the Soldiers were so taken with (and fond of) Him, which the Kirk were
jealous of, lest in time He should get their Crown from them, for they
resolve, that at best He shall have only the name of King, the Sovereign
power is fit to recide in the Kirk alone, those inspired sons of Government;
and if His Majesty can but once bring His faith to that spiritual pitch, as to
believe as the Kirk believes, He shall not need trouble Himself with any
thing else. They Will ease His head of cares, and His shoulders of all Kingly
burdens; His Majesty shall need only Sign and Seal what they please, and
Himself may hawke, hunt, and enjoy those Noble Recreations suitable to His
Youth the while, and if this will not content Him, He shall be brought to the
Stool of Repentance, hear God and Himself (his Anointed) blasphemed in
their next belching prayers, and afrighting preachments (as an Antidote against
which His Majesty might not be permitted to take any of His Orthodox Divines,
either English or Scottish Chaplains over with Him) and His English, and many
Scotch Lords, Officers, and household servants are banished the Court. His
Majesty must further then, be humbled under the pride of these spiritual
Trumpeters, but it shall be said to be for the sins of His Fathers house, and
the Idolatry of the Queen his Mother: Indeed His Majesty must (must was never
used for a King in this sense before) do whatsoever they will have Him do, if He
intend to have any rest in life, or respite from death. Well, His Majesty (wise
as an Angel) acts now the part of a Subject, hears, sees, and says nothing,
Blessed be God, that has endued so young a body with so prudent a mind, with
so meek a soul, a soul so humble, that I am confident God reveals his
secrets to Him, as he has promised to do to those that are so qualified to
receive them, but he resists the proud, and the loftiness of the Kirkemen
foreruns their destruction; God so infatuates their Counsels, as that in the
great pride of their hearts, notwithstanding CROMWELL had entered the Kingdom
of Scotland, with a potent Army, from whom surely they expacted little mercy,
yet in the nick of time before they should have fought with him, did this
Kirk-Faction, proudly presuming upon their own strength, and being bewitched
with an opinion of their own righteousness, disband and cashiere diverse
thousands (the best Officers and Soldiers) of their Army, resolving to carry
on the work, only with their own spiritual Bumkins, an heard of untutored
Disciples, and these were of the Kirks teaching to fight Ex tempore, as they
should be unpremeditately, by an impulse of spirit put upon it; CROMWELL
notwithstanding finds himself too weak for these Kirkers, and resolves, as
privately and as speedily as he may, to ship away his train, his wounded, and
his sick men at least, if not all his infantry and so break away with his
horse, to which purpose he makes toward Dunbarre, where the English Fleet lay
ready; the Kirkers, (principled in this particular purely like Cowards, who
naturally press hard upon a running party, no holding them from pursuing such
as fly, more then persuading them to engage handsomely against a party that
will stand, but) those zealous hotspurs follow violently CROMVVELS reere,
before he could ship his Artillery, and encamp so near to their Army, that
CROMWELL sending a party to a pass in his way to England, to see whether it
were open, and finding it possessed by the Scots, and himself necessitated to
fight or yield dishonorably, resolves to make a desperate venture, and expect
the issue of a bold attempt; (Audaces fortuna juvat, timidosque repellit:) had
those Kirkers learnt our English Pro^erbe (as they may do in time) give them
rope and they will hang themselves, they had then certainly been better advised,
then to make an Enemy either desperate or contemptible, or to put that in
hazard by a fight, which they might (upon the matter certai^ly) have compassed
by forbearing, had they possessed their souls in patience; but it seems they
wanted that belief, which keeps people from making h^st, and they finding
CROMWELL to be but in a stinking condition, his Army being extremely weakened
with the Flux, (which so violently seized upon them, that it is said they were
^o^ced to march with their breeches untrussed in their hand, ready to give (not
fire, but) water or blood at a minutes warning. They pursue the chase whilst
the scent was hot, and CROMWELL ^^^ng thus straightened, wisely gives the first
blow, so they go to it: Now fight Dog, fight Bear, neither barrel better
herring, it is ten thousand to one, but if Traitors be beaten, Rebels prove
Conquerours: The matter receives a sudden issue, whether by Gods immediate
providence, that this way (and no other) his and the Kings Enemies, should at
this time, destroy his and the Kings Enemies, by their infatuated division of
interests, (Quos Deus vult perdere, dementat prius:) or whether as a means
thereunto conducing, some of the Scots Officers (as 'twas believed) proved
treacherous, or whether only out of improvidence or necessity, the season
being wet, and the Scots Army very weary, the foot generally having not their
matches lighted, and were (non vino, sed somno sepulti,) all sleepy and drowzy,
when CROMWELL by the assistance of that fate, which constantly appears with
active souls (vigilantibus, non dormientibus) gave them betimes in the morning
a resolute and unexpected charge (mixed with a frightfull surprise) and put the
whole Army into such a confusion, that though there were on each party many
slain, (of the Scots most) yet I can hardly call it a Battle, for unless
Major General ROBERT MONGOMERY (youngest son to the Earl of Eglington) had
with a body of Horse under his Command, and the Atholl Regiment of foot, which
were all cut off, maintained the field a while (which by both sides they are
acknowledged to do very gallantly) the business had scarce received a
dispute; however (ultra posse non est esse) MONGOMERY was over-powred by the
adverse Horse, (which indeed was their maine strength) CROMWELL proves
victorious, slew as it is generally (...) about 4000. on the spot, and took
about ^^00. Prisoners (besides the wounded men which (...) turned off, to a
very great number) amongst the rest, Leivtenant General LUMSDALE, said to be a
very good Officer, and stout, was taken, but the unchristian usage which the
common soldiers of the Scotch Party received, in their Imprisonments, from
those that led them away captive, by famishing and surbating them in their
cruel and tedious overmarchings toward Newcastle, and then quartering them in
a great Cabbage field, when they came there, before they could otherwise be
disposed of, suffering the poor creatures, to have nothing to eat bu^ their
own flesh, or that as raw food, (too cold for over heated bodies,) the Cabbage
leaves and (...) to satisfy their hungry appetites, there the sad Scots eat
and dye soon, most of them, and the rest live a while longer, and do worse (by
degrees they all perished) under that Monster, Sir ARTHUR HASELRIGGE Governor,
whose (...) in this, and his barbarous carriage at Chichester thentofore (where
after Articles made, and the Town delivered to them, he barbarously caused
Musketeers to give fire in at a window, upon Sir CHRISTOPHER LEVVKNER the
Governor, (differing only with Sir ARTHUR in Argument after liberty given of
discourse, and other then unarmed Officers, being in a room quietly together)
and his vile carriage in other places, during this War (which got a habit in
him, by being unnaturally cruel to his own Mothers sons, from his Youth)
make him appear one of the most unparalleld Rebels in this adulterous
Generation, and may forever discourage any from taking quarter from so base an
Enemy, (choosing rather to fall into the hands of God, then man, (whose very
mercies are cruel) by attempting the highest actions that may hope to be
crowned with a noble life, or an honorable grave) But thus ends the maine
Scene of the chief Act in this Tragedy between CROMVVELLS and the Kirkes
Factions, Saints both of the new Edition, and I hope of no great duration,
only CROMWELL has the luck to be the longer liver, and having snuft out the
glory of the Kirkes new light, which here expires in a stink, possesses
himself of the City of Edenborough, and Town and harbor of Lies, presently
garrisoning Lies, and besiedging the impregnable, well ammunitioned, and
provisioned Castle of Edenborough, whereof one DUNDAS was the unworthy
(Governor, who (after some inconsiderable siedge) through the corruption of
reward or cowardice, or both, delivered it up to CROMWELL, upon Articles, and
continued afterward under his protection, where for the present he inherits
the shame, and may hereafter receive the reward of an unfaithful servant to a
gracious Master. The King this while is where he was, at St. Johnstones, not
being before admitted to the Army, whereof the remainder now repaires toward
him, and possessing the Town and Castle of Sterling, which commanded the
Bridge over Firth River into the County of Fife, the Armies have time now to
breath and to look one upon another: The Kirk Army thus grown weak in their
number, (not in the confidence of their Clergy) the Loyal Highlanders, and
those Northern Gallants under Marquess HUNTLEY, the Earl of ATHOL, and
Livetenant General MIDLETON, begin to model themselves for His Majesty's
Service; the King knowing their ancient Loyalty, receives fresh hopes of good
toward Him: But the Kirk are as cross of His Majesty's interest still, as
before, and for the Kings sins, and for the sins of his Fathers house (they
say still) it must needs be, or for theirs in having to do any thing with Him,
that this great overthrow and strait was come upon them: His Majesty well
perceiving their villainy, was very solicitous to cast Himself and Cause upon
Gods Providence, and the fidelity of those Northern Nobility and Gentry, and
to that purpose removed Himself, with some of His servants, privately from St.
Johnstones toward them, the faithful Lord NEW: BURGE, Livetenant Colonel of
His Majesty's Regiment of Guards, with all those loyal souls that would go
with Him, declares to wait upon His Majesty's Person, and follows Him; but by
a Providence (working all for the best in the end) His Majesty was overtaken by
some of the Kirkes more moderate friends, who partly by argument, and partly by
their greater number in Arms, use a kind of violent persuasion, and prevail
with His Majesty to return to St. Johnstones, promising all the Honorable
Reception that is possible; and now indeed, and not before, (another Power
appearing) His Majesty is admitted to sit in Council with them: But Sir JOHN
BROWN with a part of the Kirk Army must needs go to reduce the Northern
Forces under MIDLETON, His Majesty is desired to command them to disband; yet
the matter was composed by Gods blessing upon His Majesty's Wisdom and
Intercessions without blows: The King they agree shall be crowned the first
day of January, which being happyly performed, he became the New Years Center
then, to which all parts of the Circumference made address, and the great
work which His Majesty begins to labor at, is to bring all Parties and
Interests to reconcile in Himself, (Hic labor, hoc opus est) which, whilst His
Majesty is doing, by way of digression I take liberty to let you know, that
CROMWELL and the Council of State of ENGLANDS New Commonwealth, this while
do not less bestir themselves, not only by open force, but by all manner of
secret treachery, and Machivillian policy, to subvert and destroy our most
hopeful King: One of their cursed works of darkness being more eminently
come to light, was thus damnably contrived: MORS, an active Villain, when
formerly servant to Sir WILLIAM ERMYN of the North, deceased, a notorious
vermin, that whilst he liveed, was always knawing at the root of Monarchy,
and Viper-like eating away to his own inventions, through his mothers bowels;
but he is dead, and his servant MORS, receiving a double portion of his wicked
spirit, after his (feared descention) departure, bestirs himself in His
Masters and Grandfathers errand, the more industriously, designed by the
infernal Council of White Hall, (which now is become a den of Thieves, and a
cage of every unclean Bird) That he should pretend himself since the murder
of our King to be a great Convert, the Engagement to be faithful to ENGLANDS
Commonwealth, established without King or Lords, he should by no means
approve: So that being wholly dissatisfied with the present Power, and to avovd
the penalties for noncon^^^y^nce, he quits the Kingdom, and takes an h^u^^ to
himself, Wife, and Family at Callais in France, where he had not been above a
month or so, but under pretense of his conversion, becoming acquainted with
some of His Majesty's Friends, expresses a great desire he had to go to Paris
to gain the honor of kissing our Queens hand, and to offer Her Majesty his
service, which they very readily encourage him in, and address him to some of
Her Majesty's servants, upon which he comes to the Queens Court, and was
brought to Her Majesty, who gave him Her hand to kiss; MORS takes the
confidence to discover the deep sense he had of Her Majesty's sufferings, and
the extreme sorrow wherewith he was affected, for the barbarous murder of Her
King and Husband, confessing he had been so unhappy, as in the time of War,
to act in his sphere for the Parliament, believing their thoughts toward His
Majesty had been equally innocent with his, which though upon better
consideration he found injudicious, they had nothing of that guilt in their
intentions of (which proved the sad consequence of all their actions) His
Majesty's death; yet inasmuch as he was sometime so unfortunate as to move or
breathe in that wicked way, he knew nothing too hazardous for him, by way of
expiation for his former offenses, to venture against CROMWELL, (or any other,
but) him he looked on as the great Dictatour and Commander in that high
mischief, and if her Majesty pleased to command him, he would either by poison
or stob, though with the certain loss of his own life, give a period to
CROMVVELLS days. Her Majesty (the Mirror of Her Sex for constant love and
loyalty to Her King and Husband) pierced to the heart with this fresh renewing
of her grief, in the loss of her incomparable King and Consort, after She had
recollected Her self, answered, that he might apprehend that offer as some
satisfaction to himself, but she had better learnt Her Savior, and would not
by any consent of Hers, take the matter out of Gods hands, who had said
vengeance was his, and he would repay, in whose due time, She expected to see
their ruin that had committed that unheard of murder, the Fountain of Her
and all Loyal Subjects misery, the shame of Christendom, and the astonishment
of the known World, to which MORS replies, that though her Majesty was not
pleased to accept of his service in that particular, yet, by that, he hoped her
Majesty believed he would then be ready to do any thing less dangerous;
wherein he might serve her Majesty toward a public good, and her Majesty he
conceived must needs have affairs of weight with the King, and to send to His
Majesty, as he understood she did by the way of Holland, was very uncertain,
tedious, and expensive, as a quicker dispatch; if her Majesty could think of
any service he could do, in that or any thing else, he would undertake to go
from Calais to Dover, and so by land, much sooner, and in respect of his
knowledge in the North, much safer he believed, and would venture his life to
carry Letters or message from Her Majesty to the King: Her Majesty glad at all
times to have opportunity to present her duty and love to her Son the King,
and at that time having some more immediate business with His Majesty,
embraces MORS his offer, and prepares Letters to the King; MORS no sooner
receives them (with promise of all sidelity and secrecy) but posts away for
England; at Whitehall he acquaints his Black Masters how far he had succeeded
in this dark design, (at which Hell and they it is to be supposed kept a private
thanksgiving) MORS receiving fresh encouragement and instructions, hyes away
for the North, and in great pretended privacy coming into Lies, there he
disguiseth himself into woman's apparel, in that habit cunningly passes over
the water to Burnt Island, where after he was harbored, he sends to the
Governor, imparting the matter to him, that he came from the Queen, etc. and
desired his assistance that he might be presently fitted with man's clothes
again, and accommodated with Horses and Guides to go to the King, then at St.
Johnstons, the Governor glad of the employment, does accordingly: MORS no
sooner comes to Court, but there meets him a Major, an English Gentleman, who
(knowing him most maliciously active formerly, against the King) saluted him,
asking him whether he were a Convert, MORS tells him the same kind of
lamentable story of his sadness which before he had told the Queen, and that
the Queen had honored him with Letters to the King, which he was in great
have to deliver; the Major joy'd at his conversion presses him to drink a Cup
of Scotch Ale with him upon the Guard, before he went in to the King, when they
came into the Court of Guard, the Major charge the Captain of the Guard with
him as a Spy, and causing him presently to be searched, there was found
nothing about him, but those Letters from the Queen, which the Major (leaving
MORS a prisoner) presents to the King; His Majesty seeing his distressed Mother
Queens hand, receives them joyfully, and asks for the Messenger, the Major
thereupon tells the King what a dangerous person MORS (that brought them) was,
of a disposition so implacably malicious, that he could not sleep (as the
Psalmist says) unless he had done (at least contrived) mischief, and humbly
begged the King, that he might be tried as a Spy, for he wus confident he came
upon some horrid design, such another person not being to be found for their
purpose; His Majesty advising with his Counsel, and being pressed by many
arguments from the Major, granted a Commission of life and death to certain
persons according to the form of that Kingdom, who calling MORS to trial as
a Spy, he pleaded not only not guilty, but rather merit in running so great a
hazard, to do the King service in a time so dangerous; but the Judges found
cause enough to condemn him, and told him they were justified in themselves
for what they did upon the evidence given; yet that he might justify them also
to the world, they caused a rack to be brought before him, and Soldiers with
lighted matches, told him he was as a dead man already, yet if he would
confess his intentions, he might receive mercy, else (whether guilty or not
guilty at present, must be between God and his Conscience) they would burn
his hands and feet with matches, as far as they would burn, that done, they
would rack him one joint from another, until he should confess, or if not
confess, they would execute him at last. MORS seeing death at the door, and
that better dye in an ingenious confession, then in so much guilt to throw body
and soul headlong, he, without either the matches burning his flesh, or the
rack torturing his bones, freely confessed the design was laid by the States
of England, and that he had undertaken for reward, to slay innocent blood; and
either by poison he was to have done it whilst he stayed in expectation of an
answer to the Queens Letters, or if he could not effect that, then, when he
received his dispatch from the Kings hand, he was resolved to have given a
fatal blow. MORS thus having confessed, being condemned, was remaunded to
prison: before Execution, the Lord LOTHIAN (CARRE) His Majesty's Secretary,
mistrusted always for a Juggler with the English Rebels, tells the King that
this MORS was the first person condemned to dye by the Kings immediate Power,
and humbly propounded, how acceptable a thing it would be to God and man, in
his first action to show rather mercy then judgment; His Majesty answered,
that His own inclination did naturally prompt Him, rather to pardon then
punish Offenders, yet at that time he would not out of that regard remit MORS,
but His Majesty would look upon his Lordships Proposal, as a desire, and His
Majesty did not think fit to deny a Nobleman of Scotland, the first request
that should be made to him after His Coronation; MORS therefore for his
Lordships sake should live and not dye, for which his Lordship returned thanks
to the King, and within few days was repayd it to himself by CROMWELL, who
had sent his Lordship a Letter gratulatory, which coming by a providence to be
made known to the King, His Majesty therewith acquainted the Earl of
Eglinton, Colonel of His Majesty's Regiment of Horseguards, (who is my Relater
of the story) and presently His Majesty signed a warrant to the Jailer,
expressing, that though MORS were pardoned, yet that he should keep him close
prisoner still, which warrant His Majesty left to the Earls care, who soon
sent it to the Prison, else MORS had been freed; CROMWELL hereupon by letter
disowning the act of MORS, yet at the request of MORS his wife, being great
with child, was contented to exchange any one of three Scotch Lieutenant
Coolnells (which he named) for MORS: His Majesty seeing CROMWELL interest
himself so far in the business, whom His Majesty had little cause to
believe, to be of so gentle a nature, as to exchange an Enemy for an Enemy (as
MORS (had he been heartily the Queens servant) was) at the request of a great
belly, denies to exchange him for any of those there, but if Lieutenant
General LUMSDALL might be exchanged for him, His Majesty would release MORS,
and not else: CROMWELL considering the quality of the Persons (I believe) so
unequal, and fearing all the world would then conclude him guilty of MORS his
horrid and bloody intention, (which upon the former grant of a Lieutenant
Colonel for his exchange, they had cause enough (besides the native
probability) to imagine) refuses to exchange LUMSDALL; so MORS continued
prisoner, where I leave him, (without descanting on so unchristian an
enterprise, or aggravating their crime by the Queens Candor, which doubtless
made it more out of measure, sinful) and I heartily wish him, and all that
had, or have hands or hearts in so foul an intention of blood guiltiness
against so gracious a Prince, either by their actions of open and rebellious
hostility, or obscure treachery, hearty and timely repentance before they go
hence, and be no more seen. And I bless God for this merciful deliverance of
his anointed our King: For, This also comes forth from the Lord, which is
wonderful in Counsel and excellent in working. I take leave (begging pardon
for this tedious wandering) to return to His Majesty, whom I find to have
passed strange difficulties, this while with admirable dexterity, and blessed
success. He has now, God be thanked, made a general Reconciliation, and
enemies to shake hands as his friends, the valiant Earl of Cleveland, and his
English Nobility. Officers and servants, are after so long a banishment from
His Majesty's presence admitted to their duty, Lords, Faithful WENTVVORTH and
WILMOT, lie in their turns in His Majesty's Bedchamber, as in His former
freedom: And now the great men of Scotland that were excommunicated from King
and Court, return to their King, and Duke HAMILTON, Marquess HUNTLEY, Earl
of ATHOL, Li^vtenant General MIDDLETON, and the rest, have their sentences
recalled, and draw into union with all the moderate of the Army party, so that
the power of the Kirkers (which I take to be a mungrell Faction, generated
between rigid ^^^^bytery and Indepency) is now vanished, now the King as King,
commands without the Dictates of those pretended spiritual Guardians, and all
Loyal Souls, whose heart God has touched, (not otherwise designed for the
Kings service) repair from all Parts, to take their fortunes with His Majesty,
who shines in Arms, in the Field of Honor, where he is sprung up as a Light
for the Righteous, and joyful gladness for such as be true hearted: And
though in His way to His Crowns, many Clouds of Disasters may ^bscure His
Light, and by interposition of the Moon, this Sun may sometimes be eclipsed,
yet doubtless He shall by the goodness of God, His Guide, break through all
again, (as Rivers that often interre, yet still rise with their refreshing
streams) at length, a strong earnest of which mercies to come, are Gods
deliverances of His Majesty from dangers past, and therefore let every one
that is faithful, continue to do his Duty, and leave the issue to Gods
disposal, who certainly will arise in his own time, and have mercy upon
Sion, and we hope, that time will shortly come, for why? His servants think
upon her Stones, and it pittieth them to see her in the dust, as which dust
before the wind, shall the Enemies of God and the King, in due time be, and
the Angel of the Lord scattering them.

FINIS.
