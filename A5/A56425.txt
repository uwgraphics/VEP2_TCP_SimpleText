THE PARLIAMENTS PETITION to the Devil.

To the most high and mighty Emperor of Darkness, Don sell de Lucifer, King
of Acheron, Styx and Plegaton, Duke of Tartary, Marquess of Cocitus, and Lord
Paramount of LIMBO.

Printed in the Year 1648.

The Parliaments Petition to the Devil.
Shows, that we your (Infernal fatherhoods) most obedient sons and
servants, in the two Houses of Parliament of England, do here most humbly
present our grievances, and lay them prostrate before the cloven feet of your
graceless Majesty; it is not unknown, that we (to serve you) have laid aside
all service of God, all Loyalty toward our King, and all Christian love and
charity toward men, we have robbed God of as much of his glory as we
possibly could; and because we could not imprison him, we have either
imprisoned, ruined, or murdered all his servants spiritual and temporal; and
not any honest man, Christian or true Subject, that dared to oppose such
direction and orders as we have from time to time from your superpotent
commands received (which we have dutifully obeyed) and we have inflicted the
most rigid and inhumane punishments upon all refractory and inveterate
Malignants as could be invented.

Thus we prospered and flourished, under your graceless defense and
protection, we have wallowed more then 7 years in all voluptuous and
luxurious sensuallity, we have allowed and maintained most execrable and
horrible blasphemies, all manner of Sects and Heresies, we have given large
rewards to Traitors and Villains, we have cast down all Law, learning and
knowledge, and set up and magnified all barbarous impudence and ignorance, as
is manifested in both our famous and learned Universities.

The Son of God (because he is the greatest and most mighty destroyer and hater
of your power and eminency, the maine enemy of our designs and practices) we
have used all our endeavors to root out all memory of him; we have made his
houses, stables, brothells, and dens for worse Inhabitants then ever lodged in
Newgate; we have (for the advancement of your Cimerian Kingdom) forbiden all
Christian reverence to his name, that the people do express or show no more
adoration or respect when Jesus is mentioned, then they do when your Hellhood
is nominated, or our elder brother Judas Iscariot remembered.

We commanded his own prayer (which himself commanded us to use and pray) to
be suppressed, and commanded long prayers and babbling repetitions to be
frequently used, which he plainly did forbid.

We have (as much as in us lies) worshipped all the memories of Saints out of
Churches and Kallenders, and all the days which were wont to be called
Holy Days, we have changed into wicked ones, only we have ordained that
every last Wednesday in every Month shall be kept as a holy Fast Day, in
honorable memory of Saint Rebel, and Saint Hypocrite. And many times, when
your malevolent mighty assistance has given us any notable glorious victories
against our lawful Sovereign, and his Loyal Subjects, then we have caused
public Thanksgiving-dayes, which we have daubed over with praises to God,
when our intentions were to thank your execrable Majesty, for your accursed
aid in the murdering of our brethren; and if we should publicly have given
thanks to you (in your own name) the people would have been mad at us;
therefore we gave God thanks with our lips, but our hearty thanks were meant
to you, for whom they were due; for you alone helped us, and at those exercises
we had not any Preacher, but he truly proved to be the Legitimate son of
thunder, who had such care in avoiding ill examples, that they never prayed for
the King, or scarce mention him (except to slander or revile him) for these
purposes, we had and have a Marshall, a Cornelius, an Adoniram, (or a
Nodi-Ram,) a Peter's, a Dell; a Temple, a Staunton, a Nigh, a Cawdry, and 500
such, now and anon too, at all times, these blew the bellows of Sedition, these
filled England with blood, and these have sent seduced and unprepared souls to
your Kingdom of darkness by thousands.

Indeed, when we first entered into the service of your graceless Excellency,
we had strange oppositions in the Church: There was not a Preacher who was not
your deadly enemy; they made no scruple to call you the Father of lies; that
you were as a roaring Lion, continually seeking whom to devour. That you were
a murderer from the beginning, with all the invective words of defamation to
your name and honor, as could be expressed. Those were Bishops, Doctors, and
other fellows, who made it their chief trade of life; nothing else but to draw
the affections of people from you; they talked (in their Pulpits) of faith,
hopt, charity, obedience, Loyalty, and such things as the practice of them
would have undone us all, and we are sure they are all repugnant and malignant
to your glorious government, and if we had not banished and suppressed them, and
the professors of them, we had been ruined long since, and your black
Territories had not been so fully furnished with seduced souls.

Concerning the Laws, and known established Statutes of the Kingdom, we
have laid them by as useless, and altogether repugnant to us and our glorious
designs and proceedings; for we know that if ever the Laws do come to be in
force again, what will become of us? The execution of the Laws, we do know
will execute us, and then our lives and estates will be all forfeited and lost,
and the King be made more rich and glorious then any of his Predecessors, as
we promised him once or twice: as concerning those Shires, Counties, Cities,
Towns, and Corporations, which put us in trust to redress and ease their
grievances, it is known that the King himself eased them of all the old ones;
but we have laid 100 times more new ones upon them, and we humbly thank your
damnable assistance, for that you have so blinded and benumed them, that many
of them do not feel the weight of them; and whereas we were elected and
chosen by the Country, as Proctors, Aturneyes, or Advocates, and (in a manner
servants,) to do our best endeavors for the services, profits, and utillities
of the Church and Kingdom in general and particular: But for your dear and
damnable sake, we have broken all the trusts which we were entrusted with,
we have made our selves our Masters Masters (with the help of their own
money and arms) and we have done the work so thoroughly, that your Devillship
could never have done it half so well your self, and in stead of enriching
the Kingdom, we have made our selves rich with the spoils and ruins thereof.

Concerning the King, we have played our parts sufficiently with him, we have
handled him to some tune, we have coursed him like a Partridge over the
Mountains, we have robbed and divested him of all Royal dignities, and
deptived him of all Regal Revenues and Possessions, insomuch, as we have not
left him a house of his own to put his head in, except a Jayle, where we have
lodged him safe and sure; yet still we put the people in dillatory hopes of a
Personal Treaty to compose all differences (which we never mean to grant)
for we never mean to have either a King or a Treaty, no more then we mean
to be hanged, and that's a full point.

Thus we have (like disobedient sons and servants) obeyed all your Majesty's
mischievous commands accordingly, and if any thing has disastrously happened
well to the King or people, it has been much against our wills, (for it is not
with our love or leave, that the King or any friend of his should live and
prosper.

Thus, (most mighty Prince of the Air who has ruled in us your dutiful
children of disobedience) we have related some parts of the services which we
have done (by your instigations) for your honor, and the increasing of
Inhabitants in your damnable Kingdoms. Now (under favor of your magnificent
Sultanship) we your Petitioners are humbly bold to acquaint your high and deep
unfathomed wisdom of our grievances which do oppress and over-presse us, and
every day new multitudes of miseries are heaped upon us for your sake, and for
the true service we have done you; so that now if you do not speedily bestir
your self, in extending your best assistance either by force or fraud, power
or policy, to free us from the inevitable dangers which threaten our
destruction, it is feared greatly by us, that God and the King will get the
upper hand over us, and then we are all undone.

First, whereas formerly the name and person of a Parliament man was in
honorable and Reverend estemation, the case is so altered now, that no man
looks upon us but with an abhorring eye of scorn and detestation, as if we
were the plagues of the people, and the infectious destroying Pestilence of the
Kingdom, whereby we seem to be the oldest men alive, for we have outlived
all our friends, the most part do hate us deadly, and the twentieth man or
woman does not love us, but with a flavish outside love, from the teeth
outward; we have lost their hearts (though we have got their money) so that
there are few or none but do rejoice at our troubles, and earnestly desire our
destruction.

Secondly, we humbly beseech your impious Hellhood to take into your serious
consideration the Revolt of the Navy Royal, with the loss of so many stout
and skillfull Seamen, who are all unanimously bent for the Kings service under
the Prince of Wales, so that we are blockt up by Sea that we cannot run away
that way, nor can we safely stay here for fear of hanging, nor dare we to go
home to our Countries, Counties and places who have entrusted us, for we doubt
the wronged people will cut our throats, or knock out our brains; so that we
are in the case of Coals dog, we dare neither go to Church or stay at home.

We confess we have gotten great sums of moneys, and large Estates by your
service; but such wealth (being ravished from the Church, from the King, and
our fellow subjects) has so much canker-eating cursed Rust about it, that all
our joy in it is torment of conscience, and our further torment is that we
doubt God will not, and we know you cannot give us any ease or hope of comfort.

Your infernal knowledge knows that though God made us men, yet you were
ungraciously pleased to make us Rebels and Traitors, in which point we are your
creatures; destroy not therefore the works of your own hands, deal not with
us as you use to deal with Witches, (who when they have done you all the
service they can) at last you kindly bring them to the stake or the Gallows,
and there leave them.

Therefore as you have began the work, which has (by your protection)
flourished till now; so now we humbly beseech you not to let the Cause fall;
Raise up your forces, Rouse up your spirits, Raise and command from all your
Teritories, of Avernus, Dis, Tophet, Cocitus, Limbo, Barathrum, Erebus,
Gehenna, Acheron, Stix, Phlegeton, Tartaria; from these large Provinces of your
mighty Empire, we desire to raise another Army of such saints as we have before
Colchester, that by your impious forces, we may be protected and ever
victorious. Command all your Demons, and Cacodemons, Devils, and Demoniacks,
furies, Elves, Fairies Ghosts, Gobblins, Wizzards, Witches Sorcerers,
Magitians, figure-Flingers, Satires, Serpents, Nightmares, Incubusses, and
Succubusses (...) send amongst us the supporting spirits of Caine, of Cham, of
Chorah, Dathan, and Abiram, of Achitophel, and ambitious Absolon, of Nimrod,
Nero, Shimei, Rabsheka, and Iscariot, of Pharoh, Herod, Pilate, Phalaris,
Catiline, Mashevill, Ravilliac, and our Brother Pim.

Thus have we declared part of our services to, and our sufferings for your
Impious Majesty; for our further Terror, the Scot has vowed to pay us scot and
lot, and to that end are coming upon us like an impetuous storm and Tempest;
we humbly beseech you not to be tardy with your best Aid and assistance; if you
can but sow the seed of division and disunion amongst the Kings parties and the
Scottish Armies, to make them mutiny, it would be your Master piece; also we
humbly pray you to send the Citizens of London the spirit of persuasion to
send us more money, and then all may be well of our side once more.

Thus leaving our selv^s and eminent dangers to your grave Diabolicale
considerations, we leave your infernal Majesty in the full possession of
everlasting Damnation, and malediction eternal.

FINIS.
