Act made at Ellon the third day of April 1677 Years.
FOrasmuch as the Act of his Majesty's privy Council, dated the seventh day
of December last, did settle the prices of Ale and drinking Beer: so as there
might be a due proportion betwixt the same and the pryces of rough-Bear, and
appointed the said Act to be put in execution, be the Commissioners of Excyse
in the several Shires and Burghs: And the Brewers and Maltmen within the same,
to find caution for their due observance thereof: Likeas the Brewers within
the Shires of Edinburgh and Haddington, having made application and offer to
the said Privy Council, and given Bond to pay no less then seven pounds scots
the boll, for all the Bear they shall buy of the Cropped 1676. The Lords of his
Majesty's said Privy Council, have given license and allowance to the said
Brewers, to sell the Ale and drinking-Beer at twenty pennies the pynt besides
the Excyse; as also, to sell double or three shilling Ale, and have authorized
the said Commissioners of Excyse of the several Shires and Burghs, to allow
the same Latitude to all such as will make the like offer: And the Earl
Marischall, the Earl of Aboyne, and Sir John Keith, three of the Lords of the
said Privy Council, being appointed to see the said Acts receive due
execution within the Shire of Aberdeen, and to procure the due observance
thereof from the said Commissioners, Malt men and Brewers; the said Privy
Council, be two several Letters direct to them, have authorized them and the
said Commissioners of Excyse, to take that same course as to the Brewers and
Malt-men, within the Shire of Aberdeen, and Burghs Royal of the same. And in
case the said Brewers and Malt-men, do not make offer of the price, and give
Bond to that effect as aforesaid, have ordained the certification contained in
the said Act of Council, and Proclamation following thereon to be put in
execution. In pursuance whereof, and obedience to an Print Advertisement
published through the whole Shire, the said three Lords of Privy Council,
and several Commissioners of Excyse, Barrons, and Heritors of the Shire,
having conveened here this day, and having read and perused the said Act of
Council, and other Acts made in reference thereto, with the said Letters and
Commissions from the Privy Council, and strict Order therein contained, for
putting the same to full execution; considering that they are strictly
commanded and obliedged to put the said Acts to all due execution, alse well
for any transgression thereof bypast, as what may be in time comeing: Have
resolved, (as in duty they are tied) to use their utmost endeavoures
thereanent; And for that effect, have Ordained their next Meeting to be at
Aberdeen, the eighteenth day of April instant Requyring the whole Commissioners
of Excyse of the said Shyre, to be present at that Meeting, for giving their
concurrance therein: And Ordaines the whole Heritors of the Shyre, betwixt and
that time, to take notice of the Brewers within their respective Lands and
Heritages, who have transgressed the said Acts of Council, and to report
faithfully thereanent to the said next Meeting at Aberdeen: And withal
recommends to the said several Heritors, within whose Lands any Brewers are,
to be ready against that time, to become bound as Cautioners for their said
Brewers, that they shall observe the said Acts for the future: And in case,
the Heritors and Masters of the said Brewers, be unwilling to bind for them,
Ordaines the Brewers themselves to be present at the said Meeting, with other
sufficient caution, declaring that all those who shall be absent, shall be
repute and holden breakers, and contumacious contemners of the said Act of
Council; and that their presens shall extend alsewell to Malt-men as Brewers,
and these within Burghs Royal, as without the same. And in respect, the Lords
of his Majesty's Privy Council, have been so careful for the good of his
Majesty's Subjects, It is expected, that both Commissioners and Heritors will
to their uttermost power endeavor the prosecution of the said Acts, under the
certifications contained in the samen Acts and Proclamations, and power granted
by the said Privy Council: Lykeas, The Lords and Commissioners foresaids,
continues any thing relating to the Excyse, to that said Meeting at Aberdeen,
the said eighteenth day of April instant, at which time they intend to settle
the said Excyse for one Year after the first day of May next. And that none may
pretend ignorance, the Collector is appointed to cause Print and publish their
presents, at the several Parish Kirkes of the Shyre, the ensuing LORDS-DAYES.
