A word to the Royalists, or Caveliers, etc.
GIVE ear ye sons of Sodom, and draw near and harken ye wanton daughters of
Babylon; for the Lords controversy is against you, and where will ye be able
to stand, or where will ye have your glory when the dreadful God of Heaven
shall appear, to render a recompense unto his Enemies; yea then where will the
proud leave his glory, or what profit will the sons of vanity have of their
pleasure; for the acceptable year of the Lord is come near to an end, and the
day of his vengeance approaches and his long patience has much been abused by
you, and his fierce wrath is ready to kindle; for you have nourished your
hearts as for a day of slaughter, and you have cast forth your abominations as
an overflowing Fountain, yea Sodom came short of your wickedness, and the
children of Gomorrha might be justified by you, Oh! how does your pride and
your ambition appear in the streets of every Town and City; yea, because of
Oaths the Land mourns, and the Lord beholds your secret whoredoms, and your
open riotousness and drunkeness is not hid from him: and what think you will
the end of these things be? will not the Lord be avenged of such a generation
as this? yea assuredly you are fitting your selves as vessels for destruction,
for it is already entered into your borders, and desolation is compassing you
round about, and unless you spedily repent you cannot shun it, and if you defer
repentance but yet a little season, the day is hastening that you shall seek it
with tears and shall not find it; therefore hear this you hard hearted ones
and stiff necked, who rebel against the Lord your maker, there is a day
hastening, and an hour approaching, which will make you gnash your teeth for
very anguish, and weep and howl for very sorrow, to consider how you have
slighted the day of your visitation, and the things that belong to your eternal
peace, but then it will be too late. Oh! that you would yet be warned and lay
it to heart, and consider before the day of calamity and hour of your distress
comes upon you: Oh! why will you perish, or why will you provoke so merciful a
God to break forth upon you, whose delight is not in the destruction of
sinners, but rather that they should turn from their wickedness and live. Oh
remember Nineveh that great City how soon they were warned to repentance! Oh
that you would take them for an example I but if you continue in your
abominations and wickedness, and will not be allured by the tender mercies of
the Lord, then this know, that his dreadful and terrible Judgments shall
strike dread and amazement upon your hearts, and affright you by the
fearfulness thereof, and then you shall know that your destruction is of your
selves, and shall be left without excuse: Oh the vanity and lendness that is
found amongst you, it is hard to utter it; what spending, destroying, and
wasting of the good creatures, is there daily upon your lust, whilst others are
like to perish in your streets, with cold and hunger, for want of food and
raiment; and if the Lord should visit you with famine and pestilence for the
same, his judgments will be just upon you; for as you have known a day of his
mercy held: forth unto you, so you must know a day of vengeance to come upon
you, as an irresistible flood which will swallow you up and none shall be able
to deliver; and then you shall know you have been warned by such who desires
the eternal good of your souls, yea then you shall know that it is in vain for
briars and thorns to set themselves in battle against the Lord, when he shall
pass through you and burn you up, or for the potchards of the Earth to exalt
themselves against their Maker, when he shall take you and dash you to pieces
one against another; for he has long been silent and held his peace, but if
you amend not your lives with speed, this know, he will arise and will utter
his voice as a Lion out of the Forest, and as a Bear bereaved of her whelps
will he seize upon you, and then your proud lofty looks shall not daunt him nor
make him afraid, for when he roareth out of Sion, his voice will cause the
beasts of the field to tremble, for who may abide the day of his coming, or
what is able to stand before him when he shall appear, for my God is a
consuming fire, and in his presence is everlasting burning; therefore hear and
consider all you forgetters of God, and you that put the day of his coming
affar off; you that drink wine in bowls, and are mighty to drink strong
drink; you that chant at the noise of the Vyol, and rejoice at the sound of
the Organ, the day is hastening that instead of your music and songs you shall
take up a bitter Lamentation, when there shall be none to pity you; yea my soul
has often mourned in secret, with the consideration of the doleful day of
desolation which is coming upon the wicked and adulterous generations, who
have hardened their hearts against the Lord, and stopped their Ears that they
might not hear reproof; for he that reprooveth sin is become a prey un^o them,
and those who come to deny ungodliness in any measure is persecuted by them,
even by the seed of Cain, who is still rising up to slay righteous Abel and his
innocent seed where ever it appears; but the cries of the sufferings of the
innocent has pierced the clouds, and is come before the throne of the
Almighty, and has entered his Ears, and he is arising to make inquisition for
all the blood and sufferings of the righteous, from Righteous Abel unto the day
of his coming. Therefore woe unto that Generation who have caused the innocent
to suffer, yea woe and sorrow will be their portion, but this the Lord delights
not in, but rather that you may fly the wrath that is to come by a speedy
repentance, and forsaking the evil of your ways, therefore has he born with
you all this time, and withheld his indignation from breaking forth upon you,
and sent his servants time after time, to warn you both by word and writing,
and has poured forth the Vials of his wrath upon an hypocritical Generation
(in your sight) who professed him in words, but in their hearts rebelled
against him; this has the Lord done concerning you, yea he has yet come
nearer unto you, he has raised up his faithful witness within your own
consciences to bear testimony against your ungodliness, and his righteous
Spirit in your own hearts has long stroven with you, but he has said, His
Spirit shall not always strive with man, and yet you make of all this a light
thing, and as though he had done nothing concerning you, or as if there were no
God to be feared, you still rush on in the course of your ungodliness, glorying
in your wickedness, and making a mock of sin, and you are filling up the
measure of your iniquities, and it is almost full, for you are ready to cry
peace and safety, but sudden destruction is even at the door; for when the
wicked cries peace and safety, then sudden destruction is at hand; yea if you
can stop the sun in his course, or the Sea from ebbing, and flowing, then may
you stop and keep back the heavy and dreadful hand of the Almighty from falling
upon you, except ye speedily repent; for if you go on in the excess of your
ungodliness, you will assuredly know sin shall not go unpunished; and when your
destruction and calamity comes upon you, you shall then know that you have
often been warned in tender bowels of compassion to turn from the Evil of your
ways.

This is from one who mourns in secret for you, to consider the day of your
calamity which is coming as a flood, which will sweep you into the nethermost
Hell except you repent with speed; yea this is given forth from one whom the
Lord has pulled as a brand out of the fire from amongst you who are commonly
called Royallists, or Caveliers. R. M.

THE END.
