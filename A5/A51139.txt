Money well Bestowed: OR, A New-Fashion SPIT.
At the end of Cow-Lane, next to Smithfield, is to be seen diverse Rarities,
performed upon a Spit, and very useful for most Families. Being an Invention to
Bake, Boil, Roast, Stew, Broyl, and Fry; the Spits always turning without Jack,
Weights, Pullies, Lines, Chains, Springs, Man, Woman, or any usual means.

1. IT Roasts any sort of Flesh, or Fowl, more sweet and cleanlier then any
other way, and is basted without trouble to any person; and if the Meat be
Spitted heavier on one side then the other, it never hinders its motion. 2. It
Bakes Custards, Cheese-Cakes, Puddings, and Pyes, also any Confectionary, to
admiration. 3. It Boyls any Meat with Roots or Herbs, more cleanlier then any
other way, and much quicker, and you may Eat a Mess of Broth boiled upon the
Spit. 4. It Stews and Broyls. 5. It Frys Fish or Flesh with a great deal of
Curiosity, and turns all the Fish as quick as in the common way you can turn
one Fish.
All these Performances having been seen by diverse Ingenious Persons, who so
well approved of the Invention both for its Usefulness and Curiosity, that they
have Importan'd the Owner to Expose it to public view, who hopes no Ingenious
Person after seen it, will think their Time or Moneys ill spent.
