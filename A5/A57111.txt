The Reward of Loyalty, Being a SONG of the times, advising every man to be
faithful to God, Loyal to his King, and honest to his Neighbor, and not to
meddle with State Affairs.
To the Tune of Hark the Thundering Cannons Rore.
I.
LOyalty's a Noble thing,
Service done unto a King,
Honor, and Reward does bring,
And flys up to Promotion;
Treason is a trick of State,
Which the Devil makes a bait,
To a proud aspiring Pait,
To overturn a Nation.
II.
I never knew (since time began)
An open Rogue, and great Trapan
Turn a True, and Faithful Man
To GOD, or yet be Loyal.
He who to a KING that is brave
Proves a false deceitful Knave
Is Seditions simple Slave,
Be true to JAMES the Royal.
III.
Newgate Traitor tell me now,
What turns all thy Projects too?
And Exploits thou thought to do
Against the Lords Anointed,
Rebels that the Nation hate
Must submit to Divine Fate
Which Rules both the Church and State,
And runs as GOD appointed.
IV.
Never was KING of more Renown,
Then Great James that wears the Crown;
Rebels Names he does write down,
Until he be at leisure.
Loyalists he does requite,
Gratitude is his delight,
But the Rascal Rout does slight:
He Is just as was Old Caesar.
V.
When Hogan Mogan did disdain
To take on Britains Yoke again,
He led the Fleet unto the Main,
And bravely did behave him.
When Brains and Bullets fled about,
He proved himself both wise, and stout*
And cried, Let Us have the other bout,
We will both Fight and Slave them.
VI.
He is the First Rate-Sovereign Blood,
Laden with the Kingdoms good,
Tossed betwixt the Wind and Flood,
When providence ensureth*
Though the Church Religious Vail
Were made Treasons highest Sail
The hope of Hypocrites would fail,
For Truth alone endures.
VII.
Heap me a rousing Glass with Wine,
Let no Man at this Health repine,
To JAMES the great I Will drink off mine,
He knows both Sword and Scepter.
Wen Madness did make Britain dance
The Tragedy of base Mischance
His Practice did his Parts enhance,
And was complete still after.
VIII.
Honest Fellow live content,
Kindly take what GOD has sent,
Think what way to pay thy Rent,
And strive to fly no higher.
He Is a Fool (at any rate)
Medl'th with Affairs of State;
He Will repent when it is too late,
And say that I Am no Liar.
IX.
Fear the LORD, Honor the KING,
Submit to Fate in (every thing)
Do thy business and sing,
And never think on sorrow.
In private Eat thy Honey Comb,
Kiss thy Wife when you are at home;
Never think on what may come,
For none has seen to Morrow.
London, Printed for J H^zzey, 1685.
