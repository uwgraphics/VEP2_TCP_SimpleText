THE PROPOSAL FOR RAISING THE Price of Tin, etc.
HAD we, in the Four last Reigns, exemplified the Policy of the wise Venetians,
to encourage and promote our Trade and Commerce, being posted by Nature on The
Emporium of the World, and being a warlike People, what could we not have done?

A well-managed Trade is the Creator and Preserver of Money, and Money and Trade
are the Sinews of War.

But it does not become me to say much of the Trade of this Nation in general,
it being under the Care of that Honorable Counsel, now, most seasonably,
appointed to inspect the same.

Nevertheless, having a natural Affection for Cornwall, as it is my Native
County, and having informed my self thereof, I take it to be so Rich in it self
by Nature, that Art and Industry might make it exceed all that has been said
by any Author in praise of Zant, the Place we have hitherto been speaking of.

CORNWALL (by the Providence of God) does naturally produce Tin: A Metal, when
fine, is, in its Nature, next to Silver, and is said to have given the Name of
Britain to this Nation; Sams Brit. page 1.
which may engage the King's most Excellent Majesty, as Gods Representative;
and His High Court of Parliament, to have the greater Value and Esteem for it.

Being Environed as it is by the Sea, and having the advantage of good Harbors,
Nature seems to have designed it for a flourishing Trade; and the more, because
that Land not only abounds with the best Tin in the World, and the greatest
Quantities thereof, but the Sea affords it the best Fish also.

And abounding with Tin and Fish, as Zant does with Currants and Wine, as the
Venetians have improved the Trade of Zant, so we should use our utmost
Endeavor to Encourage and Revive the Trade of Cornwall.

NOW the practice of our Factory at Zant, and the method of Policy which the
Venetians made use of when the Western Trade failed them, gave me an occasion
to reflect on the Causes of the Decay of Trade in our naturally rich County of
Cornwall, and to consider of some Means to repair and improve it; and I hope
that the Ingenious Lovers of that County, and of this Kingdom, will contribute
their Assistance to make the Proposal take effect.

WHAT Prices Tin bore, and what Trades were driven thereby in Queen Elizabeth's
time, when we had the absolute Empire of the Ocean, and a flourishing Trade, I
cannot so well inform my Reader as I would.

But some Years before the Restoration, when we had again the Command of the
Seas, That Commodity of Cornwall yielded to the Tinners there 6 l. 5 s. a
hundred Merchants Weight, clear of all Coinage Duties; and then the Income to
that County (by that Commodity only) amounted to 200000 l. Sterling a Years and
upwards.

The Quantities of Tin are now almost the same as formerly, only that Trade
has been, of latter Years, mismanged, to the great Disadvantage both of that
County and the Kingdom, the Price of Tin being now brought down to 50 s. per
Cent, or thereabouts.

For the Cornish Factors are less kind to their Countrymen the Tinners, than
our English Factors are to the Zanteots; and more faithful to the
London-Pewterers, than those are to their English Principals. And (being no
less careful for themselves) as our Factors employ their Merchants Capitals, to
prevent and fore-stall those that employ them; so our Cornish Factors employ
the Stock, remitted to them by the Pewterers, in necessary Materials for
carrying on the Tin-Trade; which Materials they sell at extraordinary Rates to
the laboring Tinners, to be paid for the same in Tin, much under the
Market-price.

And having once got those People into their Debt, they do by Interest and
Extortion always keep them so Poor, that (to gratify the London-Pewterers and
Merchants that employ them, and for another Interest) they compel those poor
Tinners to sell at what Price they please, and by that means do govern the
Market, not only to the great Detriment of the County, but to the Disadvantage
of the Kingdom.

NOW the Tin-Trade being divided into so many Peoples Hands, as those
laboring, adventuring Tinners are, it will be difficult to do them good, but
by a Law Enacted to redress their Grievances; and such a Law, as (being
executed) may have the like effect with that of the Novissima Imposta, when the
Venetians had almost lost the Western Trade.

And we having so far lost our Western Trade of Tin, that the Laboring Tinners
can scarce get their Bread, I am of Opinion that we may regain it with
Advantage, and raise the Price or Tin in some degree, if (after the President
and Example of the Venetians) a Novissima Imposta be laid upon all such as
shall buy and sell Tin in the Counties of Cornwall and Devon, under three or
four Pounds a hundred, or such a Price as The Kings most excellent Majesty, The
right Honorable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and The Honorable the
Commons in Parliament, shall think meet. And Tin being now at 50 s. per Cent,
such an Imposition will be of considerable Advantage to the Nation, both in
general and in particular.

AT 4 l. per Cent. (considering the present Price) the King will gain by the
Benefit and Advantage of his Subjects, although His Majesty should have no more
than his former Duty.

The Kingdom will gain (according to the present Rate of Tin) Three Parts in
Eight of all that is Transported, because the same Quantity being Transported
at that Price, will occasion the Importation of three eighth Parts more in
return, either in Money or Merchandise; For all other Markets are governed by
the first Market-price.

The County in general will gain by it, because Land and Trade are in natural
Sympathy; and the Tinners having 4 l. a hundred for their Tin, will have the
more Money and Credit to support themselves and their Families.

The Cornish Factors will gain by it three eighth Parts in their Provision, if
no more; and this will take away the Occasion of Grinding the Poor to gratify
the Principal, etc.

The London-Pewterers will have the like Advantage, insomuch as they are
Factors for: And I have heard the chiefest of them wish, That the Price of Tin
might never be less than 3 l. a hundred in Cornwall.

And, after all, the principal Merchants can be no Losers by it, if it be true
what a certain Merchant once wrote me at Zant, That the dearer they bought
abroad, the dearer they sold at home.

So that it is as much the Interest of the whole Kingdom to keep up the Price
of Tin in Cornwall, as it was for the Venetians, the Zanteots, and the
Praemorratory, to keep up the Price of Currants at Zant.

AND that it may not be urged, That the advancing the Price of Tin will cause
the less Quantity thereof to be Transported, I must here take notice, That
there is no Part of the known World, besides Cornwall and Devon, that does
produce Tin, unless it be Germany and the East Indies; and the Tin which is
made there, is not so good as our Tin by 20 s. the Hundred; nor can they afford
to sell the same so cheap as 5 l. per Cent.

Neither will the East India or German Tin serve so well as ours, for the very
many Uses which are made thereof throughout the World; and, not to mention its
excellent Usefulness for making Looking-glasses, Lackering, Painting, etc. I am
informed, That the finest Earthen Ware in the World cannot be made without our
Cornish Tin, which occasions so great a Consumption of that Commodity, beyond
what is expended in all common Uses.

And farther it has been observed, That when the greatest Quantities of Tin
have been made in Cornwall, there has been none left Uncoined or Unsold; and
the higher the Price, the better those Quantities have gone off; which (to me)
seems a good Argument of a Necessity the World is under to buy this Commodity
of us: And their Necessity, as well as our great Costs and Charges, and the
Danger and Difficulty of coming at the Tin, should bring us to understand its
true Value, and make our utmost Advantage by it.

And did we make but half the Quantity of Tin, we now do, we might advance that
Quantity to what Price we pleased; and then the one half of the Charges would
be saved also.

The Charge of Deals, Cordage and Iron, which for the most part come from
Norway, the East-Country and Spain, and Eat up a great part of the Profit,
would then be but half as much.

And one half of the Laborers would be employed in the Fishing Trade, etc. and
to improve the Lands by Husbandry, that County being capable of Improvement,
that way, to double the Value it is now off; besides the Advantage that might
be made by a full Improvement of the Fishery, etc.

AND now to show the deplorable Circumstance of the poor, Laboring Tinners, we
will suppose (for Demonstration-sake) there are Eight thousand Tinners Yearly
employed about the Tinning-Trade, although I am satisfied that they much exceed
that Number, who (with their Families) depend upon the Product of their Labor.

And all the Tin coined in Cornwall in the Year, 1692. (which was the Year
before I designed to publish these Grievances) was by the Coinage-Books of that
County 11174 Pieces, and the Coinage-Duty thereof being 4 s. a Hundred in
Cornwall, amounted that Year to 5449 l. 17 s. 00 d. By which it does appear,
That there must have been 27249 hundred Weight of Tin made that Year in
Cornwall only.

And supposing that Quantity sold at 50 s. per Cent. the whole Product of the
Tin made in Cornwall in the Year, 1692. must then come to 69222 l. 10 s. 00. d.
which is a Sum much inferior to the 200000 l. a Year and upwards.

l. s. d. Now out of this 69222 l. 10 s. 00 d. must be paid (clear of all
Charges) to the Bounder and Lord of the Soil for Toll and Farm, about a fifth
part of the whole; which comes to 13844 08 00 The Charges of Smiths Work,
Timber, Ropes and Candles, we compute to each Man in a Year about 20 s. which
for Eight thousand Men, is 8000 00 00 And supposing the Dressing and Stamping,
to make every Hundred of Tin, comes to 2 s. 6 d. it amounts for the whole Years
Tin, to 3406 02 06 The Charges of Refining that Years Tin, at 30 s. the Tide,
computing One thousand of Tin to be Refined in each Tide, comes to 2725 07 00
The Charges of Carrying, and the Expenses at the Refining or Blowing-house, at
10 s. the Tide, comes to 0908 12 04 The whole Sum to be deducted, comes to
28884 09 10

Which being deducted out of the abovesaid 69222 l. 10 s. 00 d. there will
remain clear to be divided among the said Eight thousand Tinners, but 40338 l.
00 s. 02 d. which comes to Five Pounds and Ten Pence and about a half Farthing,
to each Tinner.

And this is all each Tinner has to maintain Himself and Family, and for his
whole Years hard Labor, not only under Ground, but under God knows how-many
Grievances.

But indeed they have been the better able to bear them, as being the most
Herculean and stoutest Men upon Earth; and for their most faithful and loyal
Services, have the greatest Privileges of Liberty and Property, of any People
in the Kingdom.

FOR there are other Grievances relating to the Tin-Trade, which are almost, if
not altogether, as prejudicial as what has been said.

The Cornish Factors, and others, are not the only Causes of the poor Tinners
Misery, the Cornish Lawyers must come in for a Share too: For as the Factors
grind the poor Tinners to gratify the principal Traders, and thereby increase
their Commissions, etc, So the Lawyers (upon the Discovery of a Rich Mine)
(taking the advantage of the Tinners Ignorance in the Stannary Laws, they being
not set forth and Published in Print) do use all Means (by way of pretended
Justice) to right those Clients against the Bounder, the Landlord, or their
Fellow-Adventurers, When in Truth it is in the main a Contrivance to make
themselves Masters of those Mines, and the Profits thereof, and the Tinners the
Slaves only to dig the Oar for them.

And this they the sooner do, because their Fees are so great, and the
Lawsuits (which they create) so delatory, that (in proportion) they exceed all
other Grievances; Whereas the Tinners Privilege (as I am informed) is to have
their Proceedings at Law altogether in English; and, upon Payment of a Penny
only, they are at liberty to appear in Person, and to Speak and Act for
themselves, that their Causes may be the sooner ended.

UPON the whole it may be said, That it is with the Tinner and his Tin, as it
is with the Spaniard and his Silver; And indeed the Tinner takes all the Pain,
and others carry away the Profit.

And, to show my Reader, that our Cornish Tin is valued abroad next to the
Spaniards Silver, I shall hereto add an Account of what part of that Tin, which
(being Coined in Cornwall in the Year, 1692.) was Shipped off at the Port of
London, from the First of January, 1692/3. for one whole Year, with each
Merchants Name, and the several Ports to which the same were sent that Year.

AND now, by the foregoing Particulars, it does, partly, appear how our Tin is
valued and dispersed in the World; and (which is very remarkable) how much of
it goes even to Germany it self; and how all that comes from the East Indies to
Holland, does not divert, or hinder, the Dutch, likewise, from taking great
Quantities of it from us; The Quantities of Un-wrought Tin transported (from
London only) in the Year, 1693. amounting, in the whole, to 61413 hundred
Weight, Besides the Un-wrought Tin transported that Year from other Ports and
Places of the Kingdom; And besides all the Pewter made in England, and Exported
also; which is very considerable.

And the Consideration the^^^ should make us Unite, to Revive, and Advance the
Tin-Trade in Cornwall, and Devon to our own Benefit, with more Reason, Justice,
and Honesty, than The Venetians, the Greeks, and the English Factory did to
recover, and increase the Trade of Venice and Zant, to their Advantage.

AND, in short, it is not impossible (but easy) to raise the Price of Tin, to
redress the Tinners Grievances, and to propose such other Means, as may Raise
the County of Cornwall, and this whole Kingdom, to great Riches and Honor.

NATURE has cut out GREAT BRITAIN to answer the Great Name and Character it
ever had in the Universe: And no Nation can deny, but that it is by Nature The
Emporium of the World, The Center of Trade, and The most Valiant in War.

AND, as Rome became Mistress of the W^^ld, by pursuing such Rules as
Necessity, and Nature (...) taught her; So Nature, and Necessity, have put This
(...) Land and Nation into the most Proper State and Condition of following her
Examples.

Whereby we may raise the Kingdom to a Pitch of Honor and Empire, which Old
England (in all its Glory) was never capable of Acquiring.

FINIS.
