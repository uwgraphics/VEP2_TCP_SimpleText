ADVERTISEMENT.
MR. Ogilby to prevent the Injury designed Him and the Kingdom, by the
Publishers of certain Tables stolen out of his Book (so ignorantly and
carelessly Collected and Printed, that they are filled with false Computations
and Directions; often sending the Traveller 10 or 20 Mile out of the Way) did
Print his own Tables in 4 Broad-sides, with his Name to each Sheet, which he
has now Reprinted in Octavo, with the Addition of many more Roads, and a true
Account of the Markets and Fairs, Collected from the Towns themselves in his
Actual Survey, the Price 1 s. in Sheets, and a large Sheet-Map of England with
all the Roads, fitted to Bind with the Book, the Price of the Map 1 s.

Sold by the Author at his House in White-Fryers, and by Mr. Cade Stationer, at
the Royal Exchange in Cornhil; Mr. Isted, at the Anchor against St. Dunstans
Church in Fleet Street; Mr. Harding, at the Bible and Anchor, at the West End
of St. Paul's; Mr. Pask, at the Stationers Arms and Ink-bottle, under the
North-side of the Royal Exchange; Mr. Morden, at the Atlas in Cornhil; Mr.
Cadman, in the lower Walk of the New-Exchange in the Strand, Mr. Not, at the
King and Queens Arms in the Pall Mall; and by several Booksellers and
Stationers.

And Itinerarium Angliae: Or, The Book of Roads, containing a Hundred
Whole-Sheet Maps; expressing, at one Mile in an Inch, all Things observable in
the Travelling-Part of England and Wales, the Price 40 s.

The Maps of any the several Roads fitted to bind up in a Pocketbook, are also
Sold, the Price 6 d. a-sheet.

And several large Prints and Maps of Mr. Ogilby's, viz. Adam and Eve,
Jerusalem in two Sheets, Solomon's Temple, Edenborough in two Sheets, King's-
lyn, Tangier: America, Carolina, Jamaica, Maryland, Barbado's, Midlesex, Kent,
etc. At reasonable Rates.

This is also to give Notice, That the Sheet-Map of London, mentioned in the
Printed Catalogue of Books last Term, said to be Published by J. O. is not Mr.
Ogilby's, for he resolves to Publish his Map with a Scale of Feet, that the
Truth may be Examined, which, this Counterfeit wants: The true Map will be
suddenly Finished, and because there are several false Maps preparing, you are
desired for the future, to Receive nothing for Mr. Ogilby's, that has not his
Name, and Title of His Majesty's Cosmographer to Warrant it.

EXPLANATION.
EAch Page is Divided into two Collumes, where, having read the Title and
principal Towns contained in that Road, you begin the Left Hand Collume and
read to the Bottom, unless struck through with a Black-Line, which always
directs to begin the next Collume. For Example,

No 3. Page 4. You must not read, York, Newcastle, Durham, Barwick, but, York,
Durham; Newcastle, Barwick, as if they stood all under one another, as No 1.
Page 2. where having read both Collumes, and Ending at Aberistwith; you begin
the 3d. Page with the Branch to Buckingham, the Four Towns at the Beginning you
read as before, and then begin the First Collume, at, To Vxbridg, etc. whence,
proceeding to Little Missenden, you begin again at the Top, not at Ailsbury,
but at Great Missenden. And so of the Rest.

I. The 15 great Roads from London to the Extent of England and Wales, as,
Holyhead, Barwick, Dover, Rye, etc. are Placed Alphabetically, and Numbered 1,
2, 3, 4, etc. the Letter of the last Town taking place: As, No 1. is the Road
to Oxford, Worcester, and Lempster, yet Aberistwith being the Extent, it is
Placed in A. So the Road to York Durham, and Newcastle, continuing to Barwick,
is Placed in B.

II. Immediately after each great Road, you have the Principal Branches: As,
next after the Road to Oxford, and so to Aberistwith, you have the Roads from
London, 1st. to Buckingham, and next to Montgomry.

And to avoid Repeating, you are Referred to the foregoing great Road for the
several Towns and their Distances, till you come where you are to leave that
great Road, as in the Branch to Buckingham, after the Names of 4 of the chief
Towns, viz. Am^rsham, Wendover, Ailsbury, Buckingham, you begin the Left Hand
Collume, and find To Vxbridg in No 1. where you may find the Towns and Distance
from London to Vxbridg, as aforesaid. And so in the next Branch, which is the
Road from London to Montgomery, you are Referred to No 1. for the Towns from
London to Worcester; where you leave the Aberistwith Road and go to Hallow,
which is from Worcester computed 2 Mile, but by Measure, 2 Miles six Furlongs,
or 2 Mile 3 quarters.

Of these Branches you have 22. which end with London to Harwich, Page 20.
where begin the Cross and Accidental Roads from one City or Town to another,
the Town whence the Road issues taking place in the Alphabet, as, Arundel to
Chichester, Bristol to Chester, Chester to Hollywel, and York to Chester, etc.
At the beginning of each Road you have 2, 3, or 4. of the principal Towns upon
that Road, either from London or other great Towns, as in the Holyhead Road, No
10. Page 11 and 12. you have the Road from London to Coventry; in Letter C. of
the Cross Roads, you have the Road from Cambridg to Coventry; in P. 30
Gloucester to Coventry; in Page 38. Oxford to Coventry; that by the Towns at the
beginning of each Road, you may readily find what you Desire.

You have the Computation by Miles, the Measure by Miles and Furlongs, directed
by M. and M. F. over-head. Where there is no Figures, that Town is not a Mile
from the next, or admit of some odd Parts, not easily supplied in the
Computation, and there fore you are to Reckon from the last Number to the next
Town with Figures: As, in No 1. Page 2. from London to Kensington Gravelpits it
is accounted 3. Mile, but from the Standard in Cornhil it is measured 5 Mile;
thence to Acton, passing Shepherds Bush, it is Computed 3 Miles, but by measure
3 Mile 3 Furlongs. And so of the Rest.

The Numbers with the Towns at the beginning of each Road, is the general
Distance from London, or the Principal Town; rekoning always from the Standard
in Cornhil or near the Center of each other City or Town.

Cities are in Capitals, Market Towns in Italique, and Post-Towns marked thus *
as Page 4. * Waltham Cross is a Post and not a Market Town, Hodsdon is a
Market, but no Post-Town, * Ware is both Market and Post.

The Markets and Fairs are put Alphabetically, beginning with the Towns Name.
