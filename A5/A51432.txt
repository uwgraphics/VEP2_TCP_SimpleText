TO THO. COKE, Esquire OF MELBOURN IN Darbyshire.
SIR,
MEn are now grown so universally jealous of what is offered 'em, that not so
much as a Book can have any credit in the World without security. This humor,
Sir, has drawn the trouble of this Address upon you. Not that I am so vain, as
to expect you should Answer for my performance* but because I know the World
will not venture absolutely to condemn, what you are pleased to Patronize. It
is so customary for Writers to give great Encomiums of their Patrons, though
never so ^ndeserv'd, that it fre^uently renders even a ^ust Character
suspected. ^Tis true, most that have ^f late appeared in Print, whether by
Imprudence, or Design, have made choice of such Men, that the Author, and his
Patron, look like two Bankrupts bound for one another. But, Sir, I am so far
from apprehending any such Censure upon this occasion, that I doubt not, but
even those the shall despise my Labo^ and condemn my Perfo^mance, twill approve
m^ choice of you, and a^low of my Judgment. (...) dare not, for two Re^sons,
attempt you^ Character; for if I di^ all that have the Honor to know you,
would a^cuse me of Deficiency and those that have not would suspect me of
Flattery: Two faults, in my opinion, no less obvious than inexcusable. I am not
Ignorant that Dedicators, like Lovers, are commonly expected to say fine
things, without regard either to Reason, or Merit; but I am conscious, I speak
to one, as much above Flattery, as beyond the reach of my Panegyric. The World
may indeed justly wonder, to find at so few Years, such opposite Qualities
reconciled; as the spirit, vigor, and warmth of Youth, with the self Command,
Sagacity, and prudent caution of many Years Experience. I might very easily
enlarge on a Subject so copious, and be Rhetorical without the help of
Invention. But my Task must here be much harder; while I contract my Thoughts,
for fear of a contradiction, scarce avoidable, which is, by saying at once too
much and too little: Too much; to be credited by Strangers; and too little, to
do you Justice. But to be more particular in your Character, were Impertinence,
since you, like the Sun at Noon, need no description to be distinguished.

This Piece is originally Italian. A Country, in all Ages, Celebrated, as much
for the Wit of its Inhabitants, and the subtility and delicacy of their
Imaginations, whose spirits seem to be refined by the very Air they breath in,
as its Ancient Conquests, or the present Fertility, Salubrity, and Pleasure of
its Soil and Climate. But why do I thus presume to talk to you of Italy or its
People? Who, besides your natural Advantages, are so much the better Judge, by
having been an Honor to your own Country in theirs, and are so well known to,
and admired by 'em.

The Design of this Book is very good; and had it been as fortunate^y Executed,
as it was well projected, I see no reason why it should have been Inferior to
any of the Mythologies of An^iquity, or latter Ages. But to deal ingenuously,
in my opinion, the Author has not been so happy in the Conduct of his Design,
as in the Invention of it. But he has this, for his excuse, that it was writ
above twenty Years since. Nevertheless, the judicious Reader, will meet with a
great many prettynesses, to recompense his Curiosity, and here, and there
Strong, Sound, and manly Satyr. Nay, he will every where, find the true Spirit,
and delicacy of an Italian; enough to recommend it to our Language, and
Perusal. I should say something, now for my own performance, but that I Will
leave ^o the Censure of others, who will be sure to judge for themselves, as it
is but reasonable they should. I can only add, that I have endeavored to
correct some Faults in the Original, as much as was consistent with the
Expedition designed; and where there were none, I have done my best to do the
Author Justice.

As for the Reception it is like to have in the World, I am little sollic^tous
about it, and valu^ no Man's Censure, Your only excepted, any farther than it
may prejudice an honest Book seller who has endeavored in this Translation, to
humor the Novelty hunters of the Age For on his profit depends my chiefest
satisfa^on; unless it be in pleasing, and being approved of by you, the
severity of whose Judgment, I cannot but apprehend and fear, notwithstanding
the greatness of your Native Candor. Yet I hope you will let my Respect atone
for the meanness of my Abilities; and Excuse, as well the Failures, as the
Presumption of him, that will be proud to submit to your Censure, and no less
to Subscribe,

SIR, Your Most Humble and Devoted Servant, JO. SAVAGE.

THE Author's Dedication TO THE ACADEMY OF THE CURIOUS.
Gentlemen,
THat Beasts have spoken is not my Invention, but appears by the accounts of
many Authors, amongst whom Co^nelius Gemma in (...) first Book De Divine
Naturae Characteristmi^ and the 8th. Chapte^ writes thus, Bruta qu^dem
aliquando huma^ voce profari, ac futura pra^ dicere, certum est. I^ primis
exempla Asinae B^laam. Plinius locutum ga^lum gallinaceum dixit A^ urbis
conditae DCLXX w^ Eusebius bovem in subu^biis Romae paulo ant^ Tullii mortem
frustra s^ urgenti, dicentem, quod ^on frumenta, sed Homi^es essent prope diem
de ^turi Ao. urbis DCCX. and in this Age, Father ^oseph a Carmelite of St.
Mary's, and barefooted Apo^le to the Kingdoms of the Malauri, in his first
Expe^ition to the East Indies, ^ives you an account of the Properties of many
Terre^rial, and Volatile Animals, and amongst the rest affirms, That the
Kings-Fishers in those parts spoke so well that he himself at first believ^ 'em
to have been Boys. A^ moreover, that Beasts ha^ writ, Horo in his fourteen^
Hieroglyphick and first Bo^ relates in these words: E^ apud Aegyptios natio
qu^dam and genus Cynoceph^ lorum qui literas noru^ Quapropter ubi primu^ in
sacram Aedem ductu^ fuerit Cynocephalus ta^ bellam ei sacerdos Apponit, una cum
scirpeo style atque attramento, nimirum, ut periculum faciat sitne ex eo
Cynocepha^orum genere qui litera^^^gnari sunt, and an lit^eras pingat; pingit
itaque ^n ea tabella litteras etc. But now because to some of the wisest
Critics, it may seem ridiculous for me farther to affirm that Beasts are
capable of Titles; I shall give you an example of a Dog, who hearing himself
called Sir, immediately forgot his natural Fierceness. It Is related by Justus
Lipsius, (an Author of undoubted Reputation) in the first Ce^tury of his
Epistles A Belgas, Ep. 45.
in these word Memini historiolae facet cui Author Petrus Cieca ait se cum
aliquot sodal^bus egressum ad Indo vestigandos. Canem cemitem habuisse ad is it
longo usu doctum: Ecc^ Femina vetula appare^ fugit in montes, canis a^
sequitur, and jam praehendebat; illa in genua se ab jicit, canem Dominum
appellat, and blande orat^ ac paene adorat. Ille pla^tus an contemnens crus
^llit and foeminam illam ^ermingit atque sic abiit. When therefore Beasts ^oke,
they also made use of ^e Post reciprocally to com^unicate their thoughts and
^terests, and writ a great^ any Letters, which if they ^ad been all Printed
they ^ould undoubtedly have ex^eded the number of those of ^e like Nature,
which now^days so unreasonably stuff Libraries.

Now I having recove^ these few from the hands Time, with a great deal pains,
and industry, do pres^ to Dedicate 'em to you G^^tlemen of the Academy of
Curious, rather than (...) single great Man. But would not have you persw^ your
selves that they (...) those that Ferrante Pa^vicino promised to the le^ned
World so long time si^ for his ingenious Pen wo^ disdain to be employed ab^
such mean Compositions.

And now if to any of you, ^rs, the style seems low and ^ean, I must desire you
to ^member they are Letters, ^d therefore writ to immi^te common Discourse, and
^pply the defects of Absence. ^lso that they were the Works (...) Beasts, and
writ at a time ^en there was no ^eve to be found to ^parate the Flower from the
^ran. Academia della Crusca.


Accept therefore I beseech (...), of my humble Acknow^dgments in this poor
present, which deserves at le^ some Mercy, though it be w^thy of no Praise, since
it Dedicated to your Mer^ And I promise your Curi^tyships, if you can give
(...) any Encouragement, a Tr^tise of something more pr^table and pleasant. In
(...) mean time, live healthy a^ happy, and pardon me, if y^ can, since I am
but lit^ Charge to you.

To his very Ingenious Friend, on the occasion of his Translation, and
Improvements of Letters of Beasts from the Italian.
WHat Counter-charm, what Magick's this,
That can such wondrous fears perform,
Perverting Nature, and their bliss;
Can to Man's Image, Brutes deform?
Thrice happy Brutes! in native St^
Ambition, nor no foolish cause,
That us inflame, can raise your hat^
That live and act by Nature's L^
Content within the Bounds she sets,
You only for her wants provide;
And scorning Luxury or Treats,
With Bellies full are satisfied.
The sole Buffoon of all your kind
Active, mischievous, foolish, vai^
The Ape, is likest us designed,
In Nature's migniature a Man.
Men have mistaken Circe's charm;
By Wisdom she so won the Mind,
She could Men's uncouth Lusts disarm,
And their unruly Passions bind.
B^ more surprising Art you show,
Anti- Circean charms entice;
(...) native Innocence o'erthrow,
And debauch Brutes with human Vice.
^s from thee, Italy, we bring,
The artful mistress of all Vice;
^s just the Medicine there should spring,
From whence the malady had rise.
^re to thy skilful Pains we owe,
Whose learned Pen to form has brought
^e Wit, which (though it there did grow)
Came undigested and unwrought.
^t Men their follies thou do show,
Which they in Beasts reproved can hear,
and on their Backs corrected know,
What on their own they ought to bear.
Thy Rival Power and Nature's Vi^
Since thou in Brutes controul'st thus,
Once more, Great Vertuoso, try,
Transfuse their Innocence to us.

TO THE ^INGENIOUS ^RANSLATOR.
^F British Ornaments can add such grace,
^d make so lovely an Italian face;
^en we may judge, if we with the^ compare,
^at all our English Natives, Bounties are.
It Is sure, (...) Country beasts a Ric^er Soil,
^r learnings product, than our fertile Isle;
and though some times we borrow, or make use
^f what the Learned in other Clymes produce.
We still repay, what is more than fit,
And only loose, by this Commer^ Wit:
Such Foreign Authors, as we (...) to Paint
In English Colors, no Improve^ want.
But in the same Majestic form pear,
And full as charming as before were:
Witness this piece, in such a (...) arrayed;
As courts the Mind, and does the persuade.
The first design, was great; seemed to show
It Is perfect Glory, was reserved now:
A Noonday brightness, does that s^ adorn,
Which was at first, but painted by Morn.
It Is you (Sir) only, who could with success,
^nsform this Tract, and make the Fables please,
^e depth of Language; and of Foreign Style:
^y rack the Mind, and still our hopes beguile.
^t you, who know the Hetrurian Tongue so well;
^n Copy best, and in that Art excel:
^ere we may find the weighty Oar improved;
^e Bullion purged, and all the Dross removed.
^ue, sterling Wit; without the Tinsel grace
(...) praevious Periods; or of needless Phrase:
^ow eloquent each Letter does appear,
and yet the Saytr is not less severe!
^n even judgment, does the Sense control;
and flowing sweetness, beautifies the whole:
Ah! that you would proceed to (...) know,
What we, to you, and Italy shall (...)
And make a farther progress to ^plore
The wealth of Latium, and detect store:
By this one favor, we shall more ^pect;
And wish we might a greater debt ^tract.
Like desperate Bankrupts, who in ^tune Poor;
Still run in debt, and still would bor^ more:
Though without hopes, to quit their for^ Score.

Yet to the Original, how just, how true.

Such strokes improved, and yet so really like,
that none but thee, could have this Work outdone,

^he Leopard to the Rhinoceros.
I Address my self to your Honor, not to justify any Error, because I know I
am guilty of none; but prevent the Calumnies of Evil-^inded people from
wounding my ^eputation. My Enemies accuse me ^s I hear from my friends) of
taking upon me the Practice of a Physician, ^d for presuming to get an easy
pe^y of the people of Alessano, Metro^olis of Lucadia. I call it an easy
^enny; for if I were to choose a thousand times, I could not hit upon
advantageous a Calling. For wh^ as before, being reputed (what I (...) still
under another Title,) I was (...) and anon accused of Murders c^mitted in the
Forests, though at the (...) time I were never so innocent; w^ made me always
upon my Gua^ and careful not to fall into t^ Snares, so that I were never al^
free from Fatigue and Vexation. (...) now by means of this Blessed A^ am
delivered from such Fears. (...) if any of my Patients through my M^ chance to
die (without being a^^ of the Laws) I defend my self (...) my Ignorance with
affirming (...) transgrest my prescriptions: Someti^ I blame the weakness of
their Co^tutions, sometimes the use of W^ and in short every smallest Irregu^ty
which commonly signified (...) little to the Distemper. Now by t^ means I am
not only free from ^^nishment, but in the greatest li^^hood in the World to get
a great state; for over and above my Com^on Fee, if my Patient recovers he
^wards me plentifully; and if he dies ^s Heir is seldom ungrateful for the
^nefit he has received. And now ^^cause every one ought to support his
^^ofession with Common Decorum, though it were never so easy for me to ^^cover
any one, with the meanest ^erb that grows in the Field; yet, ^r the honor of
Physic, I am forbid (...) do it; but, on the contrary, am ^blig'd to stuff my
Recipe's with ex^^avagant and unpalatable Names. ^oreover, for the farther
Glory of ^hysick, at my first Visit I always ^ighten the Patient and his
Friends, ^ith my Opinion, That he is a dead ^an; and, to give the greater
Credit (...) what I say, I order Medicines ^^rong enough for an Horse, and
con^^ne him to a rigorous Diet. I beg ^our Honor to be farther satisfied of ^y
Reasons. When I write a Recipe, (...) always order abundantly more than (...)
necessary, because by the Apothecary's Gain my Wealth is encreas^ for he
commonly considers how m^ I have been his Friend. Now by t^ Art I rob the Purse
of its Soul, a^ the Body oftentimes of its Breath. (...) it not therefore seem
unlawful to y^^ Honor, because it may appear to rather the effect of Avarice
and Vi^ny, than Charity; for it is an all^ed Maxim in the Mouths of all M^ Quod
Galenus dat Opes: And if we (...) denied the Means, how can we m^ the Saying
good? I humbly into therefore your often approved Gene^^sity, to represent
favorably to (...) Majesty these my Reasons, that o^ Men's Envy may not
unjustly t^ place of my Innocence; whilst I s^ long for all Occasions of
acknowle^^ments, and expressing my self Yo^ etc.

LETTER II. The Rhinoceros his Answer. Upon the same.
SIR,
HIS Majesty the Lion, has commanded me to signify to you, that having had
your Reasons in ma^re Consideration, they have been ^und very advantageous to
your ^ame and Profession: For the Censors ^^ving examined 'em strictly, and
be^g satisfied of their Worth and Vali^ty, have reported to his Majesty, ^^at a
Physician is no less necessary in Commonwealth, than a Soldier; and ^^at the
Invention of Money is very ^equisite for both their encouragements; for as the
one with his Igno^^nce, the other might with his Sword ^eep the Provinces
moderately peo^led, that there might be neither dan^er of Rebellion, or
Subjects starving for want of Bread. And because (...) oftentimes Poverty
raises Tumults, is permitted the Physician to kill wh^ and as many as he
pleases, and (...) Soldier to Dragoon and Cut throats often as he can. Proceed
theref^ cheerfully in the Profession you h^ begun; and, for your farther Licen^
His Majesty has been pleased to gr^ you his Letters Patent, with (...) Power
and Authority, command all Magistrates, Chief Physicians, (...)
Super-Intendants of Health, that t^ do not presume to molest you in (...)
least; but on the contrary, to be ^ing and assisting you as often as the should
be found occasion. But y^ must remember notwithstanding, t^ you are not allowed
to exact up^ your Patients; for though his Majesty pleased to wink at Murder,
yet (...) will not forgive you any Extorti^ for that being only reserved to
(...) Public Collectors, it will not be c^venient to suffer it to be practi^
by any others. Observe this, (...) you will oblige your self and your ^riend, etc.

LETTER III. The Cat to the Ass. Upon the Law.
SIR,
THE Bearer of this is my Client, who has been so suf^ciently influenced by my
Inclinations (...) serve you, that he has offered him^^lf to be recommended to
you for ^dvice. He has been in Law a great ^hile; and his Suit has been
unmerci^^lly followed by me ever since: ^ut at length finding that his Case
^equired the Assistance of some more ^earned and Able Advocate, I thought (...)
could not do him better Service, than ^o send him to you; by whom the Me^its of
his Cause being better under^^ood, might be the more judiciously handled. I
have bubbled him as lo^ as ever I could; yet I don't think (...) has had any
reason to complain: (...) at the same time that I have set (...) Night and Day,
and worn out (...) very Nails, to bring his Cause to (...) Trial, I have not
neglected to light his Purse, that he might be the mo^ nimble in the Hall in
its prosecutio^ After this manner I have hones^ done my best Endeavors to
person the part of a good Attorney. (...) pleased to accept therefore of this
(...) good Will, since it has no other c^ than your Riches and Honor. T^^
Gentleman has a good Estate and a ^lerable Understanding, so that I m^ safely
leave him to the rest of (...) Apology. I do not mention any father Instances,
because I am satisfy^ of your Generosity; but with a du^ful Acknowledgment of
your man Obligations, subscribe, etc.

LETTER IV. The Ass's Answer. Upon the same.
SIR,
I Have accepted your good will toward me in sending a rich Client with a
great deal of Acknowledgment; and I Will assure you I shall endeavor not to seem
ungrateful, by ta^ing the greater care of his Cause. And ^ho' some People take
me for an Ass, because I am a mere Lawyer; yet I shall give 'em to understand
that they ^re deceived, though they will be still ^ailing at the Noble Study of
the Digests and Codes, as being too laborious and confused, and always
preferring their loose idle Arts of Poetry and Pe^antry. Be pleased therefore
to know that in byassing a Judge, I boast a singular Talent; for I can so
confound a Cause with subtle persuasions, that it shall be impossible for any
one (...) find out the Truth; and then I am (...) great a Master of the Art of
Wranglin^ that I can split one Action into a tho^sand, and so oblige my Clients
to (...) manifold Acknowledgments of m^ Trouble, and consequently to as
numerous Fees. In short, my Clie^ never goes from me unsatisfied: For if my
Adversary be never so able, an^ put me often to a seeming Non-plu^ yet I have
always some trick in reserv^ to baffle his Argument, so that I oftentimes make
him say what he never meant or thought of. And moreove^ if our Cause happen to
come before a^ ignorant Judge, as it may very often do, few now adays giving
themselves the trouble to study much; then yo^ may be assured the Victory will
be^ ours; for my Arguments have alway^ most Energy upon them. And now before I
prepare my self for you^ Friend's defense, I must acquaint you shall shear his
Hide well, and that you must not take it ill if I should make bold sometimes
with a piece of his skin; for if any Profession deserves a Reward, surely that
of an Advocate ought to be the most sensible. I am of Opinion therefore, that
of all the Tyrannical Laws of Nero, that was the severest, which commands, Vt
causarum Patroni sine Mercede aut Muneribus causis adessent, related by
Ma^ichio in Tract. de Arbitr. Jud. Lib. 2. Cent. 4. Cons. 369. Nu. 2. For if he
had been acquainted with that Saying of Lipsius in his 52 Epistle, and 2
Century, Quod dii bona laboribus vendunt, I believe he never would have
promulgated so barbarous a Law; moreover the reason why we are so well paid for
our Pleading (and which the Ignorant Vulgar affords no better name to than
Robbery and Extortion) ^s founded upon the highest Equity imaginable, for if we
scarce have ever a Minutes rest and are always wasting our Brains upon Books
for another profit; why should not their Purses evaporate their Substance for
our refreshment. But now I promise you upon the Wo^^ of a Man of Honor and
Conscienc^ that your Client's Cause shall be first di^spatch'd, and that
speedily; for I kno^ very well that a good Advocate Deb^ studere brevitati and
non disputationib^ and truffis, which many now adays do as we are taught by
Paris de Puteo i^ suo tractatu de syndicatu in verbo Advocati. Therefore being
naturally a^ Enemy to long Discourses and Arguments, I can the easier confess,
I thin^ Contradictions and Disputes fit for nothing else but to conceal Truth,
an^ Oppress ones Neighbor: Whereupon I am content to follow the Precepts o^
our Great Master Justinian, who i^ Authen. de Referendariis, teaches (...) Quod
virtus in modicis consistit. When these prating Fellows do but frighte^ their
Clients, and confound the Judge and so gain little or nothing by the Bargain:
If you can therefore follow these my Sentiments, you will certainly find 'em
profitable and weighty (...) whilst I heartily subscribe my sel^ Your
Well-wisher and Friend, etc.

LETTER V. The Ant to the Toad. Upon Trade.

as not to be d^couraged though I am convinced to be the wrong, for then my
Impudent is greatest, when my Argument is w^kest, for I can so wind 'em, and
tu^ 'em, and baffle 'em, and run 'e^ down; that with the least Motion my hand I
can make 'em of m^ mind, tho they are never so much e^clin'd to the contrary.
In short if ye please to send me a list of your Good you shall have no reason
to doubt (...) my Managing the Buyers; This I promise you upon my word, and

send you a list of my ^oods: In the first place I have a great ^antity of

Darkness, and Dark^^ss by Light. 3. A great number of ^asks for those Judges
that would palliate their Injustice, and appear Court double-fac'd to deceive
the Ignorant and trepan the Cunning. 4. So^ thousands of hopping Monkeys, (...)
those that having read S -- e's Rhim^ and D -- y's Reasons, have had

Works come into the hands. 7. A few of Galilaeus's Tu^ which representing
things the small and most distant; for great and near, a^ proper for Courtiers,
who believe themselves possessed of Honors whilst the are only Infamies and
dangerous P^cipices, which oftentimes turn to their ^in. 8. Abundance of Horse
bits for ^ose Libertines that licentiously carp (...) Princes, and
industriously endea^our to expose their Follies, whilst they ^^nnot conceal
their own. 9. A great ^any Fans to cool those angry Men ^ith, who will be
continually reven^ng themselves upon Flies for sucking their sour blood. 10.
Some gilded ^orns for Cuckolds, who not only ^ive way to their Wives
debaucheries, ^ut think themselves the more honou^ed; and never cease to laugh

your self, or any of your Friends ha^ occasion, they may be fitted with (...)
Degrees at my Shop; make me the^fore sensible of the reality of your pr^mises,
and you shall find me grateful^ Yours, etc.

LETTER VII. The Goat to the Pig. On the Prodigal.
I Know (Sir,) your Agonies for the death of your Father, cannot ^e well
mitigated with Ink, because ^hey are too intense, nevertheless my ^eart that is
willing to express your ^fflictions, communicates these dolo^ous Drops to my
Pen, that I may ac^uaint you with my concern rather ^han Administer any Comfort
to your Troubles: Let it be notwithstanding ^ome relief to you to consider that
all ^iving Creatures are subject to Death, and also that you are left sole Heir
^o an opulent Patrimony, there being ^one to divide with you those Acorns which
before you could not call your own. I am not a little pleased to find you so
full of dutiful demonstrations of Love toward him that gave you your Being?
And not like some p^fligate Sons, that rather rejoice the mourn at their
Fathers Funeral Whilst they propose to themselves loose idle Life and a
ridiculous pleas^^ of spending all they have. Dispose yo^ self therefore to
continue in the p^dent course you have begun, and (...) pleased to make use of
me as often (...) you shall find occasion. So wishing y^ all prosperity, I
subscribe, etc.

LETTER VIII. The Pig's Answer. Upon the Same.
YOur Generous concern for t^ loss of my Dear and Loving F^ther, obliges me but
to an humble r^turn of thanks for it is altogether o^ of my Power to gratify
your Advi^ at full, since it has put a stop to m^ Sorrows, and dried up all my
Tea^ ^or having made an exact reflection upon your Words, I have been resolved
^r the future to lead a serene and quiet ^fe, since you have sufficiently
satis^'d me it is not in the Power of tears (...) recall an expired Breath.
It Is true, ^y Patrimony is opulent; so great per^aps, that it makes me rather
the ob^ct of Envy than Love: Neverthe^ess, I am resolved to enjoy my self and
^end with pleasure what he has heapt together with so much Toil and La^our. I
consider he was in years, and (...) a violent Death had not prevented ^im, he
could never have lived much ^onger. He has fared well in his time, and now Fate
has shown herself so for^ard to oblige me; Why should I go about to Stent my
self? I think I have ^o reason, and to convince you the ^etter of the Force of
your Consolati^ns, the first thing I shall do will be ^o pardon his Murderers.
In short, I ^m resolved to mind nothing else but ^ndulging and Fatning my self,
and ^eave to others the case of Revenges. For I should be a Fool indeed, if
(...) the sake of the dead I should exp^ my self to the snares of the living
(...) mean the Lawyers, who in this Kin^dom are more greedy than any wh^
Insomuch that there is scarce a p^^ free from the Sacrilege of their gri^^ I am
happy in being thus guided (...) your Advice, and which will alw^^ have an
unsurmountable Influe^ upon Yours, etc.

LETTER IX. The Ferret to the Squirrel. Upon Justice.
YOU honor me too much, (...) whilst you oblige me with y^^ Commands; and I am
not a little (...) happy, that my endeavors in favo^ of the Cat could not
prevail upon (...) slight a Theft, for I tried all wa^ with the Chambermaid to
take (...) ^er Evidence, that she might not pro^cute the Stealing a poor piece
of ^heese with so much rigor, but she ^ntinued still deaf to my Entreaties,
^^d positively insisted upon a total Re^itution. I have always observed in
^dges, Attorneys, and such like Peo^^e, so great an Avarice, that I never ^^ed
for having any thing to do with ^^em; for Justice has no other Ori^ine, than
Covetousness of Gain, and ^espises all Acts of Mercy as much as (...) does the
Humility of Prayers. For his poor Criminal having no Money ^t Command, was
instantly condem^ed to the Pillory. But nevertheless ^e was pitied by the Mob,
rather than ^olested; for they considered it a ^reater Crime in the Maid's
Negli^ence, than his Hunger, which has no ^aw, and therefore could not deserve
^o severe a Punishment; severe I call (...) to him, but to Common Thieves it
^erves as well for a Triumph as an Ig^ominy. Now he is out of Goal; but
^evertheless banished the Province under an unmerciful penalty if he (...)
turn, I pity him extremely as I (...) his Friend; but, for the future, i^ has
any Wit, he will give a better Col^ for his Proceedings, and then he (...) pass
for both honest and honoura^ If he had robbed by the Gross, (...) might have
secured himself; for (...) your little Rogues only that su^ when your great
ones know how (...) avoid and stop the mouth of Justice (...) the future I beg
you to make us^ your Commands, without any Ap^gy, and to afford me a larger
Fiel^ (...) display my Obedience, that I (...) with Actions more conformable
(...) my Duty express the abundant ^knowledgments of, etc.

LETTER. X. The Squirrel's Answer. Upon the same.
THE extraordinary Goodness that has obliged you to so zea^s a Defense of the
poor Cat, is so ^^ch the greater, by your pretermit^g no opportunity of
acquainting me ^th it; and I am so much the oftener ^gag'd to beg of you to
think of some^ng wherein I might discharge part (...) your Obligations, and not
always ^d my self under the burden of so any Benefits, without either the
Ju^ce or good Nature to ease my self, (...) repay you. Truly that Wretch, those
Misfortune it is to be under the ^ntence of such rash Judges, is ex^mely to be
pitied. And be pleased receive this as an irrefragable Truth, that bad Officers
are such, by the ^tentions of them, that advanced 'em; for they exercise a
burdensome T^ with a tacit License to do wrong, (...) how should they be able
to answer (...) unreasonable Impositions laid upon 'em? He that is rich, easily
conquers (...) seeming Impossibilities; but he tha^ poor, is subject to every
Calami^ Prisons are only fit to punish poor p^^ple, who have no Money to buy
(...) their Fetters: When rich Men, w^ a golden Key, discharge all the
str^^gest Locks, and avoid the justest P^nishments, whilst, with the luster of
the dazzling Gold, they blind the eyes of the weak Judges, and in spite of the
gr^test Crimes appear innocent. No^ our Friend had been but able to h^^ greased
the Fists of this greedy F^ternity with a tolerable Recompe^^ he had not been
exposed to so i^mous a Punishment. Oh Villainy (...) Unnatural to Public
Authority! W^ a shame is it that the World sho^^ so continually contaminate
Nero (...) the Author of all sorts of Wicked^ when he could safely say, Quod
(...) (...) penetralibus suis venale aut ambi^^ni pervium! Let us comfort
there^^e the Cat, since he suffered only for that which his Necessities forced
him ^o, whilst I heartily wish you the ac^omplishment of all your Desires and
Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XI. The Camel to the Spaniel. Upon Baylies.
SOme few days since, I had the good fortune to have for my Guest a Gentleman
of great account in this Kingdom of Congo; who, amongst other things, related
to me that you were entered into the King's Service: And without having any
respect either ^o your own Birth, or the unspotted Honor of your Ancestors,
were corrupted with a thousand Debaucheries. I must confess, at first, I was
very much startled at this News; but more (...) specially, when he added that
'tw^ the common Talk, that your Gen^ inclined you to the infamous Exerc^ of a
Bailey. But I can scarce belie^ that your Noble Education, togeth^^ with
Reflections on the Worth of yo^ Parents, with the Spurs of Honor, a^^ the
Opprobrium of the World, should n^ prove sufficient Motives to remove yo^
detestable Resolutions. Return the^fore, I beseech you, to your self, an^ do
not suffer your Imprudence to lea^ you to your ruin: For Reputation once lost,
can scarce ever be recovered. And the blots of Infamy (...) water can wash
away. If I were a^quainted with the cause that gives (...) great disturbance to
your Brain, (...) would endeavor to remove it with proportionable means.
Contain yo^self then within the bounds of Reason, till I can learn it; for
otherwi^^ you will have cause to complain only of your self, and not to blame
the Malignity of your Destiny. He that obstinately meets his own ruin, sure
deserves but little pity. We ought to be on our guard against those that would
offend us. Thus priding my self in having had the honor of teaching you how to
avoid a certain Evil, And wishing you all imaginable Prosperity, I Subscribe,
etc.

LETTER XII. The Spaniel's Answer. Upon Honor.
YOur angry Letter would be sufficient to make a considerable breach in my
mind, and to make me yield my self wholly conquered by your Admonitions, did
not the persuasion I have of your Ignorance of the Honors, and particular
Prerogatives, that Baylies enjoy in this Kingdom, animate me to sustain the
fiercest Assaults of your Pen. I would desire you therefore to distinguish
between a common Bailey, and their Head or Su^rior; for if I were of this first
sort, could certainly have no way to exc^ my self of the Infamy I had
cont^cted, but in the second rank my P^ is much more considerable, for (...)
that I reasonably claim the Hono^ due to a Knight. A Title that in the days has
been bought both with Blo^ and Gold. Be pleased to tell me mo^^ over what are
the Common Ensig^ that make a Knight? Are they not (...) Sword and Cross? Now I
want n^ther of these, for I always wear (...) broad Sword by my side; and, for
(...) Cross, I bear on my Breast a great M^dal of Gold. I must convince yo^
farther: For if it has been the custom amongst all the Europa^^ Nations, to
imitate the French in we^ring a Collar about their Necks as (...) Mark of
particular Honor conferr^ on 'em, why should I be said to bl^mish my
Reputation, by wearing (...) rich a one about mine? The Title (...) Domicellus,
which with the Roman ^arons was so much in request, had not it its Etymology
from the Latin Word Dominus, which signifies Lord ^he Master. And mine of
Baroncellus, who will deny to be derived from the Word Baro, which intimates a
Prince with Lordship and Feudatories? Now ^f mine be more noble, and of better
Quality, why should I be despised and blamed when the other was so much
respected? My Person, in short, in these parts is as it were sacred, for every
the least Affront is offered me is punished unmercifully. Woe be to him that
dares, though never so mannerly, to oppose me in any thing; for (...) immediately
incurrs the severest displeasure of my Prince, and oftentimes has his Family
dispersed and his Estate confiscated. Be pleased therefore, Sir, to weigh these
my Justifications, which I must needs own do not seem to me so contemptible.
And if the access to the Temple of Honor be so steepy and slippery, let not me
be envied for having so luckily arrived. I don't make use of any farther
Arguments to p^swade you to a better Opinion of (...) Conduct, since I am
sufficiently ^tisfied I write to a Person who is b^^ Prudent and Honest. But
shall alway^ be very ambitious of being your Se^vant whilst I am, etc.

LETTER XIII. The Panther to the Tygre. Upon Preferment.
I shall always be ready to lay hol^ of every occasion of doing you Service;
and therefore shall never cease to prefer the fulfilling of your Desires to
any other private Interests: So that, in obedience to your Commands, I acquaint
you that I long since arrived in the Court of Phoenicia, in the Quality of his
Majesty's Painter with but an ordinary Salary; but since, by the faithful
Service of Ten years, there has ^een some reasonable appearance of its
^ncreasing, though I must confess 'twas ^ll built upon random hopes, the common
Food of Courtiers. I trusted upon a vain confidence of the first vacancy of
some good Office, being persuaded that the King's Generosity would not dispense
with as great Obligations. But in a short time I found my self not a little
disappointed; for his Majesty's Cup-bearer's Place being vacant, I ^aw it
immediately conferred upon one of his Grooms. You may imagine this was no small
trouble to me; nevertheless I was resolved to conceal it, and to dissemble,
though it might very well have caused no common effects of Anger to see so mean a
Fellow advanced over ones head. But because in Courts ^o discover ones thoughts
is often attended with no ordinary danger, I determined with my self my pencil
should express what my tongue dared not. And therefore having prepared a large
Cloth, I cunningly represented the ridiculous Action of Sultan Osman, who made
one of his Gardners Begler^^^ or Viceroy of Cyprus, for having se^^ him one
day plant a Carrot with Address. You cannot imagine, Sir, h^^ every thing
succeeded in this desig^ for the disposition of Figures, the proportion of
Limbs, and brightness (...) Colors, added to the truth of the History, my
Pencil being guided by the good Will I had to reprove so unworthy an Action.
The Picture being ^^nish'd, I took that time to expose it (...) when most of
the Grandees of the Kingdom were invited to Court to (...) solemn Banquet.
Various were the Opinions of the Guests upon this, amongst the rest of the
King's Rarities; but none more judiciously past their Judgments than two old
Courtiers, who with Lynce's Eyes searching into the Marrow of the History,
immediately published through the Court, It was designed to accuse his Sacred
Majesty of Imprudence, in bestowing Places of Credit and Honor on Persons of
mean Condition. This Opinion once spread, it was not long before it reached the
King's Ears, who was so grievously nettled, that he immediately ordered the
Picture to be burnt, and my Person to be as instantly seized; which undoubtedly
would have succeeded accordingly, had not my Prudence taught me to avoid but
the beginnings of so certain Danger, and my Legs as generously supported me in
a speedy flight out of the Kingdom. In short, I have learnt at my own costs
that every particular Passion is pernicious in the Management of any Affair,
and that it is safer to commend than blame, especially when one has any
ambitious end. Thus, Sir, I have given you all the account I am capable of; so
beg leave to subscribe, etc.

LETTER XIV. The Tygre's Answer. Upon the same.
I Consider in your so candid compliance the abundant Civility (...) your
heart, and which has alway^ been so charitably bestowed upon ev^ very occasion
upon one who has (...) little deserved it: I return you a thousand
Acknowledgments; and desire you (...) believe I suffer more by your
Misfortunes, than it is possible for you to (...) by my Impertinence, though I am
conscious I am troublesome enough. 'T^ an unalterable Law of this Age, the
Honors are oftener the Rewards o^ Vice than Virtue; and that Knave^ or Fools
are always preferred to great Offices by an undistinguishing Destiny. The Money
of Merit is not of any value or consideration in the Bank of the Court; for
there, an Enemy's Story shall always take place of the justest Truth. He that
does not grease an Exchequer-Officer's Fist well, shall either receive his
Money too soon or too late. We must not think our selves ever established at
Court; and we must endure even to be pist upon, if we have any aim to rise.
Flattery was heretofore a Vice, but now it is valued above the nicest Virtue:
For he that knows not how to flatter, must never think to make a good Courtier.
The Ears of great Men must never be offended with a relation of any bodies
Faults that in the least resemble their own. We ought not, for our own Safety,
to stir up a Lion that has our death in his Power. Approve of, and profit your
self by this Advice; and you will oblige one that has both an Heart and a Pen
always ready to serve you: So Subscribes, etc.

LETTER XV. The Dragon to the Badger. Upon Historians.
I Have received the History compil^ by your incomparable Pen, a^^ have perused
it with a great deal (...) wonder and delight; nevertheles^ must take liberty
to correct a se^ Particulars in some places, which in my Opinion would render
it a little t^ worthy of blame; for the free Censu^ of a Friend many times
contributio^ toward the Perfection of a Work, (...) should be unjust if out of
any respect to your Quality I should decline tha^ Duty. Wherefore treating you
with all manner of Freedom, I affirm tha^ in some Places you have made your
self too great a Stranger to the Truth, which ought to be so closely followed
by every Historian. I observe more over, that some Passages that deserve ^o be
rendered odious in the highest degree, have been so slightly handled by you,
that their Readers have been deprived of the Profit of such ill Examples.
Likewise you have fallen into extravagant Excesses in commendation of some raw
Captains, and described 'em so many Alexanders when they never saw their
Enemies Face, nor I Am confident had ever any experience in storming Towns or
attack^ng Parties. But that which offends ^e most of all, is the manner with
which you extol the trivial Actions of ^our own Prince; and with an odious
^artiality and grovelling Affection exalt ^s bare Successes, whilst you conceal
the braver Attempts of your Enemy, and which deserve to be consecrated even to
Immortality. History ought ^ot to be altered for the sake of Falsi^ies; and
Virtue ought always to take place of Vice, or it will lose its designed Effect.
Be pleased therefore to correct these Errors, or to remove my doubts by some
more pregnant Reasons; for I must always believe (...) sufficiently qualified
to defend (...) you write, though I take this Liberty (...) your Friend. Pardon
this, and belie^^ me yours, etc.

LETTER XVI. The Badger's Answer. Upon the same.
I Should not have dared to have ma^^ any reply to your Reflections (...)
unwilling to seem disenting from yo^ Authority, and to support my our weakness,
did not your generosity invite me to a Defense. I apply my se^ therefore to
remove those scruples that as a rigorous and nice Censurer disturb your Mind.
And I shall treat with you after the same Innocent Liberty as you have done
with me. You say i^ the first place I have made my sel^ too great a stranger to
the truth. Now, (...) at first seems to be a proposition (...) so great Force
that it might be ^ought rashness in me to presume to contradict it, but who
knows but with (...) few words I may change the face of ^he matter and make it
seem otherwise? I say then, that Truth is a La^y of that nice and honest Temper
that he will never be seen out of her Cham^er barefaced, but always covered
with a manyfold Veil to avoid the ^nares that are every where spread for ^er,
insomuch, that the bare token of ^er Arrival, is enough to put a whole Court
into confusion. If then she must needs walk circumspectly, and ^hinks her self
safer in obscurities than ^ght, why should I be so rigorously ^am'd if my
History so plentifully en^ch'd with the Actions of great Prin^es, chooses to
make her appear Maskt. ^elieve me, Sir, all things are lost which ^re not
Registered by History, and those ^any times boast Eternity; for Tempus ^stodes
sui habent. Next, for the Se^ond point you blame me because I handled Vices so
slightly. To which Answer; That Princes have such (...) Absolute sway even over
the great Pens, that they awe bold truths and (...) have nothing said of 'em,
but what^ grees with their humors: Therefo^ pray consider if they would be
will^ to lend their ears to the justest Repro^ of Imprudent, Tyrant, Covetous,
D^solute, or the like. Many that ha^ made use of these Truths, have the not
purchased the Contempts and O^um of their Princes, and by an un^pected
Metamorphosis seen their P^^ changed into Oars, and their Sh^^ to Sails, which
with the breath (...) their Masters displeasure have carry^ 'em away Slaves and
Wande^ through the World: These are t^ fruits of telling a Man his own. T^ ill
Characters are given of any one (...) easier answered with a Sword than (...)
Pen; you shall find few Historians (...) this Age, who do not rather choose
(...) a foundation, Non quid alii egerint, (...) quid optime actum fit. To
avoid the ^^nishments that those meet with who ^e their Arms longer than their
^^nsciences. Now for the Third Ob^ction, Of the undeserved Encomiums ^iven to
Captains, I hope to clear my (...), although Historia milites propter ^odem quae
mortuos sequitur prompti^es efficit ad pericula subeunda. Yet ^hy should not I
for the benefit of ^osterity raise even to the Stars the ^^me of our Warriers?
Tell me I be^eech you if the Chroniclers of Cyrus's Victories were present when
he ruined ^he Empire of the Medes, laid the ^oundation of the Persian Monarchy,
^^du'd the East, and Triumphed over Asia? If they saw Philip of Macedon
^stablish his Empire, Enlarge his Kingdom, and Enslave all Greece? It remains
only now, That I Answer to the ^mputations cast upon me, that I am too Partial
to my own Prince, and ^eglect to do others Justice: I Answer, that there are
few Writers, let 'em be ^ever so good that do not flatter that Person they
receive Favors from; and so permit me to conclude, That (...) have exactly
followed my Predeces^^ Rules I cannot be reasonably said ^err. These have been
all the Reas^ I have been able at present to coll^ in my Defense; be pleased
theref^ to consider of this my Answer, and you think it necessary oblige me wi^
a continued Reply, and you shall ha^ no occasion to complain of my Ing^titude,
whilst I acknowledge my (...) Yours.

LETTER XVII. The Wolf to the Porcupine. Upon Hypocrites.
BEcause you are an honest Fello^ and my very good Friend, I w^^ resolved not
to suffer you to be led (...) way with an Opinion that I was (...) the wrong,
to open a Shop of Mas^ in this City, where it is said the we^ring of 'em is a
capital Crime. But (...) must know that a certain Lord of (...) Merit and
Judgment has lately ^^sish'd this Law, and maintained (...) his Pen, that
Metamorphoses (...) Disguises are highly necessary in (...) Scene of this
World. This is the ^^y means to conceal a cunning Ser^nt, who perhaps has
ambitious ^houghts in his head. For with his countenance hid under the Mask of
a ^eming Liberty, this Lord Acted his ^art so extremely well in a certain
^ragedy, that though he was personally ^own to every body, yet his Designs ^ere
not unridled till he had changed ^s Condition, and appeared an abso^te Monarch
rather than a Servant, (...) he pretended. This Action has o^en'd every bodies
eyes, and advanced a ^^at esteem and reputation for the Art (...) Masquerading:
For though the Vulgar ^elieve a Mask only becomes a Mini^er of Justice; yet a
wise Man will ^^metimes conceal his own Person, and ^eep retired within the
Folds of an obscure Mantle the better to obtain (...) desired Ends. Also Nature
h^^ sometimes requires a Mask to c^^ her Deformities; and he that can (...) fit
it on, always obtains a suitable ^ward. My Returns in this Comm^dity are very
considerable and gainf^ but especially in some particular s^ of Masks which
have thin and thoughful Faces, for they are very nume^sly bought up, because
they man people seem wise and honest in (...) sight of the World, when they
(...) really Villains and lying Hypocri^ There Is nothing more remains, (...)
that I desire you always to comma^ me, and to oblige me with some A^count of
the different Transactions (...) the World; for my Curiosity that way (...)
sometimes so very extraordinary, the I often lose a Dinner to hear or read
Gazette. So, with hearty Wishes (...) your Welfare, I Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XVIII. The Porcupine's Answer. Upon News.
(...) Shall always rejoice for the Advantage you make of your Commo^ies; and
am glad that you are not ^^ect to that Punishment you men^^ed, since your
Miscarriage would (...) the greatest grief to me imaginable, ^d your Suffering
the greatest trou^le. I would willingly correspond ^ith your Commands in some
mea^^e; but because distant Affairs are ^any times corrupted by passing through
^any hands, I must desire you not ^o take it amiss, if you meet with any
^alsities or Errors, since other people's Accounts leave always some tincture
of the Nature that produces 'em.

To begin then, I acquaint you that the Affairs of the World are in such a
plight that they are never like to be reconciled, whilst every body make^ his
business to throw Dust in his N^^^bour's Eyes. The King of Epyr^^ so
desperately in love with a cer^ City in the middle of the Morea, the to be
Master of it He has lately ^tempted a violent Rape; but be^ disappointed by the
force or vigilan^ of the Inhabitants, he daily end^vours to corrupt them with
Go^ whilst his Attempts give so great (...) jealousy to the Borderers, that he
(...) more Eyes over him than the Bea^ful Io had heretofore. The Prince (...)
the Morea laughs heartily at his D^sign; and though he seems to stand wi^ his
hands to his Girdle, yet neverth^less he is always prepared to give (...) Vomit
to those that shall contract fl^^matick Humors by the Unreason^bleness of the
Weather, or the Fatig^ of their Journey: And is resolved (...) warm 'em well
with plentiful Salut^ that they may catch no Cold (...) Nights.

Captain Saiaverda has spent all the ^^^paign to recover his last
Winter-^^ters, and to get under the Walls ^f Culiacan, where he has been salu^d
with a general Curse for having ^d a mind to fill their Town with Spaniards, a
People of that turbulent ^^d troublesome temper, they thought (...) impossible
to please 'em: Whereup^n he was obliged to promise 'em they ^ould only have a
few Reigments of Sermans. But that frighted 'em worse ^an the other, for they
alleged they ^ad had a bad Vintage, and Wines ^ere scarce; and therefore could
not ^mply with his Proposals; so that in ^ort he was forced to retire without
^eing received, for fear of a farther hand of his Person or Reputation. ^his
Disobedience of theirs, has caused ^^m no small Enemies at Court, and ^^ey have
lately been in consultation that punishment to Inflict on such ^wcy Offenders.
But it is thought by ^he most capacious Heads, that their ^esolutions will
rather Pace than Gallop, and though the weather be very ca^ that they will put
but little Fuel (...) the Fire, because oftentimes from (...) small spark
proceeds a great con^^gration.

The King of Babylon, as it is sai^ has Assembled a Diet of his Nobles, (...)
put Cupping Glasses to their Sho^ders, or Leeches to their Necks, (...) keep
'em in health and prevent the being Lunatic, but it is doubted the^ will not
easily give their consents; (...) though the Wound be only cutane^^ yet it is
nevertheless very sensible. A^ so this Remedy is not approved sufficient to
divert the Paroxisms of a Fe^ that may reasonably be caused by (...) bad
disposition of Humors which (...) to be feared in that Body, and whi^ in time
may grow malignant and d^generate into perfect Madness.

The Lord D' Cottiniglio, who b^ Arms under the King of Catai, w^ lately
commanded home by his Mas^ Prester John, to employ him in (...) Supreme Command
of his own Troop (...) who was received accordingly with no common
Demonstrations of ^avour and Affection. Pursuant to which he Posted away in
great have to the Borders of the Kingdom, where the Army expected him: All the
way (...) was splendidly Received and Enter^ain'd, met in every Province by the
^^ilitia of the County, Saluted by the Cannon of every Fortress, and treated
with the Title of His Excellence wherever he came. But because the War his
Master made was altogether fomented and supported by Ambition, the same breath
that sent him Remanded him back again, so that in the middle of his Journey he
was deprived of his Charge, Title, Reward, and Favor, finding but too late
that Fortune seldom continues long constant. This Honorable accident gave
opportunity to the King of Trapezonda's Minister, to put him also out of Favor
at the Court of Catai, where he had always had the repute of a Prudent and Able
Soldier.

There is lately arrived from De^mark a whole Bugget full of New the most
considerable of which is That not long ago a Country-ma^ leading an Ass
through the Street richly clothed with fine Cloth, hap^ned to pass by some
Officers and Soldiers that were near, who being mightily offended that so vile
a Creature should arrogate to himself an honor to wear Scarlet, and which they
only thought due to themselves, were abo^^ to have sacrificed both the Asses t^
their displeasure; so strange a surpriz^ at first startled the poor Countryman
but at length being unwilling to expos^ his own Life, as well as that of his
beloved Companion for want of a few words, he raised his courage with a Bottle
by his side, and began to offer Reasons to incline 'em to mercy, but they would
hear none; when with Sword in hand being about to Execute their bloody purpose,
the courageous Ass, seeing the extremity he and his Brother were driven to,
began distinctly to articulate these Words. Gentlemen Soldiers, lay aside your
Scorn, ^ridle your Anger, and be not so cruel to one that has been your
Benefactor. Remember that you wear Scarlet by Means of my Labor. And if from
Beggars and Dunghill-rakers, you are raised to this Honor and Power, do not
abuse ^e and my Brother that have been the Cause of it. Remember that when
Drums and Trumpets sound no more, ^our gains will cease, and you may have ^eed
of either of us to save your Lives. Here the Ass ended, which he had no ^oner
done than their forward Blades were returned to their quiet Scabbards, for they
began to be sensible that it would have been a foolish action for them to shed
others blood to empty their own Veins.

Of the Affairs of Brazile and China, we have no account as yet, but expect
Letters in few Days, and then you shall be sure to have it; so hoping you will
be thoroughly satisfied with these my poor endeavors, I submit my self wholly
to your Censure, and (...) Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XIX. The Sheep to the Lamb. Upon Poetry.
YOu are ridiculous to ask me wh^ I have forsaken the pleasing Co^versation of
the Muses, and moreo^^ as if there were no other Poet to desire of me a Copy of
Verses to c^^^ you of the Head-ake, or to rid yo^ Brain of those Whimsies that
are the for the most part, the Product of Mela^choly; yet I would not have yo^
Despair if I don't comply with yo^ for if you will give but a little loose t^
your Purse-strings, you may easi^ find in the Booksellers Shops Rhim^ and
Poetry enough to last you re^ding all your Life time. The Co^ Pegasus who at
first had so great (...) Strangury of Urine, that every quantity was purchased
with its weight in Gold, to refrigerate their Lips become dry with much
Singing, now flows with so great a Stream, that every one lays up a copious
provision; and the Concourse of its Followers is even innumerable. For now it is
found that the smell only is enough to make a Poet, though before he were never
so much a Block-head. Whence it comes to pass that nowadays Poets do not meet
with so many Maecenas's, to furnish 'em wherewithal to purchase so precious a
Liquour. Let them that will therefore continue their Addresses to the Muses,
for my part I renounce 'em all, gratitude now seldom affording any other
recompense to a poor Poet, than a gracious Nod, or an affected empty
Complement, and sometimes even these are denied by a covetous Patron: Who, though
he may be liberal enough to support his Luxuries, yet to a poor learned
Threadbare Versifier will not afford a souse. I wish you better fortune than
you seem to Envy in me, and so Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XX. The Lamb's Answer. Upon the Mode.
IT Cannot be denied but that this Age is so very vicious and so overrun with
Avarice, that it would be no common stratagem to keep the Liberal and
Mechanical Arts longer upon their Legs, reduced almost to annihilation by the
greediness of those that for public benefit are obliged to support 'em. For my
part I have reason to Curse him a thousand times, that first learnt me the
Trade of a Barber; since I had no sooner obtained it, but there started up a
certain Lady called, Madam The Mode, so very Whimsical, Fantastical, and
Moveable, that she can scarce remain constant one Minute. Women naturally abhor
Old Men, because they have overliv'd their power of enjoying them: But this
Lady is so very much enamored on Gray Hairs, that she makes the veryest Youths
buy 'em after the price of Diamonds, and in despite of time will have young Men
white as Snow, though they be but very Boys. If I have not a great deal of
patience to polish these perfumed Civet-Cats, you may very well judge, and
particularly when I go about to adjust their Beards, because sometimes they
will have their Moustaches turned round in a curl, at another time like a point
of Interrogation. Oftentimes they must have 'em after the Turkish Mode, and
sometimes they shave 'em almost quite away, leaving only a little Hair on the
upper Lip, to distinguish their Mouths from their Buttocks. Now notwithstanding
all this fatigue and vexation, I must confess I should be well enough pleased
if these Ganymedes would but reward me well; but believe me, Sir, there are
some of 'em so very hide-bound, that they will scarce a^ford me bare thanks,
and others will ^^ly bid me God b'w'you, and promise (...) come and pay me
another time, whi^ they never mean it; and so leave (...) poor miserable
Cutbeard as famished (...) an Air-fed Poet. I shall trouble you wi^ no more,
Complaints and Compliments being alike tedious, but Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XXI. The Buck to the Goat. Upon Musicians.
I May well say I am escaped out o^ the very jaws of Death, for a lon^ and
painful Infirmity had almo^ brought me to my last gasp: Wherefore I hope, Sir,
you will not conclud^ my long silence proceeded from any want of Affection, but
rather pity my misfortunes which oftentimes oblige us to forget our selves as
well as our friends. At present, I thank Fate I find my self out of danger, but
nevertheless very weak: My Physicians have attributed the Cause of my
Indisposition to Melancholy, and therefore have advised me to keep up my
Spirits, and support Nature with cheerful Recreations and pleasant Pastimes for
fear of a Relapse, which they say would be worse than the first Disease: I have
therefore entertained into my service a Musician, who, to give him his due, has
very much enliv'ned my mind with Trills, Quavers, Pauses, and other Graces;
insomuch that I must really confess I never enjoyed so sweet a taste of Life
before. For he has made me truly sensible that Music, having its first origin
from Heaven, there is no Sadness which it cannot alleviate, nor Affliction
which it is not able to disperse. But if his Voice has been so great a relief
to me, his Impertinence has been no less grievous, for in a few Days he has not
only offended my Ears, but almost brought me to my Bed again; for changin^ his
Services into slights, his civiliti^ into bad Words, and the most regulated
Harmony into a Concertless confusion, he is become altogether intolerable: I
can provide no meat that can satisfy him, no drink that ca^ please him; and,
in a word, he is mo^^ scrupulous than a great bellied Woman, for he nauseates
and refuses every thing* His belly is his God, and therefore forsooth must be
stuffed with the Thr^sties of Lucullus, the Fish of Vedi^ Pollione, the Dinners
of Vitellius, and the Suppers of Caligula. If by chance I desire him to Sing,
to divert the disturbance of the Neighboring Prison, whilst I am not permitted
to take the Air, he shall presently excuse it and tell me he is hoarse, or he
has got a cold, or his Head aches, or what not. In short, he never cares for
Singing if I desire it, but if he sees me never so little intent upon any
business, then he shall be sure to Serenade me; and the more I desire him to
forbear, the more he shall insist to rattle in my Ears. I cannot express to
you, Sir, how troublesome, humoursome, capricious, and ^antastical this fellow
is, for he is more ^nconstant than the Sea, and more changeable than the Moon.
I think sometimes to rid me of his Tyranny, by discharging him; but then I must
^o it to his content, though to my own ^oss, that he may have no occasion to
^lander me with his Tongue; to have a Poet for ones Enemy is a great
misfortune, because with his Satyrs he may obscure my fame, but to be ha^ed by
a Musician is far worse, for he can express Invectives more lively with his
Voice, than the other with his Pen. With which I shall conclude not to ^rouble
you any farther with unman^^rly complaints, but kiss your Hands, and so
Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XXII. The Goat's Answer. Upon the same.
WHat enormous Crime have y^ committed, Sir, that should merit so severe a
Penance, as to h^ a Musician for your Table-fellow Mere good Nature obliges me
to co^dole you more for this Misfortune than the Misery you say has tormented
you so long. It Is true that M^sick ravishes the heart and elevates (...) mind;
but at this day it is practiced (...) such mean, proud and petulant Peop^^ that
it oftentimes has a quite cont^^ effect. These Coxcombs think (...) make their
Art better received by b^ing longer desired; and therefore a^ways take delight
to delay their perfo^mances with affected Complemen^ and lying Excuses, and a
thousand c^mical Shrugs and awkard Unwillingnesses, which would move even
Heraclitus himself to Laughter. But in my judgment such uncertain Artists
should be served as Themistocles was; who being asked to sing, and refusing it,
was very decently kicked out of the Company to make room for better humored
Men. And thence I suppose came the Saying amongst the Greeks, Aristophan. Vesp.
Ignosce ^^m Cythara ^^nere nescit.
when they would denote a Fool or a Madman, to call him a Man without Music.
But be it how it will, if ever you intend to ^ve a quiet Life, let that Fellow
be removed from you immediately. Else you may find your self as much embarass'd
as he was, who being almost deafned with the Contests of Two Musicians about
the pre-eminence of their Voices, was forced at length (because he would not
use 'em as Apollo did Marsia) to rise and run away, leaving them to the
confusion of their Obstinacy, and not able to support the defense of an
imaginary sound. Therefore I hope, Sir, you will not be le^ disposed to bear
with the Liberties (...) this Musician, than readier inclined (...) take oftener
occasions of commandi^^ me, whilst I heartily profess my se^ yours, etc.

LETTER XXIII. The Hiena to the Dog. Upon Detraction.
YOur Curiosity enclines you to (...) fantastical search, whilst yo^ endeavor
to know who was that (...) famous Pasquin, that with an unexpressible Applause
of his Railleries was s^ much reverenced by the World. Yo^ must know then he
was an excellent Tailor in Rome (although by some he i^ said to be an Host) who
in his prope^ Calling had no Equal, by name Master Pasquin, and who kept a
Salesman's Shop in the Parione. The frequent resort of people that made use
(...) him, obliged him to keep several ^urney-men that he might put the ^edier
dispatch to his undertakings; which fellows, though they were not ^le, yet prated
eternally, and spent ^ost of their time in finding fault ^ith the great Men of
Rome; inso^uch that I verily believe their words ^ere oftentimes more numerous
than ^^eir stitches. But these reproaches ^eing vented by mean Fellows, were
^ken but little notice of; for many ^mes instead of reprimands, they met ^ith a
reward from those they inten^d to expose. Afterward from these ^oys the custom
of Railing got a^ongst the Citizens, who made so ^od use of it as to bespatter
one ano^er considerably: At length this ^asquin died, but the Vein of Satyri^ng
did not end with him; for the ^^ople of Rome bearing some respect (...) his
Memory, erected the Stump of Statue where his House stood, and which Inherited
both his Name and Actions; for not discontinuing the C^stom to reflect on
Courtiers and ^lumniate great Men, they did the sa^^ thing by a Paper pasted
up, as the old ^^lows Botchers did before with the tongues: Whereupon every one
took ^berty to vent their disgusts by the be^ of this Person, who always having
i^ his Power to reproach and cond^^ whom he pleased; at length rendered himself
more famous than the celebrated C^tick Aretine. The Wit and Railery (...) this
Statue dispenses by another he^ is in great esteem; insomuch that (...) is
sometimes purchased at a great r^^ and sometimes also its Authors m^ with the
severest punishments: But t^^ which is most to be wondered at, (...) that
having no Feet it runs all over (...) World, and no Hands nor Arms, (...) it
embraces all. This is what I h^ been able to gather concerning (...) Person and
Employment of Man Pasquin, so that I hope it is suffici^^^ to Answer your
commands, which (...) always be observed to his power, t^ desires to Subscribe,
etc.

LETTER XXIV. The Dog's Answer. Upon the Same.
I Have been often made sensible of your good will toward me upon several
occasions, and particularly by this ^ort History of Master Pasquin, which (...)
heartily thank you for, and do as^ure you I shall never be able to forget (...)
Person that is so frequently obli^ing. This Taylor's good fortune ^as certainly
sufficient to have made Alexander envy him more than he ^id the Glories of
Achilles, to recommend his name to Eternity, by means of a Statue; and to have
such ^n Homer as you to write his History and Virtues. But Achilles did not
at^ain this Honor without Magnani^ous labor and heroic Deeds, when our
Tailor was at no trouble or expense. I fancy the design of the People of Rome
in building this Statue was ^o reclaim more by his biting Railleries, than Cato
should by his severe Ce^sures. But we find it had not (...) effect, for
Raillery is now grown (...) common with the World, that it (...) seldom taken
in earnest. Satyr an^ Pasquinates have now adays the sam^ influence upon
Mankind, as my b^^ king has over the Moon. If sm^^ Sayings, biting Sentences,
and poi^nant Words could have any effect upon bad People, it would be necessar^
for every City to have a School (...) learn 'em in.

It was the Opinion of some Politicians that it is almost expedient for the
happyness of a civil body to murm^ sometimes against their Prince, for Subjects
sooner discharge the Veno^ of their Indignation by speaking freely than acting
traitorously. Nevertheles^ this liberty of talking ought to b^ moderate, and
not malapert and i^pudent: If Pasquin could but conte^ himself to be a harmless
Universal Physician, and to cure People of their de^fects modestly, he might
reasonably deserve every bodies good word, but ^se unbridled inclinations of
his to and Peoples Reputations, and to make ^n ridiculous, can deserve no
better ^me than Rashness, Impudence, and ^lly. And at last he may happen (...)
vent something that may cause his ^grace and downfall, as it has fre^ently been
experienced by other such ^^litious Wits in the like Cases; I be^ve it would be
no small advantage to ^^squin's friends, if he had these words ^^graven in his
base, Emenda and hic (...) ibi vir esto. That is, You that have (...) mind to
show the sharpness of your ^it and Judgment, consider well first (...) what you
do, and when you come hi^er, be sure to have your Eyes about (...), to observe
if there be any Spies near ^t might see you fix your Satyrs; ^herwise you may
incur the danger of ^h an Attempt. Now to conclude: ^ose matters that relate to
Princes, ^o' they may be safely observed, yet ^^ey cannot be uttered so; and I
should ^ther approve of that remedy the Senate made use of to reclaim Calig^
than Pasquinates and Libels. Th^^ have taken the liberty to enlarge upon your
Subject, not to instruct but to e^tertain my self, and discharge my O^ligations
to you which you have o^^ laid upon me to write, though I (...) blush to think I
have attempted t^ copying of your thoughts, so S^^scribe, etc.

LETTER XXV. The Camelion to the wild Boar. Upon Courtiers.
WIthout doubt, Sir, your goo^ness pleases it self with (...) many unmerited
Favors you do (...) yet the oftener I reflect upon your kin^nesses, the greater
is my Sense of the Obligations. I heartily thank you (...) your Congratulation
of the Hono^ lately done me by his Majesty, an^ (...) wish I could return you
the like ^^nstrations: In a few days I shall forward to Court, where because I
an absolute stranger, and being told (...) to please his Prince a Courtier
(...) dissemble and flatter, I have ad^^d with some Friends, very skilful in
^se matters, what course to take to ^id errors. And one amongst other ^ngs has
sent me a certain Powder ^de of an herb called Fortune, which himself (being an
accomplished Cour^r) has many times experienced a^^inst the venomous wounds of
Envy, ^^d which will prove the like Antid^te (...) any body else; providing it
be so^rly and temperately made use of: ^r envious people do not employ ^^eir
Malice against our Persons, but ^e excesses of Fortune that we enjoy.

Also my Lord Duke Rhinoceros, a ^ming Courtier, and my very good ^^iend,
writes to me to provide my ^f plentifully of some certain yellow ^ills, to be
procured of the Bankers; without which he says I should pass my time but ill at
Court, being a^^^lutely necessary to purge away Mel^choly, caused by the
Avarice and gratitude of great Men. He has (...) obliged me with a copious
account (...) the Art of a Courtier, wherein I f^ one Chapter with this Title
Silenti^ servato: Now I confess to you, Sir, (...) incapacity in not being able
to fath^^ the depth of this Mystery, for it se^ to me that a Courtier ought to
be ^^ry well provided with words to Am^ and Baffle those poor wretches, when
indiscretion obliges 'em to attend c^^tinually without ever being able have
Access to their Prince, and w^ is always kept ignorant of the truth every
thing: Now if silence be t^^ way to dissolve Friendship, why is prescribed to
be so exactly practiced Court? Perhaps because Friendsh^ and the Court being
two incompatib^ things, it were better for a Court^ to have no Friends at all,
than to ha^ 'em false. I humbly beg therefore y^ would be pleased to unriddle
this Eni^^ (...), that I may with the better securi^^ proceed with my Journey,
and I ^ll always acknowledge my self in^^^itely obliged, and an eternal Admi^er
of your Learning and Truth, etc.

LETTER XXVI. The wild Boar's Answer. Upon the Same.
THe gentile Pen of my Lord Duke Rhinoceros, has so livelily ex^ess'd my
Sentiments, that I could not ^ish you better than to speak little at ^ourt: For
so it is, Sir, that a Court^ ought to be sometimes Mute, as (...) well as
loquacious. Loquacity be^g a loose superfluity of words vented without any
thought, so that though this ^cious Quality be never so essential to ^^e Person;
yet, (if he will be a Cour^er and not a Fool) he ought to ^^deavour at least to
appear Wise, by speaking little, which is certainly the property of a wise Man,
when talking much is undoubtedly that of a En^ Though silence (I grant you) being
(...) unadvisedly dissolves the links (...) Friendship, yet handled with
discre^ on always joins 'em the closer: For he that maliciously conceals a
prais^ due to a Friend, is a promoter of Envy and Detraction, whilst he that
exalt^ another virtuous Actions knits an i^dissoluble knot of Gratitude which
time it self can scarce dissolve. Silenc^ was heretofore painted full of Eye
and Ears, but without a Mouth, (...) show us, as I believe, that we ough^ to
speak never, or seldom; or if w^ must needs talk, that our words b^ first very
well weighed and considere^ of before we transmit 'em to o^ Tongue, for always
a great Talker (...) the sign of a Fool, when if he had be^ able to have held
his Tongue, he mig^^ have passed for both Learned a^ Wise. Silence is always
required by Prince in his Courtiers, and Secre^ i^ the surest step into his
Favor, whilst much talking is an unavoidable Omen of his Ruin. Consider Sir,
the Instability of these preferments, and you will agree with me that my Lord
Duke has counseled you more like a Friend than a Courtier, receive therefore
this first occasion of declaring my Friendship, and believe me very Ambitious
of living in your good Opinion, and which will always be the humble desire of,
etc.

LETTER XXVII. The Unicorn to the Elk. Upon Idleness.
THe necessity which now obliges me a fresh to have recourse to our Candor and
Goodness, one way (...) very dear to me, because I know that those Virtues with
which your ^lind is so plentifully enriched, are the more perfect by being the
oftener employed: But on the other hand, I am very unwilling to be so frequently
troublesome to a person whose great Affairs, one would think, might privilege
him from Addresses of this nature. It will then be the effect of your natural
inclinations to bear with me, and the result of an unwearied goodness to
forgive and comfort me; I must therefore desire you to understand that my
Secretary (who in the Fatigue of business and the exercise of Politic and
Civil Functions, has not his fellow) is lately to mine and his own Misfortune
seized with a stubborn distemper in his hands, which has rendered him
absolutely unfit for writing* So that it has put my utmost Invention upon the
Rack, to contrive some remedy that I may not be deprived o^ so learned and
useful a Servant, but all in vain; the Physicians after many fruitless
Consultations scarce know what to do next, but nevertheless for the last Remedy
have advised me to your Excellencies Nails, supposing it to be the Cramp. In
pity therefore to this poor Wretch, but much more to those whose livelyhoods
depend upon his Cure, I humbly supplicate your Excellency to favor me with a
few scrapings, and I dare promise he shall always live sensible of the highest
Notions of Gratitude and Obligation: And for my own part I shall always study
to Indulge the least Motive of service, and which will be daily due to your
Merit and my own Inclinations, so humbly Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XXVIII. The Elk's Answer. Upon the Same.
MY good will is always so ready to comply with your desires, that I esteem it
no ordinary good Fortune when you are pleased to command me, and accordingly
have endeavored to obey you by the enclosed quantity of scrapings of my Nails,
which I could wish might have that fancied effect you are pleased to honor 'em
with, for that ingenious Gentleman's sake who has so deplorable an occasion;
and for whose welfare I am the more concerned, because it is correspondent to
your satisfaction. Permit me nevertheless to signify my Opinion a little upon
this Distemper; it is true that Nature has bestowed upon you an Horn inestimable
for the Power it has of o'ercoming Malignities and the mortal Qualities of
Poison, and to me she has been over-prodigal of her favors (if I may believe
the Doctors) in impregnating my Nails with a Virtue of driving away the Cramp.
But Art, who has always been known to excel Nature, has invented many ill
humors, whose pestiferous Quality my Horn has not been able to Master, and
that sort of Cramp that contracts great Men's clutches; I believe yours would do
no good upon; our skilful Surgeons are always ^ent to load their hands well
with ^ron or any other heavy Metal, who ^re troubled with this Distemper,
because with the continued weight the ^ttracted Nerves might be extended, and
recover their first Motion. I should therefore mightily commend their Policy,
if you could persuade ^our People to weigh down your Se^^etary's hand well with
Gold, whose ^eight and Virtue is certainly effica^^ous enough to resolve all
Attractions ^f the Nerves, which might hinder (...) hand to dispatch their
business: (...) pleased to accept this Counsel in good part, and believe it
altogether ^uggested to my Pen by the ardent de^^re I have to serve you, whilst
I confirm my self Yours, etc.

LETTER XXIX. The Ape to the Fox. Upon Favorites.
I Should think my self very unworthy of the excellent Character of being your
Servant, if I should pretermit any the least occasion of expressing the
Obligations of but common Gratitude toward your Merit and Favors: I find my
self therefore engaged to give you an account of my Travels, would you be
pleased then to know that I have traversed many Kingdoms and States with very
various Fortune, for in some Places I was received and caressed by every body;
and as if they had seen a delightful Prodigy of Nature, they surrounded and
courted me on all sides with wonder and joy: In others (J^lt Fortune showing me
her backside) as if I had been the vilest and most villanious Creature upon
Earth, with public Hissings, and Hootings, and showers of Stones and
Brickbats, I was forced to leave the place to avoid being the Pastime of
Children, and the Sport and Mockery of the brazen-faced Mob. So that at length
being resolved, or rather forced, to put an end to my Pilgrimage, I was
inclined to settle my self in some place where I might get my Bread, with as
little sweat of my Brows as possible, and therefore immediately determined to
go to the Court of Morocco, and where I now am. Scarce had I been three days in
this Court, but I was made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber: Upon which I vow at
first I thought I could have touched Heaven with my finger; but Fortune that
knows not how to degenerate from the rest of her Sex, made me quickly sensible
of her Inconstancy, for I found I must Exercise the Trade of a Barber, together
with that of a Courtier; The covetousness of the Princes of this Country,
having taught 'em to receive none into their Court that is not qualified for
many Employments. Now my being defective (...) this, was the Cause that one day
against my will being a Shaving (...) Majesty, I unfortunately cut out a piece
of his Chin; upon which you may imagine he was in no small fury, for rising in
a rage he darted an Arro^ at me like lightning, which happily had not its
effect; and he seeing it, was going to draw his Scimeter, and undoubtedly had
done my business had I not nimbly escaped so certain a danger. For this error
you may be sure I was obliged to keep from Court, and had many times thoughts
of leaving the Kingdom; but his Majesty's Birthday approaching, I had a fancy
came into my head wherewith I thought it was possible to regain his Favor.

The universal Joy that this day occasioned, was to be seen in every Face, and
no Voice was heard that did not favor of Pleasure and Delight. But that which
influenced the Applauses ^ost was a stately Ball kept in the ^^ng's Palace: So
great was the Con^ourse to this Meeting, that without ^^^bt there would have
been confusi^n and mischief, had not the vigilan^y of the Supervisors prevented
any: The Ball was free for every body like (...) Gentleman to dance at, with
this distinction only, that Noblemen and ^nights might he without Masks: (...)
taking courage under this Cloud, crowded through the thickest of 'em, dressed
like a Scaramouch, and presented my self in the midst of the great Hall; where
with four profound Con^^e's, and as many Aerie Capers I awakened the Ladies
curiosity of knowing who I was; whereupon one of the ^riskest among 'em rising
from her Seat, and making me a low Courtesy; askd me if I would dance a
Bergamasea. Upon this you may imagine my senses were not asleep or feet numbed;
For I immediately took her by the hand and fortunately performed all the
variations of Art and Nature, and some o^ 'em were so very extravagant that
they caused no ordinary laughter in the Standers by: The Dance being ended, his
Majesty with a smiling Countenance asked the Lady who I was; who with a blush
that almost flamed in her face, and trembling Accents discovered her Ignorance
in these words: If your Sacred Majesty does not command him to unmask himself,
he must always be unknown for me, the Mask is a deceit of Art, which as well
conceals beauties as blots. But be has given such graceful proofs of his
Abilities that 'twere pity they should be lessened by these obscurities: His
Majesty perceiving by this that she had a mind to know me, and being willing to
oblige her immediately with a majestic Nod, commanded me to unmask; whereupon
with a Jump that almost reached the Ceiling, and which ended at his Majesty's
feet with three profound Reverences I fell on my knees, and discovering my
Face, humbly begged pardon for my former Crime and present boldness in presuming
to my self so great ^n honor as to Dance in his Presence. His Majesty laughed
heartily at the sight of me, and for my punishment made me one of the chiefest
Men about him; this is the Series of my present good Fortune, which the
Courtiers envying me for, do daily endeavor my disgrace; I have re^ourse
therefore to your singular saga^ity and prudence, and do beg you would be
pleased to suggest some inge^ious and cunning Advice to disable these snares of
my Enemies, with whose confusion I am certain to advance my self higher in
Dignities and Honor. Prepare your self therefore with never so many Commands,
for they shall all be punctually obeyed by him that knows not how to forget a
greater number of Obligations: But always will be glad to Subscribe himself
Yours, etc.

LETTER XXX. The Fox's Answer. Upon Ambition.
I Rejoice with you, Sir, that after (...) many dangerous Storms raised by the
winds of Emulation, you have at length regained the Port of your Master the
King of Morocco's favor. He that has wit enough to appease hi^ angry Prince,
may well be counted wise for those Deities for the most part are scarce
appeased without a Sacrifice even of the Innocent: The Anger of a great Man is
like Lightning and Thunder that consumes to Ashes before you hear the noise:
But now blessed be Heaven that has delivered you from such danger: Let it be
your business therefore for the future to take care not to Act the part of a
Sovereign, whilst you are but a Subject, for it is their Trade to flaw, so that
those that are not brought up to it very often spoil the skin, as you see you
did when you cut off a piece of your Lord's Chin. I have reflected upon your
good luck at the Ball, and am amazed at it since I have known others of as much
skill have endangered their ^^cks, by dancing at Court; it is very difficult I
assure you to move without errors to the tune of Ambition and Imulation. The
Dance of a Courtier is a Figure that often ends in its own Ruin, for if the
beauty of it consists in Leaps; yet they must all come to the ground, so that a
Courtier 's greatness is supported only by a conceived height which has always
a certain f^ll. Leave off I beseech ye this Art of Dancing whilst you are at
Court, for it is but an Emblem of your future Misfortune, and to know one's Fate
before hand sure is not welcome to any body.

The use of a Mask for a Courtier I don't approve of, because it very often
begets bad effects: But yet I don't say I would not have you make use of it for
that would be rashness in me, an^ you might have just cause to complai^ of my
friendship if I should pretend to deprive you of the chiefest part o^ his
Composition. For he would no^ be able to conceal his Malice, Hatred, Envy, and
abundant Ill Will without it. Accept of this whils^ I endeavor to approve my
self Yours, etc.

LETTER XXXI. The Dog to the Horse. Upon Ingratitude.
TIme that wastes and consumes all the Works of Art and Nature, has at length
deprived me of the use of my Teeth, which were Arms that did not use to fail
me; also this my declining condition that one would think should deserve soft
bits and nourishing Broths to support the small remains ^f my Life, meets with
nothing else (...) musty crusts and dry bones, so very bare that they serve
rather to fa^^ish than feed me. You know, Sir, ^ow very faithfully I Have served
my Ma^er in the Chase, whilst I were able; and all my Competitors will confess
^ow I always out-did 'em in the ca^eer: But now the Beasts may walk ^he Forests
free from the Injuries of ^^y Teeth. I say nothing of my spi^its spent, of my
meeting at every foot ^ith Bushes and Briers that made me ^art, for my so
nimbly rushing through ^m, and of my Limbs covered with blood by the sharpness
of their Thorns. ^lso I forget the frequent exposing of ^y Life in contests
with the sturdy ^oar, and other wild Beasts: And a thou^^nd other hazards I
under-went for his ^leasure and profit; the Memory of which good services I
must own would ^e a comfort to me in my old Age, ^id not his Ingratitude add to
my ^ffliction; when I do but reflect upon his muchings, strokings, kind words*
and other good turns done t^ my Youth, I can scarce abstain from tears. Poor
Melampo, say I often sighing, thus are thy Labors rewarded (...) The money
that should be expended for thy recompense, is only coined upon thy back with a
tough Cudg^^ But I must conclude, for my wou^^ bleed a fresh at the bare
relation of (...) much Cruelty, and joined with the Anguish of my Hunger may
hast^ my Death. Have pity then, dear (...) on this my deplorable condition, a^
forgive the trouble that these my complaints create you; since I ca^^^ think
'em better bestowed than in (...) Treasury of my Friends bosom. S^ wishing
Heaven may deliver you from such thoughtless and mercyless M^sters, I
Subscribe, etc.

LETTER. XXXII. The Horse's Answer. Upon the Same.
YOu have so often experienced the Test of my Friendship, that you (...) be
easily persuaded of my con^ for your Misfortune, and if a and be styled another
self, you may ^^tisfied I am equally tormented; (...) can receive no comfort
but by (...) of your consolation and con^ Comfort your self therefore, (...)
with the remembrance that many (...) old at Court, and yet meet with (...)
^eward: Oh how many would be (...) of a bit of bread, that have worn ^t their
Years in Service of their ^ng and Country! Consider, Sir, that ^axim which
says, That nothing plea^ without Fruit. He that proposes (...) himself present
profit, can never ^e leisure to think of services past, and do you think he
would purcha^ Inability at the price of his darlin^ Gold. No, no; if you have
in yo^ Youth been able to serve him, never let his Ingratitude trouble you no^
you are old; but suffer Hunger wit^ patience, and consider his hard usag^ as
the effect of an indiscreet and me^ Soul, and I shall always be ready wit^ my
poor Ability to support that Li^ I have esteemed so dear. Besides Dea^ you know
is not the end of Life if (...) may believe the Philosophers Transm^gration:
Also it is a very remarkab^ proof of good service when a Serva^dies in his
Master's house, dispose yo^ self therefore to quiet with these Re^sons, and
believe me when I profess (...) heartily love and pity you, so Su^scribe, etc.

LETTER XXXIII. The Stag to the Wolf. Upon Imprudence.
WIth no common Sentiments of compunction have I lately ^d an account of the
Favors you ^ceiv'd from the Ass, and I must ^eds confess he dealt very much
like (...) Ass by you; yet I cannot forbear ^ing your Imprudence with a severe
proof, for that you being brought up (...) the Art of a Butcher, must needs
(...) take upon you the Profession of a ^geon, by plucking the Thorn out of ^s
Foot, which if you had left in, ^e would never have been able to have one you
any harm. You see now if ^ou had kept to your Profession, you ^ould not have
incurred that danger which your rashness has brought you ^to: Content your self
therefore for ^e future to be confined to the limits of your own Nature, and
since y^ have showed your self so good a S^geon for another, pray try if you
(...) cure your own Nose, and if any s^ remain let it serve for a warning (...)
you to take care of such ill-bred As^ who have neither merit nor discreti^^ and
of which I Will assure you the Wo^^ at present has not a small numb^^ Accept this
Advice from one the wishes you well, and so Subscribes, (...)

LETTER XXXIV. The Wolf's Answer. Upon the same.
I Thank you heartily for your goo^ will, and I approve of your Advice; yet
cannot think I deser^^ your so severe Reproofs of Imprudenc^ when endeavoring
to do another Good, he like a Brute returned m^ Evil. But Experience will
defend (...) for the future against such Accidents, ^^d no body is so wise but
that he may ^^m: Nevertheless, there is no doubt ^^t that he that becomes wise
by ano^^^rs harm is to be commended, but my Misfortunes have been such, that ^y
own must be my Mistress, and that ^^titude is not always the companion (...)
Benefits, how have I been so much (...) blame? Perhaps in giving too much
credit to the feigned tears of an Ass, that was not sensible of the ^indness I
did him, and not having before experienced that the Memory of a ^enefit lasts
just so long as the time ^as passing away it was received (...). I shall take
care for the future to ^ake the best use of your Advice, that I may be no more
exposed to this ^^prav'd custom of the Age, and which Resolution to confirm, I
Sub^cribe, etc.

LETTER XXXV. The Viper to the Tortoise. A General Satyr.
I Dispatch this present Letter with a^^ expedition to your hands, earnestly to
beg the honor of your Advic^ in a matter of doubt, and which see^ to me to
require no ordinary exac^ness in its solution. A Cobbler has i^ treated me to
recommend to the Clerks of this Circuit a certain S^^ of his, which he has
Commenced wit^ a Tanner, for selling him Sole-leath^^ of a Buffalo, for that of
an O^^ with a great deal of damage to the Buyer, and discredit to his Shop an^
Trade; for having made a pair (...) Slippers of it for a certain Pedagogu^ they
immediately participated of the Nature of the Beast, and inclined hi^ to be led
by the Nose by his Scholars with a great contempt of his magisterial Authority:
I desire you therefore ^o advise me how to prosecute this ^ause to my Client's
advantage, and ^y own gain; and that speedily, for (...) were pity the poor Man
should suf^^r by delay.

The News at Court is, That Don ^edro de Tendiglia has lately had a ^^^at
Contest with Don Menrichez di ^illandro, about the Nobility of their ^^ths;
each pretending an Honor ^d Esteem above the other: Inso^^ch that the Court is
at present in a ^^eat Commotion, and no body knows ^t which way the Balance
will en^^e: Nevertheless, there was a fresh ^ort yesterday that Don Ladron
^^guiga had made 'em friends and ^^ke hands together, endeavoring (...)
persuade 'em that poor Noble Men ^ght not to go to Court to be ho^ur'd and
respected, but to stay at ^^me with their honest Tenants, who ^ould prove
better Judges of their ^^e Merit and Quality.

The Parliament have now accomplished an Act that Notaries shall not have so
large a liberty of using etc's, under rigorous penalties and deprivation of
their Power of acting for the future. But Signiore Cola de Renzo in favor of
the many dull and ignorant of that Profession, has obtained a moderate
construction of that Act, so that now those that know not how to draw up a
writing complete may supply as they did before their defects with an etc.

Some few days ago a wonderful Prodigy was heard in the Air, which cried out
frightfully three times Ra^venat^, words that gave occasion (...) doubt whether
they related to Hu^ting wild Beasts in the Woods, or Me^ Purses in the Hall. If
any other ne^ occurs, you may promise your self faithful and speedy Account
from Yours, etc.

LETTER XXXVI. The Tortoise's Answer. Upon Presents.
YOur Cause I cannot presume to direct you in, nevertheless I thought it but
convenient to write, because we should never refuse an Answer (...) one that
had taken the pains to ob^^ge us with a Letter out of pure good manners If
there were no other Motive, for to great Men we must an^wer out of duty, to our
Equals out of ^ood manners, and to our Inferiors ^ut of good Nature, I say out
of good Nature; which may be meant to our^elves, for the Vulgar being always
desi^ous of communication with the Gen^ry, every the least line they receive
from them does not render 'em more obliged than liberal: Be pleased but to make
Experience of this truth, and you will find that Presents frequently come from
Inferiors; seldom from Equals, but never from Superiors. If one of the
meanest, even of the Mobb, do but receive a Letter from a Gentleman full of
lying expressions of civilities and inclinations to do him service, and such
like empty Compliments; he shall immediately make it his diligent study how to
be grateful to one whose words proceeded rather from a design upon him than any
sincerity of heart. This is my opinion, and if you please you may follow it;
but however, receive it in good part from him that wishes you well, and so
Subscribes, etc.

LETTER XXXVII. The Lizard to the Scorpion. Upon Fairs.
THe time of the rich and splendid Fair of Cambalu drawing near, I have
determined with my self to make one amongst 'em, and accordingly have prepared
no ordinary rarities; but amongst the rest I design to build a Booth in the
New-street, where with variety of Inventions, and a Company of Stage Players
that have been used to bubble and amuse the people, I do not question but to
get a considerable penny. For I am resolved to trouble my head no more with
drawing rotten Teeth, or introducing new ones where the old were not very
grateful: Neither will I concern my self at changing Cards in other peoples
hands, nor putting tricks upon any one, because this deceit is grown so very
trivial, that he must be a very Blockhead that knows not how to practice it. I
must confess this putting tricks upon people has been heretofore very gainful
to me, but now who does not understand Legerdemain? Juglers and Merry-Andrews
only pretended to it for many Ages past, but now Statesmen and Politicians
invade their Prorogatives publishing it for an unalterable Maxim, that those
only are fit to Manage great Affairs, that have cunning and dexterity enough to
sell Gloe-worms for Lanthorns. Also I intend to carry along with me a pair of
Nine-holes to entertain the Canaglia, and which will certainly be applauded for
not only the weakest, but the wisest of those people have been sometimes proud
to excel at this Game. Lastly, I shall distribute for the public good an
Electuary made of Tortoise, which I don't doubt will be very welcome to all such
as want radical moisture; and who have wasted their Substance, and become
Hectic, by taking more care of other peoples business than their own. Also
because this should be the better received, I have determined to present the
Buyers with a considerable quantity of perfumed Pastills to corroborate the
Stomach, and to make the breath sweet, after an unmannerly belch of stinking
Sentences, which must needs be very Nauseous to the delicate Nostrils of Mr.
Romance-writer, Son of Mr. Spoil-paper; both great Admirers of fresh B^tter and
Cream-Cheese. These will be the chiefest part of my Vendibles, and which will
be so much the more advantageous, if I can have the honor to sell you any
there, where I shall earnestly expect you, whilst I Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XXXVIII. The Scorpion's Answer. Upon Eunuchs.
YOu invite me to Cambalu, Metropolis of Catai, and I will come, but it will be
more to correspond with your Commands, than moved by the entreaties of some
inhumane Fathers; who being extremely in love with their Sons Voices, have
invited me thither to Geld 'em; to the end that they may the shriller accuse
their Cruelties, whilst to satisfy the folly of their Inclinations they expose
their tender Infants to the greatest dangers, with the depriving of 'em of
those Movables that ought rather to be increased, than diminished. It would
therefore be very commendable in some good Prince to publish an Edict in favor
of Generation, and such Boys as were heretofore so unmercifully handled,
because they were In deliciis Romanorum, Prohibiting with the severest
penalties so great acts of Cruelty, which are nevertheless continued for Sport
and Pastime. So confirming my self yours to my Power, (...) Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XXXIX. The Elephant to the Stellion. Upon Governors.
I Give you hearty thanks for the honor done me by the safe delivery of my
Letters, and I am extremely ^oncern'd for my ill fortune that yours should go
amiss; Nevertheless I hope you will not think it caused by ^y Negligence, but
attribute it to ^tality that attends some affairs. The Administration of
public Em^loyments serves for a Touchstone to Essay the capacity of the
undertaker, so that when that is found sufficient to digest the great diversity
of Affairs one meets with in Government, to Command is no less delightful to
Ambition, than gainful and necessary for the Experience and Knowledge of
things. For I may freely confess to my friend, that this Employment has not a
little advantaged my understanding; for I have box'd the Law about with a great
many Ministers, and always triumphed, because I was above 'em in Order. I have
also introduced public Audience every day, by which I have ended many stale
Suits with a great deal of satisfaction to the Parties, and for farthe^ content
of the People, I am always ready at hand to dispatch their business. And
because Bonum ex integr^ causa, malum vero ex singulis difficultatibus, over
and above my calmness in giving Jugdment, my patience in hearing all is
extraordinary; though Justice in appearance ought to seem as much rigorous as it
ought to be really mild in the distribution: My punishments of Offenders are
but few, but those sudden and exemplary, which is a Rul^ that I have always
found successful* As to the rest, my City is great, in differently Populous,
commodiously Rich, and of a delightful and fertile Soil. And because that a
good Governor ought to shear gently, and not to flaw, I have contented my self
with the profit of an hundred Crowns a Month. My people like all others, have
their defects, as there is little flesh to be found without bones; I endeavor
to show my self reasonable in word and deed to every body; but still I am
resolved to be obeyed and feared as Superior: So, Sir, concludes one that will
be always proud of your Commands, whilst he is, etc.

LETTER XL. The Stellion's Answer. Upon the same, etc.
YOur good Nature always finds Inclinations to oblige me, and I thank Fate I
have a Conscience always ready to acknowledge it. And whilst I am
congratulating your safe Arrival in that City, I am rejoicing for your happy
ingress into your Government, and this chiefly because it has so advantaged
your Understanding, for many Ministers nowadays, of the li^^ Employments,
retain much of the Nature of a Turnip, which by its long staying in the Earth
grows the grosser; so these exercising themselves in the most difficult Affairs
of State, instead of being more subtle and acute in their Intellects, grow
insensibly duller and more blockish every day. You have done prudently in
defending the Power of your Jurisdiction; for that being the tender'st part of
Government, to keep it from Insults is the surest way to establish it. I would
advise you therefore to be vigilant and diligent in the maintaining and
increasing it, and to oppose the least occasion of contending with you for Jus
Minuitur gliscente potentia, And not to be like those coxcombs who, out of a
desire to be thought accomplished Courtiers, suffer themselves to be deprived
of their Authority, which is the only support of their Honor and Interest.

I also admire the Excellence of your ^^t in composing the stalest Dissen^^ns
and most aged Controversies. ^or Law being a Chain that also binds and engages
the Heirs, it is not so ^asily loosened and discharged. And (...) the most part
these disorders pro^cted from the Ignorance of the Judges; who though they are
willing to ^^d a Suit, yet conjure up an hundred more by their Incapacities,
and ^ant of necessary Qualifications. How many daily strut about in Gowns that
they may be thought great Lawyers, when for the most part they are ignorant of
the very Elements? How many modern Judges are there, who for want of sufficient
Knowledge, act mi^rably at random? But let us leave these Asses with their
gilded Trappings, and come to your shearing and not flawing your People. I must
confess I am extremely edified by your Modesty in this case where you are
content with little; but I would not have you over-proud of it, For the Love of
Money always increases. Believe me, Sir, Diogenes and Stilp^, had they but once
experienced the delights of our Modern Ministers, I mean that Auri sacram
famem, the first would never have refused the Offers of Alexander, or the last
the Treasures of Ptolemy; for by that cursed force of Self-interest they would
have found themselves plucked and removed from such generous Principles. I do
not mean that I would have you govern tyrannically; but to imitate the
Footsteps of wise Princes, that you may neither be counted a Coward nor a Fool.
Be also liberal of your Person, and not like those Rulers that make their
Subjects wait whole Years without admitting 'em to their Presence; and when
they do, refusing all that come empty-handed and meanly attired; for that does
but beget an Hatred that is many times indomitable. Observe moreover for the
future all Instructions given by your Superiors, and from the prodigiousness
of your Natural Gifts Learn to seign and please them, and thereby to establish
to your self an indelible Memory with Posterity, whilst I am sufficiently happy
in promoting your good Fortune; and so subscribe.

LETTER XLI. The Hedgehog to the Coney. Upon Critics.
WE live in an Age, Sir, where every body will be a Critic, and where Moats in
others Eyes are more observed than the Beams in our own. One can neither speak,
nor write, but there is presently one of these commentators by to make his
remarks: And although Nature has been so provident as to arm me with prickles, yet
is it not sufficient Defense against these Mastiffs who will venture to fix
upon me in spite of Wounds. I cannot but wonder every Minute at these Apes; who
not being able to distinguish Silepsis from Synecdoche; yet will attempt to
seem wiser than others: Insomuch, that I swear to you my hands have a thousand
times Itch'd to be scourging 'em with Invectives, and lashing 'em with Satyrs,
and I had done it, but I considered their trifling Opinions did not deserve so
honorable a punishment; and I was rather inclined to let 'em alone in their
Folly, than to wast the least Ink in their correction, for they turn over Books
more to blow the dust off from their own Shoulders, than to learn any good out
of 'em. And so because that where a Vice is grown so habitual, all care to
remove it may be esteemed vain and fruitless, I stop my Pen, and wishing you
all happiness, conclude my self, etc.

LETTER XLII. The Coney's Answer. Upon the same.
YOu have a great deal of reason to complain of those that have offended you,
but who can put a stop (...) the torrent of ill Tongues? Such ^owd together
daily to our Printing House, where with their shallow heads they pretend to
examine the Light of the Sun, and I cannot but laugh hear^y to see 'em snarle
and carp at every ^^ng goes by 'em. For to some, an ^^thors Work seems too
wordy, when (...) others it appears too concise. Some complain that his Subject
is obsolete, Others that his Oratory wants Rules; ^^e observes his Style is not
sublime enough, and ten that his Language is not good enough. A great many
abhor all that can be said of humane Sciences, and for the most part condemn
every thing that was not first communicated to their Approbations. Such are not
wanting as will damn an Author for Proud and Arrogant, where others do believe
him humble and trivial. In short the different Censure^ of these people are
oftentimes more than the Books contain Words or Syllables that they rail
against; Innumerable is the Gang of such pretenders who shall value themselves
more for a^ little empty Criticism, than the mos^ celebrated Authors that ever
writ, have deserved Fame. Truly their unhappiness that write now adays, is
considerably great, for every Cobbler almos^ will pretend to judge of it: Bu^ to
what purpose is it to be discourag'^ or vexed, since they are not able to giv^ a
true Judgment (which is only to b^ valued) of what they read. Pardon me, Sir,
if I write with any passion since I were unwilling to have these rash Censurers
deprive my Press of the honor of your learned Compositions: Whilst I shall
always be ready (...) acknowledge my self Infinitely ob^'d, and Yours, etc.

LETTER XLIII. The Adder to the Hare. Upon Vpstarts.
TRuly, Sir, you were very much in the right when you guest that I should have
said to me by the ^w Secretary of State, for scarce ^ere I entered his doors,
but I per^v'd he had a mind to belie his Birth, (...) he seemed more Proud and
Arro^nt than Hanibal after the Victory (...) Cannoe; and as if he could not
con^escend to speak with any body with^t an Interpreter. A great folly is ^is
in almost all Creatures, that seeing themselves raised to Dignity and Pow^,
they presently believe they are ^ansform'd to Deities, and would fain ^im
Adoration; Whilst they do not consider that Silk which is the greate^
Composition of their Grandeur, is only wrought by vile and abject Wor^ from
their own Guts. After a gre^ deal of waiting I was at last introduc^ and
permitted to flatter him in (...) turn after this manner. That among the
universal crowd of his Servan^ and Admirers, I thought my self oblig^ to offer
a particular Testimony of (...) gladness and joy to see an Employme^ so very
considerable, so worthily Co^fer'd upon a Person that might boast himself a
faithful Servant to his Prince. (...) moreover entreated him to accept the mean
Devotion, but which altogeth^ proceeded from a mind and body Infinit^ly obliged
to the Greatness of his Fam^ly and Person. And lastly, I explain my self,
better by declaring the pleasu^ I had in finding his numerous and h^roick
Labors so gratefully rewarde^ But notwithstanding all this, my Rh^torical
Congratulations being but i^ received, I concluded that Ambition was an
Infirmity from which these (...) ^^ppy Wretches who were raised from ^unghill,
can never be freed: For ^th half a look that scarce demon^ted his Inclinations
to speak to (...), and a ridiculous Spanish starch'd^, he answered, that he
thanked me (...) my Congratulations of the Ho^rs done him by the favor of his
^^ce: But that he was not very well ^as'd that I did not treat him with (...)
Title of Most Illustrious, that be^g now adays bestowed upon Inferi^ Quality,
and therefore might ^sonably be allowed to him. His En^siasm upon this occasion
was so ^at, that it was something of kin (...) downright Madness, for he
protested ^me with a great deal of earnestness ^t he was resolved to be
accosted by (...) meaner Title, though it should cost ^n a Million of Crowns; and
there^e bid me beware how I behaved my (...) toward one of his Quality for the
^ure. Upon which harsh Commands ^und my self in a great deal of dis^er, having
to do with so great a Man, and who I feared might hastil^ offer me some
unreasonable outrage* so that wisely having recourse to goo^ words in all
humble manner, I apply'^ my self to appease him: I began t^ make my excuses in
an extraordinary Form, and ended with the like uncommon Submission, so that at
last I gained so much upon him as to show me hi^ backside. The extravagance of
these Merchants of Titles is so very great that I believe they would be willing
t^ translate themselves into the Catalogu^ of the Deities, and might be easily
brought to desire a Statue the better to express their insatiable Pride and
Ambition. For the future I am resolved not to be wanting in windy Titles to
blow up these Footballs of Fortune that I may no more expose my self to such
dangers; but endeavor to satisfy their Pride at full, since it is no common
hazard to have a mind to wade through the Streams of Ambition against the
Current of their Will^ Be pleased to accept of my humble ^blations in this
Narrative, whilst I ^^bscribe, etc.

LETTER XLIIII. The Hare's Answer. Upon the same.
I Have read your Letter with a great deal of Admiration, and have not ^een
able to abstain from an excess of ^^rth in hearing the ridiculous
extra^agancies of the Ambitious Secretary. ^or discoursing one day with an
inti^ate friend of mine upon the Actions ^f these perfumed civit Cats, and
ex^lling their arrogance, he broke out ^f a sudden into an immoderate fit of
^^ughter, whereupon being prompted ^y so great a Miracle as to see an
He^eclitus so merry, he being a melan^holy Man, I inquired the more cu^ously
into the Cause; whereupon he ^pply'd, that he was always subject to so strange
an alteration whenever he reflected upon any of that Stamp tha^ were used to
play High and Low. Thi^ new Proverb awakn'd in me a farthe^ inclination to dive
deeper into the matter; Whereupon he was pleas'^ to add, these Fellows play
High when they boast themselves descended from the greatest Monarchs of the
World or perhaps from those Heroes that ow'^ their Protection to the wooden
Horse Priding themselves in their shining Habits, or numerous troop of
Followers, or sometimes Raving, disdain company, because they imagine amongst
their Equals there is none able to Vie^ with 'em, or because they hate those
they think may Eclipse their borrowed Virtues with their real Light. But on the
other side they sometimes do'nt stand upon playing Low, when they can submit to
break a Jest with the veriest Mobb, or Converse with the vilest Buffoons, to
whom they shall freely communicate all their thoughts and Interests. And
moreover to show (...) preposterousness of these Animals (...) ^hey have never
so rich and new (...) ^it, they shall wear only a greasy (...) hang-ear'd Hat,
and trail along ^r'em a pair of cobbl'd rusty Shoes; (...) I would have you
take that for ^nted, you will never see 'em with ei^^r a good Peruke or
Stockings: In ^^rt they do every thing in extremes, (...) are always in the
wrong. Be ^as'd therefore to survey that tool of ^^rs in all his Actions, and
you will a^^e with me there may be such a ^eature as I describe; for these
Cox^^bs like the Cat, though they be ^nsform'd into a beautiful Lady, (...) still
be running after Mice when ^^y might be better employed. We ^^^not hope for a
change of Nature, ^m that of Habit; good Actions ordinations if they are not
brought ^th us into the World or imbibed in (...) Cradle, are never sincere,
for they (...) neither be bought with Money, nor ^^^chas'd by Honors; for though
it be ^arrant Maxim Quod honores mutant Mores; yet it is always to be
understood for the worse, and Dignitie^ and Honors overcloud the sight,
insomuch that these dignified people for the most part forget their Friends,
Benefactors, Parents, and commonly themselves. Moderation in the enjoyment of
any purchased Honor, is rather the effect of an accidental Reason than any
Innate real Being. The proportioning my duty always t^ your Commands, I
Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XLV. The Kid to the Hee-Goat. Upon Travel.
WIth the same awful Respect the a dutyful Son ought to a^proach his Reverend
Father, do I ta^ my Pen in hand to pay you the Trib^ of my humble
Acknowledgments; a^ to acquaint you that with the gene^^ ^plause of the whole
University, I ^^ve at length attained the Degree of ^octor. I persuade my self
there^e that you will not be less glad of ^e Honor has been done me, than ^^ll
pleased that I have not so unprofi^^ly spent my time and squandered ^ay my
substance, as other Scholars ^ve done before me; so that now ha^ing performed
all that can be required (...) a dutiful Child, I once more tres^ass upon your
unlimited Bounty for a ^vour I have hopes you will not please ^o deny. And that
is my Genius in^lining me naturally to Travel, and ^ing like to have the good
and virtu^s Company of some of my Fellow-^^udents, who are to resolved to run
through the greatest part of Europe, (...) was Ambitious to beg your blessing
and leave to go along with 'em, for the ^dvantage of their Conversation adds ^e
greater impulse to my desires: ^ould you be pleased therefore to grant (...)
your consent, and convenient Ne^essaries for so long a Voyage. And let it not
seem hard to you, Sir, to (...) at this extraordinary Expense, for that is not
wholly thrown away that contributes the least Improvement to our Minds.
Consider, Sir, that standing Waters soonest corrupt, and that he who has not
seen any other Walls but those of his own Country, either rusts in Ease, or
rots in Vice. I for my part think them Fools that having it in their Power to
see the Magnificencies of Cities, to view the Strength of their Situations, to
Survey the vastness of Kingdoms, the populousness of Provinces, the rapacity of
Rivers, the profundity of Seas, the steepiness of the Appennine Mountains, with
whatever else the World contains of Pleasure o^ Wonder; should all the day sit
poring on a triffling Map, and finding only a Point for the greatest Cities,
and the breadth of a Barley Corn for the largest Empires, pretending moreover
with a limited Compass to measure the immensity of this vast World; which to
make the least of it is a Globe, and ^refore I suppose esteemed by them (...)
no more consideration than a Cy^er. How many of these Blockheads ^^aring the
Island of Crete named, do ^^sently imagine it a piece of Clay to ^^ke Pots
with, because in Italian (...) is Creta. And reading at any time (...) the
Canaries, do believe 'em a par^^l of Wenches dancing the Canaries: therefore to
prevent my being like ^ne of these, I once more beg leave to ^^inforce my
former Petition to grant ^^e this Innocent satisfaction which in (...) self
contains nothing but an inclina^^on to acquire virtuous Actions, and which are
always best learnt from o^^er Men's manners: So humbly Sub^^ribe, etc.

LETTER. XLVI. The Hee-Goat's Answer. Upon the same.
YOur Letter gives me a great deal of comfort, whilst you acquaint me that you
have made an honorable use of your Studies; which though they have been no
ordinary charge to me, yet I Am resolved not to deprive you of the virtuous
Recreation you desire. You will therefore herewithall receive sufficient
necessaries for your Voyage; but I must first sorewarn you (being an Italian)
of the too frequent use of those three R's, which in one of our Courts is so
nicely and rigorously practiced. The first, which is Ridere, to ridicule, snear
or grin at any body, or to use Artifices to deceive, is not prudent to practice
amongst Foreign Nations; for they being of a more candid, sincere, and serious
Temper, mightily abhor ^^ch liberties, dissimulation, or deceit. (...) to the
Second Rodere, to detract, (...) rail against, which is commonly in ^se with
those that see others Advanced ^ver their heads to Dignity and Ho^our, for few
regard another greatness without Envy or Ill Will; there^^re if we are
naturally subject to such (...) principles, it were best to conceal (...) as
much as we can, for he must ^^metimes be content with bitter Entertainment,
that has a mind ever to ^dvance his Fortune. Lastly, Radere, ^o oppress, or
molest, in an universal Odium; for he that Esteems his Liberty cannot well
endure the Yoke of a ^ordid and cruel Slavery. And you will and in Traveling
that many Nations are now become Free-States by the Tyranny and Oppression of
their Governors, that otherwise would have been contented with an ordinary or
tolerable Vassallage. You must necessarily converse with different tempers,
therefore would do well to conform yours as variously: But I should be too
prolix to pretend to instruct you in all the Finesses you must practice to
avoid disgusts. Therefore shall only advise you these two; that whenever your
Baggage is visited by Searchers, be sure to have patience with 'em and bear
their Impertinencies as easily as you can, for they knowing no other Equity
than common Pilsering and Griping will be sure to have the Court and Law on
their side. But above all, take care of the precarious Ceremony of the Court;
for there you will find Ambition and Avarice have the disposal of every thing.
The blessing of Heaven smile upon your Undertakings, whilst I am able to do no
more than to pray for your prosperity, and so Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XLVII. The Bull to the Buffalo. Upon Impotence.
Am very much solicited by some Friends to Marry, and my Age tells I must not
be long about it, if I ^end to have any comfort or plea^ in my Wife, for a
decrepid old ^^sband is seldom very welcome to a ^^ng buxome Married Woman;
^^erefore I have recourse to your good^ for Advice in this difficult and
^^gerous Affair, which admits of no ^eration after the Holy Words are
^^nounc'd. There are a great many ^ung Creatures offered me, and a^^ngst the
rest an Heiser considerably ^^ch in Fortune, but more abundantly ^ovided of
Friends, and I am told ^at the multiplicity of these will be ^^y necessary to
defend me against (...) Calumnies of ill people, which now seeing me single,
never cease to persecute wherever they are able. But nevertheless I would not
willingly go from one extreme to another, leaving a free State for a servile,
and therefore direct my Sails to you as a safe Pilot to conduct me into an
Harbor you have so often experienced, and got so advantageously clear of the
Rocks and Sands, of Rivals and Ill-humours. I shall impatiently attend this
Honor you will do me, and which will be so much the more obliging as it is
accompanied with your Commands: So Subscribe, etc.

LETTER XLVIII. The Buffaloe's Answer. Upon Marriage.
SO weighty an obligation as your gentle persuasive Letter has laid upon me, I
must yield my self altoge^^^r unable to sustain, for how can I thought
sufficient to advise another (...) a thing I have been so much wan^g in to my
self? You say you are ^^cited by some friends to Marry, ^^erefore who ought to
contradict it? and you argue very strongly for it; ^erefore who dares not be
convinced; (...) I should diswade you from Marry^^g, it would be a depriving
you of ^he many benefits, especially Money, that attend it. And if I should
advise you to it, how many Curses and Im^ecations would you shower on my ^ead
for the accidental misery I might bring you into? In this perplexed Dilemma I
know not which side to choose. Nevertheless, to show you my Love and Friendship
can conquer all other considerations, I Will do my best to comply with your
desires. When you can no longer refuse putting your feet into the Fetters, be
sure to make use of no Match-maker, but consult only your own Inclinations, for
women are not like Clothes to be put off and on when you please: Neither would
I have you wait too long, least your Hairs grow gray, for the dew of Love is
always rendered insipid by mixing with the Frost of old Age. Your choice of the
Heiser does not displease me, and the rather because you will run no risque to be
pointed at as others are, for She by ancient Heritage wearing the largest
Horns, you will have no reason to fear you shall be enrolled amongst those
Coxcombs who believe the Honor of their Families wholly placed between their
Wives legs, to be disposed of, and managed at their discretion. But
nevertheless, I do not like her being so Rich, for Men that Marry such Women
many times bring into their Families an insupportable Mistress: Also Parents
should not be reckoned amongst the number of Friends, for they are commonly no
longer pleased with the Match than they can benefit by it. And believe me, Sir,
if the various vicissitudes of Affairs in this World, should require you to ask
their As^^^tance, you would find they should (...) the first that would rather
contri^e toward your Ruin. These are (...) the Race of those people who pro^^e
a great deal but give nothing, ^d who in time of Calamities and Mis^tunes never
know you. They are ^e Whores who caress their Cullies so ^ng as they have any
Guineas left, ^t despise and spit at 'em when they (...) gone. These are my
thoughts upon this matter, which I humbly offer (...) your Consideration,
whilst I Sub^^ribe, etc.

LETTER XLIX. The Wolf to the Otter. Upon Monopolizing.
I Esteem Hunting one of the most Noble and Virtuous Recreations that can be
admitted into a civil Soci^ty, for it is as it were a School where the Art of
War is learnt. Do but observe, Sir, how Ambushes are every where set to take
the Beast at a nonplus, and fresh Dogs always kept in reserve to hinder him
taking the Water. Now see him Eathed, and almost as speedily forced out again
by the barking of Dogs, and cries, and beating of the ground by the Huntsmen;
scarce is he out of his Borough, but he finds himself surrounded with a
numerous Troop of his Enemies all ready to devour him, which he being as
sensible of, immediately puts the wings of swiftness upon his feet, and commits
his Life and Liberty to a speedy flight, but at length being overtaken by the
swifter Dogs, he is obliged to cast himself into a round, where on all sides he
skirmishes with the close Assaults of his Adversaries. But at length finding a
little disorder in their Charges, he takes his opportunity and nimbly rushes
through 'em, when in full career beating along the Plain he is suddenly stopped
and forced to turn, when ^^dging to and fro, and making short ^^d irregular
fetches, he politickly a^ids the greedy attempts of his Pur^ers. Sometimes he
squats under a ^rong Hedge, and there hides himself, and sometimes he feigns
the courage of a Champion, and seems not to be ^fraid nor cares for quiting his
Post, ^nless he is beat out of it: In truth in this Exercise one does both
Battle and Encamp, and the Conquest is always ^o much the welcomer as it has
been won with more toil and labor. This Pastime has been heretofore my darling
practice; but now as we use to say, I have hung up my Arms in the Temple of
Peace, not because my Vigor failed me, for I am yet as well provided as ever,
but because the Governor of this City has published a rigorous Edict,
forbidding with severest threats, all Persons of whatever Quality Estate or
Condition, to Hunt or Kill any wild Beast with Dogs, Nets, or otherwise; being
resolved to reserve those Pleasures and Recreations wholly to himself. Thus you
may see Sir, to what degree the Ambition of governing oftentimes extends it
self, and how it will subvert even the Laws to humor its own caprices. The
wild Beasts that freely walk the Forests, do not naturally wear the Livery of
any Owner, but such as can make 'em so; therefore why should not any body be at
liberty to make themselves Masters of 'em. If Jus gentium be inviolable in the
persons of Ambassadors, and which oftentimes causes Wars to maintain; why
should it not be the like in Hunting, which has the same Authority for its
protection? Those must needs be very Tyrants that pretend to prescribe Laws to
the Forests; heretofore there have been Theaters erected, where people might
Exercise themselves with wild Beasts, but sure not with intent to betray those
to punishments that should so eminently expose their lives: I believe by this
time I have fully satisfied your curiosity; therefore shall only beg you would
be ^^s'd to comply with mine, in sen^ some of the freshest News at ^urt, which
has happened upon ac^nt of Titles or Precedence; and ^'ll infinitely oblige, etc.

LETTER L. The Otter's Answer. Upon Titles.
(...) Know that Fame has been very careful to publish the Dissentions that we
happened lately between two Courti^, and I cannot believe but that she ^de use of
her swiftest Wings in the ^osecution. The rumor indeed has ^en great, nay, so
very extraordina^y, that if the King's Authority had ^t interposed to appease
the Tumult, ^ey would certainly have gone from ^ords to blows. The story is
this, ^me few days since his Majesty was ^as'd to Conferr the Title of Marquess
on Signior Rangifero, without giving him either Lands or Jurisdiction, but
which he was nevertheless forced to purchase with some Gold. This Dignity
instead of placing him in an advantageous Post, and augmenting his Fortune, has
obliged him to a great many superfluous expenses far above his ability; and in
short, rather contributed toward his Ruin, than Advancement. Nevertheless he
was always envious of the seeming good Fortune of Signior Conte Elidro, and
bore him mortal hatred, but whilst h^ was his Inferior he was forced to
dissemble: But afterward being rais'^ to this eminent Dignity, he though^ he
might very justly claim Precedence, and also the Title of most Illustrious:
Whereupon meeting the Coun^ one day in the Antichamber, he se^ his hands to
his side, and taking the Wall proudly strutted by him, which the Count
observing, in a great rag^ was going to strike him, but remembering where he
was, he declined that intent, and contented himself only ^th giving him a fill
up, and whispe^g a Challenge into his Ear, telling ^n afterward aloud, That he
could (...) deserve to precede him, or to be ^ited with the Title of Most
Illustri^^, that should boast his Honor not ^im his own Merit, but the sordid
^^lifications of his pocket; and that ^^ght or hereditary virtues ought (...)
to take place of active and inhe^nt. This contention caused great ^sturbance in
the Court, and the ^ng was immediately acquainted with ^^eir Proceedings; who
as speedily ^s'd 'em both to be Arrested, con^ng 'em within the Walls of his
Pa^^e, under threats of the severest ^oofs of his Displeasure if they diso^y'd;
and moreover to the end that ^ch inconvenient practices might be ^err'd for the
future, he commanded (...) Attorney General to make a strict ^quiry into the
matter, and to pro^unce as rigorous Judgment upon the ^ffender as the Case
would bear. Both Parties wearied more than (...) Pen of the Prime Advocates of
the Universities to support and maintai^ their Reasons. This affair was deb^ted
several days, and every body wa^ in earnest expectation of his Decision when
the Attorney General pronounced that the Title of Most Illustrious became only
such Marquesses (...) had Estates to maintain it, and therefore did not belong
to such as ha^ none: Also that it was a mere foll^ for them that enjoyed such
Titles a^ Honorem tantum, to covet to be saluted after that manner, when the^
scarce deserved that of Illustrious; Also such Dignities end with their Live^
for their Sons soon lose 'em if they Inherit nothing, and that to be abus (...)
with bare Titles, is no more than t^ be a King at Chess or Cards, who a^ only
dignified for other Peoples a^vantage. Also he would not allow such Marquesses
to have any other T^tle but that most trivial one of S^^ Thus ended this
Titular Trial, but (...) without satisfying every body, that (...) that buys
Preferment is not to be ^^par'd with him that gets it by his ^n Merit. Receive
this short Narra^e in part of that mighty debt, that ^mits the greatest part of
my life to (...) obedience of your Commands, ^ilst I Subscribe, etc.

LETTER LI. The Bear to the Red-Deer. Upon Heraldry.
(...) Acknowledge the Genealogical (...) Carte you were pleased to send me,
(...) be the Work of an ingenious Pen; ^d that the Author of it deserves a ^eat
deal of commendation, whilst from ^^e Stem he makes so many Branches ^urish.
But if I may have leave to ^ve my opinion against those that ^^st their Descent
from Monarchs, ^^d who make a specious pretense to a Pedigree which they
delineate according to their own vain fancies, I could tell you that there is
need of other means to prove their Quality Ab immemorabili, than musty
Privileges (...) or old Epitaphs. Therefore because (...) good Coat of Arms may
be found upon an ancient Tombstone, must i^ needs follow that all those that
may be buried under it, must of consequence have descended from one of that
Race (...) Also because there may possibly come into the hands of an ordinary
fellow an old Worm-eaten Parchment, wherein mention might be made of the Fabii,
Metelli and Africani: Must i^ hence undeniably follow that he was descended
from these Heroes? Also may it be allowed sufficient to Ennoble a Family what
an Historian relates perhaps from the suggestion of one that has a mind to
appear in Print (...) Then because corruptions of Ages have permitted every
Commoner to bear his Helmet; must it be granted that they were all Soldiers or
Generals, or descended from any such? Also be^^use now every one has a Mantle
to (...) Coat of Arms; must they needs ^^ve their Origin from Dukes, Mar^esses,
or Counts? And lastly, be^^use sometimes a Titular coxcomb ^ay bear the Kings
Crown; must he ^eeds be of the Royal Family? No, ^o, these are but the follies
of Ambition. Believe me, Sir, in matters of Ge^ealogy, we have no surer
Evidence of our Origin than from the Earth, out of which we were formed; and
which being made up of so many A^omes, it is no wonder if it should produce the
like in us. Nature herself in the circumvolution of Years, turns all things
topsie turvy; therefore consider, Sir, if these Professors of Genealogy can be
reasonably allowed to know the true Origin of Families? Oh how many are there
now who ^re poor and beggarly, yet had Ance^^ors that were great Men! And on
^he other side, how many that now ^^t on Thrones, and Courts of Justice, who
were descended from some of the vilest of Mankind? The clearest among the
Planets is not free from spots; amidst the brightest part of it splendour, there
may be observed some shades. But that which concerns m^ most of all is, that
Gold should have the power to purchase Honor, when Birth and Merit are taken
no notic^ of. So with humble demonstrations of Love and Friendship, I
Subscribe, etc.

LETTER LII. The Red-Deer's Answer. Upon Orthography.
YOu have discoursed very prudently upon those that have a mind to Illustrate
their Families by Genealogies, and I have observed that our Author having a
mind to imitate the modish way of writing, has all along adorned his discourse
with Similitudes, Metaphors, Allegories, Hyperbole's, and such like
Embellishments. And because the Italian Tongue has been ^ery much reformed, for
if Bembo ^ere now living, who was heretofore ^he Ornament of our Language; he
would be no more esteemed of than a ^allad-singer, if he did not alter his
^hrase, and skill; therefore our Ge^ealogist has made use of a manner of
writing so very bestial and foreign; that it is enough to put one's whole
^abrick into disorder. But pretermit^ing this vocabular extravagance, I shall
say something of the correction of the Alphabet. At this day there ^s more
strife amongst our Professors of Orthography for the letter H, than Caesar had
heretofore for the Roman ^mpire. For woe be to him that shall ^ow dare to write
Huomo, Hora, Hono^e, etc. for he would be presently o^er-run with laughter, and
the Title ^f Ass would be the best compliment should be bestowed upon him; but
how depraved are our Ears, whils^ they are not able to distinguish a graceful
sound, which H always gives to the word, when without it, it is both languid
and dull. But because one erro^ brings in another; I shall observe that it is
much worse where a T is refused for a Z; these Cripplemakers not perceiving
that in the Italian Tongue it is much sweeter and stronger to say Oratione,
Affectione, than Orazione Affezzione. Where it is plain that Z renders the
pronounciation harsh and difficult, and changes the Tuscan Tongue into Doctor
Gratian. The communication of foreign Languages with the Tuscan, has rather
corrupted than enriched it, as many believe, introducing a greater Esteem for
the Letter Z, which is the Symbol o^ Death; than for the Letter T which
presages Life. But I should have enough to do, if I should go about to call in
question the Modern Orthography any farther; for I should never be able to
effect any thing more, but to procure my self the Universal Odium of the
Learned. Therefore I end my Letter, not being willing to be enrolled amongst
those that write Apologies, Subscribing, Yours, etc.

LETTER LIII. The Ape to the Monkey. Upon Curtezans.
THe Soldier and Curtezan, in my opinion are so very like, that it would be
accompanied with impossibility to venture to decide which Profession ought most
to be avoided. The Curtezan vends her Beauty, and Merchandises, the gifts of
Heaven and Nature, with the vilest Usury. For he that is poor, must not think
to be admitted into her Conversation, whose heart is always Mercenary: The
Soldier submits his Life and Liberty for a few pence and a little painful Pay.
If this is wanting, he either licenciously Mutinies, or runs a Rebel to those
places where he thinks Rewards and Stipends are more frequent and just. Hope is
the Soul that gives Motion to both these Bodies. One is not better disposed to
Assaults, Battles, or Slaughter of Enemies, than through hopes o^ a Reward,
with promises of the Sacking some besieged City, or Plundering a routed Army.
The other, allured by rich Presents, and betrayed by golden offers, what
hazards will she not undergo, to ruin no less her hated Riva^ than beloved
Gallant; for she has ever more regard to her own Interest than either the Life
or Estate of her dear Narcissus. The Soldier's more cruel than the fiercest
wild Beast, and as much a stranger to Pity as Faith; a^ loose lascivious
Woman's perfidy is clear, her Deceit apparent, her Cruelty manifest, and her
Reasons plain. She is never at rest till she is revenged of a Friend that
advises her against Pollutions she gets by; but yet she seems to differ from
the Soldier in this, that her Practice being to promote the delights of the
Senses, she cannot well be said to act with force or violence. Nevertheless,
considering the World has long since bestowed on Soldiers the glorious Epithets
of Great and Magnanimous, and on the contrary on Whores, those of Vile and
Infamous I conclude, that a Soldier ought to be more esteemed of in a civil
Commonwealth, than a loose and idle Curtezan. Thus much I have been able to
write, to obey, not contend, with your sublimer Genius; and I would humbly
entreat your singular goodness, not to refuse your Answer to the enclosed
Question I have sent you, whereby you may acquire perpetual Fame; whilst I,
confessing my self all along an Admirer of your wondrous Abilities, conclude,
Yours obliged without power to make any tolerable return, but which will
nevertheless be always the earnest endeavor of, etc.

LETTER LIVE. The Monkey's Answer. Upon Politics.
I Would willingly comply with your desires, to answer the enclosed; but being
to discourse of Political Affairs, which require so acute a Judgment to
conceive the occult reasons of the Statists, I know not whether I shall be able
to write any thing to the purpose, it being rather a supernatural than ordinary
Undertaking to establish sound and unalterable Maxims of Government, for their
great variety of circumstances incline 'em the more to mutability. But since
you have obliged me to it, I must obey and tell you that in my opinion the ruin
of Republics arrises either from Wars, or a greater Force; such as
Earthquakes, Whirlpools, Fire, Thunder, Inundations, Plagues, or the like. If
therefore a Republic should find it self exposed to any one of these sad
Accidents, and the miserable Citizens consequently forced to choose new Members;
you require of me whether their number ought barely to be equal to the old;
though there should not be enough to act in the several Courts of Justice, or
other public Stations; or whether they have power to augment themselves to a
number necessary for the Defense of their Lives, Laws, and Liberties? For
answer therefore I say, that Rulers being to have no other end in their
Actions, than Justice, and the public safety of their Subjects, they ought not
to take greater care of themselves: For dominion over others was not invented,
that he who was possessed of it should only have regard to his own Honor or
Interest, but the safety and defense of his People.

Plutarch gave this definition of a Republic, Respublica est quoddam Corpus
compaginatum ex membris, quod Divini muneris beneficio animatur, summae
Aequitatis nutu agitur and quodam lumine rationis regitur. So that if in a
natural Body, there be but one only Soul, that reigns in a Republic: Suppose
there be one Supreme Authority, which nevertheless may admit many Members; how
can this Supreme Authority operate for common Benefit, if it be deprived of any
of its parts? An House forsaken by its Inhabiters, quickly falls to ruin; a
Ship deprived of its Pilot is soon lost.

Now, Lastly, if the number of the new Citizens ought to be greater or lesser
than the old; I say, that having regard to the public necessity of
Administering Justice, they ought to be suitable to the occasion: But to prevent
the many disorders that may happen through Emulation or Contention, which often
have pernicious consequences: I should think it more consonant to public Good,
that the numbers of 'em should be equal, whilst it is not to be doubted, but
that will keep an union in their minds, beget mutual Affection, nourish Peace,
and is indeed, the very Soul which maintains and preserves a civil Body. Accept
of these my hearty Endeavors, and believe me always proud to acknowledge my
self Yours, etc.

LETTER LV. The Musk-Cat to the Linx. Upon Dogmatists.
FOlly sown and scattered through the World, busies most Men living, and
extends its tyrannical Scepter over an infinite number of People, who are
continually pecking and abusing one another; so that if I had a mind to
discourse fully on all the Follies, that some have said, and others have done,
I might grow more Volumnious than Atlas would be able to support with his
Shoulders. Nveretheless, you having desired to know which is the greatest Folly
in the World, I shall endeavor to comply with your Commands, though I am unable
to Act my own wishes. I affirm then that the greatest of all Follies is not
Boasting a descent from the Trojan Horse; nor desparing of ever being able to
accomplish one's desires: But in endeavoring to make Coxcombs sensible of
their Errors, when they obstinately believe themselves always to be in the
right, and this I have found true by Experience when I have thought fit to
convince a Person of his Bigottry or a Physician of his Ignorance. It remains
only now that I desire to know (as I have several times done) why you, that
have so excellent Printers in your Province, should seek to have your Works
printed elsewhere? Pardon and approve of my well meaning, whilst I rest, etc.

LETTER LVI. The Linx's Answer. Upon Licencers.
THe daily complaints of those that raise their Reputations by the Press, ought
to be a Rule for me to Print my Works under my Eyes, to avoid those errors that
the negligence of the Printer often throws upon the Author: But because of two
Inconveniences, the worst is most to be looked after, I shall acquaint you
that my principal Motive for a Foreign Impression, was to avoid the churlish
Censure of Supervisors, that have read nothing, and are no Judges. There are
such in this Province so very unreasonable, that because they have raised their
dwarfish wit to a Giant conceit, we must accommodate our humble and modest
meaning to their fancied Standard. These Beetles, bred out of the Excrements of
other Peoples Collections, pretend to Judge of the Odours of Learned Writings,
whose fragrancy destroys their very Being, arising out of Filth and Jakes. He
that writes for another Instruction ought to be no small Friend to correction:
Nor should he take it ill that his Compositions are sometimes moderately
censured by wise and able Critics. But, on the other hand, if they will be so
severe as to endeavor to suppress a noble Undertaking for want of a necessary
perfection, he may be reasonably allowed to take it amiss. Heaven prosper all
your excellent Writings, and defend 'em from the false Judgments of busy
pretenders, who may either condemn 'em to the Flames or Shades, both alike
injurious to ingenious Men, whilst I Subscribe, etc.

LETTER LVII. The Ermin to the Weesel. Upon Treachery.
A Damned confounded Mule has played me a scurvy trick; for all a-long,
dissembling the ill will he bore me, he desired to be employed in a certain
Affair, that very much related to my Interest, and whose good success
absolutely depended upon his Management; when I, deceived by his courteous
Offers, revealed to him the greatest Secrets of my breast, and committed my
whole dependence to his discretion: And thereupon writing him a loving Letter,
that he should be fully satisfied with my Gratitude, the perfidious Beast was
pleased to wrest my honest meaning to an ill sense, and would have fain
interpreted me guilty of a Crime I never so much as dreamed of. And laying
aside all Truth and Friendship, thought to support his Accusation, by denying
he ever had any thing to do with me. Thus, Sir, you may see how dangerous it is
to confide in any one that has once professed himself one's Enemy; but one would
think so wise a Court of Justice, should not give credit to a Beast that had
before been Convicted in it of Perjury; yet we see the practice of the World,
and I must prepare for my Defense, that I may endeavor at least to satisfy
good People of my Innocence, though I am unjustly Sentenced to this imminent
punishment: Thus deploring my hard Fortune, I recommend Yours to your tutelary
Genius: And so Subscribe, etc.

LETTER LVIII. The Weesel's Answer. Upon the Same.
YOu ought not to wonder or complain, Sir, of one that acts according to his
Nature, if he cannot be well supposed to behave himself otherwise; and if you
receive any damage by his means, you should rather consider it as the necessity
of his Inclinations, than blame his breach of Articles. How could you imagine
or expect any Friendship from one that by Nature is Barren and Fruitless? Ill
interpretations, whence can they proceed but from a perfidious Mind? All
thoughts are originally derived from the heart, and it is easy for any body to
imagine a Crime in one he desires it in. A resolution of so great a consequence
as threatened Life, one would think, should have been better considered of; but
where Reason is guided by Passion, the wisest Court of Justice is always blind;
where Interest no^ choice pretends a Freindship Treachery is never far off;
where Malice sways the Scepter, Injustice is ever near* Comfort your self
therefore, Sir, with this certainty, that Heaven does not roll its Spheres for
greater Ends than the protection of the Innocent; in the mean time, Accept of
my hearty Compunction, whilst I Subscribe, etc.

LETTER LIX. The Bear to the Civit-Cat. Upon Servants.
I Am satisfied you will have occasion to laugh, as soon as ever you receive
this Letter; it being composed of nothing else but Complaints, against a
subject of the Gallows: I mean a Servant of mine, who by his negligence and
rashness, is become very deserving of such a punishment. When this Fellow came
first to live with me he promised mighty matters; endeavoring to persuade me
he was qualified with all the Sciences; and that he possessed many other Arts;
which made me the easier condescend to receive him into my House; though must
confess he was but a shabby Fellow: Yet the consideration of being Universally
obeyed by one Man, made me dispense with all other difficulties: He was
extraordinary diligent, and peaceable for one Month, that I could not desire
better. But because every right side has its wrong, at length, having a mind to
give me farther proofs of his Excellencies; he began to play the part of a
Physician, and feel the pulse of my Bottles; and because the sweet Liquor might
not create choler, he took care to let 'em often Blood. Also he made use of
Spring Water to qualify the superfluous heat: From thence he went into the
Granary, where he also behaved himself like a very skilful Geometrician,
dividing and parting the Corn into many Figures. And because that he had often
scruples about the Measure; he was very diligent to make frequent trials at the
Market, and so, in short, soon emptied my Granary. The Magaziners are very
cunning at Venice, in showing their Chapmen a pair of heels, but they must
yield themselves outdone by my Arithmetician, who goes far beyond 'em in the
Multiplication of shifts; having taken especial are to make 'em by Sea, that he
might ^ot by a long and heavy Pen be obliged ^o make a convenient substraction
to ^is Roguery. I almost forgot to acquaint ^ou, How he had a great mind to be
thought a Philosopher, for having often times read to the Chambermaid the
pleasing subject de Generatione and Corruptione, he at length became so
absolute a Master of his Art, that with his frequent application and her
assiduous attention, she began to be a little Dropsical; and her Belly
afterward increasing, was a means to give her occasion to think of Godfathers.
For this and other causes I am at present without a Servant, so that if you
would oblige me with one of your Experience, or whose Manners you are
sufficiently acquainted with, I should esteem it no small favor conferred
upon, etc.

LETTER LX. The Civit-Cat's Answer. Upon the same.
HE that is moderately Rich, as many believe, is not always the happiest Man;
for where other misfortunes have no power over him, that of being plagued with
bad Servants will make him miserable enough. To be served by qualified Persons
makes no difference. For he that shall thirst after Honor and Riches, to make
this Experience, will find that Great Men's Servants, as well as Poor, are
Slaves to Interest and Advantage; and that they are to be distinguished only by
their Habits. For the first feeding themselves with hopes, and thinking to
advance their Fortunes, by the munificence of their Masters, either deceive 'em
with Flattery, or Tyranize over 'em with their double Tongues. When the others
also knowing they have parted with their Liberty for a few Pence, will be
always ready to make use of shifts to recompense themselves for that which
another's Covetousness has taken from them; and because they are less sensible
of the wounds of Reputation, they will be always more prepared to act any
manner of Villainy. In short, the greater is our Number of Servants: No lesser
is that of our Enemies. It Is folly to think that these will serve to Augment a
Man's Fortunes, when the very Name of a Servant carries in it their destruction
and depression, as we may find by this significant Anagram, of Servitore, O Res
Vrit! These are the Generation of Vipers meant in the Scriptures: Therefore you
would do very well to give over thinking of one of any tolerable Honesty or
good Manners, amongst 'em, it being impossible that so good qualities should be
found in such mean and base Souls. Nevertheless, I shall do my best to gratify
your desires, whilst I subscribe, etc.
