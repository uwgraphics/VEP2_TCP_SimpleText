A small Table to find the day of the month for ever.
THough the Table hereafter expressed is no Invention worthy the owning in
Print, and is now above ten years since communicated to diverse of my friends,
and by them, to many whose faces I never saw, yet having been of late much
pressed by several of my acquaintance, to publish a word or two in relation to
the use thereof, I thought fit to yield thereunto so far as to show how the day
of the Month for any year to come (being the principal end for which it was
Invented) might be discovered thereby.

YOU may observe, that the two uppermost lines in this Table are divided from
the rest by a double stroke, and do serve to express the Months, according The
Table of 5 7 4 12 6 3 11 2 10 0 9.1 0 0 8 The Table 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 00 00 00 00 to their
Numeral order; for March being the first Month (the Sun then entering Aries) is
expressed by the figure. 1. April, the 2. Month, by the figure 2. according to
which order, September is the 7. October the 8. November the 9. and December
the tenth Month, as their names do signify; and are expressed in the
aforesaid Table by their correspondent numbers.

Thus you have in the first Collumne toward the left hand, the fifth and the
second Month, in the second Collumne the seventh and the tenth Month, in the
third Collumne the fourth Month, in the fourth Collumne the twelfth, ninth and
first Month (for note, that the figures 9. and 1. though they both stand in
one square, signify two Months, viz. both November and March) in the fifth
Collumne you have the sixth Month, that is August, and so of the rest.

The figures below the said double line do signify days, as hereafter does
appear.

To find the day of the Month at any time, observe that those days which
stand right under any Month are always the first days of the week, (commonly
called Sundays) for this present year 1655.

Thus if you look for March, (which is the first Month,) you shall find it in
the fourth Collumne, and right underneath the same, you shall find the figures,
4. 11. 18. 25. All which show that the fourth of March this year, is Sunday,
and also the 11. 18. and 25. So you shall find April, which is the second
Month in the first Collumne toward the left hand, and underneath the same, 1.
8. 15. etc. and August which is the sixth Month in the fifth Collumne, and
underneath the same 5. 12. 19. etc. All which days being right under their
respective Months) are Sundays.

Now when you would find the day of the Month by the aforesaid Table, you must
Consider as in the Case of the common Almanacks, what Month and what day of
the week it is; And then you must enter the Table for that Month and
underneath the same you have (I say) the Collumne of Sundays, the next after
which is the Collumne of Mondayes, and the next after that of Tuesdayes; and so
you must pass from one Collumne to another, till you come to that Collumne
which Answers to the present day of the week; where according as the Month is
near the beginning, middle, or ending thereof, you will find your desire; as
for example,

It is the third day of the week, and the beginning of August in this year
1655. I would know what day of the Month it is?

Answ. Entering the Table of Months, I find August, which is the sixth Month, in
the fifth Collumne, and right underneath the same 5. 12. 19. 26, these are the
first days of the week for that Month. The next Collumne therefore toward the
right hand ( viz. 6. 13. etc.) are the second days of the week; and the next
beyond that, viz. 7. 14. etc. are the third days of the week which are the
days I seek for. Being therefore now about the beginning of August, and the
third day of the week, I Conclude thereupon that it is the 7. day of the Month.

It is now about the later end of June, which is the fourth Month, and the
fourth day of the week, in the aforesaid year, I desire to know what day of the
Month it is?

Answ. I find June in the third Collumne, which third Collumne being ^he first
days of the week in that Month, I pass from thence to the next Collumne, for
the second days of the week, and to the next for the third days of the week,
and to the next beyond that for the fourth, where I find 6. 13. 20. 27. whereby
I conclude, it is now the 27. day of the Month.

So for May (which is the third Month,) you shall find it in the sixth Collumne,
whereby you may perceive that the first days of the week are 6. 13. 20. 27.
the 2d. days of the week 7. 14. 21. etc. the third days of the week 1. 8. 15.
etc. (according as you find them in the first Collumne toward the left hand)
the fourth days of the week 2. 9. 16. etc.

Thus also if for speed, you desire to account backwards, as (suppose) in
November, (which is found in the fourth Collumne,) and underneath the same 4.
11. 18. etc. which are the first days of the week, therefore going backwards
toward the left hand 3. 10. 17. are the seventh days of the week for that
Month; and 2. 9. 16. etc. are the sixth days of the week; and 1. 8. 15. the 5.
days of the week, for that Month.

You must further observe, that several years answer to several days of the
week; So that as this year, answers to the first day of the Week, so there are
other years that Answer to the 2. to the 3. to the fourth, and so on; (which
those others are, I shall show immediately.

Now as in this year, that answers to the first days, all the days right
under each Month are the first days of the Week for that Month; so in a year
that answers to the third day of the Week, all the days under each Month, are
the third days of the Week in that Month, and the days in the Collumne next
following are the fourth days, and next following that the fifth days of the
Week, etc. and the days next going before those right underneath the said
Month, are the second days of the Week, and those next before them the first
days, etc.

As for example, suppose it were June, which is the fourth Month in a year,
that answers to the third day of the Week, viz. Tuesday: I enter the table and
find June in the third Collumn; and the days right underneth it, are 3. 10.
17. which therefore are all Tuesdayes, the days following in the next Collumne
are 4. 11. 18. etc. which therefore are all Wednesdayes, and the days
following in the next Collumne, 5. 12. 19. which are all Thursdayes, etc. So if
I go backwards, the days next before the said 3. 10. 17. which are I say,
Tuesdayes, are 2. 9. 16. which are Mondayes, and those next before them. 1. 8.
15. which are Sundays, and those next before them 7. 14. 21. which are
Saturdayes.

So if the year should answer to the 5. day of the week, which is Thursday,
then in this fourth Month, viz. June, the figures underneath the same being 3.
10. 17. are all Thursdayes; and those next following 4. 11. 18. Fridayes, those
next before, viz. 2. 9. 16. Wednesdayes.

That you may know what day of the week answers to every year; Note that if the
present year answer (suppose) to the 5. day of the week, then (except in the
case of leap year) the next year answers to the sixth day of the week, the next
to the seventh, the next to the first, the next to the second, and so on in
order to the end of the World.

Note further, that every leap year has two days belonging to it, whereof
one continues all January and February, and the other, all the rest of the
Months, and then for the 3. years following the same day continues (as is
said) from one new years day to another: Where note that the alteration for all
years, (except leap year,) begins at new years day, and not in March.

Thus this year 1655. reckoned from New-years-day, which was in 1654. till the
next New-years-day, answers I say, to the first day of the Week, and the next
year being leap year, all January and February, answers to the second day of
the week, and the rest of the Months till New-years-day, to the third day of
the Week; and all the year following that, to the fourth; all the year next
following to the fifth, the next year to the sixth, and then the next year
being leap year again (for every fourth year is leap year) January and
February therein answer to the 7. day of the week, And the Months following
till New-years-day to the first day of the week; and so the 3. years following
to the second, the third and the fourth days of the week; and so for ever
according to this Table following,

years days 1655 1 1656 2 1656 3 1657 4 1658 5 1659 6 1660 7 1660 1 1661 2 1662
3 1663 4 1664 5 1664 6 1665 7 1666 1 1667 2 1668 3 1668 4 1669 5 1670 6 1671 7
1672 1 1672 2 1673 3

I shall clear the meaning of this Table by one Instance or two.

I desire to know what day of the week answers to the year 1661.

Answ. I enter the Table, and find, that year, and against the same, the figure
2. which shows, that the second day of the week answers to that year.

Again, I desire to know what day of the week answers to the year 1660.

Answ. I enter the Table, and find that year twice expressed, and against it I
find first the figure 7. and next the figure 1. So that I conclude it is a
leap year; and that the first part of the year viz. the Month, of January and
February answer to the 7. day of the week; and that the rest of the Months
answers to the first days of the Week.

Now though I have expressed all this in a Table, to show the Orderly
Succession thereof, yet it will be no burden to any man's memory to carry one
day in his mind for a whole year together; and two days at the most in the
case of leap year, or (knowing what day answers to the present year) to reckon
without a Table what day answers to the succeeding years, observing the
orderly succession thereof, as it is here expressed; which might in like manner
be continued to any number of years required.

FINIS.
