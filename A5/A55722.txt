THE PRESENT STATE OF The Protestant Religion IN MARYLAND*
IN the Year, 1691. His Majesty having graciously thought sit to take the
Government of MARYLAND into his own hands, and the Province into his Immediate
Care: In May, 1692. an Act of Assembly passed for the Establishment of the
Protestant Religion there, and for dividing of the TEN COUNTIES thereof into
Five and twenty Parishes, each of which, are endowed with a competent
Maintenance for a Minister, But the Execution of that Act has been in a manner
wholly neglected, till it pleased His MAJESTY to confer the Government on the
most Worthy and Excellent Person, FRANCIS NICHOLSON, Esquire who since his Arrival
in Aug. 1694. with an indefatigable Industry and Zeal to promote his MAJESTY's
Honor, the Int^rest of the Protestant Religion, and the Good of the whole
Province, has Revived and Reinforced the said Act, by another Additional one,
for the Increase and Maintenance of Religion; has Collected the Arrears, and
is now Building several Churches, besides one Fine Church at ANNOPOLIS, in
ARVNDEL County, with a Parsonage-House to every Church; toward all which his
Excellency, the Council, and other Inhabitants of the Province, have generously
and largely Contributed.

And that a perpetual Succession of Protestant Divines of the CHURCH OF
ENGLAND, may be provided for the Propagation of the True Christian Religion in
the said Colony, His EXCELLENCY has by the Consent of the Council and
Burgesses in Assembly, promoted a Law, vesting a Power in certain Trustees for
Erecting one Free School in each County: One of which is already begun at
ANNOPOLIS, And is to be Endowed with 100 l* Sterling per Annum for the
Maintenance of one Master, and two Ushers, for instructing the Youth of the
said Province in ARITHMETIC, NAVIGATION, and all USEFUL LEARNING; but chiefly
for the sitting such as are disposed to Study DIVINITY, to be further Educated
at His Majesty's COLLEGE ROYAL in VIRGINIA; in order, upon their Return, to be
Ordained by the Lord Bishop of LONDON's SUFFRAGAN Residing in the Province,
both for that purpose, and to supervise the Lives of the Clergy thereof; for
whose Support also, at the Request and Recommendation of the Assembly, his
EXCELLENCY has settled a fair and competent Maintenance.

The Person now Deputed by the Lord Bishop of LONDON, to be his COMMISSARY in
MARYLAND for the propagation of our most Holy Religion amongst the Infidels,
for the Inducement of Sober and Serious Young Divines, to go to the Foreign
Plantations, and for the better qualifying them for so Noble and Christian an
Employment, is now wholly busied in Collecting of PAROCHIAL LIBRARIES of Choice
and Useful Books, for the perpetual Use of such of the Clergy, who shall now
undertake that Voyage, and for all those who shall succeed them. AND certainly,
a more suitable Encouragement to Men of good parts and Inclinations, to go upon
so Blessed a Mission, could not be thought of: For as it is Books alone which
will encourage the most Studious, Virtuous, and consequently the most Useful
Persons to go over; so it is an encouragement that is in a manner necessary to
be provided in the Foreign Plantations; since few or none at their first going
over, are in a Condition to provide themselves therewith; and when they are
there* Books are hardly to be met with by those who shall be able to buy them.
And yet without a Competent Provision of several Useful and Necessary Books, it
is morally impossible that any should be enabled to instruct their People.

And now that such Excellent Works are jointly begun, and carrying on, What a
happy Conjuncture is this (which perhaps may not again recur) for Persons who
are Piously disposed; to give their helping hand toward such Blessed and
Glorious Designs, as the propagating of true Christian Knowledge and Practice
in places formerly so much Uncultivated therewith. Sure if he who Converteth a
single Sinner from the Error of his Ways, shall hide a multitude of Sins, what
abundant matter for comfortable; Reflections upon a Deathbed, shall that
Person lay up, who shall contribute toward providing of the most proper and
Genuine Means, next to the Divinely Inspired Writings, of Converting many poor
Souls, not only in this, but in all future Generations, even so long as the Sun
and Moon endures.

Benedicat Deus Operi and faventibus.
FINIS.
