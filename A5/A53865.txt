Directed to the several Heads of Houses, respectively; at the beginning of
Michaelmas Term.1678.
SIR,
I do most earnestly desire you to assist me in removing the neglect of wearing
the University Habits at Solemn meetings according to the Statutes: which is
generally complained of. Especially the neglect of Hoods at St. Mary's at
Latin Sermons and Sunday mornings in the Term time. And

1. That you would now bring your whole House to the Latin Sermon on the first
day of this next Term, and require of the Batchelors of Divinity, and Masters,
to appear then in their Hoods: Giving them notice of it some time before hand,
that they may not excuse it by want of warning. And let them be admonished to
come to St. Mary's on the Sunday mornings in Term afterward in Habits
required: Which is according to the Oath at the time of their first taking
their Degrees.

2. That you would admonish all Batchelors of Arts to wear their Hoods at the
same times at St. Mary's, under the Penalties of the Statute. And let them know
that the Gallery keepers shall have express orders to admit none into the
Gallery without their Hoods. And further that I shall desire the Proctors and
Pro-Proctors to exact penalties of such as after this warning shall neglect to
appear in their Hoods and Caps at such times.

JOH. NICHOLAS Vice-Can.
