EDINBVRGH, Printed for Robert Broun, at the sign of the Sun, on the North-side
of the Street, 1660.

To all the LADIES of this NATION.
Fair Ladies,
I Do, like Moses trembling mother, leave this my first born upon the banks of
envies current, exposed to the muddy and impetuous streams of merciless
censure; wishing, that the fair hands of the meanest of your number would
vouchsafe to dandle it in the lapp of your protection; It is but an abortive
birth, posted to the world before its time, by an unavoidable emergent, and so
I fear shall never prove strong, nor be able to go much abroad: Yet if it be
admitted to suck the breasts of your favor, it may possibly prove strong
enough (shielded by your affection) to graple with malice, and all other
opposition. Whilst my winged curiosity, pilgrimaged through all the corners
of my memory; desirous to know wherewith it was fittest to adorn the porch of
this mean structure; duty at last pleaded, that it was lese-majesty against
your supremacy, even to doubt whether it was fit to give you the precedence.
For, since the best eyed fancy, cannot observe any traite in your peerless
faces, wherein nature has not prodigalled her charms; so perfection were
imprudent, and so no perfection, if it palaced not it self in such accomplished
creatures. And if there be any Orthodox maxim in Phisognomy, we may conclude,
that such excellent faces are assorted with excellent souls: Providence being
like these prudent Artists, who bestow the choicest cases only upon the richest
pieces. And seeing one look darted from your irresistible eyes, is able to
conquer, in a moment, these over whom neither reason, nor courage, could never
raise their trophies; we may conclude that there is something in you, which
nothing in man (who seigneurises over all other creatures, and who can pretend
to nothing stronger then courage and reason) can ever equal. It is to pleasure
you that wit is studied, and were it not that ye might be pleased, certainly
providence had placed wit beyond the reach of our studies: it is to sooth your
humor, that men school themselves in patience; and by your miraculous voice,
the storms of their passions are calmed; from your beauty, cowards borrow
courage, and niggards liberality; So that all these scattered colonies of
virtues, which are squandred amongst men, are all originated from your example.
But as it was duty, so it is prudence in me to beg your patronage; for how can
the body of this Book be abissed, and sink in the gulf of scorn, if its head be
handed up by such admired beauties; neither think I, that malice can be so
malicious, as to along a thurst at the author, who ensconces himself behind
such sacred persons; lest the blow destinated for him should wound them who
targets him. I have chosen so many patronesses, to evidence that there is none
of your never enough admired sex, but may lay claim to the patronage of all
that drops from my pen; as also, fearing that among such a number, I should
scarce find one who would be so excessively hospital, as to lodge in her
Cabinet or Chamber such an unacknowledged Orphelin. The disappointment of my
fears in this, is rather the wish, then the expectation of,

Fair Ladies, Your most humble Servant.

An Apology for ROMANCES.
IT has been rather the fate, then merit of Romances in all ages, to be
asperst with these vices, whereof they were not only innocent, but to whose
ante-doting virtues they might justly pretend: for whereas they are judged to
be both the fire, and faggots, whereby Loved flames are both kindled and
alimented; I believe verily, that there is nothing can so easily extinguish
them, for as these who have at Court, seen numbers of peerless and well decked
beauties; can hardly become enamoured of an ordinary Country-maid; So these who
have seen a Philoclea, or Cleopatra, depenciled by the curious wits of Sidney,
and Scuderie, will hardly be invassalled by the (to them scarce approaching)
treats of these, whom this age garlands for admired beauties. Others for sooth
accuse them, for robbing us of our precious time; but this reproach is ill
founded; for if the Romance be abject, none will trisle away their time in
reading it, except these who would mispend it however, and if they be
excellent, then times is rather spent then misspent in leafing them over. There
is also a third race of detracters, who condemn them as lies; but since their
Authors propose them, not with an intention to deceive, they cannot properly be
reputed such: And albeit they seem but fables, yet who would unkernel them,
would find budled up in them real truths; and as naturalists observe, these
kernels are best where the shells are hardest; and these metals are noblest,
which are mudded over wi^h most earth. But to leave such Phanaticks in the
bedlame of their own fancies, who should blush to trace in these paths, which
the famous Sidney, Scuderie, Barkley, and Broghill has beaten for them,
besides thousands of Ancients, and Moderns, Ecclesiastics, and Laics,
Spaniards, French, and Italians, to remunerat whose endeavors, fame has
wreathed Garlands (to be temple their ingenious and ingenuous heads) which
shall never fade whilst Learning flourishes. I shall speak nothing of that
noble Roma^ce, written by a Bishop, which the entreaty of all the Eastern
Churches could never prevail with him to disown; and I am confident, that where
Romances are written by excellent wits, and perused by intelligent Readers,
that the judgment may pick more sound information from them, then from
History, for the one teaches us only what was done, and the other what should
be done; and whereas Romances presents to us, virtue in its holy day robes,
History presents her only to us in these ordinary, and spotted suits which she
wears whilst she is busied in her servile, and lucrative employments: and as
many would be incited to virtue and generosity, by reading in Romances, how
much it has been honored; So contrary wise, many are deterred by historical
experience from being virtuous, knowing that it has been oftener punished then
acknowledged. Romances are these vessels which strain the crystal streams of
virtue from the puddle of interest; whereas history suffers the memory to quaff
them of in their mixed impuritie; by these likewise lazy Ladies and luxurious
Gallants, are allured to spend in their Chambers some hours, which else, the
one would consecrat to the Bed, and the other to the Bordell: and albeit
essays be the choicest Pearls in the Jewel house of moral Philosophy, yet I
ever thought that they were set off to the best advantage, and appeared with
the greatest luster, when they were laced upon a Romance; that so the curiosity
might be satisfied, as well as the judgment informed, especially in this age
wherein the appetit of men's judgments is become so queasie, that it can
relish nothing that is not either vinegared with Satyrs, or suggared with
Eloquence.

I know that these who have devanced us in this employment, will as our eldest
brothers in time, have a double portion of fame bestowed upon them, and no
wonder, seeing they had store both of expression and invention to make choice
of, and if any of us use their expressions, albeit we were only debtor to our
own invention for them, yet we should be thought to plagiarize: wherefore he
who writes now, should read what has been written formerly; not to the intent
that he may borrow, but least he should borrow any thing that is theirs. I
perceive there have been two errors committed by the first writers of
Romances: the first was, that they stuffed their Books with things
impracticable, which because they were above the reach of man's power, they
should never have fallen within the circle of his observation: and such was
Amadis de Gaul, Palmeron de Oliva etc. The other error was in the style,
which because of its soaring pitch was inimitable: and as the first has been
the fault of the first writers, So the last has been the fault of the last
writers, wherefore the famous Scuderie has written so, as that his invention
may suit well with our practice, and his style with our discourse, and
especially in his Clelia, wherein he professes that he has adapted all to the
present converse of the French Nation and that is really the mould wherein all
true Romances should be casten. There are some who embroider their discourse
with Latin and Greek terms, thinking, like these who are charmers, that the
charm loses its energie, if the words be not used in Latin. But this is as
rideculous, as if one who desires to make his face seem pleasant, should
enamble it with red, blew, green, and other colors; which though they are in
themselves pleasant, yet are rediculous when placed there. And this is an
university style, which savours too much its pedant, and is at best but bastard
oratory, seeing the scope of all Orators is to persuade, and there can be no
persuasion where the term is not understood; examples of this are Brown,
Charletoun, etc. The second style, is that of moral Philosophers, where the
periods are short, and the sense strong, and our experience teaches us, that
the shorter any thing be, it is the stronger: this style suits best with
Preachers, whose it is to debit the grand mysteries of Faith and Religion; for,
seeing sentences there should be weighty, if they were either many, or long,
they would burden too much the hearers. The third style, is that of Barrasters,
which is flourished with similees, and where are used long winded periods; and
of all others, this is the most preferable, for seeing similitude is but a
harmony, this style shows that excellent harmony, and rapport, which God
intended in the first Creation; and which the Philosophers of all ages have
ever since admired. This Lawyers have learned from the paucitie of all humane
Laws, which makes them often recurr to that topic, which teaches them to
argument from the paritie of reason. And in this they resemble Mechanics, who,
by applying a cord, whose length they know, to any body whose length they
ignore, do thereby learn its measures also. And by this way Nathan in the old
Testament, and our Savior in the new, repremands the errors of David and the
self conceated Jews. The fourth style is where the cadence is sweet, and the
epithets well adapted, without any other varnish whatsoever: and this is that
style which is used at Court, and is paterned to us by eloquent Scuderie. I
hear there is now a ridiculous caball of Ladies at Paris, who term themselves
the precious, and who paraphrase every thing they speak of, terming a mirror,
the conselour of beauty, and a chair, the commodity of conversation, etc. And
thus they have progressed from painting of faces to paint expressions.

As for my self, since I expect no applause, I need fear no censure; and if I
satisfy not others, I shall at least satisfy my self, for it was to form to
my self a style that I undertook this Piece, whose defects I hope the sober
readers will pardon, since their clemency will not be often tempted with crimes
of this nature: only this I beg, that these who will not do me the favor to
read the last part, will not do me the wrong to read the first part; for as the
Lord Bakon very well observes, our thoughts are like our years, whereof the
first are always the worst; and it is no wonder, for boiling youth customarly
throws the scum upmost. I have concealed my name till I see how my undertaking
is relished; for which reason likewise, I have sent this Piece to the world
unaccompanied, as a swatch of what I intend, reserving the Web, till I see how
the Stuff pleases. The subject has made this first part serious, and my
inclination shall make the second pleasant.

A POEM, by the same Author, upon His Majesty's happy Return.
STay, Fame, why do thou to the Future post,
To Learn some new adventures? tym's not lost
In viewing our Great CHARLES his safe return,
Resembling ashes new sprung from their Urn;
Or do thou post to trumpet these rare news,
To Godless Pagans, or to Christless Jews?
Thereby them to convince, that there is a God
Among'st the Christians, who will explod
Out of his noble registers of life and fame,
Ignoble traitors, and their hatfull name.
Man's oldest Charter is that Text divine,
All that thy feet can trample shall be thine;
Since then his feet has trampled Europe round,
It Is only Limit shall his Kingdom bound,
Though France and Spain be compted the two Poles,
Whereon our European orb still roles,
Yet thou the Axis of that orb shall be,
To wheel these Poles as it best pleases thee.
Heaven him exiled not, but sent him abroad,
To show the matchless art of our great God
In framing matchless spirits, and to each
Of these strange Nations, Patience to preach.
Malice, with fruitless strokes shall wearied now
Yield up her sword, and to thy Scepter bow.
Thou fortunes wheel, by virtues hand shall hold
And stop the course of that proud changling bold.
With black affliction Heaven thus enambled has
For further Luster, his pure Golden faith;
And as with crosses Heaven did once him wound,
So now with crosses Heaven has him crowned*
All shall our Thristle, the blessed Thristle call,
And in fames Eden our Rose flourish shall,
And of our Lillies we may Justly say,
That Solomon never flourished as they;
Let then our Harp play, and our Lions dance,
For joy that Heaven should thus our King advance.
Great Gloucester's Cipressehearse, wreathed by a Loyal hand.
WE did admire what made the heavens tear,
And why the clouds did such dark sables wear:
It was that they in tears might pay respect
To Gluocester, whom they did much affect:
And that the hard hearted earth might softened be;
At the sad news of his sad Tragedy.
The lower heavens thus purged themselves, that they
Might in parade be, when he passed their way:
The season wep't in rain, and sighed in wind,
Our mother earth did great distempers find
At her great loss, and with a pale wet face,
Did her dear Son in her cold arms embrace.
The rivers swelled with rage, and every hill,
Was with a vail of black mist covered still.
The leaves likewise, fell trembling from their trees
When first they heard news of his obsequies.
If Plato like the music of the Sphaers,
We understood, then might our nimble ears
Perceive, how they quiv'rd grief in mournful tones.
Paused with sighs, and bass'd with hollow groans.
Men thought, Dame nature now being old and weak,
Durst nothing that was curious undertake;
Wherefore, to show men that they were mistaken,
That master piece was by her undertaken;
Which though it was presented as her last;
Show she a printise was, in making what was past.
And though in Eden commenced was the Creation,
Yet its accomplishment was from our British Nation.
His body showed to what perfection rare,
Dust might refined be by divine care:
And yet God thought it neither fit nor just,
That such a noble soul should lodge in dust,
Until that dust by Death were more refined,
And fired to re-lodge so great a mind:
The Gods Apollo have deprived, that he
As the more learned should have his dietie.
But why should air? lend mortals further breath,
Its sure, that they may still condole his death,
And may it coin in terms of Highest praise,
And stamp that coin with some heart brusting phrase.
But since he is gone, we may conclude that sure
There is another world yet more pure
Then ours, or that Heavens quire did want a voice,
Which only could supplied be by this choice*
And that God has this Peer from earth's lower house transplanted
To the high upper house of heaven, for ever to be sainted*
To his ingenious Friend, the Author of Aretina.
Thy beardless chin high voicedly does declare,
That wisdoms strength lies not in silvered hair:
And as few Ciphers, rich sums does express;
So thy rich wit shines in a few years dress,
For as men did the Suns first light admire;
So art thou loved when thou do first appear.
Yet shall thy Crocodil like fame still grow,
And on its shore, praises shall ever flow.
Reader,
Correct these Errors with thy Pen, before thou read the Book.

ARETINA; OR, The Serious Romance.
MELANCHOLY having lodged it self in the generous breast of Monanthropus
(lately Chancellor of Egypt) did, by the chain of its Charms, so fetter the
feet of his Reason, that nothing pleased him now but that whereby he might
please that passion; thinking all time misspent which was not spent in its
service, frequenting more Woods than Men, deeming them the only fit grove to
sacrifice in, the choicest of his thoughts to the worst of passions. Wherefore,
having one day wandered abroad in a neighboring Desert, he came at last to a
deep Valley, fruitful of nothing but Trees, and Trees fruitful of nothing but
Melancholy, overlookt by Rocks, in whose wrink^ed faces, aged Time had plowed
thousands of deep furrows, whose gloomy brows threatened perpetually to smother
the subjacent Valleys; a place fit only to be (as it was presently) the
hermitage of Melancholy and stage of Cruelty: He had not long stayed, when his
admiration was arrested by a noise blown in his ears (as he thought) by the
bellows of Death, yet seconded by a sight yet more horrid: for, he saw at some
distance two Ladies, loaded with Iron sheckles, which chained them together,
stripped of their clothes above the middle, and strypt by two cruel Rascals, who
(albeit torture made the Ladies run) yet equalled the number of their lashes to
that of their paces; and not far from them, were ten Gentlemen (as they seemed
by their habits) fighting against two Knights followed only by one Esquire;
where courage seemed to combat against number, valor making the ten seem but
three, and fear making the three seem ten; yet courage show at last that it
might be resisted by number, but could not be overcome by it; for, the death of
six, forewarned the other four, that it was not time to stay: fear having left
them only so much reason as to conclude, that seeing they could not resist them,
being ten, how could they resist when they were but four? wherefore, leaving
floods of blood to witness the gallantry of their conquering adversaries, they
posted away: The Knights willing to pursue these run-awayes (who had now added
cowardisnesse to their former crimes) yet more willing to rescue the miserable
Ladies, left these Rascals to be punished by a torturing conscience, and the
just gods, and spurred after the Ladies, who were presently abandoned by these
Hangmen; but Providence (which had borrowed their swiftness to lend it to
their adversar^es) delivered these Villains into the hands of the pursuing
Knights, who brought them back where the Ladies were, bathing themselves in
their own innocent blood: who having fallen on their feeble knees, the eldest
of them weeping, spoke thus; O noble Gentlemen, surely Providence had never
created such silly creatures as weak women, if they had not likewise provided
such noble Champions as ye are to be guardians to their weak innocence, and
innocent weakness: We acknowledge we are yours (if blood be a price able to
buy things of small value) neither can those to whom we belonged formerly
pretend right any longer to us, no more than the first owners can pretend right
to their goods, which being robbed from them by unjust Pirates, are after some
time and danger regained by other true Conquerours; or Land taken by Usurpers,
is to be restored by a third Conqueror to its first masters: Happy we, who
cannot by any postliminius right, return to our former liberty, seeing to be
slaves to such masters is to be no slaves at all. But seeing our tears are no
fit recompense, for those tears of blood which your bodies both have shed, and
yet do shed for us, we shall cease to trouble you, whom we cannot requite.

But whilst they were admiring what was already spoken (wherein she showed
much Learning from whom no Learning could be expected) and whilst she was about
to add more, Monanthropus, by his coming, interrupted, both the admiration of
the one, and the discourse of the other, who, puzzled whether to congratulate
the good fortune of the Knights, to regrate the misery of the Ladies, or to
accuse the cruelty of those Rascals (with whom the Knights had made them to
exchange fetters) who were now standing accused by their own roguish looks, yet
at last he accosted the Knights thus: Gentlemen, albeit I might accuse you as
strangers, for exercing any jurisdiction, much more the highest jurisdiction,
in a stranger Nation, yet your valor, your success, and your cause, obliges
me to believe, that ye are commissionated by the immortal gods, to punish these
Rascals, and to liberate these noble Ladies: for, seeing such extraordinary
feats as ye have done, are above the reach of such ordinary means as is man's
strength, we must believe that they are either perpetrated immediately by
supernal or infernal powers; and seeing the infernal furies are not so much
friends to innocence, as to help it, or so much enemies to cruelty, as to
punish it, we must think, that ye have been aided by some divine power;
therefore I shall rather admire than challenge you; for, to no purpose is the
admirative faculty bestowed upon man, if it be not exercised in such cases as
this: therefore let me beg of you to lodge with me this night, seeing the
condition of these Ladies pleads for good accommodation, and there is none to
be had for persons of either your or their quality, besides my house, whose
best accommodation is, its nearness to this place. To which the tallest of
these two Knights (named Megistus) replied thus; Courteous Sir, neither ye, nor
these Ladies, have reason to extol so much our courage, as to admire these
fellows cowardishnesse, and to think that their guiltiness was their strongest
enemy, and that the veriest Coward could not but be stout in such a quarrel:
but as to your proffer, albeit we thank you extremely for it, yet we will wait
upon these Ladies to shelter them from any future inconveniencie, and to see
them beginning to return from the region of death, wherein they seem now to
enter; for, seeing providence has given them us for attenders, it were a breach
of trust to desert them. But the poor Ladies, (who were about not only to
accept the proffered accommodation, but likewise to beg it before it was
proffered) thanked Monanthropus for his kindness, and entreated the Knights to
go along with them: which when they had accorded to, after much reluctance,
he mounted the Ladies behind the Knights, and whilst they paced slowly, both to
case the Ladies, and to keep company with Monanthropus, who refused to ride
upon Kalodulus his horse (for so was he who served the Knights named) both
Monanthropus, and the two Knights, joined in a suit to the Ladies, that they
would inform them both of the rise and tract of their so lamentable misfortune;
especially Monanthropus, whose Melancholy appetite rellished nothing so well as
what was sauced with novelty, to which the sweet Ladies easily condiscended;
grief being like a Mine, which the greater vent it gets is the less noisome,
as also knowing that the villainy of their enemies would conciliat respect to
their innocence; so the Lady who spoke formerly, broke off thus: Gentlemen, our
father (who was a Nobleman in Thracia) was one, who lived rather to study, than
studied how to live; and who endeavored more to treasure up Learning in
himself, than Money for his posterity, yet who never stained his blotlesse fame
with either negligence, or prodigality; yet it was rather his fortune, than his
merit, to be misconstrued by most of his neighbors, and mainly for his
retiredness; some thinking that he conversed not with them because he thought
them unworthy to be conversed with; others thought his retiredness flowed from
his being conscious to some imperfection in himself, which made him unfit for
conversation; So that as the one hated him for his supposed pride, so the other
undervalued him for his supposed unworthiness: Neither was there a third sort
wanting, who judged that it was peavishnesse, which confined him at home,
fearing lest he should be induced to spend when he came abroad: Thus he lived,
educating his children, me especially, in ordinary Learning, scorning always
those who thought knowledge rather a burden, than a qualification to those of
our sex, and that it was enough to a woman to know how to bring forth children:
for, said he, seeing nature has been more a stepmother to women, than to men,
giving them shallower judgments than to men, It appears to have been natures
meaning, and it should be their endeavors, to supply by pains that natural
imperfection: and seeing they are given as helpers to men, how can they help
him, except they understand how to do it? and also, seeing they should recreate
man in his solitariness, how can they do that without some knowledge? Having
spent thus his short life, he was at last invited by death, to go and receive
the reward of his virtue. After his death, two Gentlemen (even those two, who
first assaulted these worthy Gentlemen) whom conversation rather than affection
(for they were not capable of any such impression) had made rather comrades
than friends, and who conversed together rather out of necessity than choice,
because others hated them so as that they would not converse with them; or
else, they fearing to be checked for their escapes, would converse with none
but with themselves, whose mutual escapes pleaded for mutual pardon. These two
came in suit of us two, who were two sisters, the only daughters of our father;
but their spotted same before they came, and their imperious carriage after,
made us not only not love their persons, but even abhor their very names: which
they, after some time, perceiving, intended to extort by compulsion, what they
could not willingly obtain from us; whereupon, our only brother being sick, and
hearing that our mother resolved to consult a neighboring Astrologer, bribed
so his corrupt judgment, as that he promised to tell her, that nothing could
ransom our brothers life, but our pilgrimage to Delphus, there to sacrifice two
Turtles for him to Apollo. We, who thought nothing too dear for us, when
compared with our dear brother, resolved to undertake the journey, and being
dismissed, loaded both with our mothers tears and jewels, we had not traveled
twelve miles, waited upon only by two Gentlemen, our cousins, and two maids,
when at the entry of a Wood we were assaulted, or rather surprised, by ten
Gentlemen, masked, our cousins as soon slain as seen, and poor we, taken
captives by those of whom we knew nothing, save only that by their masks we
might know that they intended some villainy which they durst not avow; our maids
being sent away we knew not where, and our selves captives we knew not to whom,
amazement seized so on us, as that we feared we knew not what: but to screw up
our misfortunes to the highest pin, our two Lovers unmasked themselves, O what
torment was it to us, to behold our Tormentors! and especially in a place where
none could either pity, or relieve us; and we became now like fools and
children, who think it a great happiness not to see the authors of their
unhappiness, which makes them, when they are assaulted by any fear, cover
their heads; but they who hasted to enjoy that, which when they had enjoyed,
would doubtless have slighted, began to unmask their minds as well as their
faces, and told us plainly, that we behoved either to love, or die; a word as
strange as cruel: For, how can the chill coldness of constraint kindle the
real flames of true love? And seeing force is able to make those who formerly
loved, thereafter hate, how can it make those who once hated, thereafter love?
but they who understood as little true love, as they practiced true modesty,
did most impertinently importune us to accept them for our husbands, swearing,
when they could not persuade us by threats, that we were the maddest women
breathing who refused to bewives to such gallant Gentlemen, and Mistrisses of
so large fortunes; recounting to us sometime their valiant acts, and sometime
questioning their prepared servants anent the state of their thriving affairs,
not forgetting to number hundreds of Mistrisles whom they had slighted for us,
and how many sighed for them, albeit they sighed for us. This discourse, albeit
unpleasant in it self, yet seemed more unpleasant because of the discoursers
gestures and antic modes, which could have persuaded strangers, that they
erred purposly to make us laugh; at last they led us to a Cave in the bosom of
a Rock, which seemed to be Deaths chamber of presence, paved with mire, and
tapistred with slime and cobwebs: here we were welcomed by an old Hag (the
Nurse of my Lover) whose face I thought at first, had been masked with some
terrible mask, but at last I perceived, that Nature had conjoined swarthy
colors with ugly shapes, to show that Art could not outstrip her in making an
horrid face; her words, ecchoed by the hiddeous Rock, seemed to be the cries of
the damned spirits, when they are punished in Hell for their misdemeanors.

Our accommodation could only brag of its suitableness for ugly things, so
corresponded with ugly things, as ye would have sworn, that every thing
contended which should be most ugly: a sheep was eaten half alive, and sent
bleating to their bellies, and their bread which seemed to be knead gravel, was
eaten as greedily as if it had been the finest flower; at supper she began to
accuse the Courtiers for nice^y, in employing knives and napkins, and swore by
her black kirtle, that the reason why Ladies did eat so little at Table, was,
because they did eat so largely in their Chambers. Thus having spent the night
lying on the ground (a Bed never made since the Creation) we longed for the
morning, which came no sooner than we wished it had been past, and thought that
the Sun by its slow motion, intended likewayes to conspire with our other
Tormentors: Yet after some four days stay, the immortal Gods, who knew our
innocence, decreed our delivery, by a way as unexpected as the delivery it
self: for, the forenamed Mathematician, who began now in his solitude to
consult the Stars, whereas he had formerly in his poverty consulted his Purse,
did one morning acquaint the Lovers that he did read their ruin in the Face of
Heaven, if they dismissed us not: this Diurnal, from such a place, and such a
person, did so allarm their already frighted consciences, that they resolved to
quit us, merely, because they found they could not keep us: wherefore fearing
lest our return to our own Country, should be a mean to banish them from
theirs, they resolved to bring us over here to Egypt with our faces covered,
that our punishment might be the greater, and our return the more uncertain:
after that fashion did they lead us three days (never considering that Heaven
saw us, albeit we saw not it) till at last, like Serpents, who carry their
sting in their tails, they resolved to make the last act of their cruelty the
worst, making our Tragedy like all other Tragedies, whose most deplorable event
is represented in the last Scene: Wherefore, finding this Wood correspond with
their desires, they committed us to these cruel Tygres, who had avenged their
masters affronts, and ended our miseries, if the arrival of those Gentlemen had
not prevented both.

This story and their journey ended both equally, and they were as much solaced
by the one, as wearied by the other: and now they began to descry the top of
the much longed-for Castle, and being entered in a sweet Alley, which was
guarded on both sides by Walnut, Chestnut, and Cipress trees, which decored
extremely the Avenues to the Castle, they were saluted by four Gentlemen
clothed in blue Satin, who were attending Monanthropus's* return, which was
later that night than ordinary; the Knights and Ladies finding their respect
betrayed formerly, by the meannesse of Monanthropus exterior garb, did, in a
most submissive manner, crave him pardon, and bestowed upon him now, with its
interest, what respects they had ignorantly detained from him formerly, and the
younger of the two Knights (called Philarites) commissionated, by the assenting
looks of his Companions, spoke thus:

My Lord, nature having levelled all men as to what can be seen, and strangers
knowing nothing more of one another, than what instruction nature bestows on
them, their ignorance deserves pardon, if they homologate not their first
errors, by their after continuance in them* and we see Magistrates carry
before them the Ensigns of their Offices, Gentlemen followed by their Liveries,
and Knights of Orders carry the Badges of their Honors, as beacons to warn
strangers not to split upon the rocks of either disrespect, or incivility:
which shows, by the rule of contraries, that strangers may be pardoned, albeit
they deny respect to those who wear not Honors Livery; and albeit we might
have seen in your Honors face and carriage, the impression of more than
ordinary majesty, yet the confusion wherein we were, may plead our innocence.
Monanthropus, whose humor and age made him averse from ceremony, told them,
that their generous carriage did oblige him too much, and that their Apology
had prevented his; for albeit they had cunningly veiled their Births, yet their
Generosity did somewhat draw aside the curtain, and did let the most
undiscerning eye see somewhat more of Nobility, than their modesty did discover
by discourse.

The Knights and he having skirmished a little thus in complement, he entreated
the Knights to hand up stairs the weary Ladies; for their age and pains had
merited better their hand, than he had done or could do. At the top of the
stairs, they entered an Antiparlour, richly tapestred with hangings,
representing Paris choice when he bestowed the Apple upon the fairest (which
seemed to be not only a relation of what was past, but also a prophecy of what
was to be acted shortly upon that stage) there they were welcomed by a Lady,
rather grave than old, followed by a troup of rare Beauties; where
(notwithstanding the rest seemed only to be black patches to set off with the
greater advantage the beauty of a young Lady who was Monanthropus his daughter,
a Lady so accomplished, as if Nature in her, had like that old Painter,
borrowed a tra^te from the greatest Beauties in the world to adorn one)
Philarites, after Megistus and the Ladies had saluted all, and after as he
himself had saluted the mother, coming to salute the daughter, and bowing as
low as the verge of her garment, being deserted by strength, and overpowered by
admiration, did Fali dead at her feet. The wounded Ladies, surprised by his
fall, did shout, and by that shout astonished more than formerly, the already
commiserating bystanders, who began already to sacrifice thousands of tears to
his departed ghost, and were sending their sad cries to accompany to the
Elisian fields his lovely soul; mean while, his admiration which had intimated
to his internal blood and spirits the admirable beauty of ARETINA (so was the
young Lady called) sent his blood gushing out at his veins, every drop striving
with its fellow which should first see that hyerogliphick of comeliness; but
he, poor Gentleman, lay as if his soul and body had been divorced in the Court
of Heaven, for it refused to return to its old lodging, notwithstanding of the
many invitations given it, both by the skill of the Physician, and care of the
Ladies: at last some blushes began to appear as the avantcurriers of life,
which did somewhat animate the company, whose faces reflected formerly the
paleness that appeared in his, each being willing even to wear deaths livery
for his sake; at last he began by groans, to vomit up his Melancholy, and to
stretch his arms, which when Megistus perceived, he caused carry him to his
chamber, where they put him in bed, not fully yet recovered. Thereafter
Monanthropus and his Lady waited first upon the unknown Ladies, and thereafter
upon Megistus to their Chambers, where Supper was dressed up for them, and two
maids were allowed the Ladies for attendants: but Megistus, fearing that
Philarites grief might prove desperate, (great Spirits producing nothing which
is not great, and as the greatest fires have the greatest flames) resolved, by
his wit to assist his friends patience; wherefore calling for Kalodulus his
servant, he commanded him to convey himself secretly up to the Seiling of the
Chamber, and to take a hollow tree with him, through which he should (after he
found Philarites awake, and beginning to complain) cry with a counterfeit
voice, Philarites, the gods, as a reward of thy virtue, have allowed thee
ARETINA for thy Wife; and, to confirm thee in this truth, have desired thee to
send to morrow to that great Oak, which is sacred to Jupiter, and there thou
shall find a Ring, with this inscription, Believe the Gods (for Megistus had
gotten such a Ring from one of his fathers Magicians, who had foretold him many
fortunat events, and at his departure had bestowed this Ring upon him)
Kalodulus, whose love to Philarites made him both willing to undertake, and
cunning in the accomplishment, of this enterprise, did secretly climb up where
he was desired, and where he could not be discovered because of the darkness of
the night; and after half an hours stay, Philarites began to groan, and to
second his groans thus: O unfortunate Philarites! has passion cut the throat
of thy reason, or have thou lost thy wit with thy blood? will thou willingly
enter the lists, where stronger spirits have been defeated by weaker enemies,
than that lovely object thou saw this evening? will thou render thy self
incapable to be Megistus friend, and thy fathers heir, for a fancy which is
unpracticable? Yea, which is more, Will thou derogate from that Ladies worth,
by daring to style thy self her Lover? Either thou must conceal thy passion,
and then why love thou? else thou must vent it, and then declare thy self
distracted. Kalodulus, who waited this opportunity, spoke as he was taught, and
that so cunningly, as that Kalodulus passed really for Mercury (the trunche-man
of the Gods) in Philarites conceit: whereupon, falling in an ecstasy of respect
to the Gods, and of joy for the message, he gave Kalodulus leisure to retire
himself to his bed, where feigning that he was asleep, Philarites called for
him, asking if he heard any thing? who answered, No, sure, for he was asleep:
but the other pressing an answer, Kalodulus said, that it was only the effects
of his distemper. The night being past, Philarites entreated Kalodulus, to go
and dig under the root of the sacred Oak, to see what he could find. But
Kalodulus, after some faint disswasion, was at last willing to go: where having
gone, he seemed to dig, and at last found the Ring (which he could not miss,
seeing it was in his pocket) with which he returned to his master, telling him,
to aggrage the matter, that he found it wrapped up in an Oaken Leaf. This trick
of Leg^rdemain was proven by Philarites, his hope to be a vision, and did so
animate him, that he was in greater danger to have died for joy now, than he
was to have died for grief formerly, like a Lamp extinguished by too much Oil,
the soul in that resembling the body, which is soonest surfeted by the best of
viands.

Whilst they were canvassing this strange business, Megistus (who being
anxious of the event, had risen timously) knocked at the door, and being
entered, he began to enquire how he had rested. Philarites commanding Kalodulus
to retire, embracing Megistus, said, Dear Comrade, since the soul of two
friends seems to be but one soul bilocated, and lodged in two bodies, which is
notwithstanding, not a whit the less one soul, no more than the same soul
cease to be the same, because it is altogether in the arms, altogether in the
head, and in other distinct members: seeing then we are animated by the same
soul (whereof yours is the nobler part) how can, or why should, we be strangers
to one another joys or griefs? My ecstasy yesternight told you all I can tell
you this morning; but albeit it had concealed it, yet I would not. Ye saw how
ARETINA'S face disarmed my courage, and forced me to render before I could put
my self in a posture of defense; I am love and hers martyr, at which word he
trembled. Megistus, who resolved to solace his friends Melancholy, answered: It
cannot be you love; for else loves flames would never suffer you to tremble,
which is the ordinary effect of cold.

Alas, said Philarites, seeing none can behold ARETINA, and not love her, I fear
we are Rivals. Truly, replied Megistus, I love her also; but the difference is,
that it appears ye love her as your Mistress, and I love her as a complete Lady;
and albeit I loved her as my Mistress, yet the love I carried to her would
strike sail to the respect I bear to Philarites. Alas, said Philarites, the
first part of your discourse makes me think, that you have not remarked
ARETINA, and the second part makes me think, that ye who knows every thing
else, knows not what it is to love. No, no, replied Megistus, as my eyes cannot
be so far mistaken, as to mistake the Case for the Watch, so neither can my
judgment be so hallucinated as to love the Body in stead of the Soul: it is
not beauty that I admire either in her or you (albeit both be lovely) no, it is
your virtue, which seeing I know to be real in you, whereas it is but
presumptive in her, I cannot choose but love you better: But, Philarites, ye
jest, when ye say ye love; can it be that your courage, which has resisted so
many men, is not able to resist one woman? stain not your wisdom by loving,
before ye know the object to be lovely: stain not your birth, by loving a
subject, ye who are born a Prince; stain not your duty, by choosing a Wife
before you consult your Father, take a Wife from his hands from whom ye have
received every thing else: for, it is not just that he should not choose her,
who is to be Princess of his Kingdoms, and Mother to his Heirs; and seeing by
the Law of Nations an Heir cannot marry without the Superiors consent, why
should it be lawful to you to marry without the consent of your Father, who
being your Prince, is your Superior.

Philarites was about to answer, but was interrupted by Monanthropus, his Lady,
and his Daughter, who were entering the Chamber; Salutations being mutually
exchanged, and the Ladies seated, Megistus craved the Lady pardon for their
yesternights trouble: for, said he, Madam, if your modest looks, and the
experience we have of your civilities, made us not expect that your goodness
would seal us a pardon, we might think our selves as unfortunate, as now we
have reason to extol our good fortune, which has given us your Ladish. to be
our physician, and your house to be our hospital; the gods, whose service ye
respect principally, must be your paymasters: and as for us, all we can do, is
to employ in your service all that remnant of blood which ye have conserved in
our veins. Sir, replied the noble Lady, the protection of these noble Ladies is
a debt which all our sex is not able to requite, and it were an unpardonable
sin against the immortal gods, to abandon two Gentlemen, whom they look upon as
their Minions; Gentlemen, pardon ye your bad entertainment, and your
complementary guilt shall be easily pardoned. Having thus ended, she asked how
Philarites rested, and what he needed? But Megistus fearing lest ARETINA'S
presence should reinflame him, and knowing that they who were in fevers should
not sit so near the fire, entreated the Ladies and Monanthropus to leave him to
the care of Doctor Diet, and Doctor Quiet, healths ordinary Physicians, which
they did, and went away, accompanied by Megistus, to visit the unknown Ladies;
where they found them, entertaining themselves with two Lutes, lent them by
their attenders: their Lutes and their Voices strove for preference, yet the
Voice carried the applause; and no wonder, seeing it is the instrument which the
gods themselves have fabricated. Their music joined to the description
Monanthrop. had made of them to his Lady and Daughter, did so indear the Ladies
to them as that still thereafter during their abode it was hard to separate
them, Monanthropus desiring to satisfy his curiosity, and curious to know a
person he so much admired, desired Megistus to fetch a walk, leaving the Ladies
to their private entertainments.

So going abroad, he conducted him to a Garden, all enamelled with Flowers,
chequered all along according to their several colors; and thereafter to an
Aviary, wherein grew many fragrant odoriferous Trees, wherein Birds of all
Nations, and of all colors, nested, and withal shadowed a Walk, wherein one
would hear their dissonant voices conspiring to make one melodious harmony,
which seemed to be Natures Lute, and which showed how hard it is for Art to
imitate Dame Natures perfection; here Monanthropus used every morning and
evening to recreate both his ears and eyes, with variety both of notes and
colors, contrariety here producing as pleasant effects, as it uses to produce
unpleasant elsewhere: from this they went to a Mount, whose ascent was
facilitated by stairs of Marble, and whose stairs was shaded with Orange trees,
budding continually, betwixt each two whereof stood a Basin of Marble, whence
issued waters of diverse colors, receiving their tinctures from Minerals,
purposly concealed; upon the top of this Mount stood a house of pleasure,
gilded above, and all struck out in windows, the residue of the wall being
strong Cristal, whose reflections upon the gilding, did cast a curious luster;
there stood a pair of Organs, moved with a Water-work, with which three cages
of Birds, made a melodious consort; above this was a Closet, repleat with
Mathematical Engines, whence Monanthropus observed all the heavenly motions:
thence they were called to Dinner, where at the entry of the Palace they
perceived a young Pedant, who was seating a Lady on horsback, and would needs
have the Gentleman who was in the saddle turn the right side of the horse; for,
said he, the noblest side should be given to a Lady: but so it is that the
right side is the noblest, Ergo. This forced Monanthropus against his
inclination to laugh merrily.

After Dinner, Monanthropus and Megistus walked to the Bibliothick, which was
richly tapestred with Books, each Science having its own division, and the
chief Authors, drawn by a most exquisite Pencil, standing above; the floor
paved with Marble, cut out in the shapes of Globes and Spheres: They had scarce
fetched two or three turns here, when Monanthropus (whose Melancholy hungered to
be fed with the Legend of Megistus Life) smiling, said; Sir, it is somewhat
unmannerly, yet most ordinary, amongst strangers to inquire after one another
extraction, and the more it is concealed, the more our curiosity is set on
edge; men thinking every thing that is hid, like to the hidden Minerals, which
the deeper they are concealed in the bowels of the Earth, are so much the more
precious; and man hunting happiness (a prey which he shall never catch in this
world) and not finding it in what he knows, concludes that it lurks in that
which is concealed from him; and man concluding that each desires to reserve
for himself what he finds most excellent, imagines that every thing which his
neighbor conceals, must be excellent, because he reserves that for himself;
others enquire after men's secrets, because they dream, that once having known
another secrets, they have the revealer at their devotion; Yet, Sir, I hope,
that as your generosity will not jealouse me, so your goodness will satisfy
my enquiry. Megistus who found it an obligation he owed to Monanthropus's
civilities, replied thus: My Lord, albeit my reason did at first, and my
experience has since, taught me the expediency of masking my condition, yet
your favors have prevailed against both; wherefore, Sir, ye shall know that I
am Son to the King of Ethiopia, and that whilst I lived at my Fathers Court, I
began to reflect upon the great advantages that did accrue to Princes by their
travels; for these are the mirrours wherein Princes may see their own
blemishes, which their own subjects may sometimes laugh at, but will never
discover to them: as also the want of foreign languages (which they learn in
their travels) obliges them to reveal to Interpreters the most mysterious
affairs of State, when they treat with strangers Ambassadors, and makes them
unfit to pry into their scope; likewise their travels acquaints them with the
humors and interests of other Nations, wherein homebred Princes are sometimes
cheated, and often mistaken; by these Princes are obliged to moderate their
passions, to inure themselves to hardship, and to converse with men of all
conditions: Another advantage they have likewise, which is, that by traveling
whilst they are young, they conceal many imperfections, which, to their great
loss, their youth would have discovered, if they had lived at home. These and
many such considerations, prompted me to travel, and to disguise my name and
birth, which, as it forced me to spend less, so it capacitated me to learn
more than else I could have done. So having come over to Athens, the general
rendezvous of all great Spirits, I did there meet Philarites, whose fame and
excellent qualities made me cull him out for my intimate Comrade: but, Sir, I
will reserve this story for his own narration, that so he may have somewhat to
gratify your Lordship with, his and my condition having robbed us of all other
opportunities of doing your Lordship the least pleasure. Monanthropus glad of
this discovery, but sorry for his former mistake, did entreat Megistus to
remember the Apology he had made the other day, whereat Megistus smiling,
said, That all the reparation of honor which he required, was his Lordships
secrecy in a matter of such importance, and that he desired likewise, rather
out of custom than out of fear, and desired that his Lordsh. should not think
it detracted from the confidence he placed on his ingenuity, seeing the most
entire, and the least jealous friends will desire the like, merely to signify
that they look upon what is related as a thing wherein they desire secrecy,
which their friends would else take for matters of no such moment; and withal
he entreated, That his Lordship would acquaint him with the true state of
affairs, as they stood for the time in that Nation wherein he now sojourned,
Seeing Intelligence was the soul of Policy, by which it was animated, and
without which Statesmen could neither foresee nor shun inconveniences; and of
all intelligence that was to be preferred, which was had by one who had been an
actor, as his Lordship was; To which Monanthropus courteously replied, Your
Highness (which title Megistus conjured him not to make use of, lest by it he
should be deciphered) by your command compells me to do what none but ye could
gain from me, for that discourse will reflect upon and detract from my native
country, of whose honor I would be as tender as of my Mothers (for seeing I am
come out of its bowels, I do in a manner esteem it my Mother) as also my
narration may seem to receive a false tincture from my coffeehouse, neither
is it fit to make such relations to strangers, who may glean from it some of
the hidden Maxims of our State, the concealment of which would make the
discourse seem empty, and would leave you, Sir, (seeing I must term you so) most
unsatisfied; yet seeing that same providence which has sent you thither,
persuades me that it has singled you out, as a Physician to cure our maladies,
I shall conceal none of our infirmities from you. Wherefore, Sir, ye shall
know, that this Kingdom, (which is one of the first Lodgings given to poor
mortals by the immortal gods) was governed always by Kings, and to abridge my
story (leaving to history what may be learned from it) Plistus, father to our
present Monarch, was a good, but a simple Prince, whereof his Nobles taking
advantage, sought to settle the Government really in their persons, that they
might employ the public treasure, to repair the breaches which their profuse
luxury had made in their private fortunes, and the power and honor of the
State to satiate their unsatiable ambition: whereupon, first, six, and then more,
combined amongst themselves, and against their Prince, which Plistus, simple in
other things, but witty in this, perceiving, became almost distracted with
fear, yet providence diverted that blow, which doubtless else had murdered
both him and his Kingdom; for Mal^hus the Mufty (for so they call our
High Priest) convocating all the Priests (whose number the laziness and
superstition of our Nation has made infinite) to a solemn Assembly, went and
secretly proffered his service and assistance to his Prince, whose hatred to
the Nobles, and whose fear of the event, had made him willing, not only to
accept, but even to desire the aid of his subjects; the King having first
thanked, and then condescended to embrace his proffer, they plotted the
extirpation of the complotting Noblemen, which was thus acted: The Noblemen and
the Priests meeting in Alexandria about the same time, Malchus having taken an
oath both of secrecy and obedience from all of them, unfolded to them the
complot of the Noblemen, and how the King had none to confide in besides them,
whose courage might make in one instant, their Country and their King
eternally happy; he likewise showed them proof of the Noblemens treason, and of
the Kings pleasure: Whereupon, all assenting, he went by way of procession,
carrying the Image of Apollo straight to the Lodging where the Noblemen were
assembled, where having seized upon them, and upon their papers, which had been
shown him by one of their Secretaries, whom he had bribed, he was presently
rescued by the King, who commanded the flocking people to retire home: The King
in requital of this courtesy, advanced presently Malchus to be Chancellor of
the Nation, wherein at first he evidenced both so much wit and moderation, as
that the gods themselves seemed to be his cabinet counsel; yet at last his
ambition, which he had all this time kept chained by prudence, did at last
break prison, and he treated privately with some of the imprisoned Nobles, to
ransom themselves by marrying his Neeces, which they willingly accorded to; he
likewise persuaded the King that it would blunt extremely the edge of the
peoples envy, and would strengthen extremely the Kingdom, whose noble parts
the Nobles were, and consequently whose weakness would weaken the body; and
that wise Kings should be like wise Physicians, who should never cut off a
diseased member, if there be any hopes to cure it; he sent abroad upon foreign
employments all the active Spirits, fomented all the old jealousies, and
created new betwixt the Nobles, so that the King by curing himself of one
disease (as it happens in the usage of all nimious and vehement cures) fell in
another, as (if not more) dangerous, Malchus, finding that one of his own
countrymen was unfit to be his Minion and Successor after his death, did choose
one Sophander a Grecian (who had been resident at the Court for the Athenian
Senate) to be his Favorite: for, he imagined that if he had chosen a Nobleman
of his own Nation, he might have supplanted him; and if he had chosen a base
and low-born Gentleman, his extraction being notorious to all the Nation, might
have rendered him despicable; and a stranger uncertain of any assistance,
behoved to rely upon him: besides, wanting both friends and foes in the Nation,
he would impartially without either connivance or revenge, execute all his
commands. This fellow, became his creature (and he might well be called so,
because he made him of nothing a potent prince) others alleged, that because
the people did belch out so many injuries against Malchus for his avarice
(making his private chests the public treasure) saying, that he was in the
politic body, like the spleen in the natural, whose growth did proportionally
occasion the leanness of the other members: therefore he choosed this
Sophander (whose avarice was his greatest, if not his only vice) that they
might after his death by collationing their lives, extol his ambition by
comparing it with his successors avarice.

Now all the Court began to adore Malchus in Sophanders person, each one
foreseeing that any imp, ingrafted on such a root, would one day flourish
extremely, and that its shadow should one day be able to shelter those who
retired under it, from either the cold chillness of poverty, or the scorching
flames of envy; yea, the King himself caressed exceedingly this Infant Minion,
but so cautiously as that he seemed rather to love him in obedience to Malchus
his desire, than out of any secret inclination to Sophander, or aversion from
Malchus, albeit these two passions were really the legs whereon his passion did
walk. Thus Malchus did by the hand of his pleasure sway the Sceptor of
Soveraignity, his fancy being the sole and supreme Judge, even in matters of
the greatest importance, from whose sentence the Royal Throne it self durst
receive no appeal, and whose smiles were the greatest reward that the proudest
Egyptian durst pretend to; the office of Chancellor became too narrow an orb
for this great Planet to move in: wherefore, as an extraordinary person, he
must have an extraordinary employment, and must be advanced to be first
Minister of State, a title not understood by us, and never heard of by our
Ancestors, but which suited well with his ambition, both being boundless. None
durst now dispute his power, seeing none could pretend to know it; and seeing the
King himself was, who could repine against the condition of a subject? Nothing
was presented to him now, but what was confected with the sugar of flattery:
not a word dropped from his mouth, but was instantly received in Fames most
sacred vessels; and the most erroneous of his actions, were canonized as
example for posterity; Yet fear (the ordinary Lacquey of greatness) began to
tell his conscience in the ear, that he was rather adored than loved, by those
who even loved him best, which made him resolve by the news of his death, to
try whether it was love or fear that made the humors of his Compatriots so
pliable; in order to this design, feigning himself first sick, and then blazing
abroad his death by the mouth of his Physicians, did by the dissembled closure
of his eyes, open the fond mouths of the unwary Courtiers, who were glad to
find an occasion to vomit up that poisonous malice, which had even by its venom
almost destroyed the vessels wherein it was kept; but the next morning the
Physicians told that his soul had but lurked in, and not fled from his
apoplectick body, and he himself being recovered, did deal death most liberally
amongst those who were so liberal of their characters of him, whilst they
supposed that he was dead. Yet at last death did show, that the armor of
greatness was not proof against its darts, and did hurry him away, cursed by
all, and lamented by none, the people supposing they had buried him and their
miseries in one tomb, did now coin thousands of hopes in the mint-house of
their expectation; but their miseries which had begun to ebb by Malchus death,
did now begin to flow afresh by the Succession of Sophander, whom the Queen
(fearing that the Nobles who did not obey him who was both their Countryman and
their Prince, would far less obey her, whose reign was but temporary, and
whose sex was but fragile) did after the death of her husband, who survived not
long Malchus, choose him for her Confident. The young Kings name served them
for a rampart against all opposition, and his infancy made the uproars of her
enemies be looked upon as a sin greater than Treason, being committed both
against the Majesty of a King and the Infancy of a Child, and rendered them
criminal both as men, and subjects. Yet this same innocence which made the
opposers so guilty, did likewise give time and life to the far more heinous
crimes of the defendants. Sophander having got the Tutory of the young King,
acquainted him with all the pleasures which might alienate his mind from
affairs of greater importance, but kept him always a stranger to the
Mysteries of State, as things which would certainly disquiet, and might
possibly break his spirit: telling him, that it was too soon for him to have
his Crown lined with the black Sables of Care, and that he might in his youth
commit some Solicismes of State, which might for ever stain his Royal repute:
he likewise retarded his Marriage, fearing lest another worthiness should fill
the room, which he unworthily had gotten in his Princes heart; till at last,
overpowered by necessity, he matched him with a neighboring Princess, whose
pliable humor might rather be subservient than destructive to his greatness, I
(who had been promoted to be Chancellor immediately after Malchus death) became
now the eyesore of Sophanders avarice, for he thought my charge void, because
it was not filled with one of his Partisans, who might at last like small
rivers discharge themselves in the ocean of his Treasures: whereupon I, who
scorned like those other Asses, to carry Gold to his bottomless Coffers, did
resolve rather to shelter my self in the Sanctuary of a private life, than to
bow the top-sail of my integrity to the flag of his ambition; wherefore I
retired to this place and condition, which I have always since found a harbor
able to shelter me from the most violent storms of pride and avarice, wherewith
those are shattered, who sail in the ocean of Court-luxury. This discourse did
extremely satisfy Megistus judgment, and kindle his courage, and Monanthropus
perceiving the coals of his courage once kindled, did by the bellows of wit and
occasion, endeavor to add heat to excite the flames which he found already
kindled; and it was resolved at last that Eudoxa the elder of these two Ladies
should go to Alexandria, where she should stay till by Bonaria's intercession
(so was Monanthropus Lady called) she might be admitted to be one of Agapeta
(the Kings daughters) Ladies of honor, where she might be serviceable to their
designs, and a stirrup whereby Megistus might the more easily mount the saddle
of preferment.

Let us now return to visit Philarites, whose love had plunged him in the ditch
of Melancholy irrecoverably, who loved nothing in himself except the love he
carried to ARETINA, whose good fortune he notwithstanding cursed a thousand
times, because it had placed her above the reach of his courtesies, the
skillful pencile of his passion did draw ARETINA'S portracture upon every
object that presented it self to his sight; and his noble heart, which was
formerly Mars his shop wherein he forged thousands of heroic thoughts, became
now an Altar whereon he sacrificed daily his dearest faculties to his lovely
ARETINA, his Reason, which had still been the steersman in all his former
courses, did in this tempest of Melancholy abandon its charge, presumption
assured him, that providence and foresight in this case, were but
cowardishness; for, how could one of his courage, especially engaged in such a
quarrel, fear Armies of inconveniences? On the contrary, fear assured him that
his hopes were mere presumption; for, how could the divine ARETINA be merited
by a stranger, destitute of friends and attenders? and how could he think that
she who knew the value of every thing, would bestow her self upon one who did
not merit her? Thus passion warred against passion, but all of them conspired
against Philarites, who, deserted by reason, and assaulted by passion, was
brought to so low a pass, as that neither the skill of the Physician was able
to recruit his body, nor the persuasions of Megistus able to settle his
confused spirits. But that which afflicted him most, was, that occasion never
propined him with an opportunity of meeting with ARETINA all alone, till at
last occasion repenting of the severity it had used against him, brought at
last Bonaria and ARETINA to his Chamber, whom charity had invited thither to
assist by their skill and care his natural strength, which was not able for to
combat all alone these troops of diseases which did daily attaque him.
Bonaria, being instantly called away, left a fair field for his passion to
expatiate it self in Philarites, who intended to be very frugal of his time,
insisted thus.

Divine ARETINA, the least sparkle of your acquaintance is able not only to
thaw the ice of indifferency, but even to kindle the flames of love in a colder
breast than mine. But, Madam, the great disproportion betwixt your merit and my
naughtiness, obliges me to smother my affection, and yet I know that in
smothering it, I shall murder a person who might otherwise live to do you
service: My death shall be honorable, if I be not buried in the tomb of your
disdain, and yet my life (being employed in your service) might bud forth in
something worthy of your and the worlds noticing: but as for me, I esteem it
not, if I receive it not as a donative from your clemency. Fair Lady, I shall
always esteem my self more or less fortunate, accordingly as ye frown or
smile upon me, and your thoughts are the only stars whereby my horoscope may be
casten. He stopped here, perceiving that ARETINA had covered her face with a
blush, and fearing to offend her whom he so much adored, he patiently waited
for this Answer.

Noble Philarites, I know that such Gallants as you, use, like skillful
Comedians, to act still at home those personages which they are to represent
publicly upon the stage; wherefore I am confident that ye are inuring your
self with such a Country-maid as I am, to those Civilities and Court-modes,
which the Ladies at Courts will expect from you, I know your wit sports it self
by such genty recreations; and seeing it may accomplish your spirit, I pardon
you f^eely. She spoke this with so charming a grace, and with so much
indifferency, as that neither Philarites fear, or hope, were able to glean any
thing from it; at last, rising to bid him adieu, she let a Scarlet Ribband
fall, which Philarites secretly (fearing to be perceived, and being perceived
to be frustrated) snatched up immediately, and kept always afterward as the
Paladium of his good fortune. After two or three weeks were thus spent,
Philarites came abroad, rather seeking an opportunity to entertain ARETINA,
than out of a desire to meliorat his health, and whilst they were walking
after Dinner in the next adjacent Garden, where all the Knights and Ladies had
gone to seek the Arbours protection against the heat of the Sun, they perceived
a Gentleman, who in all humility presented Monanthropus with Letters from
Sophander, entreating his Lady and Daughters presence at his Neeces Nuptials,
who was to be espoused to the Prince of Goshan. Monanthropus alleged
indisposition of health for himself, but promised that his Lady and daughter
should wait upon his Eminence, and his Niece. Telling him that he was sorry
that the distance was not greater, and the Solemnity less, that their
obedience to his Eminencies commands might the better appear. The Gentleman
told him, that seeing that Complement could hardly be requited by Sophander
himself, it were vanity in him to endeavor an answer.

The next morning the Ladies, accompanied by the unknown Knights, did by Coach
begin their journey to Alexandria, and it was almost hard to tell, whether
Megistus grief in leaving Monanthropus, or Philarites joy in accompanying
ARETINA was greatest. The day being fair at their departure, continued not long
so, for the Heavens willing to cause the Earth drink healths to their
bon-voyage, did by impetuous showers send it water enough to drink: the Sky,
which intended to look cheerfully at Eliza's Nuptials, did by wind and rain
purge it self of all its malignant humors; Heavens bottles having at last
emptied themselves by these furious showers, the Sky did cover its face by a
vail of mist, whereby the Coachmans horizon was abridged to the length of two
or three paces at most, Providence intending by the hand of this darkness, to
lead them out of that natural darkness wherein their ignorance had enveloped
them; and now the Coachman did fly fast from the angry face of Heaven, but the
faster he drove the m^re he strayed; which he never perceived, till time had
dissipated the mist, and then both he, and the other attenders, found
themselves in a Forest, where they saw no path nor person to direct them what
rout to take: at last the Ladies and Knights, who were walking on foot,
(Megistus birth having allowed him Bonaria's hand, leaving ARETINA to now happy
Philarites) they perceived an old Hermit, who appeared to have borrowed times
beard to cover his wrinkled face and naked breast, who did accost them thus*
Ladies, it appears that rather error than intention, has drawn you hither.
The Ladies granted it was so, but told him that they thought themselves most
fortunate, in having erred, seeing their error had occasioned such a remarkable
rancounter, wherefore they entreated to know his aboade, and the occasion of
his solitude.

I am, said he, an Hebrew, who have refuged my self from being a sad witness of
the deplorable condition of my Country, whose miseries are mine by adoption. I
live here in a Rock, wherein there is nothing worthy of observation. The Ladies
entreated they might see it; for, sure (said they) there is nothing worthy of
your choice which is not worthy of our observation. Seeing their eagerness, and
coveting an opportunity to confer with him, he conducted them to a Rock,
elevate somewhat above the circumjacent Valley: where Nature had been the only
Architecture, yet so handsomely arched and pended, that it might have passed for
one of Arts Masterpieces; within there stood a Table, whereon were some old
Volumns, and some of his own Manuscripts; over it hung some Walnut and
Fig Trees, which were his only granaries, and which reached him his food in at
his window: two steps below the entry without, was a spring of crystal water;
where the Rock seemed to gush out tears because it could not afford him better
liquor: the neighboring trees seemed to lay their heads together, to skreen
his open windows from the scorching heat, and the weary Wilderness seemed by
his dwelling there, to be an house of pleasure. When they were entered and had
seated themselves to recreate their weariness, and admire his garb and
gravity, he began to usher his discourse by some tears (by whose continual
streams it appeared he had formerly whitened his snow-white beard) he seconded
his tears with this ensuing discourse, in obedience to the Ladies, who desired
to be satisfied anent the occasion of his solitude.

Madam, The omnipotent and omniscient God (for I acknowledge but one; for, if
there be any God, he must be infinite, and if infinite, he must be one; for,
there cannot be more infinites than one: for else, the one is not infinite,
seeing he wants the perfections of his fellows, and so something may be added
to his perfection. And the diversity of your gods, shows not the plurality of
the gods, but denotes only the diversity of the true God his Attributes: for,
he is wife, and his wisdom is represented by your Apollo; He is most
irresistible, which is figured to you by your god Mars, etc.) I say, the
omnipotent God has created innumerable creatures, whose greatest use is merely
to show the power of their Creator; and in every creature there is a mass of
mysteries, and each of them is a Volumn too large to be read during a man's
whole life: wherefore seeing the Court and Conversation seals that Book, and
trifles away the time, I should and might bestow upon it, I resolved to divorce
my self from these adulterating employments, and retire my self to solitude,
which is a hall, wherein through the prospect of meditation, a man may see a
complete muster of all God's creatures; and seeing it affords a man
opportunities to converse with the eternal God, I think it much preferable to
the world wherein ye converse most (if not only) with poor mortals, from whom
nothing is to be learned, and with whom much may be lost; as also the loud
cries of worldly pleasures will not suffer a man to hear the language of an
offended conscience; and the world being sins element, sins seem not heavy
whilst one is there, no more than the above-running waters burdens the
swimming fishes: There men are affrighted by poverty, and distracted by
ambition (which albeit it be always mounting, yet shall never climb to Heaven)
every Age seems a season wherein grows a distinct crop of Vices; in infancy,
ignorance; in youth, love and vanity; in middle-age, ambition, revenge, and
prodigality; in old age, jealousy, dotage, and avarice: yea, the virtues
themselves which are to be found there, cannot stand upon their own legs,
except they be underpropped by some vice or other; If one love his friend, he
will think nothing sin which may gratify him, and another must maintain his
liberality by the oppression of his subjects and servants. But these vices will
not lodge with those who lodge in Wildernesses, because they find themselves
starved by the indigency of their Landlords, and barrenness of the soil.

But, Madam, these two Skulls, which lie upon my Table (the one whereof is that
of Alexanders, and the other Plato's) albeit they be dumb to others, yet they
preach to me the vanity of all things under the Sun, and as skillful
Anatomists, discover to me the silliness of crawling man; their Skuls shown so
appositly, did wring tears from the eyes of the beholders, neither did the
Hermit now weep alone, and his tears seemed to be like a little water employed
by the Mariners to pump up a far greater quantity. Only Philarites (whose
breast was so repleat with other meditations, that there was no room left for
such celestial contemplations) did shed only some few, merely to accompany
those which came in rivers from ARETINA'S eyes. Whilst they were thus drowning
the Hermites Cave with their plentiful tears, the rude Coachman told them,
that albeit they were staying there, yet the Sun would not stay for them, and
therefore entreated their have. At which the Ladies starting up, they were by
the Hermit conducted to their Coach, whence showing them the way to Alexandria
he returned, promising to sacrifice hundreds of prayers for their erring souls.
When he was gone, Philarites beholding ARETINA, said, he thought her fair face,
mantled with such incomparable colors and charms, did speak as loudly man's
excellency, as the ugliest of those skuls spoke his infirmity. Alas, said
Bonaria, forty years hence the disproportion will not be great, when all these
colors shall be hidden in the wrinkles of an old face, and when the frost of
age shall have nipped all these flourishes, and the cold wind of time shall
have blown away these blossoms which now appear. Certainly, said Philarites,
the soul must be an excellent creature, which, as the Sun, produces imaginary
colors in optic prismes and doves necks, so it in a more noble way does
produce really those admirable colors which appears in that and other
excellent faces; neither can it be thought a disparagement to the soul, that it
suffers these to fade in age, seeing in exchange of these it bestows upon
the body then the real advantages of prudence and experience; which cannot be
said to be the least worth, because they are the least beautiful: no more than
the Autumn can be called the worst season, because in lieu of the Springs
flourishes, it bestows upon us the real fruits which have been knotted in it:
and, no doubt, the soul must be a noble Artist, which makes all these veins,
muscles, nerves, and noble parts of man's body move so regularly, whose number
and varity, albeit they show the excellency of our fabric, yet do infallibly
occasion our weakness; for any one of these many parts can lodge death with
all its train: and the finger, or toe, albeit they are most of all others,
remote from the heart, yet can they deliver up that citadel of life, the heart,
into the hands of death its mortal enemy. Sure, said ARETINA, seeing the body is
in it self so frail, they are much to blame who are so enamoured with these
colors which are so fading. I am confident, replied Philarites, that none is
so mad as to become enamoured of the body in any other sense, but merely as it
is the shell wherein such a rare pearl as the soul is kept, and as many love
the son, because he is son to such a father; even so many love these colors,
and that vivacity whereof it can only brag, as they are the effects of the
within residing soul; and to confirm us in this, we may conceive that no man is
so distracted, as to love that which cannot requite his love nor be sensible of
it, and consequently seeing it is not the body which is sensible, or which
requites love, we may conclude that it is not the body, but the soul, which men
dote so much upon (if true virtue may be called dotage) and both history and
experience tells us, that men have continued to love those whose beauty had
thereafter been murdered by accidents. Philarites was by this discourse so
lulled over in an ecstasy of pleasure, as that he became insensible what
pleasure was; or, as it happens in all other pleasures, the fear of its short
continuance, made him dissatisfied with the present enjoyment; and albeit he
called often to the Coachman to drive slowly, alleging that the nimious motion
of the Coach troubled the Ladies delicate complexions, yet in spite of his
wishes, and of the bribed Coachmans obedience, they arrived at Alexandria
sooner than either he wished or expected. The Ladies retired to their own
Lodgings, which were still furnished, expecting them, but the Knights lodged as
near as convenience could suffer them. After Supper came Eudoxa, masked, to
wait upon the Ladies (for she had been now a fortnight at Court) and acquainted
them how all things went there.

The next morning the Knights went to wait upon Sophander, and finding his
Secretary in the outer Court, they entreated him to show his Eminency that
there were two strangers who desired to kiss his hands. Sophander concluding
that either they had some notable business to impart to him, or else, that
they were men of extraordinary extracts or endowments (which is the happy lot
of all confident persons) else they durst not so confidently address themselves
to one of his quality and humor, desired they might advance. Philarites, after
mutual salutations, harrangued him after this manner.

Eminent Sir, Fame, who in obedience to the gods decree, has trumpeted your
praises in all Nations, especially in ours; has invited* us to come and serve
the Apprentisage of our youth, under the eye of such an expert Artist in all
humane policy, as your Eminency is; wherefore, Sir, seeing ye are the tutelary
Angel of all other strangers, we expect a share in your protection as well as
others, and our lives shall still be stages, whereon we shall act the
personages of your humble servants.

Sophander, who had by their equipage persuaded himself of their extraordinary
birth, and by their discourse did discover the promptness of their spirits,
did caress them as persons capable and worthy of the highest Employments, and
proffered not only his protection, but even his service to them. The Knights
entreated that he might path a way for them to the Kings presence, and that
their first appearance might be under his conduct; which he soon accorded to,
desiring them to accompany him, who was then going to salute his Majesty, and
to go a hunting with him. Sophander asked their names and extractions; but they
craved him pardon for their disobedience in that particular, seeing their
disobedience might capacitate them the more to do his Eminency service; they
went thus discoursing till they entered a Garden where the King was, seeing his
Huntsman prepare all things for his Majesty's sport. At Sophander's entrance,
each strove who might appear most submissive, and a stranger would scarce have
known which of the two was the King; and Nature seemed to have given each
Courtier two eyes, that he might by them observe both their motions, and two
ears, to receive both their commands. Sophander presented the two Knights to
his Majesty, whose noble deportments, albeit they had not been presented by
Sophander, and whose being presented by him, albeit they had not been of so
majestic a deportment, was sufficient to recommend them highly to the Kings
eye, but both being joined, made him confer double respect upon them. Megistus
seemed the more martial, but Philarites the more courtly, yet so, as that
neither Megistus warlikeness wanted courtiness, nor Philarites courtiness
somewhat of a martial behavior; and as, if Philarites had not been present,
Megistus would have seemed the most courtly Gentleman that eye could have looked
upon; so, if Megistus had not been present, (...) would have thought Philarites
the most warlike Gallant that Nature could have framed. Megistus was the more
learned, but Philarites was the more eloquent; yet so, as Megistus learning
supplied his small want of eloquence, and Philarites eloquence made his
inequality in learning with Megistus undiscernable. Thus Nature seemed to teach
mortals that she could cast perfection in several moulds, and that her Grammar
did admit two Superlatives.

Megistus, whose vice it was to be Master-speaker (for they did all things by
vices) after he and Philarites both had kissed his Majesty's hands upon their
knees, spoke thus:

Sir, it is not to be admired why we come, but it is rather to be admired why
all the Gallants in the world come not to spend their best years in your
Majesty's Court, which is incomparably the best of places; We are come, Sir, to
list our selves amongst your Majesty's Servants; not that we are so vain as to
think that your Majesty needs such servants, but because we stand in need of
such a Sovereign as your Majesty, and of such breeding as your Court can afford
us; suffer us, like young plants, to grow under the sunshine of your
protection, and challenge the fruits when they come to maturity, as properly
due to none but to your Majesty. This discou^se delivered so accomplishedly,
made all the hearers imagine that the speaker was surely Mercury, come there to
make parade of his eloquence; and as their deportment, so their personages and
equipage made them very conspicuous. Megistus was clothed in black, which was
a pure scarlet dyed black (and seemed to be as if a black curle had been drawn
over a cloth of gold) richly embroidered; he carried on his cloak a crescent
of diamonds, on his hat he carried a hatband of the same fashion, whose beams
were reflected by a plummach of black feathers. Philarites was clothed in
white, his cloak doubled with Mertricks furs, and all richly embroidered with
gold and scarlet, carrying a plummach of white feathers, tipped with scarlet.
That week seemed to post away, that it might make way for the next, wherein the
Nuptials were to be celebrated; and albeit all the three days seemed to run in
one, yet the Bridegroom was sorry that Phoebus coachman might not be bribed to
drive faster; desire, like all other bodies, moving the faster the nearer it
approaches its center. At last came that week and day so much longed-for,
whose bright morning ominated happiness to the longing couple. At ten a clock
appeared the Bride, walking betwixt Agapeta and Aretina, who were the two poles
of beauty whereon the sphere of love moved: after them followed a company of
beautiful Virgins, all wearing the Brides livery, which was white satin,
enclining as it were to change its color, and which appeared, when motion
raised its pyle, that it hovered whether it should appear white or not. As they
passed along a green Alley, to go to Apollo's stately Temple, there stood
Mount Parnassus beautified with grass and flowers; its top was encircled by
nine Ladies, each whereof represented one of the nine Muses, and who mingling
their voices with the notes of their harmonious, though different instruments,
did make the hearers stand motionless, the spirits which formerly moved their
other members, having then run all to their ears to recreat themselves with the
sweetness of that charming music; the whole Mount lurked a while in the
clouds of smoke, which the burning myrrh, cinnamon and frankincense spread over
it, which at last evanishing, showed the bystanders Mercury, who stood upon
the top of the Mount, and making a low reverence, delivered thus to the Bride
his eloquent Commission.

If any of the gods had been unmatcht,
No mortal man should suc^ a prey have catc^t,
As fair Eliza, with whom Venus fair,
Is willing loves soveraignity to share,
And that in heaven, she shall loves scepter sway,
Whilst earths great globe, Eliza, does obey.
A^ her command, her scepter here I break,
Whereof one half your snow-white hand must take.
The Bride surprised with joy, and joying in the surprisal, took the one half
which Mercury had proffered her, and marched to the Temple, followed by the
Bridegroom, walking betwixt Megestus and Philarites, whom Sophander had placed
there, both to gratify them, and to obviate the contests which precedence
might have occasioned amongst the native Nobles; the Churches were so richly
decked as if the gods had lent all heavens furniture to decore their Altars,
and the magnificence of each thing was such as if Mars and Venus had been the
persons to be married.

After Dinner the Gentlemen (whose courage seemed to them rusted whilst they
rested) invited one another (albeit none of them needed any invitation besides
what they got from the mouth of honor) to ride at a small Ring, which was
presented by the Bride; all rode, but all had neither the same skill nor
success: for as the address and skill of some made the Ring seem greater to
them than it was, So the lourdnesse of others represented it to them less than
really it was; But whilst they were thus busied, a Gentleman, ushered by two
Trumpets, diverted the Kings eye from being longer the Arbiter of these martial
games, who presented him with a Paper, sent by his Master the Knight of Mars,
which was read by the Gentleman (to whom the King indulged that favor) and
repeated by an Herald, whose tenor was as follows.

GEntlemen, when I perceived Venus Altars so much frequented, and the grass
growing about the Altar of Mars, I could not but count this amongst the other
fits of the worlds dotage; Neither need mortals dispute any longer the
preference betwixt Love and Courage, seeing the gods themselves had determined
it: for they, by choosing a man to be god of Courage, and a woman only to be god
of Love, have in a mystical way shown us, that Courage is as much to be
preferred to Love, as man in excellency surpasses woman; but if Divinity
cannot persuade you, consult moral Philosophy, and it will tell you, That
Courage is Captain of Virtues Lifeguard: for, who durst be just without
Courage? and without Courage what a silly thing were Love? which behoved to lie
hidden in the womb of a Lovers brain, if Courage as a skillful Midwife, helped
not to bring it to the world? as also all virtues must be voluntary (for if
they were not voluntary, they were not virtues) and consequently the more
voluntary they be, they must be the greater virtues; whence it follows, that
seeing nothing is so voluntary as Courage (yea, Courage cannot be constrained)
and that Love is often necessitated either by the irresistibleness of the
object, or the weakness of the Lover, that Courage is the more preferable
virtue. And how many miserable creatures are there who would willingly (...)
Love, as a guest who neither carries respect, nor brings advantage to his
tortured host, So seeing they would willingly be rid of it, surely it must be in
it self an act altogether involuntary. Likewise we see, that seeing every good
is diffusive of it self; surely the more diffusive a virtue is, it must be
esteemed so much the more; and of all virtues, Courage extends it self to the
advantage of most (nothing being either achieved or accomplished without it)
and of all virtues, Love extends it self to fewest; that being the purest Love
which is fixed upon one, and the purest Courage which defends all. But if
Philosophy cannot persuade, consult Policy, whereof Courage is the darling,
being the Army of Commonwealths, and the Walls of Cities; but albeit Love has
been often their bane, yet it was never their protector. But if neither of these
can persuade, then let him who is dissatisfied appear to morrow, where my sword
shall prove what neither of these can, and let him remember, that if none
appear, Courage shall be declared conqueror; and if any appear, yet Courage
must still triumph above Love, to whom it must owe its defense.

After this Cartel was read, the Herald affixt Copies of it upon the Palace
gates, and upon a brazen Pillar, purposly fixed in the Royal Barriere, or Lists,
where (as the form was amongst the Ancients) he hung up the Knight of Mars his
shield, which those who were to fight on hors-back were to touch on the left
side, and those who were to fight on foot (which was reputed the noblest way,
as being subject to fewest accidents) behoved to touch on the right side,
whence sprang the fashion of carrying shields pendants, so much used in their
times; he who triumphed after a ridden combat, carrying his shield thereafter
hung by the left corner; and he who triumphed on foot, carrying his shield hung
by the corner dextre.

Megistus smiling at the Challenge, asked Philarites, if ever he heard any
thing in Athens proven by a sword? No truly, replied the other, except by
argumentum in Caesare, or argumentum ad hominem, be meaned that manner of
probation. Megistus and Philarites, who never strove formerly, did now strive
who should accept the Challenge, which controversy was at last, by the throw
of a dye, decided in Megistus favors; whereupon he took pen and ink, and
returned the Gentleman this Answer.

MArtial Knight, Love might have been said never to have erred, if it had not
contributed to thy birth, who now like an ungrateful son spittest in the face
of thy peerless parent. Why fightest thou in defense of Courage? is it not
because thou love it? And if so, thou can do nothing in defense of Courage
but what Love commands thee to do, whereby thou show that Courage is but the
arm, and Love the head, and so Love is as far preferable to Courage as the head
is to the arm, or the master to the slave; before the immortal gods created the
world, they loved one another, but Courage was not then exerced by them,
neither could it be: for where there were no wrongs, no miseries, there neither
could nor can be Courage, Courage being bestowed upon mortals either to punish
wrongs, or endure miseries; and since the world was created, how should the
gods be adored if they were not loved? if Love were much employed, there would
be no wrongs, no miseries, and so there should be no need of Courage; And the
blessed souls shall no ways stand in need of it, and yet shall be perfect:
which demonstrates that Courage in it self is no perfection. But, Sir, seeing ye
have no Love, ye can have little Reason. Wherefore, albeit I love extremely, I
do not, notwithstanding, love to blot paper idely, in persuading those who are
incapable of persuasion; but shall to morrow appear at the place appointed, and
(to retort your Epilogue) if ye appear not, Love shall triumph; and if ye
appear, it is because ye love to defend Courage, and so Courage owes its
defense to Love.

This Answer was delivered to the Gentleman, who delivered it to his Master;
and albeit every person at Court longed to see the event, yet their love to
Megistus made them fear to see even what they so much desired, whose generous
carriage had bragaded them all on his side.

The next morning Philarites came to gird on Megistus armor, and at the time
appointed the Martial Knight (who waited his hour) appeared in the Lists of
Honor, which was a large and plain valley, a great part whereof was in the
middle pallizaded with stoups of Cipres timber all gilded (as was the custom of
old) showing to the world an emblem of what they were appointed for, which was
to be a field where Death was gilded with the specious pretext of Honor and
Valor: within was a Tribunal erected for the Judges, upon whose footstool did
sit two Heralds, holding in their hands two Swords crowned, and besides whom
stood two Trumpets, from whom the signal was to be expected, and by whom the
Conqueror was to be conducted home in triumph: Without, were seats for the
Ladies, under whom were ranged the Noblemen and Knights, in the midst of whom
sat the King, under a Pale of State, with a Crown lying upon his cushion,
wherewith the Conqueror was to be honored, which, to difference it from the
Kings own Crown, was surmounted by a Lion rampant, holding in his fist a Sword
erected.

After him entered (as the mode was) the party challenged, who at his entry
touched the point sinistre of the Challenger's Sword, which hung upon the
Pillar, telling him in that language of formality, that he was to fight on
hors-back. The Knight of Mars was mounted on a white horse, whose flanks were
stained with red spots, as if they had been dyed with the drops of blood which
seemed to trickle down from the wounds, which an exquisite pencile had made
upon his armor, whereon was represented a wounded Knight, crowned with
Laurels. The bosses of his bridle were two little Cupids, in whose faces his
martial horse seemed to spit his frothy foam; his shield was decored with this
device, Cupid throwing a dart at Mars, which his hand meeting on the way, did
break in pieces; his Motto was, NOT LOVE, BUT WEAKNESS CONQVERETH. Megistus
armor was all white, spangled here and there with bleeding hearts; his shield
for its device carried Paris giving the golden Apple to Venus; The word was, TO
THE FAIREST.

Whilst they waited for the signal, the horses did dance to the music of their
own courage, and by champing on their own bits, seemed angry that their masters
would not suffer them to decide the quarrel. The Trumpets at last summoning the
Riders to begin their carreirs, their horses, who whilst they stood were
damming up their speed, opening now the sluice, did by a speat of speed carry
their Masters to a longed-for rencounter, where the Lances pressed forwards by
their Masters strength, and pressed backwards by their enemies resistance, did,
like weak boats, split in this co^ntertide of courage and resistance, resolving
rather to break than to be dyed with the valourous and innocent blood of such
incomparable Combitants. The Knights finding themselves deserted by their
Lances, sought assistance from their Swords, which had formerly been
grave^makers to so many valourous Knights. Thus fortune (thinking she had done
the Martial Knight honor enough in enabling him to resist so long) inclined to
favor Megistus, importuned thereto by the suits of all the bystanders, who
would have surely have favored the Martial Knight, because of his singular
courage, if he had been fighting against any else than against Megistus, and in
any other quarrel than that wherein he was then engaged, the Ladies eying him
as an enemy to their sex; and the Gentlemen hating him as an enemy to the
Ladies. Whilst they were trying how to conquer, the Martial Knight thinking
that not to overcome instantly, was to be overcome shamefully, lifted up his
arm as if he had been sending it to bring fresh assistance from his patron
Mars, (which posture, albeit it was against the rules of the Art, yet he
thought Megistus tottering condition might licentiate him to use, hoping to
remit himself in his old posture, before Megistus regained his saddle) intended
to separate at one blow Megistus from his saddle, and his soul from his body,
but he was mistaken; for Megistus vaulting aside, suffered not the Sword to
fall upon his, but upon disappointments shoulders; but that was not the only
inconvenience of that artless stroke: for the strength employed being great,
and the disappointment yet greater, he had almost been dragged by it out of his
saddle, and had almost by his Sword cut the earth, seeing he could meet with
nothing nearer to resist him; like a dog, who bites the stone, because he
cannot meet with the caster; which Megistus perceiving, and unwilling to slight
such an opportunity (called by some Masters of that Art, a Tempo) did by a
contertemps blow send him posting to the earth, to which he formerly inclined,
but irresolvedly; yet albeit he fell, his courage fell not with him, for, in
falling, he struck off one of Megistus's horse legs, who not being accustomed
to stand upon three feet, fell upon his knees, as if he craved him pardon for
the afront his master had done him: The Martial Knight like a ball rebounding
by the same strength that threw it to the earth, bolted up immediately.
Megistus, who had rid himself of his stirrups, did the like, and now they
coaped so furiously as that what formerly they had done, seemed, in respect of
what they were now doing, to be but like those essay thrusts, which learners
along in a Fencing-school before they put themselves in a posture, and seemed
to be but the earnest-peny of that great bargain they were now making: At last
the Martial Knight, considering that the blood which he spent in opposing
Megistus, would be better employed if spent in his quarrel, recoyling three
steps, called to the Judges, that, for any thing he knew, it was the god Mars
against whom he was fighting, and so, to atone his guilt, he was willing to
break his sacrilegious Sword, This merry conceit showed a quaint wit in him, in
whom they had spied a strong courage formerly; and now both of them, throwing
away their Swords, did embrace each other, wrestling as it were who should be
kindest. The Judge asked how the Crown should be bestowed? Give me it, said the
Martial Knight, and I will place it on the head of this deserving Gentleman.
Megistus refused it, and said, that his friendship was too great a prize to
remunerate so small a victory. Thus the King and Court returned home, expecting
with a long desire the afternoons tilting.

After Dinner, the King, Court and Judges being placed in their respective
places, as formerly. The first who entered these Lists of death, was a Knight
who seemed dead already: his armor was all black, and made him appear to be
deaths armor-bearer: his horse, whose counter was suitable to his masters
armor, seemed by his prancing to cut up a grave for his dead master; he was
discerned at last to be the valiant Terez, who fought in honor of the deceased
Lady Tina, once his dear Mistress; He told the Judges he came there, to beg a
pasport from some noble hand to post to heaven after her; where seeing he
resolved to go, he intended to go in the Chariot of Honor. The Judges at first
intended to deny him preference, telling him, That as life, according to the
course of nature, preceded death; so in the course of justice, life's Champions
were to be preferred. At which Answer, the black Knight showed some
dissatisfaction: Yet the Judges considering that the Blood Royal (whereof Terez
was one) were exempted by their birth, from such trifling ceremonies, and
judging it an inhumane act to add affliction to the afflicted, resolved to
authorize his appearance. He carried in his shield a Turtle Dove, sitting upon
a leafless Oak; his Motto was, ONLY ONE. Against him appeared two or three
Knights successively, who being vanquished, served as steps whereby Terez might
the more easily mount Fames theater: At last appeared one Knight, whom the Sun
had withered, and seemed to resemble one of those dead bodies whom the Egyptian
Mummie had preserved hundreds of years; his shield was beautified with a
Dying-man, all withered except one hand, wherein he carried a Scarlet Ribbon:
the Motto was, LOVE WORKS CONTRARIES; meaning, that it could make a fresh
body become withered, and a withered hand become fresh; This was Philarites,
and that was ARETINA'S Ribbon; the bosses of his bridle were two Lilly Roots,
whose leafless stalks served for the reigns.

These two seemed rather to court, than shun death; and the desire they had to
k^ll one another, seemed not to proceed from any desires they had to live (for
providence could inflict no greater punishment as life upon them) but rather,
because they desired to have one another company in the other world: thus they
spent many blows, and shed more blood than the bystanders imagined their
bodies were masters of. ARETINA was told by Philarites heart (which he had
depositated in her custody) that the Combatant who wore the Scarlet Ribbon, was
Philarites, and that she was the Sun, by whose beams his lovely body had become
so parched: whereat she blushed, or rather her blood, desiring to be judge and
witness of Philarites courage, came to her cheeks, to try if thence they might
descry that noble courage, which it heard all the spectators so much extol:
But Philarites beholding ARETINA (as if her face had been an Arsenal from which
he was to expect new armor) did by an irresistible stroke, kill that heart,
which grief had formerly so sore wounded; being thrown thus to the ground, he
threw up his eyes to heaven as if his soul intended from thence to take its
flight to paradise. Philarites running to him, did by his tears wash those
bleeding wounds which his sword had formerly opened, to whom the black Knight
gave a Diamond Ring, as a memorial of his true respect, which he had after that
same manner received from Pilades (ARETINA'S dear cousin and friend) whom he
had killed the year preceding in combat. Many regrated his loss, and a witty
Gentleman at Court dressed him this Epitaph.

It seems the gods to flit from earth intend,
Seeing their best furniture away they send
From this our globe, here in a coffine, Fame
Interred lies embalmed by Terez name.
Let mortals then rear him a Tomb of Tears,
Whilst their sad hearts a double mourning wears.
After Supper, whilst Terez ghosts were troubling all their quiet, there
entered a fellow, who told his Majesty that he was to show him a Monster. The
King desired he might present it upon a stage, whereon the Commedians used to
act, that it might be easily discerned, and the whole Court the better
satisfied. Whereupon the fellow mounting the stage, and removing the sheet that
covered his promised Monster, there appeared an old fellow, with a pair of
large Hearts Horns; at which a merry Gentlewoman snuffing, said, A strange
Monster forsooth, whereof I have such another lying in my bed at home. The
fellow having viewed him on all quarters, did thus begin his description.

This Acteon, is by his kind wife called her Heart, and he is so; for she has
made him so. He came to the world when Capricornus presided amongst the
celestial signs, at which time he received the name of Cornelius; the Man in
the Moon was Gossip, who, as a Donative, bestowed upon him the fair Cap which
he now wears, which his wife fearing he should lose, has borrowed needls from
her kind neighbors to sow it on faster; and wherever he enters (such is her
pride) that she will have five or six to follow him: at last, she did not fancy
the name of Cornelius Tacitus (saying that it was not famous) but she would
needs have him called Cornelius Publicus (he being the Publican, and she the
Sinner) She having one day offended him (as young women do often old men) he
called her Whore; and she, fearing that neighbors might thereafter upbraid him
with the name of a Liar, hired some pretty Gentlemen, who were her
acquaintances, to vindicat his name from that aspersion; whereat the good old
man (finding that he was mistaken) did, like the Snails when they are angry,
shoot out his Horns.

This description ended, they went all to bed, and with that day they ended the
solemnity of these Nuptials.

The Second Book.
Forgetfulness did now begin to claim soveraignity over what past, and the
pleasures of that famous Solemnity, which had not long since been in its
flourish, was now in the fall of its leaf; and every man returned to his former
employment, sorry that pleasure, which had only shown them a glimpse of the
face, should have passed by so quickly; and they resembled now poor
Gallyslaves, who after some short recreation, are called back to their former
Oars. But Philarites, besides the common melancholy wherein he shared with
others, had likewise a private stock of his displeasure, wherewith his
melancholy soul traded continually: for, nothing pleased him, seeing he could
not please ARETINA: his days seemed nights, because not illuminated by the
sunshine of her smiles; and his nights seemed death, because not quickened by
hopeful thoughts: and fearing that Bonaria should bring home her daughter with
her, he entreated Eudoxa to cause Agapeta intercede for her stay at Court,
which Agapeta did, and prevailed so, that Bonaria returning home left ARETINA
with the Princess.

Whilst all others went abroad to hunt, Philarites stayed at home, hunting
occasions to meet ARETINA, but all in vain; for Agapeta (whom virtue had glued
to ARETINA) thought always she wanted company when she wanted ARETINA; yet,
one afternoon ARETINA'S waiting-mai^ (with whom he kept constant
correspondency, and whom his generous carriage, and rich donatives, had gained)
acquainted him, that she was to stay at home retiredly till six a clock; for
she had always endeavored, since the last Combat, to wash by her wishes that
tauney color, which the armor and device represented, and was divesting her
self of that indifferency toward Philarites which she had used formerly,
weighing all his qualities in the balance of love (which would have proven
weighty enough even in the balance of truth) and his very fame (which is but
naturally a thing very light) appeared heavy here.

Whilst she was curiously recapitulating to her self all his endowments,
Philarites enters the hall, asking if ARETINA was quiet? she finding her mind
in disorder, and accusing her very thoughts, as if they had divulged her
secrets to Philarites, (for none knew them but they) resolved not to admit him,
yet that resolution was presently re-called by a second, which condemned the
first of unmannerlinesse; whereupon she desired that he might advance: for love
persuaded her, that the gods, who were his favorites, and are mortals
privie-counsellours, had inspired him to choose so favorable an opportunity.

Philarites, at his entry, making a low reverence (as if he would have kissed the
ground, because she had once trod upon it) said, Madam, I fear that as I am
fortunate in finding you solitary, so I am unfortunate in having an opportunity
to disquiet your solitariness, but my obedience in retiring, if commanded,
shall testify that my error streamed from ignorance. Sir, (replied ARETINA)
your company would be preferred by the finest Wits at Court to any else, and
why should I refuse to accept that favor which better than I would entreat for.

Philarites being seated in a chair near ARETINA, did, like a ship newly entered
the harbor, discharge a volley of sighs; but his spirits, who had retired to
assist his heart presently wounded by a dart, short from ARETINA'S eye, had
left his tongue frozen by the cold chillness of fear; yet she perceiving by
what he had spoken formerly what he would have spoken now, (her cunning
supplied his dumbness) to enter him in some discourse, and fearing he should
enter upon that subject, asked what news were current at Court? Philarites
lifting his dejected eyes, said, Madam, why should one who has no interest in
the world, such as I am, ask what the world is doing? Truly, said ARETINA, if
ye have as much interest in the world, as ye have courage to astonish the
world, or had as much need of the world, as it has of you, I am confident your
interest would cede to none. Since my courage cannot he serviceable to you,
Madam, (replied Philarites) I value it not; or, at least, since you will not
employ it, for I shall never use it but either in Virtues, or your quarrel; and
seeing your goodness will never engender enmity, my courage shall be useless:
neither vallue I Virtue so much for any reason, as because it is a thing
wherein ye take some pleasure. I thought (quoth ARETINA) that ye had swept away
these cobwebs of folly (or of love, as ye will term it) from the cabinet of
your generous soul; and I judged always formerly, that none but fools and
madmen were taken in these cobwebs, which that crafty spider, Cupid, weaves,
to ensnare poor mortals, but that such strong Courages as yours would easily
break through them.

Fair Lady, replied Philarites, I am not prisoner in follies cobwebs, but in
those golden chains which loves fair hands have twisted for me. Alas, Madam, I
would have thought my self happy once this morning to have received your
commands, but now I think my self unhappy, seeing when I have received, I cannot
obey them. Ye command me not to love: but that is as unpossible as to command
me to banish my reason and senses; for, love and they seem now to be
incorporated in one: and ye would think him an unskilful Physician who would
apply nothing to his patient, but would entreat him only to convalesce.
Wherefore, Madam, apply the lenitives of clemency to cure my wounded heart,
which else is incurable. If ye be really distempered with that passion (said
ARETINA) employ your reason. Alas, Madam, quoth Philarites, ye send me to the
wrong Physician; for my reason confirms my passion, and persuades me it is
reasonable to love a person of your extraordinary qualities, and that seeing all
your acquaintances adore your perfections, it were vanity in me to be singular,
it imploys, as a guard for it, my memory to remember those excellent discourses
which I have heard from you; it imploys my eyes to behold those ravishing
looks, and my judgment to ponder the singular effects of your rare prudence: So
that (fair Lady) the only sanctuary I can refuge my self in, is your favor.
But think ye (said ARETINA) that I will prove so great a stranger to my
parents, as to choose without their advice? (for, to choose without ones
consent, is to choose against his consent, seeing possibly his consent can never
be extorted from him, and so by choosing before he consent, we care not whether
he consent or not) and especially being a woman, whose reason is weaker, and
whose passion is stronger than that in a man, and so the one has more need to
be directed, and the other more need to be restrained than in men; and
thereupon she opened a book which lay upon her table, wherein she made him read
this subsequent discourse. Experience teaches that a woman's miscarriage is
more prejudicial to her self, and more dishonorable to her parents than a
man's; and so where the wrong may be greater, the consent of the party wronged
seems more requisite; seeing the consent is required to skreen the consenter
from a future wrong: Whereon has been built that signal Law, that a man may
necessitate his daughter to marry, but not his son: because, if the daughter
not marrying, tash her repute, her fathers repute is irrepairably wronged, and
her own being, dyed black by immodesty, can never return, neither to its own,
nor any other color. And there is reason it should be so, because where the
crime is most to be feared, there the Law should be most strict: And surely
women are more prone to embrace what their passion proffers them than men are;
as also, because there is more modesty required in them, the offending of
modesty must surely in them be a greater vice. The reason why modesty is more
required in them than in men, are first, Because seeing that is the main virtue
which Nature has bestowed upon them, they should therefore endeavor to be
rich in that; and as men should exceed women in courage, because courage is the
virtue of their sex; So women should exceed men in modesty, because modesty is
the virtue of theirs, nature having bestowed something upon every species,
wherein they are to excel others, suffering them for their greater ornament, to
monopolize the perfection of some one quality. Whence every species is necesary
in the world, and adds some ornament to it; But the politic reason why modesty
is by the Law thought more requisite, and immodesty in the Law more punished in
women, because immodesty in women can be more destructive to the Commonwealth,
rendering heritages uncertain, and fathers careless of their posterity, not
knowing if their supposed children be come out of their own loins; Which was
the cause likewise why Adultery was only reputed such, when there was an
unlawful familiarity betwixt a married woman and a man, whether married or
unmarried; but familiarity betwixt a married man, and an unmarried woman, was
not reputed Adultery, albeit now both be punished equally, as being perjury
against the immortal gods, whereas then no vow was made.

Philarites laying aside the book, ARETINA continued thus; Sir, as it were
absurd in me to love without my parents consent, so it were yet more absurd in
me, without his consent, to match with a stranger (for, whom I love, him I
intend to match with) for how can I know his extraction whose person I know
not? and I will never love him whose extraction I am ignorant of: For I have
often heard my father say, that it was probable that men's spirits always
corresponded to their birthes; Whereupon she put in his hands the former book
of Essays, wherein she desired him to read this subsequent discourse.

It is certain that the gods who have chosen Princes and Nobles to be their
Vicegerents upon earth, will replenish their souls with endowments requisite
for the discharge of so weighty an employment; and seeing the employing unfit
persons, is a folly scarce incident to men, it were blasphemy to charge the
gods with it; for, albeit the gods sometimes shows their soveraignity in
acting above the reach of our reason, yet seeing man is formed after the image
of the gods, and seeing the rational soul is this image, surely what reason
teaches us, that the gods will do. It might be thought likewise injustice in
the gods, if they subjected us to those who could not command; and as it seems
prejudicial to us, so it may prove derogatory and destructive to their
interest: for, either the arrogant folly, or despicable simplicity of
Governors, are the nurseries of all public combustions and commotions; wherein
the very Temples are not exempted from the edge of popular fury. But besides
these, Nobility wants not its other advantages, as that of breeding, which
seems to be the ^oul's soul, and the cream of all humane perfections, and that
of confidence, their birth being a rock situated above the reach of malices
greatest shot. The distance likewise which others must keep with persons of
quality, is no weak bulwork to defend their honor, and to maintain their
respect: for, the best of men, having much of naughtiness in them, the
retiredness enjoined to them by their dignity, and the distance enjoined to
inf^^^urs by their duty, is a skr^en which vails over all these imperfections,
and conceals what is not worthy of the noticeing; man being like bad
merchandise, which looks best when looked upon at a distance, or when presented
in a dark shop; so that oft-times what is gilded by retiredness, passes for
the real gold of prudence.

Philarites laying aside the book, looked as if his tongue had been with child
of something which it wanted strength to bring into the world, at last said,
Madam, ye are loved by one who is subject to none but to ARETINA, and who
albeit he be a Prince, yet accounts it a greater happiness, and a more sublime
honor to be your Subject, than a Prince in his own Nation. Here he stopped, as
if he would have accused himself for not stopping sooner. ARETINA (glad to be
now assured of what she formerly conjectured) told him, that there was yet one
ingredient requisite to be infused in loves potion, which was constancy;
neither resolve I (said she) to cast the anchor of my love but upon some sure
ground, which will not suffer it to slip: for, constancy is more requisite in a
Lover, than Nobility in a Courtier; and as the one will be required by my
parents, so the other will be required by my self, neither will ever I marry
but him in whose generous person I see those accomplishments first married.

Six a clock striking, advertised ARETINA that she behoved to wait upon
Agapeta, so bidding Philarites adieu, she left him to admire his own
happiness, who returned now as deeply fraughted with joy, as he entered
fraughted with grief; like a ship who had unloaded her self of her pricelesse
ballast, that she might load her self with rich and precious commodities.

Now love did begin to kindle its flames in the chimney of Megist^s breast,
which were continually augmented by the bellows of fame, whose mouth brea^hed
nothing so much as ARETINA'S praises; but that chimney, never heated by the
like fire formerly, suffered these coals to kindle but slowly: In the end,
Cupid, who had long hovered whether to shoot or not, fearing that Megistus
heart, (hardened by the continual exercise of martial employments) should be
unpenitrable by his darts, at last loosed a shaft (resolving to hazard a dart
to conquer such a noble soul) which did wound his poor heart so deeply, as that
the hand of his courage could never there-after pluck out the dart; nor yet
could the hand of his reason cure the wound: for one morning, going to fetch a
walk in the Garden Royal, he perceived, unexpectedly, Agapeta, who was pulling
some Cherries, the trees bowing their branches, that she might by her own hand
pull their fruit: Megistu^ saluting her, would have retired, yet so (...) that
he showed a desire to advance; like (...) Fencer, who by a feint would have his
adversary believe what he intends not; but Agapela willing to discourse with
him, whose discourse each man at Court so much commended, entreated him to
advance, telling him that these Cherries would relish the better that they
were eaten in his society, whose presence could make the worst fare a feast.

Madam, replied Megistus, who feeds on your ravishing looks, feasteth beyond
all the dainties that Venus table can afford him. But whilst she was pulling
these Cherries, Megistus was pulling the poisoning hemblocks of poisoning love:
for, looking upon Agapeta's eyes, he thought they were Cupids quiver, wherein
he kept all his mortal darts; every trait of her face seemed a storehouse of
sweetness, and her hair, which because of its color, and curlings, resembled
so many gold rings, proved to him chains to fetter the feet of his trembling
soul: he was in end awaked out of his ecstasy of admiration, wherein his love
had lulled him asleep, by Philarites, who had traced him from his Chamber, whom
Agapeta saluting courteously, they fetched some walks in the pleasant Alley,
recounting the various and charming pleasures of the ^ast Solemnity; and
amongst the other pleasing passages that had occurred, Agapeta told him how a
Lady had fairded her decayed looks, with the youthful colors that she had
borrowed from Art, was deciphered by a young Gentleman, who by the reflection
of a burning-glasse, melted away those splendid colors, who seemed shamefully
to have away^ how soon they were discovered. I remember, said Megistus, of such
an affront, wherewith just providence rewarded a young Ladies cheating pains in
our Country, who being mistress of a Ball given her at her own lodging, retired
always to an inner chamber, where, by a little feather, she sprinkled her face
with some white Lilly water, with which she seemed continually to recruit those
auxilaries, which she had hired out of Arts territories to assist her weak
beauty: a Gentleman perceiving that the Phyol wherein it was, stood in the dark
corner of a chamber, which she had purposly obscured (fearing lest light should
discover that work of darkness) went and removed the Phyol, exchanging it with
another full of Ink, which the Lady at her return made use of as formerly,
besmearing her face with it, and returning, was welcomed by the unrestrainable
laughter of all the spectators. It is just, said Agapeta, that the gods should
punish those, who by the pencil of vanity will undertake to amend any thing in
a piece which has once past their hands, they are (added Megistus) like those
cunning hunters, who cover branches with birdlime to ensnare some silly fowl,
which little expects their Art; yet I think that as these are sk^llesse
merchants, who hazard much, where there is but little to be gained, and where
the gain, albeit they escape, cannot balance the loss if their voyage thrive
not; So those Ladies will lose more in their repute, if once entrapped, than
the repute of a fine face can advantage them, if discovered; for the one will
cry them down below all those at Court, albeit the other can never plead
preference to them before all those raying faces which shine there: Yea, I
think they accuse themselves of some notable defect, which they think cannot be
palliated but by some notable cheat, and detracts extremely from their own sex,
showing that color is its greatest ornament, and from ours, in thinking that
color is a sufficient price for our dearest liberty. Agapeta being called-for
by a Lady from the Queen, left Megistus in a drooping condition, like a lowering
Solsequium at the Suns absence, or like the disconsola^e body receiving the
flitting soul's last adieu.

Not long after this, an accident at Court disturbed somewhat the quiet of both
the Knights, who dragging after them one link of misfortunes fatal chain, were
followed by all its fellows.

Some Noblemen at Court not daring to attaque Sophanders grandour in his own
person, resolved to affront him in the person of these Knights, his avowed
minions, and petitioned the King that their privileges might not be infringed
by his nimious respect to strangers; and that seeing their predecessors had
planted by their pains, and watered by their blood, the thriving Vine of
blossoming Monarchy in that Nation, that they their successors might now eat
with pleasure, and in safety, its delicious fruits; and that strangers might
not reap what they had sown, Therefore they entreated his Majesty not to
prefer these strangers to them, seeing albeit they might be Nobles at home, yet
they could not be esteemed as Nobles in Egypt: for, albeit Gentility (because
it is a quality dyed with the blood) be the same everywhere, so that a
Gentleman in one Nation is a Gentleman in every Nation, he having received that
honor from the hand of Nature, whose subjects all Nations are; whence it comes
that a Gentleman of one Kingdom may by the Law of Arms challenge another, seeing
he leaves not his Blood when he leaves his Country; yet Nobility is the
donative of the Prince, which none are obliged to acknowledge who are not his
subjects, and so out-reaches not his Territories, but, like the Loadstone,
loses its energie when without the sphere of its allowed activity: Therefore
by the Law of Nations, and of Arms, Noblemen are not accounted such when
amongst strangers.

The King calling Megistus and Philarites privately, told them the quarrel; who
entreated his Majesty to satisfy his Nobles, and not to put them in the scales
with strangers, whose assistance was less valuable, and more uncertain than
that of his natives. But the King ashamed of their insolency, and willing to
gratify the generous Knights, told them, that he would advance them to be
Knights, and honor them with the Collar of Jupiter, an Order instituted in
Egypt, to difference highly-deserving persons from the rabble of ordinary
Knights, whom the ambition of the Subject, and lenity of the Prince, had, by
making it ordinary, made it despicable; and that thereby they might claim
preference from all the other Subjects everywhere, without the verge of
National Solemnities, such as in Parliaments, Senates, Councils, where none
could be admitted but these, whose fortunes lying within the circle of the
Nation, might oblige them to riske their lives for their Countries safe^y; men
being always most willing to go when interest pouseth them: As also it is
dangerous to admit strangers to the intimacy of national mysteries; neither is
it thought prudence in a King, to admit those to manage affairs who have not
estates to be hostages for their fidelity, and to repay the injuries done,
during their Government, to private persons. The Knights did on their knees
acknowledge his Majesty's civilities, but told him that they wished his Majesty
not to prostitute these honors to ignominy, by conferring them upon persons,
so little meriting; for they were sensible how destructive the impressa of
honor was to subjects, draining the purses of su^jects in buying them from the
hands of profuse Courtiers, who, as they sinned against the King, in abusing
his favors; so they sinned against the Gods and Commonwealth, in employing its
price, as suffultors to support the shield of their matchless pride, and how
when these abject richlings, or richlesse Gentlemen had once come by them, they
behoved to make vanity and luxury to bear up the train of these useless
honors: these disadvantages are swelled to a prodigious excrescensie, by
another as bulkish as any of the former; for, by that means trade is
everywhere almost starved, Nobility hindering those who are stocked with money
to employ it in merchand^zing, and poverty disabling those who now traffic,
from driving a trade suiting with the exigency of the Nation, which makes me
entitle my Country to an infinite happiness, seeing traffic and trading effaces
not their true Nobility, which two our custom accounts most compatible;
whence accresces this great advantage, that young venturers being descended of
noble families, are often recruited by the well-stored C^sh of their friends,
after that a rude storm, or some other inevitable accident, has preyed upon
their first adventures, Whereas, if they were destitute of this assistance,
they behoved to lose their hopes when they lost their stocks, and so the
Commonwealth would be robbed of their endeavors, whose spirits were as great
as their misfortunes; and, on the other hand, Noblemen by their means are
encouraged to put their native commodities to the best fine.

The King, vanquished by their obstinate refusal, condescended not to
accumulate them with these his justly tendered favors, telling them that
opportunity might ripen for them more satisfying honors.

But the wellspring of Philarites hard fate, ceased never to bubble up fresh
misfortunes, employing all the weapons of coffeehouse to rout his
unconquerable virtue, hating always spirits of such a noble detramp, because
they scorn to make her the center of their happiness; as if she would persuade
men, that they could not subsist without her assistance: Wherefore seeing his
quiet could not be disquieted by pride, she resolved to employ jealousy, whose
subtle hands twisted this curious snare for him.

A Lady, sister to the Prince of Goshan, named Pinasa, whose beauty suited well
with her birth, and whose birth furnished her respect enough at Court, had of a
long time looked upon Philarites with loves spectacles, but finding that her
portracture could never be drawn upon the ground of Philarites heart, till
ARETINA'S were first defaced, studied all means to perpetrat happily, what she
desired so passionatly; yet finding that Philarites love could not be cheated,
she endeavored to cheat ARETINA, whose modesty she expected might more
probably co-opere with her malice; not permitting her to trace the crook^d path
of her sinistrous designs, so nimbly as Philarites male passion doubtless
either would or could; but finding that she alone was not able to draw malices
chariot, yoaked with her self an old hagg in the same employment, and bribed
her venal spirit, which because it was venal, might easily be bribed; who
measured every thing; yea, virtue it self, by the yard of money, not caring for
heaven, but because it was said to be paved with gold; nor respecting the gods,
but because their favor was a mine, out of which much precious treasure might
be dug: this wretch did undertake the conduct of that wretched affair,
promising, because of her easy address to ARETINA, and intimacy with her
servants, to pousse it to a wished-for period; Thus launcing out into the deeps
of malice, the sails of her diligence, were filled with an unexpected gale of
success: the barrennest earth being fertilest of such poisonous weeds; and she,
who was fit for nothing else, was by malice exceedingly fitted for this.

And now Philarites hard fortune, which had decreed the event, had likewise
marshalled very orderly all the means, by which, as by sinews, this great body
of jealousy was to move: for, one day walking in a meadow (whose face was by
over-spreading Nylus hid twice a year, that it might appear the more
beautiful) did, as unfortunatly, as unexpectedly, encounter a clew of Ladies,
whose rec^eations had trysted them hither. Megistus and Philarites had always
valued highly such company, but never so much as now, seeing they appeared to
them coppies of their Mistrisses original beauty: after them followed the
Martial Knight, and Aristo, Pinasa's brother; thus the number of the Ladies and
that of the Knights was equal: salutes being interchanged, Philarites fearing
lest the conduct of the Ladies might hatch some private disgusts amongst either
the Ladies, or themselves, about their attendance, (and so that they might
ignorantly, though innocently, relapse into the same danger out of which they
were but lately escaped) and to determine that indifferency which might oblige
all equally to wait upon all, he entreated each Lady to lend him some concealed
token, which when he had gotten, and had hudled up in a hat, he desired each
Gentleman to draw out one, and that each should attend and entertain her, whose
unseen token should fall to his share: for (said he) incomparable Ladies, the
hazard is not great where none can choose what is not excellent, so that I may
say, there was never more of Lottry seen where there was less of hazard; each
of us is happy in the share he has gotten, and yet each of us may be thought
unhappy in wanting what share we want; So that pleasure and disappointment
never met so amicably as in this particular.

Thus they spent some time in walking (Lot having coupled them cunningly
together) but Pinasa finding that this disappointed the desire she had to
banquet her eyes upon Philarites lovely countenance, entreated they might pass
some time under the shadow of a neighboring Arbor; which all obeying, they
retired thither, where being seated, Pinasa broke silence thus; Gentlemen, as
there is nothing less taking than a confused look, and dejected countenance,
(where the runaway looks represent the sad spectacle of a flying Army) so there
is nothing that can discompose a countenance more, than the fixed eye of a
confident Gentleman, whose silence allows him time for that employment,
whereby modesty is twice a sufferer, both by the Gentleman who s^reweth it a
note higher, and by the Gentle women's selves, who tune it a note lower than is
either allowable or seant; wherefore I wish we might use some game to sport
away time, and to prevent our blushes: But seeing our accustomed recreations are
covered almost with the gray hair of loathing, I wish Megistus, ye would invent
some new one, that the Court might hereafter hug it, as a memorial of your
sparkling vivacity of spirit. Madam, replied Megistus, I have no other
sufficiency for the discharge of that duty but what I borrow from your
Ladyships commands, wherefore, Madam, it were injustice to refuse you what is
your own.

Since there is no absolute perfection but in heaven, nor absolute imperfection
but in hell, (the earth participating of their extreamities, as it reconciles
both their distances) and seeing those even who see their dearest objects in the
mirror of love, see some blemishes in them, (which proves that the most
accomplished of things wantteth some accomplishment; for if it could be seen any
where, it would be seen there) I wish every Lady would tell what imperfection
she could dispense best with in that person she most loves.

What will ye propose, Philarites (continued Pi^asa) for this nights
entertainment? Truly Madam (answered Philarites) seeing discourse is the best
physiognimy of our thoughts (the tongue being but Secretary to that skillful
Enditer, the heart) and seeing neither prudence, nor respect, will suffer us to
pry narrowly into one another thoughts; I wish we might hit at some indirect
way whereby our enquiry might be somewhat gratified; wherefore I wish one of us
might tell her who sits next him, in the ear, some remark of any person here
present, at which all the rest might divine, according to their fancy, every
one of us endeavoring to conjecture what was the first speaker observation,
and he or she who shall be by maniest voices judged to have been most mistake,
shall forfeit some pawn, to be disposed of at the discretion of the Society.
This last pleased them best; and after they had by its help diverted themselves
sufficiently, the night summoned them to remove: and Pinasa willing to bestow
something upon Philarites, which might terrify ARETINA'S jealousy, did let a
Ribbon fall carelessly (which she had worn in so remarkable a place at all the
last Solemnity, as none could but remark it) which Philarites (in whose hand
hers was) taking up, presented her with; but she, willing to employ it as a
chain to fetter his passion, desired him to keep it, as a memorial of her
gratefulness, for that unparalleled favor she, and all the remanent Ladies
had received at his hands.

Whilst times glass was thus running, the old Hagg was by the coals of
diligence and treachery, kindling the flames of jealousy in ARETINA'S breast,
whose ardent affection to Philarites had softened her to an easy reception of
it; contentment being like other delicacies, whereof the sweetest becomes
soonest putrified, and the souls of the delicatest tramp are like the bodies of
the poorest complexion, whose purity bows soonest to decays scepter; and the
fear to be surprised in following the hidden tract of misinformation, is the
mean whereby they are often misinformed; thus love, which persuaded ARETINA
that she was unworthy of such a lover as Philarites, did likewise peswade her,
that Philarites would perch his love more worthily upon some other object,
and, by being inconstant, would make inconstancy a virtue: But there was more
Rhetoric musted up in that dumb R^bbon than in all the loquacious Oratory of
old Pla^eta, and jealousy did enter by the same porch that love first entered:
She impeached now Philarites as guilty of high treason against love, and
adduced her own eyes as witnesses, who seemed to deluge themselves in tears,
lest they should see the sad effect of his prodigious inconstancy, which durst
upon his arm brave the sight of affl^cted ARETINA; yet her jealousy was
glutted with a more pregnant argument of his assured change: for Placeta, who
had studied the music of what enchantment the Tarantula of ARETINA'S
melancholy was best pleased with, caused a cunning fellow (who traded in the
adulterating of Writs, and resembling every man's character) writ a Letter with
his greatest cunning, (giving him a stolen Letter for his pattern) wherein
Philarites might be made to exchange his Mistress; whose tenor was thus:

The disconsolate PHILARITES, to the peerless PINASA.
MADAM,
THe torrent of my boundless passion, has in fine swelled to such an
excrescency, that the banks of reason are no longer able to restrain it. I find
my self guilty, if I evaporate my passion, and choked if I evapor it not. My
reason has chosen your pleasure as Arbiter, to reconcile these, else
irreconciliable antagonists: who^e conflicts harrasse that heart, which is only
yours. If I courted ever any else but you, it was only to facilitate to me the
great task of your love, in regard whereof all my former passions seem but
essays. Assure your self, fair Lady, that whilst Philarites lives, he must
love; and whilst he loves any, he will love you. I shall keep my love in the
prison of privacie, till ye send it a remission; neither shall it ever come
abroad but upon the paroll of your permission.


This Letter was given to Pinasa, who being one day at Court, watched by the
diligent eye of sorrowing ARETINA, did carelessly, as it seemed, let it fall,
within the command of ARETINA'S reach, who stealing it into her pocket, retired
to her chamber, to see what she could pick out of it, and having shut the door,
did read her ruin in these fatal characters.

O pattern of baseness, how have thou betrayed my credulity! how have thou
stifled my hopes, and stained thine own valor! Yet alas, poor ARETINA, thou
have prostitute thy faith to his roguishness, and thou appearedst as willing to
be entangled, as he was willing to entangle thee; it was strange thou could
be so infatuated with a stranger, and now it appears more strange that thou
should startle at so necessary an event; thou who wast the envy of Ladies,
and the Image adored by Gallants, wilt now be the object of both their
laughters; and seeing Philarites's bewitching deportment will bundle up respect
for him at all hands, the same carriage will surely blunder thee, and thou and
he will be like two buckets in the Well of fate and fame, whereof the one must
rise to the same proportion that the other falls; and as the ocean of fame ebbs
upon the shore of thy repute, it must flow upon his; and surely his propitious
fortune will make all thy acquaintances conclude, that he left off to love thee
because he discovered something in thee which was not lovely. Miserable ARETINA!
who have banquerouted that stock of fame, which the indulgent gods had once
bestowed upon thee, and who have now rendered thy self as despicable as once
thou wast lovely; misery has once ^atched thee in its arms, and will never
dismiss thee; fame has banished thee, and will never rehabilitat thee; thy
parents joys are massacred in thee, and in the roll of thy crimes stands
likewise the black crime of thy paracide; all those additions of honor which
served once to adorn the shield of thy repute, serve now as diminutions to it;
and, as a punishment of thy crime, thy name shall still last in the registers
of infamy.

Thus did ARETINA stand streaming out lakes of tears, as if she would have
drowned that Letter, because Philarites's name was written in it; like an
implacable Judge, ordaining the malefactor to be hanged in effigy, because he
cannot be found in person; and riving out her hair because it afforded him once
contentment, her passion verged upon destraction, and the music of her sury,
like the six notes, did raise themselves a degree always higher; she evited
company, lest they should upbraid her with her misfortune; and her retirements
were as racks whereupon her unapeasable grief did torture her, and her disease
was so much the more dangerous that she durst admit no Physician: Thus she
lived always dying, and thus she dyed whilst she was yet living.

Yet love, for its own defense, did allege, that jealousy might be mistaken
as well as hope, and especially amongst women, whose genius biased most that
way: for as men, because of their courage, are oftenest befooled by hope; so
women, because of their innate timerousness, are oftenest betrayed by fear: and
of all women, lovers are soonest overcome by fear; for, as their love
multiplieth perfection in the person loved, so those perfections multiply fears
in the person loving; even as they whose coffers regorge with treasures, fear
most the loss of their treasure. Love likewise teaches us to overvalue
others, and undervalue our selves, and so persuades us that all the world
gapes after what we affect most, and that of all pretenders we deserve least;
and so there is reason to fear, that seeing we deserve it not, albeit none
pretended to its enjoyment, that there is much more reason to fear a loss of
what we love, in the throng of so many competitors.

Now Pleasure intended to change its camp, and, like the Sun, to make all the
world debtor to it splendour by turns, intending often to aggreage its respect
by its absence, and to conciliate respect elsewhere by its presence, so that
oftentimes it does (like all other agents) by the same means, produce contrary
events; so that some by being merry, others by being retired; some by being
proud, others by being humane, attain, by these contrary midses, to the same
end of glory; like two men by opposite ways meeting others on the other side
of perfections globe, to which men may go by contrary motions: For, whilst the
Court was bathing themselves in their pleasure, a Currier comes, telling the
King that a Navy of strangers were riding before Iris, expecting a safe entry
from the next tide; and that some Fishers had by their Flags perceived them to
be the Navy of Prastus King of Persia, who disputed propriety in the Kingdom
of Egypt: For, Xistus, grandfather to the King who now lives, was by birth
King of Persia, and for his valor, elected King of Egypt, and so Prastus's
father, being his firstborn, was righteous Heir of both Crowns; but the Nation
really scorning to be annexed to Persia, and thinking that slavery too unworthy
a recompense for their respectfull choice, elected the second son; because,
albeit he was but second son to Xistus, yet he was their Kings eldest son,
Prastus's father being born before his fathers acquest of Egypt, and so they
preferred him to his elder brother, so that ever since he and his successors,
have still waited a quarrel to revenge their unjust resentments.

The King allarmed with these news, did by his fear, add to the strength and
number of Prastus Forces, and by looking upon his own Forces through the wrong
end of truths prospect, did see them less, and more inconsiderable than really
they were; his danger was eminent, and his Forces scattered; his Courtiers
dissatisfied, and his Adversaries rich; his Soldiers unexperienced, and theirs
most expert; as also, their remoteness from their Country would make them stack
all the stock of their courage upon the game; whereas his Soldiers, knowing
where to retreat, would care the less how to fight. Megistus perceiving that
the waves of the King's doubts raged extremely, intended to calm them by the
oil of his courage, whereupon accosting his Majesty as he was solitary in his
Cabinet, he desired a Commission to muster under his Majesty's Standard, such
as would make their lives their Countries bulwork, and who might catch some
advantage of the unwary Persians, whom either presumption or Sea-sickness,
might weaken beyond expectation.

The King loath to hazard that ominous Encounter (for so the first always is)
upon so great odds, told him, he would reserve his courage as the spur
whereby all his Army might be incited to ride triumphs carreer, and that a
skirmish was not a theater large enough to Megistus to display his courage
upon, nor a handful of men witnesses enough to so renowned a valor; yet at
last, confiding in Megistus's courage, and afraid of the peoples dangerous
commotions, he authorized his Design.

Megistus name was a trumpet loud enough to call together all those who longed
to draw the swords of their Courage out of the sheath of laziness, and to
sheath them in the bowels of their Countries enemies; and now he had clewed
some twelve hundred, who like a snowball became more bulkish the further it was
rouled; wherefore he intended in this his first addresses to Agapeta, to usher
himself in, with this happy opportunity, and after a profound reverence, said,

Madam, I come to levy new forces out of your looks, to assist me in this
combat against your fathers enemies, and to have my Commission sealed by the
hand of your pleasure; Who dare resist when ye command? and who would love that
blood which would not kiss the ground for your satisfaction? I know justice
will take off that vail wherewith we see her eyes ordinarily mufled up, to
behold your quarrel, and will put victories garland in your hand, that ye may
crown those who stand in your defense; wherefore, Madam, I am come to resign my
heart to you, and to leave it under your cure, and in the hospital of your
mercy (where many thousands besides it lies) seeing its wounds forbids me to
take it along with me, and in place of it, I shall fill my breast with a
dram of hopes which I am to expect from the scales of your Ladyships favor.

Agapeta fearing, lest her rudeness might unfit him for the journey, and
desiring to animate him, who only by his example could animate the rest; and
who was the axletree whereon courage's wheels was then to roll, told him, that
she wished her wishes could assist him, whose valor was to assist her, and that
she thought her self most fortunate, who could salary such Warriors with so
little expense of treasure (her smiles being all the sold which was sought)
wherefore she entreated him to expect all the favor that a Lady could indulge
to him.

Megistus being ready to reply, was called by a Gentleman, who told him, that
his Troops were ready to march; so that leaving Agapeta's chamber, he
rendezvouzed his glorious Troops, whose glory was sublimated by the presence of
Philarites and the Martial Knight, who seemed to be the Diamonds that set the
great price upon the Golden Ring of that Assembly: from thence they marched
about midnight, and did the next morning arrive at Iris, where they lurked all
night in caves, expecting the enemies landing (whom the boisterous wind had
hindered from landing till then) which was not a tedious attendance; for the
next morning Sotorus, who commanded these Naval Forces, fearing no resistance,
because of the unexpectedness of their voyage, and the covertness of their
designs) did foot the shore, as if he had come rather to triumph than to
conquer; and expected that victory would meet him half way to welcome him to
Egypt: but whilst he was shoaring his Regiments, Megistus giving the signal to
those who were in the other two caves, commanded by Philarites and the Martial
Knight, did so terrify by shouts the surprised Persians, that they wished they
had never seen Egypt, since they saw nothing in it but unavoidable dangers:
That which affrighted them most was some Fireworks, which Megistus (well
skilled in the Pyromanticks) had caused dress, whose noise and lightnings
persuaded the Persians, that Jupiter had lent their adversaries his
thunderbolts, to punish the unjustness of their quarrel: they saw nothing
because of the darkness and the smoke, but what the light of these flames
discovered to them, which was nothing else but Death in all her pontificals,
and arrayed so variously, as that she seemed not the same everywhere; in one
corner of the field valor was punishing resistance, and in another, courage
was trampling under feet cowardishness; here the soul was flying out of the
body at a wounded head, and there at a wounded heart, and in both, the
afflicted body was volleying the great ordnance of groans at the beloved souls
departure: some sought to seek their graves in the waves, and others, fleeing
death, did meet it at their boats (which Megistus did at the first encounter
fire, as if by these bonefires he would have testified his gracious acceptance
of their visit) Philarites did by his sword subscribe two hundred's pasports
for eternity; and the Martial Knight evidenced, that it was easier to overthrow
Troops of Persians than to combat Megistus alone: Thus these three conquering
Gentlemen, wounded as fast as they could strike, and killed as fast as they
could wound, the Persian souls not daring to lodge any longer in their bodies,
than they were by their swords summoned to remove, one stroke summing up all
the minutes of their process; and the souls themselves most willing to remove,
seeing their appartements falling about their ears; Philarites making breaches
in the ranks, and in the bodies also of those who stood in them, had his sword
bound (as Fencers speak) by the cries of a young Gentleman, who seeing
Philarites ready to strike an aged man (whose courage was in its spring, albeit
his body was in its autumn) called, Noble Knight, pity the father of Arethusa,
as ye shall be answerable to your fair Mistress; this was the young man's
Mistress, whose beauty he imagined all men knew as well as he. Philarites, moved
with his passion, did condonat him his life, desiring him to be debtor for it
to ARETINA, and so secured them both as his prisoners.

The fields were become a perfect landscape of terror, and the greenest pile of
grass was scarleted by the Persian blood: but the Persians fearing both what
they saw, and what they saw not (expecting no relief from the boatlesse ships)
were at last compelled to sanctuary themselves in their enemies mercy, and to
become their prisoners, because they could not be their conquerours; and albeit
the Egyptians would have glutted their revenge with the Persian blood, yet the
noble Knights barred them from that piece of inhumanity; alleging that seeing
War was only instituted to secure Nations from danger, and all just Wars were
merely defensive, (for to recuperate our own, is but to defend our own, and so
invasion, if it be to repeat what unjust enemies have robbed us of, is but a
species of defense; and if it be to rob others, it is no War) that necessarily
all who were killed by the hand of revenge, were rather murdered than killed;
and that to kill those whom they might save, imported that the killers feared
that they durst not coap with them except they were disarmed, and so their
cruelty was not only injustice, but verged likewise upon cowardishnesse; and
that in killing them, they wounded their own interest: for, thereafter all
enemies would by despair heighten their courage, this barbarous custom
compelling them either to fight, or dye; and would oblige their enemies, in
requital, to deny them their lives upon the like quarter: and as all men should
love to save their own life, rather than to cut off their enemies; so all men
should be prone to grant quarters when but once demanded: and if War should by
that means become a mere butchery, few would frequent it, and the number of
cowards would become very bulkish; for, scarce the stoutest of Warriors would
go, where he behoved either to gain the field, or lose his life. This discourse
persuaded the Egyptians to save alive nine hundred captives (two thousand lying
dead upon the place) amongst whom, Sotorus had rendered himself to the valiant
Philarites, and they now remained rather masters of the field, than of much
spoil, and had bootied little besides the ransom of their numerous prisoners.

Whilst they were thus combating, a capricious Mathematician, who waited upon
the Marshal de Camp, fearing lest death should have surprised him before he
minded to die, fled at the first shock, and retired to a little Mount, where he
observed the Battle, as he used formerly to observe the Stars, by the help of a
Telescope, which he carried in his hand in lieu of a Musket; this Gentleman
perceiving Megistus conqueror, posted to Court (being mounted upon a horse,
which, because he was fleet, he had bought to carry him away from any danger,
valuing his fleetnesse for no other reason) hoping, in requital of his news, to
have some donatives bestowed upon him; riding in this equipage faster to Court,
than he would have pursued his enemies, he arrived at last at it, where he
threw himself at his Majesty's feet, describing the Combat to him after this
fashion.

Sir, we marched from this City, as from the point A. (demonstrating all upon a
Paper) by a direct line to the Citadel of Iris, as the point B. whence by a
spiral line, we marched to the Caves of C. where we eclipsed our selves all
night; the next morning, before the Sun came from the Antipodes to our Horizon,
we marched, keeping the figure of a Paralellogramum, conducted by Megistus,
Philarites, and the Martial Knight, who, as three lines, made a glorious
Triangle, whereof Megistus, as General, was the Hypotenusa; in this figure we
marched to the shore, where we encountered the Persians, upon whose bodies we
carved hundreds of wounds, in form of Isoscoles, Scalenunis, and Trapezias.

This discourse was interrupted by an Envoy from the three Knights, who
acquainted his Majesty of their unexpected and complete Victory: Whereupon his
Majesty's Pleasant (perceiving the Kings humor fitted for mirth, and intending
to twit the Mathematician for his pedantry) told, his Majesty desired to
imprison that Persian, alluding to his not understood discourse; which the
Courtiers (whom complacence with his Majesty had gladned extremely) speedily
executed, dragging him away from the Royal Hall in spite of his many tears and
protestations, that he was an Egyptian.

The Victory being completed, Megistus sent to the neighboring Towns and
Villages, desiring all both women and children to come to the shore, that so by
a false muster, he might deter the Persians from landing any more Forces: So
that they who were aboard of the Navy, being destitute of boats and
disappointed (by that numerous, though feeble company, having expected to
surprise the Egyptians before they took the allarm) did now hoise sail, leaving
their hopes buried, and their companions unburied, upon the Egyptian shore.

The King glad of the Victory, and glader that Providence had employed these
Gentlemen (whom he affected extremely) as agents in it, because the Noblemens
ambitious undiscretion was thereby checked, and that heaven seemed to authorize
his inclinations, intended to welcome them with a triumphant reception; which
they fearing, directed secretly this missive to his Majesty, entreating him to
forbear both the honor and envy, which they knew would be linked together.

SIR,
Our advancement to this charge has robbed your Majesty's most meriting
Subjects of an occasion of doing you service; it were unjust that we should
expect any other reward for our service, than the honor of being employed: and
seeing your Majesty's Subjects grudged us formerly that honor, which our birth
and your Majesty's pleasure entitled us to, how will they now pack up a wrong
which they will think wounds their interest more deeply? Be not prodigal, Sir,
of those honors which all gape for, and which ye may confer more deservingly
hereafter upon your own Subjects; for, albeit the vastness of a Kings
treasure, and the unlimitednesse of his power, occasion that no profusion
either of riches, or honors, can be accounted prodigality upon his part, yet
the meannesse of the receivers deserts may make Royal Favors be listed among
the other species of prodigality; and the glorious beams of your favors darted
upon us, will against your Majesty's intention attract the vapors of envy;
and possibly your Majesty's favor may procure ruin to those for whom ye
intend triumphs.


This Letter the Knights wrote, scanning upon what emergents had formerly
occurred; and considering how more vessels were sunk by carrying too large a
sail, than by want of ballast; and how all men contributed thousands of wishes
to destroy the greatest Minions (men being like Pirates who pursue always the
richest prizes, thinking the poorest sort unworthy of their pursuit) and that
high employments are like high places, whose hight makes the hardest head
somewhat giddy.

The King pondering their desire, and reflecting upon the reason of their
disassent, was willing to shuffle up all the projected pomp in a mere
complement, which at their entry to Court he delivered thus in a most obliging
fashion.

Gentlemen, Egypt, whose Ramperts ye have been in this last Expedition,
congratulates your safe Return, and her very Rocks trumpets your Praises, which
is ecchoed by all her Inhabitants. When I conferred that charge upon you, I was
confident, that if the Heavens had any favors in store for us, they would
bestow them by your pure and mir aculous hands; So that we all acknowledge our
selves your debtors, albeit none dare be so vain as to undertake to be your
paymasters.

The Knights making a knee-deep reverence, acknowledged themselves debtors to
his Majesty, who had put that opportunity in their hands, and that these
applauses were the price of his Countrymens blood, who were the only root, from
which all these noble actions stemmed.

But we must return to recreate melancholy-ARETINA (whom Philarites had
confirmed in her jealousy, by not saluting her at his removal from Court;
which he had not omitted, but rather passed by, as an encounter which might
melt his courage, and fearing that she might have kept him from imbarking
himself in a quarrel, to which both his respect to the King, and the purchase
of glory, prompted him beyond resistance: yet she interpreted it according to
her jealous humor, not unlike a person affected with the yellow jaundice, to
whom every thing appears of that color; or rather, like a cacochimick stomach,
which transubstantiates the best of meats in its own malignant humor: for, if
at at any time, love persuaded her that jealousy was a cheater; yet even in
that case love did rather distract, than recreate her; and she being bound to
the stake of jealousy, love by these pulls, did not pull her away, but rather
pull her to pieces; like a traitor bound to two horses, whose contrary motions
are his funest torments: thus love and jealousy, like two twins, aguued by
their discord their comfortless Dame.

Yet in fine, ARETINA (perceiving what indefatigable correspondence was kept
betwixt Pinasa and Placeta, and how lavish Placeta was in her invective
discourse against Philarites, whom Pinasa so much adored) resolved to fathom
this design; whereupon, enquiring diligently where they conversed most, found,
that their ordinary appointments were in an Arbor, in the Royal Garden, at
five a clock every morning; so that she at last, hit at this expedient for the
discovery of this their mysterious correspondence.

She caused the Gardener (who was commanded by Agapeta to obey her in every
thing) enter at two a clock, taking her maid with him, and there dig a hollow
in the ground, where her maid was to lie; which he was thereafter to cover with
a sheet, leaving a rent in the coverlet, whereby she might suck in new supplies
of air, and to straw it over with roses and violets, as if they had been placed
there to dry at the Sunshine; that place being near the Arbor, she could not
but hear all was spoken; neither did the heavens disappoint her wishes, for at
five a clock entered the two Correspondents, who being seated within the reach
of the maids hearing, Placeta deduced to Pinasa the whole story of ARETINA'S
misfortune, dwelling upon every point, as an infallible testimony of her own
sagacity; and in the epilogue of her discourse she demanded money to satisfy
the roguish Scrivener; who, seeing he sold his soul, intended to draw a
considerable price for it: Pinasa sucked out the honey of ^ontentment from
these poisonous flowers of their discourse, and glutted her ears with so
pleasing a narration: Thus they fat drinking the dregs of ARETINA'S affection,
and ^dmiring sometimes their own conduct, and sometimes their success, saying
that Country Maids were an easy prey to such Eagle spirits as were Court
Ladies; and that such a rich herb, as Cunning, could not grow in so poor a soil
as was a retired hermitage:

This discourse ended, they returned to a feast prepared for Placeta, leaving
both time and opportunity to ARETINA'S maid, to return home to her Mistress,
fraughted with these unexpected and welcome enquiries; where she found her
Mistress sitting, as if her soul had bidden her body adieu, and had left it like
an appartement without an indweller, her hands crossed, as if she would in that
emblem have represented the crosses of her innocent life: at her maid's entry
she raised her eyes, like a person whose head being upon the block, starts up
once more to see if a pardon can be expected. Her maid unwilling to torture her
afflicted Mistress, by twisting new delays, falling on her knees, and throwing
her eyes upwards, as if she would have bestowed them upon heaven, as a requital
for these favors, said, Madam, Philarites is not unconstant, but Pinasa is a
cheater; so she spun out to her the whole web of their discourse, so exactly,
as that ARETINA by the help of what her memory furnished her from the Letter,
and from Placeta's discourse, did easily piece up the whole progress of their
hellish treachery.

ARETINA (who would not unvail her resentments in presence of her maid) desired
the curtains might be drawn, for she intended to sleep, and commanded the door
should be shut. The maid being removed, she accused her self thus for her
former jealousy; O unworthy ARETINA, seeing thy credulity has declared thee
such! Was it not enough that thou might be vicious by one of those vices,
which could reach its poison only to thy self, without harboring a vice that
stained the repute of such a spotless person as Philarites? was neither his
fame, nor thy experience, antidotes sufficient against that venom of
jealousy? How dare thou place his portracture in so polluted a room as thy
polluted heart? and if fate convoy him to paradise in the chariot of some
glorious enterprise, there to punish thee for thy crime, and reward him for his
virtue; who shall absolve thee from that guilt which thou have contracted? and
if he pardon thee, that will evidence his goodness, but not thy guiltlesness;
and his very smiles shall be thy continual accusers. Whilst grief was thus
triumphing, love replied, that she was not so culpable as she alleged; for,
^^alousie was at worst but an excess in love, and excess is not accounted so
heinous a guilt as defects were; seeing excess had all that was to be found in
the virtue which it transgressed, and superadded somewhat to it: whereas the
defect could frame no title to any of the least of virtues perfections.
Moreover, seeing the greatness of the temptation, was the golden rule whereby
Moralists squared the smalness of the vi^e; that in this case, the
undiscoverablness of their plots min^ed exceeding the guilt of her escape. Lov^
in its plea alleges also, that albeit women's breasts be ordinarily
Cristal-like transparant, yet she had not blazed abroad her passion, nor his
crime; but had chosen rather to sit destitute of comfort, than to receive
comfort from one whom she behoved to make conscious to her griefs, and his
escapes; and how that Philarites himself had been a builder in this Babylon of
mistakes, by not saluting her at his departure, and in wearing the Livery of
another Lady.

Thus ARETINA loved more now than formerly; resembling in that, a curious
Watch, which runs most soundly when it is first disjoynted, and thereafter
pieced up by a skillful Artist; or the breaches of a besieged City, daubed
thereafter with more strength than formerly, by the wary indwellers: Thus she
spent some restless hours, till sleep truced up a cessation of arm, betwixt
these warring passions.

After two hours sleep (which were not able to defray so much weariness) she
was awaked by the deafning acclamations of a great many street-runners;
whereupon, calling her maid, she desired to know the origin of these
confusions; who told her, That the Persians were beat by the two Knights, and
that Philarites had captivated the Persian General. This report was seconded by
a Letter from Agapeta, who, to congratulat Philarites success, acquainted her
with all the passages of the Victory.

The next morning Philarites (the lungs of whose love could breath no air
contentedly, but what they sucked in ARETINA'S presence) sent Kalodulus, to
learn if he might have acc^ss to ARETINA'S chamber, which being indulged him,
he came, circled in his passage by the joyful Egyptians, and being entered,
and the servants removed, spoke thus, with a majestic (and yet discomposed)
air.

MADAM,
That arm which has been so fortunate, as to be employed in your service, and
which your interest has strengthened to the extirpation of your enemies, comes
now, by embracing your feet, to do homage to its divine Princess: the veins of
my courage were filled with no other blood, than that of love; neither was my
sword otherwise edged, than by the whetst^ne of true affection: Wherefore,
Madam, it is upon your head that Victories garland should be placed, and it is
to you that I carry these Bays of applause, which your too civil Compa^riots
have propined me with.

SIR (said ARETINA) if ye had resigned your self over to my disposal (as ye
long since professed) surely ye were too rash in jeoparding a body which was
not your own; and I should think her much mistaken, who would set her heart in
a breast, which ye expose daily to so many hazards. Madam, if I knew (replied
Philarites) that my breast were the residence of such a noble guest, doubtless,
I would be careful of it: yet, Madam, I am confident that if such a heart as
yours were placed in it, the gods would employ their special providence to be a
buckler to it.


ARETINA'S eye traveled along all the proportions of his well limbed body,
whose proportion, his close armor showed most remarkably. But Philarites eyes
dwelt upon each trait of ARETINA'S face, and upon the most negligent motions of
her body, as objects proportionated enough to a man's united admiration, in whom
he perceived all beauties globe mapped up in small bounds. The next morning
their correspondence was somewhat discontinued by Monanthropus arrival, whom
the King had, at Megistus's instigation, recalled to Court. The Knights, at his
arrival, waited upon him assiduously, and their attendance reinvited the eyes
of the Courtiers to behold him, as a person in whom their Nation had great
interest; only Sophander dreamed that his grandour was much ruffled by his
presence, and it would be somewhat minced by the respect which all did bear
him: neither was he much mistaken, for he became the standard under which the
male contents at Court listed themselves, and to whom all true Egyptians made
address; and all concluded, that he was a Comet appearing before Sophanders
destruction: Yet the King vizarded his real love to Monanthropus, and his real
aversion from Sophander, le^t the change should prove as dangerous as it was
sudden; and Monanthropus employed his friends, to desire his wellwishers to
low somewhat, the sails of their nimious respect, till providence should calm
the ocean of their misfortunes.

Prastus finding his hopes stifled, and his designs blasted; and being informed
of Sophanders murmurings, treated with him incognito, to promove his interest;
and in requital, he should, after his conquest of Egypt, be promoted to the
Government of it: and if that project framed not, that he should have the same
charge in Persia which he enjoyed at that time in Egypt. This was a bait at
which Sophanders avarice did greedily bite, and the rather, because he found
every accident prognosticated his ruin; and that his misery wanted only time
to ripen it, Wherefore he did now begin to bend all the force of his malice
against the Egyptian Monarchy; employing the experience of State which he
gained in their service, to do them now some egregious disservice, yet so
covertly as he never seemed to question the Kings affection to him. But
finding, that he was not alone able to manage so bulkish a Vessel as that
enterprise was, he resolved to imbarque with him others, who shared equally
with him in the common enmity which many bore to Megistus and Philarites; but
the plight anchor of his hopes, was Misarites, General of the Egyptian Forces,
who stormed unapeasably at Megistus success; thinking that no man's hands should
have plucked fortunes golden apples beside his own.

Sophander finding Misarites judgment so distempered, by that fever of
passion, thought it fittest to engage him in that quarrel, in which his
judgment, if once cooled, would never have allowed him; calling him to his
chamber, after he had seen the King spend two hours in private with the Knights,
and after some insinuating discourse, asked him, if he and the Officers of the
Egyptian Army had not reapt a plentiful harvest of rewards, for all the blood
they had expended in his Majesty's service, when strangers did partage amongst
them the booty of honor, which they had foughten for? Sir, (replied Misarites)
your condition is more deplorable than ours, because your loss will be
greater, we having less to lose than you; and our happiness is consistent
with theirs, their aims levelling at higher Offices than ours: but your
Eminency and they cannot stand together, seeing they desire to stand upon that
ground whereon ye stand now; yet your condition is most to be pitied, because
your hands have planted these Ciens, whose flourishing branches umbrage this
day your greatness, shading you from these rays of your M^sters favor which
reverberated formerly upon you; and by their roots sucking from yours that
aliment of treasure which fed you hitherto: and to conclude, that is the
greatest unhappiness imaginable, to have been once happy; and the greatness of
the fall is measured from the height of the place fallen from; and seeing, Sir,
here is no real happiness or unhappiness here, but what stands in comparisons
(absolute happiness being entailed upon the gods, and absolute unhappiness
being the portion of devils) our misfortune will seem but a molehill, in
regard of such a mountain as yours; and men will be so busied in admiring your
fall, that hardly they will eye ours. Pardon me (answered Sophander) your fall
will be more remarkable than mine: for, it is rather a wonder to see me stand
amongst so many Emulators (they being Patriots, and I a stranger; they being
many, and I one) than to see me fall; and oft-times great Oaks which are
top-heavie, will fall sooner under the hand of a storm, than those of a lesser
bulk: but Misarites affronts will weigh more in the balance of some men's
fancies than of others (and that is the greatest affront that the persons
affronted reputes such) and of all men none weigh affronts so heavily, as those
of your profession: for, glory being your main design, your glor^^^ sooner
blurred than ours, and your passions (which are always afloat) are sooner
incenst than ours; vanity (which is necessary in Soldiers) being of all others
passions, the most combustible: and seeing your disaster will have more young men
and gallants to be witnesses to it, it must be more insupportable than mine,
which being at a Council Table, will be judged by some few wise old men, who
prize not much affronts of that nature; and as the glory of a Soldier
glistereth more than that of Statesmen, certainly the foil must be more
grievous: Neither is ambition the vice of my age, old men being rather inclined
to avarice, than panching to ambition; for old men, not knowing by what means
they are able to gain, if necessity urged them to it, are more greedy of it
when they can attrap it, than young men whose strength gives want a defiance;
as also, they know better how hard it is to gain, and rely less upon the large
promises of others, than young men do; and their bodies half transubstantiate
in the earth, seems to be near in kin to gold and silver, which are but cadents
of the same family; We want these sparkls of courage which kindles ambitions
fire, which not only burns in younger breasts, but turns all other humors into
its own nature; and that is the sovereign passion in you, to which all the rest
must do obeisance: But why should our spirits be thus enthralled to stupidity?
and why should we sink in this gulf of misery, seeing the arms of our liberty
are yet loose, and the shore of safety is so near? Where is that shore (quoth
Misarites) where we may find a safe harbor? If ye will follow me as your Pilot
(replied Sophander) I shall shore you safely. I will most willingly, replied
Misarites.

Sophander glad that he was able to complicate such a considerable person in
his treasonable plot, devellopped to him the whole mystery, and promised that
if he would go a share with him in the hazard, he should likewayes have a share
in the gains; and promised to treat for him with Prastus, and with Sotorus, who
(being a prisoner of war there) was commissionate for that effect.

But let us now visit Monanthropus and Megistus, who spent their time as
frugally as their adversaries, and who were countermining all their mines, and
cantoning their friends and associats, so that most of their exercise was
discourse, and most of their discourse was the revolutions, whereby the heavens
preached perpetually the instability of humane affairs. Monanthropus desirous
to hear the sequel of the Knights travels (begun at his house) entreated
Megistus to pursue it; and Megistus, to divert the eyes of his memory from
gazing on desolations ghastly colors, condescended to spin out that thread to a
greater length, and commenced thus.

Sir, after the foundation of Philarites acquaintance and mine was laid at
Athens, and its fabric (cemented by assiduous familiarity) was raised to some
height, we resolved to ramble up and down the world, carving always to our
selves an adventure by our hungry swords; wherefore, discharging our trains at
Athens, we desired Kaledulus only to attend us: and beginning our journey
toward Lacedemon, we were outed of our way, by a mist which led us to a
Wilderness; where we had not traveled far, when a cry or two (sent from the
lungs of affliction) commanded our admiration to follow its tract; we posted to
it, knowing that anxieties glass runt swiftly, and at our coming, found a
young Gentleman and a Lady staked to a tree, looking every moment in the face
as the harbinger of death, and tearing in such abundance, as that had they
remained in that posture but a short time, the tears would have rotted the
cords wherewith they were bound; our compassion had scarce fastened its eyes
upon them, when we were necessitated to place them elsewhere: for, two naked
men, covered with nothing but with their hair (a garment lent them by dame
nature, their appear and stepmother) not so much out of affection to them to
cover their nakedness, as out of respect to the beholders, and to oblige their
modesty) did by their uneven brows (which were to them in place of tongues)
cartel us to a combat; their arms were two long poles, to which were fixed two
shables (neither did they offer us choice of arms) we judging gallantry but a
nicety, where necessity was the quarrel, and considering that they who were
outlaws to Nature, might be punished by any of her subjects, (all men being
commissionated against such common enemies) and that they who would not kill
such rascals, were guilty of the blood that was shed by them, resolved to make
use of all arms, and arm our selves with all advantages against them, Whereupon
Philarites pulling out a pistol, sent from its barrel two balls, clothed in
deaths livery, and by them opened a salley-port to his soul to fly out of that
nasty prison, wherein it had been too long captivated; his comrads courage fell
with him, and deaths horrid face represented in the mirror of his dying
friend, agasted him so, as that he was willing to ransom his life upon his
knees with tears, which fear had commissionat to intercede for him; We who
thought that to kill a man before he was prepared to die, was to murder the
soul as well as the body, desired him to throw away his weapon, and he should
have quarter: but he not accustomed to hear such a dialect, understood us not,
so that we were forced to make a demonstration our interpreter; he no sooner
understood our mind than he disarmed himself of his weapon, throwing his body
open to our mercy; we advanced, but scarce could perceive in him the relics
of humanity, which was all mudded over with the rubbish of desuetude and
cruelty, and his tongue expressed it self as if it had but freshly come to the
school of the world; whereupon Philarites concluded, that seeing he and his
companion could understand one another, that the bruits did use possibly an
ideom peculiar to themselves, as well as these, whose expression claimed
affinity to that used by them; or, if they had no language, they behoved to
read each others sentiments in the characters of thoughts, like the intuitive
knowledge of Angels.

We untyed the naked couple, who took their life as a donative from our hands,
upon whom fear had made such an impressa, as they could not believe but death
had them still in its claws. We desiring to pull up that poisonous herb by the
root, fearing lest it might thereafter spread and pullulate afresh, resolved to
know where he nested; he would willingly have quit us, yet in obedience rather
to fear than to us, he led us to a cantone of the Wilderness, and showed us
there a hole, whereat he entered; it seemed to be hells porch, and its very
stink (occasioned by the boiling of man's flesh) did fortify it sufficiently
against all humane approaches; he called forth at last his wife, and I must say
he was fitly matched: for, her face was a rendevouze of all those deformities,
that a petulant fancy could have excogitated, and, except in the case of an
Incubus, he might have defied all the world to make him a Cuckold: We learned
at last, by a discourse composed of semibrievs and crotchets, that she and her
husband had lived there fifty years (death having forgot that there lived any
mortals in such a corner) and that their son was killed; We looked in, and
perceived that the hole was all pent up with wood, and that their best cheer
was man's flesh: So we brought them along with us to the next Town, where
those two lived whom we had released, and committed them to the public prison.

Thence our inclination (which was the compass by which we steered) led us to
Lacedemon, which was then the stage whereon Fortune acted all her Tragedies.
This Nation had pilgrimaged through all Governments, and seeing it could not
unload it self of Rules heavy burden, it did, like the Ass, fetch it from
shoulder to shoulder, and so, contrary to its expectation, past from evil to
worse, and from worse to worst of all; We had not marched but two days journey
in this Lunatic Country, when we encountered a fellow whose eyes sparkled some
of that folly which was breasted within him, and by the inorderly Index of his
face, we might easily know that the volumn of his thoughts could not but be
confused; his equipage was so mean, that he resembled an old Oak, whose starved
leaves had fallen away from the stock which was not able to al^ment them, to
which the obdured earth denied the pension of its ordinary aliment; his motions
showed, that they received no commission from a rational soul, and were like
the reelings of a ship, whose rudder the careless Skipper had abandoned: thus
did he by his inconsiderableness render himself considerable, and made us
notice him, merely because he was not worth the noticing; he past by us,
without giving us a hat, or paying a reverence; and glancing over his shoulder,
he said, Friends, think ye who shine so upon earth because of your diamonds, to
shine in heaven, circled with the rays of divine splendour? or, dream ye that
heaven will suffer your pride to pass unpunished? Ye are mistaken (replied
Philarites) for gorgiousnesse in apparel betokens much humility; for, we
think, that we need such weights as these, to be put with us in the balance of
such capricious fancies as yours, else we might fear to be judged but light;
whereas ye imagine that your innate worth is able to create respect enough for
you: and I pray you, seeing the gods have not created these diamonds for our
aliment, surely they have created them for our ornament: and we see how they
have variegated the fields with flowers, and have enammeled these flowers with
diverse colors, whereby our pleasure might be baited, as well as our
necessities supplied; neither certainly, would they have left man (who is the
most excellent amongst all the creatures) naked of these ornaments, if they had
not given him reason and fancy to be his provisors, and the whole earth to be
his magazine: Neither must we confine ornaments to the narrow bounds of
necessity, else why tax ye not the gods likewise of superfluity, for having
spangled the heavens with so many and so various stars and constellations,
seeing they might have supplied their rooms by two or three Suns or Moons? And
Sir, had not these eye-dazling creatures, the Diamonds, concealed by their
absence some portion of their makers glory, if they had still been intombed in
the earths dark bowels. Well friend (replied he) since I cannot convince you,
who lies swadled in the cradle of your folly, and understands not these true
mysteries, go read Grandours Epitaph in the person of Ephemerus, who was not
long since Prince of this Country, and is now hunting near-by, followed only by
two servants; Whereupon he paced away, leaving us puzzled in what rank of
creatures he was to be placed.

He being gone, Philarites marked that of all madmen, those were most
fortunate, whose madness resembled most the humor of the Country where they
lived; as for instance, Seeing the Lacedaemonians were ordinarily most
superstitious, that therefore that madness which was allied with most
superstition (as in that poor fellow) was least discernable amongst them, seeing
the Natives being inured to continual superstition, would not remark its excess
so easily, as they would the excess in any other passion: and on the other
hand, strangers who perceived such extravangancies, would rather list them
amongst the inclinations of the place, than account them real fits of
distraction.

This discourse was scarce at a period, when we overhyed Ephemerus, whose mean
equipage and thin train overpowered our admiration; and now our voyage seemed
to us admirations ladder, in which the higher we mounted, we discovered always
the more; but we concluded that our amazement was now in its Zenith, and could
mount no higher; for, in him, we saw the Mapps of fortune and misfortune both
in one Carte, and this Gentleman seemed to be a Skeleton, of whose bones, the
State-Ravens of his own faction had picked all the flesh of honor: We
associated our selves to him, to try whether those qualities which are often
admired in eminent persons, be real, or if they be occasioned only by the
sunshine of power; and after some discourse we found, that he stood more
obliged to his birth, than to his parts; and that he had been heir to his
fathers office, rather than to his endowments; and that, albeit amongst bruits
the young resemble the old, because there is nothing in them, which is not
propagated, yet amongst rational creatures it is otherwise; because the soul
is not kneaded of any corporeal mass; and Philosophers allege, that oft-times
the wisest fathers, having evaporated either in action or contemplation their
finest spirits, beget the simplest children, who seem to be the lees of so fine
stuff. We may see, said Philarites to me thereafter, that albeit in all other
visible objects, the higher any body be placed, it appears so much the less,
yet in State-preferment it is quite contrary; for all the faculties of a person
seem aggrandized by his promotion: and that in the Comedy of the World, the
habit of a King or Prince neither improves nor impairs the real habilities of
the Actor. This Gentleman talked of hunting, as if it had been the only
employment quadrating with true Gentility, and that a Gentleman and a Hunter
were but the same thing diversely expressed; Whereupon I (willing to tilt a little
in discourse with him) alleged, that of all exercises, it was the least
subservient to our necessities, and that Fencing or Riding might possibly be a
buckler at occasions to a man's life, and might fit the users of them to serve
their Country; but that Hunting was useless to its users, and destructive to
the Country where it was most used, by trampling of corns, and alienating the
inclinations of Gentlemen from their other employments, and that it was of all
recreations the most destructive to the health; for it obliged men sometimes to
ly cold a whole day, waiting for an occasion, and when they had found an
occasion necessitated them to move too impetuously and ardently; and at last
the loss of their prey, did ordinarily affect them too anxiously: and
subjoyned, that I conjectured that Hunting was at first excogitated by Princes
and Statesmen, to avocate factious minds from deeper projects, and to divert
them from projecting any thing to the prejudice of the State.

Being wearied of his society, from which nothing could be reaped, We retired
to the City of Lacedemon: where there were so many and so contrary tides, as
that it was dangerous for the strongest vessel to sail safe in it. Amongst many
other slaveries, the people complained much of the too frequent change of
State-officers (this Commonwealth being like the Moon, which never appears
twice with the same face) whereby the people were charged with miseries: for,
those who were newly installed in their Offices, did like the empty
Lochleeches, suck themselves full; and those who were not in charge, were
continually plotting the extirpation of those who did officiate; neither could
they know how to govern before they were removed from the helm of Government.

Amongst many other passages which occurred during our residence there, I
cannot forget one, which was this; An old fellow which had outlived his wit,
became so witless as to fall enamoured of a young Girl, who lived at our house,
and now all his spirits, which age seemed to have beaten from all the other
posts of his soul, retired themselves to the citadel of his fancy, and being
garrisoned there, gave old age a defiance. In order to his design, he mustered
all those old suits, which had been witnesses to his first Nuptials, which now,
because of their mustiness, were as grayhaird as himself, and piaffed daily
before our windows, possessed by this devil of love; and imagining that he was,
not what really he was, but what really he would have been: at last, having
leagued with confidence, in a war defensive and offensive against prudence; he
entered the chamber, where the young Gentlewoman was attiring her self, where
having, by the help of his staff, made an antic reverence, he complemented her
in these words.

Lady, all the time that I have spent in the world, has been spent in
remarking that there was never any so beautiful as you are; and all these
wrinckles which ye may perceive in my face, are caused by the heat of my
passion; as we see the fire contracts and furroweth the parchment. And albeit
my age and your youth are of a different temper; yet we see that things of most
different, yea, and of contrary qualities, when separate; yet do, when joined,
piece up the most excellentest compositions: and strings of the most various
sounds, echoes the sweetest melody: these hairs, which seem gray, are not dyed
of that color by age, but by an accident; and my weakness (which was blazed
lately abroad) was not the effect of my decrepedness, but of sickness, against
whom none can plead exemption: If there were any to quarrel your beauty, or to
account it but second to anies else, ye should see (fair Lady) that there is
abundance of blood barrelled up in these veins; and that in this heart there is
courage enough to hazard it in your quarrel.

A young Gentleman (one of her Suitors) stepping in, and intending to twit his
folly, said, Fair Lady, ye may believe him anent your beauty; for, whereas
others can only adduce two eyes, as witnesses to prove their opinion, he can
bring four: for I remarked him yesterday in Church, bestride his nose with
spectacles, that by them he might perceive, what his eyes could not. The old
Gentleman (like a lamp which albeit it be almost extinguished, yet when
irritated by a breath of wind, will flame something more than ordinary)
breathed nothing but revenge, and would fain have honored his sword with such
an employment; but its sheath and it had of so long a time been inseparable
companions, that it was very hard to separate them; and rust had so glued them
together, that his old arms could not pull it out. The other taking advantage
of his misfortune, cried aloud, Oh he has killed me, he has killed me! which
cry rendevouzed us all in the chamber, where we found the old Gentleman dashing
his sword against the walls, because of its disloyalty to its master.

This affront did not wean him from the breasts of his amorous folly: and seeing
age was the occasion of his folly, the older he grew, he behoved necessarily to
be the more foolish; so thinking himself too far advanced in this river of
passion, he resolved to swim, though with hazard, rather than to retire, though
with ease.

The next morning, equipaged like one whom we see presented in Taliduce, by
some Antiquary, he presented himself at his Mist^isses chamber door, where
being licentiate to enter, he thanked the gods, who had arrested his sword
yesterday in its sheath, lest he should have contaminated her chamber with the
blood of so base a fellow; and continued to persuade her, that it was neither
his weakness, nor the rustinesse of his sword, which had occasioned the
difficulty to unsheath it, only he acknowledged, that after a combat which he
had fought not long since, he had forgot to wipe it clean of that blood,
wherewith his adversaries wounds had besmeared it. The Gentlewoman applauded to
all, telling him, that his sword looked like a blade which had been Actor of
many Tragedies, and that she remembered only to have seen one of that fashion,
which her grandfather kept as an old monument of his family. I heard, Sir,
(continued the Gentlewoman) that in a combat ye had all these teeth shaken out
by a blow, which we perceive ye now want; and that another blow, whilst ye were
rescuing the Royal Standard, left in legacy with you that infirmity, which is
perceived in your march. The old man, who dreamed that all these discourses
were the relations of these whose friendship he had bought, accorded to all,
confirming her fictions by some circumstances; which busk rendered these
fictions yet more ridiculous. Weary at last of his impertinency, she entreated
him to hear her read a part of a Romance, which had come to her hands lately;
but she had scarce spent half an hour in that employment, when sleep closed
those eyes, which saw but dimly when they were open, old men being like
Watches, which the older they are, run always the faster, and must be often
winded-up by sleep; for, their infirm bodies, and weak vitals, must have more
time allowed them to forge spirits, than young bodies require; and Nature,
which hates all transitions from one extreme to another, will inure old men, to
endure death by dying often. Her other Suitor perceiving he was asleep, came
from behind the hangings where he stood, and by a sharp knife cut the ribon
whereby his breeches were tied up, and thereafter retired softly; the old
Gentleman awaked, would willingly have persuaded his young Mistress, that it was
not sleep, but an ecstasy wherein he had been, and that it was occasioned by
the sweetness of her voice, and vivacity of her deportment in reading. The
other hearing that he was awake, came bolting in, as if he would have
challenged the old man for his yesterdayes bruskness, whereupon he rising in
haste, his breeches fell about his feet, leaving his thighs like two leafless
and withered branches, in whose top an Owl nested; or like an Egyptian Mummy
embalmed by Art, which had once been coetanious with the first founders of the
Lacedemonian Walls.

Megistus's relation was here interrupted, by a confused noise which tumbled-in
at the windows; and Monanthropus looking out, perceived a multitude, whose
allarmed-like gestures portended some eminent danger: here, one running did ask
his fellow what the uproar meaned? and yet posted by; for his curiosity would
not wait for an answer: there, another returned laughing, but not telling why:
some through fear, others through curiosity hunted for news: Thus they floated
up and down the streets, raging and murmuring like waters fallen from some high
cataract: At last Kalodulus entering the chamber, told them, that the basis of
that commotion, was a combat betwixt two Persian Captains, who being Rivals in
love, resolved to terminate their debate by the dye of a combat; but though
they wanted not courage, yet they wanted armor (as being prisoners) neither
durst they adventure to seek any from their acquaintances in the City, lest
they should have brought themselves within the compass of State-jealousie; at
last, revenge and love fornisht them this overture, That they should walk to a
Sword-sellers shop, and should look each upon a sword, merely as if they
intended to try them, and that there (which was a remote corner of the City,
and early in the morning) they should make courage Arbiter betwixt them: which
project framed well; for, before any could mediate betwixt them, the one had
lost as much blood as might have cooled him out of that fever of love wherein
he raged formerly, and there were sufficiently many issues opened in their
bodies, at which that unnatural heat might have evaporated.

Let us now return to the Court, which is the Chequer wherein the dyce of
favor alters still the game; and where the Courtiers, like so many Moons, wax
or wane, accordingly as the Sun of Royal Pleasure darts its rays upon them; all
being paved with ice, whereon none can stand because of its slipperiness,
unless they be frosted with fortune, and Court-respect; here all things seemed
to be molded a new, and Monanthropus was now the house of the Zodiac, wherein
the King's fancy dwelt. For Sophander was looked upon as a person whose
ambition towred too high, and who intended to enthronize himself in the
affections of the subjects: the King eyed him as his Rival, and the best of his
actions were construed to be treasonable: Neither was his Majesty mistaken, for
Sophander levelled at nothing lower than the Supremacy of Egypt, and he had now
devoted himself to be a Partisan of the Persian Monarchy; and had, as best
things when corrupted, become always the worst (evil being the privation of
good, and consequently the more numerous the good qualities were in the good,
the more numerous their privations are in the evil) So Sophander was from the
best of friends, degenerated in the worst of enemies, and tasked himself now
with the destruction of the Egyptian Nation; In order to this design, he
endeavored to have Misarites preferred to the conduct of the Egyptian Army,
who had combined rather to mislead, than to lead them; and had undertaken to
ruin them without a Persian sword.

Prastus encouraged by their undertakings, and by the numbers of his Army,
resolved to prosecute the Egyptian War; and the rather, because the body of his
own State did begin to amasse noxious humors, through want of martial
exercise, and was become so plethorick, that it behoved to be let blood of by
the hand of some foreign War: his Army is sent to Egypt under the conduct of
Sotorus (who had been lately ransomed) their landing allarmed the Egyptian
Court, whose fears were fed by Sophanders emissaries.

The King commanded to rendevouze all the solded Forces, who being but eight
thousand strong, were always upon duty, whereby the rebellion of subjects and
the invasion of foreigners were easily cohibited; a lesson which his
predecessor had learned from the late Insurrection: He likewise ordered the
levying of twelve thousand more, which being all bodyed together, were subjected
to Misarites command. Megistus, Philarites, and the Martial Knight refusing any
employment.

All things thus ordered, Philarites resolved to go seek a pasport from the
lovely ARETINA, whom he thus accosted.

Fair Lady, I am come to beg a license to employ that heart and blood, which is
really yours, in the service of your Prince, and to skreen your Country from
its irreconciliable enemies; honor invites me to fight for my Prince, but love
entreats me not to abandon my dear Princess; Yet seeing loves burning-glasse can
inflame at a distance, and seeing my soul, wherever I go, carries always
about with it the impressa of ARETINA, and seeing I can love in the camp, but
cannot be victorious in a chamber, I hope ye will not only pardon my absence,
but commissionate me to be absent; that by my absence I may gather laurels of
peace, and triumphing bays, to crown the head of my dear Princess.

If your heart be mine (replied ARETINA) and seeing ye have gotten mine in
exchange, ye must either go heartless, else stay at home and enjoy it; for I
will not render you yours: for, seeing I live by it, I cannot live without it;
Neither can the King desire you to hazard a woman's heart, whose sex exempts
them from danger; if you be lost, I lose all: And albeit you were absent, the
King will be loser but in a part. Wherefore seeing my loss may be greater, and
my gain cannot equal his; and seeing your interest in me exceeds your interest
in him, I hope ye will not rob me of that ye have once bestowed upon me. This
discourse was continued by a flood of tears, whereof the least was able to
quench the flames of Philarites courage; her sighs, like great ordnances, made
breaches in the walls of his resolutions for her persuasions to enter; so that
like Mahomets tomb, he hovered betwixt the two Loadstones of Love and Courage:
Yet at last the danger of the State in general, and of her father in particular
(whose safety moved upon the hinges of their loyalty and courage) joined with
the reiterated promises of shunning danger, prevailed with her, to permit him
to risk yet that one hazard: yet her love combated her resolutions, and will
and courage fell at variance; neither were Philarites honor, nor her own
interest, eloquent enough to persuade her to relinquish without reluctance, her
first intention, her eyes protested against what her tongue spoke, and
challenged it for transgressing that commission which her heart had given it.

The Trumpets sounding a march to the Army, did sound a retreat from these
amiable caresses, and necessitated Philarites to close that dialogue, which
else he had never closed till death had closed his eyes.

Megistus and Agapeta had all this while interchanged amorous glances, but
albeit their employment was the same, the way was most different: for, Megistus
studied nothing more than to acquaint Agapeta with his design, and Agapeta
studied nothing more than to skreen hers from Megistus, thinking it derogatory
to a Princess to love a Subject: and albeit that Eudoxa ceased not continually
to feed the fire of Agapeta's love with the faggots of Megistus praise, yet
Agapeta smothered all these flames under the ashes of a prudential silence.

Megistus finding himself consumed away by this hectic fever of a languishing
love, resolved rather to die by hazarding a cure, than to languish without it;
and judging this the fittest time to ventilate his passion, resolved to let
something of it fall in his discourse to Agapeta: So having gone to her chamber
as if he had been to bid her farewell before he initiated his journey, after he
had acquit himself of the ordinary ceremonies customarily used in such
addresses, and after servants were removed, he spoke thus:

Madam, since my heart has been so arrogant as to pretend to your love, I have
resolved to expiat its crime in hazarding it against those who hate your
Country, that they may wound it, seeing it has wounded it self, and that they
may revenge your quarrel against me, whilst I am revenging against them the
quarrel of your Country; every drop of my blood, supplicates me to be honored
in your service, and forbids me to dispute the lawfulness of the quarrel, seeing
ye interest your self in it. Madam, albeit I be by birth a King, yet my birth
cannot entitle me to your love, whose worth is a Kingdom preferable to the
whole Globe, albeit it were all ranged under the subjection of one Scepter:
Wherefore, Madam, albeit I be a King, yet in this I accuse my self guilty of
treason against the majesty of your worth, and pannels my self willingly at the
bar of your pleasure. I know I was guilty even in loving you, yet seeing all
Egypt is complicated with me in the same crime, I hope, as in other cases so in
this, the number of the delinquents will procure a pardon for the crime. Yet,
Madam, I am singularly guilty, in having avowed before you my own guilt; which
as none but I could be so arrogant as to commit, so none but ye can be so
clement as to pardon.

Agapeta hearing that he was a Prince, but not noticeing it, as if she heard it
not, resolved not to glut her self with those grapes of love, until the
sunshine of time had ripened them more maturely; yet, lest she should starve
altogether his passion, she returned him this Answer.

Sir, it is certainly the fever of courage wherein ye now burn, which
occasioneth that discomposure of spirit which ye now bewray* for else Megistus,
who is loved by all, would never be so mad as to love Agapeta, who is loved by
none; But, Sir, ye may know, that I am one of the Jewels of my fathers Crown,
and none can dispose of me, but they who can dispose of it; so that I hope ye
will not suffer your self to be so much mistaken, as to shoot at that mark: But
really there is another inconvenience in being Megistus's Mistress, seeing she
who is such will make her self the rival of all those Ladies, who have but once
conversed with you, who doubtless place their happiness in the fruition of
your favor; but, Sir, seeing ye plead guilty, and will make me your Judge, I
shall, as in all other crimes, so in this, make the crime the punishment:
Wherefore, seeing love is your gu^lt, let love be your torture.

As men should shun, replied Megistus, to look on you, because of your beauty,
so they should shun to converse with you, because of your eloquence: every
thing which is either seen in you, or spoken by you, being a snare to entrap
unworthy mortals; who must, in spite of prudence, like flies, flee about the
candle which burns them. But, Madam, my love is no infant passion; for, it
bears as old a date as since my arrival at Court: and albeit the persisting so
long in my guilt, be an aggravation of it (every thought being a new crime, and
every moment forging a new thought) yet seeing I have avowed my passion, I
cannot but avow its birth. Madam, since ye have sentenced me guilty, I beg
fetters, which are the badge of guiltiness. Agapeta knowing what he aimed at,
gave him a bracelet of her hair, which she desired him to take, not as an
approbation of his love to her, but as a reward of his loyalty to her father.

Megistus glad to receive it upon any terms, kissing her hand, went away,
telling her, that he gloried more in that badge of her favor, than he would do
in all the trophies which could be raised for him upon the ruins of the
Persian Monarchy.

The Army was marched, and had left Megistus, Philarites and the Martial
Knight, behind, busied in saluting their numerous friends; their visits
accomplished, they posted after the marched Troops, and in their way the Martial
Knight, in pursuit of a discourse anent the antipathy betwixt the Egyptian and
Persian Nations, fell a chiding Astrologues, because they attributed it to the
variety of celestial signs: these mad fellows (said he) will needs have all
the Watches of National inclinations set by the Sun-dyall of the heavenly
Aspects, as if the Needle of free will were obliged to follow the touch of that
Adamant; and as if the face of the firmament were like those optic chambers,
on whose chamber walls one may perceive what is acted in the streets, to which
their backs are turned for the time; but seeing the humors of Nations varies,
the heavenly Aspects still continuing the same; and seeing those influences are
corporeal, and so cannot affect the will which is merely spiritual, I admire
how men can fancy any influence, where there is no passibility: But why are the
neighboring Countries always most tainted with this natural aversion, more
than the remote parts of the Nations? Is it because the heavens are divided in
shires as the earth is? surely all these are dreams of capricious fancies; and
it is to small purpose that men should vex themselves by enquiring for a reason
of that in the heavens, whereof the reason may with small scrutiny be found
upon the earth: for we know that bordering Kingdoms do always war one against
another; and these Wars are fathers and mothers to that Antipathy; And who
would not hate these who are their successors, who have massacred their
antcestors? and for this reason is it, that in these antipathizing Nations, the
frontier Countries hate most one another, seeing the occasions of fresh quarrels
makes them often purple their fingers in one another blood. And upon the
contrary, the remoter Nations, are ordinarily linked in Confederacies; for
these Nations that border on the remote frontire of the Nation hated, do in
odium of the interjacent Nation, league with those who border upon the other
frontier, So that, that friendship is cemented with the common hatred of both
the averse Nations; and here mystery of State is the heavenly Aspect which
causes this contrariety.

This discourse being ended before the journey, they resolved that each of them
should maintain a Paradox, which, being as weights added to the paices of times
clock, might make it run more swiftly; Philarites being by lot destinat for the
precedence, undertook thus the defense of Vanity.

Gentlemen, before I begin to wade through this discourse, I must rid marches
betwixt Pride and Vanity; and I call Vanity, an high estimation set by man upon
his own actions, and a confidence he has of being able to perpetrate
undertakings above the ordinary reach of humane power; and Pride, that whereby
one undervalueth all that is done by others, quarreling it, merely because it
was not done by himself; and not only esteeming highly of himself absolutely
(as is done in Vanity) but also over-rating himself, when compared with others.
I affirm then, that Vanity is the wheels, whereby honor, courage and triumph
moves: for, if Vanity suggested not to man the enterprise of something
extraordinary, and if these suggestions were not welcomed by generous spirits,
the greatest part of new inventions had been stifled in the cradle of their
first conception; Commerce had never been entertained through want of shipping;
and new discoveries, both of unknown Countries, and useful Engines had never
been achieved; and certainly, men should never rise above their own level, if
they circled their undertakings within the narrow compass of their own
experience: and seeing, in setting a high price upon my own worth, I magnify
the workmanship of the immortal gods, and believes undoubtedly that I am more
obliged to them, than really I am; I think my self, as to them, no more
culpable, than he who acknowledges himself my debtor in a greater sum than
truly he is, should be blamed by me: And further, seeing man's misery, if
sufficiently known, were sufficient to ingu^fe him in the depths of melancholy,
and to ingrain it more deeply of a black color; Certainly Vanity is of
excellent use, seeing it confects sweetly those bitter aigrets, and skinneth
over those deep wounds, which are inflicted by the hand of our natural misery.

The Martial Knight maintained, That Prodigality was no ways to be punished by
the Commonwealth; and that Prodigals in reason, ought not to be interdicted, if
they sowed not their moneys in the furrows of foreign Nations, in which case
only the Commonwealth was prejudged; but that if they spent it within the
territories of the Commonwealth, they could not be challenged; seeing they were
masters of their own, and seeing the Commonwealth was not endammaged, but
rather advantaged; seeing their money came in the hands of frugal men (for such
are ordinarily those who fleece these sheep) who might improve it more to the
public utility; and if persons of vast estates deborded not in such
extravagancies, they would in fine coffer up all the moneys of the Kingdom, so
that poor Artists, and others, should be totally impoverished; (for the
superfluities of the rich, are the granaries of the poor) and these who were
once rich, might presume, knowing that they would not be licentiated to
dilapidate; and poor (though ingenuous, and ingenious persons) might despair,
if they had not such crumbs as these to feed on: but by Prodigality, treasure
runs like the Sea, to the water-sources of poor Artists, and from them, by the
frugality of others, returns back again to the ocean of Noblemens treasuries;
by which circulatory motions, the fabric of the Universe is maintained in the
one, and the fabric of the State is entertained by the other.

Megistus maintained, That there was no Adultery in the case where the husband
allowed his wifes imbracements; and that it was only the husbands dissent,
which made the wifes consent be reputed Adultery: for, said he, all the
precepts which concern man, may be dispensed with, by man; for, seeing the great
Legislator has only made these Laws which terminate themselves in man's
advantage, to be bulworks to him against the malice of others, it appears that
where there is no wrong done to him, the Law introduced in his favors cease;
and as, if there had never been fear of wrong, surely the Law which punishes
that wrong had never been statuted; even so in the case where the party that
only can be offended, remits the offense, there the Law cease, because its
occasion fails: And albeit in crimes once committed, the Lawgiver may
pursue, albeit the party offended desist; yet that is where the crime was once
committed, and where the committer hazarded upon the fact, before he had the
parties offended consent; and so, as he contemned the Lawgiver, as much as he
offended a private subject; the Lawgiver may insist, albeit the subject
desist. And, as in the case of theft, the Magistrate may punish the stealer,
albeit none concur with him; yet before the theft is committed, if the person
whose goods are taken, consent, there can be no theft; even so, if the husband
before the Adultery allow his wifes familiarity, he cannot be said to be
wronged: neither can ye obtrude here, that the wife has chained her self to
her husband by an oath, which adamantine chain, the weak hands of a husbands
consent can never break; this, I say, cannot be obtruded here: for, seeing this
is an oath only, and no vow, the immortal gods are not parties, but witnesses
in it, (for a vow is only where the thing promised is made merely or mostly for
their honor, which cannot be said here) and so the person in whose favors it
is made, may favor the maker so far, as to dispense with it. Nay, but (replied
Megistus) both the Gods and the Commonwealth, are interested in what is
enjoined by that Law (which seems to be one of those Laws which was made in
Natures first Parliament) and are as much parties as is the husband; for, if
husbands had the keys of that Law put into their hands, they would open a door
by them to all wickedness, and would feed the greedy appetite of that monster,
Lust; and the souls of creatures, and hearts of subjects, would be so stuffed
with this base passion, that no room should be left either for virtue, or
gallantry; and the gardens of men's souls should be so overgrown with this
spreading hemlock of corruption, that no ground should be found to sow in,
either the roses of piety, or lillies of generosity: and albeit ye combat
stoutly with the weapon of the husbands consent, yet ye shall never be able by
it, to wound one who is covered with the armor of reason; for that husband who
would by the hand of his own folly raze down the ramparts of his own honor,
and by the mire of his madness pollute the wel-spring of his private
satisfaction, might justly be reputed mad and demented, and his consent might
be accounted as ineffectual, as it is unreasonable, and so to operate no more
here, than the consent of madmen does in Law elsewhere.

They were arrived by this time, at the place where the Army had encamped for
that night, and were welcomed by the applaudatory acclamations of the
Soldiery, each one esteeming them the coals by which the green wood, for their
unexpert courages, behoved to be kindled; and their enemies themselves (who
were rather rivals of their success than enemies to their virtues) acknowledged
them both the patterns and patrons of true gallantry. After they had tendered
their respects to the General, they retired to their own Tents (which their
servants had already stretched out for them) and thereafter Megistus exercised a
Company of foot in the face of a Regiment, teaching them by what he did, what
they should do, and disciplinating those who dreamed formerly, that War was
only a flash of artless courage, and that all its precepts might be summed up
in that one, of not running away.

Misarites much dissatisfied, that applause should have so hugd these Knights
in its arms, and that all should be so much beadsmen for their success, sent a
Gentleman to acquaint them (as if in a friendly way) that the Officers of the
Army frowned exceedingly to see their own eggs hatched by others. Megistus could
easily have unridled a greater mystery than this, and conjectured instantly
that emulation was the sender of that Embassage; whereupon they retired to
their Tents, but so prudently, as that none could perceive their design in
retiring. Where the Martial Knight (to dissipat these clouds of passion which
were already conglomerating in the firmament of Megistus face) undertook this
subsequent relation for their divertisment. I lodged, said he, with a Merchant
in Alexandria, whose wife thought her self the widow of a living man; and so
settled her fancy upon a pretty youth, her apprentice, upon whom she conferred
those respects which she denied her husband; to whom, albeit she could not in
reason, yet she did in fancy, marry her self; and with whom she spent those
amorous hours which she could steal either from her husbands assiduous company,
or the youths numerous employments; but when the husband was abroad in the
Country, then they reaped the harvest of these pleasures, which they gleaned
only at other occasions, and feasted upon those amorous delicacies, which they
could only use as desert at other times: But that I may abridge my story, it
happened one day that the husband was by his employments called to the Country,
telling his wife that he would not return of a fortnight; so that they had the
reins of their pleasure laid upon their own necks, and thought an occasion to
sin was enough to authorize them in sin; but whilst they are in bed together at
twelve a clock of the night, the husband wearied with his journey, and
disappointed of his projects, returns home, and knocks at the door; the wife
conjures her Gallant not to budge, whilst she was opening the door to her
husband, which he condescended to, rather to satisfy her, than his own reason:
the door was opened, and the kind wife caresses most affectionatly her wearied
husband, telling him that it was pity the husband should toil so, in amassing
means and money for their wives, who sucked the honey, albeit they brought not
home the wax; but said she, Sweet-hart, providence has led you home this
night, that ye might be a target to the innocence of your importuned wife,
whose honor your apprentice has often and most passionately assaulted; so that
in him ye keep a fox at home to devour your own hens, and this night at one a
clock (which is not now far off) I trysted him in my chamber, resolving to
entrap him; but seeing ye can manage that employment with better success, I
entreat you go to my closet, and put on my clothes, and meet him at the door
in that way which he deserves: The honest husband smiling at the conceit,
undertook the conduct of that business; and retiring himself to her closet,
opened a door to the Gallant to escape, who having shifted himself in his
clothes upon the top of the stairs, returned to act what the wife had promised
in his name; and he grating the chamber door, was answered by the husband; the
door was no sooner opened, than our Gallant buffets the poor husband most
sadly, calling him disloyal base whore, and unworthy to be wife to such a
civil Gentleman, as was his master; and that it was not to satisfy his lust,
but to experiment her integrity, that he had thus courted her to a parley. The
master surfeited with blows, and satisfied both with his wife and servants
candor, desired him to leave off to strike him, or revile his wife; but the
other continued his rage, till, as he alleged, the wifes cries deciphered to
him his mistake; and then embracing his master, did, after a full information,
beg pardon upon his knees for his error: which both of them promised not only
to pardon, but also to reward.

Megistus and Philarites had that morning, been comparing the rise of their
several affections to their Mistrisses, and each disputed the precedence to his
own; Philarites seemed to have fallen into a burning fever, and Megistus love
had crept upon him like a hectic: wherefore they resolved to submit in this to
the Martial Knight, who commanded Megistus first to plead his cause, which he
obeyed thus.

Sir, Nature, which is equal and proportional in all its periods, seems to
ominate a speedy death to that which has a speedy birth; and it is probable,
that that heart of straw which flameth soon, will not flame long; and those
creatures whose nativity is ruled by the Almanac of a night, or hour, may
expect to meet with their climaterick the next day: whereas that passion which
resembles the Elephant in its slow^paced conception, may probably resemble it
likewise in its admired bulk, after that it is once conceived: and that love
which like the Heart, lodges so long in the belly of its dam, may like the Heart
prove long-lived after its arrival to the world: and those impressions which
are made upon the ashes of a soon-inflamed soul, may be easily obliterated;
whereas the obdured marble of a resisting spirit, will hardly suffer ever its
impressions to be effaced; and seeing love should stand upon the basis of
reason, the broader that basis is, the longer love will stand; and that soul
which resists longest by reason, will persist longest by constancy.
Philarites contended thus:

Sir, the purest air is always soonest inflamed, and enlightened by the rays
darted from the Sun, and those are but foggie and misty vapors which resist
its illuminations; it betokens a body wet with the dull phlegm of stupidity,
not to be presently heated by a vast fire: and those spirits are not powder
fitted for the war of generosity, which cannot kindle at the first touch: great
beauties are like the Sun, which spreads its beams all in one instant; and that
is the best eye which discovers immediately all the excellencies which are
discoverable in the objects.

Both parties having closed their plea, the Martial Knight adjudged victory to
both: for (said he) Cupid confines not himself to one way of gaming, and all
his shafts may be equally good, albeit they wound not equally soon; and the
bodies may be equally resistant, albeit the darts pierce not equally deep: for,
the difference may, and does often proceed from their being better or worse
armed, either by indifferency, or inanimadvertency; and albeit the Sun be the
same still, yet its heat is not still communicated after the same manner,
because of the nearness or other position of the body, which should concentrate
its beams.

The Army next morning marched, each expecting that week, once to cope with the
Persian Forces, who besieged the Citadel of Iris, and were like to conquer it,
because of the paucity of the defendants: Misarites hoping to blunder Megistus
with unsuccessfulness, or else willing the Persian (whom he now adored) should
possess himself of that strength, commissionated him to march thither with two
thousand foot, to try if he could by any means rescue that place, whilst he,
and the remanent Forces expected there the advancing Troops from the remoter
parts of the Kingdom.

Megistus, accompanied with Philarites and the Martial Knight, obeyed his
Order; seeming to rate as a complement, what they knew was an injury; and
albeit he commanded them to make brick without straw, yet they showed as great
alacrity as if he had furnished them with means proportionate to such an end.
The next morning, they commenced their march, and having at night fortified
themselves in a neighboring marish, they plotted thus to succor the City. The
Martial Knight was to choose an hundred stout fellows, who were to carry
burdens of provenant to the Persian Army, they were to drop in to the Camp by
two and three, as if they were coming to provision the Army, but were enjoined
to value all things so highly, as that there should be but little sold til
their number were complete; and that thereafter, those who were within should
sally out upon that corner where they were lodged, with whom they should
instantly join, and march in to the Citadel, whilst the others were disputing
the event with courage: This undertaking framed prosperously, and the Citadel
flanked with fresh Soldiers, and encouraged by the conduct of the Martial
Knight, was now impregnable.

The noble Knights fearing that the malice and skill of their adversaries at
Court might somewhat (if not altogether) misreport their ingenuous procedures
in that expedition, (malicious spirits being like corrupt stomachs, which can
corrupt the best of viands) resolved to narrate the whole tract of what was
done in a Letter to his Majesty, whereof the tenor ran thus.

SIR,
Justice has unsheathed her sword in your Majesty's quarrel, and in all
probability resolves to defend you once, who has so often defended her: The
prudence of your General commanded the attempt, and the obsequiousness of your
Majesty's servants under subscribing* achieved it; seconded rather by the
benignesse of your fortune, than either by our own courage, or multitude of our
followers. The rescue of the Citadel of Iris, has undertaken the prologue in
the tragedy of the Persian misfortunes, and we hope shall like an usher, hold
aside the tapestry, till the succeeding rabble of their misfortunes enter in at
the same door. This smiling sky, promises a bright sunshine at noon: and we
hope your Majesty shall one day pull with satisfaction the fair fruits of
victory, after these blossoms of success are ripened, by the heat of your
Armies courage; who will, we hope, allye their great valor, to your good
fortune: which is both the expectation and wish of your Majesty's most loyal
subjects,

MEGISTUS, PHILARITES.



Megistus addressed another Letter to the divine Agapeta, wherein he discoursed
thus.

MADAM,
MY reason (befooled with credulity) persuaded me whilst I lived at Court, that
lapse of time, and distance of place, might have effaced some of those
impressions, which the diamond of passion had engraven upon she long resisting
cristal of my love-fearing spirit: but I find now that I have been abused in
this, by my credulity; for I perceive that the wound is not cured by distancing
it from the sword which made it; and that love resembles an impetuous river,
which swells the more the farther it runs from its source; and that albeit
the weakest wit might wade through it near its fountain, yet the strongest
reason is not able to ford it, when it has run farther off. Madam, every
beautiful face which I see, has some trait in it, which proves a remembrancer
to me of those incomparable lines which the Pencil of Nature has drawn in
yours; but they are but dull copies of such an original, and can represent it
in nothing else, besides in making me unfortunate, in beholding that, which I
can only behold and not enjoy. I lie here, tortured by the sharp ague of
passion; sometimes scorched with the flames of love, and at other times frozen
by the cold chillness of despair; and as in all poysonings, so in this, I must
seek the antidote from the same body, whence came the poison. Fair Lady, live
happy, and dart forth one ray of your happiness, to enlighten the darkened soul
of melancholy

MEGISTUS.


Philarites vented his passion to his dear AR^TINA in another Letter thus.

Incomparable Lady,
IF this paper had not been dampt in the floods of my tears, the flames of my
zeal had burnt it to ashes; neither can I but envy its happiness in kissing
your fair hands, a happiness sufficient to border and limit the most
unsatiable of mortals: and so being its rival, I would certainly destroy it, if
it did not promise to acquaint you with the ardour of my respects to you. Oh
that there should be greater distance betwixt this and Alexandria in ground,
than there is in the Map, that so I might see that Sun, with whose shadow I
must now rest satisfied; and that I might adore that Deity, by which I intend
to be saved. Madam, I have sacrificed all the flesh of my parched body upon the
altar of love, and were it not that my soul thought that it could be
serviceable to you in its present dwelling, it would leave that ruinous fabric
wherein it now remains. Madam, be not so unmindfull of him, whose both
happiness and torture it is, that he is too mindful of you; and bestow one
thought upon him, who bestows so many upon you; and who cannot, nor will not
be happy, except in being esteemed, fair Lady,

Your humble Servant, PHILARITES.


Whilst Philarites was dispatching this Envoy, a young Gentleman desired access
to Megistus, which being granted him, he did with a cheerful countenance
deliver his mind thus.

Noble Sir,
ALbeit the desperatnes of my design, might make you eye me, as either
distracted or malecontent, and like one, who being in fear to drown in the gulf
of despair, is content to hang by the smallest twig of comfort that he is able
to grasp to; yet the public advancement of my Nations interest, makes me
overlook all such difficulties, and willing to exchange my own loss with
their gain: for, I think it most reasonable, that one member should rather be
cut off, than that the whole body should be endangered; and especially such a
member as is already in apparent danger of being lost: wherefore, Sir, seeing the
Enemy is to pass this night along a wooden Bridge over the Nile, hoping to
attaque unexpectedly your Camp, I entreat ye may suffer me to enclose my self
in an Arch of it, with some barrels of Powder, that when such a number of them
as your Army is able to encounter, has past along it, I may blow up the
Bridge, and so stop both the passage of those who are not already past, and the
return of those who are gone over. Sir, lest my intruding my self in this
danger, and the horror of the danger it self, should make you think it is
rather treachery than affection which hounds me out to this enterprise, ye
shall be pleased to know, that these ravenous Physicians, who have these two
years preyed upon my fat purse, and practiced all their cheats upon my wasted
body, have at last told me, that my cancer shall at last irrecoverably period
my days: Wherefore, Sir, finding that I could not by Art prolong my days, I
resolved to do it by fame; and to sweeten the harshness of death by the
generous manner of it, that so my parents might have the breath of my praises
to dry up the tears of their compassion; and that by destroying one subject to
my Prince, I might preserve him two thousand; having thus satisfied my reason,
I resolved to satisfy my Conscience, which is that great Controller of all our
actions; whereupon I addressed me to a Priest, my intimate acquaintance, who
persuaded me, that it was as lawful for the Civil Magistrate (whose command he
desired me to ask) to dispose of me for the public utility, as it was lawful
for a private person to ransom his life by the loss of a member, and that such
a generous resolution was a key able to open the gates of Paradise: and if it
was lawful for a man to hazard his life in battle, where he could kill but two
or three; how much more lawful was it to buy the safety of many friends, and
the destruction of so many enemies, with so worthless a farthing as my single
life was?


Megistus having deliberated with Philarites the expediency of this Overture,
resolved to accept the offer: whereupon, having both thanked and encouraged the
young man, having heard that the Enemy was to pass along the Bridge the next
day, he went under silence of night to the Bridge, and opening an Arch thereof,
he enclosed in it the Gentleman, together with some barrels of Powder, and some
Match; and guarded the Bridge with some Soldiers, lest any should carry
intelligence to the Enemy of their intention: The next morning, the Enemy
(according to expectation) appeared in view, which made the two Knights make a
show as if they would fight (for they were now four thousand strong) and
having, after some resistance, abandoned the Bridge, they suffered the Persians
to pass along it, three thousand of them being on this side already,
Megistus caused shoot some Pieces of great Ordnance (which was the signal
condescended upon betwixt the Gentleman and him) and which was instantly
obeyed; for, he having fired, the Powder did, to the terror of the spectators,
and ruin of the passers, blow up both himself, them, and the Bridge, and sent
them all to heaven in a fiery chariot, their bodies convoying their souls half
way, and would have entered the upper spheres with them, if heaven had not
showed its unwillingnesse to lodge such contaminated guests, as bloody
carcasses were: those who had passed over, finding themselves destitute of the
assistance of their friends (who were able to contribute nothing now but their
prayers and wishes) resolved to embrace an honorable death, since they could
not procure to themselves a long life, and to show, that rather fate, than
fearfulness, had occasioned their overthrow; yet courage had its eyes so
dazzled with the unexpectedness of their former disaster, that it could not see
what was fittest to be done in that juncture of affairs; and they beheld their
enemies through the multiplying-glasse of fear, and as those for whom
Providence had displayed a Banner. The Knights assaulted them whilst thus
perplexed, and put in disorder the ill-marshalled right wing; and as ordinarily
those who draw one link of fortunes chain, will make all the rest follow it; So
this partial victory was seconded by a total, and the Persians were forced
rather to employ their tongues in demanding pardon, than their swords in
seeking victory, leaving the two Knights both the victory and the field, as the
recompense of their gallantry:

These news wrought as different effect at Court, as the Sun does upon the
earth, when it causes the roses smell sweetly, and the marshes stink
insufferably, producing effects according to the dispositions of the bodies
wrought upon: Thus all the truly generous spirits at Court shared with these
noble Gentlemen in their good fortunes: (virtuous men honoring true
Generosity, as that whereby they either have already been, or hopes to be
honored) but Sophander and his faction, made the sunshine of their glory,
appear as dapled with some obscure spots, and alleged, that it was intolerable
arrogance in them, who were but strangers, to place the Martial Knight in the
Citadel of Iris, which being a frontier Town, could not be disposed of but to a
native; and that it was the custom of Egypt not to bestow frontier strengths,
either as appanages upon the children of their Prince, nor as governments for
the use of strangers: as also, they challenged them for fighting the Persians,
albeit with advantage, yet without order, Misarites having only commissionated
them to rescue Iris, and no more; and if private persons should follow rather
the dictates of their own reason, than the commands of their Superiors,
Government were unnecessary, and ruin behoved certainly to attend such
disorder: and albeit fortune should make such undertakers victorious, yet it
could not justify their undertakings; neither could the damage which might
ensu^ upon such exemplary contempt, be compensated by the advantage which might
accrue from an accidental victory.

Amongst all their friends at Court, none were so much satisfied, nor esteemed
themselves so much interessed in these victories, as Agapeta and ARETINA, who
kindled bonfires of joy in their breasts, to congratulate their great success;
and albeit they could not then in modesty nor prudence cry up these noble
exploits themselves, yet they respected all those who did it. Sophander, who
had at the council table of his own thoughts, declared himself an enemy to the
Royal Faction, concluded now, that the only way to ruin the King, was to ruin
these noble Gentlemen; knowing that those who would fell a great Oak and pluck
it up by the roots, behoved first to cut the earth about it: to effectuate
which, he bribed a Mesopotamian at Court, to confess the pedigree of his Prince
Megistus, and at last to declare to the King, that he had carried Letters from
him to Agapeta: and now confident of this fellows perseverance in his roguish
business, he addressed himself to the King the next morning thus.

Sir, if my being entrusted by you, the confidence I have in you, and the
experience I have of you, did not imbolden me to unfold to your Majesty such
mysteries of State, as is that which I am presently to discourse of, I would
not dare to dip in affairs of so great importance; and seeing Princes have not
the leisure to pry into all particulars, nor informers either the opportunity
or confidence to give them immediate information of what touches them, I think
it is prudence in Princes to employ Ministers of State to learn, and duty in
Ministers of State to acquaint Princes with what they have learned; and since
all Subjects are tied by their condition, to detect what may wrong the State,
or endanger the person of their Prince, what a strict obligation is laid upon
Minions to disclose to their Masters, what may ruin them and their Subjects?
and albeit there be great danger in being misconstrued by their Prince, yet
expediency should not be disputed in those actions which are commanded by duty.
Sir, this Gentleman, named Megistus, is of a birth rather answerable to the
extraordinariness of his qualities, than suitable to the meanness of his
equipage; his deportment tells, that he is a Prince, and my author confirms me
in it: for, I am informed by a Mesapotamian (whom I have brought along with
me) that he is Son to the King of Ethiopia, and is come to your Court to court
your daughter. Sir, this may seem improbable: yet if we ponder the hazard he
runs in traveling abroad, and the desire parents have to keep their children
under their eye (especially when he is their successor and the expectation of
a whole Nation) your Majesty may think that is not altogether impossible; but
Sir, if ye consider the pains he is at in your service, and the perils he
lays himself open to in a foreign Nation, ye may eye it as probable. And if
yet further, ye examine the correspondence he keeps with your Daughter (which
this fellow will assure you) ye may justly conclude it certain. Where the
danger is great, the proofs needs not be most clear (neither can we expect
plenary probation in those plots which are hatched so covertly) and the fear of
a disease is enough to command its prevention: Neither can there be greater
danger anywhere, than here; for, Megistus being by birth, a Prince; in stature,
handsome; and by fortune, successful; it may be feared that your Daughter will
prefer his bed to that of a subject, upon whom she fears ye will bestow her:
And if once he master her affection, (which is easy where he is so
accomplished, and has so few competitors) she will die, if she marry him not;
or your Crown will be carried to a stranger, if she marry him: Neither lies all
the danger there; for it is to be feared, that if he married once your
Daughter, either your Majesty behoved to nominate her your successor, and then
possibly they will rather hasten than expect your death; or else, if ye do it
not, he may secure himself in your Kingdom, by the assistance of your mercenary
or discontented Subjects, into which two files, all the Commons, and many of
the Nobility may be ranked. Sir, I know he is your Favorite, and so I may be
misconstrued as being thought to to fear that he is my rival; but, Sir, I know
that a Prince will not stay long here to inherit your Majesty's favor, and so
to slight his own Royal Inheritance at home; Sir, it is rather my affection to
you, than my dislike of him, that animates me thus to inform you: wherefore, I
hope your Majesty will endeavor a cure, since you know the disease, and will
not suffer repentance to be your first informer.

This discourse some what allarmed the King, yet considering how often Sophander
had betrayed his belief by such like State-cheats; he resolved to suspend his
judgment, till the matter were fully determined by Mo^anthropus's advice, and
knowing that Sophandor and he were of different humors and contrary judgments,
he knew that such contrary ingredients might make up the dose of a most solid
advice; and that his own judgment, which Sophanders discourse had crooked a
little to his side, might be streightened by Monanth^opus's drawing it somewhat
to the other; and resolved by this means to keep the scales of Court equal, by
placing them each on a side; Wherefore sending for Monanthropus, he laid out
the whole matter before him, who returned him this Answer.

Sir, albeit it was my interest, yet it was never my humor to detract from any
of your Majesty's servants; for, by ranting against their insufficiency, I
behoved to challenge your simplicity in making choice of them. But, Sir, I may
the more freely give your Majesty my advice now, that I never gave you it till
it was desired; and I think, that as in witnesses, so in advisers, those who
intrude themselves, are to be suspected; and the rather, because the person
delated is of so unspotted a repute, that his very deportment is able to answer
all the cavils that his enemies can object against him; and, Sir, since that
accusation is only seconded by a presumption, his generous humor and singular
success (the one whereof testifies his affection to virtue, and the other
whereof testifies the gods affection to him) is able to fortify him against
ten thousand such weak assaults; and the general presumption of all men's being
presumed good (the only hinge of all credit amongst men) added to the
particular presumption of his repute, is too strong a defense, especially for a
defender whom justice owneth always of her client in all actions, and secondeth
in all combats; and we have a proverb, called Suffragium Minervae, whereby we
signify, that if any be accused and the votes of the Judges be equal, the
Defendant is absolved, because that goddess voteth likewise the absolution of
the party accused: And seeing he proves him a Prince, merely by his deportment,
I may by the same argument conclude, that he will do nothing unworthy of a
Prince: but admit he were a Prince, we cannot conclude thence, that he resides
here upon that design; for, else he had never abandoned the Court, where he
might enjoy the frequentation of that beautiful Princess: Sir, it is most
unprobable that he could dream of joining two Crowns which lie at so great a
distance, as lie the Crowns of Egypt and Ethiopia; certainly he knows that by
force he could never subject Egypt to him, and without force Egypt would never
suffer it self to be adjected to Ethiopia; by which course they would forfeit
their Princes presence, and be in fine possibly reduced to a Province;
Wherefore, Sir, condemn not a Prince upon so frivolous grounds, but rather
re-examine your author, to see what more truth ye are able to milk from him.
This motion pleased the King exceedingly, and sending for the Mesapotamian, he
threatened him to profess whether what he had spoken to Sophander, was truth
or not, or was voluntarily informed or not; telling him withal, that he would
cause presently streatch him upon the rack, because he had heard that Sophander
had bought that Confession from him. The poor fellow fearing that all was
deciphered, and begging the King's privacy, he confessed ingenuously the
progress of the whole matter, and that he never heard any inclination which his
Prince had for Agapeta; neither delivered he her any Letters from him; but that
that lesson was dited to him from Sophander's own mouth: but contrariwise, he
knew, that it was concluded by Megistus's father, that he should marry a
neighboring Princess, whose estate was adjacent to Ethiopia, and did secure it
as a frontier, albeit it was but of small revenue, and she of mean parentage;
and he heard at Court, that his father answered those who upbraided him for
bestowing his son and gaining no Allies by him, That marriage could never
solder up the cracks which were in Princes friendship, and that Princes might
be friends, but their Crowns were always enemies. The King satisfied with this
Confession, dismissed him after he had rewarded him, and enjoined to him that
he should never reveal to Sophander what he had acknowledged to him.

Monanthropus, after he was gone, resumed his discourse, thus; Sir, those who
intend to persuade too eagerly, are not unlike those, who fearing to shoot
short of the^r mark, shoot often over it. I am confident, if Sophander had not
been distracted by envy against Megistus, he would never have endeavored to
persuade your Majesty, that a business of so great moment could have come to
the ears of such a fellow as this; but, Sir, since his pretended reason, which
was alleged to be zeal to your service, is now found not to be the cause of
his information, your Majesty may persuade your self that there is some
poisonous hook lurking under that pleasant bait; and ye may justly turn the
edge of your jealousy, which he has desired you to unsheath against Megistus,
against himself; and since Sophander is a stranger by birth, and by inclination
most avaricious, ye have reason to fear his projects, and eye narrowly the
comportment of his creatures, by whose motion ye may come to know the nature of
that machine which moves them.

The King thanked Monanthropus for his advice, and entreated he would tell him
how he behoved to carry himself in a business so ticklish. Your Majesty
(replied Monanthropus) must seem to believe Sophander, and may to him promise,
to narrow your affection, and abridge your respects to Megistus, whereby ye may
the more covertly discover by his advices to you, what his scope is in this his
passion.

After Monanthropus had thus enstated Megistus in the Kings affection, he
acquainted Megistus with what had passed by this Letter.

SIR,
SInce unkindness is a vice, I will not requite it; and albeit I regrate that
ye should conclude me unworthy of half a sheet of paper, yet I shall rather
think my self so unworthy, before I think you mistaken. Your great success
has made all men your admirers, and some your enemies; fearing lest your noble
hands should unwreath that yoke of slaverie which they have so laboriously tied
upon this poor Nation. Sir, admire not that Pirates follow always the richest
Vessels; for, as virtue, which reigns in you, imployeth you as her subject,
to maintain her honor; so vice, which reigns in them, entreats them to deface
yours. Sophander has informed the King, that ye are Prince of Ethiopia, and
intended to court his Daughter, and enjoy his Crown; but I have
counter-informed, and his Majesty is now fully assured of your innocence, and
resolves to rely mainly upon your conduct and courage; So, if ye intend to
gain his Daughter, lose not himself; and manage your passion with more
indifferency than lovers ordinarily do: consider that Kings have long ears,
and many parasits to fill them with detracting clamours* Sir, leave not off to
be a Prince, when ye begin to be a Lover; but since ye are a Prince who loves,
love rationally like a Prince; and let those whom ye are born to rule, see that
ye can rule your self: I know love scorns to live under the tutory of reason,
thinking it too severe a master, and knowing that if it had reason for its
associate, all its victory would be attributed to reason; whereas now it shows,
that it can both war and triumph, not only without reasons assistance, but even
against and over reason: Yet, Sir, seeing the danger is great here, a Ladies
Honor and Crown being at stake, I hope your prudence will deal warily, where
your unwariness may be so prejudicial to her and you both: all the Nobles of
this Nation will band against you, and will think this Crown too large for any
strangers head; and that the Throne of Egypt is too easy a seat for any
besides themselves: And ye will learn by the change of affection in those who
pretend now to be your friends, that love is but the handmaid of interest; and
that as they love you now for their own interest, so they will prefer hereafter
their own interest to your love. Whatever be the carriage of others, if ye
manage these affairs prudently, ye shall find Monanthropus your very humble
servant.


This Letter came to Megistus hands as he was sending away the captives to
Misarites, to be disposed of at his pleasure, and after he had dismissed them, he
did read it, and thereafter retired to his chamber, fearing lest any of the
Soldiers should discover the pangs wherewith he found his soul tortured; he did
now conclude that his love-voyage would be dangerous, seeing at his first
lancing forth he was encountered by such storms; and to admire the folly of men,
who having received freedom as a patrimony from providence, did, like unfrugal
heirs, sell their ancestors old inheritance; their thoughts did no sooner
appear, than love mustering all her forces presently, quelled them, battering
them with no other Ordnance than that picture of Agapeta which Megistus carried
in his breast: Could such a prize as this (said love) be gained without a
contest? and would ye marry a woman whose affection were not tried by the
competition of many rivals? how should her love, or their courage be known,
without opposition? or, can things be deemed difficult when undergone for her?
Ye think both her face and endowments incomparable, and they are so; wherefore,
if ye would proportion your deserts to them, show your patience to be so too;
and think not strange, that virtue, to show the world for their instruction an
example of constancy, should, like all wise teachers, cull out you, who is one
of her prime scholars, to make men admire her skill in your proficiency;
neither can she be so unjust, as not to reward your pains with laurels: if your
voyage be harsh, there is a good harbor attending you* and albeit the storm be
boistrous, yet if the vessel of your resolution be strong, ye need not fear:
fear puts on oft-times the vizard of terror and difficulty upon the face of
our undertakings, to terrify us, which if ye can by the hand of courage pluck
off, ye will find your projects very smooth-faced: seeing ye are entered into
the river of difficulty, look not to the under-running streams lest your head
by troubled, but look over to the shore of contentment, upon which ye intend to
set foot; complain not of the loss of your liberty, for necessity, in things
that are excellent, is to be preferred to liberty: Thus we see our liberty is
no ways impaired by loving the immortal gods, nor by loving that which is
good, albeit we do both the one and the other necessarily; Yea, rather we are
infinitely obliged to them for necessitating us to love something, which
possibly if we were left to the disposal of our free will, we might possibly
relinquish; and these same gods who have bestowed freedom upon us, do likewise
excite us to love: So that seeing love is of a divine extraction, it must be of
a most pure essence: the gods disdaining to put their impressa upon any metal
that is not in it self excellent: and that it is the effect of some divine
influence we may conclude from this, That it were impossible for Nature to
raise instantly such an emotion in the soul as ^^ve occasioneth, whereby it is
transported beyond the ordinary limits of its ordinary strength; yea, often
produces effects contrary to its wonted humor: so seeing it makes cowards
stout, and fools witty, we may infer that this is not natural; for, naturally
no cowards can be stout, nor no fools witty.

Having ended this melancholious contemplation, he called for Philarites, who
helped him always to bear the burden of his grief; and related to him the
whole passage circumstantiated, as he had learned it from the Letter.
Philarites, not a whit dismayed, told him, that at Court the minds of Courtiers
changed fashions as often as their clothes: and as fortune changed oft-times her
favorite, so her favorites changed oft-times their affection; the reason
whereof was not, because Courtiers were of a more facile humor than others,
(for ordinarily they were men of the most pregnant spirits, with which facility
can never suit) but because their affection was never so deeply fixed, as the
affection of those who lived retiredly; for, seeing they had many to bestow
their affection upon, they could not bestow much of it upon all; whereas those
that live retiredly, meeting with few worthy of being beloved, fix all their
love upon those few: Neither was the love of Courtiers unlike an anchor, which
albeit it be great and strong in it self, yet, if it be not deeply fixed, will
be raised by the first storm; As also, mis-informers at Court were so many and
so busy, and the jealousy of Courtiers so great, that it was wonder how love
lasted one week even in the most constant among them: And I am confident (said
he) that providence uses the unconstancy of favor at Court, as an argument to
deter generous spirits from places which are ordinarily in themselves most
vicious; And albeit Sophander promised upon our first appearance at Court, to
befriend us, yet it is one of his tenants, That a Statesman should be a servant
to his word, to obey it in a rational way; but that he is not obliged to be a
slave to it, in obeying it in things both against his reason and interest; and
I heard a Gentleman say, that he defended ordinarily, That all State-promises
were no longer obligatory, than things continued in the same way they stood
when the promise was made: for, said he, I promise, because I am informed, or
imagines, that the person to whom I promise is of such a temper; so that if he
be of a different or contrary temper, the condition failing, the thing
conditioned cannot be sought; and since promises are ordinarily donatives,
there is reason the donator should have the privilege of explaining his own
mind; for, seeing they to whom I promise can pretend no right to the thing
promised, but because I willed it; therefore if my will be not clear, their
right is null: and seeing none can be so well acquainted with my will as my
self, none should be admitted to explain it but my self: and ordinarily, so
many and so great inconveniences would follow upon the observancy of such
promises at Court, that there would be greater danger to the Commonwealth in
keeping them, than there could redound to any private man's conscience by the
breach of them: but, Sir, (continued Philarites) think not strange that fortune
should graple with you; for it is her ordinary, never to list her self but
against some noble spirit, whose conquest were worth her pains, scorning the
easy victory which she might have over silly clowns: but possibly she intends
to try your courage, which when she comes once to know, she will think you
worthy to be her minion: She can command weak spirits, but great ones are born
to command her: And since the mustering false hopes is able to make a man
victorious, and the basest of men gain oftimes, because others think that their
brags and threats are true; how much more shall the best of spirits (amongst
whom ye may be ranked) become victorious, if they but hope really that they
shall conquer? hope resembles a bridle, whose motion is able to recover the
stumbling feet of our courage; And how many Armies have gained more by
presages, and happy omens, than they could have done either by skill or
numbers? This is the reason why speeches are made to Soldiers; and for this
audacious spirits are usually most fortunate.

This discourse was interrupted by a Letter presented from Misarites, wherein
they were ordered to return to the Camp with those under their conduct; which
they were most willing to obey, knowing that the Soldiery there might easily
be misinformed of what was done at such a distance from them: The next morning
they did begin their march, and being after two days arrived, they were
welcomed by the acclamations of the Soldiers (but coldly entertained by the
Grandees, whom Misarites had poisoned) who, in spite of all misinformation,
admired the rare qualities of these noble Gentlemen: for, albeit it be an easy
task, to defame amongst the vulgar sort, those, whose prime quality is wit;
because their wit, which should antidote all these aspersions, is not easily
perceived by that sort of people; yet it is hard to defame those whose chief
part is courage, because the most ignorant cannot but see that; and ordinarily
the vulgar sort is more led by their sense than by their reason.

Misarites delayed always to fight, pretending that it was fitter to starve
than to fight the Persians; who being far from home, could not subsist long in
a foreign Nation: but his intention was to ruin the Egyptian Army by these
delays, who finding themselves near home, and overburdened with hardship, did
drop away daily. Nothing was acted all this time, except by skirmishes; wherein
Misarites employed all those whose courage was formidable to the Persians, and
whose loyalty was formidable to himself, and many of them were swept away by
this means; neither omited he to entice the Knights with this point of honor,
but all in vain: for they resolved to reserve themselves for archievements of
less hazard, and more honor. Misarites caused likewise mix the meal, which
was sent to the Army with lime and chalk; whereby diseases became both numerous
and dangerous, and the whole Army began to resemble an Hospital, wherein there
was greater need of Physicians than of Field-Officers: He likewise, together
with Sophander, persuaded the King, not to send the Army their pay, assuring
him that poverty was the best encouragement to fight, for it made them fight
courageously, out of a desire to gain the Enemies spoil; whereas those who were
rich, were unwilling to hazard what they were assured of already, for what they
were not sure to gain. Sophanders drift in this, was to reserve the money for
himself; but Misarites scope was merely to turn the Soldiers malcontents:
Neither ceased the Knights covertly to make the Army remark these passages,
thereby to enrage them against Misarites.

At last, Megistus trysting Misarites his Secretary o^e morning to his chamber,
after some previous discourses, whereby he sounded his thoughts, spoke thus
freely to him; Sir, it is not to discover the treason of your master, but to
learn some evident proofs of it, that I sent for you this morning; his complot
with Sophander and the Persian is already detected; and ye are mad who
imbarques your self in such a quarrel, ye walk upon a narrow precipice, wherein
there is great difficulty to stand, and certain ruin if ye fall: think not
that the Gods will suffer Princes, who are their Deputies, and who govern for
them, to be circumveened by such treacherous designs; in vain have they been at
so much pains for the defense of his honor, if they abandon it now: and albeit
it did thrive in your hands, yet after the game is played, there will be danger
in your Master's parting the stakes with Sophander; who will lay him aside when
he finds that in peace he stands not in need of him: But albeit your Master
did enjoy his promised preferment, who knows but he will cause cut your throat,
both fearing lest you should thereafter upon some discontent divulge his
cheats, or fearing that he could not safely thereafter employ you, who betrayed
your Prince? Wherefore if ye desire to perpetuat your happiness, and to prevent
your inevitable ruin, desert that, interest, and own the interest of your
Nation, and I promise you in his Majesty's name greater preferment, than ye are
to expect from your Master; Neither need you stumble at this, as a breach of
trust, and as a sin committed against the affection which your Master bears to
you, for ye should pay the oldest debt first; and ye were a subject to your
Prince, before ye were a servant to Misarites; wherefore ye should endeavor to
acquit your self of your duty to his Majesty, as being both of greatest
importance, and of oldest standing; Neither does your oath of fidelity, given
to your Master, oblige in things unlawful; for the gods will not be witnesses
in things abominable, and there is no oath whereto they are not called as
witnesses; they will not suffer a man to be bound to the stake of impiety by
such sacred chains; and since the thing sworn is unlawful in it self, there
can be no confirmation of it by oath: for, how can ye confirm that which is
not? as also, Sir, all oaths are given with this proviso, that they wrong ^ot
our Superiors; for, our subjection to them not being ours, we cannot dispose
of it without their advice.

This discourse surprised so the Secretary, who entreated some time to advise;
but Megistus fearing that he might detect him to his Master, or at least, might
dissemble with him, told him, that to relate things already done, there needed
no consultation, which was only required to prevent things to come, wherefore
he insisted passionatly for a present discovery; which the other, convinced by
his conscience of his error, and considering that he had already half
confessed the truth of what was doubted, by seeking some time to solve the
doubt, which else had been needless; desired Megistus to swear in his Majesty's
name, what he had promised, and that he should unriddle to him the whole
mystery; which when Megistus had done, the Secretary spoke thus.

Sir, I cannot tell whether it be by sagacity, or divine inspiration, that ye
come to know this mystery, but it must be by either; for those who were privy
to it, were all of them so much concerned, that I am confident they would never
divulge it: but, Sir, you have conjectured rightly, for my Master has devoted
himself to the Persian service; and one day by a compact betwixt him and the
Persian General, I was desired to walk out to the ^ield, where I would find a
Persian, of such a statu^e and garb, who would suffer himself to be taken my
prisoner; which succeeded accordingly, and whom I conducted to my Master, and
who was brought to his bedchamber, upon pretext as if he would examine him
privately; my Master commanded him to prison for two days, but thereafter
enlarged him upon his promise to stand by the Egyptian quarrel, so that he
walked up and down the Army, and was countenanced by the most eminent in it;
till at last acquainted both with our strength, and knowing fully Misarites
mind, he made show to go out one day in a party, but forgot to return: and
yesterday there came a Trumpet, under pretext of treating for some prisoners,
but secretly he delivered my Master some Letters.

Megistus did send immediately for Philarites, to whom he related all that had
past, and after some debates what was fittest to be done, they concluded, that
they would acquaint some Colonels with it, who were not of Misarites his
faction; as also a young Nobleman, who was the King's sisters son, and thereby
had much command and following in the Army: after they were all assembled, and
had taken an oath of secrecy, and had heard the case deduced, they resolved
that same night (because two of their Regiments were upon the guard) that the
King's sisters son Stirias, should take the Letter, and ensure Misarites, and
immediately divulge the Letter to the Army; but they concluded presently to
acquaint the King with what had past, that he might secure Sophander as they
were to secure Misarites, lest if they were not secured both at once, the
imprisonment of the one, might advertise the other of his danger; wherefore
they wrote to his Majesty this Letter.

SIR,
YOur eminent danger must now move your inclination to be more rigid than at
other times; and albeit Sophander be your Confident, yet ye must make him now
your prisoner. Prisons were made for Traitors, and courage suiteth well with
Princes. He and Misarites have conspired against your Majesty with the
Persians; we have secured the one, secure ye the other; and let neither his
reiterated protestations, nor his cunning discourses buy him off from a condign
punishment. We have sent along Misarites Secretary, to whose loyalty your
Majesty owes the discovery of the whole plot, and who has been as honest as
his master was disloyal; We hope your Majesty will recompense the one, and
punish the other: and that ye will acquaint your humble servants, who shall be
preferred to Misarites his Charge, that so all confusion may be avoided, and
the ruin of your affairs here prevented.


The two Knights addressed also another Letter to Monanthropus.

After this Gentleman was dispatched, and the Guards set, Stirias, accompanied
with the Knights and the Officers, went to Misarites Tent, and there made him
prisoner: he would h^ve raised some tumult, but was prevented by Stirias, who
calling the other Officers, showed them and the Soldiers the Letter, and
immediately prevented the tumult, and arrested two or three others who were of
the same cabal: this done, the Guards were commanded to let none pass who
might acquaint the Persians with what had occurred, but to lie quiet till to
morrow; for, in the twilight they resolved to set upon the Persian Army, who
were secure, relying upon Misarites infallible affection to them: The Soldiers
witnessed by their looks, their joy and willingness to fight, weary of the
insupportable fatigue of that slow-paced War. Whereupon the Council of War
preferred all in one voice, Megistus to be General in the interim, and Stirias
and Philarites to command in vice of the other reduced Officers: at midnight
they marched, the sickest among them showing himself healthful, and the most
sullen showing himself cheerful. At two a clock in the morning, they assaulted
the Persians; ilk defended trenches; who oppressed with sleep, and distracted
with fear, could neither give nor receive orders; some had their beds turned in
their graves; and others were from the imbracements of their dear friends, sent
to the cold imbracements of cruel death: Sotorus was, after much resistance,
taken prisoner, and in his conquest ended the conquest of the field; the
General being like the heart of the Army, which is the last part in the body
which lodges life. Thus ended that War so formidable to the Egyptians, that
they had concluded necessarily their own ruin; and so glorious to these two
Knights, that they only were esteemed the wel-spring, whence flowed that large
river of happiness, whose streams fatned so all Egypt. The diligence used at
Court was as great as what was used in the Army: for, immediately upon the
receipt of the abovementioned Letter, the King commanded Sophander to prison,
each at Court contributing his assistance to his disgrace; hoping that many
small Vessels might be built with the ruins of that bulkish one; and each one
endeavoring to testify his own innocence, by the rigor of his carriage to
Sophander; and now the Court, which resembles ordinarily an Orange tree,
whereupon there is always some fruit flourishing, some blossoming, and some
withering; did now resemble an Aspen tree, where all the leaves trembled,
rather by an innate quality, than by any outward storm; So all trembled here,
rather astonished with the novelty of the accident, and fearing unjust
informations (which are ordinary at such occasions, of which private enquiries
takes advantages, and when it is a crime even to be dilated) rather than from a
consciousness of their own guilt. A servant of Monanthropus admiring the
inconstancy of Court favor, presented his Master with these lines.

How can those stand, who on the slippery ice
Of Court are placed? when by the storms of vice,
Or malice, they are attaqu'd; O happy he,
Who from his cottage does these disasters see.
Court is a firmament, whence stars often fall,
And Courtiers are tossed like a ball
In Fortunes tennis-court; and by Prides racket are
Tossed over all the walls of Court most far.
Their greatness an hydropsie is, and they
Not with good blood, but humors swell each day.
They grow so big, that virtues narrow gate
Forbids them entry; then by witty fate,
He who exalted was is tumbled down
Fates narrow stairs, stripped of preferments gown.
Luxuriant pride shakes often their hour-glasse,
And their debordings seals to them a pass,
To go to endless torments, and each man
Adds to the yard of their disgrace, a span.
Who would be fixed, must grip to virtues hand:
For on the legs of vice no man can stand.
The Court was upon this occasion remodelled, and all those who had been
Sophanders confidents, were either imprisoned or disgraced, as persons in whom
the King could not confide; and now Monanthropus was the only Minion, by whose
advice, and through whose hands all things passed.

The War being ended, the King, to secure himself at Court, resolved to call
back the Army, and ordained the two Knights to be received in triumph, and
withal posted away a Commission to Megistus to command in chief: The
Commission being received, Megistus begins his march to Alexandria; and stopped
by a Warrant from the King, four miles from the City, till all things should be
in readiness for his reception. The next morning they entered, all the streets
being tapistred as they passed along, and Guards standing upon both sides.
After the Infantry, marched Megistus, with Philari^es on his right hand, and
Stirias upon his left: In the Marketplace stood a Scaffold, whereon was
represented the Parliament of the gods, before whom Themis, as goddess of
Justice, and Mars, as god of Courage, did plead which of them should be
preferred to welcome these worthy Gentlemen; at last Mars was preferred for the
Armies better satisfaction; who at their arrival delivered them this speech.

My darlings cadets of my house, whose hands
Were made to execute the just commands
Of divine powers; it is (my sons) to you,
That Victory her lofty top does bow;
That ye your heads may with her glorious bays
Encircle, like unto a Sun with rays:
Ye who hold fortunes wheel by the strong hand
Of Courage, making her swift course to stand;
Justice and Courage, shrewdly did contend,
Which of them as ambassadors the gods should send,
But seeing Courage, Justice does include,
(No Courage being, but where the cause is good)
Therefore the gods have Courage sent to greet
Your safe return to this most joyful street;
And were it not to leave on earth a seed
Of Heroes, they would surely with all speed
Transplant you to the heavens, there to shine
Amongst those other deiti^s divine.
Live then, brave Heroes, and more praise possess,
Than Mars rude tongue is able to express.
After that scene was ended, there appeared an Egyptian loaded with fetters,
and making his approaches to the Knights, entreated them to untye his fetters,
which they did accordingly, and thereafter he made them this gratulatory.

Invincible Gentlemen, this that ye have now done, is but an emblem of that ye
have done formerly; It is not so mysterious that I n^ed to explain it: Our
liberty is a debt which we owe you, and our thanks are the only coin we can pay
it in; all the bystanders participates with me in the common freedom, and
would return with me the common thanks, if order would permit it: our thanks
and your merits are no ways proportionable, the one being empty, and the other
excellent; but our admiration, and your deserts hold a better proportion, both
being inexprimable; they are twins both springing from the womb of your
Courage. Live then happily, worthy Princes, and inherit these praises, which
ye have purchased by your blood and pains.

The reception at Court exceeded in splendour that of the Marketplace, and the
rather, because Agapeta and ARETINA were there, in whose affections the Knights
desired more to triumph, than in any thing else; caring only for those honors
they had received, as means to make their peerless Mistrisses honor them the
more: all the inventions at Court was employed in honoring the Knights, and
they were esteemed wittiest who pleased them best: Tiltings were continually
used; for, courage being once wakened, behoved to have some exercise till it
were fully re-setled; neither could it change its pace so extremely, as to fall
from a gallop to a still standing, but behoved to retire by piecemeal: this
joy was in it self great, but was thought the greater, that it was the
successor of a pannick fear; and at last the King resolved to sacrifice
Sophander to the honor of their solemnities: for, many thought it not fit that
such a plodding head should have leave to rest upon its old shoulders, and that
there could not but ensue great alterations amongst the Nobles upon this late
innovation; and those who were postponed, might probably study his releasment,
desiring rather he should bear sway, than their own competitors; and expecting
by his releasment, to return affairs to their old confusion; that a living man
might always find friends, but dead dogs would bite none; that to keep him in
perpetual firmance, was in it self illegal, prisons being appointed rather to
reserve men for punishment, than to be a punishment it self; and that it
differed as far from punishment, as the means did from the end for which they
were appointed; or, if perpetual imprisonment was at all convenient, it was
only, either where the person incarcerated was furious, and so there was fear
that in executing the body, they should kill both soul and body; or else, where
the criminal was a person loved by the people, whose death would irritat them;
or else, of great following, so that their expectation of his life, or fear of
his death, would justly poise all his friends undertakings, and overawe all
their insolences: But that neither of these was to be expected by Sophanders
execution, whom all hated, and none loved; and possibly, if it were continued,
he might convey away out of the Nation most of his Estate (which he had ever
kept in movables, as being most transportable, and so it was best to wring
the sponge so long as it was full: The King resolved to execute him presently,
and therefore sentenced him to be hanged in the Marketplace; but the
Churchmen petitioned his Majesty, that he might be first examined by them,
being one of their number; and as being the ambassador of the immortal gods, he
should not be sentenced by any mortal Prince; and that they behoved to examine
first, whether what he had done were done for the glory of God, in which case
there could be no crime, and to which none were Judges but Churchmen: for, if
the secular power might at pleasure cut off Ecclesiastic members, it would
follow that it were in his power to suffer a Church to be, or not; for so he
might hang them at his pleasure: neither should ever any vice in the State, or
Statesmen be purged or enveighed against; for, all such reproofs should
presently be declared treason: And seeing Ecclesiastics were naturally too
prone to connive at vice, they should now be necessitated to do out of fear,
what they did formerly but by omission and negligence. The King rejected this
Petition, and told them that as they cognosced upon the errors of Laics when
committed against their power, so he might cognosce upon the escapes of
Ecclesiastics, when committed against his; that Sophander had offended as a
subject, and so behoved to behoved to be punished by his Prince, and that it
were safer being a shepherd than a King, if they who were ordinarily governed
by some two or three factious fellows (the best of Ecclesiastics always
shunning command) should be Judges competent to treason; wherefore, seeing they
had their protection from him, it was fit he should challenge subjection from
them, which consisted in nothing more than in this.

Megistus hearing that the King resolved to cause hang Sophander, thought, that
albeit he could not beg his life, as being a Trai^or, yet that he would
endeavor to mitigate the manner of his death, as being his old friend and
patron; whereupon both Philarites and he entreated his Majesty, that he would
cause cut off his head, and not hang him, as being once honored by himself
with the title of Chief Minister of State; and that it was customary amongst
all Nations, to punish in the least eminent way those who had been most eminent
in dignity, both because the smallest punishment is greater to them, than the
greatest would be to others, as also, because punishments being ordinarily
inflicted, not for what was past, because that could not be re-called, but for
prevention of the like by that rigor for the future; and so seeing fewer great
ones would probably incur these guilts, the Law needed not punish them so
severely, as it did the meaner sort, who would more frequently fall in the
crimes forbidden. That Maxim holds only true (answered the King) in those
crimes which degrade not a man of his honors, as in combats and private
injuries, which crimes are consistent with true honor; but in treason and
treachery, the committer declares himself unworthy of his honors, and
consequently should not enjoy those privileges due to them; yet, to satisfy
your desires, I am content his head be struck off, and his body buried.

At the day appointed for his Execution, all the City, yea, and the Nation
flocked to the Marketplace; some to satisfy their inhumane revenge, (which
that circumstance of time made most unjust) others, to remark the period of
humane glory; and a third sort, to glut their boundless curiosity. After some
time so spent, Sophander appeared upon the Scaffold, in his gown and nightcap,
whose age and gravity drew tears from his most inveterate enemies; after he had
settled himself a little, he gave the spectators this farewell,

Gentlemen,
I Am by providence presented here as an emblem of unconstant grandour; I wish
my case may be remarked by all, but imitated by none: I am set up as a beacon
upon the rockie shore of Court-favour, that ye should not approach the place
where I have splitted; I mean not that ye should all retire your selves from
Court, for that were impossible, seeing the Nation must be governed by some; and
unlawful, seeing Nature has bestowed public spirits upon some, that they
might employ them for the profit of all; but I mean, that none should thrust
themselves into the crowd of Minions, wherein many have perished in entering,
and all have perished almost before they could retire: And that all should be
so wise, as to be the last who will go to Sea in such storms, and the first who
will retire from them: I know many are taken with our greatness, but they
consider not our hazard; many envy our access to our Prince, but they advert
not the misinformations given in to him against us; some eye greedily our
riches, but remembers not our vast expenses and numerous attendants: And, on
the other hand, they see the poverty of a private life, but are strangers to
its contentment, and contemns its lowness without weighing its security: thus
greatness, like a whore, presents her self unto us fairded, whereas chaste
virtue appears only in her homely habit; and, believe me, albeit ye may for a
season recreate your self more ticklingly with the first, yet ye will live more
contentedly with the second: O! who were lodged but one night in the breast of
a Grandee, to see what confusion of thoughts were there, would thereafter buy
himself off from the ensnaring pleasures of that anxious life; May ye not
consider that the gods who have created all things for the use of man, have
made things which are most useful and good to be most common? and so, seeing
they have ordained many to be governed, and but few to govern, we must conclude
those who are governed to be happiest: for, if they had thought Crowns and
Scepters as requisite for man's happiness, as were private estates and cottages,
they could have made as many of the one as of the other, and created as many
Kingdoms as there were men to be Kings in them; yea, I believe that Kings and
Courts were ordained, not to make happy those who lived in them, but to
maintain the happiness of those who lived remote from them: your sleep is not
interrupted, whilst we are disquieted; neither is your danger worth the
noticeing, whilst ours is often inevitable: consider the number of our
competitors, the multiplicity of our businesses, our own fears, and the Princes
jealousies; and you will soon conclude, that we are like poor peasants who make
and sell good wine to others, but drink little or none of it our selves. Since
there are so many reasons to dissuade us from being ambitious, we must conclude
Ambition to be a cunning Sophister, which can solve all those unanswerable
arguments. I remember that the Christians observe, That seeing it tempted the
Angels, before they were corrupted with any other sin, it is no wonder it
should tempt us who are but men, and already tainted with sin; and that since
it was the first sin, it must necessarily be the sin we have greatest
inclinations; for, seeing we embrace first ordidarily that we affect most:
Ambition then is the Devils firstborn, and so no wonder it claim precedence
before all other vices; and as ordinarily proud men of all men have always the
greatest train, so Pride it self of all vices has still the maniest
attendants; for, it must be waited upon by covetousness, to fill its prodigal
coffers; with revenge, to repair its imaginary affronts; with murder, to remove
all those who stand in its way; and in fine, it is the great bellyed vice,
which spanneth all the rest. Gentlemen, if I were speaking this to you,
incircled with my former honors, ye might imagine I enveighed against
greatness, as wishing all others to flee it, that I might share alone in it;
or, if I were to live banished, ye might say that I disparaged it, because I
could not retain it; but being to dye, ye may be confident that all I say are
the dictates of mere ingenuity. I am now upon the brink of my grave, and can
leave you nothing in legacy but my tears and precepts; which, if ye follow, may
repair the great loss this Nation has suffered by me.

Farewell.

Thereafter he called for Megistus, and craved him pardon for misinforming his
Majesty against him* and gave him privately some Papers, wherein were some
remarks, useful for those who were to govern Egypt; and prophesied to him his
future advancement (which was thereafter ^o small encouragement to Megistus)
for, said he, the soul being certainly of a divine extraction, would foreknow
many strange events, if it were not ignoranced by the unproportionatness of the
bodily organs to such contemplations, and when it is emancipitated from the
power of the body, as in fevers, deathbeds, swoonings, ecstasies, and women's
histerick passions, we see it acts and foreseeth things extraordinary.
Thereafter he recommended his friends and nephews to Megistus, and Megistus to
the people, and loyalty to all of them; and so had his head struck off by the
Executioner, and received by Megistus.

The next morning there was this Epitaph posted upon his Tomb.

Here restless he does rest, who never could
Get earth enough, till casten in this mould.
Megistus sadned exceedingly, partly by the uncertain condition of mankind,
partly puzzled with the thoughts of Sophanders prediction; retired to his
chamber, where his Landlord, a witty fellow, came presently to solace him, and
related to him this story, which had occurred that same day in the City.

A young Country Gentleman, accustomed at home to whistle following the plough,
to domineere amongst a great many Country Clowns, and to feed a kennel of
dogs, was by his friends brought into the City to court a young Citizen; whose
beauty lay in her coffers, and whose perfections were counted by thousands: yet
this Jet was able enough to draw straw to it, and her blackness did cast a
curious luster when enambled upon gold; his friends cared not whether she had a
golden mind, seeing she was a golden mine; neither looked they to her age, seeing
it was a golden age: to speak truth, such a statue fitted well such a
worshipper. Being come to the City, he was all gilded with gold: and indeed
such an harsh pill had need to be so; and ye would have sworn that his clothes
being upon him, were another Iasons fleece, and himself the sheep: Thus
accouted, he marched up and down the City, dreaming that all persons were
busied in viewing him, and pointing out his finger, asking who was that, or the
other; which a young Gallant perceiving, watched till he holding out his finger
to a Coach, to ask what a Cart was that so covered? which his servant not
hearing at first, as being a busy as his master; he asked the second time,
with his finger outstretched, What was that? to which the other Gallant, making
a low congie, answered, That it was his Honors finger. He admired likewise for
what use served those Chests that men carried about the streets (meaning the
Sedans) to which a merry bystander answered, That it was to carry Gentlemen's
hounds and dogs, lest else they should stray, or be robbed by the Courtiers;
whereupon the Youth addressed himself to the bearers, and commanded them to
take in his dogs (for the other had persuaded him, that if he spoke calmly to
them that they would think him blunt and silly) at which the bearers, thinking
he spoke so, only to affront them, and knowing by his garb that he was but a
fresh water Citizen, reviled him most pitifully, saying that the shepherds in
the Country were much to blame, who suffered their sheep so to stray, and that
they behoved to fleece him; whereupon they pulled away his cloak, and had not
restored it, if his servant, who went up and down crying that his Honor was
massacred, had not amazed many people, who caused restore him his cloak, each
one swearing that what he had spoken, was spoken out of simplicity: home he
went with his cloak lined with this affront; and the next morning was admitted
to see his Mistress, who albeit she was not fair, yet could go fair to cheat
him; and was able to play her cards so, as that she was able to counter and
beast such a Gentleman; and if they had begun the game, doubtless she had by
turning up always the ace, made my Gentleman throw down his cards.

The Gentlewoman being informed of his pure wit, resolved to let him see some
of hers; whereupon she commanded her maid to put on her clothes, and to sit in
her chair, and receive the visit for her; and withal, after the young Gallant
should begin to extol her beauty above all others, that she should then ask
what he judged of her maid? All things being thus ordered, she sent to entreat
his friends, that none of them should come to her chamber with him the first
day, because she would be too bashful if any else were there to remark her; to
which they easily condescended.

Enter Gentleman. The Gallant the next day enters, and putting his arm about
her neck, kisses his Mistress loudly, fearing that else that they had imagined
that he had not kissed her at all, and thereafter tumbling back confusedly,
made another low reverence, where he lost misfortunately the paper upon which
his compl^ments were written) (which he very often repeated at home to his
uncle) He entreated her to sit down in the highest chair, thinking that to be
some preferment: whereto the Gentlewoman wittily answered, Sir, the woman
should be lowest. After this debate was ended, he insisted thus.

Mistress, when I came first to Alexandria, I thought this City the prettiest
thing in the world, but now when I see you, I esteem nothing of it; for, I
think that all our Country maids, may be handmaids to you; whose beauty is as
far preferable to theirs, as this City is to ours. Here he stopped, hearing a
horse pass by upon the street, and called for his servants to look if that was
his young horse or not, and thereafter insisted thus; Madam, I believe that my
father's house has all accomplishments requisite for sweetning the harshness of
a solitary life, only it wants such an accomplished Lady as you are, to be
Mistress of all, (and there he recounted to her what choice fields for hunting,
and what excellent pasturages for h^rding, were there) But Sir, replied she,
seeing we see Country Gentlemen leave all these rural pleasures, pretending to
come to the City for converse; and those who are in the City, leave their well
decked chambers, and sumptuous parlors, and go abroad to recreate themselves
with their friends, we may infer, that society is preferable to all these; for,
when ye come to the City, ye acknowledge it is to better your spirits; and when
we go to the Country, our end is only to refresh our bodies, So that the
Country may be thought as justly to cede to the City, as the soul is preferable
to the body. O Madam, but ye could make any place happy; and happy were the son
of that father who might be husband to such a complete Lady as ye are. What
think you of my maid, if compared with me (said she) I think her a beautiful
young Gentlewoman (quoth our Gallant) but no beauty when compared with you:
Whereupon the Mistress, who had played the maid hitherto, did now sit down in
her own chair, and commanding her waitingmaid to stand by her, she thundered
thus the poor simple Gentleman.

Sir, I admire the less what has past, that I expected to hear what I now
hear; but I admire that men should lavish out so profusely praises of what they
know not: for, Sir, if we were so simple as to believe, that your heart
conceived what your tongue brings forth, ye might rather wish us in Bedlam than
in your Beds; and if we are so wise as to discern your dissimulation, ye may
conclude, that we think you as unfit to be our husbands, because of this last,
as ye might judge us unworthy to be your wives because of the first; wherefore,
Sir, consider for the future, that albeit women are so discreet as to connive
at your dissimulation, yet they are not so ignorant, as not to know it. Ye
wrong our sex hugely, by thinking us so simple, and your own, by making us
conclude that ye are all dissemblers: and of all vices, dissimulation is one of
the worst, because it not only is evil in it self (as being a cheat) but
likewise is an abuse of what is good, even of respect and friendship, making
them bauds to your vicious cheats: Sir, those strings are not well tuned, which
are tuned too high; and those praises are but flatteries, which are palpable
lies; yet, Sir, I pardon you more than others: for, as those who shoot seldom,
must be pardoned when they shoot over; So those who complement but
unfrequently, must be pardoned albeit they do it imprudently.

The Gentleman struck dead by these thunderbolts of wit, remained speechless,
as if his soul had fled away for shame; he essayed often to speak, but his
words no sooner peeped out, but smelling this reply, they retired back to their
old quarter in great disorder; leaving their master helpless without them, who
had been formerly but little helped by them. Since his own soul has left him,
said Megistus, it is reason we leave him also, and so he went to bed.

The Third Book.
THe next morning Megistus went to to tender his respects to Monanthropus, and
at his entry, told him, That it was not too little, but rather too much
respect, which had estranged him so from waiting upon his Lordship at his
chamber all this while; and that he shunned much to be so sacrilegious, as to
rob he State of those hours which would be spent in its service, if they were
not misspent by such trifling visits as his were. After this they discoursed of
present affairs, and after these, Monanthropus entreated Megistus to walk some
time in the garden, and there to continue the story of the Lacedemonian War,
which Megistus at his entreaty commenced thus.

My Lord, I will not trouble your attention, in making it trace all the tracts
of fortunes wheel in that Commonwealth, whose reelings were so many, that it
appears she intended to show the world how often she could turn in a short
space; Those who stuck upon her, were in her Circumgirations crushed to pieces,
only those were preserved, who* foreseeing her inconstancy, did leap off,
exchangeing necessary ruin with a voluntary fall: and albeit their story
resembles your Nilus, the sources of both being unknown; yet I shall acquaint
your Lordship with those mysteries which time has now unmasked: for, albeit
Statesmen often gild their greatest cheats with specious pretexts, yet time at
last wears out that gilding, and then all things appear in their true colors:
and as from gray-haired men, so from gray-haired stories, truth is often best
learned; Wherefore my Lord, please to know, that Lacedemon and Athens were
enemies as vindictive as old, till at last by the marriage of the King of
Lacedemons daughter, with the King of Athens son, the Crowns were both molten
in one; or rather the one lined with the other, (the gods making often
friendship and amity, the eldest son of such marriages) After Sophus his
succession to the Crown of Lacedemon (for he was an Athenian born) he enobled
many in Lacedemon, both fearing lest he should lose many friends, if these many
pretenders losed their suits; as also, because in making them Nobles, he made
them friends; and that those who had gotten patents from him, would employ both
their estates and patents for him; knowing that if he fell, their honor
behoved to fall with him: There were others who alleged, that he intended to
make the Nobility less powerful, by making them more numerous; and by
dividing this great torrent of popular command in many channels, he made it
foordable for his wit, even where it was deepest: for, as it is hard to gain
one of ten, so it is easy to gain one of twenty: and those plots which might
easily have been concealed amongst the Noblemen if they had been few, were
easily learned from them when they were many; and foreign Princes, who intend
to invade the Countries, may easily gain one Grandee, (who being one of few,
might be formidable to his own Prince, and most helpful to his enemy) whereas
it was difficult to gain many, and they were not very dangerous when they were
gained: yet whatever was the reason which did instigate this wise Prince to
this, certain it is, that this obfuscated much the resplendent rays of Honor
and Nobility; for Nobilities great privileges, being preference amongst
themselves, and respect from the people, their preference must be the less
worthy, by how much the more competitors they have; and their respect from the
people must be the ebber, that the people is obliged to divide it amongst
many: This wise Prince likewise, finding what great influence the Priests of
that Nation had upon the people, and perpending how hard (if not impossible) it
was for a Prince to gain all their affections, or retain them, when once
gained; resolved to choose some few to govern the rest, by whom he might govern
the others at his pleasure; and to whom he might intimate his thoughts without
trouble or fear of discovery; and by whom he might antidote the factions, which
he foresaw either their own pride, or the factious Nobility might hatch amongst
them; as also, that thereby the sons of Noblemen, and possibly his own friends,
might have some void Charges and Offices, whereto they might pretend; and
wherein being once installed, they might evidence more loyalty to him, than
strangers would do: as also, that the Nobility might be counterpoised and might
not share alone in all the Offices of State, in whose hands they were more
dangerous than in the hands of Ecclesiastics, whose revenues were not great,
nor whose vassals and kinsmen were not numerous: these the other Ecclesiastics
grudged infinitely, not so much because they thought their promotion illegal, as
angry because they were not promoted themselves, ambition persuading the
soberest amongst them, that the higher they were, they would be the nearer to
heaven. Many judged likewise, that he was most ill satisfied with the
Lacedemonian Senate, which was composed ordinarily of the wittiest and
turbulentest persons in the Nation, and intended often to have each City
choose, as their Representative, some Residenter, who might understand best the
necessities of his Town, and would nible less at the Royal Prerogative;
whereas Lawyers, and others, being often commissionated by them, dipped too
much in what belonged to the King, and too little in what concerned the place
represented by them; and in Athens when it was tabled, whether each County and
Town should be licentiate to choose any they looked upon as fittest, it was
concluded by the Nobles there that this choked their interest; for, if they
should be permitted to choose the Lawyers or Wits of the Nation, the Nobles
should be topped by them in all debates, and upon all occasions.

He likewise was most unsatisfied, with the dependences of the Tribes of that
Nation upon their own Families, and upon the Princes thereof; to whom the King
in their affection was but second; for he esteemed these, the storehouses of
faction and nurseries of oppression; none daring either follow the Royal
Standard, except under their conduct; nor daring countenance a stranger if not
in blood or affinity with them: and as that wise Prince often said, these could
not be properly thought his subjects, who were so much in subjection to others,
nor could not employ both their hands in upholding the Throne, the one whereof
was busied in paling up the Prince of their own Family; and so by dividing
their hearts betwixt their Prince and him, they made them unserviceable for
either,

These seemed but dwarf discontentments, when placed beside that giant
prejudice, which was conceived against him, because of his irregular and
monster-like affection to Phratus his Minion; who enhanced all the Royal
favor, as due to none but to himself; whose mean extraction, when collationed
with his top-high preferment, seemed insufferable to those of higher birth, and
lower fortunes; but these adverted not, who seeing no familiarity nor intimacy
can be, betwixt those amongst whom there is no equality; that therefore Princes
must advance some one above all the rest, to whom he may communicate, and in
whose breasts he may pour out his greatest secrets, that so he may not be vexed
always, in bowing down to speak to them, or to hear what they would speak to
him; and customarily Princes pile out those, whose birth cannot occasion any
fears that they will entertain any nimious pretenses: These Favorites are the
skreens which defend Kings from popular malice, and the pack-horses upon whom
all enmity and miscarriages are laid; and their ruin is often the main article
of pacification betwixt the King and Subject* who to repay their many taxations
and losses, seek no other requital than their destruction; and whom Princes
themselves often suffer, like spunges, to suck in treasure from the people,
knowing that when they are filled by them, they will devour less of what
pertains to the public cash; as also, that they may wring them when they are
full, and so be thanked by the people, for retaking that treasure from the
Favorite, which if they had immediately taken from themselves, they had been
most bitterly exclaimed against: this Gentl^man was but meanly born, and
ascended to honors parlour, rather by the back-stairs of private affection,
than by the publ^ck entry of merit; and ordinarily those thrive best, for all
the difficulty of agrandizing ones self at Court, is at the first entry; and
commonly those who are well descended, have all the bars of difficulty laid in
their way by their competing equals; and many to pull them down, whilst they
are mounting, whereas many persons mount these stairs undiscoveredly, without
being once leted: Yea, oft-times they imp themselves in some Noblemans train,
who in flying high draws them after him: Another great mean of his
advancement, was his favor amongst the Ladies, who are more prodigal of their
encomions, to those whom they affect than are their wary husbands; and whose
sex and charms procure often both countenance and respect, to those whom they
once honor with the title of their Favorite; non daring offend such, lest
they should be forced to take up the cudgel of enmity against a Lady; and all
being most ready to signify their respect to these Ladies in the persons of
their Favorite, seeing most want the means of engaging themselves: from this
grain of mustard seed did grow up that large stalk, whose fruits did thereafter
so bite the mouths of all the Nation, and by this sparkle was kindled that
great fire, which did thereafter both scorch his enemies, and warm his friends;
and whose flames were the only lights which show Courtiers the way to
preferment. Yet the people ceased not to cry out against him, as the Canicular
Star, which made the influence of Court so noxious; all the days of his reign
being their dogg-dayes; his prodigality was called the occasion of the many
taxations, and his pride the reason why all others were disgraced: which a
zealous friend to his Majesty did one day thus remonstrate to him.

Sir, it is not your own, but your Favorites prodigality which uncoffereth your
treasury; for, all Kings that ever reigned in Lacedemon, have successively
lived at the same rate that ye live, yet have their treasuries often grown
fatter, whereas yours becomes daily more lean: but the reason why one King
spends more than another, is, because their Minions are more or less profuse;
for, when a King chooses for his Favourit a lame wit, which needs silver stilts
to uphold him, then is the treasure impoverished; he fears all, and so must
bribe many; and his intelligence (I mean not for his Princes maintenance, but
for his own) must be maintained at the public charge; as also, the frequency
of your Majesty's Nobles at Court, is one of the moths which consumes this poor
Nation; for, luxury having made lean their purses in an instant, they must be
privately interlarded with public treasure, and the carcass of some Pension or
Monopoly, must be presently thrown to them to feed upon: neither is this the
only inconvenience which ensues upon their constant attendance at Court, for
they must, when there, contend with one another, whose train shall prove most
sumptuous, and so like two stones knocking against one another, both must
necessarily lose some of their substance; it is at Court that all their
jarring^ are commenced amongst themselves, and it is there that their plots are
hatched against the public interest; and as a body whilst it is in health, is
still amassing humors, which will certainly one day give life to some disease;
So your Majesty may expect that their frequent meetings here, will one day
occasion some War, which neither ye nor they will be able to quench; their stay
at Court occasioneth the misgovernment of their estates at home (it being the
masters eye that makes the horse fat) and what was formerly spent at home in
hospitality, is now spent at Court in luxury: they bring along with them the
sons of the Gentry, and these return back to their Country fraughted with vice
and vanity; and so the money which the poor country men buy with their sweat,
must be sold for silks and spices; and we must give foreigners things that are
necessary, returning nothing but what is superfluous; and by this your enemies
War is maintained against you with your own money, and your Natives unable
themselves to war for you because of their e^^eminate employments, which they
now use: Wherefore it is the wish of all your Subjects, that you would command
all your Nobles home till they be called-for, and so pull from them those
firebrands of vice and luxury, whereby they inflame the Nation.

That which heightened the popular fury, was, that he never courted their
favor, holding it as a maxim, That seeing that which made Subjects formidable
to their Prince, was, their too great popularity, (for, seeing Kings endeavor
so much to enthronize themselves in their Subjects affections, they both do and
look upon all such as their rivals, who court the same affection with them) and
therefore it was reasonable to believe, That to renounce any share in the
peoples affection, was the true way to ingratiate himself with the King;
intimating thereby to his Prince, that his favor was the dye, from which they
were to expect a good or bad game; and no doubt but this is the surest way of
subsistence: for, a Grandee may subsist by the favor of the Prince, without
the favor of the people, but cannot subsist by the people without the favor
of the Prince; with this proviso, that the Prince, upon whom he depends, be not
so silly as to depend upon his people; for else it is not good to depend upon
him, lest when the Subject begins to open his mouth against his Prince, the
either timorous or facile Prince, throws his Confident in their mouths as a
lump to stop it.

Whilst these things were upon the file, this excellent Prince dyed, leaving
after-ages an evident proof, that the ocean of affairs has its own tides, and
fair gales (which are to be expected, not commanded) and in which interims the
Prince may recreate himself with his lawful pleasures; for, this Prince was
never one who lost his pleasure for his business, nor his business for his
pleasure: Some tainted his royal repute with cowardishness; but since Kings,
except they be rash, are not tolerated to spend their own blood, it follows,
that his crime was that he was too frugal of the blood of his subjects; which
any sound wit will interpret to be rather love than fear; but to what purpose
should he have unsheathed the sword of his courage, seeing the sword of his wit
conquered all his enemies; neither is it an imputation to a Physician, that he
prevents all diseases so dexterously, as that he suffers not his patients to
fall in any disease. Many did misconstrue this worthy Prince in many things,
never considering, that it is as unbeseeming a subject to censure the actions
of his Prince, as it is ridiculous in a patient to find the pulse of his
Physician; for, since Princes are often acted in what they do from principles
unknown to us, and have aims which we are strangers to, and seeing the motives
and ends of the agents, are these things which determine our actions, it
follows that it is not only absurd, but even impossible for subjects to discant
truly upon the actions of their Princes: and since a Deputy is only answerable
for his carriage or miscarriage to him, by whom he is deputed; and the Gods are
those who have commissionated Princes, it must be undeniable that they can be
arraigned before no tribunal else, but theirs; but admit, that really they
escaped at some times, and upon some occasions, that proves only they are men,
and who denies that? but if they must be condemned for that, I should desire
him who has spent his life (though private) without an omission, to cast the
first stone at them; and if private men who have time to deliberate what is
incumbent to them to do, and few to remark what their failings are, cannot
notwithstanding plead exemption from infirmities; what may Kings plead, who are
overcharged with businesses, misinformed by Sycophants, and have thousands of
eyes to eye the meanest of their escapes.

To him succeeded Anaxagius, a Prince whose perfection taught the world, that
all Princes who had devanced him, had their goodness allied with some
imperfection when compared with his, and by which future ages may measure the
perfection of his successors; him providence sent to the world, foreseeing
that these crooked times would need such a straight pattern as was his
integrity: and that innocent and virtuous souls (whom that age would abominate)
needed the patronage of such an accomplished patron: so that it seemed that
providence has casten his soul in a peculiar mould, wherein none had been
formed formerly; a person whom virtue would have chosen to be, if birth had not
already made him a King; and whose innocent life convinced all men, that
greatness and goodness were not incompatible; in his heart lodged a complete
body of accomplishednesse, only it wanted a splean; and by him all concluded,
that goodness as well as vice wanted not its own excess; yet such an excess
as, seeing it was in him, could not be vicious: Neither was this soul ill
lodged; for, as the soul was a pure diamond, so it was enchassed in a body of
pure gold; his face was both a King's face, and the face of a King; and all the
other members of his body were such, as suited well with such a face; so that
neither could the eye in his body, nor the judgment in his life challenge the
least imperfection.

He stepped no sooner up to the Royal Throne, than his enemies began to belch out
their malice against him; considering, that if they persuaded not the Nations
of those imperfections which they alleged he was tainted with, presently, that
he would shortly refute them by his admirable integrity; Wherefore an Athenian
Nobleman named Prastus, dispersed many Papers, flush of aspersions against his
Majesty, at least, they were after search, found to be in his cabinet:
whereupon he is arraigned, and a great Favorite, who was likewise his too
great wel-wisher, is picked out to be one of his Ju^^^^; who finding, that he
behoved either to lose his Master, or his Friend, was at first much perplexed;
but at last (as the worst of inventions are always the readiest) resolved,
that as his Judge, he would first condemn him; and then as his intimate, he
would intercede for him: which he did effectuate, and procured him a remission
for that crime, for which he formerly found him guilty. Whereat a true friend
to his Majesty much offended, did remonstrate to the King his error after this
manner.

Sir, your Majesty having once by Law condemned Prastus, if ye now absolve him,
ye must condemn the Law which found him guil^y: for, if he be guiltless, the
Law did wrong in sentencing him; and if he be guilty, the Law is wronged in
your absolving him. Neither admire I, to see your Nobles intercede for him; for
who knows but these in this plead for their own case? and if either they, or
any of them, be already, or shall be hereafter found guilty of those crimes,
with which he was charged, then they may allege for themselves, not only what
they now allege for him, but likewise may triumph in this precedent; So that
in sealing a pardon for him, ye abrogate all the penal Statutes, and lays up
remissions for all that shall have the confidence but to seek them: C^^^^der,
Sir, that this Nation is naturally factious, (...) being commanded by Nobles,
who have the Commons fully at their devotion, and that your absence feeds this
humor in them, (the face of a King being able either to charm subjects to a
compliance, or to command them to obedience) but what may ye expect, if they be
once connived at by those who should punish them? the Law was the only mastiff
which kept the house from robbers, but if his mouth be musled, what security
may be expected, the Law should be most rigid and best observed, where vices
are most enticing, and to which we are most propense; wherefore, seeing nothing
lures us so strongly as a nimious desire of liberty, and the desire of
self-rule; nothing should be so severely punished as Rebellion, which is the
product of both these: and if even when Laws are execute against them, the
numbers of such offenders are numberless, what may we expect when the Law
prevaricates and sideth with them? Sir, the less able men are to resist the
wrongs done them, or to foresee them, the more grievously should the offenders
be punished; as poison is more grievous than murder (so that the horror of
the punishment is the best guard against these) therefore of all treasonable
plots, defaming Libels should be most severely punished, because it is most
difficult to detect those, and when they are detected, it is impossible almost
to refute them, neither is truth, soap sufficient to wash out the spots which
Libels make, apprehension being enough to persuade men of what they fear. Sir,
after he is released, will not his enemies vaunt, that either in courage ye
durst not, or in justice ye could not condemn him? so that either ye must
proclaim your self rash in the first, or a coward in the last; And who will as
Judge condemn any attached hereafter as a Traitor, knowing that the person so
condemed by them will survive their sentence to prove their enemy? And thinks
your Majesty, but Prastus will endeavor to revenge this affront? neither will
he ever ponder your courtesy in pardoning him, but will rather eye the affront
done in once staging him: the wound may be cured, but the cicatrice will
remain; and if the children of Traitors are often secured, often banished, and
often forfaulted; because the Law presumes that they will yet possibly avenge
the death of their fathers: how much more may we conclude, that a peson whilst
alive himself, will resent his own disaster more jealously. Sir, augment not
the number of your enemies, by recalling to life Prastus, who is already
civilly dead, and remember that ye have thorns enough in the garden of your
Kingdom, albeit ye plant none your self; neither can ye expect any thanks from
Prastus for this act of superstitious clemency, for your Favorites who have
interceded for him, will reap those, and he will say, that ye declared
sufficiently your malice against him in his condemnation, albeit thereafter ye
declared your affection to those intercessors in his absolution; and, Sir,
since the papers were found with him, certainly he must be the leading card in
this fa^al game, and the ring whereupon all the other keys hung. And I fear,
Sir, ye must one day treat with him as your party, whom ye now pardon as your
supplicant. But, Sir, seeing ye fear the peoples envy on the one hand, and yet
dread Prastus loyalty upon the other, to extricate your self from both these
difficulties, keep him in prison, and in suspense, feeding him always with
hopes of releasment, providing his friends and dependants carry soberly; by
which means ye will secure him, and he will be an hostage to you for the good
behavior of others.

The Court-favourite who bestirred himself so much for Prastus, was one named
Taurus, whose honors were the donative rather of his Prince, than of his
birth; for, he was by birth but a Gentleman, rather of great parts than a great
fortune; but being of a singular spirit, and accute wit, was commissionated by
the Athenian Gentlemen to represent their grievances at Court, and to reside
there as their Legier, to manage their employments against the Nobles of their
own Nation, with whom they had then some debates: the Courtiers (who study
always men's humors as much as their business, knowing that most of men make
it their business to satisfy their own humor, and that as men love not others
so well as themselves, so they endeavor not so much to satisfy others as
themselves) did smell at last, that if he were created a Nobleman himself, his
zeal against the Nobility would cease with his interest, wherefore finding,
that his pulse did beat highly, they persuaded the King to enroll him amongst
the Peers, which promotion cooled soon that fever of respect which he had
evidenced for those who employed him, so that he wrote home to the remanent
Gentlemen, That since he ceased to be what he was when they commissionated him,
he behoved likewise not to act now what they had entrusted to him, and that
seeing he was a Nobleman, he hoped they would construe it to be no breach of
trust, that he antagonisted not the Nobilities interest: for, since we are
desired only to love our neighbors as our selves, it is presupponed that
self-love will always be the more prevalent; as the square is always
streighter then that which is squared by it: and he thought that he did acquit
himself sufficiently of his trust, in acquainting them of what had past, and in
fore-warning them, that their Residents charge did now stand empty. The
Gentlemen finding themselves thus befooled, resolved thereafter to employ
always two or three, knowing that they could not then be so easily bribed.

This Taurus did thereafter find the King's ear always very open to him; and
as he was happy in being his Master's Confident, so each man thought himself
happy if he could but once obtain the favor as to be his; yet his Majesty was
much mistaken in this choice, for this wit was too subtle to be employed in
such subtle times, and it did afterward prove so sharp that it cut himself;
sharp wits being like sharp razors, which should only be used by very steadfast
hands; else, if the hand vary, the razor cannot but make some gash, which was
sufficiently verified in Taurus: for he endeavored so much to cheat all, and
please all, that he was in fine cheated by all, and pleased none; for, not
being able to head one faction himself, he was always zealouzed by both the
other factions, who endeavored both to ruin him, seeing neither of them could
ensure him; for as winds that changes often, are hated by all sailers, because
they can neither serve those who are to go or come; So these changelings are
neglected by all parties, neither can they ever advance themselves, for whoever
gains, they will be still losers, whereas if they did constantly adhere to any
faction, they would either gain when their interest were masters, or at least
they might secure themselves by their own parties capitulation; neither are
ever these changlings admitted to the cabinet-counsels of either, nor know ever
more nor what the revealers fear not to divulge.

He was admitted by his Prince to oversee his treasure, wherein it was thought,
that his Prince was much misted, and wherein he himself did likewise bewray
some weakness; his Princes error was, that he should have promoted one whose
estate was yet to be founded by the government of his Cash, which was all one
as if he would put his full trencher to the mercy of a hungry dog, and
especially seeing it was notory, that not only his necessity but even his humor
poused him too much to these designs; his own error was, that he should have
begun to reform those errors in the State, which, because of his poverty, and
humor, were concluded to be inventions, hatched rather to enrich himself than
his master: Thus flourished, and thus perished Taurus, whose wit occasioned
both his advancement and his ruin, like one thrown down those same stairs, by
which he mounted.

Taxes and gabels are as necessary in the politic body, as the spleen is in
the natural, yet in both they engender many diseases; private men thinking that
lost which goes from their own private coffers: and as patients often judge the
moneys bestowed upon Physicians ill employed, after they find themselves
re-instated in their former health, attributing their recovery more to Nature
than to his pains; So subjects, when they are enstated in that peace, which the
vigilance of their Prince, aided by their taxes, has procured for them, judge
their taxes superfluous: never pondring in the scales of prudence what
advantage the reap by them (which indeed the meaner sort who complain most,
cannot faddom) but ruminate still upon the loss in once paying them; yet this
natural aversion they have from them, is often scrued up to a greater height by
the bad choice of those who are by the Court destinated to collect them, who
being avaritious and odious persons, for those always offer most for the farm
of them, knowing by their rigidity to repay those vast sums, and so are still
preferred; which incites the people to abominate those taxes more than
formerly, knowing that not only they go from themselves, but likewayes go to
fill the purses of these detestable miscreants; Neither is the unequal
distribution of these taxes a small disadvantage to the Prince: for, as it
grieves a man to pay any at all, so it grieves him yet more, that they should
pay more than others; So that whilst the friends and clients of some Courtiers
are spared, others must bear their burdens; and so men being always prone to
compute their own wrongs by the Arithmetic of comparisons, those who are
wronged, judges their injuries so much the greater, that they see their
neighbors totally exempted: for, albeit the Prince may satisfy his people, in
telling them the true cause of such impositions in general, or hoodwink them in
forging reasons where there are none; yet there is no Court-sophister so
cunning as to show a reason why some are exempted, others not; whereupon those
who are extortioned, they exclaim first, and then are oft-times seconded by
those to whom no wrong was done at all, who hope by these vociferations to get
these impositions totally banished; or else do fear, lest the case of their
vexed neighbors may one day become their own, seeing they have no leases of
these favors more than others, and which they know to be mortal, as well as
those who indulge them; but if people would advert how that twenty or thirty
crowns a year, keep off either a foreign war, or prevents a civil, which would
moulder away the half of their estates, if not prevented; yea, and rob the wife
of her husband, and the father of his children; they would then condemn
themselves, because they now condemn their Prince: and it is often seen, that
those Nations flourish best, and conquer most, whose subjects are poorest, and
whose treasures are fullest, the riches of subjects occasioning their luxury,
and their luxury kindling a war (that which is fattest kindling always
soonest) whereas the riches of the public cash are a rampart against public
invasions, and forces strangers not to interrupt the National Commerce, nor
to abridge, but rather to enlarge their Privileges.

These contemptible grievances, were the small Machines which first moved that
bulkish body of the popular fury in Lacedemon; not against the King, but
against Court-parasites, as they pretended; the mal-contents of that Nation,
who were then members of the Senate, taking occasion of Anaxagius his present
necessity, being engaged by a National consent in a foreign war, which, as it
tended to the repute of Lacedemon, should have in reason been prosecuted upon
their charges; Some thought, that these debates might have been easily
reconciled: for, many (at least some) of these taxes, had been granted to some
of Anaxagius his predecessors, for their own lifetime only; the subject
thinking, that the securest way to preserve his privilege, and the Prince
thinking it sufficient to satisfy his present necessity; and considering that
if his successors were able, either by love, or power, to command their people,
that then he might prorogate that tax for their lifetime also; but if
contrariwise, his successors would be so simple, as rather to beg, than to
acclaim these taxes as due, that then they could never expect to obtain them,
albeit they had been granted as appanages of the Crown; wherefore seeing the
Senate denied them only as due by succession, they thought, that the King might
either have past altogether from the superfluous desire, to derive them to
posterity, or at least might have superceded the prosecution of his royal
prerogative till a more favorable occasion, wherein his treasure might be
richer at home, his affairs in better order obroad, and the grievances of his
people fewer; and till he had been more surely fixed himself in his newly
mounted throne, and that for the present he might have acquiesced to a personal
concession of those taxes, which they could not refuse him more than to his
predecessors, seeing his necessities were as (if not more) urgent than theirs.
Others advised him not to pass from, but to change these taxations, in others
as lucrative, and less odious; such as the imposition of a tenth part of all
pleas and legal pursuits, as should be found to be calumniatory, and intended
to vex litigiously their honest neighbors; which would be both profitable to
the treasury, and pleasing to the subject; both because these taxes seem
always most tolerable, which are least universal, and which the subjects may
evite; and which if they evite not, not the Prince who is the imposer, but the
subjects who are the contraveeners are to be blamed; as also, because those
taxes are for repressing of vice, and so must be in themselves good, seeing they
are contrary to what is evil. He was likewise desired to change all
corporeally-penal Statutes unto pecunial mulcts; as the cutting off of an arm,
unto so many crowns: for, by cutting off the arm, in place of satisfying the
Commonwealth which is offended by the crime, the Commonwealth is yet more
wronged by augmenting the number of her beggars (such as those are, who being
mutilated of their members, cannot employ them for to gain their bread) and so
necessitated in charity, to aliment those, who have wronged her in malice.

There is also another mean, whereby this grievance of levying money by taxes
may be averted, and that galling sore cured by an easier remedy; which is, By
heightning the Crown Rents to the true avail, whereby the King's purse may be
fed with what grows upon his own ground: but the Officers of State have
always opposed this, as an enemy to their expectations; for, if this were
used, then should not Courtiers get Lands, worth five hundred pounds yearly, as
if they amounted not to three hundred pounds; nor should they exchange or buy
Lands from the Prince at so easy a rate, as now they do. Princes likewise,
should hear the meanest grievance of the poorest subject, against Toll-masters,
themselves, and not refer the cognizance of such debates to his Courtiers, who
being pensioners to these money-suckers, cannot but acquit themselves as
favorable Judges, where their interest is debateable: As also, by such
Delegations; Customers are encouraged to fleece the poor people, who, like
sheep, dare not open their mouths, and the Prince is robbed of the right of
appellations, which should be accounted one of the chief Jewels of his Crown:
besides this, many judge it expedient that the Prince should, after that such
taxes are granted to him by the people, assign portions of it to those to whom
he is debtor; as to Ambassadors, to Merchants, to his Navy, etc. whereby he
may save the expenses of Collectors; as also he may obviate the importunity and
avarice of Courtiers, who absorbes it often in gifts and pensions, before the
King receives it in to his coffers. Others allege, that the Prince should
compel those, who having farmed the customs have enriched themselves, hereafter
to be his Customers, allowing them a petty sallary, and so to inform him how he
may enrich himself with his own, as they have enriched themselves with what is
his; and in my own judgment I prefer either of these ways, to that way which
has been formerly practiced by the Lacedemonian Senate, in deputing some of
their number to distribute what is granted: for, either these will condescend
through complacency or fear, to follow the current of the Kings inclinations,
and in that case are superfluous, or else the King and Court will become their
implacable enemies, in which case all become factilus. There were many other
advices furnished to his Majesty, but his Courtiers pressed him not to suffer
his Royal Prerogative to be so obumbrated, and that he who yields once ground,
is always followed, and is glossed to be of kin to a coward.

This grievance in the State, was seconded by many grievances in the Church;
the Church and State being like the soul and body, whereof the one follows
always the temperament of the other.

Pretended zeal is always the stepmother of true loyalty; and such a crime as
treason would seem horrid, if it were not palliated by imaginary Religion; and
many Statesmen, perpending how many Religions have been at first hatched,
merely to tame wild humors, which albeit they have been known to their first
founders to be the product of their own brains, yet have thereafter been by
their posterity embraced as sacred truths, and the violaters of them punished
as blasphemers, do therefore conclude, that possibly, if not probably, these
truths which they now profess, are come from the same mint-house, since they
carry the same impressa; and therefore are merely subservient to their secular
ends: and that seeing they cheat others in making profession of their zeal for
Religion, when really they have none, nor cares for none, Why may it not be
probable, that others have after the same way, hatched these opinions which
they and others do in a manner believe; as also these Statists see, that events
ordinarily answer their expectation, and are consequential to their designs,
which induces them to believe, that providence and policy differs only as do
two words: as also these two maxims, That all men have more or less of
implicit faith which obliges them to believe what Ecclesiastics say; and that
other, That we ought not to confine Religion within the narrow boundaries of
reason: I say, these two induces men often to anchor their faith upon that which
is in it self most unreasonable, and stimulates men to act many things not only
without asking a reason why they should do so, but even oft-times when there
are many pregnant reasons tendered them why they should not do so, and when men
are once engaged in these bigot quarrels, their order is both inexprimable and
irresistible; they fear not death, since they expect to be covered by the
target of providence; or, if they fall under Religions Standard, they are
confident that their cause will canonize them; they respect not friends, nor
spare not their relations, as thinking themselves more nearly realted to the
gods than to any else: and thus oft-times the gods are made the patrons of
rebellion, and their temples, asyles in which the wickedest offender dare
sanctuary himself.

This was one of those pretended quarrels, which both the Lacedaemonians and
Athenians incensed the people by, against Anaxagius; the Nobles in both
Nations, finding that the Mufties did enhance all preferments, and were
beginning to seek restitution of those Churchlands which had at first been
doted to pious uses, and which were thereafter, because of the debordings of
Churchmen, taken by the State, and bestowed upon the Nobles, because else, they
had never condescended that old abuses should be reformed, seeing they were
still disposers of those Church Revenues themselves before that innovation; the
Nobles therefore resolved that they would pull away those Mufties from about
the Throne, pretending Religion, and intending gain; alleging that these were
innovators, and did busy themselves only in State affairs.

These were the main hinges of all the Lacedemonian troubles, yet they were not
the sole; for besides these may be numbered the nimious clemency of the Prince,
and the depraved factiousness of the subjects: As for the Prince, he was a
superstitious adorer of his subjects repose, and desired rather to have his
own, than his subjects blood spilt; and albeit it was often remonstrated to him,
that the surest way to reign, was by the scepter rather of power than of love:
for power and austerity was in his own hand, and depended upon none else;
whereas the scepter of love was swayed by the hand of a popular affection,
which was as volatile as themselves; and by it he was rather their slave, than
their Prince, and that his rigidity (if it were a fault) yet was but personal,
and infected none besides himself; but his clemency, was the nursery of all
those enormities wherewith the Land swarmed; and seeing vicious persons sinned
not, more through fear of punishment, than through love to virtue, that Prince
who bewrayed too much clemency, did proclaim an im^unity to all vice; and that
subjects were like a top which did run the fleetlier that it was sometimes
lasht; neither could that Prince expect to be obeyed, who punished not
disobedience, notwithstanding of all those Remonstrances made to him by his
friends, and of all the dangers which were foreseen by his prying spirit; yet
he resolved st^ll, rather to be good than great, and to make the hearts of his
subjects the throne whereon he would only sit; saying, that it was the part of
a subject to revenge, but of a King to pardon; and seeing the actions of
predecessor Kings, were the register of their successors, he resolved to learn
his posterity how to pardon; knowing that revenge and corruption would teach
them to^ well how to punish; that the gods, whose vicegerents they were,
gloried more in this attribute than in any else, and that the King of the Bees
(which is an hierogliphick of Monarchy) wanted a sting: these were his
principles, and proved his bane: and he who was mistaken in nothing else, was
mistaken in this; for, albeit the gods arrogate clemency as their special
attribute, yet that is because the injuries of mortals cannot reach them;
whereas the rebellion of subjects can, and often does ruin Princes: and the
omnipotent gods can at any time easily both foresee and repair those wrongs
which they have suffered, yet a King and his government may receive a wound,
which none will be able to cure; and he may, by the malice of his adversaries,
be thrown into a ditch, out of which none can recover him: And albeit a Prince
may pardon those crimes which are committed against his own person, yet he
neither can nor should pardon those crimes which are perpetrated against his
government and authority; which since it is not his property, and to which
seeing he is only administrator, he can no more delapidate, than a tutor can
dispense with those who wrong his pupils estate. As to the perverseness of the
subject, it was also one of the cards wherewith this fatal game was played;
for, albeit at first the crime resided in few, yet did thereafter extend it
self to all; for, albeit the number of those who disaffected the Royal interest
in the Senate was but small, yet those few vexed all, and perverted many of
those who were at first but neuters, and those public Conventions are like
Watches, which will not go soundly if but any wheel or pi^ be in disorder: for
as in the natural, so in the politic body, a sore in any part is able to
disquiet all the other members: thus it is here; for those who were
dissatisfied, did so by the pestiferous breath of their treasonable discourses,
infect others, that they became now as numerous as they were formerly viperous;
and at last dared to ventilate those treasonable discourses even in the
Senate House; thinking that the only way to engage the remanent members in
their quarrels. Anaxagius challenging these discourses, and desiring the
authors should be put in the claws of justice, this was refused him, so that
now the cancer of jealousy did begin to spread, and one of the Senators when
this debate was tabled, enveighed thus against the Kings suite.

Gentlemen, seeing I am to enter the lists of this debate, I am glad I should
have Justice for my Client, and you for my Judges, not merely because I know
that ye are interested (albeit that be likewise true) but because I know you to
be both judicious, and experienced; judicious, whereby ye may know what is
reasonable, and experienced, whereby ye may know what has been the
uncontroverted privilege of this House; and albeit all the Lacedaemonians were
assembled, yet would I appeal by choice to your judgments, to whom I must
necessarily now appeal, as being chosen by them to be their Representatives.
Gentlemen, seeing Liberty is that by which we are differenced from beasts, it
follows necessarily, that the more free men are, the more they are elevated
above a brutal humor, and the more Liberty they lose, the nearer they verge
upon brutishness: how necessary must Freedom be to subjects, seeing without it
they are rather slaves than subjects; and of all the Liberty which subjects can
contend for, that of debating freely before any Taxation or Law be statuted
(which is our case) is the most considerable: for, seeing Kings are very apt to
impose and exact Taxes, without the assistance of a Law, surely they will be
more rigid, when they will have the patronage of a Law to assist their
rigidity, and sein^ after any Statute is once made, the subject is not free to
control it, it is necessary that he have some freedom indulged him in
controlling it before it be statuted; and who dare use this freedom, when it is
hedgedin on all sides by fear of Treason, and of Court-hatred? whereby he will
certainly risk, and may possibly lose both his life and fortune; and albeit the
marches of subject-priviledges be already narrow, yet they will be more narrow
when such precipices are the marches; for then none will dare to approach the
outmost lines, fearing that fall which may prove irrecoverable; and if it shall
be licite to a King (who may prove a Tyrant, for goodness was never entailed
uninterruptedly upon any one succession) to challenge what is here debated
freely, may he not always forge some quarrel to pick out alternatly, those
whom he perceives most able to counterpoint him, and so shall leave us like
Wine which cannot relish well when the spirits are once extracted; and albeit
ye be all of you eminent, both for wit and experience, yet there are, and shall
always be some more eminent than others (for albeit all run well, yet all
cannot run equally) whom if the Prince who shall then reign, do remove, their
absence, and the terror injected upon other therethrough, will certainly
render this Judicatory altogether useless: Remember, Gentlemen, that ye are the
Hedge, planted to defend the Garden of this Nation from all oppressory
incursions; if ye be not pointed, and stick not near one another, enemies will
either leap over, or break through, and especially where the design is, to
steal away the golden apples of the subjects privileges, and seeing your
antcessors, have preserved for you this freedom, as a patrimony, endeavor to
derive it to your posterity; neither do ye prove banquerouts, of what your
fathers have been so parcimonious; and as ye all endeavor to accumulate riches
for them, so endeavor also to secure their privileges, without which their
estates are of small value.

This discourse did stir up those sparkles of rancour, which lay formerly
smothered in many of their breasts; and they concluded, that it was both fit
and just, to own and intercede for those who were challenged; and at last,
finding, that they could not prorogate their sitting themselves, without the
Kings special advice and consent; and finding that their many and great
projects could not be perioded without some considerable time, they resolved to
buy a lease of some years liberty to sit, with the grant of a taxation; and the
rather, because they considered, that they had most unjustly irritated his
Majesty already, as also, that these Taxes would in fine be taken, if they were
not given; whereupon their seance is continued by the King, and the taxes are
immediately exacted by their special approbation; yet so, that they inform the
people everywhere underhand, that their assent was extorted from them, and
that such a small morsel would rather sharpen than satisfy the appetites of
the insatiable Courtiers.

Now fear of being punished in some, and misinformation in others, did alienate
their minds fully from their obedience; Loyalty was now accounted slavery, and
the meanest act of jurisdiction, tyranny; yet businesses were not so ripened
yet, as that the leading men durst yet appear publicly, but the prologue of
this tragedy was committed to the people, who in a tumultuary way were sent
with extravagant Petitions, sometimes against the Favorites, and at other times
against the Mufties, the people being like the Sea, which the Nobles, Priests,
and Wits, like so many Winds make stormy or calm at their pleasure: In Athens
the women were ordinarily employed in such expeditions, knowing that both their
number and sex would plead immunitie for them from any deserved punishment. And
because their simplicity like the straw could kindle soonest; neither could
they be repressed, either by harrongues or the sword, the ordinary calmers of
such tempests, for as to reason they could not patient so long, as to hear it,
nor ponder it so maturely, as to understand it; neither would any man stain
the luster of his sword with the blood of a woman: Yet Autophilus the Viceroy
in Athens, was desired to punish the husbands of those irregular women, knowing
that they instigated them to, or at least connived at their disorders; either
of which was a crime which merited incarceration: as also, the husbands
punishment would easily tame these reasonless creatures; Or else, to lay fast
some of the plodding Nobles, whom they might keep as hostages for those
heteroclite factions. But Autophilus, as we shall hear afterward, favored too
much their projects, to punish their courses; for he, hating the Mufties
secretly, did desire both the King and them to act what might most incense the
people, and so made their own actions their burriers. The first mark at which
they did shoot those darts of popular fury, was on Basilicus, a Lacedemonian
(knowing that the way to weaken Anaxagius, was to waste the blood of his
principal veins) upon him they fastened the teeth of their envy, and it must
be treason against the people, not to punish him as a traitor; his accusation
is founded upon some excerpts gotten from one of his Majesty's Secretaries; but
what needs proofs, where death is once decreed? His Majesty's rigidity, which
could never be exerced against his enemies, must be now burrier to his friends,
like an unaturall heat in the body which can consume it self, but cannot
consume the meat which should rather be consumed by it.

When any thing falls to pieces, it is surely near ruin; and when a Nation
does by faction become two, it will probably at last become none at all:
wherefore when the Nobility does like an hair, begin to branch it self; the
King, like a skillful Barber, should crop it in that place, for certainly the
hair it self cannot then grow longer: Factions are those State-convulsions,
which can hardly be cured except they be soon adverted to, and after the
ringleaders of factions have once engaged many innocent subjects in their
quarrel, it is both difficult and dangerous to repress them; and they being the
roof under which many poor innocents have retired, ye cannot pull down the roof
without smooring those who are under it.

Another great inconvenience in factions (as there is nothing convenient in
them) is, That where the Standard is once erected, all the criminal and
discontented persons run to it, and must be both received and protected, both
to requite their kindness, and to invite others, So that these prove not only
the sanctuaries, but even the encouragers of malefactors; and as that person
cannot but be concluded distracted, who dashes his one hand or foot against the
other; So, that State must be thought demented, wherein the one half clashes
against the other; Lacedem^n and Athens jointly, were both disjoynted now by
factions in their Church, some adhering to their old rites and ceremonies,
whereupon they were called Saturnists; others were persuaded to embrace the
new, were named Iovists; worshipping Jupiter, because they conceived him most
rational, albeit not so old as Saturn, and who influenced most strongly upon
Princes; these last, were both more zealous, and more numberous, and did at
last impropriate to themselves all the Offices of the Nations, whereupon many
flocked to them, making Religion a mine, out of which they expected to dig gold
in abundance.

In the State of Athens there were likewise two factions, who like two twins
struggling in the womb of the Commonwealth, tortured vehemently their miserable
mother; the one faction was led by Autophilus, a man of a profound prudence,
and who had even from his youth sucked the breasts of State-education, and had
so familiarized himself with its mysteries, that they were become now no ways
mystical to him; but whose misfortune it was, that his fortune could rise no
higher, except it had disputed preference with the Royal Throne; and that is
the unhappiness of those happily born subjects, that naturally ambition
elevates them always above their own level, and yet their present state admits
of no higher to which they can pretend, without rivalling their Prince. So
ordinarily the eminentest of subjects, are born either to be fools or traitors;
from which they can hardly be diverted, except some foreign employment abroad,
or formidable Prince at home, either feed or starve that genial humor: This
made many allege, that Autophilus did in thoughts design himself to be Prince
of Lacedemon, intending to marry Anaxagius niece, and by inveighing against the
Queen, to get all her children declared bastards; and his sisters other
children declared rebels, by engaging them in a war against the Nation: but
these projects were so improbable, and so treasonable, that none could assent
thereto, but were rather construed to be forged by his enemies, than to be his
own, either wishes or hopes.

The other faction was founded by Phanosebus, a man of a deep reach, and one
who might have shared in the highest employment, if he could but have expected
it patiently; but he, like many others, did spill, by drawing violently to him,
what he might have had entire, if he had waited till it had been bestowed upon
him willingly: Many characterized him to be a man of more wit than virtue, and
of more cunning than of either, many followed him (as was said) merely because
they hated the other; so that he stood more engaged to the others miscarriages,
than he did to his own abilities: those who adhered to him, were such as could
signify nothing without him, and yet who with his assistance were successful
enough, yea, and too much; like ciphers, which without a figure signify
nothing, yet when joined to a figure makes the figure signify more than it
could do alone: Some in the body of this faction acted the mouth, and were
fitted for nothing else; others the hands, to execute what they had commanded;
and some the feet, to run where any thing was to be acted, till at last these
many parts got adjoined to them a Nose, which, because of its bigness,
overshadowed the face, and made the rest seem terrible; which, as is rela^^^ in
Lacedemon, did thereafter fall by the pox; yet possibly these are but
jealousies, and not proofs which can be adduced against him.

Both these factions fomented the increase of the Iovist faction, and were but
like small rivers running in to swell up that ocean: for, albeit they differed
in their aims, yet seeing they aimed both at the ruin of the Saturnists, they
concurred in that who could concur in nothing else; like two travelers, who
albeit their dwellings, or homes, be far separated, do ride together whilst the
way is the same; Yet the Iovists favored more Phanosebus faction, both because
they were most favored by them, as also because they jealoused Autophilus to
be too subtle.

Amongst the Phanosebists there was one Oranthus, a Gentleman whom hundreds of
years cannot parallel, as if Nature needed so much time to bring forth such an
Elephantine virtue, and whereof a Nation could lodge but one, as if it were not
able to bear two such great burdens of worth; this Gentleman was in affection a
Iovist, and persisted so, but hated in the end the Phanosebists, as persons
whose interests was their god, and whose godliness was their gain: for,
finding whom they intended to share the Provinces amongst themselves, under
pretext of regulating abuses, and preventing insurrections, did forsake them,
because he found that they had forsaken their duty, and refusing their
proffers, refused them also his assistance; thinking it Treason rather than
Reason, to assist them who resisted their Prince, and persisted in their
Rebellion: Yet did he always love the Iovist interests, albeit he hated some
of their darlings, and relinquished not their party, albeit he relinquished
their persons; wherefore finding his danger both imminent and eminent, he
posted to Anaxagius, and was by him commissionated to command his Army in
Athens; but before he went thither, he assembled his friends, and disclosed
thus to them all the mysteries that had past.

Gentlemen, State-designs are like herbs, which cannot be known at their first
starting-up; and errors may be pardoned, if they be not continued; especially,
where the pretexts are so specious, and the dissimulation so deep: this is both
our case, and our misfortune, and I may say our misfortunate case; we have been
nose-led by some, whose ends have been to end our loyalty, and to plot the
ruin of him who has kept them and this Nation from ruin ever hitherto; they
pretend piety, but who can be so childish as to think that these would open so
liberally both their veins and purses for that in public, for which they would
not open their very mouths in private? and how can we think that those who
would not bestow scarce a crown in charity, or an hour in prayer, clemency, and
pardoning of others, which are the essentials of Religion, will bestow all
their time and estates for the maintenance of what is but ceremonial.
Gentlemen, let us not give suck to these bastard projects, nor credit to these
improbable discourses, but let us both condemn and resist these intentions, let
us pay our Prince the tribute of respect, and respect such as will become his
tributaries; they have not yet monopolized the affection of the Nation, let us
endeavor to get them disaffected, and let our swords cut the knot of such
plots: the design is somewhat practicable, because the people cannot always be
cheated; for time will decipher cheats, and such vast projects cannot be
prosecuted without vast expenses, and many will weary of paying those who are
traitors, who would never weary to be traitors themselves; for certainly, all
men have, as they are men, some inclinations of being loyal and honest; and if
they unpath themselves from it, it is to follow the tract of some golden or
gilded vice; which if they miss, they will presently return: and it is
impossible that where all seek, that all can find, especially where there is so
little to be found by any, and where the Grandees will endeavor to enhance
all: They are likewise divided, and the one may help to destroy the other,
whilst we are endeavoring to destroy both. Anaxagius, against whom they war,
is so good, and his cause so just, that it were an offense against the immortal
gods to think that they will not favor him, and bless it; and albeit they be
numerous, and we few, yet let us not be discouraged; for desperate and unjust
exploits flourish always most first, whilst the actors have not time nor
convenience to reflect upon what they are doing; but at last when that fervor
is abated, their honesty will increase; Our cause is honorable, seeing it is in
defense of him who is the source of honor, and we shall find our recompense
paid us, both by our Consciences and our King; afterages shall admire our
memories, and erect memorials of our loyalty; and what we do by our swords,
shall be done over again by the pens of learned Historians. But to what purpose
shall I enlarge my self, seeing I know you to be Gentlemen, whose ancestors have
been the ramperts of this Nation, and loyal subjects to their Prince? Is it
possible that ye are heirs to all their estates, and to none of their worth?
or, may ye expect obedience from your yeomen, who will not defer it to your
Prince, to whom ye are tied by many oaths, whereas they are tied by none to
you? and under whom your predecessors have lived hundreds of years, whereas
theirs have lived under you but since yesterday; Can ye be so rigid exacters
from others, who are so bad payers your selves? Let us then hazard our lives
before they be taken from us; or at least, lest we live to say, that we have
lived too long, as having outlived the freedom of our Nation, and security of
our Prince?

All admired, and the most part allowed this discourse, and condescended to
list themselves amongst his followers, and to run the common hazard with him,
knowing that the hazard could be but either small, or at least glorious, where
the Conducter was both so skillful and so generous.

This good cause was followed with good success; for, the Athenians
considering, that the raising of an Army was requisite, if not necessary, seeing
that which is unnatural cannot be maintained without violence, and thinking,
that the only way to make themselves formidable to their Prince (those
capitulations being most favorable which are written with the point of the
sword) and most fit, seeing it would remunerate their friends and dependances,
as being a mean to afford them salaries and employments, did raise a numerous
Army well equipped: For horse-courses which had been always much frequented,
both out of pleasure and policy in that Nation, had stored them with excellent
horses: And surely that Nation is happy, where trains consist most in gallant
men and able horses, which may serve as well in war as in peace; rather than in
laquies, who are both roguish and undiscreet; and in coaches, which are both
expensive, effeminate and useless; and which habituate men so, that they can
neither ride, nor suffer themselves to be exposed to the fa^igues of wind or
rain: that Nation was likew^se well armed, each man's house being an arsenal,
and each arsenal able to arm numbers of men; which some kept for pleasure,
but the most part for intestine discords; for to be neighbors, and to be at
variance, were always joined: Peace having thus prepared the materials, it was
easy for war to arm it self, which did afterward like the prodigal, spend
totally that great stock which its predecessor had laid up for it. Neither was
their Courage wanting more than Arms; for none was so niggard of his life, as
to spare it at this occasion: Yet this chariot of war had other wheels besides
that of courage; for, young men went out of gallantry, old men out of zeal, and
both out of avarice; knowing that Lacedemon, where they were to march, was a
rich meadow, where they might all feed abundantly, leaving their host nothing
but their leanness to pay their reckoning; so that they seemed like bees to go
out of their barren hive, to suck honey from the flowers of the neighboring
gardens; this was the golden whistle wherewith their cunning huntsmen called
these grayhounds to the prey; and it is often the greatness of the prize which
makes the goodness of the cause. After these were all marched, Oranthus
enters the Athenian bounds, backed by none but by the Royal Commission, which
made his cause good, but not his party strong; Yet at last some from all
corners flocked to him, the Royal Standard being an Orator eloquent enough, to
persuade those who could hear with loyal ears, and who reverenced not their
estates as their King, thinking gold the prince of hearts as it is of metals:
It was reported by some, that the Iovists had placed domestic Priests in each
family, for the service of their household gods, to remark men's actions, and to
convince themselves, or at least to tutor the wives, by whom they might
thereafter know the husbands; and that this restrained somewhat the
confluencing of the subjects to Or^nthus: but these were rather personal
prejudices, than true conjectures. Others alleged, that Oranthus pride
deterred others from joining with him, as being a person, who as he was in
worth equalled by none, so who in pride surpassed all: But that likewise was a
mistake, for what was called in him pride, was really prudence; for he
considered prudently, that those who kept a distance with all, will be tempted
to reveal their secrets to none, and will have time and convenience to canvasse
fully what is fittest to be done upon every emergent; However, if this was his
fault, he was happy in being tainted with no other fault but this; and his
excess in his carriage to his equals, was compensed with the moderation used by
him to his inferiors; for, as they branded him with the one, so they could not
but allow him the other: It was admirable how a body inured to much ease, could
endure so much trouble: for, in spite of his former custom, he accustomed
himself to dispense with what pleasure he enjoyed formerly, showing the world,
that as his spirit was of gold, so his body was of brass, and it appeared that
he had changed his body as well as his opinion; or rather, that his body
resolved rather to suffer the hardest of hardships, before it would suffer so
rare a soul as his was to change its dwelling, and quit its imbracements;
grass was his best bed, stones his ordinary pillows, and the heavens his
continual cannopy; his drink was water, and his diet opportunity; his
counselors few, and his enemies many, and yet it appeared that providence kept
those from him, merely to show that without these he could conquer, and that
Oranthns alone was strong enough for these many.

The Senate of Athens resolved to fight him before he became stronger,
whereupon they dispatched some Forces under the conduct of Phanosebus, who was
no sooner seen than vanquished; as if he had come not to fight, but to render
only, he himself whose legs was armed with swiftness, did run as if he had
pawned his life against death, who should run fastest: After this many followed
the Conqueror who would not have followed Oranthus, and seeing fortune came to
encamp with him, many came to incamp with fortune. It was thought folly in
Phanosebus, whose strength lay mainly in his wit, to hazard in those
employments, where rather strength than wit was requisite; for, as some said,
it was an unbeseeming a Statesman to act the Soldier, as it was to a Physician
to practice in Law, and especially where the adversaries valor was redoubled,
and that by so doing he wronged himself without wronging his enemies; for
thereafter many said, that he was neither stout nor fortunate: whereas if he
had stayed at home, he might have salved his repute in both, and might have
kept himself as a Reserve, making his friends, after they should have been
often beat without him, hope that they should conquer when he went along with
them; and seeing fortune is half play-maker in all humane actions, it is a great
disadvantage for a great undertaker to be thought misfortunate: but surely his
motive was, that he feared lest Oranthus should flourish too much, and that it
would be too late resisting him when he would become both more skilful, and
more famous.

This victory was seconded by many others, so that he conquered as often as he
fought; yea, rather he could not fight without conquering; all his actions were
maturely deliberated, and speedily executed, and so could not be but
successful: His Army consisted partly of natives, partly of foreigners, the
one whereof did emulate the other in courage, and so could not both but act
gallantly, seeing gallantry was their motive: The foreigners behoved to fight,
knowing that else they had not any where else to ^refuge themselves, in having
neither their own homes, nor the houses of their friends to shelter them, and
would not flee because they knew not where. The natives were assured of the
gallows, if they ensured not themselves by their courage; and their quarter was
no pardon, but a respit from death; not a preserving them from the sword, but a
reserving them for the block, that so ignominy might be put upon themselves,
and terror left upon their welwishers.

Many of that Nation exclaimed against the cruelty used by his Soldiers, and
their other exorbitances; but these adverted not when his Army wanted pay, and
so he was necessitated to allow them plunder; neither should they have so
exclaimed against him upon that account, seeing their relenting in coming in to
him did oblige him to employ strangers, whose enormities were the only crime of
his well-disciplined Army: neither was it strange to see those who were starved
in the hills and deserts, eating often nothing but roots, and drinking nothing but
water, drink and feed somewhat liberally when they came where they might have
it, and even exerce some cruelty toward those who caused those their many
miseries; however, a General may govern men, yet cannot he make men, not alter
their inclinations^ and as they relate at Athens, never General (...) so
reconcile different humors, nor govern so prudently rash and impudent
Soldiers, as he did; his Army was divided in factions, and opposed by
factions, yet did salve the inconveniency of the one, and guard wise against
the inconveniency of the other, making himself an arbiter when they were at
variance amongst themselves, and a target when they were assaulted by their
enemies.

The Phanosebeans and the Autophilists, were vying all this while for
precedence, the Clergy and Cities adhering to the Phanosebeans, many of both
being stipendiated by him, the Nobility and Gentry following Autophilus; their
main aim being to repress the Mufties, thinking to stop there; but it is hard
for any who tumbles down the hill of vice, to stop till he have once run down
to its root; for vice is none of those manageable horses who can be stopped in
the midst of their carrier; and since man is naturally so depraved, as that he
cannot abstain from what is ill; what may we expect of him when his depraved
humor is fortified by these depraved habits? and many have gone aside from
their way, intending presently to return, who having once strayed, were never
able to return to it; and the immortal gods deal most justly with mortal men in
this: for, to think that men can be good at pleasure (much more then, to think
that he is able to exchange vice for virtue in an instant) is to exalt man upon
the pinnacle of arrogances temple; and if the event answered the expectation,
besides the original depravednesse of man's humor, man should likewise be
invited both to be wicked, and to continue in his wickedness by this happy and
succes^full encouragement; neither should goodness be taken as a donative from
heaven, but should be esteemed such a flower is might grow in the baddest soil
upon earth.

Albeit then the Autophilists intended not to spin out the thread of their
opposition to their Prince to such a length as the Phanosebeans did* yet, being
once engaged, the hatred they bore some privatly-well-affected persons, and
their desire to overreach the Phanosebeans, did oblige them both to act and
suffer what did really run cross to their humor.

Yet in spig^^ of all endeavors used by the Autophilists, the other faction
were the darlings of the Iovist Clergy, which Cletus, brother to Autophilus,
perceiving, he resolved to defeat them with their own weapons, and to pretend
as much zeal as the others could; whereupon knowing, that all extraordinary
changes must be effectuated by extraordinary means, he alleges that he is
pang'd by his conscience for his but lukewarm affection to the Iovist faction;
and sending for some of their Grandees, he entreated them to suffer him to
appear in sackcloth before the Altars, to hear sacrifice offered there for
himself to atone this sin; they thinking his remorse to be heart-deep, agree to
the motion; So that Clitus is now admitted to prostrate himself before the
Altar, in the presence of many thousands, whom the extraordinarinesse of the
action, as a bell, had called hither, where with all pomp and solemnity
imaginable, he is absolved from that crime; and is permitted to harrangue the
bystanders, whose hearts, like good ground; were soon softened by those showers
of tears, which deluged from his eyes, and were persuaded that he was now,
because of his piety, incantonized amongst the gods, so that now the Iovists
(glad to bridle the one faction with the fear of the other, and willing that
they should emulate one another, hoping thereby to aggrandize their own
respect) did carress both almost equally.

Phanosebus would never embrace any charge himself from the Senate, knowing
that thereby he would be obliged to appear always himself, and to subscrive
Papers, wherein the actings of these times should be preserved, and reserved as
monuments of their madness: as also he should be necessitated thereby to
remain always at Athens, and should want the convenience of retiring himself
at inconvenient occasions, but he caused prefer these, who being his creatures,
he was confident would be at his devotion.

At last Ora^tbus, oppressed by their numbers, and deserted by his money-less
Soldiers, becomes their prisoner; betrayed by an ignominious rascal, who sold
that pricelesse Gentleman to the Athenian Senate, buying with his price
perpetual infamy to himself and his posterity; and is by them condemned to be
hanged publicly, and his legs and arms to be fixed upon public poles: who
being brought to the Scaffold, delivered this Speech.

Gentlemen,
I Regrate not so much my own fall, as I do the fall of the Royal Standard, and
that mine enemies should use my ruin as an argument to prove the goodness of
their quarrel: I know they deck my death with their inhumane triumphs, to make
death seem the more terrible to me, and my cause seem the more undesirable to
others: But as for me, seeing the cause for which I suffer is just, the more I
suffer, the more the immortal gods and my kind prince are my debtors; and the
more remarkable they make it, the more famous shall it prove to posterity. I
have always esteemed them happy who lie upon the brinks of times impetu^^s
river, remarking how it glides away swiftly, bubling up bells here and (...)
(whereof the greatest are always the least durable) and dissolving them
instantly, whereof two or three sometimes join together and shortly ruin each
other; and in other places, foaming through rage and spite, (...) some rock or
stone retards its violent course; but unhappy are th^se who delights too much
to swim in it, and as it were by way of compliment, to run along with its
streams: yet seeing happiness consists in action, and since it is unnatural in
any man, to be a willing (or at least an idle spectator of his Countries
miseries (for to be idle, is in some ways to be willing in things commanded by
duty) I admire him most who acts most for it, and who, like the bees, will
sting him who intends either to remove or to wrong their hive, I am condem^ed
as guilty of treason, because I obeyed my Prince, against whom treason only can
be committed; and seeing it had been treason if I had disobeyed, how can my
obedience make me a traitor? I am accounted cr^el, but can truly be no more
reputed such, than he who endeavors with rebukes and lashes to reduce a
run^agate and runaway servant to the obedience of his kind and condescending
master: Neither I hope shall others be frighted by these my sufferings, s^ing
misfortun's balls can^^t hit always the same mark; and I hope others shall be
admitted to build that palace to which we have only served as Quarriers; and
albeit they should meet death either in the Camp, or upon a Scaffold, why
should that terrify them? seeing to die so is to die in the arms of honor*
after which they may expect to have a Monument of Fame erected for them:
Whereas those who put the hour-glasse of their life in the trembling hand of
fear, will oft-times have it broken un^xpectedly, by a fall both dishonorable
and irrecoverable.


This discourse being ended, the Executioner first hanged, and then quartered
him; and the very Scaffold, dyed with his blood, seemed to blush at the cruelty
of his Judges; all condemning their cruelty, and admiring his courage, so that
Sampson-like (as Christians use to say) he overcame more at his death than he
did in his life: teaching Statesmen never to execute publicly, those who are
loved generally; and thus was extinguished by the puddle of faction and malice,
that lamp which was kindled by the hand of providence.

Anaxagius affairs in Lacedemon were by this time wholly ruined; for, the
specious pretext of liberty being displayed as a banner by the Senate, all the
Commons rendezvouzed themselves under it; and albeit their consciences, and
experience did thereafter inform them sufficiently of their error, yet fear of
being punished, obliged them to continue in their crime, telling them in the
ear, that albeit their cause was bad, yet their danger was inevitable.

Anaxagius own servants likewise did sing their own parts in this treasonable
song; for they (as they pretended, when challenged by their friends)
foreseeing their masters ruin, which they were not able to resist, resolved
rather to stand without him, than fall with him; like those who having sailed
long in a pretty ship, finding that she is like to split, do break away a piece
off her, whereon they may come ashoare in safety. But it is no wonder to see
the Devil, who cheated the judgment before the commission of the sin, cheat
the conscience after it is once committed; and by such impious sophistry,
defend his cheats against the just accusations of piety and duty. These
miscreants did pick nightly his Majesty's pockets, and send doubles of his
Letters to his enemies, whereby both his plots were discovered, his friends
laid open to his enemies malice, and likewise his own repute hugely tashed;
for, some finding their correspondence with him, and only known (as they
thought) to him, thus revealed; concluded that he beho^ved himself to be the
revealer: And certainly, ^his scarred even his most loyal friends from
corresponding with him, who albeit they durst ^ot harbor such disparaging
thoughts of him ^s that was, Yet shunned to throw themselves (...) that snare,
wherein they saw others both ^atched and murdered.

Another cardinal error in Anaxagius, was, That upon the tumults and
insolences of the ^^ulgar sort in the City of Lacedemon, he re^^quished the
City, fearing that these fat^l ^omets did animate some signal alteration: But
by his flight, he rather increased their jealousy, than evited their
clamourous malice, which was so swift-footed as to pursue him where^ever he
went; for, in his absence the author^ of these seditions, did not now fear to
be revealed, nor, when revealed, to be so sharp^^ punished as formerly: Whereas
if he had stayed at Lacedemon, his generous and modest ^^portment would have
refuted most of these malicious and groundless discourses which were now
openly ventilated against him; the City likewise finding, that he misconstrue^
them so far, as to think himself not secur^ whilst amongst them, did now join
with the Senate, cordially advancing them money, where by both Army and Navy
was maintained, an^ whereby those who followed Anaxagius were entised to
cantone themselves in the Senat^ faction; neither could the Senate comman^ the
Navy without the Navy from whom (...) its materials could only be expected.
Where^upon a Gentleman said to his Majesty one mor^ning, That a King was like
the heart, which when it is by any unnatural motion remove^ from its wonted
seat, that certainly its dissolution must ensue shortly.

It is likewise firmly believed by many in the Nation, that the Senate fearing
lest the K^^ of Egypt, brother to their Queen, should se^^ some auxiliary
Forces against them, did by their Ambassadors buy with considerable sums
Sophander's friendship, representing likewise covertly, that such a War would
pick his Masters purse, leaving little or nothing to his friends and
favorites, who otherwise might expect largely; and that it was the interest of
Egypt, to see Lacedemon in such a hubbub. They likewise treated with the
Commonwealth of Corinth, to advance them Arms, promising that they should have
liberty of fishing in their Seas, without any toll: a privilege which the
Corinthians feared Anaxagius would both question and recall.

The Sun of Anaxagius power was beginning to set, the Nobles, of whom his Army
consisted mostly in Lacedemon, were, like flies, returning in the cool of the
evening; and many attributed his ruin to their military disorders, and
unskilfulness: for, each of them behoved to be preferred to some command in the
Army, which occasioned, that those who had followed martial employments abroad
formerly, were constrained to sue for employments from the Senate; as also the
jars and emulations which were amongst themselves, destroyed the common unity,
and made the Soldiery fear, that the house which had so many rents, would one
^^y fall; and that those would prove in end wisest, who retired soonest: But
contrariwise the Senate governed their Army most prudently, preferring
experienced Soldiers to the most eminent charges, and proveanting them most
opportunely upon all occasions; for, having the City at their devotion, it did
suppediate them both with money, pitch, cordage, and other materials for their
Fleet, and by the assistance of the Fleet they victualled their Army in all
places: whereas Anaxagius Army destitute of such necessaries, were constrained
to prey upon the Country, and thereby lost totally their affections. The Senate
likewise doted their Army with all privileges imagi^able; for they licensed
the Apprentices of all Cities, and of all Trades, to serve in their Army, and
there to fulfill those years for which they were bound to their Masters; As also
they recompensed with Offices in the State all such as had merited well of the
State in the Army, and received their lame Soldiers in hospitals, and
pensioned some others who were more eminent, and erected tombs for those who
were killed in their service; punishing severely all who either openly or
covertly promoted or favored Anaxagius interest.

The Senate weary at last of being either authors or spectators of these bloody
conflicts, which happened daily betwixt Anaxagius Armies and theirs, resolved to
patch up these differences, and to seek now by treaty what they formerly would
have extorted by war; perceiving that they expended more treasure in the
pursuit of their privileges, than they could gain by them, albeit granted: and
that Anaxagius successors would reassume what Anaxagius would be obliged now
to concede; which the Army perceiving, and concluding that their gain would be
hereby totally drained; for the intended peace behoved to infer a disbanding of
their Forces: and albeit an Act of Amnesty would lull them asleep in a promised
security, yet old quarrels would be one day wakened by the malice of those,
whose friends and kinsmen they have cut down; or by the avarice of Courtiers,
who would endeavor to render them criminal, because their estates were
opulent: Wherefore they concluded, that it was fit to possess themselves of
Anaxagius person, that so a peace should not be concluded but at their
pleasur^, or at least if it were concluded, that it should be to their
advantage; and that any courtesy should be conferred upon him, might be taken
as a donative bestowed by them. These were the pretexts which Autarchus,
General of the Lacedemonian Forces, used, to induce his Soldiers to an assent
in this particular, but his thoughts levelled at another mark; for he was at
this time laying the foundations of his future greatness, a structure which his
subtility and boldness did afterward rear to an unspeakable height.

Autophilus did now find by the designs broached, that he and his adherents
would be smothered under the ruin of Anaxagius government, if it did once
fall; and that those Merculiasts (for so were they termed who owned the Army,
because they worshipped Mercury) intended to pluck up the branches of Nobility,
with the root of Monarchy, did now condemn his first projects as disloyal in
themselves, and, as prejudicial to his own subsistence; whereupon he addresseth
himself to Anaxagius, and gets a Commission from him to levy thirty thousand
men in Athens, which he effectuated accordingly; for, his faction, which was
numerous in it self, was swelled up greater by the concourse of those who
affectionated Oranthus; and who found that Phanosebus would have massacred
them, if they had not refuged themselves at this Altar. But both the one and
the other were animated by the horrid usage which their Prince did meet with
from the Mercurialists: those who had been loyal formerly continuing so still;
and those who had been disloyal, thinking their zeal for him now, the only way
to deprecate his wrath, and satisfy their own consciences.

This Army marches, carrying along with it both all the warriors and warlike
furniture of the Nation; and, as providence had taugh^ that Nation formerly,
that few, assisted by it, might beat many; So it taught them now, that many,
when resisted by it, might be beat by few; teaching in both, that it uses
numbers rather as a shadow than a sword, employing sometimes those, lest
ordinary means should altogether be neglected, and vanquishing often without
these, lest ordinary means should be too much relied upon; and least, in both,
divine patience should be omitted. But these proved like the Witches, who can
do ill, but cannot do good; and albeit they had raised the Devil of Rebellion,
yet could they never lay him again, the heavens disdaining that any of its
infant projects should de nursed by those who were once its enemies.

Phanosebus had all this while opposed this design, not but that he wished the
releasment and enlargement of his Prince; but hating that he should be released
by the Autophilists, esteeming every thing lawful or unlawful, accordingly as
it could advance or rebute that interest. Wherefore after the Autophilists were
marched, he levyes some inconsiderable persons, who had lain at home, like some
chaff in the corner of a barn, after the wheat is all carried away. These were
with much cunning trysted to the fields, not out of any intention to fight (for
if they had dreamed of that, they had never moved) but as if it had been only
to recreate themselves; yet then they were once mustered, they mustered all
their courage in their faces, which they were necessitated to do, because their
hearts refused to lodge such an unruly guest; and seeing their breasts were
already filled with golden hopes, they judged it folly to fill them with
thoughts of steel: thus they resolved to conquer all, because they saw none to
be conquered; and cartelled by their eyes all who would swear that they had
neither arms nor courage: Here stood one in arms, complaining that his iron
coat was too stiff; and besides him stood his fellow, whose armor was armed
with rust, which desired to be left at home to recruit the plough as formerly,
pleading exemption, as not being betwixt sixty and sixteen, and so not obliged
to go to the fields, but by twenty years older than both; telling him how they
had fifty years since hindered his fathers flight, who because thereof had
vowed never to bring them abroad again: and withal that the bearing armor was
too weighty an employment for a clown, but whilst they are thus busied, an old
wife, or rather one so old as that it could not be known whither she was a
wife; complained to a Captain, that her son had stolen away from her, a thing
wherein her hens hatched their eggs, which he called a steel-cap, and which was
at that present upon his head; which the young Captain slighted, calling her
old hagg, and telling her that they were vexed in defending her and such others
from their enemies: whereat she became enraged, and commanding her old hands by
a young heart, pulls him from his saddle, from which the least pull could
easily have invited him, the saddle it self disdaining to serve such a childish
master: The field wherein they mustered appeared a comedy, wherein cowards
acted gallantry; but that gallantry was defectively monstrous, because it
wanted hands, yet they seemed Basilisks, who could kill with their eyes, which
seemed granades, from which they did shoot thousands of murdering looks, their
mouths were the Arsenals where they kept all their arms, yet their safety
lodged in their legs, which had proven their trusty friends in many other
occasions: When they were all thus convocated, the trumpet breathes them out a
march, but, alas, their unexperienced horses begun to dance at such music
(where those danced best who had learned least) and did instantly send their
masters to the ground, as if they wished them to dance there also, seeing they
could not dance on horseback: their Commanders thought, that they had lighted
to kiss hands with the ground their old acquaintance, with which these clowns
had spent most of their time; but alas, they, poor creatures, did lie there,
persuaded by fear, that they had been overthrown by their enemies, and like
assaulted travellours, who throw away to the robbers their purses before they
should be violently taken from them, were breathing out their souls willingly
to death, fearing lest it would open another passage than their mouth to
facilitate their esc^pe. But amongst those many, who were all remarkable, there
was one whom fear had marked for its own head-quarter; this fellow had gotten
from his wife a linen bag, with some raw flesh, which had sealed its impressa
in blood upon the outside of the bag; which the coward perceiving in this
twilight of fear, imagined that it had been tinctured with his own blood, which
occasioned his present death: here lay one opening his eyes, and presently
closing them again, fearing, lest fear should wound them, if they were not
armed with his eyelids: only in this playing the gallant, that he could not
endure to see either himself, or his friends wronged: over him crosse-wayes,
did lie another, crossed extremely by his own timer^usnesse, crying.
misericorde, misericorde, imagining firmly, that his enemies was searching i^
his bowels where his life was hid: Not (...) from them was a third, who had
covered his face with a mask of paleness, desiring not to be known, and hoping
that none could expect to find life, where no blood was to be seen, and had
given order to his looks, to tell those who had searched for his life, that it
was gone to the other world to complain of their hard usage* yet at last, time
persuaded them to believe their eyes, witnesses, which they had formerly
declined as suspect; so that now they re-assembled themselves, like (...) who
had formerly fled from a shower, (...) met, did conclude that trumpets were
unlawful instruments, and as being music, were to be abominated, as contrary
to the rites of their Church; and determined also, that they would to convocate
them use a bell, a conceit which as it suited well with their Ecclesiastic
ceremonies, so fit for such a flock of sheep: But the great debat^ was, what
they should carry in their standard yet at last they agreed to carry a sheep in
it, to testify the innocence of their cause, with (...) bell about its neck:
but to testify that their innocence was armed, they were perswade^ by their
General to give the sheep horns; al things thus prepared, they take their
horses, and are advised by him to make them observe Lent, in not giving them
flesh for forty days, as a punishment for dismounting their masters: and now
these bastard sons of Mars, upon whom he had bestowed rodomantade words and
looks; being ready to march, they, by the help of a stone, mount their weak
horses, being sadled with straw, and bridled with hair, and seemed at every
step to have wagered, whether their horses did rise higher from the ground, or
they from their saddles; resembling a young Gentleman, who at his first setting
to Sea, is deserted by his feet, and tossed by the merciless waves, looking on
horseback like patients on a close-stool: thus ^^^^grech fruit were flourishing
in their march, tumbled up and down by their unskilfulness in horsmanship, like
the young bud of tender branches by a gentle gale of Northern wind; the more
the horses vaulted, the nearer they clapped their spurs to them, but the poor
beasts who understood no more such imbracements, than their beastly masters did
understand the Art of Horsemanship, did, by kicking and flinging, show their
displeasure: whereupon a witty fellow told some of them, That it was no wonder
that their irrational beasts could not abide to be spurred cruelly by their
masters, seeing the masters themselves could not endure (though rational) to be
spurred gently to their duty by their Prince: Which observe touched them so
nearly, that they vowed never to fight any till that fellow were removed; which
behoved to be obeyed, albeit their General entreated them to permit him to
stay, to learn them how to sit on horseback: which was refused, whereof the
Gentleman seemed very glad, fearing that if ever they did engage with their
enemies, they should either leave him, else he behoved to leave his courage.
But before I leave this discourse, I must tell you a pretty jest of a
Gentleman, who being appointed an Officer in the Army, was as dejected thereat
as if they had condemned him to fight, albeit in the justest of quarrels, a
punishment which he judged too great for any crime; yet home he comes, and
imparts the whole matter to his wife, who entreats him not to accept it,
telling him how unfit he was for that charge, having fewed out his courage to
his tenants, and that his complexion was so sweet, that he would not abide to
stand where blood was shed. Notwithstanding whereof, he entreated her to let
him see a calf killed, which she denied him, swearing that it would make such a
noise, that few were so stout as not to tremble at it; but that to experiment
his courage, she was willing to let him see a chicken murdered; yet, to
satisfy his desire, he behoved to see a calf killed: so the poor beast (I mean
the calf) was brought to the utter court, where the Gentleman stood beholding
it, and there seeing the knife in its throat, and hearing the poor beast bellow
so sadly, the compassionate Gentleman, seemed to die for comradship with it.

By this time the Athenian Army in Lacedemon, under the conduct of Autophilus,
was advanced as far as the heart of the Country, but their discipline was as
bad as their courage was great: for, some by drinking, others by plundering,
lost both the affection of the Lacedaemonians, and their own senses, which
seemed to leave them, because they were so disorderly masters, who, to satisfy
their pleasures, drowned them at all occasions, and thinking Anaxagius
sufficiently obliged by them, if they drank his health; And surely he had been
so, if they had thirsted as much for Blood as for Wine, and employed their
hands as well as their cups, bestowing that health in his quarrel, which they
debauched in the tavern, and which ominated to the Lacedaemonians their
extirpation, and deterred them from joining with them; they intended not to
fight that season, expecting that Anaxagius wel-wishers would adjoyn themselves
as limbe^ to their body: they marched slowly, and at a great distance one
B^igade from another, pr^tending that they would not over-charge the Country by
their vast numbers: but as this was their mistake, so it proved their bane; for
Autarchus hearing of this sol^cism in discipline, falls upon them unexpectedly,
and routs them before they heard that he was upon his march: sending the one
half running back to tell the other half that they were beat; So that report
routed more than he, albeit he routed all those who came in his way, and they
were scattered like sheep pursu^d by a lion, and abandoned by their shepherd,
thinking their capitulation good enough if their life was pardoned; yet those
who were together, fought so generously, as that they evidenced sufficiently,
that it was rather want of officers than of courage which made their companions
fl^e: Those who fought, were commanded by o^e Milet^^, a Gentleman of a well
tempered courage, whose prodigal hands did deal death liberally, and wounds
freely, till his veins denied him b^oud, and his arms strength, both
challenging him for having already banque^rupted too much of his stock, and
thus overpowered by ^ultitudes, and fainting through exces^, he becomes their
prisoner; who judged themselves happy when become masters of that sword, which
had mastered them so often formerly, and were overjoyed to see it in their own
hands, which they feared so much whilst it was in his.

We may perceive by this defeat, how nimious confidence is always waited upon
by tragic disasters, and how the gods disappoint those who appoint for
themselves boundless honors, which they assure themselves so of, as that they
think that fate cannot rob them of them; and it is just that prudence mind
them who will not mind it, and thinks it derogatory to their valor to fight
under its colors, scorning deliberation as superfluous, where the conquest is
certain, and thinking it cowardice to doubt, where courage concludes the
project infallible: this is that vice which makes youth madness, and one
Statesman worth twenty Soldiers, and causes the look of a wise man conquer
more than the sword of a fool; and he who wears not his sword in the sheath of
prudence, but keeps it always naked, will doubtless one day cut himself by it;
and will, when conquered, be hung up as a trophee of deliberations true worth,
in fames immortal temple. Prudence is courage's eye, without which it is
blind, and so may be easily overcome by what is weaker, and will stumble where
there is no difficulty; this was partly the cause of their total ruin, for
they wen^ rather to triumph than to fight; but because they did not fight, they
lost the triumph.

Autarchus who had long been hovering, whether to aspire to the chief (if not
the sole command) of the Nations, did now resolve to set up for it: for, he
found that all the old factions had weakened one another, and would still
continue so, and that by picking quarrels against the members of the
Lacedemonian Senate he had expunged those who were most loy^^ (...) Anaxagius,
installing some of his favorites in their vice, only he found the Army planted
with many who favored excessively the Senate, as being members in both, and so
tied too narrowly his actings, and informed too opportunely anent what passed
there; to remedy which, he entreats the Senate to advert how dangerous it was
for the Nation, to suffer any person to command in both, whereby he might one
day command both, and how superfluous it was, seeing one enhanced the salaries
and employments which might entertain many, especially now when they stood in
need of many servants, and stood in fear of some few masters; as also, that
their charge in both was neglected by their retaining both: In order to which
the Senate declares, That no person shall be member of both Senate and Army;
which made many choose rather to abandon their offices in the Army, than in the
Senate, hoping that the Army should be soon disbanded, and finding that its
members were already hated by the people, and might probably be punished by the
Prince; and that from the Senate they might expect a civil employment more
lucrative, and of less danger; and that the Army were but servants to the
Senate, whose members they might cashier at pleasure, and who could never know
the mysteries of what was commanded; (...) Autarchus became sole Arbitrator of
the whole Army.

There was one thing yet wanting to settle him, which was an association with
the Athenians; wherefore he goes in person thither, as if he went to root up
the remainders of the Autophilist faction; but his intent truly was, to ensure
the Phanosebeans to his interest, whom he knew would close with him upon his
own terms, to have the Autophilists destroyed, whereas he feared that after
Autophilus were once destroyed, and his faction extinguished, they would not so
willingly associate with him, and here the event answered his expectation; for,
at his coming to Athens, and his meeting with Phanosebus, they after some
previous treaty, agreed in these Articles; That Autophilus who was then
prisoner in Lacedemon, should be beheaded; and that Phanosebus, in requital of
this, should destroy all who opposed the Lacedemonian Senate in Athens; and
that none should be admitted to any public office in Athens who had served in
that war, except such as the Senate of Lacedemon should approve: this they did,
fearing lest else each Nobleman should bring in his friends, which those
Athenians who were there could scarce hinder. This Treaty ended, Autarchus
stays with them till all uproars were settled, all suspect persons secured, and
all the Judicatories filled with those of Phanosebus faction, and in testimony
of their respects to him, they court him, feast him, and present him with some
rich Jewels.

After Autarchus return to Lacedemon, he endeavors to weaken the Country
musters, pretending that they were too obsequious to the Nobility, and those
too much devoted to Anaxagius; and albeit the continual custom of Lacedemon
might plead for their continuance, they being only at first instituted, and
since continued to supply the want of Armies, could not be now either
necessary, or convenient, where the Senate were served by a dutiful and potent
Army: By which means, he obtains from the Senate, that these should be
discharged; Yet whilst this was a doing, he causes prorogate the treaties
betwixt the King and Senate, purposly that he might afford Anaxagius
well-wishers some hope, and so keep them quiet, till his own faction were well
feathered, that they might flee abroad upon their own wings.

Yet the carreer of his ambition stops not here, but he prevails with the
Senate, threatening some, and alluring others, to execute Autophilus; and
thereafter his fury flies at so high a pitch as to stage Anaxagius, and after
some formalities of process, O horror, or something more horrible than horror!
they condemn him as a traitor, and even those who were traitors to him; and as
in all furious and desperate exploits, this is no sooner intended than executed.

That fatal day being come wherein wickedness was to show to the world its
masterpiece, the Army is made to approach near the City, and those whose humor
was known to be barbarous, and whose crimes were by themselves judged
unpardonable, were chosen to be upon the guard, where about ten a clock
Anaxagius comes forth upon a scaffold, which was all covered and hung with
black, wearing Majesty in his looks, albeit they had divested him of its robes;
his very face might have vindicated him from more probable crimes than those
they could charge him with, and it seemed that he came rather to take up, than
to lay down a Crown: After he had settled himself a little and beckened for
silence, he gave the bystanders this farewell.

AMongst the many miseries wherewith miserable man's life is chequered, it is
none of the least, that man should be man's torturer: but amongst those
afflictions which spring to men from one another malice, those are most
insupportable, which are caused by near relations, seeing it is a double
affliction both to themselves afflicted, and to be afflicted by friends, from
whom else they might expect some assistance; and what stranger will not condemn
him as horridly guilty, to whom his relations are willing to be bourriers? It
is not the fear of death (for my life has not been so sweet of a long time,
that my death needs to prove bitter) No, it is the fear of what disorders will
ensue upon my death which thus appales me; Neither would I grieve, if I judged
that the one might prevent the other: but why should I not grieve, when I see
that the one will occasion the other? And seeing I fear that these Leeches will
find the blo^^ of a King so fat and sweet, that it Will (...) them to suck out
greedily that of the (...) for, since neither the privilege of my person, nor
the justness of my cause, was able to restrain the hand of injustice from
stretching it self out against me, what subject (in none of whom either of
these is to be found in a more eminent way) can expect exemption? or, if he be
exeemed, he owes that more to his fortune, than his innocence; And what a
misery is it to live, where both life and fortune depends upon a may be? and to
live where virtue can neither expect preferment, nor evite punishment, the one
being now the price of perjury, and the other the effect of hazard: As for my
crime, it is such, as the worst of Kings cannot be guilty of, seeing it can only
be admitted against Kings: And so, seeing not any one person can be both accuser
and defender, no King can be accounted a Traitor. It is true, some Lawyers do
allege, that a King, selling his Kingdom to a stranger, or betraying it to an
enemy, commits Treason; but the reason in both these, is, because after he has
sold his Crown, or willing by treachery to convey it to another, he cease of
his own consent to be King, and so being a private person, may be guilty of
that public crime; but to sit upon the bench of justice, and there ma^ked with
the ^^^^ard of Law, is condemn a King, is a pr^^tice never hitherto attempted
by the worst of men, and so must be judged most horrid; for, if it had not been
so, sure some one of those many Traitors (who have been both many and malicious
in all ages) would have excogitated this expeciency, to varnish the ^glin^sse
of their crime: for there is no evil which is judged practical by hellish
persons, but histories swarm with instances of it, only this the worst of men
have deferred to perpetrate, as being the worst of actions, till Justice should
in the end become so old and weak, as that it was not able to defend it self
against even the highest of injuries: And as to those who were my Judges, they
had either no power; else if they had any, they derived it from me: for, if
they condemned me as members of the Lacedemonian Senate, then they derived
their authority from me, who only did establish it, and it was in obedience to
my command, that the respective Counties elected them to be their
Representatives: and consequently, when I was staged by them, they annulled
their own authority, even then when they exerced it against me: but if they
pannelled me not, as commissionated by that Senate, how could they be said to
represent the Lacedemonian State, more than any other did; and so they judged
me, without being constituted Judges themselves: But no wonder to see those who
neglect the main, slight likewise particulars. As for me, I pardon these wrongs
they have done me, judging it the prerogative of a King to pardon, whereas it
is the part of a subject only to revenge; which since it argues parity, suits
ill with royal Majesty. Neither value I any injury they can do me; for, seeing
they make me exchange earth for heaven, misery for infinite felicity, I account
their wrongs, favors, but I grieve for those grievous wrongs which I fear will
be exercised to you wards; for, seeing happiness consists in being virtuous,
and since patience is one of the cardinal virtues, I can in being patient
without their permission make my self happy in spite of their malice; for
surely, since the gods will remunerate men according to the pains taken in
their service (a piece of justice which the most unjust among men could hardly
decline) Certainly, there is no virtue can expect a greater reward than
patience, seeing there is no virtue which toils so much for it: Neither is there
any virtue which is not acted in acting patience; for, in not grieving too
much, we act temperance; in resisting the assaults of rage, we evidence true
fortitude; and in submitting to the heavenly powers, we manifest our justice:
but my soul is troubled, at the trouble which I fear is a preparing against
you; and as the preservation of your privileges was my main care whilst I
lived (esteeming the repose of the subject the only patrimony of the Prince) so
now, nothing vexes me more at my death, than to foresee how these miscreants
will glut their malice with your blood, and their avarice with your estates;
for, how can these love other men's children, who have murdered their own
father? and how can they fear murder, who are guilty of parritide? Yet be not
totally discouraged; for certain^y, those who cannot suffer a superior in the
beginning, will not in the end suffer a competitor; and this Scepter which they
have screwed out of my hand, will prove a bone, for which these mastiffs will
one day fight amongst themselves; and after that this Land has raged in this
fever of rebellion for some space, it will at last recall its banished
judgment, and judge it expedient to call home its banished Prince: and I am
confident, that this disaster shall prove to my family but like a potion of
physic, which may procure some sickness at first, but will perpetuate its
health for the future; for when ye ponder how ye owe the conquest of your sweet
Country to the courage of my Antcestors, who without them durst never have
attempted it; and how ye owe your pure Religion to their zeal, without whom
none of you would have dared its Reformation; as likewise, how hundreds, yea,
thousands of years, joined to the experience of your antcestors, may be adduced
as witnesses to depone in its favors, when ye advert how your Taxes and Gabels
will augment, and your Justice diminish daily; when you see your streets dyed
with blood, and your faces with paleness, oppression your Legislatour, and
pride and violence the executors of these Laws, then your consciences will
upbrade you with your defection, and torture you for your injustice.

After this discourse was ended, the Executioner (acknowledging the wickedness
of his employment by the masking of his face) did end his unparalled life.

Pity it was, to behold how pity by its iron mace of sorrow broke the hearts of
the beholders; for not a face there was scarleted by one drop of blood, as if
all their blood had been transubstantiate in water, to suppeditate tears to
their prodigal eyes, which stood like clouds, first darkened with sorrow, and
thereafter distilling in showers of tears, which did trickle down, as if they
would bury themselves also in that ground wherein his princely body was to be
intombed; neither was those eyes judged fit to behold heaven, who had not first
washen themselves with tears shed for him* or if any weeped not, it was,
because they resembled those vessels which are so full, that they can drop
none; or else, because their souls sick of an appoplexy of grief, had
forfaulted all its senses and faculties; but amongst many others, there was
one, whom grief had enraged, and whom rage had so grieved, that retiring to his
chamber, he quivered out these dolfull notes.

O distracted heart! why borrowest thou not wings from despair to flee after
thy peerlesse Prince? if thou stay in the dark dungeon of my cloudy breast,
thou shall be fed with sorrow and drowned with tears. O supernal powers! (if I
may call you powers who suffer your selves to be overpowered by injustice) must
we term you both good, and gods, seeing ye permit such innocent souls to be
ballated upon earth by violence and oppression? is it not enough, that ye
should send us a barren and heavy age of iron, but that ye must likewise edge
it with steel, that it may the better cut to pieces our grieved souls? Was not
the treasure of man's misery great enough before, but that ye behoved to augment
it with their new coined afflictions? O earth! why swallow ye not such
miscreants? is it, because ye fear to contaminate your pure bowels with such
contagious carcasses? if so, vomit up your flames of fire, to cleanse your
surface of that pest. O heavens, ye are most wronged! wherefore the punishment
belongs to you; scorn ye to be bourriers to such vile persons: if so,
commissionate frogs and serpents to devour them. O Pluto, why recallest thou
not thy brethren? and hell, why suffer ye your vicegerents always to roam
abroad? is it because ye fear that they would extinguish your flames with their
fruitless tears? or is it, because ye fear that they would deserve your scepter
better than your self, as being more expert in the art of wickedness than ye
are? or, intend ye that they live upon earth to the end they may imbitter the
lives of those who are in it?

With that he rises all in fury and cries, Up Lacedemon, arm thy self with rage,
And all those miscreants banish from the stage;
Lest neighboring Nations, A Rose is the Arms of Lacedemon.
with the finger of scorn,
Point out that Rose that changed is in a Thorn.


After this he would have killed himself, but prudence whispered him iu the
ear, that it was fitter to live and see the fatal period of those Regicides; to
which resolution he acquiesced, washing his hands in innocence with his
streams of tears.

The heavens likewise gloomed at what past, and Phoebus looking sullen and
posting by, seemed to bestow no more light upon Lacedemon than he glanced to
them over his shoulder, disdaining to look straight to those, who were not
straight themselves, and the clouds keeping up their rain, darkened the face of
heaven, either unwilling to fatten the earth, which was by its fruits to fatten
those Traitors; or fearing to let its drops fall in a Country where Kings were
murdered; the air likewise (each attome whereof seemed swelled with rage)
because so gross, as that the grossest lungs could not breath it, nor the
sharpest eye pierce it. Thus Nature seemed to clothe all her household in
mourning for the loss of her dearest darling, and she became enraged at these
villains, for breaking that Tableau which she had distinated as a remembrance
of her exquisit skill to all ages.

Theopemptus, eldest son to Anaxagius, succeeded to him, a Gentleman of a noble
spirit, and well limbed eloquence, who knew well by the bridle of cunning, to
govern the fierce monster of popular fury, and whose genius (quadrant-like) was
able to measure the height of the highest employment to which it was applied,
and who by the art of patience, could make the rarest flowers of virtue and
generosity, grow in the cold and barren soil of affliction, which did
continually yield so abundantly the seeds of precepts and example, as that
thereby in short time he stored therewith the gardens both of Court and
Country, which was formerly judged impossible, because of the largeness of the
one, and weediness of the other: yet providence judged fit to enamel this
golden spirit with the black color of adversity, giving him an opportunity
thereby to evidence, that chance did not share with him in his virtue, but that
he could be virtuous, not only without the assistance, but even in spite of
the resistance of that blind (though ordinary) helper: or, if chance played
ever in his game, it was because it knew none could be a loser who was
associated to such a gamester: and so, that to which all there is were debtors,
was a debtor to him, who thought it more princely to give, than to receive. The
Synod had pained themselves often, to draw him to be their Leader, thinking it
easy to persuade a young Prince to be an absolute King, and foreseeing that
he would be very helpful to them, seeing the sons presence would impatron their
defection from the father; and seeing the father behoved either to condescend to
their overtures, fearing lest the people might uphold the Crown upon his tender
head, which was not yet strong enough to bear it; else, if that framed not
according to their wishes, they might keep the son, as an hostage for the
fathers obedience, intending to cut him off how soon the father cut off their
hopes: these were the endeavors of wicked Autarchus, who as he was wicked in
this, so was blind in not perceiving that providence perceived his bloody
designs.

The Mercurialists, who had a long time pedled under the Jovists, did now begin
to trade for themselves, these were persons whose zeal was so hot, as that it
burnt their charity, and whose charity was so cold as that it did frieze their
natural affection, interesting themselves in all businesses, and busying
themselves with all interests; who sighed not so much out of piety (albeit that
was pretended) as because they saw their faction crossed, or themselves not
advanced; and whose tears gushed out, fearing that if they stayed within, they
should be contaminated by their pestiferous breasts, which the dullest of men
might by the breath of their words know to be infected: these had in their
hearts abjured their Prince, and perjured themselves (perjuring themselves in
so far as they had abjured their Prince) and by tolerating all sects, and
slagitious persons, had almost possessed all the Offices of the Army; and who
were persuaded to desert the Jovist faction, when they resolved to desert their
Prince, knowing that these two justled one against the other, whereupon they
proclaim immunity to all crimes, providing the criminals be willing to
associate with them in the crime of treason, when any thing was to be agitated
in the Senate, they sent abroad those members who were of the Jovist faction,
employing them either in levying men or moneys in the Country, or in
transactions of small importance up and down the City, and under pretext of
guarding the Senate; they placed always guards of their own cabel (for all the
Soldiers followed their principles, as those which licensed them most to
satisfy their own irrational appetites) and by that means hindered all the
Senators, who were not of their judgment, from entering to give their judgments
in subjects debatable; and this cheat they used when Anaxagius was declared by
the Senate guilty of treason, as we related formerly; yea, at that time they
caused some of the Guards call them out of the House, pretending some
particulars with them, whom when they came they pulled away, not suffering them
to enter till the debate was ended, and hurrying away others to prison,
alleging an order from the Senate for what they did, which none durst
challenge, seeing they dared once to allege it: But after Anaxagius death, all
the Jovist faction removed themselves, abhorring by their presence to authorize
such illegal actings: as also Cyrus General of the Army, resigned his batton,
finding that Autarchus endeavored both to defame and ruin him in the Army.

Meetings amongst subjects have always been esteemed unmeet by the Prince, as
being the nests wherein the Cockatrices of Rebellion are often hatched; and seeing
in them treasonable projects are often, at least may be easily ventilated, the
Prince has reason to advert to them, and may justly prohibit them: for, since
they resemble Incorporations, they should as well as those be authorized by his
permission, but especially such Conventicles as dare not admit light to be a
member; wherefore Law justly presumes that to be done illegally which is done
secretly: for, if the actors might avow publicly their meetings, it is not
probable that they would be at the pains to hunt for privacies, especially,
seeing ambition prompts the least vain amongst men, to act what they think
allowable before witnesses: In these Conventicles all the cheats of that
faction were hatched; for, whilst they persuaded men that they were sacrificing
at these times to the immortal gods, they were really but borrowing the seal of
devotion, that they might affix it to the forged writs of their own capricious
and rebellious fancies, and were afterward inhibited by Autarchus, when sole
Governor; who knowing best by what means he had cheated the people himself,
knew best how to close those back-passages upon others; and who by condemning
it in others, acknowledge it damnable in himself.

The Athenians perceived now their error, in believing the Lacedemonian
Senate; and Phanosebus did now conclude, that since Autophilus and Oranthus
were removed, he would monopolize his Princes affection; wherefore he moves the
Senate of Athens to send to Corinth, where their Prince lived in exile, to
bring him home, which is done instantly, and Theopemptus is brought home
privately, lest the Lacedemonian Fleet should have ensnared him at Sea: but all
who had served Oranthus, or stuck by Autophilus, were banished from Court, and
Theopemptus is necessitated to submit to all the determinations of the
Phanosebean faction, who vex him daily with new suits, and fill his Court with
new favorites, whose clownishnesse dissatisfied his noble and courtly spirit;
and whose ignorance tortured his accute wit and vast experience: all affairs
were chewed by the rotten teeth of these dolts, who determined all things in
their private conclaves before they came to the Council Table, studying rather
how to cross, than how to serve their Prince; yet shunned that wise Prince,
either to offend them, or to seem to be offended at them; for albeit he was so
judicious, as to discern their follies, yet was he so prudent as to dissemble
his resentments, knowing that cheats are like flowers and herbs, which are best
discerned when they flourish most, and most hated when best discerned.

The Lacedemonian Senate, hearing that the Athenians had refuged Theopemptus,
resolved to send an Army against them, under the conduct of Autarchus, who
assured the Senate that he was confident of many friends there, and their
factiousness would prove his intimate well wisher; as also, that it was surest
game to fight Theopemptus in Athens, lest if he marched into Lacedemon, his
Army might prove like a ball of snow, which the further it rouls, grows always
the greater; and that possibly the command of a King, joined to his diligence,
might piece up those differences, which did like wedges, for the present,
cleave assunder that rent Nation. Besides these, Autarchus design was, to
engage further the Lacedemonian Senate in that rebellious quarrel, and to
imbrew so their hands in the Bloud-Royal, as that no capitulation might be able
to wash it off; and by this new employment, to acquire new respect to himself
from the Army, and to render the Army necessary in the Commonwealth, fearing
lest they should come to want respect, if they come once to want employment. He
marches to Athens with a well equipaged and long-experienced Army; having
exact intelligence from his Army of all that passed there. The Phanosebeans who
only commanded both Church and State, made head against him, but their Army was
so misgovern'd by a Committee from whom they received all their Orders, that
Autarchus needed none to conquer them besides their own unskilfulness and
confusion. Sometimes in matters of greatest expedition, they could not be
convocated, and when they were assembled, their opinions fought each one
against another, whilst all should have employed themselves in fighting against
the common enemy: thus they continued to distract that poor Nation by their
distracted fancies, till at last Autarchus falls upon their Camp privately, and
cuts them* all to pieces.

That old Army being beat, a new Army is ordered to be levied; and now Cletus
who succeeded to his brother Autophilus, gains to his party, some of those who
owned Phan^sebus interest formerly, and by their assistance obtains (after many
and long debates at the Council Table) that all those who had followed
Autophilus and Oranthus faction, should be readmitted to their old charge, and
admitted in others then vacant, alleging, that else the Counties who were much
inclined their way, would never engage cordially in his Majesty's quarrel; for,
who would be so mad as to fight in that Army, where they feared their own
Commanders more than their enemies; or, who would strengthen that Army by new
Levies, who would be employed to assist their inveterate enemies at home, after
they were once victorious abroad? Adding, that who could hinder any man to
quench that fire which was burning his own house? or, who could hinder a son to
defend his mother?

The Phanosebeans finding themselves beat from all these bulwa^ks, did at last
retire (as their custom was) to the Citadel of Religion, alleging that their
consciences could not allow them to associat themselves to those, whose sins
would prove like so many bosom enemies; and that to contract friendship with
such, was to declare war against the immortal gods: yet Theopemptus had so
cunningly insinuated himself with the Jovist Priests, that the greatest and
wisest part of them, did not only tolerate, but likewise approve that
association, by which the Phanosebeans became enraged, and devoted themselves
to the Lacedemonian faction, albeit many thought that Phanosebus self continued
loyal.

Cletus (a singularly well accomplished Gentleman) became by this means
Theopemptus darling, and promotes exceedingly their new Levies, so that in a
short space an excellent Army is drawn to the fields; yet they were so wearied
by delays, and starved with hunger by the Phanosebean Officers, that many
dropped away, being near home, and many were affamished; occasions of fighting
were neglected, and the loyallest persons sent upon desperate exploits: which
Theopemptus perceiving, and fearing that the continuance of this evil should
prove an irremediable evil in the end, resolved to march to Lacedemon, having
assurance from some, and well-grounded hopes from others in that Nation, that
they would assist him: but at his entry, the Athenians, who wanted pay, and
feared both the tediousness of the journey, and treachery of their Officers, did
like Northern Ice, drop away before the Southern Sun, and were at last
overtaken by Autarchus (to whom those fresh forces whom he left behind did join
incontinently) and so did dissipate that poor handful, whom the tediousness of
the journey had left alive; yet in spite of all enquiry, providence so mudded
the eyes of those who enquired after him, that he escaped their hands, and
blows a gentle gale out of its mouth, which conveys him over to Corinth.

Autarchus hoises up now the sails of his ambition, which were instantly ^illed
with the smiling gales of success, and placing confidence at the helm, steers
straight for the haven of Supremacy. He marries his daughters to the most
eminent Officers of the Army, and diggs deeply in the secrets of the wives,
that he might learn the secrets of the husbands: he bribes the Astrologues to
foretell his conquests, making his wishes the heavenly houses by which they
foretold his success, and instigates a great many Enthusiastic persons to
prophecy his happiness, authorizing themselves by revelations, by which means
he animates his own, and terrifies his adversaries, wringing new pay and
privileges to the Army from the Senate, by which he both fortifies the Army,
and brings a mass of odium upon the Senate.

The door whereby he was to enter Supremacies parlour, was now bolted by no
other bar, than by his jealousy of Anarchus interest in the Army; who in all
this war being his colleague, he feared he might become his competitor;
wherefore he persuaded him, to suit for the Government of the Isle of Patmos,
and persuaded him, that if he would lay down his charge in the Lacedemonian
Army, that he would procure it for him from the Lacedemonian Senate; for in the
present scarsity of Offices, none could enjoy two at once, especially of two so
eminent as those were: Anarchus embraces the proffer, choosing rather to be
first in the Army of Patmos, then second in the Army of Lacedemon, and demits
his charge, which he no sooner demits, than the Senate by Autarchus
instigation, presently accepts, and thereafter slights him; whereupon he is
constrained to retire home, biting his lip because he had condescended to that
unfortunate transaction.

The stage being thus cleared of all encumbrances, Autarchus begins to act his
chief scene, and endeavors to irritate the Army against the Senate; which he
might the more easily effectuate, by reason that the Senate did now begin to
discover his roguery, and the Armies tyranny, and were endeavoring to reduce
some of their Regiments, and affront some of their Officers; which Autarchus
adverting to, ordered all the nearest lying Regiments to march up unexpectedly
to the City; and coming one morning to the Court of the Palace where the Senate
did then sit, he closes the gate, lest any of the number should escape; and
turning him to the Soldiery, opening his mind thus to them.

Fellow Soldiers, your bleeding wounds and wounded bodies, deserve better
requital from this Senate than frowns or threats; and albeit ye be not actually
in service against their enemies, yet that is no more a reason why ye should
not be paid and cherished as formerly, than a Mariner who has served his
Master in a storm at Sea, should be shaken off and refused maintenance when he
comes a shore: Ye have abandoned your houses, and renounced your trades, that
ye might make their Army your house, and their service your trade: And must
these, in whose hands ye have put the sword, take your swords from you, and
ruin you after that ye have ruined their enemies? What may this Nation expect
from these Masters, who refuse maintenance to the best and loyallest of their
servants? and seeing they disoblige us so much, who have so much obliged them,
what shall the rest of the Nation expect, who have never obliged them at all?
And may we not see that their quarrel against us, is our just pay, which
otherwise they might coffer up themselves? What shall the world say of us, if
that after we have banished Monarchy, we establish Tyranny? and to counterpoise
the antiquity of the former Government, should not we endeavor to evidence as
much wisdom and moderation in this, which we are to establish, as the former
could allege antiquity or prescription? Remember that courage and prudence
have so strict an alliance, that valor without prudence, is no valor, but
rather temerity: wherefore if ye show not prudence after these many victories,
wherewith fame has crowned you as with so many laurels, your former victories
will be attributed either to blind chance, or to your enemies imprudence; and
how can ye be termed prudent, if ye suffer your selves to be trampled upon by
the feet of Tyranny? Wherefore make the world witnesses of your gallantry, in
refusing to serve those, who could neither prize nor reward your services, and
settle in your own persons that Government which ye have suffered so much for.

All condescended to this overture, and Autarchus dismisses that ignorant
rabble, who had formerly by his assistance thrown out those worthy patriots,
who had been their former colleagues, and by this means, he who had been in
appearence so much an enemy to Arbitrary Government in the person of
Theopemptus, became an affecter of it in his own; and was declared by the Army
Governor of Lacedemon and Athens in this interim; promising to render up his
power to the first Senate which should be legally conveened, by the Authority
of the People; Proclamations are immediately issued out, to remonstrate to the
People the reasons of raising the Senate, and of establishing the Government
for the interim in the person of Autarchus: but both these actions were so
black that they could receive no other tincture, and the faces of their cheats
so large that no vizard could be found big enough to cover them.

Autarchus endeavors to retain by cheats, that power which he had gotten by
force; and because he perceived that the Church had been an occasion of many
great alterations in the State formerly, by reason that the Ecclesiastics
debated every thing, and retarded most of what was resolved by the State; he
therefore resolves to moddel such an Ecclesiastic Government, as might wholly
be subordinate to the Civil; for which cause amongst those many Religions which
were at that time professed in Lacedemon, he chooses one, which allow no
public Conventions amongst Ecclesiastics; which being once settled, he sets
himself to crush the faction of Theopemptus, which he does by inhibiting all
public Conventions, wherein mutinies might be hatched, such as horse-matches,
feastivals, etc. he carresses some of all factions, showing thereby that all
might, if they pleased bring favor; and supports the weakest faction, that so
it might by his assistance counterpoise the other, knowing that by these, all
joint Insurrections would be retarded, and that the one in odium of the other,
would unseale one another mysteries, and countermine one another projects: He
disarmed the people, whereby he both disabled them to act any thing to his
prejudice for the present, and weaned their spirits from all martial
employments for the future; and likewise filling his own Arsenal richly, he
made himself seem terrible to all that wished his ruin. Being thus secured
against foreign Incursions, he endeavors to secure himself against intestine
broils; lest else he might prove like to one of those thieves, who leaves their
own door open whilst they go abroad to steal from their neighbors; to obviate
which, he imploys the most eminent amongst the Officers, as Counsellor^ of
State; both, lest they should repine at his being the sole Arbitrator in all
affairs, and tha^ they might bear an equal share in the odium o^ what was done
by him to displease the people; yet lest they should twist themselves too far
in the Government, he appointed always some festival days of worship for the
gods, wherewith to busy them, whilst he himself is busied in dispatching
matters of the greatest moment; and lest those who were Governors of Cities,
and Countries, should insinuate themselves too far in the affection either of
Soldiers or Countrymen, he transplanted them often from one place to another; and
to prevent the idleness of the Soldiers, (which might have given them both
leisure and opportunity to fall by the ears amongst themselves) as also to have
some pretext to levy moneys from the people (which poor people he fleeced like
a sheep at his pleasure) he warred continually against some neighboring
Prince, buying to himself repute with the blood of the Soldiers, and money of
the people.

Amongst his many other State-sophismes, this was one most remarkable, because
often reiterated. When Autarchus had notice given him by his Spies, of any
Royallist who had more avarice than money, and who could be no longer honest,
than he was rich; he presently sent for them, and after he had convinced them,
that he was master of their life and fortunes; and of their ^olly in adhering
so pertinaciously to Theopemptus faction, he proffered them considerable sums
to own his interest; and to seem to draw a faction for Theopemptus, pretending
Commissions for that effect, and getting a great many hands to subscrive some
Remonstrance, and especially the hands of those whom he suspected to be loyal,
or knew to be rich: which being gotten, that he should acquaint him with the
Rendevouze appointed, or suffer himself and the Papers to be apprehended by
some of the Soldiery: by which means he rid himself of the most eminent, and
enriched his treasury by the alleged treason of his most considerable enemies,
and made his own wit to be admired, and brought his adversaries to that pass,
that they could not trust one another.

Another stratagem which he used to ensnare that generous Prince, was this: He
had notice given him of one called Asebus, whose poverty behoved to have some
bone to gnaw upon, albeit he should have drawn it out of the devil^ side; him
Autarchus sent for, hearing that he was an Agent for the Royal faction, and
after many allurements (it being easy to persuade where avarice opens the ear,
and necessity play^ the Orator) he prevails with him to go to Theopemptus, and
carry along with him six thousand crowns, and assure him of the like sum
yearly, in pension from some friends in Lacedemon (whose purses loyal
compassion had opened) Theopemptus desires to know their names; but Asebus
pretended that he was sworn not to tell that, wherewith he rests satisfied; but
persuades himself that the senders were his friends, and that Asebus was a
confident of theirs, else they had never trusted him, and a friend of his, else
he had never undertaken the employment; and thus he acquaints him with all his
designs, which the other no sooner know than he reveals them to Autarchus. Yet
the gods (who are not idle spectators, but just judges of men's knavery)
deciphers him at last; for having one day seen some dispatches which were sent
to Lacedemon by Theopemptus, he acquaints Autarchus, who apprehends and
executes the Gentlemen who were entrusted: whereat Theopemptus extremely
enraged, accuses a Nobleman, who had only seen those Letters besides Asebus,
the Nobleman vindicates himself, but not being believed by his Prince, he runs
in fury to Asebus his Cabinet, and there finding some Letters of correspondence
from Autarchus to him, he causes him to be presently apprehended.

Amidst these triumphs, triumphing death cuts his treacherous days, and
hurries him to eternal torment, who tormented others here; And thus died the
most hateful Tyrant who ever lived, leaving behind him a son, in whose
simplicity the gods punished the fathers cheating prudence; this was that
Ephemerus of whom I spoke formerly, who being nominated by his father his
successor, was admitted by the Soldiery, not so much out of any respect they
bore him, as fearing that if the charge were declared vacant, emulation should
cut the throat of their quiet. It was thought that Ephemerus (finding his own
insufficiency) resolved to recall Theopemptus, but his design was choked by
timorousness, fearing least the Army perceiving his design, should ruin him,
and disappoint his project: Others thought, that his enemies used only this, as
an argument to persuade the Army to relinquish him, as they did afterward.
However, he was induced by some who favored the Royal faction, especially by
Monus General of the Athenian Forces, to convocate a Senate, whereby they
expected to establish Monarchy. Anarchus all this while, like a boiling liquor
could not contain himself in a private condition, without running over, and
like the children, chose rather to be burnt in the sunshine of a public
employment, tha^ stay in the shade of privacy; wherefore he deals with some
Officers to recall him, and entering in a confederacy among themselves, they
deal with Morus General of the Lacedemonian Forces, to concur with them in
persuading Ephemerus to set the Senate a packing; which Morus (poor fool)
assents to, and whereof Ephemerus is simply persuaded, the one induced by the
glory of governing the Army, who was to govern all; and the other terrified by
fear, concluding that the Army would assume by force, what was denied in
favor. Thus we see glory makes men too credulous, because it ponders danger
too little; and fear makes men too credulous, because it ponders danger too
much; the one not seeing what is, and the other seeing more than is: which are
the two ordinary diseases both in the eyes of body and mind. And as in things
corporeal, so also in spiritual productions, we see monsters both in defect and
excess engendered; prudence missing its mark in the one, as nature misseth hers
in the other: for, as hot-spurr'd ambition will not suffer prudence to stand to
hear its errand; so leaden-footed fear suffers the occasion to slip before it
brings prudence up to the place where it should act; and as one who runs can
never see any object which he posts by exactly; so one may dull his sight after
such a fashion in looking too long upon one object, that he may come to see
nothing, because he has looked too much: And premeditation is like the fire,
whose flames show equally little light at first when it is kindled, and at last
when it has burnt too long. But Ephemerus was hugely misted by his own folly
in this (fear being always like a mist, which makes the object appear greater
than it is) for, seeing there are only two ways, either to acquire or retain
Supremacy, the one by a pretended authority, such as the Senate was; and the
other by irresistible force, such as the Army was: and since he was confident
that Anarchus had debauched the Army from his obedience, he should never have
abandoned the Senate. Neither did Morus evidence less folly in colluding with
Anarchus, for he might have seen (if the eyes of his reason had been open) that
since Anarchus was able to dissolve the Senate by the assistance of the Army,
that he might in time by their assistance ruin him far more easily, who was
but a single person; and seeing many of those who commanded, had been under
Anarchus his charge, when they were Morus his competitors and equals, he might
have concluded that they would far more willingly obey an old master, than one
but late equal; as also, that the Soldiery who had been victorious under his
conduct (and so were confident of his courage and prudence) would more
cordially follow him than any else; and by Autarchus eying him as his
competitor, Morus might have feared to take him in to be his colleague. No
sooner is the Senate dissolved, than the Army establishes that old Senate which
Autarchus had at first dissolved; for seeing they found that the Nation could
not be satisfied without a Senate, they resolved to establish that wherein many
of themselves were members, and whom because of their paucity they might easily
command. Yet many judged that they recalled these fools, not out of any
affection, but merely because they were not able themselves to settle their own
differences in so short a time; which conjecture was approven by the event:
for, these Officers of the Army, finding that the Senate consulted them not in
all particulars, nor called them to fill up the vacant places which were many
amongst them, did endeavor to reassume that power with which they had
invested those ingrate fellows formerly; who looked upon their restorers, as if
they had only been their servants, which they perceiving, ordered the
casheering of these daring Officers, and especially of Morus and Anarchus; but
being hated by the people, as those Leeches who had sucked the Blood Royal, and
as those burriers who had strangled the tranquillity of the Nation, and being
jealoused by the Army, as the persons who endeavored to wrest the power out of
their hands, they were turned out by Anarchus, and the whole power was retained
by the Army; who resolved to subject themselves to none, and to make all
subjects to them: Hereupon Monus, whom the late Senate eying as a Royallist,
had called to bear charge in Lacedemon, intending really to have laid him fast
by the heels, did refuse always, pretending that he was bound by promise to
the Army of Athens, not to remove thence till they were completely satisfied of
their Arrears; whereby he found a pretext to excuse his stay (seeing he knew
that they could not advance so much money) and endeared himself to the
Soldiery, and did fully engage them to him; and now perceiving, that the
Commonwealth would one day perish by their convulsion fits of schism, to which
it was so subject; and knowing by its change of color, that it did begin to
faint, resolved to lay hold on this occasion, and to purge away these malignant
humors out of the body of the State, whilst they were thus commoved; wherefore
he declares War against the Council, because they had banished the Senate; yet
covertly he hated the Senate as much as them, but resolved by helping the
weakest, and by ruining the Army, to re-establish Theopemptus: for effectuating
whereof he cashiers instantly all such in his Army, as he feared did incline
too much to Anarchus, and morgages all his Plate and Jewels for money to pay
his Army, making the Athenians advance the superplus; for they were persuaded,
that if Anarchus gained, that all their goods should be confiscated, and their
lives, if not endangered, at least imbittered: As also, he advances one degree
all his Officers, obliging them to fight for their own dignities, if they would
not in his quarrel. Many judged Monus a fool in this attempt, like those who
seeing only the first draughts of a pencile, though never so curious, yet
thinks the face deformed, whereas the skilful Painter himself, or any exquisit
Artist, knows that it will prove well: for, he considered wisely, that all the
Senates faction, and which was more, all the Royal faction, would own him, and
that possibly he might gain some of theirs (expecting pardons for their crimes)
but that doubtless they could never debauch any of his; that the Cash being in
the Senates hands, and at their disposal (none being in a capacity to levy
money except a Senate) and the Cash being the breasts by whose milk the Army
was kept alive; he knew they could not long subsist without it; likewise he
found by his well founded intelligence, that despair was arming all men, in all
the corners of the Nation. Yet to encourage his soldiers, he convocats all the
nobility of Athens, and communicats to the wittiest amongst them, his design,
to re-establish Monarchy, and desired them not to startle at any public
protestations to the contrary, which necessity might wring from him; and
desires them to be ready waiting his call, and for that effect he fills up all
the vacant places in his Army with Athenians, and author^zes the rest to wear
Arms as formerly. But the Mercurialists in Athens endeavored to oppose his
designs, alleging that he desired a convocation of the Nobility, only to
ensnare them, and labored to impede the payment of those taxes which he
required, pretending that Anarchus would cause them be paid over again, and
not only so, but would likewise impute the first payment of them to the Nation,
as an unpardonable crime: by this means they thought to have hindered the
payment of the Soldiers, and without that, they knew that Monus could not
subsist; As also they endeavored to set the Nobility and Citizens by the ears,
alleag^ng that the Nobility labored to cry down usury, and to necessitate
their Creditors to accept Lands for their Money, which would ruin Trade. But
such was the zeal of the Nation, for the re-establishment of Theopemptus, and
such was their affection to Monus, that these Fanatics gained nothing by all
their pains but ignominy to themselves, and a curse to their posterity:
Anarchus Army hearing that the Athenians were all in Arms covertly, and fearing
ambushes in a Country where they were both unaquainted, and hated; and knowing
that Anarchus wanted money to pay their Arrears, whereas Monus had paid those
who served him, they refuse to advance to Athens, whereas it was thought, that
if he had advanced immediately, that most of the Soldiery enclining his way,
that they had deserted Monus and followed him. Whilst Anarchus is upon his
march from Athens, the Senate is settled in safety at Lacedemon, by some
Officers, whom the Council had disobliged, and whom the Senate had bribed with
promises of future preferment; which necessitated Anarchus to return; but in
his return, all his Soldiers either dropped away privately, or revolted openly;
which for^ed him to make his capitulation, but robbed him of the means of
capitulating handsomely: Monus follows, and marches straight to Lacedemon, and
in his march, is welcomed by the applauses of the people, and addresses of the
Gentry, and found an unanimous desire in all men to have Theopemptus called
home. At his entry to Lacedemon, he is carressed by the Senate at first, yet
afterward they conjecture that he byasseth Theopemptus way; wherefore to try
him, and to make him odious to the people, they employ him in razing down the
gates of the City; which he obeyes, fearing to be discovered too soon; but
obeyes so wittily, as that he makes the odium rebound upon themselves; malice
being a ball, which, if thrown violently, bolts up presently upon the thrower;
and in stead of making the City his enemies, he gains them to be his friends;
whereat the Senate shows themselves dissatisfied, fearing that such an honest
servant would never satisfy such roguish masters. Monus resolves jointly with
the City, to procure the readmission of those, who being Colleagues with their
present Senators, were excluded because of their adherance to Anaxagius; which
he effectuates happily, and thereby puts a bridle in the head of that unruly
beast the Senate: yet, albeit those who were re-entred were the more numerous,
the old members so perplexed them by debates, and so often discovered their
secrets, that they brake up the present Senate, and called a new one.

In this Senate Theopemptus is called home; not limited by conditions, as some
desired; for how could Subjects give Law to a King? and possibly these
conditions would have been by the next ensuing Senate, declared T^reason, and
the Treaters declared Traitors, but absolutely each endeavoring who should
strengthen his prerogative most.

At his Proclamation the people kindled innumerable bonfires, as if by them
they intended to purge the air of these Nations, which had been polluted with
blasphemy against the gods, and rebellion against the King formerly; or else,
as if they intended to bury in these graves, and burn to ashes those cares,
wherewith they had been formerly afflicted; Their flames mounted so high, that
one might have thought that they intended to carry news of those Solemnities to
heaven; and the smoke covered the T^owns pend-ways, lest heaven should have
discerned the extravagancies whereof the Inhabitants were guilty; for gravity
was banished as an enemy to their duty, and madness was judged true loyalty;
the trumpets were ecchoed by the vociferations of the people, and those
vociferations seemed to obey the summons of the trumpets; the bells likewise
kept a part with the singing multitude, so that both bells and people did both
sing and dance all at once; and the air no sooner received these news, but it
dispersed them to all the corners of the City, and ears of the Citizens; it
being no crime to be in this a ^ale-bearer; and the bullets did flee out of the
Cannons, as if they intended to meet him half way: wine was sent in abundance
to the earth, that it might drink his Majesty's health also, and the glasses
capreoled in the air, for joy to hear his name: some danced through the fire,
knowing that the wine had so much m^dified them, that they needed not fear
burning; and others had bonfires kindled in their faces by the wine which they
had drunk.

And as Theopemptus was remembered, so Monus was not forgot, some admiring his
loyalty, some his prudence, and many both: for, he finding that the Army was
the Ramparts which defended the late Tyranny, did macerate it as much as was
possible: for the old Senate by his connivance, did levy their County Bands,
which served as a counterpoise to the Armies weight; those Officers who showed
themselves dissatisfied, were reduced, and their Regiments disbanded: but lest
the Soldiery should repine and mutiny, they were instantly received into the
County Bands; and those Regiments which were continued, were either given to
loyal persons, or those who were disloyal were gained by a certain expectation
of pardon, and future employment; for which cause it was surmised, that
Theopemptus intended for his own safety, to keep a standing Army, whom he was
to pay; as also, the Senate caused rumor, that they were to apprehend such
persons as they jealoused, whereupon if they were guilty, they presently either
fled, or drew a faction, in both which cases they afforded certain proofs of
their knavery, and furnished the Senate the means to ruin them. And because
their presence overawed always the Senate, it was ordered, that the City
Bands should guard the City, and the Army should remove from it, So that the
venom being once removed from the heart, the cure of the body was thereby much
facilitated; the Companies likewise of every Regiment, were dispersed into all
the corners of the country, under pretext of preventing Insurrections; But
really their design was to impede their mutinies, and to make them the more
conquerable, if they should dare to oppose that royal design, some of them were
sent unto Athens, because the Revolution was to begin in Lacedemon; and others
were sent to assist foreign Allies, at the suggested request of their
Ambassadors.

All things being thus prepared, Theopemptus enters the City of Lacedemon, in
the greatest pomp that loyalty, or luxury could invent: Above him at the Gates
stood clouds, as they seemed, which rained down Wines of all sorts, and at each
side of the Gates stood a large Glass, the one whereof afforded a perspective
of a Country, where all the trees were dismantled of their leaves, and all the
flowers blasted by the wind; wherein widows were bathing their starving babes
in their compassionate tears, and where tax-masters were beating the peasants,
who declared upon their knees, that they could not pay their taxes: In the
other Glass was to be seen, a pleasant Spring in the ruff of its pride, and a
Prince sighting against a Tyrant with one hand, and sowing gold and money with
the other. These and many other expressions of joy were presented to him, whose
recital might be as tedious as the view was pleasant. At the same Gate stood
all the Senators and Citizens in robes, amongst whom one delivered his Majesty
this harangue.

Most gracious Sovereign,

ALbeit your Return has effaced these sad impressions which our miseries had
engraven upon our spirits, yet duty has reserved an idea of them, that by
comparing them with the happy condition wherein we are like to live under your
Government, we may find what a vast difference there is betwixt Monarchy and
Anarchy, betwixt slavery and subjection: We know now what a silly carcass a
body is without a head, and what a madness it is for a body to brain its head
against the rocks of danger and rebellion. Your Majesty is our head, and nature
teaches all men to guard that, even with the hazard of their other members;
and Physicians prescribe more maxims for its conservation, and more medicaments
for its cure, than for the cure of any part beside. Ye may be confident, Sir,
that we who have had our purses robbed so often by Tyrants, will not now refuse
some part of them to our lawful Prince; and who should command the childrens
purses more freely than the father? Our refusing to defray your necessary
charges, may procure to us national affronts, and lose us our foreign
interests: and herein consists our mutual happiness, that as our Nation has a
Prince who will require less than they would willingly contribute, so our
Prince has now a people, who upon all honorable emergents will cordially
contribute more than he will demand. And we who have been flung in heaps, that
Tyrants might over our bellies and upon our shoulders mount their unjustly
acquired thrones, will doubtless willingly lend our hands to help our born
Prince to ascend that Throne, which his birth, and our prescribed consent, has
built for him; and as a company of Merchants who are linked together in one
society, cannot be accounted the less rich, that their gold lies not in their
private coffers, but in the common cash; So Subjects are not to be looked upon
as the less powerful, that their strength lies in the hands of their Prince.
Princes desire only to be powerful, either to restrain the insolences of
Foreigners, or to suppress the insurrections of mutinous Subjects; So that
seeing we are protected by the first, and but justly corrected by the last, we
can never in justice repine at the powerfulness of our Prince. Sir, seeing man
desires to sway Dominions Scepter, and hates to stoop to the shrine of another
power, doubtless they had never willingly subjected themselves to Monarchy, if
they had not been convinced by their reason, of its signal advantages. It is
that Government which preventeth the emulation of competitors, which concealeth
what is to be acted, and is able to remedy those evils which delay might make
insuperable: neither of which advantages can be expected, or has ever been
perceived in a Commonwealth: and as amongst figures the pyramide stands most
firmly; so amongst Governments, Monarchy (which in the geometry of policy, may
be called the pyramide) is of all others the most sure-footed: whereas that
round figure, the Commonwealth, is globe-like always rolling; And as it is
reasonable, that the gods should govern men, because they are more rational
than men, and that man should goven bruits, because he is more rational than
those; So amongst men, it is rational and just, that because some are more
ingenious than others, and one yet more ingenious than these some; that
therefore those few (such as are Nobles) should govern the rest of the people;
and that one Monarch should govern those few Nobles. Neither is it fit, that
those who understand once the mysteries of State Affairs, and who have their
Intelligence settled once with Foreign Princes and Ministers of State, should
then be removed (as we see is, yea and must be done in Commonwealths) for that
were to remove one from a trade when he has past his apprentisage, and if
these be not removed, they will prove Monarchs at last; so that in shunning
one, we shall have many; and those many, because of their factions and
treacheries (for all can neither be honest nor concordant) shall be more
insupportable, and less useful than that one. Sir, our rambling to and fro,
tasting all Governments, evidences our folly, but adds to your glory; for
none can allege now that it is only your birth, which has entitled your
Majesty to these Crowns, which is the ordinary opprobrie wherewith other
Princes are upbraided; no Sir, for now the hand of our reason has subscribed
your election; and if there be any thing more desirable in elective Monarchy,
than there is in hereditary, your Majesty may justly pretend to both; we have
nothing to excuse our defection, but over-powering necessity, so that we may be
compared to a stone which violence may take from its place, and throw up in the
air, but its natural inclination will draw it presently to its former center;
for no sooner did occasion acquaint us with the possibility of your Majesty's
return, but immediately our acclamations and bonfires joined hand in hand to
testify the ardour of our desires, and height of our zeal for your
re-establishment: and for the future, our cheerful obedience shall atone our
former obstinacy, for which we shall ever stand in the sackcloath of
repentance: And since all good is desirable, and is desirable, because it is
good; the more desired any thing is, the better it may be judged to be; and I
am confident, never Nation desired more passionatly, nor expressed more
vehemently their desires than we at this time, whereby we have according to our
small abilities, witnessed what high thoughts and great expectations we have of
your Majesty's incomparable goodness: and as both our wishes and expectations
of your goodness are great, we hope your Majesty's endeavors to satisfy both,
will be as great as either: and that since injustice has made our former
Tyrants abominable, that ye will by justice make your Reign amiable; remember,
Sir, that as the contests and litigiousness of private persons, together with
the desire to have them terminated, was the first motive which invited men to
bow to Monarchy; So it will be now, that which will endear Monarchy to all.
Remember, Sir, that all your noble ornaments are badges of that noble virtue;
your Scepter is given you, to show your Legislative power, your Sword is given
you to punish those who disobey it, and your Crown as a reward for acting in
obedience to it. That is the virtue which Moralists esteem so much, that they
think it can have excess; a quality which is attributed to no other virtue,
besides these that are divine; such as the love of God, and such others. Your
Courts of Justice are the stomach of your Kingdom, which first digests truth
and equity, and then diffuseth it to the remotest parts of that politic body;
But, Sir, if the stomach be corrupted by depraved or phlegmatic humors, what a
languishing condition will the body be redacted to? as to war against
neighboring States, and such like martial employments; they are not necessary,
but as they defend Justice; and may justly be compared to a hedge about a
garden, which bears no fruit themselves, but defends these trees which do bear;
whereas Justice is that fruit-tree which bears the golden apples of peace,
plenty and virtue, and under whose shade your subjects may rest securely. All
we can do is, to submit to your Decrees, and to pray to the eternal and
omnipotent gods, to accumulate your Majesty with all prosperity and happiness.

The Nation did now begin to look like a body reconvalescing after a fever,
which grows more fat than it was formerly, and like a woman brought to bed, did
forget its former miseries: and I remember that being in a barg^ of pleasure,
which was covered with gold and cristal; after we were weary with music, we
fell a discoursing of the poverty of these Nations; for seeing the mines did
every year cast a golden fleece, and seeing foreigners had never forraged the
Country, it was strange to see such an ebb of treasure, where there used
formerly to be so many spring-tydes of wealth: To this another Gentleman
answered, That in all nations, there was much of the substance of gold lost in
gildings, laces, and embroideries much treasured up by misers, and lost by
their unexpected deaths; That fires in towns, and shipwreck and sights at Sea,
sunk much of it; and that the low value which was daily put upon it, lower than
formerly, made it seem more scarce. But besides these, there were some reasons
peculiar to this same Nation; such as its being cashed up by those who hid it,
fearing to be called rich, and fearing public borrowings (which was the
ordinary practice of those Rebels) or, because those who borrowed, paid but
small usery for it, and bankrupted often with it, so that the danger was great,
and the profit small: As also the money formerly was in Noblemens hands, who
because of other exigences were always using it; whereas those wretches who
had it now, did lay it in coffers, living rather conform to their low births
than their rich fortunes; Likewise neighboring Nations by raising the value of
it, drew it to them; neither did any coin pass here, but what carried the
impressa of the Nation, which made no Nation send in money to it.

After this discourse, we did begin to debate, whether in these times wherein
the Country swarmed with Traitors, a kinsman or friend could in reason
intercede for his friend or kinsman who was a Rebel? which one Philanax
alleged was unlawful; for else (said he) man being naturally inclined to
rebellion, (sparkling ambition flying naturally upwards) if the fear of
punishment did not deter them, their numbers should increase immeasurably; and
who would fear, if friends would interceed for them, and if intercession could
ransom them? and what Rebel wants some friend or kinsman? but rather loyal
persons should be ashamed of such relations. Likewise men are born subjects to
their Prince, as well as kinsmen to their relations, and so nature requires
subjection to their Prince, as much as affection to their friends: And as for
friends, there can be no friendship where there is no virtue, and there can be
no virtue where there is no loyalty, and much perjury; and seeing a kinsmans
intercession may make him guilty of all the blood that a spared Traitor may
spill, thereafter no man can be obliged to interceed for a Traitor, though a
friend, no more than he can be obliged to commit murder upon his account. And
since it is problematick in Law, whether a father ought to dilate his son, who
hatcheth rebellion, or shelter him after it is once committed, doubtless it
will determine, that a friend (whose relation is remoter than that of a father)
should not interceed (seeing to interceed is to shelter) for a notorious Rebel.

My Lord, this discourse has (I fear) rather racked your patience, than
satisfied your judgment, except your patience be as great as my discourse has
been tedious, which is morally impossible, your soul being a vessel, which can
hold no more than is measured by the true standart of virtue. Yet I expect your
Lordships pardon, since the excrescency of my Narration flows from a conceit
which I have, that I can never serve your Lordship enough; and this makes me
desire, that if I be any ways criminable, my crime may be too much service.

The Fourth Book.
THe hard-hearted ice had now dissolved it self in tears, through rage to see
it self conquered by its enemy the Sun, who advancing to his former height,
from which that rebel, Winter, had degraded him, was sending forth his beams in
troops, to subdue Winters auxiliaries; and in that sweet month of May, wherein
the earth, as a badge of her gratefulness to the Summer, begins to put on its
livery; and when the air lays aside that vail of thick mist, wherein it lapped
it self during the coldness of the Winter. In a sweet morning of that sweet
season, the two Ladies, Agapeta and Aretina, who had lien together the last
night (resolving to overtake the Sun in bed) did rise very early, leaving their
Waiting-maids lying in Morpheus embraces, who was begetting on them that
bastard babe called Laziness; and so were necessitated to play the handmaid to
each other, which was notwithstanding no great task, seeing their clothes
seemed most willing to hing upon them, as if they knew how much they were
honored by being theirs. Yet the Ladies were no sooner entered the Garden,
than they perceived the Sun walking in the heavens, who had risen that morning
sooner than formerly, to view that pleasant prospect which the earth afforded
him; and, like an indulgent father, seemed to rejoice, to see those lillies and
roses, which were the offspring of his own rays. At the corner of a hedge
they encountered Megistus and Philarites, who were signetting that sweet air,
with the yet more sweet names of their matchless Mistrisses. Philarites would
willingly have tendered his respects to them, but his heart, which did climb up
his throat, as if it would have propined it self to Aretina, had already stopped
the passage: which Megistus perceiving, and bowing, as if he would have by that
posture, showed the Ladies how much he esteemed himself below them: Fair
Ladies, said he, if our attendance upon you might suit with your diet and
quiet, we should court the employment with thousands of wishes, and acquit our
selves of it with all possible endeavors. Gentlemen, replied Agapeta, seeing we
cannot meliorate you by our society, we dare not vex you by such fruitless
attendance, neither is there any thing in such a barren employment, whereby ye
could advantage your already accomplished spirits, except in evidencing the
strength of your patience, in vanquishing without anxiety the importunacy and
impertinencies of two, rather innocent than well accomplished Ladies.
Accomplishments, said Megistus, were very imprudent if they choosed not to
lodge in such rare bodies as yours are; for, I am confident they may travel the
world over, before they find any such other receptacles; and as for us, seeing
nature glories of you as of her masterpieces, the best of men, and much more
we, may be vain of the title of your servants; an honor rather to be wished
than merited. Gentlemen, answered Aretina, if nature had intended to glory in
our shapes, she would have made us Megistus and Philarites, whose praises are
so large and numerous, that no mouth is large enough to contain them, but all
mouths run over of them; and to express whose praises, duty endeavors to make
each tongue eloquent. Incomparable Ladies, said Philarites, we have acted
nothing since our arrival here, but what we have acted as your servants, so
that if men admire us, it is because we are persons upon whom ye are pleased to
lay your commands (attributing that to desert, which is the mere effect of
favor) and so by telling us that we are admired, ye remember us of those vast
obligations which we owe you. Well, Sir, replied Aretina, since ye have
disarmed my tongue of complement, and has turned the edge of my own weapon
against me, it were high time to yield, to which I am the rather willing, that
I know that all that I can yield to you, is yours by merit formerly; for since
we owe our lives to you, and since all that a man has he will give for his
life, it is clear, that ye may challenge as yours, all that we could bestow as
our own. Agapeta desired them to end these complements, and that each of them
would remark something in that Garden, where every thing was remarkable, and
that I may begin, look how the flourish peeps out of its green palace, to
behold this sweet month, and to smell that excellent perfume, wherewith the
Sun has poudered the heads of the undergrowing hills. Aretina remarked how
time had borrowed youth from an old apple tree, to lend it to a young
cherry-tree which grew not far from it, whose coat was so long worn, that it
was now all in rags; See ye not (continued she) how it has stood so long that
it is now weary, and would willingly lie down, if the careful Gardener had not
provided a staff for its age to lean upon? and yet in spite of age, ye see how
its fruits do flourish, ripening always as the tree grows old, and bringing
seeds in their bosom wherewith to plenish the earth after they are gone, and
the tree fallen. Observe, fair Ladies, said Megistus, how these red roses
blush, and these tulips grow pale, through anger to see their beauty so
outstript by yours, and how these cherries, albeit they be but hard hearted
creatures, yet understand their duty so well as bow downwards to do you
obeisance, and would willingly throw themselves at your feet, if their stalks
did not hinder them; and how yonder pond has drawn your picture, and placed it
in its bosom, presenting it to you when ye approach, to indicate the high
value it sets upon your beauty, and concealing it when ye are gone, fearing
lest any should rob it. Philarites recommended to them, to advert, how the gods
had cleared the sky purposely that morning, that they might have the fuller
view of them; and how the grass propi^e^ their shoes with their pearly drops,
which seemed to kiss their feet in token of subjection. This gave them occasion
to laugh at one another pretty conceits, wherein their wanton inventions
seemed to sport themselves.

After this, they went to repose themselves a little in an Arbor, where all
the branches had laid their heads together, to resist the scorching Sun, and to
shelter those who refuged under its protection, and whose walls like strainers,
did separate the light from the heat, keeping out the one, and letting in the
other; refuting thereby the opinion of some Philosophers, who opinion that
light is nothing but fire dilated, and that fire is nothing but light
contracted. Megistus and Agapeta stayed a little behind, both that they might
the more freely entertain one another, and that they might give Philarites the
convenience of entertaining Aretina, who finding that none eyed him, threw up
his eyes, as if he durst not fix them upon Aretina, and passionatly sighed up
these few words. O heavens, what favor have I done you, that ye should lend me
this hand? or rather, wherein have I offended you, that ye should, as a
punishment, crown my soul in this ocean of joy? Can I, miserable Philarites, be
so happy, as to find an occasion of evidencing to Aretina, how that his
happiness depends solely upon her? Whereto Aretina smiling, replied, Can
passion conquer unconquerable Philarites? or, is it Philarites pleasure, to act
the personage of an enamorato, to testify how exquisit he is, not only in real
virtue, but even in apparent passion? Philarites would have proceeded further,
but was interrupted by the cries of one who came running to him, and who looked
like one who had propined his wit to love for his Mistress sake, thinking all
donatives besides, unworthy presents for so divine a passion; his flaming zeal
which had stayed within so long as there was any thing unconsumed for it to
feed upon, did now flash abroad at his nostrils, and by its smoke had
obfuscated his native color: his eyes by their rolling and continual motion,
witnessed that they missed the object, whereon they desired to fix their rays;
and the variety of his motions, show the lightness of the body which was moved,
his words were cut to pieces by his inconsiderate irresolution, and the torrent
of his discourse resembled a river, which the broader it grows, grows always
the shallower; such was the heat of his passion, that it made him tear off all
his clothes, and his looks and thoughts strove, which should change oftest.
This was the miserable Moragapus, who was enamoured of a young Lady called
Calista, who gave him a very kindly requittal of his love, which an Alexandrian
Gallant, who was his rival, perceiving, persuaded him that Calista had deserted
him, and had bestowed her affection upon another; whereupon Moragapus, who
lived then in the Country, desires to return to the City, but was impeded by
his father, who conjectured his errand, and who protested withal, that as he
had fettered himself by love, so he should be fettered by chains, if he turned
not proselyte to a fathers entreaties. This made Moragapus melancholy, and his
melancholy did dictate to him some expressions, which enraged his father, so
that he hermitaged him in a chamber, denying him company, which was the sole
cure of his sick fancy, and diversion, which was the only probable mean to
recover him out of his frantic love: this restraint did fully fling him over
the rock of distraction, upon whose edge he stood formerly (passion resembling
those spiritfull horses, who stir most and are maddest, when the bridle is most
straightly held by the rider; and men resembling often fine clothes, which corrupt
most when they are kept closest; and the will is of the nature of these things,
which spill by being packed up in too narrow bounds) and thereafter he became
so demented, that whereas they kept him formerly under restraint for
prevention, they were obliged to do it now, through necessity: at last the
merciless fire having one night seized upon his fathers house, he was brought
out, and amidst the confusions wherein all were involved at that time, he
escapes their hands, and comes straight to Alexandria, and finding the Garden
door open, he enters, and apprehends Aretina to have been Calista, whereupon he
runs to her, and flings himself at her feet, quivering out the irregular notes
of his ill tune'd passion; leaping from sentence to sentence, and sometimes
running over one sentence twice, till Aretina, sorry to see this tyranny of
madness, assured him, that Calista was in another corner of the Garden, which
information posts him away, (his light body being easily blown away by the
least puffed of persuasion) and accidentally he spieth Calista walking upon the
brink of a deep pond, which was hemmed in with marble, he no sooner spies her,
but he runns to her, and she no sooner spies him, but that terrified with the
unexpectedness of the sight, (for it had been concealed from her) and fearing
some outrage, she offered to step back, but her gown feltring her feet, trips
up her heels, so that she falls in the pond, her weight and haste carrying her
to the bottom: but the water, which seemed to glory that so rich a pearl was to
be found there, did throw her body presently up again, as if it intended to
show that she was in its possession; yet albeit the water show her, she could
show no appearance of life, for death (that rather tyrant than conqueror) who
like a rigid creditor, exacts of us that last debt oftimes before the ordinary
term of payment) had possessed it self of all the chief forts of her soul, and
had displayed his ordinary standard, paleness, in her face, to show that the
place was conquered: at her fall, the water did flee circular-wise from her
body, fearing to be accessory to the murder of so choice a person, and looked
drumely at so tragic a misfortune; yet she might have escaped, if the thrice
unfortunate Moragapus had not leapt in after her, and there by struggling to
save her, had not drowned both himself and her.

The Knights and Ladies who knew nothing of this sad occurrant, were sitting
all this while in the Arbor; and Megistus was remarking from Moragapus looks
(wherein all might have read his distraction) how much they were to blame, who
blamed Phisiognomy, as an Art both artless and uncertain: for, said he, seeing
the dullest amongst men, may perceive by that fellows looks, his madness;
certainly others of more prying spirits, and a more frequent observation, may
come to discern the nature of less observable looks, for there is not so great
a disproportion, betwixt those evidently known looks, and others that are less
discernable, than there is betwixt an artlesse observation, and a serious and
experimental remark; for as an unexperienced clown, can see nothing in the face
of heaven, albeit a skillful Astrologue can prognostic from it, what weather
is to be expected; So a skillful Phisiognomist may perceive, what is
undiscernable by the eye of a skillesse guesser: And we see, that different
tempers have different faces, the Melancholians looks, differing for from those
of a Flegmatician; and so, since these temperaments are natural, we may
conclude, that the difference of those looks which are proper to them, must be
likewise natural, and if natural, why not discoverable by Art? seeing it is
natural to man, to know all Natures operations: for, albeit there be many
Provinces in the Globe of Learning, which are yet unknown (man's laziness
restraining him from such new adventures) yet the Needle of Reason being
observed, we may come to coast Natures greatest difficulties. We see likewise
that a man's looks, changes as his thoughts, which argues clearly, that there is
some connection and dependence betwixt the thoughts and looks: for, our bodies
do resemble a lanthorn, wherein that divine light, the soul, is placed; and our
faces are the horn through which may be easily perceived, whether the within
shining light be in it self clear, or not; and it would appear very suitable to
divine Providence, that ingenuity should wear some badge whereby it may be
known, and being known may be respected; whereas roguery, wearing its own
colors, may be found out, and so evited, lest else honest men should be
cheated upon all occasions by soulless knaves.

Your sex is much obliged to this poor fellow, said Agapeta, for he has
vindicated you of that aspersion wherewith generally all men are tainted, which
is, That all their passion is but simulate; wherefore, Sir, I could wish to
hear from you, whether men can be really enamoured of such ugly faces at all,
and whether they can be so deeply taken with the best, as to become distracted
through missing them?

Madam, replied Megistus, providence seems for ornament, to have filled the
gallery of this world with faces strangely different; yet, on the other hand,
when we consider, how the most exquisit pencile is not able to draw two faces
in nothing unlike, we may judge, that this variety has been rather the effect
of chance, than pains; and if we consider what a great variety of thoughts are
to be found in the world, there being some dependence betwixt thoughts and
faces, we need not admire the difference of faces: for, man's face being patched
up of so many traits and colors; and the eye (which influenceth hugely upon
the looks, the face changing according to the difference of the eye, as a
picture does by the several positions of an optic glass) being so varying in
it self, it is rather a wonder, to see how two faces should be found any-wayes
like, than that two faces should be so dislike; wherefore, Nature having
produced all men and women to be coupled together, and nothing being so able to
couple them as affection, it has given several inclinations to men and women,
whereby they are in a manner constrained to love those different faces; for,
man being naturally incomplete, needs a fellow-helper to accomplish him; and as
every piece will not serve to accomplish and fill up the vacant room of what is
wanting, neither is it enough that it be either greater, or of better stuff, So
it is not sufficient, to make a man love a woman, that she is of nobler
extraction, richer, or wittier than her whom he loves: no, that is not
sufficient, for it is likewise requisite, that she be exactly adapted to his
fancy; for, if all men loved only those who were wise, rich, or noble; there
being many women who can pretend to neither, there should be many who behoved
for ever to live unmarried, and albeit a man may think that he could marry any
of many hundreds whom he sees, yet he is in that mistaken; Not unlike an
Artisan who takes up several pieces, thinking them fit enough to fill a void,
which when he applies he finds most unfit. And the difference of the eyes which
look, makes the difference often of what is looked upon; for as in a plain
glass, that object seems great which is lessened much by a concave mirror; so
some eyes judge that beautiful, which others account ugly; and if reason were
employed as the only proxenet, yet we should see as much of this variety in the
love of faces, as we see there is in the love of opinions; and as there is no
opinion so absurd but it will still find a patron; so there should be no face
so ugly, but it should find a lover: And seeing there would be such different
choices, even albeit reason were umpire; what may we expect from fancy, whose
acts being but simple apprehensions, must be more different than the acts of
the judgment, which never traces in any path except where reason is its guide.
And as to the other question, which your Ladyship proposed, Whether loves
storms may blow so furiously, as to shatter our reason, and may appear so
terrible as to fright us out of our wits: I believe certainly, Madam, that it
may; for, as a person may overreach himself so, to the effect that he may
grasp that which is placed in a high place above him, that he may disjoynt his
body thereby; so the soul of man may endeavor so to reach up the hand of
desire, that it may disjoynt it self by its nimious attempt; and a man's reason
may fly for shame to see it self so disappointed, as that what it desired most
to enjoy, should be enjoyed by another: And as the body may weary it self so,
in hunting and traversing to and fro, as that it may by that immoderat travel,
fall in some uncurable disease; so, the soul may by too anxious cares run it
self in some insuperable distemper; Neither can I blame altogether such a
generous wit, as scorns to outlive its own felicity, and who desires to
understand nothing, after he understands that his Mistress disaffections him;
for then, the wit which formerly served him as an ornamen^, will then serve him
only as a torturer. And such a lover may appositly be compared to one who draws
a cord, or any thing else to him, with such vehemence, that if it break, he
must undoubtedly fall; and his wits may be said to leave their old residence,
that they may by roaving up and down, try if they can find her whom they so
much admire, and adore so intensly; Yet, Madam, albeit I revere passionatly
that divine virtue, Love, I cannot notwithstanding, but hate that species of
it, which being nursed by avarice, languishes thereafter in coffeehouse (and
no wonder that such foul milk should occasion an ill tempered complexion)
neither can I comprehend how true lovers can be soldered together by gold, a
metal which the gods seems to have hid in the bowels of the earth, lest our
avarice should have taken notice of it; must that dross which carries only the
impressa of some Monarch, be preferred to the rich metal of true love? which
bears the effigies of the immortal gods, and which is only forged in heavens
mint-house, whence nothing that is impure proceeds, and where nothing that is
pure is lacking: And must the Suns bastard be preferred to that celestial
offspring? Are Venus chains become weaker than formerly through too much
usage? or has the Suns continued influence, refined gold to a greater
excellency than it was of in the days of our predecessors? Can avarice, which
ingendreth murders, rapines, thefts, and rebellion, be the parent of so divine
and heroic virtues? or can that which cannot incite a man to the acts of
generation, be the basis of that whereby all true generation is warranted? as
also there is much imprudence in this choice, for gold having made a man
dispense with the tenderness, lameness, or uncomliness of a wife, she brings
him forth such children, as that their ugly shapes, and crabbed humors, makes
him ashamed to term himself their father; and who needs more money to patch up
those imperfections in each of them when they are to be matched, than he
received by his match with their mother? beside what treasure he must squander
daily amongst Physicians and Apothecaries (from whom they must buy a lease of
their life) to maintain that ruinous fabric which totters from the first day
it was founded; neither need I swell up this sum of their fathers miseries,
with either his inward frettings, which must be as numerous as are the views
which he has, either of his deformed wife, or formless children: or the
outward opprobries, wherewith he hears both her and them daily aspersed, by
jeering neighbors and railing adversaries, who are glad to find something
whereon to fix the teeth of their envy; who will not miss to upbraid him with
his avarice, and them with their defects; and albeit there be no infallibility,
yet there is much probability in that conjecture, that such as is the body,
such must be the soul, Nature having like a wise merchant, bestowed the finest
cases upon the richest Jewels or Watches. There are lkewise another race of
Cupids bastards, who love as soon as they are acquaint, and these love often times
because they are not well acquaint; they love often, before they try one another
tempers, and so join often with those of contrary tempers, and this being as
opposite in their humors, as fire, water, and the other elements, they agree
often as these assimbolick elements do, the one extinguishing the other, and the
one devouring the other; and as the conjunction of these can never parentate
any production, so their copulations are often barren, and never very fruitful.
Neither do the inconveniences which accress from hence sist in their personal
prejudice only, but turns also to the prejudice of many others, for of these
two who are so unfitly matched; the one might have been a good wife, if she had
married another husband, and so it occasions that others misfortune; and the
other might have proven a good husband, if he had married another wife; and so
that match has occasioned that other woman's prejudice. Wherefore seeing willing
rashness marreth so many marriages, I admire why Judges and Legislators should
by constrained inconsideratness occasion more; for, if a fantastic youth,
demented by a fond passion, do promise marriage to a woman, they oblige him to
marry her, albeit ^e neither understand what is the strength of a promise, nor
the nature of marriage, a thing in it self not so reasonable as legal; and yet,
if straightly examined, will scarce be found legal: for, if the consent or
promise of a mad man, or a fool, will not oblige him to a performance, why
should they who are both mad and fond, either through love, or lust, be so
straightened? and that they are either idiots, or furious, may be conjectured by
the effects, (which are the means whereby in all cases such persons are
dig^osced) for if they were not such, they would never throw themselves away
upon such bargains, nor sell themselves and their liberties at the rate of one
hours pleasure; and if we may justly account him distracted, who sells an
opulent fortune for a toy, how much more may we conclude him such, who
exchanges his liberty, which is by far more excellent than his fortune, for
that which is much worse than a toy? and if the Law rescinds bargains, where
the buyer is cheated in a half, why should they confirm this, wherein he is
cheated in all, and where he gains nothing but coffeehouse, which is worse
than nothing? and if we will turn over the Records either of history or
experience, we will learn there, what murders, rapins, and massacres have
budded from this same root, which this same promise springs from, even from
distracted love, whose slames burns often reason to ashes, and contagins all the
faculties of him with whom it resides; and if the Law obliges not him, who has
tied himself by a causeless paction, albeit of the smallest importance; how can
it tie him to perform a promise which has no cause, or if it has any, is such
a cause, as is abominable and filthy, and so rather invaliditats than
corroborats the thing promised; and I am confident, that the expectation of a
promise, induces many to whore, who otherwise would continue chaste (many being
content to sell their chastity who would never bestow it freely) and it is most
sacrilegious to see that divine contract, which should be only celebrated in
the temples of the immortal gods, celebrated in bordels and whorish beds.

This discourse ended, Agapeta entreated the Knights to remove a little, to
prevent misconstruction; for, said she, our tender repute may be easily
wounded, except it be armed with caution, and our favors which we bestow upon
you as strangers, will be certainly envyed, except they be palliated by
prudence: The Knights, in obedience to their desire, removed presently, leaving
the Ladies to their private entertainment, and congratulating their own
indicible happiness: but Philarites was scarce arrived at his chamber, when a
Letter was presented to him by a Gentleman, whose joy could scarce suffer him
to deliver it. Philarites as impatient to know what was in it, as fearful that
it was to recall him home, broke it open, and trembling did read it thus.

Dear Son,
YOur silence and absence have founded an opinion of your death in the minds of
all my Nobles, who now cantone themselves in factions, hoping either to snatch
the Crown from my old head whilst I yet live, or at least to vie for it
immediately after my death. Great men's ambition is never so fast asleep, but
that the least touch from the hand of occasion is able to awake it, and when it
begins once to stir, neither the respect which they bear to their Prince, nor
the thundrings of an accusing conscience, are able to terrify that fearless
monster: the fear of your death, and of their rage, do like two ropes, drag me
to my grave; and how can the weak natural heat of an old heart resist the
coldness of age, when joined with that of melancholy? and when an old man is
laid upon the deathbed of grief, his speech will surely be laid shortly.
Wherefore, Son, if ye have not forgot your duty, as well as your country, return
home immediately after the receipt hereof, and relive both your Father, and your
Crown, whose languishing condition requires your assistance; for my weak hands
are no longer to sway such a Scepter, nor my old head ^able to support a Crown,
which care and rebellion has made weightier than it was formerly.


This fatal Letter did put Philarites resolution to a bay, his fathers
condition, and his own affection divided equally the forces of his mind betwixt
them; his fathers condition required a cure, and yet his affection to Aretina
would not suffer him to be the Physician: knowing that whilst he endeavored to
recover his lost Crown, he hazarded the loss of Aretina, who was dearer than
his Crown to him. To unkernel which doubt, he sends for Megistus, who persuaded
him, presently to obey his father; For, said he, will ye hazard Aretina's Crown
by your lingering? or, would ye wish to marry her, except ye had a Crown to
bestow upon her? or think ye, that she will mind him who minds not his own
business? Sir, Love requires that ye should ensure your Ladies Kingdom, Nature
requires that ye should assist your old Father, Justice requires that ye should
punish Traitors, and Gallantry requires that ye should rather follow, than flee
dangers. Let not your Valor be like the Physician, who can cure others, but
not himself: and whilst those who know you not, talk of your courage and
conduct, let not your subjects, who know you, smile at your esseminate
cowardishnesse.

This discourse determined the question, betwixt Philarites affection and his
courage: so leaving Megistus, he marched straight to Aretina's chamber, where
finding her alone, (Monan^hropus being gone to the country) he enters, waited
on only by a cheerful countenance, and after a low obeisance made, he thus
expresses himself to her: Incomparable Aretina, my Fathers commands, and the
necessities of my Nation, rather drives, than takes me away from this place:
neither is it so much to ensure a Crown, as it is to ensure your Crown, that I
undertake this pilgrimage. If I wanted natural affection, I were unworthy to be
your Servant; and if I wanted a Crown, I were unworthy to be your husband:
Wherefore I come to beg your permission to return home, to satisfy the one,
and to fix the other; hoping in my absence, to testify my constancy, and by my
speedy return, to witness what a high value I put upon your presence, in which
I taste the choicest of contentments, and without which all things besides
seems but tastless to the palate of my pleasure. Aretina surprised, but not
dejected at what she heard, did, much to his satisfaction, deceive his
expectation; returning him this sweet answer. Philarites, Virtue and I are not
at such odds, as that ye must displease the one, to obey the other; no*
Philarites, I am confident the gods will prove a target to defend you, whilst
ye prove the sword of your family: my sex makes me fearful, yet my experience
makes me confident of the unalterableness of your affection; and I know you to
be too generous in every thing else, to prove base in that, wherein the basest
of men prove often generous. Wherefore go, invincible Philarites, victory waits
for you; only, remember your friends, when either your leisure, or pleasure,
can steal an hour from your more weighty employments, and with that she
imbraceth him, and entreats him instantly to be gone: for, said she, a woman's
courage should be tried, not tempted, and if ye would wish me to pers^vere,
take from me by your speedy removal, the means of repenting. Philarites was
confounded by this command; for albeit she gave him leave to go, yet she did
that with so much grace, that it invited him once yet to stay wholly. But
whilst he was thus debating what was fittest to be done, she fell upon an
expedient her self, of taking at her own hands what she desired from him; for
stepping in to her closet, and closing the door, she left him alone, obliged in
civility to depart her chamber. Yet in retiring, she glanced over her shoulder,
and then, only one tear broke the pr^ison of her fair eyes, pressed out by the
multitude of those other tears which stood behind it; but no sooner was she
entered, but that unruly crowd forced themselves a passage, and as a volley of
small shot, discharged themselves in honor of Philarites intended voyage: who
rather dissembling than quenching his passion, went to Agapeta's chamber,
accompanied by Megistus, to tender his respects to her, for his Majesty was
then gone abroad; to whom, immediately upon his return, he addressed himself,
and by whom he was dismissed with many extraordinary testimonies of his singular
affection to him, ordering his Guards to wait upon him to the utmost confines
of Egypt, and all the Ordnance to send their shot a piece of the way with him:
he ordered likewise by the Lord Chamberlain, that his Master of Ceremonies,
should carry to him some Jewels, and that the Kings Jeweller should carry to
him some Plate (for these were the formalities of all those Nations) all which
he refused, accepting only from the hands of Agapeta (to whom the King
entrusted that particular, hoping by the quality of the giver to oblege him to
accept the gift) his Majesty's Portrait, richly decked with inestimable Jewels,
which he accepted, telling her, that he thought himself much honored, by
having the means when he pleased of coming in his Majesty's presence: and so he
departed Alexandria, all who met him, proffering him their attendance; but he,
acknowledging their courtesy, told them, that his business with Megistus
required some retiredness: and thus they two rode out together, followed only
by Kalodulus, whom Megistus commanded to wait upon Philarites, and pressed him
further to accept of his attendance, alleging, that he could not now abandon
him in difficulties apparently greater, and certainly such as related to him
more nearly, than those wherein they had been formerly jointly engaged; but
Philarites declined it most resolutely: for, said he, our affairs here requires
that one of us should be present, and my pressures at home are not yet come to
that maturity, but that I alone may suppress them, So that since your presence
is necessary in the one, and would be superfluous in the other, I will entreat
your stay; and if these weeds wax higher, I will then, and not till then,
entreat your absence; and will in this play the wise General, who keeps the
choice of his forces as a reserve, till the latter end of the day. Whereupon,
locking themselves in one another arms, they showed more compassion than could
be expect^d from men of such a vast courage, bold men's veins and eyes being
filled with blood, whereas those of compassionat men are filled with tears, for
those objects which move the one to compassion, move the other to revenge; We
see ordinarily that steel cannot be softened, nor can the fiery flint be
hollowed by the falling drops of water, as the softer stones are: yet sometimes
sorrow, which cannot beget revenge, nor ease it self that way, breaks out in
compassion, and when the heat of affection tempers the steel of courage, it
becomes pliable at pleasure. After this Philarites ships in, and by the help of
the complacent winds (who whistled like a waggoner to move the ship to run more
swiftly) in a short space, takes leave of Megistu^ long-tracing eyes, who stood
upon the shore both sorrowful, and glad of his so ready passage. After a
fortnights journey, he arrives in Thracia, and writes to Evander his father, to
provide Coaches, Suits, and Attenders for him, and shortly enters Bizantium the
capital City of Thracia, and passes along all its streets, with a cavalcade
of all the Nobility and Gentry of the Nation, who, conscious to their own
guilt, and fearing that it would be revealed by some of their Colleagues, each
labors by his discovery to prevent the rest of the Complot: and thus, every
one fearing to speak to his neighbor of a Combination, they acquiesce to what
Philarites commanded; yet he, desirous, like a good Physician, that that ulcer
should ripen, that so it might break, and purge the body of some pestilential
humors, suffers some to be dissatisfied, who running to their arms, flocked
to one Philenus, a Thracian Nobleman, whom he had immediately upon his return
secured, and whom he caused the Jailer suffer now to escape, who rendevouzed
shortly six thousand men; for he expected, if not to gain the field by
fighting, yet at least, to ensure his life and estate by capitulation; to which
effect, he writes presently to Philarites, promising to draw all under his
command to his Highness obedience, upon the security of his life and fortune:
This Philarites no sooner received, but he dispatches copies of it to his
Agents in Philenus Army, who disseminate amongst the Soldiery Philenus
treachery, who used them only as means to gain his own, and not their peace,
which so alienated the hearts of his dependers from him, that they quit him
peice-meal; whereof Philarites (who with two Regiments of Horse waited this
occasion) being ascertained, falls upon him and his Confederates, and suffers
few of them to escape; which catastrophe of these bold rebels brought the
Nation to its former obedience.

Let us again glance a little at Aretina; upon whom Ophni Duke of Iris had
looked through the prospect of respect; which usually aggrandizes all things
that are represented by it; which dye had tinctured so all his thoughts, as
that neither the soap of pains, nor the Fullers earth of reason, were able to
return them to their former color: love being like pitch, which no sooner
touches than it sticks; and which when it once sticks, can hardly be removed:
wherefore finding that this barbed arrow which Cupid had stuck in him, could not
be drawn back, without leaving its head in the wound, he resolves to drive it
forward, and resolves either to lose himself, or to gain her; seeing without
her, he concluded himself fit for nothing: and albeit the vastness of her
fortunes (being only heir to a potent Duke) were golden mountains, over which
his meaner condition (being low in his estate) could scarce scramble; and which
being past, the difficulties were not yet all overcome, for she was yet
fortified by her fathers honors, and her own beauty; to batter all which
ramperts, he could bring no other engyns, besides those of importunity,
patience, and confidence: but alas, poor Ophni, the fort of her affection is
strongly manned by the high thoughts she has of Philarites, and is provisioned
daily by the persuasions and cunning of Megistus and Agapeta, and all the
avennues of her servants and familiars are already blocked up with gold
(cemented with civility) by Philarites during his last residence at Court; and
as to thy pains, these small ordnance will never reach her, love being like to
these shapes which are casten in a mould, which if they be not rightly molded
at the very first, can never (or at least hardly) be helped by any future
endeavors; and the wild fancy is of the nature of all other untamed beasts,
which must be taken at a start, else can hardly be laid hold upon.

He endeavors by company, to conjure away these hopgoblin fancies, but all in
vain; for, albeit whilst he is with his friends it leaves him, yet no sooner
leaves he them, but instantly it returns to him; for albeit a melancholian may,
like an ill-going clock, have the index of his humor put right by the hand of
a friend, or of company, yet the in-works of his soul being distempered by that
corrupt rust, he will presently run wrong as formerly. Finding no solacement
here, he wanders in woods and groves (the ordinary galleries of such
enamorato's) but there he is more distempered than formerly; for those fancies
which could not follow him foot for foot in the crowd of Court, finds now room
to walk side for side with him; for meditation being but a digested
representation of what species and ideas were hudled up in the memory formerly,
it can do nothing else, but make a more of what was but a much formerly: and
so, if it find a man to have much prudence, or piety, it will make him to have
more of both; whereas if it find him to have much impiety, or passion, it will
screw them up to a greater height: and hence springs that proverb, that a
solitary person must be either a Saint or a Devil; for, it being an
extraordinary custom, it must argue an extraordinary genius; and albeit
meditation be a mirror wherein one may see himself represented without error
or flattery, yet it is such a mirror as is the Sea, which if troubled, can
represent no object whatsoever: Even so, if meditation be tossed with the
storms of passion, its surface can represent nothing but horror. And man being
sociable naturally, as we see by all the faculties of his soul, and number of
his senses, which were useless, if he were cloistred up in an Hermitage: for,
why was the tongue given him, but to express to others his own thoughts, and to
answer theirs? why his ears, but to hear others, etc. doubtless therefore his
retiredness must be supernatural; and so either angelical, or diabolick. And
the gods by distributing some perfections to one, some to another, have
necessitated us either not to aim at any further accomplishment, or if we do,
to learn it from one another; and how can that be done but in society? As also,
in heaven we shall be fully happy; and yet there shall be there no hermitages,
but we shall cleave together; which evidences, that hermitage and happiness
roll not upon the same axletree. But neither could Ophni sing a requiem to his
passion here, for his love presents to him the disparity of their fortunes, and
this starts avarice; his love muster^ to him all those who may pretend to be
his rivals, and that starts up his envy, or at least, a passion less virtuous
than emulation: his love terrifies him with the numbers of her fathers honors,
and that puffs up his ambition. And thus hounded by all these raging passions,
he knows not where to run, nor how to shelter: he tumbles down upon the ground,
as if like an itchy horse, he meant to ease himself by rubbing with it; and
immediately starting up, with his arms crossed, he paws with his foot, as if he
intended to beat the earth, because it could not relieve him; but finding the
earth could not help him, he throws up his eyes to heaven (an ordinary posture
even amongst disconsolat Atheists, foreordained by providence to prove their
dependence upon supernal powers) thinking that the other goddesses had taken
her up there, to be their colleague. After this he turns to the by-running
streams, but they glide away so swiftly, as that they will not stay to hear
him; and the fishes, as if it were in derision, leaps up, to show him what a
priceless thing is freedom. The inhospital air likewise, to aggrege his
misfortunes, no sooner receives his doleances, but each part of it, as if it
were weary of them, posts them away immediately to another part yet remoter, and
at last refuses flatly to carry them any further: he vexes to see the crows,
like frugal masters of families, build their nests, and feed their young ones;
and to see those organists of heaven, the chanting larks, from their natural
cage the firmament, quiver out their melodious notes, the air opening it self
willingly to receive such a pleasant harmony: and all these free from court
care, and afflicting affection; whereas he, who brags of being created the
master of all these, has his head toiled with the cares of his family, and his
breast burnt with the flames of love. At last, being refused shelter by all
these, he addresses himself to that bold undertaker, confidence; who persuades
him to return to Court, and promised to make way for him. I am (said
confidence) that skillful Physician, who has recovered thousands of patients,
after that others have condemned them to die; I am that bold Warrior who has
often recruited desperate Armies; and by my hands have gallant and overweening
Ladies been thrown in the arms, of by them despised Gentlemen. Goutish fear is
never able to overtake his prey, and he stands so long harkening to reason,
that the bird is flown before he come to the nest; I strike so often that I must
kill at sometime; and I rally so suddenly, that I can never be beaten, or if I
be beat, none dares twit me, lest I fall foul on them also. And I pray you
(continued confidence) as a Ladies favor is the greatest prize in the world,
so her refusal is one of the smallest affronts: for, since all men confess
that none can sufficiently merit a Ladies favor, what wrong is done, or what
affront is received in not obtaining what was not merited; and seeing a woman's
choice is attributed to her fancy, what wise man will esteem you a whit the
worse, that her fancy conceited that ye were worse than ye are? He may be a
good archer who misses his mark once, and an excellent merchant who loses one
adventure: choice things are like diamonds of the rock, to gain which, pains
are required; neither is the lame hands of fear, fit to dig in the mine of
golden love. Fear is a cold humor, and so extinguisheth these divine fires,
whereas courage is an oil fit to conserve it. She loves you possibly, albeit
she proclaims it not; and there may be fire in that which seems only an hard
flint; she intends like all other women, to set a price upon her affection by
the difficulty of obtaining it, and will have the race to be long, ^eing the
prize is great; she will have you to ^ause the world take notice of her worth;
and ^elf-love, and vanity must needs have that come^y of Courtship entertained,
because they are so ^ickled by it. And it is reason, that she should have some
time to try his humor, to whom she ^ntends to subject hers at all times. When
we buy that which is of any value, a slight view will not satisfy us; neither
would ye your self bestow your child without a most strict enquiry what his
qualities and estate were upon whom ye bestowed her.

To extricate himself from these jarring debates, he sends for an old Priest
who was Monanthro^us intimate acquaintance, and had likewise served his own
father formerly, and communicates his design to him, and entreats him to deal
with Monanthropus, which the Priest undertakes, and represents so cunningly to
Monanthropus Lady, that he gains by her mediation her husbands consent; with
this proviso, That Ophni should bestow his daughters estate upon her eldest
son, who should carry her Name and A^ms, and that the second should have the
Duchy of Iris. To which Ophni agrees, since the honor of his own family was
not in the least obfuscated thereby, which was to be maintained entire, in the
person of his second son. This being agreed to, betwixt Ophni and the parents,
they begin to sound the daughters inclinations, and her mother presses first,
that she should marry, that the estate might be entailed upon her; whereas if
she who was her mother, dyed, her father might marry a second wife, and so
settle the estate upon her children. Aretina seems not to heed that discourse
only she said she would consult with time (^ Counselor whom experience had
made wise) and that many young Ladies had been accounted famous, for living
chast^, but never any for marrying too soon; that the bearers were oft-times
broken by pulling fruit too soon; and that she would rather live without a
husband, than marry without singular affection; for, seeing a conjugate life was
hedged in with so many thorny difficulties, and attended by so many dangers to
those of her sex, she resolved never to marry, til^ she found one for whom she
would be willing to hazard dangers, and encounter difficulties. At last the
mother thinking that her daughter was like those who will never bargain til they
see their merchant; or like those merchants, who will never sell freely till
they see money; proposed to her a match with Ophni Duke of ^ris (having
formerly commanded her Nurse and Maids to speak of him with all respect
possible) whereat Aretina smiling told her, that such a big tree as a Duke, was
not fit to be engrafted upon any other root; meaning ^^at he would never
relinquish his own family, ^o maintain the honor of any's else. What, said
^onaria, if he bestow the estate which comes with you upon your eldest son, and
his own upon his second son? really, replied Aretina, I would not marry one,
who honored so little ^is ancient family, to which he owes all the difference,
which there is between him and his ser^ant, and for whose support his
predecessors have ^oiled so much: for as a man should, and does love his father
more tenderly than his Prince; so (...) man should love his old heritage better
than his Country: and I should hate him, who betrayed his Country to pleasure a
Mistress.

Ophni had always hitherto with much instance and a superstitious observance
paid his respects ^o Aretina, speaking with his eyes what his mouth durst not;
but at last finding that darts thrown at so great a distance could wound but
^ightly, imboldned by her parents assistance, he expresses thus his passion to
her one morning.

Madam, it appears that Nature, like all Artisans, becomes daily the more
skillful, and that in shaping others she has been studying how to shape you,
and has also as they do, reserved the choicest of her stuff till she was fully
assured of her own skill. Since therefore every thing that is new excites
admiration, and since every thing that is ex^raordinary is new, I hope,
incomparable Lady* that ye will pardon those who adore with respect, that
nature has made matchless by her skill, and since she shows more art than
formerly, why should not we a^^mire more than formerly? As for me, Madam, I
a^^knowledge that admiration invited me to know, and the knowledge engendered
love; but oh! better to have co^^tinued ignorant, than to have become arrogant:
for sin^ love intends a conjunction, it must make a parity; and is arogance to
wish that love should make a parity, whe^^ nature has made such an imparity.
Yet, Madam, suff^^ me to respect you, since respect has imbosomed in it (...)
subordination; and be confident, that my desires sh^^ never advance beyond the
skreen of a profound respec^^ till it be ushered-in further by your
irresistible com^mands, or at least connived at by your permission.

Aretina shunned to use any eloquence in he^ answers to him, but rather in
discourse, gesture^ and all her other actions, endeavored to reclai^^ him from
his passion by a feigned show of imper^fection; but all in vain, for his
disease had con^tinued too long to be now cured, neither was h^ so blinded by
his passion, but that he saw he^ dissimulation: which because it argued so much
wit, did engage his affection more deeply tha^ formerly. Her father continues
to press her, but she declines the match, protesting that albeit she had no
inclinations for any else, yet she had a^ aversion from Ophni; and to marry her
to him* were to tie an eagle to a stone, or make a fish flie^ in the air: for
that was as much contrary to he^ humor, as these actions were contrary to
theirs.

Aretina finding her fathers perseverance in (...) wherein she intended to show
so much ob^^acy, acquainted Agapeta with it, who revea^^ it to Megistus, and
dissuaded her likewise (...) it; and one day it was Megistus good for^e to have
an occasion to flout Ophni; for at Marriage of one of the Officers of the
Crown, ^^re was a solemnity to be used of running at ^^e Tilt, wherefore
Megistus feigns himself in^sposed a day before, but at the day appointed (...)
mounts himself in a blue armor, overspread ^ith the Ivy and the Vine twisted
together; in (...) shield for a device, he carried two Hands ^^asping one
Sword, and defending one Heart; ^^e word was, If against one, against both.
after that the Kings nephew had run his course against the Martial Knight (who
was now retur^ed to Court) and had almost broken his heart ^ith rage, because
he could not break a spear ^ith success in presence of Agapeta, whom all ^he
Nation did destinate for his Mistress; Ophni ^ppeared next, who longed to give
proof of his ^itherto unexperimented valor before Aretina; ^is armor was
painted over with a green field, ^herein some fruits and flowers were beginning
^o flourish, but looked as if blasted with a cold ^^ost, and their leaves
engrailed or beaten with ^ail; in his shield he bore Cupid, piercing a fla^ning
heart, and yet trampling upon it; the word was, Too cruel to be a god. Against
him appeared Megistus, who had but presently entered the field; carrying upon
the top of his spear Aret^na's Picture, which made Ophni presently t^ single
him out of the crowd to be his antagonist (...) but the other sent a Trumpet to
meet him, an^ desired to know if he carried her Picture also which Ophni
presently produced; whereupon both the Pictures were delivered to the Judges to
be given to the Conqueror. This done, they begin their carreer, and at the
first encounte^ breaks both their staves, with equal success; an^ then drawing
their swords, they bestow many blows very freely, but courage was not able to
defray Ophni's charges in contesting after tha^ fashion with Megistus; and
albeit Ophni fough^ for a Mistress, and Megistus only for a Friend, ye^ there
was greater disparity betwixt the Champions, than there was betwixt the
Quarrels. Yet even in the Quarrel, Megistus had the advantage; for albeit he
fought not for his Mistress, yet he fought before his Mistress, from whom no
vizard could disguise him; neither desired he to be so disguised, but that she
should know him; wherefore enraged to see an apprentice so resist him, he
ramasses his courage, and by an irresistible blow, bears Ophni to the ground,
so bruised that he was scarce able to recruit himself; and thereafter rides to
the Judges, who deliver him both the Pictures.

Whilst all the eyes of the company are fixed upon Megistus, some enquiring
after his name; others admiring his courage; and none daring yet to appear
against him. The Kings Nephew vanquished by grief, as well as by the Martial
Knight, falls a swouning (shame contracting the heart, and denying the body a
fresh supply of spirits; as its opposite, confidence, dilatats it, and sends it
fresh supplies flushly) which withdraws ^ll men's admiration from Megistus, each
running to recover the other, giving Megistus leave to re^^re secretly to his
bed without being noticed.

The Tilting ended, Ophni retires to his chamber, distracted with rage, and
confounded with shame, trembling by the chilness of the one, and burning by the
heat of the other; cursing providence for the niggardly allowance of strength
it had bestowed upon him; and his own heart, for daring to engage in a quarrel
which it was not able to maintain. Yet Monanthropus and his Lady, who valued
not much such trifling affronts, did prosecute their former intention, but with
very bad success: for Aretina, who could never remember Philarites but with
affection, could never remember Ophni but with disdain: neither could her
affection taste any more satisfaction in his society, than a stomach which is
full already of excellent entertainment, is able to relish an ordinary dish
which is set before it. Which at last Ophni perceiving, he resolved to
undermine, what he could not storm, and plots this project.

Monanthropus had now retired to hsi own Country House, for a fortnight, where
Ophni goes to give him a visit, after that he had first hired a Pirat, who
frequented those coasts, to go and lie before the house secretly. At his coming
there he deals with Aretina's Nurse (whom only of all her servants his bribes,
and her Mothers commands, had gained to his faction) to tryste Aretina down to
the shore one morning very early, where she was no sooner come, than the Pirat
who waited behind a rock with fourteen men, falls upon her, and her Nurse, and
Maids, and makes them prisoners; which Ophni at some distance perceiving, comes
running to them, with his sword drawn, as if he would have rescued her, and
begins to combat with the Pirat, whereupon he who held Aretina, holding a sword
to her breast, swore that he should kill her, if he yielded not: This seemed so
to prevail with him (joined to the cries of her hellish Nurse, who knew all the
mystery) that he submits, and becomes their prisoner, and are all carried a
shipboard, Aretina's Maid only excepted; whom Ophni had ordered, that she
should be suffered to escape, both fearing that she favored too much
Philarites, as also, that she might inform Monanthropus, that Ophni was not
accessory to the plot, but rather testified much courage in fighting, and much
affection in rather yielding, than that she should have suffered by his
resistance. At their entry a shipboard, the Pirat testified very much respect
to Aretina, protesting that he had no design in her surprisal, but only to
oblige her father thereby to mediate his peace with the King: For which reason
likewise, he thought himself most fortunate, in having intrapped Ophni, whose
friends at Court might be very stedable to him: wherefore he permitted them for
their mutual solacement to stay all day long in one cabine, allowing each of
them a several cabine at night. But all these opportunities, albeit seconded
with much importunity, both from Ophni, and the old Nurse, could not pull
Aretina's ear so low, as to hear what they pres^ed in relation to that match;
she seemed to undervalue those dangers, which would doubtless have seemed
terrible to others; For, as she said one day to the Master, high spirits were
like high mountains, whose tops being abvoe the cloudy firmament, were no ways
troubled with the storms and tempests which molest the valeyes; and that great
minds were like great bodies, which scarce the greatest winds could move out
of their places; these discourses astonished the ^yrate, and rendered Ophni yet
more desperate ^hen formerly; finding that neither fear nor love, necessity nor
affection, were able to effectuate his design; for when he spoke to her of his
passion, she told him that neither the present place, nor her present humor
could permit her to treat of such matters; which required calmness of spirit,
and the assistance of friends, of both which she was destitute at that present;
as also, that she was confident, the world would misconstruct that love, whose
birthplace was a prison; and would blame that choice, which was made when
there was none else present to be chosen.

These endeavors were unexpectedly blasted by an accident, which manifested
how much the divine powers affected that match, betwixt Philarites and Aretina,
which they themselves had at first made. For Aretina one morning, alleging
that she was indisposed, entreated the Pirate to set her ashore to take the
air, and the rather, because she heard that the coast whereupon they failed was
the coast of Thracia, where she knew her dear Philarites residenced for the
time. To which the Pirate, at the entreaty of Ophni, after some reluctance,
condescended, knowing that the adjacent Land was a mere Wood and Desert, where
no surprisal was to be feared; and suffered Ophni to go along with her, in
company with himself and twelve others of his train, well armed; and after they
had sent one to view the shore, who returned, assuring them that all was
secure: They came ashore themselves, and for their recreation went up to a
pleasant Wood, where the thickness of the trees afforded them a pleasant shade.
They were but immediately seated, when the clashing of armor near the shore,
invited their curiosity to try who were the combatants, and so starting up,
they perceived two Knights, disputing with equal courage, a quarrel wherein
their fury made Ophni believe that they were much interessed. Ophni who never
used to be an idle spectator of such disputes, girding himself in the Pirates
armor, after he had past his parole to return a shipboard (lest else his
complot with the Pirate might have been discovered) he runs down to them,
offering to be umpire betwixt them: But they were so busied with their contest,
that they had neither time, nor desire to embrace or thank him for his proffer.
At last the Knight with the black feathers called to the other, to leave off
their groundless combat, assuring him, that Aretina was the only Lady living,
for whom he carried any affection; and that albeit he had spared to strike at
him hitherto, endeavoring only his own defense, yet hereafter he was to expect
no further favor: and as to Arethusa he disclaimed any interest in her,
besides what all others of her sex and endowments might justly challenge. The
other (who because of his mask) was only to be designed by his bucquet of white
and red feathers, throwing immediately down his sword, lighted from his horse,
and craved the other pardon; protesting, that next to Arethusa, he would honor
him above all the world. Whilst they are thus embracing one another, Ophni who
raged to hear Aretina owned by any besides himself, cries, Sir, whatever you
are who wears the black feathers, you must satisfy justice for daring pretend
to Aretinas favor, and before ye depart from this place, my sword shall punish
such unpardonable arrogance, and with that drawing upon him, he forced the
Knight with the black feathers to depute his sword to answer for him, and in
sharper terms than Ophni expected; for at the second blow, Ophni's armor
suffered the black feathered Knights sword to enter at a breach, which his
strength had made for it, near the heart, out of which, in a very short time
the life issued out, waited upon by a flood of blood, running away, as it
seemed, from the merciless hand of pale death. The Pirat and his attenders
perceiving Ophni engaged, had hitherto kept back, fearing to rob him by their
assistance, of a victory which might possibly endear him to Aretina, but now
seeing him fall at his enemies feet, did run down to revenge a death, which
with so much grief they resented: the two Knights did jointly encounter them
with so much courage and resolution, that four of these Pirates were killed
before either of the Knights had received one wound, and whilst the Knight with
the black feathers was dispatching another, two Gentlemen who missing their
Master the black Knight in the morning, had traced him thither, came galloping
up, one whereof struck the head from a fellow who was drawing a blow to strike
his Master. The other Knight likewise had by killing the master Pirat,
persuaded the other two to flee to their boat; but they were easily overtaken
by these two Gentlemen, who were on hors-back, from whom they begged their
lives upon their knees, which was granted them, and so they were brought back
to the two Knights; the one whereof, and who wore the black feathers, was the
generous Philarites, who stood disarming Ophni, whose headpiece he no sooner
took off, than he knew him to be his intimate friend the Duke of Iris, to whose
civilities he had been so much addebted during his residence at the Court of
Egypt: it astonished him to see the Duke in that place, and it grieved him to
consider that his sword should have put him in that condition: and albeit he
remembered how the quarrel was for Aretina, yet friendship provoked him to a
compassionat resentment, and to deck the mournful hearse of the Duke of Iris
with pearly tears; albeit he could not but hate the lover of Aretina: But
whilst Philarites eyes were writing in tears Ophni's epitaph, Aretina (whom her
two keepers had abandoned) not knowing who these Knights were, had flung her
self at his feet; but no sooner raised she her eyes, nor threw he down his, but
the rays which were darted from either, seemed to know one another at their
first approach, and posted as it were back to acquaint the body from whom they
were sent, what a strange encounter they had met with. Philarites no sooner
perceived that this was the divine Aretina, than presently raising her with
both his hands, he throws himself at her feet, who was lying at his formerly,
and with an accent which spoke passion, he thus expresses himself. Peerless
Aretina, it is a crime to doubt who thou art, seeing none resembles thee; or,
how can he forget thee, who minds nothing besides thee? for the meanest of
those hundred curious traits (which are but mean when compared with what we see
not) is able to convince the dullest amongst men, that ye are doubtless
Aretina; and the only thing which disswades me from believing it, is, that my
destiny has been so hard formerly, that I can hardly now believe that it would
permit Aretina to land in a place where Philarites might be serviceable to her.
Here Aretina interrupted him, saying, That he was injurious to the most and
ever just gods, in alleging that they favored not a person of his high
deserts; neither were his petty afflictions to be listed amongst real
misfortunes: for as the earths offspring is ripened by the cold and dark
nights, as well as by the hot and bright Sunshines; even so, generous minds are
accomplished oft-times as much (if not more) by their misfortunes, as well as by
their success: wherefore use moderatly this occasion, which ye seem so to value,
and lose not by your insolence that affection in Thracia, which your modesty
and patience gained in Egypt.

After this, she entreated him to lead her to some retired house, where she
might recreate her weather-beaten body; which sickness formerly, and joy now
both had, and did infeeble extremely; for our life being a lamp, it cannot no
more be said to burn well, when by the nimious heat of joy it is all on a fire;
then when cold melancholy seems to extinguish its flames. By this time the
other Knight, who was the renowned Aristobulus had come up, and after his
surprisal (occasioned by the extraordinariness of Aretina's beauty) was
somewhat over-past, he accoasted her thus. Madam, I hope ye will pardon me for
calling in question what you are; for my heart, as a subject to the divine
Arethusa, has taken oaths of supremacy and alleagiance, whereby it is bound to
acknowledge none her equal, either in beauty or endowments; wherefore, Madam, I
wish ye were no mortal, lest your being such should tempt me to commit treason
against her beauty, by forcing me to acknowledge that it is but second to
yours. Arethusa's beauty (replied Aretina) is so much noted and admired by all
who have but heard the smallest catalogue of beauties recited, that it is rather
a jest than a complement, to place such an ordinary face as mine in one file
with hers, to whom it were a disparagement, to say that my face and hers had
any traits that were common to both; the one having nothing, and the other
wanting nothing, which the proudest amongst men can esteem praiseworthy. After
this they retired to an house of pleasure, which Philarites father had caused
build for himself, whilst he was young; and which Philarites self had caused
repair and replenish, wherein he did often solace himself with the rememberance
of her whom he now enjoyed; after their arrival, Aretina fetched a short walk
about that sweet place; which lurked in the bosom of a wood, fearing (as it
were) to be discerned by any, upon the brink of a shallow river, to whose
bottom the weakest eye might easily travel; and whose streams mumured as they
past by, because they were not suffered to stay longer in so sweet a place; and
where the hand of accident, had carved in the surface of the over-topping
rocks, thousands of various shapes and figures, to recreate a melancholy fancy,
and which, like a stone book, seemed full of apprehensive memento's. Here
Philarites used often to read, as he imagined, the story of his love. Something
represented to him Aretina, something Agapeta, and something his kind friend
Megistus. At other times he thought them emblems of his love, and at a third
time, he thought them horoscopes of his good or ill fortune, accordingly as he
himself was for the time affected. After this they entered a chamber, wherein
pleasure had made parade of all her richest furnitur, and here, whilst the
supper was a preparing, and Arist^bulus was gone to sleep after his long
watching, occasioned by his torturing jealousy; Aretina leaning upon a window
(in at which the vine and orange trees seemed to peep, as if they desired to
admire the sumptuousness of the room) entreated to hear a brief relation of his
adventures since his departure from Egypt.

Madam (replied Philarites) my journey was rather pleasant than memorable: for
after that a gentle gale had civilly convoyed me over to Lacedemon, as if I had
been related to Neptunes family. I landed at ^pis, where I did meet a great
many officious servants, some whereof carried my boots, and others my spurrs,
and I believe some were so willing to testify their respects to me, that they
would have carried my purse also, if I would have suffered them: At supper my
Landlord came to taste my wine, and alleging it was not good enough, desired
the Drawer to fetch some out of another tun, which liked him not neither,
wherefore he desired (after he had chided him) that he should bring some of
another color; but finding that my servant grumbled (which was really to see
so much wine forced upon us by a cheat) he rose himself from the table, and as
if my servant had been offended at the badnesse of the wine, he said that he
himself should go fetch some better, and albeit my servant entreated him to
stay, telling him that he was mistaken, yet he would needs go, craving us still
pardon for his Drawers mistake: so down he goes, and brings up that same wine
which had been presented to us formerly in a flaggon, and fearing lest my
servant should discern that it was but little more than half full, he did out
of civility to my Lordship, fill it himself; and pouring it in a glass,
colored somewhat like the wine, to conceal its sophistication, he holds it up
to the candle, sweating that it was a lovely wine, but that it had ripened no
where so well that year as it did the last. His discourse all the time of
supper, was in praise of the Egyptian Nobility, whose generosity and liberality
he commended much, without mentioning any other virtue. After supper, he caused
remove my clogbag out of my servants chamber (as my servant told me afterward)
telling the Chamberlain, that albeit he served a Nobleman, yet he knew by his
looks and deportment, that he was a Gentleman, and so it was not fit so to
embarass his chamber; but to morrow he made us pay for that chamber also,
alleging that if it had been void, he might have had a guest for it, but if
that occasion had not offered, we should not have paid for it. Thereafter when
I asked why there were so many cheaters in that Town? they told me, that all
frontier Towns were so: for being accustomed with strangers, whom they prefumed
ignorant of all prices, they extortioned them at their pleasure.

The next morning I took horse, and having dined at Elpis, I strayed in the
afternoon, and could find no house, till at last the dark clouds clad in the
nights livery, did usher their melancholy mistress into our hemisphere, and told
me, that after that darkness did set its guard, strangers were not permitted
to pass. Wherefore I retired to a castle, which I saw afar off; and by the
time I came to it, the charitable heaven had set forth its lanthorn the Moon to
show passengers the road: and as I entered at the gate, I saw a poor fellow
helping an old bridle at the moonshine: My servant thinking it had been the
hostler, called to him to hold the horses: but at last came one of the
servants, who hanging out the sign of a, Please your Worship to that poor
fellow, gave us to understand that he was a Knight, he advances to us, and told
us that we were out of the road; for Thesbone the next Village was but two
leagues off, where we would be very well accommodated; but Kalodulus assured me
that it was three, and entreated me to stay: wherefore I at last perceiving
that this was the Master of the house (who stood helping his bridle at the
Moonshine to save a candle) I told him, that I behoved to stay that night. This
made him reply, that he could not accommodate me, for all his furniture was
transported to his other house. At this reply, his son who was an idiot, cried
out, Ha, ha, father, devil another house have ye. This put the father out of
countenance, but he desired us not to notice what he said. At last, overcome by
our importunity, he rather suffered than invited us to advance, and welcomed us
as an old miser welcomes death, when the Physician assures him that he cannot
live: but all the sport was, to see with what a troubled countenance, the Lady
was brought to bed of a consent to let us stay; mere necessity supplying the
part of a Midwife to that hard and painful birth. After we entered the house
(which seemed because of the infrequency of the indwellers, like a body without
a (...)) the Knight with a discourse of the poverty of the Nation, and of the
greatness of the taxes, joining to this, that large houses, such as his, were
monuments of the builders folly; for besides the money spent both in building
and maintaining them, they did likewise invite strangers to lodge, and enemies
to garrison in it. Whilst we were thus passing time, I heard my Lady scold at
her servant, for suffering all the beer to run out, by pulling the spigget out
of the barrel, and thereupon coming in to us in a chafe, she ex^used her own
misfortune; but she told us that we should have a drink of whey, which was very
wholesome in that hot season; as also, we should have sack to correct its
coldness: so the sack is brought in a great bottle, and all is filled out in a
big glass, and given to the Lady, who drinks to me, but when I entreated her
to taste it a little better, she told me, that albeit that sack was not hot in
the mouth, yet it was very hot in the stomach, and that the Physicians had
forbidden her husband to drink any more than two spoonfulls of it; but I no
sooner got it in my hand, than I drank it off: foreseeing that I was in a
place, where all the year was a continued Lent, wherefore I resolved to make
drink aliment, albeit Philosophers and Physicians both call that much in
question. At supper we had some pulse, eggs, and pease, but no flesh; for, as
the Lady said, she could hardly in conscience suffer a poor pullet to be
murdered to satisfy her appetite. Truly wife, added her husband, that is good
philosophy; for flesh is not thought natural food for man: for we see that
children (in whom nature is not adulterated by custom) love fruit better than
flesh; as also, if it were natural, we might eat it as nature has provided it;
but now we see that we roast, sees, and fry it, else it cannot be eaten: as
also, nature has bestowed long and small teeth upon those beasts, and long
beaks upon those fowls, which most devour flesh for their aliment; whereas it
has given man teeth long and broad. Physicians also esteem it not so wholesome
as other meats are, for it being before concoction, equal to our flesh, it is
by concoction sublimated above it, and so not fit to feed us: and we find that
when it corrupts (for all of it cannot become aliment) that it is of all
putrefactions the most hateful; for bread, roots, and such like things, albeit
they putrify, yet stink not; but flesh, when corrupted, stinks extremely.
After supper, we went to bed, without having any drink put in our offer, to
excuse which, the Knight alleged, that he heard that it was the custom of our
Country, for the Egyptians used to say by way of proverb, that he who goes to
bed thirsty, rises wholesome; for thereby defluxions were occasioned. The next
morning the Knight appeared in an old satin doublet, having a little piece
taffata hanging down from it, to persuade us that it was lined with it, but I
perceived that it was only doubled with green linen. He wore likewise silk
stockens, but exceedingly shattered by age, to conceal which he had folded them
all in degrees. After I rose, I went to the Garden, where my Lady was gathering
nettles to make broth for us; I perceived she wanted her stockens and shoes,
which she thought was concealed by the length of her gown; whereupon (to
revenge my self upon her for my bad entertainment) I took her hand and walked
along a place with her full of nettles, which, as I perceived by her
countenance, did burn her feet; yet durst she not complain, fearing to discover
thereby her own nakedness. After my departure from this, my stomach had almost
expired, leaving me nothing but hunger in legacy; a debt so urgent, that I
behoved to ride to a neighboring Village to satisfy it: but whilst I was in
my way to it, the angry heavens, sighed wind, and weeped rain for the suns
absence, which some troubled clouds had imprisoned all that morning; I
over-hyed a fellow, whose gray hairs, rather than grave garb, informed me that
he was ancient; he was riding in a pair of Spanish leather boots, which the
excessive rain had mollified so, that they seemed to become tenderhearted at
the heavens weeping condition; his head had been well poudered, and by the
rains assistance had made excellent mortar; yet all the mortar which was there,
could hardly have patched up those cracks which I perceived thereafter to be in
his brain: His cassock was of black satin, which was so hospital as not to
refuse the rain lodging; thus he rode and bathed all at once. After we had
ridden half a mile together, he asked if I had ever heard of a Physician called
Nisus, who lived in that Country, whose skill had kept so many alive, that the
inhabitants complained that the place was become too populous. I who perceived,
or at least conjectured by his habit, that he was of that faculty himself, told
him that I had often heard of him; and that it was reported that he could defend
the weakest body against the strongest assaults of death, and that he could
chase out deaths ordinary avantcurriers, melancholy and sickness, albeit they
were once entered; and that the great-grand-children of ancient families had
conspired against him, for starving so their wearied expectations, for none
dyed (as I heard, except some few Sextons, whom want of employment had quite
famished; Truly (continued I) I would ride forty miles to see him. Good Sir,
replied my companion, ye extoled him too much; but such as he is, Sir, he is
your servant, for I am the man: At which I seemed so overjoyed, that grasping
him kindly (though rudely) in my arms, I pulled him quite from his horse; and
thereafter, craving him pardon, I helped him up again. After a miles march, his
horse did begin to weary, and at last became so uncivil, as to refuse to bear
his master company; whereupon the Doctor lights down, and taking up his foot,
he endeavors to find his pulse, which he swore was a caprezant, and that he
behoved to cause give him a clyster; but (ah misfortune) whilst he is musing
upon the disease, the horse, weary of standing upon three feet, kicks his
Lordship into a ditch which stood near by, whence we could hardly pull out:
when we had pulled him out, Kalodulus says to him, Truly, Sir, it appears ye
dive deep in any thing wherein ye once enter; but I admire why ye carry with
you such a horse, except it be that because ye are a Physician, ye cannot want
a skelleton for your anatomy. After he was re-mounted, he entertained me with a
description of a Lady in Nisbena, whom he loved dearly, describing all the
parts of her body, as if he had been anatomizing; and to conclude all, he took
a Letter out of his pocket, which he had directed to her, and whereof he
bestowed upon me this copy afterward.

Fairest of all created creatures, yea, fairer than Diana and all her Nymphs,
albeit they were chopped in one; the harmony of your well-agreeing colors, makes
my pulses dance to their music; and your beauty, like a great gale, has so
filled the sails of my desires, that it has driven me out of the harbor of
ease, into the ocean of Love. A surfeit of your disdain, has (as all cold
things do) easten me in a fever of rage: your Answer to this Letter must be
the crisis, by which I am to prognostic my death, or recovery; But I hope,
Lady, that ye will not murder him, who has saved so many, and who has been
born to s^ve mankind. Ye may perceive the strength of my love, which makes me
so eloquent that I (...) Mercury if he were a woman; And albeit ye undervalue
my plethorick eloquence, yet all our Ladies here are struck by it in a
le^ha^gie of admiration. O my pret^y lovely thing, love him who loves thee best
of all things, and send a receipt for this disease to your sick Nilus.

We arrived that night at Lacedemon, where at supper I did meet a young
Gentleman, whose grave asp^ct did conc^l^at respect to what he was to speak;
after supper I invited him to my chamber, and there I did enqui^e how affairs
biased in that Nation, and who was the Axletr^e upon whom that large orb of
Court did roll; after this we digressed from Courtiers, to Court-imployments,
whereupon he thus charactered to me the emptiness of that so much desired trade.

Sir, my experience has pilgrimaged through most, and my meditation through
all those follies wherewith our reason is ensnared, and whereby our happiness is
betrayed; yet amongst them all I perceive that none has gained so many
proselytes, as Court-vanity: There it is that men run to ruin in Coach, and
flee with feathers to folly; and I am confident, that if men took as much pains
to gain favor in Heaven, as they do ^o ingratiat themselves at Court, that
they could no^ miss to be canonized as the most eminent in the Calendar of
Saints. That is the Butt at which all men level the arrows of their affections,
and that is the Idol which all men worship. Wherefore, Sir, at my first arrival
at Court, I endeavored to find out the reason why in the circle of humane
happiness, Court was made the only center, to which all the other pleasures,
like so many lines, tended, and in which they were all terminated; but I must
acknowledge, Sir, that without borrowing the eyes of those who so much admire
it, I shall never be able to see in it that satisfaction and amiableness, which
they so much dote upon: But to make your judgment judge, I shall relate to you
the trade which I conceive most of them drives. All night they wrestle with
their giant, fears and cares, til at last, necessary, with much difficul^y,
draws the curtain of rather slumber than sleep before their wearied eyes: but
yet their judgment no sooner leaves off, than their fancy begins to work; and
as they thought whilst awake, so now whilst asleep they dream of competitors,
and enemies; of mis-informations, and challenges; and after some time their eye
lids start up in spite of sleep, and then their minds are presented afresh
with a large inventory of by-pastaffronts, and future fears, all written with
the black ink of disquietness. And thus they toss and tumble, where a poor
Countryman would find much refreshment; sometimes upon one side, sometimes
upon another, their souls (which only in this, are masters of, and command
their bodies) drawing the bodies after them, and making them toss and turn, as
they are tossed themselves. After that the Sun has sent its rays to salute
them in its name, then they must sleep, because sleep is then unnatural: the
morning being thus spent, they spend (or rather mispend) the forenoon, betwixt
a comb and a mirror, consulting now and then their pages, whether they be well
dressed or not. And now they ask whether the King be gone a hunting, or not? (his
motion being the only science which they study) and if not, they post to Court,
putting that complement upon his Majesty, that for haste to wait upon him,
they dispense with their matines. And there, like Democritus atoms, they
wander up and down in the sphere of chance, and possibly stand in some
antichamber, like those pictures which the cunning needle has depenciled in
the curious hangings; meditating upon nothing but how to make some Grandee take
notice of them, or how to pay an earth-deep reverence to any whom they know to
be a Court-darling. At dinner they surfeit one day, and are starved another,
their purses being like the damme of an ill-going Mill, which must be clused up
two days to make it go the third; there, if they meet with any Country
Gentleman, they tax him for being unfashionable in his clothes, and rural in
his deportment, thinking thereby to disarm him of his confidence, that
thereafter they may foil him at pleasure. And really, Sir, I perceive that they
mould their fashions and modes of new every year, not so much to pleasure their
vagrant fancies, as to make Courtship an Art which one must be always
learning: For, if these stood always fixed upon the same center, a Gentleman
who had spent a year at Court, and then had retired to the sweet bosom of a
melancholy life, might know as much as they, but now they in this, (and in this
only) must learn something from the nothing-besides-knowing Courtier. This
done, they proceed to discourse of affairs of State, dropping a word or two of
some mysterious foreign transaction, and stopping there, as if they would not
decipher so great a project; and shake their head, as if they could prognostic
the event, of that whereof they know not the cause. Wherefore, Sir, I will
recount to you a jest, put lately at this Court upon one of these
State-mountebanks, by a Country-Gentleman, who coming one morning to visit the
Courtier, he asks what news? none, says the Gentleman, save only that
Thrastus, one of the Thracian Nobles, is dead; which they say is an irreparable
loss to our King. Thrastus dead, replied the other, the gods forbid, for he
was one of our intimate friends, and with that he fetches a turn or two,
folding his hands, and testifying much grief; whereupon the Gentleman turning to
one of the bystanders, tells him in his ear, with a smile, that in conscience
he never heard of any such person: After dinner is ended, they return to Court,
carrying along with them their Country friends, and in their way salutes
hundreds of persons, whom they scarce know, pretending that these are their
special good acquaintances: And if the King smile (though his smile be
occasioned by some inward thought) they will swear it was upon them; or if he
call them, though merely by accident, and desire them to do any thing of the
meanest concernment, they will pretend that it was a w^ighty particular which
he did communicate to them. After this manner they mis-spend much of that
little time which providence has not given, but lent them; making their bodies
their souls, and their pleasures their paradise, till at last, after they have
acted the personage of youth in this comedy of Court, age dismantles them of
all those ornaments and perfections, which made them formerly be accounted
Gallants, and then they are turned off without any reward, besides the hateful
name of an old Courtier. Oh then happy he who impales himself within the
circuit of a Country Cottage, suffering his thoughts to travel all over the
large orb of the creation; and when they return loaded with the spoil of solid
knowledge, feasts them with homebred morality; there none compets with them,
neither are they oppressed by any, their time is not trifled away by idlings, nor
their humor violented by debauched persons; how much then are we obliged to
Court, which like a boil in the body politic, draws to it all those malignant
humors, which else might hugely annoy all the other members? But I admire what
pleasure can the Country be debarred from, whereof the Court participates; for,
whilst the species of all these soul-delighting pleasures, are in the eye, they
are no pleasures, (else brutes might t^ste that true sweetness) and when they
are from the eye conv^yed to the inward faculties; then they differ nothing
from pleasures merely imagined; so that a Countryman, may under the shade of
some great Oak, or upon the bri^k of some murmuring River, taste as much
pleasure, in envisaging or viewing his own contemplated happiness, as a
Courtier can in eying the real objects of Court delights. There are some who
(like the Whales) never leave the Ocean of pleasure and public employments,
till they be wounded by the darts of affronts, or coffeehouse; and then they
run ashore upon a private life, but, like ships beat into a harbor, stay no
longer there than the boistering storms arrests them in it. These are not the
true disciples of sacred prudence, else the same experience which sent them
thither, would retain them in it, and their life and their resolution, should
have the same period.

Philarites was interrupted here by a Troop of Gentlemen, all masked, who
entering the Hall, made such a noise, that Philarites was thereby invited to
visit these unacquainted guests; but no sooner did they see him, than rushing
on him, they advertised him, that he was their prisoner, and thereafter
carrying Aretina along with them, together with Aristobulus, whom they found
asleep, they march down to the shore, whence by their shallops they were
carried a shipboard.

FINIS.
Here is continued the History of ARETINA, which was too abruptly ended in the
former page.
THe Sun seemed to decline, that he might bath his scorching, and scorched
beams in the cool Ocean: And Hespe^us was beginning to rendesvouze his
sparkling Spangles, in the azure Heavens: When these incomparable prisoners,
Philarites, Aretina and Aristobulus were brought aboard of that Pirat-Ship: The
melancholy Aretina had nothing to consolat her in her disconsolat captivity,
except the presence of her dear Philarites, whose danger notwithstanding did
imperfectionat extremely the sweetness of his presence, which jealousy was
transubstantiat in despair by the Captains placing each of them in distinct
Cabines, leaving only melancholy for their attender, and a keeper for their
train. Aretina had scarce envisaged their Avantcurriers of fear, and breathed
up her first sighs: When the Captain entering her Cabin, entreated her to come
forth to observe something that was very remarkable; Aretina knowing that it
was folly to disobey the entreaties of these who may at pleasure command,
obeyed (...): But alas, poor Lady! No sooner did the (...) forty Torches,
handed up by as many (...) Soldiers, discover to her tearbe-dimed eyes the
Deck of their Ship, then with it, it discovered likewise to her, fettered
Philarites, who expected patiently the bitterest insults of his enemies rage.
Aretina starting back, had almost deluged her soul in tears, and evaporated her
life in sighs, had not Philarites by this discourse arested that inundating
passion.

Madam, (said he) Albeit Death be the greatest of changes, yet shall it never
be able to change the greatness of my affection to you; neither is there any
thing in this the archest of terrors, which afflicts me besides the thoughts
of leaving your favors unrequired, and your person unguarded, yet, Madam, I
hope that the unexpectedness of this fatality, will pardon the first, and that
the Omnipotent Justice of the never good relinquishing Gods, who have
arsenalled thousands of thunder bolts in the clouds, to execute their just
commands, will never suffer the last to be oppressed: for, albeit some
complementary Athiests, thinks it a disparagement to the Al-disposing Dieties,
to eye and predecree the meanest of actions, yet it were a great ebness of
faith, to believe that they would relinquish a person, for whose satisfaction,
and to celebrate whose praises all the rest of the world seems (next to that of
the immortal Gods) to have only been created: but should I fear misfortunes,
seeing, ye (Divine Princess) can by bedewing my Hearse with one tear, make me
accomplishedly happy. And seeing I die regrateing my separation from you, let me
die regrated by you, and erect for me a monument in your precious remembrance.

This discourse had almost entranced the passionately compassionate Aretina,
when her father Monanthropus (who had all this time been an undiscovered
witness to what had past) touched with the affliction of his daughter, and
sufficiently convinced of her affection to Philarites, which he could never
formerly believe; issued out, and embracing her, entreated her not to fear the
event of a fatherly experiment. Megistus did at the same time unvizard his
face, and running to Philarites, hugged him in his arms. Whilst one of the
Soldiers did unty him, immediately thereafter they entered the Cabine; and
having shut the door, Monanthropus relates to them (whilst they were yet
astonished with amazement) how that Megistus had ploted that supprisall, to
convince him of the mutual affection that they carried to each other; and
thereafter turning him to Philarites, he assured him that he esteemed his
daughter happy, in being noticed, and much more in being loved by a person of
such eminent qualities, but that he was sorry that he was able to bestow no
better requital upon him; to whose valor he owed first his life, and next the
rescue of his daughter, who only made his life and estate desirable to him.
Philarites interrupted him here, with this reply, Sir, albeit I had as really
engaged by my services the immortal Gods, as ye in complement acknowledge that
I have engaged you, yet could not the treasure of their unexhaustible
al-sufficiencie, remunerat me with any thing more acceptable then Aretina; So
that, Sir, if you will Authorize my pretentions to serve her, you shall thereby
put me above the power of desiring any new addition to my present happiness, to
whose hight, fate shall not be able to add the least measure. After this,
imbraceing Megistus, the Gods (said he) fearing that man who places all virtue
in advantage, would never put a true estimate upon friendship, if it were not
seconded by real advantages, do often afford friends occasions of succouring
each other in their mutual extreamities; neither have I time, nor you modesty,
to hear me catalogue your favors, which I shall always esteem as such, as
that none but you could bestow them; and as often as my pulse beats minutes, my
heart shall coin thankful resentments of them.

Thus did these overjoyed lovers, and generous friends, both admire, and
congratulate each others happiness; thanking fate for her complacency, in
leaving them nothing to seek now, but the continuation of what she had bestowed
already, and unbridling their own passions with an indicible satisfaction, yet
such a satisfaction, as that albeit it was complete for the present, did
notwithstanding receive a new accomplishment from the apprehension of the
future; and albeit love possess't intirly all the corners of their breast; yet
were they repleat with friendship like a tunn, which albeit it be full of burnt
coals, will never the less hold its just measure of water. Neither did the
intensness of their friendship, cool, in the least, the heat of their love, but
both like two hands, did by their mutual heat excite mutual order in each other.

Philarites glad to have these Nobles in a place which he was born to command,
entreated they would do him the honor to go ashore, to recreat their
incommodat bodies, against whom the sea, and season had used so much rigor. And
to this they presently condiscended, and went ashore at that same place from
which they were carried; but whilst they were walking through the forest,
which verged upon the ocean, the clashing of armor not far from the beaten
path, did awak the courage of the three generous Knights, and importuned them
to ride hitherwards: at their arrival upon the place, they perceived a
Gentleman, whose armor was windowed with breaches, and whose blood was
removing from its shattered lodging; beside him lay two of his servants slain;
against him fought only one, who, to their admiration, was covered with
Philarites armor, which the bearers sword (seconded by much skill) had so well
defended, as that they had as yet suffered but little in the quarrel; they were
scarce advanced his length, when he had disarmed his adversary to whom he thus
spoke.

Sir, these who fight without a quarrel, fight often without success; neither are
the Gods so idle spectators of humane actions, as to suffer courage to be the
sole arbiter of such conflicts: your civil inquiry might have probably gained
you a friend, whereas your rudeness has lost you your sword, and your want of
discretion, has put you now upon the discretion of your enemy. Noble Sir,
(replied the other) your armor occasioned both my inconsideratness, and my
mistake; for they induced me to believe that you were Philarites, against whom
my revenge was only levelled. You are not much mistaken in this quarrel,
answered the other, albeit ye be mistaken in the person; for our quarrel shall
still be one, though our persons be different. Upon this, Philarites presently
started out, and calling aloud to him who was the conqueror, hold, Noble Sir,
(said he) least ye pluck from that Philarites, for whom ye pretend so much
friendship; the occasion of punishing one of his own disloyal subjects, who
breaths by his clemency, that life which he would so willingly hazard against
him; he show him formerly by continuing his life, how little he feared his
malice, and now by condiscending to fight him, he will evidence how little he
dreads his courage. This discourse surprised both the vanquished, and
vanquisher; but Megistus and Philarites were as much surprised, as either of
the other two; when he who had spoken so affectionately by throwing off his
cask, show them the face of the Martial Knight; who having come to Thracia in
pursuit of the Pyrate, and for the defense of Aretina, had accidentally fallen
upon the beforementioned house of pleasure, which because he had lost his own
armor, he had taken along with him that morning, and because of them had
been pursued by this Gentleman, whom he had now disarmed, who was Osiris,
general of that rebellious Army which opposed the interest of their native
Prince: The King of Thracia, after these three old and intimate acquaintances
had witnessed to each other their kind resentments of former favors. Osiris
ashamed of his ingratitude, and fearing punishment, humbled himself upon his
knees before Philarites, and made him this confession. Generous Prince, albeit
the immense number, and unpardonable qualities of my crimes, might detract from
the truth of what I am to say, yet believe, Sir, that my conscience sick now
with repentance, will freely vomit up these noxious humors by which it was
formerly so much distempered: It is not, Sir, that I intend to buy with this
confession the continuance of my life, which because it is so spotted with
errors, will be persecuted by legions of divine punishments; I rather abhor
then desire it, no Sir, it is the sense of duty, presented to my Judgment by a
dying temper, which wrings it from me, wherefore, Sir, I shall unbury to you a
mystery, wherein your repose is much interessed; and by which, if I cannot wipe
off my former rogueries; yet at least, I shall evite the Commission of new
crimes. Sir, many of your Nobles (of whom I shall deliver you a particular
list) have combined amongst themselves, to levy an Army, hoping that I should
have, according to my undertaking, either killed you privately, or have brought
you to them as a prisoner, in order to this design.

I have waited at yonr house of pleasure till this morning, at which time,
perceiving this Gentleman in your Armor; I followed him expecting to have had
you at my devotion, but providence, whose decrees are unrepealable, has
ordered it otherwise. Our rendesvouze is to be six days hence, so that, Sir,
ye may prevent the disorders which we have projected.

Aristobulus had all this time darted such looks at the Martial Knight, as
evidenced sufficiently his rage against him; but at last, when that impostume
of rage broke, it blustered forth this envennomed matter,

Base Menaleon, dares fate declair war against the immortal Gods, by
shouldering up an Interest, which is so much their enemy: and shall the feet
of thy cowardishness, be still so swift as to carry thee away from their and my
just revenge: no, no, thou must resolve to quite that Life, which thy want of
Courage endeares to thee above thy Repute; and I will rather resolve to pudle
my Sword in the blood of a Traitor, then suffer thy Treason to remain
unpunished.

The Martial Knight convinced that Philarites and Megistus knew his courage;
resolved to show them his patience, and so returned this answer.

My innocence (Aristobulus) needed not the patronage of my Sword; if ye had as
much patience, as I have courage; yet seeing ye will choose no other Umpires,
but our Swords. Assure your self, that my courage is not so fast a sleep, as
that it needs such clamorous opprobries to awake it: nor is my Sword so fixed in
its Sheath, as that it needs such shrewd pulls to pluck it out. Come, come,
experiment that Gallantrie which ye so call in question; and receive a just
punishment from him, who was once willing to pardon your escapes.

They were brisling up their despite, ready to exchange their noble Lives:
when Philarites (whose common Friendship to both made him an Enemy to both
their. resolutions) lodged Aristobulus in his arms; entreating Megistus to
keep fast the Martial Knight, Aristobulus screwing himself out of Philarites
embraces, and finding that his revenge behoved to be differred till another
occasion: bolted away, leaving the Martial Knight this adieu. Dregg thy
worthless Life, through these disasters, which the just Gods are preparing for
thee; and live fears Martyr, till occasion suffers thee to relaps within my
power. Philarites rode after him, hoping to reconcile them, but all in vain,
for Aristobulus horse carried him away.

Philarites was because of this discourse, and at the intercession of the
Martial Knight, induced to pardon Osiris; and returning to Monanthropus, and
Aretina, (who were much satisfied with the sight of the Martial Knight) it was
resolved, that Osiris should be left at the house of pleasure, both as an
hostage of what he had promised, as also to ease him because of his desperate
wounds. And that Philarites should endeavor before the six days were expired
to ensure the Bonte-sense of that irreconcilable faction.

Affairs thus ordered, Philarites entreats them to go along with him to
visit the sweetest Hermitage in the World; wherein they might see a Gentleman,
who being a stranger, entreated my Father (said he) to gratify him with some
retired valley, wherein he might cloister up himself for the residue of his
Life; whereupon this valley was given him, in which he has at his own expense
built a House, Orchard and Garden: which the Universe cannot equal; here has
he lived these fifteen years by past, tutured by the rigidest austeritie,
humane nature is able to endure; by this time they were advanced as far as the
avenues of the house, where, betwixt two files of well ranged trees, coasting
upon the water, they perceived a Gentleman, walking the pace of a funeral;
followed by two pages in a mourning liverie; his face mantled with Melancholy,
resembled a rich cloth of Gold, concealed under a black Tirfanie, where the
coruscant splendour did but scarsly p^ep out. His cheeks stood like empty
palaces, where those noble Guests, Beauty, and Vivacitie, had lodged formerly;
and his whole body resembled an house of pleasure, appropriated to be a
Charnell house. They no sooner perceived him, than they lighted down, and after
the first Salutes, Megistus thus bespoke him.

Sir, it is not to divert, but to divertise you, that we come to profer you our
attendance; wherefore if ye apprehend, that our Society suits evil, either with
your leisure, or pleasure, We beg that ye would congediate us instantly.

Gentlemen, (replied the Melancholy knight) ye may easily perceive, that my
hard destiny has placed Melancholies all destroying Sword, at the door of
joys Paradise, to forbid me a free entry: and albeit it change the kinds of
my torture, yet it never changes the desire, and design it has to torture me.
Yet Company is a torture which seems more unsupportable to me than any other;
because I am sensible, that others there suffer with me; ye are now in a
place, wherein ye can observe nothing that is worthy, besides the unvaluable
worth of him who bestowed the use of the place upon me.

This pleasant valley, which was mantled with a pleasantly pyled grass, was
Garlanded every where by nature, with curious flowers; in its middle did run a
sweet river, which by its frequent windings, show how unwilling it was to leave
so sweet a valley; one of its bancks was twifed with Orange, Figg, and other
pleasant trees. Whose fruit hang down, as if they seemed desirous to fall in
the lap of their Grandmother the Earth. From this, they went in to a well
proportioned Chapel, whose floor being white Marble, was indented in the
middle with many Deaths, Heads, don couriously in black. It was hung round with
dead men's Skuls, in each whereof stood a great waxe-taper, which brunt
continually, from the middle of the roof did hing a hearse of cipress, all
decked with faded flowers, under it stood the statue of a young Lady, in white
Marble likewise, wherein the artist had been so happy, as that it seemed twains
with her whom it represented; at the one end was placed an Altar, all in black
Velvet (with which all the room was Tapistred) all spangled with worms, tears,
and bleeding hearts wrought in golden Embroidery. It was then the hour, wherein
he used to celebrate the obsequies of his dead Lady: wherefore he entreated
Aretina, and the other Knights to share with him in his devotions, which when
they had yielded to, there entered two Gentlewomen in deep mourning, with two
Lutes; who were consorted in their singing by two Priests; all choice voices,
the Organ likewise helped them to tremble out these lugubrious Lines;

Since she is gone, why stay I here?
Seeing we were one, and she my dear,
My halfless Soul must sure be lame;
This bell does tole, that it may blame
My leaden motion to that sacred place,
Where with devotion, I her raying face
May still admire, with eyes voided of sorrow,
From whom the Sun so clear, yet further light might borrow.
But sure, the Gods will not admit that I,
Should so near sit to such a dietie.
Let her then live, whilst sadned I,
Must ever grive, and never dye.
He had all this time kneeled before her Statue, and prosused so his tears, as
that he seemed to wash the place whereon her Statue stood. Devotions ended,
they dined; and after dinner he conducted them to a Park, where under stately
Oaks, and tale Firres, did run a great many Dear, whose heads were so well
branched, that they seemed to glory in being natures Cuckolds, the Lion,
Leopard, and Tygre likewise (tamed as it were by the dejectedly magestick looks
of their Master) grazed contendedly. From this they entered a Garden, where all
the Figures were cut out in Deaths-heads, and hemmed in with Dead-mens bones:
in one corner of this Garden was a walk, guarded upon both sides by
Cipress-trees, each whereof was topped by a skull; at the one end stood a
Tomb, and at the other a Grave; here Aretina begged of him the Story of that
Peerless Lady, whose death he so devoutely bemoaned: to which he returned this
answer.

Madam, that question renewes to me these Convulsion-fits of dispare, by which
my tortured Soul is so much distempered, and rackles that sore, which is
incurable, though the Gods themselves were my Physicians; for I mourn for what
is past; and since it is impossible, that the preterit should be recalled; it
is impossible that my wound should be cured: Yet, Madam, lest I should seem not
to prefer to my private repose, the satisfaction of one who is so far in
affinity with her, as to be of her sex and quality. I shall relate to you that
tragic History, which embiters to me the legend of my Life.

Whilst Lacedemon grovelled under the feet of fate, burriured by the hand of
its own Patriots; a Knight called Lacetus, married a Lady who shortly dying,
left one Daughter, whose beauty and parts, made her fully equivalle numbers of
other Children; and who, because of her features, as well as of her oneness,
was every way singular: it appears that the Excelcellency of this one,
encouraged him to marry that he might beget more, so that before his widows bed
had left the impression of his first Lady, he gives it that of a second; who
after his young Daughter had creeped up to the years of marriage, seeing that
she extenuated her beauty, and fearing that she might extenuate her Sons
fortune, she treated her with all these rigours that a step-humour could
suggerate to her: blunting her confidence, and narrowing her expense, so that
her fathers house did appear a prison to her. A young Gentleman who lived in
the same County, and was there much admired both for the greatness of his
parts, and goodness of his humor; regrating this downweighed condition,
frequents much Lacetus house, and goes often a hunting with him; hoping to gain
Pisetas affection* (for so was the Daughter called) neither failed he in his
project, for importunity and opportunity, did in end engage Piseta to him.
Which Ipsetus (this was the Gentleman's name) managed so discretly, as that none
could bottom the mystery; at last pressed by Piseta, that he would relive her
from that servitude, under which he truckled: and desirous to enjoy so peerless
a Mistress, he suits for her at her fathers hands, who deferred his answer till
he should const^^t his oraculous wife; who dissuaded him from the match, and
endeavored to affront the Gentlem^n; and after many delays which ^he (...)
continually, her rage at last lanced (...) self ^o far, (...) to cause threaten
him: Whereupon (...) conflicts, resolves to (...) ^^^tained Piseta's consent
and (...)* never either to love or marry and person else* which he desired she
might se^^ with a Sacred Oath: not that he jealoused the stabilitie of her
Faith, but to secure himself against these doubts, and future jealousies, which
is too anxious, Love might suggest to him. Ipsetus is no sooner gone, then that
pernicious Stepmother, whom the custom of doing mischief, had made bold to
execute, and the intense desire to (...) this poor Lady, had made cunning to
contrive all that her hellish-heart could invent; did now with more cruelty and
less fear then formerly, continue to afflict poor Piseta. But amongst her other
projects, this ensuing prank was the blow which was hardest to be warded;
because it disarmed her of her Fathers protection; which she sconced her self
always with formerly. She writes a Letter, as directed from one, Noretus, a
pedling Merchant of Lacedemon: wherein he thanked her for the encouragement she
gave him to continue in his affection, and regrated with her, her Fathers and
Step-mothers rigor. This Letter she sewed in a Pin-cushion, which a dying Lady
had bestowed upon her, and which because of that, she had always kept very
diligently. This being done, she addresses her self to her husband, and there
with tear-bedabled eyes, she condoles his Daughters folly; which did so
prostitute her affection, and might possibly prostrate her body to such mean
persons as Noretus was, and acquainted him how she had received Letters from
him; and as she was informed by one of her Maids, was coverted up in her
Pin-cushion: Wherefore, she resolved to seek presently the Pin-cushion before
himself. Piseta is sent for, from whom her Stepmother seeks it; whereat
Piseta, sorry that her Stepmother should seek that, which she behoved to
refuse; denies modestly with a blush to give it. her Father perceiving that she
both blushed and denied it, flings away immediately to her Chamber; and taking
it away with him, rips it up, and finds the Letter, which soothed all that was
told him. When he had collationed this with Noretus, giving his daughter some
Gloves and Ribbons, (which the honest Gentleman had given out of his affection
to the family which had always employed him) all is concluded infallibly; This
so inflamed him, that those flames of rage brunt his fatherly affection to
ashes; and armed him with the cruellest of resolutions against her: whereupon
calling for her, he first chid, and then beat her; so that scarce so much life
was left her, as to resent the miseries under which she lay loaded. But after
that her hard destiny had lent her further strength, that it might sport it
self yet longer with her afflictions, she teared away her year like days, in
regrating the sadness of her misfortunes, till at last like a too young branch,
she yields under the unsupportableness of her burden; and resolves to leave her
Fathers house, which her Step-mothers malice had enchanted: and to sanctuary
her self in some unknown corner, where at least none should upbraid her with
the disproportionatedness of her condition to her birth: having thus packt up
these Jewels which her Mother had delivered to her Nurse to be given her, she
steals away one morning to Lacedemon; but being wearied with such foot
Journeys, she retires into a meddow, a mile from the City, where after half an
hours stay, she perceives a Lady with her waiting maid come in a hackney Coach,
to breath in some Country-air. After they had taken a walk or two, Piseta
accoasts the Lady, and laying out his condition to her, entreated her Ladyships
charity in promoting her to some service; the other who was a Baud, glad of
such a servant accepted her in her own service, assuring her that she should be
tasked with nothing that was difficult: So that both being willing, she takes
her in Coach with her, and alots her a Chamber very well equipaged, and the
next morning clothes her in a new Gown, and all other necessaries. That night
I (whose youth clustred forth continually new grapes of wickedness) came in to
ravell away my time and moneys in that mother City, and recoursed immediately
to the house of that old Baud, where I used to feast my lust at all occasions;
at my entry she rejoiced (as she said) at my good fortune; for she was able to
give me the fairest and sweetest Maid she had ever eyed; but told me, that I
behoved to double her Salary: I who thought gold but money, when employed to
such uses, pactioned with her for a double fee: Whereupon she brought me in to
Piseta's chamber, and retiring, locked the door behind her. Piseta was employing
her time and needle very industriously, when my approach startled her: I must
acknowledge that never any was so admiration-beaten as I was, at the first
sight of that divine beauty; but when I began to carresse her, she entreated me
to be more reserved, and the more I pressed her, the more she recoiled: at
last, longing to enjoy so desirable an object, I asked, why dwelt she here,
being of so coy an humor. I came here to serve my Mistress, but not to suffer
such uncivil addresses (replied Piseta) which suits as ill with your
discretion, as they do with my modesty: This answer touched my very soul, and
finding that chance rather then resolution had guided me hither, I informed
her, how she was in a mistake; whereupon, poor Lady, falling upon her knees,
she begged from my Sword, an issue to her endless troubles; and told me her
birth, and the occasion of her coming there; with such speats of tears, as were
able to hurrie away before them, the strongest bancks of obstinat perverseness,
and with so pathetick expressions, as were eloquent enough to enforce the
greatest of cowards, to unsheath his sword in her quarrel. I found by her
relation, that she was the same person whom I was to go in suit of, and
acquainted her with my Name and Style, which did much encourage her. Lady (said
I to her) if I shall extricat you out of this danger, and re-enstate you in
your former liberty, will you condescend to marry me, to which after some
reluctancie she at last condescended; upon which I went to that old Baud, and
menaced her with the discovery of her wickedness, if she dismissed not that young
Lady, whom she had so betrayed, and withal satisfied her for what expense she
could allege she was at, and brought her to mine own house, where I waited
upon her without offering the least indignity to her person, till our love was,
authorized by Marriage.

But alas, this summer of joy lasted not long; for a fourthnight after our
Marriage, a Pilgrim did one morning desire to speak with Piseta, whose
devotion made this suit very acceptable. When she came in view, the Pilgrim
after a profound reverence thus occoasts her; Madam, My misfortune must sure be
unavoidable, when notwithstanding, both of the number and zeal of my services,
and in spite of your own virtuous inclination, it has carried you to forfeit
your engagment to me, and because that my happiness, and your honor, were
insolvably twisted together, to enrigide you so far against me, as that ye were
content rather to risk your own repute, then to suffer the integrity of my
happiness: if I shed not my blood in your quarrel, it was because ye wanted
daring enemies, and if ye were kept from the knowledge of what I suffered for
you, it was out of fear to make you suffer with me; but that I was racked
continually by your disasters, the Gods who are now my punishers, may in that
be my witness. But alas, Madam, I had offended too much these just Dieties, to
expect such promotions from them, and they were too intimatly knowing to your
condour, to suffer; that match to be made in Heaven: neither would I (if I were
not weary of this Life) remember the Gods, by re-iterating my complaints, how I
was guilty of so boundless presumption, which deserves as many chastisements as
there dwells Thunderbolts in the Clouds to punish it withal; yet, Madam, as
one who reposes all his weight upon one thing, must needs fall if that fail
him, so seeing I only lived to do you service, I must now die since my services
are rebuted, and with that pulling a Dagger out of his sleeve, he sent it to
his own heart, to acquaint it that he behoved to die: Piseta convinced that
this was her dear Ipsetus, and reflecting upon her own ingratitude, retired
immediately to her Chamber, and there uncloathing her self, she went to bed,
and calling for me, immediately she expressed her self thus to me.

It must be an unsupportable burden of grief (Dear Husband) which your
al-curing presence is not able to alleviat, and since I am criminell, both in
slighting my Oath, and in murdering the lovely Ipsetus, why should I yet
commit another crime in endeavoring to evite the punishment? And since I was
not so virtuous, as to take example by others, I should be now so virtuous, as
to desire others to take example by me. My own conscience has sentenced me
guilty of death; why should not then my own grief execute that so just a
sentence? and why should I by prolonging my life, leave my self a possibilty of
being yet more vicious? No, no, Dear Husband, the Gods are too just, to suffer
me to live to betray you, who has betrayed him whom I loved once as well as
you. And since the bonds of promise were not, they have reason to try, if the
bonds of death be strong enough to fetter me. Neither could they suffer that
your progeny should have been contagioned by the vitions Leprosy of such a
Mother, or that your liberty of matching one to your virtues, should have been
forbidden you by the valueless Life of the worthiless Piseta.

These words epilogued her life, and made me a lifeless witness, of her
tear-creating death, leaving me nothing but as much grief in Legacy, as my
never idle eyes shall be able to pay, although they employ the whole stock of
my moisture, for acquitting me of that obligation.

FINIS.
