PLUTO, the Prince of Darkness, His ENTERTAINMENT of Coll. Algernoon Sidney,
Upon His Arrival at the INFERNAL PALACE.
With the Congratulations of the Fanatic Cabal for his Arrival There.
To the Tune of, Hail to the Myrtle shade, etc.
^ ^ PLVTO. Room for great ALGERNOON,
You Furies that stand in his way
Let an Officer to Me come,
Who served me every day,
Promoting Sedition and Evil,
To alter the Church and the State,
He deserves an Employment in Hell,
He has done great service of late.

PLVTO. He Is one of the Damned old Crew,
Who Voted the Death of the King,
At Oxford again he did sue
To be at the self-same thing.
All Mischiefs on Earth de devised,
All hazards he also did run,
To render my Name solemnized
With the Rabble of London Town.

PLVTO. TO MONARCHY he was a Foe,
RELIGION he always disdained,
Against Government and Laws too,
Damned Anarchy he mantain'd;
I Will give Thee Preferment here,
Since Engl. has banished thee thence,
Brave Sidney thou need'st not fear,
Thou shall have great recompense.

SHAFTSBVRY. Now Monarchy has prevailed,
Our Fanatic Plots to defeat,
On whom is the Cause entailed?
Who Will stand it in spite of Fate?
We that maintained it so long,
From Justice were forced to fly;
If you then had come along,
You needed not there to die.

ESSEX. The Factious are quite undone,
For loss of the Fanatic Peers:
Now Shaftsbury and I are gone,
Poor Oats! has he lost his ears?
For Monm. our Shams and Intrigues
To the world has plainly declared,
And Howard our solemn Leagues,
In the Plot a long time prepared,

RVSSELL. I Am glad you are safe arrived,
Though I doubt you met Jack by the way;
Now Monm. is reconciled,
What a plague is become of Gray?
Rebellion could never disallow
Conspiring against the Prince,
Though I by a Sham-dying Vow
Did plead great Innocence.

London: Printed for a warning to all Traitors, 1684.
