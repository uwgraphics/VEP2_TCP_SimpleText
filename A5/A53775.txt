At a Meeting of the Heads of Houses. Mar. 22. 1688.


WHereas the Gowns, Capps, and Habits of all Members of this University, are by
the Statutes of the same to be made and fashioned with all exactness possible,
according to certain Models and Patterns in that behalf already provided, and
approved of by the Heads of Houses, and the Convocation. And whereas a general
Complaint has been made of these following irregularities in Scholastical
Habits, viz.

1. That many Graduats and other younger Scholars wear Mourning-Gowns without a
Cause approved by their respective Governor and allowed by Mr. Vicechancellor
and the Proctors.

2. That many Gentlemen-Commoners and others wear Square-Capps with Tufts that
have not performed any Exercise in the Theater to entitle them thereunto.

3. That diverse Under-Graduats upon pretense of being Students in the Civil Law
presume to wear a half-sleeved-Gown and a Square-Capp that are not four years
Standing in the University and duly entered upon the Law-Line.

4. That the use of wearing Hatts (nay even of Hatts buttoned up) in public,
and Crevatt-Bands unaccustomed to be worn, has of late prevailed much in the
University, to the great Scandal of it.

Whereupon, after mature deliberation had of the praemisses, and of the ill
effects and consequences such irregularities in Habits may produce, if not
timely prevented, it was unanimously agreed upon, that the particular Governors
should take care to redress the wearing of such unstatuteable Habits in their
respective Society's, and signify the Names of those that will not be reclaimed
by their Admonition to Mr. Vicechancellor that they may be punished as the
Statutes of the University in that case direct.
