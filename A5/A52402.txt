By HENRY Duke of NORFOLK, Earl-Marshall of England.
WHereas His Majesty has been pleased to Command me to take Care that this
present Mourning may be Performed with that Decency that becomes so Great an
Occasion: This is therefore to Inform all Persons Concerned, That it is expected
They put Themselves into the Deepest Mourning that is possible; (Long Cloaks
only excepted) And that as well all Lords, as Privy-Councillors, and Officers
of His Late Majesty's, and now Majesty's Household, do Cover their Coaches, and
Chairs, and Clothe their Livery Servants with Black Cloth; And that none
presume to use any Varnished or Bullion Nails to be seen on their Coaches or
Chairs; Except His Majesty, the Queen Consort, Queen Dowager, and their Royal
Highnesses.

Given under my Hand this Ninth Day of February, 1684. In the First Year of His
Majesty's Reign, King James the Second, over England, etc. NORFOLK, Marshall.
