THE DECLARATION OF JAMES DUKE of MONMOUTH, and The Noblemen, Gentlemen and
others, now in Arms, for Defense and vindication of the Protestant Religion,
and the Laws, Rights, and Privilieges of England, from the Invasion made upon
them: and for Delivering the Kingdom from the Usurpation and Tyranny of JAMES
DUKE of YORK.
AS Gouvernment was originally Instituted by God, and this or that form of it
chosen and submitted to by M^^, for the peace happiness and security of the
Governed, and not for the private Interest, and personal greatness of those
that Rule: so that Government has been always esteemed the host where the
supreme Magistrates have been vested with all the power and prerogatives that
might Capacitate them, not only to preserve the people from violence and
oppression, but to promote their prosperity; and yet where nothing was to
belong to them by the Rules of the Constitution, that might enable them to
injure and oppress them.

And it has been the Glory of England above most other Nations, that the
Prince had all entrusted with him that was necessary either for advanceing the
welfare of the people, or for his own protection in the discharge of his
Office, and with all stood so limited and restraines by the fundamental Terms
of the Constitution, that without a violation of his own Oath, as well as the
Rules, and measures of the Government, he could do them no hurt, or exercise
any act of Authority, but through the administration of such hands, as stood
obnoxious to be punished in case they transgressed. So that according to the
primitive Frame of the Government, the prerogatives of the Crown, and
privileges of the subject, were so far from justling one another; that the
rights reserved unto the People, tended to render the King honorable and Great;
and the prerogratives settled on the Prince, were in order to the subjects
protection and safety.

But all humane things being liable to pervertion, as well as decay; it has
been the fate of the English Government, to be often changed, and wrested from
what it was, in the first setlement and Institution. And we are perticularly
compelled to say, that all the boundaries of the Government have of late been
broken, and nothing left unattempted. for turning our limited Monarchy into an
absolute Tyranny. For such has been the transactions of affairs within this
Nation for several Years last past, that tho the Protestant Religion, and
Libertyes of the people, were fenced and hedged about, by as many Laws, as the
Wisdom of men could devise, for their preservation against Popery and
Arbitrary Power; our Religion has been all a long undermined by Popish
Counsels, and our Privileges ravished from us by fraud and violence. And more
especially, the whole course and series of the Life of the present Usurper,
has been but one continued conspiracy against the Reformed Religion, and
rights of the Nation.

For whosoever considers his contriving the burning of London; his Instigating
a consederacy with France, and a War with Holland; his somenting the popish
Plot; and encouraging the Murder of Sr. Edmund-Bury-Godfry to Stifle it; his
forging Treason against Protestants; and suborning witnesses to swear the
Patriots of our Religion and liberties out of their Lives; his hireing
execrable Villains to assassinate the late Earl of Essex; and causing
several others to be Claudestinly cut off in hopes to conceal it; his
advising and procuring the Prorogation and Dissolution of Parliaments, in order
to prevent enquiry into his Crimes, and that he might escape the justice of the
Nation: such can imagine nothing so black and horrid in it self, or so ruinous
and destructive to Religion, and the Kingdom, which we may not expect from
him, upon his having invaded the Throne; and usurped the Title of a King. The
very Tyrannies which he has exercised, since he natched the Crown from hi
Brothers head, do leave none under a possibility of flatering themselves, with
hopes of safety either in their consciences, persons, or Estates.

For in defiance of all the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, made for the
security of the Reformed Protestant Religion, he not only began his Usurpation
and pretended Reign, with a bare faced avowing himself of the Romish Religion,
but has called in muititudes of Priests and Jesuits (for whom the Law makes it
treason to come into the Kingdom) and has empowered them to exercise their
Idolatries, and besides his being daily present at the worship of the Mass,
has publicly assisted at the grossest Fopperios of their superstition.

Nor has he been more tender in trampling upon the Laws which Concern our
Properties, seeing by two Proclamations, whereof the one requires the
collecting of the Customs, and the other the continuing that part of the
Excise which was to expire with the late Kings death, he has violently and
against all the Laws of the Land broken in upon our Estates. Neither is it any
extenuation of his usurpation and Tyranny, that he is countenanced in it by an
extra Judicial opinion of seven or eight suborned and forsworn Judges: that
rather declaring the greatness and extent of the conspiracy against our Rights,
and that there is no means left for our releife, but by force and Arms. For
advancing those to the Bench, who were the scandal of the Bar; and
Constituting those very men to deelare the Laws, who were accused and branded
in Parliament for perverting them; We are precluded all hopes of redress in
Westminster Hall: and through packing to gather by false returns, new Illegal
Charters, and other corrupt means, a company of men which he intends to style
a Parliament; he does at once deprive us of all expectation of succor, where
our Ancestors were wont to find it: and hopes to render that which ought to be
the peoples fence against Tyranny, and the conservators of their Liberties, the
means of subverting all our Laws, and of establishing his Arbitraryness, and
confirming our thraldom. So that unless We could be contented to see the
reformed Protestant Religion, and such as profess it extirpated; popish
superstition and Idolatry established: the Laws of the Land Trampled underfoot;
the Liberties and rights of the English people subverted; all that is Sacred,
and Civil, or of regard amongst men of Piety, or Virtue Violated; and an
Usurper Tyrannising on the Throne: and unless We could be willing to be Slaves
as well as Papists; and forget the example of our noble and generous
Ancestors, who conveyed our Privileges to us at the expense of their blood
and treasure; and with all be un mindful of our duty to God, our Country and
Posterity; deaf to the cries and groans of our oppressed Friends; and be
satisfied not only to see them and our selves Imprisoned, robbed, and
murdered; but the Protestant Interest throughout the whole world, betrayed to
France and Rome. We are bound as Men and Christians and that in discharge of
our duty to God, and our country, and for fatisfaction of the expectations of
the Protestant Nations round about us, to betake ourselves to Arms: which we
call Heaven and Earth to witness, we should not have done; had not the Malice
of our Enemies deprived us of all other means of redress, and were not the
miseries we already feel, and those which do further threaten us, worse then
the Calamities of War.

And it is not for any personal injuries or private discontents, nor in
pursuance of any corrupt Interest, that we take our swords into our hands; but
for Vindicating our Religion, Laws, and Rights, and rescueing our Country from
ruin and destruction: and for preserving our selves, Wives and Children, from
Bondage and Idolatry; wherefore before God, Angels, and Men, we stand
acquitted from, and do charge upon our Enemies, all the slaughters and
devastations, that unavoidably accompany a Intestine War.

Now therefore We do hereby solemnly declare and proclaim War against JAMES
DUKE of YORK, as a Murderer, and an Assassin of Innocent men; A Popish Usurper
of the Crown; a Traitor to the Nation; and Tyrant over the People. And we
would have none that appear under his Banners, to statter themselves with
expectation of forgiveness; it being our firm resolution to prosecute him and
his adherents, without giving way to Treaties, or Accommodations, until we
have brought him, and them, to undergo what the Rules of the Constitution, and
the Statutes of the Realm, as well as the Laws of Nature, Scripture, and
Nations, adjudg to be the punishment due to the Enemies of God, Mankind, their
Country, and all things that are honorable, Virtuous, and good.

And tho we cannot avoid being sensible, that too Many have from Cowardice,
Covetousness, and Ambition, cooperated to the subverting Religion, and
inslaving their Country; Yet We would have none from a despair of finding
Mercy, persever in their Crimes, nor continue to pursue the ruin of the
Kingdom. For We Exclude none from the benefit of Repentance, that shall join
with us in retreiving what they have been accessory to the loss of; nor do we
design Revenge upon any, but the Obstinate, and such as shall befound at this
Juncture, yiedling aid and assistance to the said James Duke of York.

And that We may both Govern our selves in the pursuit of this Glorious Cause
where in We are engaged, and give encouragement to all that shall assist us in
so righteous and necessary an Undertaking: We do in the Presence of the Lord
who knows the secrets of all hearts, and is the Avenger of Deciept and
Falsehood, Proclaim and publish what We aim at, and forth obtaining Where of
We have both determined to Venture and are ready to lay down our lives. And
tho We are not come into the Field to Introduce Anarchy and Confusion, or for
laying aside any Essential part of the old English Government: Yet our purpose
and resolutions are to reduce things to that Temperament and balance, that
future Rulers may remain able to do all the good, that can be either desired
or expected from them; and that it may not be in their power to invade the
Rights, and infringe the Liberties of the People.

And Whereas our Religion (the most Valuable blessing We lay claim unto) has
been shaken by unjust Laws; undermined by Popish Councills, and is now in
danger to be subverted by a Tyrannous and Idolatrous Usurper. We are therefore
resolved to spend our blood for preserving it to our selves and posterity nor
will we lay down our arms, til we seen established and secured, beyond all
probability of being supplanted, and overthrown; and until all the penal Laws
against Protestant Diffenters be repealed, and legal provision made against
their being disturbed by reason of their Consciences, and for their enjoying an
equal Liberty with other Protestants. And that the meekness and purity of our
Principles, and the moderation and Righteousness of our Ends, may appear unto
all men; We do declare, that we will not make War upon, or destroy Any, for
their Religion how false and erroneous soever: so that the very Papists,
provided they, Withdraw from the tents of our Enemies and be not found Guilty
of Conspiring our destruction, or Abettors of them that seek it, have no thing
to fear or apprehend from us, except what may hinder their altering our Laws,
and endangering our persons, in the profession of the reformed Doctrine, and
exercise ofour Christian Worship.

Our Resolution in the next place is, to maintain all the just Rights and
Privileges of Parliament, and to have Parliaments annually chosen and held,
and not prorogued, dissolved, or discontinued with in the year before
petitions be first answered and Grievances Redressed.

And seeing many of the miseries under which the Nation does groan arise from
displacing such out of the Number of Judges, as would not for promoting popish
and arbitrary designs, wrest and misapply the Laws; and from constituting
Corrupt, and Mercenary men in their Room, on purpose to stretch the Laws
beyond the Reason and Intention of them, and to declare that for Law which is
not: We can neither with silence pass over the mentioning of them, nor should
we have peace in our selves, if we did not endeavor to prevent the like
mischeifes in time to come. For by means of Ill men's being advanced to the
Bench, and holding their places only durante been placito, Many persons have
been condemned in Exorbitant fines for no Crimes, or for Very small ones; many
statutes made for the safety of the subject, particularly the Habeas Corpus
Act, has been wickedly eluded, to the oppression of Innocent and loyal men;
the Popish Lords that were Impeached in Parliament, for a most Hellish
Conjuration, have to the subverting of the rights of the House of Commons, and
trampling on the Jurisdiction of the House of Lords, been discharged and set
free; the imposing a malignant Major, and Sherriffes, upon the City of London
by fraud and Violence has been justified, and those who in discharge of their
duty opposed it, illegally prosecuted and arbitrarily punished: London, and
other Cities and Corporations have been robbed of their Charters, upon
unrighteous judgments of pretended forfeitures; Sr. Thomas Armstrong executed,
with out being allowed the benefit of a Trial; Collonell Algernon Sydney
condemned to dye upon the deposition of one scandalous Witness: And that loyal
and excellent person the late William Lord Russell murdered, for alleged
crimes, in reference to which, if all had been truth that was sworn against
him, yet there was nothing that according to Law could have reached his life:
Wherefore we do upon the considerations a foresaid further declare, that we
will have care taken for the future, for debarring ignorant, scandalous, and
mercenary men from the Administration of Justice, and that the Judges shall
hold their places by the ancient tenure of quam diu se been gesserint, and do
leave it to the wisdom of a Parliement, to settle some way and method, for the
approbation of such as shall be advanced to the degree and dignity of Judges.

And for as much as the invasion made upon the rights of Cities, Burroughes, and
Towns corporate, in the seizure of their charters, whether by surrender, or
upon pretense of forfeiture, has been wholly arbitrary and illegal: We
likewise therefore declare, that we will to our utmost endeavor to see them
repossessed in whatsoever they formerly had, and could legally claim before
the late Usurpation upon them; and that we do esteem all judgments given
against them, and all Surrenders made by a corrupt and perjured party amongst
themselves, null and void in Law; and do hold and declare their old charters
(norwithstanding the new ones lately granted) to be good and valid: And
accordingly We de invite and encourage all honest Burgesses, and Freemen, to
reassume the Rights and Privileges, which by virtue of the said old charters
belonged to their several and respective corporations, and to deliver
themselves from those Court Parasites, and instruments of tyranny, set up to
oppress them.

More over for restoring the Kingdom to its primitive condition of Freedom and
safety: We will have the corporation, and militia Acts, repealed, and all
Outlawries of treason, against any person whatsoever upon the late pretended
Protestant plot reversed; and also all other outlawries, banishments, warrants,
judgments, imprisonments, abjurations and proceedings, against any other
persons, upon any of the penal statutes made against Protestant dissenters,
reversed and made null and void; and We will have new Laws enacted, for
placeing the Election of Sherriffes in the Freeholders of the several
Counties; and for settling the Militia in the respective Sheriffs, and for
preventing all military standing Force except what shall be raised and kept up,
by Authority and consent of Parliament.

And whereas several Gentlemen, and others, who have been worthy and zealous
astertors of the Protestant Interest, and laws of the Kingdom, are now in
custody in diverse prisons within the Realm, upon most unjust accusations,
pretenses, proceedings, and judgments; We do hereby further declare their said
imprisonments to be Illegal, and that in Case any violence shall be offered to
them, or any of them, We will revenge it to the utmost, upon such of our
Enemies as shall fall into our hauds.

And whereas the said James Duke of York, in order to the expediting the
Idolatrous and bloody designs of the Papists, the gratifying his own boundless
ambition after a Crown, and to hinder enquiry into his Assassination of Arthur
Earl of Essex, has poisoned the late King, and there in manifested his
ingratitude, as well as Cruelty, to the world, in murdering a Brother, who had
almost ruined himself to preserve and protect him from punishment: We do
therefore further declare, that for the aforesaid Villainous and unnatural
Crime, and other his crimes before mentioned, and in pursuance of the
Resolution of both Houses of Parliament, who Voted to revenge the Kings Death,
in Case he came to an untimely end; We will prosecute the said James Duke of
York, till We have brought him to suffer, what the Law adjudged to be the
punishment of so excrable a fact. And in a more particular manner, his Grace
the Duke of Monmouth, being deeply sensible of that barbarous and horrid
parricide committed upon his Father, does resolve to pursue the said James Duke
of York, as a mortal and bioudy Enemy, and will endeavor as well with his own
hand, as by the assistance of his Friends, and the Law, to have justice
executed upon him.

And forasmuch as the said James Duke of Monmouth, the now Head and Captain
General of the Protestant forces of this Kingdom assembled in pursuance of the
Ends aforesaid; has been, and still is believed, to have a legitimate, and
Legal right, to the Crowns of England, Scotland, France and Ireland, with the
Dominions there unto belonging, of which he doubts not in the least, to give
the world full satisfaction notwithstanding the means used by the late King his
Father, upon popish motives, and at the instigation of the said James Duke of
York, to weaken and obscure it; The said James Duke of Monmouth from the
generousness of his own nature, and the Love he bears to these nations, (whose
welfare and setlement he infinitely prefers, to whatsoever may concern
himself,) does not at present insist upon his Title, but leaves the
determination thereof to the wisdom, justice, and authority of a Parliament,
legally chosen and acting with freedom. And in the time mean does promise and
declare by all that is sacred, that he will in conjunction with the People of
England, Employ all the Abilities bestowed upon him by God and Nature, for the
reestablishment and preservation of the Protestant reformed Religion in these
Kingdoms, and for restoring the Subjects of the same, to a free exercise
thereof, in opposition to Popery, and the consequences of it, Tyranny and
Slavery; To the obtaining of which ends, he does hereby promise, and oblige
himself to the people of England, to consent unto, and promote the passing
into Laws, all the methods aforesaid; that it may never more be in the power of
any single person on the Throne, to deprive the subjects of their Rights, or
subvert the fundimentall Laws of the Government designed for their preservation.

And Whereas the Nobility, Gentry, and Commons of Scotland, are now in arms,
upon the like motives, and Inducements that we are, and in prosecution of ends
agreeable with ours; We do therefore approve the Justice of their cause,
commend their Zeal and Courage, expecting their, and promiseing our
Assistance, for carrying on that glorious work we are jointly engaged in.

Being obliged for avoiding tediousness, to omit recounting many Oppressions
under which the Kingdom has groaued, and the giving a Deduction of the several
Steps that have been taken for introducing and establishing of popery and
Tyranny: We think fit therefore to signify, both to our Country men, and
Foreigners, that We intend, a larger Manifesto, and Remonstrance of the
Grievances, Persecutions, Crueltyes and Tyrannies, We have of late layne
under, and therein a more full and particular account of the Unparralleled
Crimes of the present Usurper.

And We make our appeal unto God, and all Protestants Kings, Princes, States,
and People, concerning the Justice of our Cause, and the necessity we are
reduced unto, of having our recourse to Arms. And as we do beseech require
and adjure all sincere Protestants, and true Englishmen, to be assisting to us
against the Enemies of the Gospel, Rights of the Nation, and liberties of
mankind; so we are confident of obtaining the ut most aid and succor which
they can yield us with their Prayers, Persons, and Estates, for the Dethroning
the said Tyrant and Popish Usurper.

Nor do We doubt being justified, contenanced, and assisted, by all Protestant
Kings, Princes, and common Wealths, Who do either regard the Gospel of Jesus
Christ, or their own Interest: and above all our dependence and trust is upon
the Lord of hosts, in whose name We go forth, and to whom we commit our
cause, and referr the dicision betwixt us and our Enemies in the Day of Battle.
Now let us play the men, for our People, and for the Cities of our God, and the
Lord do that which seems good unto him.
