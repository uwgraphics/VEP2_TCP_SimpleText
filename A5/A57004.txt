TO THE READER; But Especially to his Brethren the Apothecaries of LONDON.
SIRS, If the unspotted innocence of an Action (as to the rendering of a
prejudice) be a sufficient Barricado to oppose the thundering and pell-mell
Grenades of impertinent Contradiction, and malevolent Censure, we question not
but this harmless Essay of our early Lucubrations may withstand the first Lash
of the Critics Rod, and in some measure mitigate, if not gag or stop the
rigidness of your Censures; or at least induce your Charity to connive at our
imbecility, by glancing through the Lattice of a diminishing Telescope.

The advantage and commodement of the public in general, was the perfect Achme
of this enterprise, in trimming our Author in this Garb, to which, if these
endeavors add but one grain, or Atome, (though scattered by the hands of
weather-beaten Imperfection) we shall acknowledge it not only the Heroic
Carac, but also the Laureat Apex of our Glory.

Doubtless (Sirs) this was the fundamental Syntax of our thoughts, to which we
determined the designation of this Translation: but we presume it may meet with
a greater influence upon your Acceptations, as most congruous to your stations,
being the professed Sons of Apollo, soaring in the highest sphere of Natures
Economy, inhabiting the Thurisick Groves of Rerum Natura, attending the
sproutings of their variegated Offspring.

The benefit you may receive hereby (after some serious exagitation) we partly
understand by the glimpse of that more than ordinary Illustration our formerly
clouded Genius is now bespangled with. The peroration, as to reversion of that
utility which may by futurity accrue, here imploreth (Sirs) both your
resentment and communication.

Can any Copy be so grateful to ingenious persons, than that whose stamp
appears in the beaten path of Antiquity? wherein there is no Jurgia Mentis to
pertarr your cogitations from delabing through the Golden Channels of Experience.

Sirs, here you will find the confused Recipes, and linsy-woolsy-conceptions
of Physicians ranged into an exact method, their Enigmatical expressions
unforked and unvailed, their cloudy sentences artionobolized into rays of
Light.

Ignorance beskreens the soul, here our Author discovers the dawnings of
knowledge, by breaking open the hidden Caverns of Nature, and explaining the
secreta, or occult qualities of her multifarious Vegetables.

Here the whole Pharmaceutical Art is denuded, and redacted to the clear
intelligence of the meanest capacity, claiming your attentions, whilst it
affords instructions to conduct you to a clear prospect of Via recta ad vitam
longam, promising a Medicine for every Malady, and a Balm for every Soar.

Here you may behold Phoebus skipping from the Bowers of Neptune, and by his
darting through the Casements of Heaven, gracing the cincture of the day with
his radiant complexion, glistering with Robes of silver, shooting life and
spirit by his beams into the fruits of the Earth.

Here you may see our Author traversing many lofty Heaven aspiring Mountains,
and anon conducting you into the pleasant Penaean Valleys.

Here you may sit upon the diapred brim of the Universe, and accumulate
Nose-gayes of Roses and Gilliflowers, Medicines for scent and savor, cordial
and reviving.

Here you may view how this lofty Turret the Earth is bespread with Daffadils
and Prime-roses, Cowslips and Columbine; and the Amber Locks of Ver dallying
with the Eglantine Banks of Bravery.

Here you may view the superbious Trees presuming to elevate their tops in the
sacred Skies, In the three Books of Medicinal Materials.
the delicious Bowers of the Woods adorned with the Treasure of Flora's
bespangled Drapery, the curled Grows rattling with the bloomy gales, the
verdant Leaves flourishing, the Silver streams of pleasant Rivers gliding, the
flagrant Meadows braving it with the riches of Autumn, displaying the pride of
their beauty; the pleasant Umbrages sporting with Zephyrus-Nectar-Blooms,
shining with Titan's transpiercing Darts; and the whole Garden of the Universe
embellished with curious Tapestry, glistering Ingeny, and interchangeable
Jollity.

Here may you see Rhenodaeus plowing through the liquid Intrals of Nereus,
dancing Lovalto's upon the azured waves, making Amphitrite display a delicate
apparition of Paphian allurement, discovering as it were the stately
Battlements of the Mint of Mexico, and the Minerals of Peru; the nature of the
Porphyrie, with the virtue of the Saphyre, the Carbuncle with the Topaz, the
Emerald with the Chrysolite, the Smaragd with the Margarite. Millions of thanks
to debonaire Fortune, that these Ambrosian Delicacies are discovered, before
the Postilions of Eolus have fled to Neptune's azured Commonwealth, and our
Horizon over-veiled with the Canopie of drousy Vesper (Ignorance.)

In a word, here may you view the enamelled Robe of the Universe, Lady like,
spotted with its rosy-locks; whose hair does not more adorn than profit; whose
ruby cheeks are not more admired for their beauty, than for their salubrious
virtues desired; whose frank, free, fragrant, and fruitful Breasts do nourish
her own Children sprung from her never resting womb, affording nourishment both
to Man and Beast. Insomuch that we may well cry out with Du Bartas; 'Good Lord!
how many gasping Souls have escaped
'By th'aid of Herbs, for whom the Grave has gap't;
'Who even about to touch the Stygian Strand,
'Have yet beguiled grim Pluto's greedy hand.
'O sacred Simples, that our Life sustain,
'And when it flies, can call it back again;
''Tis not alone your Liquor inly taken,
'That often defends us from so many a bane;
'But even your savor, yea, your neighborhood,
'For some diseases is exceeding good.
'O great is the powerful Good that lies
'In Herbs, Trees, Stones, and their true qualities:
'For naught so vile, that on the Earth does live,
'But to the Earth some secret good does give;
'And naught so rich, on either Rock or Shelf,
'But, if unknown, lies useless to it self,
'Therefore who thus does make his Secrets known,
'Doth profit others, but not hurt his own.


Sirs, Communication is the primo-genito of Goodness; and why should so
singular a benefit longer lie hid? Does not the immense Excellency of Eternity
delight himself in expanding the beams of his Goodness? and why should the
younger Sister, the Sun-burned beauty of Knowledge, and Science sublunar, be
encloystered within the obscure verge of a foreign Language, barbarous, and
almost inexplicable Idiome? Undoubtedly (Brethren) Heaven will follow it with a
correspondency of Blessings.

We desire not (Sirs) to degrade, or go about to darken the splendor, or
obstruct the luster of the Oriency of that never fading Crown due to the
Seraphick Founts of Learning; but to exclaim (and not without cause) against
the Saturnine tyranny of such, whose endeavors are to monopolize all Arts and
Sciences in an uncouth Magazine, and to inhance them, as by Letter-Patent,
locking them up, with the feculent bolts of Self-exaltation, beyond the usual
extension of vulgar Capacities, not allowing them the privilege to peep within
the veil.

How many thousands of poor Wretches that are arrested by the virulent
malignity of a distemper, and by its creeping Gangrena, preposterously hurried
into the boats of Charon; whereas a small matter, and it may be, a Plant
sprouting at their own doors, might dissipate its vehemence at its first onset,
if thoroughly understood, and rightly applied.

Was it not the practice of the Heathens Magi, Damones, and Sophoi, to captive
the People under the hatches of blindness? and did they not receive the just
Guerdon of fallacy? Shall Science be a peculiar man's property? God forbid.

Is not Salus Populi the Pallisado of Republics? and Experience Corona
Scientiarum? It imports you, Sirs, whom God has called in a peculiar manner
to be as it were his Vicegerents, to operate in things about life and death,
to endeavor a promotion of the former, by preparing fitly Natures Offspring
for convenient and suitable Nutriment to so sublime a subject; and to increase
the latter, by making confused things (every where occurrent) distinct; and
abstruse, obvious.

Sirs, you live in a City, which the Eternal Being has bedubbed and adorned
with variety of blessings, clarified Intellectuals, and well polished
Judgments; you are subservient to the refinedst Artists under the Cope of
Heaven, crowned with never-fading-Palms, for their boundless knowledge in the
Botannick Art. What Plant is there in the fertile womb of the Earth, that is
not now found out, and known? What glistering and shining Stars do daily,
appear in your Horizon? Can every age boast of a Gerard, Parkinson, or Johnson?
what an incomparable Cheapside.
Garden have you hourly access unto, which may contend with the greatest part
of the World for Glory, Beauty, and Variety! and shall not these Considerations
alarm you? you that are called Opiferque per Orbem, to demonstrate your zeal to
your Native Country, by discovering in intelligible Characters, the virtues,
properties and qualities of such Simples as this Climate is luxuriant with;
which (Sirs) would be an overflourishing Herald to emblazon your Escutcheons
without Star, half Moon, spot, or blemish; and eternize your names in indelible
stamps, upon the pinnacle of Fame; and when your Works shall redeem sick
consumed persons from their expected Coffins, you shall be adored as so many
Deities adumbrated in bodies of flesh.

Be ye the Golden Heliotropes of Gods right hand, shutting and opening at his
good will and pleasure, not wrapping your Talents in the Napkin of secresy, but
rather laying out your endeavors for the good of your Country. Then would
exotical Plants submit to the excellency of domestic Simples; and homebred
remedies be sought after for homebred diseases.

You cannot be ignorant what calumnies of late have been hurled upon both
Physicians and Apothecaries; the cause of such detraction is Ignorance.
Successit odium in Literas ab Ignorantia vulgi. Which Junius well perceived.
And can these men judge of a Scholars worth and pains, that are not acquainted
with study-labours? That long since unforked dilemma of Pliny has often been
revived, and to this day fostered; which is thus stated; Every Disease is
either curable or incurable; a man either recovers of it, or is killed by it;
both ways Physic is to be rejected; if it be deadly, it cannot be cured; if
it may be helped, it requires no Physic, Nature will expel it of it self.
Doubtless (Sirs) it concerns you to dispell such Clouds, seeing some have been
so impudent to hold, that it is no Art at all, nor worthy the name of a Liberal
Science, as Pet, and Canouherius, a Patrician of Rome, and a famous Doctor,
goes about to prove by 16 Arguments; because it is mercenary, as now adays
used, as Fiddlers play for a reward; and that the Devil himself was the first
Inventor of it. Inventum est Medicina meum, said Apollo.

Neither have the Paracelsian Order (as so many Promethei that would fetch Fire
from Heaven) the least share in these Contumelacies: how are Galen and
Hippocrates (who were the first that ever writ of Physic to any purpose)
censured by them, for immethodical and obscure, terming their Medicines
obsolete, and their Precepts confused, and for the most part rejected by them,
calling them Mountebanks, Empericks, Impostors, Infants, Idiots, Sophisters,
and such like, not worthy the name of Physicians, who were not versed in the
knowledge of such Remedies as they had, boasting that he himself could make a
man live 160 years by his Alexipharmacums, Panacea's, Mumia's, Unguentum
Armarium, and such Magnetical Cures; Lampas vitae and mortis, Balneum Dianae,
Balsamum, Electrum, Magieo-Physicum, Amulets, Martiala. What will not he (who
styles himself Theophrastus, Hariolum, Bombastum, Hohanhein) and his Disciples
effect? He proclaims himself to be Primus Medicorum, and did more famous Cures
than all Physicians in Europe, vapouring that a drop of his Preparations should
go further than an ounce of theirs.

How is Galen taxed by Cardan (without a due consideration of his worth) for
presuming out of his Ambition (as he terms it) to correct Theriacum Andromachi?
and why there must be just so many Simples in Mithridate; and why such and such
a quantity. How are the Receipts of Myrepsius, Mesue, Celsus, Scribanius,
Actuarius, and others, for the most part now condemned and neglected? Every
private man must have his own Compositions and Magisterials, as if he scorned
Antiquity; each fellow must correct and alter, to show his skill, and maintain
his own Paradox, be it what it will, and in the mean time the Patients must pay
for their new Experiments.

But we will not urge these cavilling Arguments any further, we hope (Sirs) you
understand the frothiness of such Positions, and that you will be ready to
vindicate it from such Aspersions, and acknowledge it to be a noble and divine
Science; insomuch that Apollo, Esculapius, and the first Founders of it, merito
pro diis habiti, were worthily accounted Gods by succeeding ages.

Are we not enjoined to honor the Physician for necessity sake? Ecclesiasticus
18.3.
The knowledge of the Physician lifts up his head, and in the sight of great
men he shall be admired; the Lord has created Medicines of the earth, and he
that is wise will not abhor them.

Let such prattle what they will, mixed Diseases must have mixed Remedies. It
is a most noble invention, says Quercitan, found out and brought into Physic
with great judgment, counsel, wisdom and discretion, so that the greatness of
the Composition bespeaks the elegancy of the Medicine. For Brass vola and
Cardan maintain, Nullum Medicamentum simplex esse sine no^a: Therefore in every
Composition such Simples are mixed as have affinity to the part affected, some
to qualify, the rest to roborate, some one part, Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy.
some another. It Is true of old, Physicians were compelled in the Infancy of
this Art, to make use of ordinary Simples; but now necessity compells us to
make use of new Remedies, and to make Compounds of Simples; as well to correct
their nocumental qualities, if cold, dry, hot, thick, thin, in sipid, noisome
to smell, to make them savoury to the palate, pleasant to the gust; as also to
preserve them for continuance, by admixtion of Sugar and Honey, to make them
last months and years for many futine uses.

Truly (Sirs) it is a general fault (as Severinus the Dane complained) in
Physic. Unhappy men, we spend our days in unprofitable questions and
disputations, intricate subtilties, de Lana Caprina, about Moonshine in the
water, leaving in the mean time the chiefest of Natures Secrets untouched,
wherein the best Medicines for all manner of diseases are to be found, and do
not only neglect them our selves, but hinder, condemn, forbid, and scoff at
others that are willing to enquire after them. Yet I presume few of you but are
affected with a passionate speech, a well penned and elegant Poem, Burton's
Melancholy.
or some pleasant and bewitching discourse. We presume (Brethren) that is an
extraordinary delight for you to study, and to swallow down the Ambrosian
sweetness of Natures Arcana, let the World taste of the fruits of your labors;
fear not the gurmundizing jaws of Zoilus, that with the Mastives of Cyrum, bark
against the Moon. What an infinite number of Books offer themselves in all
subjects, Arts and Sciences, even to allure your minds to seek complacency in
their contemplation? in Arithmetic, Geometry, Burton's Melancholy.
Perspective, Astronomy, Optic, Architecture, Scalpture, Picture; in Music,
Metaphysick, Natural and Moral Philosophy, Philology, in Mechanics, and their
Mysteries, Military matters, Navigation, riding of Horses, Fencing, Gardning,
Hunting, Fishing, Fowling; in Policy, Heraldry, Genealogy, Chronology. What
vast Tomes are extant in Law, Physic, and Divinity, for profit, pleasure,
speculation, and practice?

Which of you will not be ravished to read the description of that Geometrical
Tower of Gorzenda at Bologn? to see the Steeple and Clock at Strasburgh, and
will not thence admire the effects of Art? Or that Engine so much talked of by
Archimedes, to remove the Earth it self, if he had but a place to fasten his
Instrument in.

What greater pleasure, Loco citato.
Sirs, can there be to ingenuous persons, than to view those elaborate Maps of
Ortelius, Mercator, Hondius, etc. to peruse Bellonius his Observations, Gillius
his Surveys, Harvey's Circulation of the Blood, America set out and cut in
Pictures by Fratres A Bry; to see a well cut Herbal, Herbs, Trees, Flowers,
Plants, all Vegetables, expressed in their proper colors to the life; as that
of Matthiolus upon Dioscorides, Delacampius, Lobel, Bauhinus, and that
voluminous Herbal of Beslar, where every Plant is described to his own bigness;
to see all Creatures deciphered by the same art, with an exact description of
their names, natures, virtues, and qualities, as has been accurately performed
by Elian, Gesner, etc. and truly the like pleasure there is in all other
studies to such as are addicted to them.

Who can read over the Elogiums of other men's praises of certain Herbs, and
not be amazed at their occult qualities? Plin. l. 25. c. 22. l. 26. c. 13. L.
24. c. 17.
As Nepenthe, in expelling sadness; Hippuriu, in stenching blood; Nictegretum,
or Nyctilops, that shines like a Lamp in the night, and above all other
Creatures, scareth the Geese. Collicia turns water into ice; Hemlock meat to
Storks, but poison to Men; Flabia, if cut, sends forth warm blood.

The Herb Achimedis, Bu Bartas Summary.
if it be applied to any thing locked or bolted, it will presently open it. Who
cannot but stand amazed at the Herb Sentida, growing in India, which if any
come near unto it, or touch it, or throw any thing upon it, it presently
withers, ( Purchase Pilgrim. lib. 5. c. 12.)

Which of you can give a reason of the diversity of Meteors, that it should
rain Stones, Frogs, Mice, and Rats? Who would not but examine the truth of
Astronomers reasons, Burton's Mel.
whether the Stars be of that bigness and distance as they relate, 29000
Myriads, Loco citato.
as Galilee discovers by his glasses, and some Rabbis stiffly maintain? Who
would not but know whether the least visible Star in the eighth Sphere, be 18
times bigger than the Earth, and 14000 semidiameters distant from it?

Is it not worth the inquiry (Sirs) whether the Sun be 140 times bigger than
the Earth, as Tycho would have it, Swan 's Speculum Mundi.
and the Moon to be lesser than any Star? For he makes Mercury 19 times lesser
than the Earth, and the Moon lesser than he 42 times? Who would not but know
how the Stars move in the Heavens? Does one Sphere cut another? Or are there no
solid Orbs? Are not the Planets now higher, then lower? Mars sometime lower
than the Sun, and anon in Jupiter's Sphere? Are the Heavens not impenetrable,
as some maintain? Or do they differ from the Air we live in?

Are they living Creatures, as some of late do maintain, and endowed with sense
and reason, as others would have them? Are the Stars of such a nature and
substance that they should stand in need of sustentation, as some judge? Or can
they give light no otherwise than as a lamp replenished with Oil? Which is not
altogether unconsonant to reason, for the Heavens are subject to change and
alteration.

Which of you that would not dive into that main paradox of the Earths Motion?
Loco citato.
For if the Earth being the center of the World, stand still, and the Heavens
move, by what power is the Heavens carried about with such an incommprehensible
celerity in 24 hours? which as Comment. 2. Chapter Spher. Io. de sac. Bosc.
Clavius calculates, every point of the Firmament must needs move 176650
leagues in one 24th part of an hour.

Who can determine what becomes of Cranes, Cuckoes, Burtonus.
Swallows, Nightingales, Storks, Red-starts, that some are seen only in
Summer, some in VVinter? do they sleep? or do they lie hid in the bottoms of
Lakes and Rivers? or do they follow the Sun, as Peter Martyr believes?

Who is not desirous to know whether Mount Atlas, Athos, Loco citato.
Caucasus, Olympus, and Ossa, beso high as Pliny relates, above both Clouds and
Meteors 1250 paces high? or as Mazonius calculates them, 78 miles
perpendicularly high?

Why does Africa breed so many venomous Beasts? Ireland none? Athens Owls?
Crete none? Why has Thebes no Martins? Pontus no Asses? Ithaca no Hares? and
Scythia no Swine?

Why so many strange Birds found in America alone, as Acosta demands, insomuch
that neither Greek, Latin, or Hebrew ever heard of them before? Why are the
Spaniards white? and yet the Inhabitants of Caput bonae spet black? and both
alike distant from the Equator.

We would also traverse the Thickets of the VVoods, and find out where the
Phaenix builds her nest, and where the Unicorn lodges, or whether there be any
such Creatures.

We would also post to Lebanus, to see whether there be any Cedars yet growing
of Salomon's planting, as some maintain; and also enquire of the Indians,
whether their Territories bear any such a Tree as is called Arbor-de Raise,
which is by some averred to be the Tree of Adam's transgression, yielding many
boughs, which put forth certain threads of a golden color, which growing
downwards to the Earth, there take root again.

We would also dive into the bowels of the Earth, and there see the Generation
of Minerals, Fossiles and Metals; and would also know, whether the Mountains of
Jamaica afford more Metal than the Valleys of Peru. But whether does the clue
of our thoughts lead us? We have too long roved in the depths of Nocturnus,
we profess our selves not to be able to fathom with the Plummet of our
Juvenility, these profundities; we leave the determination of these things to
stronger Wits, that have better leisure to wade into such Phylosophical
mysteries; neither do they tend much to our present purpose.

Therefore (Sirs) we will not detain you too long in the Portal of the Rows of
our own cogitations, but enode the knot, and throw open the gates; only tender
you a preparatory advertisement of such specifications, whose precognition must
be absolutely requisite to your satisfactory Lecture.

And first, we crave a due and equitable consideration of our defects and
impediments, to the refraction and lopping off the rigor of your censures; and
to ruminate with an unprejudicial ratiocination upon that known Canon, (...),
That one may sooner find a fault, than mend it.

We confess our selves to have been more than ordinarily conversant in an
uncouth style, in Pleonasms, Aliquando bonus dormitat Homerus.
Tautologies, perturbations of senses, Printers Errata so our Translation in
many places being not ad verbum, but sometimes Paraphrases, rather than
Interpretations. We acknowledge with the Sciolist, Feci nec quod potai, nec
quod volui, It is neither as we would, nor as it should.

The minority of our XXIII.
years proclaims the nerves of our Intellect to be too slender and feeble to
answer the curious expectation of every ones fancy, in rendering a perfect
illustration of every Ambiguity couched in the whole, and our Pencil too rude
and gross to express in our idiome in draughts respondent to the nicety of the
subject; not only in regard of our too frequent submission and stooping of our
most serious cogitations below the dignity and due height of the Authors
strain, but also the vast contrariety between our Granium, and the obscurity
(by reason of the wide admission of variety of Interpretations) of the style,
stuffed with many long Parenthesis, and clouded with dark Enigma's, which we
presume will draw this construction from the Oracle of your Impartial Censures,
that we had the visible appearance of more than one disadvantage to encounter
with.

If we had been cautious to have observed the rule of that known Critic,
Nonumque prematur in Annum; and taken that care that Alexander did in refining
Lapis Lazuli, we should have revised this Tract, but we could not be allowed
that time from the pressure of our Employments; but quicquid in Buccam venit,
and that volante Calamo, being not at all affected with fustian strains,
rhetorical plumes, and intricate tropes.

For the obscureness of our present station, backed with the tenuity of our
fortunes, confining us yet to the constant attendance on, and submission to our
Profession, subjecting us to the observance of an inviduous Phalanthes,
inspired with the flames of self-plaudite, which must needs render us obnoxious
to many more heart-renting distractions, auroral avocations, and nocturnal
interturbations, continually plucking us by the sleeve, and arresting us from
the obtainment of any minute of retirement for lection; which we hope your
candor, Sirs, will confess to be the causation of those many Errata's, which
will appear as so many black patches upon the soil of our Physiognemie, to the
observation of the austere and curious, often meditating on the Poets
confession; Cum relego, scripsisse pudet, quia plurima cerno
Me quoque quae fuerant Judice digna lini.
As also the natural sedentary condition of our life, which has made the
wheels of our Intellect to jar, by warbling out a Chorus of confusion, instead
of Trisagions of harmony, which has begulfed us into a Labyrinth of many
private Remora's; the least whereof we presume may draw from your unbiassed
Cogitations a venial excuse for the injury offered our Author, in trajecting
these lines through the sieve of our Crebrosity.

Yet be it as it will, we have assayed and put our self upon the Stage, and are
resolved, velis, nolis, audacter studium intrare, with those Eliensian
Wrestlers in Philostratus, boldly to show our selves, arming our interior
Lineaments with this resolve, to abide your censures; though we are not
ignorant what Erasmus said, Nihil morosius hominum judiciis, there is naught so
peevish as men's judgments; sed linguas mancipiorum contemno, and even as the
barking of a Dog, do contemn the scurrilous obloquies of railers and
detracters. And howbeit Stultus labor est ineptiarum, to be busied in foolery
is to small purpose, yet hear Seneca, Burton.
Better aliud agere, quam nihil; better do to no end, than nothing. But it may
be you will infer, it is actum agere, Loco citato.
Cramben bis coctum apponere; ay but Nihil praetermissum quod quovis dici
possit. Go then, and censure, criticize, and rail.

We question not but if our Head had been decked with the title of Honorable,
Worshipful, Doctor in Physic, Master of Arts, etc. it had been well enough;
yet for all this, we shall think our selves not a little offended, if we should
be debarred from admission into their Libraries.

Be pleased to accept of this our ingenious confession, and then with the
greater encouragement we shall conclude, by craving pardon in the lines of
Medeas. -- Illud jam voce extrema peto,
Ne, siqua noster dubious effadit dolor,
Muniant in animo verba, sed melior tibi
Memoria nostri subeat, haec irae data
Obliterentur --


And out of an assured hope and confidence thereof, we will begin with our
Author.

R. TOMLINSON.

The Author's EPISTLE, by way of Preface, to the Reader.
COURTEOUS READER,
HEre thou have a large Dispensatory, or, if thou will, the Universal Doctrine
of the Medicinal Art; which yet scarce was ever congested into one Work, or
digested into an exact Method, as to make the Art perfect. This, I say, is the
firstborn of Curative Medicine, which I may term, The Physicians Right Hand,
or Skilful Artificer; not only preparing Salutiferous Antidotes, but also
directing how they should be exhibited and applied; demonstrating Salubrious
Remedies for the curing of every Malady: To thee therefore (Courteous Reader)
have I dedicated these my Labors; endeavoring to purge the whole Body of
Pharmacy from the Errata's of the Ancient Graecians; and also, from the
obscurity of the Idiome of many other Barbarous Nations, that have been famous
for Physicians; and have compiled the abstract of all into this Method, which I
hope I may term, The most absolute of any yet extant.

Though I am not ignorant, that there are many Books extant in Latin, that
handle the Pharmaceutical Art, which Fernelius has augmented by many Precepts,
Sylvius illustrated with several Preparations, Rondeletius with Compositions,
and Wekerus with Confections; yet (without ostentation do I speak it) none but
may modestly be reproved; each describing many Compound Medicaments, whose
Simples they knew not, neither could they render a Reason or Method of the
Composition. I have not here prescribed any thing, but that both the aforesaid
Scruples may be satisfied; neither can any doubt (how ignorant soever he be)
how to select, prepare, and mingle his Simples, because these things are
clearly enough demonstrated and explained, not only from my own particular
knowledge, but from the famousest Physicians in Paris (of which I acknowledge
my self the least) which may contend with the greatest part of Europe, for the
ablest Doctors in Physic: for as many Physicians as there be, so many Oracles,
so many Apollo's, so many Princes in Physic, which have made famous the Art,
both by Teaching and Curing; sparing no Pains nor Cost to adorn Lutetia with
merited Renown: for scarce have our Colleagues any spare hours allotted from
their quotidian Avocations to the visiting of the Sick.

Yet notwithstanding the pressure of my Employments in particular, and
defatigable diuturnal Labors, I have endeavored to illustrate the
Pharmaceutical Art, in this Method thou now see it in.

The whole Work is divided into two Parts: the first contains Pharmaceutical
Institutions, or the Theorical part of Pharmacy; the latter, An Apothecaries
Shop, or Practical part of Physic: Between these two, are contained three
Books of Medicinal Materials, which are, as it were, subservient to them both;
demonstrating such matter as the Institutions require, and explaining such as
is expedient to be used in the Shop; which I have so placed, that thereby every
Simple which ingredes the Compositions, may be dignoted in its nature and
quality.

Now in the first Book of the Institutions, is handled the manner of Electing
Medicaments; in the second, the preparation; in the third, the Composition; in
the fourth, the Rules to be observed in Compounding them; and in the fifth, the
Forms of Remedies are prescribed. To these are subjoyned other three Books,
treating of Plants, Minerals, and Animals: and lastly, The Shop, or Antidotary,
divided into Two Parts; the first Treating of Medicines to be inwardly taken;
the latter, of such as are to be outwardly applied: which are again divided
into three Books; and subdivided into several Sections, by reason of the
variety of the matter handled, and for the more elegant disposing of the Method
prescribed. All which (Good Reader) I desire thee kindly to accept of; and
what I have delivered, to take in good part. Farewell.

RICHARD JACKSON Master of Arts, and Student in Philosophy, TO The Gentlemen of
England.
GENTLEMEN,
HEalth is the only Diamond of Price and Dignity, which deserves to be pursued
with all manner of Expense, whether of Time or Money, Pain or Labor, Sweat or
Blood; and purchased at any peril; rather hazarding Life, then not to have it:
for without it, all lawful sensualities, together with Science and Virtue, do
vanish or cloy, (Morborum fastidiis ipsum animum in perpetuam sui
contemplationem mancipantibus.) And life it self becomes so noy some and
injurious, that the most notable and ingenious Cynick, answered the salutation
of Speusippus, crying from his Litter (wherein he was carried, because of his
Dropsy and Disease, All hail to thee Diogenes; not without some scorn or
exprobation, viz. And to thee, no Health at all, who from weakness of mind, or
cowardice of heart, endurest such a wretched condition, as willingly to
continue languishing in the want of it. Health then being of all mortal
Excellencies most desirable; and, according to that Philosophical Axiom (
Plut. (...)) Health is Precious and desirable, and easily alterable. Those men
are highly to be praised, who have endeavored any thing for its Recovery or
Preservation: for though some wandering Empiricks, and Quacksalving
Mountebanks, have impaired the Reputation of the Physical Profession, as
appears in the History of Alexander the son of Podalirius, who (to one
complaining of his stomach) (...). (...). Willing to prescribe him a Sows foot;
he so expressed it, as if the choice had been Mysterious and Divine: whereas
the imitation of him in this our latter Age, in singling out such Drugs, as the
Foot of a Tortoise, the Dung of an Elephant, the Liver of a Mole, so strange
and monstrous Trash, seems rather to savor of Chaldean Charms, or Magical
Spells, then of any curious Art, or solid Science: It being absolute folly,
according to the purest Philosophy, both Greek and Latin, to persuade a man to
his Profit, by ways and means never understood or apprehended, (Terrigenam
Herbigradam, Domiportam sanguine castam.) Yet there is no question, but that
amongst so many of Natures Works, there are some things proper for the
preservation of our health, as salt water serves the Stork, or the herb
Dittany the wounded Goat, had we but skill to cull out and apply them; and if
the Sow, the Goat, and the Tortoise, by indivinable instinct, be directed unto
them; why should we, or how can we think or imagine, but that there is an Art
of it, which advanced Asclepius unto divine honors? And though its incertainty
has abated of its estimation, arising not only from the diversity of
conceptions, in such as Hierophilus, Asclepiades, and Erasistratus, Diocles,
Strato, and Hippocrates; but also the consideration of so many external
circumstances, as of the nature of the place, the condition of the Air, the
quality of the Weather, the situation of the Planets, and their efficacious
influence upon the inferior Bodies, which seem necessary to direct their
design aright, in an assured aim at the end hoped for, or intended; and most
especially, Ex multitudine artificum and imperitia plerisque ad ea quae
promittunt rudibus, and vanum modo nomen (quo commendentur lucri and laudis
avidi quaetemibus) yet has Renodaeus so restored it in the Parmaceutical part,
(most essential to the Profession, both by his Theoretical Institutions, and
Practical Directions, proper and necessary for every Apothecary) that he
seems fully to have answered Apollo's expectation, in such a studious
Recovery of those collapsed Arts, as shall render every Apothecary inexcusable,
if he err in composing his Drugs; and wilfully obstinate, if without this
Book, to the detriment of others, he shall presume to exercise his own Art, in
singling out, preparing or mingling of those simples which he must make use of:
It being, by the Renowned Author's Lucubrations, a Book no less useful for him,
then is Horace or Homer for a Paedant, or a Breviary for a Romish Priest. In
which sense, it recommendeth it self to the serious perusal of every Gentleman,
who is not sottish or infrunite; both to secure his own health, and to see into
the ostentatious shifts of many self-over-weening Novellists; who, with a
Doctorly arrogance, presume to direct their notes unto their Apothecaries,
which they cannot well or safely perform, without the assistance of a
Pocket-Breviate, or the pretty Compendium of some such Dispensatory; which
insinuates the deserved Commendation of the Juvenile Author, in making such
judicious choice, and managing the Translation with such care, pains, and
industry, as has overcome the difficulty of the style, and the variety of
interpretations, which the ambiguity of such phrases and sentences does afford;
keeping himself (so far as my importunate occasions would admit of serious
perusal) close to the Authors sense, and polishing the same with an English
Elegancy, which might have induced the learned Doctor to have renounced his
Lutetian Privileges, for the rich Freedom of London, and rare Liberties of
England: Of all which, this ingenious Translator (Mr. Richard Tomlinson) has
faithfully labored to make him free Denizon; which, in all probability, will
redound to the utility public, no less then to the private interest of his own
Tribe: according to the desire of

(Gentlemen) Your cordial Friend, and spontaneous Well-wisher to the Common
Good, RICHARD JACKSON, Master in Arts, and Student in Philosophy.

secondly, to prepare; thirdly, to mix Medicaments: for in these three things
consists the whole Body of Pharmacy; which affords a wholesome Remedy to every
Disease; for Nature (the best Parent) in her Physical operation has opposed a
Contrary to every thing: but through imbecility; or some other accident,
cannot always attain to the end for which it was Fernel. praefat. 4. l. ad

ordained; for man's life being short, sooner yields to Fate, tha^ it can
attain to Art; which was the reason why Hippocrates complained, (Epist ad
Dameget) that he was an old man, and had not yet acquired the end of Physic.
And truly no wonder; for this Art is very long and difficult, treating of all
sublunary things created for man's supportation; Aristot. l. 5. polit.
primarily, for nutriment; secondarily, for cure, or any help conducing to
health.

The Materials therefore of Medicine are many, The matter of Phyfick is large.
and almost innumerable; insomuch that the Bowels of the Earth do swell
therewith, and its superficies decked and adorned with variety of Herbs and
Flowers, as with an Ornament; nothing flies or does move in the Air, nothing
grows or does swim in the Seas, which may (...) be made use of to humane
remedy; for health many times is maintained and procented by most vise and

(...) then is to be deemed praise worthy, and esteemed of honorably, which
affords and ministers the Instruments of Medicine, to wit, Drugs; for the
sacred Scriptures show, that they were not only extant from the beginning, but
also Eccles. 38. chap.
created of the most High for the good of man: for God created all living
Creatures, Vegetables, and Medicinal materials, purely for the service of man;
out of which, our Fore fathers, by their industry, (out of regard to their
healths) found out many occult virtues, and thereby prolonged their lives to
old age.

King Cap. 20. l. 4. Reg.
Ezechias was sick even to death, and was recovered by the prescript of Isaiah,
with a Plaster made of Figs, and applied to the place affected.

Mithridates freed himself from all pestilence and poison, with an Antidote of
his confection, which derived its name from him; insomuch that being not able
with Poison, he put a period to his days with his own Sword.

Emperors in time past thought it a Princely thing to prepare and carry about
them certain convenient Medicaments upon all occasions and accidents, Reges
olim multa medicamenta parasse.
and withal to present them to those persons, of what degree soever, whose
favor they sought for, as a sufficient inducement to an obligation of
gratitude. For this end and purpose Cambyses sent Unguents and Spices to the
King of Egypt, (as a Present becoming so sublime a Person) therewith to
preserve his health. For it is more safe for a King or Captain in his Tent to
want his Backler and Helmet, than salubrious remedies fit and convenient for
all accidents of Ware hence many wise men have more estermed of wholesome
Medicines, than a rich Treasure. It is reported of Dariue, that he so much
valued a certain Balsam, that he not only reposed it amongst his precious
goods, but preferred it before all his outward enjoyments. We read the same of
the Emperor Tiberius, who always carried with him Trochisks, a certain
epidemical remedy.

Kings also are wont not only to command a Box or Bottle of Oil and Balsam, to
be ready in their Tents, but also a whole Apothecaries Shop, furnished with
variety of operating Medicaments for help and comfort, whereby they have
oftentimes freed themselves and Army from great perils that would otherwise
have accrued, and sometimes from death it self.

Hence Physicians are called. Dii ^ntelarii, Medici D^orumfilii.
Tutelary Gods; or; as Gul^^ has it, ^. de med. c. 3.
the Sons of Apolle: hence Heraphitus calls L. 6. co^^p. med. locis.
Medicaments, Gods omnipresent hand, which frees the fick from the danger of

called (...), i e. equal to God, because it is endued with power to operate, as
from a Deity. And in Mirepsius, another Antidote is called L. 2.45.

Theodoretos, i. e. the gift of God, by reason of its excellent virtue incuring
internal and external maladies.

This medicinal Art does prepare and afford infinite Medicines of admirable
virtue, and wonderful operation, which no public City, nor private Family can
want, without manifest prejudice, and great detriment to the preservation of
their healths; nay, it is of such a transcendent worth, that God would not have
his Tabernacle destitute of this Art; and therefore Exodus c. 30. Unguentum
sanctum.
Moses anointed it with holy Oil, compounded of Myrrh, Cinnamon, Calamus,
Cassia, and Oil.

Joseph also had Pharmacy in great esteem; for when his Father Jacob dyed, (
Genesis 50.) he commanded his Servants and Physicians to imbalm his Corpse. Is this
Art therefore to be contemned and despised, that is by Holy Writ thus honored?
which affords to the sound a preservative, to the sick a remedy, and to the
dead honor and renown.

CHAP. II. What an Apothecary is, and ought to be; and what also is his
Subject, Object, and End.
AS a Surgeon takes his denomination from his Vocation, Chirurgus quis
dicatur, quid praestat.
or Art, whereby he cures external distempers dexterously, quickly, safely, and
easily: so does the Pharmacopoean derive his name from the Physic which he
makes, or rather aptly compounds into a convenient Medicine. So also is the
Druggist nominated from those Simples and Drugs he sels; as the Apothecary from
the Apothectes, or Shop where his Medicines are placed; who in times past was
called a Seplasiary, from Seplasia, a Marketplace in Capua, where the best
odoriferous Unguents are made. But these names are often used indistinctly, and
the concertation about the bare denomination, is vain and frivolous, when the
substance is in handling.

Probity is not so requisite in a Philosopher as an Apothecary, Vitae probitan
in Pharmacopaeo desideratur.
whose sole work is to prepare Medicines for the Physicians administration,
either for preserving, or procuring health, for in his hands consists health
and sickness, life and death; and he has free power in the composure of his
Physic, not only to obstruct the current of health, but also deprive us of
life, when he is wickedly bent thereunto, either out of malice or ignorance; so
that if Hippocrates be benest and upright, it is no matter if Socrates be a
Knave.

But first of all, What conversation an Apothecary ought to be of.
an Apothecary ought to be a Lover of Piety, one that fears God, void of Envy
and Malice, of a found judgment, well skilled in Gra^^ar, of a good
competency; not covetous, p^tient of labor, of great industry, not given to
corpulency and epicurism, one that makes conscienceof his actions; for an
Atheist, as he does not respect the Cueat^^, so neither the Creature; and an
envious man rep^^es at (...) the^^mans good; and a foolish man has an
inseparable property in him, viz. a desire to hurt; and the unskilful thinks
nothings (...) but what he does himself; and the covetous man is good to nooe,
worst to himself; and a poor man is easily corrupted, for need will compel him
to deal distonestry.

They also (...) or thy of the name and dignity of the Profession, who are by
natural jaclination Scoffers, Drunkards, Jesters, Voluptuous, Frroneous,
Garrulous, Impostors, Jugglers, Day lurkers, and Deceivers, who with gilded
pretenses do deceive the Vulgar with trifles, guiles, boastings, va^^promises,
adulation, and lies, cheat them of their moneys, deprive them of their health,
and by their delusion bring their lives in jeopardy. Therefore nothingis more
noxious to the Republic, of a greater stain and blemish to the honor of the
Profession, and scandalous to good Letters, than these kind of men, who ought
to be eschewed as the vilest of Creatures, and their company avoided as
pestilentious.

But whereas the subject of Pharmacy and Medicine is all one, viz. man's body,
as it is capable of health or sickness, the Physician and Apothecary ought to
participate of many good qualities, as prudence, experience, diligence, and
knowledge of Medicaments.

The subject of Pharmacy is the Materials of Medicine; Pharmaciam medicinae
inservire.
the end and scope thereof, the due composure of the same; and the Apothecary
that dares to attempt or assay further, breaks his bounds and limits, and is to
be accounted a Mountebank, a Quack, and Deceiver.

I have known in France many Apothecaries, What Apothecaries are to be looked
on as Deceivers.
amongst whom I found some bold Attempters in the practick part of Physic, who
with flattery, and large promises of great wonders, did deceive the richer sort
of women; whom they did not only deprive of their money, but by exhibiting
incongruous Medicines, operating contra naturaus, without method, or due
observation, left their bodies more diseased, than in statu quo prius.

And others also, who by their cunning sophistry did circumvent certain men of
knowledge and repute, even the Senators themselves, ( Plin. c. 1. lib. 29.) by
stiling themselves Phyficians, Learned men, and the like; they would feel the
Pulse, look upon the Urine, and discourse of the Causes, Symptoms,
Prognostics, and Cure of Diseases; pretend to great things, promise far
greater, and so assert many ridiculous things, and prescribe Medicines that
rather augment than abate of the we he mency of the distomper; and this they
impiously thrust their. Sickle into the Physicians harvest, and most unjustly
exercise Pharmacy, to the great prejudice of many, by confiding in a bare
Recipe; without either giving cause or reason why it ought to be administered;
for we ought not to rest and rely upon the judgment of ancient Sciolists, who
assert merely upon their bare testimony, and single apprehension, certain
Medicines, which may prove benign and agreeable to Constitution at some certain
time; and thereupon pre^und to be safely exhibited at all times, without
advice. As for instance, Lactucae medicamentum esse potest, Alimentum and
venenum.
Lettice unseasonably, and in too great a quantity administered, may as easily
kill as Hemlock; it is both nutrime^^ and poison, accordingly as it is used.
Does not daily experience manifest, that more perish by surfeting, than any
other distemper? Does not Wine (though most agreeable to our nature) destroy
more than War^^ For though it be very cordial, and as it were the (...) and
sanguis senectutis, as it were old men's milk, and restorative to life, yet
taken at an unfit season, and immoderately, proves noxiou^ and destructive.

The office therefore of an Apothecary is only to exercise or compose certain
Ingredients to a medicinal form, The duty of an Apothecary.
and to adhibit them (...) account manner to salutiferous use, according to the
prescript of some ^ilfull Physician: which, that he may with good success
accomplish, and answer the expectation of the Physician, he ought, first, to
select his ingredie^ts; secondly; to prepare them; and thirdly, to compound
them; of which we intend to speak in order. But before we treat of the first,
let us enquire what a Medicament is.

CHAP. III. What a Medicament is, and what an Aliment, and what a Medium
between both.
THE whole Man is a whole Disease, says Hippocrates, (Epist. ad Damog.) for
such is he when he proceeds into the world from the inquination of the womb,
that he is ready for the Physician, by reason of his imperfections and diseases
which he is liable to, either as a consequent from the dissent of the four
qualities, or from the ill use of such things which Nature appointed
for^ut^^ment, but through the abuse thereof causes innumerable Diseases in the
Body; which the medicinal Art (out of a due observation thereof) does
infallibly either prevent or cure, either by the prescript of a wholesome Diet,
or by Medicaments, either internally assumed, or externally applied, as
Hippocrates describes; Lib. de diata, and Gal. de sanis.

And these are either simple, which for the most part Hippocrates used, or
compounded according to Art; they are called Simples, which remain, and are as
Nature produced them; as Cassia, Rhabarb, Polipody, Colocynth, with many
others, which have only obtained their natural composition of the four
Elements. But they are called Compounds, which consist of many Simples of
diverse virtues noited together by Art and Industry.

Now a Medicament differs from Aliment, Medicamentum quid.
thus: for that is called a Medicament, which being either internally assumed,
or externally applied, can work an alteration in our bodies, as Pepper,
Euphorbium, Pelitory, etc.

And that is called Aliment, Alimentum quid.
which internally assumed, does nourish and augment the body, as Bread, Wine,
the flesh of all flying and four footed Creatures, except ravenous and
rapacious; for those Creatures that live by rape, are of an evil humor, and
engender ill blood, and are to be rejected as unclean. And therefore in Divine
Writ, the Israelites were forbidden to eat either Eagle, Vulture, Griffon,
Raven, Hawk, or the like; and we, according to this Sacred Decree, do prudently
abstain from the flesh of Foxes, Wolves, Lions, and such rapacious Creatures.

Now the medium between both, Alimentum medicamentosum.
is a medicinal Aliment, which sympathetically partakes of both natures; for it
partly nourishes, and partly alters the body, as Lettice, Radish root,
Gourd, Garlic, and many such like. As there is betwixt Aliment and Medicament
a certain medium, so also is there betwixt Nutriment and Poison; for the one
preserves, refreshes, and augmenteth; the other destroys, kills, and
corrupts; betwixt both there is a Medicament, which does effect neither.

CHAP. IV Of the ancient use of Simples alone, and of their admirable
proprieties.
GAlen observes out of Hippocrates, Lib. de Elem. that a man could never be
sick, if he consisted only of one Element, for then every man's Nature would be
one, the Effect one, the Cause of his return to his natural station one. But
now the absurdity lies in this, that whereas the species of diseases are
infinite, so also the remedies both simple and compound, that are to be
appropriated thereunto, are almost influmerable.

Those Medicaments that are compounded, and yet fearmed simple, are but
comparatively and improperly so styled, in as much as they are referred to
others more compound, as Oximel simplex, Diaprunum simplex, and the like: but
the Rose, Endive, Psantain, Mine, Wormwood, and all kind of Vegetables that
are created, which have received no composition or mixture by Art, are properly
called Simples by Physicians; which they sometimes use alone, as the juice of
Plantain for astringent Lotions; the juice of Water Lillies ad Erysipileta, or
St. Anthonies fire; the juice of Betony the Canker, with which it has an
admirable sympathy; the juice of Vine-tendress, by Galens advice, against the
Shingles; the fresh or meat of Quinces, applied plaisterwise to the region of
the stomach, against choler, and assumed against the bloody flux, the body
being first purged; as also Betony against Cephalalgia; as almost all Plants to
the expelling of most Diseases.

That which is recorded of many Plants exceeds credit, which produce admirable
effects; for the root of Peony applied to the head, or hung about the neck,
does cure the Epilepsy; Mint put into milk hinders its coagulation and
condensation into Cheese, as it has been proved by men of good credit.

The herb AEthiopis (if Fliny speaks true) cap. 4. lib. 26. Herba Ethlopidis.
will pull off Iron if it be touched; which Matthiolus also asserts of the herb
Lunary, or Moon-wort, which because it wresteth off Iron shoes from traveling
horses, is called by the Italians Sferra cavallo.

The Author of Libri sanitatis does aver with Tribius, that the Bird called
Pie, shutting the orifice of her nest, can cause the doors to fly open only by
the touch of a certain herb; some attribute this virtue only to the Bird,
others to the herb. Theophrastus, a most skillful Herbalist, makes mention of a
certain herb, which so powerfully provokes to Lustful Couplation, that if the
Noble Author speaks true, it is more than credible that Nature has devoted
this to the cold and weak constitutions, as the Nymphea to the lecherous.

Clymenum rubrum, or Pile wort, Herba Ficeria.
has such power in curing the Piles, that whosoever carries with him the root of
this herb, shall be preserved safe from this Disease. It is scarce credible,
that which Josephus writes of that admirable Plant which is called B^ard, from
Baaran a Valley of Judaea, which being sprung out of the earth, does cast out a
certain bright fulgur, and in the night shines like a burning Lamp; which
cannot be touched by any, unless it be first wet with urine, or woman's blood,
for otherwise who ever touches it, presently dyed; but by the before said
sprinkling, it may be cradicated, by which it loses its destructive quality.
And that which was most wonderful, it cured Mad men, and Demomacks; which when
the Inhabitants adjoining perceived, they very discreetly tied a Dog fast to
it, which incited or compelled by hunger, or called upon, with much struggling
pulled up the Plant.

Many other Miracles does God work in this his Foot stool, the estimation
whereof, Experience alone does teach. Yet has he produced nothing any way
noxious to Mankind, to which he has not ordained a convenient and wholesome
Remedy; Contrario contrarium Deus opponit.
for he opposes one Contrary to another, and one Dissentany to another. As to
the herb Wolfs-bane he has opposed Aristoloch. Long. to Hemlock, Smallidge
seed; to Henbane, Garlic; to Helmet-flower, Radishseed; to a Viper, wild
Bugloss; to Scorpions. Trefoile or Jasmine; the root of which does vindicate
and preserve the Bearer from bitings by Scorpions, or frees him from pain that
is bitten; his hands also that are anointed with the juice of May weed, cannot
be stung with Bees or Wasps.

It will not be beyond our scope here to take notice of the various natures of
Plants; for some are green, and flourish in the middle of Winter, as
Wolfs-bane, and black Hellebor; other Plants in the Equinoctial, or Spring
tide; others in the heat of Summer, and some in Autumn; at which time all
others are, for the most or greatest part, deprived both of leaves and flowers.

CHAP. V. Of the matter of Medicaments, and whence it proceeds.
THE principal differences of medicinal Ingredients, as well foreign as
domestic, are taken either from their matter or faculties. From the Matter,
which according to Dioscorides and Galen, is threefold; whereupon three
general differences of Medicaments do arise, to wit, drawn either from Plants,
Minerals, or Animals.

In the first genus are contained all kinds of Plants, Medicamenta en plantis
sumpta.
their several parts, and what is deduced from them, as roots, barks, stalks,
woods, boughs, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, gums, rosins, juices, drops,
liquors, missel-dews, mosses, cottens, nuts.

In the second are contained the Elements themselves, as Fire, Flame, Smoke;
Air, serene, or turbid, hot, cold, moist, or dry; Water, pleasant, salt, winy,
saltish, clammy, sulphurous, tasting of Nitre, Brass or Iron; all kinds of
Earth, as Bole, Terra Lemnia, Mellitea, Chymolia, Rubrica, Ampelitis, Erithrea,
Ochra, Creta, and in a word, all Minerals which are dug out of the Bowels of
the Earth; as the several kinds of Stones, as the Lapis Ethites, Cyaneus, seu
Lazuli, Metalla septem.
Judaicus; as also Metals, which are acknowledged by all to be seven, Gold,
Silver, Tin, Lead, Iron, Copper, and Quicksilver, according to the number of
the Planets, whence according to the Spagyrians, they borrow their names. These
also are improperly referred to the Minerals, Bistumen Petrol, all kinds of
Salts, Calchanth, and Amber.

In the third genus are contained all Animals, whether Integrals, Medicamenta
ex animalibus sumpta.
or In-parts. Integrals, as an old Cock in pottage, to make the belly laxative,
and to nourish the body; a Swallow eaten, for to quicken the eye sight; a
roasted Lark, against the Colic; Crab fishes, for such as are in
Consumptions; old Scorpions, against their bitings; Cantharides, for Ruptures.

Parts of Animals, as the brains of Sparrows against Stimulum veneris, Hairs
brain, against Toothache in Children, Fox lungs against the consumption of the
Lungs, Wolfs liver against the consumption of the Liver, an Asses liver against
the Epilepsy, the intestines of a Wolf against the Colic passions, the back
of Stinci marini against the stifness of the Yard, Goats blood against the
Stone, Partridge or Kites gall to clear the eyes, Cran. Human. against the
Falling sickness, the bone in the heart of a Heart against doting or roving,
Boars tooth against the Plurisy, an Elephants tooth to corroborate the heart,
Monoceros or Rhinoceros horns to infringe Poison, an Elks hoof against the
Falling sickness.

There are also yet many other parts of Animals, whence Medicaments are
assumed, as Marrow, Suet, the fat of Calves, Hearts, Hogs, Kids, Ducks, Capons
and Geese, the milk of Women, Asses, and Sheep, Cheese, Butter, Curds, Cream,
Whey, Butter-milk, Hens eggs, Fish-shels, the hairs and other excrements of
Animals, which we particularly prescribe in the composition of Medicaments in

CHAP. VI. Of the faculties of Medicaments, and how many sorts there be
accordingly.
THE faculty of a Medicament is a certain efficient cause, What the faculty of
a Medicine is.
on which its action depends, ( Gal. l. de plenitud. and lib. 1. de simp:)
whence we gather, that the faculties are answerable in number to the actions,
as it is demonstrable in Aloes, and many other simple Medicaments; Aloes
facultas.
for Aloes has a faculty of purging, corroborating the Ventricle, killing and
expelling Worms, and exiccating the humors of the head.

Every Medicament therefore, as to its faculty, is threefold, alterative,
purgative, and corroborative. That is said to be alterative, which is either
internally assumed, or externally applied, and so does work a manifest mutation
on our bodies, and that according to Fernelius, either in temperament, Tertia
medicamentorum alterantium.
in matter or form; whence arise three kinds of alterative Medicaments; first,
that which impensly heats, cools, moystneth, or dries; secondly, that which
changes the commoderation and consistency of the matter: so as either too much
to obdurate or mollify, too much to rarify or condense, too much to bind or
loose, too much to thicken or attenuate; thirdly, which corrupts or weakneth
the substance or form it self, such as besides their manifest quality, whereby
they heat, erode, refrigerate, or stupify, by a certain occult propriety, and
so destroy the substance it self, and induce corruption with nauscousness, as
Cicuta, Anchora, Napellas, Aconitum, Sublimatum, and many more; some are
noxious to the whole body, as the forenamed; others to certain peculiar parts,
as the Sea-hare to the Lungs, Cantharides to the Bladder, Wolfs-bane to the
Womb, Hemlock to the Brain.

The roborative, Roborativum quid.
or as vulgarly termed, strengthening Medicament, is that which with or by a
certain propriety respects Corroborates, and conserves some part of our body,
as Cephalic medicaments to the head, Otick to the ears, Ophthalmick to the
eyes, Odentick to the teeth, Stomatick to the mouth, Stomachick to the stomach,
Cordial to the heart, Hepatick to the liver, Splenetick to the spleen,
Nephritick to the reins, Hysteric to the belly, Nervical to nerves; of which
or most shall be spoken to in their places.

The Cathartick or purgative Medicament is that which extracts a vicious and
excrementious humor out of the body. Catharticum quid proprie.
Now that which promiscuously and generally expels all humors out of the body,
cannot truly be called purgative, as Antimonium, Cataputia major, and the like,
but such as educes and purges proper and congruent humors, to which its
faculty is directed and ordained; for those more violent Medicaments do often
precipitate us to death, of which Galen speaks, when he Cap. 2. lib. de vi^t.
^cut.
says, that a Purge has a certain deletary and poisonous quality; which
Actuarius thus confirms; Purgative Medicaments in a general notion (says he)
are accounted to be such as procreate destruction, and by most adjudged
deletary, poisonous, and mortiferous: but they differ from those which are
absolutely poison, or of greater power to hurt, in that they kill rather by
quantity, than corrupting.

And there is such an antipathy betwixt our nature and Purgations, that the
very smell of them is inacceptable; which no sooner approaches to the nostrils
of some persons, but it affects the whole body; in some it subverts the
Ventricle, and in others it contracts the belly. But of the faculty of Purges,
how it acts, and whence it proceeds, shall be largely treated of in the ninth
Chapter.

CHAP. VII. Of the first and second Faculties of Medicaments.
WHereas simple Medicaments have often two, sometimes three faculties
incorporated, we will speak of them in order. The first is called Simple and
Elementary, which arises from the commixtion of the four Elements. The second,
substantial or material, which proceeds from a commoderation and consistency of
the matter, in which the four qualities inhere in a diverse proportion. And
there is something found besides these, a third, namely purgative, which
Fernelius calls an occult quality. And Sylvius, with others of no mean
knowledge, affirm four qualities to be universally resident in some Medicament,
whereof he asserts the third to be little known, and the fourth altogether
unknown, yet both these are often taken for one and the same: for whatever
Medicament acts by any inexplicable, or not sufficiently perspicuous property,
not proceeding from the first or second qualities, are said to act from the
third qualities, or property of the whole substance, or occult virtue.

The first faculty of Medicaments is common, The first qualities of Medicaments.
and as it were the Basis of the rest, proceeding immediately from the Elements
themselves, and it consists chiefly in calefaction, refrigeration, moystning,
or drying; in every of which it is seen either obscurely, as when it acts in
the first degree; or apparently, as in the second; or vehemently, as in the
third; or perfectly, as in the fourth; and that either in the beginning,
middle, or end of every one: The several qualities of Medicaments.
so that there are twelve orders of hot, cold, moist and dry Medicaments, which
take place amongst them that have conjugated faculties, which are either hot
and moist, or hot and dry, or cold and dry; for they produce these faculties
not only obscurely, manifestly, vehemently, and perfectly, but also gradually,
and that either in the beginning, middle, or end of their operation.

The second qualities are concomitants of the first, Elementary or simple, by
whose help it is that they exist and manifest their virtues; for the faculty of
Apertion, Rarefaction, Attraction, Attenuation, follows Calefaction; the
faculties of Crassitude, Density, Occlusion, and Repulsion, follow
Refrigeration; of Mollification follows Moisture; the faculty of Induration
follows Siccity, for Siccity obdurates, as it is plain with Clay hardened by the
North wind, o^ Summers heat, and brick with fire. As also Humidity mollifies,
while any moderate heat perseveres; for the moisture of Ice becomes hard,
because it wants heat.

The second virtues and qualities are also apparent in austere, sharp, tart,
bitter, opening, attenuating, resolving, contracting, repelling, mollifying,
and casing Medicaments; and do as evidently perform their operation, as the
first or elementary qualities.

CHAP. VIII. Of the third Jaculty, or occult quality of Medicaments.
NOW besides the first and second qualities, there is a third; which being
occult, and inexplicable, no certain account can be rendered of it, nor yet any
exact knowledge thereof be apprehended, but is known only by experience. For
why, the Jasper stone, says Galen, by touching the wound, should stop the flux
of blood, I know not; and if I knew perfectly how to find out the nature of
every thing particularly, I should think my self such an one as I do conceive
Esculapius was. But some properties can neither be known nor explained; for no
man can bring any firm and invincible argument or reason, why those Spanish
flies, or Cantharides, should vex the bladder with an inflammation, or hot
disposition, being applied far from it; The property of Sea-crabs.
or why the ashes of Crabs, being of a drying nature, should have such an
admirable property against the biting of mad Dogs; or why, being mixed with
Gentian or Frankincense, it operates better and more effectually than with
other Medicaments.

Galen admiring the never failing success of this Medicament, busied himself no
little, to find out the cause why, and at length promised to publish a Book
concerning those things that act by an occuit property; but performed not his
promise, perchance fearing lest it might detract from his great Fame, if he
should relinquish his Enterprise imperfect, or not satisfy himself or his
Readers, if he did not with his accustomed learning and dexterity replenish and
accomplish it. The extent of the third faculty.
Yet this third faculty is very ample, containing under it Purgatives, curing
distempers by a certain occult virtue, having respect to certain peculiar
parts, of which we intend to discourse particularly. There is in Aliments an
inexplicable quality.


Neither do we acknowledge this inexplicable property to consist solely in
Medicaments and Poisons, whereby the one cures, and the other kills, and
sometimes expels diseases: but also in Aliments, which repair the loss of
strength by that continual Effluvium; for many abhor many meats, which others
take with a greedy appetite; which though at first they are unlike, yet after
many concoctions become like and proper to our bodies; whence arises a great
similitude betwixt the thing nourishing, and that which is nourished, which
scarce can be defined; and why this man is more delighted with this meat, and
that with another. The eating of fish and flesh is familiar to our whole
Nation, yet have we known many, faith Amatus Lucianus, who altogether abstained
from eating of flesh; and others, Historia notat^ dign.
to whom not only the eating, but also the very smell of Cheese was as poison.
Another have we known, a Spaniard by Nation, who never tasted of Fish, but when
he was invited by his Friend once to a Supper, and had eaten Eggs, with which
the ashes of dried Fish was cunningly mixed, he fell into such a pain and
anguish by vomiting, that he was almost killed thereby. The same famous Author
also saw another, a Venetian Monk, in whom the smell of Roses would cause
Madness; which also I have observed in a Noble Lady. And Julius Scaliger, in a
learned Cardinal, as he affirms in his Exercises against Cardan, viz. (Exercit
153. part. 10.) where he commemorates a certain woman of excellent virtue and
beauty, named Francis, who could by no means be persuaded, before she was
fourteen years of age, to eat Flesh. He affirms also, that one of his Children
as much abhorred Cabbages, as himself did the Cressons. As also a maid in the
City Mediolim dyed with a draught of Cassia fistula; for every man's peculiar
appetite is proper to himself; and many eschew Wint as Poison, others adore it
as their God.

Moreover, this inexplicable occult faculty is observed in the food of other
Animals. For who by reason can declare why the Ostrich delights in Iron? why
the Heart desires Serpents; the Bear, Ants; the Ass, Ferula. Some Animals live
only by fishing, others by hunting, others by Corn, others by the natural
increase of Plants. The Mallet devours the bird Hirron; the Beaver, little
Fishes; the Hawk, the Eagle, and Fox, are nourished and fed upon little Birds;
the Hen, the Partridge, and the Horse, on Corn; the Ox, Deer, and Heart, on
little Plants, or their tender parts. And why these do delight and grow fat
rather with that Aliment than this, and those rather with this than that,
cannot easily be explained by reason. For the Vulture will sooner perish with
Faraine, than touch Wheat; the Pheasant rather dye, than eat by stealth.

CHAP. IX. Of the faculty of purging Medicaments, whence it proceeds, and how
it operates.
THE disquisition of the faculty of purging Medicaments has been the exercise
of many ingenious men; and yet nevertheless, as many men as have endeavored
after its knowledge, so many several opinions have they left to us their
Posterity. The Alcumists not without some pains endeavor to demonstrate, that
it proceeds from the saltness of the Compounds; for they lay down this for a
general Axiom, that all Salts are purgative. Others maintain, that this faculty
is altogether occult, not apparently explicable by reason. There are others who
judge, that it arises from the special temperament of the mixture, or compound.
Others look upon it as a fifth quality. Mesue would have its original in
Heaven, and calls it a Heavenly Faculty. A purgative Medicine (says he) is not
such from its temperament, not as a Contrary acting upon its Contrary, not as a
Simile attracting its Simile, nor as a heavy matter driving the humor
downwards, nor as a light substance driving it upwards; but it has this
faculty allotted from above, acting by a Divine power.

This Celestial Faculty is also by some Medicks, (Fernel.) and Philosophers,
(Scaliger) called an Occult Faculty; sometimes also the property of the matter
alone, sometimes the internal principle of every thing, The diverse
denominations of this quality.
sometimes an unknown cause, a super-elementary virtue, a property of the whole
substance, and by some, a fifth quality; so that one and the same thing has
diverse denominations.

But because that this purgative virtue, according to Philosophers of best
note, must needs be deduced from the Stars, Mesue calls it most properly
Celestial; but he aims amiss in judging that it draws out humors, not as a
simile attracting its simile, contrary to the Ancients opinions, reason, and
experience. For Hippocrates declares, (lib. de not human.) that purgative
Medicaments have a certain congruity with the humors: A Medicine (says he)
when it is assumed into the body, first attracts whatsoever is consonant, and
most like to its nature in the body, and afterward draws down and purges away
the rest.

Which he proves clearly by this elegant comparison; As seeds and plants sown
and eradicated in the ground, attract to themselves whatever in the earth is
congruent to their nature, whether sharp or pleasant, bitter or salt, or
whatsoever else they primarily or chiefly allure, as having propinquity with
their essence.

Galen demonstrates this more clearly, illustrating it with many evidences, (
lib. 1. de not. facult. and cap. 23. lib. 3. de simplic. and lib. de There.)
writing in express words, that the operations are effected and perfected by the
property of the qualities, which are in the substances: therefore some
purgative Medicaments, if perchance they be frustrated of their acquired
purgation, do not hurt the body (as some foolishly have imagined) but become
nutrimental; others are turned into corruption and poison, yet a poisonous
virtue is not always mixed with them. Wherefore they do not always hurt, when
they do not purge, but they concoct and produce such humous as they should have
educed, which never happens to stronger Medicaments.

Therefore purgative Medicaments, by a certain similitude and congruity to the
substance, attract and educe humors, and by the same principle that the
Loadstone attracts Iron, and Amber Straw, not Iron the Loadstone, or Straw
Amber: for although there be a great similitude betwixt the Loadstone and the
Iron, yet every simile is not the same, neither is the Loadstone Iron, nor the
Iron a Loadstone; yet the thing attracting should be more potent than the thing
attracted, and therefore the Iron, as weaker, is drawn, and draws not.

Since Traction comes by the similitude of the substance,

I answer; One and the same thing does not draw the same,

Although all Catharticks do attract humors, Quae purgant trahendo.
yet some of them do purge more especially by attraction, to wit, such as are
of a more potent force, and have an excrementious humor, says Mesue, as
Scammony, Turbith, and Euphorbium; others by repression, Quae comprimendo.
as all the five Myrobalans, and Rhabarb; others by loosning and mollifying the
belly, as Cassia, Tamurinds, and others, Quae lubricando.
which only by leniating and solving the belly, educe humors; as the herb
Orage, Violets, Mallows, Sorrel, and many Pot Herbs.

CHAP. X. Of Medicaments, which besides their solution of the Belly cure many
diseases, by an occult poperty.
Medicinal Materials, are as well innumerable as admirable, which assumed at
the mouth, or applied to the external parts, by a certain occult virtue and
specifiall propriety perfectly cures: and undoubtedly preventeth present, and
future distempers: or produces other admirable effects; as before in some few
we have demonstrated.

This occult faculty also is not only discernable in plants, but also in
animalls, and minerals. For it is recorded that Pirrhus his thumb, by touching
such as labored under the distempers of the spleen, cured them; and that most
Christian, and potent Monarch of France, cured the Kings Evil, with the touch
of his hand: this occult and most effectual quality, Os Aurum trabens.
is also seen in dead bodies: for Simplicius affirms, that the mouth of the
fish Milvus, does draw Gold, to which also Scaliger sets seal. Exercit 102. and
112: The reins of Scincus Marinus pulverized, and drunk, with wine, or
commixed with fit conserves and so taken, does cause stiffness of the yard, and
powerfully provokes to Lechery.

A Hearts pizzle dried, pulverized, and drunk with Coltfoot or Carduus water, is
much commended against the Plurisy.

A Boares tooth pulverized and drunk, works the same effect, especially if
taken at the beginning of the disease.

The Monocerces his horn does admirably defend the heart from poisons, and is
much available in pestilent distempers.

The same effects are performed in the use of Hearts horn and Rhinoceroes his
horn. The huckle bone of an Ox pulverized and drunk with Oxymell, does
mitigate the spleen.

The flesh of Hares burnt, sifted and drunk does break and expel stones out of
the bladder.

The skin of a Viper pulverized and Applied to a bald place, does admirably
cause hairs to grow where natural humidity is not too much decayed. The same
effect is wrought by roasted Mice, and anointing the place with honey.

A Cocks comb roasted, or boiled, and often eaten of, does much and effectually
help such as are possessed with Chollicks passions. Galen. lib. de Therias.

A Goats hoof or its bladder, or Egg-shells burned and taken in drink, help
those that piss their beds.

Galen. lib. 8. comp. med. Local. writes, that a Wolfs liver, by a certain
specificall property, will help diseases in the Liver.

An Aspes skin dried, and pulverized, and mixed with honey, will clear the eye
sight.

The excrements of animalls, by an occult property, Creatures Excrements.
expel certain diseases; as the dung of Peacocks the Epilepsy; the dung of
Swallows and Dogs the Quinsy.

Let these few examples suffice, that are assumed from animalls. That I may
omit such as are hurtful, as the Sea Hare, the Crampe-fish. For the one by an
obscure virtue, affecting the Nerves stupifies them, the other hurts the Lungs.
As Cantharides by Inflammation hurts the bladder, and stops the urine, or
causes the strangury.

We may observe also (which is most to be admired) this same occult quality in
many vegetables, and plants: as Sarsaperilla, Lignum vitae, Sasafras and China,
all which by a specificall property avail much in the cure of Lues venerea.

Ragwort or Satirion, and the herb Kocket, The occult property of plants.
causes the yard to stand; irritates Lust, and frequent copulations.

The Chaste tree, Vitex aut Agnus Castus.
and water Lyllyes on the contrary does allay the ardor of Lust, extinguish
seed, and hinder the excretion of the Stones.

Opium mitigates frensy and madness, and procures sleep, though it be taken in
a very little quantity: Misleto of the Oak pulverised and drunk, does
effectually cure the Epilepsy.

Dry grapes by a certain sympathy are very commodious to the Liver.

Staves-acre, by virtue not well known, kills Lice; so Fleabane Gantts.

Coleworth and Ivy cures Drunkenness.

Ptarmica provokes to sneezing. As also both kinds of Hellebor.

Dittany by an occult property pulls out thorns and pricks, if thereunto
applied.

The Ash tree drives away serpents, and cures their bitings.

Stone-crop, Saxifrage, and Goats blood expel stones: Savine brings down the
monthly terms, and the fruit of the womb, whether alive or dead.

The greater Comfrey does speedily close wounds.

Betony does search malign ulcers, and accellerate their cure.

Turpentine is the best Balsam to wounds, and does both speedily and easily
cure them.

But that which is most strange is this: Variety of effects in the self same
plant.
that one plant in a certain part should have one effect, in another, a
different or contrary one: as Chamomile flowers which help the headache by
smelling to them, whose leaves are very hurtful, if we credit Galen. lib. 2.
comp. Med. cap. 2.

Sorrel relaxes the Belly, the seed makes it costick.

The decoction of Colewort solves the belly. But the Colwort it self eaten,
either binds it, or makes it more adust.

As also Cock-broth moves the belly, whilst its flesh binds, and Gal, lib. de
There. cap. 6. assertes the same of Oysters and Cockles.

The wheyish or Butterish part of milk dissolves the belly, the cheesy part
constraines and makes it costick.

Gallen thinks it a miracle that the decoction of Trefoile applied plaisterwise
to the bitings of Serpents and Vipers should presently assuage the pain
thereof, and take out the poison; whereas being applied to a sound part, it
provokes pains, yet the reason of this effect does not seem very obscure, nor
far different from the nature and temperament of other herbs. For it is no
wonder if the Medicine, by whose help, the corrupt part was cured, and from
which it drew some malignity or other, being applied to a sound part, should
leave an impression there of that malignity, whereof it participated.

But we intend to discourse more particularly and largely of the specificall,
and admirable virtue of Quicksilver, in curing the Venerian disease, and of the
occult and almost divine virtues of other mineralls.

CHAP. XI. Of simple Medicaments, which by a specificall property have respect
to certain peculiar parts.
MAny simples are adjoined with such a sympathy to certain Parts; that either
assumed, or applied, or often by their very smell, help, refresh and free us
from diseases. Yet I cannot conceive, that they are for this sympathy and
correspondency so devoted to particular members, as thereon to spend all their
effects, or not to confer any upon other parts, but that by a special faculty
they respect this more than that, and that more than another part.

So that many are called Cephalicks, Cephalica.
or head Medicaments that have their whole substance, congruent and familiar to
the head; So fitted and prepared by the long experience and use of learned men,
that with a certain kind of sympathy, they may be with safety appropriated
thereunto. As amongst aromaticks these following, Musk, Amber, Civet, Cloves,
Mace, Cinnamon, Calamus aromaticus, Squirant, Camphure, and amongst other more
common simples, Betony, Rosemary, Sage, Marjorum, Balm, Staechados, the
Mirtle-tree, the flowers of Betony, Clove-gilliflowers, and Orange.

Ophthalmick, or Eye-medicaments, are these, and such like, Ophthalmica.
Eyebright, Salendine, Fennil, Rue, and Clary; the grains whereof put under the
eyelids, for they are so small that they cause no sense or trouble, purge eyes
exceedingly from corrupt matter.

Those are called Odonticks, which roborate the teeth, Odontica.
and cleanse them, as the Mastick-tree and Myrtle, Sage and Bay.

All dulcid things are agreeable and pleasant to the Lungs; yet a certain herb,
called Lung-wort, by a peculiar faculty is more especially attributed to the
pains thereof.

If Foxes Lungs help, or any way profit Men's lungs, Pulmonica.
as many of the Ancients believed, then it must happen through the familiarity
of the substances; no other reason can be rendered.

Reysons, Figs, Jujubees, Pistac-nuts, Dates and Honey, do somewhat refresh and
benefit the Lungs, and that only by their sweetness; Orrice, Maiden hair,
Hyslop, and Horehound, only by attenuation.

Cardiacks or Cordials, are these and such like; Gold, Silver, Cardiaca.
precious Stones, Cinnamon, and other suavolent Aromaticks; and also Borage,
Bugloss, Carduus, Scabious, Goats-beard, Meadowsweet, Violets, Roses, and
Saffron.

Stomachick, or Medicaments belonging to the Stomach, Stomachica,
are Nutmegs, Mastick, Wormwood, Mint, and Dill; for these by a particular
property help it; and also innumerable more benefit it, but that by heat rather
than any special virtue, as Pepper, Ginger, Mustard, and Wine.

Hepaticks, or Medicaments proper to the Liver, are these; Tansy, Hepatica.
Egrimony, Succory, Fumatory, Rhabarb.

Splenick, or Medicaments proper to the spleen, are Cetrack, Splenica.
Capars, Tamarisk, Epithymus, with many more, which for brevities sake I omit.

Sage, Rosemary, and Primrose, Nervalia.
by a certain property corroborate the Nerves, Ground Pine the Arteries.

I shall not hereunto reduce such as respect several parts; for even a Critic
Reader may be content with these; for a grain of Salt is sufficient for him
that would know its virtue, and learn its taste.

CHAP. XII. Of Amulets, which carried or hanged up, do cure many Diseases by an
occult virtue.
THose Remedies that are called Periammata, Periapta, and Amuleta, that is,
tried and suspended Medicaments, appertain to such as cure Diseases by an
occult faculty: Amulets are of two sorts.
and they are of two kinds; one sort consists solely of characters and words,
another of simple Medicaments hanged about the neck, or any other member of the
body. Physicians laugh at the former, and reject it as a thing fabulous,
delusive, uncertain, and incredulous: for we find, that neither Physician nor
Metaphysician ever spoke thereof, unless some Cacodemoniack, that refers them
to his Philosophy. But a Physician and Philosopher being a Moralist, and an
Advancer of Nature, who in honesty of life and conversation, setting the fear
of the Almighty before his eyes, assayes nothing, but by the just, good and
lawful rule prescribed by Nature, and does not go about to deceive the
ignorant and illiterate people with vain toys, and unlawful Arts; but studies
the knowledge of things by their natural causes: for Knowledge is the
understanding of a thing by its cause; and happy sure is he that knows the
causes of things. Whence Galen concludes, that Medicine is not made for the
Disease, but for the morbificous cause, which being removed, Periammata.
the effect is hindered. But Amulets neither take away the cause, the disease,
nor symptoms, as those falsely persuade themselves, to whom they have been
suspended, being deceived by their persuasion, who worship and invoke Devils;
who also imagine, that all things may be done in their name, and by their
virtue, without any other cause. Of which, and such like impious fellows, the
Poet thus writes: Gens invisa diis maculandi calida coeli,
Quae nunc stare polos and fulmina mittere novit,
Aethera sub terras adigit, montesque revellit.


Which they perform two manner of ways: for some by the virtue of most Divine
names invoke and compel evil spirits, and that because every Creature fears
and reverenceth his name that created: yet others more impious than these
wicked men, submit themselves, offer sacrifice, and worship Devils.

The reason why Witches use only evil spirits, is manifest; for good Angels
are very seldom, Cur cacodaemones ab improbis viris invocentur.
and not without great difficulty obtained, because they wait on Gods command,
and accompany none but such as are of a clear heart, and pious conversation.
But evil spirits do yield themselves prompt and ready to be invoked, falsely
favoring and feigning Divinity, they are always present, that they may
deceive, and that they may be worshipped and adored.

Out of this Shop of Devil-adoring Witches issued all those Books of Darkness,
which Ulpianus by no means will allow to be read, Libri improbatae lectiones
qui.
but ordains that forthwith they be burned. The first Founder whereof was (as
it is recorded) one Zabulus, that was addicted to the illicite Arts. Afterward
succeeded one Barnabas, a Cyprian; and in our times, Cornelius Agrippa, and
many other impious men; amongst which Crew, Paracelsus deserves not to have the
lowest seat, Paracelsi impietas.
whose impiety was accompanied with the baseness of all vices.

Now since that these Characters and Amulets have issued out of these impious
men's Shops, being grounded on no reason, Characteres inde prodterint.
and pestiferous to Mankind, not only Physicians, but also all Worshippers of
God, ought to reject and abhor them.

Yet Fernelius, that excellent Physician and Philosopher, yea, the most famous
of our times, attributes great virtue to Words and Amulets. And certainly if we
assent to the Hebrews, Vis verborum secundum Hebraeos.
the best Authors of Virtue and Discipline, they tell us, we shall find
greater power in words, than natural things; For (say they) whatsoever is in
the mind, voice, word or speech, all that is in Scripture, the letters whereof
are full of beavenly mysteries, are according to the position of the Stars;
whence the great Creator of all things will have himself named by two letters,
A and O.

Furthermore, the more critical Matchiavels of the Hebrews, Literarum figura.
do profess and promise to explain all things by the figure of Letters, and by
the simplicity, composition, crookedness, defect, abundance, colligation,
revolution, coronation, apertion, order, and transmutation of letters, points,
and pricks.

Words therefore and Characters are said to be powerful in the curing of
Diseases: and Trallian omitted not this way of curing. To cure the Gout (says
he) dig up the herb Henbane before the Sun rise, when the Moon is in Aquarius,
or Pisces, and say, Adjuro te, herba sacra, per sancta nomina Jaoth, Sabbath,
Adonai, Eloi, Deus, qui terram firmavit, and fixit mare fluviis abundans
fluentibus, and qui exsiccavit uxorem Loath in statuam salinariam. Adjuro,
inquam, te, ut sistas fluxionem pedum.

For the Toothache this ridiculous speech is given to some, Galbes, galbat,
Galde, galda.

To stay an issue of blood, some use these words, Charat, Cara, Sarite,
Confirma, Consona, Imaholite.

These words are given to some with a piece of bread, against the biting of a
mad Dog, Irioni, Rhiciori, Estera, Rhuder, Fere; or these with a piece of an
apple, Hax, Pax, Max, Deus, Adimax, which he presently eats up.

That of Quint. Serenus of Samos, against the semi-tertian Fever, is well
known, to wit, Abracadabra, which is so described, that it ends broad below,
and strait above, like a Pineapple, even to the last letter, and so it is
annexed to the neck.

A thin plate of Gold engraven with these words, (...), and hung about the
neck, cures bleared eyes, or purblindness, according to Marcellus.

That thou may stay bleeding, touch the part with thy ringfinger, and repeat
these words, Socnon, Socnon, twenty seven times, or as often as thou will, till
the issue cease; it is good; and much profitable, if you rightly consider it.

To cure the Felon, or soar under a man's nail, touch the part with thy finger,
(says Marcellus) and drawing thy finger back again, say thrice, Pu, pu, pu,
Nunquam ego te videam per parietem repere.

So does the same Marcellus foolishly persuade the cure of Lippitude, or
Purblindness. Take (says he) ( cap. 8. lib. de medic.) a Fly with thy left
hand, and whilst thou catchest it, repeat his name on whom thou art to work
this cure, and say that thou catchest the Fly to cure his eyes; then bind her
alive in a linen cloth, and hang it about the neck of him or her that is
affected, and look not behind thee.

Many examples of the like sort may be read in Mercury, Marcellus, Trallian,
Albertus, Villanovanus, and amongst those in latter time, in Fernelius, lib. 2.
de abdit. rerum cause. all which (most sage men) attribute such virtue to words,
that they believe them to be able to subvert nature. Apuleius also, that
learned man, asserts, that by a magical susurration, swift running rivers are
turned back, the slow sea gathered on a heap, the winds unanimously and with
great force sent forth, the sun staid, the stars deduced, the day abbreviated,
the night continued: of which the Poet says, Carmine vel coelo possunt
deducere Lunam, Levis Poetarum credulitas.

Carminibus Circe socios mutavit Ulyssis.
Frigidus in pratis cantando rumpitur anguis,
Atque satas alio vidi traducere messes.
As also Ovid.
Cum volui, ripis ipsis mirantibus, amnes
In fontes rediere suos, concussaque sisto.
Also Lucan.
Cessavere vices rerum, dilataque longa
Haesit nocte dies, legi non paruit ether,
Torpuit and praeceps audito carmine mundus.


But the power of words is most apparent in repelling Diseases; for either
spoken, or engraven and carried, do dissolve many affections with wonderful
celerity, which, as Pomponatus relates, no little exercised a certain
Physicians ingenuity and judgment, admiring such things; for when he had
undertaken the cure of two boys, Historiae notatis dignae.
the one whereof labored under a disease not unlike Erysipely, the other had
fallen into the fire; now a certain man intervening, cured those boys with
words only, and Charms. He adds moreover, that out of another who had a sword
so fastened in him, that it could be got out by no medicinal Art, which
notwithstanding the same man drew out by the same method of curing.

In almost every Town there are certain old women who can cure the diseases of
the Matrix by words unknown to any; for so much they profess and promise, and
sometimes perform, not without great admiration.

I could relate a thousand more examples, which because they are ridiculous and
foolish, I judge them better to be omitted; for in those that are bettered by
these words, either suspended or rehearsed, the cure comes rather by a certain
opinion, than any virtue in them.

One was not ashamed to assert, that he was freed from a Fever by an Amulet,
in which these words were written, Sancti Petre and Paul stultum hunc
persanate, that is, Saint Peter and Saint Paul cure this fool. Another was
restored to health by this Amulet, Rapiat eum Demon and similes ejus, that is,
The Devil take him and such like. But I relate these sore against my will: we
will now turn our discourse to others more approved. Those Amulets which
consist of simple Medicaments, tied or suspended, are not altogether
disapproved of by Physicians; indeed they often produce salutary effects by an
occult property. For Experience teaches us, that the root of Peony hanged
about the neck, cures the Epilepsy; Misletoe will do the same, as also a piece
of an Elks hoof included in a ring. Wolfs dung applied plaister-wise about the
middle, will mitigate the choleric pains, says Aetius, ( cap. 13. tet. 3.
ser. 4.) Their intestines dried, and applied to the belly, have like effects;
the root of Houndstongue hung about the neck, cures the blackness of the
tongue, which the unskilful Vulgars call Canker; for some things of small
quantity and bigness, by contract only produce greatest alterations, says
Galen, ( cap. 5. lib. 6. de loco aff.) Dittany being applied, does by an
incredible property draw out Darts; Quicksilver carried about with us, frees us
from many pestilent Diseases; the stone Aethites bound betwixt the paps, or on
the ventricle, does retain the young; but being annexed to the thigh,
precipitares the birth. Which also is recorded of the root of Henbane. The gem
Selenitis put into a ring, only by touching the flesh, stays blood flowing
from any part. The green Jasper suspended, helps the stomach, and the mouth of
the ventricle, as Aetius testifies, ( cap. 35. tet. 1. ser. 2.) The Heraclean
stone, commonly called the Loadstone, besides its faculty of attrcting Iron,
being only holden in the hand, it eases the grief of the Gout both in the
hands and feet. He that will carry the feet and the forelegs of the Lobster,
he shall not fear the coming of a Boar. See Democritus in Geopon.

The curing of the Jaundies is also to our purpose here; Icteri curatio miranda.
which is then effected, when the diseased attentively beholds that Bird which
Holerius calls Galbula, that is, Woodwall; the French give it the name of
Loriotus. And it is wonderful, that this Bird cannot endure the sight of him
that has the Jaundies.

Also the cure of the bitings of Tarantula, Curatio morsus venenati per musicam.
a beast like a Lizard, has respect to this discourse, which may not be cured
by Medicaments, but only by Music.

I have known and heard of many such like cures, which I omit for brevity sake.

CHAP. XIII. Of Poisons.
THere is also an occult quality in Poisons, of which Physiologers, and
searchers of natural things, do sometimes speak, as also impious Witches: the
Physiologers, that they might acknowledge the prudence and sagacity of the
Omnipotent Nature, in good as well as pernicious things, and contemplate the
Ornament of the World: but those Witches, more pestilent than Pestilence it
self, and most pernicious Enemies of Mankind, that they might exanimate and
extirpate out of the world all those whose life and fortunes they envy or hate.
For they most artificially adulterate the taste, odor, and color of Poisons,
which they so craftily convey into Meats and Medicaments, that they may deceive
the most wise and wary, and in stead of Bread give them a Stone, in stead of a
Fish a Scorpion, instead of Sugar a sugared Poison. And so good men are not so
safe from evil men, as all men from Scorpions, and other destructive Beasts.

Of which the Physician speaks, as the Logician of Sophisms and Fallacies,
which he admonishes us to observe and avoid, as the Theologer speaks of Vice,
which he persuades us to shun. Neither does he treat of evil, that thence good
might follow; wherein he differs from the Physician, who disalloweth of
poysonfull Sorcerers, and yet treats of Poisons, either as they are generated,
or by ill luck ingested into our bodies, or else as they are requisite to the
curing of malign diseases; otherwise to discourse of them, or use them, is
pernicious. And indeed Galen, ( cap. 42. lib. 2. de Antidot.) reproves them
that teach composition of Poisons, Improbantur, qui venena compenunt.
as Horummendesius, Aratus, Heliodorus the Athenian, and Orpheus.

Yet does he himself write largely concerning poisonous Simples, as before him
Dioscorides, and after both Nicander, that they might be known, avoided, and by
the advice of a learned and skillful Physician, used in some diseases. For
Arsenick is sometimes applied to the dead flesh in Ulcers, Vipers oil to
Pocks-marks, pimples, and corrupt swellings; Scorpions oil to their stings; a
hair of a mad Dog to the wound made by his own teeth. Trochisks made of Vipers,
both internally assumed, and externally applied, to all poisonous affections
and diseases.

Poisons also are not only put into, Venena in corpore hominis interdum genita.
but sometimes generated in the body, as Galen, ( cap. 5. lib. 6. loc. aff.)
which produces both like affections and effects, as those that come by
pernicious poison drunk, or otherwise assumed; for a Plague is a Poison which
is sometimes generated in the body without any manifest cause; and the Sperm
retained in Histerick women, is partaker of a poisonous quality. Dogs also in
the heat of Summer easily become mad. But these things are to be fore-known by
Physicians, that they may preserve health without fault, and drive away all
diseases.

And although Poisons be destructive, Venena aliquando nutrire. Historia.
yet by custom they become nutritive; for I think the story of the Girl is
sufficiently known, of which Avicenna, Rufus, and Gentilis speak, who being fed
with Poison only from her Infancy, was so infectious, that her breath was
pestiferous and destructive to such as came near her.

Another woman lived at Coleyn in Germany, who, as Albertus relates, did
usually eat Spiders, whereas one Spider bruised in Wine would kill many.

One Porus, King of India, did daily eat Snakes and Poisons, Rex anguirus.
who being a long time nourished with this kind of Aliment, was so poysonfull,
that he would kill men by his touch or breath, or by his spitting, as a
Serpent, or any other poisonous Creature.

There is a certain kind of men in the Hellespont, Ophiogenes.
who are nourished with Poisons only; and thence they are fitly called
Ophiogenes, that is to say, generated of Serpents.

The Marsians and Psyllians delighted much in the same nutriment, who feared
not at all the bitings and poisons of Serpents; which was experienced in one of
that Family, Exagon by name, who by the Decree of the Roman Consuls was put
into a Hogshead filled with Serpents, who nevertheless escaped without
detriment. ( Plin. cap. 29. lib. 6.)

Athenageras the Grecian, as it is related, could not be hurt by Scorpions. The
same is affirmed of the Ethiopians that inhabit near the River Hydaspes.

Galen makes mention ( lib. 3. simp. cap. 13.) of a certain Athenian woman,
which had often eat a great quantity of Hemlock, without any prejudice to her
health. Sext. Emperic. has the same story of another old woman.

It Is generally reported of Lysis, that she would eat Opium in a great
quantity, without impairing her health; and I saw a woman of Nemaxium, who
daily took half a dram of the same.

A certain maid of Crete did kill several with her looks, and bring boys into
a consumption. What need of more? they that are accustomed to Poisons, are free
from the mischief of them.

Poisons are drawn either from Plants, Whence Poison proceeds.
Animals, or Minerals. From Plants, as from all kinds of Poppy, from Henbane
and Mandrakes; whose qualities, though they be poisonous, yet often times
effectual for curing many Diseases. And those very things which sometimes are
present poison both to man and beast, yet being rightly handled, prepared, and
applied; they are a secure help.

The herb Wolfs bane is poison, Poisons sometimes are mecamental.
yet it is added to Ophthalmick Medicaments; and Hemlock, though poisonous, yet
effectual in extinguishing Tetters, Ulcers, and Leprous spots.

Nerium also drunk in Wine, is good against the bitings of Serpents. House-leek
kills the Ringworm, and spreading soars. All kinds of Nightshade, rightly
applied, does mitigate any pain.

But all these, according to Dioscorides, are poisonous; as also Ranunculus,
Esula, Hermodactylus; yet the use thereof is not only wholesome, but effectual
in many distempers. As also Aconitus, Herba Paris, yea Antimony and Stibium,
and many others, are both medicamental and poisonous, for they both cure and
kill.

Mushtooms also are not altogether Medicaments, but sometimes Aliment, and
sometimes Poison; for by the use of these, five young Students of Paris were
killed; and yet Courtiers are much taken with such Dishes.

I shall not here renumerate other poisonous Plants, which are daily and
fortunately put to medicinal uses, for it may suffice that I have touched upon
a few, because it is not necessary, neither can they all be comprehended in one
Chapter.

Medicaments also are taken from poysonfull Animals; Medicines daily assumed
from poisonous Animals.
for the flesh of Stinci marini is often given to decayed Nature to excite
Venery.

Vipers do admirably benefit such as are leprous; as also Snakes, whose flesh
rightly prepared, is a sure Antidote against many Poisons.

That which is asserted de Dracone marino, Sea-dragon is both Poison and
Aliment.
exceeds credit; for he has a sharp pointed bone upon his back, so noxious to
man, that whomsoever he pricks, is precipitated to death, unless he be helped
in time; yet his flesh is both pleasant and wholesome nutriment, insomuch that
the common sort of Frenchmen call it Flesh of Life. And so it may seem
wonderful, that some Animals do at once suggest Aliment, Nutriment, and
Poison; for some part of them is life, in others death to the Assumers.

Yet it is very strange that poysonfull Animals, whose bodies are enemies to
ours, and present death, should by application safely cure the wounds and
bitings that they themselves have made; and they alone, in many cases, are able
to free us from such wounds, and the perils ensuing. The reason is, because one
simile attracts another to it; and as it were revoking its own substance, frees
the part affected from Poison. So Crocodiles grease cures those that are
smitten by him; and those that are hurt with Scorpions, are cured by the same,
bruised and applied plaisterwise; Mus Araneus will work the same effect, if
pulverised when it has bitten any.

It is also worthy our notice taking, that Poison does not only attract
Poison, but also extract pricks and darts out of our bodies without pain, which
can scarce be by any strength or art effected.

Many small Creatures are altogether noxious to humane bodies, and yet useful
and commodious to health; as Cantharides, the Venomous Fly Buprestis,
Salamanders, Palmer worms, a Sea-hare, a Toad, a Fen frog; for we use
Cantharides, Lizards, Scorpions, and Ants daily and effectually to the outward
parts, but not to the inward; for it is altogether unsafe to put those
Creatures into the body which are naturally endowed with an evil quality. Thus
did one Agyrta, a foreign and unskilful Physician, Idem fecit maledictus ille
Hebraeus Francofurtanus, Aaron vocatus, qui ante biennium ad Cacodaemones suos
abiit.
apply Cantharides to a man well known to be honest, but not wise, who desired
a Medicament to provoke him to Venery; which sent him not to the pleasant
Fields of Venus, but to the Boat of Charon.

Yet there are some, although noxious, which hurt either by biting or touching;
which being prepared by expert Artificers, and prescribed by skillful
Physicians, and opportunely applied, do not only no hurt, but produce
admirable and salutary effects; for Wine, wherein by mischance a Viper had been
suffocated and extinguished, cured a Leper, long before separated from the
society of his Fellow-Citizens. A Snake may perform and effect the same. What
then will their flesh do, skilfully prepared?

Many efficacious Poisons also are drawn from Minerals, Ex mineralibus venena
multa.
and these as well growing of their own accord, as Quicksilver, red Lead,
Parget, Vitriol, Sorry, Sandarach, the Loadstone, crude Antimony, also the
Adamant: as those that are made such by Art, as Sublimate Chalk; Verdegrease,
Ceruse, Aqua fortis, and almost innumerable others, which are much better
unknown, than known; for it is enough to treat of some Simples beneficial to
some Diseases, amongst which some are to be preferred before others, as less
averse to nature, and more conducing to health.

CHAP. XIV. Of the faculties of those Medicaments in general, which are named
from their effects.
WE have before showed, that some Medicaments respect and corroborate some
parts by a specifical virtue, as Cephalic respect the head, Ophthalmick the
eyes, Pulmoniack, Hepatick, the Lungs, Liver, Spleen, and others, other parts,
from whence they had their denomination: Now we shall speak briefly and
generally of such as are named from their effects, that the Apothecary may have
in readiness the name and knowledge of Medicaments, with their respective
quality, to the proposed and desired effects. For since names are the marks of
things, if they be conveniently and rightly fitted to them, they will more
aptly teach, guide, and direct the Artificer.

But almost all Medicaments retain their Greek idioms first imposed on them.
Medicamentorum appellatio a quibus.
Some named from the Arabian Language, have scarce re-obtained their first and
proper euphony; yet have they in process of time been somewhat refined.
Medicaments therefore from their effects are thus named by Classical Authors.

A Medicament is called Cathartick, or purging, because by some way it draws
noxious humors out of our bodies, as by vomiting, or secession.

Physicians call that Cholagogon, or a choler-purging Medicament, which
extracts choleric humors; that which purges phlegm, Phlegmagogon; that which
purges melancholy, Melanagogum; that which purges watery or liquid humors,
Hydragogum; and that which purges all humors, Panchymagogon.

Another Medicament is called Polychrestum, because it is of much use.

Eccoproticon is reckoned amongst the benign Medicaments, and is so called,
because it only moves the dregs.

Those are called Hypercatharctica, or too much purging Medicaments, which
first purge that humor to which it is congruent and familiar, afterward other
humors more apt to follow; last of all, blood; so that they cause the Bloody
Flux.

They are called Emetica, that provoke vomiting, and educe the humors by the
mouth.

They are called Alliotica, that is, altering, which alter any distemper, as
hot alters cold, cold hot, moist dry, Euchyma and Cacochyma, that is meats of
good and evil juice, have respect to aliments, and those are called Euchyma,
which get good blood, those Cacochyma, that get ill blood, they are called
Epicerastica, which afford good juice by little and little, in stead of ill
juice leasurely drawn out, whence comes Epicrasis, that is, a leasurely
evacuation of vicious juice.

That Medicament is called Hypnotycum, which rather causes drowsinesse than
sleep. (Galen. lib. 9. Method.) and that is called Narcoticum, which does not
only cause sleep, but stupidity, and oftentimes Necrosy or death.

That is called Ureticum, which by dividing, relaxing, and compelling the
passages, moves the urine and gravel, and often expells them.

They are called Lithontriptica that is Saxifrage, which break or sever the
stones or pebles in the bladder, and eject them.

That is called Anodynum which delineates and mitigates any pain with a
moderate heat, it is called also Paregoricum, and sometimes Lysiponium that is
a labor easing, or pain mitigating medicament.

That Medicament is in general called Chalasticum, which eases the part to
which it is applied, or refreshes it with moderate heat; but taken strictly it
is that only which relaxeth and cures any swelling, without excess of any
quality, as fat, butter, grease, etc.

That poisonous Medicament, which divides and opens the orifices, and excites
the blood to an issue by its heat or acrimony, is called (...), such as be
Ramsons, Savine, Leeks, Sow bread, and many others.

The Greeks call a repercussive Medicament, (...), because by its refrigerating
and binding power, it repells the humors breaking out into the members: as
Plaintain, Sorbe Ails, the herb Mouse-eare: other repel by a refrigerating
quality only, as water and other such repercussours, Galen. lib. 14. Method.)
but according to Galen and Oribasius, all repelling Medicaments are only to be
used in the beginning of a flux.

That is called Helcticum or Epispasticum which draws the humors downwards;
and it is contrary to repelling Medicaments, for it is hot and thin, but
repercussives, cold and gross Galen. lib. 10. compos. Med. loc. cap. 25. lib.
1. sympos. c. 16. lib. 5. simplic. And every hot Medicament draws, every cold
one repells. That which is hot in the second degree, does apparently draw; that
which is hot in the third partly draws, and partly disposes, and it is called
(...). Now there are four different kinds of attracting Medicaments.
Atrahentia quadruplicia.
Some draw by an Elementary quality, which are hot in the second degree; Others
by accident, as in putrefaction, and of this sort, Leaven has the strongest
attractive quality, others by a certain similitude, as poisons attract poison,
others by an occult property, As Dittany attracts and extracts pricks and
darts, the Loadstone Iron.

That is called (...), which whether internally assumed, or externally applied,
does not only open the passages by attenuation and scowring, but which cutts,
divides, and resolves obvious humors by sweat or breath. Of which there are
two kinds, some weaker called (...) that is relaxing, which indeed are hot and
subtle, but do not dry up, which rather dispose the humors for resolution,
than resolve them: The matter of resolving Medicament is abundant, for all
those that are moderately hot in the second, and hot in the third degree, and
subtle, resolve.

That which is called (...), that is stopping or obstructing is contrary to
that which is called Anastomoticum, for it obstructs the entry of the vessels,
and hinders evacuations, because its substance is gross, and therefore
obstructive.

That is called (...), that is closing, which has power, but more unable and
weak to obstruct, and it only closes the pores of the skin as Stegnoticum does
the orifices of the veins.

That is called (...), that is clammy, which applied to any place sticks
tenaciously, and obstructs the pores of the skin, and fills them with much
stuff, as Rosin or Gum.

Some are also called Emphrastica, which obstruct the pores with a glewish
humor, and fill them with clammy matter.

A condensing Medicament called by the Greeks (...), is that which makes liquid
and subtle juices more gross, its power consists in gross and terrestrial
matter, void of all Acrimony.

The Med. called (...), is contrary to this, which attenuates gross and
compact humor, and variously dissolves them. It is of a very subtle
substance, whether cold, as vinegar, or hot, as Aqua vitae, otherwise called
Aqua vini, and by many Alcumists an Elixir, or quintessence.

That is called (...), that is a pore-opening Medicament, which delivers the
passages from viscid and clammy humors, and its faculty is various according to
the various manner of the humor causing obstruction, for that obstruction,
which proceeds from a glewish juice, must be dissolved by an attenuating, and
cutting Ecphracticke, that obstruction which is hard withal must be resolved
by a mollifying quality.

That is called (...), that is, mollifying, which mollifies a hard body as (a
hard boil) and reduces it to its natural state, and it is at least hot in the
second degree, and temperate, both in humidity, and siccity, cap. 4. and 8.
lib. 5. simpl.) that which is more temperate in heat is rather a cause of
imposthumes. But that which is applied to a hard swelling caused by siccity,
should be both more moist and moderate, in heat, as oil of much marrow.

That is called (...), or a suppuratory, which is most congruent and like to
our nature, and as it were a symmetry of heat and moisture ( c. 5.7. and 8.
lib. 5. simpl.) whence if our finger be put to any part, where we desire to
change the matter into corruption, if it be long therein detained, it shall
easily make a suppuration, but mollifying Medicaments are hotter, yet not so
hot, that they discuss by that quality their exuperant humidity, and therefore
suppurating Medicaments perform what they may, rather by quantity, and
mollifying by quality than any other thing.

To the former (...), is very simular: but taken strictly, it is a Medicament
which concocts the humor, Diapyeticum is that which changes it into corruption.

That is called (...), or cleansing, which purges out all gross and subtle
humors and all filth, whence it is called a purgative Medicament: It is
altogether bitter of taste, full of salt, and drying; that is called, (...),
which is applied to green wounds, it is also called (...), that is, a blood
stenching Medicament.

That Medicament is called (...), or incarnative, which is effectual in
regenerating flesh, and it is dry in the first degree, and cleanses
moderately, and without pain. ( cap. 15. lib. 5. simpl. and 3. Method.).

That Medicament is called (...), or glutinatory, which conjoynes and
agglutinates parts disjoined, that they may return to their natural unity,
when it is applied to bloody wounds, (...), and (...), by some Symphyticum and
Aggregativum.

That is called (...), which is effectual in solidating broken bones, and in
conjoyning flesh-pores.

That is called (...), or Synuloticum, which makes a skar in the ulcer, which
it does by its most efficacious siccity and astriction, for this is dry in the
third degree, Coleticum, in the second, and Sarcoticum in the first only.

That Medicament is called (...), which consumes the superfluous flesh, to
which it is applied, and reduces the part to its native superficies, whence it
is called of some (...), it is hot in the third degree.

That Med. is called (...), which by burning the part, to which it is applied
by its most vehement and fiery heat, it leaves a pill, or crust upon it, as
sublimate, or a Caustic.

That Medicament is called (...), that is, putrefying, which partakes of some
malign quality, and destroys and putrifies the place it touches, by enduring
its stink and ill quallity, as Sandarach the Monks hood, and such like.

Some are called (...), which take away hard thick skin, and these may easily
be used in their stead, which are called Catharetica, that is superfluous
flesh-consuming Medicaments.

And since these are the chief names taken from the ffects of Medicamentall
faculties, we will omit those that are of less use.

CHAP. XV. Of the choice of purging Medicaments in general.
IF an Apothecary sufficiently know these three things, he is most expert in
his Art, to wit to select, prepare, and compound Medicaments; now Election
denotes knowledge, for no man can well select, and discern this good from that
evil, unless he have known both: preparation also presupposes an industrious
artificer, who being long exercised in the Art, does correct and amend malign
simples many ways, as by fire, water, and his hand, making the good better,
and weak stronger, and of more virtue. And there is no composition without
election and preparation, for a confusion of many simples together is no
composition.

Therefore to elect Medicaments, Delectus quid.
should be an Apothecaryes first duty and employment: which choice is thus
defined. Election is a separation and distinction of that which is evil from
that which good, of the noxious from the innoxious, and of the malign from the
benign. Benignum Medicamentum quid. Malignum.
Now that is a benign purging medicament, which purges gently, and looses the
belly calmely, as Cassia, Manna, Tamarinds and Rhabarbe; and that is a malign
and unwhole some medicament, which purges by a violent traction, and disturbes
our bodies, by reason of that adverse essence it has to our natures.

This malignant medicament is twofold, Medicamentum malignum quotuplex.
the one totally so, to wit whose universal genus is violent and unruly, of
what sort soever it be, or whence soever it is taken, as Euphorbium, Laurel,
Antimony. The other in some species, or by accident in some individual of its
genus, which has revolted and degenerated from its proper nature, as black
Agarick, black Turbit, Colocynth, only in the Plant, or of one plant in the
field, Mesue only in Plants or of the Aple-trees in the field, because it is
believed to take away all bitterness and malignity of the field and plants.

But we ought to abstain from both these kinds of malignant purges, unless in
some great affections, Quando malignis purgantibus ^^cat uti.
in which gentle, little or nothing profit, for then a skillful Physician may
use malign medicaments duly prepared, because even poisons are salutary in
some diseases, as Vipers flesh to the Leprosy, Scorpions flesh, to wounds made
by themselves, made dogs blood to them that are bitten by a mad-dogg, whence
is that Proverb: Those that are wounded by Scorpions, seek remedy from the same.

We must also abstain from benign purges, unless they be rightly, in a just
quantity, and seasonably administered, and also exhibited to such as they may
profit, for Hippocrates says, Aphoris. 14. lib. 4. Quando a binignis
abstinendum.
that a purging medicament is noxious to them that have their health according
to that ( Matthew. 9.) The whole need not a Physician.

CHAP. XVI. Whence the Election of purging Medicaments may be taken.
THe Election of a purging Medicament is made from its essence; Essentia
medicamenti quid.
nature, and faculties, we call the essence of every Medicament, that very
state, which arises from its matter and form, or that all which is seen, or
consists absolutely in a Medicament without any preparation.

And we call the faculty of a Medicament, that very virtue it does, Facultas
medicamenti quid.
or can exercise in our bodies.

Now the substance first qualities, or temperament, second qualities ensuing
the temper and the disposition externally acquired, show the good or ill
essence of a Medicament, Substantiae medicamentorum.
now we understand by the name substance, the commoderation and consistency of
the matter, which flows from the proportionable mixture of the Elements,
whence some are said to be heavy, or light, others dense or rare, others
gross, or subtle, others clammy or friable, from which differencies a certain
disposition and proper faculty is engendered, whereby we may distinguish betwixt
the good and evil in the same genus.

In the second place Election may be made from the prime qualityes, that is
from the Temperament, Temperamenti quot differentiae
of which there are eight different kinds, hot, cold, moist, dry, which are
called simple qualities, and as many compound hot and moist, hot and dry, cold
and moist, cold and dry, to which may be added the mean temperament, in which
consists the nature of man, from which flow diverse other temperatures, some in
one, some in two, some in three, and some in four degrees; and therefore the
excess of several degrees is distinguished.

Thirdly, the Election is taken from the second qualities, Secundae qualitates
quot differentiis includuntur.
which especially differ in four kinds, for some are tangible, others odorable,
others gustable, and others visible; audible qualities are omitted, because no
certain election can be made by them. Now those are rangible qualities which
can be discerned by the judgment of the touch, some whereof are the properties
of the Elements, to wit, in which the first qualities hot, cold, moist and dry,
are discerned by the touch; others arise from the temperament, and are called
second qualities; by whose means the Medicament is heavy or light, hard or
soft, clammy, or friable, sharp or smooth as above.

Fourthly, Odor quid.
Medicaments may be selected from their odor, which is a certain vaporous
substance proceeding from an odorable matter, which brought into the nostrills,
moves the sense of smelling, and there are as many kinds of them, as sapors:
for odors concord with sapours in proportion, and for the most part borrow
their demonstrations from them, yet are not the species of odours so distinct
as them of sapours, because the sense of smelling in men is very dull; hence it
is that there are a thousand kinds of odours that want proper names, and
therefore all odorables are generally distinguished into well smelling, and ill
smelling things.

Fifthly, the judgment in Election may be guided by the Taste of Medicaments,
Sapor quid. Sapores quet.
and that more surely than by Odours; because there are more distinct species
of sapors than of Odours ( lib. 4. simpl. Med. Gal. cap. 21.) for sapour is a
quality that may be perceived by the sense of Tasting, whereof there be nine
different species, three whereof flow from over-powering calidity in a
substance, gross or subtle, to wit, sharp, bitter, salt, three from
exuperant frigidity, sour, austere, unpleasant, and three from moderate heat,
pleasant, fat, unsavory, Selectio medicamentorum a dispositione extrinseca.
the last whereof inclines to frigidity, pleasant and fat to heat.

Sixthly, Medicaments may be selected by a disposition extrinsecally acquired,
which arises from the season or place ( Gal. cap. 2. lib. 4.) Mesue, adds
Magnitude, Parvitude, and Number, for by these the quality of the Medicament is
of more or less force. A certain and universal rule cannot be given
concerning the temper and choice of Medicaments by their color and sound, that
thereby the benign may be discerned from the malignant: for seeing all
benignity and malignity of Medicaments consists in the substance, temperament
and faculties, cold, moist, hot, and dry, are found in all colors. Neither do
the colors themselves show the temperament of the Medicaments, for the color
of a medicament may very easily be changed by some external accident.

The judgment also of the benignity and malignity of a medicament from its
sound is as uncertain as from its color: for there is no universal, but only
a particular and accidental knowledge thereof, as in Cassia, Carthamus, and
some few more.

CHAP. XVII. How Election of Medicaments may be made from the things premised.
EVery Cathartick attracts the humor most like it self, but Mesne asserts that
some purge more particularly by attraction, as all those that are more valid,
some by repression as Stypticks, some by lenitude, as viscid and lubricating
Medicaments, and some by mollifying, as most Malacticks. But of those that
purge by Traction, those are to be judged better that are lighter, and the
heavier malignant; for the levity of a substance shows its subtilness and
rarity, gravity its crassitude and density. Eorum, quae trahendo purgant,
quaenam meliora.
Now those that consist of gross matter, do hurt more; as also those that have
superfluous humidity; by how much they are lighter, by so much better, unless
they be decayed; for those that are lighter have less superfluous humidity,
which subverts the ventricle, and causes pain.

The state of those that purge by repression from a Styptick faculty consisting
in the terrestrial matter, Quae comprimendo purgant quomodo seligenda.
which through their native condition and temper are solid, not rare, is
contrary to the former; which are to be judged of from their plenitude or
vacuity, because these naturally should be gross, not rare; for by how much
these are heavier, by so much better. As also those that purge by leniating,
lubricating, and mollifying, because the faculty of mollifying and lubricating
proceeds from humidity, which necessarily supposes gravity. But that humidity
is natural, and of its proper temper, not excrementious, which makes the
Medicaments better.

We may judge of rare and dense substances, as of light and heavy, for levity
concomitates rarity, as density does gravity, for the terms are reciprocal:
but thin and friable are not the same, for every friable thing is not thin, nor
every pliant gross, nor on the contrary: but if any Medicament be thin and
pure, it must necessarily be friable and tender; and if any Medicament be gross
and impure, it will be viscid and clammy; these excepted in pliant humid
substances, as Honey, Manna, Butter, Oil; that which is purer is better, and
what impurer worse. That is properly called gross, which cannot easily be made
smooth, or which cannot be bruised into thin parts; and that thin; which can
easily be so reduced. That is called thick or dense, Crassum, Tenue. Densum.
Rarum. Grave. Lentum. Friabile.
that can pass through none or few Orifices. That rare, which is apt to pass
through many. That is heavy, which being compact, is more conspicuous by weight
than magnitude. That light, which is less in weight than bignesst That which is
pliant is so much opposite to that which is friable, that the pliant can scarce
be wrought upon by pulling or bruising; whereas the friable is bruised to
powder, even with a touch or weight of a finger.

Now for matter of Temperaments; in simple Temperatures hot Medicaments are
better than cold, and moist than dry; in compounds, hot and moist are most
wholesome, cold and dry most dangerous. But if the election be made from degrees
of intention, whereas man's temperament is moderate, by how much the Medicament
comes nearer man's temper, by so much it is more wholesome; and by how much it is
more remote, by so much more malignant. So that what Medicament soever is four
degrees distant from the mean, that Medicament is worst; and those Medicaments
that exceed the extreme of four degrees, are rather to be adjudged Poisons than
Medicaments.

Now we may thus judge of Medicaments, De delectu in secundis qualitatibus.
by reason of their second qualities, as of Tangibles; when one Medicament of
the same kind is hard, another cold; one sharp, and another smooth; in these
the foft is to be preferred before the hard, and the smooth before the sharp or
rough. Durum quid
We call that hard, according to Galen, (cap ult. lib. 3. de differ. pulls.)
which is harder than our flesh, or to which our flesh yields; Molle quid.
and that contrariwise soft, which yields to our flesh; and both of them
become such two manner of ways, to wit, either by Nature, or by Art. That also
is called smooth, that has an equal superficies. Love and asperum quid.
That rough, which has an unequal one, by reason of some parts higher, others
lower in it; as in Prunes, Sebestens, Myrobolans, and many more.

Now election of Medicaments may be made from Odor, Delectus ab odore.
for this cause, because a sweet oppleasant smell refreshes the spirits,
restores strength and vigor to them, exhilarates the principal members and
parts, and corroborates their faculties. An ill and stinking smell on the
contrary burdens and aggravates the head, vexes the heart, subverts the
ventricle, infects the spirits, moves a loathing, causes grievous and laborious
purgings, and oftentimes vomitings. And therefore such purging Medicaments are
obdulcora^ed with cordial Electuaries, Omnia aromata esse cardiaca.
whereby their ungrateful odor is amended, and the principal parts fortressed
against the malign quality of these Medicaments; for all odoriferous Spices are
the fountain and principle of life. Wherefore a good smell is to be preferred
before an ill; for an ill smell hurts the heart and brain, and a good one
exhilarates both, ( Gal. cap. 25. lib. 4. de simplic.) for it is familiar to
the spirit contained in the ventricle of the brain, which whilst it is
refreshed, it makes the faculties more operative.

CHAP. XVIII. A particular disquisition of Tastes.
WE have with Physicians of best note asserted, ( Oribas cap. 5. lib. 14.
collect.) that three of the nine sapours are hot, three cold, Saper at^r qualis.
and three temperate. Of all which, the sharp, tart sapour is hottest, which
being incited by our heat, whereby it is reduced from a potency to an act,
bites, corrodes, expresses the sense of a fiery quality, and in a manner burns,
as Indian Pepper, as Pelitory, or as a little flame.

There are of these sharp sapours many kinds, Aerium multa genera.
( Gal. cap. 17. lib. 4. simpl.) for some are hot and dry, exceeding the fourth
degree of heat, and are poison, as Sublimate, and Arsenicks. Others have much
humidity mixed with a fiery heat, whereby they are made somewhat pleasant, and
edible, as Garlic, Onions, Leeks, Garden cresses, and such like. Others are
contained in a third order, as the herb Galingal, Pepper, Savine, Treacle
mustard, Snap-dragon, Helicampane. Others are more moderate, as Thyme, Hyssop,
Anise, Coriander, Radish-root, Origane. And others are sharp absolutely and
simply, and some are mixed with other sapours, as such Medicaments as are sharp
and bitter.

Next to the sharp sapour is the bitter, Amarus sapor.
which proceeds from the assation of the subtle terrestrial parts; and it has
not the power of corroding as the sharp, but more cleansing than the saltish;
so that it trouble somely exasperates the tongue, ( Paul. Aegin. cap. 1. lib.
7. Galen. cap. 10. lib. 4. simplic.) and it is twofold; the one hot, spoken of
before, which arises from the assation of terrestrial parts, by which sweet
things are made bitter, either by concoction, or by age; the other cold, which
comes by vehement congelation, as in Opium, wild Succory, Lettices, Hemlock,
and some unripe Fruits; or which comes from an inchoated or imperfect coction,
or rather from remiss heat which is accounted cold, as the other from an
intense heat; for there is scarce any compound which is not endued with diverse
natures and qualities; whence it is no wonder, if Opium and Hemlock be partly
hot, and partly cold. One scruple of Coloquintis may induce to two pounds
weight of water bitterness, but no heat, unless it be very small and occult.
Yet Schegkius thinks that some are hot, because of their bitterness, and that
they refrigerate by an occult virtue, as Poppies and Succory, (lib. de occult.
medic. facult.) Now a bitter sapour is such, either simply, as in Aloes; or
mixed with other sapours, as in Wormwood, to which a stypticity or astriction
is annexed. As also we may experience in many unripe Fruits, which not having
as yet attained their perfect magnitude, are bitter sour; but being mature,
they are bitter, and withal sweet, with a kind of sourness.

Next to bitter and salt sapour, Salsus.
which is not so dry because of its watery humidity, wherewith its terrene
substance is tempered. ( Orib. and Gal. cap. 20. lib. 4. simplic. Furthermore,
it cleanses moderately, yea, it washes the tongue more moderately than bitter
sapours, and it is pleasant enough to the tasters, endued with some astrictive
faculty; yet not so much as to contract the tongue, as the austere or acerb
sapour.

Now this salt sapour is twofold; the one natural, the other artificial;
Natural, as in Salt, Seawater, and many salt terrene substances; Artificial,
as in Lee, Lime, and in Chymick Salts.

All sour sapour is cold of it self, or so naturally; as in those things,
Aridus.
whose cold temper is conjoined with tenuity of substance, as the juice of
Limmons, Oranges, Sorrel, and such like; or so by accident, as by putrefaction,
( Act. cap. 1. tetr. 1. sermon.) by which means Wine is said to be sour, yet not
so absolutely, for it has some Acrimony in it self, as Galen attesteth, ( lib.
1. simplic.)

Hence arises another division of sour sapour, to wit, into that which is
exactly such, as the sapours before mentioned, and into that which is not
exactly such, but is conjoined with some other sapour, whether sweet, bitter,
or sharp, as four-sweet Fruits, as Apples, Prunes, Mulberries, Cherries. Some
Fruits have also bitterness joined with their sourness, as Persian Apples, and
some Cherries. Vinegar partakes of Acrimony, and a mixed quality, as Galen
says, ( c. 19. 21. and 26. lib. 1. simplic.) because of its acquired heat; yet
its fourness exceeds its Acrimony, as Acrimony exceeds sourness, in Oils of
Sulphur and Vitriol, educed by Chemical Art, which corrode and bite the tongue;
and taken alone, do greatly calefy. Furthermore, sour sapour, as to its
impression upon the tongue, it corrodes, bites, penetrates, and exterges, and
all without calefaction, unless it have some other quality mixed with it, as
Galen asserts, ( cap. 2. lib. 4. simpl.) in which it differs from sharp sapour,
although sour sapours ferment the earth for the tenuity of their parts with
heat produced by putrefaction.

The austere or styptick sapour does moderately strain and exasperate the
tongue and mouth, Austerus.
and in some measure dry and refrigerate; and it is very peculiar to many
immature Fruits, as to Quinces, to the fruit of the Dog-tree, and many Pears,
especially wild Pears. The matter consists in a mean, to wit, partaker both of
a terrestrial and watery nature, in which frigidity is predominant. Wherefore
all austere sapours are frigid, moderately astringing and repelling fluxes; and
it differs from an acerb sapour, in that it is more humid, and astringeth and
exasperates less. For Galen, ( cap. 7. lib. 4. simplic.) says, that watery
humidity does much retund and dullify the strength of every sapour.

But when natural heat begins to domineer in the very matter, and the watery
matter mixed with the terrene has attained to maturity, then the austerity
evinced and expelled, dulcity succeeds in the same matter; and so austere
Fruits after mutation become sweet, which mutation is not of the matter, but
quality.

Acerb sapour, Acerbus.
sometimes called Pontick and Styptick, differs from the austere sapour only
by reason of more or less, ( Aet. cap. 1. tetr. 1. fer. 1.) for thereby it more
grievously and strongly astringes and exasperates the tongue and mouth, ( Aet.
cap. 4. lib. 2.) because it consists more of dry and terrene matter, not
apertly partaking of watery humidity. And in it cold with siccity is more
predominant than heat; for every acerb sapour is cold. Now this sapour is most
conspicuous in Gall nuts, in unripe Medlars, and sorb Apples.

Sweet sapour is mild and pleasant to the taste, Dulcis.
and familiar and acceptable to the belly and stomach, says Galen, ( c. 14.
lib. 4. simpl. com. ad aphor. 37. lib. 5.) because it has a mild calidity, and
laudable temper: wherefore sweet things only nourish, and the Infant in the
womb only draws the sweetest blood. Now sweet differs from oily, because an
oily sapour is less pleasant, whereas otherwise their temperaments are one, and
their impressions on the tongue alike: for that which is sweet, lenifies and
dilates the little fibers of the tongue, takes away asperity, and cleanses away
whatever inheres to the tongue. Now this sweet sapour is most apert in Sugar,
Honey, Manna, Liccorish, Milk, Reysons, Jujubs, and mature Fruits. Theophrastus
constitutes four species of this sapour, to wit, milky, honey, watery, and winy.

The unctious or oily sapour is sweet, and nourishes, as Galen says, ( cap.
9. lib. 4. simpl.) that whatsoever nourishes is sweet, or of a kind of sweet
sapour: yet they are distinct; for watery humidity is of sweet things, aerie of
fat things; whence it easily melts in the fire, and is rather sauce than
nutriment, ( cap. 10. lib. 3. de Aliment.) for it lenifies and fills the
exasperate parts of the tongue, as Butter, Marrow, Oil. Now unctious sapour is
such, either exquisitely, as all oily and fat things; or moderately, as the
root of Mallows and Lillies.

The insipid or unsavory sapour is next to swell, Insipidus.
and it deflects more to frigidity, by reason of its watery substance not well
elaborated by its inbred heat; and it is evident in things not perfectly
concocted and cold; for all unsavory Aliments are pituitous, ( Gal. cap. 46.
lib. 2. de facult. aliment.) but is more properly observable in Water, Citrul,
Gourds, and such like; for it affects the tongue with no manifest quality,
neither is it properly a sapour, but rather a privation of sapour, as the name
shows. The Latins call it fatuum, that is, foolish or unsavory, because it
moves the sense with no manifest quality, it leaves an impression much like to
that of Hydraeolean.

CHAP. XIX. What election of Medicaments may be made by Sapours.
THE preservation of our nature consists in sanity, and sanity in temperament,
from which those sapours that recede more, are to be adjudged more malign, and
those that more agree to our nature are more wholesome. Now of sapours, sharp
and bitter are most unacceptable and averse to our nature, sweet familiar and
grateful. Wherefore by how much a purging Medicament recedes more from sharp
and bitter sapours, by so much it is less noxious. For those that are exactly
sharp, are to be thought worst, and most nocent, Exact acria pessima.
as Enphorbium and Thymelea, which by reason of their acrimony and vehement
heat, exulcerate the bowels.

Next to these are sharp and bitter sapours, as the juice of Buckthornberry.
After these, that which is exactly bitter, as wild Gourds, and the juice of
wild Cucumbers, called Elaterium.

Those which are both sharp and bitter, Acria and amara. Aloen venas occludere.
and also styptical, as Aloes, which contrary to Serapio, rather shuts than
opens the veins, are not so ill; and they are less ill that are both sharp and
styptical, as Epithymus, ( Diosc. cap. 24. lib. 3. Gal. cap. 4. lib. 5. meth.
Pint. cap. 4. lib. 27.)

Bitter and styptical are least of all ill, Amara and styptica.
as Rhabarb, and Sea-wormwood; for although bitter things putrify least, and
do not generate Worms, yet those that are exactly such, since they are not fit
to be eaten of any Creature, much less of Man; Galen attesting the same, ( cap.
9. lib. 4. simpl.) by how much any sapour is less bitter, by so much the rather
it is to be chosen.

Now of good and wholesome sapours, Dulcia saluberrima.
the sweet ones are most wholesome, as Cassia, Manna, Honey, Licorish, Jujubs.

Secondly, the unsavory are next to these, as Mallows, Sorrel, Violets.

Thirdly, both sweet and sharp, as Prunes, Tamarinds.

Fourthly, sweet and bitter, as Polypody.

Fifthly, sweet, bitter, and styptical, as Roses; for those that have
astriction, are adjudged most wholesome. And therefore where Nature has not
given astriction to purging Medicaments, Art adds it.

CHAP. XX. Of the time when Medicaments are to be gathered, how long their
virtue lasts, and in what time it is most valid.
THat disposition of a Medicament which is extrinsecally acquired, and which
gives better knowledge to their selection, proceeds either from the time
wherein they are to be gathered, or from the place where they are deposited. As
to the time, three things are worthy to be known; first, when they ought to be
gathered; secondly, to what time their virtue remains perfect; thirdly, in what
time they are better and more useful; for some are better new than old, others
better old than new, others best in the middle of the time.

As to the first, Quo tempore colligenda me^^a^^nta.
we affirm that Medicaments are then to be gathered, when their virtue is
better and more useful. But nevertheless all parts of Plants are not equally,
and at one time and season, effectual and wholesome: For Roots should be
gathered at one time, Stalks at another, Leaves at another, Flowers and Fruits,
Seeds, Juices and Gums, at another time.

And so Roots should be gathered in several seasons of the year, Quovis tempove
quaedam radices colligenda
not in Autumn only, as is asserted by Dioscorides, Avicenna, and many others.
Nor also in the Spring alone, as Saladinus would have them: but some may be
effoded and gathered at any time, to wit, such as are always vegetive and
juicy, although the stalks be dry, as the roots of Bugloss, Sorrel, Licorish,
Saint Christophers herb, Smallage, Butchers broom, Cyperus, Sow bread, Lillies,
Mallows, and many more. Others as soon as their leaves are fallen, at which
time the virtue of the Plant goes into the root, and then the humor is more
thoroughly cocted than at other times, as Enula campana, Angelicae, Peony,
Briony, Bugloss. Others are to be pulled up and gathered ere the virtue of the
Plant be diffused into branches, leaves, flowers, and seed, as Polypody,
Flower-de-luce, Saint Mary's seal, Gentian, Ragwort. And some are best to be
gathered in Spring and Autumn, as the roots of Mallows and Lillies, Eringes,
Galangal, Sourdock, Radish, and many more which have store of natural Juice in
them.

But the stocks and stalks are to be gathered when they are perfect; leaves and
flowers before they fall of themselves, for then for the most part they are
perfect. Fruits, when they are ripe; the juices of herbs and leaves while young
branches are sprouting out.

Gums are to be drawn and pressed out of the stalks gashed while it is fresh,
in the beginning of the Spring, or beginning of Summer, while the juice ascends
into the stalk. And all Medicaments, by Dioscorides advice, are to be gathered
when the Heavens are clear.

Now how long the virtue of purging, altering, De duratione virtutis
medicamentorum.
or roborating Medicaments endure, cannot definitely be showed and determined
upon. For since that every thing has its proper age, and a peculiar antiquity
or recency consists in several Medicaments, the time of duration is not the
same in all, for Rhabarb will keep fresh, potent and valid three years, others
decay sooner, as of roots such as have thin substances, as the root of
Valerian, Asarum, Ragwort, which are efficacious and valid only one year.

Some endure five or six years, as Aristolochy; Butchers-broom, Cypetus; others
ten years, as the greater Centaury; and according to Threophrastus, others
thirty years, as Hellebore; others forty years, as black Chameleon; and some a
hundred, as Elaterium: and if the same Author speaks true, Elaterium has been
found of two hundred years old, which was very good and precious. Therefore we
can scarce determine in general for what season or time the virtue of a
Medicament, especially purging, is efficacious, but only specially of some,
and several; seeing we shall discourse in our Officina Pharmacopolarum
particularly of these, wherein we shall most largely declare and treat of the
composition of Medicaments.

Yet may this rule be laid down as general, if not altogether, Quando vis
medicamentorum praestantior.
yet for the most part true: That all Medicaments consisting of a thin and rare
substance, and all such as abound in much humidity, continue but a short time
efficacious: but those that are gross and solid, and less humid, endure longer,
because their virtue cannot so easily exolve and perish.

The third thing remains yet unapplyed, to wit, at what time the virtue of
purging Medicaments is better and more valid, seeing some are better new than
old, others on the contrary, and others in their middle age. Quando recentia
meliora.
Now that this dignotion may be certain, and that the election may be good, it
ought to be taken from certain differences of sapours, and from the variety of
the substance, whereby we judge some new to be better than old Medicaments, as
styptick and bitter, which being ill from their imbred siccity, become worse by
age, because siccity increases in these by time; but being new, they have
humidity, which tempers the excess of heat and siccity.

Those also that have but weak virtue, as the flowers of Violets, Borrage,
purple colored Lilly, Bugloss, Rosemary; or those whose virtue is posited in
the superficies, and therefore easily resoluble, because of the rarity of the
substance, are better new than old, as almost all Flowers, especially those
whose odor quickly fails.

On the contrary, Quando vetusta meliora.
some old ones are better than new, especially sharp Medicaments, which are of
thin parts, because the fiery heat posited in the superficies, which causes
their biting and burning, by age expires. And what Acrimony remains within, in
time waxes mild, and is broken, as Galen speaks of Eupherbium, cap. 2. lib. 3.
de comp. med. genesis

In Onions and Garlic the case is otherwise, for their Acrimony proceeds from
heat conjoined with humidity, which taken away, they are more sharp, and
therefore better new.

Secondly, those whose virtue is valid from the temperament, and hardly
resoluble for the density of their substance not posited in the superficies,
but shut within, are better old than new; for all excrementitious and
superfluous humidity is absumed in these by time, and their natural humidity
remains, because of their density.

Many are best in their middle age; Qua media atate meliora.
first, sweet; secondly, unsavory; thirdly, salt Medicaments. Sweet, because
these newly gathered are flatulent, by reason of their superfluous humidity
undigested; and being old, they are bitter.

Unsavory Medicaments also being new, abound with superfluous humors, whereby
they are flatulent and loathed; being old, they are dead and useless.

Salt Medicaments, lastly, ought neither to be too old, nor too new; for being
too old, by reason of their ficcity increased, and their humidity absumed, they
are bitter and sharp; and being new by reason of superfluous humidity, they
trouble and subvert the ventricle.

Now they are ancient or new naturally, Vetustum and recens non omnibus ^quum.
from a like number of days, months, or years. Whence an equal age or newness
cannot be given to all, because all do not endure altogether the same number of
days; but some grow old sooner, and some later.

CHAP. XXI. What election of purging Medicaments may be made from the place.
A Good purging Medicament may be discerned from an ill one by the place; and
that either from the native place where Plants grow; or from another place near
to, or remote from the Plant; or from a place near to, or remote from the Sun;
or from a place exposed to its heat, or obtenebrated and hindered of its heat.
Neither is it of small moment to know the place from whence the Plant sprung
up, because from thence together with its Aliment, it partook of such virtue as
Nature had imparted to that place, ( Gal. cap. 1. lib. 3. de sympt. cause.) For
a Tree transferred from Persia into Numidia and Egypt, does not only depose
its malign quality, but conveyed to us, is wholesome, and may bring forth
grateful and wholesome Fruits.

Now the place in which Plants, and Medicaments taken from Plants grow, is
either hollow, and polluted with dung, clay, and other naughty vapors, or free
from all strong smelling inquinations, or hot or cold, moist or dry.

In the free place, which admits of no heap, or filth of dunghils, Cloacarum
soetor ac putredo plantas insalubres reddit.
Medicamental Plants, as also Nutritive, acquire the property due and
convenient to their nature, while by an attractive faculty they draw the humor
familiar to them out of the earth, and convert it to their nutriment; as those
that are nourished with sweet, attract sweet humors; bitter, bitter humors;
and such as are nourished by salt and nitrous humors, attract salt and nitrous
humors.

But in a place not free, but inquinated, as the suburban Gardens, Hortorum
suburbanorum insalubria oler^.
which smell more of smoke and dung than earth, (otherwise unapt to nourish
Melons and Cucumbers) do not acquire the property due to their kind and
nature, but to the mixture of dung, and other things; and therefore Melons,
Lettices, and other herbs growing in such putrid places, are more unwholesome;
and all Medicaments that grow in a free place, better, and therefore the rather
to be chosen.

Now those that are hot immoderately, sprung in too hot a place, Calida loco
calido na^a, qualia.
are worse; as also cold in too cold a place: for the similitude of the place
to the Plants intends and increases their quality and malignity,
diffimilitude tempers and represses them. Whence those that abound with
excrementitious humidity, grow and are nourished in most humid places, as
Turbith, Hermodactyls, Polypody, because through the humidity of the ground,
siccity and acrimony are retunded, as it is known from Bartram, or Pelitory,
Water-pepper, and others.

The vicinity also, and society of one Plant to another, makes the quality
sometimes better, and sometimes worse, and is not to be rejected in the
election of Medicaments.

Lupines makes the Vine better; which if they be sown besides, it causes it to
bring forth sweet clusters. The Radish root also makes Hermodactyls better.

The Epithymus that grows about Thyme is good; that which is gathered about
Basil is naught; Polypody of the Oak is very good, that which is gathered off
old walls is naught.

The tree Cassia alone in the field is not worth a Pease cod. We have before,
to wit, in the 8. Chapter, showed the contrary of Colocynthis; for some become
better by vicinity and number, others worse.

Now from a subsolar place, or from a place nearer to, or more remote from the
Sun or Stars, some are better or worse: so the Oriental Senny, Illyrium and
Florentine Flower-de-luce, the Spanish Angelica, the Cretian Thyme, the
Judaical Bitumen, the Ethiopian Cummin, the Macedonian Parsley, the Mompelian
Maidenhair, the Arabian Cotton weed, or Staechades, the Thebane Poppy, the
Scythian Amomum, the Chian Mastick, the Damascen Prune, the Calabrian Manna,
the Rhabarb, that is, the root of Barbary; those Oranges that are brought out
of France are judged best, because of the property of the earth, and the virtue
of the celestial cause.

But there can be little judgment given from the aspect and vicinity of the
Sun and Stars, and the selection of the malignant from the benign thereby is
not safe, because we can hardly know from what place every Medicament comes, or
whether they grow near others or no, or what good or malignant Star respects
every one, we must credit those that effode the roots, and gather the other
parts of the Plants.

And as the number in some does change, intend, or remit their virtue and
quality, as one only Apple of Colocynthis manifests, so also does magnitude or
parvity; for the virtue of the Earth and Plant is diffused, and in many is more
remiss, but coacted into one Plant, or one Fruit more valid. Yet many Fruits
are commended for their parvitude, as Capers; and many Seeds for their
magnitude, as Garthamus.

CHAP. XXII. Of the choice of purging Medicaments taken from their faculties.
WE have briefly, but clearly, showed how purging Medicaments ought to be
selected, by a judgment taken from their substance, proper temperament, second
qualities proceeding from their temperament, from their disposition
extrinsecally acquired, from the circumstances of place, time, number,
magnitude, and parvity; it rests that we dispatch briefly what may be spoken,
as to that choice which is taken from their purging faculty; which though it be
helped by the first and second qualities, yet (says Mesue) its original is
celestial; and it has that specifical property, whereby the Medicament
received into the ventricle, and solicited by our heat, attracts to it self the
humor familiar to its nature, as we have noted elsewhere, from the veins and
passages of our body, not perceived by the senses, into the belly; and then
Nature laden with the burden of the Medicament, and the humors attracted,
prepares a way to excretion, either by vomit at the mouth, or by dejection at
the inferior parts. Whence there are two kinds of purging Medicaments, the one
a vomiting or ejective Medicament, the other dejective; which distinction is
taken from the manner of excretion or vacuation.

Now the dejective is more desirable than the ejective, because Nature has
allotted the inferior course to expel Excrements, the superior to receive
Aliments. Whence it frequently happens, that Nature acting spontaneously, and
provoked by no morbifical cause, does abundantly carry and deject excrementious
humors at the inferior parts; and sometimes irritated by the virtue of the
Medicament of it self ejective, and by the force of the swelling humor, (...)
quomodo purg^ndi.
it ejects both Medicament and humors by the mouth. Whence it comes to pass,
that ejective are sometimes better than dejective Medicaments, especially to
those whose first region of the body or upper ventricle is stuffed with much
choler, which by reason of its levity and the facility of the traction, may
more easily and sooner be extruded by vomit. Hippocrates also commends vomit to
them that are slender, especially in Summer, Because for the most part they are
choleric; slender folks, (says he, Aphor. 6. lib. 4.) are prone to vomit, and
are to be purged upward; but take heed in Winter. And ( Aphor. 40. lib. 4) in
Summer it is better to purge upwards, in Winter downwards: for the gross and
cold humor collected in Winter, is more easily educed by the inferior parts;
and therefore the skillful Physician uses sometimes ejective, and sometimes
dejective Medicaments, as the condition of the swelling humor requires, or the
nature of the diseased will bear. For Galen says, ( lib. 1. de loc. affect.)
That no man should be compelled to vomit, unless he be prone to vomit; and that
consuming men are never to be purged by vomit, nor they who have a strait
Thorax, or narrow passage.

But if a Vomit be prescribed to whom it is convenient, Quae vomitoria
seligenda.
then let it be provoked by those Medicaments which subvert the ventricle
without great molestation, and not with white Hellebor, according to Galens
advice, (lib. quos, quando, and quibus medicam.) lest any vessel of the breast
should break. And much less by Antimony, whereby crafty beguilers kill many,
and sometimes themselves, as it is to be seen in that admirable History in
Cornelius Gemma, c. 4. lib. 2. page 239. linea 14.

The same choice is to be observed in other Purges, that we use the more
benign, analogical to the morbifical humors; For we ought to give a choler
purging Medicament to the choleric, (says Galen) a phlegm purging Medicament
to the phlegmatic, and a melancholy purging Medicament to the melancholic;
otherwise we offend Nature.

Now there is no blood purging Medicament prescribed either to purge blood by
the mouth or fundament, because (as Galen says, ( cap. 6. lib. de purg.
medicam. facult.) that were to jugulate, not to purge men. Historia notanda.
Which the History of one Thracius, a Bithynian Rustic, who found a herb,
which if any one assumed, he should first lose his blood, then his life. Now
many dying by this means, the Magistrate judging the offense worthy diligent
inquisition; apprehended the Malefactor; who being demanded of whom he had
learned this deletory Poison, answered, that he learned it of none; but as he
once carried a Hogs liver to a neighboring place, his belly compelling him, he
laid the herb down in a place where a certain herb grew while he had eased
himself; Note.
which after some respite, and interval, he took up again, and found that all
the blood drew toward the herb: whence he conjectured, that the herb would
attract blood from the body; and finding it true, by experience made upon one
he met, as he had before imagined, he afterward transferred the herb to evil
uses: yet he professed, he never did show that herb to any, (of which there was
much in that Country.) Now the Malefactor, amongst other his torments that he
was to endure, was first to have his eyes put out, that when he was led along
to the place of Execution, he should not show the herb to any.

Medicaments therefore that draw blood being omitted as poisonous, others, not
analogical to other parts, are to be selected, but such as respect certain
parts by affinity. So Physicians prudently prescribe Agarick, Staechados,
Betony, to many distempers of the head: Manna, Cassia, to distempers of the
stomach and reins: Aloes, Myrobolanes, and Wormwood, to purge and corroborate
the ventricle: Senna, Cetrarch, to the spleen: Hermodactyls, and Ground pine,
to the Arteries: Sage and Rosemary to the nerves. Yet these simple Medicaments
are not so much astringed to those parts, but they may be applied conveniently
to others.

And as many Medicaments, as well simple as compound, do peculiarly corroborate
some certain part by some familiarity; and so some on the contrary do
manifestly destroy and hurt some parts of the body, as the Sea hare the Lungs,
Cantharides the Liver, Hemlock the Brain, as it is well observed by Galen, cap.
1. lib. 1. compos. medic. per genera.

The end of the first Book.
OF MEDICINAL INSTITUTIONS. The second Book. In which we shall treat of the
preparations of Medicament.
CHAP. I. Where we shall demonstrate, whether some preparation be not required
to all Medicines that tend to aliment.
A Compound Medicament that is united and made up of many simples by Art and
Experience (before it exists of a convenient consistence) requires not a
distinct preparation alone, but also that vegetable or Medicament which is
simple, as to its number, and such spontaneously and naturally may not be
exhibited with success (and not without some detriment) to the use of man
without some alteration by a due preparation. For those aliments which we daily
assume unto our bodies, if they want their acquired preparation, as rosting,
boiling, or the like, are rather fit for beasts than men; because it is
natural, and therefore belongs to cattle to feed upon the fruits of the
earth, as hay, pulse, etc. only prepared by the work of nature. As also the
Sea affords necessary food agreeable to nature, both for great and small
fishes. But the earth, unwilling to afford such a benefit of her self, does
render up her fruits somewhat incongruous to humane nature without a
preparation, and will not afford either nutriment nor aliment to man without
the long expectation, and indefatigable labors of the Husbandman, who after
much pains rending up the bowels thereof, and casting in his seed, proves as
it were ungrateful by bringing forth corn, which at the first sprouting forth
becomes suitable nutriment to many birds of the air, and four footed beasts of
the field, but to man in no wise without preparation, by first making bread of
it with Water and Leaven: For as that great Attorney General of Nature says
(lib. de veter. Med.) That the same meat and drink which suffices beast and
Horses, and other creatures, as they proceed out of the earth, raw and
undigested (viz.) fruits, herbs, etc. by which these are nourished, and on
which they live, cannot suffice man, nor agree with his constitution; For this
is apparent, that one body differs from another, one nature from another, and
one aliment another. As the same Author has it (lib. de flatib.) for one and
the same thing cannot be commodious and useful, (as to Nutriment) to all kinds
of living creatures, but some are more convenient than others.

Those meats and drinks which are our daily sustenance, Physicians out first
Schoolemasters in teaching us to make bread.
were invented and consulted of with mature deliberation by quondam Phisicians,
who instructed us, their posterity, to make bread of Corn, by being first
separated from the chafe, then ground, sifted, kneaded and last of all baked.

If therefore meat and drink being familiar, as it were to the temperament and
nature of man need preparation, before they be assumed, then much more simple
Medicaments, or those Ingredients which are required to the making up of a
Medicine. For there is no Question to be made of compound Medicines, because
they cannot be such, till they be first conoited and fitted by art, and due
preparation.

Now amongst simples, Lib. 3. cap. 7.
that which we call Catharticke is most averse from, and inagreeable to our
nature. Therefore according to Actuarius, 'twas ordained by nature to overcome,
and not to be overpowered; hence it is, that every purging Medicine has
something offensive and ungrateful to the stomach, by consequence therefore it
needs preparation and correction before it be exhibited, that its noxious
quality may be removed, and its virtues more approximated to the nature of our
constitutions, and that its operation may be better and less trouble some to
the Patient: For nothing is produced out of the womb of Nature, which ought to
be dished up to man without such preparation, as it requires.

Medicaments are prepared, The reason why Medicines are to be prepared.
that they may be more commodious for use and composition, for thereby they
become either more acceptable, more valid, more wholesome, or more miscible,
according to the opinion of Sylvius. It is our custom to use roots and herbs,
washed and boiled, and not raw, as also powders, infusions, juices,
distillations, liquors, decoctions of certain vegetables, and other
materials, and not integrall plants, for by this, either we take away some
noxious quality or other from the medicine. As when vipers are made medicinal,
we use first well to smite and bombaste them with rods, and then cut off their
heads and tails, and thereby they become less venomous, or else by it we
detect the desirable faculty. As Goats blood is more efficacious in
diminishing the stone, if the Goat be fed with Sax^frage and Grumwell, or else
by it, we acquire a new faculty, as when we nourish a female creature, a she
Goat, or Ass, with Scammony, Milkweed, or other purging herbs, that its
milkinesse may attain a purgative faculty.

CHAP. II. Of the differences of preparations.
PReparation of Medicaments in general is made three manner of ways,
Praeparationes tantum tres generales.
either by addition, detraction, or immutation: by addition, and so Agarick is
prepared, by adding Ginger and Wine, Coriander-seed with Vinegar, Vipers flesh
with Bread and Dill: by detraction Cantharides are prepared, their feet and
wings cut off; Barley, by taking away its dross and chafe; Almonds, by being
blanched; roots by washing, cleansing, and cutting off the Fibers, their pith
and woody substance taken out: by immutation, when the Medicament it self, is
so prepared by a certain artificial knowledge and Art, that its noxious
faculty is either removed or corrected, and the substance thereby made better
to use alone, or compound with others. But this artificial preparation
requires two other manner of ways, either the adjection of those things that
profit, or the detraction of those things that hurt. So Castor and Saffron is
added to Opium, that its malign power may be amended; so Lapis Lazuli, is
appointed to be burned before it be put into Confectio Alkermes or Kermeticall
confection, that its purging faculty may be taken away.

Old Mesue delivers four other particular modes of preparation, Quatuor
praeparationes secundum Mes.
coction, lotion, infusion, and grinding, to which our later Physicians have
aded many more, as lotion, purgation, infusion, humectation, maceration,
dissolution, clarification, emollition, colation, extraction, solution,
digestion, fermentation, tundation, pulverization, frixion, assation,
liquation, putrefaction, insolation, extinction, refrigeration, despumation,
exsiccasion, induration, distillation, digestion, mixtion, scapulation,
extraction conservation, duration. But in general, humectation, maceration,
dissolution, emollition and what ever is humified or mollified, with water or
moisture, is contained under infusion; Pulverization and scraping, and
whatsoever is made smooth with scraping, rubbing, etc. is comprehended under
tundation, calefaction, ustion, frixion, and what others are prepared with fire
and heat, is comprehended under coction: and thus the infinite manner of
preparing may be reduced to some few general heads.

These subsequent modes of preparations are for the most part frequent with
Chemists, calcination, digestion, fermentation, distillation, circulation,
sublimation, fixation, to distillation pertaines exalation, exhaltation,
circulation, cohobation, rectification, they call a double distillation a
cohobation, when the distilled liquor is poured upon the same Ingredient, and
distilled over again.

But to omit these Chymicall terms of preparations, which is better to know,
than make experience of. We will prosecute more particularly the accustomed
preparation of Medicines, the wholesome Remedies of Physicians prescript, that
we may securely and without danger make use of to the depelling of our
distempers, and the safeguarde of our families, which be such as Apothecaries
prepare daily and openly before all men's eyes, and places them in convenient
pots and glasses and other vessels in their shops, either for present use or
perseverance, till occasion serves: and of those the Physician selects for the
necessity of the exigent, sometimes this, sometimes that, and prescribes how
much is most convenient to be administered for the expelling of the disease. Now
the Physicians work is not to prepare these Medicines, but to prescribe them,
hence it is, that Apothecaries are termed the Physicians hand (for it is
better to commit our lives into the hands of two than one,) to operate
according to Prescript, for if the Physician alone should prescribe, prepare,
and afford Medicines, It were too great a trouble to ly upon one man's
shoulders. Besides, he has power to save or kill, and not to be liable to
punishment, by Law. Which, is an Impious and Intolerable thing, an act not to
be endured, therefore it was ordained, that Apothecaries should be appointed,
who ought to prepare and preserve Medicaments, and to distribute them out in
certain quantities, according to the Doctors Judgment and decree.

But I would not abrogate Chymicall remedies totally from Apothecaries shops,
for there are many of them of excellent virtue, Chimica remedia non negligenda.
to the dissipating of many crabbed distempers: but they are such as the
learned and skillful only should use, and not ignorant Mountebanks, Qui
debeant uti chymicis remediis.
and wandering Quacks and deceivers, who scarce know how to prepare a Medicin,
yet will proclaim themselves to the world to be more skillful than Galen and
Hyppocrates.

But to return to our intended purpose, I say, there are diverse modes of
preparing Medicines, which that I may prosecute in order, I will begin with
Lotion, afterward I will extend my discourse to those ingredients which are
simply prepared with water, often, when medicinal with juice or other liquor;
then I will demonstrate what preparations are made with contunding, grinding,
or scraping, afterward I will explain what preparation heat performs, and I
will add to these, those that are finished with a mixed manner.

CHAP. III. Of Lotion.
LOtion by learned Sylvius is accounted the last manner of preparation, Primus
praeparationis modus and cur.
by some, the middle; but by us the first; because most Ingredients, before
they will serve our use, before any other preparation can be made, ought to be
washed, though some, I confess, are not to be washed till they be burned,
roasted, or scraped.

This Lotion is twofold, Duplex Lotio.
the one a superficiary Lotion, which detracts the adherent filth, from the
superficies of roots, herbs and other Medicinal materialis, and It is common
to all other things, which being inquinated with clay, or other pollutions, are
to be washed: the other is more intimate, which dilates it self both without
and within, and through the whole substance: Now this preparation is made in
water or other liquor for this end and purpose, to remove some notious quality,
or to introduce some good one, as the disease it self, the nature of the
disease, or the occasion requires.

The Ingredient or material to be washed is either obdurate, solid, or stony,
as the substance of shells, bones, stones, concrete Juices, dry gums and
metalls; or such as are of themselves liquid, as Turpenttne, Oil, or such as
are easy to be melted, as wax, pitch, rosin, butter; or such as are dissoluble,
as Lime-stones, Bole armeniack, Lytharge of God or Silver.

Those things that are hard and solid, before washing ought to be pulverized,
or burned, and so bruised, that they cannot be grinded without ustion, as
Ivory, and Harts-horne, and so the water or liquor may reach, wash, and purge
every part.

Those that will easily melt as Wax and Rosin, etc. ought first to be warmed,
that being melted they may more eafily yield, or be made more pliable; if they
will easily dissolve of themselves, they are to be sprinkled with some water or
juice, and then washed, if liquid of themselves, they are to be washed by
continual stirring and commixing water or other liquor with the body of the
thing to be washed.

The liquors in which this Lotion is made, is either pure water, as fountain,
or rainwater, or medicinal, as sulphurous Sea water, or Bituminous or some
other humor, as milk, honey, vinegar, the juice of Plants, distilled water and
decoctions of simple medicaments. This Lotion is either much and hard, or
little and light, or a medium, or mean: for the things that are washed for the
detraction of their filth ought either to be washed strongly or lightly, and
the water so off changed, till it remains pure, and all its impurity
segregated and ejected.

Those that are washed in a medicinal liquor, should lie in the same a certain
space, according to appointment, as a whole night, or the space of some hours,
that they may attract the greater power from the liquor, or loose their
malignant quality: This preparationis injuriously called by Sylvius, A Lotion,
when it is rather an Infusion or Maceration, or rather as another has it, an
Imbution, Imbutio quid.
for the liquor seldom or never adds faculties to the Medicin, but rather
detracts from it, as we see in Rhabarb and others steeped in water; whose
purgative faculty remains by being transmitted into the Liquor.

Yet are they not washed, that they may so lose their virtues, but increase
them, Aloe cur abluatur.
and so in Mesues judgment Aloes should be washed in odoriferous water, that
it may coroborate the more, or in some purging juice or decoction (as juice of
Roses, or the infusion thereof) that it may with more celerity relax the belly;
yet it is not always washed, that its purging faculty may be intended, but
rather that its heat may be remitted; as when it is washed in the water of
Endive, Succory, or such like, that it may not too much exestuate the liver.

Lotion therefore ex consequenti, either adds to, or detracts from medicinal
materials, and causes not only the filth to be wiped off, but also mitigates
in some their acrimony, in others destroys their malignity, and dulls their
violence, and makes them better, either to be assumed or applied.

Now that Metalls may be washed, Metallica ut abluenda.
they ought to be pulverized very small, and then to be put into pure water, or
any other Medicinal liquor, and to be continually stirred with a wooden
Spatula for a whole day, and in the morning following the water to be powered
out, and other water put on, and agitated as before, till the water that's
powered off be clear, and by this means Metalls lose their Mordacity and
Acrimony (if they have any such quality) for Tutia washed thus is void of all
mordacity, and therefore we use it, Tutiae lotic.
for the fluxions of the eyes, so likewise many other Metalls being thus
washed, lose their Acrimonious quality. As Galen shows at large, (4. Comp.
Med. Gener. c. 2.)

The Ancients were wont to quench burnt brass in Asses mi^^ two or three times
over, Cadmia lotio.
then pulverized it in a mortar with water powered on it, and so dried it
again, and so preserved it to dry up ulcers of the eyes, and drive away
fluxions.

Ceruss is often washed in milk, sometimes in rainwater, Cerusae lotio.
and sometimes in distilled water, as the Physician orders it.

The usual custom of our Apothecaries in the preparation of steel is to wash
or sprinkle its dust with vinegar, Chalybis lotio vulgaris.
according to the Arabians custom, afterward they dry it on a large marble in
the hot Sun, dried, they bruise it again, and put on vinegar as before, and so
they do seven times, but this is not simply Lotion, but a manifest preparation,
yet is the dust of iron more laborioufly prepared by Alcumists, of which they
make their Croc^^ Martis, but of this we have spoken one where.

The Lotion of Lead is thus, Plumbi lotio.
first burnt well in a Crucible, then pulverized in a Leaden mo^ter, with a
Leaden pestill, with rainwater, ^ill the water wax thick, like black^sh clay,
then the liquor must b^^strained, dried, made into balls and kept.

To preserve ^^ctious substances, Adioum and meductarum ablutio.
first the Adeps; or Medulla must be melted, then strained from the drossy
Membranes, afterward washed well in water, till it appears pure and clear.

The preparation of a Wolfs Liver consists in ablution and siccation. Jecoris
Lupi praeparatio.
First, let it be washed over and over, in odoriferous wine; in which wormwood
has first been boiled, being thus washed according to Art; Let it be well
dried in an Oven, then afterward laid in a dry place with dry Wormwood or Mint.

This Lotion is by some highly commended, as of sufficient roboration to
^allance the weakness of the Liver, which is naturally so, by reason of its ill
odor and insuavity.

The intestines also of a Wolf must be washed and prepared after the same
manner, Intestini Lupi praeparatio.
save that they must be dried in the North Wind, they are commended by some
learned Doctors, for some special qualities in or against the Cholick passions.

Oil, Olei Lotio.
whilst it is in the water, must not be much beaten, least it be so mixed with
the water that it cannot easily be separated from it clearly without some
commixtion.

As for Rosin, Refinarum and picie Lotio.
Wax, and Pitch; let them first be melted upon the fire, with a certain
quantity of water, and purge away their dross by straining them through a cloth.
Galen. cap. 14. libr. 1. comp. Med. gener. cap. 58. lib. 9. de simpl. Med. fac.
cap. 3. lib. 6. Meth.

Lime also, Calcis ablutio.
though it burns vehemently, yet twice or thrice washed its mordacity is taken
away, and may be safely applied to any part, whether Nervous or not, which is a
place most exquisitly endued with sense, some wash it seven times over, and
make it up into a round ball, which being dried, they so preserve it for future
uses.

To show gradually the preparation of several Medicaments distinctly, were
superfluous and would be burdensome to the Reader both because Sylvius has
treated largely upon this subject, and also because we have added many Lotions
to many Medicaments, in the Pharmacopoeia, with other preparations of those
compositions prescribed in it.

CHAP. IV. Of the Purgation of Medicaments.
BY Lotion (of which we have treated in the former Chapter) the filth and
corruption mixed with Medicinal materials is wa^^ed off, but their
superfluous and noxious parts are not purged thereby, for French Barley, though
a thousand times washed, will scarce lose it hilling; nor other seeds their
chaff and coverings; nor fruits their skins or barks; nor nuts their shells:
neither can fat only by washing be purged from its Membranes: therefore should
be twice cocted, and no more, according to Hyppocrates advice, before it be
used; in general all Medicaments more or less, should be purged by
detraction, which cannot be performed so much by Lotion, as by Section, Rasion
and fraction, or some other Artificial Industry of the hand. Thus the
external part of roots are scraped by cutting off their little fibers, or the
heart of them (commonly so called) taken out of them. Yet sometimes they are
not purged from their barks, but the barks from every part, as from superfluous
and useless matter: for of the Cinamon-tree the bark only is most desirable,
of Ginger the root, of Santall-tree the wood, of Canes the marrow or pith; of
Maiden hair, the leaves only; of the Rose-tree, the flowers; of Pepper, the
seed; other parts since they are either less useful, or superfluous are
purged away.

For this reason the Medulla or pith of Cassia Fistula is separated from its
cane, Raisins from their stones; Dates from their shells; the Colocinth
separated from its seeds; the hillings from many seeds, but from many fruits
nothing, the Cortex, Medulla, juice, seed, and flowers of Citron and Orange are
good and useful.

Whereas Nuts and Almonds are involved in a threefold skin, wherefore they
should be thrice purged, the skin which is thick in some, is taken away by the
first; the shell is broken, by the second, and the cover next to the kernel is
taken away by the third, wherein it is involved.

As a Child in a sheet in the womb, the usual custom is to put Almonds or
Nuts into water, and when it is ready to boil, rub them between your fingers,
and they will easily be cleansed.

CHAP. V. Of Infusion.
INfusion is a preparation of certain Medicaments, whereby they are sliced into
small pieces, or bruised and so steeped in a liquor fit and convenient to the
Physicians intention, and that by the space of one hour or two, or more, days
or weeks, according to the nature of the Medicament, or the Physicians Order:
for those that have a hard compact substance, and a quality firmly inhering in
the substance, ought to be steeped or infused longer; those that are small and
tender, a lesser space.

The use of this Infusion is chiefly threefold, that the malign force of the
Medicine may be regulated, or altogether absumed, that the benign or good
quality may be made better, or their virtues transmitted into the liquor.

Turbith before it is used, Turpethi praepa. ratio.
ought to be steeped in new milk, and afterward dried, that it may not gripe
the bowels, when it is assumed. Mezeorus and laureola before they be exhibited
in any Medicine, ought to be steeped in white Wine, and afterward dried, that
their crabbedness might be mitigated.

The five opening roots after Lotion should be steeped in vinegar, Quinque
radicum aperientium praeparatio.
that they might the easier cut viscid Phlegm, and sooner deduce humors by the
passage dedicated to the expelling of humor; Nettle-seed, Urticae semen quibus
conveniat.
steeped in the decoction of the herb Draconth, and assumed, helps any
stopping at the stomach, for it is exceeding good for those that are troubled
with stoppages. It causes the throat, and other parts, by which it passes, to
cease to burn or itch.

But purging ingredients, and odoriferous spices, are usually infused in Wine,
or Water, or some suitable decoction, or some distilled water, or in juices
extracted from vegerables, according to the several ends and purposes of the
Doctor, that they might lose their proper qualities, and transmit them into the
liquor; thus Rhabarb and Agarick are wont to be infused, not only that their
virtue might go into the liquor, but that it might have a better and more
effectual operation of the body of him that assumes it.

The mixture of Vinum Hypocraticum is only the infusion of Cinnamon in the best
Wine, Vinum Hypocraticum.
with the dissolution of sugar, so much as will dulcorate it: There is also
some Ginger mixed with it by the Apothecaries, that it may the better content
and please the drinkers palate.

So also Gummi Ammoniacum, Gummorum infusio.
Galbanum, Oppoponax, and Sagapenum are macerated, steeped or infused in Wine,
or Vinegar, to bring down their consistences, that the filth mixed therewith,
may be separated from them by colature, before they are to be used in the
compositions of Electuaries or Plasters, or for other uses.

So flowers of Violets, Roses, and Water-Lillyes, Florum Insusio.
are infused in warm water, till their virtues be transmitted, and the
colature dulcorated with a sufficient quantity of sugar, to bring it into the
consistency of a syrup.

CHAP. VI. Of Humectation and other differences of Infusion.
HUmectation, Infection, or Triture are wont to be reduced to infusion or
Immersion: And Irrigation, or Inspersion to Humectation; for those Medicaments
that are liquored, with Vinegar, Milk, Water or other humor grow moist, or are
humected, that they may more comodiously and conveniently be used and commixed
with others.

Now humectation, What Medicaments need humectation.
is absolute necessary to all foreign Medicaments, which being brought to us
from far Regions, are hard, and dry, their juice being evaporated, and
therefore we resartiate their native humidity, or cherish and defend that small
relic of it that is left, by a light immersion or irrigation, or oftentimes
by reposing and keeping them in a cool place, as when we lay and preserve
Cassia in a cellar, Venetian Treacle in a leaden pot, etc. that their virtues
may not so soon be exhaled.

Many odoriferous simples also, should be moistened, The hum^ctation of odours.
if they are ordered to be pulverized, or grinded, as Amber, Bezoar, Musk, etc.
least the more subtle and odoriferous parts should fly away.

Humectation also is very necessary for the preservation of fruits, and
blaunching of them, from their skins and hulls. As Almonds, that they may be
enucleated, are first to be scalded in hot water, Pine nut^s and other fruits
and nutts before they can be preserved, must be steeped, moistened, and
macerated in water, that their acrimony and bitterness may be abated; for any
fruit that has any apparent quality of acrimony, by a frequent immersion in
water or other liquor, does wax more mild.

Camphire, Colocynth, Euphorbium, How to powder Camphir, Colocinth, Euphorbium.
How to powder Mastick.
and many others that are to be pulverized, must be besprinkled with a little
oil of Almonds, or such other thing before their grinding, and Mastich humected
with a little rose water, which causes it sooner to be pulverized, and its
virtue less expire, or its subtler part be diminished by flying away.

Irrigation is reduced to humectation, Irrigation.
which is as it were a little or sparing humectation, for those that must be
used dry, ought to be irrigated or moistened, with a gentle sprinkling, that
they may become more useful, and their virtues more retained.

CHAP. VII. Of Nutrition.
MEdicaments in a rational sense, cannot well be said to be nourished, but in
a Philosophical sense they may; as when a medicament is augmented, by the
mutual apposition of two, three or more Medicaments, which acretion, the
vulgar Apothecaryes call Nutrition, and perchance it was endued with this name,
because it is as apparently altered in mixing, as Nutriment in nourishing.

Now nutrition is not unlike to Humectation, Nutrition is Cosin-german to
Huniectation.
for in both there must necessarily be mixed some liquor or other, which in
Humectation is copious, but in Nutrition spare, for in the latter, the liquor
must not be powered on with that quantity, that the forther requires; for when
it is once irrigated or sprinkled, it must be presently dried, and that either
by the Sun, or fire; and again moystned and dried, and so irrigated three or
four times, Sarcocolla nutritia.
as the Gum Sarcocolla which is nourished with a woman's, or Asses milk, but if
macerated with a copious quantity thereof, it presently dissolves, and the milk
will be sour before the Gum can be dried.

Alcumists usually nourish metalls by a congruent humor, to the thing
nourished, prepared after an occult manner, either that they may the sooner be
melted or dissolved, or nourished and augmented.

And so to the making up of the crude unguent which is prepared with one part
of Litharge, Triapharmacon.
four of oil, and five of vinegar, the Litharge by a continual beating is so
nourished by the foresaid oil and vinegar, that it grows to the consistency of
an unguent, without the help of fire, or addition of other hard bodies.

Many roots are irrigated sometime with Wine, sometimes with other liquors,
that they may swell. As Mirabolans with milk, or with any other liquor,
correspondent to the Physicians purpose and intent.

So likewise Aloes is sometimes nourished with a decoction of Aromaticks, The
way to wash Aloes.
or some other fit and convenient liquor answerable to the doctors intent, but
oftener with the juice of herbs, leaves or flowers, as with the juice of roses,
red or damask, of red, to roborate, or damask to purge, both which do augment
the aforesaid qualities, and sometimes in the juice of Endive, to mitigate the
heat of the stomach, but first it should be dissolved in some of the aforesaid
juices, afterward dried, then pulverized, again washed and nourished with the
same proportion of juice, and dried as before, and this reiterated so often,
till the Aloes have drunk in the determinated quantity of the juice or liquor.

CHAP. VIII. Of Maceration, Infection and digestion.
MAceration is so near a kin to humectation, that they are often used for one
and the same manner of preparation; for Medicaments are infunded, humected, and
macerated for the self same purpose, and by the same way and art. Yet
notwithstanding Maceration requires a longer space of time, than the two
former, Oleum Acopum.
so Flores Populi and semen Abietis, ought to be macerated in oil, according
to Galens advice. cap. 14. lib. 2. de samt. tuend for, three, four or more
months together, and then the oil to be pressed out, for the commixtion of the
other ingredients. Ginger with other hard roots, green Almonds with other
fruits are to be macerated so long till they the wax soft, or loose their
unprofitable or ungrateful quality.

In the making of syrup of Poppyes, Syrupus de papavere.
the heads of the Poppyes are to be macerated in water for a day or two, or
sometimes three, till they wax tender, and their quality transmitted into the
water.

Lignum Pali sancti, and that Peregrine root, Guaiacum Radix Chinae.
which the Eastern Indians calls Lampatan; will scarce emit their virtues
without a long maceration before their coction.

The same method must be observed with other woods and roots, which ought to be
macerated in some or other convenient liquor, answerable to their propertyes,
that their virtues of what kind soever they be, may be transmitted into the
water or decoction.

Dates must be macerated three whole days in vinegar according to the
prescript of Mesue before they be pulped, Dates.
for the composition of Diaphaenicon, Tamarinds, and Mirabolans also must be
macerated in whey made of Goats milk, that according to the opinion of the
same Author their bad and Nocumentall qualities may be amended, and that they
may no ways offend the stomach.

Tincture or infection is near a kin to humectation and maceration, Tincture
of Insection.
for those that are to be infected, must be immerged into some certain juice,
yet not always for the color or tincture only, but that it may acquire a more
excellent quality,

As Sericum Crudum, tinctured in Succo Cocci Baphicae, Cochaneel, or with a
decoction of Kerme^ Berries.
before it go into the composition of Confectio Alkermes, that it may more
increase its Cardiack quality, and give it a more delightful tincture.

Digestion also may be reduced to Maceration, by which Medicaments are occluded
in some convenient vessel or other close shut, as meat in the stomach; and so
macerated, adding thereunto Wine, Vinegar, Oil, or some other convenient juice.

Chemists make a more ample discussion of digestion, but nihil attinet ad nos,
under which they comprehend rectification, insolation, and sometimes nutrition.

CHAP. IX. Of Triture.
WHen Medicaments of themselves hard and solid, cannot conveniently be assumed
or applied, therefore they are prepared and changed by Apothecaries with such
Art, that they may easily and wholesomely be assumed, for they break and
pulverize them, and that either gross or fine, as the occasion requires.

Now this breaking of Medicaments is chiefly for three ends. The reasons of
pulverization.
First, That they may be exactly mixed with others. Secondly, That they may
acquire a new faculty. Thirdly, That their malignity may be corrected.

The manner of breaking of Medicaments, The diverse manner of ways of Triture.
is different and various, for many are brayed in a stone mortar, as in Marble,
others in Metal morters, as Iron, Brass, Lead, and sometimes glass, others in
a Wooden mortar, as of Box, or Guajaicum, with pestells usually of the same
matter, for an Iron pestell is most apt for an Iron mortar, a Wooden one, for a
Wooden mortar, a Leaden, for a Leaden mortar, and a glass pestell for a glass
mortar: Some cannot nor will not be so exactly pulverated by beating as by
grinding and rubbing, and that upon a smooth marble made hollow for that
purpose, where instead of a pestell, we use a little marble stone called a
Mannipulus, which we hold in our hand, and circumduce it this way, and that
way, round the stone, Gemms.
so that we leave no part of the Medicamet unrubbed; and after this manner
Gemmes and precious stones are made into powder, till we can perceive no knobbs
with our fingers, which powder so brayed, the vulgar call marbled dust, after
which manner also those powders ought to be attenuated, which go to the making
up of Ophthalmick unguents.

Some are brayed and ground with turning stones, as Wheat and Barley in a Mill,
and so a great quantity of hard seeds may easily and speedily be bruised, and
grinded to powder.

Those Medicaments we prepare only for coction need but little bruising, and
those also that are of a thin substance, whose virtue is dissipable, need but
little bruising also, as almost all flowers.

And those require much bruising, that are hard, thick solid, nervous, and not
easy to be broken, as also such as partake of a malignant quality, as
Colocinth, the grosser part whereof assumed being not well powdered, inheres in
the turning of the Intestines, and exulcerates the part, causing the bloody
flux.

Those that confist of a mean substance, as many odoriferous simples, must be
bruised moderately, least their more subtle, and odoriferous parts should
exhale, and be dissipated, yet they must be beaten very small, when they go to
the confection of any electuary; and when we would have them to search and
penetrate to the remotest parts, then must they be beaten very fine, when we
would have them to stay long in the body; then they must be courser, provided
they be not endued with any malign quality; some must be beaten very fine and
small, that they may sooner perform their operation, and manifest their power.

Roots and herbs are sometimes beaten green, and sometimes dry, sometimes raw,
sometimes boiled, for their different ends and uses, but those must always but
be bruised mode rately, that are to be boiled; for always observe, Note.
that a greater Triture is requisite for roots than leaves, lesser for fruits,
and a mean for seeds: For seeds require but a contusion betwixt roots and
herbs.

So likewise many Medicaments can scarce be redacted to powder, unless
something be mixed with them. The husks of Silkwormes.
As Coloquintido fericum crudum, Camphire, and many more, which only dilate by
beating them alone, unless there be some unctious or liquid matter superadded;
sometime we use to sprinkle some with wine, other with water, some with oil and
vinegar, that they may not only sooner be brought into powder, but also better
serve our intention.

The harder part of Animalls as bones, horns, claws, nails may be more
easily pulverated, if they be first filed, or burned in a Crucible.

There are some who also burn Sericum Crudum, Sericum must not be burned.
wool and the hairs of several Animalls before they powder them; but thereby
they loose their former virtues, and acquire new ones, and therefore it is
better to cut them small, and dry them in an oven, and so beat them strongly
till they return into powder; some unctious seeds, as the four great
coole-seeds are to be excortiated before they be powdered, because they clog,
and stick to the pestell; many gumms, dropps and juices, conveyed to us from
far Countries, are full of tender fibers, and as it were covered with a coare,
which are so hard to be broken, and dissolved (the innermost not dry of it
self) that they cannot be beaten to powder alone, but must first be cut into
small pieces, and then beaten, with other dryer Medicaments; Gum Traganth,
Arabic, Mastick, Franckincense, Sarcocolla, and juices that have a pliant
humor, cannot easily be pulverated by beating, but rather by a gentle rubbing,
circumducing the pestell lightly round the bottom of the mortar, and some
others, not till some drops of water be sprinkled upon them.

And some are so friable, as starch, white Agaricke, and many kinds of earths,
that they may be easily even with a light rubbing, be brought into powder:
other have so gross, hard, and compact a substance, and such a strong and
lasting virtue, that they must be long, and laboriously beaten, before they
will be sifted.

Those in general that require strong concoction require much Triture, and
those that require less concoction, also less Triture.

And when any Aromaticke Ingredient, or odoriferous simples, or Gemms and
precious stones, are pulverizing, the mortar should be covered with a
convenient cover, either of wood or leather, least the more subtle part should
exhale, and their odor decay, and they more should be closer covered, when
Euphorbium or Hellibore are beaten, least the fume should offend the nostrills,
and cause importunate sneezing.

Learned Sylvius has appointed this order and method to be observed in
pulverating Medicaments, that thick, hard, and pliant Medicaments be first put
into the mortar, and then such as are not so solid, and last of all those that
are most unctious.

Lead, How lead is to be powdered.
according to Fernelius cap. 16. lib. 6. method. may be pulverated after this
manner: First, it must be beaten into small and thin plates, which being cut
very small must be macerated in the strongest vinegar for three days together,
the vinegar changed every day, afterward taken out and dried, but not burned,
which, if laboriously beaten in a mortar, will quickly be brought into a very
fine powder, the virtue whereof is excellent in concreting, purging, and curing
of malign ulcers.

CHAP. X. Of several kinds of Triture.
AS the matter to be powdered is manifold, so also is the manner, for they are
not only diminished by beating, grinding and rubbing, but also by crumbling,
breaking, knocking, filing, whence there are many kinds of Triture not
performed by pestell, or mortar, but by other instruments, as rubbing-stones,
Malletts, chopping-knifes, hammers, files, whence arise attrition,
confrication, section, fraction, rasion, and limation.

Attrition is by Sylvius taken for a certain manner of preparation, Attrition
what it is.
whereby some certain Medicaments were grated or rubbed on a stone, such as
are brought to us from Naxia, an Isle of Cyprus. As Lapis Judaicus, or
Collyries made into the form of a pill, and so dried, which being rubbed upon
the stone with some convenient humor, and so the matter by this preparation is
made so fine and small, that will not hurt, or exasperate the eye, to which it
is applied. Galen. cap. 4. lib. 4. comp. Medicam. local.

Butter is sometimes so rubbed and fretted in a leaden mortar with a pestell of
the same, till it acquire and obtain the same color, which is effectual in
curing the itch, and such distempers as require mitification, and so the
quality of the butter is not comunicated to the lead, but the quality of the
lead to the butter, and so we way expect the like from other liquors and
juices, fretted in the like matter and manner.

Confrication is a certain remiss attrition, Confrication.
by which such things as are easily pulverable, are levigated by the crumbling
betwixt ones fingers, and such as are more solid by rubbing, as Ceruse, which
as soon as it is rubbed, crumbles to powder, so that confrication and
attrition, differ only in more and less.

First, the roots, woods, and barks of trees, Section.
are cut off with sawes and hatchets, and afterward cut less to repose in
shops, and after all reduced into fine powder, that they may serve to our use;
bones, nails, claws, horns, are also divided by the same instruments, that
they may be sold by male piece, and now of late, rasped and shaved.

But this preparation made by Section may seem remote from the Apothecaries
purpose, since it rather has respect to the seller, than the buyer: yet that
more nimble Section, by which the unctious seeds of cucumbers, citrulls,
mellons, pepons, pistakes, and such like, are excorticated by a knife, nearly
concerns them.

Many roots stalks and leaves of Plants are cut with a pair of sheeres before
they be bruised. That they may be boiled for Medicamentall uses.

Tender herbs are broken from their stalks by twineing and pulling in the
hand, but their dryer parts are not broken till they be bended together;
Mineralls sometimes are fractured by a fall, oftener by tender knocks and
percussions.

Many roots and stalks are cloven after the same manner that Coopers cleave
their twiggs, Fission.
but their thicker and harder parts are divided either with an axe, saw, or
wedge and mallet.

Many roots are scraped, as well to take away their bark, Rasson.
as to purge them from their decayed parts, but wood and harder substances, as
Box and Guaiacum, or those substances that are not so compacted, as Lignum
aloes, Sandalls, Boares-teeth, Harts-horne, Unicorne, and Rhenoceroes horn,
Elkes claws, and dried yards and peezles, and many more are rasped, that they
may transmit their force into humors by coction, and more easily be pulverated:
Rhabarbe, Agaricke, Ginger, Nutmeggs, and sugar are oftentimes abraded upon a
grater, and sometimes Quinces (says Sylvius) because by this means a greater
quantity of juice is gotten out of them, than by bruising of them in a mortar.

Metalls, especially are filed, Limati^.
because otherwise they could not be pulverated by rasion, or beating: for they
either not yield at all, or else dilate being beaten, and are no ways
levigated.

Gold and silver are filed, and their dust exhibited without further
preparation, Steel, Iron, Brass, and Lead, are for the most part filed, that
they may be burned, and afterward pulverated for future uses; Teeth also and
horns, and men's sculls, and some hard woods are filed, that they may be
divided smaller than by rasion; for that which is filed is smaller than that
which is scraped.

CHAP. XI. Of Coction.
THAT gentle Medicaments might become more wholesome, and fitter for use and
Composition, they are wont to be altered by convenient Coction,

For Coction ( Probl. 7. sect. 12. Hip.) is an Alteration, What coction is.
and Commutation of the thing boiled: now there are three different coctions.
Maturation, Elixation and Assation, but because Maturation called by the Greeks
Pepansis, is a natural kind of Coction, we will omit it, because we intend
only to treat of Artificial Coction; to which Elixation, Ustion, Calfaction,
Frixion, Despumation, and what ever acquires mutation by heat may be referred
as to its Genus.

Now Coction is small, or great, or moderate according to the substance or
virtue of the thing cocted, for some, whose virtue is dissolved by long
coction, either because it is weak and posited in the superficies, or because the
substance of it is contained in a rare texture, as some seeds, many odoriferous
spices, and most flowers, require a light and small. Coction, others on the
contrary, whose virtue is not easily resolved, either because it is vallid, and
firm, or because it resides in a gross or dense substance, or because it is
posited in the middle, as in Roots, Woods, Gumms, Stones, and sharp
Medicaments, as Onions, and Garlic, which grow sweet and mild by Coction,
require long and valid Coction; others whose substance, and virtue is posited
in a mean between these two extremes, as all the three Sandalls, Jujubees,
Tamarinds, mellow fruits, and many seed, endure but a mean and moderate
Coction.

Now that Coction that is made in liquour of a moderate heat is called
Elixation. What elixation is.
And that liquor, in which the Medicament is boiled, is for the most part
water, and that either simple, as common water, or Medicinal or compound, to
which Lees of Wine, Hydromel, Milk, Buttermilk, Wine, Vinegar, juices of
plants, Saltwater, or sulphurous waters, and all liquors, in which Medicaments
are put and boiled, may be reduced.

The use of this elixation is manifold, The benefit of Elixation.


First, because it resolves the excrementitious humors of a Medicament in
boiling, and hence Colocynth and Turbith are boiled, that they may not gripe,
and torment the belly; but it is quite contrary with those Medicaments that
purge by Leniating, and Lubricating the belly, and with those that are best
when they are fullest. As Cassia and Tamarinds, for such become worse by
Coction; because thereby their native humidity is diminished, and their
purgative faculty destroyed.

Secondly, It dissipates all those flatulent gross, and corroding humors that
provoke the ventricle to loathing of the same, as in Senna Polipodie,
Carthamus, Walworke, etc.

Thirdly, It breaks all acrimony, violence, and ulcerating faculties; as Mesue
writes of Scammony, which by his prescript will be better if it be boiled in a
sorbe apple, or in a quince, or rose water, as all other sharp sapors, which
become better by Coction.

Fourthly, It bridles and corrects, the more vehement and malign attraction of
the Medicament, and therefore we boil white Hellibor, and most valid
Medicaments, that their violence may be broken, and experience has taught me,
that they become more benign, when they are boiled in water, or juice of
herbs, seeds, or fruits.

Lastly, Elixation does very comodiously mix the different qual^ties of
Medicaments, that one quality, as it were concrete, might result from them all,
which if it be weak in any plant, it must be boiled easier and lighter; if more
potent and valid, more and harder, by how much the substance of the Medicament
is grosser, and more solid: Therefore we first boil the woods, then roots,
then seeds, then barks, then fruits, and last of all flowers on a gentle fire
free from smoke.

This order of Elixation is to be observed in the preparation of all
Medicaments, especially Apozemes, which are made of the decoction of roots,
leaves, seeds, and flowers, dulcorated with Sugar or Syrups.

The punctual time of Coction cannot be defined, as some vainly have limited,
but left to the judgment of the Artist: for some require much time of
Elixation, others less.

CHAP. XII. Of Assation and Frixion.
ASsation is the coction of Medicaments in their own juice; What Assation is.
after which manner of preparation, flesh, roots, and fruits are cocted,
without any adventitious humor.

Now this Assation is made diverse ways; The manner of Assation.
for flesh is decocted at the fire on a spit, or in an oven, or an earthen pot,
or carbonaded on the coals.

The roots also of black Beets are roasted in the ashes, Beta Romana.
and Chestnuts in a frying pan: but those rather appertain to a Kitchen than a
Physician.

Now many Medicaments are dried before the fire, that they may depose their
useless, and retain their salutary quality; others, that they may become more
mild; others, that they may be easier and sooner pulverated. Rhabarb is
sometimes dried, that it may be less purgative, Scylla.
and more astrictive; as also the Sea-onion, that its vehemence may be
obtunded; whereby Dioscorides says, it offends the Intrals. The brains of
Sparrows excite Venery.
So also Sparrows brains are dried, that they may be sooner pulverable, fitly
to be mixed with those Medicaments that incite to Venery.

Many also are prepared by Assation, The benefits that come by Assation.
that their copious and excrementitious humidity may be thereby washed. Now
they ought to be stirred or moved with a spoon, or spatula, while they are
broyled on a hot tile, oven, or frying pan, lest they be burned; and they must
be taken out before they grow black.

Assation and Frixion differ thus; The difference of Assation and Frixion.
Assation is with its own juice, Frixion with an adventitious humor, as with
Butter, Oil, Wine, Vinegar, or other juice or liquor; after which manner many
Aliments are fried and broyled, as Beans and Pease, both that they may be more
pleasant, and also that they may more depose their bad qualities, Gal. 29. lib.
2. de Aliment.

Coriander seed is fried, Coriander seed.
that is, it is prepared with Vinegar, that its quality, which is noxious to
the brain, may be obtunded. Semina viticis are also to be fried, Agnus ^^stus.
that the flatulent humor may be discussed, and that they may inhibit Venery.
Now some are fried in the oil of sweet Almonds, Myrab, Citrin. Chebul. and
Nigri, for the composition of Tripherae Persicae, some in the juice of unripe
Grapes; others in Wine, or other Liquor, according to the Physicians purpose
and scope, that they may acquire a better quality, or lose their noxious or ill
qualities.

CHAP. XIII. Of Vstion.
MAny Medicaments, especially such as are more solid, as Minerals, or such as
are endued with a malignant quality, are burned before they be fitted for man's
use. Some also are burned, that they may be sooner pulverated, as bones, horns,
claws, flax, and hairs of Animals; others are burned, that they may change
their color; others, that they may obtain a new faculty; and one fit for our
purpose. Many sharp Medicaments are sometimes burned, that they may grow mild,
and lose their Acrimony; others not sharp, that they may acquire Acrimony. And
thus (as Galen, in prooemio, l. 9. simpl.) took notice, that many sharp
Medicaments lose much heat by burning; and many not sharp, assume and acquire
heat thereby. This he proves by the example of Vitriol, which becomes more
mild and moderate by ustion; and some not sharp, become more hot and crude by
ustion, as Fex vini, Quicksilver, crude Lime, Tartar.
and many others.

Now how the same efficient produces contrary effects, The reason why sharp
Medicaments by Ustion lose their Acrimony.
Physicians thus judge. Acrimony is acquired by heat increased to a certain
degree, which degree sharp Medicaments exceeding, lose their Acrimony. But such
as were not sharp when they attain to the same degree, whether it be the second
or third degree, acquire the same Acrimony; which Galen forbids us to use; for
he commends Brass burned whilst it is red, but rejects it when black, because
too much burned.

Alcumists will have Acrimony to be lost by Ustion, because of the dissipation
of Sulphur and volatile Salt, and acquired in such as are not sharp, because of
the discussion of volatile Sulphur, wherein there is little or no Acrimony; and
the remansion of the fixed saltness, whose Acrimony before Ustion was obtruded
and obscured with Sulphur.

There are also many manners of burnings, The multifarious modes of burning.
for some crude Medicaments are burned in an oven, some on a dish, some on an
earthen pot or furnace, others in an Alcumists Reverbatory and Crucible.

The powder of a Hare burnt is good against the Stone.
A Hare must be burnt in an oven till it may be brought to powder which is most
commodious and useful for breaking the stone, and expelling the gravel in the
kidneys.

The Ustion of Vipers.
Galen, (cap. 2. lib. 11. simpl.) advises us to burn Vipers in a new pot till
they become medicamental; Salt, which is useful and good to the discussing of
saltish humors and tetters. But beware lest their noxious and poisonous vapor
in their combustion overcome the brain, and so hurt the operation. So likewise
integral Animals that are small, may be burned; but parts only of great ones,
as bones, horns, hairs, feathers, hides, claws, which must be done in a now
carthen pot or furnace with burning charcoles, till they may more cafily be
pulverated, ( cap. 33. lib. de Theriac.) Boughs, Shrubs, and Twigs of Trees,
and many Simples, may be accended alone, or burned in an earthen or metallic
pot, or vessel.

Crabs are sometimes burned in a Crucible, The powder of burnt C^abs effectual
in many distem pers.
sometimes in a pot, often among burning coals, till they become ashes, or at
least may be beaten to small powder, which is useful to cure ulcerous affects,
and good for those that are bit with a mad Dog.

Stone may be burned amongst hot coals blown with bellows, The Ustion of Stones.
except the Saphyre, and other precious stones, which should be broken into
parts before Ustion, and then put into a new pot covered with a lid full of
holes, that the exhalation may have an easy passage, which must be burned till
they be ignified.

For Ignition in some is the end of Ustion; When Ustion is finished.
in others, Ustion is not terminated till smoke expire; and yet many stones may
be ignified three or four times, and still suffunded with a certain humor,
till they be brayed. Fex vini.
Wine-dregs must be scorched till they become white, and acquire so much
Acrimony, that as it were by burning, they bite the tongue and palate.

Eggs, O^sters, and Snails shells, and Animals teeth and horns ought to be burned
till they be inflamed, and made white and pulverable.

Rosins, Storax, Frankincense, Pitch, Turpentine, and such things, are
sometimes burned and accended, that their fume may become medicamental for
several uses.

Alume must be burned in a hot platter till it leave bubbling, Ustio Aluminis
and Vitrioli.
and Vitriol till it lose its color.

Salt must be burned in a pot close covered, Salis ustio.
lest it sparkle out; it is not enough burned till it leave sparkling and
crackling. Nitre must be burned after the same manner.

Ceruse, Cerusae praeparatio.
according to Dioscorides, ( cap. 103. lib. 5.) must be brayed and burned in a
new pot daily set upon burning coals, till it be of an ashy color, then it may
be taken out, refrigerated, and used. Or it must be burned in a new dish
upon-coals continually stirred with a wooden spatula, Sandaracha. Sandyx.
till it be of color like Sandarach; which so prepared, is by some called
Sandyx, or ruddy.

Now Sandarach is not the gum of the Juniper tree, which the Vulgar call
Vernix, and the Mauritanians Sandarax, but a kind of golden colored Over, (
Brasaval, in exam. simpl. cap. 66. lib. 9. simpl. cap. 53. lib. 9. simpl^) for
Sandarach and Auripigmentum are dug out of the same pit, yea, they are mixed
together, and possess the same virtue. Sandarach is by another name called by
the Chemists, red Arfenick, as Gold, colored Oker, yellow Arsenick.
Furthermore, Ceruse by burning becomes Sandyx, says Gaben, but never
Sandarach, which is of a burning faculty. But Sandyx calefies by no part, but
rather refrigerates, which Painters use, as Ceruse, whose colo^r they can
change by burning, and sometimes by mi^ing therewith Vinegar.

Gold colored Oker, or Auripigmentum, Auripigmentum.
must be burned in a new earthen pot set upon burning coals, till it be
inflamed by the fire, and change its color. Sandarach must be burned after the
same manner, and both their virtues are alike, (says Diosoorides, cap. 30, and
31. lib. 5.) for by their vehement heat they cause scabs, repress excretions,
and discuss swellings.

Brass ore, or Lapis calaminaris, must be overspread with coals, Cadmiae
praeparatio.
and burned till it shine and bubble up like the dross of Iron, then it must be
extinguished, ( cap. 45. lib. 5. Dioscorid.) some, when it is thus burned, beat
it in wine, and burn it again, till it be hollow, and seem to be full of holes,
and burn it the third time after it has been again brayed in wine, till it be
reducted to ashes.

The Pumick stone must be burned under most flagrant coals, Pumicis ^stio.
till it wax white and shine; then must it be extracted and quenched in
odoriferous wine, again burned and quenched, and after the third ustion taken
out, and refrigerated of it self, and so preserved for use, ( Di^scorid cap.
125. lib. 5.)

Verdigrease broken very small, Eruginis ustio.
must be burned in an earthen dish set upon burning coals, till it change it
self, and attain an ashy color, ibid. lib. 5.

Red Vitriol must be burned in a new earthen pot set upon quick coals. Now its
ustion in moyster matters is perfected, Chalciteos ustio
when it cease to bubble up, and is perfectly dried in other matters when it
is changed into a splendent color, and has contracted a bloody or Vermilion
color.

Chrysocolla, or Borax, must be hurned in a dish upon coals, Chrysocollae ustio
and Oker after the manner of Brass ore; the virtue of Chrysocal is to purge
wounds, and scars, to cohibit excrescent flesh, to astringe, calefy, and wast
the body by moderate biting and corroding. But Oker astringes, erodes, and
dissipates collections and swellings.

Lead may be burned after diverse manners: but before ustion, The way to burn
Lead.
it is for the most part attenuated either by filing or slicing; then put into
a new earthen pot, and so to be burned, Sulphur being mixed with it, till it
may easily be pulverated. Now this Sulphur must be interjoyned with the plates
or slices, and so both inflamed together, and stirred with an iron spatula. In
the interim, heware lest the most noxious exhalation of the Lead pierce the
nostrils, Halitus plumbi.
for it greatly hurts the brain by its commixture with Quicksilver; because of
which also, it offends the nerves and often causes stupidity, and the Palsy to
such especially as work much in Lead.

Now Sulphur and Nitre is put to the thing to be burned, being a very valid and
strong compage to the thing, whose volatibles would sooner be dissipated
otherwise, than their fixed parts overcome by the flame, as Alcumists observe.

And Assation is related to Ustion, yea it is a certain way to ^^stion; so is
Ustion to Calcination, and Calcination to Cinefaction. but Cinefaction is most
competent to Combustion, for all combustible things are ordained for flames.
For in Minerals, where there is scarce any fuel for the flame, few or no ashes
are left after Ustion; of wood, nothing but ashes: yet both combustible and
incombustible things may be levigated; Combustibles, whilst they are
attenuated into ashes by burning; Incombustibles, whilst after Ustion, by
pulveration or grinding on a Marble stone, they are attenuated into Alcool, or
small dust. If these shall not satisfy the Reader, he shall find a more
special ustion of Medicaments daily used of us in our Book called the
Apothecaries Shop.

CHAP. XIV. Of Extinction.
EXtinction is a suffocation of a matter hot or fiery in some Liquor. Extinctio
quid.
Now this matter is extinguished either when often burned, or when only
ignified or heated, as when Gems or Metals are extinguished in Wine-vinegar,
pure or stillatitious matter, or some juice or liquor, till they be totally
cold ere they have been perfectly burned.

Many things are often to be extinguished, as Lapis Pyrites: some but once, as
Galls: and some are extinguished of themselves, without the affusion of any
humid matter.

Weckerus says, that Quicksilver may be extinguished with man's fasting
spittle; yet things not ignified are improperly said to be extinguished, but be
mended and prepared by fasting Spittle, and mended by Sage; for Spittle makes
it more apt to be incorporated with other mixtures, Sage amends, corrects and
asswages its fierceness; for Sage is so called, from its preservative faculty,
Salvia, as it were Salvatrix, for it much roborates the brain and nerves, which
the malevolent faculty of Quicksilver offends, which should be mended with the
juice of Sage.

A lump or mass of Gold often burned in the fire, Aqua extinctionis auri.
is sometimes extinguished in common water, which water is good for such as
have the bloody Flux, to shut the orifices of the vessels, and for the leprous
to roborate their principal parts, and exhilerate their spirits; for it is not
a rash conceit that Gold as well refreshes the internals, as the externals.

As the water wherein Steel has often been extinguished, is useful to drive
away many affects, so Steel it self beaten to dust, burned and extinguished in
Vinegar, is excellent for many uses; of which more elsewhere.

The virtue of Extinction is such, that it attracts and retains the virtues of
the humor in which it is extinguished. So Cadmia, or Lapi^ Galaminaris, is
sometimes extinguished in Wine, sometimes in Vinegar, for the various
institutions of the Physician; and Iron is sometimes extinguished in water
mixed with oil, that it may be more doctile to be made into Helmets, or such
pieces of Armor, sometimes in water only, that it may be the more fragil.

CHAP. XV. Of Calfaction, Insolation, and Refrigeration.
CAlfaction is a certain manner of preparing Medicaments, Calfactio quid.
as well simple as compound, whereby they are neither boiled, nor burned, but
moderately calefyed either in the sun, or by the fire, or by the heat of some
putrid matter, that these may be strained, mollified, and mixed more
commodiously, or that they may be used more easily and happily. So an infused
Medicament is calefied before it be strained, not only that all its quality
may be transmitted into the liquor, but that the liquor may more
readily-permeate, and wholly draw out.

Apothecaries do successfully give hot Glysters prescribed for such as labor
in the Colic, if it proceed not from choler; warm ones to such as are sick of
a Fever, not that their grief should wax hotter, but to mitigate it, and help
the motion of Nature, and the exclusion of the humor upward may be more easy.
Scarce any thing actually cold should be exhibited, whether the remedy be
applied or assumed. Also Baths, and the very Linen sick folks use, should be
moderately warmed. Many Medicaments also must be calefied, that they may more
easily be broken, mixed, dissolved, and strained.

Insolation is so like and near to Calfaction, Insolatio quid.
that the one may easily supply the others course and place, for they both
promise the same effect. And it is like a certain coction, Hydromel vinosum
quomodo fiat.
when Hydromel is calefied by being set in the Sun forty days whilst the
Dog Star rules; for being more concoct, it may be a taste like Wine. Yet does
not this Art only make it become like Wine, What Hydromel is.
but that which is prepared of four pints of running water, and one pound of
honey, must be so long cocted before Insolation, till a raw egg may swim above
it; which we call Hydromel.

Now Conserves are insolated or calefied in the Sun, that all their parts may
be fermented together, and their more humid matter discussed; especially such
as are prepared of cold leaves and flowers, and should be kept a long time,
which will be a means to hinder their working up.

The juice of the herb Scylla, by Galens advice, ( cap. ult. lib. de puere
epileptico) must be drawn out by Insolation or Coction in the Sun; when the Air
is obscure, it may be extracted with fire; and such Medicaments as by the
institution of Winter cannot be insolated, may be dried by the Fire in Winter,
by the Sun in Summer.

Many Oils may be made by the infusion of flowers, and permixtion of other
things, and may be insolated for the space of more or fewer days, as the
quantity and faculty of the thing infused requires. For things more hot and dry
need little or no Insolation, cold and moist longer Insolation.

Vinegar altered by flowers, Vinegar of Roses.
must be prepared after the same manner. For Rose leaves should be more
insolated; Elder flowers a shorter time; as also that Vinegar which admits of
Garlic, Mint, the flowers of Betony, and Gilliflowers.

The Refrigeration also of Medicaments pertains to the Apothecary; Refrigeratio.
for he refrigerates such things as he would have to congeal as jelly; as also
such things as are after coction hard, he reposes in his Shop, as solid
Electuaries, dry Conserves, and Plasters. Now Refrigeration differs from
Extinction in this, that all things extinguished are refrigerated, not on the
contrary, etc.

CHAP. XVI. Of Putrefaction and Fermentation.
GAlen out of Aristotle observes, ( cap. 9. lib. 2. de diff. feb. and comm. ad
part. 1. lib. 3. epid.) that Putrefaction proceeds always from external heat
in a humid matter; as also the internal heat cocteth, and corrupts not. So
also whatever is in every part dry, does never apertly putrify, as we see
neither Brick, nor Gold, nor Silver to putrify.

And because things are putrid from an external heat, Mensis Philosophicus
Chymicorum.
Putrefaction is a kind of Coction; as when some medicamental matter is left
in a Vial occinded in dung, or as Alcumists say, a Horses belly (for they give
feigned names to their feigned art) for the space of thirty, and sometimes
forty days, the last term whereof is called by them the Philosophical month;
and the Liquor of this Putrefaction, menstruous, or Putrefaction finished in a
months space.

The Alcumists own this kind of preparation, Menstruum quid Chymicis.
as peculiar to themselves: but Galen, many years before they were hatched,
taught how to putrify the Gem Calcitis, and Litargie, obruted with dung after
they were put into a new pot with Vinegar. And the Apothecaries also of our
time have in this owned Galen, who macerate and putrify the branches of black
Poplar for many months together, either with Hogs grease, for the confection of
the Populeon Unguent, or with Oil for the Medicine, helping weariness.

Fermentation is not so proper to Medicaments, Fermentatio.
as to Meats and Drinks: for a lump of Dough is fermented, or leavened, that it
may make more pleasant and wholesome Bread.

Wine and Beer are fermented when they grow cold, and when there is a
segregation of the sincere Suck or Juice: Dregs, or Faces, Sirrups, Conserves,
and Electuaries are also then fermented, when new made, they refrigerate in the
Vessels.

Alcumists have their fermentation also, which they sometimes call
Vivification, and sometimes Resuscitation; for thereby they say, that the
matter perished is as it were resuscitated from the dead, and acquires new
virtues.

The vain Gold-mongers also promise, that such a Fermentation will conduce to
the transmutation of Metals: but they never yet knew the matter of the Ferment,
nor the manner of its confection.

CHAP. XVII. Of Dissolution.
MEdicaments are wont to be variously changed before they be exhibited: for the
most part, when whole Medicaments will not serve, they are prepared by some
triture, or dissolution in some liquor or other. (...).
Now this dissolution is a certain triture, whereby Medicaments, as well simple
as compound, are dissolved in some fit humor to a moderate consistency, and
sometimes smaller, sometimes thicker, according to the Physicians purpose.

Now Medicaments are dissolved for many uses; first, Dissolutionis usus
multiplex.
that they may be easily assumed; secondly, that they may more readily be
compounded with others; thirdly, that they may sooner be distributed; fourthly,
that they may penetrate into the part affected, and if need be, remain there;
as when liquid Medicaments are injected into the belly, bladder, intestines, or
any Ulcer in the body; fifthly, Medicaments are dissolved that they may
afterward be strained, and that their virtues purged from excrements, may
sooner enter the inward parts.

Thus Medicaments, which break the Stone, Dithontriptica.
are dissolved sometimes in white Wine, sometimes in the juice of Limmons, in
the water of Wall pelitory, Radish-roots, or such like, that they may more
easily permeate the holes of the reins, and the passages of the ureters. On the
contrary, such as are to be moved with the Spittle, are to be dissolved in a
thicker matter, as in Conserves, or Sirrup, Anachartasis quomodo movonda.
that they may appear rather as a Medicine to be sucked, than drunk.

And as Triture, so also Infusion, and oftentimes Calefaction are requisite to
Dissolution; for such as are hard, pliant, and viscid, can scarce be dissolved
till they be broken, or steeped, or calefied by the Sun, or Fire.

Thus many Medicaments may be dissolved presently after Triture, and many kinds
of Earth; others, not without long agitation, as all shells of Fishes, and many
more. Some require both Maceration and Calfaction, as many Gummes, which before
dissolution should be macerated with strong Vinegar, Aqua vitae, or strong Wine.

But Metals and Minerals cannot be dissolved in any juice or liquor, Non quavis
in quovis liquore dilui.
but in the juice of Limmons, in Vinegar distilled, or in such Watert as the
Alcumists call strong Waters. Any Medicament therefore is not dissolved in any
liquor, but in some fit and determinate one; for Turpentine may lie a whole
natural day in water, or in a decoction, and scarce be dissolved, without some
Eggs yolks be superadded.

In general, Grease, Marrow, and Fatness are melted at the fire, that they may
be more easily dissolved, and ingrede the composition of Unguents and
Plasters. All kinds of odoriferous Medicaments are dissolved in cordial
Waters, or altering Waters, for moist medicinal Plasters. Pills, or other
Purges, whether compound or simple, are dissolved in Aqua vitae, or other
convenient Liquor, by an artificial sedulity in drawing out their extracts.
Solid things also, which neither can nor ought to be exhibited in that form,
are first to be broken and dissolved in some convenient liquor, that they may
more safely and easily be assumed.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Liquation.
ALL Medicaments, after due preparation thereunto, may be dissolved, but few
can be melted; for Stones may be burned, Wood accended, but in no wise melted,
because not congulated with cold. Liquatio quid.
For (says Aristotle, cap. 6. lib. 7. meteor.) Liquation is a solution of
those things which are congealed by cold into a more liquid and fluent
consistency by heat; as Fatness, Marrow, Oil in winter, and such like, which
with little cold are concreted, and with little heat diffuded.

But such things as are concreted with diurnal cold, are very hard to ^elt, as
Gold, Brass, and Iron, the fusion whereof rather pertains to such as are
exercised in Metals, and not in Medicaments, to an Artist, and not a
Philosopher.

Liquation differs from Dissolution, Dissolutio non nisi fit cum humere.
in that Liquation is always caused by heat, and seldom or never with any
humor; Dissolutition always with humors, seldom with heat.

Lead is soon melted with heat; Sulphur, Pitch, and Rosin sooner; Salt, Manna,
Sugar, Gums of Ivy, Prunes, Juniper, and other Trees, are sometimes worked in
hot water, and so diffused, that they may be dissolved.

The Alcumists have illustrated a Pyrothecny, Quomodo metalla facile liquentur.
and have invented many things, whereby the liquative or fusitive Art is
enriched; as when Sal Ammoniack once sublimated with common Salt, then twice by
it self, will make hard Metals forthwith fluid. Copper also may be easily
melted otherwise, if only a little of an Asses hoof be injected to it in
melting.

Now the use of Liquation in Pharmacy is great, for it causes the Medicaments
to change their form, and acquire a new one; and it also purges them, that
their impure parts might be separated from the pure and mundane.

CHAP. XIX. Of Mollition and Duration.
MAny preparations of Medicaments hold such affinity with others, that they are
often taken for the same, as Liquation and Mollition, which only differ
according to their degree of more or less: so that Mollition is the beginning
of Liquation. For all things that are melted, first grow soft; and many things
after mollition, if they be longer calefied, melt; yet not all; for Ivory,
Claws and Horns may be mollified, but not melted.

Now Mollition happens two ways; Mollitionem fieri duobus modis.
either by heat only of the Fire, Sun, or Animal, or of some putrid matter, or
by some affunded humor, as when wax is mollified in hot water, or some harder
medicamental mass is steeped in some sirrup, or convenient liquor, till it be
mollified, and yield to the touch, which according to Galen, ( cap. ult. lib.
3. de differ. pulls.) is Judge of the hard or soft body.

Mother of Pearl, Shell-fishes, and Egge-shels macerated in distilled Vinegar,
are so mollified, that they may be wrought or drawn as you please. It is also
thought, that Ivory may be mollified with Beer, or by being boiled for the
space of six hours with the root of Mandrakes.

Horns rarefied by the fire, or long boiled in water, or buried seven days in
dung, do grow soft. It is thought the Coral in the juice of Barberies, Pearls
in the juice of Limmons, and many Stones in certain Liquors, rightly prepared,
will be softened.

Since according to Galen, ( cap. 1. lib. 4. de dignos. pulls.) Duratjo.
those things are hard to which our flesh yields, and those soft which yield to
our flesh; the doctrine of Mollition and Duration is as opposite in the same
consideration. Duration takes place in Pharmacy in compound Medicaments, which
being preserved for use, ought to be somewhat dried and solid, as Electuaries,
dry Conserves, Salves, Pills, Trochisks, and some Sirrups.

Now Medicaments are hardened by cold, Quot modis medicament a indurentur.
heat, and the admixtion of dry things. By cold, as when such things as are
melted, or only mollified, are removed from the fire, and being exposed to the
air, do refrigerate and harden. By heat, when Medicaments are boiled to their
just consistency, and their humid part absumed; for so being dryer, they become
obdurate. Medicaments also harden by the admixtion of dry things, either that
they may keep longer, or that in such a consistency they may be more easily and
safely exhibited or applied.

CHAP. XX. Of Siccation.
SUch Simples as are to be preserved all Winter, or such as are brought from
foreign Countries, ought to be accurately dried before they be reposed in
Chests, Boxes, or Bags; for their excremental humidity coacted, and not
dilated, soon corrupts, and then their wholesome quality fails.

Neither are Medicaments dried only for conservation sake, Quare medicamenta
siccentur
but often times that they may be pulverated, and that their virtues may be
more effectual. Now whatsoever is moist, and should be dry, it must be dried in
the sun or by the fire, or left in a very windy shade void of rain and dust,
till it be withered, and its superfluous humidity altogether dissipated.

Those things are dried to pulveration by the heat of the fire, which are
burned in a furnace or oven, or on burning coals, as Bones, Claws, Horns,
Shells; or in an earthen pot, as hairs of Animals, and such things as are put in
a fire pan, or covered in a dish or platter set in or upon an oven where bread
was lately extracted; for so Plums, Pears, Cherries, and such humid Fruits are
wont to be dried.

Leaves and flowers, Quae in sole melius siccentur
whose color should remain after drying, are best dried by the Suns heat,
especially in Summer and Autumn. Seeds also gathered before perfect maturity,
or in time of rain, or when the necessity of the matter requires it, cannot be
exactly dried, but in the Sun, or by the fire.

Thick and juicy roots also, unless they be cut small, may be dried better in a
place exposed to the Sun, and North-winde, than in a shade not agitated with
the wind; and the desiccation of many is to no purpose, unless insolation have
preceded.

Yet small roots do easily dry in a shade, as also many great ones, if they be
cut into little pieces, fixed on a thread, and exposed to the ^^ady air, so it
be windy, not wet. Leaves do more easily dry, which being bound in a bundle,
are exposed to the external air, partly to the heat of the fire, being
suspended for the most part on the beams of shopps, flowers most easily; for
being laid upon a paper or dish, and moved, they are presently dry.

Now leaves when dried, are to be reposed in baggs of Canvas, or paper, roots,
flowers and feeds, in vessels of glass or wood.

The flowers of water Lillyes, because more gross and humid, Quomodo Cortices
and flores siccandi.
must be put upon a thread, that so exposed to the air, they may more
commodiously dry. The pills of Oranges, Limmons, and Pomegranates, as also
spungy roots, are dried after the same manner in shops.

Foxes Lungs washed in wine may be dried in an oven not very hot, Hearts peezles
in the open air, Wolves intestines in the shade, figgs, and grapes in the Sun,
as also solid Confections, which after their conditure must be preserved in
sugar, or syrrup.

CHAP. XXI. Of Expression.
STrong compression is often requisite to separate the more pure and thin
substance of Medicaments from the terrestrial and gross, which since the
hands alone cannot execute, Mesueus invented a press whereby Medicaments put
in a strong hempen or hairy bag, may be so strongly pressed, that the whole
thin substance will be compelled to go out, the gross and more compact
remaining.

Thus wine is compelled from the grapes into hogsheads, Pomaceus qui siat.
Intinctus viridis.
thus the juice of apples is educed to the confection of Sidar; thus
Seplasiaries extract the juice of young corn for that condiment, prepared with
a little vinegar, tosted bread and some such like things, Vinum ex herbis.
which they call the green intinct of some Greeks (...) wine made of herbs.

Many are put in a cloth, then wringed in ones hands, Aqua alumnlosa quibus
constet.
till they be sufficiently expressed, as the juice of Sorrel, Purslane, and
Plantain, for confecting Alum-water, add whites of Eggs and Alum to the former.

After the like manner is the expression of Rhabarb, Agarick, and other
Medicaments, in some decoction, or convenient juice or water, that what is
useful may be taken, and what is noxious, ejected.

Acacia is drawn by compression out of the juice of the seed of the Egyptian
bramble or thorn dried in a shade; it looks black, Acacia.
if drawn out of mature seed, ruddy of immature.

Expression therefore is sometimes of the simple juice of some Medicament;
sometimes of the same macerated in a decoction or water, as when the infusion
of oils, and decoction of syrrups is distrained: Anacardian Honey is expressed
out of small and young Anacards long boiled, for out of these thus tabefied,
proceeds a thick liquor, Mel Anacardinum qui fiat.
which they call Mel Anacardinum; which that it may be well made according to
Arnaldus de Villa nova, Cap de memor. defunct. the Anacards should be beaten,
and macerated in vinegar seven days, on the eight day boiled on a slow fire,
till two parts be dissipated, then its Colature boiled with Honey is of many
called Mel Anacardinum.

That juices expressed may be long preserved without putrefaction, Quomodo suci
diu sine putredine servandi.
it is requisite that salt be intermixed, or they reposed in a vessel of a
strait mouth, oil being superadded to a fingers thickness.

Infused Medicaments and juices are sometimes to be strained with a light,
sometimes with a hard expression. And simple oils can scarce be extracted
without hard compression, whether with or without fire: for oil of Almonds may
be extracted either way, as also that which is drawn from Pistace nutts, and
other oily fruits.

CHAP. XXII. Of Extraction.
ALl expression is a certain extraction, but not the contrary, for many things
are extracted without expression, as juices and rosins of plants cut or
smitten; Euphorbium unde and quomodo colligatur
thus Euphorbium is extracted out of the Lybian tree wounded with a long
spear, into sheep skins bound about the tree, that is smitten; for its
Acrimony does so infect the taste and smell, and stir up such ardour in the
mouth and nostrills: The Rusticks are called to collect this juice, who
allured, with the reward, smite the tree at distance, that they may be less
hurt with the noxious fervor of the Euphorbium, who for all this never depart
safe and without hurt.

Elaterium by Dioscorides his advise, Elaterium quomodo parandum.
must be extracted out of the wild Cucumbers ( Cap. 148. lib. 4.) after this
manner. The Cucumbers being gathered, those which with touching fall off, let
them be kept one night, the next day a small sieve being set upon a goblet, or
basin, take the Cucumbers in thine hands, and cleave them one by one on a knife
with the edge upward, and the point toward thy face, and then the juice will be
expressed through the sieve into the vessel set under, and that the From that
substance which remains upon the top of the fire, let the seeds be separated,
and let it be added to the facula, for it is as effectual as the other.
thicker part sticking to the sieve may send forth its liquor more easily
strain it; let the humor be stirred in the basin, then let it stand, and
covered with a linen cloth, set it in the Sun, when it has stood a while,
pour out the water that swims at top without moving the feces, whereby part of
it will be effuded, and part exhausted, then beat in a mortar the settlements,
and make it into little Trochisks, when it is dried on a sufficient consistency.

Juices only are not extracted from integrall Plants, or their parts, as
Hypocistis, of the spriggs growing from the roots of Cistus, the juice of
Liccorice and Cyrene Laserpitium, but several other liquors from the incisions
of trees, and barks of shrubs and stalks, as Gumms, Rosins, Lachrymae.

Amongst extracted Gumms are counted, Gum Amoniack, Gummi.
Sagapene, Gum of Panan or Opoponax, Galbane, Bdellium, Myrrh, Storax,
Frankincense, and many more, which for their several natures are hard or easy
to be extracted: Some flow out spontaneously without wounding the tree; when
the bark in Summer gapes, by reason of the heat.

Rosins are more easily extracted, because more fluent, Resinae.
falling down without the help of hands, as that which runs of Turpentine
trees, which is the best of Rosines, as Dioscorides ( Cap. 67. lib. 1.) The
Rosin from the Mastick tree is the second, those next that are extracted out of
the Pine and Fir trees.

Amongst tears or exudations many things take place, Lachry^^ae.
as the water that flows from a vine cut, the milk of all Tithymalls, and the
thick juice of Poppies, which when it is congealed is called Opium.

In many plants therefore the bark only is wounded, and thence distills
(...), that is tears into a basin, or some such vessel hanged for the purpose,
in many the roots are wounded, or quite cut, sometimes also the boughs, thus
Balsam is extracted out of the Phrygian shrub, its bark being slashed with an
Ivory knife, for it may not be done with Iron or Steel without great damage to
the juice.

The extraction of oils is yet unhandled, which is done diverssy after an
artificial manner. For they are extracted either by distillation, which is by
ascent or descent, of which the Alcumists mass of books is full, or by
expression, or infusion, of which we have spoken before, and shall treat more
largely in our Medicamentall shop, or Pharmacopoea.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Chymicall Extracts.
THere is no little difference betwixt the extractions of Apothecaries, and
those of Alcumists, for the Apothecaryes extract only a certain liquor, as
Rosin, Gums, or such fluid matters, and separate them from the more gross and
solid substance; but Alcumists do not only desert the gross body, but exhale
the thinnest substance, till a very little portion, and that somewhat thicker,
be left, to which the virtue of the whole does adhere as united to its subject,
whence they call it an extract, as it were the essence extracted and separated
from the body.

For such an Extract does contain most excellent virtues in a small quantity, a
dragme whereof exhibited is of no less efficacy than a whole ounce of any
Medicament with its gross substance.

They are wont to give these extracts, to those whose ventricles loathed
Apothecaryes Medicines, and who had plenty of wealth: for to prescribe the
extract of Rhabarbe or Pearl to a poor man, were to take away his life.

Now these extracts of Medicaments as well simple as Compound, Extractum
quomodo parandum.
are often made after this manner, the Medicament is washed, being first small
sliced, or if it be a mass of Pills or an Electuary, it is dissolved in the
best Aqua vitae, or other fit liquor, so as it be covered two fingers, in a
vessel well and close stopped, then it is left two or three days in a hot
place, then they make a strong expression, which is afterward put in Balneo
Mariae, that the Aqua vitae may be separated from the faculty of the
Medicament, which lies somewhat thick in a little quantity in the bottom of
the vessel, then it is gathered and reposed in a glass vessel, or an earthen
one well glassed, and so evaporated on hot embers.

If any one will make a more valid extract, then he macerates another
Medicament of the same kind, in the former expression, and after a daily and
perfect infusion, he extracts it by compression, as before, and this he does
three or four times, if h^ desire a more potent extract, and at length the
last expression being finished, he segregates the Aqua vitae from it by
distillation in a hot bath, or he dissipates it by insolation, till the extract
only remain, which has great and powerful virtues in a small body.

They do not cast away Rhabarbe, and other Medicaments of grearer value, after
the first maceration or expression as the vulgar do, but infuse them twice
thrice or four times in other Aqua vitae, till they have lost their color and
sapour, and what ever virtue was in them be left in the waters, for then ought
the last expression to be made, which is mixed to the other, from all which the
Aqua vitae is separated by Balneo Mariae, and the subsident only or extract
left.

These Extracts are not always made by Aqua vitae, but oftentimes by the
decoction of herbs, stilled waters, and sometimes by rain or fountain-waters,
Extractum pilularum.
for some masses of pills are sometimes macerated in rain-waters for the space
of eight days, the juice of Buglosse, Betony, or other thing, as necessity
requires, being added, then it is boiled on a slow fire, strained and congealed.

After the same manner is one pound of the best Rhabarb, and of China sliced
small, macerated by the space of one whole day in two pounds of the juice of
Borrage and Fumitory, well purified: then it is boiled on a slow fire,
Extractum rhei.
till the juice be absumed, then is there made a strong expression, which is
again boiled with a slow fire in a Balneum Mariae, to the Consistency of Honey;
some add two ounces of Sugar, but hereby the quantity is increased, and the
faculty of the extract more dull.

Extracts are prepared after many other manners, which, to treat of at large is
not our purpose, because we study to institute a method for Apothecaries, not
Alcumists.

CHAP. XXIV. Of Cribration.
AS the husbandman with his fan dissipates the straw and chafe from his
Wheat, so does he with his sieve segregate the best seed corn from the dead and
feeble corns, to whom Cribration rather appertains than to an Apothecary; yet
both of them use this instrument to separate the flower from the bran, which
the vulgar call a searce, or sieve, sometimes a rangeing sieve, and sometimes a
hair Tamise, which is made sometimes of the hair of a horses tail, sometimes
of flax, sometimes of silk; now a sieve is made of a vellume pervious with many
round or long holes, through which tares and small seeds may easily descend,
the more succulent and good remaining: Cribration therefore is of use for that
preparation of Medicaments, which is performed in a sieve.

The use of this preparation is much, Cribrationis usus.
for hereby the flower of grounded seeds, or the meal is separated from the
branne: boiled roots are cleansed from their barks, and fruits purged from
their grains and stones.

The Quintessence of Cassia fistula is put in a sieve made of horses hair,
that the pith alone thus purged from the broken husks and seeds may be
extracted, which is called extract of Cassia.

Tamarinds and Dates macerated in vinegar or other liquor, are after the same
manner put into a hairy sieve for many definite uses, and so pulped through
with a Manipulus: many seeds are boiled till they crackle, as roots and leaves,
till they be very soft, and then are transmitted through a sieve made of hair,
to the confection of Cataplasmes and other Medicines of diverse forms.

Cordial powders, as also others which are ingredients in a Medicamentall
composition, must be sierced in a small tamise or fine sieve, and especially
such as are administered to loose obstructions, and move urine, or monthly
flowers; for by how much such are finer, by so much the sooner are they carried
to the places affected.

In sifting some powders, a hairy tamise is requifite, in others a silken one,
or one of pure and rare linen.

Cribration is chiefly for the more commodious mixtion of things pulverated, or
of small bigness, and the separation of the smaller portion, which is often
better, from the grosser portion, which is often worse.

Now as there are several instruments that serve for Cribration, Varius
cribrandi modus.
so is the manner of Cribration diverse; for properly Corn and Pulse are to be
put in a sieve, stirred with a hand, and turning the seeds this way and that
way in the sieve holden up, which ablegates the bad seed, and retains the good.

After the same manner Cordial powders are sifted, Pulveres cardiaci quomodo
cribrandi.
the tamise being moved to and fro in a man's hands, not violently shaken, that
the smaller part of the powder may be transmitted, the thicker part left.

Some, that they may be more easily transmitted, ought in the ranging of the
sieve to be shaken into a round, or other solid body with many percussions,
least the grosser parts be fastened in the sieve, and therefore almost all ought
to be grinded before they be sifted in the Tamise, and those that will scarce
permeate the tamise or sieve for crassitude, ought again to be grinded, and
beaten, till they may all pass through for tenuity and fineness.

CHAP. XXV. Of Colation and Filtration.
UPon what account dry Medicaments are sifted, upon the same are moist ones
strained, for that the filth may be segregated, and the pure and sincere liquor
only extracted, it is transmitted through a strainer, and that either thick or
rare, or of a mean texture, as the commodious use of the thing and exigency
requires, therefore the practisers of Pharmacy hold it requisite to keep many
strainers in their shops, both thick and rare linen, woollen, hempen, or hairy,
often old, but oftener new, that in a strong compression, all the juice of the
thing strained may be transmitted without the rupture of the cloth.

That gross and viscid matters may be rightly strained, Ad crassorum and
viscidorum colaturam quid requiratur.
three things are required, that they be washed in more abundance of humor,
that they be put in a more rare and new strainer, and that they be longer
calified before colation, for so their density being more rarefied, they may
more easily permeate; thus the juices of flesh and herbs are to be calified
before they be strained, and all kinds of Honey and Manna eaten out of any
liquor, that that which is extraneous and sordid, if any such thing be mixed
with it, may be separated by Colature.

Those that are thin as the juice of herbs, Lemmons and many fruits ought to
be strained warm, and often cold, for so their terrestrial and grosser part
remains, the purer and more sincere being transferred, as it were fined from
their dreggs. But Milk and muddy waters are strained cold, that hairs, if any
be fallen thereinto, may be separated from the one, and mud from the other, yet
all that which makes the water muddy is often separated from it by residence, as
we see in Cisternes, where water stands: Tent-wine also is three or more times
strained cold in a linen napkin very long and fine, for procuring the more
pleasant mixture and consistency of the Sugar, wine, and sweet spices,
wherewith it is compounded.

Some may not be strained unless very hot, others cold, others warm, and many
need only one colation, some two, and some three, till they grow clear.

Apozemes are strained through common strainers, sometimes through a woollen
bag, or linen strainer, but syrrups which are more gross, because of the
admixtion of honey, sugar, and their long coction, cannot so easily transmeate,
and therefore require a thin linen strainer.

Decoctions, whereof unguents are made, are strained after the, same manner, as
also the unguents themselves liquified, till some thick thing, which has
escaped the stroke of the Pestell, and the heat of the fire, be segregated.

The thinner part of many Medicaments is segregated from the thicker, by the
other kind of colation called filtration, Filtratio.
which apparation those Medicaments only use, which make up the compound
called Virgins Milk, or which expostulate only some smaller and thinner
substance of some Medicament; for they assume linen or woollen lists two or
three fingers broad, and very long, and they dip the one end in the vessel
wherein the Medicament to be strained is contained, the other end reaches to
another vessel that stands below it, and bending into it, does cast out by
drop and drop that humor into it, which it had continently drawn from the
former vessel.

CHAP. XXVI. Of Spumation.
WHen scum swimming upon a liquor is detracted, Spuma quid.
either with a spoon or feather, if it be small, or by colature, that same act
is called Despumation, because scum is a certain viscid juice including
flatulency; for all enumeration of scum proceeds from the mixture of two
substances, whereof the one is spiritual, the other humid, it is moved and
disjected by a various agitation as Galen says, (Comment ad Aphor. 43. lib.
2.) therefore the segregation of scums is made by the whites of Eggs, which by
their lentor and viscidity coact and collect the scum, as when juices of flesh,
many syrrups and Apozemes are in boiling cleansed from their scums.

But seeing motion and heat are the efficient causes of scum, Spumae
efficientes cnasae.
and nothing that is crude, and not moved is covered with scum, then
despumation appertains to such things as by agitation and coction engender
scum.

That Honey and Sugar may be cleansed from scum, an equal and sometimes a
double portion of liquor is put to them, and in boiling the scum is taken off
with a blunt spoon, least together with the scum, the liquor, in which the
concoction is made, should be taken off; but if despumation by this rule seem
unperfect, then add to certain pound weights of liquor certain whites of eggs;
which as soon as they are hardened by continual boiling; they gather scum, so
that the segregation of it from the liquour will be very easy, because in
straining it will be left in the strainer together with the whites of the eggs,
the sincere and pure liquour only transmitted. If the honey be very impure, it
must be boiled in a treble portion of liquor till it come to half, that the
despumation may be perfect, which rule will hold in scumming other very impure
Medicaments.

Honey may be purged and cleansed from scum by it self, Quando mel per se
despumandum.
when it has no aliene quality, or when it cannot sustein so long coction
without impairing its virtue, as those things that are mixed with it, for then
it were better not to mix it for despumations sake, than to despume it with
the mixture.

Sugar to be purged of scum ought so long to be boiled, that after despumation,
that which was a pound before, may remain no more than a pound, though two or
three ounces of liquor have been added to the coction.

Fruits that are to be preserved while they are boiled with sugar, or as some
do better boil them in a portion of sugar, are purged by some few scum only
with a spoon, as things full cocted are with a linen strainer, for they are
wont to be transmitted through a cloth extended, and fastened with nails at
every corner, that the scum and dreggs might be left above.

CHAP. XXVII. Of Clarification.
CLarification is a purging of liquid Medicaments from their grosser matter,
for hereby they are more acceptable to the palate, and may more easily be
distributed. Now many are clarified by themselves alone, as when the more
feculent settleth, as the juice of Apples, Oranges, Lemmons, Bugglosse,
Sorrel, some by despumation, others by colation, some also by coction, the
white of eggs for the most part added, sometimes also without these, as when
the juices of plants and fruits are cocted to the consumption of the third
part, and then stand two days till they grow clear, Clarificatio quot modis
fiat.
whence clarification is effected five manner of ways, by rest, by colation, by
despumation, by the mixtion of vinegar, or some sharp matter, and by the
agitation and coction of whites of Eggs with the thing to be clarified. For if
decoctions and syrups partake of vinegar, they will be more and more purged by
themselves through the virtue of the vinegar. And whites of eggs must be
agitated with a spoon, till they be all froathy, then put to the syrups or
decoctions, which must be boiled again: and when the scum is gathered about the
whites of eggs by perfect coction, then must the scum be artificially craded
and separated, either by common trajection, which is through a four cornered
cloth fastened at every corner with a nail, or by a more peculiar colation
which is through Hyppocrates his sleeve. Colation should be iterated three or
four times, till the syrrup or decoction be plainly clear.

Men of later times have made certain potions in the form of a Julep, which
with their consistency being very clear, they cill them Clarers, but such are
made after the manners before nominated.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Aromatization.
ARomatization is an artificial manner of preparation, Aromatizatio quid.
whereby Medicaments are made more odoriferous, and suaveolent, to the better
acceptance of the palate, and heart, and the greater strength and oblectation
to the vital and animal faculties. For, Medicaments subverting the ventricle,
are made less offensive, if they be seasoned with Cloves, Cynamon, and other
sweet spices, and less mo^est the principal parts, and do more wholesomely
educe excrementitious humors, by secession, or by vomit, if it happen.

And though according to Galen. ( Cap. 15. lib. 2. de aliment.) Quae aromata
hanc velillam partem corporis magis recipient.
all ocoriferous spices are hot, and exhilarate the vital faculty; yet some
more particularly respect the brain, as Cloves; some the heart, the fountain of
life, as Cynamon; others the ventricle, as Almonds; others the Liver, as Dates;
and some the womb, as musk, Amber, Civet; not that the womb is delighted
with these under the species of odors: for it has not an organ of smelling,
but is affected with smells, by reason that thin and subtle matters, or the
aerie vapor, wherewith the spirits are recreated, with which it is of all
granted, that the genitalls swell.

Mesue has described many aromaticall confections, as Diacinamomum, ARomaticum
Rosat. Diamoschum utrumque diambra, the electuary of gemms, and many more,
whose use is excellent in getting and preferving strength in the principal
members, in preventing and correcting putrefaction, and in refreshing the
spirits.

Those that from sickness recover health, or are very old, and are in riches
able to resartiate their lost strength, by the prescript of Physicians, are
wont to use Confections made of Conserves, Sirrups, and cordial Powders, whose
excellent virtue is attributed to the sweet odor of suaveolent Spices.

For the like cause, Cur medicamenta aromatizentur.
many Sirrups are aromatized with the confection of Alkermes, or Trochisks of
Galliae moschatae, or with Musk, Amber, Civet, or other suaveolent Spices hung
in a Nodula, and so tied to the Vessel wherein the Sirrup or Liquor is
contained, that it hangs about the middle of it; for so the aromatical virtue
is equally distributed to all the Liquor. Which also Vintners have learned, who
make the Wine more fragrant and sweet, by hanging Ginger, Cinnamon, and such
like, in the Hogshead.

Those of the Courtiers that are more rich, Quibus salaces ad venerem utantur.
leacherous, and slothful, that like Beasts they may more potently hold on to
their Venery, and be more active in that exercise; sometimes they cat raw Eggs,
sometimes fried with much Musk or Civet, whereby they rather destroy than
refresh Nature.

Many Fruits also, as Nuts and Pears, are before Conditure sticked with Cinnamon
or Cloves, that they may be more grateful and acceptable both to the palate
and heart. Juleps also are often aromatized with Rose Water, as Apozems with
yellow Sanders, Sauces with aromatical Confections, Cider with Amber or Musk,
as many other Medicaments with Storax, Belzoin, Camphire.

CHAP. XXIX. Of Colouration.
THough Color, according to Galen, ( cap. 2. lib. 1. simpl. cap. 30, lib. de
Histor. Philos.) cannot show the faculty of the Medicament, yet because it is a
quality of a visible body, which because it hurts or profits, is more or less
expetible: for as blackness and whiteness do obtund the faculties of seeing, so
green color exhilarates them, as besides quotidian experience, the Philosopher
also testifies, ( Probl. 60. sect. 32.) Now some Medicaments are more
desirable, being white, Coloratio quot modis acquirit^r.
others black, others red, or of other color. And Color is especially
acquired four manner of ways, by Lotion, Agitation, Coction; and Mixtion. By
Lotion most become white, as Oil, Turpentine, Wax. Some also by Agitation, as
Penedis, the white unguent of Rhasis, the plaster Diachylon, Galens
refrigerating Unguent; for all these, by how much the longer they are wrought,
by so much they are the whiter; Bechical.
as white Pills, Bechical confections, and all sugared Medicaments; for Motion
and Agitation do get the defired color to Medicaments. But this is not so
manifest in the forenamed Medicaments, as in the crude Unguent, Unguentum
crudum ex quibus constat.
which is made of Lytoridge, Oil and Vinegar, for these are so long beaten in a
mortar, till they acquire the form of a white Unguent. Medicaments by Coction
are more colourated, as more white, or more black, as the Coction is valid and
long, or as it is weak. So the Plaster made of crude Ceruse is white, of
burned Ceruse red. And the Plaster of crude Verdigrease is green, of burned
Verdigrease white and yellow. Lastly, according to the several colors of the
things mixed, the color of Medicaments is various; for such as admit Saffron
in their mixtion are yellow, such as admit Cinnabrium are red, and such as have
Ceruse are white, and such as have the pith of Cassia in their mixture are
black.

CHAP. XXX. Of Conditure, Saliture, and Farture.
AS Saliture and Farture rather seem to appertain to a Cooks, than an
Apothecaries shop, so does Conditure to the Confectioners. Yet Medicaments
sometimes need these; for Saliture conduces much to conservation, Farture to
good sapour, and Conditure to both. For Flowers and Fruits are not condited
only, but also little stalks, barks, and tender roots, both that they may be
longer preserved, and also eat more pleasantly. Thus are the roots of tender
Ginger, and husks of Cassia Fistula, which are not old. Nutmegs, Myrobolans,
and other foreign Fruits, are condited while fresh, that they may be brought
to us without any loss of their virtues and faculties, from far Countries. Many
of our own Country, sweet, sour, or Fruits of other sapours, pleasant to the
palate, as soon as they are gathered, and if need be, their Cortes pill'd off,
(for many are not decorticated, as Gooseberries, Barberries) and so are boiled
with Sugar, or Honey, or both. Those that are bitter, very sour, and sharp, are
so long macerated in water, till they have deposed their vehement quality.

Now Apothecaries do especially make humid Conditures, as they call them; as
when they so long concoct Fruits or Roots with Sugar and Water, that they lose
all their watery humidity, and after Conditure and Reconditure may be preserved
with a Sirup perfectly boiled.

But Confectioners do not only make such like Conditures as these, but also
dry ones, as they term them, which are made of Fruits sugared, with Sugar
extrinsecally boiled with them, and afterward dried by insolation. Now many
Fruits are condited with Salt alone, as Capers; or with some Vinegar added to
them, Salitura.
as Cucumbers cut in pieces, Purslain, Lettices, and many Pot Herbs, that they
may without decay be preserved till Winter; for Salt has an admirable faculty
in desiccating and conserving things. Hence Flesh and Fish salted are kept
without corruption, not only some months, but years. Wherefore by some
Philosophers, Epicureis anima pro sale.
the Soul is called the Salt of the Body, because as long as it remains
therein, it vindicates and defends it from putrefaction. It causes also, that
Medicaments acquire another quality beside what is peculiar to them; and
therefore Vipers flesh, and the parts of many Animals, are besprinkled with
white and bay Salt, (for according to Galen, there is the same faculty in both)
with a little, if it be used for sapours sake; with more, if for conditures
sake.

Whatsoever Aliments are desired to be medicinal, Fartura.
if there be any apparent cavity in them, it is stopped with Fruits, Herbs, or
Roots, wherewith Aliments are often stuffed. Now many Aliments are stuffed
before Assation or Elixation, that they may be more grateful to the palate,
and sometimes that they may more conduce to procure or keep sanity; as when
Polypody, Capers, dry Grapes, Barley, or other parts of Plants are included in
the belly of a Capon or Goose. An old Cock is wont to be stuffed with Barley,
that besides its faculty of subducing the belly, wherein according to Galen and
Oribasius, it is effectual, it may cleanse and nourish. Night-caps are often
quilted with Cephalical Powders put in a double linen cloth: the topical
remedy of the form of a Buckler is prepared after the same manner, but it
receives roborating and stomachical Pouders, such as are wont to be prescribed
to the weakness of the belly. But it is properly called Farture, by which
exenterated Animals, and excavated Fruits are stuffed with medicamental or
alimental things, and sometimes with aromatical, only for jucundity sake.

CHAP. XXX. Of Distillation.
DIstillation is an education of a watery or oily humor out of any thing by
heat. Distillatio quid
And it is effected either by ascension, or descension, and that either by a
humid or a dry heat. Distillations by humid heat are made in Balneum Mariae, or
in a Vapor made of hot water. Balneum Mariae.
Balneum Mariae, aut maris, as some say, is a Vessel containing in it heat,
into which another vessel is put, containing the matter to be distilled. It was
wont to be called Cucurbita, Cucurbita.
or Boccia, upon which is put another Vessel with a beak, commonly called an
Alembick or Capitel, which are most strictly closed together with a glue made
of Bran, and whites of Eggs.

Distillation in the vapor of hot water is also made in two vessels; Balneum
roris.
the one contains the matter to be distilled, and in the other is put a long
copper or brass vessel half full of water; so that there is space enough left
between the Cucurbita and the boiling water, by the vapor of which carried
upwards, the matter to be distilled grows hot, and suscitates the vapors to
the beaked Capitel, whence it descends into the Receiver.

Both these Bathes are described in various forms; for every one, Variae sunt
formae balnei.
according to his mind, changes, innovates, adds or detracts something rather
form the elegancy of the Boccia, than the facility of Distillation. But in all
of them, the fire, which is the efficient cause of Distillation, must be made
in such place, that with little labor it may calefie the water in the Boccia.

Now the fire should be clear, not smoky or filthy, Ignis in distillatione
qualis.
such as is made of Charcoal or Cannel; and it must be so ordered, that it
neither be too potent, and burn the matter, nor so small as to be extinguished
before the work be perfected. Before the water begin to be cold, let other be
made hot, or at least warm, and calefied according to that degree of heat which
the condition of the matter requires; for some may be distilled with a benign
vapor, others with a more potent, others best with warm water.

Integral fresh Plants, or parts of them cut into pieces, Plantarum distillatio.
are conveniently distilled in a humid Bath. If they be dry, they should be wet
with some convenient liquor before Distillation; for so the waters distilled do
better retain the strength and faculties of the Plants, though they cannot be
so preserved, because more excrementitious. Yet many waters do not retain the
sapours of the Plants, because they so inhere in their terrestrial substance,
that they will not ascend with the most vehement heat.

The humid Bath is expedient in distilling waters; the dry one (if it may be
called a Bath, as it pleases most) in educing oils and waters, Balneum siccum.
Now it is properly called dry, because no water is put under the Cucurbita,
but fire only, with dust, sand, or the filings of iron or steel sometimes
interposed. Which that it may be commodiously done, Fornacis structura.
the furnace must be built with such industry, that it may have a port open
toward the bottom, through which the ashes may be taken out which fall from
the burning coals laid upon the little gridiron. Above the gridiron there must
be another port, through which the coals may be immitted; above the arch
whereof must be inserted little iron beams or grates overthwart: then above
must be placed the brazen, earthen, or iron pan, into which the Cucurbita is
put, and it must be buried, sand or ashes being cast upon it, then the beaked
Capitel may be placed above it. In the top of the furnace must be constituted
certain holes, or wind-passages, through which the smoke may pass.

The use of a certain Instrument of Copper, called an Alembick, Alembicus.
is here requisite and frequent; in whose inferior cavity are contained iron
beams, sustaining the burning coals; in its middle, the ^occia; in its
superior part, the beaked Capitel, in form of a Helmet; and sometimes round
with a Refrigeratory, formed like a Cauldron, that it might contain an abundant
quantity of water; which when it grows too hot, is effunded by a cock placed
toward its bottom, and new water and cold is poured in again.

The beak in some Alembicks is very long and strait, and often times in some of
the form of a serpent; whence it is called a twining beak, or worm, that so it
may be transferred through a Hogshead full of cold water, whereby the water may
be better congealed and tempered.

A certain Boccia made of glass, Retorta vesica.
and crooked, commonly called a Retort, serves for that distillation which is
made by sand or ashes; as also another strait one, which has its name from a
bladder, of oval form, made of glass or copper lined with tin, which serves for
distilling those things which are easily sublevated, as roots, seeds, leaves,
flowers, and suaveolent Spices; such as are not so easily sublevated, as
farnesses, rosins and gums are to be extolled, and that more aptly in a Retort
of very thick glass.

The forms of distilling are so many, Varia distillandi formae.
and the instruments, as also their matter so various, that they can scarce be
kept within certain Laws: yet is this old custom still observed, that
Apothecaries do commonly distill young Plants, and other Medic^ments in Pewter
Alembicks, or Leaden, tinned within, which are not so noxious as many fear: yet
them of Glass and Clay are better, but they ma^easily be broken, and then
useless. Now such things as may not endure the vehemence of heat, may be better
distilled in Balneum Maria, afterward in hot ashes, wherein, as in the Bath,
some temperate and mild heat may be preserved and cherished; not so in sand
and filing dust, for these will not be hot but with vehement heat; wherefore
they are used in educing Oils by distillation. Now the waters distilled ought
to be insolated for some days space in Vessels covered with a paper full of
little holes, Quomodo aquaedist llatae insolendae.
that the more pure and excrementitious portion may be resolved, and that the
impression of the fire, which is wont to comitate waters distilled, may be
extracted.

CHAP. XXXII. Of Distillation by descent.
DIstillation is made both by moist and dry calour, as well by ascent a
descent. By ascent, when by the force of the heat of fire, water, or other body
interposed, the thinner part of the matter in the Cucurbita is elevated to the
Capitel, where condensed, Varii distillationis per descensum modi.
by its weight it declines to the beak, and runs into a vessel set under the
beak. And as the distillations by ascent are multifarious, so also them by
descent; for one distillation is properly said to be by descent, to wit, when
the humor educed without exaltation distills downwards; another is by
inclination, another by transudation, another by filtration.

That cannot properly be called Distillation, nor referred to this place, which
is made without heat, as by Expression, or Colation.

Distillation by descent is sometimes made without heat, Distillationem fiert
interdum sine calore.
as when a bag filled with Myrrh or Tartar, is suspended in vapourish air, or
in a Wine cellar; for these, as many more, long kept in a moist place, become
tabid, and as it were exude a pure juice, which they emit into a vessel set
under them. Quomodo aqua educatur per descensum.
But it is made more frequently by fire, by whose power not only waters, but
also oils are educed by descent. Thus the water of Roses, and other Flowers,
may be well distiled. A pot of copper, brass, or clay, is taken and filled with
Roses, or other Flowers, close covered with a head, and a vessel full of coals
is set under the body containing the Flowers, out of which when they are
calefied, very good water will exude into the glass subjected. But the fire is
to be so ordered, that the Flowers may not be burned, and therefore many
prudently put paper betwixt the vessel containing the fire, and the Flowers;
for hereby they may better endure the heat. But this manner of distilling, as
it is easy, so is it common.

Some distill waters in dung, or other putrid matter: Distillatio in fimo.
but the Apothecary may easily want these modes, who should be neat, and
prepare the most select remedies. Distillatio in calore solis.
That distillation which is made in the heat of the Sun after this manner, is
more commendable. A pot filled with Roses, or other Flowers, is firmly joined
to another pot set under it; then it is exposed to the Sun; for if its beams
beat upon the upper pot, very good water will distill into the lower.

But the distillation of Oils by descent is more difficult, Oleorum distillatio
per destensum.
and can scarce be effected without great preparation, labor, and time: yet is
it very familiar to the Alcumists who educe Oils by descent after many manners;
for they so prepare the vessels and instruments for distillation, that they
give no passage by ascent, but the humor as it were melted and educed, exudes
downwards by drops. Those Waters or Oils may be thus distilled, which the
ascending vapors would destroy, or the potent spirits dissipate, before they
were brought to a consistency.

There are several modes of this distillation; Distillatio per transudationem
one is in a furnace by transudation, whereby the humor provoked does
transude, and falls by drops into the subjected vessel, fire being placed above
it. Another is made by transudation, but it is in the earth, when a ditch is
diffoded in the earth, into which is put a pot, to whose orifice is fitted and
joined the bottom of another pot full of little holes, and the orifice of the
upper pot is covered close, in which pot is contained the matter to be
distilled; then the earth being adhibited, both pots are interred even to the
belly of the upper pot, so that the conjunction is covered: then the fire is
put to by degrees, according to the nature and condition of the matter to be
distilled; for a more solid matter requires greater heat, less solid a lesser.

There is another distillation, Distillatio per inclinationem.
which is a mean betwixt the distillation by ascent, and that by descent, which
is by inclination, in which there is a little elevation, and afterward a
reflection downwards. It is also called a distillation by retortion, because it
is made in a bending Boccia, in whose curvature the spirits united are
compelled to descend into the receptacle placed below, and well joined to the
crooked beak. Now this retorted Boccia should lie in a furnace built
accordingly, the belly whereof must be buried in a pot wherein are ashes or
sand, and the beak must hang out through some hole or chink.

The retorted Boccia is wont to be used in distilling such things as ascend
with difficulty, Quand^ re ortae in distilitationibus usurpandae.
as in the educing Oils out of Metals, and Spirits out of Minerals, to which
most vehement heat is required, and therefore heed must be taken lest the
Retorts be burst; therefore before they be set upon the fire, they ought to be
incrusted with clay, marl, or such convenient matter, if nitrous matters be
contained in them; and they must immediately with ashes or sand be adhibited to
the most violent fire. But because we purpose not to relate Chemical
Distillations, nor their Matrals, nor describe their Cucurbites, Handles,
Vessels, crooked, round or long, their Dishes, Pots, and Furnaces, we will no
further prosecute their precepts in distillation, for they may be sooner and
easier learned with practice and exercise, than by description.

Alcumists prescribe not only many Distillations, but also other preparations,
as Sublimation, Cohobation, Exhalation, Evaporation, Exaltation, and many more,
wherewith their Books are stuffed. Sublimatio. Cohobatio. Caput mortuum.
Sublimation is when the Extract attains to the sublime part of the Vessel, and
subsists there. Cobobation is when that which is educed, is put again to the
dead Head; now the dead Head as it is taken by them, is as it were dregs
without juice, or excrements void of any quality: yet sometimes this is the
matter of the Chemical Salt. Exhalation is a dissipation of dry spirits in the
air by heat. Exhalatio. Evaporatio. Exaltatio.
Evaporation is a resolution of moist spirits. Exaltation does not design the
same thing that Sublimation does, for it is an artificial preparation, whereby
the matter is after some manner changed and brought to a higher dignity of
substance and virtue; as when some rude and crude matter is brought to maturity
and perfection. Maturatio.
Maturation and Gradation they say conduce to this, as Digestion, and sometimes
Circulation do to Maturation. Digestio.
Maturation is an exaltation from a rude crudity to a well cocted and elaborate
perfection. Digestion is a simple Maturation, whereby things incocted and
untractable, are cocted and made more mild and tractable by a digestative
heat. Circulation is an exaltation of pure Liquor by a circular solution,
Circulatio. Gradatio.
by the help of the heat in Mercuries or Pelicans Cup. Gradation appertains
properly to Metals, for it is an exaltation of them to a greater degree of
bonity and perfection, whereby their weight, color and consistency is brought
to a more excellent degree. But that I may no longer digress from my purpose, I
will leave their Chemical Preparations to themselves; for this Treatise of
Distillation compelled me briefly to touch of these, and paint it on the margin
as a Work by the by.

The end of the second Book.
OF MEDICAMENTAL INSTITUTIONS. The third Book. Of the composition of general
Medicaments.
CHAP. I. Why Medicaments are compounded.
AS Simplicity in Nature is before Composition, so are simple Medicaments
before compound; and the ancient Physicians, as Pliny relates, ( cap. 2. lib.
26. Not. Histor.) first prescribed only Simples to cure Diseases, as Diocles,
Praxagoras, Chrysippus, and Eristratus. Hippocrates also, who first laid the
foundations of the medicinal Art and gave Laws thereto, cured almost all
Diseases with simple Medicaments alone. Yet (says Aetius, cap. 25. tetr. 4.
sermon. 2.) necessity constrained the exercised Medicks to seek new remedies, and
compound some Simples, because Simples cannot always cure; for (says Galen,
cap. 5. lib. 1. comp. med. general.) if Simples only could preternaturally
cure all affections, there would be no need of Compounds; but this no Simple
can do. The use therefore of Composition in Medicine is necessary, especially
for such Diseases as require at once contrary faculties in Medicaments, which
cannot be in Simples.

The causes why Medicaments should be compounded are many ( Serapio. cap. lib.
7.) first, Multas esse causas composi^tonum medicam^morum.
when in curing or expelling a disease there is no one simple Medicament
altogether contrary to it; then must some compound be used, which may supply
the defect of the simple, as when we would moderately cleanse an ulcer, we mix
two simple Medicaments: the one whereof would do it too potently, Galen
commands, Cap. 1. lib. 1. comp. med. gener. But also oftentimes alteration, and
a vindication from the noxious humor, which one simple Medicament cannot
effect: furthermore a part situated far from the remedy speaks composition to
be necessary, for some attenuating Medicament must be mixed with these
remedies, that the quality thereof may permeate to the part affected, as Galen
declares lib. 1. de comp. per gener.

There are also other less necessary causes of composition, as when
Medicaments are dulcorated with sugar or honey, that they may be more
acceptable to the palate and heart, or when they are condited with Cynamon and
other sweet spices, or washed in convenient decoctions, or composed into the
form of a bole or solid Electuary; for many Medicaments are conjoined, mixed
and united together for odor, sapour, color, or jucundities sake, and also
for preservation to future uses.

CHAP. II. Of Syrups in General.
WHereas many Plants cannot always be had in readiness and integrall, but
either their leaves will be fallen, or their Roots hidden in the ground as in
Winter, or their virtue decayed, their leaves and flowers being scattered, or
they will not be found when urgent necessity requires: juices are extracted out
of them for future uses, or their decoctions, condited with a sufficient
quantity of sugar or honey, or both together, are prepared, so as they may be
kept a long time without impairing their strength and virtue after great
coction, till they acquire the the consistency of a syrup. Now a syrup is a
certain liquid Medicament of juices, or decoctions, so long cocted with honey
or sugar, Syrupus quid.
for sapour and conservations sake, till it attain a just consistency; which
may be known, if one drop of it dropped on a marble stone, dilate not, but
cleave together, or taken betwixt ones fingers dwawne out in threads or teats.

Syrups were invented by the Arabians, which Avicena ( lib. 5. sermon. 1. tract.
6.) calls decoctions, or juices thickened with sweetness, according to the
Arabic word Scarab, Sharab. (...).
which denotes a certain drink, but sweet or Srab, which signifies sweet wine,
or rather a Syrup, or potion prepared after our manner; the Greeks call them
(...), or (...), and sometimes (...), the ancients by all these often
understood Oinomel or sweet potions, for the name syrup, and the preparation
thereof was scarce known to ancient Graecians.

But some hold that the name syrup is more probably derived from (...) juice
and and (...) to draw, Nominis syrupietymologia.
as it were a juice extracted, or that they were derived from Syria, or from
that which Alexander Aphrodiseus calls (...), wine boiled to the half, new
wine, wine boiled to the third part, or a sweet potion of wine and honey.

Syrups are perfectly cocted with honey or sugar, that they may not corrupt,
but be useful for a whole year, and they therefore have a thicker
consistency, a mean betwixt wine boiled to the third, and a julep; as an
Apozeme betwixt a julep and a syrup; for a syrup is not so thick as sapa, nor a
julep as a syrup, nor an Apozeme as a julep, for as syrups, which because
thicker may be kept longer and safer, so Apozemes and Juleps, being thinner,
may not be kept long and safely, for they will not keep one week, and therefore
Physicians are wont to prescribe them to present use, and have them made so often
as necessity requires: but we shall treat more largely of these in the next
book, for now we shall speak of such as may be kept by the Apothecaries for a
long time, of which for present use are often made Apozemes, if they be
dissolved in the decoction of Plants, or Juleps if in distilled waters: they
often also ingrede the confection of Eclegmes, Opiates; and Condites both, that
they may acquire better acceptance and virtue and also a consistency more
convenient to our purpose. Yet they are sometimes prescribed alone and unmixed,
especially such as must be assumed by licking by little and little to move
phlegm, as all brown syrups, as the syrup of Coltsfoot, the juice of
Liccorish, Maidens-haire, Hyssop, or of some such like, which by reason of
their sweetness coct the spittle.

Now syrups are made of the decoction of herbs, Materia Syruporum.
roots, fruits, seeds, flowers, or their juices, and such like as may be well
decocted, and the matters to be decocted are so chosen, as they may answer our
intent, whether it be to corroborate some part, or mend some vicious humor, or
educe it, thence we have such variety of syrups: for they are composed to
calefy, refrigerate, moisten, dry, open, obstruct, cut, thicken and purge.

And the decoction of those things, whereof Syrups are made, Aqu^ optima quae.
ought to be in water, either rainwater, or fountain water, or running water
which is best, because void of all qualities: the quantity whereof must be
answerable to the quantity and hardness of the things cocted: for such things as
are harder, as roots and wood can scarce be cocted, save with much time and
water without adustion. And therefore the water must be augmented, when simples
are long to be cocted, as also when they are too bitter.

The decoction strained and clarified is boiled again, with an equal quantity
of sugar or honey, or both; and sometimes with sweet wine, as it will appear in
our book, called the Apothecaries Shop.

CHAP. III. Of Propomates.
THe Ancients according to Aetius and Paulus ( Aet. cap. 30. cent. 3. ser. 1.
Paul. Aeg. c. 15. lib. 7. Propomata quid.
de remed) called a^l drinks dulcorated with honey by the generall^n me
Propomata, for they, scarce knowing sugar, made all drinks pleasant to the
p^late with honey, which we now make with sugar, that they may be more sweet
and pleasant, yet some, not for want of sugar, are condited with honey, both
for the peculiar condition of the sapour, and the artainment of those excellent
qualities wherewith it abounds: for honey besides that sweetness, which it
has, being most pleasant to the tongue, is such an excellent conservative,
that many use it, instead of salt, for the Babylonians ( Dionys. Areop.) Melle
qui corpora condiebant.
in time past buried their dead bodies in honey, and Appius the Cook ( Herod.
in Thalia) covered flesh with honey, that he might preserve it without salt,
many things also condited, and other Medicaments are dulcorated and confected
with honey, both that they may be more pleasant to the palate, and also keep
more safely without corruption, and acquire more notable virtues: Wherefore
Galen ( Cap. 177 simpl. Medic.) writes well when he says, that honey may
safely be mixed with all Antidotes. For it is most sweet ( Cap. 11. lib. de
alim.) and it produces most thin juice, and being mixed with Medicaments, it
causes them to induce and keep better. ( Paul. cap. 14. lib. 7. d^ remed.) yet
it is not equally wholesome to all, for as ( Cap. 8. lib. 2. de fac. not.) it
is good for old and cold men, for it is noxious to such as are feverish and
young men, especially chollerick, because it is soon changed, ingenders
choler, and becomes bitter in hot bodies, for if it be holden too long to the
fire, it will be bitter; as also, if it be kept too long ( Cap. 16. lib. 4.
simpl.) for Galens father ( Cap. 11. l. 1. de Antidot.) Pater Galeni mel amarum
babebat.
had a certain kind of honey, as bitter as if it had been made in Pontus, in
that part where the Bees gather their honey from wormwood, yet he says it was
Athenian honey, and very good, but that it became bitter by diuturnity of time.
Now Pliny ( Cap. 56. lib. 7.) says, that one Aristaeus an Athenian first
invented honey, and the Curetes first taught the use thereof, Mellis primus
inventor.
though Ovid makes Bacchus the Author of it, when he says: Liber and inventi
praemia mellis habet.

Furthermore, many Medicaments are made of honey, and also potions either more
liquid, called by Paulus sweet Potions, as Hydromel that is watery, and not
enough boiled, or more thick and longer boiled and insolated, as Hydromel of
wine, as Oxymel, and other Medicaments which are nominated from honey, as the
Medicamentall honeys of violets, Anacardium, R^ses, and such like.

Many Medicaments are comprehended under this name Hydromel, as Muscadell,
Melicratum, Hydromel of water, and of wine simple and compound; Quid
hydromelitis nomine intelligendum.
yet none is so simple, but it consists of honey and water, as the name
demonstrates, but it is called simple to difference it from the more compound,
whereof many differences are described every where by the best Physicians, as
by Galen (lib. de Dinamid.) and by Paulus. ( lib. 7. de remed.)

In the Confection of Hydromel, In hydromelite qua mellis ad aquam proportio.
the proportion of honey to the water is various, according to the various
scope of the Physician, the temper of the assumer: For in Summer it is
prescribed most watery, as also to young men, but in Winter, and to old men, and
flegmaticke, with a greater portion of wine or honey; and it seems good to our
Ancients properly to call that Hydromel, Hydromel vinosum.
which is not very watery, but of wine, and perfectly cocted: for it seems to
resemble in sapour and heat most noble Wine, as that of Malmesey; for it much
excites spittle, concocts flegmes, cherishes natural hear, and roborates the
stomach, its genuine description, and the manner of its making, shall be
handled in the shop divulged by us.

And although the rule of confecting Melicrated Mulsa, Melicratum, mulsa, and
hydromel, idem.
or Hydromell (which differ only in name not in substance) be not one but
various, yet Mesue ( part. 3. distinct. 6.) delivers the most vulgar, and
usual rule, to wir the admistion of eight pounds of water to one of honey,
which must be cocted together, till froth cease to swim above, which opinion
the best Authors follow, though many mix with every pound of honey ten of
water; and sometimes twelve, according to their various intentions.

Rusticks in Summer decoct the Loture of honey-combes, Hydromel Rusticorum.
first strained, and they despume it well, and repose it in ample vessels, and
having hung a little lump of Leaven in the vessels, they leave it for two or
three days, and then they drink it with great pleasure, to expel thirst; for
this drink is sharp and sweet, and most pleasant to their palates; others boil
six pounds of honey in fifty pound of fountain water and, scum it well, and
then they dissolve an ounce and an half, or two ounces of Leaven, or Barm, and
put in the Barrel, leaving a certain space, as about two or three fingers
breadth empty.

Apomel is not very watery, and as in strength and virtue, Apomeli.
it is equal to vinous Hydromel, so has it the same manner of preparation, as
we shall show in our shop.

Amongst sweet potions is reckoned Oinomel, Oinomel.
which is made of two parts of old wine, and one of honey, and sometimes of six
parts of swee new wine, and one of honey, according to Oribasius ( Cap. 25.
lib. 5. Collect.) and because honey is of thin parts, and most sweet, those
Medicaments that admit of its Commistion do conduce most to the attenuation,
coction, and expurgation of gross humors.

CHAP. IV. Of Syrups mixed with Honey.
THat which the Greeks call Oxymel, and the Arabians Secanjabin; The
Apothecaries, and not improperly call a tart sweet potion, for it is a sower
syrup made of water and honey, or sweet wine, and vinegar, whence, the taste
recerves it as sour and sweet, and as it has a mixed and various sapour, so
has it mixed virtues as by reason of the honey to the vinegar, as of the
vinegar to (...) for vinegar has a purging faculty, and it is ( Gal. l 1.
Acetum esse calidum and frigidum.
simpl. and (...) 2. Comp Med. loc.) cold and hot, discussive and repulsive,
and therefore Oxymel is commodious for hot and cold diseases, it cuts,
attenuates and cleanses gross and slimy humors, it educes spittle,
Oxymelitis qualitas.
takes away obstructions, it prepares cold humors for expulsion, it moderates
hot humors, and quenches thirst: for honey is averse to cold humors, vinegar
to their lentour, and water to heat, and therefore causes that the honey be
longer cocted better scummed, and the virtue of the Oximel, Mellis optimi nota.
better distributed as Messue his Interpreter well observes. And the honey
should not only be very good, sweet, and sharp, pale of color, neither too
thick, nor too watrish, nor abounding with spume, but the water also, being a
common solace, both to the whole and sick, as Galen says ( Cap. 27. lib. de
renum dignot. Aquae bonitas qui dignoscatur.
and Medicat.) and most necessary to all things, ought to be most pure and
good, and it may be tried so to be by taste, sight, and smell: by taste, as if
it be free from all qualities, endued with none: by sight, as if it be pure,
sincere and exquisitely clear: by smell, as if nothing can be smelled therein
which is in vicious waters, and the vinegar also must necessarily be very good,
rather white than red, Acetum quodnam optimum.
not stillatitious, nor watrish, but most sharp, which has a more potent
faculty in cutting and attenuating. Now that Oxymel is reckoned amongst
Medicines, is from vinegar, for it is not of them accounted sweet wine, betwixt
which Oxymel and Apomel takes place, called by Serapis Acumel.

But because all vinegar has not the same virtue, nor all men the same delight
in its taste, the same proportion of honey to vinegar is not generally used,
for some would have more of vinegar, others more of honey, whence Serapio
thinks it should be made according to his mind that drinks, yet the confection
described by Mesue and Oribasius is most received and approved.

And it is made of one part of vinegar, Oxymelitis praeparatio.
two of water, and four of honey, and all are boiled together to the
consistency of a more liquid syrup, for if it be not perfectly cocted, yet
because of the honey, it may be preserved long enough without corruption.

And this is called simple Oxymel, in respect of that which is more compound,
which besides water, honey and vinegar receives many roots and fruits, whereof
many forms are described by Nicolaus Myrepsus, and later writers.

CHAP. V. Of Juices mixed with Honey.
HOney is the Countrey-mans sugar, wherewith they often condite Cherries,
Goosberies and Pears, Apothecaryes also, not for want of sugar, but by the
Physicians advise confect certain juices, fruits and flowers with honey, and
make them into Conserves, Galenjabin. Conserva Rosarum.
sapes, and syrups: conserves, as honey of Roses called by the Arabians
Geneljabin, and by the Greeks Rhodomel, which is made of one part of the
flowers of red roses bruised, and three parts of honey despumed: Mel passulatum.
Sapes as honey of grapes, which confected of one pound of dry grapes, cleansed
and macerated for a whole day in three pounds of water, then boiled to the
half, afterward strained, and mixed with an equal quantity of honey despumed:
syrups, as another kind of honey of roses, which is made of an equal quantity
of despumed honey, and red rose juice; the Mercuriall honey, or Mel Mercuriale,
is also confected after the like manner, and cocted to the consistency of a
thicker syrup.

And as the consistency of these conserves of roses is various, so is their
description and preparation, for many take the same quantity of roses purged
from their white and of honey, as Mesue also did, but they do not as he,
Rhodomel.
boil them on the fire, but expose them to the heat of the Sun, Mel Rosatum
foliatum.
for the space of ten or twelve days before they repose them in their shops,
thus also Rhodomel prepared without colature, is called by some of a later
stamp Mel Rosatum foliatum, and by others, Conserva mellis Rosarum.

But that which is confected of an equal part of the juice of red roses and of
honey, because of its sapour and consistency, is called the syrrup of the honey
of roses; That same is a mean betwixt both, because made partly of the leaves
and juice of Roses, with an equal weight of honey: yet the former manner of
confection is more approved, after which manner also other Medicinal honeys
are confected of other flowers.

Yet is it better that these be insolated than decocted with fire; Cur prastet
hac insolari quam coqui.
because the odor of flowers, being easily dissipable, perishes, and their
qualities do not remain integrall after cocture, but they will easily endure
insolation, which acting with a temperate and diuturnall heat, not short, and
fervid, better mixes such Medicaments; yet that honey which is made of fresh
roses, is used to be cocted with a slow fire, that which is made of dry roses
should be insolated.

Now, what way soever honey of roses is made, whether of flowers integrall or
broken, it ought first a little to be calefied, that it may be strained, and it
is called, Mel Rosatum Colatum.

As fruits are harder, more difficult to be cocted, and less dissipable than
flowers and leaves, so Medicinal honey is made of these after a different
manner, for insolation will not suffice, but they must be long concocted in
water before honey be put to them, and that fruits may be rightly cocted, they
must first be macerated four and twenty hours in thrice as much water as is
equal to them, then they must be cocted to the third part, or half, then an
equal weight of honey must be added to the colature, and then the concoction
must be perfected in the consistency of a syrup.

CHAP. VI. Of Sapes.
Juices educed out of fruits and herbs, after colation, expurgation, and a
consistency obtained by the benefit of the Sun or fire, are called Sapes, or
medicinated juices, by the Greeks (...), Rob and Sapa quid.
and by the Arabians Rob, or Robub. Sape is properly wine pressed out of white
ripe grapes, and cocted to the consistency of honey, called by the Arabians
Rob. Now any other juice extracted and cocted to a just spissitude is by the
general name called Robub.

Yet these barbarous names are seldom distinguished, but Rob and Robub, are
used without difference for any thick juice, as it is apparent in Mesue, who,
not ignorant of the proper name, calls all concrete juices, rather Rob, than
Robub, though his interpreter judges otherwise.

The Juices are extracted either with a press, or by the compression of ones
hands, and then trajected through a napkin, that whatever of forditude is
therein may cleave to the cloth, and the pure juice may only be transmitted;
which afterward put in a pan or other vessel is insolated, or cocted on a flow
fire till it grow thick, and acquire a solid form. And its watery humidity thus
resolved, it may be preserved many months and years without putrefaction.

Some Juices also are simple, Sapae simplices and compositae.
others compound. Of the simple, some have a friable substance, and a purgative
faculty, which must be longer cocted, that they may acquire perfect solidity,
as Aloes, Scammony, and such like; others have a lent and viscid substance, and
for the most part an astrictive and acid quality, such as all Robs are said to
be by Mesue, ( Distinct. 6.) Those are called compound Sapes or Juices, which
besides their concrete Juices, admit of Sugar, as Rob condited of Barberries,
Rob of Quinces, Mulberries, and such Fruits.

As therefore sweet Wine only boiled to the third, Desrutum quid.
and despumed, still remaining liquid, is called Defrutum; so Wine expressed in
a harder Consistency, inspissated by heat, is properly called Sapa; which also
may be called Rob or Robub. If any be more sollicitous about the name than the
thing it self, he may equally refer the name Robub to all Juices.

The use of Sapes is commended to many things, Saparum usus.
especially to diseases in the mouth; and they are sometimes prescribed alone,
sometimes to be mixed with other Confections, as to Diamorum, Diacodium, and
other Syrups.

CHAP. VII. Of Conserves.
SEeing the virtue of Flowers may be easily dissipated, it can scarce be long
retained integral, but is much impaired with coction and time, and often
resolved. Now that it may be retained, Flowers are wont to be condited in Sugar
or Honey, and a Compound is made, that may be preserved for many months and
years, without any great impairing of virtue; whence it is properly called a
Conserve; whereof we have two different kinds, Conservarum differentia.
the one is liquid and soft, which will yield to the pressure of ones finger,
wherein is left some lentor; the other dry, which is much more solid, and made
into Pastils or Trochisks, to which our fingers rather yield.

But because all Flowers have not a like compact substance, or like temper,
they are not all condited after the same manner, nor require the same quantity
of Sugar in their conditure.

Those that are more humid should taleby a day or two in a place neither too
humid, nor too hot, that their superfluous humidity may be resolved. Those that
are dryer, by how much they are more fresh and succulent, by so much the better.

Amongst the more humid, whereof Conserves are made, we reckon the Flowers of
Water Lillies, Roses, Succory, Violets, Borage, and Bugloss; amongst the dryer
Flowers, of Sage, Hyssop, Rosemary, Oranges, Jasmine, Betony, Peach-trees, and
many other Simples, which are seldom or never condited.

The more humid require a greater quantity of Sugar to their confection, the
dryer a less; to some an equal weight of Sugar is sufficient, to other half
their weight, to many twice their weight, to Roses and Water Lillies thrice
their weight is requisite.

Some are integrally mixed with twice their weight, or a sufficient quantity of
Sugar, and are set to be insolated one or two months, according to the
crassitude or tenuity of the Flowers.

Others, as Roses, after their purgation from the white, Conserva rosarum qui
fiat.
whereby they are fastened to the bud, and their triture in a stone mortar with
a pestel of Box wood, are mixed exquisitely with thrice their weight of Sugar,
and then reposed in an earthen pot well leaded, and are well covered with a
paper not forated, lest the virtue of the Flowers should be dissipated.

This done, the vessel is insolated by the space of a whole month, or forty
days, for hereby the Conditure is excellently fermentated, the heat of the Sun
permeating every part thereof, if it be stirred twice or thrice a week with a
Spatula, which is effected without any dissipation of its virtues or odor.

Some immerge and perfectly mix integral Flowers, sometimes and often braying in
Sugar melted and cocted to the consistency of an Electuary, which when it is
cold, they put in boxes, and insolate it.

If in the conditing, a little juice of Lemmon be injected, Quomodo conserva
rubra fiat.
it will attain a red and lively color, that it will not lose in a years
space, if it be reposed in a Vessel while it is hot; for afterward
refrigerating, a certain scum or crust arises upon the superficies, which
preserves the color, odor, and virtue longer.

Conserves are seldom made of leaves, because their substance is more compact,
and quality less dissipable; for they may be brought from far Countries,
without impairing their virtues. Yet some, which have excellent faculties
posited in their superficies, cannot be dried without damage, as Sorrel, and
Capillus veneris. And therefore Conserves may well be made of them well purged,
as of Monspelian, Maidens hair, which is accounted the best, as many other
Simples abundant in that Country. Yet have I heard the City Monspelier more
commended for Medicks than Medicaments.

However, excellent Conserves of Maidens-hair is carried from Monspelier to all
the Countries in France, which is made of an equal quantity of pulverated
Sugar, and cleansed Leaves brayed and mixed together, after insolated so long
as is convenient.

Some hold this Conserve to be better, if a Syrup perfectly cocted be made of
the decoction of this herb and Sugar, and then mixed to other cleansed and
brayed Leaves of this herb, for thus it acquires a more excellent virtue, and a
more fit consistency.

Dry Conserve is made of dry Roses levigated very small with eight times their
quantity of Sugar boiled in Rose Water to the consistency of an Electuary,
Conservae ex rosis siccis.
to which a little juice of some sour Simple, as Lemmons or Sorrel, may be
mixed; for this juice does not only make it sweet, and sour, and pleasant to
the taste, but of a more red and pleasant color.

By the same art may other dry Conserves be made of dry Flowers.

CHAP. VIII. Of Condites in general.
ROots, Conditura cur fiat.
Fruits, and other parts of Plants are condited either for conservation, or for
sapour, or both. For Conservations sake many are condited with Salt or Vinegar,
and sometimes both, as Olives, Capers, Samphire, Cucumbers, and Broom-flowers.
For Sapours sake, the pills of Oranges, Lemons, Almonds, Pine-apples, Cloves,
Nuts, and many Seeds are confected with Honey or Sugar. For both Conservation
and Sapours sake, many Roots, Fruits, and Flowers, as the root of Ragwort,
Pears, Plums, Barberries, and the flowers of Bugloss and Violets, both that
they may taste better, and keep longer.

And such things as are to be condited, are first concocted in an apt syrup,
and reposed and reserved with it in an carthen glass or vessel, which are
called by Apothecaries, Condita liquida.
liquid Condites. But if after perfect Concoction they be exposed to the open
air till their superficies be dry, and that viscid lentor, wherewith they
cleaved to the fingers of such as touch them, Confecturae siccae.
be resolved, then are they called dry Confectures.

Hereunto by a certain affinity may be referred a certain kind of Condite,
which is called Pasta regia, or a Mazapane: but we shall treat of that more
positively in our fifth Book, in our Treatise of particular Remedies.

Those Delicates which the Confectioners call Tragemata, Tragemata.
i.e. Junkets, may be referred to solid Condites; for they, as other Condites,
are prepared by the help of the fire, and the addition of Sugar, but after a
different manner. For examples sake; if Seeds are to be condited, the Sugar
must first be cocted into the consistency of a syrup, then is it by little and
little poured upon the Seeds; then are they moved with ones hand, and that so
long, till the Seeds be covered and incrustated all over with the Sugar.
Lemmons pills small cut, as also Cynamon, are condited after the same manner.
Now Fruits being humid, they require a liquid Confecture, and Seeds being dry,
a dry one.

CHAP. IX. Of Powders.
THE Medicinal Art can by no means want Powders; for when Medicaments are
either too humid, or dry, by the Greeks called (...); the dry for the most part
are pulverated, the humid are made up and concinnated with these Powders, as
Electuaries, solid Conserves, Trochisks, Plasters, and other Medicaments, both
intrinsecally to be assumed, and extrinsecally to be applied; for nothing in
Surgery is more frequently prescribed than incarnating, astringing, and
closing Powders; Pulverum in Chirurgia frequens usus.
and nothing so carefully prepared and kept of Apothecaries as cordial,
capital, and roborating Powders, which are not only mixed with other forms of
Medicaments, but oftentimes prescribed alone to diverse uses and affections, as
to roborate the principal parts, preserve their strengths, extinguish Poisons,
stay Fluxes, help concoction, to bind or lose the belly.

Many external passions are often cured with these alone, Pulvis vulnerarius
optimus.
seldom without them, as any Wound with red Powder compounded of two parts of
Dragons-blood, and one of Frankincense, as a great Ulcer after detersion with
incarnating Powder. Pulvis epuloticus optimus.
Thus a slash or skar of a Wound is closed with an Epulotical Powder, the best
whereof are the Powders of Pompholix, Brass oar, Ceruse, Spodium, Terra Lemnia,
and Lead, rightly prepared.

Now generally, Pulveres in medicina quid praestent.
Medicaments are either given in the form of Powders, or of them other forms
are made, borrowing their matter from Powders; for these do not only serve for
to be fitted to the forms of several Medicaments, but whether you look to the
body, or the quality of Medicaments, these are for the most part their very
Basis.

And Powders are made of the most select Medicaments beaten more or less, as
the nature of the Medicament, or the exigency of the matter requires. And all
that are levigated or redacted into Powder, are called of the Latins by a
general name, Pulveres; which the Arabians call distinctly by these three
idioms, Sufful, Alkool, Alkool, Sufful, Sief.
and Sief. Sufful denotes any kind of Powder, whether small or great. Alkool
that which is very small. Sief denotes the attrition of certain Trochisks upon
a Marble, mixed with Rose, Fennel, or other convenient water, to the griefs of
the eyes.

Now some Powders, to wit, such as are made by the Confectioners, are
destinated only to Sauces, as the Powders of Pepper, Ginger, Nutmeg, Cynamon,
and such like sweet Spices; and they are called of the Seplasiaries, small
Spices, which they used to keep in Leather bags. Other Powders are cordial, and
roborative, which pertain only to the Medicinal Art, as the Powder of
Diarrhodon Abbatis, Diacynamon, Dianisi, Laetitia Galeni, and other cordial
Powders, which should be reposed in boxes, glasses, or pots close covered, lest
their virtue suddenly expire. Other Powders are also made, as Cathartick
Powders, which are only for present, not future uses, because by keeping they
are much worse and weaker.

Yet scarce is any Powder internally assumed alone, and unmixed, but is put in
water, or some other liquor, though not so applied externally, which we often
lay to Wounds and Ulcers alone.

Perfumers, Cosmeticorum studium.
Chamberers, and such as would take away wrinkles from old women with painting,
and promise to fascinate and cure stinking breaths, make several Powders of
suaveolent Spices, as of the root of Orris, of Roses, Sandals, Storax,
Betzoini, sweet Cane, Cynamon, Cloves, Marjorum, Amber, Musk, Civet; of which,
and other odoriferous Simples, they make two excellent Powders, which they call
Chyprium and Violetum; and also many other and various Powders for the
delectation of them that desire them. They are wont to repose them in silken
bags, and put them in chests with their clothes. But the Apothecary need not be
sollicitous about these, for whom it is more expedient to have good Pulvis
Diamargaritonis, than Chyprium.

CHAP. X. Of Eclegms in general.
A Certain Medicament is made for the diseases of the Lungs, something thicker
than a Syrup, and more liquid than an Electuary, which the Arabians call
Lodoch; the Greeks, (...), and (...), and sometimes (...); the Latins,
Linctus: for it is assumed by little and little, as it were by licking or
sucking, that by staying and lingering in the passage, it may deerre into the
breast, or at least its cough-curing virtue may reach the cavities of the
Breast, and the grisles of the Lungs concoct Spittle, and cause its exclusion,
which by the strength of nature may easily be done after concoction of the
humor by a Vomit, or Expectoration upwards.

Now they are not only exhibited in a morning upon a fasting stomach, but also
at evening, and sometimes betwixt meals, to several effects, and for several
intentions, and according to the matter, intention and quality whereof the
Medicaments consist; for they are given to leniate, deterge, incrassate,
incide, expectorate, and stay blood. Eclegms also, according to the Ancients,
may be made of Medicaments of any sapour: yet very bitter and very sharp
Medicaments we do not approve of for this use; for besides that ungrateful
sense they bring to the palate, they exasperate the hollow artery, and the
jaws, and greatly molest the lungs: yet are sou^ ones sometimes prescribed for
the attenuation of gross humors.

But use has so far prevailed, that in the confecture of Coughcuiing Eclegms,
it is almost a Law, that nothing but sweet Ingredients should make up the
Compound, as juice of Liccorish, Pines, Jujubs, Sugar Candy, Dragaganth, and
such like Electuaries, mixed in Honey, or some fit Syrup.

But if the condition of any affection preternaturally require bitter or sharp
Ingredients, then must they be mixed with the other Medicaments in a less
quantity, both that they may be more easily assumed, and also that in altering
the humor contained, they may not hurt the part containing. Quae eclegmata
conveniant Asthmaticis.
Such Lohochs as these are for their notable faculty in inciding and opening,
commended to the pursy, and such as breath difficultly, because of gross
humors in their Lungs.

An Eclegm should be assumed upon a stick of Liccorish a little beaten, or out
of some little measure, and holden in the mouth till it melt of its own accord,
and till it slide down the mouth of the stomach, or insinuate it self into the
Artery subjected.

They are reposed in earthen vessels leaded, and may be kept a whole year
without impairing their virtues. Yet such as in their Confecture receive
Almonds, or Nuts, as they grow moldy sooner, so do their faculties sooner fail
and decay.

There is to be sold in Shops a certain Electuary somewhat liquid for Glisters,
and it is made of one pound of the decoction of Violets, Malva, the herb
Mercury, Pelitory of the wall, Beets and Wormwood, with the same weight of the
Pitch of Cassia, and Honey despumed, which being thicker than any Syrup, and
borrowing its color and virtue from Cassia, is called Lohoch of Cassia. Lohoch
cassia.


CHAP. XI. Of Electuaries in general.
SUch Medicaments as externally applied can cure any Poison, whether within the
body, or inflicted on the body by some bite, are by the Greeks called (...);
and those (...) which introsumed help many grievous affections. The Latins do
not only retain and confound both these names, but also denote them by the
name of Electuary to us; for the Ancients called them Antidotes, the later men
Electuaries. Whereof, according to their different consistency there be two
kinds, the one solid, which Apothecaries make into little pieces, which they
call Lozenges, the other more liquid made and formed into the consistency of an
opiate.

But if according to Galen, the difference of Antidotes, or Electuaries be
taken from their quality and virtues, some are assumed because of deadly
Medicaments, others are prevalent against venomous beasts, others are
prescribed to diseases contracted by ill victuals, and some are accommodated
to all these uses, which may not only be wholsomley introsumed, but also,
externally applied, as Triacle Mithridate.

Electuaries according to their different solidity, are called Dry and
Tabulated, Electuaria sicca ac tabulata.
or Liquid, which have the consistency of an opiate, a mean betwixt an Eclegme
and Pills, as all Antidotes, whose powders are subactd with sape, honey, or
wine, which put to sugar righly prepared, and agitated with a wooden pestell
do acquire the just consistency of a solid Electuary: So that wine, and the
same Electuary may be formed liquid or solid according to the adjection of
sugar or honey with artificial mixtion, yet they can scarce be brought to a
solid Consistency which admit of the extract of Cassia, and the inner part of
fruits.

The proportion of honey to powders in liquid Electuaries should be the same
with sugar to them in dry and solid Electuaries, which is that to one pound of
honey or sugar should be mixed three ounces of Powder, yet either may be
increased or diminished, as the power of the Antidote is requisite to be more
valid or more weak, for by how much more sugar or honey is added to the
powders, by so much is the Electuary weaker, and by how much the less, by so
much the stronger.

In purging Lozenges, one dram of powder should be mixed with an ounce of
sugar cocted in water, or some juice, to a consistency somewhat more solid than
a syrup in Cord all Lozenges; two ounces of sugar often go to one dram of
powder, the quantity whereof should be by so much lesser, by how much the
quality is stronger, and the sapour more ungrateful.

But Physicians should define a just quantity of sugar or honey, Medicorum
error.
for while they prescribe only according to their custom, as much as will
serve of either indefinitly, they leave the Apothecary doubtful in making the
Electuary, and they commit the sick persons safety to his judgment; for he may
make the strength of the Medicament more weak, or more intense, as he pleases,
and you shall scarce find two Apothecaryes who put the same proportion of sugar
or honey to the same remedy, when the quantity is not prescribed.

In the Confecture of the liquid Antidote, Electuarium liquidum faciendi modus.
the honey is washed with a little water, and boiled by little and little on a
moderate fire, and despumed, till the water, or other liquor be exhaled, then
it is taken off the fire, and before it be absolute cold, three ounces of the
mixed powders are sprinkled upon the honey, every pound of honey so prepared
requires three ounces of Powder, and then they are mixed with a wooden
postell, till the mixture be equal.

The weight of honey should not be changed, because of the mixture of the pulpe
of Cassia, Tamarinds, or Manna, Dactyls, and Almonds, or other fruits, for in
confecting an Electuary of a Legitimate consistency, the weight of dry powders
must be answerable to the sape, honey, or sugar.

A soft Electuary should not be reposed in a box, before it be thoroughly cold,
least its superior part be extrinsecally incrusted in a certain Membrane, it
is betetr to let it be fermented, and the crassitude equal.

Sugar also must be prepared before it receive powders for it should be
dissolved in stillatitious water, or other fit liquour, Electuarium siccum
faciendi modus.
and then be despumed, and boiled softly on a fire till it be thicker than
(...) syrup, and till a drop thereof will not dilate it self, and after a
little refr^geration the several species must be by little and little added,
confounded, and mixed with a Spatula till it have got its who^e solidity and
equability, then it must be laid on a marble before it be cold, and with the
Spatula dilated and planed, when it is cold, it may be cut into Lozenges square
or round, of one, two, or three dramms weight, which after they be brought to
the hardness of sugar must be laid in boxes or Chests.

Of what consistency soever the Electuary be; whether solid or soft, it
preserves the strength of the simples, well and long. Yet does the soft
preserve it longer than the solid, because its humidity being greater, it more
constraines the faculty of the Medicaments, and hinders them from being
dissipated by the air.

By how much an Electuary is more grateful to the Palate, by so much the
sooner does its energy and faculty decay, for its efficacy will scarce endure
a year, bitter; and ungrateful will endure two or three years, and the
Antidote against wild beasts bitings, or poisons, sometimes ten years without
damage.

CHAP. XII. Of Hiera.
HIerae differ little from the Opiate, Hiera pierae unde habeant nomen.
Opiates from liquid Electuaries, for they have all the same consistency, and
often the same purging faculty, yet Electuaries and Opiates do sometimes purge,
neither molesting the belly, nor displeasing the palate with their sapour, but
Hierae besides their purging faculty which they always have, are very bitter
and unacceptable, which their name shows, for they are called Picrae, for
their exceeding bitterness, as Hiera. i. e. holy for their excellent effects.
They are compounded of loosening and bitter, yet Medicaments good for the
stomach, which incide and gently purge gross, and phlegmatic humors out of
the first region of the body, Hiera picra Galeni d^citur, quod eam emendarit.
and especially those that are called Galens Hierae, because changed and mended
by him, ( Cap. 11. lib. 8. comp. med. local.) which (says he) are the best
remedy for the Melanchollicke affections of the belly; for many stomachicall
Maladyes have been cured by him in one day therewith; for since Aloes is mixed
hereunto, which is very good for the stomach, and Cynamon, which is effectual
in opening, exterging, and attenuating (for it is of very thin parts) they may
be exhibited usefully for all gross and viscous humors, Quib us conveniat,
and quibus non.
and all affections about the belly and stomach, proceeding from vicious juice,
but not if they proceed from a sharp fever.

Hiera whose faculty is to calefy and exiccate, may not be securely used, in
those fevers whereby humors are accended in the vessels, and whereby the
whole body is inflamed, though by Galens advice, they may safely be used in
fevers that are not vehement: there are besides Galens Picrae, Hierae variae
descriptae.
Hierae variously described, various compositions, which from their effects are
called Hierae, and from their sapours Picrae, as from that matter, which in
composition, quantity, or quality is preheminent, one Hiera is called the
Colloquintidan Hiera, others are confected under the names of Logadius,
Pacchus, or Myrepfius, either because they first invented their compositions,
or else altered, augmented and corrected them.

The descriptious composition and powers of every one shall be largely treated
of, taught and explained in our book termed the shop: some Hierae, have their
purgative power only from Aloes, and that not potent, and Galen. cap. 2. lib.
4. de loc. affect. says, that they scarce condescend to the places about the
Liver, unless they be taken in a more ample weight, they may be commodiously
given for the suffusion or web in the eye, because they rather educe noxious
humors from the brain, than from the stomach; but such as admit of
Coloquintida, or Agarick, or both, or scammony, do potently move the belly, and
draw hurtful humors from all the parts of the body, and purge them out.

CHAP. XIII. Of Opiates in general.
OPiates are reckoned amongst liquid Electuaries, and so called, because they
have Opium in their mixture, or from their similitude to Hypnoticall
Medicaments, or from their consistency presently after their insp^ssation, or
peradventure from their Color which in Opium, or the juice of black poppy, and
in liquid Antidotes, whether Cordial, or opening, is the same.

And although the Ancients call those Medicaments only Opiates, too strictly,
which admit of Opium in their mixture, of what consistency soever, whether
solid, as the Alcumists Ladanum, and Pills of Cynoglosson, or soft, as the
Roman Philonium; yet are they in a larger sense taken for any soft Confections,
Cordial, altering, Opiatarum appellatio amplissima.
purging, or narcoticall, whether they admit Opium, as Antidotes against
venomous beasts, or they consist only in cordial and altering ingredients, as
Alkermes, and the confection of violets, or of purging ingredients as Triphera,
Diaprunum, and such like, which are oftener called by the names of Electuaries,
and Confections, than Opiates.

Now Opiates were invented by Physicians of ancient note ( Gal. Opiatae cur
inventae.
cap. 2. lib. 2. de loc. affect. Aet. c. 12. lib. 2. de sign. and cause. diut
morb.) to leniate the rigor of griefs; for grief being a sad passion, Dolor
quid.
grievous to nature, and hard to be endured, it does variously exagitate
humors, corrupt the blood, accend a fever, and deject the spirits: Ejus
affectus.
so that the Physician is sometimes compelled, to relinquish the former
disease, that he may cure this great symptom with these presidies, which
though they take not away the cause of the disease, yet they so refresh the
senses and spirits by conciliating ease and sleep, that the strength of the
symptoms being debated, they may afterward extrude the causes of the disease
more easily.

The vehemency therefore of grief is to be deceived, Doloris vehementia
desperationis interdum parens.
sometimes with Narcoticall Medicaments, which is sometimes so prevalent, that
it drives men to that Madness, that they had rather dye than live, and
therefore lay violent hands upon themselves.

Galen has observed ( Cap. 5. lib. 7. comp. med. loc.) such vehehement
vexations and torments in Co^icall dolours, Confectiones Coli^ae.
which might be leniated by several Medicaments, that he described certain
Narcoticall Opiates, and left them to posterity, which he called Colical
confections, which may mitigate the vehemence of the symptom, stay the motion
of humors, and stupify the senses: hence they are called Narcoticall opiates,
because they bring to the parts a certain necrosy or mortification, and they
are called Annodyna i. e. grief-absolving Medicines, because for present they
mitigate and absolve from pain and grief. For Anodynes are not all of one
sort, Paregorica quae.
for some are Paregoricall or leniating, which are temperate, and most agreeing
without heat, as Hydreole, the root of Lillies boiled in milk, and oil of
Almonds. Others are called Alliotical, which leniate the grief, Alliotica.
to which they are averse by some opposite quality, as oil of roses, of violets
to a grief moderately, oil of water lillies to a grief impensely hot, oil of
Laurall, or Anisseseeds to a cold dolor, others are also called Narcoticall
Opiates, Narcotica.
which by stupifying the senses take away the dolor, which must not be used
rashly, for lying too long to a place, they extinguish the heat thereof,
resolve the nerves, and take away at once, both motion and sense: and as Galen
observes ( Cap. 18. lib. 5. simplic. med.) taken in too great quantity kills.

Which is evidenced by the most perilous experiences of jugglars and
deceivers, who with their shining Stibium stir up torments and other grievous
symptoms, wherewith they may cover their error with a worse, do indeed take
away dolours, by their narcoticall Opiates, neither rightly made, nor applied:
For they easily conciliate sleep, but such a one as intrudes the diseased into
Charons boat, Somniserum Empericorum.
not in this world again to awake, whence it is true that Empiricks Hypnoticall
medicines is often the cure of all evils.

I will not here relate stories well known to me of these impious
periclitatours, least I should digress too far from my purpose, and because
the work would be immense, if I should here insert what I have received from
men of credit.

Now Narcoticks are improperly, and only as to their nomination called
Anodynes: for besides their Elementary quality whereby they refrigerate, they
are endued with another that is hostile and deletary to our native heat,
unless they be taken in a smaall quantity, and also then, and so prepared, as
is meet, as Opium, Mandrake, Henbane, and Hemlock.

Anodynes proper so called, Anod yna quae.
are paregoricall, hot in the first degree, or temperate, or little exceeding a
simmetry, which may be safely, either assumed or applied.

Medicaments therefore that admit, Opium, or other Narcoticks must be taken in
a small weight, and are truly called Opiates of what Consistency soever they
be. Yet other soft altering, purging, and roborating Cofections are now also
termed Opiates.

CHAP. XIV. Of Pills.
PIlls have their name from the form of a little ball or bullet, Pilulae cur
ita dictae. Unde dicantur catapotia.
which because they are not chewed, but swallowed whole, are called by the
Greeks (...), for because of the ungrateful sapour, and odor of those
simples, whereof they are confected, as Aloes, Coloquintida, Agarick, Opoponax,
Sagapenes and other sharp, stinking and bitter simples, they are formed in a
sphericall effigy, in a solid consistency, and exhibited in a small quantity,
that they may be assumed with more ease, and less trouble, for the exiguity of
the Medicament makes it easier to be swallowed, and the solidity less to be
dissolved; the round form sooner to slide down, to stay longer in the
ventricle, to draw more efficaciously from parts remote, and not so soon to
pass into the intestines, or to be excluded by vomiting; for liquid
Medicaments are often assumed and disgorged in the same instant.

Pills are frequently, because of their insuavity, covered with leafs of Gold,
and many odoriferous spices are often mixed artificially with them, whereby
they are made more pleasant and grateful to the palate and bowels, yet if
they be a little holden in the mouth, or compressed with the tongue or teeth
before deglution, they will not only affect the sense with an ill taste, but
also as it were, incite the horror and subversion of the ventricle; all Pills
are bitter, save a few, Pilularum sapor ingratus.
as those that are prescribed to Coughs which are not presently, devoured, but
kept long in the mouth, that they may melt and be swallowed by little and
little, and these are not so properly called Catapotia or pills, as pastills or
trochiskes.

The bitterness of Pills is attributed, especially to Aloes, which is their
very basis, and which can scarce be assumed otherwise because of its egregious
amaritude, and because of its viscidity whereby it conjoynes powders, and
compels them into pills.

Now this bitterness is increased by the commixtion of other ungrateful
things, as of Coloquintida, Agarik, Senny, and other purgative Medicaments,
which will be so much the more unacceptable to the Palate, by how much more
bitter ingredients are admixed, as are pills made of Coloquintida, Aloes,
Agarick, Scammony and Gum Arabic, which Galen prescribes to purge many kinds
of Excrements ( Cap. 14. lib. 5. Method.)

Now there are many kinds of Pills, Pilularum magna varietas.
partly drawn from the diversity of the members, to which they are destinated,
and partly from the diversity of humors, which they draw from the parts: some
are called Capital pills which purge phlegm out of the head, as Cochiae, and
such as are made of Agarick: others Opticall, because they consist of many
things that are thought good for the eyes, as Pil. Lucis majoris and minoris:
others stomachicall, as pills before meat, and made of Rhubarbe: others
Artheticall, which educe humors from the Articles, from the diversity whereof
some are called Phlegmagogall, which purge Phlegm, others Cholagogall which
purge Choler, other Melanagogall which purge and move Melancholicall succe,
and from their operation they are said to loose the belly by astringing, as
Pills of Rhabarb and Myrobolanes, or by moderate drawing, as Pills of Agarick, or
by drawing and expurging together, as pills of Euphorbium.

The greatest part of simples to be mixed in the Confection of the lump for
Pills should be beaten into small powder, Pilularum compositio ut recto fiat.
then put into honey despumed, or into the slimy matter of Tragaganthum
dissolved in some convenient succe, or rather into some convenient syrup, which
has some viscidity fit to make the confused seeds stick in the mixture, and
not gape for siccity, that also the simples may be fermented being included in
such a mixture, and that their faculty may not so soon exhale: for this cause,
says Sylvius, all kinds of Pills should be comprehended in cocted honey, for
being comprehended in water or succe, they do not cohere, but like bread made
of bran they are presently exficcated, made friable, and decay.

But if Pills admit gumms, and inspissated juices, those juices should be
mollifid before in some thine Liquor be moved, with a hot Pestell, and then be
put to the mixture of the powders, and last of all be confusedly mixed with as
much honey or other viscid humor, as the mixture requires, that it may be made
into dough, or a soft lump; for it will daily harden, which after two or three
days must be liniated with a little oil of Almonds, and then obvolved in fine
leather, or some thin bladder, it must at last be reposed in a tin or leaden
box.

When a part of that mass is to be used, Crass^ties pilularum qualis esse
debeat.
it must answer a definite Dosis, and if need be, be beaten with a fit juice,
that it may be mollified, and pills may thereof be made greater, or lesser, or
mean, as we desire they should stay more or less time in the belly.

Pills, Pilulae validiores quando jumendae.
that draw humor strongly from the head or other remote parts, should be
exhibited four or five hours after a slender supper, or about midnight, and
it is good to sleep after they be assumed.

Such as purge benignly, Benignae quando.
may be safely swallowed an hour or two before any meal, such as are in a
mean are most safely used upon a jejune stomach in the morning.

Half a dram is enough to move the belly, Pilularum dosis.
often a whole dram is given of the valid to purge more potently, and to strong
bodies a dram and half, which purge gross humors; some there are who are
averse to all pills, others to none, some will assume none, but the greater
sort, others none but little ones in a spoon with much syrup, many will scarce
assume any, unless they be involved in cherryes or the skins of dry grapes,
some will swallow them hidden in the yolk of an egg, or in the leaves of
spinach or lettices cocted; others will swallow then after some other manner,
for their ungrateful sapour has invented a thousand ways to assume them.

CHAP. XV. Of Trochisks.
SOme Medicaments are from the form of little wafers called (...), as it were
little round bread like lupines, or sometimes (...), by the Latins, Pastills,
Orbicles, and they are thus formed for the Medicaments conservation, and
sometimes correction; for Medicaments are more safely kept in that solid form,
than in powders.

Yet they must be pulverated for use, Pilulae bechicae.
if they cannot be assumed whole, such only excepted, as by some are called
Bechicall pills, which must melt in the mouth, for Trochisks of Scilla, and
vipers, in in the confecture of a Treacle, lose the form of pastills, and are
pulverated.

And they are made of Medicaments for the most part dry or beaten, and
dissolved with wine, water, or other liquor, till they acquire the consistency
of pills, and then they are formed into orbicles, and then dried in a shade
before they be reposed in boxes where they may be kept a whole year, sometimes
two or three, especially if they admit of Opium in their confection, or any
valid Medicament, whose strength is not easily dissipated, Trochisks, therefore
because of their obdurity and density do preserve very long that strength of
those Medicaments whereof they consist, and they more easily resist the injury
of the air: which Powders cannot do, but being very small condescend to the
air, and are therewith easily changed: yet are not all Trochisks made of
Powders, but some of Medicaments which cannot be pulverated, as Scilla and
vipers flesh.

Neither are Trochisks only introsumed, but also externally applied, those
that are assumed at the mouth, as they may be made of every kind of
Medicaments, so do they receive from Medicaments their roborating, purging and
altering faculties: those are said to roborate, which having respect to a
particular place, augment its strength, as Trochisks of Galliae Moschatae
roborate the brain, Trochisciroborantes.
of Terra lemnia the heart, of Rhabarbe the Liver, of Diarrhodon the ventricle,
of Capers the spleen, such as are confected of Catharticks retain the strength
of their simples, and by moving the belly, Purgantes.
expel the humors, as Trochisks of Agarick, Alhanhal, and of Rhabarbe: we
judge the same of altering Trochisks, Alterantes.
which by their opposite quality change any distemper, as cold hot, or hot
cold, dry moist, or moist dry.

Neither do we want Trochisks for external affections, as those which from
their form, color and Author are called white Trochisks of Rhases, and many
other which are grinded on a marble, that Sief may be made for Collyries to
many affections of the eyes.

The peculiar Confection of Trochisks shall be more largely explained in our
book entitled, the shop, it rests now that we treat of those Medicaments which
are only externally applied.

THE SECOND SECTION OF THE THIRD BOOK; Wherein is delivered a general
explication of external Medicaments.
CHAP. I. Of Oils.
AS all Diseases are either internally generated, or externally annexed, so all
Remedies that are prescribed to them are either internal, of which we have
largely heretofore treated; or external, to which we shall now speak. And we
shall begin our explication of local Medicaments with Oil, which by right
vindicates the first place to it self; because the Apothecary may want many
Medicaments, but scarce Oil at all, ( Gal. cap. 3. lib. 6. simpl. med.) Oleum
alimentum est and medicamentum.
For it is not only brought to the table because it is sweet, and expressed
out of mature Olives, for hereunto we understand the denomination of Oil
properly attributed; but the very basis of Unguents, Plasters, and
Sear-cloaths, and the common bond of those Simples whereof they are confected.
And because it is of it self temperate, or hot and moist in the first degree,
or as Galen says, ( cap. 25. lib. 3. simpl. medic.) because it is a medium
betwixt hot and cold, moist and dry Medicaments, it helps lassitude and
wearisomeness, leniates asperities, mollifies and cleanses the squalid skin,
and both wholsomely and pleasantly cures many affections, which he mentions,
( cap, 6, and 7. lib. 2. simpl. medic.)

Now Oils which are frequently used, Oleorum differentiae.
are either simple or compound; those are simple which are homogeneal, and
receive nothing from Art but extraction, which is made without the mixture of
other things. Pallas inventrix olei.
After which manner Minerva first educed Oil, and taught that Art, as Diodorus
writes; for before her Garden there was an Olive tree unknown to all, as also
the use of Oil, which before that time no man had taught how to educe.

And almost all Oils drawn out by expression are simple, as Oils simply so
called, which is expressed out of mature Olives, Omotribes, Oleum omotribes.
or Omphacinum, which is of unripe Olives; as also Oil of Almonds, Wallnuts,
and other Fruits, as other Oils educed out of Seeds, which differ even as the
Seeds: for hot Oil is extracted out of hot Seeds, and cold out of cold Seeds.
Yet all Oils are somewhat changed with age; and because of the dissipation from
the watery part, that which is hot becomes hotter, and the cold refrigerates
more slowly; for old Oil, according to Galen, (cap. 6. lib. 1. compos. medic.
secundum gener.) has power to extenuate; which is an effect of heat.

Oil also, according to the diversity of the Fruit out of which it is
extracted, as being mature or immature, and according to the manner of
preparation and alteration induced by Art, acquires another and different
quality and efficacy in alteration. As for example, Oleum ovorum
Oil of Eggs yolks, though it be not perfectly mixed, yet by losing some
humidity by its preparation, it is more hot and dry, and is a Medicine most
useful in smoothing the skin, and curing an impetiginous itching, and other
affectious of the skin, as also some fistulous and malign ulcers.

The same quality happens to all, expressed by the force of the fire, from
which they perpetually retain their acquired heat. Olei amygdalini facultas.
And when Oil of Almonds is thus extracted, it is only extrinsecally applied;
when without fire, it is sucked up like a grateful Lohoch, to ease the
asperity of the rough artery, and coct and move Spittle; so that it is often
given with a little Sugar to Children that are troubled with coughing, or that
have any distillation from the brain to the lungs, without any purging
Medicaments, especially without anodynal Medicaments.

That Oils may be extracted, the Fruits and Seeds should first be purged, and
the Apothecaries do ill that extract Oil out of Almonds before decortication.
The Seeds cleansed, are brayed with a pestel; Olea exprimendi modus.
after contusion they are put into a pan, and set upon the fire, and stirred
pretty long, that they may calefy: then are they involved in a rough cloth, and
subjected to a wooden press, till by valid compression the Oils be expressed.

Those that we would educe without the help of fire or heat, must after they be
bruised very small, be presently put into the press, that the Oil may exude by
drops.

Petreol, which is educed out of Saltpeter, from whence it has its
denomination, takes place amongst simple Oils. But our purpose is to treat of
such as are made by Art. Liquidambor and Balsam also are simple Oils, which
distill by drops out of the incisions of foreign Trees. But more of this in
our Shop.

Some simple Oils also are distilled sometimes as well by ascent as by descent,
as out of Juniper, Guaiacum, Cloves, and such like, Olea educta per ascensum
and descensum.
both wood and dry Fruits, which being put into a pot, Oil ascends into the
vessel above, by virtue of the fire set under; or descends into the vessel set
under, by virtue of the fire above. Yet are not all Oils extracted by descent,
nor always by the help of the fire; for Oil may easily exude out of Tartarum
and Myrrh included in a bag, and suspended in a moist place, as in a
Wine-cellar. Of all which manners of educing Oils, more elsewhere.

But compound Oils, wherewith the Apothecary should be especially furnished,
are such, in which the matter of stocks, fruits, flowers, and of any simple, is
infused and macerated. After which, the whole is insolated, till the strength
of the matter remain in the Oil, which is afterward expressed and reposed.
After this manner are made the Oil of Violets, Roses, St. John's wort,
Water Lillies, and many more, which the Greeks call (...), the Latins
Unguenta; and especially those which may be inspissated by the admistion of
gums, and odoriferous things; whence they are called Myropolitans, or
Unguentarians, who sold such Oils and Unguents as were suaveolent, with whom
any fragrant Oil was taken for an Unguent, as Unguents for Oils.

We scarce approve of their opinion which call only them simple Oils which are
made of Flowers, Fruits, or other Simples infused, macerated and insolated in
Oil of Olives: and those compound Oils which are cocted on a slow fire with
wine, water, infusion, or convenient decoction, till almost all the admixed
humor be assumed; for those seem no less, but rather more compound than these,
because not only the total power of the things infused, but a good portion of
the substance in which it inheres, remains with the Oil after expression in the
former. Hence that Oil which partakes of no excess, but is temperate, is such
perpetually from the condition of the thing infused; which if cold, then is the
Oil cold; if hot, hot; if it have the power to exsiccate, then will the Oil
exsiccate.

Such Oils as are educed by expression only, Quibus vasis olea servanda.
or by maceration and expression together, may be most safely kept, if reposed
in vessels of glass or clay, perfectly before hardened with the valid heat of a
furnace. But such as are educed by distillation, whether by ascent or descent,
which are commonly called Chemists essences, must always be kept in solid
glass vessels with strait orifices, close covered, left their substance and
quality being dissipable, soon expire.

CHAP. II. Of Unguents.
UNguents, as Galen testifies, ( cap. ult. lib. 7. simpl. med.) were called by
the Ancients, Oily Medicaments, confected of suaveolent spices; and according
to Actuarius, ( cap. 1. lib. 5. meth.) are only externally applied, and being
only spread along, are thought to benefit but such parts as cannot endure
other remedies; such parts, as Oribasius, ( cap. 27. lib. collect.) says, are
grieved with Cataplasms, and hurt with fluent madefactions.

Now Unguents are of a grosser consistency than Oils, and a mean betwixt Oils
and Plasters, as Liniments betwix: Oils and Unguents; for a more liquid
Unguent is called very often a Liniment; Unguenta cur dicta and inventa.
of the confection and use whereof, we shall treat more at large in the fifth
Chapter. And because the consistency of Unguents, Liniments, and Sear-cloaths,
do not much differ, they are used sometimes indistinctly; for that is called a
Liniment, wherewith the parts to be helped are liniated; that an Unguent,
wherewith they are anointed; and that a Sear-cloth, which made of Wax and Oil,
is applied.

The Arabians under the name of Unguents, often comprehend Searcloaths and
Plasters, and many thick Oils; and the ancient Greeks all well smelled
Ointments; so Dioscorides, ( lib. 1.) calls many sweet Oils, Unguents; and
Hippocrates, ( lib. 1. de medic.) affirms, that Physicians should not only get
fame and glory of the Vulgar by the good constitutions of their bodies, and
decent Ornaments, but by sweet Unguents, that is, by aromatical and suaveolent
things.

Yet for clearer explications sake they are distinguished from one another: and
an Unguent properly is an Oily Medicament, Unguentum quid.
of a middle consistency betwixt Oils and Plasters, which yet does not still
remain alike: for when heat is more vehement, the unctious and fat matter melts
more, and the Unguents become more liquid and soft; and when the heat is
weaker, more solid: and therefore Unguentarians use to put less Oil in Summer,
and more in Winter to their Unguents; for cold inspissates a fluent Unguent, as
Oil it self; which Galen observes, ( cap. 1. lib. 8. comp. med. gener.) in the
composition of his stomachical Sear-cloth.

Now that proportion of Oil must be observed in the confection of Unguents,
that to one ounce of Oil be mixed one dram of Powder, Olei proportio in
unguentorum confectione.
and two drams of Wax; or as Galen says, ( cap. 2. lib. 4. comp. med. gener.)
that four times as much Oil as Wax be put in the confection of Unguents, and
eight times as much Oil as Powder, that is, to every ounce of Oil must be put a
dram of Powder, the matter whereof is educed out of dry Herbs, Metals, and
Earth, which is mixed with a cold Cerate, and stirred with a Spatula, till all
lumps be levigated.

When Unguents receive dry juices, we must pulverate and dissolve them; when
liquid and fluent, we must mix them with the rest of the matter, and by coction
absume them.

Such as may, should be pulverated very small, as Roots, Wood, Rosines, and
sometimes Gums, when dryer. Such as may not, should be beaten with a hot pestel
till they be mollified, or else dissolved in Vinegar, or some fit liquor.

Such as are more humid, as Turpontine, should be instilled; humid Herbs also,
and Animals, or parts thereof that are scarce pulverable, should be perfectly
cocted in wine or such liquor, till they be tabefied, and their humidity almost
absumed: then must materials be mixed in the strained liquor, according to the
aforesaid proportion, that the Unguent may be of a legitimate consistency;
wherein Oil and Wax do not only afford form, and a great part of the matter to
the Unguent, but conjoyn the efficacies of the other mixtures, and preserve
them longer.

Now Unguents are made one while by the fire, Vnguentum crudum.
as all such as admit Wax; another while only by long subaction, as such that
receive no Wax, as the crude Unguent, or the Unguent of Lithargy, which is made
of Oil, Vinegar, and Lithargy, coacted by the continual percussion of a pestel.

There are also differences of Unguents taken from their color, Vnguentarum
varietates.
as green, white, yellow, and orange color; from their effects, as resumptive,
analeptical, cleansing; from their first qualities, whence some are said to be
hot, as the Unguentum Apostolorum, Aegyptiacum, Martiatum, Enula campane;
others cold, as Unguentum Natritum; others dry, as Diapompholios, and desicca
Rubruni; others moystning, as the Unguent of Roses.

But white Wax is more expetible to the confection of cold, and yellow to the
confection of hot Unguents. But Apothecaries indistinctly take one while white,
another while yellow, as the matter of either will afford more commodity.

Unguents are reposed in tin boxes, Quibus vasis unguenta reponenda.
and sometimes in earthen pots well glazed, and they will keep a whole year,
sometimes two or three.

CHAP. III. Of Medicaments of Wax, or Ceratum.
CErata are often designed by Unguents, Ceronea by Plasters: by Unguents,
because softer; by Plasters, because harder: Both so called, because they
admit of Wax, as many Plasters, which are therefore indistinctly called
Ceroneous Plasters, of them that apply Catagmatical Plasters to all diseases,
bought in Unguentarians Shops: so that Ceroneous Salves are so usual amongst
the Vulgar, that they call all Salves Ceroneous. A certain man in Lutetia calls
a certain Plaster Ceroneous, which he applied to all pains and diseases.

But Ceratum, of which we now speak, Ceratum quid.
is a Medicament of a middle consistency betwixt an Unguent and a Plaster; not
so solid as a Plaster, nor so soft as an Unguent. But every one augments or
diminishes the weight of Oil, and makes this Ceratum either more liquid, or
more solid than an Unguent, as he thinks fit. And indeed if it were prepared
after one and the same manner, it would not be preserved so long safely; Olei
quantitas in Cerato non semper cadem.
for though any liquid thing may be easily concrete with cold and frosty
weather, and a solid Unguent soon melted in hot weather, yet we mix more Oil
and less Wax in Winter, and more Wax and less Oil in Summer in Ceratum.

But when the constitution of the air is temperate, and does not much exceed
the first qualities, the fourth part of a pound of Wax, or not much more or
less, should be put to one pound of Oil, that the Ceratum may not melt, or be
thickened by the change of weather. Yet it is seldom kept long in Apothecaries
Shops, because it may at any time, and soon be made of Oil and Wax, whence it
is called Ceratum, or more properly Cereole; for such as besides Oil and Wax
admit other ingredients, is not so properly called Ceratum, Santalinum, and
stomachical Ceratum: and others which may presently be made, as the matter
requires, of Plasters melted with Oil, when the part affected cannot endure
the hardness of a Salve or Plaster.

Thus is a certain Ceratum called Acopa, applied to the weary nerves and
muscles of those that are weak.

Thus may a Ceratum spread on leather, cut according to the proportion of the
place affected, be applied to the region of the spleen, ventricle, liver, womb,
and to broken bones.

That which is applied to the spleen must be long, Ceratorum efformatio quoad
rationem partis affectae.
and formed like a Neats tongue to the ventricle in form of a buckler; and thus
it must be proportioned and formed to other parts, according to their form and
figure.

In the confection of Cereole, the Wax is cut small, Cerclaei conficiendi modus.
and cast into the Oil, and then melted on a slow fire; after liquation it is
taken off, and forthwith mixed with a Spatula till it be compact; then a little
cold water poured on, it is stirred again, and washed by this percussion; for
the Ceratum thus compacted by the affusion of so much water as it can drink up;
and thus accurately madefied, it is in Galens opinion, ( cap. 6. lib. 1. de
simpl. med.) made more refrigerative, and is good for all hot sores, especially
if it be removed as soon as it is heated.

Seeing fatness, marrow, and such like liquid things, are added to the Ceratum,
improperly so called, they must be mixed with it while cold, as also the
powders, the proportion whereof to Oil is the same with that in Unguents.

They may be reposed in tin or clay vessels: but it is better to have them new,
seeing they may soon be made at any time.

CHAP. IV. Of Plasters.
THose topical Medicaments which are coacted into a more solid lump, were
called by the Arabians Cerota, and by the ancient Greeks Emplasta, ( Gal. cap.
12. lib. 1. comp. medic. gen.) which the later sort for euphonies sake call,
Emplastra, the letter (r) being added; which being detracted, their quality
sounds not emplastrical, but emplastical, or emphractical, as it were filling
up or insartiating. For an Emplaster super-induced upon a part, seems to shut
the pores and passages thereof, by the viscidity of its substance, and retain
the halituous spirits, and by constraining the heat of the part sometimes to
move suppuration; for its glewish substance does not insinuate into it self,
but remaining without, does tenaciously adhere to the passages of the body. Yet
are not its qualities idle, but being moved and helped by the heat of the part,
they produce several effects, ( c. 9. l. 5. de simpl. med.) if its faculty be
to conglutinate, it helps the coagulation of wounds in the lips; if it be
catagmatical, it helps the ferrumination of broken bones; if it be sarcotical,
Sarcosis non tam medicamentorum quam naturae est opus.
herein it helps Nature, that it generates flesh more easily; which is not so
much the effect of Medicaments, as of Nature.

And as the composition of Emplaisters is various and manifold, so also is
their quality, for they are compounded almost of all Medicaments; wherefore all
are not emphractical, or such as fill the pores with their lentor, but some are
ecphractical, as it were purging fractures; others episastical, or extracting,
and diaphoretical; others chyptical, which take away the filth of the skin, and
ulcers; and some that are useful for many affections, as many other
Medicaments, called polychrestical, which consist of contrary Medicaments. (
Gal. initio l. 5. comp. med. gener.)

An emplastical Medicament should want all mordacity, for it can scarce stick
to the pores, if any sharp or biting quality be in it, as Galen, ( cap. 9. lib.
5. comp. medic. gener.) but it may be easily discerned by melting some part of
it, or by attracting some humor from above; an Emplastick therefore should be
of a terrene substance, and viscous.

There are two main scopes in compounded Emplaisters to be minded, that a solid
and gross consistency, and faculty, odor and color are often desired; which
rather please the fancy of the diseased, than conduce any thing in effect to
the nature of the Medicament.

Wax, and common Oil, Lithargy, and sometimes Rosines, do afford a fit
consistency and matter, but small or no virtue. All things almost which are
superadded, as Minerals, Metals, Roots, Wood, Flowers, and Seeds, give a body
and faculty to the Plaster; which if they be dry, they must be pulverated and
mixed with the Plaster removed from the fire; if any of them be not friable,
they are dissolved in some liquor, which is absumed by coction, before they be
mixed with the Plaster; or else it is mixed with the Plaster, and dissipated
by coction afterward.

Green herbs, which cannot be pulverated, are either cocted in their own juice
strained and mixed, or others are cocted in the juice of these brayed and
strained; which juice being absumed, the strength thereof being left, if any
remains that will not endure long coction, they may be put in and cocted, and
then mixed with the Plaster.

But those Emplaisters must be long boiled which receive juice, water, vinegar,
wine, or some decoction; because whereas the Emplaister should be all viscid
and thick, that it might stick to the place to which it is applied, humidity,
which is often mixed with it, being contrary to viscidity, must be resolved by
heat, if its quality must needs be retained in the Emplaster; for such as are
cocted in juices keep their faculties, though the juices themselves be
dissipated by exhalation. Humidity also, which is required in confecting
Plasters, causes that the virtues of the rest of the ingredients be surer
ingrafted, and that they be carried to parts further distant. Oil indeed is
added to the materials of Emplaisters, but not as to constitute their body, but
that the Wax might be melted with it, and that it might obtund the sharp and
austere ingredients, and that the Emplaisters may obtain a more pleasant and
leniating faculty.

Simple old Oil, and Oil made by infusion, as also any compound Oil, may be put
into the Emplaister, that besides its matter, it may also afford some virtue
thereunto.

Wax, as also some Rosines, allow only matter to Emplaisters, no power to act.
Yet such Emplasters as have other matter analogical to them, as Frankincense,
and The dew of Lada.
Labdanum, or such like Medicaments, admit of no Wax nor Rosines in their
composition.

But if Wax ingrede the Emplaister, let it be melted in Oil; if Lithargy, let
that also be boiled in Oil; and if Juices, Liquors, or other such like must be
mixed with it, let them also be warmed with these, till the watery and humid
portion be resolved: then let Rosines and Fats be induced, as also Gums,
whereof some are mixed simply with it, others after maceration in Wine, Oil, or
Vinegar, and percolation. When the Plaster is thoroughly boiled, and taken from
the fire, let Turpentine be mixed therewith, that it may not feel any force of
fire. Last of all, when all these are confounded, and cocted to a legitimate
consistency, and refrigerated, let the Powders be by little and little
scattered above all, and diligently agitated and moved with a Spatula, till all
be compact into a mass, neither too soft nor too hard, but viscid, glewish, and
adherent: yet not so as to inquinate the part to which it adheres, nor to be
hardly divelled from the place whereunto it is applied.

And that the form of it may exist in a due consistency, the quantity of Oil
must be diminished: when Fats, Marrows, and Turpentine are admitted in its
confection, and augmented, when dry Gums, friable Juices, Rosines, and dry Wood
or Minerals, that may be pulverated, are mixed therewith.

In dry Ingredients the Oil must be thus proportioned; Olci proportio in
emplastrorum confectura
to every ounce of Powder must be allowed three ounces of Oil: to Wax the
fourth part of as much Oil as the Wax is in quantity will serve; so that to a
pound of Wax we put a quarter of a pound of Oil.

But because this quantity in the tempering of most Emplaisters may be better
designed by ones judgment, than defined by certain rules, they now adays put
to a definite quantity of Oil and Powders as much Wax as will suffice, that
these liquid, dry, and viscid ingredients, being by malaxation coagulated, a
fit, viscous and glewish mass of Emplaisters may be induced. Out of which mass
are formed rowls of Plasters of half an ounce, or a whole ounce weight, which
being involved in oiled papers, are reposed in the Apothecaries Shop for future
uses.

Thus also are Emplaisters, properly so called, made, which are prepared
without Fire and Wax, whose materials malaxated in Honey, or some viscid
matter, are coagulated into the consistency of an Emplaister, as Emplastra de
crusta panis, and de baccis lauri, or other such common Emplaisters, which are
a medium betwixt Plasters and Cataplasms.

That Ceratum, confected of an equal weight of Wax and Honey, is also referred
to Emplaisters, as also Cerotum or Ceronea, of which before.

CHAP. V. Of Sparadraps.
THere is to be sold in many Shops a Cloth plaistered on both sides, which the
later Writers call a Sparadrap, Tela Galterii.
sometimes also Galterius his Cloth, peradventure because he was the Inventor,
or rather Infector thereof. Which is thus made; a certain Cloth somewhat bare
with wearing, is often dipped and inculcated in a fit Emplaister already made
up, but now melted till it be all infected, inquinated, and on every side
incrusted; which is then extracted and exposed to the air, that by
refrigeration it may become obdurate, and so be preserved till future exigency.

Now hereof are many kinds, the differences whereof arise not from the Cloth,
but the Emplaisters wherein it is dipped; for some are catagmatical, which are
used in solidating and roborating broken bones, which are made of astringing
and roborating Emplasticks: as,

. Oil of Quinces and Roses, and Rams suet, ana. iiij. of Frankincense, Mastick,
Pitch, Bole armeniack, Wheat-flowr, ana. ij. of white Wax, q. s. that an
Emplaister may be made, wherein when melted, the Cloth may be dipped.

Others have an exsiccating and epuloptical faculty, which are applied to
induce skars, as this here described.

. Oil of Roses, lb. j. of yellow Wax, lb. ss. of Venetian Ceruse, and Thutian,
ana. ij. of Lithargy of Gold,. iij. let hereof an Emplaister be made, and with
a Cloth somewhat worn with age, a Sparadrap.

Joannes Vigonius describes many other forms in his Work of Chirurgy, which I
neither will nor ought here to transcribe, seeing any one for any purpose may
take any Emplaister with a small labor, and inculcate a Linen Cloth therein:
for whosoever knows how to prescribe and make Emplaisters, he may easily make
Sparadraps thereof, by inquinating a Cloth therein liquefied.

OF PHARMACEUTICAL INSTITUTIONS. The fourth Book. Of Laws to be observed in
compounding Medicaments.
CHAP. I. Who first compounded Medicaments, and the reason of composition.
SEeing every Disease is the way to Death, all presidy must be used for its
cure or expulsion, ere it be too far increased; and such sedulity must be used
in finding and selecting Medicaments, that we may have always in readiness
such as preternaturally conduce to the expugning of several affections, and as
it were a Wood of the more excellent Medicaments.

Yet may not these Medicaments, whether simple or compound, be exhibited till
they be changed by Art, and after much preparation, as we have before
demonstrated; wherein several Simples should not only be washed, dried,
beaten, or infused, macerated, expressed, and made fit for commixtion, but they
must be united with such care and proportion, that some new mixture may arise
from their complexion in this concourse, their several virtues, if not
integrally, at least preserved so, as they may perspicuously be seen while the
commixtion is new, and not perfectly fermented, ( cap. 2. lib. 1. comp. med.
gener.)

But because Medicaments exhibited alone sometimes hurt, and mixed with others,
admirably advantage, when the qualities of any Medicament is proved, but the
one may hereby be improved; for certain it is, that even simple Medicaments
have several and different qualities; and the other which is noxious, either
obtunded or ejected, and so the best will be more effectual. And though some
Simples hurt not, yet because they do not sufficiently help, they are not used
without commixtion with others, as an Emplastical Medicament, of which,
according to Galen, ( cap. 13. lib. de There. ad Pis.) none is simple; and
therefore the first and best Authors of Emplaisters have excogitated how to
melt and make some of Oil.

Now composition of Medicaments is necessary, Quis primus medicamentorum
compositionem tradidit.
for many reasons showed in our former Book, which was first of all approved
and defended by Mautias Herophilaeus, afterward by Cappadox, Heras, Musa,
Asclepiades, and Andromachus, ( cap. 2. lib. 2. comp. med. gen.) but chiefly by
Galen, ( cap. 2. lib. 1. comp. med. genesis Epilogismo) who having showed the
reason of compounding Medicaments, teaches the legitimate proportion of the
Compounds, and the manner of their exhibition: Not like those Empiricks, who
refer all Medicaments to imaginations, chance, or fortune, except some few,
which (as it is apparent by the common suffrage of all) are bettered by
composition, all consisting of one and the same faculty; of which also some are
fitted by nature to cure; which tenent Galen, ( cap. 3. lib. 6. comp. med.
loc.) denies, Sarcoticum optimum ex facultatibus oppositis.
and proves by the example of the best Sarcotick, confected of Ceratum, and a
twelfth part of Verdigrease; that Medicaments of two or more opposite qualities
or faculties, may be best of all compounded; for Ceratum produces corruption,
Aerugo erodes ulcerous flesh: yet the Medicament compounded of these is
excellent, both for generating flesh, and filling the hollow ulcer. Thus we mix
hot with cold, weakening with roborating, and cordial Medicaments with Poisons,
compounding our best Medicaments of Simples endued with contrary or different
qualities.

Galen ( cap. 29. lib 9. de facult. med.) Historia Galeno nota.
tells us of one of that number, who hold that Medicaments should be compounded
according to experience only, (no reference had to reason) to whom a gouty
fellow by chance came while he was boasting of his podagrical Medicament; who
being so moderately pained before this Empirick applied his salve to his foot,
that he could go, but was with pain after one sleepless night so handled, that
he was so far now from going, as before, that he could not endure to be carried.

The event therefore of fortuitous Compositions is always fortuitous, and often
unfortunate, as Galen shows at large, besides the abovementioned story,
wherewith he derides the vanity and slothfulness of the Pseudomedick; who also
judges it requisite that a Physician should not only know the causes of
Compounds, but the way and manner of their composition; and also that he should
compound the best Medicaments for every Disease while it is time, lest that
punishment be inflicted upon him which was upon two Physicians well known to
Galen, ( cap. 1. lib. 2. comp. medic. gen.) the one whereof was starved with
famine, the other not suffered to perform his function; and all for the loss of
some forms of Compounds.

CHAP. II. Of the basis of Medicaments, and their collocation in Forms or
Receipts.
IN prescribing a Medicament, we should first appoint a basis, that is, some
simple Medicament, as the chief in that composition, and most fit for depelling
the disease, upon which the rest may depend. As when we undertake to oppugn any
disease, if it be simple, accompanied with no ill symptom, we choose only a
simple Medicament of an equal virtue, and just auxiliary: but if no Simple be
apt for it, then we must compound one Medicament of many, the basis whereof
must be averse to the disease; and add others, which may corroborate the
member affected, or carry the quality of the Medicament to the parts more
distant. Others also we must adjoin to make it acceptable and grateful to the
palate, or to felicitate and facilitate the work.

Now the basis is for the most part more prepollent in quality that in
quantity, as in aromatical and purgative Confections; and by how much the
disease to be depelled is more grievous, by so much must the basis be more
potent in its virtue. Muitae bases aliquando in uno medicamento.
Often also are many basis confusedly digested into some Compound, for the
expugning of some prave affection; which conspiring with their mutual help,
make up one perfect basis; as when we confound many anodynous Medicaments to
ease some vehement dolor.

Therefore in compounding Medicaments, a basis must be first sought adequate to
the affection, and the part affected, yet it must not always take the first
place in composition: for all the ingredients in a Composition must not be
promiscuously and inordinately confounded together, but one after another. And
when this order is neglected, the Medicament often times neither acquires its
just virtue, nor its apt form; for if those receive little which require much
and long coction, and those much which require little, their virtue cannot be
integrally procured.

A due order likewise is accurately to be observed in describing forms of
Medicaments or Receipts, Ordo servandus in describendis formulis medicamentorum.
lest that be last described in the Receipt, which should have been first. Into
which error those happen who are ignorant of the substance, qualities, and
preparation of Medicaments; as also sometimes young Doctors, who not
sufficiently experienced by long use, describe confusedly what ever comes into
their minds, whether they know their qualities, or not.

But they offend worse, who boil those Medicaments long, whose virtues are
impaired by fire; who give those Medicaments in drink, which because of their
eminent bitterness should be made into Pills, and covered over; who administer
those things raw, which should be cocted, those whole, which should be
pulverated, and those dissolved without expression, which should only be
infused.

Those who through negligence omit these things, may scarcely eschew the
censure of the more ancient Apothecaries, who being taught by skillful
Physicians, have not only found out the manner of compounding Medicaments, but
many of them have attained the knowledge of the order wherein Simples should be
severally collocated.

Let this then be the first rule to be observed in describing Medicaments, that
those which require a longer preparation, Prima Lex medicamenti describendi.
as diuturnal coction, or laborious triture, be first described; such as be
roots and wood that is not odoriferous; those last which require least, as
flowers, and aromatical simples; those in the middle, which require moderate
labor and preparation, as herbs, fruits, and seeds. Whoever do otherwise,
mixing and concocting in the same instant, wood, roots, leaves and flowers
promiscuously and confusedly, either lose the dissipable qualiy of the later
sort, or acquire not the strength of the former; and by this improvident manner
of mixture make up a Medicament, neither endued with the genuine virtue of the
Simples, nor answerable to the Physicians intent.

Let the second Law observable in Receipts be this; Secunda Lex.
That if brevity of time be urgent, and some things are to be cocted or
infused, and others to be pulverated, that you begin with those that require
coction or maceration, that while these are in preparing, others may be
levigated and brayed, and so in the same time their several preparations may be
accomplished.

The third observation is, Tertia Lex.
That those which exceed in quantity or quality, be first described; yet so,
that the manner of preparation and mixtion be not obverted thereby.

The fourth observation, which holds good almost continually, is, Quarta.
That those must be described in the last place of the Receipt, which are as
the matter of the Medicament, as Honey in great Confections, Sugar in solid
Electuaries, Oil or Wax in many Unguents.

If this order be kept, it will lead the more recent Apothecaries into a
readier and better way of preparing and mixing Medicaments, and their virtue
will hereby remain more potent and firm; which if they be not rightly ordered
by the rules of Art, do wax dull, and perish.

CHAP. III. Of the forms and end of Medicaments.
AS those that are sound in body do not need, ( Aphor. 37. lib. 2. Hippoc.) so
neither do they desire Medicines. And those who had need of Medicaments, either
to prevent an imminent, or depell a present disease, either never call the
Physician till the malady of the disease be at the height, or utterly refuse
Physic; or they will have it prepared with such art and mixture, as in odor,
color, and sapour, it may please the nose, eyes, and palate. But Galen, ( lib.
2. de praenot.) says, that a Cook amongst these children and fools is
preferred before a Physician; and he is more commended and allauded, because he
daily indulges their genius with unaccustomed varieties and dainties.

But since every one is punished by that by which he offended, and gluttony and
surfeiting is the nurse almost of all diseases, it is as it were by divine
ordination constituted, that a Medicament assumed by the mouth, should leave in
the mouth the ultion of the fault therein committed. For it is no wonder that
almost all Medicaments, especially purgative, should so much displease our
taste and smell, by their quality averse to our nature, since they are
instituted, not as Aliments to be changed, but to change; and either to correct
the noxious quality of the humors, or to extrude it.

Such Medicaments as are insipid and inodorous, and being exhibited in a small
quantity, do variously wrest and exagitate the body, and the humors, are not
so good as those, which though ungrateful, and assumed in a larger measure, do
easily and with delight educe the vicious humors from the parts affected.

Now the forms of Medicaments do not only facilitate their assumpsion, Forma
medicamentorum quid praestat.
(for some only like liquid, others solid Medicines) but produce diverse
effects, as they are in form diverse; for an inciding or extenuating Medicament
is better accommodated to its function by a liquid form, as also by a solid
form to astriction.

Now I call not that same, which gives the essence, the thing; nor yet that
faculty, by which it operates, the form, but the very consistency of the
compound Medicament, whether it be solid, liquid, or in a mean. Besides which
consistency, another figure is often put upon dry Medicaments by the
industrious hand of the Apothecary, or imprinted by some sigil; as when the
matter is formed into Pills or Trochisks, or planed into Tessels; and that
either equilaterally cubal, or drawn out into an unequal angle.

But this external impressed form or sigillation is of little moment, as
nothing conducing either to promote or felicitate the effect of the Medicament,
as some superstitious fellows have imagined, that I may omit what some
Alchymists dream of, the external signature of some Plants, whereby they
profess to accommodate the virtues of those Plants to the parts affected, with
which their Medicaments by certain marks and external forms agree. But the form
of a Medicament, whereby it is dense, rare, or liquid, is useful for many
purposes, for the same Medicament will sometimes provoke urine, sometimes
stools, according to the manner of its composition. Galen, cap. 13. lib. 4. de
sanit. tuend.

Such Medicaments as are levigated to powder, Crassities aut tenuitas pulverum
quid efficiat.
are quickly carried to the reins and bladder; such as are grosser, subsist
longer in the intestines, and give stools. If any would be freed from
obstructions, and move monthly flowers, they can neither successfully exhibit
solid Medicaments, nor yet liquid ones, if they would educe the noxious humor
from the brain, or parts more dissi^e.

And as grosser Medicaments are requisite to roborate some parts, and depell
some affections, and liquid to others: so some require Medicaments of a middle
consistency, as amongst internal Medicaments, Electuaries, and some Antidotes
amongst external Unguents, mucaginous Salves, and Pultises.

We have abundantly before declared what form is fit for several Medicaments,
we shall hereafter speak in special of those which should be variously formed,
as the condition of the place requires, to which they are fitted; as when a
scutum or signature of a Buckler is fitted for the region of the ventricle, of
a stomachical Emplaister, a Pessary for the secrets, a Suppository for the
fundament, a Tent for a wound.

Some upon no grounds do not only desire a set form, Nimis sumptuosa
medicamentorum confectura plerunque vana.
but also a sumptuous confecture of Medicaments, otherwise rejecting them as
vile and useless; as a certain rich man, who desired and received of Galen (
cap. 10. lib. 3. comp. medic. gener.) a Form or Receipt of a cure for a
malignulcer in his servant; who seeing all the Ingredients of a vile price
whereon the Medicament consisted, bid Galen keep that for Beggars, and give him
a costly Medicament.

So many little regard excellent Medicaments, if they know them, but make much
of vile ones, if they know them not, admiring them as some celestial remedy.
Artis arcana non detegenda.
They therefore act to the indignity of Medicaments, who detect the secrets of
so Divine an Art; and that they may please the people, describe their Receipts
in the vulgar idiome.

For it is better to make a Medicament gratis, and give it to the poor, than
prescribe them any thing of small price, or teach and show the composition
thereof; which they having once with success tried upon themselves, they will
experience on others to their undoing; for many Medicaments, especially
purgative, are both good and evil, and heals or kills accordingly, as they are
well or ill used.

Now the end of composition of Medicaments is the cause for which such
composition must be undertaken; Finis compositionis.
or that same purpose to which all things necessary in composition are
referred, that the Medicaments compounded by Art may be of use, either to
preserve or roborate health, or to profligate difeases.

CHAP. IV. Of the Weights of Medicaments, and their marks.
EVery Nation and Country had, and have still their proper Weights and
Measures; the Constinopolitan Merchants two pounds Weights, twenty six ounces;
the Mediolanians 24. the Parisiensians 16. the Lugdunians 15. the Hispanians
14. the Genevians, and many more 12. the Goldsmiths only 8. commonly called
Markum.

The ancient Greeks, Arabians, and Romans also, had not only their proper
Idioms and Characters, but Weights also; and unless the Supreme Authority
forbad them, they would buy with the greatest, and fell with the least Weights,
there being no certain Standard.

But because in Medicine one cannot err twice; and errors in prescribing
Weights and Measures are often very perilous, all Medicks should have common
and definite Weights, that there might be a mutual consent in their operations.

The Medicks pound always weighs 12. ounces, which is thus described, lib. j.
their ounce eight drams, whose note is this,. j. their dram three scruples,
thus marked,. j. so that in one ounce they have as many scruples as there be
letters in the Greek Alphabet, to wit, 24. according to the Poet Faunus: Uncia
fit dragmis bis quatuor, unde putandum,
Grammata dicta, quod haec viginti quatuor in se.
Uncia habet, tot enim formis vox Graeca notatur,
Horis quot mundus peragit, noctemque, diemque.


By which words, Scruples seem to be Vicegerents of Letters, Drams of
Syllables, Ounces of Words, Pounds of Speeches, or at least Sentences. But
there are less Weights than Scruples, for a Grain or Minute is the least of
Weights, of which is made an Obolus, or half Scruple, thus noted,. ss. and a
Grain with two letters conjoined thus gr. or sometimes with one letter thus, g.

When we would describe a pound and a half, or an ounce and a half, we mark the
greater number thus, lib. j. ss. the lesser thus,. j. ss.

A grain is the most small, indivisible and minute of weights, Granum.
and therefore called a mite, by the Greeks (...).

Chalcus, or aereolum weighs two mites or grains.

Siliqua or Ceration in Arabic Kirat, two chalci, or 4. grains.

A Semiobulus weighs 3. aereola. i. e. one siliqua and a half, one obolus
weighs 3. siliqua, or six Chalci; or 12. grains.

A scruple weighs 2. obuli, or 12. chalci, or 24. grains.

A denarius is the eighth part of a Romans ounce, and weighs 3. scruples, or
six obuli, or seventy two grains.

A dram is the eighth part of a Greek ounce, lighter than a denarius, weighing
only 60. grains, that is, 3 common scruples, every of which should weigh 20.
grains.

A denarius was accounted formerly for ten pound weight, whence Sylvius says
it had its name; now it amounts only to the 84. part of a pound, as a dram to
the 96. I mean of a Medick pound, which weighs 12. ounces.

Many for a denarius puts a dram, not much lighter, and for a dram a denarius,
according to the version of the Greek interpreter, who having no weight that
might exactly respond to the Roman denarius, put a dram for a denarius.

Sicilicus amounts to two drams, and it is the fourth part of an ounce, a
semiuncia, or half ounce contains two sicilici.

The Medicks ounce weighs 8. drams, the Merchants 8. denarii.

I find a dram called sometimes by the ancients Hexagion, the Merchants
commonly call it grossum.

Bes contains 8. ounces, and has as much as the Medicks mina, which contains
16. ounces, and amounts to the Merchants pound. Ex Dioscor. and Gal.

But the Medicks (...), i. e. pound is less, containing only twelve ounces.

We may contract them all thus, that so they may be better accommodated to
memory.

A pound, often called pondo, or As, weighs twelve ounces, deunx eleven, dextans,
ten: dodrans, nine: bes or octunx, eight: septunx, seven: semis, six: or the
half part of any weight, quincunx, five: quadrans or qurtarium four: triens,
three.

An ounce contains four sicilici, sicilicus two drams, a dram, three scruples,
a scruple, two obuli, an obulus, two filiqua and a half, siliqua, two Chalci;
Chalcus two grains.

I would not in silence have passed over names or weights familiar to the
Arabians, but that I found so many, as made them seem uncertain, who call an
ounce adar, alsatil, sacros and assathis, Nomina ponderum Arabica.
a dram sometimes alchi, sometimes nabach, and sometimes darchamet, a scruple
also guanthus, often gormin, and sometimes kermec and arm, an obulus Seminen,
Seminet, Onolos, Onolosat, Ologinat, indiscriminately, as half a one Danich,
the third part Kirat: but we will leave them to their words, and use our own.

When herbs must be measured by Maniples Medicks note it with this letter M.
when flowers by Pugills, with this letter P. now a Maniple with the Medicks, is
as much as can be contained in a hand; a pugill, as much as may be holden
betwixt three fingers.

When an equal weight of measure or two or more Medicaments are prescribed
together, Ana quid signet.
they add this word Ana, which shows that an equal portion of every
Medicament must be assumed.

Amongst other notes of weights, or rather definite quantityes in prescribing
receipts, this letter. N. is placed to denote that some number should be
assumed, as of many fruits which cannot by weight or measure be better
described, but how great a number, the note of weight thereunto annexed must
show, as for example of Almonds, Plums, or the like, two, three, four, five, or
six, more or less as the Medick sees cause, should be prescribed, figures
should be added to indicate their number, whereunto according to Rondeletius,
the notes of the ancient Romans numbers are more accommodate, which are thus
described I. II. III. IIII. V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. X. XI. XII. than the other
characters called Ciphers, and thus described. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10.
Least some ignorant ty^o for two or three drams, thus designed. 2.. 3. read
thirty two, or thirty three drams.

CHAP. V. Of Physicians Measures.
NOt without reason do the holy Scriptures attest, that God created all things
with weight, number, and measure; for number being an act of reason, therefore
Plato asserted man to be the wisest animal, because he could number; And God
commanded all this to be trutinated by just weight and measure Levit. 19. and
Deuteronomy. 25.

By measures I mean certain hollow instruments like boxes thereunto accomodated
by certain receptive and mensurative shapes, wherein Apothecaries or Merchants
may measure simple or compound, dry or liquid Medicaments.

But they are made cheifely to measure liquors, as oil, vinegar, decoctions or
the like, and they are so fitted by industry, as to respond to weights, for
some will contain one ounce, some two, some three, some one pound, others five,
others ten, others more and less.

The least measure will contain. Cochlearium.
j. and. ss. of wine of a mean consistency, and is called cochlearium.

Another is called Cheme, Ligula.
twice as capacious as the former, which contains of wine. ij. and. j.

A third is called Ligula, Mistrum.
or mystrum, and contains of Wine. ij. ss. or. iij.

Concha contains two mystras, or twice as much as Cheme, Concha.
that is. v.

Cyathus contains twice as much as Concha, that is. x, or. j. ss. Cyathus.
Acetabulum.


Acetabulum, which the Greeks call Oxybaphum contains half as much again as a
Cyathus, that is. ij. and. ij. or. ij. ss. at the most.

Quartarius holds twice as much as Acetabulum, that is. iiij. ss. or little
more.

Hemina or Hemisextarius holds twice as much as Quartarius, Hemina.
that is. ix.

Sextarius holds twice as much as a hemina, that is lb. j. ss.

Choenix lb. ij and. iij. Choenix.


Chus or Congius six sextaries that is lb. ix.

Urna four Congli, that is lb. XL. Urna.


Amphora two Urns, that is lb. LXXX. Amphora.


Metretes, in Greek Geramium, in Latin Cadus, an amphora and a half. Metretes.


Culeus, twenty Amphorae or forty Urns. Culeus.


Thus we proceed from the least of measures of liquids to the greatest by
degrees, as from grains, to the greatest of weights in dry things, and as the
greater number contains the lesser, so does the greatest measure or weight the
lesser.

Some measures therefore are great, some small, some mean, and amongst those
some are destined to measure liquids, others solids, others both.

Culeus, Amphora, Urna, Congius, and Quartarius serve to measure liq^ids,
modius and semimodius solids, sextarius, hemina, acetabulum, cyathus, both.

CHAP. VI. Of the quantity of Medicaments to be exhibited.
IT is not only worthy our inquisition in compounding Medicaments to enquire
after the quality of simples only, but also to know in what quantity each
simple should be mixed, and what quantity of a compound should be exhibited.
For as too little brings small emolument or profit, so too much brings more
harm: for a Lettice may kill as well as Hemlock; and wine kills more than
Woolfebane.

Now if superabundance of Aliment be as noxious as poison, Alimentorum nimia
quantitas periculosa.
it is the greatest perfection of the Art and Artificer to describe the just
quantity of Medicaments, and to define what and how much is convenient for
every sex, age, nature, and time: For Turpethum, colocynthis and Hellebore
purge strongly; Polypody, Tamarinds, and the broth of an old Cock weakly:
Cassia, Senny, Rhabarbe, moderately: old and melanchollick men must be purged
hardly in Autumn, boys and moist men must be purged easily in Winter, and
Spring; and choleric men easily in Summer, such as are of a middle nature,
must be moderately purged.

And since mutations of ages and seasons change the condition of the humors,
Idem medicamentum non eadem semper praestat.
it happens that one and the same Medicament, taken in the same quantity, has
not always the same effect and operation, for when the humors swell, and are
turbulent, then nature, with the help of a gentle Medicament, will work out
the excretion of the troublesome matter, excluding it either by stool or
vomit. Whereas on the contrary, if the matter by its lentour be more
tenaciously fixed, and no way provokes nature by its quality to its exclusion;
the strongest Medicament will not be of power to relaxe the belly, being only
able to move, not to remove these redundant humors.

This diversity of humors often deceives the non-cautious, who having by
experience found, that Cassia should be prescribed and exhibited by ounces, and
not by grains, Scammony by grains and not by ounces, and Rhabarb by drams;
think they have prescribed a convenient dosis according to the efficacy of each
Medicaments acting, when yet they often see that the Medicament either not at
all, or too impensely and strongly moves the belly: For when nature cooperates,
and the superfluous humor swells, a few grains of Rhabarb will relaxe, yea,
the very odor alone of some catharticke, will sufficiently exagitate the
ventricle.

Wherefore the Physician does wisely, who being called by some patient never
before seen of him, asks him whether his body needs a weak and gentle, or
valid and strong purge, and whether he be most commonly laxative, or
restringed, that he may the better accomodate his purgative Medicament; neither
too much, nor too little to exagitate his ventricle, nor yet to exclude more in
quantity or quality than he should. Yet if the body wholly abound with ill
humors, he may not at once, but by little and little, not on one day, but many
remove them, for nature cannot bear great evacuations of any humors
whatsoever, but delights in graduall actions, wherein is no violence.

CHAP. VII. A just quantity of Medicaments can scarce be defined, yet a little
in excess or defect, is not perilous.
THE Medicinary Art is indeed conjecturall, yet much helped by experience,
augmented by reason, and confirmed by reason, and confirmed by the authority of
Doctors, who trying effects by the indagation of causes, and being more
skillful and prudent by long observance have left Theorems to posterity,
grounded upon many strong and necessary reasons, whereby diseases may be known,
remedies invented, and a quantity of Medicaments described, if not just and
definite, yet so accomodate to nature and the disease, that one may triumph,
and the other be captivated: For what peril can be doubted or expected? If
where an ounce of Cassia is convenient, seven or nine drams be exhibited, if
where oue dram of Rhabarb is requisite, two or four scruples be assumed, a
small error should not cause great fear, and as all excrementitious humors
cannot always be educed by a Medicament without indangering sanity; so we
shall not need to suspect any harm by the eduction of some of them only that
are not of an offensive quality: since meat and drink are not always ingested
after the same measere, and at the same time. Nor yet ill humors always bridge
diseases with them. Many have often eaten Hemlock instead of Persly in Pottage,
which the maid has mistaken, because of their convenience in external form,
those also who love Froggs eat Toad stools often without harm.

Yet we must with all judgment and artificial conjecture, endeavor to make
the quantity of the Medicament, respond to the strength of the nature, and the
burden to be educed, which if it be copious, and a proportionate Medicament,
cannot with safety be exhibited at once, it is better to wash it away in
several days than at once, both deject strength and humors.

Its sad to reiterate purgative Medicaments, Suppurgati^ ^imenda.
where one will accomplish the design, or to minister a violent one where a
gentle one would sufficiently exonerate. For suppurgation is dangerous, which
by too much opening the veins sometimes excites the dysentary, evacuates blood,
and prostrates the integrity of natures strength to danger. Its better
therefore to relinquish some of the superfluous humors, than by immoderate
vacuation to protrude both necessary and excrementitious ones.

And as the same quantity of the same Medicament given to the same man at
several times, may produce different effects, so as its quantity varyes it
acts variously, and one while is more proper for this, another while for that
disease: for if ( Aphor. 1. lib. 4. Hippocr.) a woman with child be advised to
purge, which she may without fear or danger do, betwixt the fourth and sixth
month of her pregn^ncy, she may confidently assume a roborating Medicament in
a small quantity, that the cause of that molestation, whereof pregnant women
complain, may be gently removed, and the foetus receive no detriment thereby.

But when the quantity of Opium, Diagredium, or such Medicaments which have
great power, in a little bigness, is to be excoginted, let it be with great
care and prudence prescribed, and pondered, that if a just quantity can scarce
be defined, the exoberance or defect may ^e very small, for whereas the least
thing is not reached by the Law, nor judged by the Praetor, yet we may cafily
offend in the least excess.

CHAP. VIII. Of such Medicaments as may without harm be taken in great
quantity, for whom they are convenient and when.
Every Medicament does more or less offend nature, as its faoulty is stronger
or weaker: by how much a catharticke is more grievous in odor or sapour, by so
much it causes more molestation; for all purges (says Galen. cap. ult. lib.
quos, quando and quibus) offend the ventricle, especially in its mouth, which,
consisting of of many nerves, is of more accurate sensation, and therefore we
either mix benevolent lenocinyes with purgatives, or select, such as are not
so ungrateful, nor so much disturb the ventricle. Which if they can be
procured, must not yet be presently exhibited, save by those for whom they are
convenient, and in such quantity, as may respond to the strength of nature, and
be easily born.

Which quantity is various, according to the various faculties of the
Medicaments, which if they be weaker, may be exhibited by so much in a greater
quantity, if stronger in a less. Now I call them purgati^es weak, which by
gentle and benign motion of the ventricle, cleanse the first region of the
body, and are measured rather by c^^^^es, than drams, as Mannae, the pulpe of
Tamarinds, the pith of Caffia (...) ^^e like: Those valid or strong, which
being small in quantity produce groat and violent effects, and which are rather
weighed by grains and soruples, than by drams, of which hereafter: all them are
accounted weak, which are measured by ounces; and they vidle^^ which are (...)
by grains; they indifferent which are measured by drams, as Rhabarb, Senny,
Aloes and the like, all which, as also all lubricating and roborating
purgatives, may be taken in greater quantity.

This also holds good in alterating Medicaments, Alterantium dosis.
which by how much they recede less from the symmetry of our body, as being
only hot or cold in the first degree, may be prescribed in greater quantity;
by how much they recede more, as hot or cold in the fourth degree, may be
exhibited in lesser quantity; it is not then without peril copiously to assume
Pepper, Bartram, Euphorbium, or Cicuta, Hedum or Water Lillies, because by the
former the intralls would be inflamed, by the later benumbed and chilled.

But since roborative Medicaments differ much in their active powers, they must
be used in different quantities, as cordial waters by ounces, conserves,
roborating the principal parts by drams, more potent Antidotes, by scruples;
Bezoar-stone, and Unicorns horn by grains.

Now such liquids as are assumed either to roborate, alter, or purge, may be
given in a greater quantity.

Furthermore not only the efficacy of the Medicament, but also the state of the
body and humors require an augmentation, Qui Medicamentis vaitdis, qui
benignis egent.
or diminution in quantity; a gentle and weak Medicament will not move a strong
and firm body, which has been either accustomed to labor, and frequent
purgation, or pestered with many obstructions; whereas the soft and slender
bodies of women and children, which are either dry or macilent, as also of
pregnant women and persons newly recovered from diseases, will not endure
strong ones.

The species also, and plenty of the humor, Frigidus and crassus humor tardius
purgatur.
varyes the quantity of the Medicament; for a viscid, gross, frigid,
Melanchollicke, pituitous and tenaciously adhering humor will hardly be
deduced, but requires a more valid and potent catharticke for its exclusion, a
thin, calid, and chollerick humor will sometimes be ejected by spontaneous
vomit, very easily by a purgative Medicament.

Furthermore, the state of the heavens, the nature of the region, and the
condition of the season of the year require a different quantity of Medicament,
for seeing the belly is obdurate in a cold season, ( Aphor. 5. lib. 3) and a
rigid Winter coartactes, and condenses the body, especially in the frigid
region or climate, the humor then tenaciously adhering, is not propelled, save
either by a strong Medicament once, or a gentle one often and in abundance
exhibited, and as the year for the most part causes diseases according to its
own constitution ( Aphor. 5. lib. 3.) so according to the species of the humor
causing the disease, and its greater or lesser progress: it is requisite, that
not only the kind, but quantity of the Medicament be changed, which must be
more copious: if by reason of the body, humor, state of the heavens, region,
or custom purgation be difficult, as on the contrary, if purgation be easy in
lesser quantity, as shall appear hereafter.

CHAP. IX. Of such as must be prescribed in small quantity.
EVery purgative Medicament has either a strong or a weak faculty, which by a
particular propriety respect the gentle or potent eduction of this rather than
another humor. Now that Medicament I call gentle or weak, ^landum medicamentum
quale.
which assumed in an indifferent quantity moves the ventricle benignely and
educes moderately, but superfluously assumed, educes superabundantly. For if an
immoderate quantity of Rhabarb or Cassia, which are of the most familiar
Medicaments to nature, be assumed, as an ounce and a half of the former, or
half a pound of the later, it will move either stool or vomit, or both, with a
great and immoderate turbation of the ventricle, and agitation of the humors.

That I call a potent purgative, Potenter purgans.
which in small quantity, as that that's weighed by grains, causes a copious and
great dejection, which must be given in small quantity; as also all such as are
ungrateful, rare, dear, endued with potent efficacious virtue, or partaker of
any malignant quality.

Those are ungrateful, Ingr^ta qualia.
which by their odor grievously affect our nose or brain, as Castor,
Sagapenum, and Assa-foetida which being a stinking gum the Germans call the
Devils dung, or by their sapour, such as are bitter Medicaments as
Colocynthis, the lesser Centory: sharp, as Euphorbium, Bartram; most acid, as
the Oil of Sulphur and Vitriol, a few drops whereof in a due proportion mixed
with the syrup violets make it of a red shining color, and somewhat acid of
taste, and thereby very pleasant to the eyes and palate. A certain Court Doctor
at his first coming, gave this syrup thus altered by Art, equally for all
diseases with his own hands, who deceiving the vulgar with his ostentations,
called it the secret of secrets.

Those that are rare and dear, as Gems, Precious-stones, Pearl, Balsam,
Precious Aromatas, Amber, Musck, Civet, and such as work an alteration in the
body by their calidity or frigidity in the fourth degree, must be prescribed in
small quantity.

Those which by a certain antipathy, Qua magna cautela sumenda.
and special potency impair the principles of life, spirit and heat, consume
the flesh, and destroy the integrity of sanity, must not be exhibited without
extraordinary care and prudence; as Vipers flesh against the pestilence or
leprosy, the reins, or rather the flesh of the loins of Stincus to provoke to
Venery, Cantharides against the retention and obstruction of urine, for these
Cantharides rightly prepared and mixed with fit Medicaments, and administered in
a small quantity, do move urine without harm; but in a great quantity they stay
it, and impensly calefy the bladder. Rondeletius.

Minerals also, and all such as have more efficacious faculties, must be taken
sparingly; such as are more remiss, liberally.

Furthermore, those that conduce to the dulcoration, correction, or deduction
of other Medicaments, must be mixed always in a small quantity, as Cynamon,
Sanders, or Squinant, to conciliate suavity of odor or sapour in the
Medicament. Ginger to the castigation of Agarick, Saffron of Opium, opening and
mciding Medicaments to the dilation of the quality of other Medicaments to the
parts to be cured.

But nothing does so much dehort from a great quantity of any Medicament, as
its effrenate, prepotent, and malign quality; which as soon as it is educed
into act, does grievously disturb Nature, and excites a Troop of symptoms.

Those which are rare, and by their price fit Princes, and rich men, if
necessity require, may be prescribed in small quantity.

CHAP. X. In what quantity Simples must be mixed for composition.
FEW Compounds are found to confist of many Simples equal in proportion, but
two or more exceed the quantity of the rest. They exceed, which are the matters
Vicegerents, and induce an apt form to the Medicaments, as Oil, Wax, Lithargy,
in Salves and Unguents; or which are most potent in action, and constitute the
basis in composition, as Aloes in many Pills; as also such as have but weak
faculties in great quantity, or are adhibited for the preservation of others,
as Honey and Sugar in Electuaries and Syrups.

This rule is chiefly to be observed in the proportion of Medicaments to be
compounded, that that which brings more utility to the Medicament, should be
adhibited in greater quantity in composition.

They which are symbolical, whose matter is equally apt to induce the form of
the Medicament, and which are in their faculties equally averse to the cause
and symptom of the part affected, should be mixed in equal weight: which seems
to be observed in the Tetrapharmacal Unguent, which consists of equal portions
of Wax, Rosine, Pitch, and Bulls fat. And also in Justinus his Electuary, which
by Nic. Mirepsius his description, cap. 403. receives an equal portion of
thirty Simples, all which are thought by a certain propriety to break stones,
and clear the urinal passage. To these is added Honey and Sugar in a different
proportion, that the Electuary may acquire a convenient form, and apt
consistency, and be fitter for long preservation.

Some portion of simple Medicaments is measured by number, some by weight,
others by both; some in measures, some in handfulls, others in pugils.

The quantity of roots are variously measured for their dosis, according to
their various virtue and efficacy in operation. If their faculty gently move
the belly, they are measured by drams; if potently, by scruples; if they only
alter, by whole or half ounces; and when they make up a bath, by pounds or
handfulls.

In making Syrups of a great quantity, they may be exhibited from. j. to. ij.
or. iij. in decoctions for one dosis, from. ij. to. ss. or. j. or more or less,
according to the power of the roots. If the decoction be made for many doses,
their quantity must be proportionately augmented.

When two, three, or more roots of the same, or very like quality are
prescribed, a lesser quantity of each should be taken, that all conjoined may
make up the quantity of one, according to Rondolet. Which should also be
observed in all other Simples that are similar in quality, if so be they
equally conduce to the propugnating of one affection, and roborating one part.
And briefly, such as are endued with some acrimony, or eximious faculty, must
be mixed in small quantities, such as weak and gentle, in great.

The same rule should be observed in recent and dry herbs, which are measured
by one or more handfulls, according to their faculty, and the nature of the
Medicament to be compounded; for to some dosis we measure them by whole or half
handfulls, to a fomenting Medicine by two handfulls, to a bath by more.

Or sometimes bundles of little flowers, Fl^res.
whether recent or dry, as the flowers of Rosemary, Violets, Bugloss, we
measure sometimes by pugils, sometimes by weight. Great ones, if recent, as
Lillies, Roses, by handfulls; if arid, by drams or ounces in scales.

All seeds, Se^ina.
whether hot, cold, temperate, sharp, acerb, bitter, or ungrateful, are
librated by weight; but they ingrede the composition in different quantities,
according to the different virtue, or the Physicians scope.

Such as are most calid, most frigid and narcotical, if externally to be
adhibited, may be given from ij. to. j. if intrinsecally, to be assumed from.
j. to. j. or a little more or less, as the faculty is more or less potent.

Fruits, Fructusnumer^ and pondere m^nsurantur.
as well as roots, are different in magnitude and quality, whereof various
quantities are described, which are known after several manners. The least, as
Ribes and Barberries are prescribed by weight; the greater, as Sebesten and
Plums, by number; some by both, as Almonds, Jujubs, and dry Grapes. Many, which
because of their greatness are not integrally requisite, are cut into slices,
purged from their cores, shells, or stones, and then measured by drams or
ounces.

And that I may consummate all, Liquids are prescribed by m^asure, Solids by
weight, Fruits by number, Leaves by maniples, Flowers by pugils, every ones
dosis answering its quality. I hold it superfluous further to prosecute the
dosis, measure, or weight which should be taken of Woods, Barks, Pulse,
Animals, or things thereunto pertaining, since these may be discerned and
judged of by their ^^^sistency and quality, as also by what has been already
said.

CHAP. XI. Of the reposition of Medicaments.
THat we might dilucidly explicate the accurate composition of Medicaments, we
have largely discussed the mann^r of their confection, their basis, form, end,
and quantity of every Ingredient, as also the reason of their equality or
inequality. Now it rests, that the Medicaments thus composed be reposed in such
places as may conduce to the preservation of their vir^^es integral.

Now a Medicament, whether simple or compound, (for both must be kept) must not
be reposed in any but in a fit and convenient place, that it be not altered and
corrupted, but kept in its perfect vigor till opportunity causes its delivery
to such as it fits.

A Simple must first be selected, and purged from filth, and its
excrementitious and useless parts, and then dried, that it may be kept; for
humid things will not keep without moulding and putrefaction.

Herbs must be dried in a shade, Herbarum repositio.
or a place where the Sun scorches net, yet not marcid, but dry, and void of
fumes and dust, and then bound in little bundles, must be reposed in canvass or
paper bags, lest they take detriment by the aforesaid cumbrances. Flowers must
also be thus dried, reposed, and so conserved. Now Conservation and Reposition
are related.

Dry and gross herbs take no harm from the rigor of cold, but liquid and humid
are casily condensed; which appropinquating to heat, are thereby brought to
their pristine state. Yet distilled waters by immoderate congelation lose much
of their bonity, and are often effused by the abruption of the glasses wherein
they are reposed through the vehemence of cold, unless the Confectioners care
prevent it.

In January and February, 1608. while I was distilling waters, Saevitia Hy^mis,
anno 1608.
the rigor of the winter was so vehement for six whole weeks together, that it
broke all my earthen, glass, tin, and copper vessels, (though ^^ry strong)
wherein I had put the waters: And when bread was drawn hot from the oven, it
presently acquired a stony obdurateness; ^oither were the wine-cellars free
from frost. And when the vehemence of the cold assuaged, all the houses in
Lutetia were white both within and without with horrid ice. In which time many
were vexed with the disease of the Lungs, whereof very many dyed.

Fruits are repoled sometimes in Storehouses, Frullum.
as Apples; sometimes in Barrels, as Plums; often in glass or wooden Boxes
closed with papers, lest fumes or dust should alter them, as Jujubs, and also
lest Flies erode and spoil them.

Seeds after siccation are reposed in glass or wood vessels, Seminum.
and kept in a dry place.

Roots after purgation and are faction are reserved in wooden Bo^^^ or Chests,
Radicum.
wrapped sometimes in bombast; if precious, as Chinca^ Rhabarb, lest the noxious
quality of the air, or edacity of heat, spoil their qualities, and corrupt them.

Liquid juices are reposed in bottles, Saceorum.
or other vessels with strait^rifices, whereupon Oil must be diffused, lest
they be altered by the air.

Juices are also reposed in wooden Boxes, or glass or earthen Vessels, as also
Water-drops, Gums, whole or parts of Animals and Minerals.

Liquors, Liqu^rum and Oleorum.
Oils, Liquidambar, and Balsam, are reposed in glass Bottles stopped with cork,
or wax, and some bladder, that they may not be dissipated by the air.

Turpentine may not only be well reserved in an iron or glass Vessel, but in a
figuline also.

Some are best preserved in the highest part of the house, some in the middle,
and some no where save in wine-cellars, or such madid place, as Cassia.

Compound Medicaments, according to their different consisteacies and virtues,
require for their Cepositories different Vessels, as Hydromel, a Barrel;
Syrups, Potters vessels, and for carriage sa^^ Boxes of white Iron or Tin; as
the Syrup of Mompelian Maidenhair, which reposed in such a vessel, may be
commodiously conveye^ to exotic regions; solid Electuaries, wooden Boxes;
liquid o^^, tin or earthen Vessels well leaded; Powders, glass; Unguents, (...)
pots. Thus every one requires a Repository convenient to its nature.

CHAP. XII. Of the conservation and duration of Medicaments.
AS we do not use to confect Compounds, so neither do we gather Simples for one
dosis, but select and prepare a greater quantity of each for future uses: which
that they may be safe from dust, fumes, putrefaction, or injuries by the air,
or insects, as by Flies, Mice, and the like, we repose in fit Vessels, or
include in Bags, or involve in Papers, and keep all in our Pharmacopoly, except
such as require a more humid, or more dry place, as Cassia, a Wine-cellar;
Sugar, Conditures, Junkets, and most Sweet meats, an Oven, or Closet near the
fire.

Many for their conservation must be condited with Vinegar, Salt, or both, as
Cucumbers, Capers, Olives; or with Sugar or Honey, as all kind of Medicaments,
whereof Electuaries or Syrups are composed.

Decoctions will keep in Summer two or three days, in Winter a whole week;
distilled Waters and Conserves, a whole year.

Syrups perfectly cocted, Electuaries; Trochisks, Pills, Oils, Ungu^nts, and
Salves, will often keep two years; as also Roots, Woods, Barks, dry Juices,
Tears and Gums, three years, and sometimes four; Elateries, thirty years;
Nails, Bones, Horns, an age.

Some can scarce be long preserved without the presence of those things with
which they hold familiarity, as the Magnet with Iron, with whose limature it is
nourished, and upon whose absence it decays, and loses its vigor.

Others better preserve their faculties, if by the appropinquation of other
things they be vindicated from the injury of the air and worms. Thus Camphyre
buried in Linseed is safely kept, Limmons and Oranges in a heap of Wheat will
not so soon putrefy; and Mechoacams root involved in Wormwood keeps its
faculties entire, and will not be so easily croded.

Musk and Civet are safely conserved in lead boxes: but that they should
resartiate their lost virtue by suspension in the middle of a Boghouse,
Platearius his advice derided.
Platearius his nose can only find.

Saffron, Cloves, Pepper, Mace, and other aromatical Spices, are best conserved
in leather bags; Storax, Belzoin, in glass boxes; Sanders, sweet Aloes,
Mastick, Schaenantum, Seeds, and innumerable more, in Costers, o^ wooden Boxes;
of which, more in our Shop.

Medicaments therefore, as well simple as compound, if they be thus sedulously
conserved, will endure long; if not, they soon fade and decay.

But the greatest part of these should be changed every year; yet if any change
not their color, odor, and sapour, they need not. Now those keep longest
which are of a gross substantiality, and whose qualities tenaciously and firmly
adhere to their substances; as on the contrary, those do not endure long whose
substance is rare, as Flowers, and those whose virtues are superficial and
dissipable. Yet those are kept better and longer which are included in close
Boxes, or Vessels well operculated, for so their virtue is retained more
securely. Many think, that Antidotes against the poison of Beasts are safest
kept in leaden Vessels, which in Galen's time were reposed in precious, and now
in earthen Vessels.

CHAP. XIII. Of such as by a certain Antinomasia are preferred before others,
from which their denomination is desumed.
THat God might free Man from those eru^nies and egritudes wherewith he is
daily pestered, he has adorned the Earth like a little Paradise, or rich
Garden with innumerable Herbs and Plants, that by their pleasant odor
refocillate his spirits, by their variegated colors recreate his eyes, which
in sanity allow him nutriment, in fickness resreshment, and liberty from the
all commanding Tyrant Death.

In which plentiful Soil, many of the same kind fruicate and occur us, which
being indistinguishable because of their similarity in form and quality, have
obtained the same denomination. For who can dis^inguish of the infinite sorts
of Flowers and Grass? who can define their number? or describe the differences
of Gerania, Heriatum, Anemones, Daffadils, and many more Plants, in whose
various variety Nature seems to delight it self.

Now since some of these are absolutely described without any addition of
particular or peculiar description, those must always be elected and used
which Experience has proved better. And this Theorem must be perpetually
observed in such as have some analogy among themselves, that that be always
assumed which is best in every kind; as when we describe Aloes simply, we mean
Al^e s^ccatrine.

And that I may give you a few examples for many. When we put Vinegar simply,
we do not mean that they may take Beer, but Winevinegar; when Balsam, we mean
Egyptian Balsam; when Benioin, we mean that same which, from its white spots
like Almonds, is called Amygdalite.

And when we put Cassia absolutely, Cassia Fistula must be exhibited; when
Coral, red, which is accounted best.

So also the rest are understood of the best of that kind: as Dittany Of The
Cretensian Dittany. Aristolochy Of Round. Sweet root Of Liquorice. Endive Of
Broad-leav'd Succory. Epithyme Of Woodbind growing about Thyme Fenicle Of
Fennel. Earth gall Of The lesser Centaury. Gum Of Arabic. Pomegranate Of Acid.
Hepatica Of Liverwort. Ivy Of Corymbiferous. Jasmine Of White. Henbane Of
White. Lettice Of Garden. Lilly Of White and bulbous. Horebound Of White. Mint
Of Garden. Githe Of The seed only. Water-lilly Of White. Cresses Of The seed
only. Oil Of Olive. Opium Of Thebane. Poppy Of White. Polypody Of the Oak. The
lesser Quercle Of Germander. The greater Plantain Of Ribwort. Rose Of Red.
Meadow-green Of Meadow-sweet. Staechados Of Arabic. Santalum Of The Citron.
Longwort Of White. Turpentine Of Venetian. Betony Of Masculine. Violet Of
Black, or rather ceruleout. Xyloaloes Of Blackish. Iris Of Florentinian. Ginger
Of Malvaticall, which is the best and most sought of by Persians, Arabians, and
Barbarians.


CHAP. XIV. Of such Roots, Seeds, Flowers, Stones, and Waters, as excel others
in dignity.
MAny Simples of several kinds have symbolical qualities; and yet Experience
has demonstrated, that some of them excel others, and are more convenient for
the profligation of diseases, as being endued with a better altering,
roborating, or purging faculty, and exhibiting more successful effects; of
which are some Plants, or parts thereof, and some Minerals, which being
absolutely described, put the Apothecary upon doubts, Radices aperientes
majores.
who is ignorant of the genuine dilucidation: whose tenuity, that we may
auxiliate, we will give him the names of the five opening roots; Radices
aperitive majores.
and they are the roots of Smallage, Sperage, Parsley, Fennel, and
Butchers-broom. Besides which, other five are much celebrated, to wit, the
roots of Grass, the greater Madder, Oenone, Capers, and Eryngium.

The four greater or colder seeds are the seeds of Limons, Semina frigida 4.
majora.
Gourds, Melons, and Cucumbers; the four lesser, of Lettices, Purslain, Endive
and Succory.

The four greater or hotter seeds, Semina calida majora, and totidem minora.
are of Anise, Fennel, Cummin, and Carraway; the four less hot, of Ameos, our
Ladies Rose, Smallage, Carret.

Cordial flowers are only three, Cordiales tres.
to wit, of Violets, Bugloss, and Borrage; which if they be such, are then most
effectual, when recent and retentive of their color and odor; for when they
are dry, insipid, and inodorous, they have either quite lost, or much weakened
their qualities.

And indeed the qualities of all flowers perish with their odor, sapour, and
color.

But I am of opinion, that Roses, which of all flowers retain their suavity
longest, as also all such as by their gracious odor exhilarate the spirits,
are most cordial; for all suaveolent flowers, whether herbal, as the Lilly of
the Valley; or arbustal or arboral, as the flowers of Orange trees are cordial,
and may with success be used in medicinary business.

The flowers of Chamemile, Melilote, and Anise, are accounted cordial: but I
prefer as more excellent, the flowers of Oranges, Jasmine, Deluce, Sage,
Rosemary, Betony, Clove-gilliflowers, and many others, which with their
fragrancy delight the nose, and recreate the spirits.

The hairs or capillary herbs are five, ^erbe capillares quinque.
Maidens-hair, commonly called Mompiensian hair, common Adiantium, Polytricum,
Citrarch, or Wall-fern, Rue on the wall, without all reason called Salvia
vitae, to which we may add Epithymum and Woodbind.

The common mollifying herbs are four, Mallows, Marsh mallows, Emmollientes
berbae octo.
black Violet, Garden Bear-foot, or brank Ursine; whereunto four more are
adjoined, Mercury, Pelitory of the wall, Beet, and Arache, all which are used
in making the decoction of Clysters, and laxative Cataplasms.

There are many precious Fragments, Fragmentae pretiosa quinque.
but five artificially in use among Physicians, as of Sapphire, Granate,
Emerald, Hyacinth, Sardis.

The Vulgar know only four kinds of Cordial Waters, and cannot be persuaded to
a fifth, to wit, of Endive, Succory, Bugloss, and Borrage: but I find eight
besides these that are more cordial, to wit, the Water of Carduus, Scabiose,
Marigold, Devils bit, Woodsorrel, Goats-beard, Sorrel, and Water-lillyes.

Some conduce to the roboration of the brain, Quatuor aquae cephalicae.
and are therefore called Cephalical Waters, which are four, to wit, the Water
of Betony, Balm, Roses, and Orange tree flowers.

There are also in Shops four hot Unguents, as Ung. Aregon, Quatuor unguenta
calida, and quatuor frigida.
Martiatum, Altheae, and Agrippae; and as many frigid ones, to wit, Ung. Album,
Rosatum, Populeum, Citrinum.

CHAP. XV. Of succedaneous Medicaments.
PHysicians should not use Succedaneous Medicaments, unless they be thereunto
compelled, either having not knowledge, or having not trial of the requisite
Medicament: yet an Apothecary by the Medicks advice may substitute a convenient
Medicament instead of another that is so rare as it cannot be had, or so dear
as it cannot be purchased: yet so, that the succedaneous be in species, kind,
and virtue very similar and answerable to the deficient; and if it may be, a
simple Medicament should be put for a simple, and a compound for a compound: as
A Plant for a Plant, A Root for a Root, A Bark for a Bark, Seed for Seed,
Liquor for Liquor, Gum for Gum, Rosine for Rosine, Oil for Oil, Mineral for
Mineral, Salt for Salt, Earth for Earth, Stone for Stone, Gem for Gem, Metal
for Metal, Animal for Animal, Part for Part.


The same Law must be observed in compounds but not so strictly, for powder
must be put for powder, eclegme for eclegme, electuary for electuary, syrup for
syrup: Yet there is often such affinity in quality betwixt Medicaments of
different consistencies, that a substitution may be easily admitted. For if any
has an aversation to a bechicall eclegme, he may without danger assume syrup
of jujubs, and he that refuses pills, why may he not assume some other
catharticke of equal virtue in a potion? Thus Physicians do often indulge their
Patients, by prescribing liquids to such as nauseate solids, and on the
contrary.

Yet a simple Medicament is not always substituted for a simple one, for since
one can scarce find two simples alike in all things: for the want of one, to
which no single one responds, we substitute two or more, whose concourse
exhibit the similar virtues, whether in elementary qualities, as heat, cold,
humiditie, and siccitie, or in secundary qualities, which follow the
modification of the matter: For it is enough, if the substituted Medicament
effect that, which the genuine and deficient promised. For one that wants a
rare and precious Medicament calefying or refrigerating in the seoend degree,
and has other two, the one hot or cold in the third degree, the other in the
first; may by putting these two together, acquire one accommodate to his
purpose, to wit calefying or refrigerating in the second recesse, which rule is
of use in mixing attenuating, incrassating and other simples.

But because the soil and the heavens change the qualities of simples, as we
have observed in the Persian tree; we must with diligence observe which are
fittest for substitution, for there is much difference betwixt our flower
deluce, and that of Florence: for their is Cephalicall, and Bechicall, our
Phlegmagogous and strongly purgative. And as Canary wine is more noble than
Spanish, and Spanish than French wine: so the grapes from which they are
expressed, are of distinct qualities, sapours and degrees of heat: and
therefore simples of the same kind and species have not always got the same
temperature and degree of qualities, for what grows in a hotter soil is
hotter: and in a colder colder.

When therefore a Medicament, is prescribed, which because of its soil is
hotter, Quamado gradu tertio aut quarto calidum substituitur pro minn^ ^alids.
and cannot be got, another of the same kind may be substituted, through the
colder, if in greater quantity.

For that which is hot in the fourth degree may be taken in such a quantity, as
it may only calefie in the third degree; as for example, if you take but about
four grains of Euphorbium, it will calefy only in the third degree, which in
greater quantity would calefy in the fourth; and by how much you take less,
by so much it calefies less; but every Medicament has a determinate dosis,
else so small a portion might be given, that though it were fire, yet would it
neither burn nor calefie; and Cloves, which are hot in the third degree, if
less than three grains of them be administered, they calefy not to the third
degree, and so of all qualities in their degrees.

Now there are in every degree three parts or mansions, Cujusque gradus tres
parts.
beginning, middle and end, which are so constituted, that the beginning of one
degree coincidates with the end of another, as the beginning of the fourth with
the end of the fifth. So the end of Winter differs little from the beginning of
the spring.

The usual dosis of such as calefy in the fourth degree is of four grains,
whereof there being three mansions; Dosis callidorum in quarto gradu.
the chief dosis which attains the end of that same grade, is of twelve grains:
that which attains the middle, sixteen, and the beginning, twenty grains, which
is the dosis of such as calefy in the end of the third degree.

Wherefore when any want a Medicament, that califies or frigifies in the end of
the first degree, he may substitute one that is called or frigid in the
beginning of the second degree; he that wants a medicament hot in the end of
the second degree, may exhibit one that's hot in the beginning of the third.

Now since the doses of compounds are deduced from simples, according to the
deficiency of any simple, another may be substituted which is Analogicall to
the deficient, in the mixtion whereof, if the aforesaid Laws be observed, the
result in the compound will be no way deficient by substitution.

CHAP. XVI. What Medicaments, and when they are rightly substituted.
LEast our Pharmaceuticall treati should be defective, or a patient destitute
of praesidy, when his auxiliatory Physician prescribes him something, that
neither the Pharmacopolitans shops, nor gardens affoard, we will here describe
the supplements of such defects, which the Greeks call (...), the Latins
Succedanea and Substituta, or more vulgarly quid pro quo.

But as we before observed, such substitutes should be similar, What
substitutes ought not to be allowed of.
i^vertue to those whose place they spply, and whose vicegerents they are; now
if such cannot be found, then those must be elected which differ in little, and
respond in many things. For its absurd to call those succedaneous Vicegerents,
which are mdued with opposite not succedaneous and symbolicall qualities, and
they write without reason, who substitute Euphorbium for Agarick, Pellitory
(...) Sorrel, and Melliote for a Quince, for these have no affinity with each
other.

But when some weaker are substituted in place of better, their qualities must
be augmented by quantity, for quantity reduplicated recompenses the weakness of
the quality, as on the contrary, if the substitute be too valid, less quantity
must be exhibited, that thereby its rigor may be diminished.

Now, this should not be done without the advice of some skillful Doctor, which
many do not only despise, but themselves prescribe Medicaments to the great
damage of their patients, but such are for the most part unconstant,
importunate, and talkative knaves, who trimly apparelled intrude themselves to
the sicks presence, and deceive them with fair speeches. I speak of that
impious rabble, who deceive the incautious vulgar; but the skillful and
prudent, who take nothing rashly, but at a Phisicians advice and preception,
may substitute, legitimate Vicegerents in the place of such as want or are
decayed.

Those that without choice and care repose for genuine and good, what ever
Medicament comes first to their hands, will make dangerous Medicaments, and
substitutions.

One was wont pleasantly to inculcate that of the Ninivite to such a busy
fellow, Saepe loco illius quid pono.

Least therefore any error be committed in reposition of suppositories, we
shall here place the substitute in opposition to the deficient. You may
substitute.

Sweet Cassia, Cynamon. For Yylobalsum, Radix Ligustici. For Ginger, Pepper. For
Civet, Musck.
But because it seldom falls out that one can err twice in a Medicine, let
junior Apothecaryes diligently beware, least they substitute any thing without
the Physicians advice; if they do otherwise, they may exhibit and sell
spurious Medicaments for legititimate; as I have 1000. times observed in some
ignorant fellows who without discretion substitute any simple which of its
self is deficient.

CHAP. XVII. Of Adulterate Medicaments.
Men's insatiable avarice has rapt some to that height of iniquity, that they
exhibit Adulterate Medicaments for true and genuine; the dignotion whereof is
of great moment in making Medicaments, and should be a Physicians and an
Apothecaryes employment accurately to learn, that to be their patients may
exhibited none but good, which may conduce to their adjument, and sanity; not
adulterate, whose end is peril and languour.

These I thought meet to detect, least some unskilful Apothecary be deceived
by such circumforaneous prestigiatours, who often sell the flowers of Carthamus
for Crocus, and Ivory for Monocerots horn; and similate many more, especially
rare and precious Medicaments, whose use is frequent, and virtues eximious.

Least therefore the Apothecary, in whose hand the life or death of a patient
is, be imprudently circumduced by these wicked slaves, for lucres sake, to
circumvent the patient, I Will show him how to detect and avoid these impious
frauds and deceits.

A lump of Kids blood kneaded in hot bread pulverised, Moschi adulterium
and Ladanum dissolved and kept in a box, after they are mixed, wherein true
musk had been reposed, does much similate musk: yet it may be detected by its
consistency, color and odor, which soon fails in the fictitious.

The powder of Xyloaloes, Benjoin, Storax, Ambra.
and Ladanum mixed together similate together.

But the peculiar native odor of genuine Amber may be easily diseerned from
these: Moreover Amber by long attrition in ones hands becomes more friable,
these more soft.

The bark of Tamariske, Cinamomi.
macerated in Cinnamon water; and dried very much, similates Cinnamon: but the
taste will difference them.

Cloves that are inodorous by age will become fragrant by madefaction in wine,
Caryo byllorum.
wherein good Cloves have been macerated, but this acquired odor is fugacious.

Rosin, Belzoin.
Frankincense, and a little Storax, mixed together, do fraudulently similate
Belzoin: but as they differ in odor, so also in color, the spurious being
full of white spotts.

Some instead of Camphyre sell the gum of Juniper: Camshora.
but none can be thus imposed upon, but such as are very ignorant, for any one
that's conversant with Aesculapius may at the first sight detect the fraud.

Opobalsamum with a little oil does very much represent liquidambar,
Oso^alsamo ^^u danbar ass^^e.
wherewith it has affinity in its faculties, and this has been so peritely
adulterated, that it has deceived the most experienced in Paris.

The Oriental Earth, Terra Lemmia orientalis.
called Terra Lemnia, is represented by Bole, or common Argill dried,
pulverated, kneaded with Plantain water, made into pastills, and signed with
the great Turks sigill, with which Character much comes from Bellonium: but the
falsity will be deprehended, if both be washed with water, for the water of
Terra Lemnia will be fatter, the other more limpid and tenuious.

They vitiate Bitumen also by the mixture of pitch, Bitumen.
but the fire will discover it, for that which has pitch in it, will emit a
pleasant odor. Opii.


Opium is similated by Meconium, or the juice of the leaves, and stalk of black
Poppy, but the error may be discerned by the fatness, which is much in the
genuine, none in the adulterate.

Manna Thuris may easily be adulterated, Manna thuris.
since the powder of Rosin does much resemble it, but fire detects the fraud.

Tacamahaca, Tacamahaca,
is adulterated with Gum Elemi, which is very like the true one, for they
respond in color, consistency, and odor, only the one is a little more
pleasant to the nose.

Sagapene, Galbanum, Opoponax, and Serapinum, being common, are seldom
adulterated. But Bedellium being more rare is adulterated by course Mirrh, and
so imposed upon idiots.

Sassafras was unknown of old in Europe; which at its first allation was sold
dear, and was thereupon much sophisticated. I knew a man that sold the powder
of Box-wood and Fennell-seed for the powder of saffafras: but when plenty of
the genuine was conveyed, the adulteration ceased.

Some knaves sell an Oxes heart-bone, for a Hearts heart-bone, but they that
know both approve of the Hearts, and reject the other, as endued with no
eximious virtue.

Some substitute great plums for Tamarinds; but they do ill in calling them
Tamarinds, since they differ so apertly in shell, pulpe, and sapour.

I could detect the adulteration and manner thereof of a thousand other
Medicaments, out of Dioscorides and other, as well ancient as modern Writers,
but I hold it better toconceale them, since man is so prone to evil, and so
perite to deceive: this I Will say by the way, that waters, liquors, juices and
compound Medicaments may be easily adulterated, simples, especially integrall
ones, not so easily.

The end of the fourth Book.
OF PHARMACEUTICAL INSTITUTIONS. The fifth Book. Of the forms of Medicaments,
whose use is celebrous in precaution and profligation of diseases.
THE FIRST SECTION, Of such as are assumed at the mouth.
THE PREFACE.
AS many Aliments are condited with mixture of several things, and prepared
with laborious artifice, that they may be long conserved without petretude and
marcour, as Pastyes, Puddings, many farciments and biscake, on which the
Mariners feed sometimes by the space of two years, while they sail to the
Indies, or as that same Powder or meal which the Turkish Soldiers carry in
their Zones made like knapsacks, which they knead with water, and coct to the
consistence of a pultis, and so feed upon it a whole month. Others being
conservative not above a day or two, and some not above an hour without
alteration. So many Medicaments will endure in integrall strength for the space
of a year or two, being conserved in Pharmacopolyes, as in a rich storehouse
for future uses: Others not enduring without damage the space of two days in
Summer, as those which are prepared for present use, whereof we have determined
in order to discourse in this our last Book, beginning with them, that are
intrinsecally assamed, either by the mouth or other convenient place, as Nose,
Fundament, and the like; which are variously compounded, not only according to
the variety of the nature of the disease, but also of the part affected, which
must have some one, some another consistency, that they may be more
commodiously applied, more fitly adhere, or with more ease be deferred to the
part affected, as potibles must be liquid, edibles solid, and applicatives
indifferent, all which, that we may severally prosecute, we will begin with
potulents, and then describe other more solid Medicaments in this first
Section: we will in the second subjoyn a special treatise of such as are
injected into the belly, or uterus: in the third, we will describe those
Medicaments which are applied to the extrinsecall parts of the body.

CHAP. I. Of some ordinary decoctions common by their long use.
Sometimes the substance alone, sometimes the juice, sometimes the decoction of
the Medicament is administered, which decoction, that it may be more easily and
successefully assumed, must be of simple, distilled, or other convenient water,
or humor, as the intention of the Physician and exigency of the matter
requires. Now the liquor, wherein the decoction is made that must be assumed at
the mouth (of which alone we now speak) should be endued with no insuave, or
violent quality. For potulent decoctions made in the juice of Wormwood, lesser
Centory, immature grapes, or Lee, or vinegar, are neither safe, nor grateful:
but unguents, Pills Fotus, and whatever is extrinsecally applicable, that
requires decoctions to their preparations, may be decocted in any convenient
humor, whether bitter, acerb, salty, or oily, if the condition of the disease
or part affected postulate it.

But now we treat of that more special decoction, Quarum decoctionum frequ^ns
usus.
which after percolation, is assumed by the mouth, either alone or mixed, with
other Medicaments dissolved; of which sort, is the common decoction of any
Medicament, and the pectorall decoction, which no Medick can well be without.

Now every decoction is either small, or much, or indifferent, according to the
substance and strength of the Medicament, which is to be cocted; Quae parum aut
multum decoqucnda.
for some must be decocted gently, as having a rare sustance, and weak and
dissipable faculties; others will sustain a (...) valid decoction, as
consisting of a firm, crass, and dense substance, and endued with faculties not
so dissoluble; others require a mode rate decoction, whose substance and
faculties are of a mean consistency: thus Fruits would not be so little, nor
Flowers so much cocted as Roots.

When a Decoction is prescribed absolutely, without the special designation of
any liquor, Aquae quantitas in decoctis parandis.
it ought to be made either in pure and simple water, as fountain or river
water, or else in rain water; the quantity whereof must respond to the quantity
of the Simples to be cocted, as near as may be, without exuberance or defect;
for when Simples through coction depose their qualities into the water, if it
be copious, and they few, the decoction after percolation will retain be weak
faculties: As on the contrary, if many Simples be cocted i^ little water, the
decoction will be exhaled and dissipated, and the Simples burned rather than
brought to elixation; which is acquired by moderate heat in an humor
proportionate to the quantity and ^^ture of the thing cocted.

Those that sustain the longest coction, require more abundance of water, the
shorter the less, many Simples require much: so that those that are hard, and
require long coction, should be demerged in water, and covered two or three
fingers therein. Thus a certain measure of water cannot be defined, but is
often left to the Apothecaries judgment.

When a Decoction is to be made only for one dosis, Aquae quantitas pro dosi
pa randa.
it is enough to elixate a few Simples in half a pound of water on a slow fire,
till it be boiled to half; if for two dosis, then in a whole pound of water; if
for four, in two pounds. And thus may the quantity of water be augmented, as
the Simples are augmented.

There are furthermore three Decoctions very usual in making Medicines. The
first is called the common Decoction, which is commonly used to the dissolution
of Purgatives, sometimes to the coction of Senny leaves, and sometimes to the
infusion of Simples.

The second is commonly called the pectoral Decoction, because it is used to
all such as bring adjument to the pectoral parts. The third is the glysteral
Decoction; of which in its place.

All men do not describe their Confections alike, but every (...) adds or
detracts something according to his judgment. This is the most vulgar and
usual description of the common Decoction.

. of clean Barley, p. j. of sweet Plums, nu. vj. of Raisons stoned, Liquorice
scraped, an. ^. ss. of Anise and Fennel seeds, an.. ij. is winter; Decoctio
communis medicinae.
but in summer of the four greater cold seeds, an. ij. of the three cordial
flowers, an. p. j. let the Decoction be made in two pound of water till half be
consumed. This Decoction percolated will be enough for four ordinary doses, or
three extraordinary.

The pectoral Decoction, whereof is frequent use in pectoral affections, is
variously also prescribed: but that which Rondeletius gave, is thus amended by
Bauderonius.

. of whole Barley, p. j. of Figs and Jujubs, an. nu. vj. of Dactyls, Decoctio
pectoralis.
nu. vj. of Raisons stoned, and Liquorice, an.. ss. of Hyssop pretty dry, m.
ss. boil them in lb. ij. of rain or fountain water, to the half.

Some substitute Sebestens for Jujubs, others augment the quantity of Hyssop,
others add Capillaries, and Cordial Flowers: but since their virtue is
pectoral enough, which are contained in the form prescribed, there is no
necessity of loading it with more; especially considering, that by how much
more Simples go to the making of them up, by so much is their making and
assumption more difficult; and so on the contrary.

CHAP. II. Of a Dosis.
THat certain and convenient quantity of any Medicament, which is prescribed,
or rather given to a sick man at once, or necessity compelling at twice, is a
Dosis: for Dosis is Dation; whereof there are as many varieties, as there are
differences in the nature or properties of Medicaments, or Bodies to which the
Medicaments are offered. Dosis medicamentorum varia.
For there is one Dosis of Liquids, another of Solids, and another of those
that have a middle consistency. Catharticks also are given in various Doses,
which having once entered into the body, if they be too valid, or exhibited in
too great measure, do not only exagitate the superfluous humors, but also the
good and laudable, and by griping the bowels, hurt the faculties there
inhering. One Dosis also is given to children, another to young men, another to
men of strength, another to old men, according to their several natures,
customs, and strength. The Dosis of Liquids is measured and given in ounces;
of Solids, sometimes in grains, often in drams, and sometimes in ounces.

Altering Medicaments are seldom given by one ounce alone, Alterantium
medicamentorum dosis.
unless it be to children, or else that they be endued with eximious and valid
qualities, as Aqua vitae, Cinnamon, and those we call Imperial.

Their more usual Dosis consists of three or four ounces; if they be exhibited
in greater measure, they cause loathings, they subvert the ventricle, and are
insuccessfully excluded by vomit.

Roboratives, especially liquid ones, Roborantium dosis.
are given from one ounce to three or four; solid ones are sometimes given by
grains, as the Powder of Monoceros; sometimes by scruples and drams, as Cordial
Confections, and many Antidotes.

Purgatives are measured and given after the same manner, Purgantium.
some by three, six, or eight grains, as Diacrydion, and Stibium also, which
though it be immite and effrenous, yet tamed and castigated by Art, and
exhibited by a prudent Physician, often produces successful effects: And I see
no reason why it may not be used in stead of better, to the cure of a
contumacious disease.

For if it be lawful for man's subsidy to seek remedies from Vipers flesh,
Neotericorum in inveniendis remediis sedulitas.
and their very skin and excrements, how can it be illegitimate to expect
solace from those Medicaments, which Neotericks sedulity have invented, their
industrious dexterity have secured, and many experiences have proved; though
the Ancients either were ignorant of them, neglected them, or administered them
unduely, as now adays many malevolent Circulators, who kill innumerable with
their Stibium that is ill prepared, and exhibited in an undue dosis, neither
when, nor to whom it is meet.

And that I may return to my purpose; Quam varia catharticorum dosis.
some Catharticks are given only in a small dosis, as Colocynthis, and
Hellebor, by a few grains or scruples; others by drams, as Rheum; others by
ounces, as Manna, Cassia, Tamarinds.

A Dosis then denotes a quantity of a Medicament fit to be exhibited at once;
as when any Medicament of three or four ounces at the most is made into the
form of a potion, Decoction, or distilled; wherein we dilute Roboratives, as
Powders, Antidotes, and Cordial Confections; or infuse Catharticks, as Agarick;
or dissolve them, as Catholicon or Diacarthamum; whereof every one has its
peculiar dosis, whereby it should be given in greater or lesser quantity, as it
is of weak or valid faculties. But to describe every of these according to the
nature and quality of every Medicament, and body, were to comprehend the whole
method of Medicine.

CHAP. III. Of a purgative Potion.
EVery kind of Medicaments may be given in any form, but not so fit perhaps to
cure a Disease, or help any part. The most usual form of such as free the
passages of obstructions, deduce the vessels, Purgantia cur in forma potabili
convenientiora.
and provoke monthly flowers and urine, is liquid. But those especially that
are purgative, require a more potable form, for hereby they more promptly
diffuse themselves, more easily ingrede the small veins, and more efficaciously
deduce the humor inhering in those parts. For one dram of a solid Medicament
diluted with some humor, Catharticum liquidum citius ducit.
will move the belly more than twice as much of it whole. Wherefore when we say
a purgative Medicament absolutely, we mean a laxative Potion, whose dosis
should seldom exceed three ounces, lest by moving the ventricle, it be
presently excluded by vomit.

Now purgative Potions are various, according to the various nature of the
Medicaments, and humors to be educed: For every humor except blood, which is
vacuated only by the section of some vein or artery, has its proper eductive
Cathartick; that which purges Choler, is called a Cholagogous; that which
purges Melancholy, Melanagogous; and Phlegm, a Phlegmagogous Medicament.

And of each of these, whether simple or compound, are made purgative Potions,
when they are macerated, infused, dissolved, or cocted in some fit liquor; as
to educe Choler, thus:

. of the roots of Succory, Sorrel, Liquorice, an.. ij. of Endive, Cholagogon.
Fumitory, Agrimony, an. m. ss. of the three cordial Flowers, an. p. j. let a
Decoction be made in a small quantity of water, wherein infuse of Rhabarb,. ij.
ss. of Orange colored Sanders,. ss. dissolve in the expression Syrup of
Violets,. vj. and make a potion thereof.

When a stronger Purge is required, either you may augment the quantity of the
things, or take a stronger Medicament; as this:

. of Diaprun. dissolved, or Electuary of the juice of Roses,. iij. Alia potio
validior.
let it be dissolved in. iij. of the fore mentioned Decoction, or of Endive
water; put to it of the syrup of Succory compounded with Rhabarb,. j. and make
a Potion.

Phlegm may be deduced by many Medicaments, as well simple as compound, as well
as Choler; whereof I shall take these few prescriptions in stead of many
examples.

. Polypody of the Oak, Grass roots, Raisons stoned, of each,. iij. of the seeds
of Carthamus,. ij. Germander, Ground Pine, Betony, of each, m. ss. of Anise
seed,. j. make a Decoction, in which boil on a slow fire of the leaves of
Senny,. ij. ss. in the colature infuse of Agarick,. j. ss. in the expression
dissolve of the syrup of white Roses,. j. make a Potion thereof.

In such a Decoction after colation you may dilute of the Electuary of
Diacarthamus,. iij, or. ss. of the syrup of damask Roses,. j. that it may be a
Potion.

Senny, Rhabarb, and Polypody, vacuate phlegm also, and so do Turbitum,
Carthamus seed, Colocynthis, Widow-wail, Veratrum album.
white Hellebor, the seed and root of Wall-wort, Benedicta Laxativa, and
Diaphoenicum; whereof a perite Artificer may make various purgative Potions.

Melancholy also has its peculiar Catharticks, as Epithymum, Melancholiam quae
ducunt.
Azure stone, Senny, black Hellebor; and amongst the compounds, the Confection
Hamech, Catholicum, Diasenna, and King Sabor's syrup. Of one or more whereof
dissolved, infused, or cocted in some convenient liquor, a purgative Medicament
may be confected; as thus:

. Barks and roots of Capers and Tamarisks, roots of Bugloss, Melanagogon
optimum.
Liquorice, Raisons and Currens, of each, iij. of whole Barley,. ss. Cateras.
Maiden hair, Marigolds, Borrage, of each, m. ss. of the three cordial Flowers,
of each, p. j. of which make a Decoction, wherein infuse Senna,. ss. sweet
Fennel seeds,. j. in the Colature dissolve sir. Regis Saboris,. j. make it into
a Potion.

Or,. Liquorice, Raisons stoned, an. iij. Jujubs, nu. vj. Epithymus,
Spleenwort, tops of Hops, Wood sorrel, Fumatory, an. m. (...) Broom flowers, p.
ij. make a Decoction, in which dissolve Confectio Hamech,. j. ss. Diasenna,.
ij. syrup of Violets,. vj. or ^. j. make it into a Potion.

Catholicum also is useful to purge Melancholy; Catholicum polychrestum est.
for being universally commodious to purge any noxious humor, it easily
accommodates it self to those wherewith it is mixed; as if it be mixed with
Rhabarb, it purges Choler; if diluted in the decoction of Senny, o^ mixed with
the confection of Hamech, it purges Melancholy.

CHAP. IV. Of Juleps.
THE acception of Julep and Syrup with the Arabians is almost one and the same,
for they confound them together, and speak of them under the same head or
Chapter, understanding nothing more by an absolute Julep, than Sugar dissolved
in Rose water, and cocted to the consistency of a Syrup. But we speaking more
distinctly, treat of them both, but in several Chapters and Books, to wit, of
Syrups, which should be inspissated by a longer coction in our Officine: but of
Juleps, which should be but lightly cocted, and presently assumed, in this our
Book of Medicinal Receipts.

Now Julep is a Persian word, Julep quid.
signifying a sweet Potion, which the Greeks call (...); and they make it of
any distilled dulcorate water, as of Syrups of the juice or decoction of
Simples, elixated with Sugar or Honey to a more crass consistency.

Serapio, that he might eschew the insuavity of all odor and sapour, confected
a Julep, or rather Hydrosacharum, of Water and Sugar only, which he calls a
simple Syrup. Avicenna, to conciliate more suavity, adds thereto a third part
of Rose Water. Mesue takes not only water, but confects Juleps of juices,
infusions, and decoctions. And the vulgarity of men call all limpid dulcorate
Potions Julens, whether they be made of distilled waters only, or of the
decoction of a few sweet simples, and much water percolated, clarified, Julepus
zizyphorum.
and dulcorated; such as the Julep, or rather Syrup of Jujubs; for when it is
made of a hundred great Jujubs, and four pounds of water cocted to the half,
and one pound of sugar, it acquires a more crass consistency than a Julep; and
therefore when it comes to be used, it requires dilution in simple water
cocted, or in a Prisane, whereas a Julep is limnid enough of it self. And that
same Syrup, which from its frequent use there; derives its name from
Alexandria, Syrupus Alexandrinus.
is improperly called a Julep, since it is as much inspissiated by coction, and
as long kept as any Syrup.

Now the Julep of Roses is right made, when it consists of Rosewater, with half
as much Sugar cocted almost to the crassitude of a Syrup, or little less, if it
be presently to be assumed, as vulgar Juleps, Julepus rosatus qui fiat.
which are made for present use, of Sugar, or some Syrup, with thrice its
quantity of water: as,

. The water of Endive,. iij. Syrup of Limons,. j. mingle them.

Thus Juleps should be of a more liquid consistency, that they may be
percolated: but those that are longer cocted, or receive only a double
quantity of Water to their Sugar, as the syrup of Roses, Syrupus Rosareus
Rondeletii.
according to Rondeletius, or an equal weight of both, according to Sylvius;
are because of their crassitude scarce fluid, and admit not of percolation.

Therefore according to the different coction and quantity of Water to the
Sugar, it will be a Syrup, if both be equal; or a Julep, if three parts of
Water be put to one of Sugar, according to Loubertus.

Since Juleps are easy to make, I shall only describe one or two forms.

. of the waters of Fumatory and Wood sorrel, an.. ij. of Sugar,. j. boil them
on a gentie fire till one ounce be consumed; make it into a Julep for one dose.

An Hypnotical Julep to conciliate sleep, may be thus made:

. The water of Water lillyes,. ij. of Betony,. j. Syrup of Poppyes simple,. j.
drink it at the hour of sleep, which is at nine of the clock at night.

CHAP. V. Of distilled Restoratives.
ALL analeptical and restorative Medicaments, which refocillate the habit of
the body absumed by long disease or hunger, which are prescribed to resartiate
the vigor of the faculties weakened with languor, are not only taken from
medicinal, but alimental matter. For whereas they conduce partly to the
nutriment of the body, and partly to the cure of the part affected, it is
manifest by reason, that they should be endued with various qualities.

Now they are called distilled Medicaments, Distillata cur dicta.
because they are distilled drop by drop from an Alembick into a subjected
Vessel; and Restoratives, because they are extracted from nutritive flesh, from
Conserves, Cordial Powders, and all such things as either by their odor or
substance refresh the spirits, or roborate the principal parts.

Many disapprove of the custom of the ancients, who distilled the raw flesh of
Capons or Partridges, purged from their bones and fatness, together with the
powders and conserves: for seeing raw flesh is hardly concocted, and the
faculty of the powders easily, and dissipable, with what reason are these
mixed, especially seeing, that the water first distilling from the crude flesh,
corrupts soon; they seem to do better, that put the flesh half cocted and its
own juice, into the Alembick with the other materials.

Neither do we approve of their action, Catenarum aurcarum decoctio non utilis.
who coct golden chains together with the flesh, seeing nothing of them is
dissolved; nor yet extracted from them, save that filth they have contracted by
touching.

Their custom is more laudable, who cast filings of Gold into coction, as the
Apothecaryes of Paris use to do, who spare no cost, that they may confect their
restoratives and other compounds well.

This solemn and excellent distillation may be thus accomplished.

. Of the broth of one Capon, and 2. Partridge. lb. ij. of the waters of
Buglosse, Wood Sorrel and Water-Lillyes, of each as much as will suffice: of
the Conserve of violets, succory and roses, of each. ij. Pulveris Diamargariti
frigidi, Electuarii triasantali and diarrhodonis Abbatis an.. j. Troches of
Camphor.. ij. filings of Gold. j. ss. put them all into an Alembeck, and after
convenient maceration, let them be distilled according to Art.

The description of another distillation excellent against hot and malignant
fevers.

. Of the waters of Wood sorrel, Goates-beard, Carduus, Succory, of each. iiij.
Cock broth lb. j. Conserve of Water-Lillyes, Roses, of each. j. Treacle. ss. of
the powder of the roots of Angelico and Termentill, of each. ij. Dictamus. j.
Carduus and Citron-seeds, of each. ij. Sage and Orange flowers of each p. iij.
put all these into a still, and according to Art proceed to the distillation.

You may add to a portion of this same distillation, when you would use it
some fit liquor, as the juice of Lemmons or Orenges, with a little common
sugar, or conserve of Roses, if the sick desire it.

CHAP. VI. Of Decoction or Apozemes.
GErmany indeed (that I may a little decline from the rode) is happy, in that
it is not only a nursery of famous men, but a treasure also of precious things.
Yet as the frugiferous tree brings forth with fragrant Apples blasted
blossoms, and sometimes pestiferous fruits, so has she produced a very
Monster in nature, I mean that Pseudomedick Paracelsus, who professed the
Devil the Author of his Medicine, calling his characters and words, the
Devils Art; our syrups and decoctions, man's inventions; Herophilus the ancient
Philosopher denoted these, as also all Medicaments, with more sanctity, calling
them, the Auxiliatory hand of the Gods; which being endued with divine and
admirable faculties, are able to cure the diseased, and preserve the sound
body. Upon this account Heraclitus, famous also amongst Philosophers, was wont
to call sacrifices, Medicaments, because they like some praepotent Physic
purge the soul, as medicaments do the body. Cael. Rhod. cap. 2. lib. 12.

The Impostor said truly, when he called decoctions, man's medicaments, for
herewith the quality of the peccant humors is tempered, many pains eased, the
violence of the untimely guest death abated, the acerbity of the symptoms
mitigated, and the parts reduced to their native bonity and vigor; for they
are made of all kinds, but especially of alterative and roborative Medicaments;
wherein sometimes some benign purgative simples are infused in small quantity,
for it were absurd to call any blackish, ungrateful laxative decoction,
wherein much Senny, or half an ounce of some electuary, as Catholicum, or some
lenitive has been dissolved, an Apozeme: for (...) with the Greeks comes from
(...), to fervefy, Apozema quid, and unde dicatur.
or decoct; and an Apozeme is only used for the thin decoction of herbs.

Now the whole matter of Apozemes is from plants, of whose water juleps are
made, and of whose decoction, Apozems, and Syrups; amongst which there is this
difference, that juleps are tenuious, Apozematum materia. Julepi, syrupi, and
apozemata, quomodo differunt.
syrups crasser, and Apozemes in the mean, all dulcorated either with sugar or
honey, or both, and according to their different consistency, more or less
cocted.

The ancients used sweet water wherein they had cocted the leaves of some
plants, instead of Apozemes, as many now a days do the broth of green herbs
altered with some mixture: For the virtue of herbs is as well left in chickens
broth, by elixation, as in simple water, and these alterative broaths are both
cheaper, and more grateful than Apozemes: yet a sick man may use both,
receiving broth made of fit herbs by the Physicians advice, from a Cook that
knows nothing further than a pan or spit, and Apozemes prepared with prudence,
and industrious Artifice, from the Apothecary; not for nutriment as the broth,
but calefaction, frigefaction, humectation, siccation, apertion, or some such
mutation; and therefore sometimes roots or other parts of bitter, or insuave
herbs, are taken, purged, and cocted in a sufficient quantity of water, being
useful for that purpose; and an Apozeme made for many or few doses according
to the quantity of the decoction, our of the broth percolated; dulcorated with
sugar or honey, and if need be, aromatized with Sanders or Cinnamon:

These Apozemes are not only made in Summer, while herbs are fresh, but in
Winter also, when either none, or only arid ones can he had; though then
indeed the use of syrups is more frequent, which differ from Apozemes only in
coction, which should be more valid in syrups that are more crasse and durable,
than in Apozemes in Winter, and Apozemes to Syrups in Summer, whereby so that
syrups are Vicegerents to Apozemes it seems two names denote one thing: but in
Syrups a greater quantity of sugar is requisite, to wit the weight of the whole
decoction, in Apozemes various, as sometime, the third, sometimes the fourth
part of sugar or honey to the weight of the decoction: for it is sufficient, if
you put to every pound of the decoction one quadrant, that is three ounces of
sugar, or syrup, or at most a trient, that is four ounces, But when the sapour
of the liquour is very ungrateful, the weight of the sugar must be augmented,
and when the Apozeme is made, it must be despumed, and purged with the white of
eggs.

Apozemes are variously confected, according to their several purposes, An
opening Apozeme.
as to remove obstructions thus.

. The Roots of Asparagras, Butchers Broom, Saccory, Liquorish, Raisons stoned,
of each. ss. of the leaves of Maidenhaire, Agrimony, Pimpinell, Topps of Hopps,
Mugwort, of each m. ss. topps of Hysop p. ij. The three Cordial flowers, of
each p. j. Boil these in lb. ij. ss. of water, till half be cousumed, add to
the colature, Syrup of Maidenhaire or sugar. iiij. fiat Apozema for four doses.

Another to moderate and assuage the fervor of Choler, thus.

. Of the Roots of Succory, Wood-sorrell, Sorrel, of each. ss. Liquorish, An
Apozeme against choler.
Currands, of each. iij. Endive, Succory, Dandilyon, Wood-sorrell, Fumitory,
Lettice, Purslane, of each m. j. White Roses m. ss. or the three Cordial
flowers of each p. j. Boil them in a sufficient quantity of water, and in the
colature dissolve Syrup of the juice of Wood-sorrell, or Lemmons, or Sugar of
Roses. iiij. aromatize it with yellow Sanders. ss. for four doses.

CHAP. VII. Of Gargarismes.
GAROARISMES are instituted to the diseases and affections of the Mouth, Gumms,
Palate and throat, whose faculty, according to Celsus cap. 23. lib. 5. is
either levative, or repressive, or evocative. Cream or milk of Barley leviate;
water, wherein lentills, or roses, or black berryes, or quinces, or dates have
been cocted, represses. And Mustard, Pepper or such sharp Medicaments evoke.
But Gargarismes, in Actuarius his judgment ( Cap. 6. lib. 3. Method. Medend.)
should not be confected hereof without the admixtion of some sweet things,
least they should too much offend the gust.

For when the liquor hausted to the Gurgulio, is again revoked to wash the
whole concavity of the mouth; if it be too sharp, it will with its mordacity
offend the gustative organs. Therefore the sharp simples, whereof Gargarismes
are confected, are either mixed with Hydromel, or simple water, wherein the
syrup of Stecados, dry Roses, or other such sweet decoction has been dissolved
in such quantity, as to abate much of their acrimony, or amaritude.

To educe phlegm from the brain or jaws make a Gargarisme thus.

. Pellitory. ij. Cypress root, and Turbith, of each. iij. A Oargaris^^^ to
purge Phlegm from the Brain.
Elecampane,. j. Tops of Origanum, Hysop, and Sage, of each m. j. boil them in
a pint and half of water till a third part be consumed, in the colature mix
Oximel simplex,. iij. fiat Gargarisma, or thus.

. Liquorish, Carthamus seed an.. ss. Bay berryes, Stavesacre, of each. iij.
Mustard seed, white peper an.. ij. Galangal.. j. staechados, Betony an. m. ss.
boil them in Hydromel. pro Gargarizatu.

To roborate the mouth, and deterge its collutions make one thus. A cleanfing
Gargarism^.


. The leaves of the Prune tree, tops of Briars, Plantaine, Jewscare, red Roses
an. m. j. balaustians, tops of Mirtles, of each m. ss. Barley, Berberies, of
each. ss. boil them in two pintes of water, till half be consumed; to the
colature add the syrup of dried Roses, of mulherryes, of each. ij. mingle them.

This following Gargarisme conduces to the cure of the French disease in the
throat or other part of the mouth.

. Of Guaicum,. j. Sarsaperilla, Sasafras, A Gargarisme for an Ulcer in the
throat.
of each. ss. lignum Lentisci iij. boil them in two pintes of water, till a
third part be consumed, adding toward the end of the coction Liquorish. vi.
Roses Sage and Rosmary of each p. j. with the colature often wash the throat.

Gargarismes may be used at any time, especially in the morning and betwixt
meals, but they should be new continually; for by long keeping they corrupt,
and rather harm than heal the mouth.

CHAP. VIII. Of Emulsions.
AS one disease may be cured by many and different Medicaments, so may one
Medicament cure many, and different diseases, as the same called by the later
Medicks, an emulsion, which may be accomodated to many uses; for it conduces
much to the mitigating the griefs of the heart and lungs, to the conciliating
of sleep; to the refrigerating of immoderate heat; to the asswaging of the
Urines acrimony, and extinguishing the ardour of the reins. They therefore seem
much to be deceived, who think that emulsions serve to nothing, save the cure
of the virulent flux of the sperme; for in many things they may be used instead
of Apozems and Hordeates, when they are confected of brayed seeds, which
refrigerate, leniate, move urine, or conciliate sleep, upon which in the time
of contrition either a Ptisane, or decoction of such simples as conduce to that
purpose must be superfused; as when purged Almonds and Artichocks, with the
decoction of jujubs, and dry grapes are contunded for the asperity of the
jaws: the frigid seeds, with the decoction of Lettices, and of the flowers of
Water-Lillyes, for the heat of the bowels, and the same seeds with the
decoction of the roots of seeds of Althea, Liquorice and Figgs, for the
Acrimony of urine.

The quantity of the decoction must be augmented or diminished according to the
quantity of the seeds; an emulsion should neither be absolutely crasse, nor
absolutely liquid, but in a mean betwixt the consistency of Apozems and Syrups,
like the more limpid Amygdalates, which in color and sapour differ not much
from emulsions, but they are somewhat more crasse, as Hordeates are denser than
Amygdalates, Syrups than Hordeates, Eclegmes, than Syrups, and Electuaryes than
Eclegmes.

These are the best descriptions of Emulsions, for the diseases of the breast

CHAP. IX. Of Amygdalates.
ALmonds are either bitter, which are solely Medicinal, or sweet, which are
partly alimentall, partly Medicamentall. Of these, a certain potion is
confected, white as milk, which Physicians prescribe to feverish and pectorall
affections: for though Almonds, according to Paulus Aegyn. lib. 7. de re Med.
and Oribasius cap. 2. lib. 2. Synopseos, be moderately hot, or rather
temperate, yet being brayed and diluted in water, their fervor is abated, and
by a certain inciding and attenuating faculty purge the breast and bowels (
Actuar. cap. 7. de spirit. animal. nut.) now of their cremour may be made a
certain sorbicle, which does both nourish and lenify the asper Artery, and
facilitate the projection of such humors as are contained in the breast, which
is thus made.

. Of Almonds blanched ij. beat them in a stone mortar; and pour on lb ss. of
water, add vj. of sugar, boil them a little on the fire, and afterward let it
be given.

Some add to the mixture two or more grains, others refuse: How Am^gdalates
are made.
it may be administered at any time, especially to such as love not pottage or
broth, but it is most frequently given at the hour of sleep, and then you may
put to it a little of the seed of white Poppy or Lettice, especially if it be
prescribed to a sick man, that cannot sleep. Some bray Almonds with warm
water, and so by the addition of a little sugar make it up without fire, and so
give it. But its better to bray them with lukewarm water, and afterward
elixate them after the usual manner; the quantity of sugar should be augmented
or diminished as the condition of the affection requires, for as sweet things
are bechicall, and most accommodate to the affections of the breast and Lungs,
so by how much the Amygdalate is more obdulcorated with sugar, by so much it is
more convenient to them; by how much its less obdulcorated, by so much fitter
for the feverish.

This sweet potion is very common at Lutetia, Amygdalata Luteti^e usitatissima.
in so much that the very women make of it daily, so that their Medicks never
describe any receipt, but bids the Apothecary make an amygdalate, leaving the
materials to his arbitration. A greater quantity, both of sugar and Almonds
must be put in the confection that's made for such as love solids, less of each
and more of water, for such as love liquids.

CHAP. X. Of the Ancients Ptisane or Hordeate.
THe vulgar Ptisane is a potion made of Liquorice-water, and a little barley,
and often without: the Ancients Ptisane is a meat made of select barley,
decortticated with grinding, and water, hence Ptisana from (...), that is to
grind and decorticate, Hordeati praeparatio.
by Galens advice ( cap. 2. lib. de Ptisana) the barley should be fat, partaker
of no adventitious quality, neither too new; nor too old, nor yet wrinckled,
which Barley thus selected must be macerated in water, then brayed in a mortar,
that the exterior shell, and all glumosity may be excussed, then rubbed with
ones hands, washed, and purged from the bran, then dried and kept; and when use
calls for it, then must a part of it be cocted in twelve times as much water on
a slow fire, till it swell to the height, depose all flatuosity, Antiquorum
Ptisana.
and become a smooth, continual, equal, and lubricall juice: thus the
Ancients at first cocted their Ptisane, and exhibited it to the sick: yet some
of them mixed with it boiled wine or honey, or cummin, and others a little oil,
vinegar and salt, but we being more delicate, add none of these, but only
sugar, and sometimes a few Almonds, and as we retain not the mixture of the
Ancients, so neither do we keep the name, calling that a hordeate, which
Hippocrates and Galen called a Ptisane, and its thus made at Lutetia.

. The best Barley well purified ij. boil it upon a gentle fire in clear
water, till the barley begins to swell, pour off the water, and let fresh be
poured on, then boil it upon a clear fire for four or five hours, afterward
strain it; add to the colature vj. of sugar, afterward boil it again, and
so make use of it.

For thus your Hordeate will be more crasse and nutritive, in Italy they do not
boil it after colature, and it is more liquid, and more greedily assumed by
some patients, but it nourishes not so much, and therefore is assumed not only
once a day about the hour of sleep, but twice, or thrice like a julep.

And seeing barley however prepared cannot be made to calify, but is always
cold according to Galen ( com. ad part. 30. lib. 1. de vict. acut. cap: 16.
lib. 1. de aliment.) a Ptisane made of these two is both good Medicament and
aliment for the feverish, for it both nourishes and cures, and in nourishing
supplies the place both of meat and drink, and operates like Alita and Rice. (
Gal. lib. 1. de alimen. lib. 1. de vict. acut. cap. 237. libr. de simpl.
medicament.)

CHAP. XI. Of Lohoch or Eclegms made for present use.
WE have spoken at large of Eclegmes in general, now we come to treat of those
in special, which must be made and exhibited presently, being not conservative
without alteration, because in two or three days they rise so much through
fermentation, that they cannot be kept within their potts, unless they be
agitated with a spatula or liquorice stick; for so the sugar is more accurately
mixed with the liquor, and the mixture settles more easily, and may be more
securely kept. Now Lohochs are prescribed for various effects, according to the
various matter, Eclegmatum usus.
and qualities of the Medicaments whereof they consist, which if they be sweet
and grateful to the palate, leniate the asper artery, concoct the humors,
move and educe spittle: if dulcoacid incide, attenuate, and prepare viscous and
crasse Phlegm; if dulcoamare deterge, coct and expurgate. But because
amaritude very much offends the guste, bitter things, save in small quantity,
never ingrede this confecture, for it is always almost compounded of sweet
things, as Liquorice juice, Jujubs, Pine Apple, Sugar Candy, Penidis, Electuary
of d^aireos, or diatragacanthum, or such like confections pulverated, and
subacted with honey, some fit syrup, or both.

A lohoc thus confected conduces to the incision and attenuation of crasse
humors.

. Electuarii diaireos simplicis, j. sugar candy. ss. Loboch incidens.
Annis condited ii. syrup of Hysop, and oxtmell simplex, of each. i. ss. mix
them well together, which you may use often, either fasting in the morning, or
betwixt meals, upon a Liquorish stick.

To coct and expectorate humors, the frequent use of this following lohoch
does much conduce.

. Diatragacanthi frigid.. vi. diair is Solomonis, Alphenici, A Lohoch to cause
Concoction.
of each ss. with the syrup of Liquorish, or Maidenhaire, make it into a Lohoch.

This Eclegme following stops Rheums falling upon the lungs.

. Penides, Diatrag. frigid. of each. ss. sugar of Roses, vi. To stay a Catarh.
Terrae Lemniae ii. with the syrup of Poppyes, make it into a Linctus.

This cures eroding fluxions, and the distempers of the Lungs, or at least
reduces them to a better state.

. Manus Christi perlatae. j. Ter. Sigill. pulv. Diatragan. frigid. of each j.
red coral ss. Lapis Haemath.. j. with syrup of Balm, make it into a Lohoch.

CHAP. XII. Of Apophlegmatismes.
THE head aggravated with excrementitious humors, especially with phlegm,
may, be emptied with many kinds of Medicaments, but none can effect this
without the molestation of other parts; for phlegmagogous potions or pills,
while they educe Phlegm from the brain, do importunately molest the ventricle
and members adjoining, and by moving the belly cause grievous pains, and very
often excite heart aches and swounings; Apophlegmatismorum utilitas.
but Apophlegmatismes, being endued with a sapour not so ungrateful, affects
the concavity of the mouth more gently, atracting abundance of Phlegm through
the emissaryes of the palate from the brain, which may be easily excluded by
frequent sputation. Now all simples, whereon Apophlegmatismes consist, are hot,
and often endued with acrimony, whereby they do not only attenuate, incide,
and attract the cold humor, but also excite the expulsive faculty to its work.

These things project Phlegm, Mastick chewed, or made into a gargarisme, sage,
stavesacre, thyme, penny-royall, carthamus, pepper, mustard, bartram, ginger,
acorus, the roots of deluce, and Cyperus, whereof some cut into small pieces
are masticated and grinded with the teeth, or pulverated, and put into some
convenient liquour, and so formed into pills or trochiskes; or obvolved in some
thin cloth, and made up like a knot: or elixated, and their decoction
percolated and kept in ones mouth, like a gargarisme.

Their more usual form is solid, that they may be longer detained in the
mouth, and masticated whence a masticatory is used for an Apophlegmatisme and
an apothegmatisme for a masticatory: the head must decline while the Medicament
is masticated or chewed, and the lips be open, that the humor attracted and
congested may have more free and speedy passage.

Many forms or receipts of this Medicament might be described, but that I may
not be tedious, one or two shall serve: as,

. Staves-acre iij. mastich ij. cubebs j. pellitory ss. make of these a fine
powder, and with syrup or juice of damasks roses make them into little troches,
or thus:

. The roots of orris ij. long pepper, mustard seed, pellitory, Agaricke, of
each j. stavesacre i ss. beat these into a very fine powder, and with the best
honey make them up into the form of pills globular: and roll them up in
sarsnet, which at the time you would use them, hold in your mouth, till Rheum
distills.

CHAP. XIII. Of a Purging bolus.
SUch as nauscate and abhor liquid purgations, and cannot receive pills,
because of their insuavity, or the squalour of their ingredients; stand in need
of a Medicament which is of a middle consistency betwixt a potion and a pill;
which antiquity has named a Bolus, for so that is called, which is taken by
pieces or morsells, as the vulgar term it; Bolus quid.
so that a Bolus is a piece of a purgative Medicament of the consistency of an
opiate, fit for ingestion, and of such crassitude, as it may be easily
swallowed whole, some of the Latins call it Buccea.

It may be made of any kind of purgative, Ejus materia.
except such as by their insuavity move loathing and abhorrence, or such whose
malignity cannot be castigated, nor yet their substance be assumed.

Sometimes alteratives, and Aromaticall simples are mixed therewith to correct
the effcrous nature of the purgatives, or to conciliate a more grateful odor,
and sapour, or to help to the roboration of some part, but yet in small
quantity, least the bulk of the bolus swell too much, which the sick do much
abhor, Delicatuli purgantia aversantur.
for many are moved at the first taste of a Medicament, are angry at the
second, and mad at the third.

The manner of the boles confection is most simple, as being often made of
nothing but Cassia alone; for this is the basis of boles, as Aloes is of pilis;
the use of boles as it is frequent, so it is wholesome in hot weather.

. Of the Pulpe of Cassia newly extracted j ss. A Laxative and cooling Bolus.
powder of yellow Sanders j. mix them well together, and with syrup of violets,
make it into a Bolus, which take upon the point of a knife, drinking broth
after it.

Rhabarb or some scamoniall Medicine is often added to Cassia, as to the
deduction of choler, thus:

. Ext. Cassiae j. diapruni solutivi ij. powder of liquorish j. make it up into
a bole with sugar, or syrup of succory.

But because Cassia by its flatuosity often causes dolours in the belly, which by
its molestation brings swounings to the delicate, its quantity should be small,
that it might be extracted with the other vapors, or something mixed with it,
that might discuss its wind.

. Pulp of Cassia, extracted with the decoction of Aniseseeds vi. the Electuary
of the juice of Roses. ii. Rhabarb ss. with sugar, make it into a bole.

If Cassia be wanting, Boli non semper cassiam habent pro basi.
yet boles may be confected, for they be made of the Pulpe of prunes,
tamarinds, Raisons, and many Electuaries; for of these and many other purgative
Medicaments, as well simples, as compounds, may be made laxative opiats, which
may be taken fasting in the form of a bole.

CHAP. XIV. Of Opiates.
WE have abundantly discoursed before. cap. 13. lib. 3. of oplates in general,
and we hold it superfluous to speak the same things over again, therefore we
shall now only describe some receipts of particular opiats, after which
paradigme it will not be difficult to confect others.

Now opiates, Opiarum usus.
are not prescribed solely to conciliate sleep (though they derive their
denomination from Opium) but to purge, roborate, or other wayto alter, as other
liquid Electuaryes, in which order they may justly be ranked, as partaking of
the same consistency and manner of composition.

Their materials are powders put into honey, Uateria.
or a syrup, and sometimes into sweet wine, and accurately subacted with a
pestell, wherewith some conserves, or other cordial or cephalicall confectures
have been compounded, such as roborate the heart, and conserve and exhilarate
the integrity of the vital faculties. An opiate may be confected for the
richer sort thus.

. Of the conserves of the flowers of Bugloss and Borage, of each iii. Conserve
of marigolds, Citron pill condited, of each i. confecti^ Alkermes, de
Hyacintho, of each i. spec. de gemmis, diamarg. frigid. Laetitiae Gal. of each
j. East Bezoar, and Monncerves horn of each. ss. and with ii. of the syrup of
preserved mirabolans, or Lemons, fiat opiata

The sequel receipt confers much to the roboration of the brain, and the
recreation of the drowsy vital faculties.

. Conserves of Betony vi. of Roses ss. Confectio Alkermes, iiii. spec. dianthos
ii. diamarg. frigid. dianisi, diamosch. dull. an. i. with syrup of Staechados
fiat Opiata.

Let this be assumed by such whose ventricle languishes through frigidity, or
humidity, and imbecility of the digestive faculty.

. Old conserve of Roses ss. of Rosemary flowers ii. candid Nutmeg i. spec.
aromat. Rosat ii. diacinamomi i. Diambrae. ss. Syrup of mint or Julep of Roses,
as much as will suffice to make it up into an opiate, of which take i. at a
dose.

This for the poorer sort.

. Conserve of Roses j. Enulacampane condited. j. ss. the best Bole washed in
Carduus water ss. with the syrup of Wood-sorrell, make into an opiate.

CHAP. XV. Of Condites.
FOr the commodity of those parts, which hold the principality in natures
economy, a certain mixture is invented, more pleasant than opiates, which the
later Medicks call a condite.

It consists of conserves, cordial powders and sugar, The matter of Condites.
mixed in an unequal quantity; for to the confection of a Granulatum, there is
required more conserves, less powder, and far more sugar than to an opiate,
and the conditure is often overspread with lea^ gold, that it may be more
grateful to the eyes, and more potent in its qualities. For it is confected of
all kinds of cordialls, save those that are disgustfull. For since it should be
frequently used by those, to whom it is accommodated, to wit by macilent
languishing, and such persons as are beginning to recover their healths, it
should partake of very little or no insuavity.

A condite to refartiate lost strength may be thus made.

. Citron pill condited ij. Conserve of Buglosse and Roses, A cordial Condite.
of each. ss. spec. de gemmis, diambrae, diamarg. frigidi an. j. the bone in
the heart of a Heart,. ss. Unicornes horn, Bezoar stone, of each gr. vj. Leaves
of gold nu vj. sugar of Roses, the treble quantity of the whole, or as much as
will suffice to make it a condited Cranulate.

This following condite may with success be exhibited of such, whose ventricle
through imbecility naufeares, and ejects all esculents and potulents presently
after their assumption.

. Old Conserve of Roses vj. of the greater Comfrey ij. pulveris diarhod. Abatis
ii. burnt Ivory, red Coral, of each i. the sugar of Roses, three times the
weight of the whole, or as much as will suffice to make it a Condite, of which
take fasting in the morning and before every meal i.

CHAP. XVI. Of the regal paste.
THe regal paste and opiates have so much affinity each with other,
Differentia inter pastam regiam and opiatas.
consisting both almost of the same ingredients, that according to Rondeletius,
the only distinction is that the regal paste is more dry than an opiate, and
more humid than an electuary, or rather more solid than both: for the
consistency of an opiate, and an electuary differ so little, that they may be
easily thought the same; but however it be to an opiate, it is not mazapane as
Gorraeus is of opinion, but a certain confection so called by the more recent,
Electuarium regium.
and by Mesue the regal electuary; for because of its princely, that is;
eximious faculty it has against expectoration and other pectorall affectious,
it acquired that name.

It consists of conserves, pulpes, syrups, and powders prepared and subacted
with such industry, that out of the mixture results a tractible mass like
paste, whereof boles or other small sweet breads are confected, from whence it
derives its denomination, which dry so by little and a little, that when they
come to be used they do not commaculate the fingers of the assumer with their
lentour, and these pastes are thus confected.

. Blanched Almonds, Pistakes, Pine-kernells, of each ss. Pulp of Jujubees,
Dates, Damask prunes; of each iii. Gum Thraganth i. Starch ss. and with as
much sugar of Roses as will suffice to make it up into a paste.

Rondeletius prescribes a paste thus described for to move spittle.

. Conserve of Maidenhaire, and Bugloss, of each ss. Pull. Diatrag. frigid.
Diaireos simp. of each ii. Penniddees, Sugar Candy, of each; ii. and with a
little Syrup of Liquorish, or as much as will suffice to make it up into a
paste: but know, that if you put a little too much syrup to it, you will make
its consistence more liquid, and so instead of paste make an opiate.

CHAP. XVII. Of Mazapane.
MAzapane or Marchypane is a confection so named by the more recent, which is a
most frequent junket, for it is most grateful to the gust, and nourishes very
much, wherefore it is prescribed to the macilent, and such persons, as are
vexed with any preternaturall affection in the breast or Lungs.

Many bechicall and sweet ingredients go to this confection, as sugar,
pistack-nutts, pine-kernells, and other sweet fruits, which brayed, and
accurately subacted with simple, or rose water, become a mass, whereof wafers
or morsells, Marcipanis quibus constet.
(as Rondelet calls them) are concinnated, which are gently cocted in an Oven,
till of red they become yellow, and acquire a competent hardness.

The vulgar manner of this confecture with the dulciaryes is most simple, as
being made only of Almonds, rose water and sugar.

But Apothecaries by a Physicians advice, add something to these which has
respect to some one part, which tempers some noxious humor, and by its
nutritive, as well as Medicinal faculty, preserves as well as resartiates
sanity.

The most usual and pleasant confection of Mazapane is this.

. Sweet Almonds decorticated, iij. Pistakes j. Marcipanis optimus.
bruise them very well in a mortar, with a little Rose Water, add thereunto)
the finest sugar lb ss. fiat pasta, which you may make into what form you
please.

Marchepane after this manner is usual also (and very accomodate) to expel
flatuosity.

. Pistakes j. blanched Almonds ij. Anifeseed i. Cinnamon i. after they are
finely beaten add of the finest loaf sugar, four ounces, and so make it up
into a paste, which if by too much water it be too liquid, let it fervefy in a
basin, on a slow fire till it be more crasse, then make Marchpane, which dry a
little in the Oven after bread has been extracted.

Those little long masses of bread which are confected of flower and thrice or
four times as much sugar, with a little Coriander, Panis biscoctus.
and a small portion of eggs subacted together, may by some affinity be
referred hither, which they commonly call Biskakes: But I would not put my
sickle into another man's harvest therefore I will leave these sweet breads to
the confectioners.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Piniolates or Pignolates.
ANother kind of paste is made almost after the same manner, which the
Neotericks call Piniolate or Pignolate, because its made of Pine kernells,
cleansed and immerged in melted sugar, and cocted to the consistency of condite
sugar.

But that the Pine kernells may depose all their rancour, they should be
macerated a whole day or half at least in water, and Rosewater should be dropped
into the confection, for so it will be more grateful to the gust, as also to
the smell, if a grain of Musk be mixed therewith, as we see in many junketts
which are set at the head of the table, the most usual form of confecting
pineolates, is this.

. Of the finest sugar dissolved and cocted in Rose water, till it be about the
consistency of an Electuary lb ss. mingle with ii. of Pine kernells infused in
water for the space of twelve hours, afterward; stir them together with a
spatula, that the whole mass may be subigated, in the end add mosch i. and so
make a paste, whereof you may make Cylinders which repose and exsiccate on a
paper, that they may grew harder.

CHAP. XIX. Of Pandalea.
THere is another kind of solid paste called Pandaleon, which is by Rondeletius
prescribed to the affections of the breast and lungs, for it consists of many
things that attenuate, and coct viscid humors, and move expectoration, and all
Pandaleas seem to be bechicall, nothing differing from pectorall Ecclegmes and
syrups, save in consistency, nor from solid Electuaryes save in external
form: for they are compounded, made and cocted after the same manner, only
solid Electuaries are harder, and are rolled out into quadrate or long figures;
and Pandaleas are kept whole in a wooden box, as conserves in a glass or
earthen vessel, and when use calls for them, they are cut with a spoon or
knife, and a piece thereof given, to be retained in the mouth like so much
Alphenix, or bechicall Tablets, that it may melt, and go down like a lohoch. It
has the same consistency, and is kept in the like vessels as those same
sugared confections or comfitures, usual, and frequent in Spain, which they
call Marmelades.

They are made commonly of some sweet powder and sugar perfectly concocted in
some convenient water, that they may concrete.

Some conserves are sometimes added, and a little honey, if need require, and
such a Pandalcon, how ever displeasing it may be to some men's palate; is very
good, and is thus confected.

. Pull: Diaireos Salomonis. i. diatrag. frigid. ii. powder of yellow Sanders i.
sugar dissolved in Coltsfoot-water iiij. fiat Pandaleon, which keep in Marmalet
Boxes.

Some also make a Pandalcon of Pine kernells, or Almonds decorticated and
brayed, with sugar or honey; thus.

. Pine kernells well cleansed and bruised i. Penidees. ss. clarified honey, as
much as will suffice to make it up into a sollid paste, or Pandalcon.

CHAP. XX. Of Hypoglottidian Medicaments commonly called sublingues.
THe cough and stinch of breadth molest all that are near us, seeing the cough
affronts their ears, and the stinch their noses; now certain bechicall and
Aromaticall pastilles will cure both affections, which from their round and
long form, which Apothecaries put them in, and that same quality which is
predominant in them, whereby they expectorate the humor, causing coughing are
called bechicall, from the manner of their use Hypoglottidian, and from the
odor which they acquire by Mosche, Moschardine Medicaments,

They are very pleasant which are thus confected.

. Of the finest sugar j. ss. Penidees ss. orris ss. yellow Sanders, Cinnamon, of
each i. mosch ss. with musiladg of Gum Thragants made in Rose water, make them
up into a paste, of which form any figure, long, round, or what will lie most
conveniently under the tongue.

The description is both easy and good.

. Sugar of Roses, ii. sugar Candy i. starch i. spec. diacinamon, diamisi, and
orris, of each i. mace ss. Zivet gr. vi. with the musiladge of Gum Thraganth,
made in Balm water, fiant Hypoglottides.

CHAP. XXI. Of Tables, or Tabuletts:
TAbells pertain to solid Electuaries, yea, they are very Electuaryes, being
confected of powders and sugar perfectly cocted, that their consistency may be
harder, and they longer and more securely preserved without damage and
impairement.

The like quantity of sugar is required in confecting tables, Sacchari
quantitas in tabellis.
as of honey in liquid electuaries, and in both the quantity is augmented or
subtracted, as the validity or imbecility of the Electuaries faculty requires.

In purgative tables one dragm of powder must be put to an ounce of sugar,
duly cocted in water or other convenient liquour, Portio Sacchari in tabellis
purgantibus.
in roborative tables, that they may be more grateful to the palate more sugar
is requisite, as two ounces of sugar to every dragm of powder.

I shall only hint here a little of tables in this book, since I have ( Cap.
11. lib. 3.) at large discoursed, not only of liquid Electuaryes, but solid
also, and tabells, in the description of such Medicaments as may be long
preserved.

Yet that I may suggest the forms of all Medicaments to him that would confect
them, I will add some few receipts of roborative tabells: as,

. Cordial Tabulets.
Spec. Elect. diamarg. frigid. de Gemmis ana ss. powder of the bone in the
heart of a Heart ss. Spodium i. with sugar dissolved in Rose water iii. make
them into Tabulets, of i. or ii. weight, take one of them every morning fasting.

Such as are rich, and begin to recover from some long disease, or are any way
troubled with palpitations and swoundings, let them get these tabells confected.

. Pull. Aureae Alexandrinae ss. diacinam. hyacinthor. smaragdor. pearl, finely
powdered, of each i. Monoceros horn, and Bezoar stone, of each ss. with sugar
dissolved in Rose water iiii. make them into little Tabuletts.

Those tabells they call Manus Christi are reducible to this head, which are
nothing else but Sacharum rosatum, either simple as the common, or more
compound, which admitts of Pearls in its confection, and is called Manus
Christi perlata; which is thus confected.

. Manus Christi perlata.
Of the whitest sugar dissolved in Rose water, and cocted, till above the
consistency of a syrup ii. pearl finely powdered i. fiant Tabella.

CHAP. XXII. Of Powders.
BEsides those powders kept in shops for future uses, whereof we have spoken
elsewhere; there many others, which are made for present use, as the digestive
powder which helps the frigidity of the ventricle, Pulvis digestivus.
and the imbecility of the coctive faculty, being confected of such Medicaments
as are stomachicall, roborative, help concoction, and dispell flatuosity, and
it is thus made.

. The seeds of Dill, and Coriander prepared of each ii. Orange pill Condited i
ss. Pulvis flatus discutiens.
Cinnamon i. Mace, Cloves, of each ss. sugard Candy ii. or iii. make of these a
powder.

Another Powder also of eximious power and virtue, to roborate the ventricle
and parts addicted to sanguification, and dissipate flatuosity, is thus
confected.

. The seeds of sweet Fennel, and Coriander Condited, of each i ss. Squinant,
Calomus aromatic. an. ss. Dianisi, Diamargar. frigid, and Diacinamon, of each
i. A crust of Bread well toasted. ii. sugar ii. make them into a powder.

Cordial and Alexiteriall powders, that roborate the principal parts and
faculties in malignant fevers may be thus confected.

. The roots of Angelico, Tormentill, of each ss. A Cordial Powder.
Ligni Aloes i. Citron seeds and Cinnamon, of each ss. the bone in the heart of
a Heart, burnt Ivory, the best pearl, of each i. Monoceros horn, Bezoar stone,
of each ss. Dictamus ss. sugar of Roses i ss. make of them a powder which must
be taken fasting, or long after meat with the water of Scordium or Carduus, or
some distilled restrative, or other convenient liquor.

There are also topicall powders, which are applied to solidate wounds, and
implete ulcers with flesh, of which in their place.

THE SECOND SECTION, Of such as are either ingested or injected.
CHAP. I. Of Errhins.
ALL Medicaments are either assumed, ingested, or applied: Juleps, Apozemes,
Syrups, and all such as enter only at the mouth, whereof we have before
treated, are assumed: Errhins, Suppositories, and Clysters, are ingested:
Unguents Salves, Fomentations, and many more, whereof we shall now treat in
order, are applied, we begin with such as ingrede the body, but not at the
mouth, but the nose, privy parts, or fundament: and have their egresse where
they made their ingresse.

Those which are immitted at the nose are thence called Errhins, and vulgarly
Nasalia; those which are exhibited at the nose to purge the head are thence
commonly called caputpurgia by the suffrage of Chyrurgicall Medicks.

They are constituted of Medicaments endued with a sharp and exterging faculty,
whereby the expulsive faculty, being more validly excited, moves and expells
the humor lodged in the brain; such as be the qualities of Beat, Sow-bread,
wild Cucumber, and the juice of Marjoram, as also the powder of Euphorbium,
Hellebore and Pepper; and of such like sharp Medicaments which snuffed up the
nostrills, move sternutation, and purge the brain; some also consist of
astrictive and agglutinative Medicaments, as those which are prescribed to stay
a bloody flux.

They are given in diverse forms, either liquid, which must be attracted by the
nose, or solid, which must be ingested into the nostrills, or pulverall, which
must be snuffed up.

A liquid Errhin is thus confected.

. A l'quid Errhine.
Of the juice of the root of Beet, and the leaves of majoran, of each i. of the
juice of Brank ursine and Sow-bread, of each ss. fiat Errhinum: let a portion
of it, as ss. be attracted in the morning up your nose again and again, still
keeping water in your mouth, least the Errhin from the nose flowinto your mouth.

Some are given in form of an unguent, which they daub on the interior part
of the nostrills, and they are good for such as are troubled with continual
headache, with bad eyes, Epilepsy, and dullness of smell, their bodies bring
first duly purged, and they are made thus.

. Of wild Cucumber, Pellitory, of each j. white Pepper, An Erhine in the form
of an Unguent,
Carpesium, or Cubebs, and stavesacre, of each ss. with a little oil of orris
and wax make it up into a liniment.

A solid Errhine to stay the bleeding of ones nose is thus made.

. Bole-Armenick, Draggons blood, of each j. Roses. Balaustians. of each ss. and
with a little whites of eggs well beaten, make them up into the Consistency of
a sollid Errhin, or immerge therein a little Hares down, or cotton; and make it
like a tent, to be put up the nose in a pyramidall form, to which annexe a
thread that you may extract it at your pleasure.

Ptarmicall or neezing powder, when its used for Errhins is thus described.

. Hellibor. both white and black, of each i. Euphorbium ss. dried orris ss.
make of these a very fine powder, let a small portion thereof be snuffed up the
nose, after a convenient Catharticke.

CHAP. II. Of Pessi or Pessaries.
BY the name Pessus or Pessarium we understand all those suppositoryes which
are immitted into the privy parts which are by Hyppoerates called (...), as
unguents, plasters, roots; or bruised herbs, and penicills, but here they are
taken for a long Medicament, equalizing or exceeding the length and thickness
of a finger, which is intermitted into women's naturalls; with a thread bound to
it, that being so far intruded, it may be more commodiously extracted.

A Pessaryes form should be pyramidall, smooth, round, Pessorum forma.
and equal least it hurt the neck of the uterus; now there ought to be two or
more of unequal magnitude in readiness, that a more tenuious one may be first
immitted, the more crasse afterward: that it may go up more easily.

There are two sorts of Pessaryes, one made of some solid matter, as Lead, or
Tin, like a pyramidall tent, which serves to open, reserate and dilate the
narrow, obstructed and shut uterus: another of other Medicinal matter, which
is convenient to attenuate, or incrassate, to move or stench blood: but they
are made for the most part of aromaticall Medicaments; when they are prescribed
to move monthly flowers, Aromata recream uterum.
or abate the symptom of the Hystericall suffocation ( Aphor. 28. lib. 5. Lib.
de moth. mul. Hipp.) for Aromaticks do very much recreate the uterus, but by a
benign and aeriall vapor, which deducing the orifice of the vessels, freet
them from obstructions, and thereupon incites the flowr of the terms; but
such ingredients may not be too sharp, least they exulcerate the mouth and neck
of the uterus, seeing the Pessary must abide a pretty while in this case.

Before the intromission of the Pessary, the orifice of the uterus must be
anointed with some odoriferous unguent, as oil with musk in it, liquidambar, or
some such thing wherein Musk and Civet are compounded, of which and a little
wax are confected unguents wherewith Virgins naturalls are anointed: for Virgin
modesty admitts not of pessaryes, which cannot be intromitted, till the Virgin
Zone be loosed.

And therefore the matter of pessaryes is reduced to the form of an Unguent
wherein smooth lint, or Cotton is immerged, and a pessary of a just longitude
formed thereof, by involution in a thin linen cloth, to which a thread is
fastened, for the abovesaid reason.

A pessary to move monthly flowers.

. Roman gith.
Nigell. Roman, Bay-berryes, of each ss. Mirrh j. Savin, Dictamus, A pessary to
draw down the Terms.
of each ij. spec. Hierae Picrae. ij. Castor j. and with oil of Spicknard, and
a little wax, make it up into a liniment, into which dip some lint, and roll it
up into a pessary: anointing the outside with oil of Almonds.

All pessaryes are not obvolved, but some like suppositoryes formed of
materials redacted to a solid consistency, which are of the length of a man's
yard, as this same to stay monthly flowers.

. Bole-armeniake, Dragons blood, of which ij. powder of myrtle berryes,
Pomgranat flowers, Roses, Hypocistides, of each i. Unguentum Comitissae j. Let
these be mixed together upon a gentle fire; make thereof a pessary of a
Pyramidall form, of a just bigness.

CHAP. III. Of Nudils or Penicils.
THe condition and nature of some parts are such, that they cannot endure every
Medicament, as being either too heavy or too hard for them; hence it is that
Emplaisters are sometimes relinquished, though otherwise they were most proper
for the cure, merely because they may not be tolerated: as we see in a
fundament exasperated with swellings, caused by inflammation, or with clifts by
cold, and the external orifice of a woman's privity ulcerated, to which we
neither apply suppositoryes nor pessaryes, but soft peniscills, which are
improperly called noduls, which name Apophlegmatismes may more properly
arrogate to themselves.

For Penicills are not made into knotts, nor yet are they hard, but very soft,
as consisting only of cotton or wool, immerged in some convenient unguent;
that so they may be easily admitted and endured by the parts affected, as we
see in curing wounds, betwixt whose sides two or more penicills are reposed.

But they are for the most part adhibited to the womb, and external part of
the privityes, the condition of which parts when ulcerated cannot tolerate
other remedies, and they are constituted of diverse matters according to the
different affections for which they are made, as to assuage the dolor of the
fundament, which is ulcerated by some acid humor. This penicill,

. Ung. refriger. Galeni ss. Ung. Nutrit. ij. Penicillus Anodynus.
with half the yolk of an Egg make it up into a liniment, in which Immerge a
little wool, and apply it to the place affected.

To deterge some fordid Ulcer this penicill is useful.

. A syrup of wormwood, Honey of Roses, of each j. mirrh, Alius detergens.
aloes, of each ss. and with a little wool make it into little penicills.

A bolster of wool or cotton imbued in Unguento de Apio will effect the same,
if adhibited to the place.

This penicill will desiccate an ulcer.

. Ung. Albi ss. desiccativi rubri, Diapompholigos, of each ij. mingle them; and
with some linte make Penicills, which apply to the Ulcer.

CHAP. IV. Of Suppositoryes.
THE torpour of the belly causes great confusion in the humors, and propagates
an immense troop of diseases, which that they may be avoided; the slow belly
must be either lubricated with humectative aliments, or scowred with Clysters,
or moved with suppositories; that it may every day depose the excrements of the
precedent day; Ventris segnities naturam male lacessit.
For by the cohibition of these dreggs, the exclusion not responding the
assumption, vapors ascend to the head, the body ingravidates, concoction and
all other functions are impaired.

Such then, as through shamefulness, will not denudate their fundament to the
Apothecary, that he may move their bellyes with a Clyster, may exhibit this
kind of Medicament, called a suppository a supponendo, which they may
themselves easily repose in their fundament.

This subdititious Medicament did in times past bear the form of an acorn,
Glans subdititia.
whence it was called Glans, but now it is made longer, equalizing in longitude
a finger or pessary.

Suppositoryes are very useful; for when the expulsive faculty is dull, and
cannot exclude the excrements in their due time, or when the rectum intestinum
is so stuffed with obdurate dreggs, that it can either not admit of, or else
not egest a glister, then must the faculty be stimulated with a sharp
suppository, as with a needle.

These subdititious Medicaments conduce much to the enecation of small worms,
as also to such affections as require laxativenesse, and yet may not be moved
by glisters, as in the disease of bursting, and in the inversion of the rectum
intestinum by too much humidity.

Their basis is honey, Suppositorii basis.
of which alone cocted to that craffitude and consistency, as it will not
inquinate ones singers, they may be, and are often confected, for honey
consisting of tenuious parts must needs have some acrimony in it, which may
provoke the belly to excretion ( Galen. cap. 38. lib. 3. de aliment.)

Common salt, or the powder of sal Gemme or Hiera, or other simple, or compound
is sometimes added to honey.

This is the common suppository wherewith the excretive faculty is excited to
its work.

. An usual suppository.
Honey ij. common salt ij. or sal. Gem. iiij. boil then on a gentle fire, in a
little pipkin, to aperfect consistency, and make a suppository of the longitude
of a finger. For one cannot coct so little honey, as to make up one suppository
with honey alone, least so little quantity, as would serve one glans, be
burned, or cause the ignition of the vessel before it can acquire a tractable
consistency.

This suppository is very good to kill the worms of the fundament, and educe
that phlegm whereon they feed.

. Another for the worms,
Aloes i ss. Agaricke, Wormwood, of each j. sal. Gemm. ss. make of chese a
powder, to which add honey boiled to a consistency ij. and according to art
roll them up into suppositories. Let them be immerged in the oil of bitter
Almonds, or of Wormwood, or in the gall of an Ox, till use calls for them.

For Infants they cut a piece of white soap, like an acorn, which they immit,
or sometimes the stalk of a Beat, or Mercury dawbed with butter instead of a
suppository; for all these gently exonerate the belly.

CHAP. V. Of Glysters, or Enemata.
GLyster, or Clysmus, is a word borrowed from the Greeks, signifying ablution,
as Enema injection; and both are used for the same thing: for ablution cannot
be in the belly, but by injection of some thing, which by the fundament is
immitted to the intestines to excite the excretive faculty to mollify the
bardness of the belly, to alter the intemperature, to ease the dolor, to
discuss the flatuosity, to cohibit the fluour, and kill and expel the worms in
the intestines.

Glysters are instituted for many more effects also; The commodities that ensue
Glysters
for no part in the body almost, but it receives solace from them, ( Com. ad
Aph. 17. lib. 18.) if dolor possess the head, if lippitude the eyes, if
strangulation the jaws, if suffocation the breast, if inflation the belly, if
inflammation the reins, if dissury or ischury the bladder, a Glyster will
successfully cure all these evils.

Now the Uterus has its proper Glysters, which must be infunded into its
fundament by a Metrenchyta, the bladder its Glysters; neither want the bowels
theirs, whose orifice is narrow and nervous, and their cavity profound.

And it is taken for a liquid Medicament infused into the intestines by the
fundament, whereof there are various descriptions, according to the variety of
the affections for which they are ordained; as to mollify the belly, after this
manner.

. Mallows, Violets, Marsh mallows, brank Ursin, Mercury, Pelitory, ana m. j.
sweet Fennel seed ss. in the Summer time the four greater cool seeds j. boil
these in a sufficient quantity of water till a third part be consumed; of
which, after it is strained, take lb. j. ss. for strong people; but for the
younger sort lb. j. for infants lb. ss.

This decoction may in Summer be kept incorrupt two days in some cold place,
in Winter four: but it is best when it is new made, Quamdiu decoctum pro Clyst.
possit. incorruptum ser, vari.
and those Apothecaries do ill that keep it a whole week, and then use it.

Folia Orientalia are often decocted herein, and some Electuaries, and Honey
dissolved, according to the various intentions of the Physician, as to excite
the slowness of the belly, and to educe the humors lurking there.

And better to excite the drowsy faculty, something of common Salt, or
precious, may be added, Clysteris inventionem avis dedisse fertur.
whose virtue in moving the belly is thought to be known by the Bird called
Ibis, not much unlike a Stork, which with its long bill draws up sea water, and
immits it into its belly, whereby it is purged: hence according to Galen,
(praef. sai introduct.) was the use of Glysters learned. But be sure no Salt be
dissolved in the Glysters prescribed to the dissentery, for it will much
imbitter the dolor of the intestines.

This Glyster will discuss flatuosity.

. A Carminate Glyster.
Marsh mallows, Pelitory, tops of Dill, Origanum, Calamint, Southernwood, the
flowers of Melilot, and Chamomile, ana m j. the seeds of Cummin, Anise,
Coriander, ana. ss. boil them, in the Colature dissolve Honey of Rosemary. ij.
Bened. Laxativ.. vj. El. de Baccis Lauri. ss. Ol. Anethi. iij. fiat Enema.

Some instead of Oils made by infusion, dissolve. j. of Oil of Aniseed educed
by the chemical art, or a little more or less, as the condition of the body and
disease require; which I have often expenenced with success, when I could not
have any other to my mind.

Here note, Validius purgant Clysteres qui pinguia non admittunt.
that that injection wherein Oil or Butter, or both have been mixed, does
attract the humors more slowly; for the faculty of the Catharticks is dulled
with the addition of fats, but the dolor of the intestines is sooner quelled.
Oils and Greases are mixed and added rather to mollify and leniate, than
attract; As,

. Of the decoction of the four emollient herbs lb. j. dissolve therein Honey of
Violets, red Sugar, Catplicon j. ss. Oil of Chamomile, fresh Butter, ana ij.
conquass them together, and fiat Clysmus.

Take notice also, that Injections or Glysters do not only purge the inferior
intestines, but the middle also, and sometimes the superior, as when the
ventricle is ill affected, and attracts it from the inferior intestines: so
that Galen ( cap. 1. lib. 3. de sympt. cause.) asserts, that some have vomited
up part of a Glyster, though elsewhere he seems to hold the contrary.

Which may happen also when a Glyster made of Milk, or the decoction of Flesh,
is injected into some macilent fellow, with whose sweetness and grateful
warmth his empty ventricle being allured, sucks and attracts the liquor to it
self, that it may be refreshed therewith, as we may read in the Writings of
Avenzoar, ( Theys. cap. 18. tract. 10. lib. 1.)

This Glyster is good against the Lethargy, Apoplexy, and other affections of
the brain, whereby the senses droop, and the faculties become dull.

. Betony, Marjoran, Calamint, Sage, Origanum, ana m. j. Mercury, Arach, ana m.
ij. boil them with. ij. of Senna, and. ij. of Aniseeds; in a pint of the
Colature dissolve Honey of Rosemary. ij. Confectio Hamech, and Hier.
Diacolocynthidos, ana. ss. Salt. ij. fiat Clyster.

This Glyster cures the dissentery, or other great flux in the belly.

. Plantain, Knot-grass, Mullet, ana m. j. boil them in lb. j. of Milk; and lb.
ss. of Bean-cod water till the third part be consumed; in the Colature dissolve
Bole-armeniack, and Starch, ana. ij. the yolk of one Egg, and so make it into
a Glyster.

SECTION III. Of such as are extrinsecally applied; and first,
CHAP. I. Of Baths.
WHEN we mention a Bath, we mean such an one as is made of sweet water, whether
pluvial or fluvial: not such sordid Baths as they have in some places in Spain,
where they wash, or rather inquinate themselves in urine long kept for that
purpose: nor yet those medicinal Baths wherewith many places of the Earth
abound; which because of several Minerals they pass through, acquire several
sapours, and odours, and eximious faculties in curing many affections. For the
Earth produces almost as many Springs of Medicinal Waters, as diseases ( Gal.
cap. 5. lib. 1. de sanitate tuenda) wherewith Normandy, and almost all France,
and Germany, and Italy abound. But we here speak of a Bath, which being made of
simple water, or the decoction of some herb, may be provided in any house.

Now Baths are instituted for three causes, to wit, for delight, Balneorum usus
triplex.
for preservation of sanity, and depulsion of diseases. The ancient Romans
were great admirers of Baths for pleasure, and therefore they made Baths for
public uses, both for amplitude and artifice inimitable, the structure being
of Alexandrian and Numidian Marble; Balneorum superha structura
for the walls were adorned on one side with Thasian stones, on the other with
Pictures much recreating the sight; their cocks were of silver, which distilled
warm, or hotter water, as they would, into the vessel; for they were so much
taken with Lavacres, that some of them, especially their Emperors and
Senators, Balnea Romani habebant in deliciit.
who had Baths apart, would bathe themselves seven times a day. And seeing
Baths are very voluptuous, as Ulpianus not without reason attests, the Jews
that lived at Tripolis and Damascus had Baths for pleasure, wherein men and
women bathed promiscuously, before Antoninus the Philosophers time, which they
therefore called Gymnasies.

To preserve sanity, (...) m^gna militas.
such as have a hot liver, or squalid skin; are much helped by frequent
bathings in warm water, as Oribasius, cap. 27. lib. 1. asserts.

To depell diseases Baths are very useful; for Galen ( cap. 10. lib. 10. meth.
med. c. 20. lib. 12.) commends them in the Hectic Diarian, and sometimes in
the putrid fever, with due observation.

Hippocrates also before Galens time attested in many places, that Baths
conduce to the cure of many diseases, ( part. 44. lib. 3. de vict. acutor.) for
they open the pores, discuss the humors, abate the heat of the bowels, take
away lassitude, dilute the terrene and melancholical humor, or at least temper
and moderate it.

Make a Bath of milk alone, or a very small quantity of water and milk, for
such as are rich, and labor under a Hectic Fever: for such as are not rich,
let water suffice, and that fluvial or pluvial rather than fountain water;
wherein for more success, coct some parts, or else integral plants, as
Marshmallows, Mallows, Violets, Vine leaves, and Colesfoot, of each m. iiij.
boil them in a sufficient quantity of water for a Bath.

For the morphew or fedity of the skin, after the emendation of the prave
humors, and diminution of blood by purge and phlebotomy, let the body be
immerged in the aforesaid Bath, then let him be washed three, four, or more
times, if need be, in this following Bath.

. The leaves of Enulacampane, Sorrel, Scabious, ana m. vj. Tatsane and
Fumatory, ana m. iij. boil them in a sufficient quantity of water to fill the
Bath.

Some foolish Wretches believe, that the Leprosy may be cured by a Bath of Man's
blood^ but this horrible Prescript seems to be an invention of the Devil, and
not at all to be admitted; for such a Disease whereby the whole Economy of
Nature is ruined, can neither by external application, nor internal assumption,
nor by both together, be emended.

CHAP. II. Of a Semicupium, or Insess.
AS a Bath is a Lavacre of the whole body, except the head, which partakes also
of the vapors; so an Insess of half the body; for it is a Bath only of the
belly, or a half Bath full of convenient liquor, wherein the diseased may sit
up to his ventricle, his legs and feet be put out, called by the Greeks (...),
by the Latins Insessus or Insessio, and sometimes Semicupium. It is
constituted of the same Materials that make up a Bath and Fomentation; and it
is less than one, greater than the other.

It is very useful, for it mollifies the Uterus, reserates its vessels,
Semicupii usus.
asswages colical passions, and other dolours caused in the reins by the stone,
in the ureters by obstructions, or in other inferior parts of the belly.

This Semicupium will by the emollition and deduction of the vessels assuage
the dolor of the stone in the reins.

. Beets, Marshmallows, Mallows, Violets, Pelitory, tops of Dill, anam. iij.
Linsed ij. boil all these in rain water, or fountain, till their virtues be
transmitted, pro semicupio.

Some put the materials in some bag, and apply them to the place most pained in
the very insession. The body that abounds with crude and viscid humors should
be first purged by some convenient Medicament, if time permit; if not, then
with a Glyster.

Some make Insessions of the decoction of Tripes to cure the exsiccation,
hardness, and tension of the belly, and the colical dolours; some add milk to
them, others wine, others oil.

That colical dolor which arises from much flatuosity, distending and
excruciating the belly, may be cured with this Semicupium.

. Polium of the mount, Calamint, Origanum, tops of Dill, Melilet, Marjoran, ana
m. iij. the seeds of Cummin, Anise, Fennel, Bayberries, ana j. put them all in
two bags, and boil them in water sufficient for a Semicupium; wherein the
diseased must be demerged with his face upward from the knees to the navel.

CHAP. III. Of a Vaporary.
AVaporary consists of the same things a Semicupium is made of, though in less
quantity; for it is enough that a few herbs or such things be cocted in a
Kettle, and the vapor thereof traduced through a hole in a chair whereon the
diseased sits, to move the Uterus or Fundament; for it is only made to
reserate the Uterus, to evoke or stay Flowers, to open or constringe the
Hemorrhoides, to assuage dolor, and to alter some intemperancy.

To provoke Flowers, lest the vapor should be disgregated and exhaled into the
ambient air, the perforated chair whereon the diseased woman sits, should be
accurately involved in many clothes; for so the ascendent vapor will be easily
carried to the privities; and permeating the orifice of the vessels, will
attenuate the blood, and excite it to motion.

This Receipt is fit to move Flowers and Hemorrhoides.

. Marshmallows, Mugwort, Calamint, Hyssop, Winter-savoury, Marjoran, ana m. j.
Savin m. ij. the flowers of Melilot, Chamemile, and Jasmine, ana m. ss. let the
Decoction be made in water, and in a fourth part of white wine, and let the
vapor be admitted as above.

This Prescription is accommodate to stay both fluxes, to wit, of Flowers and
Hemorthoides.

. Shepherds purse, Knot-grass, Mouse-ear, Plantain, ana m. j. Roses m. ij.
Balaustians m. j. boil them in Bean cod water; let the vapor enter in at the
genitals.

This will assuage and allay the dolor of the Hemorrhoides.

. Mullein m. ij. Marshmallows m. j. Linseed. ss. boil them in milk; and
whilst they are hot, put them in a stool-pan, and sit upon it, that the vapor
may ingrede the fundament.

CHAP. IV. Of an Hypocaust, or Sudatory.
AN Hypocaust is a place made like a little Furnace, Hypocaustum quid.
wherein sweat is procured, by dry heat ascending through, like Spiracles, from
the fire set under it. It is called by another name, to wit, Unde dicatur
Laconicum. Ejus usus.
Laconicum, because the Laconians chiefly used it, as the Romans did baths. It
conduces much in frigid and diuturnal diseases; for seeing its fervid and sharp
heat does not only calefy the external habit of the body, but the very
praecordia and internals also; it potently opens the passages, calefies, melts,
and by sweat educes the humors.

But seeing this external calour continually thus occurring and insinuating it
self into the internals, does speedily project the humors, it can scarce be
tolerated one quarter of an hour without dissipation of the spirits, and loss
of strength, whereupon swoundings often follow: but the more delicate, and such
also whose bodye^ are laden with impure excrements, are chie^^y in danger of
this delinquency. Quae ingressum bypocausti praecedere debent.
He therefore that consults his sanity, should never en^^^ these Sudatories
till he have by purge and phlebotomy, if need be, exonerated his body; for so
the relics of those humors that infest his body, may be easily projected by
sudour.

The Rusticks custom is irreproveable, who being destitute of an Hypocaust
extracted by due and artificial industry, take a Hogshead of a just magnitude,
and calefy it either by a fire, or by setting it over a pan full of burned
coals, or a vessel full of hot water, and set therein, sweating profusely, and
with case, without any danger of swourding.

Some will sit in an oven where bread is but lately drawn out, put their heads
only out at the mouth thereof, and so sweat abundantly.

Chirurgions have invented a certain Aestuary of a vimineous texture, like a
Bird-cage, wherein they excite such to sweat as are infested with the French
disease; which they properly call a Cage, wherein the Birds do not nourish, but
are nourished.

These miserable Wretches are included herein with hot bricks, and almost
suffocated, till they sweat abundantly in every part of their bodies, having
before drunk of the Decoction of Lignum sanctum, or Sarsaparilla, or some other
Alexitery, which will both move sweat, and deleate the French disease.

CHAP. V. Of Fomentations.
FOments are so commodious, that no part of the body is averse to their
sanative operations. Aetius prescribes this Medicament to fore eyes. Trallian,
( initio lib. 6.) to the ears, to the flux of the belly, yea, he thinks them
convenient to assuage any dolor. Celsus, ( cap. 12. lib. 3.) admits of Foments
in Fevers, and thinks they should not be omitted, but by all means applied to
pleuritical, hepatical, splenical, and arthritical persons, as also to the
calculative, or other parts affected, where the ulcer has not dissolved the
continuity, nor divided the integrity. For Oribasius, ( cap. 29. lib. 9.)
says, they rarify the skin for transpiration, attenuate the blood, discuss
part thereof, and so operate, that the parts affected are not so dolorous.

Foments therefore are made for many purposes, as thus to roborate the
ventricle.

. Wormwood, both the Mints, tops of Dill, Roses, of each m. ij. A Foment
roborating the stomach.
Penniroyal, Marjorum, of each m. j. Balaustians, Cyperus nuts bruised, of each
j. boil them in water, with a fourth part of wine added toward the end of the
Coction, and foment the ventricle with sponges dipped therein, as hot as can be
suffered.

Trallian prescribes many Foments to the splenetick affections, which consist
of such things as roborate it, or as incide and digest the humors, or as
change and alter its intemperance. This Foment after purgation does remove
obstructions, and roborate it.

. Cetrarch, or Spleen-wort, Roman Wormwood, Staechados, A Fotus for the spleen.
Tamaris, of each m. ij. Broom flowers, Jasmine, of each m. j. boil them in
water and wine for a good space, and to every pint of the Decoction add Oil of
Capars iij. with which foment the part affected, either with sponges, or
bladders filled and applied.

This Foment is very good to cure the Pleurisy.

. For the Plenrisy.
Marshmallows, M^llows, Violets, of each, m. ij. the flowers of M^lilot and
Chemomile, tops of Dill, of each m. j. Linseed. j. boil these either in water
or milk, and foment the side either with clothes or spunges dipped therein.

After the foment, liniate the part with some lenitive Oil, as Oil of Lillyes,
Almonds, or Violets, or else with new Butter.

This foment, for the diseased of the Stone, must be applied to the region of
the reins.

. Fot^^ pro calculosis.
Watercresses, Pelitory, Beets, Violets, of each m. ij. F^n^greek. ij. boil
them in Hydromel, and foment the reins therewith.

CHAP. VI. Of Epithemaes.
SOme make no difference betwixt a Foment and an Epithema; but Fernalius
rightly asserts them to be different Medicaments, Differentia inter fotum and
epithema.
both from their forms, and their efficacy, seeing a Foment endued with many
qualities, may be constituted many ways, and applied to many parts. But an
Epithema is chiefly eximious for two qualities, to wit, alterative, whereby it
emends some distemper; and roborative or alexiterial, whereby it strengthens
the heart, and oppugns some kind of poison, and for the most part applied
only to the regions of the heart and liver.

They consist of distilled, Epithematum materia.
cordial, and alterative waters, or liquid decoctions, mixed with powders of
fingular virtues, wherein the proportion of powder is of one scruple, or half a
dram to every ounce of water, which we mix with a little vinegar.

Some Alexipharmacal Confection is sometimes diluted in stead of powders, as in
some pestilent season, or in some malignant distemper, which impairs the
strength of the heart, and faculties of the diseased; for in such a case it is
most secure to mix some Antidote or Mithridate with the Epithema.

This Epithema does refrigerate and roborate the liver inflamed with a Fever.

of the vital faculties.

The Ancients much commended the use of Scarlet cloth; which is not approved of
by the more recent, because in its tincture it is infected with much Arsenick:
but I approve of it in poisonous diseases, seeing poisons in such a case are
often salutiferous.

CHAP. VII. Of Lotion.
WE understand not by Lotion here a bath of cold water, as Oribasius, ( cap. 7.
lib. 1.) and Paulus, ( cap. 51. lib. 1.) do, but the ablution of some
particular member in some medicinal decoction, to take away its filth, correct
its distemper, digest its humor, roborate its parts, mitigate its dolor, and
to conciliate sleep. This Decoction will by ablution of the head kill Lice.

. Staves-acre. ij. Wormwood, Tansy, Betony, A Lotion to kill lice.
the lesser Centanry, of each m. ij. Coloquintide seeds. ss. boil them in a
sufficient quantity of water till a third part be consumed, and with a sponge
wash his head.

This Lotion will denigrate the hairs of hoary heads; which I prescribe to such
old women as would not betray their age to their husbands by their whiteness.

. The bark of Oak and Elm, of each. ij. Galls. ij. the bark of Wallnuts lb. ss.
the leaves of the Pomegranate tree, and Myrtle, of each m. ss. boil them in a
sufficient quantity of water, add thereunto Alum^. ij. Vitriol. j. after the
Colature, wash the hairs therewith, letting it dry in the Sun.

Yet Galen ( cap. 1. lib. 1. de comp. med. loc.) professes, that he never
exhibited any thing to such as adorned themselves for their own or others
delight; for this were all one as to paint a Sepulcher.

In times past men washed their heads more frequently than now adays; which
caused of late this Proverb, Wash your head never, feet seldom, hands often.

This Lotion made of the decoction of such Simples, will mitigate calour, and
soporate the senses, will by ablution of the feet therein conciliate sleep.

. Lettice m. iij. Betony, Water-lillyes, of each m. ij. Poppy flowers, A Lotion

m. j. boil them in water, and wash the feet therewith.

CHAP. VIII. Of an Embroche, or Aspersion.
BY Embrochation we mean the irrigation of some part affected, with some Oil,
Decoction, or Liquor accommodated to the cure of that distemper, distilled
thereon like rain; and hence Embroche, from the Greek word (...), to rain. This
Medicament, according to Aetius, (cap. 172. ser. 3. tetr. 1.) is used when
bathing is for some circumstances prohibited. And as it is the decoction of
Poppy and Chamemile, it conduces much to such as are infested with
night-watches, fevers, and delirations. Archigenes seeing his Master Agathinus
to rave because of his long wakes, freed him both from his deliry and wakings
by irrigating his head with much hot Oil.

These irrigations seem to differ from foments only in this, that they are
distilled upon the part from on high, the foments being only applied thereunto
by sponges, clothes, or in bags.

Now according to Oribasius, Prigatio.
(cap. 23. lib. 9.) we use irrigation only when some inflammation must be
resolved, or ulcer suppurated; Aspersion.
but aspersion in washing the face, and in hot fevers, and that in Summer with
cold water, in Winter with warmer. Yet in more simple Fevers, as also in the
subversion of the stomach, we use water mixed with vinegar in aspersion. We use
aspersions also to cure eyes infested with fluxes, by the decoction of Basil,
which is most efficacious, subjecting a dry sponge under the chin, lest the
water (...) down to the breast.

An Embroche or Irrigation is compounded of Simples cocted i^ Wine, Water,
Lees, or Oil, as this same for the Lethargy.

. Embroche capitis.
Cyperus, Calamus Aromaticus, Orris, Bay tree, of each ss. Sage, Rosemary,
Penniroyal, Calamint, Staechados, of each m. ss. Squinant, Coriander seed,
Cummin seed, of each ij. boil these in three pints of water till the third part
be consumed; add to the Colature Aqua vitae iij. besprinkle this on the head.

An Irrigation to conciliate sleep consists of Simples endued with quite
contrary qualities, and is thus made:

. Lettice, m. ij. Water-lillyes, white Roses, of each m. j. Poppy flowers,
Betony, of each m. ss. boil these, and let the Colature be sprinkled on the
head.

To Irrigation we may refer the Stillicide or Laver of medicated waters; but it
is not now our intention to treat thereof, but will proceed.

CHAP. IX. Of a Liniment.
ALiniment is of a middle consistency betwixt an Unguent and Oil, being more
liquid than an Unguent, Linimenium quid.
and more crass than Oil, for it admits of a very little Wax and Fat in its
confection, and therefore is not fluid without incalescence at the Fire or Sun.
Its basis i^ Oil, whereunto sometimes is added a little of refinous Fat with
Wax; yet not so much, but it still retains its soft consistency; for a Liniment
is nothing but a very soft Unguent, to the confection whereof any Oil may be
assumed, so it be accommodated with faculties requisite to the intended scope.
And therefore almost every Liniment being paregorical and lenitive, is
confected either of simple Oil, or of Oil of Almonds, Violets, or such like,
which will not excessively alter any temper, as this same to abate the dolor
of the side in a Pleurisy.

. Oil of sweet Almonds ij. ss. fresh Butter j. Litus ad pleuritidem.
a little Wax to make it up into a Linctus; anoint the side therewith.

Now to mitigate some dolor caused by a frigid humor, some Oil must be
assumed, which is calid in the same degree, that it may correct the humors
distemper. As on the contrary, this Liniment made of refrigerating Oils, will
amend the distemper, and assuage the dolor caused by a calid humor.

. Oil of Water-lillyes ij. ss. Oil of Roses ss. Wax iij. Let them be melted for
a Liniment.

. Oil of Violets ii. the musilidge of Marsh-mallow roots, or Linsud i. a little
Wax to make it a Liniment, and apply it to the part affected.

This Liniment will mitigate a cold distemper.

. Oil of Chamomile, and Dill, of each i. ss. Ducks fat i. A Litus for a cold
distemper.
Wax iii. let these be melted together, and make a Liniment.

CHAP. X. Of Mucagines, or Musliges.
BEcause there is often mention made of Mucagines, which are either applied
alone, or mixed with other Medicaments, our Institution leads us now to speak a
little thereof.

Now this Mucilage is efficacious in mollifying, humectating, and leniating
some dolor, as that same which is extracted from glutinous roots and seeds;
sometimes it digests and attracts, as that same which is educed out of many
gums. The seeds of Line, Foenugreek, Mallows, Quinces, Flea-wort, and Marsh
mallow roots, as also their roots macerated in warm water, are very mucaginous.
Figs also, Gum Arabic, Tragacanthum, and Isinglass, if they be a whole night
infused in water, or other liquor, and the next day recalefied, and strongly
expressed through a new cloth or bag, will dimit much mucaginous matter. Thus
the mucage of Bdellium, Sug^penum, Ammoniacum, and Galbanum, is extracted to
make up the confection of the mucilaginous Emplaister.

To every ounce of water, or other liquor, they ordinarily impose an ounce of
seeds, or roots: but if the Mucage should be more crass, then the quantity of
roots or seeds must be augmented; if more liquid, diminished, as one dram of
seed to an ounce of water.

This Muslidge applied to an inflammation, helps much.

. A Muslidge against inflammation.
The roots of Marsh mallows. ss. Flea wort seed. ij. ^nfuse them upon hot
embers for a day and a half in Nightshade water; afterward strain it, and
apply it to the part affected.

This Mucage mitigates the dolor of the eyes caused by heat.

. Another to the pain of the eyes from a hot cause.
Quinco kernels iij. infuse them a whole night in the water of Nightshade,
Water-lillyes, and Eyebright, ana i. ss. in the morning extract the Muslidge,
and apply it to the part grieved.

CHAP. XI. Of Collyryes.
IT is not enough that a Medicament be accommodated to an affection only, but
it must be fitted to the part affected also; for we do not prescribe one
Medicament to the ears, mouth, nose, and belly, but exhibit a singular
Medicament to each, as will best fit it. The eyes have their peculiar
Medicaments, called Collyryes, which are endued with eximious qualities
respecting their affections eximiously; such as Galen speaks of, ( libro de
oculis, and libris 4, and 5. composit. medicament. loc.) as also Paulus and
Aetius in many places.

There are two kinds of Collyryes; the one dry, Collyriorum differentia.
Collyria ficca.
called by the Arabians Sicf; by the Grecians, (...); by the Latins, Collyria
fieca; the other humid, (...), which are by the more recent called Collyries
absolutely, either because by their liquid form they are better accommodated to
application, the eyes not tolerating a hard and crass remedy; or else because
they are made of dry Collyries, levigated upon a Marble, and dissolved in
water, or such convenient liquor. Some of the humid Collyries are of the
consistency of Honey, or a soft Unguent, Tuthiae praeparatio.
as Tutia redacted to the form of an Unguent, by much ustion and lotion, with
the juice of Fennel, or other convenient liquor. Others are altogether liquid
and fluxile, as all those which are made of the waters of Eyebright, Roses, or
Plantain, with a small quantity of white Trochisks.

These should be reposed in glass vessels, as the more solid in earthen pots.

And as a multitude of ocular affections are cured by Collyries, so a
multiplicity of materials go to their confecture; as the whole Family of
Medicaments, whether of Minerals, Animals, or Plants, from which either Powders
can be efringed, or Waters distilled, or Juices extracted, or Excrements
desumed.

When you would quicken the sight, make an oxydorcical Collyrie of such
Medicaments as cure caligation, as the galls of Animals, the waters of
Salendine and Eyebright, or the water of Community; which confect thus.

. Eye bright m. iij. Salendine, Fennel, Vervine, Fumatory, A water to quicken
the sight.
ana m. ij. Rue, Balm, ana m. j. Cloves, Mace, long Pepper, ana. ss. macerate
them a whole night in equal parts of white Rose Water, and white Wine; then
distill of the water, with which wash the eyes.

This Collyrie will cure the pruriginous scabies of the eyebrows.

. White wine, White. For the scabies of the eyelids
Rose water, ana j. ss. Hepatick Aloes finely p^lverized, j. mix them, and make
thereof a Collyrium.

This Collyrie will roborate and refrigerate.

. A cooling and strengthening water for the eyes.
The water of Plantain, and red Roses, ana ij. whites of Eggs. ss. mix them,
and beat them well together, and make thereof a Collyrie.

This Collyrie applied to the eyes, will assuage their dolor.

. For the pain of the eyes.
The waters of Purslain and Plantain, ana j. ss. the mucilidge of Quince seeds
made in Night shade water j. mingle them, and fiat Collyrium.

This Collyrie will most efficaciously desiccate, roborate, and refrigerate.

. A water strengthening and drying.
The water of Mouse-ear, white Roses, and Plantain, ana j. Troch. alb. Rhasis
i. Tutty prepared. ss. fiat Collyrium.

This Collyrie, commonly called Eleiser, roborates the eye, and hinders the
lapse of the fourth membrane, or uvea; and it is thus confected.

. Collyrium Elciser.
Antimony, Lapit Hematit. ana x. Acacia ss. Aloes j. let them be finely
powdered, and cum aqua Knotgrass.
Corrigiolae fiant Trochisci; and when occasion calls for them, dissolve one of
them in white Rose water.

This other Collyrie, which has its denomination of Lead, is endued with a
sarcotical and consolidative faculty, and is thus made.

. A Collyrie of Lead.
Burnt Lead, Antimony, Tutty washed, burnt Brass, Gum Araback, Traganth, ana j.
Opium ss. make of these a Powder, and with white Rose water form them into
Trochisks, which dissolve in white Rose water.

This Collyrie of Lanfrancus, so called, in whose Works I could never yet find
it, is excellent against the French disease, and is thus described by the
ancient Writers.

. Collyrium Lanfranci.
White Wine lb j. of the water of Plantain and Roses, of each a much as will
suffice. Auripigmentum ij. Verdigrease j. Al^es, Myrrke, ana ij. let these be
finely powdered, and make thereof a Collyrium.

CHAP. XII. Of Virgins milk.
VIrgins milk is one of those Medicaments which the sedulity of our age has
invented; the making of which works no small admiration in the Vulgar, whilst
of two unicolourous juices mixed together they educe a third, white, viscid and
lent substance, like milk, to the spectators eyes. Thus many exhibiting a
specimen of their ingeny, are believed to do miracles, while they only unfold
Natures secrets. Lac virginale cur dicitur.
Now it is called Virgins milk, partly from its color, whereby it is like
milk, partly from its consistency and virtues, wherein it is eximious, even to
delete the freckles of the skin, which change and adulterate the virgin and
genuine color of the face. This topical Medicament is made after many ways,
whereof this is the most ordinary Receipt.

. Litharidge of Gold finely powdered iij. white wine vinegar, of the best and
strongest, lb. ss. mingle them together, stir them with a wooden spatula for
three hours, afterward filter the liquor through a brown paper, in the form of
a funnel, into a glass drop by drop: to that which is filtrated, add pluvial
or fountain water, in which dissolve a little salt, upon the mixtion whereof a
milk will appear.

This is also an usual form.

. White wine vinegar lb. ss. Litharidge of Gold finely powdered j. boil them
together till the third part be consumed, and to the Colature add a little Oil
of Tartar, and it will become white.

It may also be thus confected.

. Ceruse. ss. Litharidge j. Trochisks of Camphor. ss. the strongest Vinegar lb.
ss. macerate them three or four hours, afterward filtrate them, and to the
filtration add the water of Bean flowers, or Plantain, or Roses; in which
dissolve a little Salt, and it will become white.

It is very good against the redness of the face, and pimples, Ejus virtuor
and roughness of the skin.

CHAP. XIII. Of Alume water.
THE affinity of the qualities mind me of another water of ^^mious virtues,
which derives its denomination from Alum^, which is its basis. Since many
Juices ingrede its confection, which are better new than old, it can scarce be
made before or after Summer, but about the end of August, or the beginning of
September; for then the juice of Grapes is most copious, and most acid, being
immature, and therefore more accommodate to confect this water.

Being extrinsecally applied, it cohibits and deterges inflammations, pimples,
and other infections of the skin; adhibited also above the tongue that grows
black by the acuteness of a Fever, it will not only delete its roughness, but
so moderate its calour, as to reduce it to its natural heat.

I shall here exhibit its more usual and approved description, whereunto a
skillful Medick may easily adjoyn another, if the particular nature or
condition of any affection require it; and thus it is confected.

. Aqua aluminosa magistralis.
Of the juices of Plantain, Purslain, Grapes, Roch alume, ana lb. j. whites of
Eggs, no. xij. mix them well together with a spatula, and afterward distill
them in an Alembick.

Some, by mixing the juice of Nightshade and Limons with it, make it more
prevalent against filth and lice, and other affections of the skin; and they
call it the Magisterial Alume water.

CHAP. XIV. Of a Frontal.
AFrontal, which the Greeks call (...), is a Medicament, which imposed on the
forehead, does help the headache; and it is often exhibited to extinguish its
ardour, and conciliate sleep, when in long Fevers too much waking has
dejected the strength, corrupted the blood, and exagitated the mind. For then a
topical, refrigerative Hypnotick applied to the frontispiece of the head, will
be very salutiferous, by abating the dolor, mitigating the fervor, tempering
the blood, and cohibiting the ascendent fumes. Nicholaus Myrepsius tells us,
that a Frontal duly confected, and rightly adhibited to the eyes, cures
lippitude, and abundant fluours. But we must take heed we do not adhibit
humectative and refrigerative Frontals to a phlegmatic brain, or old men in
winter, especially seeing they are not meet for such in summer, Quibus
fr^ntalia been vel male convenient.
nor yet for any of a cold nature. But they may be successfully applied to
young men, and such as are choleric, or infested with some hot disease, which
always causes great dolor in the head at any time.

But the use of Frontals is no way safe for young girls, whose Cranium yet
gapes, and whose Vertex is yet moveable, especially such as admit Vinegar in
their composition, which is an enemy to the brain; or are endued with a
narcotical, or with a refrigeratory or calefactory quality, or any other
eximious faculty in excess.

They indeed are very expetible which by the first degrees change the distemper
of the four qualities, cohibit vapors, gently soporate the senses, and
roborate the brain.

All Frontals are either somewhat humid, or altogether dry; the humid are of
multifarious forms and consistencies, for they are either made in form of an
Unguent, or of a Liniment, or of an Opiate, or of a Cerato malagma; as when
some oleaginous Medicaments are super-added to brayed herbs, and a Frontal
formed of the mixture.

Neither are dry Frontals uniform, but confected of leaves and flowers, either
integral, or pulverated and sowed in a double Syndon, or pure cloth.

This Frontal is accommodate to women.

. Of the leaves of Lettice, and Betony cut small, and of Rose leaves ana m. j.
madefy these in Oxyrrhodino, and make thereof a Frontal.

This Frontal will assuage the fervor of the head, and conciliate sleep.

. Conserves of Water-lillyes vj. of Roses. ss. Fervorem mitigans, somnumque
concilians.
of the flower of Poppyes p. ij. beat them together in a mortar with a little
Unguent Populeon, and fiat Frontale.

CHAP. XV. Of Cataplasms and Pultises.
THis soft Medicament, which only extrinsecally applied, does assuage dolor,
repel, mollify, relax and calefy, as also move, vacuate and digest corrupt
matter, is called both by Greeks and Latins Cataplasma. It has the
consistency of a Pultis, whence it often borrows a name; though in proper
loquution, Pulls is rather an Aliment, and Cataplasma a topical Medicament,
which is not confected solely of Honey, wherein some Simples or Compounds
accommodate to that purpose have been cocted, as the Ancients used to make it;
but of Roots, Herbs, Meal, Oil and Butter; and very often, and that
successfully, by clinical women, of Milk, Bread crumbs, Oil, and the yolks of
Eggs, to mitigate, leniate, and concoct. And he that calls a Cataplasm thus
compounded a Pultis, and a Pultis made of Barley meal, the mucaginous matter of
Linseed, and Eggs yolks, a Cataplasm, does err nothing, according to
Fernelius; for both have the same consistency, to wit, a mean betwixt an
Unguent and a Salve; and as it were the result of both their materials
compounded together, both have the same method in confecture, and in use.

Fernelius thinks, that the Ancients used Cataplasma and Malagus^ for the same
thing: but Galen, ( initio lib. 7. de comp. med. gen.) according to the meaning
and opinion of the Ancients, names those Medicaments alone Malagms, which
mollify parts preternaturally obdurated: so that a malactical and mollitive
Medicament, and a Malagm do not at all differ, nor constitute distinct species,
as it is very probable.

Pultises then are constituted of Roots, Leaves, Stalks cocted to a putrilency,
Meal, Fat, and Oil. If dry Plants be required, they must be pulverated; if
green, cocted till they liquefy, then stamped in a mortar, trajected through a
scarce, and mucaginous fat, or oleaginous matters added to the pulped matter,
and sometimes meal; and then must they be again cocted, till they acquire the
crassitude of a Pultis.

This Cataplasm will assuage dolor, and mollify obdurateness.

. Anodynum and malacticum.
The roots of Lillyes and Marsh mallows, ana ij. Mallows, Pelitory, Violets,
ana m. ij. boil them till they become soft, beat them small, and pulp them
through a sieve, to which add Linseed ij. Oil of Lillyes iij.

One made of the powder of Linseed cocted in Hydreol to a just consistency,
will exceedingly mollify and mitigate any dolor.

This Cataplasm will educe viscid humors, open the pores, and dissipate
flatuosity.

. Briony root lb. j. Sowbread root iij. Mercury m. ij. Flatus dissipant.
boil them till they become soft in water with a fourth part of white wine,
bruise them, and traject them through a sieve; to the pulp add powder of
Bay-berryes ss. powder of Fennel seeds and Cummin, and Chamomile flowers, ana
ij. Lupines and Faenugreek, ana j. Oil of Orris as much as suffices, to make a
Cataplasm.

A Cataplasm made of common bread, Syncomistum.
which they call Syncomistum, is good for all things, if we believe Oribasius;
For (says he) it is convenient almost for all inflammations, when it is
confected with water and oil of Roses.

That also is good for many dolours which is confected of leavened bread and
oil, for it ripens obdurateness, heals contusions, attracts lurking humors to
the skin, digests and resolves them.

There are various forms of Pultises recorded in every Author, which here to
rehearse would be as endless as useless, since these few examples may suffice.

CHAP. XVI. Of Catapasms, Empasms, and Diapasms.
ODoriferous Powders compounded of many Aromataes, Catapasma quid.
which for fragrancy and suavities sake are strewed upon clothes, are properly
called Catapasms. Those Powders also which after litation are applied to some
part of the body, as to the stomach for its roboration, and those odoriferous
Powders which are made for Condiments, and other uses; as Sarcotical, for
generation of flesh in ulcers; Catheretical, for absumption in superfluous
flesh; Epulotical, for the induction of a skar, are called Catapasms, ( Paul.
c. 13. l. 7.) But because we have treated of these before, we shall not further
prosecute that subject; neither would we have spoken a word thereupon, but for
that same paranomasy there is betwixt a Catapasm and a Cataplasm.

The less affinity falling in the denominations of Empasm and Diapasm, leads us
to show their difference each from other, as also how they both differ from a
Cataplasm.

Now according to Oribasius, ( cap. 31. lib. 10.) Empasma quid
those are Empasms which are adhibited to cohibit immoderate heat, or other
exhalations, or to scarify the extremity of the skin, or to remove a Pleurisy.
Those Diapasms, Diapasma quid
which are accommodated to conciliate suaveolence to the skin or body, either
by way of Powder, Unguent, or Liniment. Those Cataplasms, which are confected
after the former description, and for the uses we mentioned in the foregoing
Chapter.

Empasins are either used to stay the immoderate fluour of sweat, which is not
critical, but dissolves Natures strength, or to help the Mydroptical,
Sciatical, or Orthopnoical Patients. Those that stay and cohibit the profusion
of sudours, consist of Parget, dry and levigated Myrtle, Pomegranate pills,
Syrian Sumack, Sorb apples dried and brayed, Galls, Acacia, and such like
Astrictives. Those that help such as are diseased with the Dropsy, such as are
infested with the Sciatica, and such as cannot breathe unless they hold their
neck strait up, are confected of Sand, burned Wine lees, Nitre, Salt, Sulphur,
Mustard, Water cresses, Pepper, Pelitory, and such like sharp Ingredients,
whereof Sinapisms also are made, which act and produce the same effect with
Empasms.

CHAP. XVII. Of Sinapisms and Phaenigms.
ASinapism is a kind of Cataplasm, for their consistency is alike, though
their faculties be distinct: for Sinapisms consist of one quality, and are
always calefactory; Catalpasms of many; and thence they calefy, refrigerate,
mollify, relax, etc. A Sinapism is seldom or never adhibited in acute
diseases, neither by way of table nor colliquament, as Oribasius notes, ( cap.
13. lib. 10.) but in Lethargies, Apoplexies, or the Nightmare, and in stupid
natures, that the dullness of the sense may be excited, the faculty awakened,
the heat acted, and the humor discussed.

The manner of making a Sinapism is thus described by Oribasius and Aetius, (
cap. 181. tetr. 1. sermon. 3.) Take dried Figs, q. v. macerate them a whole day
in warm water, afterward make a strong Expression, and bruise the Figs; then
take the sharpest and strongest Mustard seed, bruise it by it self, pouring on
a little of the colature of the Figs, which will make it beat more easily: but
take heed too much be not mixed; lest it be too thin and liquid; then reduce
them into small masses, of the Figs and Mustard, of each equal parts: but if
you would have the Sinapism stronger, take two parts of the Mustard, and one of
the Figs; if weaker, two of the Figs, and one of the Mustard.

If the Sinapism be made with Vinegar, it is more inefficacious and weak,
because Vinegar discusses the strength of the Mustard.

The Sinapism should be put upon a Linen cloth, and so adhibited to the place,
and should be often looked at, to see if it have contracted rubour enough by
its admotion, for some perceive its effect on them sooner, some later, so that
I cannot certainly define what space of time it must abide on the place. But if
the Sinapism after long admotion act not, nor alter the color of the skin, it
must be fomented with hot water with a sponge, that the faculty of the Sinapism
may be easier intromitted; for the Sinapism, by extracting the excrements to
the skin, either ulcerates, or at least rubrifies it; whence it is called a
Phaenigm, that is, a rubrifying Medicament. Phaenigmus.


After the diseased has sufficiently used the Sinapism, he must be bathed, and
then have the part affected anointed with oil of Roses.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Dropax and Pication.
A Dropax is a topical Medicament, sometimes hard like a salve, Dropax quid.
sometimes soft like a Malagm, as the case requires. Now a Dropax is either
simple, which is made of Pitch, and a little Oil only; or compound,
Differentiae.
which admits of many calefactories besides Pitch and Oil, as Pepper, Bartram,
Bitumen, Brimstone, Salt, and the ashes of Vine branches.

It is convenient for diuturnal diseases, as Aetius, ( cap. 180. tetr. 1.
Quibus morbis conveniat.
sermon. 3.) shows, and must always be adhibited both before and after a
Sinapism; before, that it may prepare the body for a Sinapism; and after, that
it may exscind the remaining affections. A simple one is thus made.

. Of the best Pitch, dissolve it with a little Oil; and while it is hot dip in
a cloth, and clap it to the place affected, and before it is cold pluck it off
again; calefy it before the fire, and apply it as before; and before it waxes
cold, pull it off; and let this be repeated as often as need requires.

It helps such as are infested with frequent vomits, with collicks, Picatio
quibus affectibus conveniat.
and with crudities; it helps also such parts as do not grow, nor partake of
the nutriment.

The more compound Dropax is constituted of the above mentioned calefactories,
Dropax magis compositus.
when it is prescribed for the reduction of any part perished by cold to its
pristine bonity; and when it is requisite, that it exsiccate. Then Oribasius (
cap. 10. lib. 1.) adds Salt, Sulphur, Wine, and the ashes of Vine branches to
its confection; and when it should open, Euphorbium and Lymnestis, otherwise
called Adarce; and all these must be brayed and strewed into melted Pitch.

The Dropax must be applied while it is hot, the hairs of the place first
shaved off, and a special care had lest the strength of the Dropax overpower
the diseased.

If the Dropax be speedily pulled off, it confirms the remiss spirits, Dropacis
effectus.
revokes them to the superficies, and minds them of their work. (Aetius loco
dicto.)

It is sometimes adhibited instead of a Psylothrum, to evell the hairs of a
scurfy head; for that malign, filthy, contagious ulcer of the head cannot be
perfectly cured, unless the hair be first evelled or abraded.

CHAP. XIX. Of Psylothers.
APsylother is referred to the cosmical Medicaments, which serve chiefly for
the bodies culture and ornament, neither Unguent nor Salve, nor yet partaking
of any special form; but a depilatory Medicament, which applied in any form
whatever, will by its quality erode the hairs or down, and so make a rough
place smooth. Now every Psylother, properly so called, having an eroding and
burning faculty, does not only attenuate, but evell hairs, and for a time
utterly denude the place, and therefore must not be applied without great care
and prudence; for if it abide too long on the place, especially if it be
adustive, it will ulcerate the skin, raise pimples, and burn like a Caustic,
or erodes like an Escharotical Medicament. Oribasins, ( cap. 13. lib. 10.)
reckons these for such Depilatories as may be safely adhibited, to wit,
stillatitious Lixive, Arsenick, Sandarach, and Calx viva. Yet may some of those
that exulcerate more vehemently be added to make the Psylothers more valid; as
Paulus Aegineta does in this description, ( cap. 52. lib. 3.)

. Millepedae. Hogs lice. Psy^othris Pauli. Aselli domestici.
Assellorum domesticorum ij. Sandarach ss. Lime stone j. old Vinegar, the
Lixivium of a Fig tree, and lb ss. boil them to the consistency of a Liniment.

This Domesticus Asellus is an Animal which lodges under water vessels, and
contracts it self into a lump. The Greeks call them (...), the Latins,
Millepedae; the French, Cloportes; we, Palmer worms.

Rondeletius prescribes this Psylother to absume hairs, Rondeletii Psylother.
that they may never come again.

. Auripigmentum, Ants eggs, Gum Arabic, ana ss. Gum Hederae ij. and with the
blood of a Bat, or juice of Henbane, make it up into a Liniment according to
art; a portion whereof must be applied to the place you would have denuded,
after you have shaved off the hair.

Oribasius and Aetius call white Vine or Briony a Psylother, because of its
excellent faculty in eroding hairs.

This Psylother is most efficacious, made after this manner.

. Another.
Limestone ij. Auripigmentum ss. let these be boiled in as much Lixivium as
will suffice, and make thereof a Liniment, with which anoint the place for four
hours, afterward wash it with clean water.

In the Turks Dominion there is a Mineral they call Rusma, which may justly be
preferred before all Psylothers for its preheminency in acting; for though it
be very temperate, and burn not the part to which it is adhibited, yet it does
speedily and without dolor erode the hairs, denude the place, leaving it very
smooth, without any token of a hair. Which that it may be more commodiously
applied, it should be levigated into small powder, and diluted in water with
half as much Calx viva. The Turkish women, before they go into a Bath, or
Hypocaust, adhibit this mixture to their privy members, and arm-holes, which
places they much desire always to depilate and glabrify. This Rusma is like
Iron dross, but lighter, blacker, and seemingly exust, as Bellonius observes, (
cap. 33. lib. 3.)

CHAP. XX. Of Vesicatories.
THis little extrinsecal Medicament, Vesicatorium quomodo a sinapismo and
pyrotico differt.
from its effect in exciting the bladder, we call a Vesicatory. It is a little
more vehement than a Phoenigm or Sinapism, which only rubrifies the
superficies of the skin, and more weak than a Pyrotick, which burns the skin;
for being adhibited to the skin, it raises the extreme surface, and causes
blisters; which being broken, emit water in little quantity, if the body be
dry, or the Medicament applied to the superior parts; in greater quantity, if
the body be humid, or hydropical, and it applied to the inferior parts, as to
the leg: for the skin being broken, the water fluctuating in the belly or legs,
will sometimes delabe, and flow from the little ulcer, as from a fountain: but
the ulcer is sometimes left dysepulotical.

A Vesicatory applied behind the ear on the side the tooth affected stands,
helps the toothache; and sometimes by its adhibition to the feet, the Gonagry
and Podagry are cured; and it is thought to be more conducible to the
phlegmatic than the choleric: yet I saw the Ring-worm perfectly cured by the
application of a Vesicatory, which no other presidy could amend. ( Marcellus,
cap. 19. lib. de remed.) commends it to the cure of tetters, and other
affections of the skin. Vesicatorium rusticorum.
If a Vesicatory be applied to a wound inflicted by some wild beast, or to a
malign sore near the groins, it will evoke the poison, and very much facilitate
the cure. The Rusticks make it of the roots of Ranunculus bruised, and apply
it; but the Apothecaries make it of Cantharides pulverated and mixed with a
little vinegar and leaven: that is the best which is confected of the powder of
Cantharides, mixed with the Gum of Elemus. And it is thus made.

. Euphorbium, Pepper, Cantharides, ana. ss. and with leaven and vinegar make it
into a Vesicatory.

CHAP. XXI. Of Pyroticks, or Cauteries.
HIppocrates, ( Aph. ult. lib. 7.) says right; What Medicaments cannot cure,
the Sword may; what the Sword cannot, Fire may; but what Fire cannot, is
altogether incurable. For a Disease is often so efferous, as it will yield to no
Medicament, but must either be cured by section, or ustion, or both. Now ustion
is often performed with a hot Iron, which were able to terrify the most
magnanimous; in whose stead the sedulity of our Medicks have invented a
Medicament, which from its operation and effect they name a Pyrotick; for in
its efficacy it resembles fire, by its application it kills the quick flesh,
absumes the dead flesh, and perforates the sound part, that it may receive the
excretion of the unsound, opens the unsound that it eructate its own
excrements. Thus a Pyrotick makes an abscess for the corruption to break
through; thus it breaks the impostume, and pertunds the fwellings, that each
may disgorge its own poison.

Pyroticks are applied to diverse parts of the body, as sometimes to the head,
sometimes to the arms, sometimes to one or other leg, to resolve and divert
rheumatick humors. A Pyrotick is sometimes applied to that same ample
production of the peritoneum, where the spermatick veins tend to the testicles,
for the cure of the bursting disease, Cauterium ad Herniam.
that new flesh may supply the place of the morbid, and intercept the passage
of the descendant intestine, that so it may be incarcerated in its proper place.

Many Circulators do so much adhibit this method of curation on the incautions
diseased, that they burn both Seminaries and productionary vessels with their
often repeated Pyroticks.

Their materials are all adust and caustical, Pyroticorum materia.
exceeding the fourth degree of heat, as Calx viva, Arsenick, Sublimatum,
Tartar, Orpine, Vitriol, Nitre, and it may be Lixivium, as also the result of
the ashes of Vine branches.

Pyroticks have various confections, Conficiendi modus.
every one making them according to their own arbitration, and thinking that
best they themselves invent. I knew a young Barber as ignorant as could be, who
was wont to adhibit a little Sublimatum subacted with the Egyptian Unguent,
which he earnestly commended for the best and most secure Pyrotick.

Marianus in his Chirurgy much esteems this Pyrotick, which he desumed from Jo.
Vigonius; and it is thus described.

. Lixivium lb. vj. Soap, Roman Vitriol, ana j. boil them together in a brass
vessel till the liquidness of the water be consumed; and what remains in the
bottom, let it be reserved, of which make Cauteries of what magnitude you
please.

Cardanus confected his Cauteries of Soap and Lime alone mixed, beaten and
subacted to the form and consistency of an Unguent: but now they are made
before the fire, and acquire a more solid and convenient form; as this:

. Lime stone lb. j. Salt petre j. infuse them a whole day in four pints of
Lixivium; afterward stir it well with a spatula, then strain it three or four
times, till the water be all poured off, which dry before the fire; or thus,
after infusion let the whole mixture be agitated with a rudicle; next day let
it be percolated three or four times, till the water be clear; which put in a
brass vessel, and coct it over a luculent fire till the water be consumed, but
not till all its lentour be exficcated: then make of that mass many Cauteries,
of several magnitudes, which preserve in a glass vessel diligently stopped for
future use.

It is also well confected after this manner.

. Of the ashes of Vine branches lb iiij. Sal Gem. iij. Lime stone lb j. ss.
infuse them for four or five hours in lb xv. of rain water, which stir well
together for a good space, afterward boil it a little; and when the whole
mixture is perfectly cold, strain it six or seven times through a thick cloth;
put the limpid Colature into a brass basin, and coct it till a stony matter be
left in the bottom, which form into Pyroticks of different magnitudes.

Amongst Pareus his descriptions I find a Cautery, ridiculously called
Sericeum, whose effect not answering his vain pollicitations, I will not here
describe.

CHAP. XXII. De Scuto, or, Of Plasters made in the form of a Buckler, to be
applied to the stomach.
MAny Medicaments, as well assumptive as applicative, are prescribed to the
frigid distemper, and imbecility of the ventricle. Gentle Purgatives, and
Eustomachical Medicaments, as pills of Aloes, and Rhabarb, Aromaticum rosatum,
and digestive Powders are assumed.

Calefactives and Roboratives, Cui parti accommodatum.
as Liniments, Foments, whereof before, and this Scutum whereof we now treat,
are applied.

Now this Medicament peculiar to the ventricle, Scutum cur sic dictum.
is so called from its form; it suscitates heat, augments strength, and helps
concoction.

It is concinnated of some stomachical Emplaister extended upon a quilted piece
of Leather, and applied. Sometimes there is a piece of Tiffany put betwixt it
and the part affected.

But it is more ordinarily confected of dry Medicaments, which roborate the
ventricle, involved in bombast, and sewed in a double cloth like a Buckler.

The abundance of Calefactives and Roboratives suggest to us such plenty of
matter, Ventriculum peculiariter respicientia.
that we may select such as especially respect the ventricle, as Nutmeg, Mace,
Cloves, sweet Cane, Squinant, Roses, Mint, Wormwood, and many more, which
recreate the spirits by their suavcolence, and help concoction by their calour.
A Scutum thus confected, is most efficacious for the said uses.

. Cyperus, Lignum Aloes, Calamus Aromaticus, ana j. Squinant, Cinnamon, Cloves,
Nutmegs, ana. ss. Mace. j. red Roses, Marjoran, Wormwood, Mint, ana ij. Sage j.
make of these a fine powder, which quilt between two linen clothes, cut like
the form of a Buckler, and applied.

This Description requires less cost.

. Galangal, Orris, Pepper, of each j. Bay berries, Cummin seed, ana. ss. both
sorts of Wormwood, Mint, Sage, and Rosemary, an^ us. ss. make of these a
Powder, and quilt them between a double sarsnet in cotton wool, and apply it to
the region of the ventricle.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Cucufa, and Semicucufa, or quilted Caps.
THE brain being according to Hippocrates, (lib. de grandul.) as it were a
great glandule, and the head, the very seat and continent of Plegm, which like
a Cucurbite it attracts, a great congeries of frigid humors is always
resident in the head; which unless they be vacuated by some convenient
Medicament, or else their continual generation hindered, they will distill upon
the jaws, lungs, breast, and parts subjected. Yet many are so averse to vacuate
Medicaments, or their brains of so frigid a constitution, that though often
purged, yet will they complain of gravity in their heads, especially if they
have been troubled with any noise, or stood bare-head in the air.

Therefore after universal purgation, a convenient Cucufa must be adapted to
the head like a Cap; Cephalical Powders being insperged in Cotton, and the
Cotton sewed within a double cloth, and put upon the head to roborate it, to
cure its cold distemper, and to stay the distillation.

Now all the matter of these Powders wherewith the Coif or Cap is refarciated,
is not desumed from dry Plants, but some from Minerals and Animals, which are
as delightful as useful.

A Powder thus made, is both good and pleasant for a roborative Coif.

. Cloves, Cinnamon, Calamus Aromaticus, Squinant, Orris, A Powder for a quilted
Cap.
ana j. Bay berries ij. Storax benioin, ana ss. Mace. j. Marjoran, Rosemary,
ana ij. Mosch. ss. make of these a Powder, which quilt in a Cap.

Those that cannot procure a Cucufa thus made, may thus confect one with less
cost.

. Betony, Balm, Sage, Staechados, Rosemary, ana m. ss. Another for the same.
Bay berries iij. Cummin j. make of all these a gross powder to quilt in a Cap
or Coif.

This Powder may for the same purpose be safely and successfully strewed on the
hairs of ones head.

In sum, a Cucufa or Coif, and a Scutum or Buckler, are confected after one and
the same manner; only the form of the Coif has adapted it to the head, the
Buckler to the stomach, to which parts their faculties are destined, as
adjutorious; for the one consists of Stomachicals for the stomach, the other by
Cephalicals is accommodated to the head; whereunto we sometimes add
astrictives, when we would stay the Catarrhs.

And as a Cucufa involves the whole Cranium, so Semicucufa only half; as when
this Medicinal Powder interbastated in Cotton, is applied only to the part
affected.

CHAP. XXIV. Of Bags.
WHen a Physician would use small, or pretty big Seeds that are dry, or
integral, and are not of themselves applicable to the part of the body, they
must before their adhibition be included in some great or small Bag
proportionate to the part affected. A very small Bag is used to cure the noise
in the ears, a large one is adhibited to the Colic and Tympany, that it may
cover the whole belly. The magnitude of the Bag applied to the region of the
heart, must be proportionate thereunto; as those, which being confected of
cordial and alexiterial Powders, are carried on the region of the heart in time
of pestilence, to the presidy of it self and its faculties.

They are either dry, Fomenta sicca.
or humid: the dry ones were by the Ancients called Foments, who did not
distinguish between dry Foments and Bags. They are applied to many parts of the
body, as head, heart, ventricle, liver, spleen, and Uterus, in on quadrate
form: but they should be long, like an Oxes tongue, that are adhibited to the
spleen; and in the form of a Buckler, to the ventricle.

But that the dispensation of the matter may be equal in all the parts of the
Bag, it must be transversly stitched all over. That which is applied to the
heart is most what made of Silk, to the other parts of Linen or Canvas, of a
rare contexture.

Calid Bags, which consist of Seeds rubbed and irrigated in Wine or Vinegar,
best confer to refrigerated members, and do dissipate flatuosity, evoke and
absorb humors; as this for the Colic or Tympany.

. A Sacculus to colic passions.
Grumwell seed lb. ss. Bay berries bruised iij. sweet Fennel seed, Dill and
Cummin, ana j. common Salt ij. Basil and Morjoran, ana m. ss. torrefy them all
together in a frying pan, and recond them hot in a bag, which induce upon the
part affected; and when it grows cold, calefy it, and apply it again; or rather
make two, that they may be adhibited by course.

This Bag is eximious in curing cordial affections.

. A Sacculus to comfort the heart.
The roots of Angelica, Orris, Enulacampane, Cyperus, Gentian, Tormentill, ana
j. Trochisks of Camphor, Benioin, Storax, ana ij. Aliptae moschatae, Lignum
Aloes, yellow Sanders, ana. ss. Mace, Cloves, Squinant, ana j. Kermes,
Barberries, Citron pill, ana ij. make of these a gross Powder, and put them in
a silken Sacculus for the region of the heart.

I can scarce approve of dry Bags for the Pleurisy, nor yet of such as are made
madid with a little vapor, but think humid Foments more conducible; of which
before.

Coifs, Frontals, and a Buckler, are accommodated to the head and stomach: but
Bags are more convenient for the cure of the Lethargy, Apoplexy, and excitation
of the drowsy senses; as this:

. Cyperus, Galangal, Cloves, Angelica roots, Bay berries, Cummin, ana ij. Sage,
Marjoran, Betony, Staechados, Lavender of both sorts, ana m. j. make them all
into pretty crass Powder, and interbastate it in two Bags for the friction of
the skull; for it is most convenient to have two Bags, especially when we
purpose to apply the hot, that while one is adhibited, the other may calefy,
and so alternately succeed each other.

CHAP. XXV. Of Dentifricies.
THE Teeth are obnoxious to very many vices; for Nigritude deturpates them,
Rottenness absumes them, Laxity shakes them, and Dolor most grievously infests
them. Dentifricies are prescribed to their nigritude, Astrictives to their
laxity, Detersives and Roboratives to their corruption, and a thousand remedies
to their dolor or aches; for every one professes a secret Experiment for the
Toothache. But that which once conduces to their cure, is afterward often
vain, if not discommodious.

Many Women would rather endure the Toothache, than their blackness, which
notwithstanding the Commonalty regard not: yet such a marcour came upon
Metrodorus his sons gums, Historia.
that both his axle teeth, and also his gums, fell out. ( Hip. lib. 5, and 7.
epid.)

Medicks prescribe Dentifricies to exterge and dealbate the teeth, in various
forms, as of Powder, Opiate, Liniment: but the most usual is of Powder, thus:

. Cuttle bone ij. white Coral, Crystal, ana j. Hearts horn, A Powder to make
white the teeth.
Lignum Lentisci, ana ij. make of them a Powder, with which rub the teeth.

This Dentifrice also will dealbate the teeth.

. Ivory, Pumice stone, Hearts horn, ana j. Coral ij. Pearl j. Cloves, Cinnamon,
Roses, Rosemary, ana j. make of these a Powder, with which rub the teeth.

A Dentrifrice in form of an Opiate may be thus confected:

. Sea horse teeth burnt, Alume, white Coral, ana j. Cuttle bone, Dentrificies
in the form of an Opiate.
Pumice stone, ana j. burnt Salt ij. Mace, Cloves, Lignum Lentisci, ana. ss.
make of these a Powder, and with Honey of Roses an Opiate.

Some make others in the form of Trochisks, with which when dry and hard, they
deterge, purge and dealbate their teeth.

CHAP. XXVI. Of Odoraments.
HIppocrates (initio lib. de medico) went not far from the mark, when he said,
that besides other things, artificial culture in apparel, and suaveolence, was
requisite to a Physician, wherewith the diseased may be as much delighted, as
he is wont to be offended either with ungrateful, or too fragrant odours: for
many men hate those odours that either fill the head, or molest the sense, and
cause headache; and on the contrary, are delighted with the vapors that
proceed from suaveolent simples, which recreate the uterus, ventricle, heart,
and brain. Whereof Galen, ( cap. 6. lib. 1. de sympt. cause.) giving a reason,
and proportionating the constitution of odours with them of sapours, ( c. 21.
l. 4. de simpl. med. facult.) says, As sapours that are familiar are grateful
and pleasant, and those ungrateful and unpleasant which are not familiar; so
those odours that are familiar to the animal spirits, are grateful and
suaveolent thereunto; and those that are not familiar, unpleasant and
maleolent. And as according to Galen, sweet meats are temperate, so according
to Scaliger, suaveolent Medicaments are moderately hot.

Which things being thus, pleasant Odoraments must needs be grateful to the
brain, and principal parts. Yet some of them are hot in the third degree, as
Cinnamon, Cloves, and sweet Cane, which we do not use save in small quantity,
or intermixed with such things as temper their heat: for Odoraments objected to
the nose in great quantity, are graveolent, and hurtful to the brain; which
recreate it in small quantity, because their graveolency is tempered with the
ambient air, Maleolentia ingrata, and sacultatibus no^ia.
or with the mixtion of other things. But maleolent things, though tempered
with the ambient air, are averse to the brain both in quality and substance;
according to Galen, (cap. 10. lib. de instrum. odorat.) which Aristotle also
confirms, whilst ( cap. 24. lib. 8. de Hist. Anim.) he says, that Women may
become abortive at the smell of an extinguished Candle.

Seeing then that suaveolent Odours are consocial to the spirits; and their
familiar Pabulum, the Physician will not only acquire praise of the Vulgar by
being perfumed, but he will be better able to prescribe Odoraments, both to
roborate the spirits, and defend sanity.

Now they are either described in form of an Unguent, or of a Pomander, or of
Trochisks, or of Powder. An Odorament in for^ of Powder is thus confected.

. Calamus Aromaticus iij. Orris Florentine ij. Storax, Benioin, ana j. Roses
ij. Cloves. ss. Mosch, Amber, ana. ss. make of these a Powder.

Our later Physicians extol an Odorament they call the Damask Powder.
Cyprian Odor, or the Violet Odor; which being variously described, every one
calls a suaveolent or fragrant Powder, or the Cyprian or Violet Powder.

An Odorament in form of an Unguent may be easily made, if you put the above
described Powder in Oil, Amber, and Wax, that it may acquire a fit consistency.
Or thus:

. Yellow Saenders, Calamus Aromaticus, Squinant, Cinnamon, ana j. Storax
Benioin, Mace, ana. ss. Wax iij. Ol. Moschelini q. s. and fiat unguento. Or
thus:

. Mace, Cinnamon, ana. ss. Benioin ij. Civet, Mosch, Amber, ana. ss. Camphor
gr. 5. with Oil of Almonds make it up into an Unguent.

An Odorate mass also may be made of select Aromataes, whereof Pomanders or
Trochisks may be formed, whose suaveolence is of great esteem; as,

. Citron pill dry, Cinnamon, Labdanum, ana j. Storax ij. Mace, Cloves, Lignum
Aloes, Orris, ana. ss. Camphor j. Mosch, Civet, Amber, ana. ss. with musilidge
of Gum Traganth make it into a mass, of which make Pomanders or Trochisks.

CHAP. XXVII. Of Perfumes, and Suffumigatories.
ALL sweet Odours exhilarate the spirits, but many will not communicate their
scent save by fire, and therefore such are set over burning coals, or otherwise
so calefied, that they emit their odours plentiously.

Thus did the first Adorers of a Deity make their Incense Sacrifice: thus do
Physicians confect their Perfumes for sanity: and thus do the Courtiers confect
theirs for pleasure. Yet the matter of Perfumes is not always injected upon
coals, but sometimes put into a brazen or silver pot, which the Vulgar call a
Cassolet, Corula Cassoleta.
together with water of Roses, or Oranges, laying quick coals under it, that it
may boil, and with its vapor fill and perfume the whole house.

A Perfume is either humid or dry, and both either for pleasure or sanity; the
humid may easily be made, and is very familiar to delicate women, who being
sick, or taking purgative Medicaments, perfume their Cubicles with the pills of
Oranges, Lemmons, Cloves, Cinnamon, and Rose water mixed together, and put in a
Cassolet over the fire.

The dry ones are more frequently confected by Apothecaries at the Phyficians
precept, either for pleasure or profit.

Those, who through epicurism and voluptuousness profusely spend their Fathers
means, most accustom delicious Perfumes.

Those, whose spirits want refection, brains roboration, hearts exhilaration,
and bodies vindication from some extrinsecal malignity, require sanitiferous
Perfumes.

Now Perfumes help the lungs stuffed with abundance of phlegm, Suffitus quibus
affectionibus conveniat.
and yet they are not convenient to all diseases and affections about the
breast: for Aetius (cap. 144. tetr. ser. 3.) says, that they do harm such as
spit blood, by opening the vessels: neither yet are they convenient for those,
who have some dry disease about their breasts; but they eximiously conduce to
such as are pursy, orthopnoical, and whose breasts are infested with many crude
humors; as also to such as labor under the French disease, Lues Indica
suffitu nonnunquam curatur.
if they be duly confected of idoneous Medicaments, which will abject the
poison of that distemper, by frequent salivation, and be exhibited after the
body has been vacuated by universal remedies. And they are most frequently
used in form of a pretty crass Powder; as thus, to roborate and siccate the
brain.

. Storax, Benioin, ana j. ss. Gum of Juniper, Frankincense, ana j. Cloves,
Cinnamon, ana iij. the leaves of Bays, Sage, Rosemary, ana. ss. make of all
these a gross Powder, and then put a part thereof upon burning coals, that the
diseased may expire the suffigated fume.

This Perfume will stop the humor that delabes from the brain to the lungs.

. Cypress nuts, Balaustians, Ladanum, ana j. Roses ij. Myrtle berries, and
Mastich, ana j. ss. make gross Powder for Fumigation.

This Fumigation made after this manner, does wonderfully roborate the heart,
and resartiate the spirits.

. A Cordial Fume.
Calamus Aromaticus, Xyloaloes, Squinant, Cinnamon, ana j. Storax, Benioin, ana
j. ss. Mace, Cloves, ana. ss. Roses, Marjoran, ana ij. Aliptae Moschatae ij.
pulverize them for a fume.

A mass may be confected of these Powders, with some dust of small coals, and a
fit liquor, which may be formed into Pastills, or Birds, or Cloves, which we
commonly call Cyprian Birds, which take fire without flame, and exhale a
suaveolent fume; and they are thus confected.

. Benioin j. Storax ij. Ladanum. ss. Aliptae Moschatae iij. small Coal ij. beat
all these into a fine Powder, and with Gum Traganth dissolved in Rose water,
make them up into a paste, of which form little Birds, Cloves, or what you
please.

Hippocrates (lib. de not. mulicb.) advises women whose flowers stay, twice
every day to receive the fume of a Suffiment through a tunnel pipe into their
privities, and it will move flowers. To which end such must first be elected as
calefy in the first, or at most in the second degree, afterward more vehement
may be used; yet with this caveat, that too sharp ones be not exhibited, lest
the head be burdened, or the neck of the uterus ulcerated. (Hip. lib. de
superfoetatione.)

Perfumes are destined to deduce the vessels, and to draw the uterus toward
the orifice, that the blood may easily profluate. But seeing the cunctation of
flowers proceeds from the durity and siccity of the uterus, the matter of
Perfumes must be received in some idoneous liquor, whereby the uterus may be
humectated, as in Wax, simple or odorate Oil, Turpentine, Ladanum, or Gum of
Tragacanthum, that Pastills may be formed thereof, which, when use requires,
may be injected upon burning coals, or rather ashes, as Aristotle in his
Problems thinks more convenient; as thus:

. The roots of Sow-bread, Asarum, Orris, Myrrh, Bdellium, ana j. Storax iij.
Nigella Romana. A Fumigation to move a woman's flowers, by sitting over the
Fume, and receiving it into her Privities.
Roman Gith ij. Cinnamon, Cloves, ana j. Savin, Marjoran, Calamint, Dictamus,
ana ij. Galliae moschatae j. make of these a Powder, or with Turpentine form
them into Pastills for future uses.

Perfumes are often successfully conducible in dysepulotical ulcers, and the
French disease, whereto other remedies have been frustraneous: but especially
if they be confected of Cinnabaris, wherein as also in Quicksilver, whereof it
participates, is an admirable faculty, and Alexiteries, which work the
exclusion of this venereous poison by salivation. For the fume hereof ascending
upon the whole body, does transmit it self through the spiraments of the skin
into the internal parts, and there by attenuating, impelling, and disjecting
the humor, at length deduces it to the mouth, and excludes it by frequent
sputation. And thus it does not only perfectly deleate the ulcers which infest
the throat, and internal parts of the mouth, but takes away the dolor, and
expells the matter which caused the tubercles and swellings. And this Perfume
is thus confected:

. Benioin, Frankincense, Olibanum, ana ij. Bay Berries, Calamus Aromaticus, ana
j. Cinnabaris x. make of these a Powder, and take liquid Storax to make it up
into a mass for fumigation. Or thus:

. Grains of Juniper, ^libanum, Mastich, Labdanum, ana j. ss. Cinnabaris j.
pulverize them for future use.

It may also be thus effected:

. Storax Benioin, Storax Olibanum, Labdanum, ana j. Myrrh ij. Galliae
moschatae ij. Mastich j. Cinnabaris j. ss. powder them, and with Turpentine
make them up into a mass for suffumigation.

But these Perfumes may not be adhibited without great prudence, lest they
should cause strangulation, resolution of the nerves, or palsy: for Cinnabaris
and Quicksilver beingof an indomitable nature, may not be exhibited, save by
an expert and perite Physician.

I saw a waiting man of our Kings so suffited by a woman, that through the
resolution of his recurrent nerves by the malign vapor of the fume, Historia.
lay (...), or speechless, two months, and so dyed.

I have observed others, by Empiricks undue preparation of Cinnabaris, brought
to a Palsy, that could not be repaired by Art.

I will not further prosecute the history of such as have been suffited by
Mountebanks.
Circulators, infested with dolours, and hence have contracted their death. For
if any Wretch infected with the French disease, have recovered his sanity by
the decoction of Guajacum, by the litation of Quicksilver, or by the
suffumigation of Cinnabaris, he will forthwith experience upon others the
effect of that which helped him. Hence many Tailors, Black-smiths, and very
Porters now at Lutetia, by these remedies undertake the cure of this disease,
and unhappily effect the contrary.

And now I think I have largely enough described in this, and the third Book,
all the Forms or receipts of Remedies. If any more be designed by the Ancients,
they may either be reduced to these heads, or thought obsolete. But if any
nauseative Critic disdain these our Lucubrations, and envy our Fame, the Lord
grant him more prudence: however, since he is malevolent, and displeasing to
all, I think it not a piacle to displease him. Now it is expedient that we
extruct a Shop for the benevolent Student in the Pharmaceutical Art.

Dignitati vestrae, humillime devotissimus, R. TOMLINSON.

The TRANSLATOR, by way of Preface to the READER.
WHEN we cast our eyes over the whole frame of the Earth, and contemplate upon
the immense bulk of Medicinal Materials, we cannot but wonder at Heavens
providential care of Man. Was there ever any malady that invaded this
Microcosm, but a suitable remedy was found for the same? How is the Earth
bedubbed with variety of Colors? what Bravery and Allurement does it carry in
its face? how does the juicy Vine flourish, and bedeck the Valleys with its
blushing Clusters? the pithy Elm ambitious to out strip the laquacious Hazle?
how is the hoary Chestnut planted with the Aromatic Juniper? the lofty Cedar
with the spinous Shrub? nay, the whole Globe coruscates, being brandished with
Autumn Fruit.

What could the Gods have done more for the benefit of man, than to have
ordained him to umpire in Paradise Terrestrial, creating for his use, the whole
universal mass serving him for Medicinal Materials, (of which we are now about
to treat) having infused into them distinct Remedies, with such an orient
splendor, that by the very beholding of them, they do allure our minds to seek
out remedy for every malady.

How has Nature framed some Vegetables, that they are affrightning to behold,
rough in handling, every way threatening damage by their prickles, that we may
even seem to hear them in a manner speaking in their own dialect, why they were
so created? Lest that ravenous wild beasts should devour them! lest audacious
and insolent hands should pluck them up! lest careless feet should trample upon
them! lest the fowls of the air should break them in pieces! So that being as
it were armed and fenced with these weapons, they do preserve themselves and
their virtues safe and sound, from all contingent accidents, for the Medicinal
use of Man.

The matter herein specified, need not fear the nipping frigidity of the
Northern Zone, being planted by the sacred hand of Jove, abundantly and spont
(...) spr^nting forth but of the nutilled sey^; as^ixing^ ^ith their to^^ (...)
wards.

What ^are we for watered Gardens, curious^y trimmed. Box Groves, neat garden
quarters bespangled with the variety of Star^like cotours, growing proud as it
were with the splendor of their variegated, far fetched flowers.

The spontaneous sproutings of the Earth is that we treat of; Pomona does
cherish her voluntary off spring with her own breasts; shall we judge Nurses
breasts sweeter than the Mothers? the Woods of the Medes, the pleasant and
sil^^er streams of Bacrra, and all Panchnia with its Thus bearing-soyl, give up
their offspring to the recovery of Man.

Ambergris, Camphor, Storax, Opium, Agarick, Scammony, can no longer now be
adulterated. To whom will not the true Amomum be known? Opobalsamum,
Carpobalsamum, and Cornu Unicornu, that Antidote against Poison so much boasted
of.

This Trcatise will quit you from the pains of turning over larger Tomes, and
the wearisomeness that accompanies it; here you may find the Willow Groves
struggling with the winds, shrouding lesser Plants under their preasant shades,
extending farth as it were a Canopy to secare them from the s^^rching beams of
the Sun, and the nipping frigidity of the Northern wind.

The illustrious adumbration of Plats of Herbs offering themselves as so many
embroidered Couches for tired Mortals to rest upon; whil^st be ruminates which
to pick and choose as most commodious for the recovery of his Malady, the whole
Creation affording him delight.

The Rives with their silver streams gliding musically from the rook, trampling
upon the sands of gold, lulling him to a complacency by their tacit bubblings,
conveying the moisture of Life to the banks of Herbs; whilst in the interim,
the sweet-singing Chorysters of the Woods thunder out whole Volleys of musical
strains, by tuning afresh their Organical Instruments; and all to allacriate
the spirit of Man.

As for those flashy Rhodomantadoes that go about to adulterate the best
Exoticks, laboring under as it were an idle Lethargy, deserve to bepunished
with stripes and hissed at as Serpents Dath not the Swallow easily find its
Chelidonium? and the Hawk its Ageratum? Has not the Creator of Vegetables
impressed certain Physiognomical notes in Plants, and imprinted in them as it
were so many Emblems and Characters, not only as marks and signs of their
occult virtues, but resemble with a sweet similiude the express figures and
pourtraitures of the parts unto which they are to be appropriated; and shall
these, by these vile Mimi, be injurionsly usurped and adulterated? its revenge
enough that they make the neselves to be jeered at, in attributing virtue to
that, which has no affinity nor propinquity to the place whergunty it applied.

The Pandects of Vegetables are no less defrauded of their natural ornament and
bonity, by the unskilful handling of some self-conceited Idiots. However, it
is not our desire to trim Ladies in Confectioners Shops; let them boast of
their Arras embroydered with Shadows, whilst we content our selves with the
true description of Natures rough draught of Plants, Animals, and Minerals, of
which we shall distinctly speak, or at least of so many as are necessary to the
composition of those Medicaments prescribed in the Shop.

Be pleased (whoever thou art) but to cast a favorable aspect upon this our
Translation, and it will seat you in the midst of the Elysian Fields, where you
may recreate your selves with pleasure and delight in be fair Groves of Rerum
Natura: but if you despise, and look upon it with scorn, it turns all into
fading and unprofitable branches.

THREE BOOKS OF IOANNES RENODAEUS, Physician in PARIS; Of such Medicinal
Materials as are requisite for Compositions made and kept in Apothecaries Shops.
Book I. Of Plants.
CHAP. I. Of Water.
WATER, which in a different respect may be taken for an Element, and an
Aliment, is not only the solace of Mankind, but the subsidy of all animate
and vegetative Creatures, which no living thing can be without. ( Arist. c. 2.
l. 4. de genesis animal.) For many Animals live without the use of Fire, without
the use of Water none, with which alone a Spanish Virgin did for a long time
preserve her life, ( Coel. Rhod. cap. 23. lib. 23.) Albertus saw a melancholic
fellow, who abstained from all food the space of seven weeks, refreshing
himself only every second day with a draught of Water. And Animals are not
solely generated and nourished by Water, but Plants also, which neither bud nor
flourish without its benign affluence, but become dry, tabid, and juiceless. As
on the contrary, the Tree planted by the Water side, Psalm. 1.
will yield its fruit in its season. Whence perhaps old Hesiod broached his
opinion, that Water was the most ancient of Elements. To which Thales accords,
who constitutes Water the first and sole principle of bodies. Of which opinion
was also Empedocles, who thought all things to be produced by Water. And one
Hippon, ( Arist. c. 2. l. 1. de anima) who called Water the Soul of the World;
and Hippocrates also, Aqua and ignis vita principia.
who constituted Water and Fire the principle of life. But Hippon meant by
Water, sperm; Hippocrates, the radical moisture.

Now the Water whereof we now treat, that is necessary to Mankind, either to
quench his thirst, or to coct and confect Aliments and Medicaments, is
elementary, often designed with the name of the frigid Element. And it is
either fontane, fluvial, puteal, or pluvial and cysternial. It is called
fontane water, a fundendo, because it is poured out of the earth, which is
preferred as most wholesome. Yet some fountains are impaired; for passing
through the bowels of the earth, they require aliene faculties, for they
mutuate their odor or sapour from the places through which they permeate: Thus
some, which are trajected through sulphurous passages, are so hot, that they
may not be used; others, because of those veins of Alume, and involutions of
Vitriol, are so acid and ungrateful, that a thirsty man would not taste them.
In Germany, beyond Rhene, there is a fountain of sweet water, whereof if one
drink, his teeth will fall out within two years.

In many parts of France there are Medicinal Waters of aliene, insuave, and
strange sapours, as the Pucensian Wells, whereunto people flock in multitudes
yearly, and return successfully. But I purpose not here to treat of these, it
shall suffice me to show at present what qualities water that is potable, and
requisitely necessary to an Apothecary in confecting Medicaments, should be
endued withal.

Now such water, according to Aristotle, (lib. de sensu and sensib.) should in
it self be the mixture, matter, and seminary of all spours; or as Galen ( c.
15. l. 1. etc. 2. l. 2. de alim.) writes, should be insipid, void of all
qualities, and most light, but not in weight, as some would hence infer, for
then Snow-water would be best, because lightest, which we know to be
unwholesome: but it should be of tenuious parts, quickly calefied, and quickly
refrigerated; such as fontane and fluvial water is, if it be pure; in defect
whereof, rain water, by Galen's advice, (lib. de Ptis.) may be assumed,
especially to the confection of Hydromel. Yet our College at Paris judge
Cisternine waters unwholesome, as being dead, and having contracted some vice
from the air from the spout through which, and from the trough into which they
delabe; for the shower that proceeds from air of an inquinated, pestilentious,
and putrified quality, must needs participate thereof; the shower that washes
the sides of houses, must needs be infected with corruption, or other filth,
especially if it wan^ motion, which is the foul of water. The shower that is
contained in a Cistern, though well grounded with sand, must needs be
corrupted, especially when abundance of impure water delabes, for then the sand
will putrify and inquinate it. Hence the water afterward running out of that
Cistern, is endued with a very bad odor and sapour, and is useless. The very
condition of rain accelerates its corruption, which being partaker of the airs
lenity, is quickly corrupted. Yea, many Authors of credit have writ, that many
Fishes have received detriment by rain, as the Muller, or Cestreus, whose eyes
are white, and they at that time very macilent. The best water therefore is
fontane, fluvial, and puteal water, so it be not muddy nor ferid, but insipid,
that is, endued with no manifest quality, nor mixed with any aliene sapour, as
of Salt, Nitre, Sulphur, Bitumen, Alome, or others of that kind. ( Gal.
comment. ad part. 10. lib. 4. ^pid.)

CHAP. II. Of Wine.
THE ancient Romans sacrificing to their Gods, continually offered Wine;
whence the Poet, Redduntur merito debita vina Jovi. For (says Plato) they
dedicated Wine to the Gods, that they might expel all cares from Men, and fill
their hearts with gladness; for Bacchus is the rest bringing God to afflicted
Mortals. Natures Storehouse contains nothing better than Wine, which is the
best Balsame to cure wounds, the most excellent Cordial to refresh the spirits,
and the most eximious Aliment to nourish the body; which its name seems to
denote: for it is called (...), that is, from helping, according to that of
Homer, If thou drinkest, thou will find help; for it letificates marts heart,
exhilarates his mind, makes his age florid, takes away sadness, cherishes
native calour, calefies his bowels, helps concoction, roborates the stomach,
takes away obstructions, prepares the passages for the exclusion of the
excrements, moves urine, resarciates the spirits, discusses flatuosity, obtunds
frigid poisons, attenuates, cocts and discuss^^^^ass humors. And that I may
comprehend its immense dignity in a few words, Wine is the blood of the earth,
old men's milk; life issuing from the Vine, that conserves life in others, yea,
and suppeditates them Aqua vitae; whence Alchymists call it the Elixar of life:
All which, when the Greek Poer had experienced and acknowledged as most true,
he did with such alacrity adore Wine, for Laudibus arguitur vine vinosus
Homerus; that he thereby attained not only the knowledge of abstruse Sciences,
but alsomost eximious eloquence; for Faecundi calices quem non fecere disertum?
For as it is vulgarly received, Wine acuates the ingenuity, and rouses the
spirits: Eunium and Aeschylum non scripsisse carniina, nisi vino fuerint madidi.
for which cause the Poet Ennius would never betake himself to the description
of Verses, unless he were first well madefied with Wine. Aeschylus also never
accinged himself to write Tragedies, unless he had first imbibed himself with
Wine. It is also storied of Lampris, that being then most apt to speak and
answer to the purpose, and discreetly, when he had ingurgitated much wine. He
was wont to say of himself, that he was like Frank incense, which never emits
its suaveolence, till it be well calefied. In wine there is eloquence, in wine
verity, in wine alacrity: for this, as the Proverb has it, will make an old
Wife dance. It was a Piacle among the H^orews, to abstain from wine; and a
custom among the Persians, never to treat and decrae of any serious matters,
till they had been well drunk, (Alex. ab Alex.) yet Galen says of Plato, that
he never permitted Soldiers, nor Servants, nor Princes, nor such as were to
consult about any matter, to drink wine liberally, because it would tyrannize
over the faculties of the soul; and taken in excess, enervate the strength, and
destroy sanity. Whence Hippocrates says; that in wine is sickness and sanity,
moderation and ferity, peace and war; according to that of the Poet, Vinum alit
lites, lites dissolvit easdem. Wine therefore is adiaphorous and indifferent,
good or evil, Vinum sanis robur.
a^ its use is good or evil. And as it is sanity and strength to the sane, so
it is infirmity to the infirm, and especially to such as are distempered from a
hot cause.

There are many sorts of wine differenced by their color, Vini differentiae
sapour, substance, odoar, virtue, and place; from their color, they are
called white, red, black, flave, claret, and palid wines; from their sapour,
sweet, austere, sharp, aceth, insipid; from their substance, crafs, thin,
feculent; from their odor, sweet, fragrant, inodorous; from their virtue,
vinous, aquous, polyphorous, multifarious, and oligophorous; from their place,
Falernian, Albane, Grecian: of which ancient wines we should drink moderately,
by Galen's advice, ( c. 6. l. 5. de sanit. tuend.) for they gravidate the head;
but we want all these: yet ours are no less vinous, as our Anrelian,
Burgundian, Andi^e, Ainian, Meudonian, Ruelliane, and Argentoliane, Qui primus
aquam vino miscu^rit.
which are generous wines, and need Amphiction, who first mixed water with
wine. And as in Banquets men get the best wine, so should we seek the most
generous and ^^^le in our Pharmacopolies for Medicaments, which are to be
assumed at the mouth, as Theriacal and Mithridative Confections; as also for
some that are to be extrinsecally applied, as many Salves and Unguents. There
is a water also distilled from these wines, easily contracting ardour and
flame, and eximious for many uses, which they call Aqua vita; as indeed there
is nothing in wine which is not eximious, as its odor, sapour, and spirits,
whereby man is not only refreshed, nourished, and cherished, but also many
Medicaments and Adjuments made out of its very lees and dregs, which the
Alchymists call Tartar.

CHAP. III. Of Vinegar.
VInegar, which the Greeks call (...), is sharp, or rather dead wine, for it is
produced out of vapid wine, destitute of its proper spirits, and innate calour:
and as Omphacy is elegantly termed wine increasing, so is Vinegar wine
decreasing, for wine is the mean betwixt both. And vinegar is more tenuious,
acute, and liquid than both, and therefore it does not concrete or congeal in
frost, if it be made of wine; which is the most salubrious and eximioius: for
that which in some Countries is made of stale beer, is insane, and should not
at all be used by an Apothecary in his Confectures: for when we put vinegar
absolutely, we mean wine-vinegar so confected by age or artifice, not by any
malignant mixture, which for its eximious qualities is used in kitchins to
Sauces and Condiments; in Pharmacopolies, to the preparation of Oxymel,
Lythargy, and other Compounds.

Now all vinegar is attenuative, incisive, discussive, repressive,
refrigerative, and somewhat calefactive, ( Gal. cap. 10. lib. 2. comp. med.
loc.) for old Homer acknowledges, that it retains in it some seeds of calour;
whence Galen says, ( cap. 19. l. 1. de simpl. med.) it is of a mixed quality;
for as milk is not all homogeneous, and similar, nor in all parts the same, so
neither is vinegar, which many say is calid, and many frigid. But such as have
truly perpended its faculty, find it for the most part more frigid than calid,
( cap. 20. ejusdem libri) And I much recede from their opinion, who think it to
be calid like a Cautery, or Pyro^ick; for by sense we find, that when it is
applied, it is at first sharp and refrigerative; but after its ablation, some
calour follows, which happens accidentally, and because of its acrimony, though
not always, nor to all bodies, ( c. 21. ejusdem libri.)

Hence we may collect, that vinegar is naturally frigid, but has acquired an
accidentary calidity; or as Galen speaks, ( cap. 23. ejusdem libri) neither
absolutely frigid, nor absolutely calid, participating of neither extreme; for
many things that consist of contrary and pugnant qualities, seem simple to the
sense, and are judged as neuters; for it is unavoydable that vinegar, having
lost its innate quality, should acquire another by putrefaction. Of which
opinion is Theophrastus and Aristotle; for the vinous parts of the wine
transeating into vinegar, must be refrigerated, and the aquous parts thereof by
putretude obtain an adventitious calidity, as all things else which putrefy,
do, ( c. 2. l. 4. simpl.) Vinegar then is a compound of parts of a contrary
quality, to wit, partly calid, partly frigid, as the ashes of burned wood. Yet
Vinegar is of admirable utility to Mortals; but it is more frequently used of
others, than of Apothecaries.

CHAP. IV. Of Omphacy.
OMphacy, What Omphacy is.
which the Greeks call (...), the Shopmen Agresta, is the juice of sour grapes
not yet come to maturity, not yet changed into Rob by the Suns calidity; such
was Dioscorides his Omphacium. But that we now have, is expressed like wine in
a winepress, out of grapes of perfect magnitude, but not maturity; then
percolated, reposed in hogsheads, and mixed with a little salt, and these by
progression would be wine, so wine by regression will be vinegar, which in its
virtues is very correspondent to Omphacy, for both are refrigerative, the
Omphacy more imbecilly, the vinegar more validly, because more te^^ous; which
also participates of more acrimony, which is calefactive by its adscititious
calidity. Acetum calidum and frigidum.
Therefore Aristotle said well, that vinegar was frigid by the innate calour of
the wine, and calid by the adventitious; which calour is not of sufficient
vigor to overpower the frigidity proceeding from its acidity. But Omphacy
has not the least of calidity in it, neither is it so tenuious, nor yet so
nimble, as with that expedition to permeate the pores and parts of the body as
vinegar; which being not only acid, but acerb, ( Gal. cap. 10. lib. 4. de
simpl. med.) is more conducible to the ardour of the Hypochondriacal parts than
vinegar; for it is not so violent, not is its frigidity mixed with any
mordacious calour; for such as are infested with excess of this calour, should
be mitigated without violence, or assumption of any Calefactive, or Medicament
endued with mordacious acrimony. Omphacium qu^bus profit.
And hence is it, that Omphacy is profitable for great ardours, ( Gal. cap. 2.
lib. 4. de simpl.) whether it be imposed on the orifice of the belly, or other
parts, that need re^^geration.

But it is most frequently assumed at the mouth, either mixed with Aliments for
pleasure, or with Medicaments for sanity; for broth altered therewith, is more
grateful to the jaws and palate; condiments acidulated therewith, revoke the
appetite. It also extinguishes the heat of the liver, and tempers the estuosity
of the bood (...) all which the sytup of Grapes will perform.

And though Omphacium may be made of any immature grapes, yet it is in France
deduced only out of those the white vine^ bring forth; whose branches being
longer, and more crass than others, serve to make Arbours in Gardens, and whose
clusters are as big as Olives; whereof, when mature, scarce any good wine can
be confected, but very good Omphacium when they are immature, as at the latter
end of Summer, or a little before Vintage time.

Oil educed out of immature Olives, is from its affinity in sapour to this
Omphacium, called Omphatical Oil.

CHAP. V. Of Sugar.
SUgar was unknown to the Ancients; which is now so copious, that to say a
Pharmacopoly without Sugar, were more than an Ironi^.
Irony. Yet it does not fall from Heaven like dew, nor is it gathered of Plants
leaves, as some have thought, who look only at the name: but it is got of an
arundinaceous Plant, which grows not only in India, but in many places of Asia
and Africa, and now in some Gardens in France; but it scarcely escapes secure
from the Winters tempests.

This sacchariferous Plant is about eight foot high, very crass, Planta
saccharifera.
knotty, obduced on every side with long, strait, and twined leaves, hollow,
sappy, and stuffed within with plenty of sweet juice, which will distill down
the cut cane like Amber; whose pith or sap being severed from the cane by a
knife, and cocted on the fire, will turn all into Sugar, save a little Salt at
the bottom of the vessel. Its roots emulate the roots of our Cane, but they
are not so ligneous, but more succulent and sweet, from which some sprigs
erupt, which if pulled up, and transplanted in due time, will grow and
flourish. It bears hairy flowers, like our reeds, which one thing is enough to
show that it is a reed.

The juice extracted from it, and but once cocted, is not sufficiently
elaborate, but is red, and thence called brown Sugar; by some, Sugar-froth;
which when it is cocted longer, and more defecated; will be white, and is
called Sugar absolutely. There comes Sugar from Madara and Canary, which is
extraordinary white, which as much excells the other in worth, as it does in
candor: yet some Negotiators bring some a little duller, which is as good as
the other. But many adulterate Madarensian Sugar, by washing common Sugar with
lixive, cocting it again, and absterging the nigritude from off it, by which
means they make it exceeding white, but not so sweet, and grateful.

Sugar Candy is thus made of common Sugar. Sac^arum candum quom^do fiat.
Let the Sugar be melted with a little water, and elixated like a crass syrup,
which inject into an earthen pot, wherein wooden sticks are put lattice-wise,
and cross one over another; set the pot on a board in a hot place, where leave
it for the space of fifteen or twenty days, then pour out the syrup that is
not concreted, and pour in a little warm water, to wash off the fatness of the
syrup, which again pour out, and repose the vessel in a hot place; take it on
the morrow, and break it, and you shall find the sticks laden with
Sugar Candy, shining like Crystal.

There is another kind of Sugar not so white, Powder-sugar.
nor yet so crass as the former, which is partly pulverated, partly redacted to
more crass lumps, which the vulgar call Cassonade, or Castonade; which is not
only used in Kitchins, but also in Shops.

That which is brought us from far Countries, is turbinated pyramidal-wise, and
commonly called Sugar Loaf, which is less cocted, and less obdurate than Candy,
and so less calid, and more accommodate to obdulcorate Condiments, Broths, and
other Aliments; for Sugar abates acrity, retunds acidity, gratifies austerity,
and makes all sapours more suave. Whence not only Confectioners, but Bakers
and Cooks frequently use Sugar, for no delicate Dish comes (...) the Table that
does not participate of Sugar; for if Water, Wine, Fruits, Flesh, Fish, or
other Edibles or Potables be nauscated, the mixture of a little Sugar will make
them current.

All Sugar is moderately hot, Vires.
conducible to the roughness of the tongue, asperity in the breast, and to the
cough; it moves spittle, but hurts the teeth, for it effects nigritude,
mobility, and rubiginy^^ them.

CHAP. VI. Of Honey.
AThenaus writes, that the Cyrians, Inhabitants of Corstea, are therefore
long-lived, because they daily use Honey: And Democritus being asked, how a man
might preserve his life long in sanity, answered, by anointing his interior
parts with Honey, his exterior with Oil, ( Gal. c. 11. l. de atten. vict.
rat.) For Honey being most sweet, propagates most tenuious juice. And ( c. 8.
l. 2. de facult. not.) begets in old men special good blood, in young and
bilious men much choler; for according to Actuarius, ( c. 8. l. de spir. anim.
mot.) that which is sweet in Honey, must needs be choler in the body.

And this mutation is very facile, because Honey, according to Paul, ( c. 4. l.
1. de synops.) and Oribas. ( l. 5. collect.) calefies and exsiccates in the
second degree, and has a kind of Acrimony conjoined with its sweetness, for
that is the best Honey which participates of these two, to wit, of sweetness
and acrimony, ( Gal. c. 17. l. de antidot.) new Wine expressed from sweet
Grapes, and cocted to the half or thirds, though it be not much inferior to
Honey in sweetness, yet like water it is obtuse, and no way vellicates the
sense.

Hon^^ alone is a Compound of it self, for it is collected of the juices of
many herbs and flowers, and is profitable to all ages, but especially to old
men, and such as are of a cold constitution (...) chiefly in winter time; for
where it meets with much calour, there it turns into choler.

Galen ( c. 5. l. 1. de alim fac.) Historia notanda.
derides the concertation of two men, the one whereof affirmed Honey to be
wholesome, the other unwholesome, both conjecturing from the effect it had
wrought in themselves: but neither of them understood, that man kept not one
temperament from the beginning to the term of his life; nor yet if the
temperament had been one, that the decurse of years would work some change in
it; for the one of them was old and phlegmatic, the other young and choleric.

Now Honey, according to Galen, ( c. 177. l. de simpl. med.) Mel quid.
is the juice of Celestial Dew collected by Bees; for every Aliment is desumed
either from Animals or Plants, Honey is from neither; for it arises from the
leaves or flowers of Plants, Vnde fiat.
and yet it is not their juice, nor fruit, nor any part thereof, but the same
with Dew, ( c. 38. l. 3. de alim. fac.) and yet not so copious nor assiduous.

Yet something from Plants tends to its benignity or malignity, ( Orib. c. 62.
l. 2. collect.) for that is poisonous which is collected of poisonous Plants,
as Wolfs-bane, ( Paul. Egin. c. 52. l. ^.) that bitter which is brought out of
Pontus, where great store of Wormwood abounds.

That Honey is best which in color is pale, Mel optimum.
in consistency neither crass, nor concrete, nor yet dilute, but alike in all
parts; which besides its sweetness, participates of the acrimonious sapour of
Thyme, but no perceptible part thereof in odor, according to Oribasius, ( c.
62. l. 2. collect.

And as Honey by long coction, so by long keeping i will grow bitter; for Galen
says, ( c. 11. l. 1. de antidot.) that he kept Athenian Honey, which we
account the best, so long, as in amaritude it resembled that which the Bees
collect in Pontus. It were supervacaneous to treat any more of Honey, since we
have abundantly spoken thereof in the third Chapter of the third Book of our
Institutions.

CHAP. VII. Of Manna.
MAnna is the most excellent and divine gift of Nature; and not only that
which God preternaturally bestowed on the Israelites, but this also which like
Honey or Sugar-dew, distills upon leaves, and daily offers it self for our use.
For our vulgar Husbandmen do no less admire their small Manna, than the
Israelites did their Sugar-hail, whilst exulting, they sing, Jupiter rains
Honey down; whence it is called Areomel, by the Arabians Terenjabin, and in the
sacred Scriptures Manna; with which our Manna, or Manna Thuris, accords only
in name; which is produced by the elision of two bundles one against another;
for thereby certain small fragrancies are congested, which is collected for
Manna Thuris. There is also another kind, they call Manna Larigna, collected
of the broken boughs of the Larix tree; but both these too licentiously usurp
this title: for Manna properly so called, which is used by Physicians, (for I
do not speak of the Man-h^, or Manna of the Hebrews) is celestial dew, sweet
and grateful, delabing about the dayspring upon the boughs and leaves of
trees and herbs, which speedily concretes into the consistency of a gum.

That is best which is collected of leaves, and is called Manna de folio; and
that worst, which is called Manna de terra. Now the Calabrian Manna, especially
that which comes out of a certain part of Oenotria, is thought the best, where
it descends every Summer, and is gathered of all. (Brassavel. in exam. fimpl)

Brassavelus tells us, Historia.
how the Neopolitan Kings once occluded this place, that none might assume it
without toll or tribute; but the Manna thereupon ceased to descend; the tribute
being taken off, and the hindrances removed, the Manna again descended; the
place being again occluded, it ceased; the enclosure or hedge being again taken
away, it descended: so that the Kings were glad to leave it free, and permit
any to collect it that would. The same is storied of the Tragasaan of Salt in
Epirus, up (...) which when Lysimachus imposed a tribute, there was none to be
found; when the tribute was contradecreed, the Salt redounded. (c. 12. l. 9.
Rhod. Call.)

But that I may not further rove; there is a k^^de of Manna in France, commonly
called Manna Briansonnensis, which Medicks sometimes use for want of
Calabriensis: but it is not near so good.

There is another kind round, called Manna Mastichina, Manna m^sichina.
which beaten from the boughs and leaves of trees by the impetuousness of the
wind, which delabes like hail, but neither from Heaven, nor from the Air;
which is improperly called Manna, being the tears of trees, or their juice
concreted.

Manna is moderately hot, it lenifies the throat, asper-artery, and breast; it
benignly moves the belly, and purges watery humors, especially the small Manna;
as that which comes from Calabria, not Terenjabin, which the Arabians say is
like Honey; which we use not, because we want it.

CHAP. VIII. Of Cordial Flowers; and first, of Violets.
A Violet, which the Greeks call (...), grows in opake and rough places, at the
foundations of walls, or margins of gardens, and sometimes in meadows; it is
green all the year long, and flourishes sometimes in February, most frequently
in March, whence it is called Mars his Flower; and sometimes in Autumn, if it
be cultivated; it leaves are like Ivy leaves, but less and thinner, of a short
stalk, in the end whereof grows a Flower of a ceruleous purple color, and
odor like Flower de luce. It brings forth a small seed in little round leaves
about the end of Summer.

Now Violets are multifarious, and different in colors; for some are white,
some blew, and other in a mean betwixt both. There are some also which stand
upon longer and harder stalks, whose flowers are like a purple color; others
which are tricolorous, and grow upon quadrate, slender, succulent and reptile
stalks in dry places, whose leaves are more angust, long and lascivious than
others: from its threefold color some call it the herb Trinity, others the
flammeous Violet, and the vulgar Frenchmen the Minute pensea.

Other small stocks of Violets have got names, which because Phyficians seldom
use, we omit. But the martial Violets are wholly used, for their flowers being
endued with an exhilarating faculty, Vires.
are mixed with Cordials, their seeds and leaves being malactical, ingrede the
decoction of Glysters, and confection of Cataplasms. All men conclude, that
their Flowers are refrigerative; yet that acrimony they leave in the mouth by
mastication, speaks them to participate of some calour. But because that calour
is fugitive, being overcome by their exuberant frigidity, the Medicks judge
them to be frigid.

CHAP. IX. Of the Flowers of Bugloss.
BUgloss, so termed from its similitude to an Oxes tongue, because it is
eximious in inducing hilarity, is by Dioscorides and Pliny called (...); it
has long, broad, rough leaves, like Cumfrey, but straiter, shorter, and not of
so obscure a green. Its stalks are bicubital, brachiate, rough; its flowers
replenished with spots like stars, ceruleous, shining, in the bottom whereof
is a long, obscure, pithy seed. Its root is long, crass, black without, white
within, succubent, sweet; it grows in gardens, in fandy, and also in plain
places.

There is no variety neither in nature nor shape amongst the Hortensian
Buglosses, only the flowers of some are white, of others purpureous, and
vulgarly ceruleous. But the wild ones differ much: for some are always green,
which will like in any region; others are very sharp, whose leaves are rigid
with prominent pricks, which by some are mistaken for Anchusa, so named from
the blood wherewith its root infects the tangent.

Bugloss is of a hot and moist, or rather a middle temperature; whence it is
reckoned amongst the exhilarative Plants, which Galen was not ignorant of, when
( c. 80. l. 6. de simpl. med.) he wrote, that Bugloss immerged in Wine would
cause joy and hilarity.

CHAP. X. Of Borrage flowers.
BOrrage is an herb notorious enough; its leaves and faculties bear an affinity
with Bugloss, for both their leaves are long, resembling a Neats tongue: but
Borrage leaves are shorter and broader, which the rigor of the winter soon
corrupts and kills: but Bugloss bears it out, and grows; but especially its
root, and those leaves that are next ground flourish. It bears broad ceruleous
flowers, and sometimes white, larger than Bugloss, in the midst whereof, as in
its center, is defixed a certain dusky crown, whose end is acuminated. It grows
in any ground, but it is more florid in humid and fat soil. It is fresh all
Summer, and also all Autumn, if it be sown later; its seed is black; in all
other things it responds to Bugloss.

Its flowers put into broth give a special taste, and subduce the belly; and
taken in Wine, they cause great joy and pleasure; according to that old saying,
Ego Borrago gaudia semper ago. Its flowers in Condiments recreate the eyes and
jaws, and in Medicaments augment their cordial faculties.

There is another Plant very like this, Borrago semper virens.
which they sometimes call Bugloss, sometimes Borrage, always green; for it
resembles both their form and nature, and is thought to prepoll in the same
faculties. It grows in Plains, and is sown and kept in Gardens by such as
delight in variety of Simples.

CHAP. XI. Of the four common Emollitives, and first, of Mallows.
THere are four common emollitive Herbs, Mallows, Marshmallows, black Violet,
and Bears-breech, or brank Ursine; whereunto other four less famous are
adjoined, to wit, Mercury, Pelitory of the wall, Sicla, commonly called Beat,
and Arach, whose use is celebrated in making the decoctions of mollitive
Glysters, and Cataplasms.

Now Mallows is so denominated from its mollifying quality; Malva unde dicta.
and it is either Hortensian, which by culture and mangony will grow to a tree,
and acquire great procerity; or Sylvestrian, which is well enough known to all;
for it abounds every where with thick cireinated and angulous leaves; it puts
forth flowers all Summer long of a pale purple color; its roots are small,
long, and lignous; its seed small, smooth, and orbicular.

There are many sorts of Mallows. Malvarum differentiae.
The first of that name is that which importunely germinates in every way side,
or court.

The second is not so copious, which is smaller, with lesser boughs, growing
about rude and incultivated places near Villages, with flowers of a pale purple
color.

The third is called the Mallow tree, Arborescens.
which like a shrub sprouts up to the height of six or eight cubits.

The fourth is called Althea, by the Latins Bis-malva, and Ibiscus, because of
the multiplicity of its faculties; for it has malvaceous, smooth, long, hoary,
and somewhat clipped; whiter flowers, and seeds like other wild Mallows.

Its roots are crass, long, round, divaricated into many circles, and pregnant
with much juice; its sprigs that grow besides it put forth malvaceous, long,
hoary, and tomentaceous leaves, white flowers, and small, plain, and round
seeds, like other Mallows. It calefies in the first degree; it has a digestive
and laxative faculty, and will coct mucaginous excrements.

The fifth is called Alcea, Alcea.
which is like Mallows in its original and stalk, but deeper cut; out of its
root proceeds abundance of shrubs half a cubite long, adorned with red flowers;
which fallen off, we may see a round seed like other Mallows.

The sixth is called Transmarina, Transmarina.
and Rosacea, from the elegancy of its flower, like a Rose. It is known in all
parts, for it is sown and cultivated almost in every Garden; it puts forth its
branches at the beginning of the Spring.

Some sorts of Ibiscaes are referred to the kinds of Mallows, to wit, the
Althea that grows like a tree, the Althea that grows like a fen, and the Althea
of Theophrastus, which bears yellow flowers. There are also as many sorts of
Alcea, to wit, the common, foreign, and shrubby, which is Cinquefoil.

All Mallows is mollitive, Vires.
and thence it is denominated; and its leaves decocted are good for the
shingles; and it is good against poisonous stings, and the dolours excited by
Bees or Wasps.

CHAP. XII. Of Acanthus, or brank Vrsine.
THE name Acanthus is not only referred to such Plants (...) are spinous, as
Carduus, but also to such as prick not, as to the Artichoke, and brank Ursine,
which the Shopmen call Acantha, many Marmoraria, because its leaves are
engraven in marble Chapiters.

Dioscorides says, it grows in Gardens and moist places, and puts forth long,
broad, smooth, fat, blackish leaves, cut like a nettle; its stalk is of two
cubits length, smooth about the thickness of a finger, and on every side from
the middle upwards involved with little long leaves accuminated like nucaments,
but not spinous, out of which a white flower proceeds; its seed is long and
dusky, its top is like the top of a sprig.

Its roots are juicy, long, red, and glutinous, which are of little or no use
in Physic; though made into a Liniment, they are good for burnings; and drunk,
move urine, and conduce to the good of such as are tabid, for their leaves
only are desumed to the decoction of Glysters and Cataplasms, to which use
solely the whole Plant is destinated, and got by Apothecaries.

Some say it is called brank Ursine, because its leaves resemble the fore feet
of Bears. We find it also called Paederota, and Melaniplyll^m.

We have abundantly before treated of Violets, which are also reckoned among
the mollitive Plants in the first degree, and shall not need to superadde any
more.

CHAP. XIII. Of other Mollitives; and first, of Mercury.
THis Herb derives its name from Mercury its Inventor, whence the Greeks call
it (...), but more frequently Linozostis. There are two kinds of it: the first
is called the masculine, the second the feminine Mercury; the branches of both
are round, light, rough, with some genicles, a cubite high, brachiate; there
are many long leaves cut about like a Saw, like sweet Basil, all about the
stem. In the leaves of the masculine there are two seeds joined together, which
cohere with little feet, like Goose-grass. Small ears come out of the feminine,
with mossy flowers thereon; which if they wither, no seed follows.

It is green all Summer, dead in Winter, springs again in the Spring; its
faculty is chiefly to exonerate the belly. And there is a Honey made of its
juice, they call the Mercurial Honey, which will excite the drowsy expulsive
faculty, and deterge the belly.

There is also a third kind of Mercury, called Cynocrambe, or wild masculine
Mercury, which grows all over by high ways, and humid places; which, because
it has much affinity with the masculine, it has pleased learned Authors to
denote it by that name.

CHAP. XIV. Of Pelitory of the Wall.
THE many names that Pelitory of the wall has put upon it, has caused learned
men to doubt which is the true Herb, or it due name. It is most frequently by
Apothecaries called Helxine, of which name Dioscorides describes two Plants.
The first is firnamed Cissampelos, and it is a kind of convolvulus, which
grows in hedges, and circumeats the vicine Plants: the other in walls and
maceries; whence it is called Parietaria, or mural Herb, as also Helxine,
because it adheres to ones clothes; it emits small, pale, mossy flowers, and
very rough leaves, which being good to wipe and exterge glass cups with, are
thence called Vitreols. I find it also called by some, the Herb of the wind,
but Anemone challenges that name by better right. But since Pelitory of the
wall is so notorious, it needs no further description.

It is refrigerative and detersive, and cures inflammations. If it be fried
with Oil or Butter, and applied to the region of the reins, it eases the dolor
of the gravel there, and accelerates its exclusion by reserating the passages;
and therefore it is duly instituted by Fer^elius an Ingredient in the
confection of the syrup of Althea.

CHAP. XV. Of Beat and Arach.
Beat is either red, Beta. Atriplex.
which they commonly call the black Beat, or white, or yellow, for so many
sorts are found by their colors. Now the red Beat is twofold; one is our
common red Beat, which is not distinct from others in root, or leaves, but
only in color; the other is the Roman Beat, which is somewhat blacker,
having a very crass root like Rape, whence it is called Bete-rape, and by many
very properly Erythrorise; by Fuchius, the red Rape, but very improperly.

The white is received most in meats, yet its juice may well be used in
Errhins, for its nitrous faculty will deduce phlegm out of the brain. And hence
we may gather, that Beat is not so fatuous and insipid as Martial thought, for
it troubles and loads the stomach, and nourishes little; and therefore few but
Rusticks and poor people eat it, unless it be to move the belly; and especially
the white, which moves and exonerates the belly, as the red does the bladder;
and therefore it is most accommodate to the confection of Diacassia.

Atriplex, commonly called Arrochy, by the Greeks, (...), is not without reason
reckoned amongst the mollitive Herbs; for amongst Pot Herbs, none subduces the
belly more efficaciously and easily than it.

For it refrigerates in the first degree, humectates in the second, and is void
of all sapour; it is of a watery and uliginous nature, and therefore quickly
permeates the inferior parts, and opens the belly.

CHAP. XVI. Of the five Capillaries; and first, of the true Maidens-hair.
THere are five Herbs which have much affinity one with another, to wit, the
true Capillus Veneris, or true Maidens-hair; Capill. Vener.
the common Maidens hair, Asplenium, or Wall-fern; Citrarch, Herbae capillares
unde habeant nomen.
commonly called Polytrick, or Spleen-wort; and Salvia Vita, or Wall-rue. Some
would have Epithymus, and Bind-weed, or Dodder, to be true Capillaries, because
they resemble hairs and Capillaments; whereas these five Herbs are not called
Capillaries so much from their external form, as that faculty wherewith they
color hairs, and resartiate their defect.

The true Maidenhair is most frequently found in the Narbonian Tract;
sometimes, but seldom, in other colder parts of France: that which in one year
flourished at Lutetia in the Garden of Joannes Gomerius the expert Apothecary,
the rigor of the Winter killed ere another year circulated.

It is a small Herb, without stalk, flower, and seed, growing in mountainous,
rocky, shady, moist places, and in the brinks of fountains; in stead of a stalk
it has many hairs, whereon small, slender leaves, not unlike the leaves of
Coriander, do adhere; whence Mesue calls it the Coriander of the sountain. But
the name Adian^^m was given it, as Theophrastus attests, because being long
infused in water, as all the other sorts of Capillaries also, (...), i. e. it
will not be madefied. But this assertion fails in long maceration, for being
long immerged in water, it will be madid, as other Herbs.

Galen ( lib. 6. de simplic. med.) says, that Adiantum, Vires.
as to calidity and frigidity, is symmetral; it deficcates, extenuates,
digests, repairs the loss of fallen hairs, discusses swellings and impostumes;
being drunk, it breaks stones, and admirably helps all the affections of the
breast, liver, reins, and spleen. Its virtues are profusely described by Mesue,
(c. 20. de simpl.)

CHAP. XVII. Of Common Maidenhair.
BEsides the true Adiantum, De Adianto vulgari.
which is the proper Maidens-hair, Theophrastus ( cap. 13. lib. 7.) makes
mention of two other small Plants of the same name, to wit, white and black
Adiantum, both whose branches are of a nitent black color, their leaves alike,
to wit, rugged, thick, and one side consperged with little red spots, their
faculties similar: but the one putting forth little stalks or nerves blacker
than the other, is called black Adiantum. Their mistake is damnable to the
sick, who instead of each, desume Dryopteris, of Oak-fern.

Some credulous persons think it a miracle, that Adiantum infused in water,
should not be madefied, but should so withstand its humidity, as always to
appear dry, from which event it desumed this denomination; but its longer
demersion in water shows the contrary. Some think it so called rather, because
it is not madefied with the descent of rain, like as we see in Fern; or because
it thrives in the margins of fountains and walls that encompass waters, and yet
cannot endure to be touched by water; as we see Swallows, which delight to
build their nests in men's houses, but will not suffer themselves to be handled
by men.

Adiantum emits out of its slender root compacted of small filaments, certain
exile sprigs, strait, half a hand high, and sometimes longer, sometimes of a
whiter, sometimes of a blacker green, circumvested with little soft leaves,
after the manner, positure and rite of a fern, but much more small, more green
on one side, less on another, and maculated with some spots. It grows best in
opake places, it is always green, never scatters its leaves, but is destitute
of all flowers and seed.

Its faculties are commended for many purposes, for it prohibites the falling
of hairs, and repairs their loss; it helps such as are pursy, and short
breathed; it moves flowers, discusses swelling in the neek, and produces the
same effect with true Maidens-hair, or Capilus Veneris.

CHAP. XVIII. De Polytricho; or, of Polytriche.
AS three Plants are comprehended under this one name Adiantum, so three names
design one Plant. Polytrich^^.
For perite Herbalists take Trichomanes Polytrichum, and Callitrichum, are all
the same Herb; for Trichomanes is by the Romans called a Capillary, because it
compleats the place void of hairs. Polytrichum is so called, because it makes
the hair come thicker; and Callitrichum, because it makes the hair more comely.
( Ruel. c. 133. l. 3.)

Some call this Herb Pinula, others Filicula, and some Adiantum.

It grows upon walls, and in opake and shady places, and about the margins of
fountains, or in dens, as Adiantum does. Its root is small and black, out of
which there issues little nitid, rigid, dusky sprigs, like Capillaments. It
has leaves on both sides, very orderly disposed, and adversly pediculated,
like to Lentils in magnitude and form, but more tenuious, and maculated
underneath with ferrugineous spots.

It neither bears seed nor flowers, like Adiantum, wherewith also it agrees in
reference to its faculties.

CHAP. XIX. Of Ceterach, or Spleen-wort.
ALL the society of Pharmacopolists stood long in this error, Ceterach.
that Scolopendrium and Heminionis; commonly called Hartstongue, were one and
the same Plant; till better informed, either by the bare words or writings of
Physicians; they were convinced, that Splenium, commonly called Ceterach, was
the true Scolopendrium. Its leaves are small, divided like Polypody, yellowish,
rough, narrow, and corrugated underneath, adhering to a blackish pedicle scarce
a palms length, disposed in an adverse order; yet not so; that they are
directly opposite one against another, like the leaves of the Polytriche, but
that they oppose each others interstice, as of some Polypody.

It is found in rocks, opake walls, and such stony and shady places, insisting
upon no stalk, save a small pedicle, crowned with no flower, and gravidated
with no seed.

Its faculty is to minuate the spleen, to break and expel the stone, Vires.
to move urine, to abate singulture, and cure the Jaundies.

CHAP. XX. De Salvia vita, or Rue-maidenhair.
THis Plant is next in affinity to a Capillary, Salvia vita.
which from the similitude of the leaves, and the congruity of place wherein
Rue and it grow, is called mural Rue, and by the Shopmen, Salvia vita. It
thrives best in opake rocks, wet stones, old edifices and caves, which as it
were dividing the rocks, proceeds out of their incisures, with thin, short and
slender stalks, whereon little but crass leaves adhere; divided, and of a
whitely green color, very like to Rue.

The whole Plant is scarce as long as a man's palm, devoyd of seed and slowers,
always green; and therefore it is often used in winter, when other Plants are
either withered or eradicated.

Vires.
It reserates the excrementitious passages, takes away obstructions, moves
excrements, exsiccates watery humors, and thence conduces to the stoppings of
the spleen and mesenteries; it moves flowers and urine, expells the stone,
cures the dropsy, and helps diseases within the breast. They are mistaken that
think this is Fellon-grass.

CHAP. XXI. Of some other Plants that are of the second sort of Capillaries;
and first, of Moon-fern.
Hemionitis.
THis Herb is from the efficacy of its faculties, wherewith it respects the
spleen, called by Pharmacopolists, sometimes Asplenium, sometimes
Scolopendrium, as also Ceterach, because in curing the affection of the spleen
it has the precellency: yet it is neither Scolopendrium, Asplenium, nor common
Ceterach, but a distinct Plant destitute of stalk, seed, and flower, only a
company of leaves issuing out of the earth; whence it is often called
Phyllitis, that is, a folious herb; for its root emits many fibrous and
blackish leaves upon as many filaments, which leaves are crass, rigid, long
like Hearts tongue, as it is sometimes denominated, smooth on the upper side,
rough on the lower, with transverse ferrugineous lines. Gaza calls it Mula.

It is of great use to the spleen, Vires.
whose obstructions it does not only remove, but abates its durity and
obtumescence, and successfully helps the affections of the liver.

CHAP. XXII. Of Dodder and Epithymum.
DOdder grows upon fruitful Herbs, like Epithyme, Dodder epithymus.
destitute of a root; but as Matthiolus faith, issues out of the stalk of a
Plant like a wing, or long capillament. It grows most abundantly about Line,
whence the Shopmen call it, Lines Podagry.

Fuchsius not without reason believes, that Dodder at first proceeds from some
root, which withers and perishes when its capillaments do involve a plant, from
which it may suck nutriment; and thence it is that the temperament and quality
of the Dodder changes according to the variety and nature of the Plants which
it involves. And many think, that Dodder and Epithyme differ not, save that the
one grows on Line, the other on Thyme.

Yet Matthiolus will not suffrage herewith, but contends, and that by testimony
from Galen, that both the form and qualities are in them different; for
Epithyme calefies in the third degree, and Cuscuta only in the second; but
here it only follows, that Epithyme borrows its calefactive quality from
Thyme, Cuscuta from Line. They do very dangerously mistake, who take the
podagry of other Plants for true Cuscuta and Epithyme.

Neither of them have any leaves, they are only hairy, putting forth slender
capillaments, like Cittern strings, out of which issues forth small flowers
like glistering stars, gravidated with small seeds, which ingrede the
composition of the laxative syrup of Succory and Rhabarb.

It is abstersive and roborative, it cures the obstructions of the liver and
spleen, moves urine, helps the jaundies, and is good for all affections
proceeding from choleric and melancholic humors.

CHAP. XXIII. Of the five Apertive Roots; and first, of Smallage-root.
THere are many apertive roots, five whereof precell the other in dignity,
three whereof grow in Gardens, to wit, Petroseline, Sperage, and Fennel; two in
places uncultivated, Smallage, and Butchers-broom.

Smallage.
Apium in Latin, and (...) in Greek differ much, as also Parsley and
Petroseline.

For Apios, according to Dioscorides, ( cap. 177. lib. 4.) has leaves like
Rue, short, and growing on three or four stalks lying along on the ground, and
on a root that is extrinsecally black, intrinsecally white, formed like a Pear,
which will move the body both by vomit and stool, though not vehemently. Yea
Apios is sometimes taken for a root like a Pear in form; and sometimes for some
juice that is insipid, or at least of an imperceptible sapour.

Whereas Apium properly so called, which Dioscorides names seline, or
cleofeline, is very like Parsley, but greater, and effects the same with
Parsley: but because of its ungrateful odor and sapour, is excluded the
lociety of Pot Herbs.

It grows most commonly in uncultivated and moist places, whence it is properly
called Paludapium, or Rustic Smallage.

It is hot in the second, Its virtues.
and dry in the third degree, ( Gal. l. 8. simp.) it moves flowers and urine,
discusses flatuosity, and its seed is more efficacious than the Herb it self.
Pliny says, it cures Spiders poison. Its root is frequently usurped to deduce
the passages, to remove obstructions, and it is thought that its leaves eaten
conduce much to the lungs.

CHAP. XXIV. Of Petroseline.
THat which the Ancients called Garden-Apium, Petroseline.
and Parsley, we call Petroseline; it is most common in Gardens, and most
frequently used in making broth, and dressing meat; it grows no where save in
Gardens, and there most redundantly, whether they be hot or cold; it refuses no
soil; if it be cultivated and fat, and suppeditate humor whereon it may live;
its seed germinates the latest of all, to wit, about forty or fifty days after
its sature.

It bears leaves like Coriander, crisped; roots it has, long, and capillated,
which are pleasant for Aliments, and useful for Medicaments.

It is given to such as are troubled with the stone, Vires.
jaundies, and difficulty in ureting, and to such women as have not their
flowers proceeding in due time.

CHAP. XXV. Of Sperage.
THE name Asparagus is given to this Herb, Asparagus.
either because it grows upon a rough, sharp shrub, or its stalk being full of
pricks, or else because it grows spontaneously without sature. For many grave
Writers have attested, that it does grow out of a horn of a Ram contunded and
perforated: yet the recent buds, and slender germination of this and other such
Plants that may be cropped for Pot Herbs, were called in former times Sperages.

Now Sperage is either wild, or sative, and both notorious enough, putting
forth many sprigs, and many little, long and slender leaves, which like Fennel,
end in Capillaments.

This Pot-herb delights in siccity, and perishes by frequent rigation; yet if
it be irrigated in Autumn, it will put forth tender and succulent buds.

It proceeds from round roots, in number many, Vires.
which are apertive, deduce the passages, remove obstructions from the liver
and reins, cure the suffusion of the gall, move flowers and urine.

CHAP. XXVI. Of Fennel.
ALL the parts of Fennel are useful; Fennel.
for its tender branches mixed with sour Condiments, make them more grateful;
its seed decocted with Senny, discusses all that that causes flatuosity, and
wringings in the guts; yea either mixed with others, or assumed alone, it
effects innumerable benefits; its roots alone, without other mixture, remove
obstructions.

It is a kind of ferulaceous Plant, sometimes exceeding a man's height; its
stalk is geniculated, filled with a fungous sap; its external cortex is smooth
and green, its leaf like Maiden-weed, slender, long, soft, capillaccous, and
suaveolent; its muscary or top, round, patulous, broad, and circulated, whereon
there depends a nude, long, and pale seed; its root is long, crass, white, and
odoriferous.

There are two kinds of Fennel; one the Greeks call Marathrum, which also is
twofold; the one sweet, which is copious in Italy; the other common, whose
seed is less, and sharper.

The second sort they call Erraticum, or Hippomarathrum, from its magnitude;
for it exceeds the sative Parsley in crassitude and procerity, and grows in
Mauritania, sometimes twelve cubits in height, four palms in thickness; its
seed is like Millet seed, its root white, and suaveolent.

Fennel calefies only in the second degree, Vires.
or beginning of the third.

Being drunk in wine, it helps the poison of Serpents, moves flowers and urine,
generates milk, and (...) suffusion.

Hippomarathrum is more efficacious in all things? for it po^^ntly expells
flowers and urine, ejects stones, purges the Kings evil, yea nothing so good
against the poison of Serpents.

Some will have wild Parsnip to be a kind of Fennel, its stak and muscary
being feniculaceous: but their leaves, color, odo^^, sapour, virtue and form,
are very dissimilar. This Herb is called by some, Harts-eye; by others, Gratia
Dei.

CHAP. XXVII. Of Ruscus, or Butchers-broom.
Ruscus, Ruscus.
or Bruscus, seem to be a spinous Myrtle, or wild Butchers broom, for it has
the form and leaves of a Myrtle, but they are more rigid, hard; macronate, and
inodorous. Certain red berries adhere to its virgults about the magnitude of
Cherries, wherein two or three nuts are enclosed, of such osseous durity, that
they will scarce admit of pulveration by triture.

Another Plant, called Hypogloss, and Laurus Alexandrina, has some affinity
herewith, but its leaves are softer and larger, out of the middle or superior
part whereof little leaves, like little tongues, proceed.

It grows in rude and uncultivated places; Vires.
the decoction of its root moves flowers, breaks and expells the stone, cures
stranguty, and the jaundies.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of the four greater frigid Seeds.
THese four are the Seeds of Gourd, Quatuor frig. major.
Cucumber, Melons, and Citrulls, under which many oleraceous Fruits are
contained, which by the Ancients are denoted by this name (...); yea there is
such affinity amongst these, that their nomenclatures seem to be indeterminate
and indistinct; for many under the name Cucumber comprehend Melons and Pepons;
under Cucurbites, Citrulls and Melo-pepons.

But culture and mangony has effected many sorts of each; Cucurbitarum
differentiae.
for they have designed four sorts of Cucurbites, the greater, the lesser, or
the lagenarious, or the anguine, the long and blew one, besides Coloquintida,
which is a wild Cucurbite.

Cucumber is either sylvestrian, Cucumeres.
which is called the asinine Cucumber, of whose juice an Elatery is confected;
or sative, of which there are many sorts; for some are long, strait, and
yellow; others shorter, green, and crooked; some compressed, broad, and round;
others clypeiformous, and are commonly called Pepons.

Melons, by the French so called, Melones.
are by the Italians named Pepans, by Dioscorides, Melopepons; by the Ancients,
domestic Cucumbers. But to avoid the confusion of names, it is expedient we
call those Fruits, which springing from the sative Sicya, (for so is the Plant
whereon Melons grow, named) are fragrant like Quinces, or such redolent Apples,
Melons; whereof, as well as of the rest, there are many sorts: for some from
the suavity of their odours, and sapour, are called Moschatelline, others
Saccharine Melons; others from the soil and region wherein they grow, acquire
other denominations.

Citrulls in magnitude exceed all the former which abound in the Country,
whereof also there is much variety both in color, figure, Citrulli.
magnitude, and sapour; for some are short, others long; some plain, others
round; some are unequal, others yellowish, which excel the rest in suavity.

And as these four Plants have mutual affinity in their form, so also in their
faculties. Their seeds collected are the four greater frigid seeds, which are
preserved for frequent use in Pharmacy.

CHAP. XXIX. Of the four lesser frigid Seeds; and first, of Lettice, and its
seed.
LEttice, or Lactuce, Quatuor frig. minor.
is so called from the exuberance of lacteous juice that may be expressed from
it; which is the first of Oils: for as it is most grateful in Edibles and
Condiments, so is it most salubre in Medicaments; for besides its faculty in
generating laudable blood; it extinguishes the fervor of the blood and bowels,
conciliates sleep, and helps such as labor of hectic Fevers, ( Gal. c. 40.
l. 2. de alim. etc. 13. l. de maras.) and it is a most familiar alimentous
Medicament, much conducing to young and choleric natures.

It may be sown at any time; and if the soil be fat, well subacted, and exposed
to the Sun, it will flourish, and largely diffuse it self. If it be plucked
while it is tender, and be transplanted into another soil well stercorated, it
will abundantly emit circumvolved leaves, and be capitated.

As no Pot-herb is more excellent, so none more notorious than Lettice, whereof
we find three kinds in Gardens; the wrinkled and vulgar, which is not
capitated; the sessile, or capitated; and the Roman with black seed, and broad
leaves. Some adjoyn two more, to wit, the Cecilian, and Cyprian or Grecian.
Besides which, there grows another Herb in uncultivated places, which derives
the denomination of Lactuce, rather from its juice and seed, than from its
form; which Galen calls Thridax. Some enumerate more sorts, from the variety of
their colors, as white, red, black, and purpereous Lettices.

All the parts, Vires.
as also the seeds of Lettices, refrigerate and conciliate sleep; which remedy
Galen successfully exhibited, when through long and continual studyes, his
sleep had departed from him.

Though this seed be here reckoned amongst the lesser refrigeratives, yet is it
accommodate to more uses; for it stays the immoderate flux of the sperm, it
moderates the ardour of urine, humectates refrigerates, leniates, quenches
thirst, and conciliates sleep.

CHAP. XXX. Of Purslain, and its seed.
PUrslain seed is one of the lesser refrigeratives. And Purslain is a Garden
herb most frequently exhibited in Broth and Condiments, which often inchoates
Rusticks dinners; and is conserved a whole winter with salt and vinegar.

Purslain is two fold; either wild, which grows spontaneously in every
Vineyard, and abounds with many branches that creep along the ground, being of
a redly green color. Or Garden Purslain, which is by culture produced; whose
leaves are more ample, more carnous, more succulent; whose branches are more
erect, and not so hard. They are not much different in forms, but in faculties
they are various; for the sative refrigerates, but the spontaneous calefies, as
many attest.

The leaves of either of them contunded, Vires.
and applied to the corns of the feet, will cure them. They help Tetters, they
assuage the headache, contracted by being in the Sun, if they be adhibited with
Oil of Roses. Being manducated, they confirm loose teeth, and cure the ulcers
of the mouth and jaws.

There is a Sea-Purslain, but it ingredes the composition of no Medicaments
described in our Shop.

CHAP. XXXI. Of other Seeds less frigid; and by the way, of Succoraceous Plants.
TWO other less frigid Seeds are desumed from Succory, whereunto many Herbs are
referred, to wit, Gum Succory.
Chondrilla, Hawk-weed.
Hieracium, Sow-thistle, Garden-Endive, wild Lettices, and all intubaceous
Plants. But when we put Succory absolutely, we mean of the wild Succory, which
comes more frequently into use in Medicine; and it is the genus of all those
differences of sative and wild Intubacies.

The sative Succory, or Intube, is by the Greeks called Seris, Intybum. Seris.
Scariola. Endivia. Intybolachanum.
because it is sown: whereof there are two sorts, the one broad leafed, which
some call Garden Endive; the other narrow leafed, which is called Seris, Garden
Succory, or Endive; and by Sylvius, Intube. Galen calls them both
Intubolachanum, that is, edible Endive, because Succory is reposed among
pot herbs for broth and sallets.

To the wild Succory are referred Sow-thistle, or yellow Succory, Taraxacum.
Dens Leonis.
Lions tooth, Hedypnois, so called, because it conciliates sleep; which
Rondeletius calls Dioscorides his Chondril; by some, Monks-head; by others,
Urinal.

Cicerbita, or Sow-thistle, in French Laicteron, because its juice is lacteous,
is of the family of Endives, and grows in any place, whether cultivated, or
not; whereof Dioscorides makes three sorts, the sharp, the smooth, and the
procerous. The first is called by some Sows-snout. Clusius tells us of five
sorts, two vulgar, the smooth, and the smoother; two austrial, the smooth, and
the smoother; one Pannonical.

To the wild Succory also are referred all the sorts of Chondrils, whereof some
constitute only two, others three, besides Zacinth, or Wart-wort, and Perdion,
which some call Sea-Chondril; others, Bulbose. So that all the sorts of
Chondrils are six, which respond more to the sorts of Succory in faculties,
than in form.

And if we may from affinity of qualities infer conformity in a genus,
Hieracia.
then may Hawk-weed be reposed among the sorts of Succories; or as others will,
among the Sow-thistles. Now there are many sorts of Hawk-weed, to wit, the
greater, broad leafed, narrow leafed with a short root, the long rooted, the
Hawk-weed of the Valley, and of the Mountains; some with leaves like Succory,
others both in leaf and form like Chondrils, about which consult the more
recent Herbalists.

But that I may return from whence I deviated; The various names of Succory.
the various names of Succory have much obscured the sorts thereof: for the
genus is often put for the species, the species for the genus, and one species
for another, and yet all designed by one name. These names are often attributed
to Succory, Ambubeia, Picris, Intybum, Seris, Endivia, Seariola,
Intubolachanum, yea and all the species of Hawk-weed, Cicerbita, Soncius,
Chondrilla, and wild Lettice are denoted by the name Succory.

Wild Lettice has affinity with the kind of Succory, for it bears leaves like
Garden-Endive, and in nature responds to the sorts of Poppy, though it
cructates a soporiferous and poisonous odor, like Opium.

The seeds of wild Succory and Endive are they which are desumed for the seeds
less frigid, whose qualities the appellation sufficiently indicates.

CHAP. XXXII. Of the four more calid Seeds; and first, of Anise.
THE four more calid Seeds are desumed from Anise, Anisum.
Fennel, Cumin, and Carraway. We have before showed what Fennel is; and Anise
the very women know, whose seeds they often use in incrustated Sugar, or else
in confecting that bread they call Biscake, wherewith they mix Anise seed,
because it conciliates a very grateful odor and sapour. They add it also to
many Condiments, for the better grace; for it sweetens the breath, moves urine,
helps the Hydroptical, and conduces more to the ventricle than any oleraceous
seed, ( Dioss. c. 65. l. 3.) It is hot and dry in the third degree, ( Gal. l.
5. simpl.) yet the gust cannot perceive its calour to be so excessive. The
Grecks and Latins call it Anisum, which is the name both of plant and seed,
which I find sometimes called Aricetum.

This Plant is neither like Smallage nor Fennel, as Fuchsius and Ruellius
assert, but a medium betwixt both: for its leaves are not so broad as Smallage,
nor yet so small and capillaceous as Fennel. But because it is vulgarly
notorious, I shall not stand further to describe it.

The Pharmacopolists say, that these seeds are hot and carminative, that is,
discussive of statuosity, as they interpret it: but it etymology is obscure
and unknown, unless they deduce it from the verb (...), that is, to discerp or
divide into minute parts; or from carmino, to kemb; whence the Arabians referr
Carmes to Maidens-hair. Now carminare is to kemb hair or flax, and that not all
at once, but by little and little; and so flatuosity must be orderly and
successfully discussed. But the true original of carminative I cannot attain,
though it be a word much and long received and approved.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of Cumin.
CUmin is the name of a Plant and a Seed like some Fennel; De Cumino.
whereof there are two sorts, one sative and domestic, the other wild.
Hippocrates, who commends the sative for many diseases in women, calls it the
Regal Cumin; Dioscorides, the Ethiopian; and some, the Egyptian and Asian Cumin.

It insists commonly on one stalk, about a foot or less high, brachiated with
many branches; its leaves are sected into slender parts, like Fennel, but they
are shorter, and lesser; its top puts forth a round head, which first emits
flowers, and is afterward onerated with nude, strait, and chanelled seeds; its
root is slender and odorate; which withers as the seeds grow to maturity. It is
sown, and grows plentiously in Spain, Italy, and some hot parts of France; if
its seed be injected on fat soil, it fruticates most of all Pot herbs; and some
Idiots think, that it spreads most if it be sown by some wicked and malevolent
person: but their opinion is rather derisible than probable.

The wild Cumin puts forth leaves like Chervil; exile stalks like Shepherds
needle; it is capitulated with five or six round, hairy heads, wherein lodges
sour seeds.

There is another sort very like the sative, which from every flower emits
sublime cornicles, wherein seeds are contained, like Gith seed. And this seems
to be the Plant which the Shopmen call Larks foot, and Regal Cumfrey.

It is hot and dry in the third degree; it attenuates, digests, Vires.
and resolves; taken and adhibited; it discusses flatuosity, incides frigid
humors, dissipates pituitous humors, expells poisons, and may be prosperously
usurped against the Colical dolor, and Tympany.

CHAP. XXXIV. Of Carraway.
ALL the Society of Confectioners call Caron, (...) Car^
or Careum, Carraway; Athenaeus calls it Carret, wherewith in form and faculty
it agrees. It insists upon a stalk of a cubit height, quadrangular, intercepted
with some genicles, hollow within, with leaves like Carrets. Its root is
carnous, and yet gracile, long, white, and sometimes yellowish, of a
pastinaceous sapour. Its seed is on the tops of its branches like Fennel,
blackish, and angulous; the Arabians call it Cardumeni, which Sylvius uses for
Cardamome. But such as are skillful in Arabic, think he is mistaken.

Carraway is hot and dry in the third degree; Vires.
it moves urine, expells flowers, discusses flatuosity, roborates the stomach,
helps concoction, is a good ingredient in the mixture of Antidotes, and may be
used instead of Anise. Its root cocted, may be caten like Carret. ( Diosc. c.
66. l. 3.)

CHAP. XXXV. Of the other four Seeds, which are calid in a less degree; and
first, of Ameos.
AMeos is so like Cumin, that that which grows in Ethiopia is taken for Cumin.
Its seed is sufficiently known; it is small, and much less than Cumin seed,
which its appellation seems to denote; for (...) portends a very small seed
like sand; which word designs the whole Plant.

Yet there are two sorts of Ammi; the one is the Ethiopian, which is greater
than the common Ammi, and has broader leaves.

The other is less, with smaller leaves, which is not so frequent. The former
has a green and round stalk, referted with many branches, long and strait
leaves, divided with many incisures in their circumference; its muscary is like
Anise, crowned with small flowers, onerated with small seeds smelling like
Origanum, and acrimoniously bitter.

The stalk of the lesser Ammi is short, which puts forth many branches, long
and capillaceous leaves, which are attenuated toward the top; small white
flowers like the former, which are coacted into round heads; its seed is long,
small, and sharp; it is used by some for Sison: for Sison, according to
Dioscorides, being a small seed growing in Syria, black, hot and long, like
Smallage, or the lesser Ammi seed, it may be taken for, or at least substituted
instead of Ammi.

Ammi is in gust, sharp, and somewhat bitter; it incides, attenuates, Vires.
calefies, exsiccates, and digests; it moves flowers and urine, discusses
flatuosity, and gripings in the guts.

It is thought that women would conceive more easily, if after copulation they
smell upon Ammi.

CHAP. XXXVI. Of Amomum; or, our Ladies Rose.
AMomum is not only reckoned amongst exotical, but unknown Plants, for none of
the Ancients have accurately delivered its form or description: and Clusius, of
the more recent Herbalists, who was very diligent in searching, and desirous to
find out the knowledge of this Art, has left us three images or forms of this
Herb: but we can scarce by probable conjecture find which is its true effigies
of these three; nay, we may as well think that none of them respond to it.
First, he says it is like a branch of a certain tree, which by its odor and
suavity challenges affinity with the tree that bears Cloves, but its leaves and
fruit are lesser and rounder than the Clove trees. Secondly (says he) it well
resembles the branches of paralious Tithymal. Thirdly, it is resembled by a
short bough laden with grains, like Cardamomum, hanging in clusters. But he
ingeniously confesses, that it is very hard to determine which is the true
Amomum.

Indeed that small, long, aromatical, and calefactive seed, which Apothecaries
keep, and call Cretian Amomum, responds very well to the faculties of the true
Amomum recorded by Dioscorides; but of what Plant it grows, is unknown to us.
This, and many other rare Simples, have I seen and tasted, in the Pharmacopoly
of Pasch. Bazvin, a man of approved piety and learning, which vulgar Amomum, if
it be not the true one, may very well be its substitute; I mean not Pliny's
Amomum; which being impatient of cold, grows at Lutetia in earthen pots, with
strait and copious branches circumvested with a green bark, coronated with
flowers like to them of Myrtle, but longer, white, and stellaceous; after
which, round, crass, flave, and succulent fruits, like them of Alkakengye,
crupt. Galen substitutes Acorum to Amomum, though its denomination has more
cognation with Cardamome.

It calefies, astringes, and exsiccates; its decoction conduces to the liver
and reins, and helps such as are bitten by Scorpions.

CHAP. XXXVII. Of Daucus, or Carret.
1. THis name, Daucus, comprehends three sorts of Plants under it. The first of
that name is called Daucus absolutely, and is meant of the Cretian Daucus,
which according to Diescorides, has leaves like Fennel, a stalk of nine inches
length, a head like Coriander, a white flower, long seed, like Cumin, whichis
hirsute, with white down. It is suaveolent in cating; and is most frequently
used in the syrup of Mugwort, and may be prosperously mixed with other
Medicaments.

This Daucus grows not only in Crete, but also in many other regions, as in
Germany, Italy, and Venetia: but the Cretian carries the name, though that
which is brought from the Alps and Genoa be every whit as good.

The second sort of Daucus is like Smallage,

The third has leaves like Coriander, Theophrastus calls Carret Daucus. Thus
wild Pastinaca and Caucalis borrow the denomination of Daucus.

Its seed, Vires.
which is frequently used in Medicine, calefies, siccates, opens, incides,
moves flowers and urine, and discusses flatuosity.

We have before treated of Smallage, whose seed is reckoned amongst the lesser
Calefactives.

CHAP. XXXVIII. Of some eximious Flowers, from which most efficacious Waters
and Oils are extracted; and first, of Roses.
ROse is so common, spontaneously growing in every hedge, that it cannot but be
known. There are two sorts hereof; one wild, which is called Cynorrhodon, or
Dog-rose; the other, Garden-rose, which we call Rose absolutely: whereof there
are many sorts, to wit, red, white, pale, incarnate, luteous, ceruleous, which
grows in many places in Italy; and the mosellate Rose, which flourishes in
Autumn.

Other varieties may be educed out of these by art and mangony; but three only
are used in Medicine, to wit, white, red, and damask waters are distilled out
of the white; Honey of Roses, Conserve, Oil, and Unguent, of the red; and Syrup
laxative are made of the damask.

There are many parts in Roses, to wit, the flower, the stalk capillaments,
granules, little flowers, the calix, the seed, the daun. Some call those little
flowers that adhere to the capillaments, Anthera; but Anthera properly is a
compound Medicament used to the affections of the mouth, as it appears by
Actuarius, ( c 7. l. 6. meth. med.) by Celsus, ( c. 11. l. 6.) by Oribasius and
Marcellus.

All Roses have not the same faculty; for the pale relax, the red astringe,
both roborate; as also the common white and sweet Roses: for all sweet odours
recreate and refresh the spirits, as also those vital and animal parts that
hold the principality.

CHAP. XXXIX. Of Nymphea, or Water-Lilly.
THis Nymphea, which the Poets feign to have sprung from a dead Nymph that was
jealous of Hercules, is the most used of all water-plants in Medicine; whereof
Pharmacopolists make two sorts; one greater, which beart white flowers; the
other less, which bears luteous flowers. Both grow in standing waters and fens.

The greater has ample, round and green leaves, gracile, long, smooth, and
round stalks, white flowers, in candor and magnitude resembling Lillyes, and
yellow in the middle; a black, nodous; and long root: some call it Water Lilly;
some, Ne^^ybar; and others, Heraclea.

The lesser grows in a slimy, watty soil, on slender stalks, about (...) cubits
long, whereon a yellow shining flower grows, like a Rose; its root is white,
nodous, sharp, and sweet.

Nymphea refrigerates exceedingly, asswages salacity, Vires.
retains the immoderate flux of the seed; and being drunk, and exhibited by way
of liniment, it quite extinguishes the seed; it conciliates sleep, and wholly
takes away Venery, if its decoction, or conserve, or syrup made of its flowers
be long used.

CHAP. XL. Of Lilly.
Lilly is by some of the Greeks called (...); by others, who believe that it
was produced by Juno her milk, it is called Juno's Rose; in Garlands it is
placed next to the Rose; for its eximious candor, suaveolence, and elegant
form illustrate its dignity.

This Plant is very fecund, for one root will produce and nourish fifty heads.
It consists commonly of one stalk two cubits high, and sometimes higher,
comous, with leaves like Ragwort, but something longer, twined, and green, with
a flower in form of a basket, whole labra constitute a circle, out of which
bottom issue shining tufts, like yellow yearn, and whose extremity is tuberous.

This broad and elegant flower adhering to a small, slender, and languid
peduncle; and another to a crass and rigid branch, encompassed with leaves,
which withers about the end of Summer, and buds again at the beginning of
Autumn.

There are many sorts of Lillyes; for besides the white and common, which is so
called absolutely, there is another, they call the white Byzantian Lilly, which
has got its distinction from the (...) where it grows; another there is of a
cruent color, another ye^^w another light red. There is also a small Lilly,
they call the Lilly of the Valley; and there is a great one, they call the
Persian Lilly, or more commonly, the Imperial Crown, which the Barbarians of
Tusat; whereunto we may add the Day-Lilly, Chalcedony Byrantine, and such
like, whereof now to treat, were beyond our institution.

The root of white Lilly is malactical and anodynous, and of (...) use in
decocting glysters, and confecting emollitive and matter moving Cataplasms. An
Oil also may be extracted out of the flowers infused for the same purposes.
Their water also distilled, will take wrinkles out of ones face, and make it of
a very white color.

CHAP. XLI. Of Crocus, or Saffron.
WE referr to the order of these eximious flowers, Saffron.
the golden colored red flower, of a bulbous Plant, which the Physicians call
Crocus; the French men following the idiome of the Mauritanians Saffron. But it
is a bulbous Plant, lively and carnous, whose leaf is narrow and gramineous,
whose flower is like meadow Hermodactyle, with filaments of a purple and golden
color, and whose odor is intense with some sharpness. It grows best about
fountains and highways, rejoicing to be torn and trod upon, which (as they
say) comes better on by being killed.

But the best of all grows in Corycus, a Mountain of Cilicia, for its odor is
more fragrant, and its color more aureous. It is green in the Spring, it
dilates it self all Summer, in Autumn are its flowers gathered, which are not
usurped for medicinary and culinary uses solely, but many more, when any
aureous color is desired.

Now Crocus is either domestic, whereof Dioscorides enumerates many sorts; or
sylvestrian, whereof Dodonaeus describes more; all which, for brevities sake, I
omit.

It is hot in the second degree, dry in the first; Vires.
if moderately used, it helps the brain, refocillates the senses, excites sleep
and torpour; by recreating the heart, it begets joyfulness, draws the humors
to concoction, and much profits him that knows how to use it with prudence.
Mesue makes an Oil thereof, which ingredes the confection of the Emplaster made
of Frogs. It goes also to other compositions, as to the Syrup of King Sabor,
and to the Oxycrocean Emplaster; whereunto it gives not only color, but also
eximious faculties.

SECTION II. Of Purgative Simples.
The Preface.
OUR former Section being finished, wherein we have clearly unfolded and
explained such common Simples as are as it were Preparatives, and occur every
where to the composition of Medicaments; we will proceed therefore in the next
place to describe such Catharticks as purge humors by subdacing the belly; and
they are such as are given sometimes by themselves alone, or mingled with such
Compositions as are prescribed in our Shop.

And these are for the most part exetical and foreign, conveyed to us dry,
from savage and barbarous Regions.

Yet some we have growing with us, especially in hot Regions; net they do not
retain the same virtues and qualities that the other have, but come far short;
and therefore it is that they are rejected, and the foreign (which are brought
from India and Arabia) used.

Notwithstanding, our Soil is not altogether so ungrateful, but the it affords
many excellent purging Simples, as we shall here demonstrait in this Section.

CHAP. I. Of Rhabarb.
MAny of the Ancients put no difference betwixt Rhaponticum and Rhabarbarum,
nor betwixt the greater Centaury and Rhaponticum, but made one of three several
Plants. But that our vulgar Rhabarb is not Rhaponticum, the description of
Dioscorides does sufficiently evince; and that Rhaponticum is not the greater
Centaury, the same Author demonstrates, in that he treats of them in diverse
Chapters, and describes them in different forms and faculties.

Our vulgar Rhabarb is so called, because it is the most eximious root among
the Barbarians, or Indians, or Troglodites; or perhaps it may derive its
denomination from Rha, a Rivers name in Pontus, as the nomenclature of
Rhaponticum is from thence probably acknowledged. But since Rha in the
peregrine idiome denotes a root, Rhabarbarum, that is, the Barbarians root, may
by an Antonomasy be put for the best root, which the Arabians call Raved, the
Chinians Ravam, where it is most frequent, and where it is thus denoted,
without further addition.

The Rhabarb that comes out of the Dominions of Sina, is the most approved,
where it both grows plentifully, and almost spontaneously; and is thence
conveyed into Ormus, Persia, Arabia, and Alexandria; which afterward coming to
us, is called Indian, Arabic, and Turkish Rhabarb.

Rhabarb is very like our common round Hipolapathum.
Dock; its root is very crass, round, externally somewhat black, internally
flave, like the color of a Nutmeg; which macerated or masticated, infects with
a Saffron color.

It is a cholagogous Medicament, benign, and roborative to the liver and
ventricle: it conduces very much to dysenterick, choleric, and other
affections proceeding from the imbecility of the liver.

CHAP. II. Of Cassia.
THis name comprehends three Plants under it, to wit, Cassia odorata.
Sweet-Cane, which Theophrastus calls Cneoron, and its probable Virgilius means
by his Lavendula: Cassia Lignea.
Lignea, or small Cane, and Cassia Fistula.
Fistula, or siliquous Cane, which is a tall tree, bearing leaves like our
Wallnut tree, whereunto it is like. The materiality of its wood is compact and
hard, its cortex thin and flave.

Its roots are husked, long, round, black, externally ligneous, internally
pithy, black, and abundantly pregnant with many round and plain seeds,
distinguished by certain ligneous and transverse membranes.

The Ancients either were ignorant of, or else grossly neglected this tree.
The Arabians having first experienced its salutiferous use, first commended it.

The marrow or pith of Cassia humectates, Cassia vires.
tempers immoderate heat, lubricates, lenifies and subduces the belly, educing
the excrements without gripings. It may be successfully given to young men, old
men, and pregnant women.

CHAP. III. Of Tamarinds.
THE Arabic word, Tamarinds.
Tamar, signifies a Date; not because the fruit of the tree is like thereunto,
but because the Barbarians took no care to give it any more proper denomination
than what the vulgarity imposed upon it, by whom these Fruits are called
Tamarinds, that is, Indian Dates.

The Greeks for their acidity call them (...), that is, acid Dates; but without
reason, for they resemble no Dactyle.

The tree whereon Tamarinds grow, is tall, hard, and compact, like our Wallnut
tree, or Oak, encompassed with many boughs, and adorned with leaves minutely
incided, about the magnitude of Palm leaves. These Fruits, when immature, are
green and acid; when mature, they are cineritious, their acidity not without
suavity.

But Mesue speaks inconsiderately, when according to Garcla's judgment, he
thinks that Tamarinds are the fruits of wild Date trees in India, whereas there
is not a Date tree in all India, but what is conveyed from Arabia. They grow on
a tree fair to look on, brachiated with many boughs, adumbrated with abundance
of leaves, like some female Fern, called by the Spaniards Helecho, coronated
with fair, odorate, and white flowers, after whose fall, the fruits emerge,
which at first are green, and are nocturnally involved in leaves, to keep them
from the cold, diurnally exposed to the Sun. These leaves will inflect
themselves, though there be no fruit in the night season; and so the boughs of
the tree are hedged in therewith.

In Malavar, Tamarinds are called Puli; in Guzarat, Ambili; in Canary, Chincha;
and in other regions they assume other denominations. Vires.
They gently subduce the belly, leniate, temperate, and promore adust humors;
they are cold in the third degree, dry in the second.

CHAP. IV. Of Myrobalambs.
IF names should answer the natures of the named, these fruits should rather be
called Syriacks or Arabicks, than Myrobolambs; seeing they neither resemble the
idea of an Acorn, nor yield the fragrancy of an odoriferous Unguent, as the
etymology of the name portends.

And if Galen or Dioscorides have given the name, Myrobalamb, to any Fruit
besides its nature, that same differs as much from a true Myrobalamb, as an
inodorate thing from an odorate, and a Prune from an Acorn.

The nomenclature then is more received by use and custom, than by reason and
nature. And these we call Myrobolambs, are but certain sorts of Plums, decerped
from as many different trees, as they have different firnames: for the
diversity of their forms and faculties demonstrate the errors of such, who
contend that they grow upon one and the same tree, but are severally at diverse
seasons collected.

There are five sorts thereof, the flave, the Indian or black, Species.
the Bellirian, the Chebulian, and the Emblian; many whereof grow in the
Kingdom of Cambaia, whose names Garcias has got from the Inhabitants, and
has delineated the several trees and fruits in a few words.

Arare (says he) or the flave Myrobalamb, is round, and bears leaves like
Sobrus: Rezanuale, or the Indian black Myrobalamb, is eight squared, and has
leaves like a Willow. Gotim, or the Bellirian, has leaves like Bay, but more
cineritious and pale. Aretca, or the Chebulian Myrobalambs, are great and
round, yet not perfectly round, but somewhat long, when they attain their full
growth, and bear leaves like the Peach tree. Anuale, or the Emblian, have their
leaves minutely incided, and about a hand length.

The trees are generally of the magnitude of Plum trees, all wild, growing
spontaneously, none domestic. Avicenna calls Myrobasambs, Delegi; but the
Arabians give peculiar names to each sort; calling the flave, Azfar; the
Indian, Asuat; the Bellirian, Heleragi; the Chebulian, Quebulgi; the Emblian,
Embelgi.

The several sorts of Myrobalambs have a several and peculiar faculty; for the
flave, or orange-colour'd, are cholagogous; the Indian, or black, purge
melancholy, and exhilarate; the Chebulian and Emblian are phlegmagogous; all
purge clemently, astringing, and roborating the heart and liver.

CHAP. V. Of Aloes.
ALoes is the name both of the juice, and of an Herb very useful in Pharmacy;
for whether it be internally assumed, or externally applied, it produces
falutiferous effects. And it is a Plant either little, or not at all, like
Scilla, as some conjecture; for its leaves are crasser, fatter, longer, and
broader, sharp on both sides, jagged, bent backward, aculeated with blunt
pricks, pregnant with viscid and tenacious juice, and foliated like the greater
House-leek. Its stalk is a foot high, its flowers white, and seed like
Daffadil; its root is single and crass, like a stake struck into the earth.

It grows plentifully in India, from whence its juice is brought, as also in
Arabia, and other hot Countries.

This Plant will, through its tenacious juice, live two years, and emit new
leaves, if it be set upon a board: but if it be cast on the ground, it withers.
It is by some for its lively nature (for it is always green) called the Seas
Sempervive; yet it will soon tabefy, if it be not preserved from cold, whereof
it is very impatient.

The whole Plant is graveolent, and its sapour bitter, but especially its
juice, which out of what part soever it be extracted, is very useful in
Medicinal Confections.

Its liquor concreted, and brought to us, is of two sorts; the one sandy, and
contaminated with filth, which we call Aloe Caballine, and use in curing
horses, and the like; the other is coacted like a liver, and is thence called
Hepatical Aloes, or Aloe succotrine; or Succo-citrine, its powder being of
Citrine, or Orange color. It is also called by some, Socotorine, because it
comes out of an Island so called. The yellow, fat, clear, and friable, made up
like a liver, is the best; the black, hard, sandy, and impure, is not good.

It is hot in the first degree, dry in the third; applied, it condensates,
astringes, exsiccates, and glutinates the wounds; assumed, it opens, reserates
the passages, moves and stimulates the Hemorrhoides, roborates the ventricle,
subduces the belly, purges choleric and phlegmatic humors, kills and expells
belly-worms, takes away obstructions, exarceates putretude, and preserves
bodies long from corruption.

CHAP. VI. Of Seeny, or Senna.
AS all the precepts of Pharmacy were not at first put in practice, Senna.
so neither were all Medicaments at first marshalled under precepts, or indeed
brought to light; for the Ancients had no knowledge of that we call Seeny; the
Persians, Abalzemer; than which, no purgative now more frequent, more usual,
more useful. It is a siliquous Plant, brought to us from the Eastern
Countries, much like our Collutea, but its leaves better resemble the greater
Myrtle. Flowers of a dusky color issue out of the hollow betwixt its stalk and
stem, appended on tenuious pedicles; to which succeed little, long, plain
incurvated leaves, gravidated with small, brown, compressed seeds, like Gygars.

Its roots, which are long and slender, are useless in Pharmacy, especially if
its stalk be not long-lived; which being impatient of cold, lives not above
four months in the Western Countries, nor in Raly after Autumn.

There are two sorts hereof; one wild, whose leaves are lesser, rounder, and
more useless; the other domestical, whose leaves are larger more acute, and
useful.

Seeny calefies not so much as some think; Vires.
for it is but hot about the end of the first degree, or beginning of the
second, and dry about the end of the second. It purges clemently both cholcrick
and crass phlegmatic humors; it deterges, digests, and expurges all viseid
humors, and adust choler from the brain, lungs, spleen, liver, ventricle, and
mesentery; and cures all diseases in those parts, arising from these humors.

It is exhibited either in form of powder, Lenitivum.
as when it ingredes the Electuary of* Diabalzemer, or Catholicon, or infused
and decocted, as when purgative Syrupus de pomis, or laxative Apozemes are made
thereof. But seeing in concoction it excites gripings and flatuosity, it must
be mixed either with Anise, or Coriander, or Fennel seeds, to discuss its
flatuosity.

CHAP. VII. Of Mechoacan root.
ACertain crass root cut into short stakes, and dried, has been of late
brought us from the Province of Mechoacan, and bears the Provinces name. This
peregrine root is purgative, of a pale color, and crass, which puts forth many
long, and imbecil boughs, which without fulciments would lay along the ground;
but being annexed to perches, they grow up, and with many involutions amplect
them like Briony, to which its effigies is very similar, but its faculties
dissident: Differentia inter Brioniam and Mechoacam.
for Briony is sharp and hot, Mechoacan almost infipid, and void of all
acrimony. The leaves of Briony are broad, and quinquangular, and divided like
Vine leaves, but more sharp, hirsute, and white; its flowers small, white,
racemous, and congregated like Grapes. And Mechoacous leaves are ample, but
withal tenuious, sad-green, and mucronated only on one side, not angular like
Briony. Its fruits are many, cohering in bunches about the magnitude of
Corianders, which come to maturity in Autumn. The whitish and freshest root is
best.

Some call this root white Rhabarb; others, American Scammony; the
Pharmacopolists, Mechoacan root. That which is very white, or black, or
worm-eaten, is naught.

It is hot in the first degree, and dry in the second; it purges, and that
facilely, pituitous and watery humors, not debilitating like other purgatives,
but roborating the parts. It should be dissolved rather in wine than in other
liquors; it may be safely adhibited to old men and boys; it conduces very much
to such as are infested withan inveterate cough, with colic dolor, and with
the French disease.

CHAP. VIII. Of Agarick.
MUshromes are either terrestrial, which grow out of the earth, or arboreous,
which adhere to the stocks of trees; for there is scarce an inveterate tree, but
some kind of campinion adheres thereunto; either blackish and rugous, as on
Oaks, and Wallnut trees; or crass, dure, and whitish, as on the Beech tree; or
white, full, soft, and friable, as Agarick that is excerped from the Larix
tree. Which tree is nobilitated with three sorts of excrements, as Larix
Rosine, which is more humid than others, and void of all acrimony, which is by
some sold for Turpentine. Laxative Manna, which is collected from its effracted
boughs and branches; and Agarick, which grows upon its bole, when inveterate.

The coniferous Larix tree is of eximious procerity, assurging with a strait
stalk, incorticated with a crass bark, dehiscing with frequent chinks,
circumvested with many leaves, short, soft, and tenuious, like Pine leaves, not
aculeated, but retuse, which numerously cohere together in each tubercle. Its
apples are small, almost like them of the Cypress tree.

That Agarick that seems to be the impostume of the Larix tree, is best, which
is white, rare, friable, at the first sweet to the gust, afterward bitter and
styptical. Democritus calls it, Medicamentum familiae.

It grows in Galicia and Cilicia; but the best comes from Agaria, a region of
Samatia, whence it derives its denomination. Now we have very good from
Delphinatus, a Province of France, and many parts of Italy, where procerous
Larix trees grow copiously, on whose trunks Agarick grows; which is no root, as
Dioscorides and Galen conjectured.

It is hot in the first degree, dry in the second; it purges phlegm, liberates
obstructions, attenuates, deterges, dissipates flatuosity, and eases us of all
diseases proceeding from viscid, crass, and frigid humors.

CHAP. IX. Of Polypody.
POlypody is so termed, because many knots and tubercles, like the Fishes
called Polypi, grow on its roots. It is also called Dentropteris, or tree fern,
because it grows on trees, and sometimes on umbrous stones, mossy walls, and
such humid places.

It is an herb without stalk, flower, and seed, consisting only of a root and
leaves like masculine fern, but lesser, and maculated on the under side with
yellow spots. Its root is hirsute and long, about the crassitude of a little
finger, extending it self obliquely, and exasperated with many lumps; within it
is porraceous and virid, like a Pastick nut; its sapour is very sweet,
subamare, austere, and somewhat aromatical; but it does not much affect the
tongue.

It does not calefy in the third degree, as Mesue thought; but it is probable
that it exsiccates in the second; it deterges, digests, and ficcates crass and
viscid humors, educes melancholic and viscid phlegm, and that even from the
articles, if it be copiously assumed. It sustains much coction, and is seldom
given alone, but mixed with other purgatives, which may adauge its imbecil
purgative faculty. The broth of an old Cock, the decoction of Beat or Mallows,
much augment its purgative faculty. It helps also some affections, when it is
externally applied, ( Diosc. c. 188. l. 4.)

CHAP. X. Of Carthamus. Bastard or Spanish Saffron.
AS the nomenclature of Cartham denotes this herb to be purgative, so does
Enicus show it spinous. For Cartham is a Plant, which as to its faculty is
subductive, and to its cognation of the sorts of Carduus. It assurges on a
stalk two cubits high, and more, which is strait, hard, ligneous, and toward
the top ramous. Its leaves are long, broad from the middle to the stalk,
acuminated toward the top, and aculeated in their ambient.

The extremities of the branches produce some round heads, about the magnitude
of Olives, obduced with many spinous skins, which emit Saffron-colour'd
flowers, so like them of Crocus, that most perspicacious eyes may be deceived
in them: hence the Vulgar call it the wild Crocus.

To these succeed long, smooth, white, angulous, and splendent seeds,
effigiated like them of Heliotrope, whose cortex is hard, and medulla, or pith,
white, fat, and sweet. Cartham is by the Seplasiaries called wild Crocus; by
the Medicks, Cnicum: whereof there are two sorts, the one sative, or vulgar;
the other wild, whereof Theophrastus makes two sorts also; the one with a
strait caul, which women use for distaffs, which according to Ruellius, ( c.
155. l. 3.) is a kind of thistle, and wild Cartham; the other lower, grosser,
and more hirsute, which they call Carduus Benedictus, of which elsewhere.

Carthamus seed is purgative; Vires.
for its very pith solely assumed, is flegmagogous; and mixed with other
Medicaments, expurges lent and frigid humors: but that it calefies not in the
third degree, sense demonstrates, contrary to Galen's opinion.

CHAP. XI. Of Wallwort, or Dwarf-Elder.
WAllwort and Elder are so similar, Ebulus.
that they seem to differ solely in magnitude; whence Dioscorides calls them
both Elders, the one the Arboreous Elder, the other the Dwarf-Elder.

Elder grows into a tall tree sometimes, whose boughs and bole are hollow,
medullous, and round, like reeds; first green, then cineritious, ligneous, and
hard; Sambucus.
its leaves are like them of a Wallnut tree, but graveolent, and in their
ambient frequently incided. Its flowers are many, small, white, and elegantly
composed into heads; whose consequents are turgent berries, of a sanguineous
color. The Elder germinates first of wild trees, and is last denudated of its
leaves.

But Wall-wort, or Dwarf-Elder, is more herbaceous, and low, whose stalk is
neither ligneous nor perpetual, but annually tabefying and dying. It grows best
in moist and fat soyls, especially if they be incultivated. Its leaves are
ample, and incided about. Its flowers composed into heads, are numerous, white,
odorate, not fetid. Its fruits like Elders, are small, round, black, and
pregnant with juice and seed. Its roots are crass, long, and carnous; out of
its fruits in Autumn they get small seeds, which they keep in their
Pharmacopolies. Both its roots and seeds are hydragogous, and very apertive,
and therefore useful in hydroptical and watery diseases.

CHAP. XII. Of Esula, or Devils milk.
THere are seven sorts of Tithymals enumerated amongst the lacteous Plants,
whereunto Esulae are congenerate, Esula.
for they are all lacteous, and purge phlegm with griping and molestation. yet
Esula is by the Rusticks taken for Rhabarb, and so frequently used to the
valitude of many, and the death of more.

It is called Esula, or Caula; by the Arabians, Alsebran; by Diascorides,
Peplus; by the Shopmen, Esula rotunda, because its small leaves are
orbiculated. It grows in vineyards, hedge sides, and many incultivated places.

Another Plant, which Dioscorides calls Peplion, and Peplis, and some water
Plantain, has much cognation, and the same virtues with this Esula. The round
and lesser Esula is better than the greater, which has leaves like Tithymal.

Esula is hot, Vires.
sharp, and ulcerative, violently educing phlegm; its substance being tenuious,
is igneous, sharp, incisive, tenuative, fusive, apertive, and siccative.
Besides phlegm, it draws also choler from the junctures.

Its ferity is castigated by infusion in vinegar, as we have showed ( in
Officina, (...) 8. l. 2.) or by admistion of some cordials or roberatives.

CHAP. XIII. Of Hermodactyls.
HErmodactyls, Hermodactylus
and Colchian Ephemora, are bulbe^ Plants, similar in form, in faculties
dissimilar; for Quick-fading flower.
Ephemer^^^ is strangulative, in one day suffocating the assumer, and no way
subducing the belly in purging; whereas Hermodactyls are no way perilous, and
yet expurge orderly phlegm from the junctures.

There is also indigenous Ephemerum, which some call wild Lo^ks, or meadow
Cracus, whose leaves are but three or four, long, broad, smooth, The difference
between Hermodactyls and Ephemerum.
and fat ones, whose flowers are in color and form like them of Crocus,
issuing out at the same time, to wit, in Autumn. I^ root is like an Onion; it
grows in meadows, and moist places, (...) is by some erroneously usurped for
Hermodactyle; for this being exsiccated, is flaccid, feeble, and not at all
purgative, nor yet pernicious, as the Colchian Ephemerum, which is
strangulative; whereas Hermodactyle is exotical, and not flaccid as this, but
hard, compact, and easily pulverable, which educes humors from the remote
parts and junctures of the assumer. Now one sort of Ephemerum is lethal and
strangulative, to wit, the Colchian; another not strangulative, to wit, our
indigenous one; a third purgative and safe, to wit, the Syrian, which in
Pharmacopolies is called Hermodactyla.

Hermodactyle calefies and siccates in the beginning of the second degree;
Vires.
yet with such excrementitious, flatulent, and na^^eative humidity, that it
makes the ventricle aversant to it; especially then, when the commoved humors
with one conflux come upon it. It draws phlegm, and other viscid humors, even
from the articles, and therefore conduces much to the Chiragry, Podagry, and
other dolours in the junctures proceeding from pituitous humors.

CHAP. XIV. Of Turbith.
THE enarration of no Plant is so much controverted as that of Turbith: Mesue
calls it a Lactary, and a ferulaceous Herb: Serapio thinks it is the root of
Tripoly: Acluarius one while says it is the root of Pityussa; another while,
Dioscorides his Alypum; and the more, because it is whitish. Some think it is
the root of Tapsia, others of Scammony; but Garcias will have it a Plant
different from all these; For (says he) it is a plant whose root is neither
great, nor long; whose caul, of about a fingers crassitude, and two palms
longitude, is extended along the earth like Ivy. Its leaves are like them of
Althea, as also its flowers, which are whitish, or red, not changing their
color thrice in a day, like Tripoly, as foam have foolishly credited.

Now all Turbith is not gummous, but only that part of the caul that is next
the root; which part is also most useful, the rest being too gracile and
comous to be used.

It purges only phlegm, not choler, as Alypum does, which some call Herba
terribilis; for its flowers, leaves and seeds move terrible purgations. Perhaps
this Herb is called Turbith from the like faculty, as Turbith because
turbative, which the Arabians call Terbeth; which name they also give to their
more valid flegmagogous Simples.

Turbith then, according to Garcias, is neither the root of Alypum, nor of
Tripoly, nor of Scammony, nor of Tapsia, nor yet any lacteous or ferulaceous
Plant; neither is the gummous or domestic the best, according to Mesue;
however, there is no Shop wherein good Turbith may not be found noted with
those ensigns which Mesue gives it. Whereunto also that same that Garcias
depinges in other lineaments, which the Arabians call Caritamion, responds in
faculties.

But which is the true Turbith, is yet ancipitous. That is most approved of,
which is some what white and cineritious, easily frangible and fresh; for the
inveterate is imbecil, and conturbates the bowels.

It is hot in the third degree, purges by moderate traction; Vires.
and if it be corrected, educes crass, viscid and putrid phlegm from the
ventricle, breast, remote parts, and junctures.

CHAP. XV. Of Scammony.
BY Scammony we understand not only the concrete juice of a certain Plant, but
also the Plant it self. And it is a lacteous, volvulous, scansory, and smooth
Plant; in leaf, flower, and form, very like Similax; in root somewhat
different, which in Similax is slender, in Scammony crass, long, candid within,
graveolent, and pregnant with juice; out of which, slender and viticulous
branches issue, which climb up the adjoining bushes, amplexing and implicating
them. Its leaves are broad, and acuminated like Arisaron, but lesser; its
flowers are albid and cave, like a scale; it grows plenteously in fat soil,
chiefly in Antioch and Syria.

The liquor commonly called Scammony, is collected out of i^ roots after
several manners; as first, the head of the root is resected, then excavated
with a knife, that the juice may run in the concamerated passage, till it be
brought to fit receptacles or vessels suppos^^ed. Secondly, the earth about the
root is effoded, and the root left in a concamerated hole, whereunto the juice
is profunded upon Wall^^^ tree leaves therein subjected, which after concretion
is extracted. Thirdly, the root evelled, is incided, and the juice issuing from
it, is exsicced, formed into lumps, and preserved. Fourthly, juice is extracted
from its leaves and caul by triture, which exsiccated, coacted, and kept. But
Scammony so educed, is either black, or of a sal green, which is the worst;
that is best, which exudes out of the root by incision, especially that which
comes from Antioch; that which comes out of Armenia is next; out of Europe, bad
enough.

The best is nitid, splendid, clear like gum, somewhat white, rate, fungous,
spongious, easily liquescible, tender, friable, not ponderous, nor very
graveolent, nor yet suaveolent, but like taurine glue. And by how much any
recedes more from these notes, by so much it is worse.

All Scammony purges validly, Vires.
moving the belly with labor and molestation; it expurges phlegm, and watery,
thin and sharp humors; and if it be too largely assumed, it abrades the
intestines, hurts the bowels, opens and crodes the orifices of the veins, draws
blood downwards, excites the dysentery, conturbates the heart, liver, and other
intrals, and subverts the ventricle; it is hot and dry in the third degree.

Its efferous faculty may be castigated by the admistion of Aloes, The
correction of Scammony.
but better if it be decocted in a Quince excavated, and roasted upon coals, or
in an oven, with some seeds of Smallage, Fennel, and Dancus: but the most usual
correction is by the admistion of the juice of Quince, or Roses.

Scammony thus castigated, Cur Diacrydium cictum.
is by the Pharmacopolists called Diacrydium, which they corruptly term
Diagredium. When it is too new, it is efferous; when antiquated, imbecil and
torminous; for it moves, but emoves not good diet.

CHAP. XVI. Of Hellebor, or Bears-foot.
ELlebore, or Hellebore, is either white, or black. There be two sorts of
white, the greater, and the lesser; the greater bears leaves like Plantain, or
rather Gentian, but larger, more veinous, skrewed and complicated. Its caul is
strait and long, emitting many branches, out of which white flowers emerge. Its
root is cepous, crass, and white, whereunto many fibers adhere. It calefies and
siccates in the third degree; it educes many, but chiefly pituitous humors,
but not without molestation; it excites vomit in the Assumer, and its powder
adhibited at the nostrils, moves sternutation. Elleborine is very like that
same the Pharmacopolists keep.

Black Hellebore is quadruple; the first sort is the true Hellebore; Species
nigri.
the second, Garden Pseudo-ellebore; the third, Dioscorides his Hellebore, or
Bears foot; the fourth is wild Pseudo-ellebore. Some add black ferulaceous
Hellebore, and the great Elleboraster.

The true black Hellebore emits broad, full, smooth, hard leaves, Elleborus
niger verus.
like Laurel, whose ambient is incided: its flowers are broad, patulous, first
albid, then purpureous; in whose middle, when they are ready to decide, grow
short husks, pregnant with small seeds. Its root is manifold, disterminated
into many black fibers and radicles. It flourishes in the winter solstice, and
deep snows.

This sort of Hellebore is most usual among Medicks, and should be usurped,
when Hellebore is put absolutely and simply; which the Latins call Veratrum;
the Arabians, Cherabachen.

It purges Melancholy, and profits such as are mad, frantic, Vires.
hypochondriacal, splenical, epileptical, elephantical, and infested with a
quartane fever, conducing much to all diseases proceeding from choler and
melancholy: but it is perilous to the sane, imbecil, and young.

CHAP. XVII. Of Coloquintida.
THis Plant is a certain sylvestrian Cucurbite, by the Greeks and Latins
called Colocynthis; by the Arabians, Landbel, and the Death of Plants; by the
Persians, Fell terrae, as that which superates all other Plants in amaritude;
and, according to Mesue, infects its neighbors poysonously. It creeps out of
the earth like sative Cucurbite; its leaves are also like thereunto, ample and
lanuginous; its branches long, and serpentine; its flowe^ of a dusky pale
color, like them of Cucumbers, whereof some dye presently, producing no fruit;
others suppeditate round apples in the form of an indifferent ball, very
bitter, fungous, pithy, and gravidated with seeds like them of Cucumbers; which
at first are green, but when they have attained to Autumn, and their perfect
magnitude, they are pale. They are always very bitter, and kill not only the
vicine Plants, but with adustion affect the earth about them, as Mesue relates
at large, who writes much of Colocynthis; which I, thinking to be of small
moment, will not rescribe.

It calefies and siccates in the third degree, Vires.
attracting pituitous and other crass humors from all parts, as the brain,
nerves, muscles, and articles, though very remote. It purges Choler also, and
often prosperously cures the colical color, Apoplexy, Vertigo, Epilepsy,
difficulty of breathing, and many other affections, which more clement
Medicaments cannot help. Let him that would know more, read Mesue, ( c. 4. l.
2. de simpl. med. purg.)

There is a kind of sylvestrian and erratical Cucumber, Cucumber asinius.
which the Shopmen call sometimes asinine, sometimes anguine Cucumber, whose
leaves, branches, and flowers, differ not much from the former. But in Fruits
they are alien, for this produces not round, spo^gious, and white apples, as
the former, but long acorns somewhat green, which having acquired their perfect
magnitude, will presently leap away at the light contrectation of ones finger.

The juice drawn out of this, and coacted, makes the Elatery we spoke of before.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Mezereon, and Chamelaea; or Widow-wail, and Spurge-olive.
MAny, through too much oscitancy, confound Mezereon, Widow-wail. Spurge-olive.
Dwarf-bay.
Thymelaea, Chamelaea, and Chameleo niger. Thymelaea indeed, and Chamelaea, are
affine both in form and nature. But black Chameleon differs from them both, for
they are shrubby Plants, emitting tenuious, rigid, and ligneous branches, with
small leaves like Pomegranate leaves; but black Chameleon is of the family of
Thistles, bearing leaves like Artichoke, but lesser, more tenuious, and
spinous; whose root, according to Galen, is of a poisonous nature.

This Plant is called Mezereon by the Arabians, because it is venenate; for
Mezereon is as much as viduifical, or widow-making Plant, otherwise called the
Lion of the earth, whose stalk is elevated about two cubits above the earth;
its leaves are like them of an Olive, but greater; its grain is like Myrrh.

The Commentators upon Mesue are altogether ignorant which is this Plant; but
it seems to be some kind of Chamelaea, especially that which bearing three
grains coherent, is called Tricoccos.

And as in many kinds of Plants, some are familiar to us, and natural, others
pernicious; so in the society of Chamelaeas, one is efferous, participating of
some malign quality, which we call Mezereon, or Almezerion; another better, and
less formidable, which may be safely exhibited in Medicine.

And it is called Chamelaea, or Spurge-Olive, for it is much like an Olive; a
shrubby surculous Herb, with slender boughs about a cubit long, with leaves
like an Olive tree, but lesser, bitter, sharp, and mordacious, affecting and
ulcerating the tongue. Its fruit is small, round, in the beginning green,
afterward red. The whole Plant is acrimonious, and of an adustive faculty;
Vires.
it leaves (says Dioscorides) detract phlegm and bile, especially when assumed
in Pills, for so are they most successfully usurped.

CHAP. XIX. Of Thymelaea, or Spurge-flax.
THymelaea, which some without reason call Cneorum, or Cnestrum, is a shrub
whereon Coccum Gnidium grows, emitting specious slender boughs of two cubits
length, with leaves like Chamelaea, but more narrow, and very glutinous and
fat, with white, and sometimes red, small, frequent flowers on the summities of
its rods, whose consequents are certain small grains, they call Pepper of the
Mount; which at first are green, then Orange color, round like berries, whose
husks are black without, white within.

The whole Plant, Vires.
especially its leaves and fruits, are acrimonious, calefactive, and adustive,
wherefore they should be prepared with vinegar; its leaves should be gathered
in the dog-dayes, dried in a shade, and preserved; its leaves and fruits purge
phlegm, watery and serous humors.

CHAP. XX. Of Laurel.
THere grows in many woods a wild Plant spontaneously, that has more cognation
with the three former in faculty than in form, which is also nourished in many
Gardour, and has from the pulchritude of its leaves got the name Eupetalon,
from their similitude with Bay, Laurel, and Chamedaph^^.

It grows in groves, incultivated, mountainous and rough places, as also in
many opake and umbrous places in France.

Its root emits many crass, obsequious branches, circumvested with a crass
bark, with long, broad, carnous, smooth, splendent, sad green leaves, like
Bay Leaves, but lesser and softer, and many long, cave, and candid flowers
about the tops of the branches; its fruits, or black berries, pregnant with
stones, grows immediately to the root of the leaves.

Laurel depurges phlegm, Vires.
and serous humors, conduces to the headache, dropsy, and such affections as
proceed from these humors. But it must not be rashly exhibited, but as it is
duly prepared and prescribed by a perite Physician, for it has an efferous
quality, whereby it offends the bowels and intrals.

CHAP. XXI. Of Ricinus, or Palma Christi.
RIcinus is so called, Palma Christi.
from the similitude of its seed to a little filthy Animal most offensive to
Cattle* It is also called Cici, Croton, Lupa, Myrasola, Kerva, Palma Christi,
and in Arabic, Albemesuch.

This Herb in form and figure represents a tree; for its leaves emulate Fig
leaves, its caul and boughs are concave like reeds, its flowers mossy and
pallid, its fruits are triangular, coherent in clusters, and maculous, whose
exterior core is sharp, and spinous, but within they are full of a candid fat
pith, or sap, out of which the torcular will express Oil not only for Lucerns,
but other uses; for Dioscorides asserts, that it will purge the belly, and kill
worms. It is also good to cure the scab, ulcers in the head, and suffocation in
the uterus.

It is certain that Ricinus is calefactive and siccative in the second degree,
and that it will purge the belly; twenty grains hereof, or a little more or
less, according to the strength and age of the Assumer, cleansed, brayed, and
drunk, will deject bile and water by stool.

CHAP. XXII. Of Sea-Colewort, or Soldanella.
SOldanella comprehends two different Plants under it; Sea Bind weed
the one is very like the vulgar in form, but its leaves are perdifolious; it
germinates every year, and produces new leaves; it is called Brassica
multiflora, and Monospermos.

The other is very dissimilar, and thought to be of the family of Wood-binds,
from its effigies; its seed is mucagineous, black, hard, and angulous; its
faculty is hydragogous, and it much conduces to the hydroptical assument. And
though it be an enemy to the stomach, yet duly administered, and mixed with
other Medicaments, it roborates the intrals, educes watery humors without
violence, and is a good ingredient for that eximious Hydragogal Medicament we
have heretofore described.

Our Land is nobilitated with many more purgative Simples, as the Aller tree,
Rhamnus, which we call Buck-thorn, which I will not here congest, because they
are either seldom used, or that they do not ingrede our compositions.

SECTION III. Of Exotical Calefactives.
The Preface.
THE all-seeing providence of God has thought good to bless the remotest part
of the East (India) with better Medicaments than Physicians; Plants of such
rare worth, and admirable virtue, that Medicks of a more polish life and
conversation, of greater learning and experience than those rude Barbarians,
have, to their perpetual renown, demonstrated their virtues and operations, and
by long use and observation, have found them fortunately successful in many
desperate distempers.

What shall we say? do we not daily receive multifarious and innumerable Plants
from diverse parts of the East and West? Sweet-swelling-Aromaticks,
heart-reviving-Cardiacks, and body-warming-Calefactives, to which our Microcosm
is perpetually obliged; of which we are about now to treat. And we intend to
fix our discourse, first, upon those that are calefactive in the highest
degree; afterward, handle such as are less; and lastly, speak to those that
have a middle quality, or moderation between both.

CHAP. I. Of Ginger.
GINGER is a Plant so called, Ginger.
which we borrow of the Barbarians, like our water Flower-de-luce, but its
leaves are blacker; its root extends it self with internodian genicles, which
emits arundinaceous leaves, From whence the best Ginger comes.
twice or thrice repeated each year. It grows in many parts of India, whether
sown or planted. That we count best that comes from Malavar, where it is most
frequent and diligently cultivated; else it is not good.

When it is effoded, they leave an internodium thereof in the hole for the
perennity of the Plant; for the piece occluded will germinate the next year,
producing new roots and leaves. This root, while tender, cut into small pieces,
will eat pleasantly with vinegar, oil, and salt: but it comes not to us till it
be dry, or condited, for it is too efferous for our soil. We shall hereafter
declare what difference there is among Ginger, Zerumbet, and Zedoaria.

Ginger calefies in the third degree, it helps concoction, and roborates the
weak ventricle: but its use is now more rare than it has been formerly; for it
is scarce admixed to any Condiments, only used in the castigation of some
Medicaments.

CHAP. II. Of Zerumbet.
ZErumbet, or Zumbert, Zedoaria and Ginger are peregrine Plants of near
cognation, but not all known to all men. For the Arabian Serapio ( c. 172. l.
de simpl.) from the assertion of Isaac, says, that Zerumbet and Zedoaria are
one. Afterward he asserts, that Zerumbet are round roots, like Aristolochy, of
the color and sapour of Ginger. And in another place ( c. 271. ejusd. libri)
he writes, that it is a great tree in the Mountains of the East Indies.

Avicenna ( l. 2. tract. 2. c. 247.) says, that Zerumbet is a wood like
Cypress. Some think it is Arnabo, Arnabo, quid.
whereof Paulus Aeginus makes mention ( c. 3. l. 6.) but they mistake; for it
is the opinion of many, that Arnabo is a tall tree, that is suaveolent; or as
others think, that Arnabo is the name of a Plant that is now known by some
other name.

But Zerumbet is a graminaceous Plant; either sative, How it differs from
Ginger.
that grows in the Province of Malavar; or spontaneous, which grows in some
woody places of that Country, and is there called wild Ginger: Garcias.
Because its form and root has much affinity with Ginger. But all in Zerumbet
are larger, for its leaves are longer and broader, its roots more crass, which
after their effossion are cut and dried, and so conveyed to Arabia, afterward
into Europe.

Round Zedoaria may justly be substituted in stead of Zerumbet; for it is
probable that both Plants are of the same name, nature, and genus, and differ
no more than long and round Cyperus.

Zerumbet is much commended against Poisons; Vires.
it exhilarates the heart, roborates and conserves the intrals.

CHAP. III. Of Zedoaria, or Set-wall.
BY the names Zador, Set wall.
Zeduar, Geiduar, and Zadura, we are to understand the vulgar Zedoaria, which
Mesue says is a round root, resembling Ginger, but more odorate, and withal
bitter, and not so sharp and hot as Ginger.

It is brought from the Country of Sina, and the extremes of India; it is
related to Zerumbet, but more vulgar and notorious; but neither Plant have been
seen whole by any almost in Europe.

Avicenna says, Zedoaria is like Cyperus, others say it is like Costus, of
which hereafter: but all Aromatical Simples are more similar in virtue and
power, than in form and effigies.

Zedoaria is hot and dry in the second degree; Vires.
it discusses flatuosity, cures the bitings of poisonous Animals, helps the
colical dolor, kills maw-worms, and is a good ingredient in Actidotes.

CHAP. IV. Of Galangal.
THere are two sorts of Galangal, the greater and the lesser, both growing in
the same soil: but the lesser, which is more odoriferous, fruticates more
plenteously in the Region of Sina, Major.
the greater in Javar and Malabar; and it is two cubits high, and higher, if
sown in fat ground.

Its leaves are almost two cubits long, more green above than below; its caul
is circumvested with the convolution of the leaves; its flower is white and
inodorate, its seed small, its root about the head crass, bulbous, and nodous,
like that of reeds; in other parts it is very like Ginger, and it is propagated
in like manner, to wit, by root, and not by seed, though it thrives very well
that is sown; it seems to be very like Orris.
Flower-de-luce in root, leaves, and form.

The lesser Galangal is about two hands high, Minor.
with leaves like Myrtle, its root nodous, for the most part spontaneous. Some
simply confound it with sweet Cane and Acorus. The Chyneans and Malabareans use
it oftener in Condiments than Medicaments.

It is hot and dry in the third degree; it roborates the ventricle, cures the
colical dolor, discusses flatuosity, and helps all frigid distempers. The
lesser must be taken for the better.

CHAP. V. Of Acorus, or Water-flag.
ACorus is an odorate Plant, geniculated like our Orris, but its leaves are
longer and narrower, its caul more tenuious and longer, and its roots also more
slender, which obliquely prostrate themselves along the superficies of the
earth; which are whitish within and without, and of an acroamare sapour.

They err shamefully who say, that Acorus, The error of many.
both the sorts of Galangal and Ginger, differ not at all. And they are not
excusable, who usurp Calamus Aromaticus.
sweet Cane and Acorus indistinctly; for they differ very much, as appears by
their several descriptions. Moreover, Europe brings forth Acorus only, seldom
or never any sweet Cane; India produces sweet Cane, never Acorus.

Acorus, according to Galen, is hot and dry in the third degree.

CHAP. VI. Of Calamus Aromaticus, or, the Aromatical Reed.
CAlamus Aromaticus is an Indian arundinaceous Plant, whose caul is hollow like
a quil, easily frangible into splinters.

It differs much from Acorus, and is not enumerated amongst the Roots, but
ligneous Plants, which are concave, and geniculated. It is white within, like a
reed, flave without; its odor is most fragrant, its sapour acrimoniously
bitter; and it is glutinous in chewing.

It is brought from India only; instead of whose root, another aromatical one
is sold in many Shops, Myrepsicu^.
which Hippocrates calls Myrepsicum, that is, unguentary, from its suavity.
Some call it Babylonian Cyperus, which by the more perite Herbalists is named
Shop-Cane; which Johannes Robinus, the Kings Herbalist, has by his industry
and labor transplanted in the Physicians Garden at Paris. But this is not the
Ancients Calamus Aromaticus, for this is hotter and more acrimonious, having
more strict and junceous leaves, which are triangular; the vulgar Calamus has
broader leaves. But since they are similar both in form and faculty, our vulgar
Calamu^ may be rightly substituted for the rare and exotical.

It is hot and dry in the second degree; Vires.
it astringes gently, has a little acrimony; by the tenuity of its parts,
opens the passages, moves flowers, recreates the spirits, and helps the native
color.

CHAP. VII. Of Costus.
COstus is a peregrine Plant celebrated by the Ancients, but not accurately
noted and described; so that its true dignotion is not apparent to the recent.
All indeed say it is a root, but none yet indubitably asserted of what plant,
or whether of one or more.

Yet if we believe the Ancients, Species.
(as of necessity we must in such things whereof they have had perfect
knowledge, and which they have often used and approved) there are three sorts
of Costus, the Arabian, Indian, and Syrian.

The Arabian is white, Amarus and dulcis.
light, and suaveolent above the rest; while it is fresh and new, it is
abundantly full and dense, not carious.

The Indian is indeed light, but black and amare; the Syrian is flave,
tuberous, to the gust acrimonious, to the olfact fragrant. The Arabians
constitute only two sorts thereof, the amare, and the sweet. And Clusius
thinks there is but one kind of Costus, and that it is only called sweet, in
reference to the more amare and acrimonious. Such a difference as this in
sapour, we daily experience in Plants, which while fresh and new, are more
sweet and suave; when inveterate, croded with worms, and corrupted, more amare,
acrimonious, and insuave.

The Costus now in use amongst Physicians, Costus vulgaris
is a root almost like Ginger, within white, smooth, light, without palely
flave, somewhat amare, very fragrant, and often so suaveolent while new, that
it importunately affects the head. It grows in many places in India, as in
Guzarat, and about Amadabar, the most famous City of that Country. The Greeks
and Latins retain the Arabian nomenclature, all calling it Cost, or Gostus.

In Pharmacopolies some usurp a root of a certain vulgar aromatical Plant
instead of Costus, The error of some Apothecaries.
which seems to be desumed from the sorts of Seseleon; it has some affinity
with that which Matthiolus calls Ethiopicum, in root, leaves, caul, magnitude,
form, and faculties, which by some is called Pseudo-costus; by others, Belgian
Costus; and by others, Shop-Costus. If any one fear to substitute this for the
true Costus, Sue^idanium.
let him take Angelica root in its stead.

Costus being subamare, is somewhat astrictive; being acrimonious, is
exceedingly calefactive; and being suaveolent, is refective and exhilarative.

CHAP. VIII. Of both Beens.
BEn, or Been, ( Rhas. par. 135. de nomin. Arab.) is an Arabic word, denoting
a certain tree growing in Ethiopia, like our Tamarisk, whose fruit is called
Abelban, out of which emanates an Oil they call Muscelline, which name they
also give to the Plant it self, as Rhasis has it; but neither he nor Avicenna
do further dilucidate the Plant; only Avicenna says, The opinion of Avicen.
it is a ligneous lump or root, which by exsiccation has contracted wrinkles
and lineations; whereof there are two sorts, the one white, the other red, both
hot and dry in the second degree. Elsewhere he says, that both the Beens are
dry in the first degree, and the red hotter than the white: but we see the
contrary in those two roots we celebrate in the Shops for Been, for the white
is sensibly calid, the red more languid and ignave.

Serapio is no whit clearer in describing both the Plants. Serapio's opinion.
There be (says he) two sorts of Ben, both about the magnitude of the root of
the lesser Pastinaca, and tortuous, they are brought from Armenia, their odor
is good, and both are viscid, calid, and humid.

Since then the Ancients agree only about the name of this their indigenous
Plant; no wonder if our Writers be silent, or else enunciate few and most
probable of its properties. There is no Pharmacopolist but he knows the white
and red roots that are celebrated for Beens: but that dignotion is only
superficial, and none yet have learned their true effigies.

The Arabians say, that Been corroborates, impinguates the body, Vires.
augments seed, conduces to the palsy, and performs many more commodities,
which we find not in our white root; and therefore Sylvius substitutes in its
stead the root of Eringium. I prefer ours, Succidanium.
or the Spanish Angelica before it, as more cordial.

Some think that Polemony is white Ben, and Bistort red; but that conjecture is
not worth the improbation.

CHAP. IX. Of Scecachul.
SCecachul I find diversely called by the Arabians, as Lochachium, Lichimum,
and Alithimum, whose seed, or rather grain, they call Culcul; its leaf is like
Albena, or Julben; which words Serapio confounds, and uses them both for
Scecachul; which is a Plant, by their description, short stalked, of a veinous
and nodous root, out of each of whose genicles emerge leaves like them of
Balsam.

It emits violaceous flowers, at the beginning of the Spring, out of its
summity, to which black grains of the magnitude of Pepple follow, full of sweet
humidity, which the Barbarians call Gal^^^; but Rhasis says, Kilkil is more
consonant to their idiom, who ( l. 23.) reconseates their qualities, and says,
they are hot and moist in the second degree; Serapio says, only in the first
degree. Both contend, that they very much excite venery, for it increases
sperm, erects the uterus, and incites to copulation. Scecachul grows in umbrous
places, and about tree roots.

But neither the roots nor grains of Scecachul ever came at us; which seeing it
is an exotical Plant wholly unknown to late Searchers, it ought to be expunged
out of Receipts; for it is absurd to borrow a name from the Barbarians, since
both we and they perhaps want the Herb; for why else have they not described it
more accorately, or sent it to us, or at least sold it in their Empories, or
shown it amongst other of their rare Simples.

Since it serves for to excite venery, Suecidanium.
as often as the said Plant is required, either Satyrium may be prescribed, or
the Prescript augmented, or Pistacia, or Pine-apples, or Ornithoglossum, or
some such Plant of the venercous rank, may be substituted.

CHAP. X. Of Cinnamon.
WHat Cinnamon is, we can scarce learn from the Ancients, who have conjectured
much about it; nor yet from the more recent, save such as have peragrated its
native soil, as Garcias, who himself saw it in many parts of the East Indies,
as in Zeilan, from whence the best is brought.

The multiplicity of its denominations have much obscured its dignotion; for in
Malago it is called Cais manis, that is, Sweet-wood; in Ormus, Drachint, by
which word the Persians and Arabians also denominate it. We call it sometimes
Cassia, and Casia, sometimes small Cane, and sometimes Cinnamon, that is,
China's Amome.

But if we credit Garcias, who was an oculate faithful Narrator, Species.
Cassia, Cinnamon, and small Cane, is one and the same Medicament. Neither are
there more sorts of Cinnamon than two, one growing in Zeilan, the other in
Malabar and Jaca. There are indeed sive degrees of bonity in these two kinds.

The more crass small Cane is Xylocassia, or ligneous Cassia, Cassia Lignea.
Cinnam. ver.
which the Arabians, Persians and Indians call Salthaca. That which is more
odorate, fragrant, and tenuious, is the true Cinnamon, which (...) ^odorate
tree portends; and it is desumed from the same shrub that small Cane comes of.
But Cinnamon is decerped from the trunk whose bark is most crass, the small
Cane from its boughs. Which Theophrastus seems to aim at, when he discerps it
into many parts, asserting that the Cinnamon next the root is worst, and least
^dorate; the supreme best, and most odorate; that in the middle, of a middle
bonity.

Matthiolus cannot resent this opinion of Theophrastus, and others, who assert,
that Cassia and Cinnamon do not differ; he confesses, that Cassia and small
Cane differ not, but that Cinnamon differs from both, and cannot be found; and
if it could be found, that its wood as well as its bark would be of use to
Medicks.

But notwithstanding his authority, we have very good Cinnamon; and it differs
not from small Cane, or sweet Cassia, save in some degrees of bonity; and thus
must the varieties enumerated by Dioscorides be accepted. And, they speak very
probably and rationally, who assert that Xylocassia, or small Cane, is the most
crass and extrmsecal cortex, Cinnamon the more interior, tenuious, odorate,
better, and more commodious for use.

In Galen's time Cinnamon was so rare, that only Emperors possessed it, who
kept it among their Treasures; but its excellency has now caused it to be
brought plenteously to us from peregrine Regions.

Cinnamon-tree is wild and spontaneous, about the magnitude of an Olive Tree,
with many and strait boughs, leaves of Orange-colour, in the form of
Bay Leaves, white flowers, black and round fruit, about the bigness of little
Olives.

Its eximious virtue is in its bark, which calefies, concocts, Vires.
accelerates flowers and birth, and exceedingly recreates the heart.

There is another sort of Cinnamon tree, very much like this in form, whose
odor, sapour and virtue consists not in the bark, as in the East-Indian tree,
but in the fruit only, as Clusiue relates out of Nicolaus Monardus ( e. 25. l.
simpl.)

CHAP. XI. Of Nutmeg, Mace, and Macir.
INdia affords us a certain aromatical Nut, which from its suaveolence is
called Moschocaryon, Moschocarydion, Caryon ar^m^^cum, N^x myristica, and
N^tmeg. It is excerped from a per^grine tree, about the magnitude of a Pear
tree, with leaves like Persica, but shorter, red flower, and peramene odor.

This tree was unknown to the Ancients, especially to the Greek^^ It grows in
the Island Banda, where it is called Palla, Mace, and B^^^palla.

The fruit of this tree is for its suaveolence called Nux moschata, yet it
smells not of Mosch; and it is circumvested with two shells, the one, to wit,
the exterior, is most crass, which gapes when it is mature, as we see Wallnuts
covers; the other is next the N^^, which is more tenuious, which being of a red
color, shows most e^cellently through the chinks of the exterior bark.

And that same tenuious involument is Mace, which dehisces also when the Nut is
exsiccated, and acquires a golden color instead of its red. Mace then is a
thin membrane of a flave color, which covers and complects the Nutmeg.

Now Mace and Macir differ; for Mace is the hull of a Nut, and Macir the crass
flave, or as Pliny says, red bark of a certain wood brought from Barbary,
bitter to the gust, and astrictive; of which tree we can learn no certain
knowledge neither from the ancient nor late Writers; and hence we gather, that
Macir is not well known.

A fresh, heavy, and fat Nutmeg, which at the prick of a needle ^mits an olcous
juice, is best, and most approved.

Both its and Maces faculty are commended for roborating the ventricle, (...)
and helping concoction.

CHAP. XII. Of Peppers.
MAny dissimilar Plants are denominated Peppers, as white, Species.
black, and long Pepper, Calecutian also, or Pepper of India, and watery Pepper,
or Persian; yea some have called Vitex, or Agnus casta, and Ribes, wild black
Pepper. But when Pepper is put absolutely, Garcias admonishes Apothecaries to
select the white as best; for want of which, ours desome black.

The Plant that bears white Pepper differs so little from that which bears
black, that they are the very same to sense; both are s^^^^ive, and so imbecil
and caduce, that unless they be und^rpropped, their lent and flexile branches
will delabe to the earth, like ^^ep-trees, or Wood bind. And they are either
upholden by some su^iciment, or sown at the root of some tree, to whose top
they ascend by convolution. Their leaves are rare, their roots small, their
fruits small, round, and racemously coherent.

All Pepper is calefactive, Vires.
but the white is more potent and o^ora^ than the black; but as the Plant is
rare, so is its fruit. There is Pepper with a caul, of which in its place.

The Plant that bears long Pepper is no congruent to the former in effigies
than in faculties, according to Clusius, Long Pepper.
though Garcias makes them very dissident Plants, for their leaves are equal in
magnitude, both hederaceous, but withal nervous, annexed to a short pedicle.
The fruit of this Plant very much resembles those grains that grow on
Hazle-trees; they issue out of every space betwixt knots opposite against the
pedicles of the leaves, as in other Pepper trees. These fruits consist of many
grains, elegantly composed according to the longitude of their pedicle. They
are green, because they are collected before their maturity, and sometimes
longer, sometimes shorter, as it happens in other fruits not yet come to their
perfect growth.

Macro-Pepper, according to Dioscorides, ( c. 189. l. 2.) Macro-piperis vires.
is very mordaceous; and because it is decerped before its maturity, it is
somewhat amare; it is a good ingredient for Antidotes, and theriacal
Medicaments.

CHAP. XIII. Of Cloves.
CLoves are the grai^s or fruits of a certain exotical tree of the name, which
grows in the Islands of Molucca, in form and magnitude like a Bay Tree, with
leaves like a Peach-tree, or rather Willow, but more angust, with many branches
and flowers, which at first are white, then green, afterward red; and when
they are hardened with the heat of the Sun, black; which represent a rudiment,
or imperfect fruit exsiccated, and exasperated with four points.

This fruit, while green, superates all others in suavity; it empts ou^ of the
extremity of the branches like a nail, whence the vulgarity call it a
Cyroflcous nail; for it better resembles a nail than a out, as its name
depotes, for Garyophillum is a Nut-leaf.

It is h^t and dry above the second degree, Vir^^
and is very useful both in Condiments and Medicaments.

It benefits the heart and brain, helps the liver and stomach, emends the
fetour of the mouth, and gratifies the breath; it helps concoction, rids the
eyes of dimness, and quickens sight, incites to venery, and takes away
obstructions.

CHAP. XIV. Of Cardamomes.
CArdame, Cordumeni, and Cardamome, are Plants that differ but little in name,
but much in nature; for Cardame is a kind of Cresses, with seed and leaf most
calid, and almost adustive, Cardamonum. Cordumeni.
like Mustard. Cordumoni is not Cardamome, as Sylvi^^ thought, but Roman
Carraway.

Cardam^me is a peregrine Plant, Cardamomes.
if not in form, yet in faculty challenging cognation with Amome, as its name
denotes. It grows in India; Species.
whereof there are two sorts, to wit, the greater, which the Arabians call
Cacolaa quebir, and Calcula quebir; and the lesser, which they call Hayl, or
Kakelahil. Both grow on a caul of a cubits height, and not on tall trees, as
some conjecture.

It is a seguminous Plant, C^^ola^ Hayl.
which when it is grown to its height, puts forth cods, and every husk brings
forth grains, which the Barbarians call Cacolaa; some Grana Paradis^. Other
grains, falsely called by this name, are circumvected by Circulators, as
Malegets, so called from Melegueta, the Province where they grow.

Cardamome, though peregrine, is now most notorious and vulgar, and also most
frequently used in Medicine; but the lesser, as it is more odorate, so is it
better, and the greater worse.

Each Cardamome calefies, recreates the principal parts, Vires.
roborates the native heat, discusses flatuosity, and helps concoction.

CHAP. XV. Of Cubebs.
THE Ancients seem to attribute so much to the Arabians, The uncertainty of the
Antiquity.
that whatever they pronounced, they observed as a Law. Yet Barbarism in speech
does not so much move me, as their dissidy in the very thing; which is such,
that they cannot consent about the Plants growing in their own Gardens. Whence
it is no wonder if they dissent about such as grow spontaneously in the
Country, as in the description of Cubebs, The various opinion of the
Physicians about Cubebs.
which Avicenna calls Carpesium; Serapio, wild Myrtle. And the Indians say it is
neither, but another far different Plant which produces Cubobs, which some of
them call Cubab Sini; others, Cumuc; others, Quabeb and Cubebe.

The Plant however is wild and spontaneous, whose imbecil branches adhere like
Smilax, or Pepper-tree; its leaves are like Myrtle leaves, its fruits
racemously congested, every grain cohering by a longer pedicle.

This fruit is so much estimated in Jaoa, and other Regions where it grows,
that the Inhabitants always boil it before they sell it to Merchants; for they
fear lest it should be sown, radicate, and grow in another soil.

They err shamefully that constitute Cubebs to be Vine-seeds, or the fruits of
Butchers-broom, seeing there is no cognation among these Plants. Actuarius is
more tolerable, who consenting with Avicenna, says, that Cubebs are one with
Carpesium, for both are aromatical and calefactive; but their effigies differs,
Carpesium.
for the stalks of Carpesium, according to Galen, are very slender, its
branches like them of Cinnamon, to which in faculty and odor it responds;
only Carpesium is more valid and aromatical, insomuch that the gust perceives
it; and being tenuious, it liberates the bowels of obstructions, moves urine,
expells the stone; yet is it not so tenuious as Cinnamon.

Cubebs are very rare; Vires.
they calefy and roborate the ventricle, free the liver from obstructions,
discuss flatuosity, emend the frigid distemperature of the uterus, and excite
the drowsy faculties to venery.

CHAP. XVI. De Carpobalsamo; And of the fruit, and other part of Balm-tree.
BAlm is a peregrine shrub, growing formerly in Judaea, Egypt, and the valley
of Syria, and most in Jericho; not very fair to look on, of a cineritious
color; it has slender boughs, leaves like sweet Marjoran, which annually
decide in December, and repullulate in the middle of the Spring. Its flowers
are like the small luteous Jasmine, to which a small, aromatical, succulent,
flave, mordaceous and acrimonious seed follows, which smells like Opobalsamum
Balmgum, and is called Carpobalsame.

This Plant is full of branches even to the root, whose surcles are very
slender, fulve, odorate, asperated with many knots, and smells like Balm-oil.

When they are well grown, they abscind these branches, and sell them to
Merchants, who carry them into foreign Countries for lucre sake, for they are
very expetible and vendible in any place; because of their eximious faculties,
Medicks call them Xylobalsamum.

Sometimes they abscind its very caul, Opobalsamum.
whereunto they append a little bottle oblited with wax, whereinto an oleous
liquor of a most fragrant odor does distill. But they more frequently
vulnerate its crasser boughs and cauls with a vitreous, or an Ivory knife, at
the beginning of Autumn; out of which scarification emanes a crass juice like
Oil, which they call Balsamelaeon, and Opobalsamum.

Amongst all Oils and Balsams, this is most approved and commended, whose
faculties are inferior to no Medicament in abigating diseases, whether it be
intrinsecally assumed, or extrinsecally adhibited, or mixed with other
Medicaments.

The Syrian, tenuious and perspicuous, is best, which will delabe and settle in
a vessel full of water, which indeed is common to all legitimate Balms, The
best Balsame.
but chiefly to that that is desumed out of the famous Garden of the Turkish
Emperor, where a small tree is cultivated and kept with great sedulity, three
parts whereof are excerped for the expugnation of many diseases, to wit, its
wood, liquor, and seed, called in the proper idiome of the Medicks,
Xylobalsame, Opobalsame, and Carpobalsame; which being very rare, and not
growing in every region, are possessed only by Kings and Noblemen, for the
vulgar Carpobalsame is not legitimate, its faculties being ignave, almost
inodorate, faint, rancid, exolet, and not suaveolent. And the same may be
pronounced of the wood they call Xylobalsame, for it is the caul of Lentisks
often so corrupted; or inveterate, that it is insipid, inodorous, and
inefficacious.

Medicks have invented three succidaneous Vicegerents for the want of these
three; for Carpobalsame, Cubebs; for Xylobalsame, new and fresh Lentisk; and
for Opobalsame, the Oil of Cloves and Nutmeg, as also the limpid water of
Turpentine tree, (...) as Oil; for Turpentine is the very Mother of artificial
Balms, the parts of whose Plants respond well to the parts of natural Balm.

There are now two other sorts of Balm circumvected; Bal. de Poru.
the one called Peruvian Balm, which is educed out of a certain fruit growing
in Peru, whereof Clusius makes mention. De Tolu.
Another they call Balm of Tolu, from a certain region of India, which distills
out of a sauciated tree, like little Pines; both of them are endued with
eximious faculties, and may be very well substituted instead of Sy^^ack.

CHAP. XVII. Of Kermes.
MAny Plants will only grow in the Meridional, others in the Septentrional,
and some in both regions; as that same grain which the Mauritanians call
Kermes; which very denomination, according to Dioscorides, demonstrates the
Plant to be exotical, and to grow in Asia, Armenia, or Arabia; for in two
usurpations it reserves its Arabian nomenclature, to wit, in the confection of
Alkermes, and in dying clothes of a Bermesian color.

Now Kermes, or Karmas, is the name of a suffruticeous Plant, Kermes seu
Karmas, quid.
and its grain, which is vulgarly called Scarlet dye, or infector^ grain.

It grows both in the aforesaid places, and in Orleans in France, and many
places in Italy which are hot, and tend toward the Meditenancan Sea; and it is
reposed amongst the aculeous Ilices; for their variety is manifold; whereof
some are glandiserous, which grow into tall trees; others coccigerous, which
are lower; some bacciferous, which are of a middle consistency, as Holly.
Aquifoyl, which is frequent and vivacious in the Septentrional soil. Yet some
exclude this Plant from the number of Ilices, although the two for^^^ have not
so much affinity each with other, as the later with this.

The Plant then whereon Kermes grows, is a certain small Ille^, putting forth
many cauls, which are harder toward the root, obtenebrated with leaves
continually green, long, ^^gged about, de^se, sinuous, angulous, spinous,
aculeated, and horrid, which at the beginning of the Spring conceives as it
were a little egg toward i^ root, which it obvallates with pricks supernally
devolved, which in its growth changes its color from white to cineritious,
then to purple, and at last acquires a most elegant color: for the whole grain
is fu^^ of sanguineous liquor, which after perfect maturity, and too long
coaction in its membrane, produces worms, whereof some are winged, Succus Kermes
and fly away: yet before the procreating of them, the liquor may be studiously
extracted, to the confection of Alkermet, and scarlet tincture.

The generation of these little Animals, or may be hindered, or their death
procured, by the aspersion of a little vinegar, whereby their exanimated
carcasses are collected, and coacted into a mass, like Vermilion, which they
call S^^achul.
Scaletium; and Pli^^y, Cusculium, for the tincture of purple, or skarlet
color.

This grain is not the fruit, but excrement of this Illex; or a (...) and lucid
gum contained in a husk, which grows about the root of the leaves. This Illex
is not only coccigerous, but glandiferous also; for the more inveterate
surcles bring forth Acorns somewhat longer and blacker than those of the Oaks,
but then it ceases to produce grains, Coccum Baph.
or * Coccum. And therefore these surcles are prescinded, that a new spring of
surcles may follow, and be cocciferous.

Kermes exceedingly roborates the heart, Vires.
and all its faculties; it also astringes precided nerves and wounds by its
glutinous sacult^^ when extrinsecally adhibited.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Schoenanthum, or Squinant.
S'Choenanthum is an odorate bullrush growing in India, from whence it is
brought to us in bundles, being incicurable by all Art.

It is a junceous and gramineous Plant, whose small, dry, hard and nodous root
emits hard, straggling, round, full, not conca^e, and clear reeds, gracile
toward the top; whose rigid, mucronated, and pale leaves of half a palms
length, amplect its gramineous surcles.

Two sorts of flowers, palely red, and pappous, adorn its su^^ity; some call
is, the reed of (...), others, Camels food, because Ap^ricane Camels feed on
its summities. I^s flowers are seldom brought to us with it, though it be
denominated from them.

Schoenanthum is moderately calefactive and astrictive; Vires.
and because its parts are tenuious, it moderately digests and repells; the
root is more astrictive than the other parts of the Plant; the flower is
hotter, which potently moves urine and flowers.

CHAP. XIX. Of Folium, or Malabather; the Indian leaf so called.
A Certain eximious Leaf is brought to us from India, which the Arabians call
(Cadegi Indi) that is, Indian Leaf, which the Inhabitants call Tamalapatra, and
the Apothecaries, with reference to its native soil, Malabathre. It is a leaf
like the leaf of the Medicks Apple Tree, of a palid green color, with three
strokes percurring its longitude; it is odorate, smelling like Cloves.

It does not swim upon water, nor grow in the Indian fens, nor yet without
root, as Dioscorides thought; but it is desumed from a tall tree, far from
waters, fru^icating in dry places.

Malabathrum is hot in the second degree, odorate, moves urine, Vires.
emends ones breath, keeps clothes from moths, and in other qualities concords
with Spicknard; which may be well substituted, Succidanium.
when it cannot be had.

CHAP. XX. Of Spicknard.
DIoscorides ( c. 6. l. 1.) Species.
makes mention of two sorts of Spicknard, one Indian, the other Syrian, both
growing in one Mountain, but the one on that side that looks toward India, the
other on that that looks toward Syria. He afterward adjoyns the Celtian, that
grows on the mountains of Liguria, which is called Saliunca, from its native
Country name; and the mountainous, which grows in Cilicia, and Syria,
sometimes called ^bylacitis, and Niris.

Lobelius makes two sorts of Celtian Spicknard, or Celtick-Nard; Species Nard,
Celliae.
the one with leaves like skrewed Gentian, and a root like the greater
Valerian; the other called hirculus, whereof Clusius records, that he gathered
Fascicles among the Celtian Spicknard.

Besides the peregrine Spicknard, and its related species, we have some Plants
celebrated with this denomination, Lavendula major. Pseud^nard us. Aspica.
as the greater Levendula, which in the French idiome is called Aspic, and by
some, Pseudo-Spicknard; out of which a kind of Oil is extracted by Chemistry,
commonly called Oil of Aspic; as also another great Lavendula, to wit, the
Cerulean or Italian; and also another lesser Lavendula, of the same color,
odor, and effigies. Stoechas that is spicated, may also be referred to this
rank.

But when Spicknard is written without further addition, it is always meant of
the Indian, out of whose exile root grows certain spicated hairs, and thick
glomorations, discriminated by wreaths and tufts, out of whose middle issue
junceous leaves.

Spicknard calefies in the first degree, Vires.
and desiccates in the second; it helps the liver and the ventricle, moves
urine, cures the pains of the stomach, and exsiccates the humidity of the
mesentery. Indian or black Spicknard is most fanative to bodily affections.

CHAP. XXI. Of Agalloche, or Aloes wood.
ALoes tree is by the Greeks called Xylal^e, Lignum Aloe.
and Agallochum, it is like an Olive tree, sometimes greater, and not
circumvested with a skin, as Dioscorides writes, but with a crass bark. Its
wood is odorate and blackish, maculated with some cineritious strokes and
spots; it is ponderous, crass, compact, and succulent; which adhibited to the
fire, or accended, (it will not flame) exudes much liquor.

Its odor is not perceptibly dispersed through the universal matter of the
wood, but it is more fragrant in the very middle, and the dry is more
suaveolent than the green.

The tree is very rare, The variety of it.
growing only in India, and in such Regions and Promontories where Tigers and
wild ravenous Beasts make their abode; whence it is, that neither a great tree
can be cut down, nor young shrub evelled, without great danger and peril. Hence
the Ancients foolishly credited, that it grew in Paradise.

Serapi^ mentions more sorts thereof than he either saw or knew; perhaps more
odorate woods may be referred to Agalloche. So the odorate tree growing in the
Promontory of Comorin, is by some called Aloes tree, when by Garcias it is a
different Plant.

Agalloche, Vires.
or Aloes wood, called by Avicenna, Agalugen, is hot and dry in the second
degree, and is very good against the affections of the heart.

CHAP. XXII. Of Santals, or Sanders.
THE wood of a certain tall peregrine tree, like a Wallnut tree, is brought to
us, which in the Island Tymor, where it grows, they call Chandama; in Arabia,
Sandal; in Europe, Santal: whereof there are three sorts, the white, pale,
which are frequent in Tymor; and red, which grows in the Island Tanasarim, as
Garcias ab horto, tells us, who says there is so much affinity betwixt the
Santal-trees, that the pale can scarce be discerned from the white, save by the
Inhabitants that cut down the trees, and sell them to the Merchants; for the
effigies of both is one, the leaves the same, both very green, like Lentisks
leaves; their flowers are of a ceruleous black color; their fruits about the
magnitude of Cherries, first (...), then black, which are insipid and diciduous.

The pale or citrine Santal-tree fruticates best in aprike places; Which is
best.
it is more odorate and better than the white, and yet the white much excells
the red; the red is inodorate, very like Brafil, but not so sweet nor
infective, nor yet so hard and ponderous.

The Ancients attributed great virtue to Santals, Vires.
for they exhilarate and roborate the heart, and vital parts, according to
Avicenna; they are averse to hot and feverish diseases, they liberate
obstructions, and much recreate the liver.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Sassafras.
A Very grand tree grows in Florida, which the Indians call Paccame, the
Spaniards, Sassafras, with a tall caul, circumvested with a cineritious and
thin bark, boughs expanded at the top, leaves like Fig leaves, dirempted into
three angles, roots sometimes crass, sometimes slender, according to the ag^ of
the tree, expanded along the interior caverns of the earth, which are somewhat
aromatical, smelling like Fennel.

The tree fruticates best in maritimous and temperate places; its root is best,
and especially the bark thereof, which is hot and dry in the beginning of the
third degree.

Its other parts participate of both qualities only in the second degree.
Besides its elementary qualities, it is endued with peculiar ones, for which it
is very expetible and useful: but because of its rarity, Circulators pulverate
Box wood, and Fennel seed, and sell it for Sassafras; for they think they can
well enough deceive the Vulgar, if for the true Sassafras, which is of a fulve
color, and Fennel odor, they can exhibit this flave Powder, smelling like
Fennel.

The decoction of Sassafras, according to Clusius, is good against all kinds of
diseases, especially obstructions, women's diseases, and French pox; it
roborates the internal parts.

CHAP. XXIV. Of Guajacum.
SIX simple Medicaments are much commended for the cure of Morbus G^llious, to
wit, Sassafras, Guajacum, Sarsaparilla, Chyna, Mercury, and Cynabar^^^ (...)
assafras we have already treated, of the rest in order. G^ajacum is so called
by the Indians, from the German word Guajacam; by the Latins, Lign^m sanctum;
it is brought from the Western Islands Boriquen, C^enga, Nagrande, and
Nicaragua.

It is a tall tree, in magnitude and effigies like an Illex, or Oak, ramous,
blackish in the middle, hard, with a crass and fat bark, small and hard leaves,
luteous and purgative flowers, which the Indi^^^ condite and assume, to purge
their bodies.

Their fruits that follow the flowers, are of the magnitude of Chestnuts, and
like two Lupines conjoined.

There is another sort of Guajacum which is lesser, but better, which they call
Palus Christi, Palus sanctu^, Palma sancta.
and sometimes Lignum sanctum; it is a shrub in color, faculties, magnitude
and form, much unlike the great Guajacum: for the matter of its wood is white,
concolorate, and very fibrous; its sapour is sharper, odor more fragrant, and
qualities more efficacious. But because it is very rare, in want thereof we
usurp G^ajacum, which is endued with the same faculties, but more infirm.

Both of them are prevalent in curing the French disease; Vires.
for they calefy, incide, atte^uate, open, move sudour, exarceate putretude,
and by special properties extinguish venereous poison.

CHAP. XXV. Of Sarsaparilla.
THere comes a certain long and uniform root from the Western Islands,
especially from Per^, and the Province Honduras, which is sometimes called
Sarsaparilla, sometimes Salsaparilla, and Sarzaparaglia; which Matthiglus and
D^donaeus think to be the same with our Smilax: but they differ much, for
Smilax root is nodous, and geniculated like grass root, and much shorter and
softer. Sarsaparilla's root is without knots, asperated with no genicles, hard,
fibrous, rugous, pithy, and sometimes twenty foot long, which may be easily
cleft like a twig. Its other parts are like Smilax, and climbs vicine Plants,
as Smilax does.

Sarsaparilla calefies moderately, opens, projects sudour, Vires.
and extinguishes the venereous poison.

The Indians use its juice to cure the venereous disease, which to them is
natural and endemial.

CHAP. XXVI. Of Chyna root.
I May not omit this other Antidote against the Indian disease, to wit, that
excellent (...), which, as also the whole Plant, has its name from Chy^^^
(...) in its native foyl retains its Countries name, to wit, (...). It grows in
the vast region of Chyna, which terminates (...), and Scythia, not in
mountainous and dry ground (...) conjectured, but in fens and moist places like
a reed, as (...) ^^ore, or head of some fountain.

Its root is crass and nodous, as red^ (...) hard also, and tuberous, like the
Brambles root; and rubeous a^^ ^tortuous, like Bistorts root. Slender and
imbecil cauls crupt out of its root, which are circumcinged with very rare
leaves; which though low, require fulciments, that they may be strait.

This root is now vulgar; which the Ancients either knew not, or oscitantly
pretermitted; but now it is so notorions, that no Barber, or young Apprentice,
but he will talk thereof. The Indians use this Medicament as pan^^^macal to all
diseases, and especially to such as cannot be cured by other remedies.

It is very prevalent in curing the Indian Pox; Vires.
it helps the Vertigo, cures the pain of the stomach, helps the hydroptical,
cures the coli^^^ color, and affections of the uterus, removes obstructions,
ope^^ ^he passages, moves urine, causes sudour, helps in convulsions and
palsy, and eases the dolor of the articles: for Charles, the fifth Emperor
of that name, found no ease from other Medicaments, but much from Chyna,
against the Gout, which handled him very ill. Some say that it is good for such
as are tabid, but I think too hot to cure the consumption, to emend a dry
distemper, and resarciate it.

Garcias used it against the heat of the liver so long, that his body was
almost wholly inflamed. Its use is now more rare than formerly it has been.

SECTION IV. Of Indigenous Calefactives.
The Preface.
WE have many hot Plants which will not grow in foreign Countries, of which we
intend to speak distinctly in this fourth Section. And they are such as either
grow spontaneously in the Fields, or by culture in Gardens. Wherein we shall
observe this method, first, touch upon those that are h^ttest, then such as are
hotter; and lastly, those that are moderately hot; all which we shall run over
with brevity; yet not so, but that their qualities may be distinctly known. And
therefore we shall begin with such as have a fiery kind of quality; as,

CHAP. I. Of Bartram, or Pellitory.
BArtram, or Pyrethrum, is so called from that igneous quality which its chewed
root leaves in the gustative organ; the Vulgar call it Alexander's foot; the
Latins, from the abundance of spittle it causes in the mouth, call it Herba
salinaris.

It is an herb of a cubits height, or more; in its caul and leaves emulating
the wild Daucus, or vulgar Carret, are multifariously divided, and sected into
small capillaments, like Fennel; its flower that erupts out of the summities of
its surcles, is fair, broad, and patulous, like a Marigold, but larger,
subluteous in its orb, and circumdated with little angust, long leaves,
supernally whitish, and on the contrary fide of a purple color, in the middle
of its orb, and between the leaves issues a small, long, and odorate seed.

Its root is crass, long, and of a blackish red color.

It grows in many places of Italy and Spain, and fruticates, flourishes and
perfects its seed when it is sown in Gardens in Holland: but it grows more
copiously and floridly in hot and Eastern Regions; and we enumerate it amongst
our indigenous Plants, because we have it in Europe and the Western
Countryes-pretty plentiful.

There is another Plant, which by its acrimonious odor moves sternutation,
which Apothecaries call wild Pyrethrum, because by its vellicative sapour it
moves the gust like Bartram, and promotes spittle; which grows in mountainous
and incultivated places, also in meadows and hedges.

Pyrethrum's root is hot in the fourth degree; detained in the mouth, it
projects phlegm copiously, and therefore it helps the toothache proceeding from
a frigid cause; it helps also the diuturnal headache, the Apoplexy, Epilepsy,
Palsy, and all affections arising from phlegm congested in the head.

CHAP. II. Of Mustard.
MUstard is no Aliment, sometimes a Medicament, often a Condiment; for it is
most conveniently admixed to viscid and glutinous dishes, especially in winter,
that their viscidity may be corrected, and the ventricle thereby roborated; for
it admirably helps such as have dull palats, and nauseate their meat. But
because by its acrimony it importunely affects the gust, it is not only
grinded with vinegar, to mitigate its fervor, but mixed with sweet wine, to
obdulcorate its acrimony; and so is made a grateful Condiment, which many for
its vulgarity disestimate.

Mustard is either sative or spontaneous;

The other sative Mustard is so like the former,

The wild grows spontaneously in any dry place, and sometimes in humid places,
brinks, and hedges; it is less than the former, bearing lesser leaves, jagged,
almost like Shepherds-purse, but more acute; it emits luteous quadrifolious
flowers; it afterward puts forth its seed in husks, which it varies, sometimes
bearing white, sometimes red seed.

This Plant denominates a noble Medicament they call Synapismum, which is
celebrated to many uses, as to inveterate Head-achs, Epilepsy, Vertigo,
difficulty of breathing, distillations, and the Gout.

Mustard is hot and dry in the fourth degree; it incides, attenuates, Vires.
extracts; detained in the mouth, it moves phlegm; brayed and snuffed up the
nose, it causes sternutation; it excites women suffocated with the histerical
passion: but such as have imbecil and caliginous eyes, should altogether eschew
it.

CHAP. III. Of Thlaspi, or Treacle-Mustard.
MUstard and Thlaspi are rightly described in the same series; for both agree,
if not in effigies, yet much in qualities; so that Thlaspi is commonly called
Country, Species.
or Treacle-Mustard. There are many kinds of Thlaspis, whereof three are most
noted, one greater, another lesser, and another mean, whereunto all the rest of
that name are referred.

The first grows plentifully both in cultivated and incultivated Fields, with
large, long, crisped leaves, acute toward the end; its caul is about half a
foot long, emitting boughs, circumcinged with flowers, at first white, which
are frequent at the beginning of Summer, not unlike Shepherds-purse, which
convolving themselves into two valvuls, produce a blackish, hot, and sharp
seed, in sapour like Mustard, or Nasturtium.

The second has a ramous caul of a foot high; its leaves are lesser, angust,
acuminated, and subverted; its flowers white, seed small, sharp and hot, like
Nasturtium.

The third and less Thlaspi is an Herb with angust leaves, of a fingers length,
converting themselves downwards, and a little incided in their extremities; its
flowers are whitish, caul slender and ramous, of a foot high, whereon many
small, plain husks, like little Lentils on small pedicles, do depend in an
excellent series; wherein a small seed, affecting the mouth and tongue with a
sharp sapour like Mustard, is enclosed.

It grows in incultivated, stony, mountainous, hot and dry places, as on many
walls and houses; whence some Herbalists call it Tectorium Nasturtium, and
sometimes Countrey-Mustard. Its seed is used in Antidotes; yet he shall not
much err, that in defect thereof usurps other seeds.

Many referr many more Plants, bearing sharp and servent seed, to the Thlaspi;
but feeing they dissent much in effigies, others referr them rather to Plants
more affine in form: for the Thlaspi of Crateva, which seems to be a
latifolious Violet, called Bolbonac, as also Draba, by some called Thlaspi,
have little or no affinity with the rest of that name. Vires.


Its seed is not and dry in the fourth degree; it breaks impostumes, moves
flowers, kills the young in the uterus, helps the sciatical; infunded at the
fundament, it evacuates blood, and pollicitates many more commodities, if
rightly and opportunely usurped. It is mixed with some Antidotes.

CHAP. IV. Of Rockett.
ROcket, which the Greeks call Euxomon, is sown in Gardens for Condiments sake;
for it is both good and useful in Sallets and Pottage for such whose internal
cal^ur languishes, and whose lust to venery is dull; for Rotlet revokes venery,
and accelerates the husband slow to congress; whence Poets call it, Herba salas.
the Salacious Herb.

It rises a cubit high, with angust, long leaves, lacinated on both sides with
deep, but rare incisures, with palid, and sometimes hueous and quadrifolious
flowers; seed like Turnep seed, and a white and dure root; it grows sometimes
spomaneously among branches, and other rough and incultivated places.

There is also erratical and wild Rocket, which grows in squalid places near
high ways, and town walls, with leaves like Sowthistles, but more slender and
small; with flowers of a luteous color, like them of Brassica, which erupt in
the middle of Summer.

Bank-creffes, which some call Iri^, others T^rtela, do so much resemble Rocket
both in gust and form, that they call it Rocket: yet seeing Galen reposes
Erysimum amongst alimental Plants, I will scarce enumerate it among wild
Rockets.

Eruca is also the name of a certain Insect, as well as an Heth, whereof there
are many differences desumed from their dissidency in color and magnitude,
whereof we neither will, nor ought now to treat, it being our purpose to speak
only of such Simples as are Ingredients necessary to Compositions in
Pharmacopolies.

Rocket calefies and siccates in the third degree, Vires.
extenuates the spleen, cures the bitings of Mice and Spiders, excites venery,
moves urine, deleates black skars, if illited with Oxe-gail, and emaculates
freckles.

CHAP. V. Of Nettle.
THere are two general differences of Nettles, Species.
one whose leaves are improbously mordacious, and surcle hurting the
contrectants hands with its pungent down; the other innoxious, which may be
handled without molestation. The former is by the Greeks called sometimes
Acalyphe, because it is injucund to the tact; sometimes Cnide, because it
punges mordaciously, commonly called Quick-Nettle; the other is called Lami^us,
and Anonium, as also white, or dead Nettle.

There be also three sorts of quick Nettles, the two greater, and one lesser,
all wild and spontaneous. Some call these wild ones, masculine and seminine
Nettles, as superating one another in procerity.

The Romans call that Masculine in the first place, which emits round surcles
of half a cubits height, and sometimes longer, cave, and hollow, with broad,
mucronated, simbrious, crisped leaves, rough and mordaceous on both sides,
which by their contact excite lumps and ustion, and rubefy the skin. The seed
is included in small pills, round and hispid, which proceed out of the root of
the leaves.

That Feminine in the second, which produces seed not globularly, but
racemously, like Grape clusters, after the manner of the feminine Mercury; its
caul is higher, and more ramous; its ^ea^es broader, and all its parts
mordacious.

The third sort is the least, and yet most ramous, mordacious, and graveolent,
producing its seed racemously, but not after the manner of the former; for many
grains erupt out of the surcie at the foot of the leaves together, but each one
has a pedicle like the masculine Nettle. This third sort is called Dog-Nettle,
and is most of all mordaeious.

They all grow in incultivated places, about hedges, dams, and old walls, and
sometimes in Gardens, and in fat soyls.

All Nettles siccate exceedingly, but calefie not so much; for though Urtica be
ab urendo, Nettle from burning, yet they are not ustive from their heat, but by
cansing such a pain from their pungent down: for ( Macer. c. 2. l. 2.) Nettles
decocted are very ignavely hot, they help the orthopnoical, moves urine and
flowers; their feed stimulates to venery, and is a present Antidote against the
poison of Hemlock. It helps also against the malignant quality of Henbane,
Mushromes, and Quick-filver, as also the bitings of Serpents, and poisonous
Beasts. The seed of the mascussine Nettle is thought best.

Here we may not omit, To help those that are slung with Nettles.
that Oil conduces much to the ease of those pustuls and dolours excitated by
Nettles; as also Elder leaves bruised and adhibited, which by a special
propriety respect this affection.

Many other Plants are reposed amongst Nettles, which are sometimes called
Lamia, sometimes dead Nettles; whereunto another Plant is referred, which the
Romans call Labio, which some think is Agripalma, or Cardiack; others,
Galeopsis, and Galeobdolon.

The first sort of these dead Nettles are those that assurge to a cubital
procerity with Nettle leaves, soft, and crisped, sometimes of a whitish,
sometimes reddish color.

The second very like the former, but not so ramous, with flowers like Spurge,
but purpureous, issuing out of the genicles of its surcles.

The third is lesser, more imbecil and fetid, with rounder leaves, which is
seldom, if at all used in Medicinal Confections. Some now of late make a syrup
of the flowers of other Nettles for the affections of the lungs and breast,
which they call Syrupus de Lamis: but its effect does not celebrate it.

CHAP. VI. Of Flower de luce, or Orris.
ACertain Lilly, whose flower in its variegated color emulates the Rainbow,
painted in an opake cloud opposite to the Sun, is thence called Iris; whereof I
have often noted twenty two sorts and varieties, which to recenseate, were
superfluous.

But two especially are most frequently used in Medicine; the one our
indigenous flower, which is of a ceruleous color, and sweet odor, whose root
potently educes waters; and the Tuscan or Flerentine Iris, whose root is white,
but flower much whiter, and both very fragrant; which pre-excells the other,
save in educing serous humors out of the belly.

All Flower-de-luce has long leaves like swords, and nodous roots; except a
sew, whose roots are bulbous, and flowers patulous, like Lillyes, but with
small leaves more reflected, three of which lesser sort are interposed amongst
the three greater; after which, two or three husks that are triangular come
forth, whereon angular seeds are contained.

The ceruleous Flower-de-luce, which some call, the Celestial Lilly, is most
expetible in Pharmacopolies; for its root is hydragogous, and useful to the
hydroptical; and an Oil may be made of its flowers, good for many things. The
Florentinian is best, for it is cephalical, aromatical, cordial, incisive, and
apertive. All Flowersde-luce calefy, extenuate, cure gripings, and expel
flowers, being, according to Dioscorides, ( c. 1. l. 1. universally useful.

CHAP. VII. Of Helecampane.
ENulacampane puts forth leaves from its very root, which are long, late,
mucronated, hispid, and numerous; its caul is hard, of three cubits length, or
more; its flowers are aureous, and stellated like Oxe-eye, or Flea-bane, which
turn into knaps, the seed, which is like Thistle-seed, remaining.

Its root is great, crass, flave, odorate, and suaveolent; it grows in fat and
humid places; the best is brought from Helena, where the Poets feign that it
sprung up from Helena's tears, whence it had its name. Some say, Helena sowed
it there to kill Serpents; for it is very efficacious against poisons, not
only such as infect men, but also and chiefly such as harm beasts; for given
to Sheep in wine and vinegar, it keeps them from, and cures them in the
pestilence, whereunto they are obnoxious, which the Vulgar call Clavelate.

Some think that the root of Hellecampane should be desumed instead of the
unknown root of Behen; to whom I easily assent: Succidanium.
for if Helecampane be not Behen, it is a good substitute.

Helecampane's ropt is manifestly hot; Vires.
it moves urine and flowers; mandicated, it confirmates teeth; and condited,
cures the cough, ( Diosc. c. 27. l. 1.) the decoction of the root epoted, cures
convulsions, orthopnoity, pestilence, and bitings of Serpents.

CHAP. VIII. Of Cyperus.
CYperus is a triangular rush, growing in moist and marish places, of a cubits
or higher procerity, whose lower part is white, and top black; it produces
long, gracile, arundinaceous, hard, cultellated leaves, with panicles depending
on its summity, amongst which the seed lurk. Its roots are round, nodous, long,
implicated one amongst another, and reptant like grass roots, blackish without,
and subluteously white within, which are odorate, pleasant, and amare. The
roots are only useful, the other parts good for little.

The root excellsses without mordacity, Vires.
potently exsiccating ulcen, and perducing them to a skar, which for its
astrictive faculty is very conducible to the ulcers of the mouth; it moves
flowers and urine, and being drunk, helps the stone and dropsy.

There is another kind of Cyperus very like this in effigy, but its root is
more nodous and rotund, whence it is called round Cyperus.

Dioscorides makes mention of a Cyperus in India like Ginger, which masticated
in the mouth, makes the juice of Saffron color; which is amare and acrimonious
to the gust; and erasive, if illited on a place.

CHAP. IX. Of Angelica.
IT IS a wonder that the Ancients either knew not, or spoke not of this noble
Plant, for whose rare faculties the more recent denominated it Angelica; than
which, Europe produces not a more fragrant and pleasant Plant. It is more than
two cubits high, with a geniculated, skrewed, palid, cave and ferulaceous caul;
its leaves are ample, soft, green, and crisped like Alexanders leaves; its root
is very crass and long, sometimes disterminated into many roots, most odorate
and aromatical; out of which an oleous liquor exudes, of the same odor with
the leaves and branches; its seeds are yellowish, plain, broad, and membranous.

There are three sorts of Angelica, Species.
two domestic, and one wild; one of the domestic, which is above described,
seems to be a kind of Laserpitium; the other, which is lesser, is like it in
odor, form, and faculties, differing only in magnitude.

The wild one is like these in root, caul, leafs, heads, odor, flower, and
gust, only its odor and sapour is not so sweet; it delights in cold, moist,
and meadowish places; it seems to be that Herb which Dodonaeus and Clusius call
Archangelica; yet if that name be meet for any Herb, it is more proper to the
true Angelica.

It is hot and dry in the second degree; Vires.
it opens, attenuates, and digests; it incides and discusses crass humors; it
is averse to poisons, conduces in pestilentious diseafes, moves flowers, and
recreates the heart and its faculties.

CHAP. X. Of Libistichum, or Ligusticum, or Lovage.
THe affinity in form among Simples, causes much ambiguity in discerning their
distinct Species; for what Laserpitium is, how it is differenced from
Libisticum; how both from Angelica Imperatoria and Smyrnium, can scarce be
collected from the writings of the learned: but as much as I can attain by
conjecture and reason, Ligusticum, which in the shops they call Levisticum, is
a plant in altitude equalizing some arboreous shrubs, with a geniculated cause,
hollow within, leafes like paludapium, but bigger, lacinious, and as it were
disterminated and incided into many parts, of a pale green shining color,
capitulated with Umbells, coronated with small and subluteous flowers shining
on every side, to which a long, round, strewed seed succeeds like fennel seed,
acrimonious to the gust, and suaveolent. ( Diosc. C. 51. L. 3.)

Its root is white and odorate like the Hungarian Alheal: whence some call it
Panacea.

They err, who think it is Smyrnium, or Hiposelinum; and they more, who
contend, that it is not only Silvium or Laserpitium, but a succe educed out of
that plant, and is called Belzoni: for this Gum comes out of a tall tree, the
Syreniack juice out of Laserpitium, which is a ferulaceous plant; and out of
Libisticum or Lumbrady, either no juice is educed, or none of it preserved
after eduction; whether the Syreniack juice be sweet Asa, or Belzoin, shall be
declared in its place.

Ligusticum grows plenteously in Liguria, and in the Mountain Apenninus, where
it is called Panacea, Species.
because it resembles the Heraclea panax in its root, caul, and faculties.
Panacea is fourfold, the Syrian, the Heraclean, the Chironian, and the
Centaurean, which some call the Pharnacean; but I leave these to the exact
discussers of Simples, who write the History of all Herbs, and return to my
purpose.

The Roots and Seeds of Ligusticum are calefactive, Vires.
and therefore help concoction, roborate the ventricle, dissipate Flatuosity,
move Urine and flours, take away the suffocation of the uterus, and cure the
bitings of Serpents.

CHAP. XI. Of Seseli, or Hartwort.
MAny Plants dissident in effigies are donated with this name, as Massiliense,
Aethiopicum the herb, Aethiopicum the shrub, Creticum or Thordylium,
Peloponnense pratense and herbaceum, or that which is like hemblock: the
Massilian Seseli, which is most useful in medicine, has a ferulaceous caul, of
two Cubits height, Seseli Massiliense.
geniculated, and hard; its leases like Fennel, but more ample, large and
crasse, with white flowers in Umbells; long seeds like Fennel, which are very
acrimonious, and yet grateful, whereof Medicks make much use.

The Ethiopian fruticious Seseli has lignous, Aethiopicum jrutex.
rigid, subrubeous and cubital surcls, long leafes, which are indifferent
broad, smooth, and a whitish green: yellow flowers upon umbells, and long seeds
like Libisticum.

The Ethiopian herbaceous Seseli, Aethiop. Herba.
has ferulaceous bicubital cauls, broad leafs like paludapium, umbells
referted with white flowers, membranous, broad, plain, paleaceous, odorate, and
grateful seed.

The Peloponnesian Seseli, Peloponeuse.
has a geniculated and ferulaceous caul, broad leafes variously dissected,
patulous Umbells, subluteous flowers, broad, long, plain seed; and a crass root
somewhat blackish without, white within, acrimonious and amare, and grievous to
the stomach.

The Cretian Seseli has a low and more obsequious Caul, leass incided and
crisped in their margin, small white flowers in umbells, small, broad, plain,
odorate, and acrimonious seeds, which are seldom used in medicine.

All Seseli seed is hot and dry in the second degree, expels urine, Vires.
draws flowers and the young; and educes urine from the reins and bladder, the
seed of the Massilian is best.

CHAP. XII. Of Gentian.
GEntian is not underservedly extolled, nor yet indignly denominated after
Gentius King of Illyrium; for it is a most solemn fugatour of pestilence,
destroyer of putretude, and antidote against Poison; its Leafes are like
Plantain, or rather white Hellebore, veinous, a foot long, very amare, and of a
redly green color; its Caul is cubitall or higher, out of whose several
genicls issue flowers, consisting of six small angust and radiant leafes
vertiginously disposed, to which broad tenuious seeds succeed, which are
included in the long Cauls whereon the flowers stood.

It grows in any place, but delights more in montanous so they be opaque; the
best come from Illyrium, where it arrogated the princely name of its inventor:
its root is of chiefest use.

Gentian especially in its root, comprises so much of virtue, that it keeps not
only men, Vires.
but beasts also from the harm of poison, drunk in water it corroborates the
stomach, kills the worms, arceates puttertude; tames pestilentious poison, and
securely cures the stinging of poisonous animalls.

Other plants from some similitude acquire the name of Gentian, as the lesser
Cruciata and Gentianella; but their faculties being little or not at all like
the true Gentians, they seldom ingrede the composition of Antidotes.

CHAP. XIII. Of Tormentill.
THis plant is called Tormentilla, The denomination.
because it leniates the torment and pain of Odontalgy or toothache; and
Septafoile, by the Greeks Heptaphyllon, because it consists of seven leafes; it
grows in shady, woody, and opaque places; it puts forth many slender simbecil
and lower branches, betwixt every knot it emits seven leafes of inequal
magnitude, luteous flowers; a crasse, tuberous, short root, black without, red
within, whose use is eximious in curing pestilentious diseases.

Its root calefies moderately, dryes exceedingly, to wit, Vires.
in the third degree; it astringes moderately, wonderfully opposes putretude,
moves sudor, and efficaciously sucurres in pestilentious diseases.

CHAP. XIV. Of Poeony.
POEony is an herb eximious in name, flower and faculties; it has many
branches of feets length, with fair rubeous flowers on their summities, ample
like Roses, whence some call them Saint Mary's Roses.

There are three sorts of Poeony; The first is the Masculine, Species.
which has leafs like Walnut-trees, but lesser in circuit, and more crasse.

The second bears leafs divided like Lovage, lesser then the former, of a dark
green color, with shorter surcl's, and all things less, which is the
foeminine.

The third seems to be neuter or promiscuous, bearing an Idea of both, which is
neither absolutely red, nor white, but pale.

Some grow now in Gardens altogether white, and very fair; the most elegant
whereof is multiflorous, whose flower is not simple like the rest, but manifold.

All have tuberous and multifidous roots, but some of them are more glandulous
then the rest; they have long cauls, divided leafs, patulous flowers, in the
summity of their cauls there are husks like Almond husks, which dehisceing show
their small red splendent grains like Orange grains, and in the middle some
black lucid, medullous ones, of a medicated sapour, acrimonious, subastringent,
with some amaritude. I describe these briefly, lest my Work should swell into a
greater Volume: Many things are supersititiously spoken of Poeony; which I
willingly omit, not judging them worthy recital.

Its roots are commended to the roboration of the Nerves and Brain, Vires.
to exarceate the Epilepsie, and cure it, as also to roborate the whole Head.

CHAP. XV. Of Rubia, or Madder.
THis Plant from its rubetude is by the Latins called Rubia, by the Greeks
Erythrodanum; it puts forth quadrangular, sharp, and geniculated boughs from
the very ground; with angust, long, sharp leafes, orbicularly digested about
the genicls; its flowers in the summities of its branches are small and
luteous, to which a small round seed succeeds, which at first is green, after
red, at last black.

Its roots are very long, numerous, flexibly dispersed along the ground, red
within and without, wherewith wool and skins are infected or dyed; the Shopmen
calls it Dyers Ruby, the vulgar Garensa; it grows spontaneously in shady and
opaque places, so that all regions abound therewith; its root is amare to the
gust, accommodated to infect and dye woollen, and therefore most used by Dyers.

Ruby root moves urine and flours, Vires.
cures the jaundice, its seed drunk in vinegar absumes the Spleen; its root
applied draws flours, seconds, and the birth; and illited with vinegar, it
cures the tetter or ringworm.

CHAP. XVI. Of Oinon, or Rest-Harrow.
THis plant is called Onon, Resta Bovis.
Or Oinon, from its flower which in color represents wine; the Barbarians call
it the Oxens arrest, Remora Aratri. Acutella.
or rest; the Romans the Ploughes remora, because its long and fibrous roots
remorate the Oxen in ploughing: it is also called Acutella, because with hard
and acure pricks it punges its attingents; it is a most notorious plant,
growing in the middle or margins of fields, especially in fat and glutinous
soyles; and most vivacious of plants; For happening upon an accommodate foyl,
it propagates much, emitting every year new surcles which spread themselves
over the vicine land, so it be cultivated and fat: its furcles are short, rigid
and spinous, coronated with leafes like Rue leafes disposed Garland-wise; its
heads are circinnared, its leafs hirsure and suadveolent; its flower like Pease
blooms, but lesser unicolorate and purpureous.

Its root calefies and extenuates, moving Urine, breaking, and expelling the
stone, removing obstructions, expelling flours and blood, and curing the
Jaundice.

CHAP. XVII. Of Eryngium, or Sea Holly.
ERyngium is either marine, Species.
which germinating plenteously in maritimous places, puts forth broad and
angulous leafs circumsepted with hard pricks; or campestrian and vulgar,
whereof there are many varieties, some being called the Spanish, Pannonian and
Alpine Eryngium, besides many spurious names.

The leafs of the vulgar is sected into many acuminated, spinous particles; its
caul is cubital and ramous, in whose summity certain globular heads
circumcincted with pricks, radiate like Stars; out of the middles of which
heads so horrid with spines, issue caeruleous and sometimes flave flowers: its
root is crasse and long, black extrinsecally, white intrinsecally, succulent,
sweet and odorate.

From the indefinite number of its heads many call it centum-caput, the
rusticks, hare, thistle and flying thistle; for the whole plant withering, is
evelled by the force of the winds, which rolling up and down the fields,
eminously represents a running hare; they mistake, that think this is Secacul,
for Serapio treats of these two in several Chapters, and gives them distinct
descriptions: The Arabians call Eryngium, Astaraticon, not Scacul, or Scekakul;
yet their faculties being alike, as the learned Writers do assert, vulgar
Eryngium may well be substituted for ignote secacul.

Eryngiums root is calefactive, it deduces the passages, Vires.
moves Urine and flours, expels sand out of the reins and bladder, and excites
venery.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Common grass.
SEeing grass comprehends all plants which bear leafes, Species graminis quot.
or a segetive Idea, it is no wonder if perite Herbalists enumerate forty six
differences thereof. Yet of all these the dogge-grasse is only medicative, the
rest rather affording aliments for beasts, then medicaments for man.

And as dogge-grasse is unknown to none, so is it infensive to all Agricolists,
who with their hands and rakes purge their corn of it, which being very
feracious, would otherwise surrept all aliment from their wheat or vicine
plants; for it creeps along with numerous, genicusated and vivacious radicls,
which attract to themselves all the fatness of the earth.

Its leafes are hard, as broad as them of a small reed, tenuious and
acuminated; whence women call it needle-grasse, and dogstooth.

This grass liberates the reins and other intrals from obstructions, Vires.
and kills the intestines worms; the root is more excellent then any other part
of the plant.

CHAP. XIX. Of Liqucrice.
THe whole plant is denominated from the sweetness of the root; for
Glycyrrhiza, which Pharmacopolists call Liquorice, denotes a sweet root; some
call it (...), because retained in the mouth, it quenches thirst.

Its root is long, numerous, spread along the ground, which emits a caul of
three Cubits high, with leaves like Lentisks dense, fatt, gluminous and
gummeous to the touch; with purpureous and sometimes white flowers.

In the Month of July or sooner, it bears Cods about the bigness of Vetches
or Cicers.

Theophrastus, (C. 3. L. 9.) calls it Scythica, because the Scythians useing a
little Liquorice would tolerate thirst eleaven or twelve days. Children
delight herein, for which end they demerge small pieces of Liquorice in water
in a glass bottle, which when it is flave with Liquorice-juice they drink off,
and put more water thereunto; Spanish-Juice.
which they agitate for more potions.

The Cappadocians and Spaniards bring us every year Liquorice-Juice, condensed
into Pastills.

They say it is temperate as to all qualities, but accedes nearer to calour,
Vires.
it leniates the asperities of the Artery, and Ulcers of the Bladder; it helps
the Cough, moves expectoration, and is very good against all diseases in the
Lungs and Breast.

CHAP. XX. Of Cyclamen, or Sowe-Bread.
VArious and many are the nomenclatures of this Sowe-bread; for the Barbarians
call it Arthanita; the Shopmen Hogs-Bread; some the Earth-Corke; others the
Earth-Aple; and some Cissophyllon.

It grows in shady places, under Trees, in briars and thick Woods, it
flourishes in Autumn, it bears Leafes like Ivy which are angular, crisped
about, of a greenly purpureous color, maculated with white spots on both sides.

There is another sort of Cyclamen, which has broad Leaves, but scarcely any
whit angular, but rather round, and obscurely maculated.

And a third sort also, which has lesser roots, more purpureous flowers, and
more suaveolent, which some think is that, which Pliny calls Chamaecisson.

Cyclamen is endued with many eximious qualities, for it incides potently,
opens, moves flowers, expells conception though dead, cures the Jaundice,
expells stones, it is efficacious against impostumes, emends all spots, is
averse to Poisons, either by potion or application, draws menstruous blood and
young ones; They say, if a woman with Child go over the root of Cyclamen, she
will become abortive: Vires.
but light conjectures often beguile the credulous.

The later writers mention two more, different from the former in form and
magnitude of leaves, as also in color and inversion of their flowers: and
besides, some flourish in the Spring, others in Autumn, others in the middle
time.

CHAP. XXI. Of Scilla, or Sea Onyon.
THat Scilla (...) caepacious, and delights in hot, sandy, and maritimous
places, and grows spontaneously, is unknown to few, for it is of late called
the Sea Onjon. And he that has anatomized an Onyon and a Scilla, has found no
difference in their i^ ernals nor yet in their cores; yet in leaf flowers and
seed they are much dissident.

When the leaves of Scilla are marcid, its Caul assurges to the height of a
Cubit, with white flowers issuing out of its middle like strawberry-flowers,
which from thence pullulate to its very summity; short, triangular and
compressed husks follow these, gravidated with black and full seed.

The stalk is very long and florid, because of the threefold emersion of
flowers; the first whereof, which are like them of Bulbus, expand themselves for
a long season; then the second Garland of flowers performs its course; and
then the last. And it is most remarkable, that the Caul and the Leaves never
flourish at once for not till the Caul withers will the leaves erupt; nor,
till the leaves become marcid, will the Caul assurge, contrary to the nature
of other Plants, which first emit leaves, then prolong their Caules: in Scilla
the Caul first erupts, then the Leafes.

Scilla calefies in the second degree, and is very incisive, Galen says, it is
best to take it boiled or roasted, for so its vehement quality will be
castigated; duly praepared, it helps against the frigid affections of the
brain and Nerves. Galen repurged one, cut it small, demerged it in a melitery,
insolated it forty days, and gave it to a boy infested with the Epilepsy.

CHAP. XXII. Of Bulbus, or the Sea Bulb.
BUlbus is either Coronative, medicative, or esculent; among the Coronative are
enumerated the innumerable varieties of Daffadills, Lilionarcisses, Tulips, and
Hyacinths; among the medicative, Scilla, Hermodactylls, Pancratium, and the
vomitory Bulbus; and among the esculent which are also desumed to many eximious
medicinal uses, Leeke, the Onyons of Ascalon, and such as by a certain
antinomasy are called regal Onions, as praecelling the rest, which excite
venery, and which come in frequent use among the ancients for meat; instead
whereof we use common Onions, which are the true bulbus, and pollicitate the
same effects; being also alike described with the ancients, Bulbi, so that when
Bulbus seed is praescribed, Onion or Scallyons seed may be usurped.

Bulbus is a certain root, corticous, short, round, and tunicated with many
membranes, the most external whereof is greatest; it often grows out of the
earth, producing some slender radicles like capillaments, which keeping in the
earth attract convenient succe for the nutriment of the whole Bulbus.

Its fronts are like them of Onyons, round, angust, inane and mucronated; its
caulicles of nine inches height, in whose summity, little purpureous flowers
emicate, to which succeeds seed black without, white within.

All sorts of Bulbus are acrimonious; Vires.
they excalefie, excite venery, suppeditate Aliment, cause inflation, and
stiffnesse of the yard; but two large plenty of them should not be used in
meats, because they trouble the nerves. Of all the Bulbuses I think Satyrium
most excites venery, the rest are more ignave, causing it by their flatuosity.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Satyrion, or the True Dogs-stones.
SOme plants from the effigies of their roots are called Testicls, from their
effect Satyria, because they make men Satyrs-like prone to venery; amongst
Bulbous roots, such as have but one bulb, are properly called Satyria; that
which has two, Cynosorchis; that which has three, Triorchis. Of every of
which there are many differences, some desumed from the form of their bulbes:
How to know the Best.
others from the number of their leafs; others from the color of their flowers
and their positure; yet are all alike in facultres, and friends to Venus: but
that is most approved, whose root is singular, round, about the magnitude of an
Apple, yellow without, white within, turgid with carnosity, sweet to the gust,
and grateful to the mouth. Three leafs emerge out of this root, which are
depressed toward the ground, in figure and color like Lillies leafs, but
lesser; from which three it is called Trifoile; its caul is of a foot height,
its flowers small and white, the roots of this praecels the rest for conditure;
and this I think is the true Satyrium.

Condited Satyria are analeptical, and restaurative; they are good for such as
are tabid, and such as frequently exercise venery: for the root of Satyrium is
thought so potent in exciting venery, that by retension in ones hand, it will
stimulate them to congresse; whence the Greeks design all plants by the
nomenclature of Satyrion, which excite venery.

CHAP. XXIV. Of Leeks.
LEeks are sown in gardens for culinary uses; for the plant is rather esculent
then medicinal, as Cooks well know; yet its succe is sometimes usurped in
medicinal remedies, as in coacting the powders of foetid pills; and sometimes
in extinguishing or rather educing of Empyreums: for though it be calid, yet it
has an excellent faculty, in attracting and expelling the impressed vestigium
of color.

Leck is either sative or spontaneous, and both are twofold; Species.
the first sort of the sative is called the headed Leek; the second the sective
Leek; the first, because it consists of a round root like an Onyon; the later,
because its root is longer and oftener sected; one sort of the spontaneous is
called Schoen oprasum, which bears tenuious leafs like a bulrush: the other is
called Ampeloprasum, which grows spontaneously in vineyards and other places.

Dioscorides makes mention of one, to wit, the headed Leek, whose head or
rather root that it might greatly increase and dilate it self, the ancients
covered it with a tile or slate, and so they obtained their end; many other
ways are invented, whereby Leeks may acquire a prodigious magnitude; but these
we leave to Gardners.

All Leeks calefie extremely, ezsiccate, extenuate, open, incide, Vires.
resolve and help against the bitings of Serpents and Ustions.

Its seed brayed and drunk in passum or white Wine, helps against the
difficulty of urine, and diduces its passages: some write, that Leek eaten
excites venery, and discusses ebriety; but its frequent use causes tumultuous
sleeps, hurts the sight, and begets aeruginous bile.

CHAP. XXV. Of Radish root, and Rape or wild Navew.
THere is much affinity betwixt radish root, rape root, and wild Turnep. Radish
root is so notorious, that it needs not much explication; for the vulgar are so
delighted therewith, that they sustain themselves with this root, bread, and
salt; nay all Nations make meat thereof: Rephani Species.
There are three sorts hereof, one is the greater, which is an enemy to Vines;
another lesser; the third is black radish, which some call wild radish, the
Gardeners Reforum.

Rape root, Rapiumunde dicitur Bunias.
is from its tumescent figure called Bunias, from its round figure Gonzylon, or
rather Strongylon; vulgarly Nape: its root is very crasse, carnous, tuberous,
white and not capillated; its leafes, long, sharp, green, deeply incided on
both sides, its Caul bicubitall and ramous; its flowers luteous to which Cods
succeed, praegnant with seeds like Colewort feeds but greater, which ingrede
the confection of Mithridate, whose faculty is eximious in expugning venenate
diseases.

Some suspect, that Bunias differs from Nape, and that the seed of Bunias, and
not of Nape, ingredes the composition of Mithridate, but each may be
substituted in defect of the other.

There are three differences of Napes or Rapes desumed from their Roots, the
first is orbiculated, turbinated, and short; the second crasse and long; the
third less, and vulgar, which the vulgarity call Nape.

Napes or Turnips as they acquire their magnitude, so also their bonity from
the condition of the Heavens and of the soil; those that grow in the fields
about ATownin France.
Caen, are so sweet and grateful, that they are justly preferred before the
rest.

Rapistrum is a certain wild rape root not at all bulbous; Rapistrum.
which germinates in every field, with broad, green leafs, and luteous flowers,
whose seed the women call Navet.

There is another sort thereof, with leafs like Bank-cresses, which is called
Lapsana; as also a third kind with leafes like rocket, and white flowers; all
of them bear small, black, round seeds included in Cods.

Radish roots are eaten raw, turnips not without coction; all calefie, open,
and move urine.

CHAP. XXVI. Of Anemone, or Wind-flower.
WE have above treated only of such Calefactives, whose Roots were most
celebrated, save that at the beginning of this Section we described a few,
because of their exceeding calidity; whose roots were useless. Now we come to
dissert of such whose other parts are also useful, beginning with Anemone.
Which is sometimes called the Winds-herb, because it never opens and dilates it
self, save when the wind blows; the Poets fable, that it grew from Adonis
blood, whence they call it Adonis his flower. There are two general differences
hereof, Species
one is the wild, the other the garden Anemone; both which, (especially the
later) are manifold; whose sorts and varieties are distinguished only by the
color and multiplicity of their flowers: for some bear white flowers; others
red; others caeruleous; some phoeniceous; others somewhat red; others
violaceous; and others a greenish red: all which are coronary for the
excellency and pulchritude of their flowers: but the wild Anemones varieties
are fewer, and yet more requisite in medicine; as in the confection of unguent
Marliatum: des. Myrepsus; wherein wild Anemone, especially that that is called
wind-herb is usurped: but seeing all their descriptions and variety are
excellently and elegantly depinged, by the famous Authors D. D. Dod. and Clus.
I will not further prosecute their descriptions.

All the sorts of Anemone are acrimonious, apertive, incisive, detersive, and
exsiccative.

CHAP. XXVII. Of Keiri or Wallflowers.
KEiri is a Mauritanian word, denoting a luteous Violet, which is always
green, patient of Cold, contrary to the nature of other Violets which wither at
the first aspect of Winters rigidity; and grow not again till they be new
sown: I except the Garden Violets, that repullulate every year; in following
the distinction of the Herbalists, who nothing sollicitous about the nature of
words, distinguish Leucoion from white violets; when yet Leucoion enunciates
nothing more then a white violet: Leuco signifies white; ion, a Violet.

And as there are many varieties of Violets, so are there also of Leucoia,
amongst which, that which bears a luteous flower, to wit, Keiri, is most
commendable to medicinal uses: it grows in all places, as on stone walls, old
edifices, and rubbages, and other saxous and dry places; it is sown also, and
pullulates in gardens near walls; its Causs are ramous, many, rigid and
slender; its leafs long, angust, of a bluish green, lesser and more rigid then
other violets: its flowers luteous, odorate and sweet, its codds long and
small, wherein a small plain seed is coarctated.

They make an oil of the flowers by infusion, fit to resolve humors, mitigate
cold dolours, and roborate the nerves;. ij. of its seed given in wine, or
subacted with honey educes flowers, young, and secondines. A bath made of the
decoction of its flowers will perform and effect the same.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Thyme.
THyme unknown to none, is a little surculous plant, with small angust leafs,
vested with many heads, referted with white flowers in its summities: whereof
there are two sorts; the first called Cephaloton, Species.
which is like Stoechas; the others differs from this, because it is harder,
and has few leafs and flowers, and them not on heads, but about the leaf
roots. There is another exotical Thyme, they call Peruvian Thyme, which is not
so surculous and folious, less acrimonious and more suaveolent, in other
things it responds to the rest.

Thyme calefies and siccates in the third degree, it incides, attenuates, moves
flours, protrudes the young, purges the Bowels and Lungs: it is thought very
conducible to the clarity of the eyes.

But it is more frequently used in condiments then otherwise. Vires.


CHAP. XXIX. Of Serpylle, or Mother of Thyme.
THere are two sorts of Serpyll, one garden, which is greater and more
succulent, delighting in culture and fat soil; the other wild, which grows in
petrous, squalid, dry sterile places, and in the margines of fields and on
hills; both of them are like Thyme, in effigies odor and sapour, they derive
their names from creeping; for their branches creep along by the ground, and
radicate where ever they touch it: the vulgar and wild serpyl is exile and
small like a little Vine, hard and lignous, assurging a palm in altitude, with
small leafs like Thyme; others lay along, demitting capillated fibers or
radicles into the earth.

They have round heads on their summities; out of which issue flowers of a
whitish red and purpureous color, which with the whole Plant are suaveolent.

Another kind of serpyll is found in many places which is not Serpentine as the
rest, but large and wild which the shopmen call Montanous, Penny-royall.

The Garden Serpill because of its grateful and sweet odor is enumerated
among the coronaries, its circles are longer and crasser then the other, its
leafes also broader, and duller, and its heads coronated with greater flowers.

Serpill is acrimonious and hot, moves flowers and Urine, abates the gripeings
of the belly, conduces in the Lethargy, cures the biteing of poisonous beasts,
and by its fume when it is burned repells Serpents.

CHAP. XXX. Of Sampsuchum and Marjoram.
SAmpsuchum according to Dioscorides is not Marjoram, but another ramous herb,
which is reptant, with round and hirsute leaves like calamint, whereas Marjoram
is not reptant but erect with many surcles, and with mucronated not round
leafes, yet it may well be used for want of Sampsuchum, for it is a plant both
in faculty and form very like it, whose grateful odor and savor causes it
to be nourished in gardens and pots with diligence and care, and Marjoram
perhaps desumed its name from Marum as Dodonaeous writes, who makes Marjoram,
Marum and Hysobrium one Plant, as he collected from Dioscorides his
description; and Sampsuchum and Amaracus another; as he gathered from
Dioscorides and Theophrastus; yet Amaracus by Galens authority which he also
gathered out of Dodonaeus is Feverfew so named, not by his own but by another
lapse; seeing Amaracus is indeed Sampsuchum.

We cannot admit of their reasons who make Pulick Mountain a kind of Marum;
which the vulgar French call Mastick sinck they are very dissident, for Marum
according to Dioscorides is a surculous herb, with a flower like Origanum,
leafes much whi^^r, and by him called Origanum. Pliny says it is an exoticall
Plant and not to be numerated amongst the domestic family, whereas
Clinopodium, which some call Cleonicon, other Zopyron, is an herb of vulgar
dignotion, and like Serpill.

Now Marjoram is either impatient of cold, or most patient thereof, the latter
is Winter Marjoram which flourishes in the middle of Winter; the former summer
Marjoram which perishes with the first occurse of frost.

Marjoram is manifestly calefactive cephalicall, and hystericall, which drank
or assumed at the mouth or fundament acceletates flowers.

CHAP. XXXI. Of Penny-Royall.
Pennyroyal is twofold, Species.
the one masculine and sative, which is the true Pulegium and latifolious; the
other wild and angustifolious: the true Pennyroyal does abundantly emit many
and round cauls, which are often procumbent; But oftener extol themselves on
high, two leafs somewhat rotund emerge out of each genicle; its flowers are
subcaeruleous, circumcingeing the culms about the exortion of the leafs.
Pennyroyal is suaveolent, especially when it is coronated with flowers; its
water distilled duly in a glass vessel will keep its odor: and as the true
Pulegium or Pennyroyal differs little from the second sort of Calamint, so
neither does the wild differ from Serpil: it grows best in dry saxous and
mountanous places, whence it is called mountain Pulegium, which many say is
Clynopodium; fresh Pulegium incended will kill gnats. Many odorate Herbs are
referred to Pulegium, in the designation whereof Authors agree not.

It calefies in the third degree, it exsiccates, attenuates, moves flowers and
secondines, digests pectorall phlegm, helps concoction, eases convulsions; in
wine it cures Serpents stings, cures the spleenatick by admotion, and is good
against the affections of the Podagry and Epilepsie.

CHAP. XXXII. Of Polium.
THe little tomentaceous and whitish head of Polium coacted into the Species of
an hirsute berry, represents the hoary head of an old man; whence its
denomination is desumed: it has from one root numerous, slender, hard,
lignous, round surcles of half a hands height; its leafs are long, crisped and
rigid like Germander, but more angust and better harnessed; the tops of its
branches are coronated with small flowers; circumvested with white down, many
whereof are coacted together into one head; its seed is small, black, and long.

The whole Plant is hollow, growing most abundantly in squalid montanous
places; whence Pharmacopolists call it Mountain-Polium, which Dioscorides calls
Teuthrio; it is graveolent, and yet not injucund, but useful in Medicine.

There is another sort of Polium not so potent in odor, nor firm in power:
whose surcles are also rigid and round, leafs shorter and more angust, flowers
many congested together, and hoary with white down.

Remb. Dodonaeus recenseates yet two sorts more; Pena, four: Which I leave to
their investigation, who undertake to describe the universal History of plants.

Polium calefies in the second degree, ficcates in the third; it cures the
Dropsy, Jaundice, and affections of the Spleen: it moves urine and flours, it
drives away Serpents either by substraction or fumigation; it draws wounds to
skars.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of Basil.
Basil or Ozymam, being a most odorate plant, does justly challenge this name;
lest posterity should confound it with Ocymum, which Varro says, is a kind of
Pabulum, made up of green segetives for Oxen: For the same fragrancy it is
called Basil, as though it were worthy a basilical or regal house. Many think
it is called Ocymum from the celerity of its growth; for it erupts the third
day after its sature, and often sooner; and some superstitiously or rather
ridiculously believe, that it will make a more abundant provent, if it be sown
with maledictions: but its signification challenges z instead of c. from (...)
to smell; because me whole plant smells sweetly; it is admirable, that Amber
should expel the dry furcles of Basil, and yet attract the small stalks of all
other segetives.

Holerius a Physician of Paris, tells us a story worth our notice, A Story.
of a certain Italian, who frequently smelling to basil, had a Scorpion
generated in his brains, which caused long and vehement dolours, and, at last,
his death: yet the Libyans aver, that who ever eats Basil, he shall not that
day fear to be hurt by a Scorpion.

There are four sorts of Basil, three sative, and one wild, which is called
Acinos; two of the satives are latifolious, one angustifolious, which we call
the lesser Basil.

The vulgar and latifolious, is surculous with round branches, leafs like
Mercury of a cubital altitude, with white flowers, and sometimes purpureous;
black and small seed, which D. Fern usurps to the Syrup of Arthemifia.

It is manifestly hot, dissolves flatuosity, moves urine, Vires.
helps against fadnesse invected by melancholy, exhilarates, and animates; yet
Chrysippus disallowes of its use, as inducing madness, and hurting the sanity
of the eyes.

CHAP. XXXIV. Of Origanum.
THere are four sorts of Origanum; the first is called Origanum Heracleoticum,
or Cunila; the second, Onitis; the third, Sylvestrian; the fourth, Tragorian;
which also is of two sorts, which I will not describe at large.

The true Origanum is like the great Marjoram in leafs and branches; it bears
umbels on its summities not circinated, but armed with small prickles variously
congested: it begins to grow in the middle of Summer; and as it is like
Marjoram in form, so also in odor: but it is more patient of Cold, for it
lives in the middle of Winter, it is averse to Colworts, and to all kinds of
Serpents; wherefore when Snailes are about to dimicate with Serpents, they arm
themselves with Origanum, which is very prevalent against cold poisons.

It calefies, Vires.
siccates, incides, attenuates, moves urine and flours, and is good for such as
are troubled with Coughs or difficulty of breathing, if it be taken in honey
eclegmatically.

CHAP. XXXV. Of Mint.
THough Mint be well known to every one, for being most vivacious, it
germinates in every place; yet its Species are not all exactly described, but
Mint, Menthastrum, Sisymbrium, and Calamintha, all confusedly designed, which
are thus distinguished.

Mint is either garden, domestic and true; or wild, which is called
Menthastrum; Prima menthae species.
now there are four Species of Mint: The first has quadrangular cauls,
obscurely red, somewhat pilous, with round leafs, and subrubrous flowers
growing orbicularly about the Cauls: its root is Serpentine, which puts forth
ever and anon new Turiones.

The second in root, leaf, Odor and magnitude aemulates the first, but its
color is more obscurely red, and the flowers in the summities of its branches
are spicated.

The third has longer leafs, and flowers in its ear.

The fourth has long and sharp leafs, with subpurpureous flowers, geniculately
circumvesting the internodia of the cauls like the first.

Besides these which the perite Herbalists enumerate, Matthiolus adjoyns
another, which the Goritians call Greek-Mint; Val. Cordus, Sarracenica; some,
St. Mary's herb; some, Roman Sage; some, Lassulata; and most, herb du coque
after the French.

It grows in most Gardens, its leafs are like the greater Sage, or Betony; of
a greenly white color and crisped, its Cauls are cubital or longer; whose
summities emit coryambaceous flowers, of a yellowish color like Tansey
flowers, its sapour is amare; it and all mints are graveolent, yet not
ungrateful.

There be also two sorts of Menthastrum or wild-Mint; the first grows about
any old wall or ditch, with more large and rufous leafs, easily incided, whose
flower is spicated: the other Meadow-Mint, which grows in water brinks, whose
leafs are hispid, hoary, and subrotund, and flowers spicated as the former,
both are graveolent, yet grateful.

Mint is useful to cibaries, Vires.
which being young is a very grateful fallet herb, but more adult it is more
ungrateful and hard: it is of a hot nature, and very stomachical; for its
quality is to augment the heat of the ventricle, it confirms roboration, helps
coction, discusses flatuosity, and cures gripings.

Sisymbrium has such cognation with the family of Mints, that by culture or
neglect it may be transmuted into Mint, or Mint into Sisymbrium; the Shopmen
call it Balsamint; the vulgarity, Rugged Mint: it differs much from Sion, or
Perula, as also from Cardamen, or Crescion, which they call water-mint: for the
true Sisymbrium, which many call wild Serpil, is very like Garden mint, but
more odorate and latifolious, which has excellent medicinal faculties, (
Diosc. C. 155. L. 2.)

CHAP. XXXVI. Of Calaminth.
THere are three sorts of Culaminth; Species
the first is familiar with mountains; the second challenges affinity with
Pennyroyal; the third with Menthastrum.

The first delights in squalid tuberous and montanous places, and is called
Mountain- Calaminth, which for its elegant effigies and grateful odor, is now
cicurated in Gardens; as also all kind of Mints, to which it responds after a
manner both in faculties and nomenclature; for Calaminth portends fair Minth,
and this complex name denotes its nobility.

The second sort of Calaminth has leafs like Pennyroyal, but sometimes
greater, whether variegated with spots, with whitely purpureous flowers
amicting its cubital branches, it delights in aprike places, and is found in
many fields when the segetives are demessed; it is also called Nepeta in
Dioscorides, who yet neither approves nor disapproves of the name.

The third is like Menthastrum, with leafs somewhat longer Caul and Branches
greater then the former, and yet not so efficacious. Dodonaeus exhibited the
herb Cattaria instead of this. Fuchsius exhibits another much dissident; and
Dioscorides describes not a Line of Cattaria; yet it may justly be referred to
the family of Calaminths, as having cognation therewith; though the herb and
faculty has been unknown by the Ancients. It puts forth many quadrate hard
caulicles, at every knot two hoary leafs like horenound, spicated flowers like
Mint or Menthastrum; it is called Cattaria, because Catts delight in eating and
playing with its leafs; Apothecaries call it Nepeta.

It calefies and attenuates exceedingly; Vires.
it has a peculiar faculty in auxiliating the conception, and foecundating the
womb.

Yet all Calaminth is of a tenuious substance, Vires.
hot and dry in the third degree, it abates gripings, kills worms, cures the
Jaundice, educes flowers, takes out blew skars, cures difficulty of breathing,
and strenuously digests humors; the montanous Calaminth is most efficacious.

CHAP. XXXVII. Of Wormwood.
THough Absynth be an herb of vulgar dignotion, yet scarce two agree in
recenseating and describing its Species: however letting pass the varieties of
opinions, we assert, that there are three sorts of Wormwood; Species.
the common Wormwood, the Santonian Wormwood, and the Scriphian Wormwood: They
err, who say, that the common Wormwood differs from the Roman and Pontian, and
that the Santonian is the Roman Wormwood; for the common is the Roman Wormwood,
so called, because it was holy to the vulgarity, and because it grew
plenteously in the Roman fields, and in every old hedge. The Pontian is so
denominated from Pontus, and from its stypticity or astriction.

That which is called San^onian, or rather Xantonian Wormwood, is so
denominated from a tract where it grows, bearing the same name: hence some
call its seed Sanctum, when they should call it Sanctonian seed; the whole
plant is like common Wormwood, but lesser, and not so white; its seeds are not
se many, and its flowers are small.

The third sort which is called Scriphian or Marine Wormwood, grows copiously
on the Mountain Taurus near Cappadocia, the herb is slender, like small
Suthernwood, referted with small seeds, subamare and graveolent with some
calefaction; the whole is so like foeminine Southernwood, that they can scarce
be discerned each from other.

Galen says, Vires.
that all Wormwood participates of an aromatical acrimonious and amare quality,
but some Gardens afford us vulgar Wormwood no whit amare but sweet,
distinguished from the Pontian only in sapour; All roborate the stomach, help
coction, and kill Worms, whether they be assumed or adhibited. See Dioscorides
about the differences and qualities of Wormwoods; as also Gasparus Bauhinus,
who published a whole Book of Wormwood.

CHAP. XXXVIII. Of Mugwort.
THe Species of Mugwort are more then two, contrary to the opinion of many; for
besides the common differences of la^^^lious and tenuifolious, there is one
marine Mugwort, which from one lignous root, fruticates in many sarments, with
low and serpentine leafs; and if we believe Ruellius and Fuchsius, Feverfew
and Tansey are Species of Mugwort.

All Mugworts are Sylvestrian, the first whereof is latifolious, lacinious, and
marginally dissected; with straight, round, stria^d bicubital cauls, and small
flowers like Wormwood: it grows by way-sides, and oftentimes in the middle of
Gardens.

The second is more tenuious, with a small white and graveolent flower.

The third is also tenuifolious, which grows about hedges and water-tracts,
whose flowers and leafs contrited refer the odor of Marjoram; the vulgar is
used to the confection of the Artemisian Syrope.

It was called Artemisia by King Mausolus his Wife, whereas before it was
called Parthenis. Many superstitious people call it St. John's herb, wherewith
he circumcinged his Loins on holidays.

It calefies in the second degree, opens, attenuates, Vires.
expells flowers, secondines and young, and auxlliates many affections of the
Uterus.

CHAP. XXXIX. Of Melissa, or Balm.
WIth the same complacency that a Cat is carried to Cattaria, is a Be carried
to Apiastrum or Melissophyllon, which is a melleous leaf. There are many
differences hereof; for besides that Sylvestrian which is improperly called
Melissa by Fuchfius, which smells like Cymice; the vulgar is most celebrous;
then the Spanish, and then the more peregrine as the Moluccian, which comes
from the Islands of Molucra.

Our Melissa is well known, it assurges with quadrangular surcles, broad,
rugous and subasperous leafs, smelling like Quince-Apple; with two prominents
betwixt each knot, which emit small cups, with candicant flowers, after which a
small blackish seed succeeds.

The Spanish Melissa is in effigies, odor, and faculties, very like the
former, but its leafs are lesser, not so rigid and green.

The Moluccian Melissa is twofold, the one smooth, the other spinous, both
emitting culms and leafs like ours.

It calefies in the second degree, Vires.
siccates in the first; in insessions it educes flowers, and in drink or
illition it confers against the bitings of Scorpions, spiders, and dogs; it
roborates the head, increases the memory, and recreates the animal faculties.

CHAP. XL. Of Horehound.
Species.
THere are two kinds of Horehound, the one white, the other black, which is
called Ballore; both are ramous without roots, of half a foots altitude,
growing about walls and fields margins: the white which is of more use has
quadrangular cauls hirsute with small hoarinesse; two subrotund, rugous,
incided, and lanuginous leafs: its flowers which are small emerge out of small
cups, which verticillately circumdate the genicls of the surcles: all Horehound
delights in ruderous places, and about ruined aedifices; some prefer black
Horehound before the white; but I choose the white with the more perite and
Learned.

It is hot in the second degree, Vires.
dry in the third; it removes obstructions, purges the Lungs, educes flowers,
conduces to broken and convelled nerves, and is given against the stings of
Serpents and poisonous potions.

CHAP. XLI. Of Betony.
Betony is altogether wild, delighting in opaque and watery places, yet for its
excellent endowments it is cultivated in Gardens, it emits long, broad, green,
subasperous leafs, incided about like a Saw; its caulicles are slender,
quadrangular, somewhat hirsute, and cubital; its flowers are spicated, red and
white in some places: the Greeks call it (...) and (...), the Latins,
Betonica, which name may be detorted to another plant, which some call Vetonica
altilis; some, flos Armerius; and the Germans, flos superbus.

Besides the vulgar Betony, there is another latifolious one, found in many
places, which delights more in culture, and flourishes most in Gardens.

Betony is hot and dry in the second degree, Vires.
it is endued with a cephalical and alexiterial faculty, wherefore it is good
against the Epilepsie and poisonous diseases; especially against the bitings of
mad dogs and Serpents; and if any praeassume this, lethall poison drunk shall
not hurt him.

CHAP. XLII. Of Veronica, or Speedwell.
VEronica is twofold, one masculine, the other foeminine, which many call
Elatine; the former, Paulus Aegineta calls Betony; it creeps along the earth,
with many hirsute and pedall surcles with long leafs, lesser then Betony;
somewhat like Spanish Spurge.
Teucrion, but lanuginous, with flowers orderly digested, of a purpureous
color, with a small rotund black seed contained in cups like boxes, and with a
slender root variously divaricated.

The foeminine Veronica, which many call Elatine; some, Reprilis Veronica, has
many, pedal, slender, flexile, lanuginous, and solious surcles; with hoary,
pilous leafs, like Moneywort.
Nummulary: with small white flowers like Snapdraggon.
Anthirrhinon, with small, round black seed like Anagalidis.
Pimpernel, much of it grows among segetives in fallow ground and sandy places.

Some make mention of a kind of Veronica, with an erect Caul, which puts forth
more rigid furcles, which are renuious, ramous and folious like the former.

Dodonaeus adds another Veronica, growing in Meadows and moist places, in
effigies and magnitude very like the foeminine; but its leafs are lesser, not
lanuginous, but smooth and green: its brauches are reptile, flowers caeruleous,
its seed contained in little boxes small and black; this and the former are
seldom or ^ever used in medicine.

Sense indicates, that Veronica is hot and dry; Vires.
and experience demonstrates it to be astrictive, and a good vulnerary: it
cures the Scab, Wounds, Ulcers, and all vices in the skin; it has a peculiar
faculty in curing, or at least asswaging, cancerous Ulcers. Fuchsius writes
falsely, that the King of France, correpted with the Leprosy, was cured with
the adjument of this herb: for no King of France was ever correpted with such a
foede disease, nor yer with Pestilence.

CHAP. XLIII. Of Ditanny.
DItiany's caulicles are cubital or shorter, which divide themselves into
certain wings, on whose summities depend flowers proceeding from the same
interstices, in the form of scales: its leafs are rotund, but acuminated on the
one side, very lanuginous, and like pennyroyal, but higher: that is best that
grows in Crete; and that most laudable that grows on Picte, a Mountain in
that Region, whence it is denominated; some of the Greeks call it Beloacon,
that is, Weapon-salve; and Belotocon, because it excludes infixed ^^rts: for
Hearts confixed with Arrows run to Dictanny, by the contact whereof they
exclude the Arrows. Hence some call it Dorcidium or Cervary, because Hearts
first invented its use. Goats also feeding near it, and vulnerated demonstrated
its efficacy; its leafs are tomentous, and its flowers of a violaceous black
color.

Another kind of Dictanny is found in some maritimous places, as in the
Barofluctuan shores in Normandy, very like this in leass, which is called
Pseudo-Dicamny; but its flowers do verticulately circumcinge its surcles, and
its faculties are not so efficacious as the legitimate.

Dictamny which some call Diphthomny is hot and dry in the third degree, it
will by the Ancients testimony extract weapons, extinguish intros^^ued poison;
it helps in pestilence, exclu^^^^ flowers, young, and seconds; abates the
spleen, and ^ures Strangury.

CHAP. XLIV. Of Stoechas, Cassidony, or French Lavender.
SToechas is unjustly firnamed Arabian, seeing it equally germinates in other
parts and regions, as in Crete, Belgium and No^mandy, where it lives well among
Snowes, and in the Islands Stoechades, from which, or from their spicated
summities they are denothinated.

Dodonaeus knew three sorts thereof; the first, the common and true Stoechas;
the second, the Belgian, like the former in effigies; the third with sawed
leafs: besides which there is another with golden colored leafs, like
Eliochrysum, and is called Chrysocome or Orenge-coloured Stoechas; this has
short and slender caulicles, angust, hoary and hispid leafs, and luteous
splendent flowers like small bubles: it grows in rough and Sandy places; Pena
mal^^ three sorts hereof. See him.

The true Stoechac emits many cubitall, slender, and lignous cauls, with hair
on its summities angular like ears of Corn, long leafs, broad like Lavander
spike and heary; small, caeruleous odorate flowers in a Foliaceous spike which
are sua veolent.

Stoechas is manifestly hot a mare, moderately astrictive and very cephalical;
for it recreat^^ head, and all animal faculti^^ discusses frigid humors,
exhilarates the mind, and conduce^^^ all affections of the head flowing from a
cold distempet: it (...) borates all the intrals, and the whole body.

CHAP. XLV. Of Sage.
SAge is either domestic or Sylvestrian; domestic is twofold, the greater and
the lesser: both called Elelisphacos, though some denote the greater only with
this name, calling the lesser Sphacelos, which some call wild Sage, others
boske Sage.

There is another kind of Sage in Crete that bears betries, which in figure,
odor, and sapour is very like ours.

Sage is a ramous plant, ( Diosc. C. 41. L. 3.) having quadrangular and hoary
branches, with leafs like Quince leafs, but more angust, sharp, crasse and
whiter: its flowers which depend on the tops of its branches are fulcated like
them of Horminum, and caeruleous.

Salvia is Cephalical, nerval, calefactive, siccative, apertive, Vires.
moving flours and urine; the lesser must be selected as better to the
confection of Stoechas, but the greater may well supply its defect.

CHAP. XLVI. Of Horminum, or Clary.
CLary is either sative, Species.
which delights in cultivated and fat soil; or wild, which grows in meadows
and macilent places: both are well known, they emit from one root, many
cubital, angular, and subhirsute Cauls, but especially the sative: their leafs
are broad, mucronated and sharp like Horehound: their flowers besides their
leafs do verticulately circumcinge their surcles; their flowers are of a
purpureous caerulcous color; sometimes whitish, sometimes altogether white,
erupting out of boxes, which dehisceing for maturity look downwards: a small,
long, and black seed is included in these; the seed of the wild ones is round
and brown.

Horminum and Orvalla have so much affinity with each other, that very grave
men, and perite Herbalists constitute no difference betwixt them; but they are
without distinction; as Matthiolus has noted. Horminum comes from the verb
(...), because it draws its usurpers to venery. Some call it Sage of Rome; but
Orvall is commonly called, All good: sometimes, Gallitriche; by some, Cockles
center: by others, Sclarea; and by some, Scarlea; whose four varieties Dodon,
delivers, which here particularly to recenseate, would be beyond mine
institution.

Clary is manifestly hot, its seed drunk in Wine excites venery, Vires.
takes away the white spot in ones eyes; it being demerged in some convenient
liquor, cructates a certain mucage, which wonderfully helps the affections of
the eyes: the Sylvestrian is more efficacious.

CHAP. XLVII. Of Scordium.
SCordium is so called from the odor of Allium, which it refers, it is a
surculous plant procumbent on the ground, with two leafs issuing out of each
genicle, which Leafs are long like Germander, but greater, incided in their
circuits; soft, hirsute, and white, red flowers erupt out of the wings of the
surcles, very like the flowers of dead nettle or archangel, but lesser: that
which grows in Crete is not only laudable, but also that which grows in
other Regions.

It is almost miraculous, that grave men, (especially Galen, C. 24. L. de
Antiq.) write of Scordium, to wit, that those bodies of dead men lying upon the
ground without Sepulture, which fell upon Scrodium, putrified much slower then
others; and those parts of the carcasses that touched the herb were totally
vindicated from putretude: wherefore Galen was persuaded that Scordium is
averse to the poison of all reptiles, and all noxious medicaments which cause
putrefaction: it grows copiously in many Fennes, beside ditches and other
concave and humid places; it is found also in many uliginous and fatter
Mountains.

It calefies and siccates, Vires.
preserves from putretude, and resists poisons; it cures the pestilence, and
many contagious diseases.

It is most usefully profitable in a potion against lethall poisons and
bitings, it purges the intralls, and moves flowers and urine.

CHAP. XLVIII. Of Rue.
RUe is enumerated amongst the graveolent herbs, whether it be domestical,
whereof there is but one sort well known to all; or Sylvestrian, whereof there
are more varieties. Rue is a suffrutitious, bicubital, ramous, surculous,
folious, and continually green plant, which bears luteous flowers, upon whose
occase, a quadrangular head emerges, divided with so many closets and
continents, as it has angles: wherein is contained that seed which ingredes
the composition of the syrrup of Stoechas.

Rue in Greek is Peganon, because its extraordinary dry spirit and calour
exsiccate the genital sperme: yet it is endued with many other eximious
faculties, which greatly commend its use: Mithridates also set a good estimate
upon it, who used it in that pcculiar Autidote wherewith he defended himself
from many poisons.

Which he constituted of two hundred Rue Leafs, two figs, Antidotus Mithrid,
quibus Constiterit.
two dry Wallnuts, all contrited with a grain of salt.

The Sylvestrian Rue affords two differences especially, the one whereof, in
leafs, odor, and effigies is very like the Garden Rue, and is called Mountain
Rue, because it fruitcates on mountains; the other being most rare and
variously denominated, has exercised many wits in its designation: Dioscorides
( C. 53. L. 3.) seems to call it Moly, yet in the next Chapter describing Moly,
he makes its leafs graminous, and roots bulbous, which can in no wise accord
with Rue. The Cappadocians have also designed it with this name; the Syrians
call it Besasan; the Arabians, Harmel and Harmala; which name many Shopmen give
to common Rue: which may rightly be substituted in defect of the true Harmala,
which is the second sort of Sylvestrian Rue.

This Harmala emits many caulicles of Nine Inches height, without any root;
its leafs are angust, small, and long: its flowers white and quinquefolious,
its seed is contained in heads like them of the domestic Rue, but they are
only triangular; it is graveolent; it grows in Cappadocia, and in many
incultivated places in Spain.

It is hot and dry in the third degree, it attenuates, incides, Vires.
digests crasse humors, and extinguishes Sperm.

We shall not now treat of Goat-rue, improperly so called, though we may speak
of it in a more proper place.

CHAP. XLIX. Of Litho Sperm, or Gromell.
THis herb is called Lithosperm, from the durity of its seed; its leafs are
like Olive-leafs, but longer, hispid, sharper, and of a sad green; its surcles
are straight, slender, ligneous, sharp and hirsute: its flowers white, issuing
out of the wings of its leafs, and depending upon short pedicls.

A small, rotund, hard and splendent seed, which glisters in the Sun, follows
upon the occase of its flowers: whence it is probable, the Shopmen call it
Sun-millet.

There are two sorts thereof, Vires.
which in form and faculties aae alike, in magnitude only dissident; besides
which two others are found, which are either useless, or not experienced.

Lithosperm is hot and dry in the second degree, it moves urine, breaks and
expels stones, liberates from obstructions, opens the passages, and helps
against Strangury.

CHAP. L. Of Saxifrage.
MAny and different plants, from their faculty in breaking the stone, are
called Saxifrages; thus Betony by Galen, and another ferulaceous herb like
Epithyme by Dioscorides. Pimpinell also, and other Lithontriptical plants are
thus nuncupated: as also other plants which desume this name not from
comminution or contrition of stones in the reins or bladder, but from their
exortion in rocks; as Empetrum or Cristina marin^, which as it were dividing
the rocks, issues out of their rimes and fruticates there long and vivaciously.

The vulgar Saxifrage, especially the greater, is very like Pimpinel, its leafs
are variously descided, and serrated in their circuit: its caul is cubital,
angulous and striated: its umbels whitish, its seed like Garden smalledge,
acrimonious and fervent to the gust.

The lesser differs from the former in little save magnitude. Many say, that
Pimpinel differs from Saxifrage only in hirsutenesse; for Pimpinel is pilous,
the other smooth and glabre.

Other two plants, are referred to the family of Saxifrages; the one whereof is
called white Saxifrage, because it bears a white flower; the other aureous,
because it bears a golden flower; the seed of the greater Saxifrage should be
selected to the confection of Benedicta Laxativa.

It is evidently hot and dry, Vires.
it attenuates, incides, digests, expurges, takes away obstructions, moves
flowers, educes glutinous humors out of the breast, moves urine, and breaks
and expells stones.

CHAP. LI. Of Aristolochy, or Birthwort.
ARistolochy is so called, because it helps childbearing, and edures their
Lochia. Many call it the Earths apple, because its fruit is like an apple; but
this nomenclature is peculiar to the round ones, for the fruits of some are
turbinated.

There are five sorts of Aristolochies, the long, round sarmentitious,
saracenical, and Pistolochia or Polyrhizon; all which are so like in cauls,
leafs and flowers, that none but such as are very perspicacious can difference
and distinguish them.

They grow in many places in France about the margines of vineyards of fields,
in fat and restible soil: the long grows copiously on the Banks of Sequana.

Dioscorides acknowledges only three sorts of Aristolochy, the round, the long
and the sarmentarious, the long he calls the masculine; the round the
foeminine; which some call Dactylis, he attributes eximious faculties to both;
not only against venerate animals, but also for their potency in extracting
the splinters and fractures of bones and darts.

The round which nigreds the Confection of Hiera Pacchii, Vires.
calefies and dryes potently, it is good against poisons, difficulty of
breathing, sighings, and Spleen; it attracts such things as are left after
childbearing; whence it is called Aristolochia; for removing the remora's it
validly educes the Seconds, and moves Flowrs.

CHAP. LII. Of Asarum, or Asarabacca.
ASarum is by some called Vulgago; by others, Perpensa and Baccharis: but the
Shopmen call it after the Greeks and Latins Afarum; its leafs are in color
and magnitude hederaceous, yet not acuminated, but somewhat rotund,
constituting an imperfect circle; or as the Alchymists say, referring the
signature of an ear, of which herb, when the Empirick Rivierius boasted, he was
demanded by a learned Physician of Paris; whether or no the Leafs of Asarum
were the best and most determinate cure for the diseases of the Auricles; whose
ridiculous response demonstrated, that he neither knew the herb, nor the proper
affections of the place; its flowers are small, lying under its leafs, like the
flowers of Orange colored Henbane, but lesser, wherein a small, angulous and
sharp seed is contained; its roots are many, slender and gracile, obliquely
diffused, and alternately implicated.

Its roots are hot and dry, as also its Leafs; Vires.
but these more imbecilly: they move urine and flowers, excite vomit, and
expurge pituitous and crasse humors; they are very good against the
obstructions and tumors of the Liver and Spleen; whence macerated in wine, it
is good against the Jaundice and Dropsy.

CHAP. LIII. Of Pimpinell, or Burnet.
PImpinel or Pampinell, Species.
which some enumerate amongst the Saxifrages, is twofold; the one Hortensian,
which delights in sature and culture; the other Sylvestrian, which grows in
Meadows and other incultivated places; both agree with Sax^frage, not only in
form, but faculties also; some call this plant Peponell; others, Bipennula;
others, Sanguisorbe and Sanguinary; some give it the most composited name of
Dionysio-nymphas; because conjected into Wine, it conciliates a certain
grateful suavity in drinking.

The Hortensian is most used; both or them have long leafs, many congested
together upon one pedicle, each whereof is subtotund, serrated, and somewhat
hirsute; their cauls are cubitall, quadrangular, somewhat striated and ramous;
our of whose summities erupt round capi^ls, compacted of little cleraceous
leafs and flowers, which seem to dye sometimes before the rising of the
flowers, and after theoccase of the fruits; wherein many angulous and dusky
seeds are included.

Its root is long, hard, and useless.

It calefies and siccates in the beginning of the second recesse, Vires.
it is very grateful to the principal parts, as the Heart, Liver, and such
Intrals; it purifies the blood, purges the reins, ejects stones and sand, helps
against the bitings of mad-dogs, and conduces in malign and pestilent Fevers.

CHAP. LIVE. Of Germander.
CHamadrys grows in petrous and rough places, it is a fulfruticious plant of
nine inches height, whose leafs are like oak Leafs; whence it is called
Chamaedrys, or small oak.

It is called Trissago, and sometimes Toucrium, but it has small affinity with
Teucrium. Dioscorides substitutes no Species to this plant; though the later
Writers have found many which have much cognation therewith: for Fuchslus says
there are two masculine plants and as many foeminine of this name. Dodonaem
says, there are two reptile ones, and as many assurgent; the last whereof he
only calls the wild Chamaedrys, when indeed they are all wild.

It calefies and siccates in the second degree, liberates the intralls from
obstructions, educes flowers, and much profits its assumers, as you may see in
Dioscoriaes, C. 12. L. 3.

CHAP. LV. Of Ground Pine.
DIoscorides makes three varieties of true Ground Pines; D^donaeus adds three
more of spurious ones; the first is called Ajuga or Abuga, from its odor.

It has leafs like semper Vivum, but much smaller, fatter, hirsute and densely
set about the boughs; with a tenuious flower of a whitish luteous color; it
is also called Arthriticall Ivy, because it conduces to the cure of the Gout:
the second has cubitall, slender, crooked boughs, with candid flowers, and
small black seed: the third is called masculine Ground Pine, which is small,
with exile, whitish and hispid leafs, sharp caulicle, ^^teous flowers and seed:
all smell like the Pine, none of Musk, as some have thought.

Ground Pine is hot in the second, and dry in the third degree; Vires.
it is apertive, helps against the Kings Evil and Strangury, moves flowers,
helps against the bitings of Scorpions, roborates the nerves, and conduces to
the cure of the Sciatica and other Gowts.

CHAP. LVI. Of Feaverfew.
WE said before that Feaverfew was not Mugwort, now we confess, that it is a
kind of Motherwort, but not stinking Camomil, as I heard a skilful man once
affirm. Feverfew, as Discorides asserts, has leafs like Coriander, but
smaller, variously incided, and jagged: the ambient of its flower is white, the
middle luteous, like Camomile, its odor is venenate, its sapour amare, its
root is scinded with many slender and hard fibers, and the whole plant is of a
dilute color, and known to all.

It is called the shops motherwort, because it cures such women as are
obnoxious to the suffocation of the matrix, and other affections from that
cause.

There are two sorts thereof, the one with a simple flower, Species.
which is the vulgar; the other with a full and manifold flower, which for its
elegancy is sown and cultivated in gardens; and unless it obtain fat soil,
degenerates into the simple one: there is another brought from the Alps, where
it grows abundantly and spontaneously, which is called the Alpian Feverfew,
which responds to the former in odor and form, but is less, always bearing
simple flowers congested on umbells.

It is hot in the third degree, dry in the second; it opens, Vires.
incides, expurges, and potently educes flowers, seconds and young ones, though
dead.

CHAP. LVII. Of Hypericum, or St. John's wort.
HYpericum commonly called Millefore, is a surculous Plant of a cubits
altitude, with myrtle Leafs, but that they are thinner, softer, more flave, and
perforated with innumerable pores: its flowers are luteous, consisting of five
leafs shining with a golden nitour, after which small long Cods erupt,
gravidated with small seeds, which rubbed smell of Rosin.

Its root is hard, sulcated with many fibers and capillaments; its flowers and
leafs bruifed, emit a certain sanguine humor; its flowers macerated in oil,
give it a sanguineous tincture.

It moves urine and flowers, cures wounds and Sciatica, conduces against the
affections of the nerves; calefies, siccates, toborates the nerves, and is a
good ingredient to vulneraries.

Many say that Ascyrum Androsaemum and Hypericum are one, but they are
different plants, and of diverse forms.

CHAP. LVIII. Of Androsaemum, or Peters-wort.
ANdrosaeme is so called, because its succe resembles man's blood; it is a
fructiferous and ramous plant, its surcles are many, slender and red, its leafs
broad, and mucronated like Ivy, but more tenuious and florid; which bruised,
emit red succe like red wine; it has many wings expanded on both fides of its
summity: about which there are small luteous flowers; its seed is contained in
small cups like Poppy seed, its hair contrited emits a resinous odor.

It grows spontaneously in many Woods of Northmany, and other incultivated
places, whose leafs women collect and successefully adhibite to pustuls, and
almost all cutaneous affections: for they have experienced, that if it benefit
not, it will not hurt any part whereunto it is admoved.

It calefies, Vires.
siccates, agglutinates, stays blood, cures burnings, helps against the
Sciatica, cohibits wounds, adimpleats Ulcers with flesh, and cures them; two
dragms of its seed brayed and taken, deduces the chollerick excrements of the
belly by stools.

CHAP. LIX. Of Gith, or Nigella.
THere is no small difference betwixt Melanteria, and Melanthium; for
Melanteria is a mineral like Mysius; but Melanthium or Gith is a Plant which
they call Nigella, which assurges like a shrub, with slender boughs, leafs
minutely incided like Coriander leafs, and candid flowers on the tops of its
branches, many hairy tufts and stalks being interposed like green hair,
whereunto quadrangular heads succeed, armed with prominent and reflected
cornicles, distinguished with membranous covers, and gravidated with black
angulous, acrimonious, and odorate seed.

There is another sort of sative Gith, which from the color of its seed is
called Orenge-coloured Gith; it is in all things like the former, but in its
seed.

There are as many sorts of wild Gith, which grow amongst segetives, very like
the satives; and another which is called Pseudo-Melanthium, and is enumerated
amongst the caereals.

The first sort of Gith the Shopmen call Nigella Romana, though it be scarce at
Rome, but plentiful in Germany.

It calefies and siccates potently, kills Worms, moves flowers, helps the
orthopnoical, dissipates flatuosity, and benefits such as are affected with
diseases in their Uterus.

CHAP. LX. Of Hyssope.
HYssop well known to all, is a fruticous plant, of a foots length, with leafs
like Thyme, but longer, and broader; caeruleous flowers, whose branches are
vested like Spike, with a long and lignous root.

And it is of two sorts; one montanous, which fruticates spontaneously in dry
places; the other sative, which is for culinary uses nourished in Gardens; for
it is grateful, and affects broth with a delectable sapour and sweet odor.

Both sorts are hot and dry in the third degree; but the domestic, especially
that which bears white flowers, is less hot and dry. Their faculties according
to Dioscorides, Galen, and Mesue, are perstrictive, yet all confess that they
much help in diuturnal Coughs and distillations, and benefit the suspirious and
orthopnoical.

CHAP. LXI. Of Cranes-Bill.
DIoscorides makes but two sorts of Cranes-bill; Species
Matthiolus three, borrowing the third from Pliny: Fuchsius, six; Dodonaeus,
eight, besides other two described by Fuchsius, which he does but just mention.

The first emits very lanuginous surcles red from the root; leafs like Anemone,
cut with many and long incisures, red flowers, after whose occase little heads
emerge out of the summities of its branches, of the longitude of a needle, well
representing the bill of a Stork, or Crane; whence later Writers one while call
it Cranes bill, another while Storks bill, and another while Shephards Needle.

The second has small and pilous surcles, of half a foots longitude, with
leafs like Mallows, but whiter; purpureous flowers on its summities, and with
heads like Cranes bills: they mistake, that call it Anemone.

The third has pedal, geniculated, hoary, hispid and graveolent surcles, with
leafs like Chervil, red flowers and capitls rostrated like Storks.

The whole plant is red, whence it was of old called Rubel, now Rubertian,
sometimes Robertian, or herb- Robert.

The fourth has lacinated red leafs, purpureous flowers, and heads rostrated
as the former.

The fifth is called Ranunculus, because it bears leafs like frogs; its flowers
are patulous and subcaeruleous; its heads like the former: it is twofold; the
one greater, whose flowers are caeruleous; the other lesser, whose flowers are
red.

The sixth expands slender lanuginous branches, small and laciniated leafs,
purpureous flowers, to which the Stork bills succeed.

There is also a tuberous Storks bill; so called from its crasse, nodose and
tuberous root; it luxuriates with many round surcles: leafs like Anemone, much
lacinia red, red, patulous, fair flowers on the tops of its caulicles, like
little Roses.

Besides these, others are by some enumerated as the montanous Storks bill, the
Ladies Comb, the Doves foot, and another, which for its suaveolence is called
sweet Storks bill, which grows copiously in many places in Normandy,
especially in maritimous tracts; some call it the herb Camphorata, but they
err; for Camphorata is of the family of Ground-pines: but I find Southernwood
called Camphorata, by many, for it smells like Camphire.

For defect of Camphorata, suaveolent Storks bill may be substituted in the
confection of the unguent Martiatum; if both be wanting, the first sort of
Storks bill may be desumed.

All of them are endued with the same faculty, Vires.
the Moscative is calefactive, nerval, and discussive: the Rupertian,
detersive, and accommodate to Ulcers.

CHAP. LXII. Of Doronicum, or Leopards Bane.
THat which Mesue calls Doronici, Actuarius Carnabadium; and it is likely that
which Paulus calls Memirem, and Matthiolus falsely Aconitum Padalianche, we call
vulgar Roman Doronicum, whereof that Matthiolus might give his opinion, he
experienced his upon a dog, which by that means dyed. I, besides the authority
of grave men, can oppose him by experience; for I gave a great quantity thereof
to a dog, which he eat up without harm: yea, it is daily usurped successeful
in decoctions and cordial Electuaries: besides, the famous Doctor, Conradus
Gesnerus asserts, that he has often assumed Doronicums root condited, and
drunk two dragms of its powder in water; yea, that he had frequently and
successefully prescribed it either solitary or mixed with other medicaments to
his patients.

And though we grant to Matthiolus, that Doronicum kills dogs, it does not
thence follow, that it is lethall to men; for both are not of the same nature,
nor yet live of the same aliment: thus Aloes kills Foxes, not men: Nux vomica
kills Cats and many Birds, which is to us a solutiferous medicament.

Doronicum then must not be disapproved of as poison, since many commend it, if
not for an aromatical, yet for an alexiterial simple. And therefore Mesueus
uses it in the Electuary de Gemmis, because there is some theriacality in it, (
Avicen. Tract. 2. de med. cord.)

Doronicum is a small plant, with slender cauls; soft and long leafs like
Plantain, somewhat flave and hirsute like Mouse-ears, whose ambitient is
rotund, somewhat laciniated, and a little acuminated: its roots are small,
rotund, and orbicular, growing more angust toward their extremes like the body
and tail of a Snake; their color is white, sapour, dulcoamare, and somewhat
astrictive: its flowers are luteous and radiate like Ox eye.

Some make but three varieties of Doronicum, which seem solely to discrepate in
magnitude. Clusius enumerates seven; amongst which, Damasonion, which most call
Alisma, is comprehended: and Classical Authors affirm, that the root of
Damasonion may well be substituted for the root of common Doronicum, in the
confection of the Electuary de gemmis, and other cordial compounds; for it is
commended against poisons, whether ingested or inflicted by Dioscorides, ( C.
69. L. 3.) whereby it seems more convenient for these concoctions then
Doronicum, of whose faculties some doubt; others speak little.

Now Damasonium is very Doronicum in effigies, bearing leafs like Plantain, but
more angust, lacinious, and conveyed downwards, with a slender, simple caul of
more then a cubits height, a pale flower, slender, acrimonious, and odorate
roots, which are good against poisons.

Doronicum is hot and dry almost in the third degree, Vires.
it discusses flatuosity, is good against palpitation, and conduces to such as
are venenately and pestilentiously diseased, or bitten by Serpents.

CHAP. LXIII. Of Cardus Benedictus.
ATractylis, which is a kind of bastard Saffron, is twofold, the one whereof
has a straight Caul, and is thence called recticaul; the other emits
procumbent surcles, and is thence called Straticaul, and by a more usual name
Carduus Benedictus; it is a plant well known to all, its Cauls are round,
obsequious, brachiated and decumbent; its leafs laciniated on both sides and
spinose; the summities of its surcles emit little heads stipated with spinose
and pungent leafs, whence it is called Acanacia; which heads are lanuginous and
turgid, with long dusky and bearded seed; the flower is pallid, its root which
is small in respect of the numerosity of its branches and leafs, is white, and
divided into fibers.

Carduus Benedictus being exceedingly amare, Vires.
calefies, roborates the heart and vital parts, moves sudour, resists poisons,
conduces against pestilentious diseases, mitigates the dolours of the Reins and
sides, kills Worms, and prevails against the bitings of Serpents.

CHAP. LXIV. Of Cardiobotanum, or Cardiaca, or Motherwort.
MYrepsus in the confecture of his unguent Martiatum, puts Cardiobotanum; Nic.
Praepositus, Carducellum; but what either of them are, we cannot easily define.
Many use white Chamaeleon for Carducellum; and Carduus Benedictus for
Cardiobotanum: others use Cardiaca, or Agripalma; which we call Motherwort.

It is called Cardiaca, from its effect; for it is thought, that it conduces in
heart affections: but it is strange, that so insuave an odor should
laetificate the heart, which delights so much in suaveolents; Cardiaca, or
Agripalma (for so it is often named) is a cubital plant, seldom lower, often
taller, bearing quadrangular, hard, and crasse cauls, of a blackish red color;
its leafs are broad, obscurely green, like nettle leafs, laciniated and divided
with deep incisures; its flowers small, purpureously white, verticulately
circumcinging its furcles, and emerging out of its caulicles. It grows in
incultivated, strong and rough places: some call it Melissa; others Syteritis
Herculana.

It is hot and dry in the second degree, it absterges, expurges, kills
belly-Worms, Vires.
liberates from obstructions, helps in Convulsions, and cures the affections of
the heart; yet its foetour portends it to be no whit cordial.

CHAP. LXV. Of Black Chamaeleon Thistle.
THere are almost innumerable varieties of Thistles, to whose family both the
white and black Chamaeleon are referred; the white has no caul, but from the
midst of its broad, long procumbent leafs, emits a head covered with prickles;
some take it for Carducellum: but the black, which the Romans call Vermilago,
and Carduus Niger, assurges with crasser and higher Cauls; long and broad
leafs, divided on each side with profund sections; out of its summities erupt
certain round heads coacted into umbells, splendent with many little flowers;
its root is crasse, black without, flave within, and very acrimonious to the
gust.

The Root of black Chamaeleon, Vires.
participates of some malignant quality; insomuch that it is never
intrinsecally assumed; but frequently and safely extrinsecally adhibited,
especially when mixed with other medicaments: for, its ferity is retunded by
the concourse of other simples, and it afterward pollicitates a salutary
effect upon some affections, as the Sciatica, and other infections of the skin.

CHAP. LXVI. Of Artichock, or Scolymus.
ARtichock, which the Greeks call Scolymus, is of trivial dignotion: whereof
there are two special differences, the one simply so called, the other Spinose,
and Spanish, which is a kind of Thistle; yea both indeed are depromed from that
tribe, and by culture and Art have acquired a more specious form and gracious
sapour.

The leafs of Artichoak are long, broad, laciniated on both sides with profund
incisures, and of a cineritious color, whence it may be, it was called Cinara;
its surcles are bicubital, whose summities produce a kind of fruit with three
triangular, crasse, hard, medullous leafs compacted like scales: this fruit
cocted till it be soft, is most grateful meat, but it is not so inservient to
venery, as many think; for it adds very little genital matter or flatulent
spirits, but much melancholical succe to the body: ( Gal. l. 6. de alim.
facul.) its flowers conglomerated on slender and innumerable stalks are
caeruleously purpureous: which withering turn into down; small long seeds like
them of Carduus remaining therein: Wild Scolymus is very like the spinous
Artichock; the slender Cauls of Cinara or Artichock condited with Sugar are
grateful to eat, and much celebrated in opsonies.

The juice of Artichock according to Galen is very prave, Vires.
hot in the second degree, bilious and melancholical, moving urine; its root
cocted and drunk in wine, takes away the graveolence of the whole body,
depelling it through the bladder with urine.

CHAP. LXVII. Of Phu, or Valerian.
PHu, which some call wild Spikenard, and Pliny, Cretian Spikenard, is
Valerian, by some called Marinella, whereof there are five sorts; the first is
the male, the second the female, the third the small, the fourth the red, and
the fifth the Grecian Valerian.

The first, whereof Dioscorides alone makes mention by knowledge, has a cubital
caul geniculated, concave, and articulated with tare intervals; its leafs are
long, late, smooth, green, sinuated, very like wild Parsnip leafs, two whereof
emerge out of each genicle of its surcles: its flowers are fair, small,
umbellically collected on the tops of its branches, purpureous and odorate; its
root is of a digital spissitude, transversly sected with many fibers, and
adherent to the surface of the Earth.

It is calefactive and alexiterial, Vires.
whence some call it Theriacaria and herba Benedicta; it is mixed with
Antidotes, and moves urine and flours.

The rest of the Valerians which are seldom or never used, are at large
described in Herballs.

CHAP. LXVIII. Of Fumitory.
FUmitory is so called, because its succe immitted into the eyes cause tears
like fume; It is an herb well known, growing either in Gardens or Fields, it is
very like Coriander, it emits many red, and sometimes white flowers, acuminated
on one side like the crist of a little bird they call the combed Lark; there
are two sorts thereof, the first is vulgar, fruticating among segetives, and in
a prique places; the other, which grows most in Gardens, is bulbous,
subcineritious, variegated sometimes with white, sometimes with luteous or
otherwise colored flowers.

All Fumitory is acrimonious and amare, Vires.
it moves bilious urine, and cures the obstructions and imbecility of the
Liver.

Its juice stilled into ones eyes, wonderfully helps against caliginosity, and
acuates the sight.

The vulgar Fumitory is in frequent use, from which two Syrups are denominated;
the one is the greater Syrup of Fumitory, the other the lesser.

CHAP. LXIX. Of Eyebright.
THis plant which is by some called Ophthalmica, and Ocular herb, is low,
scarce exceeding a foot in height; it emits gracile and black Caulicles, from
its slender and fibrous root, its leafs are small, and serrated like dwarf
elder, flowers white, maculated with minute points: it grows in macilent, dry,
and incultivated places near highways, and margins of fields, that are not
umbrous: it flourishes about the beginning of Autumn, and should then be
gathered and kept: or else its water distilled while it is fresh for their
eyes, to which it very much conduces, and is thence by the Germans called
Solamen oculorum: some call it Euphrosyne, because it exhilarates the mind; for
which effect Bugglosse is sometimes so denominated.

It calefies gently, Vires.
siccates potently, and helps the eyes admirably; for when it is adhibited it
takes away caliginosity, and ours all pituitous diseases therein; the wine
wherein much Eyebright is macerated at Vintage time, does with much efficacy
adjuvate the Eyes, and expugne their affections.

CHAP. LXX. Of the lesser Centory.
THere are two differences of Centories, the one greater, the other less,
which are very dissident each from other in form and faculties; for the greater
has bicubital Cauls, long leafs, cohaering together, and crenated in the
margin, with heads turbinated on the tops of its branches, obduced with
herbaceous scales like Lacea, out of which stamineous, caeruleous, and elegant
flowers erupt, which greater is not of any great moment in medicine; though the
ancients for its dignity have called it Ceutaurium, or Panax.

But the lesser Centory is frequently used, which from its potency in
captivating and expugning Fevers, is often called Febrifugium, and sometimes
from its amaritude Fell terrae, and sometimes Limnision.

It is a small plant assurging with a pedal, angulous Caul, vested with small
leafs like Hypericum, two at each interval, coronated with small purpureous
flowers, which in the daytime are explicated, in the night recluded; short
Cods succeed these, wherein small grains are coarctated: it grows
spontaneously in incultivated, herbous, macilent and aprique places; it is
found in some places with a luteous, in others with a white flower. I have seen
one with purpureous leafs in the middle, in other parts with white ones.

The lesser Centory calefies potently, Vires.
expurges and cures inveterate Ulcers, its decoction takes away the
obstructions of the Liver, and helps against the induration of the milt; its
succe in sod wine educes flours, and accelerates delivery; and emplasticated
with honey, it takes away dimnesse and caliginosity from the Eyes.

CHAP. LXXI. Of Rhaponticum.
RHaponticum is not Rubarb, nor the greater Centory, as many deceived with
their affinity have credited: for But now we have it plentifully growing in
England.
Rhaponticum, is a peregrine root, coming from the Regions beyond Bosphorus in
Thracia, and Pontus in Euxinum; of the crassitude of the greater Radish,
somewhat black and ruddy like the greater Centory, fragile, of a dark red
color within, and of a ferrugineous, subamare, astrictive, and inodorate
sapour, void of all acrimony.

There grows in many Gardens in France, especially in such as appertain to
them that delight in rare simples, Rhaponticum that so well agrees with the
antique, that it seems to be the very same, That root is best which admits no
Worms, and which in manducation becomes pliant and clammy, without much
astriction, and colors the spittle palely red, and Croceous.

It cures the imbecility of the stomach, Vires.
is good against the lienous, hepatical, coxendical and convulsive dolours,
cures burstnesse, circuits of Fevers, and bitings of venenate animals; it is
an useful ingredient, in Antidotes.

CHAP. LXXII. Of Meum, or Spignell.
MEu or Meum, Species.
is twofold; the one most laudable, which is found in Macedonia, and copiously
in Athamanthe, whence they call it Athamanticum: the other more vulgar, which
grows in many places in France and Italy, which Herbalists call sometimes the
wild Dill; sometimes tortuous Fennel; both of them have small, angust, and
capillaceous leafs, gracile and cubital surcles, out of whose summities umbells
with candid flowers emerge, to which angulous, long, odorate and acrimoniously
amare seeds succeed, greater then Cumin seed; its roots are very slender and
odorate.

It calefies in the third, Vires.
and siccates in the second degree, it incides, attenuates, expurges, removes
obstructions, moves urine and flours, discusses, the flatuosity of the stomach,
takes away the stopings of the Liver, and emends the vices of the reins.

CHAP. LXXIII. Of Anethum, or Dill.
BOth Medicks and women, make use of Anethum; the women in June, at which time
it is coronated with flowers, and most fragrant, excerpe or cut it, dry it,
keep it and recond it with their Linen to conciliate a pleasant odor to them;
but the Medicks use its seed also to many things, as we shall hereafter declare.

Now Anethum is of a bicubital procerity, with rotund and geniculated surcles,
leafs dissected small like capillaries, luteous flowers on its muscary; plain,
small, foliated and pallid seed, and a hard fibrous root; it is sown in
Gardens, and annually revives from the deciduous seed; its odor is grave, and
yet jucund and sweet.

It calefies and siccates in the second degree, Vires.
being introsumed it moves urine, allayes gripings and flatuosity, abates
singulture, evokes milk and augments it, it incides, attenuates and cocts
humors.

CHAP. LXXIIII. Of Macedonian Petroseline.
PEtroseline is either vulgar, frequent in our Gardens, which Physicians call
Garden Smallage; and the vulgarity, Parsley: which as a grateful Pot-herb is
inservient to culinary uses; Or Macedonian, which is diversely depinged, by
herbalists. For Lobelius contends that in caul, leafes, umbells, and seed it is
very like the vulgar or Garden Parsley, only, it grows in Praerupt and saxous
places, whence it is called Petrapium and Petroseline: so that ours and the
Garden is one; the wild and the Macedonian Parsley, the same also: yet Fuchsius
says it has leafes like Pimpinella, and seeds like Ammi, Odorate, Acrmionious
and Aromaolent. And this same description he received not only by tradition
from Dioscorides, but saw and experienced; for when he had committed the seed
of Macedonian Petroseline to the Earth, he found the Plant, thence produced to
bear leafes respondent to Pimpinella, and seed conditionated as Dioscorides
had described.

It grows copiously in Macedonia, especially in rough and saxous places.

It calefies and siccates notably, moves urine, educes flowers, Vires.
eases the colicall dolor, mitigates gripings, cures the dolours of the sides,
Reins, and Liver, discusses flatuosity, attenuates, incides and successefully
ingredes the confecture of Antidotes.

CHAP. LXXV. Of Coriander.
THough Coriander be a tetrous and graveolent herb, yet is it sown and
cultivated in Gardens; for its grains by frication depose their ungrateful
odor, and become suaveolent; its surcle is very slender, round, cubitall, and
ramous; its leafes are at first like them of Adiantum, laciniated and variously
incided, for the part next the caul, is less sected, the remoter, more; its
flowers are white on large umbells; its seed made round, firm, somewhat
striated, and inane, which at first is green, then luteously white, its root
short, hard and fibrous; the odor of its leafes is putrid and tetrous.

It seed is commonly prepared with Vinegar, for the castigation of some inique
quality, but desiccation effects as much, so that it may thenceforth be desumed
without further preparation.

Coriander is refrigerative according to Dioscorides and cures biles, pimples
and inflammations, if taken in bread or pancakes. Vires.
But Galen dissents from this tenent proveing it to be calid, and not to help
biles or the like, but only small watery powks, for it calefies moderately,
resiccates manifestly, and is somewhat astrictive.

CHAP. LXXVI. Of Capers.
THe Caper shrub grows spontaneously in many places, making much prouent in
dry and desert fields without the help of the Ploughman; it is a senticous
shrub, low, and hamated with many a dark Prickles, whose aculeated branches are
orbicularly spread on the ground, its leafes are circinated like them of
Quince-Trees, out of whose wings erupt long pedicles, capitulated with round
umbells, which dehisteing expand white flwers, whereunto long fruits full of
Acinous seeds succeed.

These rudments of flowers, or small heads, while they are yet nodose and not
explicate, are by Pharmacopolists evelled, condited and brine; and kept for
Capers, the lesser are better then the larger, this conditure makes them more
suaue and whol-some both for medicinal uses and esure, the root of this shrub
is also praescinded, its bark separated siccated and text; Capers afford but
small Aliment to their assumers because of the tenuity of their parts, and are
therefore rather subserivent to mediniall uses, yet they mutuate a certain
savor pergratefull to the stomach from this brine; that invites the ranseative
to banquets and revotes the languishing appetite.

Caper both fruit and root is calefactive extersive and purgative, Vires.
it incides and digests, roborates helps and minuates the spleen, removes
obstructions; and cures all diseases ariseing from the insariture imbecility
of the spleen.

CHAP. LXVXII. Of upright holy suckles or Woodbind.
THis Plant the Romans call volucrum majus, sometimes Caprifolium scribonius
largus calls it Matrisglua, and some the Lilly among Thorns, it is a Surculons
Lignous and Scansory shrub circumuoluring it self about the Vicine-Trees, and
with its obsequious surcles, ascending their summities. It Is leafes which are
posited at distance, and two together at each Genicle are long, smooth, sofi,
of a whitish green color, more white one the lower side, its flowers white and
sometimes flave, long, fistulous, gapeing in their extremities, many congested
together Garland wise, and suaveolent, out of whose middle come some lusts, its
fruit somewhat red, round racemously cohaerem, wherein a hard seed is contained
its root is crasse and lignous, and of no use in Pharmany.

It grows in Woods and Hedges, so straightly amplexing trees sometimes, that
it leaves thereon the impression of its circumvolutions.

Some of these Woodbinds in amplexing the vicine trees, take their rounds from
the Orient to the Occident; others from the occident to the orient; and that at
all times and in all places.

It calefies and siccates evidently, diminishes the Spleen, conduces to the
orthopnoical, moves urine, adimates singultion, accelerates delivery in birth,
deleates the pimples of the face, Vires.
and by long use causes sterility both in man and woman.

Xylosteron is very like this honey-suckle or woodbind, but that it needs no
fulciments for its supporture; as this requires.

CHAP. LXXVIII. Of Broom.
THe very Maids know Broom, which they collect and colligate for Beesoms; ours
grows in incultivated and dry places, and is wild; the Spanish Broom, which is
our Garden Broom, is like the wild, but its branches, leafs; and flowers are
larger.

The flowrs of the Spanish Broom, are more graveolent then its branches; the
branches of the wild Broom more tetrous then its flowers.

There is a low kind of Broom which we call Genistella, whose caulicles are
each way extended into membranous wings instead of leafs, which is neglected as
useless in medicine: Broom flourishes at the beginning of the spring, whose
flowers not then perfectly explicated, are collected and condited with Vinegar
and Salt, and kept for Winter-Acetaries like Capers.

It calefies and siccates to the second degree; its flowers are chiefly
commended to the expediating of the infarctures of the Spleen and Liver; one
dragme, or a dragme and a half of its feed brayed and drunk in three ounces of
sweet water, Vires.
moves and subduces the belly, opens the bladder, and cures Strangury.

CHAP. LXXIX. Of Savine.
THere are two sorts of Savine; the one bacciferous, the other devoid of all
fruit; both low, like Juniper, and always green; Species.
that which is not gravidated with Berries is more graveolent, rigid and rough
with short pricles, its Come is always green, its odor molestfull, and its
fapour fervid and acrimonious: this is always low, diffusing it self
laterally, and sometimes assurging on high, if its boughs which circumdate its
Caul be praescinded.

The other is not so horrid, not aculeated with any prickles, very like
Tamarisk, not so graveolent as the former; it bears subpuniceous and resinous
Berries: this delights not in frigid soyls, but grows copiously and
spontaneously in hot places.

Besides the two former, Belonius says, that in Crete and Mysia he saw another
sort which was arboreous, in magnitude and manner of an Almond-tree, whom I had
rather believe, then go so far to see the truth.

It is hot and dry in the third degree, Vires.
it educes blood with urine, moves flowers, and taken in wine or adhibited, it
excusses the young whether alive or dead.

CHAP. LXXX. Of Rosemary.
DIoscorides gives the name Libanotis to two very different Plants; Species.
the first he calls foecund and frugiferous Libanotis, or Rosemary, whose leafs
are like Fennel, spread along the ground, and suaveolent, whose Caul is
cubital, or higher, concave and capitulated with umbells, wherein is contained
long and acrimonious seed called Canchrys: Of this there are three varieties,
one whereof is this described; the second is very like the former, only its
seed is more broad, not so mordacious, nor acrimonious; the third bears neither
flower nor seed.

The other sort is Coronary, much dissimilar to the former, for it is a lignous
shrub, having many slender, long cauls, circumvested with angust and hard
leafs, whitish below, and green above, coronated on each side, with
caeruleously candescent flowers; though its odor be grave, yet it is not
ungrateful, but roborates the brain and nerves; it is planted in every garden,
growing spontaneously in the hotter Regions of France; it flourishes twice a
year in Spring and Autumn.

It is calefactive, Vires.
cures the Jaundice, if its decoction be drunk before exercise, and after
exercise the diseased ingrede a bath and drink wine: it helps against the
resolution of the Nerves, and stupour, and all diseases arising from the frigid
humors in the brain.

CHAP. LXXXI. Of Agnus Castus, or White Willow.
THere grows a certain odorate shrub in hot Countries about the brinks of
Rivers, torrent Channels, and rough places, which they call Agnus Castus, or
white Willow, with leafs like Hemp, yet not serrated in their ambient, long,
acuminated, and cohaering on one pedicle a piece; its boughs are long, lent,
not fragile, its flowers are subpurpureous, verticulately circundating the
summities of its surcles; its seed is rotund like Cardamome: it is called Agnus
Castus, because its leafs and flowers strewed under one, conduces to their
Chastity.

It calefies and siccates notably, validly discussing all flatuosity; Vires.
it auxiliates in venenate bitings, and affections of the Spleen; it moves
flowers, cohibits the motion of sperm, and allayes venereous fancies in the
night as well as Rue seed, for which cause the Athenian Matrons in their Feasts
to Ceres, the better to custom their Chastity, strewed their beds with its
leafs.

CHAP. LXXXII. Of the Ash and Ashton Keys.
THe Ash is a tall Tree, which the Greeks call Media and Milea, not only used
in the fabrication of ligneous vessels, but also accommodated to medicinary
uses; whose bark, wood, and fruit, afford many commodious medicaments: it
assurges with a very crasse and high Caul, involved in a slender and smooth
bark, with long leafs consisting of many together, and adhering to one pedicle
like Liquorice or Wallnut leafs.

Many Cods colligated together upon one pedicle, issue out of its slender
boughs, without any praegession of conspicuous flowers which Cods resembling
birds tongues, and their Medulla a lingel, are called Birds tongues; by the
Greeks, Ornithoglossa.

The Ancients have noted such an Antipathy betwixt Serpents, and this Tree,
that they had rather run into the fire, then creep upon its leafs and boughs,
if they were circundated with both.

Its leafs and bark calefie moderately, and siccate efficaciously; Vires.
and its seed which we call Ornithoglossum, is hot and dry in the second
degree. Now if this Tree be so averse from Serpents, that its very shade
abigates them, its leafs, succe, or other parts duly assumed or adhibited, must
needs produce potent effects upon poisons; they are therefore useful for the
curation of such affections as participate of any malign quality, and good
ingredients to Antidotes: its seed is much celebrated for exciting of venery,
it cures the dolours of the Liver and Spleen, proceeding from a cold cause, if
it be taken in wine.

CHAP. LXXXIII. Of Viscus Quercinus, or of Misselto of the Oak.
THere are three sorts of Misselto, one whereof is (as they say)
Collalchrymated our of black Camelaeon Thistle, about the rising of the Dog
Star, which according to Pliny; Scribonius, and Hesichius is venenate, and by
them named Ixia; the second is Malacticall extracted from the berryes, to take
and hold Birds, which is made of Holly-bark elixated; sepulted in mud,
putrifyed, brayed and washed in water, till the bark be separated, and the glue
alone remain.

The third sort is, as it were, one Plant growing upon another, no part of the
same; the earth brings it not forth, nor yet is it produced by sature, but
fruticates and grows upon an aliene Plant, whose leafe-fades not, nor vigor
fails: it grows not only on one Tree, but many very dissimilar, as Oaks,
Ap^^e-Trees whether domestic or wild, Willowes, Poplar and many more.

These very seldom exceed a cubit in height, but they extend themselves
laterally, with many short, geniculated, ligneous and dilutely green boughs,
with long, broad, striated and somewhat flave leafes; round, white and splended
berries grow on their genicles; whereon Thrushes, Stock-Doves and the like,
feed in Winter. They have no roots unless the fibers and boughs of the
Viscigerous Trees be their roots. It is fabulous that this viscum will not
grow, unless the seed, whereof they say it is produced, be intermitted through
the belly of some Bird.

And it is as ridiculous that Athenaeus writes, If, says he, a Stock-Dove eat
the seed of this viscum, it will grow upon what ever tree she exonerates her
belly, for it springs neither from seed nor dung, but from the sudour of that
Tree whereon it grows, but that is best that grows on Oaks.

It calefies with some acritude and amarity; yet it is of that rank of simples
which requires some time before it exerts its calefactive quality. Vires.
After application it discusses, mollifyes, and attracts; mixed with Wax and
Rosine it draws lumps, imposthumes, and other swellings to maturity, and is
very good against the Epilepsy.

CHAP. LXXXIIII. Of Poplar.
THe Poplar Tree is threefold, Sone is white, the second black, the third
Lybian or tremulous, this last sort grows equally in dry and humid places; the
other two are only delighted with wet soyles: the first sort has a crasse,
tall Caul, vested with a smooth white bark, its leafs are broad, incided,
angulous, tremulous, like tussilage, smooth and green above, lanuginous and
white beneath, adhering to a long pedicle.

The black Poplar does sooner erect it self on high, with a crasse, smooth and
white Caul; a round, long, hederaccous leaf appended on a long small pedicle;
it emits long down, and a kind of a Cluster, whereon some grains like round
Pepper adhaere, which drawing to maturity, fall off before they dehisoe.

The first buds this tree emits, which are the rudiments of future leafs, are
long and acute, full of some fat, oleous, and resinous matter, which is
subflave, and adheres to the fingers of the Tangents. Apothecaries call them
oculus populi, which excerpe in the beginning of the Spring, bruise, and recond
in a figuline vessel with swines grease till June, for the confecture of the
poplar Unguent: Bees collect a kind of Lachryma of its leafs, wherewith they
make their propoly.

The Lybian tremulous or mountain Poplar, varies little from the black in
superficies, but its leafs are harder, lesser, more profoundly serrated and
adherent to a longer pedicle; and therefore more obvious to motion by the wind,
which by their collision make a noise; some think this is Ceris, but that seems
by Theophrastus his description to be the same that we call Judas-tree.

Black Poplar Gemmes or eyes, are only usurped for Pharmacy, Vires.
and they are calefactive and siccative, by the tenuity of their parts inciding
and mollifying: their Leafs participate of the same faculties, but in a more
imbecill degree, brayed and illited with vinegar, they cure the podagrical
dolor.

Whether Poplars lachrymate into the river Padus, there making Amber by their
coition, as Dioscorides and many of his followers believe, we shall hereafter
determine it.

SECT. V. Of Refrigerative Simples.
THe best Medicaments do not grow in every Region, but some in Hat, and others
in cold: here Corn, and there Grapes; those Regions which look toward the
Meridian, and the Aestuous Aspect of thy Heaven do bear Hot Simples: But these
that are toward the North, Cold. And whilst those Physicians that inhabit
Foreign Climates, etc. Asia and Africa, do Investigate or find (...) the
Virtues of their Simples for their healths and safety; Let us view our Field of
Plants which they want, which indeed are endowed with most (...) ^ertues. How
many Simples have we, which will not grow in Egypt, or China, or in any other
place under the Pole-antartick; Europe, besides those Calefactories, wherewith
it is Luxuriant, pr^d^ces many (...). Amongst which, we shall only handle
(...) are mentioned in the Compositions in our Shop.

CHAP. I. Of Mandrake.
I Hitherto thought that all that I heard of Mandrakes were no more then old
Wifes fables, yet I now find that these figments have been depromed from the
writings of some of the ancients, who being too credulous have committed to
press what the imperite somniated: for some of the Greeks named this root
Circea because they Judged it some Philthrum conducing to love-matters.
Phythagoras called it Anthropomorphon because it in some wise represented man's
Trunk and Members, and because its roots were frequently geminell, resembling
two Legs, and two Buttocks; in allusion to which name the septentrionall
idiome calls it Mandragora, Man denoting a man, and Draghen in that Language
man's form: but all these are fabulous and fictitious, whereby running
circulatours deceive the incautious, circumducing a bisidous root, whereon they
have insculpted a humane shape and discriminated members. Of which root they
tell admirable and incredible stories, that they may extort money from idiots.

Some call it the dogs Apple Tree, others the earths Apple Tree, because it
bears round luteous Apples like the yolks of hard eggs which are odorate, but
venenate withal.

There are two sorrs thereof, the one masculine or white, which the Greeks call
(...), some Arsen, and others Hypoplomon; with great leafes like Bett, large
and smooth.

The other faeminine or black, which emitts more angust leafes like Lettice but
lesser, somewhat hirsute and procumbent; it bears Apples like the masculine,
but lesser and lutrously pallescent: it has often two or three roots, mutually
convolved and intorted, which are black without, white within, carnose, long
and crasse.

Mandrake is very impatient of solar heat, it fruticates best in umbrous and
aprique places; whence many learned authors think its derive its nomenclature,
because it delights in Mandris, that is, in Caves and Dens.

In Dioscorides his time the succe of Mandrake was collected, which concreted
by insolation was of much use, now we only use its Roots and Leafes, and them
very seldom, and only in such affections as contemn more gentle
stupefactives.

An oil may be extracted out of its Apples by infusion, as we have showed in
our officine; which prudently adhibited will take away any dolor and
conciliate sleep.

Mandrake is seldom assumed at the mouth; but some other soporiferous
medicament, duly castigated, which would without danger consopite the senses,
should be given in its stead to such as would be burned or cut in any part
without sense of dolor: for Mandrake is not only impensely cold, Mala insana
melongena.
but also narcoticall, and therefore cannot be safely used without great care
and prudence, for Aetius enumerates it amongst poisons, ( C. 45. Lib. 4 Sermon.
1).

There is a Plant that has some cognation with Mandrake which bears Apples of
a caeruleous purple color, about the magnitude of an egg, which some call
insane Apples, others Melongena, and some love-Apples, they grow on a pedall
surcle, amicted on both sides with leafes like Nightshade, from whose middle
upwards, white flowers emerge, whereunto these Apples succeed which are
carnose, succulent, and praegnant with small grains; some use them in
acetaryes, not without danger to their sanity.

CHAP. II. Of Nightshade.
THere are many varieties of Nightshade, Species.
the first according to Dioscorides is sative and domestic, which Theophrastus
reposes amongst Pot Herbs; but now it is neither eaten nor sown, but grows
and germinates spontaneously, against the Gardners will; it bears
black-berryes, Morella
whence the french call it Morella, the shopmen Solatrum, and the Greeks
Strychion.

It is a pedall and racemous Plant, with leafes like oxymum, but greater; black
berryes, racemously coherent, which at first are green, after maturity, black;
purpureous and elegant flowers praecede these, out of whose middle erupts a
luteous and specious tufr

It is exceedingly refrigerative, and therefore cures the Wildfire and
Headaches from a hot cause; it helps a hot Stomach its berries are accessory
to the unguent of Diapompholigos; its stillatious liquor cures the inflammation
of the eyes and ardour of other parts, and being stupefactive conciliates sleep.

There is another dormitory Nightshade which is exceedingly soporiferous, it is
a ramous Plant, with hard fruit, many large leafes, somewhat hirsute, and
effigiated like them of Quince-Trees its root is red without, and whitish when
it is dry; its flower is large somewhat red, and of an ungrateful aspect, out
of whose cavity, a round fruit, about the magnitude of a Cherry emerges, which
presently kills its introsumers; it is more soporiferous then opium it self; it
fruticates in many wild and incultivated places, especially in banks not far
distant from the sea, whence botanicks call it marine Nightshade; shopmen,
Solatrum.

The third sort is the furious and lethall Nightshade, which some call
Thryoron, others Perisson; it bears leafes like Rocket, but greater, acceding
near them of Beares-foot; its caules are many, tall, and specious; its flowers,
blackish: whereunto racemous, black, round fruits praegnant with ten or twelve
stones succeed: it is thought to be the same that many call Daryon or
Dorcynion. Some think there is no difference betwixt Nightshade that is only
somniferous, and that, that is lethall; but perite Herbalists find much of
discrimination.

The fourth sort is arboreous and ligneous, called by some Dulcamare, which
Vine-like climbs up shrubs and hedges, with leafes and surcles like Smilax, but
harder and blacker; with purpureous, violaceous and inverted flowers; out of
whose middle a luteous tuft emerges, to which small succulent and venenate
berryes succeed.

Another Plant which some call Uva Lupina, others Aconitum, Pardalianches, and
others the herb Paris, which Gesnerus calls Monococcorn, and Pena stinking
Nightshade, is by the common suffrage of many writers justly referred to the
number of Nightshade, none whereof are at any time used by medicks save the
Garden Nightshade, and that but seldom; for that is an ill medicine which
threatens more of danger then cure.

There is yet another Plant which by its effigy and virtue challenges affinity
with the Nightshades, some call it Stramonium or better Strychmonium, some
Lycopersium, others Metel, and others Hyoscyamus, Peruvianus, and
Baryococcalon; whereof there are two sorts; the one greater, which in procerity
exceeds a man's height; the other lesser, which is bicubitall, both of them
alike in effigies, both bearing great, white flowers like Smilax, crasse
spinous and echinated apples; the lesser bears rotund ones, the great
acuminated, whose leafes and all other parts are greater then the other.

There is yet another Plant which has cognation with the Nightshades; which
some call pomiferous Nightshade, Pomiferum
some Lycopersicum, for it bears Apples of an aureous croceous color, which
Herbalists call the wonderful and the golden Apples; some would reduce Pliny's
Ammonum to Nightshade; but the disparity of their effigies and natures,
evidences the contrary.

CHAP. III. Of Alkekengi, or Winter-Cherryes.
THe second sort of Nightshade, is Dioscorides his Halicacabus, which
Apothecaryes, following the Mauritanian word, call Alkekangi; whereof we treat
distinctly, Solanum vesicarium
because of its excellent uses. It is from the figure of its grains, which
invested in a certain membraneous involucre resemble a bladder, called the
vesicary Nightshade: it grows, and fruticates plenteously in squalid places as
amongst Vines, emitting cubitall, slender, round subrubrous and geniculated
caulicles; its leafes are like Nightshade, but something greater; its flowers
are somewhat white, to which husks like bladders succeed, which at first are
green, afterward Phaeniceous; in whose continent, round grains of the
magnitude effigies and color of Cherryes are included: which grains are
carnous and turgid with plain, round and whitish seeds.

These fruits are well known to very boys who call them Winter-Cherryes, who
eat frequently, Vires.
and innoxiously a great quantity thereof: they wonderfully conduce to the
motion and protrusion of urine and sand out of the reins and bladder.

CHAP. IIII. Of Henbane.
HEnbane is by some called Herba suilla, because Swine eating thereof are in a
manner convelled; others call it Altercum and Apollo his herb, because such as
are madded with Henbane, torment themselves with brawling and altercations, as
if they were excited by Phoebus his fury. Matthiolus saw some boys, who by
eating Henbane seed were so desipient, that many thought they were deluded by
the Devil.

There are three sorts of Henbane, the black, the white and the luteous, the
black has long hirsute and broad leafes like longwort, laciniated like
beares-foot; cubitall, crasse, brachiated and ramous caules, out of whose
middle pallescent flowers do erupt; to which certa in ventricose, long, round,
and supernally aculeated cups do succeed, like small boxes or scales, dissepted
with little fences, wherein small dusky and obscure seed is contained, its root
is white, crasse, easily eradicable, vivacious for a years space, very useful
and anodynous, not so foetid as its leafes.

The two other sorts of Henbane are rare, no where to be found save in Gardens;
which are also as rarely used in medicine, whereas the usurpation of the black
is quotidian: all of them refrigerate in the third degree, and all of them are
narcoticall, but the white neither refrigerates nor stupefies so much as the
other.

CHAP. V. Of Poppy.
THere are two general kinds of Poppy, the one Hortensian, the other
Sylvestrian, there are many varietyes of the Hortensian desumed from the
various color, density and figure of their flewers, thus one is simple,
another multiflorous, then both either white, or purpureous, or red: the
sylvestrian also is variously discriminated, as the red the black, the spumous
and the corniculated wild Poppy which is fourfold; one common and luteous,
another violaceous, and other two Phaeniceous.

The sative Poppy erects it self upon bicubitall surcles, Luteum.
with long and pallid leafes circually ferrated, and adhaerent to no pedicle,
with either white or red flowers according to the variety of the Plant, with
rotund and long heads: in whose cells black seed is contained, if the Plant be
black; white, if it be white.

The erraticall or red Poppy is called (...) or fluid, Erraticum.
because its flower is so deciduous; its leafes are incided and sharp like
Rocket leafes, its flower red, and seed yellow, it grows in fields amongst
segetives.

The spumeous was unknown to Matthiolus; Spumeum.
the later writers take it for hedge Hyssop, and some for Sopewort.

The corniculated Poppy has subalbid leafs, Corniculatum.
serrated about like the red Poppy, luteous flowers, a small fruit, or cod,
inflected like a horn, like the cornicle of fennigreek.

The multiflorous, fimbriated, patulous, and roseous Poppyes of various colors
are studiously sown in cultivated and fat Gardens for the elegancy of their
flowers.

All of them are endued with a refrigerative faculty, the red most, so that
none can use that alone, as they may do the sative, all of them also
participate of an hypnoticall quality, but the black most, which is infested
also with some malignant quality, so that he that uses it immoderately will
become lethargicall.

Poppy vulnerated will emit a certain gummeous liquor, which the Ancients named
(...), which opium stupifies the senses, conciliates sleep, and appeases the
immanity of any dolor, or at least deludes it, whereof such as followed the
Turkish tents made use; that they might be more cheerful to battle, and like
drunken men praecipitate themselves upon perils.

It is not yet determined amongst medicks in what degree, Opii qualitates.
Opium participates of the first qualities; for whereas excellent writers
assent that it is cold above the third degree, its very amaritude and acrimony,
wherewith it disturbs and vellicates the senses gustative, demonstrates the
contrary, which detorted from others the confession of its calidity.

CHAP. VI. Of Sempervives or House-leeks.
THe vulgarity call it Sedum Lombarda, the Greeks Aizoon, House-leek.
the Romans Sempervivum, because it is always green, with eternal leafes,
most patient of cold, which withers not with the greatest Rigidity that Winter
tempests bring upon the Earth.

It grows in dry places exposed to the Sun, as on Walls, and the tops of your
Cottages, with crasse carnose and mucronated leafes like Artichock, succulent
and green, denser near the root with a pedall caul, vested to the top with
leafes disposed like scales, when it is divided into wings, and coronated with
green and subrubeous flowers.

There are many varieties of Sempervives, all which I reduce to three general
heads, the greater, the lesser, and the middle sort; if we have any respect to
the name and effigies of the greater, we may refer the herb Aloes thereunto,
whose condition challenges cognation with this family; to the middle sort we
may referr Crassula or the Greeks Telephion, which Apothecaryes call the
inverted Bean, and the vulgarity Orpine; as also the militar Aizoides and the
water-leeke: for both of them are pervivacious, perpetually green, and relate
very much to Houseleek: and this is the middle betwixt the greater sempervive,
and all the other which we shall now describe; and this Sedum, Aizoon is rather
the medium then any other hortensian teretifolious esculent, which is mixed in
Acetaryes, some call it little-leeke, others middle-leeke, the vulgarity
Triquemadame: from a small root it emitts many gracile branches, onusted with
small, long, round, carnose, and mucronated leafes, and luteous and stellated
flowers.

There are very many lesser Sempervives, the least whereof the Greeks call
(...), the vulgarity Birds-bread, which many constitute the third sort of
Small-leeke: it is a small and pleasant Plant, reptant with many branches,
aureous and stellated flowers, it delights in walls, and saxous places; it is
very hot to the gust, and exulcerative, whence the Germans call it Wall-Pepper.

The second sort of the lesser Aizoon, is by some called the lesser Crassula,
by the Italians Granellosa; by Apothecaryes stone Crop and sometimes
Wall-tayle; it is a small Plant, with round, long carnose leafes, mucronated
like little Worms; all depending on exile and short branches, with pallid and
sometimes white flowers which ingrede the composition of the martiate unguent,
these two lesser Sempervives calefy and exulcerate notably.

The third sort is a greater sort of Houseleeke called summer-Leeke, which
assurges with greater surcles, round and carnose leafes like Stone-Crop, but
greater; it flourishes no where perpetually but withers at the beginning of
Winter.

Many other Plants which are perpetually folious and virid, do in effigies and
faculties challenge cognation with Sempervives, and may justly be referred to
their family as Aizoon Hematoides, Aizoon Scorpioides, a kind of Petrous,
Montanous, and small House-leeke, another great and arboreous one, and another
assurging like a shrub with small and rigid surcles.

The greater Sempervive refrigerates in the third degree, and is thence adapted
to the cure of St. Anthonyes fire pimples and inflammations, some of the lesser
refrigerate in a lesser degree, others efficaciously calefye and exulcerate, as
Stone-Cropp, and so all Pepper.

CHAP. VII. Of Cynoglosse, or Doggs-tongue.
CYnoglosse has molliceous, lent, and long leafes, it is somewhat lanuginous,
but not sharp to the tact, caeruleously green, in effigies and softness
aemulateing a Doggs-tongue.

Its surcles are round, hoary, divided into wings, and cubitall, coronated with
puniceous and purpureous flowers; four small, cohaerent seeds which cleave to
men's clothes like burres succeed each flower; its root is crasse, in magnitude
and color like Wallwort, in odor almost soporiferous, whose use is celebrated
in sharp and thin fluxes, for it incrassates much, and refrigerates
manifestly; Vires.
whence women adhibite it to burnings: it is cold and dry in the second degree,
endued with a cohibiting and incrassating faculty; and therefore it is the
basis of those pills which bear its denomination, and are effectually
praescribed to all diseases which arise from the fluidity of humors.

CHAP. VIII. Of Plantain.
PLantain is either aquaticall whereof there are three sorts, seldom or never
used in Pharmacy; or terrestrial, whose usurpation in defending sanity,
Species.
and profligating diseases is frequent, whereof Dioscorides constitutes two
differences, the greater and the lesser; the greater comprehends three
varieties, the vulgar, the hoary, and the roseous Plantain.

The vulgar has crasse, broad, and very green leafes like Beat; its caul is
angulous, sometimes cubitall, sometimes shorter, spicated at the top and
praegnant with small and copious seed, it grows in moist and lacunous places,
and about high-way-sides.

The Roseous Plantain is so called, because it bears an herbid and patulous
umbell compacted of many leafes, cohaerent like a rose, it is in other things
very like the former.

The lesser Plantain has more angust, smaller, softer and more tenuious
leafes, its caulicle is angulous, declined downwards; its flowers pallid, seeds
small, which grow upon the summityes of its surcles, the Apothecaryes call it
Lanceolate, and lanceole because its leafes are acuminated lance-wise, from its
five distinct fibers or nerves, which it has in its sulcated leafes, it is
sometimes called Quinquenerve; and Septinerve, when besides its five greater,
two lesser nerves emike in its leafes; some have depraved it of quinq nerve,
and made it centinerve; others call it Arnoglosse because its leafes resemble a
Lambs tongue, but such as bear rounder and lanuginous leafes are more
specially designed with that name.

Plantain is cold and dry in the second degree, it astringes, condensates,
cohibites, absterges, and thence conduces to the cure of pimples, St. Anthonyes
fire, Vires.
inflammations and all sanguine eruptions; it stays fluxes, cutes the
dysentery and all belly fluxes, exarceats putretude, and roborates all parts.

CHAP. IX. Of Knot-grasse or Polygonum.
CEntinode or Knot-grasse is so called from the frequency of its knotts,
Seminall or Polygonum, from the multitude of its seed, it is sometimes called
Corrigiola, sometimes sanguinary from staying blood, and sometimes Proserpinaca,
or rather Serpinaca from its reptility; it is a low reptant herb, with exile,
copious, nodose and geniculated branches; leafes like Rue, but longer and
softer under which much small seed lies with praevious and rubeously pallid
flowers, it grows spontaneously in incultivated soyles and paths, it dies not
by calcitration.

The masculine Polygonum is refrigerative, astrictive, and spissative, and
thence it is praevalent against pimples, St. Authonyes fire, Vires.
and all inflammations.

Its succe imbibed by the mouth, allayes all red or bloody flouors and
excrements; and stays the impense flux of the belly.

It is also good against the ardour of the stomach, and the bitings of venenate
animalls.

The other sort of Polygonum or faeminine centinode assurges on one caul like
a slender reed, or rather the herb horse-tayle, with dense genicles, which are
orbicularly circumvested with slender leafes like them of itch-Tree; it grows
in watery places.

There is also a marine Knot-grasse, neither known nor used by medicks; some,
deceived with the affinity of the words, take Polygonum for Poligonatum, and on
the contrary; but they are very dissimilar in form; for Poligonatum, or
Solomon's Seal, is a cubitall Plant with a rigid and crooked caul; a crasse
nodose root.

CHAP. X. Of Comfrey.
THere are three greater Comfryes, Species.
the first is Alam or the vulgar, which they call great Comfrey; the second,
the Tuberous; the third the Maculous: there be also three middle ones, the
Petraean, the Bugulous, and Prunella, but many small ones, as all the Bellides
which the vnlgarity calls Margarits, whereof there are many varietyes, which
are rather coronary then Medicinal.

The greater Comfrey, which from the similitude of its leafes is called Asses
ear, has a cubitall caul, ample, long, broad crasse and hispid leafes like
Buglosse, but broader, more obscure and mucronated; out of the wings of its
surcles erupt productions of Leafes, wherein white pallid or subrubeous flowers
grow, which are disposed in an elegant order, whereunto black seeds like them
of petty Mullein do succeed; its root is glutinous, black without, white
within, whereof there is frequent use in Pharmacy.

Comfrey refrigerates, Vires.
contracts, astringes, and condenses, cohibits St. Anthonyes fire, cures broken
bones; stays the flux of blood, eases the dysentery; and is so efficacious in
consolidating wounds, that if it be cocted with flesh, it conglutinates its
parts together.

The maculated Comfrey which most call Pulmonary or Lung-wort has branches,
leafes, and flowers like the praecedent, only its leafes are shorter, and
maculated with white spots, it grows in woody, opaque, and umbrous places,
and it is thought good against the vices of the Lungs.

The Petraean Comfrey which is so called because it grows in Petrous and stony
places, erects it self with small and slender branches like Origanum; with
small Leafes, heads like Thyme; and a ruddy, long, and crasse root, some think
that this Sympythum is Bugle, but being lignous and odorated and capitulated
like thyme, it differs much from Bugle.

Bugle is a certain middle kind of Sympythum; of which the past age knew, and
praedicated many and admirable things: the vulgarity yet persuading themselves,
that they need neither Medick, nor Surgeon that have bugle, which they
thence call Sanikle; its leafes are crasse, long, small, mucronated, incided
about, and subrubrous, its caules quadrangular, and somewhat hirsute; its
flowers caeruleous, and many even from the middle of the surcles upwards: some
call it Morandola; some, Laurentina; and others, the middle Comfrey: it is a
vulnerary, and is much commended to disrupted, broken, bruised and convelled
members.

Brunella or Brunella, which some add to the Tribe of Comfreys, is a low
plant, with slender, quadrangular, hirsute and decumbent surcles; broad,
mucronated, but short, somewhat hispid, obscurely virid, viscid and fat leaves;
caeruleously purpureous flowers, erupting out of the summities of its surcles,
in ears like Betony flowers, it is good for the same, that Bugle pollicitates;
it deleates the blackness of the tongue contracted by Fevers, if the mouth be
washed with its decoction.

CHAP. XI. Of Sorrel.
DIoscorides enumerates Sorrel amongst the sorts of Lapathum, not because
their sapour seems to be similar, which is in Lapathum somewhat sweet or rather
insipid, and in Sorrel acid, whence it is called Oxalis; but because its leafs
are mucronated like them of Lapathum.

Sorrel is sufficiently known to all; and it is of two sorts, Species.
the one wild, which is least, and most acid; growing copiously in sabulous,
macilent, and segetary places; which the Hollanders call Acetosa vervecina;
other, Vineta.

The other is greater, which delights in humid places, as in Meadows, and many
Gardens, whereof there are two varieties, one always hortensian and reptant,
very dissimilar to the rest in effigies; for its leafs are round, and its
color subcineritiously virid; its sapour indeed is acid like the rest, but
more grateful to the palate: the other is well known, which is understood
always when Sorrel is put absolutely; this is from its great and sacred
effects called sometimes sacred or holy grass.

Oxalis brings to my mind the herb Oxytriphilum, or sower trifoile, which the
vulgarity calls Cuckow-bread; the Apothecaries, Alleluga; and Fracastorius,
Lugula: it is a low plant growing in the beginning of the Spring in sylvous
places, with slender and short Caulicles, on whose summities three, tenuious,
virid, acid, and grateful leafs do inside; its flowers consisting of white
leafs coherent, do depend on short pedicles; this little herb recreates the
heart, exarceates putretude, and refrigerates; its water distilled helps in
continual and pestilent Fevers.

CHAP. XII. Of Oxylapathum, or Sowerdock.
LEst confusion should bring obscurity upon the dignotion of these Simples, I
shall constitute the difference betwixt Lapathum, and Hippolapathum,
Hydrolapathum, Oxylapathum, and sanguineous Lapathum. Lapathum simply so
called, is a pot-herb, expetible for culinary matters, which the Cooks call
Patience; the Herbalists, Parella.

Hippolapathum is either latifolious, or rotundifolious; both cultivated, and
called Monks Rhabarb, and sometimes Pseudo-Rhabarbe.

Hydrolapathum is twofold, great and small, both like the precedent, which grow
only in fenny and watery places.

Oxylapathum grows copiously in incultivated places, with a long and crasse
root, flave within, and croceous without; a bicubitall and brachiated surcle;
green and broad seed, depending on very minute pedicles and involved in thin
membranes of a yellow color.

Some call Sanguineous or maculated Lapathum very inconsiderately Dragons
blood, as we shall show in its place.

Sorrel is a kind of Lapathum, as also that herb, which some, upon what
grounds I know not, call slow Henry, which I think is a spinaceous wild
Pot-hearb.

CHAP. XIII. Of Hepatica, Hepatorium, and Eupatorium, or Agrimony.
PErite Herbalists do thus distinguish of Hepatica, Hepatorium, and
Eupatorium. Hepatica, is liver-wort; Hepatorium, is the vulgar Eupatorium; and
the true Eupatorium, is Agrimony: these three, being accommodated to the
roboration and cure of the Liver, are frequently and rightly called Eupatoryes.

Hepatica is often called Lichen either because it is the best remedy against
Ring Worms, Liver-wort
or else because it lickes stones, its leaf is succulent and craffe adhaering
to a moist and umbrous Rock, under which little caulicles in form of pedicles
emitt stellated heads, it is abstersive, refrigerative.

Hepatorium does from its root which is of a moderate magnitude exert
bicubitall and ramous surcles, Hempe-like Agrimony.
circumvested with long Canhabine leafes, serrated about; with small, muscous
and ruddy flowers, which having coronated its fair umbell, wither and turn
into pappe or down.

Eupatorium or Agrimony, is a fruticous plant very like Wildtansey, but that
its leaves are more virid, divided into more parts, and more serrated and
hirsute; its caul is slender, straight, cubitall and pilous; out of several
parts whereof small luteous flowers emerge, whereunto small seeds sharp on one
side, whereby they adheaere to woollen clothes, do succeed. Agrimony, was called
Eupatorium from Eupator its inventer, it attenuates, expurges, and peculiarly
helps the Liver and other bowels.

Mesue (which I would not omit) usurpes another herb which is cubitall and
very amare, with leafes like the lesser Centory, sharp and serrated about, for
Eupatorium; we call that Herb the Herb Julia, the Greeks call it Ageratum.

CHAP. XIIII. Of Primerose.
THe various denominations of this vulgar herb have obscured its dignotion;
for I find it called, Primiveria, Primerose, St. Peter's herb, the Paraliticall
and Arthriticall herb, Phlomis; Brachula Caculi, Tusculane violer, white
Betony, and petty Mullein, but let the inane investigation of the nomenclature
be omitted seeing the thing it self is perspicuous. It is called primula veris,
or Primerose, because it flourishs and germinates as soon as the very spring
approaches: there are three general differences thereof, the hortensian,
pratensian, and nemorall; the hortensian or garden Primerose is either simple,
or multiflorous, both their flowers are either green or luteously pallid; they
that grow in Meadows and Woods are alike as to leafes, dissimilar in flowers,
for the pratensian flowers are croceous, small, and almost inodorate, the
nemoralls pallid more patulous and odorate.

Primerose is multifolious, whose leafes are rugose like Betony, but longer
broader and more pallid, out of whose center arise long and slender pillars, in
whose summities three four or five subluteous and pensile flowers whose
extremities are denticulated, do dehisce, sometimes one only flower grows upon
an exile pedicle.

I have noted six varietyes differenced by the color of their flowers, for
some are herbaceous green and elegant, others white and vetust; some red;
others aureous, and others subflave; besides some are only coronated with a
simple flower, Paralysis.
others are so prolifically multiflorous, that one flower seems to grow out of
another, that which produces a simple and luteous flower, grows copiously and
spontaneously, in many places in the lower Neustria, especially in the
Vallonian field, where many rare Plants make their provent.

It helps much in paralyticall and arthriticall dolours. Vires.


The decoction of its root will expediate from the infarctures of the Reins,
protrude Sand, and expel the stones of the bladder.

CHAP. XV. Of Cabbage or Garden Colewort.
CAbbage which the Greeks call Crambe; is so vulgar that it were supervacaneous
with much labor to prosecute its designation; seeing it is sown, planted, and
cultivated in every Nation and place for esure: yet all its kinds do not
flourish in every Region, but some require this, others that soil, whence some
are called Sabaudae, because they delight most in that Tract, which are
patulous, not occluse, green without, and white within; others marine, because
they grow spontaneously in maritimous soyles; others Cauliflowers, and Italian
Cabbages, which grow only in Italy, or spring from Italian seed; others vulgar
which fruticate plenteously in all places; others Caulorape, which are
turbinated from the middle of the caul upwards, and Bulbous.

Furthermore many varieties may be desumed from the conglomeration, incisure,
plainness, laevity, asperity, whiteness, viridity, rubeding, and obscurity
of their leafes; as also from their crisped, racemous, laciniated or sessile
heads, which are rather for looks then Apothecaryes, except the Sea Cabbage
which is altogether medicamentall.

Cabbage generates crasse and melancholicall succe, Vires.
and is thought to inebriate the head, whence the Germans do so much desire
it; the red one is pectorall, and praeferred before the rest in confecting
ecclegmes.

CHAP. XVI. Of Flebane.
PSyllium is a pulicary herb so called from the effigies of its seed, it
grows in fallow ground and ditches, with long angust and hirsute leafes like
Crowfoot, its Corn begins at the middle of its caul, with spicated heads
cohaereing like scales, at the foot of the leafes, out of which small, pallid,
and lanuginous flowers, erupt; whereunto small black and splendent seeds
succeed, which clemently mollify and subduce the belly.

It is refrigerative in the second degree, Vires.
and symmetricall as to humectation and siccation according to Galen.
Dioscorides and Pliny also affirm that it is thus refrigerative; so that I
cannot but admire that Mesue should say that it is endued with a sharp
ulcerative and poisonous quality, but I believe, he praecipitantly wrote this
from the relation of some other man, or else excerped it out of some lying
book, or rather that some changed what he wrote most truly: its quality and
use is more safe then Mesue his writeings do patifie.

CHAP. XVII. Of Tussilage or Coltsfoot.
THe Romans call this Plant Tussilago, the Greeks Bechion, from that speedy
help and utility it affords the Coughers and annelant: Apothecaryes call it
Coltsfoot, because its leafes do a little resemble a horses hoof; the
inferior part whereof is tomentous and white, the superior green.

Its caul is so short, scarce aequalling a palm in length, that some thought
it grew without a caul; its flower is luteous, rudiated, and aureous like Sow
thistles flowers which erupts in February or March before the egression of its
leafes, which standing a few days dehisces into dawn, its root is slender,
white, and geniculated, delighting in moist places and River brinkes. Vires.


Its faculty has respect unto cough and anhelations; it is also credited that
its fume in a Tobacco-Pipe will break an imposthume in the breast.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Hops.
THere is a scansory Plant, which creepes up to the summityes of Trees, which
we call Hop-Tree.

It grows spontaneously in Hedges and Meadow sides with sharp leafes like
Cucumber, or triangular like Briony; wherewith it encompasses shrubs; its
flowers are subalbid, herbaceous, compacted of many folicles, scale-wise
disposed, and racemously pendent, wherein a small seed is contained; the
Belgians much estimate this fruit, for with this and their fruits they make up
their drink, as we do our Beer: its tender branches, in the beginning of the
spring cocted may be eaten with butter or oil and vinegar like Sperage or
sallets.

It refrigerates moderately, moves Choler, Vires.
diduces the passages, removes obstructions, moves urine, cures the Jaundice,
exacts Phlegm and hydropicall humors; and allayes the heat of the Stomach.

CHAP. XIX. Of Bistort.
BIstort is so denominated from its intorted and convolved radicles; some take
it for Dragon-wort, others for wild Beat; some say; but without ground or
reason, that it is the Arabian Bean; others more tolerably call it Britannica;
of whose family we constitute it; for it differs from it only in the color of
its root; for they are both very like in form and faculties. Britannica does
with a peculiar faculty respect, stomacate and sceletyrbe, which maladyes much
molest the Germans, and Septentrionall incolists; the like whereof happened upon
Caesar's Soldiers when they came beyond Rhene, who there finding a River, drunk
of ^he water, which within two days caused their ^eeth to fall out, and
resolved the joints of their knees, but the herb Britannica well help such as
are thus infested.

Bistort does from its nodose, intorted and rubescent root, emit long, broad,
acuminated and venous leafes, green above, and somewhat white beneath; round
cubitall or shorter caules, circumvested with little leafes from the middle
upwards, and adorned with purpueous flowers, its seed is small and triangular
like that of Sorrel.

Its root is most used in Pharmacy; Vires.
which is inodorate, refrigerative, and astrictive; it roborates the
internalls, exarceates puitetude, resists poison, and cures pestilent diseases.

CHAP. XX. Of the Strawberry-Bush.
FRagaria is perpetually green, never devoid of leafes, it depends upon no
Caul, only its radicles emit slender and lanuginous pedicles, some whereof
bear only leafes, others flowers and fine leafes, others like fibers creep
along the ground, and germinate; for where ever they touch ground, there they
radicate, and ministrate a new Plant; there are three, oblong, broad, serrated
leafes like them of Cinquefoile; on each pedicle, an herbaceous lump erupts
after the occasion of the flowers, which augments by little and little, and
becomes white, when it attaines maturity it is red, like a Mulberry; it is
candid, soft, medullous, vinose, humid, grateful and sweet to the gust,
referted with minute grains, which we call Strawberries.

Its root is fibrous, capillated and blackish; neither it nor the leafes of
this Plant are much celebrated for Medicinal uses; though it accede the
confection of the Martian unguent; for the commendable quality of this whole
Plant, is in its fruit, as of Rose-trees in their flowers, Mulabathrum in its
leaf, and Ginger in its root: it grows spontaneously in Woods and umbrous
places but flourishes more in Gardens, and bears greater and sweeter berryes.

Strawberryes refrigerate, Vires.
quench thirst, and nourish the body for a while, their water destilled,
deleates the spots of the face, expurges it, and makes it fairer.

CHAP. XXI. Of Cinquefoile.
THis herb is so denominated from the number of its leafes; it emitts from one
root many, pedall, festucaceous surcles, with luteous and fugaceous flowers on
their summityes, like them of wild Tansey; each pedicle bears five ^oblong
flowers crenated about like a Saw, the whole Plant is somewhat hirsute and
whitish, its root long, blackish without and ruddy within; it grows
spontaneously about the margins of fields.

There is another sort of Cinquefoile, with great crenated leafes, green above,
and white and lanuginous below; there is a third also which is reptile, whose
branches are slender and imbecill; leafes smooth and green; flowers luteous;
and roots fibrous and exile: another sort grows in stagnant places, in leafes
and magnitude very like the first with double darkly red flowers, which grow
upon an head referted with many seeds.

Cinquefoile (whose root is most in use) allayes the inflammation of the jaws
and asper artery, Vires.
it stays the belly flux and dysentery; in drink it cures the dolours of the
hips and junctures, cures biles and scabs, discusses cowles on the neck,
cohibites pimples, represses watery swellings; the succe of its root while young
and tender, is good against the affections of the Liver and Lungs.

CHAP. XXII. Of Goosse-grasse or Cleavers.
GOosegrasse has either soft surcles and leafes, and is called Mellugo; or
sharp ones, and is called Asperugo, or Spargula and Asperula; for the whole
Plant adhaeres to the Clothes of such as pass by, through its tenacious
asperity; whence the Greeks call it Philanthropon and Philadelphon, Pliny
Lappago.

Goosegrasse is a Plant growing besides hedges, ditches, and amongst thorns,
adhaereing to vicine shrubs; with imbecill, obsequious, quadrangular surcles of
many cubits length; with angust leafes decussated like Stars, and orbicularly
cohaereing to the genicles of its surcles, as in Ruby to which it is very like:
its flower is small and white; its seed hard, white, round, concave, in form
of a navil; whence some call it Omphalocarpon.

Goosegrasse is moderately extersive and desiccative, the succe of the whole
Plant drunk in Wine, auxiliates against the biteings of Spiders and Vipers; the
Plant infused therein cures the ears aches, Vires.
its leafes brayed and collected in Wine-Lees discuss swellings in the neck.

Gallion is very like Spargula, or Mollugo, which is often put into milk to
co-agulate it.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Scabiose.
SInce this Plant is neither that which Dioscorides calls Scrobe, nor that
which Aetius calls Psora, we cannot learn from the ancients what it is; however
it is a Plant which is now for its frequency and excellent effects very well
known: it bears long, broad, hirsute, and laciniated leafes, incided like
Rocket; its root is simple and long; its Caul half a foot high, in whose
summity grows a flower, made up of many leafes* whereof the circumambient are
larger, the middle lesser, all of them with their pedicles are whitish,

There is another Scabiose called the lesser Scabiose scarce a hand high, which
in flower, leafes, and color responds to the former; a third also of a middle
magnitude called Ovilla, whose leafes are more broad, long, hirsute and
crenated about; and a fourth not very unlike the first, whose Caules are
cubitall and folious, with caeruleously white flowers on their summityes.

Scabiose, it is believed, will cure the Scab, it purges the Lungs, cures the
Cough and other pectorall affections, as also pestilent diseases: some think it
is cold, others temperate, and exuberant in no quality.

CHAP. XXIIII. Of the Cotton-Tree or Plant.
GOssipium or Xylon, vulgarly called Bombay, is a cubitall, ramous and
brachiated Plant, with leafes like the Vine-Tree, but lesser; luteous flowers,
which leave little Nutts behind them or rather small Apples of the magnitude of
round Aristolochy; which drawing to maturity spontaneously dehisce, and give
free passage, to a certain soft, white dawen conceived and kept within them,
together with copious seed like that of Cubebs, turgid with white pitch within,
and black without: this dawen is of much use to men; the seed is only
Medicinal. Gossipium, which the Barbarians and Arabians call Gotum, grows in
Sicily, and many moist places in Italy, and Germany, exposed to the Sun.

The Cotton-seed helps the tussient, Vires.
anhelant, and rabid; cureing many vices of the Lungs, Liver and Reins; its
oil extracted by expression, deleates the pimples and pustuls of ones face.

CHAP. XXV. Of Hispidula or Aeluropus, commonly called Catts-foot.
MAny Plants mutuate their denominations from some parts of animalls which they
resemble, thus we have, Hares-foot, Crow-foot, Lyons-foot, Calfes-foot, or
Aron, Coltsfoot, and Cats-foot, which from its tomentitious dawen, is sometimes
called Pilosella, sometimes Gnaphalium, and often Hispidula.

It is a very small Plant, with slender branches, growing in Hills and dry
places exposed to the Sun; it emitts pedall caulicles, with small leafes,
pretty red, and sometimes white flowers; all are lanuginous: yea the whole Plant
seems to the tact and sight nothing but dawen; especially its flower which by
its tomentitious hair wherewith it is vested, resembles a Catts foot, whence
it got its denomination.

It is reposed amongst those that refrigerate moderately, and astringe and
agglutinate efficaciously, Vires.
and therefore it is a good vulnerary: white is most used in ruptures and
openings of vessels, and affections of Lungs, which are caused by imbecility
or too much laxity, and impotency to contain blood,

The more recent have made a syrup thereof, which they call syrope of
Catts-foot, which they find and experience salubrious to pectorall vices, we
have given its description in our Antidotary.

CHAP. XXVI. Of Melilote.
THere are many kinds of trifoiles, whereunto the whole family of Melilotes are
referred; for all of them have leafes, disjoined by three divisures, all of
them grow in one place, and participate of the same effigies; there are three
sorts of Melilote, the first is the vulgar, which in France grows amongst
segetives; the second more rare, which bears white flowers, with leafes and
surcles like the former; the third most rare because peregrine, whose flowers
are purpureous, sometimes caeruleous and elegant; it grows copiously in Syria.

The vulgar, which it is probable the Romans mean by their Sertula, disperges
many, pedall, and slender caulicles; leafes disterminated with three incisures
like Trifoyle, or rather Faenugreeke somewhat fimbriated in their ambient, with
luteous flowers like Pease-bloomes, coacted acervately in the form of a spike;
after whose occase short, broad, and blackish cods do erupt, turgid with small
and pallid seed; some call it odorate trifoyle, others Cotona regia, some Serta
and Sertula Campana.

Melilote seems to be indifferent, Vires.
as to either refrigeration or calefaction, but it is manifestly astrictive; it
allayes all inflammations, especially those of the Womb and Fundament if it be
decocted and sod-wine, and applied by way of liniment; it is peculiarly
efficacious against a scald head, its succe instilled into the ear with sod
wine cures its dolours, and allayes headache, if it be applied with Rose Water.

CHAP. XXVII. Of Line.
LIne denotes both the Plant and its Seed; the Plant and its bark compose the
texture of Linnen-Cloath, the seed and its medulla compose medicaments; It is a
Plant with exile and cubitall caulicles; long and acute leafes; caeruleous, and
specious flowers; after whose occase which is speedy, small heads, gravidated
with yellow, long, smooth and splendent seed, do erupt; it is not enumerated
amongst esculents in France, and those regions where it grows plenteously;
though the rusticks in Asia, brayed it, put honey to it, and fried it
frequently for their repast: however it be praepared, it is neither pleasant
nor salubre, for it is averse to the stomach; and therefore we sow it for
vestiments and medicaments, and not for Aliments.

Line and Faenugreeke have the same Faculties; it discusses and allayes
inflammations whether within or without, its decoction cures the erosion of the
matrix, and moves the belly; the oil expressed out of its seed mitigates,
mollifyes, deleates pimples, and emends the vices of the skin.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Faenugreeke.
Faenugreeke is a siliquous Plant emerging at first with one only Caul, which
is afterward brachiated into many boughs and wings, its Leafes are like them of
the Meadow trifoile, but rounder, lesser, more green above and subcineritious
underneath, its flowers are small and whitish, after which arise long Cods
crooked like Cornicles, wherein flave and angulous seeds like small Pease are
contained, Hippocrates calls this Plant Epicetus, Theophrastus, Buceras; and
Dioscorides, Tellis.

Faenugreek is emollitive and discussive, Vires.
subacted with Vinegar and nitre it minuates the Spleen, mitigates heat with
its lentour, made into a pultise with oxymel, it cures the podagry. Galen says
that it irritates fervent inflammations, but cures such as are less hott and
more hard; its sapour and odor denunciate it calefactive though we refer it
to that rank that is refrigerative or rather temperate.

CHAP. XXIX. Of Red Cicers.
MAny kinds of Pulse three are; some whereof are alimental, as Pease and
Beans; others medicamentall as vetches, whereof there are many sorts, for some
are sative, others wild; the sative seems to be the same with Arietinus, which
Dioscorides describes only nominally; whereof there is great plenty in Italy,
which they there use not only in medicine, but in meats also, it bears leafes
like Pease leafes, but lesser, with purpureous flowers, round cods, praegnant
with many grains: some places produce only white vetches which arewheseof if
we look at much eaten; others only black, or darkely purpureous, which are the
best and most celebrated in Pharmacy.

There is another sort of vetches which are wild, Vires.
which in seeds differ little from the sative, but in leafes much: both sorts
open the passages of the Reins, expel flowers and birth; augment milk,
exterge, cause flatuosity, and excite stiffenesse in the yard.

CHAP. XXX. Of Orobus or the bitter-Vetch,
THat which the Apothecaryes call Orobus, the Greeks call Ervum: it is a kind
of pulse-like Vetches, growing in macilent places wherein it delights more then
in fat soil, for there it is more speedily corrupted; there are two varietyes
thereof, the one is white, sweet and less vulgar; the other yellow, which may
be had in any Pharmacopoly; both according to Dioscorides are well known to
all, though many take wild Vetches, or Eruile which infest Corn, for the true
Orobus.

But the domestic Orobus is sown and cultivated, it assurges with a cubitall
or longer culme, geniculated, incurvated, concave, and a little striated, with
leafes and flowers like Vetches, round Cods grow upon its surcles, protuberant
with three or four grains disjoined with no membrane.

It desiccates manifestly, but calefies so gently, Vires.
that it seems to be temperate, it incides, exterges, removes and resolves
obstructions; it is seldom or never introsumed, frequently adhibited; for its
seed ingredes salves very frequently.

CHAP. XXXI. Of Lupines.
LUpine seems to be a kind of Bean; for its Caul is straight, erect, Cave,
somewhat tomentitious like a Beans culme, only it is round. Its singular and
fibrous root emitts a Caul (...) branches alternately posited, with leafes
qinquefariously dissected like them of Staves-acre, with white flowers thrice
erupting betwixt the beginning of Summer and Autumn; after which; Cods lesser
and plainer then Bean Cods emerge, each of them containing five or six round,
compressed, and amate grains, white without and subluteous within.

Lupines are macerated for many days space in water till they demitt their
amaritude, and then cocted before they be eaten, if they be illited or eaten
with honey, or drunk in Posca they kill Worms; their decoction cures Morpheus,
scurfes, scabs, manginesse, and malignant ulcers, partly by digesting, partly
by exterging and drying them without mordacity; cocted in Vinegar they discuss
biles in the Neck, and imposthumes distilling from the head to the eyes, and
makes the color of skarres candid and white: though their amarity demonstrates
that they are calid, nevertheless, they are justly reposed in this Section.

CHAP. XXXII. Of Barley.
AS Barley is of cereals most useful, so most notorious, whe^eof if we look at
the time of its sature we have two sorts, one autumnall whose straw, spike, and
grains are greater, the other vernall, which in all parts is less; the spike
of each is circumvalled with beards and small leafes wherein is contained an
oblong aequilaterall, and medullous grain.

Both the sorts of Spelt are referred to the family of Barleys, some call these
segetives by the name soucrion vulgarly scourgeon which denotes its utility in
succouring Nations; as also another kind of segetive which some call Zeopyrum,
others bare Barley, which grows in Cappadocia: yea many reduce yet more
cereals to this segetive, as Olyra, Typha, Brisa, Eteocrithon, and Oryza which
they call distich Barley. India long ago produced a kind of Barley, grateful
and salubre to man, but deletery to horses: for the same given to Alexanders
Horses to eat, killed them at first; but mixing chafe with it, it became
innoxious. Another sort grows in Thracia, about Gedropolis which beasts would
not touch; the cause whereof Theophrastus attributes to its ill odor, though a
man cannot perceive it, when it is denudated of its shel; they call it
Exasticum and Cantherinum.

Common Barley refrigerates and exsiccates, Vires.
being a little detersive, and hence Barley-bread stays not long in the belly,
nor yet gives much of nutriment; its flatuosity is deposed by elixation, and
therefore Hippocrates would have it done in a Ptisane, that it may be longer
cocted.

CHAP. XXXIII. Of Rhus or Sumack.
RHus it both the Latin and Greek name of a shrub, and also of a fruit,
whereunto Cooks add obsoniorum, because it was frequently used in Kitchins and
obsonies for Salt of old; but now it is only dedicated to Pharmacy, the
Mauritanians call it Sumach.

It is an arbuscle growing and fruticating most copiously in petrous places,
its Caul assurges three, four and sometimes five Cubits high, it is
discriminated with many small boughs; its leafes, whose middle nerve or cost
is red, cohaere in clusters like ashseafes, each whereof, is oblong, late,
serrated about, whitish; it emitts candicant flowers in July, which are
racemously congested like them of Lillax; its small fruit with the seed which
is small and red like that of Lentills, is mature in autumn, it is called Rhus
coriaria, because it has an excellent faculty in condensing hides; as also
another Plant, thence called Corinus coriaria, which may be enumerated amongst
the species of Rhus.

Sumach being very austere is astrictive and desiccative, it cohibites
dysenteryes and fluxions, stays women's flowers, Vires.
and allayes the hemorrhoids, its leafes and fruit are exceedingly astrictive,
they are dry in the third, and cold in the second degree.

CHAP. XXXIIII. Of Myrtle.
MYrtle is either silvestrian, which grows and fruticates spontaneously in
many hot regions, and incultivated places, or domestic which requires culture,
whereof there are two sorts, the one lesser like Box-Tree, only its leafes are
more acute like broom leafes, its berryes are black like Ivy; and it is
gravidated with vincous succe, whence it is often called black Myrtle, it is much
celebrated for its gracious odor and perpetually florid color, and diligently
nourished in Gardens, and transplanted in figuline pots into houses windows,
and there custodited for delight and ornament.

There is a lesser sort called white Myrtle, which bears broader and longer
leafes, then the former, whose color is not so obscure, but whitish whence it
is cognominated; by culture it sometimes assurges to the altitude of a moderate
Tree, as we may see in some maritimous Gardens, both Myrtles emitt white and
suaveolent flowers, out of which by due art a very fragrant stillatitious water
may be extracted.

There grows about the Caul of Myrtle an unaequall, concolorate lump, which
like a hand amplects its boughs. Dioscorides calls it Myrtidanum, but it is of
no use, and therefore neither bought not sold.

There is also another small wild Myrtle, which delights in sylvous, dry,
macilent, and a prique places, beareing black, edible, and sweet berryes which
many call Vaccinia, others give it ^^ctitious names at will: in Normandy the
vulgarity of Aethiopians that are called Mores, do from their blackness call
them Morets.

Myrtle consists of contrary substances, the frigid praevailing over the calid,
but participating much of tenuious calour; therefore according to Galen it
desiccates so efficaciously.

Both its fruit and leafes may be successefully either assumed or adhibited;
Vires.
and it being astrictive, stays excretions of blood, and bridles other
profluent humors; their decoction helps laxated members, and broken bones that
cannot endure ferrumination; many more commodityes does Myrtle pollicitate,
whereof see Dioscorides ( C. 156. L. 1.)

CHAP. XXXV. Of Millfolle or Yarrow.
MAny Plants do from the multiplicity of their Leafes and their multifarious
incisures assume the name of Millefoiles, as Achillea, Osyris, and water
Strathiotes which is like Houseleek growing only in Egypt according to Pliny:
as also Strathiotes, Chyliophyllum, and Myriophyllum, of which Dioscorides
treats in two several Chapters.

White leafed Milfoile has a short caulicle, with leafes like the wings of
young birds, in brevity and ruggedness like wild Cumin, small white flowers
upon a dense umbell like Dill, it grows by highways in places not ploughed.

It is very useful according to Dioscorides for inveterate and fresh ulcers,
Vires.
for issues of blood and fistulaes: whence the rusticks call it Carpentary or
Carpenters herb, some call it Soldiers hea^^.

The sweet leafed M^^f^ile emits one slender Caul, out of one root, with
innumerable, small, capillaceous leafes like fennel, its surcle is variously
delineated as if it had been so wrought by art; it grows in meadowish, moist
and fenny places.

It is astrictive, exsiccatory and vulnerary; for it very much accelerates the
cure and closure of wounds, drying, glutinating and vindicating them from
inflammations; it is good also in cureing ulcers; it stenches blood specially.

CHAP. XXXVI. Of Tamarisk.
THey put an indignity upon Tamarisk that call it a shrub, seeing it assurges
to a notable procerity, and acquires so much of crasstude, that cups and other
vessels for the use of the spleenatick may be made of its trunk and boughs:
yea, if we believe Columella, Troughs have been excavated out of its trunks and
filled with water that Hoggs might epote it, and so liberate themselves from
the augmentation of the spleen, wherewith they frequently labor.

Tamarisk emits very many boughs, which are vested with frequent, exile,
tenuious, round leafes exasperated as it were in their superficies with
transverse and oblique lines, without incisures, its flowers are many mossy,
tomentitious, white or somewhat purpureous occupying the summityes of its
surcles, and at length evolating in dawen, its root is lignous and crasse, as
the Tamarisk is in age.

Tamarisks are of two sorts, the one wild and sterile, which grows in many
Woods, the other domestic, very like the former in effigies and faculties,
which bears some seeds.

It is abstersive and incisive without any manifest desiccation; it is also
somewhat astrictive, Vires.
yet it admirably and by a special property helps an inducated, obstructed,
and imbe^ill spleen, tures all affections proceeding from crasse and
Melancholicall humors.

SECT. VI. Of Fruits.
WE have sufficiently in a former Section treated of Stalks, Roots, Branches,
Boughs, Woods, Barks, Leaves, and Flowers, or at least of so many as concur to
be composition of Medicaments. It remains now that we treat of Fruits, both
Alimentall, and Medicamentall, which an Apothecaryes shop cannot be without,
and in their enumeration, we shall first touch upon those that excel others in
dignity, s^avity, utility and magnitude; so that we shall take our exordium
from Apples, by the Greeks called Mela.

CHAP. I. Of Apples.
THere are so many varietyes of Apples that they can scarce be named much less
here enumerated: for besides those which the Earth produces, many are variously
immuted by incision, miscellany, and mangony; for art cicurates the wild,
allayes the acerb, dulcescates the acid, incrassates the small, flavescates the
red, and changes many more colors.

And though Apple Trees be pomigerous every where, yet in Normandy, they are
more faecund, beareing better, more grateful, and salubrious Apples for the
confection of Cider then elsewhere; whereof, as of Wine, there are many sorts,
the best whereof is that that is made of Skarlet Grapes, which in sapour,
suavity, and goodness aequalizes generous Wine.

Apples are well known to all Nations, whose culinary uses are frequent, and
officinary no less celebrous: for their succe ingredes the confecture of
Alkernesse, and conditure of King Sapors syrup, as also their substance, the
unguent Pomatum.

Now we comprehend under this general name, all odorate fruits of an
herbaceous green color which have no lignous pills, as all curtipendulous
Apples, rambures, and the like; on the contrary we call all them nuts, whose
external shell is Lignous and hard as Pistacks, Nuts and Almonds. Quinces,
Apricocks, and Peaches also come under the name of Apples; as also many other
Fruits.

Those are the best, sweetest and most fragrant which the vulgar Normans call
Gulorogeria, Passipoma, Calvillea, Paradisiana, Rubelliana, Reneta,
Curtipendula, and many more which for their salubrity, suaveolence and sweet
sapour, are much used of such as live deliciously.

The Septentrionall incolists have yet incredible varietyes of Apples; which
being either amare, or acid, or austere, or dulco-acid or dulco-amare, are
after they have attained their perfect magnitude congested in Storehouses that
they may maturescate, and then they are contunded in a Trough, committed to a
Press, and their copious succe expressed, and reconded in a hogs-head, where
it keeps long without corruption, and serves them for familiar drink, which
from its Citrian color they call Citre, corruptly Cider.

Sweet Apples are temperate; acid ones colder, as also austere ones, amare ones
hotter. All of them almost mollify the belly, Vires.
especially the sweet ones, they contemperate bilious and melancholicall
humors.

CHAP. II. Of Pears.
THe Pyre or Peare-Tree so called from its Pyramidall turbinated effigies, is
well known to all; for all Gardens and Orchards luxuriate therewith, yet their
fruit is very expetible; for Pears are so grateful to eat, that many
praeferre them before all other edibles.

Whereof there are so many varietyes in color, sapour, magnitude and form,
that none are able to enumerate them: the Ancients cognominated some small and
swift, which it is probable we now call suaveolent and Summer Pears, from
their gracious sapour representing Musk, or Honey rather, which being the least
of all, grow five, six, or more on a cluster, depending upon prolix pedicles,
which come first to maturity.

The Lutetians commend the rosea so called from their color, the bicipita,
sufficiently conspicuous by their magnitude, Callotia Sertelia, Dagobertina,
Fusca, Bergamotia, and Donchristiana which are the sweetest of all, and are
frequent in the Turonian and Metensian fields, as also in all France.

Some are also commended and celebrated for their magnitude, as those they call
Liberalia, and some other crasse ones, which being first brought from Rhodes,
are nominated Rhodensia; there are many more of firmer substance, which are
eaten more frequently when cocted, then when crude, which are not ripe till the
beginning of Winter.

In the Country they exsiccate Pears in an Oven, and keep them till Lent, or
coct them in new Wine, or stuff them with Cloves, and condite them in Sugar,
and keep them for junkets and obsonyes.

Pears are more or less astrictive, Vires.
as their sapour is less or more sweet: as they are more grateful, so more
salubrious after decoction, for being crude they load the Stomach.

CHAP. III. Of Limmons, Citrons.
CItrons are not so much called medicall Apples from Medus, as from their
medicall qualityes, for their odor, pill, flesh, pulpe, succe, grains, and all
are eximiously medicinal: here of, there are three differences, the first is
called a Limmon which is turbinated with an oblong effigies, is colorated
herbaceously, and turgid with a more acid acerb and frigid succe, corticated
with a thinner pill, and not so amare as an Orange: the second is the more
vulgar Citron, very like the former, but its color is more luteous, its pill
more crasse, rugous and caperated, and it self more crasse, odorate,
medicative and convenient for antidotes: the third is greatest called
Pom-Citron, orbiculated like a melon, with a thick carnous pill, sometimes
aequalling a man's nail in crassitude, with a concolorated superficies, which
we call Poncerium, Citroniatum, Assyrian Apple, and Adams Apple, all which
names seem to be deflected from the Tree, and as they are alike in Idea, so
also in facultyes.

As them of the third sort which we call Ponoeria superate the rest in
magnitude, so does the first which we call Lina in parvity: for it scarce
aequalises an egg in magnitude, yea most of that sort when they have attained
their perfect growth, are no whit crasser then Apricocks, some whereof are
oblong, others short and rotund, all suaveolent, vestited with a thin cortex,
salurated with much succe, of a dulco-acid and grateful sapour; they are very
copious and eximious in Italy, especially in the fields near Luca.

The Trees from which they are collected, are perpetually virid, Laurifolious,
and always pomiferous, for some are just erupting, others more adult, others
almost mature, and other deciduous, at all times on the same Tree.

All Limmons and Citrons refrigerate, arceate putretude, recreate the heart,
and resist Poisons, which Athenaeus proves, by an admirable History of two
sentenced offenders, who by the command of the Egyptian King, according to
their Laws were to be exposed a prey to Asps; each of them in their journey
received a Citron of an huckster, which condoled their condition; they are it,
who thereupon felt no pain, when they were bitt by those cruel Serpents: which
the judge admired, and seeking the cause, found that each of them had eaten a
Citron; the next day he commanded a Citron to be given to one of them, and not
to the other, they were again lead to their punnishment; he that had eaten the
Citron felt no molestation, the other being all over livid with biteings dyed.

CHAP. IIII. Of Orenges.
AUrenges or aureous Apples so called from their color, grow upon a Tree very
like the Limmon-Tree in effigies, for their colors, odours, flowers and leafes
are the same, only they differ a little in that part next the peduncle, which
in the Orange is as it were pinnated and double, they are dilutely green,
odorate and concolorate with the Limmon-Trees fruits: the Tree whereon they
grow is tall, ramous, perpetually virid, and daily pomiferous, some growing,
other falling, and others ripening, it bears flowers all the year, which are
white, elegant, suaveolent and more fragrant in Summer, then other times; some
whereof adhaere to a nodose pedicle and are faecund, others are enodous and
sterile. Aqua Naphae so much celebrated for its suavity and fragrance is
distilled from these, which Matrons and delicate Courtiers wash their faces,
hair, and hands with.

Great plenty of Orenges are carried from Spain, Italy, and France into other
regions, some whereof are sweet, and ungrateful or at least not pleasant to
the gust; others acid, jucund, cordial and grateful to the palate; all round,
nitent of a Golden color or very flave whence they are often called Golden
Apples.

The sweet ones are temperate, the acid ones refrigerate, arceate putretude,
resist Poisons, and corroborate; Vires.
their pills are acrimonious, amare and hot, which for their gracious odor are
used in sawces condited in Sugar, it emends the breath of ones mouth.

CHAP. V. Of Pomegranates.
THis Tree commonly called Granate, and its fruit Pomegranate derives its
denomination either from the multitude of grains wherewith it is referted, or
else from the region of Granata where it fruticates copiously; it delights in
hot air and dry ground, its leafes are like myrtle leafes, which fall off
annually, its flower is red, oblon^, jucund of aspect, and resembles a cup in
effigies, the vulgar call it Balaustium, though that name, in Dioscorides his
opinion, may rather be deduced to the wild ones.

There are two sorts of Pomegranate-Trees, the one wild, which is florigerous,
but withal infrugiferous, the other domestical, whereof there are three
differences, one bears acid Pomegranates, another sweet ones; and the third
dulco-acid ones, all of them are angulous and crasse, referted with many
grains, demerged in much juice.

Its cortex is called Malicore, and by some Sedion, it is viridly flave, like
vitriol, whereof according to Alcumists it participates; its flower is oblong,
purpureous and fait, which Pliny calls Balaustians.

The whole Pomegranate is astrictive and refrigerative, but its succe is endued
with the best facultyes, which recreates the heart, allayes the heat of the
stomach, and cures the Choleric passion; sweet Pomegranates molest the stomach.

CHAP. VI. Of Quinces.
QUinces grow upon a Tree, which they call Cotonea, or Catonea from M. Cato.
but the Graecians long ago called it Cydonea from Cydon a Town in Crete, where
it was first found: but I should rather believe that its name Colonea was given
to it because of its tomentitious cortex resembling Cotton, for these Apples
are vested with a certain dawen like Cotton dawen.

The Tree from which they are excerped is commonly low, assurgeing like a
shrub, vested with a sharp and gapeing Bark, produceing things like scales;
its boughs are many, short, tortuous and cineritious, its leafes subrotund,
mucronated, green above white beneath, soft and lanuginous; its flowers albid,
somewhat purpureous and quinquefolious; its fruits crasse, very flave,
tomentitious and odorate, emitting an odor jucund to some, ungrateful to
others; its sapour is alike to all; flesh luteous, succe austere; its seed as
in other Apples is included in membranes and reconded as it were in Caskets.

The Quince-Tree is fruitful in every place, but most in hot regions,
cultivated places and Garden sides, for then its fruits will be more, and
aureous; some whereof are rounder, shorter, lesser and nearer the figure of
vulgar Apples, which are called Quinces absolutely; others greater, crasser,
longer, turbinated and more like Pears vulgarly called Coignacea, which are
not so good as the former.

Some also are more candid, others strutheous, all more luteous and almost
aureous whence they are called Chrysomels or Golden Apples, such as are more
lanuginous, and by their fragrancy affect the heads of some men, make very many
eustomachicall medicaments as conserves, waters, and syrups of Quinces whereof
there is much use both in health and sickness.

Quinces can searce be eaten crude, when cocted they are more grateful to the
palate; Vires.
they roborate the ventricle, allay vomiting repress the flowers of the belly,
conduce to the dysenteriack and collicall, as also to such as either spit
blood, or are infested with an immoderate flux of flowers or haemorrhoids.

CHAP. VII. Of Medlers.
A Medler is a certain round Apple, at first green, and somewhat hispid;
afterward it is yellow, and soft: some call it Tigranum, and Galen calls it
Tricoccum, because it contains three lapideous, or osseous grains instead of
seeds, yet sometimes four and sometimes five are found in it, according to the
number of its unguicles issuing out of its patulous bosse or head: this fruit
is so acerb before maturity, that one cannot taste of it, but when mature, it is
grateful and wholesome for the last course.

The Tree from which it is decerped is of two sorts, one wild and spinous
growing spontaneously in Woods and Hedges, which bears small oblong Apples,
very acerb before maturity, and not very grateful after; the other
domestical, so made by culture and insition, whose Apples are more crasse and
full, though a little compressed, round, and gapeing on one side: both are
tortuous and rigid, but this is less spinous. Dioscorides calls it Setania,
Theophrastus Satanea.

It assurges to the magnitude of a vulgar Apple Tree, with boughs that are
hairy and circumgyred, promise, and not broad leafes; white and quinquefolious
nowers; whereunto Apples succeed called Medlers, which are of a moderate
magnitude, with late heads, discreted with five unguicles or leafes, its
substance is white, and sapour austere till maturity, and then it is yellow and
sweet.

Immature Medlers are acerb and astrictive, yet their Powder according to A^t.
Musa breaks and excludes stones in the Reins, Vires.
to which effect, their officles or seeds brayed and assumed, are thought most
conducible, they are commended for cohibiting belly flux, and roborating its
parts.

CHAP. VIII. Of Sorbe Apples.
SOrbes are small Apples, in quality like Medlers, in forms and magnitude very
dissimilar; for both at first are green, hard, acerb, unfit to eat; by maturity
yellow, soft, grateful to the palate, and turgid with a vinose succe.

Pliny makes four sorts of Sorbe Apples, some common and turbinated like Pears
which the rusticks call Cormae; others rounder like Apples, some oblong like
Olives, and others torminose; Dioscorides mentions only the pyroformious or
vulgar Sorbe Apples which are decerped in Autumn. Vires.


All Sorbe Apples are acerb and astrictive; and thence they conduce to the
staying of the dysentery and other fluxes, Vires.
the vulgar are most in use, which repress vomitings, stay the eruptions of
blood, and roborate the partst: here is a kind of drink expressed out of these
in a press, that is very like Perry, which the vulgarity much celebrate.

CHAP. IX. Of the fr^^ of the Cornell Tree.
COrna are oblong fruits of the magnitude of Roman beans, yet not plain but
round, red, praegnant with a white hard and offeous Kernel, of an austere
sapour with some acidity.

They grow on a Tree not very tall, vested with rigid bark; smooth, broad,
mucronated, venenate leafes, like them of the Spine Tree, it flourishes first
of all, bearing green fruits in Summer, and red in Autumn, it delights in
Mountains and Valleys, and grows frequently without culture; but it is
transplanted into many Gardens that its fruit may be in more readiness for
medicine.

There is another Thelycronius Cornell-Tree which Theophrastus calls the
faemale dogg-Tree, Cornus faemin:
which erects it self with a fungous Caul beareing ripe betryes in autumn,
which are very acerb, insuave, and disgustfull to all animalls.

All Cornell-Trees have two roots by internalls, and alternately respondent, as
in Vines; its bark is pallidly flave, the Wood of the male is so solid, that
in hardness it aequalises horns; its berryes are praegnantly turgid with red,
austere, and acid succe.

These fruits refrigerate, Vires.
desiccate and astringe; and therefore they are praescribed to the immoderate
flux of the belly, flowers, or haemorrhoides.

CHAP. X. Of Prunes.
I Have neither will nor power to prosecute all the varietyes of Prunes, let
herbalists and Carden-writers be sought, for their differences which are almost
inexplicable and innumerable so made by art and mangony: for if we look at
their color, some are herbaceous, others white, others eburneous, some
luteous, others flave, others purpureous, others black or violaceous, others
variegated, and others rubeous.

They are also differenced by their magnitude, figure, sapour, and place; for
some are small, or great, or indifferent; others of a round, of an ovall, or an
oblong figure; others acid, sweet, austere, dulco-acid, or otherwise mixed:
some are commended from their place, as Damascens, Brignalens, Rhemens, and
Turovians: we have now in our markets the best, and sweetest of all, which they
commonly call Pardigons, as also imperial plums, and red, black and violaceous
Damascens which they call Datta, which nobilitate the most delicate tables; and
enrich shops.

They are collected of Plum-Trees, which are sufficiently known to all,
especially the wild ones which grow spontaneously every where, which though
they be very low, and bear fruit not very svave, yet they be so changed by
culture and insertion; that they will assurge to an high-Tree, and yield sweet
Plums annually: but it is vain to dilucidate what is already most notorious.

Plums which the Greeks call Coccymela, the Siculians, Barbyla, Vires.
humectate, refrigerate, mollify and lubricate the belly: a certain Pulpe is
elected out of black Damascens to the confection of Diaprunum; they are dried
in an Oven and eaten with fish, or made into medicine, they are condited in
sugar for a junket.

CHAP. XI. Of Apricocks.
APricocks by their grateful odor and sweet sapour do much arride, and
nobilitate rich men's Tables, whether crude or condited; for their gracious
halit and jucund suavity allure the fullest stomachs to taste of their delicacy:
some would refer them to Plums, others to Peaches, but they seem to be a mean
betwixt both; sedulity of late has so acted that we have a kind of Plums in
sapour, form and magnitude partly resembling Plums, partly Apricocks which
they call Apricock Plums, the Ancients called them Armeniaca, Galen afterward
Precoccia, and the more recent now by the addition and mutation of some letters
Abricoecia.

They are gathered of a Tree, of a moderate magnitude, less then a Peare-Tree,
greater then a Peach-Tree, harder and more durable, it emitts a crasse caul,
many boughs not so long as them of the Peach-Tree, but more crasse, broad and
mucronated leafes like them of Peare-Tree, white flowers, which erupt at the
beginning of the Spring, before the leafes; round, carnose, succulent and
grateful fruit like Peaches, luteous both within and without.

Apricocks are judged humid in the second degree, Vires.
frigid in the first or rather temperate, as all sweet fruits; they lubricate
the belly, and are soon corrupted in an infirm body, especially if they be
immoderately ingested, they are celebrated for no use in medicine.

CHAP. XII. Of Peaches.
THe Peach-Tree is notorious and frequent in most places of France, for they
beset their Vineyards therewith; it assurges to a moderate procerity, emitting
long and fragile boughs, vested with rare leafes like Willowes, serrated about,
amare to the gust and aromatically redolent; its flowers are like them of
Almonds, but more dilutely purpureous.

Dioscorides says that in Persia they found this Tree to be exitious, which by
translation into Egypt changed its nature, and became innocuous, which also
Galen affirms; but Matthiolus contradicts them upon such light conjectures, as
he will never be able to infirmate or disprove the authority of such grave men
withal.

It bears abundance of Apples, which are obduced with white dawn, subluteous,
succulent, carnous, and variegated within and without, with certain red
strokes; they are sometimes all luteous, the color of the external Cortex,
shows the color of the internal Pulpe as red without, red within.

These Apples are rotund, but they have a small depressure on one side like a
rhyme: their succe according to Galen, is small as also their flesh, because
they are soon corrupted: therefore the syrup made of their succe, which some
celebrate much, is rather to be neglected then commended.

Peaches are cold and moist in the second degree, their succe is very
corruptible, Vires.
and they no good last dish; they are better before other meats then after.

Their Kernells are dry, they open, incide, exterge, and cure the infarctures
of the Liver or Milt.

Their amare Leafes, calefy, incide, liberate the intralls from obstructions,
subduce the belly, and move choler.

There is a good Hydragogall syrope, which also kills Worms, made of their
flowers.

CHAP. XIII. Of Cherryes.
THere are many varietyes of them; for some are wild, and those small, and
lougipendulous, which at first are green, afterward red and last black, the
French call them Merisia that is amare, others domestical which are much
lesser; some whereof are red, others black, others white, and others
albo-rubeous, wild Cherryes are the most untimely, ungrateful and least; some
whereof are plainly red, others black, next to these are other great, sugacious
and tender ones, which are so soft after maturity, that they cannot tolerate
carriage, some call them Guignea; some whereof are black, crasse, and
turbinated, which the ancients called Actia and Juliana; others obscurely, and
others dilutely red.

Those that some call Duracina, and the French Bigarella are sweetest, hardest
and most grateful to the palate, they resemble a heart in form; those they
call Aproniana superate the rest in salubrity, they are very red of color,
acid, and grateful to the gust.

Some yet are very sweet and wholesome to eat, which being perfectly mature, are
very crasse, round and darkly red, they are called Agriota; some are acid,
which are cognominated amar^na, others austere, Merona: all are very succulen,
except heart Chertyes, black and darkely red ones are very tender, and infect
the hands of the contrectants.

Cherryes suppeditate laudable succe to the body; they allay the heat of the
Stomach, subduce the belly, help such as are feverish, Vires.
contemperate bilious humors, liberate the Liver from infarctures, but some
work these effects more eximiously, others more slowly.

CHAP. XIIII. Of Mulberry-Trees.
THere are two sorts of Mulberry-Trees, the one black, which bears
black-berryes, the other white, which bears white ones, both tall, with flave
roots, crasse trunks, rough barks, and long, broad, serrated leafes like them
of Elder, whereon Silke-Wormes feed: but they spin the finest silk, when they
are fed with white Mulberry leafes, which are more grateful to them, an^
suppeditate more large and apt matter, for their Silke^ threads.

The fruits of black Mulberry, which the Apothecaryes commonly call Mora Celsi,
are sweet, and frequently nobilitate men's table out of whose succe both syrup
and Rob is confected, but their use is not now very frequent.

But the fruits of the white Mulberry-Trees are flatuous, ungrateful and unapt
for nutriment; so that the excel ency of this Tree consists not so much in its
fruits as leafes, whereon the aforesaid Worms feed and suppeditate excellent
Silken Cotton.

Mulberry-Trees germinate the latest of domestics, beginning only in May,
when the rigidity of Winter is aboslutely over; they fructify in July and
August, whose berryes are oblong, compacted of grains, like them of the wild
Mulberry-Tree, but longer crasser and greater, green at first, purpureous
afterward, and last of all black, and praegnant with red succe.

Immature Mulberryes are cold and dry toward the third degree, they astringe
potently, and allay the inflammations of the mouth and jaws; mature ones
humectate and refrigerate but a little; they quench thirst, provoke appetite,
and are not adverse to the ventricle, they nourish the body sparingly.

CHAP. XV. Of Wild Mulberryes, and Rasberryes.
RAsberry-bush is either wild, and spinous, which the Greeks call (...), or
domestic and cicurated, which growing more copiously in the Mount Ida is
called the Idaean bush, of which, as of the sylvestrian there are two sorts,
the one bears red, the other white fruit; both the wild ones bear fruit which
at first is green, then red, and at last black.

This bramble grows copiously in hedges, margins of fields and incultivated
places; its surcles are prolix, lent, obsequious, green somewhat quadrangular,
especially when inveterate, medullous with in, and aculeated without, with
leafes, incided about, green above, white beneath, sharp and spinous so far
as its fibers go, with white flowers digested on the summityes of its surcles,
whereunto fruits succeed, called black-berryes,

The Idaean bramble stands alone; and assurges straight up to a man's procerity,
with medullous surcles, exasperated with small not horrid spines; its leafes
and flowers are like the wild ones, and its fruits also, only they are either
rubeous or pallid and very grateful to the gust and olfact; we call them
Framboesia; Isuppose from the fragrant odor they represent to the eaters
mouth; that Wine is thought best that smells of Framboesia.

Wild Ras-berryes are astrictive, and very like the domestic Mulberryes in
qualities; for they repress the inflammations of the mouth and jaws, and
cohibite the flux of the belly: the Idaean also or white bryar possess the
same facultyes, but more infirmely, and they are more accommodated to esure
then medicinal uses.

CHAP. XVI. Of Sebestens or Myxarias.
SEbestens or Myxarias are fruits growing in Syria and Egypt upon a tall Tree
of the same name, like a Plum-Tree; the bark of its trunk is white, of its
boughs green; they are vested with subrotund, firm and ample leafes, white
flowers cobaereing racemously or rather on laxe umbels, which falling off,
fruits erupt very like Plums, which attaining maturity, are of a sad green
color, and contain an hard, osseous, and triangular Nut or Kernel.

Myxaries or Sebestens are gathered when mature, insolated, contracted into
wrinkles like Raisons or Prunes and kept, they were once very rare and
peregrine in Italy, but now they grow there copiously.

They mollify the belly like Plums, they allay Fevers, Coughs, and asperity of
the tongue, they cure stranguty and ardour, they quench thirst if duly assumed,
Vires.
and kill and expel Worms.

CHAP. XVII. Of Jujubs.
JUjubs which the Greeks, call Zizipha and Zinzipha, grow in Sy^ria, and now in
many places in Italy and Narbone, upon a small tree, like a Whin, with hard
spinose and spolious surcles; mossy flowers, its caul is contorted, rough and
ramous; its boughs slender, long, obsequious, but hard and protended like the
branches of Broom: its leafes hard, oblong, like them of Periwinkle,
alternately disposed at long intervalls; about which, small, mossy and pallid
flowers do erupt, after whose occase oblong, carnose, tender berryes of the
magnitude of Cherryes, vested with a membranous and hard cortex do accede,
Galen calls them Serica.

These luteous or luteously purpureous, sweet, carnose, vinous fruits, of the
figure and magnitude of moderate Olives, turgid with a stone, yellow without,
when they have attained maturity are gathered, dried, contracted into wrinkles
and kept.

We cannot learn from the Greeks and Arabians any thing of their qualities and
salubrity; for Galen says, they are ill for the stomach, they nourish little,
and are hard of concoction; the Arabians accommodate and commend them to many
uses, and though Fuchsius acerbly insult and speak against these, yet
Actudrius, Graecus, Nic. Alexandrinus, and many more, much celebrate their use,
having sufficiently experienced their salubrious effects.

They cure the Cough, difficulty of breathing, and the asperity of the Artery,
they concoct and expel humors, Vires.
cure many vices in the Lungs and Breast, help the reins and allay the ardour
of Urine, and dolor of the Bladder.

CHAP. XVIII. Of Figgs.
THe Fig Tree germinates every where, but in cold Countries it is either
sterile, or bears only gross and useless, or small and insuave fruits; which
never attain maturity; in hot, regions, it fruiticates copiously, fructifying
twice annually in the Spring and Authmne; it is a Tree of a moderate magnitude,
not assurging with a direct caul, nor yet a smooth bark, but somewhat rough,
especially when inveterate; its wood is white, soft and meoullous: its leafes
ample, quinquefariously disterminated, quinqueangular, rough, hard and
obscurely green: its fruits which are at first small and green, afterward
greater, and either white or red, with a turbinated figure, erupt about the
exortion of its leafes without any praevious flowers: and as some Figgs are
more forward and sweeter then others, so are some whiter, some redder, some
blacker then others; all are soft, medullous and gravidated with small grains,
while they are immature if they be vulnerated with the stalks or ends of
leafes, they will emitt a lacteous acrimonious and amare humor.

There is another low Fig Tree very like the former excepting procerity, which
grows in a prique places, and sometimes in Septentrionall regions.

Another wild and infaecund one, responds to these in effigies, which is
celebrated for no medicinal use.

There is also an Indian Fig Tree which some think is that same that Pliny
calls Opuntia, which is a Plant without boughs, without Caules consisting only
of leafes, which has not yet been experienced in medicinal uses.

The best Figs come from Massilia, which may be substituted in defect of
Dactyls, Vires.
they calefy moderately, nourish, lubricate the belly, but do not generate very
laudable blood; they attenuate, leviate, maturefy, concoct and profit the asper
artery, the reins, Lungs and Bladder; a dry Fig is called Carica; by the
Greeks, (...), by which word Matthiolus designs Apias. Fig Tree leafes move
baemorrhoids if the Fundament be rubbed therewith: the so much celebrated
Antidote, Mythridate, is made of Figgs, Rue and Nutts, whose composition we
have described in the History of Rue. Figgs are of much more utility, which for
brevity sake I will not recenseate; See Dioscorides (C. 183. and 184. Lib. 1.)

CHAP. XIX. Of Dactyls or Dates.
DActyls are the fruits of Palms growing in Egypt, Crete, and Judaea, which
attaining maturity are by Galen called Phaenicobalani; the best come from
Judaea, they are great, flave, somewhat rugous, soft, but carnous, subdure
within, white toward the Kernel, red toward the cortex, of a vinous sapour,
they sound little or nothing when concussed; the flaccid hard and macilent are
worse.

Now there is no small difference in Palms, Galen himself being Judge, for
some are dry and astrictive, as the Egyptian ones; others soft, humid and
sweet, as those we call Chariotae; but the best grow in Syria, Palestine, and
many Eastern regions, where they suppeditate both meat and drink to the
incolists.

The Trunk of a Palm is crasse, round, and high, rough with dense and gradate
notches, by the adjument of whose inaequality, the oriental incolists can
easily ascend their summityes; its leafes are Arundinaceous, long and
acuminated, many proceeding out of one exortion, according to the longitude of
the boughs; it bears much fruit on its summity, as it were racemously
cohaereing, but their pedicles are more prolix, whereof there are many sorts,
but the sweet and succulent ones such as grow in Judaea, Syria, and Palestine
are best: they are of a yellow or luteous color, neither great nor yet small;
the green, insuave, and juicelesse are naught.

Galen's judgment of the qualityes of the Palm, and its fruits is this: All
the parts of the Palm Tree, says he, participate of an astrictive faculty;
for the austere succe of its boughs, consists of an aqueous, tepid, terrene,
and frigid substance. But its sweet fruits have much of calidity: they profit
the stomach and breast, Vires.
suggest laudable nutriment, and are meat for many Nations.

CHAP. XX. Of Olives.
THat Olives, and their fat juice called oil, appertain to esculents, each one
knows: for Olives nobilitate rich men's Tables to excite appetite, and their
oil is usurped not only in confecting acetaryes, frying fishes, and
praepareing other meats, but also in confecting unguents and salves.

Now Olives are the fruit of a Tree of a moderate magnitude; which the French
call Olivetum; the Latins Olea, which, especially the sative, assurges with a
long Caul; for the wild one is lower, with many oblong boughs laterally
diffused, hard and pallidly virid like willow boughs, with white racemous
flowers, whereunto oblong, carnous, succulent berryes called Olives, at first
green, after black, with hard stones within, succeed: the fruit derives its
name from the Tree, and the succe from the fruit.

This Tree delights in dry places and hot regions, as in Spain, Italy, and
France; for it willingly amplects a hot squalid air; it either grows not at
all or else is sterile and tabid in the Septentrionall regions.

The Greeks call Olives drawing to maturity and blackness, (...), the French
Drupae; when they are condited with salt the Greeks call them (...) and (...):
oil simply so called is extracted from them when they are mature; Omphacinum,
when immature, but let herbalists be sought for larger treatises hereabout.

Immature Olives are astrictive, mature are temperate; when condited they
recrate the palate, excite appetite, resiccate and roborate the too humid
ventricle, nourish little, and yet not very laudable blood: we have else where
treated largely of oil, and its facultyes.

CHAP. XXI. Of Acerb Grapes and Raisons.
VIne is a name put upon many Plants, which agrees only properly to the
viniferous ones, for they call Viburn, the blessed Virgins Sigill, and other
tall Plants by this name; whereas the viniferous domestic is properly so
denominated, whereof there are many differences desumed from their sapour,
magnitude color, and state of the Heavens.

In a general acception all Vines are either white or black; but many are now
variegated of a mixed color, which are neither white nor black, but rather
subrubrous, or flave, whose Wines are neither absolutely white, nor red, nor
black, but mixed; flave, yellow and obscure according to the various colors of
the Grapes from which they are expressed.

And as all mature Grapes are sweet, so all immature ones are acerb and
insuave, whence Omphacium may be had out of any immature Grapes, though it be
most usually expressed out of such as are acid and more insuave when mature;
whose branches are crasser and longer; which are deduced commonly to arbor,
which bear crasse and acerb Grapes, whose succe goes to the confection of
Omphacium and syrup of Agresta.

Raisons are the mature fruits of the viniferous Vine, so called because they
have endured exsiccatory calour, they may also derive that name from their
sweetness as well as calour. As passum vinum or (...), (i.e.) sweet, so all
sorts of Raisons are sweet, except these of our Country, which dried in an
Oven are dulcoacid.

All of them are temperately hot in the first degree, and very astrictive if
they be eaten with their stones; and so they help the dysenterian: acerb Grapes
refrigerate and astringe.

CHAP. XXII. Of the Curran-Bush, and Gooseberry-Tree.
THe Curran-Tree is a fronticose Plant, scarce aculeated with any spines,
emitting many tortuous not erect boughs, and leafes like Vine leafes, but much
less; and fruits congested like Grapes small, round, red and acid.

The Mauritarians call these red Currants Riben, whence our Apothecaryes
borrowed their Ribes.

Botanicks constitute two sorts of this shrub, the one bearing red fruit which
is better; the other black, which is not celebrated for medicinal effects:
there is also a third that bears white and grateful fruit, some of the later
writers call the former Ribesium, and the other a species of the
Gooseberry-Tree, so making the berryes of the former red, of the later white:
but they differ much in effigies, color, sapour, and magnitude.

For the Gooseberry-Tree is a spinous shrub, luxuriating with many slender
white and aculeated boughs, broad crenated serrated leafes, whitish flowers,
and fruits not racemously cohaerent, but depending on long pedicles like
berryes, they are at first green, afterward white, and when mature flave.

Ribes refrigerate, siccate, astringe moderately and roborate; they extinguish
the heat of Fevers, repress choler, contemperate fervid blood, quench
thirst, arceate putretude, help in malign Fevers, in the subvertion of the
ventricle, and dysenteriall affections arising from heat: a syrup is made of
their succe most efficacious and useful for all these ends.

CHAP. XXIII. Of Berberryes.
BErberryes grow upon spinous shrubs, assurging with hard branches of five or
six cubits height, their bark is smooth and whitish, their root flave, the
matter of their wood luteous; their leafes numerous, rigid, acute, oblong,
hard, dilutely green, crenated and somewhat rough, their flowers depending on
long pedicles are luteous mossy and splendent, their fruits small, oblong, red
and racemously cohaerent, this Plant and fruit are called Spina acida, or
Oxyacantha, by the shopmen Berberryes, deduced from Avicenna his Amyrberis, as
Dodonaeus judges, who calls this fruit Oxyacantha not Oxacanthum, which
Amybreris is the fruit of the acute or white spine, it is red, sweet and
rotund, they vulgarly call it Senella, and Berberryes Spinivineta.

Berberryes refrigerate and siccate moderately, Vires.
astringe potently, cohibite the fluour of blood and other humors, allay the
heat of the bowels, stay vomiting and recreate the intralls.

CHAP. XXIIII. Of Filberds.
NOthing is better known then these Nutts, the Greeks, call them (...), or
small Nutts, Apothecaryes Filberds, or Abellines from the Town Abellinum in
Campania: there they grow copiously, some call them Ponticae, because they come
from Pontus; others Praenestinae, because the Praenestians useing these,
tolerate hunger long.

They are either domestical or wild, the domestical are either long and
reconded in long and herbaceous husks fimbriated about; or rounder with a
shorter and more patulous husk. Those of the long ones are best that are
contained in a red membrane; the wild are smaller and less grateful, growing
in Hedges and Woods.

All of them are gathered of a low Tree called a Hasle, whose boughs, if young,
are straight enodose and obsequious, leafes broad acuminated and serrated
about; bark, thin; root, crasse; both fruit and Tree are well known.

Filberds ingrede the confecture of Lohoc de pineis, they are sometimes
incrustated with Sugar, that they may serve instead of junkers, and eat more
pleasantly, they are hard of concoction, they are somewhat Bechicall, and
because of their pleasant sapour, may be admixed to pectorall medicaments.

CHAP. XXV. Of Fisticle-Nuts.
FIsticle-Nutts grow on a Tree like Terebinth, whose exterior tegument is very
thin, and green; the second lignous, fragile and whitish like a Nucament; the
Kernel is greenish, dulcoamare and jucund, Pliny says that Vitellius first
brought them out of Syria into Italy; and Flaccus Pompeius into Spain.

Their Tree was heretofore exoticall, but the sedulity of latter ages has
cicurated it, so that it now fruticates in many Septentrionall coasts, but its
fruit seldom or never attains maturity: the Shopmen call them Festici;
Posidonius Bistacle Nuts; most Pistacle Nutts

They are hot humid or temperate and salubre, Vires.
they incrassate the tabid phlegm, coct and expurge the matter contained in the
Lungs, liberate the bowels from infarctures, augment the spesperme excite to
venery, and auxiliate such as have pain in their reins.

CHAP. XXVI. Of Almonds.
AN Almond is not so like a Quince-Tree, as many write, for it is more
frondose, taller, and more lasting; vested with a crasser bark, more angust,
longer and crenated leafes; it seldom fruticates in the Northern regions, and
seldomer fructisyes, though its flowers are very patient of cold: for
explicating themselves before Winter be ended, they tolerate frost innoxiously;
and produce Almonds copiously in Autumn, which some cognominate Grecian and
Thasian Nutts.

Some of these are amare, hotter, and less esculent; others sweet, culinary
and more delectable: both grow on a similar Tree. Oil is extracted out of
both, out of the amare bitter oil which they say is good for pain in the
ears; out of the sweet, sweet oil; which is temperate and most grateful to
nature, for it may be given successefully to all ages and sexes as to very
infants, it is a most familiar and secure medicament for such as cough, it
cocts and expectorates humors delabeing upon the Stomach.

Two memorable effects are praedicated of bitter Almonds to wit that they kill
Wolves and arceate ebriety, whereof Plutarch tells a story; There was (says
he) a Physician with Drusius the Son of Tiberius Caesar, who being accustomed
to eat bitter Almonds would superate all in drinking, and never be overtaken
with temulency.

The sweet ones being very pleasant afford many junkets, for they are
decorticated and set upon the Table, or resiccated, or incrustated and condited
with Sugar, or brayed and made into a sweet bread with Sugar and Rosewater
called Macharones, Vires.
or else made into a lacteous potion for puerperous women.

Bitter Almonds are hot and detersive; sweet ones are pretty temperate,
grateful to the Palate and Almonious.

CHAP. XXVII. Of Wallnuts.
THe Wallnut is called Nux juglans, as if one should say Jovis Glans, or rather
Juvans; for Carpenters seek to the Trunk of its Tree; Dyers to its bark;
Boys to its fruit; Apothecaryes quaeritate its Medicinal use, which
Mithridates knew, who confected his Antidote of Nutts, and a few other
additaments; as also Galen who made his Diacaryon, or Dianutum, of their succe,
with as much honey as might dulcorateit; with which medicament he cured a
gardener almost suffocated with swellings, inflammations, and Kernells.

This Nutt-Tree is very grand, with nervous leafes, in face and cohaerence like
Ash leafes, but greater; it grows in fields by high ways in fat and restible
ground, as also in Gardens, but because it affects and kills the vicine
segetives and Plants with its odor, it is planted about Hedges and Margins of
fields, according to that of the Poet.

Me, satane laedam, nam satis laedere dicor,
Jmus in extremo margin fundus habet.
About Summers solstice its green and tender Nutts are excorticated and infused
in water till they demit their amaritude; then they are cocted, afterward
stuck with and Cinnamom Cloves, and then cocted in Sugar and kept, and so they
will roborate the weak ventricle, and help concoction.

These Nutts dry do calefie and siccate, their Oil which is extracted by
contusion and expression, is calefactive; it digests, resolves, roborates the
nerves, and discusses flatuosity, and therefore it is rightly mixed in Clysters
against Colicall dolours, ariseing from flatuous and frigid humors.

CHAP. XXVIII. Of Pine-Nuts.
THe Pine Tree, firre-Tree, Pitch-Tree, Cedar, and Laring-Tree are all very
tall, coniferous, resinifluous, and almost all alike, but some of them are
exoticall, not easily cicurable in our soil, as the Cedar of Palestina and
Lebanon; others are indeed Venaculous, but altogether, wild and Sylvestrian,
never planted in Gardens, save for spectacles, as the Firre-Tree, Pitch-Tree,
and wild- Pine: but the true Pine is more urbane and mansuet, which, when they
have got a crasse Caul, emitt many boughs out of every side, vested with
slender and long leafes aculeated about.

Its fruits are called Pine-Apples, which are compacted of many membranes like
scales, crasse, hard and lignous, in whose middles oblong, rotund, and sweet
Kernells are involved in thin membranes which are sometimes called Pine-Nuts,
sometimes Coccali and sometimes Pinei.

This Nut is temperate, but rather acceding to calour, whence they inserve to
venery; for they augment sperme and milk, nourish much, conduce in inveterate
coughs, and help such as are tabid.

Besides the true Pine there are many wild ones, as the three sorts of pitch
Trees that delight in maritimous places, and some others that grow
sponraneously in Rocky and montanous places, all of them as also the Firre-Tree
and Larinx-Tree are Lachrimous, and effuse either spontaneously or by
vulneration, either more liquid or more spisse, whiter or blacker succes,
whereof we shall treat in the sequel section.

CHAP. XXIX. Of Cypress Nutts.
Cypress is perpetually frondous, its caul is tall, round; crasse, and erect;
fastigiated with an orbicular summity, with leafes like them of Pine, but more
carnous, shorter, obtuse and amare with many folious, angust, graveolent and
rough but not pungent boughs.

Its fruits are Cones or Nutts representing them in shape, which chinking or
dehiscing with age and calour easily let fall their small seeds included in
them; the matter of the wood is solid flave and odorate, very fit for ligneous
vessels.

There are two sorts of this Tree, the one masculine which is faecund, thrice
annually bearing Nutts, in Jannuary, May and September; its effigies is very
morose, it is graveolent, and not delighted in shades.

The other is faeminine, which is sterile, neither beareing Nutts nor seed, its
boughs are more extended; in other things it is like the masculine, for both
are perpetually frondous, the same color, odor sapour virtue and effigies in
both: the Cypress Tree is very patient of cold, never startling at Winters
Frosts, yet the rigidity of the year 1608, killed all about Paris.

Theophrastus tells us that Cypresses grow in Creet spontaneously, without
seed, as also in Mount Ida and other Mountains; where he affirms that he
found Cypresses amongst snow (which their summityes never want) though they
will not grow else where, unless they find tepour; there exudes a certain
Rosine out of Cypresses of the consistency with that of Larinx, and a very
sharp sapour which is of rare use.

The whole Cypress is calefactive, exsiccative and astrictive; Vires.
but its leafes, buds, Nutts, and seeds are of most use, they roborate laxe
parts, cohibite dysenteriall and cholicall affections, and stay humors.

CHAP. XXX. Of Bay-berryes, and its fruit.
THe Bay Tree, called by the Greeks (...), which was consecrated to Apollo, who
coronated himself with a branch thereof for a sign of divination, is a shrub
perpetually frondous and green, erecting its head to the just procerity of a
Tree, with many and crasse boughs invested in green bark, with oblong, broad,
mucronated, hard, green, and suaveolent leafs, white flowers crupting out of
the boughs, whereunto fruits or berryes succeed of an ovall figure black and
gravidated with a solid stone, suaveolent, and amare with some acrimony.

This Tree germinates copiously all over France, I saw some in Normandy near
the Sea of the magnitude of an indifferent Oak. but they grow more plenteously
and largely in Italy and hot regions, for they do not tolerate such rigid
Winters as the sepentrionall incolists feel, without harm; for the frost often
kills their branches and leafes; however, these abscinded, new surcles arise in
their stead. Many write that this Tree is not only free from percussion with
thunder, but also any house wherein a bough thereof is reposed: therefore
Tiberius Caefar afrightned with the coruscations and fragour of Thunder, was
crowned with bays.

Bay-berryes calefye much, Vires.
siccate, attenuate, and discuss flatuosity: they are mixed with medicaments
that reficiate the lassitude of the nerves; and with unguents, which calefye
and resolve; their oil expressed or elicited by decoction, deleats and cures
scabs, blew places, wheales, and many faedityes of the skin, and discusses
effused humors.

CHAP. XXXI. Of Juniper-Berryes.
JUniper is a lignous, ramous shrub, aequalizing an indifferent Tree in
magnitude, vested with a membranous and frequently disrumpent bark; bearing
berryes at first green, and by maturity black, of the magnitude of Pease: its
wood is flave like the Citrian Santulum, its leafes are angust and acuminated,
rather resembling spines then leafes, it grows spontaneously, and thrives best
in dry and incultivated places, delighting more in montanous and squalid soyles
then in plain ones. This Tree alone prolongs its fruit for two years, which
growing old will rather wither upon the Tree then decide. Juniper is very like
Cedar, and by some called Oxycedrus, but ill: for though both have tortuous
Caules, acute leafes, always green, and small round berryes, yet they differ
much; for Oxycedrus is an Exoticall Plant, with flave odorate and pleasant
berryes, its wood is red, it grows spontaneously in Asia, as Juniper in France.

Bellonius knew a greater kind of Juniper assurging to the altitude of a
moderate Tree, which bears berryes of the magnitude of filberds, or sometimes
aequaliseing Galls, but ours is no whit less efficacious, but it is probable
much better, and solely used in medicine.

Juniper effuses a certain resinous Gum, which Serapio calls Sandarax, the
Latins Vernix; in whose stead some have substituted Sandaracha being deceived
with the affinity of the words; now Sandaracha is a kind of auripigmentum, and
exitial poison, for there being three sorts of Arsenick, the croceous, by some
called Risagalum, the red or Sandaracha, and the white or vulgar, and all of
them deletery, Sandaracha must needs be exitious and not safely usurped for
Juniper-Gum. Pliny also uses Sandaracha in a far more different sense, to
wit for that meat that Bees eat, while they make their Combs which he
sometimes calls Erithate and Cerinthus.

Juniper Berryes calefy, help the Stomach, move Urine, Vires.
expurge crasse and viscid humors, are good against inflammations, gripings,
biteings of Serpents, Cough, and pectorall vices, they are convenient
antidotall ingredients.

CHAP. XXXII. Of Galls.
GAlls are certain rough spurious fruits, which grow upon glandiferous Trees
besides their legitimate ones; they erupt commonly in the night, when the Sun
is going out of Gemini; at which time, if the weather be fervid, they tabefy,
and never attain their perfect magnitude; they grow plenteously in Bohemia and
Spain, upon many Oaks, on whose trunks, and boughs they adhaere often without
pedicles,

There are many sorts of Galls, two whereof are especially accommodated to make
up medicaments and condense hides, the one is called Omphacitis, which is
small, rugous, nodose, solid and perviated with no holes; the other plain,
light, flave, more laxe within, larger, and perforated; out of whose holes
comes a certain insect, or fly, or vermicle, or some such little animal for
the most part.

The best Galls emerge out of those Oaks we call Hemeris and Robur. Hemeris is
that that some call Midion, its caul is orbicularly contorted, bearing many
Acornes on the wings of its branches, and many Galls.

Robur is a Oak by Theophrastus called (...), bearing Galls in great plenty,
besides many Acorns and other small pills adhaereing to the middle of its
leafes without any pedicle, as we see in our Oaks. Oaks do not only bear
Acornes and natural branches, but misselto Galls, Apples, Whamps, and many
more pseudo-fruits.

Galls are cold in the second, dry in the third degree, they astringe potently,
Vires.
contract laxe parts, roborate imbecill ones, cohibite fluxes, and are
efficaciously usurped to astringe and siccate.

SECT. VII. Of Gums.
NOthing is more common then Cums, Rosines and Lacrhima's; yet nothing of
greater controversy about their true knowledge and distinction amongst
themselves: for scarce any Author that ever writ hereof, but have promiscuously
and confusedly mingled them together, reckoning Amber, Ambergreese, Amoniacum,
Sagapenum, Galbanum and Scammony amongst liquors. Weeker jumbles together, both
Gums, Rosines, concreted Juices, and Liquors: others have described them with
this and that Plant. We shall observe a better method, and distinguish Gums
from Rosines, and both from Liquors.

CHAP. I. Of the succes and humors of Plants.
AS Horns from Hearts, and feathers and hair from many animals do annually
decide: so do leafs, dawen, flowers and fruits from Plants, who also have their
flesh, their nerves bones, veins, and also blood and humor destinated for
each parts nutriment, and not only these, but their flowers also, as women
have, which in certain circulations of seasons, flow from them; as Tears from
Vines, Gums from Cherry Almond and other Trees, Rosine from Lentisks, Pitch
from Larch, and other liquors from other Trees, when they are molested with its
quantity: for as blood swells and troubles animalls, if it be too copious; so
does humors Plants, whereunto they give passage either spontaneously, or by
art, that by their profluence they may find ease and incolumity.

Now a Plants blood is its proper juice, which according to Aristotle is
Fig Trees like milk, in Vines like an humor, Sanguis plantarum varius.
in some like liquid Pitch, in other like oil, in some like Gums, and the same
Philosopher says that some have succe like Rosine Myrrh, Frankincense and
Storax; some also have veins, belly and parts analogous to them of an animal,
contrary to Anaxagoras.

This humor of Plants, which failing, the Plants begin to fail, and which
being exsiccated, they tabefy, wants a common name according to Theophrastus,
and so are denoted by the vulgar word succe, which some call tears, others
liquor, others humors which according to their various coctions acquire
various spissitudes and colors.

If we look at the consistency of these humors, some are thin and aqueous,
others crasse and viscid, others harder, others such as may be condensed, and
others such as cannot; and if we look at their sapour and quality, some are
vincus as the succe of Vines, Apple Trees, Mulberry-Trees, and Myrtle; others
sat, as those of Olives, Nut-Trees, and Almond-Trees; others viscid and
resinous, as those of the Firre-Tree, Pine, and Larch; otherssweet as those of
the Fig Tree, Palm, and Jujubs; others acrimonious as those of Origanum,
Pepper, and Mustard Plant; and others amare, as those of Wormwood, earth Gall,
and Coloquintida.

CHAP. II. What Gum is and how it differs from Rosins and other concrete
Liquors.
THough the succes of Plants being multifarious cannot according to Oribasius
be easily comprehended, yet who so reduces them to certain heads and kinds,
shall and may get certain knowledge of them.

Now this (...), Quiasuccus
or succe is that humor wherewith a Tree is nourished, and which cannot be
spontaneously elicited, but by praecedent triture, expression, or other
praeparation; and it is always thin unless it be exsiccated by calour, as we
see in Rob, and other inspissated succes.

But Liquor is crasser, and such as will sometimes spontaneously, sometimes by
vulneration delabe lachrimously, whence it is often called Tears: Liquor.
if this Liquor be oleaginous and liquid, we call it (...), or Rosine; if more
terrene, aqueous and concrete in the Trunks of Trees, Resina. Gummi.
we call it Gum; if it be partly terrene and aqueous, partly oleaginous and
fatt, participating both of the nature of Gum and Rosine, then we call it Gummy
Rosine.

Now Gum that I may use the exoticall Idiome Commi, Gummi quid.
is a coagulated Lachryma or tear, concreted in the Trunks of those Trees that
produce it, ( Gal. C. 40. L. de simp.) whose substance is more aqueous, as that
of Rosine is more oleaginous. Gums, therefore should be admixed most to
aqueous, seldom to oleaginous medicaments Rosine in the contrary, easily takes
flame; but Gum cracks in the fire; for though it come hott from stillation,
yet is it presently coagulated in the air and becomes aqueous and hence
Arostotle makes it to crack upon burning coals.

But since it is of many kinds according to the different nature of the Trees
that produce it, for some Gums are coagulated hard like a stone; others softer;
some more pellucid or flave; others more obscure or pallid; some flowing from
peregrine, others from indigenous Trees. I shall first treat of that which
comes out of the spine Acacia, and is nominated Gum simply.

CHAP. III. Of Gum-Arabick.
Gum is an Arabic word, and when it is put absolutely; it must be understood
of Gum-Arabick, which Galen calls Thebane, some Babylonian, and others
Acanthine Gum. Nomina. Acacia Gummi. flua.
It flows from a certain arbuscle, which Dioscorides calls Acacia, whereof he
constitutes two sorts, the first assurging with a direct and lignous caul,
armed on every side with hard spines; vested with long leafes, which look as if
they were constituted of many small leafes, cohaereing together; white flowers;
short codds, Species.
like Lupines; a glabre and splendent seed; which Matthiolus depinges ill.

The other Acacia grows in Cappadocia and Pontus, which is lesser, slenderer,
and lower then the other, whose leafes are like Rue, and virgults aculeated,
out of which a succe is educed which retains the name of its Arbuscle, Acacia;
because of whose rarity we substitute the succe of the wild Plum-Tree; out of
which, laudable Gum flows forth, at first pellucid as glass, sincere and
contracted into the species of a vermicle, afterward white, sordid, resinous,
and useless.

It is efficacious in spissating and refrigerating; Vires.
it is commodiously mixed with ocular and arteriall medicaments, it obstructs
the pores of the skin, is represses prociduous eyes; that it may be more easily
pulverated; it must be verberated in a hot mortar with a hot Pestell.

CHAP. IIII. Of Gum Tragacanth.
GUm-Tragacanth is pellucid, white, sweet, light and sincere; which flows from
the vulnerated root of a certain Plant of the same name, this root adhaeres to
the surface of the Earth, and emitts low and rigid surcles; whereon are many
and slender leafes which cover white, straight, and firm spines: this arbuscle
which the Greeks call Tragacantha, and the Latins Spina herci, grows in Crete
and many places in Asia, which emitts its succe spontaneously, and without
incisure, as Theophrastus asserts contrary to Dioscorides, who says that this
Plant has no need of vulneration, which though it be exoticall and seldom
seen by our herbalists, yet I saw it cicurated and florid in the Garden of Jo.
Gonnerius that perite Physician; yet its coagulated succe, which the Gentiles
call Tragacanthum, and the Apothecaryes Dragaganthum is sufficiently known to
all: it cannot be easily laevigated unless the Mortar and pestle be hot.

Its use is commended to ocular medicaments, in a liniment with Honey or Sugar;
Vires.
it emends the roughness of the artery, coughs, retusenesse of voice, and
other defluxions.

CHAP. V. Of Gum Ammoniacum.
THis Gum is called Ammoniack because it distills upon the Sands near Jupiter
Ammons Oracle; but from what Plant is uncertain. Pliny says it flows from a
Tree they call Metopion, Dioscorides says it emanates both from a shrub they
call Agasyllis, and from a ferulaceous Plant; but the ferulaceous Plants can
scarce be called fruticall.

Galen asserts that it is the Tears of Ferula, from which is collected both a
sincere dense Gum, conspurcated with no sordidity, and coacted into small
glebes; as also an impure and inquinated one which Dioscorides call Phyrama,
who calls the other Thrausma.

That is good which is inquinated with no sandy, terrene, nor extraneous
matter, effigiated like masculine frankincense, graveolent, and amare; the
Apothecaryes call it corruptly Gum Armoniack, it may be dissolved in Water,
Vinegar, or White Wind.

It is so efficacious a mollitive, that it dissolves the stoney disease of the
Junctures, and discusses other tubercles; it cures indurated Milts, Vires.
and in drink liberates from obstructions, it moves urine and flowers, and
extrudes stones.

CHAP. VI. Of Lacca and Cancamum.
WHat Lacca, and what Cancamum are, whether they be both one or distinct, and
what each of them is, does not appear by the writings of Authors. Serapio,
Paulus, and Matthiolus believe that Lacca is that which Dioscorides calls
Cancamum. Bras^volus, Garcias ab horto, and Clusius think it is a distinct
thing, who being desirous to find out the truth have lustrated various tracts
of the world, and think that Lacca is not only distinct from Cancamum, but also
unknown: for seeing it is only used for perfumes, and we have many more
fragrant and suaveolent Thymiamata, it has not been so diligently sought
after; moreover being exoticall, the Tree from which it delabes, growing, as it
is thought, in Arabia, our Merchants have not deigned it worth the search and
portage: however it is a kind of Gum, of a virous sapour, sweet odor, and rare
use. Now Lacca is destitute of both these qualityes frequently invented,
neither the Arabian Chermes, nor the succe of Sorbe-Tree, nor Medlar-Tree; nor
yet like Myrrh, as Avicenna writes, who it may be knew it not; but if Garcias
de horto may be credited it is a kind of Favago, and concreted liquor, on the
boughs of a vast Tree, coacted by the sucking and help of winged Ants.

And this Tree grows not in Arabia, but in India, especially in the province
of Pegu, where Lacca is called Trec, as also in Bengala and Malavar, where it
is called Loc and Lac. Garcias endeavors to establish and confirm this
opinion by reason and much History, striving also to prove out of Amatus
Lusitanus, that Cancamum is an Aroma, otherwise called Anyme, whereof he
constitutes two varietyes, the one white, which also according to Brissotus a
Physician of Paris, is Dioscorides his Cancamum; and the other somewhat black,
which myrrh or rather Mynea or Amynea.

Thus the obscurity of the thing, Vires.
drives us to the affinity of names, there to investigate the truth: but if I
may speak freely, I think that Anyme, or Amynea as some will have it, Myrrh
and Cancamum are three distinct things: and that, that which the shopmen call
Lacca is that same which the ancients called Cancanum, who being ignorant of
some words depromed from the Barberians, believed such things as they heard
though never so slackly, and so by calling Cancamum Lacca, left this liberty of
discussing to the ensuing posterity.

Some maintain this opinion, saying that there are three sorts of Lacca, one
is Dioscorides his Cancamum, which scarce any ever saw, the second common
Lacca, the third factitious, which Dyers use, whereof there are more
differences, which for brevitys sake I omit.

The vulgar Lacca is hard, pellucid, and yellow like Myrrh, circularly
involving the surcles of an exoticall Tree, which is not I think, elicited,
elaborated, and cohibited to the boughs of that Tree by the sucking and labor
of Indian Ants, as Garcias affirms; but exudes and concretes spontaneously,
like other Gummes and Tears, for these animalls, laboring for victuals in
Summer against Winter, do not expose their panifice, to the injuryes of the
air and Heavens, on boughs; but recond it in Caves and Holes, and few I hope
will believe that Indian Ants will labor in vain for Lacca, and not congest
and coact it for meat, but desert it. That which is brought to us, circumvests
the sticks of the Tree, is hard and pellucid, easily dissolvable in water; and
this ingredes the trochisckes of Carabe and Dialacca, and not the factitious
Lacca as some perperously imagine.

It is not so much celebrated for medicinal as other mechanical uses, Vires.
as to the making of sealing Wax, and infecting such tinctures as are put upon
ligneous vessels, and adorning other colors, for it makes them shine
elegantly.

CHAP. VII. Of Dragons-Blood,
THe pervestigation of Dragons-Blood has exercised many wits: for some
following the erroneous opinion of Pliny, think that it is the Blood of a
Dragon animate, smitten by an Elephant, which error Solinus does not only,
embrace, but holds that Cinnabaris is that same which Apothecaryes call
Dragons-Blood. Serapio writes, that it is the succe of a certain Plant, which
he calls Sydrichis and Egilos, which our Herbalists think is the fourth species
of Wall-sage, some ignorant Apothecaryes are imposed upon by circulators, and
buy a kind of business tincted with red Earth, and the juice of Madder, and
such things, convolved into lumps, for Dragons-Blood:

Brassavolus foolishly constitutes three sorts of Dragons-Blood: the first
factitious of pseudobole; the second the lacrymae of a certain Tree; the third
Gum. But as the adulterate is no species of Dragons-Blood; so neither can
there be two sorts, the one a Lacryma, the other a Gum of the same Tree, for
all Gumms lacrymously distilling from any Tree, are called generally lacrymae.

Aloysius Cadamustus a noble Venetian, expresses its Original better; There is
(says he) in an Island called Pontus Sanctus, which is one of the Canaryes,
Dragons-Blood, which is the Lachryma of a certain Tree; which at a certain
season the incolists fauclate, out of which incisions the next year Gum will
emanate, which they coct in kettles, and defaecate making thereof
Dragons-Blood. That Tree bears fruits like Cherryes in March, which (...) an
eximious sapour, and Venetian color.

^ Monardus seems to assent to this opinion, and asserts that Dragons-Blood is
the lachryma of some Tree, and not the Goare of any animal; for (says he) a
few days ago, a Carthaginian Bishop brought hither, from the continent of the
new World, (...) the fruit of that Tree, which emitts that Lacryma we call
Dragons-Blood.

The fruit is very admirable; for the skin wherewith it is covered being taken
away, a little Dragon appears of such artificial (...) fabricature, that the
most perite artist cannot better (...) it in Marble; it is conspicuous with an
oblong neck, a ^^ing mouth, an aculeated backbone, a long tail and feet.

From this fruit both the Tree and its Lacryma derived their (...): that is
best which is brought from Carthage,

The Tree is tall, with a thin bark, and easily vulnerable, (...) name being
unknown to the ancients, they wrote no certainty of the nature and original of
its Lacryma. Clusius saw the Tree and described it accurately.

Dragons-Blood then, is the name both of an exoticall Tree, and the hard
purpureous Gum concreted on its boughs.

It is collective and agglutinatory, and therefore fit to conjoyn wounds, and
astringe and roborate laxe parts: Vires.
it may easily be dissolved in water.

CHAP. VIII. Of Asa foetida.
Many following the opinion of the ancients, constitute two sorts of Asa; one
sweet and odorate, and the other Faetid and stinking; the later they say is the
Arabian Altit, the former the A^^ ^^yes Belzoni, and both come out of Laser or
Laserpitium, but what sweet- Asa is, cannot yet be determined: Nay I think it
^^ore ignore to this latter age, then Asa faetida was to the ancients, of
which, they never make mention that I know of; but (...) is so frequent in
Pharmacopolyes, that it offends every youngsters nose, in grows on a
ferulaceous Plant, as Belzoin does of a ^^ll one which I never find called Asa.
But as the sapour, odor and Original of each of them is different, so is
their nomenclature.

Now Asafaetida is the excrement, Asa quid.
or Gum of Laser or Laserpitium, which Dioscorides calls Stilphion; Avicenna
Altit, or Antit, the Indians A^j^den; and the Apothecaryes Assa, but more
properly ^sa as if they should say Lasor, for Laser is a Lacryma; Laserpitium,
a Plant out of which this Laser or Asa is cliched, not Assa; which according to
Rhasis is an herb that some call Hyssope, others Thyme: Now Laserpitium is a
serulaceous Plant with an annual Caul, which they ^all Maspet^m; leafes like
Apium, but flave broad and foliaceous feed; and a black, crasse, long and
cubitall root. Garcias indeed does boldly pronounce Asa ^ Lacryma of
Laserpitium, but exhibites a ^^june description thereof, speaking only a little
of its leafes which he says are like Hasse leafes. This Plant does peculiarly
avoid alb^^^^tivated places; and therefore by culture absolutely deviates and
degenerates, as naturally ^^^ing culture (according to Theophrastus) to whom
ferocity is ^^^^cular.

(...) of this Plant designed by a (...) ^^ture (...) Magudaris; it (...) least
(...) its lead (...) for (says (...) folium (...) Magydaris differs from (...)
whether (...) a part of the same Plant, or (...) hereunto, it matters not; for
Asa is the La^rym^ or Gumm^ o^ ^^serpitium, which is ^^^h^r taken from its root
or from its cau^^ ^^ph^astus calls that of the root, Radicarium; and the other
(...)

It g^o^es in Armenia; Media, Lybia, and Syris; wh^^^ (...) sometimes called the
Lybian, sometimes the Medium, and Sy^^^ succe. They called it of old, the
Cyrenian succe, because it g^ew copiously and well in the Cyrenian feilds, but
that name is (...) almost abrogated; for the Barbarians out of some hatred
conceived against the Cyrenians, eradicated and extirpated all their
^^serpitium, as Strabo denotes. The Syrian Laser is best after the Cyrenian,
and the Median after the Syrian.

There are two sorts of Asa, the one pure, sincere, and transparent; the other
turbid and impure, wherewith bran or Sagapen^ is mixed, whole halite and
stinking odor it well resembles.

Hence the Germans call it the Devils dung: both of the^ ^^veny ^dor^te, but
^^^veelent, so that I cannot easily assent (...) opinion who think that one
sort of Asa is sweet; for neither ^^^dour of the one nor of the other can be
tolerated without lo^^^ somnesse, whence I admite that Garcius should say that
no ^^^ple ^e dicament in all India should be more in use then Asa ^^tida^ both
in medicines, and also in mea^^. The Indians are wont to mix it with the in
Pot-hearbs in their pottage; having first ^^^bed their kettl^s there with,
useing no other ^^^^^ment to any mea^, but (...) to recall their appetite when
they nause any thing. If this be not a fable, Asa must either not stink in
India, (...) the Indians must have br^seh throats as the Proverb goes this Asa
is so ungrateful to us both in odor and sapour, that we can easily pardon
Matthaeus Sylvaticus who reposed it amongst Poisons, yet Dioscorides commends
it for meat.

Who enumerated so many and so great faculties, Vires.
wherewith it is endued that he was able to most loath somnesse. The more
recent hold it very efficacious, but only to a few affections; who never use it
save against the ascent, and aberration of the uterus, and some other diseases
appertaining to women.

CHAP. IX. Of Sagapene or Serapine.
Sagapene by Apothecaryes, Serapinum, is a concrete liquour (...) ^ing out of
the sauciated root of a ferulaccous Plant in Me^^^ whose description
Dioscorides omitted because perhaps he (...) not so much knowledge of the
Plant, as of the succe, which (...) I neither yet saw, nor read designed by any
author; for be^^^ ^^^ticall it is either not cicurable, or if cicurated
sterile, (...) sucee, and marcid. Its concrete succe, therefore, is only (...),
the best whereof is translucid, yellow, white within, (...) graveolent, and
crasse in substance.

(...) calefyes in the third degree, siccates in the second, (...) crasse
Phlegm, and other viscid humors, as Mesue attests: (...) pu^gative faculty is
in some very ignave, in others potent, (...) ^^^her drunk, or used by way of
suppository it evokes flowers, (...) the young; cures the dolor and
praefocation of the uterus, ^^^^ves, attenuates, dissipates, moves, and solves.

CHAP. X. Of Galbanum.
GAlbanum is also the concrete succe of a Syrian Ferula copiously growing in
the Mountain Amanus; which succe some ^^ll Metopium. Dioscorides knowing this
Gummeous succe better (...) the Plant, left nothing in writing of its
dignotion; but as the (...) are well known, so also are their liquors and
succes, and (...) not only by their consistency, but color, odor, sapour and
^^^tyes: for Galbanum in aspect repraesents Asa; in odor Opopanax. The best is
cartilaginous, sincere, like Gum Ammoniack, not lighous, in which there is
some ferula seed; graveolent, not very ^^^id, nor squalid; this as all other
Gummes may be easily dissol^^^d in water, Vinegar, or Wine.

It is excalefactive extractive, and discussive: it accelerates flowers,
deliverance in Childbearing, either by admotion, or suffumigati^; dissolved
with Vinegar and mixed with a little nitre it deleats pimples, it discusses
boyles and lumps on the junctures; Vires.
it is ad^^^^d Poisons, and drives away Serpents.

CHAP. XI. Of Opopanax.
THat Opopanax is the succe of Panax, both its name demonstrates, and
Dioscorides affirms; but seeing there are (...) sorts of Panax, it is not
apparent, out of which of them it (...) Mesue says it flows from the
ferulaceous Panax; Dioscorides, (...) the Heraclean; and some say, from the
Chironian Panax.

Dodon^us tells us that it distills from a per^gri^^ Panax; (...) the Syrian
Panax; which has ample, sharp, hirs^^^, long and broad leafes, a geniculated
and ^erulac^ous Caul, of (...) four cubits height, supernally distermina^ed
into many (...) with luteous flowers erupting out of ample umbells; after
which, broad, plain and subflave seeds do emerge, its root is whit^^^ (...)
succulent and odorate, a Gummeous succe flows out of it (...) vulnerated
especially toward the root in summer; which (...) and many more call Opopanax;
which is laudable for many uses, as the nomenclature of the Plant from which it
flows demonstrates: for Panax or Panaces denotes the abigation of all do^^^s,
and the remedy of all diseases; hence many Pseudomedicks call some medicaments
which are more perilous then the diseases, Panaceous remedies: thus did a lying
drunken, vain, salacious Ps^^domedick deceive many Country and credulous
persons while he lived.

Opopanax is a kind of Gum easily dissolvable by water, kercale^yes in the
third degree, siccates in the second; mollifyes, digests, Vires.
attenuates, dissipates flatuosity, leniates and expurges: that which is very
amate, white within, or somewhat yellow, ^ai^ under, ^^iable, easily liqu^stible
and graveolent is good; the (...) and loft is not good.

CHAP. XII. Of Sarcocolla.
SArcocolla is both the name of a peregrine Plant, and a Gum flowing out of
it; it grows in Persia, it is fruticous and spinose, with nodose boughs
appressed to the Tree; which sauciated, and sometimes spontaneously, lacrymates
a kind of Frankincense like Powder of a yellowish color and amare sapour.

It calefyes in the second degree, siccates not so much, it cocts deterges,
carnifyes, and glutinates; whence it is called Sarcocolla, Vires.
for it heales wounds wonderfully, for it does by a proper faculty, expurge
them from filth, repleate them with flesh, and obduce them to a skarre.

The Arabians say, that Sarcocolla does not only subduce the belly, but educe
crasse and viscid humors from places much dissited, as from the cavityes of
the Articles; but reason, and their effects seem to refragate this: it does
indeed with much efficacy conglutinate wounds, inhibite the fluxions of the
eyes, and digest but not so much as Galbanum; if it be five days macerated in
Asses milk, in a glasse-vessell, and the milk daily changed, it will
exceedingly help such as have pearls, or dim and clowdy eyes.

CHAP. XIII. Of Gum of Jvy.
THe trunk of the greater Ivy vulnerated, and sometimes spontaneously,
elacrymates a certain Gummeous succe of an aureous color, graveolent and
sharp to the gust, which they call Ivy-Gumme. Now Ivy is a Scansory Tree,
which circumvests walls, and vicine Plants; which it kills with its
multifarious convolutions and virour.

Whereof there are two prime kinds: the one greater, which erects it self on
high; the other lesser, which creeps along the ground with slender and
obsequious branches, neither beareing flower nor fruit.

There are three varietyes of the greater Ivy; one is called white Ivy, because
it bears white berryes; another black that bears black ones; and the third
barren that bears none, which some take for the lesser Ivy.

The white bears white berryes, and sometimes white leafes, emitting certain
branches or capreols out of the midst of its leafs, wherewith it so strictly
complects the Trees, that it kills them by sucking their humor from them; or
so pertinaceously adhaere to walls that they can scarce be sejoyned, for it
emitts as many beginnings and rudiments of roots, as it does branches, and
remains so vivacious, that though intercised in many places, yet it tabefyes
not.

The black and more vulgar which they call Dionysia, creeps upon Walls and old
aedifices, and amplects Trees with its radical fingers, its leafes are
angulous; for at first they are triangular, afterward more rotund, hard and
nitent with perpetual viridity, its flowers are small berryes, at first
herbaceous, then black, adhaereing racemously upon oblong pedicles: other
haederaceous matters are so notorious, as not to need further explication.

All Ivies are hot and seldom used in medicine; except the leafes, which are
adhibited by way of Sparadrappes, to the fonticles left by Causticks, that they
may alliciate watery and serous humors to those parts; Vires.
its Gum kills Nitts, which by its exceeding calour impresses a sense of
adustion and denudates the head of hairs; for it is a good Psyloter.

SECT. VIII. Of Rosines.
CHAP. 1. What Rosine is, and of its Varities.
ROsine, by the Greeks (...), is a lachryma or liquor, fat, Quid.
and oleaginous, distilling from a tree, often spontaneously, and sometimes by
vulneration: That which emergeth spontaneously, is called (...), and by some
(...).

All Rosine consisting of an oleous substance, and tenuious parts, is more
promptly dissoluble in oleous and affine liquors, and therein dissident from
Gum; which consisting of a more aqueous substance, is more expeditely and
accurately soluble in aqueous liquors.

If we look to the consistency of Rosines, we shall find them of two sorts;
the one liquid, by the Greeks (...), that is, humid or fluxile, as Turpentine;
the other harder and dryer, by the Greeks, (...), that is, broiled, or roasted;
such as Colophonia, so denominated from Colophon, whence it was of old brought:
which is most dry, and most flave; yet its powder is white.

This is before the rest called (...), or (...), that is, confused, because
it is indurated into a mass, from many congested together: for, it often
happens, that the primisluous Rosine by negligent collection, contracts and
retains sand, stones, pieces of wood, or straws, or such sordidities; from
which, that it may be purged, it must be melted, the extraneous rejected, and
so it becomes purer, harder, and dryer.

There is another kind of Rosine, concreting without the help of fire, which
the Greeks call (...), that is, dry; which participating of no pinguetude, is
presently dry, and called by Galen, (...), that is, a piceous germination.

That which is sold in shops being hard, flave, and fryable, Vires.
is indeed a certain confused Rosine; for it consists of the lacryma of
Firre-tree, Pitch-tree, and Pine Tree: which in accension makes a fume like
Frankincense.

Galen makes much mention of the Strobilian Rosine, which some say flows from
the Pine Tree, others from the Pitch-tree, others from Pine-nuts, which they
call Strobili. This is the hottest of Rofines; Turpentine is most moderate in
both qualities: for, all Rosines califie and siccate; the Strobilian most,
Turpentine least.

That is the dryest of all, which some call (...), others Colophonian Rosine;
all them also are dry, that are purged by fire, and made fryable.

Firre-tree Rosine is moderate in both qualities, which some do ill call
Colophonian Rosine, for it remains long liquid: it siccates little, and flows
but in small quantity, and therefore more precious.

Turpentine is preferred before all other Rosines, Mastick is next, then
Firre-tree Rosine, then Pine-Rosine, and then Pitch.

Rosines are of much use, not only in Pharmacy, but many other things; they
mollify, califie, digest, and are good ingredients in salves and unguents, for
the curation of wounds and ulcers.

We have in the Section of Fruits, treated of the Pine, and other coniferous
Trees.

CHAP. 2. Of Pitch.
THese words, Pix, Teda, Pissa, Palimpissa, Zopissa, Pissaphaltos, and Pix
navalis, often occur in the narration and dilucidation of Rosines; but what
they denote, every one knows not at first sight: Pix then or Pitch, is the flux
of combust Rosine; or rather, a fat and rosinous liquor, colliquated and educed
out of the middle of a Pinetree accended.

Teda is not a tree, as Pliny falsely asserts, but a disease happening to the
Pine Tree by age; wherein it is as it were strangulated by its too much
pinguetude: for the abundance of that rosinous matter, wherewith the whole Tree
is referted, is its ruin; which going into a Teda, may by artificial sedulity
be accended, and it will effuse Pitch; which the Greeks call Pissa.

Palimpissa, is iterated or twice-boiled Pitch; that is, when by a second
liquid coction and elaboration, it is made more crass, pure, harder, and dryer:
(...), is dry Pitch.

Zopissa, is Pitch deraded from off maritimous ships; which, because of its
contracted saltness in the Sea, is more efficaciously exsiccative and
discussive: Some call it Apochyma.

Pix navalis, so called from pitching-ships, is that which is deraded from
ships lately pitched, as Zopissa, of a longer continuance: when Pix navalis is
put absolutely, Zopissa should be taken; and when Zopissa, this.

Pissaphaltum, is Pitch mixed with Bitumen, which the Ancients used in
conditing dead bodies. Yet Dioscorides thinks it is no artificial, but a
natural commixture: for (says he) that which we call Pissaphaltum, grows in
the Apollinatarian field, near Epidaurus. But we will treat more largely
hereof, in the Chapter of Mummy.

Pitch differs from Rosine in this, that Pitch is educed by fire, and Rosine
erupts spontaneously: They are both the product of the same Trees, but Pitch is
as it were cocted Rosine.

The eduction of Pitch, is effected after the manner that we make Charcoal; for
the middles of the Pine-trees are cut into spears, and congested upon an
artificial Pavement; then the boughs of Fur and pitch-tree superimposed; then
all so covered with earth, clay, or such incombustible matter, that no chink be
left anywhere, save on the top, or other more convenient place, whereat they
may immit the fire, and at first emit the flame: but when the Tedae are
accended, they occlude all very strictly and closely, lest the flame should
erupt, and they be frustrated. If any chink dehisce, and admit any flame, or
fume, they presently obstruct it: The Clusters of of the Pine thus aestuating
by the heat of the fire, emits Pitch copiously into certain channels
artificially structed, which carry it to troughs, and they to other vessels,
set on purpose to receive the torrent. Now it acquires its Nigretude by the
fume and heat, whence it is called Black Pitch: for, that which is flave, is
rather Rosine then Pitch.

That which extills first, is more fluid and humid, which the shopmen call
Liquid Pitch: Pliny calls it Cedria; Dioscorides, Pisselaeon; which is rightly
so had, by separating the aqueous humor, which saims upon the Pitch, as Cream
upon Milk. Now it is best separeted, while the Pitch is cocting, by suspending
a clean fleece of wool in the fume of the Pitch, which will become madid
therewith; and that we call Pisselaeon may be expressed out of it: which is not
properly a simple medicament, but rather a compound of Pitch and Oil.

That which comes out second, is more crass and dry, and the last most crass,
and hardest, and most efficaciously exsiccative.

There is another kind of suaveolent liquid Pitch, which Seplasuries call
Oleum Cadinum; sometimes Tar; which is most used upon Sheep and Cattle.

Seeing all Pitch is either liquid, or more sicce; the sincere, light, and
splendent in both kinds, is most laudable; the liquid mollisies, digests,
abates dolor, cocts, moves snot, extricates the nails from scabrosity, emends
Ring-worms, Vires.
discusses the hardness of the Matrix and Fundament: the dryer performs the
same effects, but more imbecilly; but it siccates more potently, and is more
accommodated to agglutinate wounds and ulcers.

CHAP. 3. Of Turpentine.
THe true Turpentine, is had from the Turpentine-tree, which the Greeks call
Termintho; for it is a fat liquor, flowing from its boughs and trunk: The best
is clear, pellucid, white, sharp, and odorate. That also which has these
qualities, and is somewhat flave, is good. That which comes from the Island
Chios, and is thence called Chia, is most celebrated, for its antecellency in
odor and gust: The next is the Lybian Turpentine, as Andromachus himself
attests; the next is the Pontian Turpentine: The less celebrous are the
Cyprian, Syrian, Indian, and Arabic Turpentines.

The Turpentine-tree is concocted, fructious, and of a mean magnitude, with a
crass caul, many and oblong boughs, long leaves, like them of an Ash; many
cohering to one pedicle, but crasser and fatter, each of them seeming like a
Laurel leaf: its flowers are very small, mossy, and purpureous; its fruits
small, racemously cohering, round, oblong, hard, fat, and rosmous, infecting
the contrectants hand.

It bears also certain oblong Cods, incurvated like Cornicks; wherein certain
little Vernicles, like Gnats, are included; and sometimes a certain humor, as
in the vescicles of Elms: The marter of its wood is viscid, and not hard; its
roots are valid, and deep.

One sort of the Turpentine-tree is masculine, which is sterile; another foe
minine, which is soecund: and this, for the various color of its fruit, is
twofold; the one hears red fruit, of the magnitude of Lentills; the other
greater, pallid, and more fragrant.

It grows copiously in hot Regions, and germinates most floridly there, where
its liquor mutuates cognominations, as in Chies, Cypr^s, Syria, about Ida, and
Macedonia. Some there are that avouch, That hard, dry Turpentine, so concreted
by the help of fire, is brought over and fold with us for Rosine. But I think,
that none will coct Turpentine to lose by it, unless he be out of his senses:
for Turpentine, be it how it will, is always in more esteem, and at a higher
rate then Rosine, be it concreted with all the industry and helps that can be.

There flows a certain humid Rosine out of Larch-tree, which being like
Turpentine, is often sold to our Merchants in stead thereof: But Larigna is
sharp in odor, gust, and faculties; and also of more tenusious parts, and more
discussive then Turpentine.

Turpentine is the Prince of Rosines, Mastick is the next, and then the Rosine
of Fur and Pitch-tree; after which, we enumerate Pine-Rosine: yet Galen
prefers Mastick before Turpentine.

Turpentine is the mildest of Rosines, Vires.
the most familiar Balsame for wounds; it califies moderately, mollifies,
expurges, discusses, purges the reins, moves urine, and is an excellent
praesidy for many uses. They know what eximious faculties it has, who labor
under a virulent flux of Sperm.

CHAP. 4. Of Frankincense.
FRankincense is the rofinous lachryma of a certain arbuscle in Arabia, which
the Incolists call sometimes Conder, sometimes Lovan: whereof there are two
forts; the one is Masculine Frankincense, which is somewhat flave, limpid,
pellucid, fat and dry; in purity emulating the Cedar-Rosine; in Nitre, it is
succe: it may be it is called Olibanum Thw, because it comes from the Mount of
Lebanon, with the Greek article before it.

The other is the Foeminine Frankincense, which is more rosinous, soft, and
liquestible, which yields in bonity to the former: They both flow out of a
Plant, scarce known, save by some notes, because it is peregrine, growing in
Arabia, with leaves like the Mastick-tree: whereof there are two forts; the one
montanous, which fruticating only on rocky and rough Mountains, bears the best
frankm^^cense; the other growing more copiously in plain places, emits
Frankincense in much more abundance, but not so good: both of them are easily
dissoluble in Oil.

The bark of the Frankincense-tree, is crass, fat, odorate, light, smooth, and
without membranes: it is endued with the same faculties, but more hot,
astrictive, and of crasser parts then Frankincense.

Manna thur is, is that same dust or powder which is elicited from Frankincense
by Collision in carriage, or the like, as we have ^^ed before. Frankincense is
both introsumed, Vires.
and applied extransecally with much success; for it is endued with innumerable
exitious faculties, which to recenseate, would require too much of time and
labor. It califies in the second degree, siccates in the third, and moves
Phlegm, but not very efficaciously.

Manna thuris is astrictive, because of that portion of Frankin^^se that is
mixed with it; from which it differs, in that it is not so potently astrictive,
nor coctive.

CHAP. 5. Of Belzoin.
BElzoin is neither a species of the succe of Laserpitium, nor of Cyraniacum,
nor yet of Myrrh, as some contend; nor yet the rosinous succe of Angelica, as
Ruellius seems to intimate. For Laser, or Asa, comes from Syria, Cyrenene, and
India, into other Regions; (...) from Samatra, Sian, and other Regions, into
India; which grows not on a ferulaceous plant, but a tall tree, whose caul is
crass, h^rd, brachiated with many boughs, very orderly disposed, and laterally
extended; its leaves oblong and mucronated, like Lemmontree leaves, but not so
green; for their averse part is whitish; its wood is hard and odorate.

It grows spontaneously in many woods, both in Malaca and other Regions:
whereunto, the frequency of Tigers hinders address.

Where these fierce animals are more rare, the trees are vulnerated by the
Incolists, which effuse copiously this odorate Rosine, which the Chineans call
Cominhan, the Arabians Lovaniaoy; the Incolists of Guzarata and Decan, Udo.

There are three sorts of Belzoin: Species.
the one called Almond-Belzoin, because it is maculated like condited Almonds,
which is most expetible: the other two sorts are very black; the one whereof is
not very fragrant, and more vile; the other very fragrant, which exudes from
new trees, and is by the Incolists of Samatra called, Benini de Boninas: the
best, is that which is pellucid, referted with white spots, like Frankincense,
and most fragrant.

Belzoin roborates the heart, spirits, and all its faculties: it is a good
ingredient in sweet Antidotes, Vires.
and Medicaments composed for ornament. It is dissoluble, as other Rosines, in
oleaginous liquors.

CHAP. 6. Of Euphorbium.
EUphorbium, derived its Name from Euphorbus King Juba's Doctor; which it
retains till this day. Dioscorides says, its tree is a kind of ferula
pregnant with most sharp succe; whose extreme fervor the Incolists fearing,
they circumligate the tree with sheepskins, and vulnerate its boughs with long
spears; out of which wounds flows copious succe into the skins, which there
concretes.

But Dodoneus thinks it is not a tree, but rather an herb, with oblong, crass,
and green leaves, rotundly angulous, armed with two sets of white pricks; which
leaves sauciated, effund a most sharp and mordacious liquor, which is easily
concreted: for, as Galen writes, it is caustical and vulnerative, and so
califies and extenuates, that therein it exuperates all concrete liquors.

It being thus acrimonious, and very tenuious, it cannot be pulverated without
great molestation: wherefore Pharmacopolists commit it to rusticks, and men of
low degree, to bray; charging them to avert their heads from its halite: Yet
they escape not its ferity; for their brain and noses are moved by its dust and
vapor, to sternutation, heat, heat and dolor. Its plant at first seems an
herb, but by years grows to a tree.

Besides its eximious heat and acrimony, it is somewhat purgative, Vires.
educing not only phlegm, but water; yet it is never introsumed at the mouth
alone, nor mixed with others, save in very small quantities.

CHAP. 7. Of the Rosine of the Ethiopian Olive, improperly called Gum Elemni.
THat fat liquor which shop-men call Gum Elemni, is no Gum, but a Rosine,
which will easily take flame, and dissolve in cleaginous liquors. Dioscorides
says, it is like Scammony, but more flave; turgent with small stillicides, no
whit vellicating the tongue, nor mordacious to the gust: whence, it is
probable, he means of another lacryma, and not of this vulgar one, which the
vulgar Pharmacopolists call Gumme-Elemi; it stills out of the Ethiopian Olive,
and when it is concreted into lumps, is brought to us.

It califies, mollifies, digests, resolves, cocts, draws to supperation,
allayes dolor, and is very good for permistion, with many unguents and salves.

Our Olives, and whilde-Olives, eructate such a kind of lacryma, but neither
so copious, nor commendable, yet is a good liniment for hebetude and whiteness
in the eyes: and if it be assumed, it mores fluors, and extracts the young; but
I would not have it introsumed, if it be poison, as Dioscorides makes it.

There is a kind of Rosine brought out of New-Spain, which the Indians
vernacularly call Tacamahaca, like Gumme-Elemi, Tacamahaca.
so vulgarly nominated. The Indians use it very much, to coct, digest, resolve,
and allay frigid humors. Nic. Manard, recenseates many of its faculties, (L.
de Simpl.)

There is another sort of fat, oleaginous, and tenacious Rosine, related to
Tacamahaca, which the Indians call Laranna, Laranna.
who use it in humors, and all kind of dolours. But seeing we determine not
to treat of all Rosines, but only of such as are usurped in our Antidotary, we
will put an end to this Section.

SECT. IX. Of gummeous Rosines.
ALL concrete liquors, erupting from ferulacious Plants, Fruits or Trees, that
are to be washed with water, are denominated (and not without reason) Gummes;
because they have their original from a certain fubstance, that will easily
admit of dissolution; and therefore they are enumerated in the regiment of
Rosines; as, Mastick, Camphyr, and Storex, and many others: which sometimes are
called Gummes, and sometimes Rosines: Concerning which, we intend to speak in
this following Section with much brevity.

CHAP. 1. Of Mastick.
MAstick is the best of gummeous Rosines; it exudes from the Lentisk: that
which comes from Chios, and is odorate, candid, splendent, fryable, adulte, and
scorched, is best; the green, and black, like Bitumen, are worse. Theophrastus
says, That the spine Ixina exuctates Mastick; but that of the Lentisk is best
for medicinal uses (if there be any other.)

The Lentisk is a very rall tree, by the Greeks called (...), from whose root
branches erupt like Hasle sprigs, brachiated with tough and flexible boughs:
its leaves cohere by eight together upon one pedicle, which are like them of
Liquoris, but harder: its flowers are mossy, and many, adhering to long
pedicles, whereunto berries of the magnitude of Vetches, succeed; which at
first are green, by maturity black, of a fat substance, and turgent, with a
black and hard Nut.

There grow upon Lentisks, besides their flowers, leaves, and fruits, certain
Utricles intorted like Cornicles, wherein a certain liquor is contained, which
produces some insects like Gnats, as in Elms, vesicles.

Its wood will make special tooth-picks, which will not only purge, but
roborate the teeth, constringe the gums, and conciliate sweetness of breath:
its eximious faculties make it a good substitute for Xylobalsame.

Lentisks will scarce fruticate in Lutetia; yet I saw two in Jo: Gonerius his
Garden, but they could scarce tolerate the Winters rigidity.

Mastick is celebrated for many things, but especially for allaying the dolours
and affections of the stomach and ventricle; which does either by assumption or
admotion: it takes away all loathsomness toward meat, roborates the retentive
faculty, and helps coction: it cures such as spit blood, or are infested with
an inveterate Cough: it emands the breath, if commanducated, and gently tracts
phlegm from the brain: it should be sprinkled with a little Rose Water, that it
may be pulverated; it will easily dissolve in aqueous and oleaginous liquors.

CHAP. 2. Of Camphyre.
CAmphyre is neither Bitumen, nor Medulla, nor compound Medicament, as some
believe; but a certain pellucid gummeous Rosine, unknown to Dioscorides and the
ancient Greeks, flowing from a peregrine tree, which Garcias ab Horto says, is
like a Walnut-tree, but its leaves are more candicant: The matter of its wood
is cinericious, or somewhat blacker; not light or fungous, but pretty dense and
solid.

This tree is tall, with boughs on every side, and of a fair aspect, which
eructates lacrymae; no whit more copiously when it thunders and corruscates,
then when the heaven is serene, as many think.

This lacryma flows through the chinks of the tree, like other Gummes: it needs
no coction to concilitate candor; for if dust, filth, or the fragments of any
stones or wood be mixed with it, that happens through the oscitancy and error
of the collectors: the sincere splendent and odorate is best.

Hereof there are two sorts; the one, Camphyre de burneo, which is best, and is
seldom or never brought to us; the other, Species.
Camphyre of China: whence Pharmacopolists have it frequently: it is of much
use in those Regions where it grows, so that they sometimes use it amongst
their meats.

Some assert, That it califies in the third degree; others affirm, That it is
frigid: Many reasons might be brought for both, which for brevity sake I omit;
and attest, That it is good both in hot and cold diseases: for it is of a mist
quality, and seems by its odor and tenuity of its spirit to be calid, though
its other qualities demonstrate its frigidity.

Many think, that Camphyre arceates the stimulations to venery, and hinders
conception: Whereupon, Scaliger being not too credulous, made trial thereof,
and found all to be false. Camphyre may be easily pulverated, with the addition
of a little water: it is eafrly dissolved in aqueous, oleaginous, and fat
liquors.

CHAP. 3. Of Storax.
STorax is the gummeous and rosinous concrete and dry succe of a certa in
Syrian tree, none whereof is liquid, humid, and fluxile, as some have judged,
who constituted two sorts of Storax, to wit, the humid, and the sicce, both
flowing from one tree: But the storacifluous tree distills only a coagulable
lacryma, which presently concretes to a dense, fat, and rosinous lump: no
portion turning into fluxile liquor, as the old and false opinion of the
Arabians avers, whose defendants were deceived by the affinity of the word
Storax and Stacte, which in consistency, odor, sapour, quality, original and
nature, Stacte, Quid?
are far dissident: For Stacte is the pinguetude of new Myrrh, tunded and
expressed with a little water, and reducted to the liquid form of an unguent;
or rather, the fat creamy Gum of Myrrh, or the fat Oil of Myrrh tunded and
expressed; or its succe educed by some tortive instrument.

The Stacte which is oleous, is best; it participates not only of the
calefactive quality, but many other faculties of Myrrh.

As soon as Storax erupts out of the tree, it concretes into a hard, dense,
solid, and rosinous lump, with some white spots in it, and very fragrant. That
which comes from Pamphilia in reeds, and is fat, viscid, white with spots, and
of a persevering odor, is best; the furfurous, hoary, and inodorate, is
naught. There comes also very good to us from Cyprus, Sidon, and Pisidia.

It eructates out of a tree, like a Quince-tree, but its leaves are lesser,
less rigid, and hoary on the averse part: its flower is white, of the magnitude
of an Orange-tree's flower, but not so in odor: small berries included in
three ungles, and adhering to long pedicles, grow on its surcles. The concreted
liquor of this tree, is much celebrated, which besides the aforesaid qualities,
permanes very long suaveolent.

Storax califies, Vires.
mollifies, concocts, cures the Cough, heaviness, hoarsness; and whether
introsumed or applied, opens the Matrix, and moves flowers: it is a good
ingredient for cordial and laetificative Antidotes; it is adverse to such
poisons, as hurt or kill by refrigeration. By way of liniment, it discusses
swellings in the neck, and knots of sinews.

AN APPENDIX. Of gummeous Rosines improperly so called.
There are certain concrete liquors, which fall within the verge of our
Institutions, which do possess a medium between the nature of Gum and
Rosines; neither are they so easily nor speedily dissolved with water, as some
are; nor with oil, as others: but either they subside, or burn to the bottom,
or else grow harder; and so thereby are more averse from commixion: Of which
sort are Bdellium and Myrrh.

CHAP. 4. Of Myrrh.
Myrrh, which the Greeks call Smyrna, is the concreted gummeous succe of a
certain tree, growing in many Regions in Arabia, as Sabe, Adramyta, Citibaena,
and Mamali. This myrrhifluous tree is of a moderate magnitude, with a hard caul
contorted toward the earth; smooth back like Purslain, and aculeated leaves
like an Elm. Dioscorides makes it like the Egyptian Spine; others like the
Turpentine-tree: Diodorus assimilates it to the Lentisk; yet so, as it is more
spinous and lower, for it is seldom above five Cubits light.

It grows most frequently in saboulous, dry, and incultivated places, but most
floridly in cultivated soyls: They incide it from the root to its boughs, out
of which wounds it emits Myrrh; but it spontaneously distills a kind of
stillatitious dew before its back be opened, which they call Stacte, and many
imperite Pharmacopolists, Liquid Storax; falsely asserting, That it distills from
the same Tree. But we have before declared, that they flow from different
trees, and that there is no liquid Storax, unless that we call Stacte, whic his
no Storax.

But I return to Myrrh, and the arbuscle from which it flows, which is
exotical and prergrine, rough, spinous, with sharp and reuleated leaves, and in
sapour like Juniper: It delights and fruticates copiously, in the same soil and
region with Frankincensetrees: its wound elacrymates a coagulated Gum, of the
same name with the tree. That which is fragile, smooth, concolorate in small
lumps, amare, acrimonious, odorate, and has veins candid, and smooth like
nails, is best.

That which is collected of the sative tree, is better then that of the
sylvestrian: but that is preferred before all, which bears the name of the
place where it is had, and is called Troglodytical Myrrh, which is somewhat
green of color, splendent, and mordacious.

There is one sort they call Pediasimos, another Gaby; both which are good, and
emit plenty of Stacte. There are two bad sorts, one they call Caucalis, which
is black and torched; the other Ergasima, which is the worst, it is macilent
and hoary: there is also another called Mynaea, as ill as can be.

There is so much affinity betwixt Myrrh and Bdellium, that many think they do
not differ: but the contrary shall be proved by and by; both of them may be
dissolved in watery and oleous liquors, but neither accurately nor easily.

Myrrh califies and siccates in the second degree, Vires.
opens the occluded Matrix, moves flowers, and accelerates the deliverance of
young: Commanducated, it emends the graveolence of the mouth.

Stracte, which is much celebrated for its suavity and efficacy, may be
substituted for Opobalsamum, but Stracte is more rare: it roborates the stomach
and principal parts, arceates putretude, recreates the spirit, and cures many
diseases from the Uterus and brain.

CHAP. 5. Of Bdellium.
THere is a tree in Bactria, which is black, of the magnitude of an Olive, with
leaves like an Oak, and fruit like a Fig Tree, not insuave, whose lacryma some
call Brochon, some Malathram, others Maldacon, and the Pharmacopolists Bdellium.

That which is amare to the gust, translucid when broken, fat when rubbed and
incended, odorate, liquestible, like Wax, or Bulls-glue, soft, and void of
sordidity, is approved. Galen commends the Scythian, Pliny the Bactrian,
Dioscorides the Saracenian Bdellium.

The Indian, sordid, black Bdellium, convolved into gobbets, is the worst: some
call it Adrobolon; that which grows in Media, called by Physicians, Parthian
Bdellium.

Furthermore, out of what tree Bdellium exudes, is not concluded of amongst
grave and learned men; some say it flows from one like that which emits Myrrh;
other affirm the contrary: Neither can I at present determine this doubtful
cause. Perhaps they both come from plants much alike, one from a sative tree,
the other from a wild one; as we see many Apples, Pears, and Plums, much
different in odor, color and sapour, which grow on trees very much agreeing.
However, Bdellium is no whit rare, and we have it as good as ever the Ancients
designed it.

It califies, Vires.
mollifies, resolves, it discusses hardness, and gurtural tumors, and humid
burstings; it relaxates the spiracles of the Matrix, either by admotion or
suffumigation; it extracts floors, young, and all humors. Being drank, it
breaks the stone, and expels urine; it is excellent for mixture with a Pultess,
against the hardness and knots of sinews.

SECT. X. Of other humors and juyces arising from Plants.
THe humor of Plants ( says Theophrastus) by an usual Nomenclature, called
Juice, is the proper blood of the Plant; which if the Plant wants, it withers
and perishes, but if it abounds, it waxes young and flourishes: but this succe
or humor, is various, according to the variety of the Plant. For in some it is
crass, liquid, viscid, glutinous, fryable, gummeous: In others, fat, oleous,
odorate, rosinous: In some, melleous, lacteous, salsuginous, as we have
declared before. Of gummeoue, rosinous, and oleaginous Juyces, we have spoken
sufficiently before. It remains nor, that we treat of other Juyces more gross
and terrestrial.

CHAP. 1. Of Opium.
POppy is either sative or wild, of both which there are many species: the
succe expressed and concreted from the satives, is called Meconium; Meconium.
only the lacryma or succe of the black Poppy, whether spontaneously, or by
vulneration, eructing from its heads, is for its dignity by the Greeks called
(...), by the Latins Opium.

Whereof there are many varieties, respondent to the varieties of the Regions
where it is collected. The Theban Opium, and that which is brought from Cairus,
are whitish, and the best; those that come out of Syria, Alexandria, and other
Regions, are black, and not so good: the latter Writers also assert, That the
best Opium flows from white Poppy. That which comes from Cambaia, flows from
the great Poppy, there called Carcax; each of whose heads equalizes in
magnitude an Estriches Egg: so that it is no wonder, that such plenty of succe
should erupt from them when vulnerated.

All agree not about the qualities of Opium: for Dioscorides, and many more,
say, it is cold in the fourth degree; Its qualities.
Matthiolus opposes them, from its odor and acrimony. I think, it is of a mist
quality, participating of a light and fugacious calidity, but a more valid and
contumacious frigidity.

Besides its elementary qualities, it has others also, which much commend it,
if exhibited opportunely, and in a just dosis, and much discommend it, if
unduly used; for it does not only induce tremour and palsy, but leads to a
perpetual sleep.

Rightly prepared, and rightly administered, it helps much; for it cures
perpetual watchings, by conciliating sleep; it allayes and deceives the
fierceness of any dolor, by making the sense more stupid.

It is much used in Mauritania and Asia, where they call it Amfium and Osium,
as though Opium were the most admirable exhilarator of the mind, and erecter
of the body: whereunto they have so accustomed themselves, that if they should
totally abstain from it, they would periclitate their lives.

The Turkish Soldiers used to eat it, that they might be more cheerful for
battle, and like drunken or madmen, precipitate themselves carelessly into
danger.

Some think it stimulates to venery; but reason and experience refragate its
use, rather arceating its heat, by making the motion of the flesh more ignave.

CHAP. 2. Of Elaterium.
ELaterium is numerated among mochlical Medicaments, which agitate the body by
a turbulent motion; which though it be violent, yet Hippocrates used it ( Sect.
2. Lib. de loc. in hom.) Now it is seldom usurped, except in a few Regions in
Italy, where some take it, for the curation of such diseases as milder remedies
will not profit.

Elaterium, according to Theophrastus, is the inspissated succe of a wild
Cucumer, which by a special propriety will keep two hundred years; it is (says
he) the most diuturnal of all Medicaments; and that is best which is oldest:
which to experience, a certain Medick having received some for a gift, very
old, kept it till its two hundred years were expired. The cause why it endures
so long, I think is its copious humor, whereby it extinguishes a Candle, if it
be set near it, till fifty years be perfected. The manner of its extraction and
inspissation is notorious; which he that knows not, may learn of Dioscorides.

Wild Cucumer, which we call anguine or asses Cucumer, is very like the
sative, only its leaves are not so angulous, and more hoary: its fruits are
lesser, palely green, and full of seeds and succe, which leap out at the first
touch, like siliquous Arsmart, which they thence call Nolime tangere.

The wild Cucumer, Vires.
and succe of its fruit, which they call Elaterium (says Galen) are
accommodated to Medicine: The succe is very amare, hot in the second degree; it
moves flowers, kills young, and by moving the belly educes waters.

CHAP. 3. Of Ladanum.
LAdanum is a kind of liquor exuding out of the leaves of Cistus, growing in
Cyprus, where it is called Ledon; which, if Dioscorides say true, is collected
by the she-goats: for the Kids and Goats feeding upon the leaves of Cistus,
whose innate pinguetude in the springtime they deterge and receive with their
beards, and carry it on their hairy legs, whereunto it adheres; which
afterward the Incolists kemb off, and percolate, making it into lumps, and so
keep it, calling it Ladanum.

Some reject this manner of accepting Ladanum, as fabulous, and yet substitute
not an easier way. It is indeed so tenacious and viscid, that it will easily
follow contact, and may be excerped otherwise.

The Cyprian, odorate, greenish, soft Ladanum, that has not gathered sand and
filth, is the best: The Arabian is more vile, and worse.

It is calefactive, and mollifies, opens the orifices of the veins, Vires.
mixed with black Wine, Myrrh, and Oil of Myrtle: it keeps on deciduous hair.

It flows not from Cissus, that is, Ivy, as Pliny thought, but Cistus, a small,
surculous, lignous shrub, emitting long and blackish leaves, glutinous to the
tact, which in the Spring exude a certain fat, odorate, and rosinous matter,
which collected by any Art, is called Ladanum: It bears small whitish flowers,
like little Roses.

CHAP. 4. Of Hypocistis.
BEsides Ledon, or the Ladanigerous Cistus, there are two other varieties; the
one Masculine, Cistus masc.
out of whose roots springs Hypocistis, whose spurious branch is like to a
Quince-tree: some call it Ludonorum, others Robethron, Fuschius fungus; its
succe is extracted, as that of Acacia concreted and kept.

The other Cistus is Foeminine; which bears long, Cistus foem.
and not angust leaves, white and small flowers, and small seed in a triangular
hull: it is very like the Ladanigerous Cistus.

The Masculine Cistus is a small shrub, greater then Thyme, with leaves like
Basil, but rounder, rosaceous flowers, like them of the Foeminine, but lesser,
with a lignous and hard root, out of whose middle, Hypocistis pullulates, as
viscum out of an Oak, and other trees.

Hypocistis is very rare, in whose stead we use Acacia, Vires.
whose saculties are analogous, though more imbecil: it is chiefly astrictive;
it helps the Dysenterian, collical, and all fluxes of blood. It siccates also,
and roborates, and is a very efficacious remedy in all fluxions.

CHAP. 5. Of Tartar.
AS the substance of Milk, part whereof is butyrous and ligher, part caseous
and crasser, and part serous and moderate, is not homogeneous; so neither is
the substance of Wine, part whereof is tenuious, and is called the flower of
Wine; part somewhat heavier, occupying the middle of the Hogshead; and part
more crass, which settles to the bottom, which some call Lees, and the more
recent, Tartar; perhaps because this is the Empyricks Idol, as Tartac was the
Hevaeans. But I rather think it so nominated, because it possesses the lowest
place.

And though Tartarum be but Lees of Wine, yet is it endued with many faculties:
for as some excrements in an humane body are benign and useful, as Sperm,
Milk, and other humors included in other parts for certain uses; so are these
dregs useful: for as the Proverb goes, No Wine without Lees; for this excrement
conserves it longer from corruption, as ashes do fire from extinction.

Tartarum included in a Cloth-bag, and suspended in a Winecellar, or other
moist place, will exude an oleous humor, which they call Oil of Tartar: which
delabes from the Canvas bag into the vessel subjected, as we have showed in our
Officinary. It may be educed also by ascent; but the work will be more, and to
less purpose.

The ashes of burned Tartar is frequent at Paris, and very expetible to
dealbate sayls, which the vulgar call Gravellata. It is celebrated for many
other uses: Vires.
for Tartar, according to Cardanus, has no equal in detersion, which purges
sordid and hard lumps, and excrescencies of flesh, and shows the sound and
living flesh.

CHAP. 6. Of Liquorice Juice.
THe succe of Liquorice is expetible for many uses; for it is eximiously
bechical, being successfully assumed solarly for the affections of the lungs
and breasts, and frequently with no less benefit mixed with other Medicaments.
Galen extols that which comes from Crete.

The Greeks call it Glycyrrhiza, the shop-men Liquorice, Celsus Sweet-root, the
Batavians Sweet-wood; for its succe exhibits a sweet and grateful sapour, which
is thus educed.

The roots of Liquorice collected in July, while new and humid, are purged and
brayed, then cocted in water, percolated and expressed; the succe expressed is
siccated by evaporation by the fire, The way to juice of Liquorice.
or Sun, and kept: That is best, which is sweetest, soft, new, pure, tenacious,
blackest, and which is totally liquescible upon the tongue.

That which comes from Spain, is much commended; where it is made both
copiously and well.

Liquorice is without of the color of Box, within croceous: its wood is
viscid, and not easily frangible; its sapour sweet, quenching thirst; whence it
is called, adipsas. That which is white or black within, exucce, old, fragile,
and which makes dust by its fracture, is not good. We have spoken hereof in the
fourth Section of our first Book.

CHAP. 7. Of Wax.
BEes are wonderful sagacious, industrious, and sedulous, in collecting and
confecting Wax; which without their help, no part of the world can perform: for
these little animals can solely act that which man cannot; these Infects solely
do suppeditate both Aliments and Medicaments to man by their own opifice.

And yet the commodities of Wax are so many, and so great, that they cannot be
easily recenseated. The flave, odorate, moderately fat, pure, coacted Wax,
which is void of all aliene matter, eadnearest representing Honey, is best. In
the second place, we take that which is candid, whether it be so naturally; as
the Pontian Wax, or artificially by lotion, as the Tyrrhenian. Other colors
are acquisititious; as green by Verdegrease, red by Vermillion, black by Ink,
or burned paper: From which mixture it changes its qualities. New subflave
Virgin-wax is best.

It is in a mean betwixt heat and cold, humidity and siccity; yet it is
somewhat crass and emplastical: Wherefore it is the matter both of calefactive
and refrigerative Medicaments. All Wax mollifies, califies, according to
Dioscorides; Cerae lotio and dealbatio
and moderately expletes the body. It is good in broth for such as have the
bloody flux. That it may be dealbated, it must be melted at the fire, then
demerged in pure Fountain Water, where it must be stirred and expurged.
Dioscorides describes another way to make it most candid; which see in his
second Book, Chap. 105.

CHAP. 8. Of certain other succes more aptly described in another place.
SUcces are kept either in a liquid consistency, as Vinegar, Wine, and
Omphacium; or in a solid one, as Aloes and Scammony; or else in a middle
consistency, as Rob and Sapa: of each whereof we have treated in order, partly
in our Shop, partly in our first Book of Medicinal Matter.

And since I am so far from approving of things ten times repeated, that the
second time offends me, I will not now return to the examination of what I have
before delivered; for I could willingly wish this short Work had been
contracted into a lesser bulk.

As for Aloes and Scammony, they being Purgatives, we have treated sufficiently
of them in the second Section of this Book: wherein we have accurately
described the nature and faculties of all purgative Simples.

As for the succes of fruits, inspissated to the consistency of Rob and Honey,
we have handled them in the fifth Section: and the first Section of the first
Book, speaks copiously of liquid succes.

Opopanax has its name from Panax, whose succe, or rather gummeous liquor it
is, which when concrete and dry, is subflave without, candid within,
graveolent, smooth, fat, fryable, and easily liquescible in water.

Galen makes mention of other succes, as Glacium and Licium: but because they
grow obsolete, they are seldom or never kept in Pharmacopolies.

Finis Libri Primi.
THE SECOND BOOK OF Medicinal Matter.
SECT. I. Of Minerals.
THE PREFACE.
THe matter of Medicaments is multifarious, not only because it arises from
Plants, Minerals, and Animals, (of which we have treated before) but also
desumed from the Universal Tribe of Plants. It remains now, that we treat of
Minerals, which indeed do daily supply us with plentiful matter for Medicine;
and that sometimes melioris defectu, of eximious qualities, whereby we oppugn
and resist contumacious diseases of their malignity; but especially, I say, for
outward uses, nothing more excellent; and very conducible to the health and
sanity of inward parts: For there are certain Minerals, which by a roborative
faculty do recreate the spirits; as, the Lemnian Earth, Oriental Bole, and
Precious Stones: Of all which we intend briefly, but clearly, to treat in this
our second Book.

And although they are called Minerals or Fossiles, which are dug out of the
bowels and hidden Caverns of the earth; as, all kinds and sorts of Earths,
Stones, and Metals: yet they carry a more ample signification, and do
comprehend under them, all that is found in the Bosom and Belly of the Sea, in
Gulfs, and on the Seashore; as all sorts of Salt and Bitumen. Therefore all
Minerals are not only of the Earth, as Aristotle has delivered, but some of
the Sea; as Salt, Bitumen, and several kinds of Stones: of which we intend
distinctly to Treat. But the method of our Institutions does require us, that
we handle them briefly; therefore we shall hasten to the examination of them,
and Rank them into a Treble File, by dividing this our Book into three
Sections: In the first, we shall dispute the Nature and Qualities of Earths; in
the second, of Stones; and in the third, of Metals.

CHAP. 1. Of Terra-Lemnia.
THe best of medicinal Earths, is that, which coming from the Isle Lemnos, the
shop-men call Lemnian Earth, and sometimes Sigillated Earth, from that seal
that is impressed upon it. There are many varieties hereof; the best of which
used to be formed into Cakes, and signed by Diana's Priest with her Sigil,
which represented a She-goat.

But the true sigillated Earth, according to Dioscorides and Galen, is flave or
yellow, as the hill is whence it is dug; on which hill, neither Tree, nor
Herb, nor Plant fruticates, nor a stone to be seen, only this kind of Earth
in abundance.

Yet such Cakes are brought to Constantinople, of a cineritious color, noted
with the Sigil of the Turkish Emperor, which is effigiated with no Animal,
only some various Characters; and these are bought and kept for true Lemnian
Earth.

Neither the Incolists that make these Pastils, nor the Institors that buy
them, mix Goats blood therewith, as many grave men existimate.

This Earth is so far, that one that holds it in his mouth, and grindes it with
his teeth, would think it consisted of grease.

It is Antidotive against the Pestilence, Vires.
Contagions, and Diseases that participate of malignant qualities: yet I
believe, That the vain Ceremonies and Superstitions of the barbarous Turkish
Nation, have more nobilitated this Earth, then any excellency in its faculties:
and I do avouch, That if any one that would might effode it, it would lose much
of its celebrity.

The variety of the Characters wherewith it is noted, arises from the variety
of those Noblemen, who according to their custom, are present on the sixth of
August, at its effosion and sigillation. Now all the Characters are contained
in these two Arabic words, Tin Imachton, which denote Sigillated Earth.

CHAP. 2. Of Bolarmoniack.
THere is another kind of Earth of eximious faculties, which comes out of
Armenia, near Cappadocia, which the Medicks call Bole-arminack, or
Oriental-Bole. It was, in Galens time, much used against that Pestilence he
speaks of ( Lib. 9. Simp. cap. 7.) It is in our pleasure (says he) whether we
will call it a Stone, as he did that first gave it me, or an Earth, as I do,
because it may be rigated by humid things.

It comes not solely from Armenia, but many other Regions: that is the best,
which will be most promptly laevigated, either by a Pestel, or the affusion of
some water or liquor, containing in it no sandy mixture, and which in
manducation melts like butter, and is manifestly astrictive to the gust.

It siccates, astringes, and roborates, stays blood, Vires.
cohibits Catarrhs, profits the bloody flux, and Ulcers in the mouth.

It is very prevalent against the Pestilence: Whoever (says Galen) assumed
this Medicament, were presently cured; but those that this did not cure, dyed
all; for no other remedy was more prevalent. Whence we may gather, That it
cured all that were not incurable: and that I may speak freely, Bole-Arminack
is as efficacious as Lemnian Earth: And as we can easily be without the Turkish
Tapestry and Hangings; so shall we not much stand in need of their Lemnian
Earth.

CHAP. 3. Of some other Earths less usual.
THere are many other Earths commended by the Ancients, for refrigerating and
occluding passages, and much used by them in Medicine, which the later Age does
so despise, that they are totally excluded from Pharmacopolies, except some
few, which for their candor, rubour, or other eximious color, as flave, or
the like, which are commended and bought by infectors, as Ocre, Rubric,
Synope, Ceruss, and such like.

Yet some of them are endued with eximious medicinal faculties, as the Melitean
Earth; so called from the Isle Melita, Melitea.
whence it comes; which is prevalent against the Pestilence and Poisons: Whence
many usurp it for Lemnian Earth.

The Samian Earth is a kind of fossile coming from Samos, Samia.
which Dioscorides says, is of two sorts; the one he calls Collyrium, which, I
think, may be mixed in Collyries for eyes; the other Samius aster, because
there are certain spots in it, which shine like stars; it is crustaceous and
dense like a Wherstone, being withal somewhat viscous: This is burned and
washed like white Earth, of whose faculties it participates, and thence
cohibits the rejection of blood: the other, which he calls Collyrium, is soft,
white, fryable, and adheres to the tongue: both of them refrigerate, and
arceate fluxes.

The Chian Earth, so called from the Isle Chios, Chia.
has affinity with the Samian in face and faculties; for it is white, soft,
refrigerative, and astrictive: it cures burnings, crugates the face, makes it
splendid, and deleates scars.

There is another kind of Earth called Selinusia, Selinusia.
which Galen commends against swellings beginning in the Paps, Testicles, and
s^^ll Guts; which in color, faculties, and consistency, is finitimous to the
Chian: both are special Remedies against burnings.

Dioscorides makes mention of Fullers-earth, Cimolia.
whereof he constitutes two sorts; the one white, the other purpureous: that is
best, which seems fat and cold to the tact; both of them dissolved invinegar,
discusse-pimples and tubercles, repress inflammations, and cure burnings.

The Eretrian Earth is, Eretria.
according to Galen, a red Glebe; the best whereof, is without sand and stones.
Dioscorides makes two sorts thereof; one white, and another cineritious; none
red: that which is cineritious, is soft, and is the best. Eretria is a City in
Euboia, near Calcis, in whose Territories this Earth is effoded, and thence
nominated: it is astrictive, refrigerative, mollitive; it expletes cavities,
and conglutinates wounds.

Rubric, Rubrica.
or Vermillion, so called, because it is red, is called Synopica, from Synops a
City of Cappadocia, whence it comes; and Fabrilis, because workmen often use it
in drawing Lines, their cords being died therewith. Some Rubric is maculated,
other unicolorate; some soft, other hard and spisse; some fat, other moderate.
All of them are adapted to pictures; which, because they siccate and astringe,
serve sometimes to medicinal uses, and may be mixed in vulnerary and siccative
Emplasters.

Ocre is a kind of flave Earth, Ochra.
much commended in Attica, not lapideous, but fryable, luteous, and smooth: it
astringes, erodes, discusses collections, and represses excrescencies. Aetius
says, That bruises, and blue places, may be cured by a Medicament made thereof.

The Cretian Earth, or Chalk, is so called, from the Isle Crete, whence it
comes, though it is copiously found in other Regions; whereof there are many
varieties; one sort whereof is white, which exceeds all other Earths therein,
which Artificers use in protracting Lines; another green, celebrated for the
same use, which we ordinarily call Theodosia; another is black, which
workmen-Painters and Tailors use: All of them are abstersive; whence they are
much used in cleansing Tin and Silver vessels. The green is more acrimonious
then the white and black, and more abstersive then both.

Other Earths, as Pnigitis, Melia, and Ampelitis, are recorded in Dioscorides,
and mentioned by Galen: But their virtue is so ignave, and effects so small,
that the later Physicians do not celebrate them; who leaving Acorns, choose
rather to eat Whear. These therefore being useless, I will not describe.

There is a certain subrulous Earth carried about Lutetia, which they call
Alana and Tripolis, serving only to deterge brazen vessels: which here we will
omit.

Of certain Fossiles extracted either out of Sea or Land, which are referred
either to Metals, Stones or Earths: And first, CHAP. 4. Of Chrysocolle or Boras.
THe Shop-men following the barbarous Mauritanian Idiome, call Chrysocolle,
Boras: it is found in the golden, silver, and sometimes brazen Mines in
Armenia, Macedonia, and Cyprus. The Armenian Boras, whose color is green, and
sapour nitrous, with some amaritude, is most laudable. Pliny thinks, That that
which is effoded out of brazen Mines, whose substance is mud, concreted to the
hardness of a Pumick-stone, is best; that which is collected out of Silver
Mines, next; and that which is had in Golden Mines, worst of the three. There
is another sort, which is worst of all, found in Leaden Mines. Avincenna calls
Boras, Auri capistrum; Dioscorides and Galen, Chrysocolle, or Gold-glue;
others, Green Earth, because it equalizes segetives in color. That which is
now in Pharmacopolies, is not green, but white.

There are two sorts hereof: one Native, which in Metalline Mines concretes to
the hardness of a Pumick-stone, acquiring various colors, according to the
variety of the Metals, out of whose Mines it is effoded: the green is most
medicinal, and the flave best for ferruminating gold.

The other Factitious, made of Boys Urine, Factitia.
agitated so long with a Brazen Pestel, in a Brass Mortar in the hot Sun, till
it acquire the consistency of honey, or an unguent; which either solely, or
mixed with other Medicaments, cures sordid, cadaverous, and dangerous Ulcers.
Dioscorides brayed and washed the native and fossile, till it looked pure and
sincere; then he reconded, and kept it for use, after he had siccated it: it
will be much more tenuious by ^^tion.

Chrysocolle califies, cohibits excrescent flesh, Vires.
and is somewhat mordacious: it perduces many Ulcers to sanity, but its
assumption at the mouth is perilous.

CHAP. 5. Of Vitriol, or Calchantum.
THe Greeks call that Calchantum, which the Latins from its blackness call
Sutory Ink, and from its splendent vitreous Nitre, Vitriol.

Dioscorides reckons three sorts thereof; two native, and one Factitious:
Species.
one sort of the Natives is found concreted in the bowels of the earth, another
is collected in form of water, out of some Mine, which put into a vessel, soon
coagulates into Vitriol.

The Factitious is made of a certain glebe of earth, maculated with rubiginous
and atruginous: spots, madefied, transfunded, and fermented with water, cocted
with the heat of the Sun; out of which a certain vitriolous humor is elicited,
which is reduced either by the heat of the Sun, or of a fire, into Vitriol.
Pliny ( Chap. 13. Book 34.) teaches many more ways to confect it; as also many
perite Metallists, which for brevities sake I omit.

Amongst the Factitious Vitriols, the Roman is the best; the Cyprian was most
celebrated of old; the Germanian is worse: and it is commonly called Copparose,
or Dyers Ink, which Infectors use in dying clothes.

The Native, which is effoded out of the Cyprian Mountains, is called
Stalacticum, that is, stillatitious; and pectum, that is, concrete: so that the
natural, which is either coagulated before effosion, or coagulates quickly
after extraction from that Mountain; and the factitious, which is elicited out
of the earth of that Mountain, may be both called Cyprian Vitriol.

The Native or Fossile Vitriol, participates of Calcitis, Misy, and Sorry;
especially the Cyprian, which is concreted from green water, which continually
delabes from that Mountain into a Cave, washing Calcitis, Misy, and Sorry, and
spontaneously coagulating into Vitriol. Whence one of these does easily
transeate into another; for all of them do in time convene: yea, Galen asserts,
That he saw Vitriol, which in tract of time became Calcitis. ( Lib. 9. Simp.)

The Native and white, is preferred in Medicinal uses, which the Metallicolous
Alchymists say, is produced by their Sulphur and Mercury, as of Sperm, which
they indiscriminately exhibit to all affections: out of which they elicite a
certain acid liquor; a few drops whereof, mixed with syrup of Violets, acquire
a most elegant red color and sapour. Oil of Sulphur will do the same; and a
few drops of both, or one of them, infused in the syrup of Roses, will make
the whole liquor red, Tinctura Rosarum.
which they call Tincture of Roses.

There is a certain salve made, which Pharmacopolists call Diacalciteos, from
Calcitis, and Diapalma; or Palmeous salve, from Palm; and it is alike related
to both: for it neither admits of Calcitis, nor Palm, in its confection; but
so it is called for its rarity: for Calcitis, Misy, Sorry, Melanteria,
Diphryges, and many more, so much celebrated by the Ancients, are now unseen
and unknown. Whence Galen substitutes Vitriol in stead of Calcitis, into whose
nature age perduces it. And it may well be substituted in stead of Misy, Sorry,
and Melanteria, for all these are of near affinity, being similar in qualities,
but dissimilar in color and consistency.

Nature has enriched Vitriol with eximious faculties, which perite Physicians
have both experienced, and left described; as Dioscorides, Galen, Aelius,
Paulus, Aegineta, and Oribasius, who have nobilitated it with much celebration:
it califies, astringes, dries, kills broad worms in the belly, helps against
toad-poyson, preserves moist flesh, and contracts humors by absumption,
exarceates putretude, roborates the intimous parts; externally applied, it
astringes, purges Ulcers, causes wrinkles like Alome, with whom it has
relation. The Wells of Spada being endued with a Vitrioline quality, do
miraculously cure grievous and deplorable affections. Which excellent faculty,
they borrow from Vitriol, by whose energy they pervade all the tracts and
corners of all parts, everting what is hurtful, not hurting what is good;
binding what is more lax, relaxing what is bound; and inciding, melting,
attenuating, and expelling what is more crass. But besides these excellent
commodities, Vitriol has its incommodities also: for, it is ill for the
stomach, acrimonious, erosive, and vomitory; and therefore many Monks and women
give it sometimes in Wine, and sometimes in Rose Water, in uncertain weight,
against quotidian and quartane Agues: and indeed the Fever is often, by the
excitation of vehement vomiting, resolved. But this Medicament being imperitely
exhibited, proves often more formidable then the disease.

CHAP. 6. Of Alome.
ALome (says Pliny) is as it were the brine of the earth, whereof Dioscorides
makes three sorts; the round, the liquid, and the jagged or scissile: the last
is often called plumeous Alome; for they are so like in form, that they can
scarce be distinguished; yet they differ both in nature and qualities: for the
scissile is manifestly astrictive, and may be burned; but the plumeous is
acrimonious, Scissile plumeum.
and suffers not by fire. It seems to be the stone Amiantus, which, wood-like,
consists of many incursant Lines, and is not burned by fire, which many take
for that Amentus that ingredes the Citrian unguent.

There is another sort, very vulgar and usual, lucid, spisse, and hard, like
glass, which Physicians call Rock-Alome, Alumen rupeum.
which should always be usurped, when Alome is designed absolutely. The manner
of confecting this, is long and laborious, which Matthiolus describes
accurately. There is black Alome in Cyprus, that Pliny makes mention of.

Some say, that round Alome is the same with that they call Zucharinum, which
is confected of crude Rock-Alome, white of Eggs, and Rose Water. Matthiolus
saw, handled, and tasted liquid Alome: of which he attests, that he never found
any thing more astrictive.

Besides these, there are some factitious Alomes, as Catinum, which is made of
the ashes of Kali, and vulgar Soda; as squamous Alome, which is made of a
specular stone, pellucid like glass; as Lees-Alome, which is made of Wine-Lees
burned and albified. I think it superfluous to describe the manner of
confecting these Alomes, since they are now of no use.

All Alome is of crasse parts, Vires.
binds much: whence it is called Stypterion, because it is styptical or
astrictive: it califies moderately, cleanses, emends putrid Ulcers, dries humid
ones, absumes excrescent flesh, takes away itching, cures the scab, and accedes
usefully to many Medicaments made for Ulcers.

CHAP. 7. Of Salt.
AS nothing is more common, nothing more frequent; so nothing more known then
Salt: without which, Beasts can, but we cannot subsist. Whereof there are many
sorts; as Seasalt, Fossile-salt, Lake-salt, and River-salt.

Sea Salt is most common, and best, which is solely used in France.
Fossile-salt, which shop-men call Gemme-salt, is broken and effoded out of
Mines like stones; it is splendent like Crystal: This cast into the fire, does
not crack like the rest, but ignifies like Iron.

There is also Indian-salt, which Mesue uses in the confection of Pills of
Azure-stone: but this being wanting, we substitute gemmeous Salt. They mistake,
that think, that Mesue means by Indian-salt, that Sugar which he calls
Tabarzet; we, White: for the Indians have their Salt, which they effode from
the Mount Oromenus, in great lumps; in whose stead, our gemmeous Salt will
serve well, as in acuating the slower faculty of Agarick and Polypody.

Ammoniack, or Armeniack-salt, being very ungrateful both in sapour and color,
and gifted with no eximious faculties, is judged incommodious: it concretes
into broad plates under the Cyranium sands, with black veins extrinsecally; in
color it comes near Alome we call Schiston, as also the Salt we call Alkali
and Catinum.

Dioscorides commends Lake-salt, and Phrygian-salt; but we prefer our own.

The flower of Salt, which flows upon Nilus, is neither seen of nor desired by
us: it is as it were the Spawn of a certain River; as also the broth of Salt,
and the flower of the spamous Sea in Dioscorides.

There is another kind of Salt, they call Nitre, denoted with a double
difference; the first is the light Nitre, of Dioscorides and the Ancients: its
color is roseous or white; it gapes with some holes like a sponge, it ceases
now to be brought to us: the other is more vulgar, called Salnitre, or
Saltpeter, which ingredes the confection of that powder, which is made of many
nitrous waters in France for warlike Instruments.

While it is labored with much coction, it eructates Aphronitrum, or spume of
Nitre, different from that which the Ancients mention, which is thought to be
native, not artificial; as also a certain friable lanuginous matter, white and
saltish, which adheres to many walls, which is thought to be the flower of
Nitre. I shall not now speak of the confection of Nitre, because it appertains
not to Apothecaries.

The faculties of Salt are great, many, and very useful to man, but not so
necessary in Pharmacy, as many think, who praedicate many wonderful and vain
things, of Salt educed by Chemical Art; for they mordaciously assert, that
there is a purgative faculty in Medicaments because of Salt: and when they have
got some extract from any Medicament, they aver they have got its Salt.
However, Salt is very conservative; it astringes, absterges, purges, discusses,
represses, extenuates, and vindicates from putretude; yet some Salt is better
then other.

Seeing Brine is its liquor, it exhibits the same effects: Vires.
it is mixed with Glysters, to excite the expulsive faculty, which is flow in
such as are infested with the Lethargy and Apoplexy.

CHAP. 8. Of Bitumen.
BItumen, which the Greeks call Asphaltos, is as it were the fatness of the
earth swimming above the water; which cast upon the shore, condensates,
concretes, and becomes hard, tenacious, and inflammable. As long as Bitumen
swims on the water, it is soft; but when it is off, it becomes spisse and
harder then, and resembles dry Pitch, yet easily liquescible at the fire.

Many Lakes are bituminous, but especially one in Judaea, Sodomeus Lacus.
thence called Asphalites, and The dead Sea, because of its vastity, and
because its water remains almost immovable, not stormy, but heavy, falt, crass,
and foetid; wherein neither Plants nor Animals breed; neither does it nourish
such as are injected, or admit them into its bowels.

Some enumerate a kind of Fossile terrene matter, Carbo petrae
which some call, but falsely, The Earth Ampelitis; others better, Stone-coal,
which seems to be a kind of Jet, of which they make Beads and Images, which
strangers wear in their Hats, amongst solid Bituments.

All Bitumen is not solid and hard, but some there is, perpetually liquid and
fluid, called Naphta, which is the colature of Babylonian Bitumen, white of
color, and most capacious of fire: for there is so much cognation betwixt this
and fire, that it will presently leap into it, when near it. There is also
black Bitumen.

As the true and native Bitumen of Judaea and Sodom come not to us, in whose
stead we use Pissaphaltus, or factitious Bitumen, made of Petreol, Pitch, and
other things: so neither the true Naphta, in whose stead we assume a certain
liquor, that falls from the fields near Modena, which they call Petreol, as if
it were Oil educed out of a Rock; for both have the same cansistency, color,
and virtue: But Pissaphaltus is the commixion of Pitch and Bitumen, as its name
designs, which some use for Mumy: of which hereafter.

All Bitumen discusses, mollifies, glutinates, defends from inflammation, by
obfaction, suffumigation, or imposition; emends the Proptosis and strangulation
of the Uterus: but our Bitumen is seldom right.

Naphta extenuates, incides, digests, penetrates, absumes frigid and crasse
humors in all parts of the body, and cures the resolution of the Nerves,
Palsy, and diseases in the arteries from a cold cause.

Some yet recenseate more bitumens, as that furfurous pinguetude which some
call Whales-sperm, Sperma Caeti, quid.
others White-Amber, and many, The flower of the Sea; for it is collected on
the Sea, whose fat spume, or innatant flower it is. Many think it is
Dioscorides his (...).

CHAP. 9. Of Sulphur.
SUlphur is either native and fossile, called Brimstone and Quicksulphur; or
factitious: the native is naturally generated of a certain fat portion of
earth; much whereof is in Lipara, Melos, and such places, where the factitious
is made: the splendent, pellucid, and not saxous, is best; whose color without
is subcincritious, within subluteous.

Many Mountains are very sulphurous, as Aetna, which eructates perpetual
flames.

The factitious is made of some fat Glebes, which are effoded out of
sulphurous Mines. The manner of its confection, I leave to such Rusticks as
are exercised therein: the green and fat is best.

Sulphur has much cognation with fire; for if it be cast upon coals, it will
burn, and not be extinguished, till all its oleous and fat substance be absumed.

All Sulphur is not alike in color; for some is green, some more luteous, some
cineritious, and some pallid or lucid. Whence we may gather, That it is of more
sorts then two. Pliny also enumerates four, some whereof are harder, others
fatter, and others more inflammal.

That Sulphur whereof Alchymists tell many vain and ridiculous stories, is not
common Sulphur, yet it is mixed, though they assert, that it is a principle of
mixture. But no more of that in this place.

There is a certain fat liquor, very efficacious, Oleum Sulphuris.
educed out of Sulphur, yet such, as may not be used imperitely, lest it do
more harm then good. There is a powder also made of Sulphur, against the vices
of the Lungs, whose event demonstrates its excellency.

That Medicament which Mesue calls Diasulphur, is hence denominated.

Sulphur califies, cocts, resolves, cures Coughs, Vires.
and difficulty of breathing, taken in an Egg, or burned; and its smoke
catched, moves spittle; mixed with butter or swines-grease, it mitigates and
kills the itch, erupting on the whole body; and mixed with Turpentine, it cures
Tetters, rough nails, and scabs.

CHAP. 10. Of Amber-grise.
AMber-grise, which was unknown to the Ancients, is neither the seed of Balena,
nor excrement of any other Whale, nor yet the dung of any Birds educated in the
Isle Maldina, with odoriferous herbs (which dung is by the sea washed of those
Rocks, as some somniate;) nor yet any kind of maritimous Mushrome, eradicated
by the Sea, as many have asserted: nor yet any thing made of Ladanum, Aloes
wood, Storax, and Civer, as Fuschius credited; but a certain kind of Bitumen,
by storms driven from the Fountains and Channels of the Sea to the shore; where
exposed to the air, it speedily condenses; as many things do, which while they
are in the water, are soft and tender; but eructed, become dry, and hard, as
Amber.

Perhaps, as it is storied, a great quantity of Amber-grise has been found in
a Whales belly; but whilst she was alive, she had got it, and ingested it in
the Sea: for it is absurd to think, that Amber should be the Whales excrement,
when the best Amber devoured by a Whale, loses its bonity and suavity.

Which Simeon Sethi smelled well enough, who asserting that Amber is a kind of
Bitumen, flowing out of some Fountains, says, That that which is devoured by
fishes is the worst that can be.

Garcias ab Horto seems to assert, That it is a kind of odorate earth; seeing
there was not only a fragment of three thousand pounds weight of Amber found
in the earth, but whole Islands of pure Amber: and he proves the probability
hereof, from the infinite varieties of earth in color and qualities: and
seeing in this general acception, Bitumen may be called a kind of Earth, I do
nor impugn the verisimilitude of his assertion, especially finding it called
Precious Earth.

Thus have I briefly related the whole history of Amber: for I will neither
undertake, neither will my short annotations bear the discussion of such
opinions as have been published about Amber.

That Amber which is most odorate, devoid of filth, perforated with a needle,
emits much fat succe; that which is cineritious, and not black, is good; that
which is black, or very candid, is not good.

It calefies, Vires.
resolves, recreates the heart, brain and principal parts, refreshes the
spirits, cures swoundings, erects the strength, exhilarates the mind, and
cures palpitation.

CHAP. 11. Of yellow Amber, or Electrum.
ORange-coloured Amber is variously denominated: the Greeks call it Electrum;
the Persians and Mauritanians, Charabe, that is, catch-straw; the Germans,
Glesum, that is Glass, because it is splendent; the Romans, Succinum, because
it is the product of succe, or Sea-bitumen concreted; but not the succe of Pine
or black Poplar, as many have asserted: for it is found in the deeps, and upon
Sea-shores, concreted of the fat juice of the Sea and Earth.

This matter, whilst lent, viscid, and fat, before it be obdurated and dried,
catches and detains many Flies, Gnats, Ants, and such like Insects; which dye,
dry and odorate, together with the Amber.

This Amber is either white or flave: the white, which is more odorate and
lighter, is good: so also is the flave, if pellucid, and such as may be made by
attrition, to smell like Rosemary, and attract chaff or straw.

Its Powder given in convenient liquor, cohibits the flux of blood, roborates
the bowels, and is good against the white fluor of the womb: one dragm thereof
taken in a soft Egg, will stay the flux of Sperm, and will help such as are
tabid, infested with hardness of intestines, difficulty of breathing, and long
Coughs.

CHAP. 12. Of Coral.
COral is from its effigies, hardness, and native soil, frequently, and not
improperly called Lithodendron, as if it were a Stonetree, and sometimes a
Sea-shrub: for Macer says, it seems to be the bough of some arbuscle, for it
grows in the Tyrrhenian and Sicilian Seas; assurging and emitting branches like
a little Tree. Hence some repose it amongst shrubs, others amongst stones, and
others amongst Bitumens: but it is really none of all these, but something of
each.

It is threefold; one sort is red, another white, and another black: the first,
as it is of a more jucund aspect, so more medicinal, and more apt for
Bracelets, and other Ornaments. The white, as it is more spongious, so more
light and refrigerative: the black is most rarely seen, less medicinal and
expetible; red is the best, which is always understood, when Coral is
prescribed absolutely. There is another sort of Coral of a mixed color, which
is not so good: the red that is best, should be of a florid color, odorate,
like Alga, ramous, like a shrub, very frangible, not rough, nor hollow, or
chanelled.

All Coral refrigerates, dryes, and binds: Vires.
it cohibits the immoderate flux of fluors and blood, it cures the Dysentery,
represses the flux of man's sperm, and the white fluors of a woman's Uterus. It
helps such as are anhelant, infested with the Epilepsie, Spleenatick, and
heart-dolours: for, it roborates the brain, diminishes the spleen, and
exhilarates the heart. Alchymists extract a red oil out of Coral, which is very
useful in staying blood, and roborating the members: of which elsewhere.

CHAP. 13. Of Auripigmentum.
AUripigment, Arrhenick, or Arsenick, Sandaracha, and Risagalum, differ not,
save in name only: All are effoded out of the same pit; all are septical and
acrimonious, with extreme calour; dissolving, destroying, and preying upon the
principles of life. Some of the later Writers call three things Arsenick: for
they denominate Auripigment, Yellow Arsenick; Sandarax, Red Arsenick; and
Risagalum, White Arsenick.

Auripigment and Sandarax, are of the same Metals, and seem only to differ in
more or less coction; and therefore they are both often mixed in the same
glebe. There are two sorts of Auripigment; one of a golden color, (...), which
Galen calls Crustosum; which may be clefted into scales, mixed with no matter:
The other pale, effigiated like an acorn, which is affine to Sandaracha.

Sandaracha has not only affinity with Arsenick from its native soil, but
nature also; for it is only Arsenick well cocted, for that by ustion will
become Sandaracha, as Ceruse will Sandyx, which they call Painters-red. Pliny
makes mention of another sort of Sandaracha, which he refers to ceraginous
honey.

They err shamefully, that deceived through the affinity of the words, take
the Arabians Sandarax, which is Junipers Gum, for Sandaracha which is a
Mineral: for Sandarax and Sandaracha differ much, in nature, faculties, and
original; for the one is pale, light, and grateful to nature; the other red,
heavy, and deletery.

Few things are spoken, and that but by few, concerning Risagalum; insomuch,
that we can scarce from their dignments know what it is. Bern: Dessennius calls
it factitious, white, and crystalline Arsenick. But perhaps the ancients did
more wisely in its disquisition, not to detect such mortal lethal poison.
Sylvius says, it is found in the same pits with Arsenick, which some call
Auripigment.

All Arsenick is erosive, Vires.
malign, an enemy to all internal parts, and to the radical moisture, and
innate heat; and therefore it is ill advice of Nic. Alexand. to describe it for
an ingredient in the great Athanasia: for by permixion with other Medicaments,
it does not depose its ferity. It is indeed sometimes mixed with extraneous
Medicaments, but in very small quantity; and only then, when some superfluous
flesh is to be eroded.

For the spirit of Arsenick, which consists in salt, as the Alchymists speak,
is very bad, and cannot either by its fixation, or extraction, be so deleated,
as to be securely introsumed into the body.

CHAP. 14. Of Cinnabaris, or Vermillion.
DIoscorides his Cinnabaris, which is the succe of a certain tree growing in
Africa, which is usurped for Dragons-blood, differs much from the Cinnabaris,
so called by later writers, which is a Mineral, whereof there are two sorts,
the one native, the other artificial: The native is also twofold, the one
whereof is effoded out of certain silver Mines, as those in Hydria, which seems
to be a purpureous glebe, referted with Quicksilver, out of which it frequently
issues spontaneously; the other is found in the Veins of silver Mines; and is
the Minium secundum: of which hereafter.

There is also an artificial Cinnabaris, made of Sulphur and Quicksilver
coacted by the fire; which Brasavolus calls Cynaprium, to distinguish it from
the native Cinnabaris, which, with Dioscorides, he holds to be the lacryma of
an Aphrican-tree.

But indeed Cinnabaris, Cynaprium, and Vermillion, or Red-Lead, are all one,
especially with the later writers, who adducing them all to the test of reason,
found them not to differ; and those that pertinaciously contend for their
difference, exhibiting an accurate description of each, do at last conclude
them one: for the variety of names do often so obscure the thing, that he may
be excused who thinks Cinnabaris, Cynaprium, Milton, and Vermillion, to
discrepate.

Cinnabaris then is of four sorts; the first is Dioscorides his Cinnabaris,
which is the succe of an Aphrican-tree, called Dragon; the second is a Mineral,
shining with much rubour, and not very ponderous, which is found in silver
Mines; the third is factitious, of fulphur and quicksilver, ponderous, and
intermixed with red and argenteous lines; the fourth is found in silver Mines,
and kept in shops in form of a powder very nitently red, which some call
Cinnabaris, some Milton, some Minium; the shop-men Vermillion, and some Sandix.

Now Sandix is burnt Ceruss, which for its eximious redness, Serapio calls
Vermillion: from which opinion the later writers dissent not.

But that purpureous powder which Apothecaries keep for Vermilsion, is by Fliny
called the second Minium, which is found in silver Mines, acquiring that fair
rubetude by artificial and reiterated washing; so that according to Pliny, one
Minium is differenced from another, only by washing and art: yet the first
Minium or Mineral Cinnabaris, which emits much quicksilver by the fire, needs
no such washing; the second or vulgar, which is called Redlead, is red in the
fire, but eructates little or no quicksilver, and is seldom used in Medicine.

Cinnabaris being referted with much Mercury, participates of the same
saculties: which being notorious to the very Barbers, and pore-blinde, is often
by Circulators usurped to the cure of the French disease, who make such foolish
attempts thereof, as they bring many into the Palsy, more to death.

CHAP. 15. Of Quicksilver.
MErcury or Quicksilver, is the prime idol of the Alchymists, which they
pronounce the principle of things, and sperm of Metals; and indeed so true
each, that nothing is more false: for if Metals have any sperm, it is within
themselves, not elsewhere to be sought; nor will ever mixed bodies naturally
resolve themselves into Salt, Sulphur and Mercury; though these Chemical
Vulcans do Hammer them out, as Dom. Riolanus has learnedly proved against
them. This Mercury or quicksilver, is as it were the Monster of Nature, which
will not be subdued under Natures Laws: it is whiter then any silver, more
fluxile then water; more permeable then Vinegar; yet it never madefies, often
refrigerates, often califies; sometimes curing only frigid affections,
sometimes only calid ones: when it seems frigid, then it induces calid
effects; when calid, frigid ones: it sometimes hurts in small quantity, always
in great: it easily loses its proper form, and easily resumes it; and in this
it is Miraculous, that it often profits being introsumed by the mouth; and
often causes Palsy, trembling, and other prave effects, when extrinsecally
applied. ( Falop. Cap. 27, and 76. Lib. de lue Vener.)

Trajan saw some, who being anointed with a liniment made of Quicksilver before
their deaths, in the junctures of whose arms he sound much Quicksilver, when
he dissected their dead bodies.

He saw another, who being only thrice anointed with Quicksilver, vomited many
humors, wherewith much Quicksilver was confounded.

It is also storyed of one Antonius Gallus, that he being often besmeared with
Medicaments of quicksilver, and not voiding any by spittle, that much was mixed
with his urine, wherewith gold might be so dealbated, that they would take it
for silver.

Yet Brasavolus would have it assumed at the mouth, to kill Mawwormes; and
Fracastorius avers, that certain women assumed each of them a pound of
quicksilver to kill their young, which yet received no harm, they being
frustrated in their design, and the young excluded duly and alive.

Yet the same Author having afterward approved, and disapproved of its use,
confesses ingenuously, that he is ignorant of its qualities; but boldly
asserts, that it will cure the French disease.

One Jacobus Carpensis was the first that prescribed quicksilver to the cure of
this disease, whose use was so successful, that he presently became very rich
thereby: the Neotericks following him, mix it both with internal and external
remedies; for its use is deprehended both ways, as being endued with an
alexiterial faculty, whereby it extinguishes the venereous poison in the French
disease: for it is its antidote; though it be no way safe, unless it be well
handled, duly castigated, and opportunely given: for we have known many, who
taking quicksilver from the unskilful, have either perished, or fallen into a
worse case then before: for this is a beast which can scarce be tamed by any
art; and therefore Galen is excusable, who feared to use it, and durst not make
trial of its faculty, having learned from Dioscorides, that it was deletory.
Such as work Lead or other Metals wherein there is any portion of quicksilver,
are apt to contract trembling, Palsy, and corrugation of Nerves. Those also
that effode quicksilver out of Mines, though rustical and robust Men, yet do
they scarce tolerate that labor for four years, but die miserably; for it is
an untamed Medicament, whose active virtue and effect are both ancipitous; and
though it be liquid, yet very ponderous Metals will swim upon it, as wood upon
water; except Gold, which sinks therein.

Now quicksilver is either natural or artificial: the natural distills drop by
drop out of the glebes of many Mines, as of those in the Mount Hydria; or,
fountain-like, flows copiously out of some vein in a Mine, smitten with a
spade, or other Iron Instrument.

The artifical is made, or rather extracted, out of Cinnabaris; of which we
have spoken in the former Chapter: I cannot assent to Brassavolus, who, after
Vitruvius, asserts, that Mercury may be made of Marble; unless that I could say
with the Alchymists, that this Sulphur and Salt may be elicited out of all
mixed bodies.

Its qualities are as yet under debate; for some from its effects say, it is
hot, others cold: Avicenna, Vires.
whom Palmarius and many others follow, says it is cold and moist; Fracastorus,
Tomitanus, and others, who attribute an erosive faculty to it, contend for its
calidity: I, with Trajanus, think it of a mixed quality, participating of many
other faculties, but consisting chiefly of subtle, and calefactive, crasser,
and refrigerative parts: for it incides, attenuates, penetrates, melts,
resolves, subduces the ventricle; and, what is most to be admired, partly by an
attractive faculty, attracts humors from the superficies to the center, that
is, to the ventricle, and excludes them by stool; and partly by an impulsive
faculty, propels them from the center to the habit, and ejects them by
salivation.

It is used for both ends in the French disease: and it often works the fluor
of the belly, when it is given for salivation; often salivation, when it is
intended for the fluor of the belly.

It is sometimes redacted to white and ponderous powder, of which we have
treated elsewhere; which, without molestation, subduces the belly, but harms
the bowels, wherein it leaves the malign impress both of it self and aqua
fortis, in which it is immerged, as I have observed in many, who committed
themselves to some Circulators.

SECT. II. Of Medicinal and Precious Stones.
THere is no corner of the earth, which does not afford man either Food or
Raiment; no angle in which there is not something found idoneous for man's use.
Arabia is not only happy in this, but every remote and barbarous Region, does
afford us many precious things, with which we do not only cloth our selves
gallantly, but use wholesomely. What plenty of rich and precious Gemmes is
daily brought us from both the Indies, and other remote Regions, with abundance
of eximious Plants! We call them Gemmes and Precious Stones, for their rarity,
pulchritude, elegancy, and famous virtues. There is no doubt (faith the Poet)
but there is a Divine Virtue placed in Gemmes. Hence, Kings and Princes do
adorn their Crowns, enrich and illustrate their Fingers, beautify their
Houses, expel Enchantments, ture Diseases, preserve Health, recreate the Eyes,
exhilarate the Mind, and drive away sadness therewith.

CHAP. 1. Of the Smaragde or Emerald.
AFter the Adamant, which is only famous for its hardness, being of no use in
Pharmacy, the Emerald takes place, whose elegant viridity, eximious dignity,
and efficacious virtue, prefer it before all Precious-stones; then which,
nothing can be objected more pleasant, nothing more grateful to the Eyes: for
the lenity of its color refreshes fatigated Eyes, which the fulgour of others
offend. The Arabians call it Zamarrut.

Emeralds are found in many places, but the best amongst the Giants, called
Cyclops, or Arismaspi, because they have only one round eye in the middle of
their foreheads: for Arisma with them denotes one, and Spu, an Eye.

This people has continual war with Gryffons, that they may more freely
effode Gold and Precious-stones, wherewith their Mountains abound, which many
Gryffons, fierce and cruel Birds, inhabit, which dilacerate men; and like
vigilant keepers, punishing the tomerity of great avarice, set upon each one
they see, with their adunc Beaks and Claws.

Pliny makes twelve sorts of Emeralds: whereof the Scythian, which are lucidly
green, are the best; then the Bactrian, which are sometimes found in the
junctures of Rocks; next, the Egyptian, which are got out of Hills and Rocks
near a Theban Town called Copton; the rest are found in Brass Mines: of which
see Pliny, ( Cap. 6. Lib. 37.)

Our Merchants sell only three sorts, distinguished by reason of the minority
or majority of their value; for they set a small estimate upon brass Emeralds,
obscure variegated, not translucid, and all such as have either Jasper or
Beryl, or other stones mixed with them.

The best Emerald is of one color, splendid, pellucid, liquidly green, and
pleasant to the eye.

The Emerald-stone is of such eximious faculties, that it is believed
preservative from the falling sickness, included in a Ring: it also roborates
the Memory, loves Chastity, and is so averse to the sopperies of Venery, that
when the King of Hungary went in to his wife, the Emerald in the Ring wherewith
her finger was adorned, broke into three parts. And seeing its faculties are so
eximious, Mesue's Interpreter did well, though besides his Authors meaning, to
put an Emerald in the Electuary de Gemmis, in stead of Feruzegi, or rather
Peruzegi, that is, Turchesa, or Eranus, which is of no virtue not use in
Medicine, but Emerald of much; whose commendable color and excellent
faculties, Marbodaeus thus loftily warbles forth: Omne virens superat forma
viridante Smaragdus;
Collo suspensus dirum fugat hemitritaeum.
Et sanare potest ipsa ratione Caducos.
Fertur lascivos etiam campescere motus.


CHAP. 2. Of the Saphyre.
SAphyre is a Gemme of no very precious value, especially the waterish, so
named from its color: but the splendent, which is of an azure-colour, is of
high esteem; of which the Poet thus comments: Saphyri species digitis aptissima
regum.

The watery, or as the Lapidaries term it, the white Saphyre, does so much
emulate the Adamant, that it has deceived many: Both sorts are found in
Calecut, but the better are brought from Zeilan and Pegu.

The virtues of Sapphires are neither so many nor so great, as the superstition
of many men have made them, Vires.
and as the vulgar Lapidaries have described; for those things that Macer (
Cap. 5. lib. 5.) writes of it, are vain, and merely false: who says thus; Quem
natura potens tanto ditavit honor;
Ut sacer and merito gemmarum gemma vocetur.
Nam corpus vegetum conservat, and integra membra,
Et qui portat eum, nequit ulla fraud noceri:
Invidiam superat, nullo terrore movetur.
Hic lapis, ut perhibent, educit carcere vinctos.
Obstructasque fores and vincula tecta resolvit.


I will not further prosecute its Poetical description: For, Poets assuming
authority for Lies, may not be credited. Yet I can easily assent to such as
say, that Saphyre recreates the heart, allayes venereous lusts, and makes him
that carries it merry and pleasant: it resists poison in drink, purges Ulcers
in the Intestines, and the corruption of the eyes, when adhibited thereunto.

CHAP. 3. Of Rubies.
THis Rubine, is from its flammeous color called (...), that is, a Carbuncle;
but it shines not in the night, or burns like a candle, as many Idiots think:
but its nitre, in respect of other stones, is as it were flammeous. Whence the
Poet speaks thus: Ardentes gemmas superat carbunculus omnes.
Nam velut ignitus radios jacet undique carbo.
Nominis unde sui causam traxisse videtur.


It has the name of Carbuncle then from fire; whence the Grecians call them
not only Anthraces, but Pyropi; or, as some will have it, Apyroti, because
they are not altered by the fire, nor yet become warm.

They are of so many different sorts, that they can scarcely be designed by
peculiar names, or distinguished: those that come from Carthage are most
excellent, elegant, fulgent, and precious: the Ethiopian are next; the
Alabandian next; those that come from the Syrtes and India, next; those that
are like other stones, are the worst and least elegant, for they are impure,
and almost like Marble, obscure, flave, or whitish. Some think, that the
Carchedonian Rubines borrow their dignity from Carthage, not from their
pulchritude.

Merchants sell only five sorts of Carbuncles: one sort whereof is very red
and splendent, called Carbuncle absolutely, which is very rare, and fit for
Princes; the other not so fulgent, which they call true Rubine, which is
frequent enough.

The third degree of dignity, they attribute to that which they corruptly call
Bullaesium; the next to Rubith, which they call Spinel; the last to Granates:
of which in the sequel Chapter.

Many hold, that Carbuncles are of both sexes, to wit, Male, and those they say
are such as shine more splendently; and Female, which shine more grossly and
fatly.

All Rubines are Cordial, and resist Poisons. Vires.


CHAP. 4. Of Granates.
A Granate is so called, because it is like the stone of a Pomegranate; and it
is a kind of red Rubine, less elaborate by nature, and imperfected: it is
indeed red, but obscure, as if it were a Rubine covered with a small cloud:
whence some call it the blackish Rubine.

It is of two sorts; the one of more lively color, emulating a corruscant
flame, with some intermixed obscurity; the other more obscure, which is of a
lesser estimate: both come from Calecut, and some places in Spain.

A Granate suspended, or drunk up, does much resist sadness, Vires.
and recreate the heart: but being of an igneons nature, it hurts the brain,
exagitates the blood, and excites anger.

CHAP. 5. Of the Sardis-stone, or Carneol.
THe Onyx, Sardonix, and Sarda, have much affinity with one another: yet Pliny
rightly distinguishes them; for Onyx is a nitent and polite Gemme, resembling a
man's nail. Polycrates had a very fair one. ( Plin. cap. 1. lib. 37.)

Sarda is not pellucid, but ruddy in color, resembling flesh: whence it is
called Carneol, not Corneal, as some say; for it is not white like a horn.

The Sardonix participates of both their colors; for it is like a man's nail
imposed upon the flesh, and withal translucid.

It is called Sarda, because the Sardians first found it: the best whereof is
very red and perspicuous; the obscure and dilutely red, is not so good.

This stone carried about one, recreates the mind, Vires.
cohibits sad dreams, expels fear, preserves the carrier from Witches and
harms, stays the bloody flux, and usefully ingredes the confection of the
Electuary de Gemmis.

CHAP. 6. Of the Hyacinth.
THe Hyacinth is a Gemme of no very great value, for it is copiously brought
from many places of India, and Lusitania also, to us: in color it resembles
Amber, but it is more splendent, emitting an aureous fulgour.

Some write, That some Hyacinths are rubeous, others caeruleous: but many
think, that such are rather Granates, Topazes, or such stones, then true
Hyacinths. Some indeed are variegated, but the unicolourous are better,
especially the Bactrian: the Arabian worst.

Pliny frequently inculcates, that some Hyacinths are of an Orangecolour, some
variegated with certain white veins; and such the Greeks call Leucochrysos.
There is a kind of Amber, most flave, sincere, and fulgid, which the Greeks
calls Chryselectrum, which some Idiots take for the true Hyacinth.

Hyacinths participate of some faculties, for they are of a cold nature: they
condense bodies, conciliate sleep, roborate, defend from the contagion of
Pestilence, excite alacrity, and defend from Thunder and Ligntnings.

CHAP. 7. Of the Topaz-stone.
GIgnit and hunc Arabum gemmis ditissima tellus; as Marbodaeus says hereof: It
was at first found in a cloudy Island of the same name in the Red Sea, by some
Pirates, who by tempests and storms were cast upon that coast; where making a
longer abode without victuals, they were forced to fly to the herbs and roots
for succor: with which they effoded Topaz, so called from the native soil.

Many Topazes are also found in another Island called Chitis, which are very
splendent and expetible.

There are two sorts hereof: the one is called Prazoides, or Chrysoprasius,
which some say is the same with Chrysolite; the other Chrysopteron, so named
from the nitent fulgour of its golden wings.

The Chrysolite much resembles the greenness of Leek-juyce in color, yet more
aureously fulgent; whence it is so named.

The Topaz-stone easily admits of a file; whereas other Gemmes are polished
with a touchstone.

It is a matter of admiration, Vires.
that a Topaz-stone injected into boiling water, does not only hinder its
longer ebullition, but so temper its fervor, that one may forthwith put his
naked hand into it without harm.

It stays the flux of blood in all parts; it allayes anger, either removes or
abates sadness, hinders the frenzy, and delights the mind.

CHAP. 8. Of the Azure-stone.
THat which Mesue and the Arabians call Azul, the Greeks call (...), the
Latins Cyanum; sometimes, the radiant and caeruleous stone: The French by a
certain Prerogative call it absolutely, The Stone, without any adjunct:
Avincenna and Serapio call it Armenus, and Armeniacus.

Yet Armenus and the Azure-stone differ; for the latter is nitent with aureous
stars, and caeruleously flave beams: the former maculated with many green,
caeruleous, and blackish spots, whence they call it Verdazure. However, their
faculties are so conjoined in affinity, that the one may well be substituted in
the others stead; yea, both are cructed out of one Mine, being found for the
most part either in silver or gold veins: The Azure-stone is most commonly in
the gold Mines, from which it borrows its golden stars.

Now as this is most fair, and good for bracelers and other ornaments; so most
expetible for Medicaments.

An Azure-stone carried about one, helps the sight, Vires.
exhilarates the mind; prepared and assumed, it pollicitates many commodities:
for brayed, and duly washed, it potently and innoxiously expurges Melancholic
humors; burned and washed, it recreates me internals: yet some have writ too
superstitiously of it; asserting, That he that carried it about him, should be
gentle, rich, and happy.

CHAP. 9. Of the Magnet, or Heraclean-stone.
NAture has created nothing in the Universe more admirable, then the Loadstone
or Magnet, which S. Augustine calls, The wonderful raptor of Iron; which (says
he) when I first saw, I much wondered at, seeing an Iron-ring attracted by a
stone; and then another attracted by the former, to which the Magnet had
communicated its faculty; and so a third by the second; and afterward a
fourth, and so on, till a chain of Rings, not implicitly connected, but
extrinsecally adherent, hung thereat: to which Pliny attests ( Lib. 43. suae
Hist. cap. 14.)

Whose attractive faculty was at first found out by a certain Herdsman, who
following his Cattle on the Mountain Ida, at length came to a place where there
lay plenty of Load-stones; whose shoes being stuck with Iron nails, and the one
end of his staff plated with the same Metal, were so fast retained by this
hamous stone, that he must either leave his Iron, or tire himself with pulling.

Now this Pasture was called Magnes, whose name this stone retains to this day:
it is also called the Heraclean-stone; not from Heraclius its inventor, as
Taisnierius will have it, but from Heraclia a City in Lydia, where much good
Magnetical stone is got. Some call it Syderites, because it draws and allures
Iron: it is also sometimes called Ship-stone, because it serves to much use in
Ships.

There are five sorts hereof: the first is called the Ethiopian Magnet, which
comes from Aethiopia; the second the Magnesian, that comes from Magnesia; the
third is found in Alexandria; the fourth in Echion of Boeetia; the fifth, which
is worst, in Capo Verlichi Natoliae. This is light and spongious, like a
Pumick-stone. The Ethiopian Magnets are judged best: all, of what sort soever,
are so much better, by how much more caeruleous; such also as are more
ponderous, and attract Iron more firmly, are very laudable.

An Adamant hinders the attractive virtue, as also Garlic rubbed on the
Magnet; for its attractive faculty is not so valid, but it may be easily
deluded, obscured, and superated: and therefore Taisnierius his assertion is
very ridiculous, to wit, That certain ships compacted with Iron Nails, sailing
along the Ethiopian Sea, and driven by a tempest to the Promontories, should
be by Magnets drawn to the bottom, or shivered to pieces, their Nails being by
their potency extracted; for these are old-wives Fables, not worthy the Pen of
an Author.

The Magnet draws Iron as its similar, for its own conservation and alimony;
for which purpose, they put its dust in bexes; and it respects the North as its
Matrix: whence Mariners say, it tends to the Antarctick Pole.

There is another stone called Theamedes, of an opposite quality, got in a
certain Mountain in Aethiopia, which repels and respuates Iron.

Some sell burnt Magnet for Hematites; but they are much different, as appears
by their description. Dioscor.

The Magnet besides its enumerated faculties, Vires.
has also some Medicinal qualities, for whose cause it ingredes the divine
salve, and others Medicaments: some think that a small quantity of a Magnet
assumed at the mouth, will preserve youth; and therefore King Zeilan commanded
that all the dishes and vessels wherein his Meat was to be cocted, to be made
of Magnets.

CHAP. 10. Of some other Gemmes more seldom used in Medicine.
THere are yet almost infinite Gemmes, both fair and elegant to see to, and
endued with special faculties; whose use being very rare, I purpose not to
treat of every of them in several Chapters: for, it satisfies mine Institution,
if I accurately describe these that ingrede the confections we have delivered
in our Shop; yet lest some Apothecaries should think there were no more Gems,
in this one Chapter I shall comprehend and Epitomize a great many.

The first that occurs is Eranus, which the French call Turchesa, Turchesa.
the Arabians Peruzaa; Pliny, Callais, and Augites; whose color seems to be
confusedly, but elegantly mixed of an azure and green: it is had in India,
especially about the Mountain Cokas.

The Jasper stone is either totally or in a great part green and elegant; whose
species to enumerate, would tire a man; Jaspis.
for Macer says, they are seventeen: it is very efficacious in staying blood.

The Boodstone took its Greek name Haematites, from blood also; Haematites.
for whether it be carried or assumed, it cohibits the issue of blood: it is
thought to be a kind of Jasper; for it is green, variegated, and as it were
bespotted with drops of blood.

Achates, is so called from the River Achate, where it is found: Achates.
there are many varieties thereof, but the most vulgar are obscurely white,
disterminated with veins either red or black. It is storied of King Pyrrhus,
that he had a special one, wherein Nature had engraven the Nine Muses. Some
Achates are red like Coral.

The Amethyst is a stone brought from India, Amethystus.
of a purpureous ^^^ed with a violaceous color, emitting some small flames;
whereof there are five sorts, the more vulgar is violaceous, resembling the
color of red Wine, much diluted with water: it is said to hinder ^^iety, but
to excite dreams.

As the whitely corruscant Adamant, the green Emerald, the flainmeous and red
Carbuncle, the caeruleous Saphyre, and the golden Chrysolite, are the best of
those kinds: so is the variegated Opalus, Opalus.
in whose mixture is the micant fire of the Carbuncle, the purpureous fulgour
of the Amethyst, the caeruleous viridity of the Emerald, and all nitent colors
most elegantly contentned; then which, no aspect is more beautiful. Pliny calls
this stone Paederos: it is got in the Island Zeilan, and in many parts of
India, where it is called Argenon: it is also found in Egypt, where it is
called Senites.

There is another kind of Opalus, less elegant and nitent, which they call
Pseudopalus, and Cats-eye; which, as it is not so fair, so not so expetible as
the true Opalus. This is in probability the stone that Isidore calls
Ophthalmius.

There is another stone appertaining to the kind of Opalus, Panthera.
which from its variegated color, resembling the Panther, is called Panther;
and it is thought to be endued with as many virtues as colors.

The Selenite, Selenites.
so called from the Moon, which it represents, (...) a stone of a shining,
candid, and yellow color, which increases and decreases as the Moon does: some
of this kind are greener, others paler.

The Girasol, Girasola.
which some call the Sun's stone, others Loucop^^alos, is reposed among those
Gemmes which are heartily nitent, and emit an aureous fulgor.

There is a noble Gemme called Dionysia; Dionysia.
which brayed and assumed, though it resemble the sapour of Wine, yet it
resists e^riety. The Poet thus describes it: Nigramicat rubris Dionysia consita
guttis.

Beryl is a Gemme comprehending many under it of the same name; Beryllus.
some whereof are caeruleous, others paler, others flave, and aureously
fulgent, which are often called Chrysoprasi; others in color resemble oil, and
others other things, so as its species are nine: Beryl shines obscurely, unless
it be brought to a Sexangula^ form.

There has been of late a stone mixed with a green and lacteous color,
Nephriticus lapis.
brought from New-Spain, which they call the Reins-sto^e; which bound to ones
arm, does by a special propriety break and propel the stone.

Aetites is as it were a pregnant stone, Aetites.
sounding when shaken, which derives its name from Eagles, by whom, as it is
storied, it is got, and posited in their Nests, to allay the heat of their
Eggs, lest they califie too much during incubation; others think otherwise, and
speak much falsely concerning it. However, it is a stone that will accelerate
birth, if applied to the things; but retard it, if bound above the stomach, or
carried betwixt the Paps: there are four sortsof it, which may be learned from
Pliny.

The Jewish stone, Lapis Judaicus.
which is named from its native soil, is white, of an elegant form, of the
magnitude of an Acorn, disterminated with lines so equally distant, as if they
had been artificially fabricated: Brayed, levigated, and assumed, it breaks the
stones in the Reins and Bladder.

The Chrysolampe is pale on the day, Chrysolapis.
but on the night splendent as fire; it is had in Aethiopia, but seldom brought
to us.

Pliny, and such as write of stones, recenfeate innumerably more: but they
write of such as they never either knew or saw; and they usurp many stones,
conjoined by some affinity, for one and the same; and often constitute the same
stone denoted by many names, as multifarious: for Pliny avers, That the names
of stones are almost innumerable.

There rest yet many stones of eximious virtue and high estimate; but because
they are desumed from Animals, as Unions, or Margarites, the Bezaar-stone, and
the like, we shall treat of them in our Book of Medicaments, desumed from
Animals or their parts.

CHAP. 11. Of certain Medicinal, but not Precious-stones: and first of Marble.
MArble is a most notorious and hard kind of stone; of which there are as many
differences, as places whence they are elicited: the noblest are these; the
Pheugitical, Parian, Zeblical, Porphyritical, and Ophytical Marble; all are
approved or disapproved from their color, nitre, perspicuity, and durity. That
which is green or variegated, and hard withal, is fairest and best; that also
which is very candid and solid, is commendable; and such must be selected to
the confection of the Citrian unguent.

The Pheugitical Marble shines most, and represents Images. Nero bunt a Temple
of this stone, to Fortune; which shined so within, that though the doors and
windows were shut, yet was it clearly perceptible.

The Parian is not all alike, for some is very white, which is very very
frequent in Italy, others cincritious; some green, others ferreous: which last
sort is so hard, that some make Anvils of it.

The Zeblical is found in Misena: This is the softest, and is thought goed
against Poison; which, if so, is the best of Marbles.

The Porphyritical Marble is most-what variegated with red spots; it is brought
out of Egypt: that which is beset with white spots, is called Leucasticon,
whereof they make good and excellent (...) and Modules.

The Ophytical or Serpentine-Marble, is partly green, partly variegated with
many other colors, like a Serpents skin; whence it has its name: the most
spots in the vulgar are pale, with others very dissimilar.

Some Marbles are also nobilitated from some Men, and some Regions; as Luculus
his Black Marble; Augustus Tiberius his Marble; also Egyptian, Theban,
Ephesian, and Lacedemonian Marble.

Alabaster is a kind of Marble, so called from Alabastrum, an Egyptian City:
it is ordinarily white and perspicuous; whereof Images are carved, and vessels
made to receive and keep unguents.

CHAP. 12. Of Crystal.
Crystal is not congealed water, Crystal, quid.
as many think, but a Mineral stone, white, pellucid, and nitent, like clear
water, consisting of an aqueous and pure humor; not concreted by cold, but as
many say, by the virtue of some divine calour: neither is it made of ice,
though it be thence denominated, and often sound in deep Snows, but of an
humor of its own: for, ice warmed by the fire, melts easily; but Crystal
hardly, though encompassed round with fire, and always agitated with flames
and wind.

Crystal is also found under the earth, amongst stones, (...) hot Regions,
where this Chrystalline humor, both from the ^^versal cause, and a certain
terrestrial potency, lapidifies; no other then Amber and Coral, which at first
are humors also, and afterward concrete into a lapideous solidity; not by
cold, but from the aptitude of the matter.

The most pure, Usus.
pellucid, and nitent Crystal is best: it is not only fit for the making of
Cups, Vessels, Bracelets, and other elegant matters; but its powder ingredes
the Citrian unguent, and is commended in dentifrices, and other Medicaments
inservient to Ornament.

CHAP. 13. Of Gypsum, a kind of Talkum or Lime.
GYpsum is known to all, especially to the Lutetians, whose Walls, Houses, and
Palaces, are generally cemented therewith; whose suburbane Mines are wholly of
this Limestone, whose cunicles contain not any flint or other stone.

Now this Gypsum is a white and nitent stone, easily divisible^^to plates, and
fit for Structures, Edifices, and Walls. Crude Gypsum is not usurped to the
fabric of houses, but it is first burned, till it become tabid, white, and
easily pulverable; then diluted with water, which afterward concretes to a
stony hardness: before it be hardened, it is agitated with a Spade, subacted,
and wrought so as it may be soft and sequacious, more fit to agglutinate
stones, or compact other works. It is best when newly cocted; for if it be long
kept, it will be more humid, and will not concrete so solidly.

There are two sorts hereof: the one more common, which is obscurely nitent;
the other more rare, which is cloven into plates, and splendent, like specular
stone: whence many call it Talkum, but improperly; for Talkum is more slender,
squamous, white, and lucid: Some call it Selenite; some juglers by their
deceptive art, make an oil of Talkum, to wash, erugate, and dealbate old Wives
faces withal; and so daily deceive silly women, that will not endure
deformity, with their vain promises, whilst warily, yet not illicitely, they
put their hands into the women's Purses (for it is no injury or deceit to
beguile those that consent and are willing.)

It has an astringent faculty, and is good against Ruptures. Vires.


CHAP. 14. Of Chalk.
CHalk, Lime, and Gypsum, are agglutinative stones, used in compacting rich
men's houses; for poor men's cottages are emented only with a little clay
subacted. Now Lime, after it has once drank water, bears it not again; but
Chalk is nourished by water, and longer and better preserved therewith. When I
name Chalk, I mean, that which is very white, pulverable, friable, and by
infusion in water inflammeable.

For crude Chalk is a hard ponderous stone, that will neither dissolve, nor wax
white in water, and is more properly called Chalkstone.

In what parts Chalk is found, there is no Lime; and where Lime is found, there
is no Chalk: that Chalk is best, which touched with water, makes a noise,
ignifies, and is cineritious; for age makes it whiter, but more infirm; for the
air is got into it, and its fire is abared.

Di^scorides says, That Chalk may be made of the shells of Cockles, Mussles,
or Oysters, so long burnt, till they be perfectly white.

An eximious Psylother may be made of quick Chalk and Auripigment, which will
easily depilate rough places: This also, with someother things, will make good
Pyroticks, which will burn the part they are applied to.

Chalk often was^ed with pluvial or fountain water, may usefully be mixed to
such unguents as cure cadaverous Ulcers. Chalk extinguished with water, and
twice or thrice washed, if it be again cast into water, makes that water very
convenient for the Ulcers in the Privities, and other running cadaverous and
dangerous sores in other parts: for, by much washing, it deposes its mordacity,
and ceases to be sharp; but yet it callfies and siccates manifestly, and ceases
to be sharp; but yet it califies and siccates manifestly, and is therefore good
to exsiccate Ulcers, and induce scars.

CHAP. 15. Of stones found in Spunges.
SPunges by nature accede nearer to Plants then Animals; for they have
accrescion and augmentation, but no fensation, as many have credited.
Dioscorides makes some of them male, which are full of smaller holes, the
hardness whereof they call He-goats; and others female; which have larger
holes. Aristotle makes four sons of Spunges: some spisse, which are softest;
others tenuious, which are hardeft; others most spisse; and others most valid,
which they call Achilleous Spunges. Those that grow on stones are harder; those
that grow on the tranquil marine tracts, are softer.

But we know only three sorts of Spunges: the first with rare and patent
holes, which is softest and most vulgar, in magnitude and form resembling a
man's Liver; the second perviated with lesser holes, which is denser, lesser,
and harder; the third like Seaspume, which is most dense, valid, and
cineritious: they commonly call them all Sea-Mushromes.

Pliny says, Vires.
That stones either grow in Spunges, or coming from other places, fall in, and
are stabled there: both sorts are well known, for they are found in every
Sponge; but those that grow in the Sponge, must be selected, as being more apt
to break the stone: yet Galen is of opinion, that this stone is not so valid,
as to break the stone in the bladder.

CHAP. 6. Of Bricks.
MEdicks do not only from Gemmes and Stones, but from broken and inveterate
Bricks, worn Shoe-soles, and Clay, seek remedies for the sick: for nothing is
^oid of all qualities; and nothing, but, used opportunely by a perite and
approved Medick, will profit.

There are many things which are efficacious while new, but by age lose their
qualities and virtue, as common Medicaments: others, which are scarce Medicinal
till they be old, as Bricks, which at first serve only for structures, but
when old, are very Medicinal, and expetible, as will appear from the Oil
extracted out of them for the cure of many diseases, as we have showed in our
Shop.

SECT. III. Of Metals.
THat is properly called a Metal, which is of a Fossile body, hard, ductile
with a hammer, and liqueable with fire; but as soon as it is melted, it does
return into its pristine form. The word is derived from (...), that is to say,
to search, because the Metallists are wont to search the Veins of the Earth;
for every Vein does afford some Metal.

But concerning the matter of them, there are diverse Opinions: Aristotle in his
third Book of Meteors, cap. ult. does constitute a double matter of all Metals
which are found in the Earth; viz. Halitus and Vapor: Of which all Fossiles are
made in the bowels of the Earth. Those things that are dug out of the Earth,
are either such that may be melted, or not melted: those that are incorporated
with some humid matter, are easily melted, as Lead and Tin; others are melted
indeed, but with more difficulty, as Iron, etc. Matthiolus writes that to be an
Elementary substance, which is the efficient cause of Metal. Scaliger, Exercit.
20. says, That the substance of Metal is a watery Earth: The Chemists
appropriate it to Mercury, and therefore call it the Sperm of the Earth; or, as
some say, the Sulphur; which they allege out of Albertus, who says, That the
first matter of Metals, is a humid, unctious, and subtle Body, which is
incorporated with a subtle and terrestrial mixture. Now there are as many
Metals as Planets, to wit, Seven, whose Names and Characters they appropriate
to the Metals: for they call Gold Sol, Silver Luna, Lead Saturn, Tin Jupiter,
Iron Mars, Copper Venus, and Quicksilver Mercury; which is not properly a
Metal; for it cannot be wrought, nor is it malleable; but after another manner,
that is, in virtue, it may be called a Metal.

But Scaliger, Exercit. 106. reprehends this nomination of Metals, and their
affinity with the Planets, and calls it foolish and ridiculous: Neither is the
Number of Metals to be comprehended in the number of Planets; for not only the
Metals, but many other Fossiles, do strive to respond in Title and Character,
and that more properly, to the Planets and Signs of the Zodiac; as Aspalatum
to Taurus, Auripigmentum to Gemini, Sal Ammo^iacum to Cancer, Red Arsenick to
Virgo, Roman Vitriol to Libra, Sulph^r to Scorpio, Roch-Alome to Sagittary,
Scissile-Alome to Capricorn, Sal Nitre to Aquary: So that these three Arcana's,
as they call them, are covered with many Aenigmatical Riddles, not unlike so
many madmen, spewing out a thousand boastings, which are more fit to be derided
then confuted. But we will hasten to our intended purpose, and enter upon a
definition of Sol, which we call Gold.

CHAP. 1. Of Gold.
Gold, the King of Metals, is of that kind most perfect and compact; which
bearing the tincture of the Sun in its countenance, exercises solar Dominion
over all Mortals: for all obey Gold, Aurum lex sequitur and auro venalia rura.
Diphil. For nothing is more potent then pure Gold; to him men give adoration,
for him men undergo great labor: and whosoever wants it, may either like a Leper
sejoyn himself from consort; or like a dead carcass walk amongst men.

But seeing it is adiaphorous, and either good or bad, according to the intent
of the user; if it be ill used, it is the worst of evils, for it is the
ring-leading Captain of Contention, the plague of life, and the ruin of the
Commonweal: Hence Raptures, hence Manslaughters, and hence Battles ensue: but
if it be well used, it is thought to be not only the Subsidy of life, but the
guarder of family, if introsumed. But I do not mean Chemical potable, or rather
esculent Gold, which refects the recipient only with a lie, and vain
expectations: for, grant we that the Alchymists can by their delusive Art
extract a flave liquor, emulous of melted Gold; yet this is so far from curing
Leprosy, inveterate Dropsies, and other deplorable diseases; or from retarding
old age, and conserving youth florid and vegetive, as they boast, that it is
plainly of no noted use in Medicine; seeing the nature of Gold is so dissident
from our nature, that it cannot be to us restorative, as Scaliger well observes
( Exercit. 272.) and there being many things more agreeable to our nature, they
must needs be more conservative of it: and what is more absurd, then to say,
that Gold nourishes, repairs our substance, and yet changes not into our
nature? for thus he that eats Gold, will be a golden Fool like Midas.

Medicks therefore do not labor to dissolve Gold, for that is all one, as if
they should destroy its native bonity, and induce an alien quality, either
useless or noxious; but they do better, by working it into thin leaf, dust, or
atoms, that it may more easily insinuate into the parts of the body.

Gold thus prepared, does usefully ingrede Electuarium de Gemmis, Galens
laetificative powder, and roborative Medicaments. I was wont successfully to
prescribe to rich Wenches of ill colors, the filings of Gold, in stead of
prepared Steel, with other fit Medicaments, sometimes in form of Pills,
sometimes of Tabels.

The Medicinal faculties of Gold are indeed many; Vires.
yet neither so great nor so many, as Alchymists predicate: it is chiefly
commended for exhilarating such as are melanchollical, or preternaturally sad.

CHAP. 2. Of Silver.
SIlver also is as very Soul and Blood to Mortals; for after Gold, it is the
most noble of Metals, which age neither corrupts nor hurts, but always remains
nitid, splendid, and sincere, easily ducible and liquescible: it is made in the
bowels of the earth, of clean and candid Quicksilver, and pure, clear, firm,
and white Sulphur, equally contempered, and so it evades candid and fulgent.
Furthermore, the heat of well-claensed Sulphur, dealbates and makes it more
subtle, and so exsiccates it, that it becomes tinalous, hard, and sonore.

This alone of Metals seems to emit a translucid splendour; for its light in the
Mine, does in a manner represent the rudiments of stars in a dark place: But
when it is more pure, and purged seven times in the fire, as the Psalmist
sings, Psalm. 11. then it is far more splendent. The Alchymists compare it to
the Moon, whose name they give it, but its qualities are not answerable.

It is judged colder then Gold, Vires.
whose virtues and dignity it in some degree participates of, being next to it
in perfection and punity. By its natural complexion, it is temperately cold and
moist: whence they say, it auxiliates the spiritual members, it stays the
palpitation of the heart, for it roborates it, and helps sanguification, making
the blood more laudable. The Alchymists extract an oylout of it, which they
commend to many diseases in the Brain: but dogmatical and true Medicks, only
use its powder or leaves in Medicaments, and they that do otherwise, work
deceitfully.

CHAP. 3. Of Tin.
Tin is another kind of Metal, found in the Mine with Silver, which Pliny
calls White-Lead, to distinguish it from Black-Lead, which is as it were the
purgation of Silver and Tin left in the Furnace. Such as devote Tin holy to
Jupiter, say, it is generated of pure and clear Quicksilver, and crass and
immund Sulphur.

There are many things common betwixt Lead and Tin; for neither of them
contract rust, but rather some squalour or filth, whereunto Lead is more
addicted then Tin; neither of them are sonore, nor very hard, only Tin is
a little more sonore and hard then Lead.

Tin is either simple, pure, and defaecated; or impure, and compounded of
other Metals, so made either by Nature or Art: whereof there are many
differences, according to the nature of the ingredients, and proportion of the
same; whose faculties respond to the mixion of those things whereof it consists.

Tin is of much use to man, Usus.
which though it be seldom used in Medicine, yet it affords vessels for their
repose and preservation. The Alchymists make an Oil out of Tin, for the cure
of Wounds and Ulcers; but I think such Medicaments as are easilier made,
cheaper, and more efficacious, are better.

CHAP. 4. Of Lead.
(...), or Lead, is, according to Alchymists, both dedicated to Saturn, and
called Saturn; and in their opinion it is generated of impure and crass
Quicksilver, and a little impure Sulphur: and it is thought, that not only
under the earth, but in the open air also, it augments; and therefore Cardanus
thinks it labefactates houses by its weight, who make four differences thereof,
the vulgar, white, which many call Tin, Bisemutum, yet unknown, and that
which is made of Stibium.

Pliny acknowledges only two sorts; the vulgar or black, and the white: who
gives a twofold original to the black; for (says he) it is either generated in
its own vein, which produces naught else, or it is conflated in many veins mixed
with Silver. The first liquor which flows in furnaces, is called White-Lead, or
Tin, the second Silver, and that which remains, the Latins call Plumbago,
out of which Lead is elicited.

It is extracted also out of a certain Plumbary, effoded out of Mines, which
stone they call Molybdoides; and the Lead thus secerned and melted, is poured
into water, while hot, till it leave its dross.

Morters and Pestels for Medicinal uses, are made of Lead; as also round Pipes
or Canes, for deep and internal Ulcers, which are as good as golden Pipes.

There is also a Powder made of Lead, for the exsiccation of ^lcers: whereof we
have elsewhere made mention.

Galen says, Vires.
that Lead is refrigerative, and is either solarly, or mixed with other
Medicament, conducible to malignant, cankerous, and putrid Ulcers; but its
faculties are bettered by lotion or ustion. Dioscorides teaches the manner,
qualities and effects of its ablution and ustion. Ceruse is made of plates of
Lead: of which hereafter.

CHAP. 5. Of Brass.
BRass is dedicated to Venus, from her Island Cyprus, where it is copiously
effoded; and it is either of a golden color, and thence called Aurichalcum; or
redder, and then it is called Brass absolutely. This was of more use amongst
the Ancients, then either Gold, Silver, or Iron: for the first money was of
Brass. And hence we have these occurrents, Aerarium Publicum, aes alienum, and
questor erarius. Their bellatory arms also were not of steel, but brass, as
also their Statues and Temple-doors.

In Pharmacopolies we often meet with these terms, Aes ustum, fles aeris,
squama aeris, and aerugo: but what every of these denotes, all our
Pharmaceutical lections will scarcely teach us. Aes ustum, or burnt Brass
(says Dioscorides) is made of the nails of broken ships, imposed upon a crude
earthen vessel, a little Sulphur, and as much Salt strewed under them: all of
them being besprinkled herewith, and the vessels spirament daubed with a
singular cement, it is set on a furnace till they be cocted.

This aes ustum astringes, exsiccates, represses, extenuates, attracts, purges
Ulcers, and brings them to a scar, and emends the vices of the eyes.

Flos aeris, or the flower of Brass, is made, when the Brass melted in the
furnace delabes into certain receptacles, through the necks of such fistuls as
appertain thereunto; and when cold water is infunded upon the burning Brass,
before it concrete into a hard mass: for then this flos aeris, in this sudden
concretion and densation, will erupt in a vapor; which concreting also will
fall down in small red grains like Millet, which we take for flos aeris.

Squama aeris, or the scales of Brass, are made, when Brass is smitten with
hammers; and those are the best which are excussed out of the same Brass that
nails are made of; those the worst, which are made of vile and promiscuous, or
white Brass. This squama eris astringes, extenuates, represses, erodes, stays
arrels, and brings Ulcers to scars.

CHAP. 6. Of Verdegrease.
VErdegrease is not only of use to Painters, but to Physicians also, who mix
it with many Medicaments for the cure of Ulcers; as that Medicament which Galen
calls Lite, and more he describes.

This Verdegrease is not the flower of Brass, as some think, but a certain
green rasure, which exudes out of its plates wet with vinegar.

Dioscorides make two sorts hereof: one the vulgar or simple Verdegrease; the
other, worm-rust: and that twofold; the one fossile, and the other factitious:
both whereof are rare; for the one is either not sought, or not found; and the
other not now made.

But the vulgar is copious, and everywhere venale, which may be made many
ways, but most usually thus:

Some sharp Vinegar must be infused into a Hogshead, or other ample vessel;
whereon a brazen vessel must be inversly superimposed; if it may be, a
concamerated one; or if it be plain, it must be so obstructed, that there may
not be any spiracle left: after ten days; let the cover be removed, and the
Verdegrease thereon eraded.

This way is also most usual: one or more plates of brass are so suspended in a
Hoshead, containing Vinegar, that they may not touch the Vinegar, and the due
days being expired, the Verdegrease is deraded. Moreover, the same plates
macerated in Vinegar, will afford Verdegrease.

It is sharp, Vires.
digestive, and attractive: it discusses not only tender, but hard flesh; and
it is not only mordacious to the gust, but to the very Ulcers. If you add a
little of it to a large Searcloth, the mixture will exterge without mordacity.
Many err in ascribing a Sarcotical or Epulotical faculty to many Medicaments,
when they of themselves are not, but become such by composition. Galen.

CHAP. 7. Of Iron.
NOthing is more common, nothing more useful, and nothing more nocent, then
Iron: for, neither houses, stables nor ships, nor yet such things as respect
man's vesture and aliment, can be had or made without Iron; seeing no labor is
suscepted, no work absolved, without the adjument hereof: for all Artificers
need some Iron Instrument to their work. All which I will not in special
prosecute, seeing it is notorious to every Rustic.

For, not only Plough-shares, Saws, Hatches, Sickles, Tongs, and Needles; but
also Swords, Spears, Darts, Arrows, and Canonbullets, which beat down whole
Cities and Fortresses, killing men, and perpetrating a thousand slaughters, are
made of Iron: which Pliny not enduring, cries out, we do not only use Iron at
hand, but send it to do our mischief at distance; one while ejecting it out of
Slings, another-while of Cross-bowes, and sometimes making it fly with
feathers; as though death were not swift enough, but we must accelerate his
feet with wings, and arm him with Iron.

What if Pliny had seen our Canons and bellical torments, wherewith we do not
only overthrow Cities and Walls, but Rocks and Mounts!

But Iron is not the cause of these mischiefs, but the wicked guiles of man's
ingeny, which puts that to ill use, which in it self is good: for it makes also
ways and passages, whereby putrid blood is educed out of the veins; corruption
ejected out of the breast; fragments of bones, and other things that would
molest the brain, drawn out of the seull; corrupt teeth evelled from the gums;
the o^daverous flesh of Ulcers removed; a putrid member abscinded, left it
should draw the rest into its consort. What needs more? We cannot live without
Iron; for else we might effode Dens with our Nails, in stead of Houses, and car
our Meat like Beasts.

There are two sorts of Iron: one retains its name, the other being more
defaecated, is called Steel. There are two differences of the former; the one
may be melted and drawn, of which they make many rustical instruments; the
other may be melted, but not drawn, being very fragil, whereof they make molten
Pots, and other culinary instruments: After which use, Scaliger thinks it is
not useless, but may be molten again; as also, that same which he elsewhere says
only mollifies: for we see, that both sorts may be melted by ardent heat; yea,
some at Lutetia seek and buy the fragments of Iron Pots, which they carry to
the furnaces, and melt over again.

Some say, that Steel is nothing but Iron accurately defaecated; and many
boast, That they can work Iron into Steel: It has its Latin name from
Chalybo, a Town in Assyria; yet that of Damascus is most laudable, for a Sword
of that Steel will cut Iron.

There is a Powder made of Steel-dust, which Alchymists call ^lars his Saffron:
but Iron-dust duly prepared, is every whit as good. We have treated of both in
our Shop.

And as Brass has its aerugo or Verdegrease, so has Iron its ferrugo or rust;
whereby it is eroded and absumed, in lieu of its fault, as it were, of effusion
of blood: for Iron tincted with blood, presently contracts rust.

There is a certain kind of execrement which eructates out of Iron, which they
sometimes call its dross, sometimes its scales, sometimes its recrement, and
sometimes its dung: but those are properly called Iron-scales, which break from
it, while its beaten with hammers; and that its recrement or dung, which is
clicited by ^gnition.

Many assert, That Iron-rust will cure Ulcers; Vires.
and that Telephus King of Mysia, wounded by Achilles, was thereby persanated:
for this, as also its dross, astringe and siccate; whence they are mixed with
Medicaments of a siccative faculty.

All Iron is roborative; and thence some waters become Medicinal, which the
Normans call Forgenses, borrowing eximious virtues from Iron.

CHAP. 8. Of the seventh Metal.
SOme say, This seventh Metal is Mercury, others Amber; but neither of these
are more then in a potency to be Metals: but it seems rather to be Stibium,
which is more truly called a Metal, which is another great Alchymistical Idol,
and the sole Empyrical Cathartick, whereby they jactitate to cure all diseases;
but they too anxiously perturb some men's Ventricles, by moving them both upward
and downwards; others they miserably torment, by too vigorous purging; some
they kill, and restore very few to sanity.

One Corn: Gemma, a Physician of Lovanium, says, That a Paracelsian English
Medick, being himself and his wife detained by a Fever, took himself, and gave
to his wife, that they call prepared Antimony; whereupon she fell quickly
distracted, and changed her life, yet valid, with death: He, complaining of
dreams, and continual watchings, seven days after his dejection, began to dote
and roave; from that he became Epileptical; from his Epilepsie he fell into a
Lethargy, being therewithal somewhat Apoplectical; when he had been detained
three days in that sopour, he fell again to his roaving, and was so agitated
with fury, that not long after, he expired, and passed from his conjugal bed,
to his conjugal tomb.

Yet this Antimony is by some so artificially prepared, Vires.
that being opportunely given, it produces admirable effects: for an eximious
sudatory, inferior to none, may be made of it. Neither is that Powder
contemptible, which they call Flower of Stibium; for if it be prepared by
perite, and exhibited by learned Artists, it profits much. Yet very good
Medicks forbear to prepare or exhibit it, because they have much better
Medicaments, whereby they may more securely cure any disease.

CHAP. 9. Of Ceruse.
AS Iron has its rust, Cerusa, quid.
and Brass its verdegrease; so has Lead its Ceruse, which some call the flower
of Lead, and others, after Galen, Psymmithion.

And although Ceruse erupt like Verdegrease, by the benefit of Vinegar, yet is
not green, but very white: whence Painters, to whom it is of much use, call it
White-lead; and it is made after this or the like manner:

Sharp Vinegar is in the Summertime infunded into a pot with a broad orifice,
a plate of Red-Lead is superimposed, and the vessel so occluded, as nothing can
expire. When the plate of Lead is taken off, which is most commonly on the
tenth day, that crasser matter that falls to the bottom of the vessel, is
collected and siccated: afterward it is grinded with a Hand-mill, and sifted,
then coacted into a Mass or Pastils with a little Vinegar, and preserved.

It may also be made of Lead-dust, immerged and resolved by the space of ten
days in very sharp Vinegar. It is sometimes also made of the same Plates
infused and deraded, and again macerated and deraded; the same again and again
reiterated, till they be resolved; then their rasure must be collected, brayed,
sifted, and coacted with Vinegar.

Painters do not only seek after white Ceruse, but women also, to fucate their
faces; yet by its undue use, the teeth become black and worm-eaten, and the
breath foetid. The best is that they call Rhodiaca, or that we now call
Puteolis.

Ceruse baked in a new earthen pot upon burning coals, will acquire by ustion a
red color, and so become Sandix, which is an artificial Vermilion, and not
Sandaracha, as some think.

Before Ceruse ingrede the composition of Salves, Unguents, and Collyries, it
should be prepared, that is, washed, that it may desiccate and astringe
moderately, without any mordacity; and that in some fit liquor, as in simple
water, or Rose Water, thus:

Let a convenient quantity of Ceruse be taken, and brayed in a stone-Morter
with a wooden Pestel; then let water be poured upon it; then let it stand till
the Ceruse be quiet in the bottom of the Mortar; then abject the water: let
more again be poured in; agitate it; then suffer it to reside, and eject the
water as before: then again pour new water in; and so let the work be iterated,
till the water poured in and agitated, appear clear and pure, without filth.

These duly performed, let the Ceruse be laevigated on a red Marble stone; then
dried, and again brayed, and then formed into Pastils with Rosewater, and
reposed for future uses. Some bray it with Vinegar, and subact it into a mass;
others with another liquor accommodated to their intentions.

Ceruse refrigerates, siccates, astringes, extenuates, expletes, Vires.
represses excrescencies, and perduces to a scar: it cannot be assumed at the
mouth without peril.

CHAP. 10. Of Cadmia, both factitious and fossile.
CAdmia, which the Arabians call Climia, is either fossile and native, which is
the stone out of which Brass is drawn, and is called Brass-Ore, which
Artificers use in making yellow Brass; which the shop-men call Aurichalcum, or
Orichalcum; or else it is factitious.

The native is often found in Metal-Mynes: it is a yellow stone, very hard;
appearing of two colors when it is not accended, but all over luteous when
accended: and it is probable, this is the stone which Albertus calls Didachos,
or the Devils-stone. The rivulets and torrents of Cyprus sometimes afford such
a stone, which, being of many colors, some call it, The Rainbow-gemme; of
which we have before spoken: but indeed it is neither the Rainbow nor Didachos.

Factitious Cadmia is a dense body, concreted of the smoke of Brass melted in a
furnace, driven by the wind, and cleaving to the sides and roof of the furnace.
Galen says, it is no matter whether we call it an earth or a stone; out of
which, some Brass, some Cadmia, and some Diphryges, is drawn: for the stone
Pyrites burnt in (...) furnace, affords Cadmia.

There are five sorts of factitious Cadmia: Vires.
the first is called Capnitis, which is found in the very orifice of the
furnace; which is so exust and tenuious, that it resembles Embers: the second
is called Ostraticls, which for the most part is black, and looks like a
potsheard, being more grave, and therefore it delabes to the bottom of the
furnace; and it is the most sordid of all: Galen calls it Sp^d^s or Spodium:
the third and fourth are found in the middle of the furnace, and they are
called Placitis and Botrytis: Placitis is crusty, and encompassed with
segments, as with Zones; which is less pondrous, and adheres to the sides of
the furnace; under which Onichitis is found. Botrytis is moderately heavy, in
face and color like Spodium; which when broken, is cineritious and aeruginous.
The first is as it were the thinner smoke of the Brass, which adheres to the
top of the furnace: of which hereafter.

All Cadmia is well and frequently had in the furnaces of Cypra^, which they
make of that stone, which in dignity they call Cadmia: They make whiter Cadmia
of Silver, but it is not comparable to that of brass.

Cadmia desiccates gently, Vires.
absterges, and helps humid and putrid Ulcers, and draws them to scars.

CHAP. 11. Of Spodium.
NOthing is more frequently inculcated or heard in Pharmacopolies, and nothing
less understood, then Spodium; which all the Apothecaries that I know, make of
two sorts: one coming from Greece, and another from Arabia; being in name one,
but in nature very different: but that I may speak plainly, there is no Arabi^n
Spodium, but fictitious, as we said before, and shall declare hereafter.

The Grecian Spodium, which is indeed the sole Spodium, is found in brass
furnaces, with Pompholix, with which it has much affinity: and it is then
made, when micant sparks ascend from the Metal while it is cocting: and because
of their gravity delabe down again upon the pavement; which as they
refrigerate, mix themselves with filth: and hence this concreted heap of
sparks is inquinated, which they call Grecian Spodium, which is of use only
in external affections.

The Spodium of Avicenna, and the rest of the Arabians, if any, is made of very
dissimilar matter, to wit, of the burnt roots of Canes; whereunto Avicenna
attributes so many dowries, that I cannot but admire the man's credulity, or
else simplicity, in writing; seeing it is contrary to reason, that that root by
ustion, which they call Spodium, should recreate the heart, help against
swounding, quench thirst, allay the heat of the stomach, and cure the Palsy,
Melancholy, and other diseases he enumerates.

And grant we, that the Arabian Spodium can effect all these, yet we ought not
to prescribe it, because it comes not at us. Apothecaries in its stead
substitute burnt Ivory, calling it Spodium; whereas it is indeed rather
Antispodium: as also that same they make of fig and Myrrhe-leaves burnt
together, whereof Dioscorides speaks more at large.

But as crude Ivory differs much both in nature and faculties from crude Canes,
so burnt also: for crude Ivory is better then burnt Ivory.

Seeing then the Arabian Spodium cannot be had; or if it could be had, would
not answer to those faculties Avicenn^ puts upon it, and we have no analogous
substitute; it should be ^xpurgen from Medicinal receipts: for there is only
one; and that the Ga^cian Spodium, which may not be assumed at the mouth.

The interpreters of the Barbarians language err in translating the Arabian
Tabaxir, or the Indians Traesir, Spodium; for Tabaxil, according to Garcias, is
a Persian word, denoting a lacteous liquor, or sweet succe, which the
Barbarians call Sacar Mamba; it is got in reeds, or rather trees, which are so
great, that they can make many boats out of one; each whereof being excavated
betwixt two knots, will hold two men, wherein the Indians sail swiftly, and
desond themselves from Crocodiles.

The succe of these trees is very black and cineritious, which they do not
only denominate Spodium, though falsely, but call it burnt ashes by the same
name; whereas Antispodium, according to Dioscorides, is made of ashes: for that
the ashes of Canes may be called Antispodium, and be rightly substituted for
defect of the Grecian Spodium, but not assumed at the mouth. Seeing now there
is no Tabaxir of which they can make Spodium, but ridiculously burn Ivory for
that purpose; we may admit of no Spodium but one, and that the Grecian, which
is a kind of factitious Cadmial; as also Pompholix, whose disquisition we
shall now look into.

CHAP. 12. Of Pompholix.
POmpholix is a small and volatile spark, which while Brass is trying in the
furnace, flies on high, and adheres to its supernal part. At first when it is
made, it goes into bubbles and lumps, which by touching, are disperged: for it
is like white ashes, and so light, that it easily flies up, and like dust,
adheres to the top of the furnace: and while this by its levity is elevated
upward, another sort of sparks by their gravity delabe to the Pavement; which
we call Spodium: so that both are made in one furnace, both have mutual
cognation, and one may supply the defect of another.

Pompholix is by some Seplasiaries called Nil, or Nihil; by other, The Cadmian
Bubble; by the Mauritanians, Tuthia: whereof there are two varieties; one fat,
which is of a brazen color; the other very white and light, which is less
laudable: for Dioscorides says, That the Cyprian is best, which dipped in
Vinegar, smells like Brass, of the color of Pitch, and tasting as dung.

But before it be used, it must be washed thus: The Pompholix must be bound in
a pretty thin linen-cloth, and moved up and down in a vessel full of limpid,
pluvial, or fountain water, that its more useful and tenuious part may flow
into the water, and the impurer and excrementitious remain in the cloth; then
it must settle, and the water be effunded, and clean water affunded, and the
cloth again agitated, till nothing that is useful be left therein. There are
more ways of its ablution described by Dioscorides.

Pompholix is almost the best of all those Medicaments which desiccate without
mordacity, Vires.
and therefore very efficacious in cankerous, and other malignant Ulcers, and
for the running of the eyes. ( Galen 9. Simpl.)

CHAP. 13. Of Litharge.
LItharge is as it were the spume of Metals, purged by fire, or the tenuious
recrement of Silver, purged from its Ceruse, excussed and expelled by the help
of bellows. And though its matter is multifarious, which some make Lead, others
Silver, others Gold, and others Ceruse; yet it draws its origin chiefly from
Lead, which mixed with the recrements of Silver, and melted and cocted in the
fire, is afterward separated; for all the recrements of Silver are easily
separated by fire: which, if they be plumbeous or aereous, as they are
ordinarily, they may by coction be turned into Litharge; which, when cold, is
sometimes aureous, sometimes argenteous, according to the brevity or diuturnity
of its coction.

That which in color resembles Gold, is sometimes called Chrysitis, sometimes
Celauritis; that which represents Silver, Argyritis: not because this contains
Silver in it, or the other Gold, but because they have been each more or less
cocted then other, or have received more or less of the aereous or argenteous
vapor.

For Litharge is most-what made in those furnaces, wherein silver is purged
from Lead, mixed with its recrements: whence it has its name, rather from
silver, then any other Metal; for Litharge portends as much as silver-stone.

All Litharge then is the product of silver; and that which is flave like gold,
is not made of gold, as some think, though it be thence cognominated
Gold-Litharge: for degrees and intentions of heat, do not only change the
color but intend or remit the heat, and vary the name. Thus Diphryges is
named, as though it were twice cocted, which is the sibsident dross of perfect
Brass, cohering to the bottom of the furnace, like the ashes of burnt wood:
when the Brass is taken away, after the the affusion of water; and it is as
sharp as burnt Brass, siccates vehemently, cures rebellious Ulcers; and it may
be made two other ways, according to Dioscorides and Pliny.

Now besides these two sorts of Litharge, Vires.
which Dioscorides makes one, he enumerates other two, to wit, Molybditis,
which is made of sand in furnaces; and another of Leaden plates, which is the
most useful and frequent.

Yet Christis is preferred before all; which should be purged from its Lead and
dross, before it ingrede the Composition of any Medicament: to which end
Dioscorides says, it must be burnt, and washed like Cadmia; but now they only
levigate it in a mortar, putting clear water upon it, and agitating it, then
they cast it into another vessel, and pouring more water upon it, agitate it
again; and when it is again troubled, cast it into the precedent vessel, and
iterate its lotion, till the Lead and dross subside in the mortar, and all its
tenuions substance be educed, which they make to acquiesce, till all the
sincere and pure Litharge rest at the bottom; which when the water is effunded,
they collect and levigate upon a Marble, that the tongue may not perceive any
asperity therein.

Litharge refrigerates, Vires.
astringes, represses, occludes, expletes cavities, exterges, draiv^^ to scars,
and cures gallings by riding.

Finis Libri Secundi.
THE THIRD BOOK OF Medicinal Matter.
TREATING Of Medicaments taken from Animals, either whole or in part.
THE PREFACE.
OUr Mother Nature has produced nothing either imperfect, or in vain, but has
brought forth variety of Plants for the sake of Animals, and several species of
Animals for Plants: Many of them are ordained for Food and Nutriment; some, for
Medicament; and other for Vesture. One Animal is an enemy to another, but all
are subservient to Man: For there is no Insect, how vile and base soever, which
does not afford some prosit to Man. For the most imperfect Creatures, usually
afford the most perfect Remedies; as, from Claws, Horns, Excrements, Blood,
Flesh, Marro^, Testicles, and Bones: Besides, those very wounds which are made
by certain Animals, are cured by the Application of same part of the same
Animal: Nay indeed, the whole Earth does abound with innumerable ^endedies, for
the variety of Maladies. What excellent Virtues do those Medicines afford,
which are derived from humane Bodies! of which first here we intend to speak;
viz. Of Mumy, and Man's Blood: whose faculties to emblazon, would require a
larger Discourse, then this our intend'd brevity will permit.

CHAP. 1. Of Man's Blood.
ALchymists educe a certain Oil, and stillatitious water out of Man's Blood;
the dogmatical only use it to burstness, in whose stead Hogs blood may rightly
be substituted, as Galen advises, who says ( Lib. 3. de Alin.) that Swines
blood does so nearly accede to Man's blood, that he that finds any thing in
Man's blood useful for Medicine, shall find the same in Swines blood.

Blood is Natures Treasury, generated by heat in the greater Veins of the
Liver, which is the prime organ of sanguification, from the purer portion of
Chyle; through which Veins it is carried as it were along tubes to the several
parts of the body for their nutrition: and as long as it is herein contained,
it is liquid and red; but when effunded, it presently concretes: only the
blood of Hearts and Does wanting fibers, concretes not, but remains fluid like
Milk: for Hippocrates averres, That blood concretes not, when the fibers are
taken away.

Now blood being the matter of the whole body, according to the Philosopher;
the blood of man, who is the rule of other Animals, is fincere and thin, hot
and moist, and the best of succes: yet it is not a simple humor, but
participates of Phlegm, and both the Biles: And therefore Hippocrates says,
That the four Humors are the matter of man's generation, as Galen attests (
Lib. 2. de Temp.)

Blood then is an humor generated in the Liver, of a temperate part of Chyle,
moderate in substance and qualities, in color red, in sapour sweet, and
naturally contained in Veins and Arteries, whereby it is directed to all parts
( Lib. 3. de Part. Animal.) for as water is from one fountain and original,
deduced into many rivulets, others arising from these, till the humor pervade
all Regions: so Nature has directed blood through the whole body, it being the
matter of the whole.

The blood of a diseased or intemperate man, must not be collected and kept in
shops, for the confection of any Emplaister; but from some temperate and sound
man, if it may be had; as the blood of such as are beheaded: for their Veins
and Arteries being cut together, their veinous and arterious blood is
promiscuously collected.

Yet neither the blood of this, or any other Animal, is of much value or virtue
in the confecture of astrictive salves, because by siccation and asservation,
it neither retains any of its native bonity, nor yet assumes any excellent
acquisititious quality.

CHAP. 2. Of Mumy.
RHasis and Avicenna contend, That Mumy is an Arabic word, denoting
Pissaphaltum; Isaac says, It is a Persian word, signifying a certain liquor,
found in Sepultures, where aromatized carcases had been long reconded: one
fellow calls it Cerops; upon what ground I know not, unless because it has the
consistency of Wax; for Number with the Persians denotes Wax.

It is found only in the Tombs of Egyptian Kings and Nobles, who hearing of a
Resurrection, made their bodies be condited with Myrrh, Cinnamome, Aloes, and
other Spices, that they might conserve them.

But many years after, when the Soldiers in time of Wars devastated all
places, everting Sepulchers, they found in some coffins a certain odorate and
pleasant liquor, of the spissitude of honey; which, when the Egyptian Medicks
and Philosophers judged upon good grounds to be endued with eximious faculties,
they believed it might work the cure of some affections, and therefore they
made trial of it, and found the event answerable to their opinions; they
restoring many to sanity thereby.

They then being imboldened by this experience, sought this conditure in other
Noble-mens Sepulchers, which they inverted, and exhausted: yea, they so much
envied the happiness of the dead men's bones, that they robbed poor men's coffins
of their corruption: which cadaverous liquor they called Mumy, and gave it to
the fick.

Nay, it was of so much fame presently, that they would insperge a little Salt
and Alome on the carcases of such as dyed of the French disease, Leprosy, or
Scab, and after a few months collect their putrid matter, and fell it for
Mumy: and, what is more horrible, they would take the dead carcases of such as
had been suffocated and dried in the sands of Arabia, and call them Mumy, and
give them to the diseased, to be assumed at the mouth.

Yea, many are in that error still, that Mumy is only the cadaverous and dry
flesh of bodies corrupted and putrid. Yea, I remember I heard a man of much
learning, but no great skill in Medicine, amongst a company of famous men,
speaking of Mumy, and all contending, that now we had no true Mumy, but a
little tabid, foetid, corrupt flesh, in respect of that which was found in the
Egyptian Kings Sepulchers, which was both fragrant and virtuous, say, That
Mumy was the flesh of dried bodies; and that he had seen it lately dried, while
it was adherent to the ribs.

Thus this impious opinion adheres to the minds of the eredulous, who
collecting some filthy matter from man's flesh, a wicked custom indeed,
introduced by wretched men, exhibit it to the sick. We are so far from
possessing the Mumy of the ancient Egyptians, Mumia antiquorum non amplius
haberi.
which was but small, and soon spent, that we cannot have Avicenna his Mumy,
which was made of man's corruption, mixed with Pissaphaltum, but are content
with the succe expressed out of putrid carcases, and inspissated, which is now
kept in Pharmacopolies, to men's greatest peril; which perite and prudent men
never use in Medicine: for it is absurd to think, that this Mumy should help
such as are hurt by falling; nay, will it not rather harm them; and all that
use it? for if we fear that any ones blood should clot by falling, have we not
Posca and Oxymel, and other inciding Medicaments more conducible?

But seeing no Compound in our Shop requires man's Fat, no more of that.

CHAP. 3. Of Goats Blood.
GOats are either peregrine and cornuted, as the Ethiopian and Cretian; Goats;
or vernacular: some whereof have horns, others not: The blood of either, duly
prepared, as we have taught in our Shop, is very effectual in breaking the
stone; and is the basis of that eximious Medicament we call Lithos Tripticos,
to whose comment we have adjoined this Preparation.

Now there are many varieties of peregrine Goats; amongst which, the Persian
Goat, which they call, Pazan, is most commended, out of whose belly the
Bezar-stone is taken, which is commended against the virulent bitings of
Animals, Poisons, and many malignant Diseases, as we shall declare more at
large by and by.

The Cretian Goat, is so called from the Isle Crete, which nourishes no Wolves,
no more then England: the French call it Boucestain: it is vested with short
and flave hair, bearing two horns crooked backwards; it is so agile an Animal,
that it will leap from one rock to another, though six paces distant. Bellonius.

Amongst wilde-Goats, we enumerate Mountain-Goats, Rock-Goats, African-Goats,
Bucks, and Roe-bucks; and yet these Animals differ much from one another, and
all from our indigenous Goat, which alone of Animals patiently and willingly
admits a companion in venery: whence by a Sarcasm we call him a Cornuto,
Goat-like, that patiently tolerates it.

Strepsicetos is by some called a Goat; but I rather think it a Ram: it has
two horns striated, but like the Unicorns horns erect, never used in Medicine.

Strepsiceros, brings me to think of Monoceros, which many douht is a mere
Chimaera: for, if it have a being, it is so rare, that it never was seen; and
because it is rare, because its nature is unknown; and because that such as
write of it, dissent amongst themselves, men doubt of its being.

Yet that there is such a Beast, the holy Scriptures aver, and its horn,
which is daily seen, and prescribed by Medicks against poisons and poisonous
affections: Yet I set no less estimate upon Hearts or Rhinoceros his horn, then
Monoceros his horn, of which many write more then truth. What kind of Animal
it is, of what nature, where it lives, and what virtues its horn is endued
with, shall be hereafter more largely explicated.

CHAP. 4. Of Hares Blood.
BOth wise men assert, and experience proves, That Hares blood roasted breaks
the stone. This Animal is most notorious, most fearful, and swiftest; which
alone, according to Aristotle, has hair in its mouth, and under its feet. Some
say they have seen white Hares; but it is certain, that they are not so, only
they appear such in winter, while they are covered with snow, as with a white
garment.

One D. de Vitri, an eximious Nobleman, caught a cornuted Hare, whose horns
he gave King James of England. It is fabulous, that Hares participate of both
Sexes hermaphroditically, and that they can both beget, conceive, and bear.

And the blood is not only so efficacious, but the whole Hare usted in an
earthen pot well covered, and taken with some Whitewine, water, or fit
decoction, breaks and expels stones, and therefore rightly accedes to
Lithontripticons confection.

There is also the Sea-hare, so called, because generated in the Sea: it
resembles our Land-hares; which is very much an enemy to the Lungs, and Women
with Child: of which see Rondeletius.

CHAP. 5. Of Fats; and first of Hearts Marrow.
Marrow is in every Animal the aliment of its bones; it califies, allayes
dolor, resolves, mollifies hard tumors in any part; but especially Hearts
Marrow; next to that is Calves Marrow: the Marrow of other Animals is sharper,
and more intemperate.

A Heart is a well-known Animal, which superates all other cornigerous beasts,
both in pulchritude of form, amplitude of horns, and variety of branches: But
nature denied horns to Deer; and those that first erupt out of the Male, are
erect without branches: whence the Bucks are called Subulones: afterward their
horns are bifidous, afterward trifidous: they are at first vested with a skin,
and soft Down; but after they are expofed a while to the Sun, they become
rough, hard, and glabre.

All cornigerous Animals, except the Heart, bear hollow horns; but his are all
over solid, which fall off yearly; and then being disarmed, he hides himself
daily, till new ones erupt; and these cornicles are as roborative, and as much
resist venenate affections, as Monoceros his horn. Experience has also proved,
That a Hearts genitals are very efficacious in curing the Pleurisy, Colic,
and Dysentery. There is a certain concreted liquor, Gumme-like, which we call
Harts-tears, in the greater angle of an old Hearts eye, which by an admirable
propriety moves sudour copiously, and oppugnes the venenate quality of the
Pestilence, and other malign affections.

Eutyceros and Platyceros are a kind of Hearts: But I leave the nature of them
to be described by such as undertake the absolute History of Animals.

CHAP. 6. Of Goats Suet.
MArrow, Suet, Fat, and Grease, have much cognation each with other, which are
only found in Animals endued with blood, but not all in all; for some are
only proper to some beasts, as Suet to cornigerous Animals, Fat to some
cloven-footed Animals, all Birds, and many four-footed Beasts; which is that
same which the French, when salted, call Vicil oing; when fresh, Saing doulx.

Now Suet differs from Fat or Grease, in that it is fragile, and concretes by
cold; whereas Grease is liquid, and may not be hardened: they differ also in
place; for Fat is found betwixt the skin and flesh, Suet always in the panicle
about the Reins; and in the end is flesh.

Those Animals whose blood is more corpulent, have more of Suet; for Suet,
according to the Philosopher, is terrene; and hence it is coagulated like
fibrous blood: wherefore, such cornigerous Animals as are not toothed on both
sides, being by nature dry and terrene, are pregnant with Suet; but such as are
not cornigerous, and yet toothed on both sides, have Fat in its stead, which
being not terrene, is not coagulated.

Therefore Suet being made more terrene then Fat, is therefore taken for the
Confection of Unguenti Citrinum; if it be not the Fat of a Goat, or a Ram, or a
Kid; for those are proper: Concerning which, to speak more words is in vain.

CHAP. 7. Of Swines Grease.
AXungia, or Grease, is so denominated ab axibus unguendis, from greasing
Axle-trees, that the wheels may run more easily and smoothly: yet it is of much
use in Medicine, especially Swines grease, to the confection of certain
unguents and salves; which is most liquid, flowing like Oil; yea, it mollifies,
concocts, and resolves more then Oil; it is endued with a lenitive and
anodynous quality: and thence it may be usefully adhibited, to mitigate the
acrimony of humors, allay dolours, temper inflammations, and resolve humors;
or aptly mixed with Cataplasms, instituted to the same effects. The grease of
hotter Animals, as of Lions, is more efficacious in resolving: for a Swine is
not intemperate in the first qualities, and therefore it waxes so soon fat, and
is so multiparous, being stimulated to venery, and exercising congress before
the year end. Its Snout is repanded, its neck short and crafs, hispid with
rigid bristles: the Males resticles, which are not long, hang behind, as in
other four-footed Animals: its teeth are long and bended; but the Female want
such fangs, or at least they are not so perspicuous: both of them have intorted
tails; as also a Boar, which is a wild Swine.

CHAP. 8. Of Bears Grease.
BEars Grease, is hotter and dryer then Swines, but colder and moister then
Lions Grease: it is not only commended solely to Moulds in the heels, and
falling of hair, but mixed with other resolvent unguents, to make them more
efficacious.

A Bear is an Animal of a horrid aspect and vociferation; for its voice is
iracund, minacious, and full of terror: its mouth is very patulous, its teeth
serrated, its nostrils wide, its ears decurtated, its whole body rough, with
prolix hairs, and its tail so short, as it can scarce be perceived.

The She-Bear is very venereous, often sollicitating the Male to congress,
lying on her back, and amplecting him: her young is not without form till she
lick them, as it is commonly credited: which error Scaliger disproves, ( Exer.
15. contra Cardan.)

CHAP. 9. Of Goose Grease.
ALl Greases are somewhat ungrateful, subverting the ventricle, except Goose
grease, which participating of some suavity, is more expetible in culinary
matters; and it is much celebrated in Pharmacopolies: also being adhibited
alone to the ear, against that noise that precedes hardness of hearing; and is
also mixed with many other resolvent Medicaments.

A Goose is both carnivorous, and frugivorous, conversant both in watery and
plain places, both domestic and wild, changing its seat and soly at certain
times; they fly by companies like Cranes.

Some superstitiously believe, That Geese are as good keepers as Dogs, because
one by chance saved the Capitol, awaking the Soldiers with its profound
clamor; who seeing a few Frenchmen ascending the walls with Ladders, fell
upon them with violence, and routed them. For which benefit, the Romans held
Geese sacred a long time: But after a while, deposing this Superstition, they
used Geese in their Banquets; they yielding very laudable alimony and odor
when they are roasted, and grateful sapour when eaten: Some refer Swans, and the
like, to this kind: but Cooks have more to do therewith then Apothecaries.

CHAP. 10. Of Ducks Grease.
Ducks Grease is also of use in Medicine, which we adhibit by it self to the
dolor of the joints, and mixed with other Medicaments and Salves, to the cold
distemper of the nerves; for it is mollitive, calefactive, resolvent, and
anodynous.

A Duck is of the kind of whole-footed Birds; which whether domestic or
wild, equally delights in dry and in moist places. Some of the domestic Ducks
are all white, others all black, others like Piets, partly white, partly black;
and others subcineritious, as all wild ones are.

Drakes, whether domestic or wild, are greater, and more variegated in
color, then Ducks; especially about their wings and necks, where their Plumes
are mixed with a caeruleously green.

The flesh of fat wilde-Ducks, though hard, is sweet, and gets good blood; but
that of the domestic is more excrementitious and insuave, for they feed upon
unwholesome edibles; as guts, and often Toads, which they sometimes swallow
whole.

Many think, that the Pontian Ducks feed upon poisons: whence Mithridates mixed
their blood with Antidotes against poison: they live for the most part in
Rivers, Lakes, and Fenny places. Many other Birds, as Teals, and the like, are
referred to this kind.

CHAP. 11. Of Capons Grease.
CApons grease is of a middle nature, betwixt Swines and Goose grease: when
fresh, Vires.
it is good against the affections of the Womb; it conduces also to the clefts
in the lips, dolours of the ears, and swellings of the paps: when it is old, it
califies and resolves more potently.

A Hen is of Birds most useful to man, and most foecund: for besides her flesh,
which she gives to him for meat, she always exhilits most commodious soeture;
for they daily either lay or sit on Eggs, or exclude Chickens; which, while
very young, are desired by some; when more adult, pleasant to all palates; and
when saginated and castorated, fit for Courtiers.

For this kind of flesh, is of all most easy of concoction, of the best
succe, and most idoneous for all natures and temperaments. I do not approve of
their sentence, who rather prescribe the broth of an old Cock, which is always
maculent, then of a young one sat and good, to their Patients. I prefer the
broth of a Capon or fat Hen, before this; and if there be necessity of some
nitrous quality, I would seek it elsewhere; for all Cocks are fleshless and
succeless; but especially old ones, because they have spent all their laudable
succe in venery.

We have three sorts of men; one whereof superates the rest in magnitude, whose
bills and feet are lureous, which lay greater Eggs, and are less foecund; as
the Londunian Hens, which Va^r^ calls Medical, because they were brought from
Media.

Others are smaller, with crisped feathers, which fall off more thence once in
a year; so that they are sometimes implumeous in winter: others are the vulgar,
which are continually vested with feathers; some whereof are black, which are
thought the best; others white, the worst; and others variegated, which are
thought to be in a mean.

Some prescribe the interior tunicle of a Hens second ventricle, to such as
have weak stomachs, to help the coctive faculty; but without answerable
success: for its temper is vitiated by the Hens death and desiccation, and its
coctive quality perished; for it is certain, that there are many things in an
Animal, when living, that perish by death.

Besides, there are many more Country Hens, as the Water-Hen, and the
Mountain-Hen, called Modcock, or Woodcock.

There are also peregrine-Hens, as Turkey-Hens, and Phasians, and Meleagrian,
or African-Hens, whose variegated color gave a name to a certain Herb, bearing
a variously maculated flower.

And as the color of many birds is various, so of their eggs also; as the
eggs of Partridges, Pey-hens, Turkey-hens; but ours are always white, as also
the eggs of our Geese, Ducks, and Stock-doves.

We often use eggs in Medicine; for we solve yolks in Glysters, and we can
scarce wash Turpentine with their adjument: we extract Oil out of them, when
hardened; and we have an eximsous Electuary denominated from eggs, which is
much commended against the Plague.

But we use them most in Cibaries: for Hippocrates says, They have something
of strength in them, because they are the matter of Animals; they nourish,
because they are the Milk of Chickens; and they increase, because they diffuse
themselves much.

Soft eggs are most nutritive; hard and fried eggs, bad: Hens, Phasians, and
Partridges eggs, the best of the kind.

Galen says, An egg admits only of one pravity, and that comes by age, which
you may eschew, if you take them while new.

CHAP. 12. Of Butter.
OUt of the more terrene part of the Milk, we have Cheese; and out of the
fatter, which we call Cream, by much agitation in a Churn, comes Butter, which
is had in delight by many Nations, because it affects the palate with its
suavity; as Normanish Butter, which the Incolists condite with Salt in earthen
Pots, and send into all parts of France, where it supplies the place of Oil;
for it emends the sapour of many dishes, and makes them more expetible.

It is usefully mixed to the Eclegm de Pineis, and many extrinsecal Medicaments
instituted to lenisie, humectate, mollify, and allay dolours: for, being hot
and oleous, it helps the disease in the groyns; and Impostnumes in the head: It
cocts humors lodging in the breast, by way of liniment, and solves the
ventricle; but especially the Butter of Cows Milk, which is more copious,
better, sweeter, and wholesomer: for some make Butter of Sheep and Goats-milk,
but that we do not approve of.

Now this vaccineous kind is distinguished by four degrees in age: the first
is of Calves, the second of Heisers, the third of young Kine, and the fourth of
old ones. The Herdsmen call a barren Cow Taura, and a pregnant one Horda, or
Forda.

Cattle change the habit of their bodies, color of their hairs, and nature,
according to the state and condition of the soil and heavens in several
Regions. Hence Asiatical Cattle have one form, Epyrean another, and French
another.

Cattle, whether Male or Female, are cornigerous; yet in Mysia, and about
Maeotis, they have no horns; and in India they have sometimes but one horn
apiece, and others three horns. The Aonian Cow has but one horn in the middle
of its forehead, Unicornlike.

There are more varieties of Oxen and Kine; which to discuss exactly,
appertains not to us: for, it is enough if we say, That Milk and Butter,
whereof we have some use in Pharmacy, comes of Kine; for Milk does not only
nourish, as it is white blood, but cure many affections of the Dysentery,
Consumption, and vices of the Lungs; for which, Asses Milk is best, next to
Woman's.

Cattle suppeditate so many and so great commodities to man, that they can
scarce be enumerated: for, the Ox is not only his companion in his Labor and
Agriculture while he lives, but when killed, his Tables ornament, and his own
firm and laudable aliment.

To this family we may refer Buffs, Bugles, wild Oxen, and Ethiopian Bulls:
The description of whose nature, I leave to them that write the perfect History
of Animals.

CHAP. 13. Of Foxes Lungs.
MEsue commends Foxes Lungs to the vices of the Lungs, and from them
denominates a certain Eclegme, which, he says conduces to such as are in a
Consumption; but, that I may speak freely, their ungrateful sapour, and
stinking odor, cause very learned men to judge them less efficacious then they
are thought.

A Fox is a crafty Animal, with a bushy tail, and an osseous genital, apt to
break and expel the stone: he lays wait for Hens, and other young birds, and
Hares also; he makes himself a deep cave, with many turnings and holes, much
distant from each other, that he may better delude the hunters.

His flesh is dry and digestive; the oil wherein he is elixated, Vires.
is called Foxes Oil: it evokes humors to the external superficies of the
body, and discusses them: whence it is convenient to the Gout.

His fat melted, and poured into the ear diseased, allayes its dolor.

CHAP. 14. Of the Beaver's stones, called Castor-Cuds.
CAstor Castorium, is apt and expetible for many Medicinal uses. Now a Castor
is an amphibious Animal, whitely cineritious, and black on the back, living
partly on the water, and partly on the earth, sucking meat from both places,
like an Otter; to which it is very like, except in its tail; which is glabre,
broad, and squamous, Fish-like; but the Otters is long, round, hispid, and
yellow, as its whole body is also.

There are many Castors about the rivers in Pontus, and also in the sens in
Spain; but their stones have not the same faculty with them of Galatia.

The Castor will bite horridly; for if it catch hold of a man, it will not let
the part go, till it feel and hear the broken bones crack, and rub one against
another: its testicles are chiefly Medicinal; which it does not bite off with
its own teeth, when pursued by hunters, as it is sabulously storyed of it.

The unequal testicles must be chused for Medicaments, which depend upon one
string, pregnant with a watery humor, graveolent, and bitter to the gust. This
Medicament is both famous and useful, according to Galen, insomuch as
Archigenes wrote a whole book of the use of Beavers-stones.

They califie manifestly, Vires.
cure Serpents poison, move fluors and delivery, help Lethargy, and
sluggishness, and the affections of the Nerves.

CHAP. 15. Of Animals Excrements; and first of Musk.
SOme Animals are hunted and taken for meat, as Hearts, Hares, and Boars; others
for Medicine, as Vipers; others for pleasure and odorament, as the Musk and
Civet-Cat; the Beaver also and Badger, for Medicaments and vesture.

Musk is the name of an excrement, and of the Animal whose excrement it is: the
Animal is exotical, being in India in the Kingdom of Pegu, not much unlike a
she-goat, with a praegrand body: they call it the Musk-Buck, the Musk-Roe, and
the Musk-Goat; out of whose inferior jaw, there erupts as many teeth, and as
great as them of Hogs.

When this beast is moved with venery, her umbilical region swells through the
vehemence of her fury; and there much crass blood being congested, makes up an
imposthume, and then the fierce Animal refuses all meat and drinks, convolving
it self along the ground, and rubbing the part swelled against trees and stones
with pleasure, till it breaks and opens its bladder; out of which, corrupt
matter runs, which is true Musk; of all things, the most odorate and
suaveolent, in bonity much superating all the varieties of Musk we see.

This corruption left upon stones, and trunks of trees, is by the heat of the
Sun, and influence of the heavens, cocted and elaborated; and its foetid odor,
if it had any, dissipated; and so it becomes most excellent Musk, which none
but Kings and Noblemen obtain. But that which is ordinarily sold, is far
inferior, being drawn from Animals catched by hunting. For when the hunters
catch this beast, they abscind its hide, with some flesh; express, collect,
exsiccate its blood, with its utricles and skin; whose dried blood, mixed with
a small portion of its recrements, they sell for pure Musk.

There is a kind of greater Weasel, which being Martial and pugnaceous, they
call Martes (for it kills great Hens sometimes) whose excrements, as I have often
observed, smell like Musk.

There are also some plants and fruits, which affect the nostrils and palate
with this Musky suavity; as sweet-Storks bill, Muskrose, and Pears, that savor
of Musk.

The faculties of Musk are eximious; for it roborates and exhilarates a cold
and fearful heart, and conduces to all its affections; it also recreates the
brain, and refreshes the spirits: it is hot in the secand, and dry in the third
degree.

CHAP. 16. Of Civet.
THree Animals are suaveolent: the Panther; (which many say smells gratefully
only to beasts, and not to men) the Muskgoat; and the Civet-Cat, which the
Greeks call Zapetion; about whose nature the Ancients do not well agree. It is
a wild Animal, with horrid teeth, not so like a Cat as many write; for it is
greater, exceeding in magnitude sometimes a Wolf: its head, neck, feet, and
other parts, are very unlike a Cat's; its mouth is long; like a Badgers mouth;
its body long; its inferior jaw white, as also its beard; its feet black; the
lateral parts of its belly white; its back obscurely cineritious, and somewhat
maculated; its excrement is called Civet: which for its fragrancy rich men
desire, and for its efficacy Medicks celebrate.

Civet then is an odorament different from Musk, most sweet, fat, trasse, and
blackish, desumed from an Animal, thence called Civet-Cat: for, it is the
sudour of this beast, concreting about its testicles and privities; which men
erade with a Spoon.

It is an Indian Animal, now cicurated, and frequent in Europe, daily seen, and
kept in many men's houses in Lutetia. Now that it may suggest more abundance of
this recrement, it must be irritated, wearied, and provoked to anger; for then
its genitals will emit much sudour, which they afterward erade. At first when
deraded, it is graveolent to some men; but when it is concreted, and exposed to
the air, it deposes its virulency, and acquires a most grateful suavity.

As its odor challenges affinity with Musk; so also does its quality: Vires.
but it most conduces to the strangulation of the Uterus, if a few of its
grains be imposed into the cavity of the Navel.

Both Patients and Physicians eschew the dung of Animals, because of its
foetour and ungrateful sapour: and ingenuous men had rather seek, handle, and
exhibit Medicaments, then putrid excrements. Yet Mouse-dung, with white wind,
is good to break and exclude the stone; Dogs-dung cures the Quinsie; Man's dung
is much commended in swellings: Nothing is so good a cure for the Epilepsie,
which comes from the consent of the inferior parts, and ascent of the more
tenuious matter to the head, as Peacocks-dung. But seeing such excrements
ingrede not the composition of our Medicaments, we will not trouble our selves
with them.

CHAP. 17. Of Isinglass.
THere are many kinds of glewish substances in Apothecaries shops; one whereof
is a Minefal, which is apt to conjoyn Gold, and thence called Chrysocolla;
another which glutinates wounds and flesh, and stays the fluxes of the eyes;
which is a Gum of a certain Tree in Persia; this they call Sarcocolla: of
these before: a third sort is made of Cattels hides, which they call Homglew,
and from its use in conjoyning wood, VVood-glew: there is also a glue made of
the belly of a certain fish, called Ichthyocola, whose faculty being to fill
up, siccate, and to mollify a little, it is rightly mixed with glutinative
salves, and others, that take away spots, and erugate the face; the Arabians
call it Alcanna.

And as Taurocolla is not only made of Bulls hides, but of the ears and feet
of all four-footed beasts: so Ichthyocolla.
Fish-glew is not only made of the belly of one fish, but all viscid and
glutinous ones; but especially of that fish which Rondeletius calls Boneless,
others Molua.

The Boneless fish is cetaceous, and cartilagineous; without scales, fins, and
bones, except a very few. Its head is very crasse and broad; its mouth large,
out of whose upper-jaw proceed soft, long, and pendulous bones; its flesh is
glutinous, and ungrateful, unless it be long condited in Salt before it be
eaten.

This Fish-glew is not only made of the skin, but also the intestines,
ventricle, fins, and tail of this fish; after this manner: The said parts are
cut small, Mow it is made.
put in a new earthen pot, with a sufficient quantity of hot water, and so
macerated a day or two; then cocted on a slow fire, till they acquire the
consistency of Cream, or a Pultess; then they are taken from the fire, and,
while warm, out into small pieces, lest they should be made into a great mass.

CHAP. 18. Of Woolls Grease.
ISopus is the humid pinguetude of greasy Wool, Isopus, quid
extracted by art and concreted, whereof Phyliagrus makes a salve called
Oesyanun; which is commended to the dolours of the Spleen, the hardness of the
Stomach and Liver, and Nodosities of other parts: for this grease expletes and
mollifies, Vires.
especially the Ulcers of the Fundament and Matrix, with honey and butter: it
califies without excess, and allayes dolor.

And thus they confect this Isopus, the succulent wool of the necks: The
foeminals and thighs of Sheep, The manner of making it.
they take and macerate eight hours in hot water, agitating it with a rudicle
or stick; then they fervefie it, till it leave all its pinguetude in the water.

Then the wool being compressed and removed, that fat and fordid water is
poured from on high, that it may cause much spume; which spume they agitate so
long in the water, till none be left.

This done, they collect the pinguetude, and wash it, agitating it with their
hands in pure water, till it will neither astringe, nor bite the tongue much,
and till it appear white; then they repose it in an earthen vessel: and all
this should be done in the hot Sun. Some add Seawater to the lotion; but this
way is best.

Sheep are known to all Nations, suppeditating infinite commodities to men;
with whose wool they are vested, with whose flesh they are nourished, and with
whose dung their fields become fat and foecund.

Young sheep are called Lambs; the greater Rams, or Arietes, from Ara, or the
Altar whereon they were frequently sacrificed; the gelded ones VVeathers, which
differ from Rams, as Geldings from Horses, Capons from Cocks: They call the
leader Bell-weather.

The Ram, which the French call Bellerium, from warring, as it is probable, is
commendable when tall, with a promise belly, a long tail, a white and dense
fleece, broad forehead, intorted and p^^^lous horns, brown eyes, ample ears,
ample breast, shoulders, and butocks also.

Arabia produces two admirable kinds of Rams; the one with so long a tail,
that it is no shorter then three cubits; another with a tall of a cubits
breadth: other sheep are well known.

CHAP. 19. Of Medicinal Bones; and first of a Hart's heart-bone.
IF Animals excrements, which are foetid, be endued with a commendititious
faculty to the cure of some affections; as Dogs dung, which some Merry Blades
call Album Graecum, to the Quinsie; then much more their integrant parts; as
the Elks claws to the Epilepsie, Goats claws to such as piss their beds, and
the bones of many fishes, birds and beasts, to other diseases.

Man's bone is also Man's Medicine; for a man's Scull unburied, duly prepared, and
exhibited, cures the Falling Sickness. Experience also shows, That a Hearts
heart-bone, a Rhinocerots horn, Elephants, Boars, and Pikes teeth, conduce to
many diseases.

A Heart much augments Medicinary Materials; for thereunto it suggests its
Horns, Suet, Fat, Marrow, Lachryma, Yard, and that Ossicle which is found in
the basis of its heart.

A Heart is a most noble Animal, superating almost all others in pulchtitude,
celerity, dignity, and utility; and hence Kings only, or their Servants, were
wont to hunt them. Their flesh also adoms large banquets; and that which is
inconvenient for Tables, locupletates Apothecaries Shops.

But that Ossicle which adheres to the basis of an old Hearts heart, Vires.
is most celebrated; which from its figure much resembling a cross, hunters
call the Hearts cross; which they by experience, and Apothecaries by reason,
have found very conducible to the affections of the heart.

Young Hearts have only a cartilage, no bone.

In inveterate Hearts, there concretes a certain lachryma in the larger angle of
their eyes, which admirably produces sudour, and conduces to venenate diseases,
as we showed before; This hearts bone ingredes the confection of Diamoschum,
that it may make it more cordial and officacious.

CHAP. 20. Of Ivory.
THe Elephant is of four-footed beasts the greatest, and most obsequious to
man; for it does not only obey him, but his voice, taking and doing his
commands: yea, some would answer their Masters commanding them, with hoo, hoo,
that is, in the barbarous Idiome, I will, I will.

Aelianus saw one writing Latin Letters, straight, and in order, upon a table;
but his teachers hand was underneath, directing the Animal to the figure and
lineament: and when the Elephant wrote, its eyes were fixed, and dejected,
Grammarian-like, on his Master.

Oppianus says, That it is an old Proverb, That Elephants talk with one
another, but cannot be understood by any man, save their Tamers.

Elephants come so near man's ingeny, that they are judged more pradent then men
in some places.

They are obsequious, desirous of glory, mindeful of benefits and injuries
received, and desirous of retribution or revenge.

That of Aelianus is known, how an Elephant seeing his Master take some of his
due from him, and put it in his pot; when he was commanded by his Master, to
take care that his corn should be reaped and prepared, stole a good part of his
barley, putting little stones in in its stead, and so gave his Master his due
measure and wonted heap, and kept enough for himself: thus craftily vindicating
himself for his former injury.

He has small eyes in reference to his great body; he has a long Snout, in
stead of a Nose, which he uses in stead of a hand, especially in assuming and
ingesting meat and drink; he has a very small tongue; four short and crass
teeth on each jaw, wherewith he breaks and mollifies his aliment; and two very
long and very crass ones, which are liker horns: these fall out at set times,
and grow again.

And the matter of these is Ivory, which is accommodated to infinite uses,
especially Medicinal.

And this is that which many Apothecaries burn, and erroneously conceit to be
the Arabian factitious Spodium.

And yet it cannot be rightly substituted for Spodium, neither when burnt, nor
crude; for by ustion its virtue perishes: and when it is crude, it is no ways
analogal to Spodium: for in proper locution, there is only one kind of
Spodium, viz. the Grecian Spodium, which they call Pompholix.

But the Arabian's falsely supposed Spodium, is Tabaxir, which agrees as much
with burnt Ivory, as Sugar with Rhabarbe: of which we have more largely
disserted elsewhere.

Crude Ivory has many eximious faculties: for, Vires.
it roborates all bowels, refrigerates and astringes moderately, aligates the
dolours of the stomach, cohibits vomiting, kills worms, liberates from
diuturnal obstructions; and drunk, makes women more apt to conceive.

CHAP. 21. Of the Unicorns-horn.
IF any Animals naturally void of horns, be by chance seen cornuted, we think
them monstrous, as the rustic Caenomanus, on whose front grew a crass horn of
two palms length, incurvated toward the hinder part of his head; which we saw
for a miracle in Paris, in the year 1600. I never heard of the like, save of
one man, that Philippus Ingrassias makes mention of, who had a horn on his back.

Yet there are many cornigerous Animals, especially of the Malekinde,
bicornuted, as the Ox, and Goat; others tricornuted, as some Indian Oxen; and
some quadricornuted, as I have seen some Rams.

Some also bear but one horn, as the Indian Ass; some Kine in Zeila of
Aethiopia; the amphibious Animal Camphur, frequent in the Isles of Molucca;
also some Ethiopian Birds, and some Fishes; as the Uletif, frequent in the
Indian Sea.

But that Animal celebrated not only in humane but divine Scriptures, which
the Hebrews call Rem and Reem; Avicenna, Achercheden; the Arabian, Barkaran;
the Greeks, Monoceros; the Latins, Unicornis; the Indians, Cartazontes; the
French, Licornia; and we Unicorne, excels all these in dignity.

Diverse Authors have written variously of this Animal; some making it tall,
others low; some wild and sylvestrian, others not only cicurated by art, but
tamed by the sight of a Girl; sometimes lying to sleep beside her, as being
delighted with her love and odor: some make its horn black, others yellow, and
others white.

Yet they who have lustrated the Newfound world, say, that an Unicorn is lower
and slenderer then an Elephant, equalizing in magnitude an ordinary Horse; of a
musteline or yellowish color; and some say, subcineritous, with a Hearts head,
no long neck, a short Mane, rare, and hanging on one side; a rough beard, but
short; bifideous hoofes, not thick legs, and a tail like a Boar. (Solin. Plin.
Aelian.)

It bears its horn, which is straight, crass, intorted, four or five foot long,
according to its age; solid, hard, squamous, yet not clefted; yellowish
without, eburneous within, but not undulated with any lines, and obvallated
with a kind of crass skin, dirempted in circular line from other parts, which
Merchants ineptly call its Lard.

Seeing then that an Unicorn is an Animal both rare and wild, not cicurable,
unless it be caught while very young, and its horns do not fall off annually,
as Harts-horns do; it is no wonder if its horn be so rare and precious: yet
there is one exceeding a man's procerity, kept as a rich treasure in St.
Dionysius his Temple beside Paris, and many little pieces in every Parisian
Pharmacopoly, that such may be helped as require its exhibition.

It is much commended against poison, Vires.
and to exhilarate and roborate the Noble parts; and therefore it is given to
the pestilent, and such as are infected with contagious and venenate diseases:
yet all patients being not equally rich, it is only exhibited to the richer;
to others I prescribe Rhinoceros, and Hartshorn, with no less success.

CHAP. 22. Of the Bezaar-stone.
THe Bezaar-stone is either so called from an oriential Animal out of which it
is had, which the Persians call Pasan, and sometimes Bazar, and the Indians
Bezar; or else from is Bezardical, that is, alexiterial faculty, wherein it is
eximious against poison: and upon that account, a certain Metalline alexiterian
stone, is by some Arabians called Bezardical, because they say the Bezaar-stone
will expugne all poisons.

But this Bezaar-stone now in frequent use, is not effoded out of Mines, but
taken out of the belly and internals of a certain Animal, most frequent in
Persia, Coraso, and the promontory of Comorim, near Chyma, which such as have
have seen it call a Goat; the incolists call it a Mountain-Goat; for in form
and magnitude it resembles an European Goat, but its hair is shorter; it is
taller, equalizing a Heart in procerity: and it seems to be rightly denominated
Hart-Goat, because it partly bears the nature of a Heart, partly of a Goat.

It is a most agile, swift, and fierce Animal, easily leaping from rock to
rock, and sometime turning upon the Indian hunters, and killing them; it has
bifidous ungles, like a Goat, slender legs, a prominent and short tail, a rough
body Goat-like, but shorter hair, cineriously yellow, like a Heart; a Goats head
armed with two horns crooked backwards, and ending in an obtuse point, very
black and hollow, in their crasser part, obsited with many tubercles: I saw two
at Cowbertum in the Castle of Dom. de Virty.

The aforesaid stone is generated in this Animals belly; whose magnitude, form
and color, are various, according to the nature and age of the Beast; for
there are greater stones in the greater and elder beast, lesser in the lesser
and younger; all are of an oval figure, but some rounder then others, and
others more quadrate.

Their color is obscure and blackish, or yellow, and more pallid, according to
the Animals temperature; whereof such as generate greater and crasser stones,
are less agile, and less apt to run or leap, which live more sadly, and are at
the first sight known by hunters. Perhaps these stones are offensive, and
preternatural to these Animals, as the stone is to man.

They are generated corticatery, from a small rudiment of coagmentated sand,
which is by the apposition of some new humor agglutinated, assimilated, and
wrought into certain crass plates like onyons, according to the magnitude of
the dust, and apposition of the appellent humor.

This sand or dust in the center of the stone, is of more efficacy then any
other part of the stone; all whereof, whether internal or external, are smooth,
polite, and splendent: which are not so in adulterate stones, wherein there is
no dust or sand.

The Persians are the best of Bezaar-stones, next the oriental; but especially
those that are taken out of Animals living in the Persian Mountains; for those
that live in plains and valleys, feed not upon so salutary plants, as those
that inhabit excelse plants: and therefore their stones are not so efficacious.

All of them are much commended against the bitings of venenate beasts: Vires.
for their powder assumed or adhibited, cures wounds inflicted by Scorpions,
Vipers, or other Serpents; and insperged on the same Animals, makes them torpid
and innocuous. It is storyed, that the King of Corduba was freed from a very
pernicious poison, by the use of this stone; and therefore some think, Bezaar
is rightly deduced from Bell in Hebrew, which signifies Lord; and Z^ar, poison,
calling it the Lord of Poisons.

It conduces upon the same account to all venenate and contagious diseases; as
the Pestilences, Morbils, Smallpox, and the like: it cures also swoundings,
long sorrows, hysterical passions, and many other malign affections; of which
see N. Monard. Christoph. a Costa, and Clusius.

CHAP. 23. Of Margarites and Unions.
MArgarites are taken out of certain Shell-fishes, living in the Indian sea,
very like Oysters; which if they be small, they keep the name Margarites; if
greater, they are called Unions: for, they are found severally, in several
Shell-fishes: whence the Poet: Unde dictus ob hoc, quod ab uno nascitur unus,
Nec duo vel pluris unquam simul inveniantur.


Yet Aelianus contradicts this opinion; teaching from experience, that many
Unions are generated and found in one Shellfish, according to the abundance of
the fishes excrementitious matter, which is pure and lucid: they are not
therefore called Unions, because one only is found in one Shellfish, but
because two are never found conjoined in the same. Those that are white, round,
ponderous, and smooth, such as Queens wear about their necks, are best.

Many Shell-fishes generate Margarites; but the best are exotical, which are
found in the Persian Sea in the East: whence they are called Oriental Pearls;
and in the tracts of Chyna, and many parts of India, where the Incolists call
these Margaritiferous Shellfishes, Berbert; and some Barbarians, Cheripe;
others Chanquo; which is the Mother of Pearl.

This great Shellfish is spiss, moderately hollow like a comb, but not toothed
on both sides, but only on one; not striated without, but plain, and something
flave, smooth, splendent, and argenteous within: it is generated in its flesh,
as lumps in hogs flesh, stones in the bladder, or other places: for I saw a man
who avoided many stones by stool, each one whereof in magnitude equalized a
Chestnut or Acorn.

Fernelius found three stones in the Liver of the dissected carcass of a
Nobleman, who in his lifetime spitted up some like Marga^ites.

But to my purpose: these Shell-fishes exposed to the air, or assayed with a
knife, open, and the Margarites are found together with their flesh; which
indeed are neither bones, nor part of the piscicle, but something
excrementitious, splendent, and concrete, like the shells wherewith they are
tected, which are outwardly scabre and impolite, but within smooth and fair: so
that the true Mother of Pearls, is never naturally, but always artificially
polished.

Those Margarites are greater, which are taken from the greater Conchae, and in
the deeper sea.

They are so much sought after by women, that no one, though of mean fortune,
thinks she is sufficiently adorned, till she carry Pearls about her neck.

But their use is chiefly Medicinal; for all, both Ancients and latter writers,
aver, That Margarites are very cordial, and exhilarate the heart: Alchymists
dissolve them, and get thence liquor of Pearls, whereof they predicate many,
but ridiculous things.

I knew a very crafty Empyrical Surgeon in Paris, who required six Pieces
for the adhibition of two Swallows to his Patient; Vires.
and when all admired he should ask so unreasonably, I should (says he) have
demanded much more, because I fed these Animals a whole Month with the liquor
of Pearls.

You may read at large of Margarites, and the Fishes wherein they are
generated, their nature, dignity, duration, and virtues, in Rondeletius, Lib.
1. de testaceis. Cap. 51.

CHAP. 24. De Umbilicis Marinis: Of the Sea-Navel.
THe Sea-Navel is either a whole piscicle, whereof Rondeletius makes mention,
or a part, bone or regument of some greater fish: the former is a turbinated
and small Shellfish, so like a Navel, that none that see it can choose but so
name it.

The other Umbilike is all osseous, which is either a shell, or the bone of
another fish; for many fishes have certain bones given them by Nature, either
for the insertion of their fins, whereby they defend their lives, or for the
confirmation and motion of their bodies. Thus Sepia is founded upon its bone;
thus the Slaits back is armed with many pricks, which by light cocture may be
easily sojoyned from its body: whose officles if you take away, their prickles
do well represent the Sea-Navel.

We therefore suspect, with Berv. Dessennius, that Sea-Umbilikes are desumed
from Sea-Animals, and cast on the shore with other stones; and yet they are not
of the same kind with stones. Some call them Sea-Gems; but their faculties are
not so eximious, as that they should be reposed among Gems. Their form is well
known, their color is in some white, in some red: they are frequently sold in
France.

CHAP. 25. Of the Dental.
THe Dental is a certain small Shellfish, oblong, white, sharp without, very
smooth within, hollow like a little tube, and acuminated on one side, like a
Dogs tooth: whence it is called a Dental; for it is a shell like a tooth,
wherein a vernicle is procreated; which is oblong, and slender, answerable to
the cavity of the shell, which goes out of its domicil, sometimes to draw
water, and seek victuals. Both it and its tube, grow as a restaceous Cane upon
a Rock, or an old shell: It is endued with the same virtue with the Seas
Umbilike, and other testaceous piscicles, and may as well ingrede the
composition of the Citrian Unguent, as the former.

CHAP. 26. Of the Antal.
THere is another Sea Shellfish, called an Antal, whose use in Medicine is
very frequent, if we make the Citrian unguent.

It is a testaceous tube bred in the Sea, of a little fingers length, striated
without, smooth and hollow within; out of whose cavity a small piscicle is
educed.

This seems to be the fish which Athenaeus calls Solen; for that is of the
kind of long Shell-fishes, with a double shell, smooth, slender, and hollow
like a reed, and open at both ends. Pliny calls it a Dactyl, or a Digit,
because it equalizes a finger in longitude; or as some say, resembles a man's
nail. However, the Antal we use is very well known and vulgar; neither should
we lose any precious Medicament, if it were absent; for we can substitute in
its stead any shell that is white and striated, which strangers bring from the
Sea, near that famous Mount which is sacred to St. Michael: for all of them are
of an equal virtue, as to the confecture of the said ung^ent; whereunto also
another accedes, not easily known by name; some call it Amentum; others
Amiantus; for it is yet doubted, whether Amentum be that stone Amiantus, which
is of a whitish green, and by many called Scissile-Alome; from which it differs
much.

For Scissile-Alome is manifestly astrictive; and being injected upon coals,
burns; but plumeous Alome is acrimonious, safe from flame, and well termed
Amiantus, or Amentum, or Amiantum, which the Citrian Unguent admits of: but I
dare not assert this for certain, seeing Amentum is a barbarous word well
understood by none, as it appears by the opinions of such Authors as have
written of it: for Theophrastus will have it the name of a tree; Matthaeus
Sylvaticus, burnt glass; Manlius burnt lime; some Suet, or the fat of glass;
others, Talkum, or the specular glass, which is indeed very convenient for this
Unguent; as also plumbeous Alome, which Apothecaries by good reason use for
Amentum, or Amiantus.

There is also much mention in shops, of Bizantian Blatta, which is a cover
very like that wherewith the Purple-fish is tected; yet this similitude is
only as to their substance and faculties, and not as to their forms: for the
tegument of the Purple-worm is round, according to Rondeletius; and this Blatta
long and strict, found in nardiferous lakes, and thence suaveolent; for these
worms eat Spikenard, and this Blatta is called the odorate Nayl, for it smells
somewhat like a Beaver. But I will not longer insist upon its description,
because it ingredes no Medicament in our Shop.

CHAP. 27. Of Tortoises.
TOrtoises are either aquatical, living in the Sea, or sweet-watel; or
amphibious, living partly on the land, and partly on the water: whence Pliny
comprehending them all in a quaternal number, calls them either Marine, or
Fluvial, Terrestrial, or Palustrian.

A Tortoise is a candated Animal, with four feet, squamous, ungrateful to the
sight, whose shell is of an oval form, long, broad, hollow within, and without
extuberant like a Buckler, under which it sometimes hides its head, tail, feet,
and all; and sometimes it puts them out even at pleasure.

This alone of squamous Animals, according to Aristotle, has Reins, and a
Bladder: it lays Eggs with hard shells of two colors, which it reconds in a
Ditch, excavated like a hogshead, and covers them with the earth; which it
makes even, and so sits upon it, till its young ones be excluded.

Solinus says, That in the Indian Sea there are Tortoises of so great a
magnitude, that their shells, open at the bottom, and joined at the top, make
so large houses for the vulgar Indians, that a numerous family may dwell
therein. Yea, some use them in stead of Boats, wherein they sail from one Isle
to another in the Red Sea.

With the Troglodites they are cornigerous, but less then the Indian.

Tortoises are of much use, Vires.
both in Cibaries and Medicine; for their decoction helps such as are consumed
and attenuated: and therefore they usefully ingrede the confecture of the
resumptive Syrup. Many delight in their flesh, but it is such a deformed
Animal, in head, tail, feet, form, color, and spots, resembling the Serpentine
kind, that nature seems to note it as offensive and unwholesome: which they
also confess who love it; but that its dressing and condiments make it less
noxious, for else it were horrid.

CHAP. 28. Of Frogs.
MYropolists use whole Frogs, in the composition of Vigonius his salve, which
the Author described for the cure of a disease proper to his own Nation.
Sylvius also says, Their decoction will ease the Toothache, if the mouth be
washed therewith: their ashes, with Pitch, according to Dioscorides, or rather
with Honey, according to Pliny, will bring again fallen hairs. The Emplaisters
wherewith they are mixed, are thence siccative, and discussive, especially in
the dolours of the junctures: They are Antidotal against Serpentine poisons,
according to Dioscorides, if they be decocted, eaten with Salt and Oil, and
their broth supped.

But all Frogs are not edible; whereof there are many varieties: for some
delight solely in water, and live there ordinarily; others on the dry soil:
others also are amphibious, living equally on the water and earth.

Some of the watery Frogs live in Fenny and muddy places, and are pernicious,
acceding near the nature of Toads; others live in limpid and fountain water,
and are wholesome, and reposed among Cibaries.

Some of those that feed on dry soyls, live amongst reeds, others amongst
briars and thorns: the former, which are least of all, are called Calamitae,
and the latter Rubetae, by the Latins; by the Greeks, Phrynoi; which are as
pernicious as the Palustrian Frogs: those they call Dryophites, which climb up
Oaks, and live in or about them; and the Diopetes, which fall with storms and
warm showers out of the air, are no better then the rest.

All of them are mute in winter, except the watery Frogs; which at the end of
Winter, and beginning of the Spring, begin to croak, to wit, when Tadpoles are
procreated in putrid waters, which some falsely call Frogs-sperm, or
Frogs-egges. Arist.

Hence many have derided the Medicament of a certain Alchymist, who prescribes
the water of Frogs-sperm, to the Pimples and swellings of the face, eyes, and
the whole body; whereas he might hunt, exenterate, dissect, exhaust, and search
the seminals of all the Frogs in France, and never get so much sperm as would
wet the bottom of his Metal-pan.

Experience also shows, and learned Rondeletius has averred, That Tadpoles
come of Mud, and turn not into Frogs. All Frogs, besides the watery ones, are
pernicious and malign; as also, those of them also that are maculated with
black spots, like Toads, of whose nature they participate: and those that use
them for meat, are infected with a plumbeous color. Wherefore they should not
be taken save for Physic, for they putrify the body.

Yet some put Palustrian Frogs, others Rubetae, to the confection of Jo. de
Vigo his salve: but I think amphibious Frogs are better.

For the Rubetae, which live among briars, thorns, and dry soyls, being
venenate and acrimonious, impart a certain quality to the Medicament, whereby
it vellicates the skin, and raises lumps; and the water are not so efficacious:
therefore those that live partly in water, and partly on the land, must be
elected as best.

CHAP. 29. Of Crab-fishes.
THere are innumerable varieties of shelled fishes; some whereof have long
bodies, as Locusts and Lobsters; others round, as all the troop of Sea-Crabs,
and fresh water Crabs: whereof there are fewer varieties.

As some of Sea-Crabs are greater, as those we call Maeae, and Paguri; and
others lesser, which we call Pinnophylaces: so some of the fresh water
Crab-fishes are great, broad-footed, like the Sea-Crabs, but greater; others
little ones, which we use in Meats and Medicaments, as by Avicenna's counsel,
to refresh such as labor in the Hectic Fever, and such as are bitten by mad
Dogs; as also to ingrede some mundificative Unguents.

Rondeletius has largely described the whole kind of Crabs ( Lib. 18. de
Piscibus, and Lib. particulari de fluviatilibus) as also Matthiolus upon
Dioscorides.

For it is enough for us to mention these, and to treat more copiously of such
things as do but sometimes accede to Medicine.

CHAP. 30. Of Vipers.
VIpers flesh siccates, Vires.
and digests potently, and califies moderately: its faculty hastens it to the
skin, propelling the excrements and poison of the body, if any, thither: whence
we make it into Theriacal Trochisks, as we have showed in our Antidotary; and
of them we make that famous Theriacal confection, so much commended against
venenated affections. Now those are called Theriacal Medicaments, which cure
the poisonous bitings of venenate Animals, or heal such as have received harm
by the biting, breathing, licking, or touching of venenate Animals.

They are also called Alexipharmacal Medicaments, which arceate peril by
poison: but others will have them only so called which by introsumption at the
mouth cure poisons.

Now Theriacal comes (...), that is, from wild and venenate Animals, rather
then from some certain sort of Serpents; though a Viper, whose Male is called
(...), and Female (...), be sometimes by the Greeks called (...): for it being
the most notorious of Serpents and wild Beasts, it vendicates this name,
(...): and the Medicament which admits of its flesh, is nevertheless
denominated Theriacal, from its efficacy in curing the bites and poisons of
wild beasts, and not because of that ingredient.

A Viper is ordinarily of a cubits length, and often longer; of a subflave
color, maculated with many round spots: the male is by the Greeks called
Echis; its head is angust and acute; its neck crasser, and body slenderer then
the Female; its tail, like that of other Serpents, grows more gracile by
degrees, and not on a sudden, as that of the Female: it has sharper scales at
the end of its tail; which when moved, it erects, just as an angry Cock does
his Plumes in fighting.

He has two Canine teeth; the Female more, according to that of the Poet: Huic
gemini apparent dentes in carne, venenum
Fundentes, verubus sed Foemina pluribus atrox.


He also has a passage in his tail, nearer his belly then that of the Females:
he goes also more stoutly.

The Female Vipers are of a yellowish color, with an elated neck, reddish
eyes, and lucent; of an inverecund and fierce aspect; their heads are broad,
their tails short, macilent, squamous, and all a like gracile, not gradually
so; their passages nearer their tails; their bellies more prominent, and their
pace flower.

The Latins call it Vipera, because Vi parit, that is, it is forced to bring
forth; or else because Vivum parit, that is, it brings forth living young,
contrary to the mode of other Serpents, which first lay eggs: and the Viper
indeed procreates eggs, like them of fishes; but every egg has a young living
Viper involved only in a membrane.

Yet it sometimes happens, that the last seeking egress before the first, and
impatient of longer delay, erodes his Parents belly and sides, and so it is
produced a Matricide: but that as seldom happens, as, when the Male thrusts his
head into the Females mouth in copulation, the Female, satiated with the
sweetness of the pleasure, obtruncabes the Male: which I think is never.

When other Serpents in winter run into caverns, Vipers only absoond
themselves under stones, and depose their old age, like other Reptiles.

Vipers are preferred before all other Serpents, in the confection of this
Theriack, because when compounded of others, its virtue is more tabifical. (
Gal: Cap. 10. Lib. de Theriaca.)

The Heads and tails, which contain the most virulent poison, must be
abscinded: for the Viper has the most pernicious head of all venenate beasts.
Dioscorides holds it ridiculous, that any set certain measure of the Head and
tail should be prescinded.

The internals, Spina Dorsi, and the belly, must likewise be abjected.

There are both in Italy and France, very idoneous Vipers for this solemn
confection, as in the Pictavian fields, whence many are brought to Paris; of
whose flesh we make Pastils, and use their fat in Vigo his emplaster; whose
extraction and preparation is easy: The fat must first be taken, with its
skins, and washed in clear cold water, till it be sincere; then may the
membranes be separated; then must the fat be melted in a double vessel, and
continually agitated with a wooden stick; when it is melted, it must be
percolated into cold water, which may be abjected, and the fat kept, and
reposed in a convenient vessel: some wash it again, that it may depose all its
poison.

I can scarce assent to their opinion, who believe, that such live long as eat
Vipers flesh; for it procreates very ill succe, and digests and siccates
vehemently: so that they who eat it are grievously cruciated with thirst, and
thence cognominated Dipsades. Galen says, that some are of opinion, that such
as are bitten by Vipers, cannot be cured by drinking, but will burst ere they
can quench their thirst.

Galen proves by many Histories, that Vipers conduce to the Leprous: There was
(says he) a Leper in Asia, who was foetid to look on, and graveolent; who at
first was conversant, and did eat with his companions, till some of his company
began to be inquinated, and he of such a horrid and detestable a form, as none
could endure to look on him; then they bound him in a Cottage near the river,
and gave him daily aliment. The next Summer, about the rising of the Dog Star,
when a servant brought fragrant wine to the reapers, and set the pot by the
riverside, when they came to drink, the Boy poured out the wine into a cup,
and with the wine a dead Viper; the reapers being therewithal afrighted,
quenched their thirst with water, and sent the wine to the Leper, pitying his
condition, and judging it better for him to die therewith, then to live in that
misery: but he, drinking thereof, was unexpectedly cured, his skin falling off
like a shell from a locust.

And another event, not much unlike this, happened in Mysia, not far from our
City: There was a rich man, but Leprous, who was in love with his maid that was
beautiful; but she hating so descormed a man, clandestinely kept other lovers
company: the diseased, in hopes of recovery, betook himself to some Fountains
of hot water, wherewith the vicine parts abounded, which were squalid and full
of Vipers; one whereof crept into his wine pot: the wench perceiving that a
Viper was there suffocated, was glad she had such an opportunity put into her
hands; she then gives a cup of it to her Master, who drinking of it, was
perfectly cured, as the precedent.

Galen recenseates more stories, whereby he proves, that Vipers cure the
Leprosy. We have showed in our Antidotary, how it must be prepared, before it
ingrede the confection of the Theriack.

CHAP. 31. Of Scinks.
THe flesh of the Reins of this Beast, is a special Antidote against poison,
very efficacious to excite lust in men; for it causes stiffness of the Yard:
whence it justly ingredes the confection of Diasatyrium.

It is a small four-footed Animal, tected with small, frequent, and subluteous
scales, with a long head, little thicker then its neck, a high belly, a round
tail like a Lizard, but shorter, and crooked toward the end, with a gray line
from its head, to the end of its tail.

Dioscorides says, It is the product either of Egypt, or India, or of the
Red Sea, though it is seen in Lydia of Mauritania: Some do erroneously take it
for the Salamander. Pliny calls it the Land-Crocodile, for it very much
resembles the Crocodile of Nilus.

But there is no proportion in their dimensions; for this is always small,
scarce exceeding a cubit in length: whereas the Crocodile of Nilus attains two
and twenty cubits, and yet no term of his concretion, though his original is
from an Egg no bigger then a Gooses Egg: He lives both upon the land and
water; his eyes are like Swines eyes: his sight in the water is dull; but out,
very quick.

This Animal alone, except the Parrer, moves his upper jaw; he has a small
rongue adhering to his under-jaw; his legs come out of his side; his feet are
small, in reference to his body; his claws strong; his skin squamous,
crustaceous, and impenetrable, save under his belly, which is soft. This Animal
lives sixty years, lays sixty Eggs in sixty days, sits upon its Eggs sixty
days, before young ones be excluded; it has sixty joints in its backbone; and
as many teeth in its head, as it will lie days in winter in some Cavern
without meat. The more curious Scrutator may have a fuller description of the
Crocodile, in Aristotle, Pliny, and later Writers, who have lustrated Egypt,
and the Oriental Coasts.

CHAP. 32. Of Scorpions.
THey make an Oil of dead Scorpions, infused in Oil, which they cognominate
from the same, for many uses in Medicine: for, by way of liniment, it breaks
and expels the stones in the Re^^s and Bladder, and moves Urine: it cures the
bitings of Vipers, Serpents, and other venenate Beasts: if it be adhibited to
the armholes and groins in time of Pestilence, it will either preserve the user
from it, or cure him of it: it will also cure a wound inflicted by a Scorpion;
and so will its own body, bruised and applied.

A Scorpion is a terrestrial Animal, with a long and nodous tail, whose end is
armed with a long and oblique sting, perviated with a small hole, through which
it effunds its poison into the part pricked: it has arms and fore-cleyes
bisulcated; its tail is always ready for a stroke; it never lets slip an
opportunity: it strikes obliquely.

The Masculine Scorpion is maculated on the belly, and forecleys; and its
poison is more pernicious, the Females more mild; though some write contrary.

There are eight kinds of Scorpions: the first is white, which they say is not
lethiferous; the second yellowish, whose stroke is seconded with vehement
ardour, and an inextinguishable thirst; the third is blackish, whose stroke
depraves the members of motion, and makes men mad, causing foolish laughter;
the fourth is somewhat green, it has seven knots in his tail; perpetual and
great cold, though in the heat of Summer, follows upon its stroke; the fifth is
pale and livid, and infects the percussed with tumors in his groins; the sixth
is like a little Sea Crab-fish; the seventh has greater Cleys, and is very
like the Crab we call Pagurus; the eighth is of a Honey-colour, it has wings
like a Locust, and the last knot of its tail is black.

Winged Scorpions are very rare with us, but frequent and great in India and
Aphrica, with seven knots in their tayls.

If we reckon the variety of Scorpions, by the variety of their colors, some
are called flave Scorpions, some yellow, some cineritious, some green, some
ferrugineous, some vinous, some white, and others fuliginous.

The smitings of Scorpions are far more perilous to women, then men; and
especially to Virgins: for they are always lethal to such, unless they be
presently helped: and such Scorpions as have seven knots in their tayls, are
judged most cruel.

They procreate and sit upon Vernicles like Eggs, Vires.
and they produce a progeny, which coming to perfection, drives them away; and
thus Scorpions are said to be killed by their young ones. But these things
respect not Pharmacy, and therefore not for my purpose.

CHAP. 33. Of Worms.
MAny small Animals are generated of Worms, and Worms of many great Animals:
yea, this progeny springs from all altered and putrid matter, stones, bones,
wood, fruit, cheese, flesh; and all things seem at first to turn into worms:
for man's own flesh is absumed by worms, and his clothes by moths: And though
cold things much resist putretude, yet worms are generated in the coldest snow;
and some are procreated of salt: they are also generated in Animals daily,
their body abounding with putrid humors; for there worms are generated, where
putretude resides: for, Corruption is their Mother. I saw a worm of a palms
length, come out with the blood of the vein of ones arm opened: They are still
generated in the intestines, and other parts of man's body, and also in Hearts
heads.

Every Insect generates a worm, except the Butterfly, which is procreated of
another dissimilar Insect: as the Poet; Et fio volucris, qui modo vermis eram.

The family of Worms being thus ample, I shall only speak of Earthworms,
which are used in Medicine: for these washed in white wind, prepared, macerated
in Oil, and duly elixated in a double vessel, afford us an Oil, very conducible
in nervous affections.

They are also assumed at the mouth, after due preparation, to wit, when they
are washed, dried, levigated, and mixed with other Powders, to cure Virgins
pale colors.

Many call them the Earths Intestines; others, Earthworms; others,
Earth-lumbricks: they have a long round body, with neither bone, eye, nor ear:
They go so, that the precedent part draws the consequent in their locomotion.

They are procreated of the mud of the earth, and animated by the same cause
that other Insects are. They are destitute of eyes, ears, feet, members, and
are like oblong fibers, whose parts are not discriminated, save by some knots
and denervations a little beyond their middles.

Spring or Winter-showers, if not glacial, elicite them: they are neither
liberally, nor copiously generated in the earth, much trodden upon, but
frequently in fat and waste ground: Vires.
These bruised and applied, conglutinate prescinded Nerves, and fresh wounds.

CHAP. 34. Of Spanish-Flies, or Beetles.
THese Flies have only a nominal affinity with Beetles, for they are often
used in Medicine, Beetles never. Galen has experienced them good against scabs
and Leprosies; and Physicians find them to provoke Urine.

Aristotle calls them Putrid Animals, because they are produced ^f putrid
matter: They are procreated, nourished, and found in ^any shrubs, as the
Bramble; and in many tall trees, as the Ash: shose that are found in Corn, are
versicolorate, and have trans^erse lines in their wings, with an oblong body,
and are very good.

But they will be more fit for use, if they be injected into an earthen vessel,
whose orifice is covered with a rare linen cloth, and turned downwards, that by
the halite of sharp vinegar, they may be exanimated, then dried, reposed in
wooden boxes, glass or earthen vessels, and kept for the space of two years.

They are mixed but in small quantity, to Medicaments that provoke Urine, by
Galens advise, who would have them injected whole; but the later Writers would
have their legs and wings abscinded and abjected. When a Noble Matron of Paris
was holden with a continual Fever, accompanied with the heat of the Reins, and
other grievous symptoms, and had committed the care of her cure to Mr. Martin,
a learned and perite Parisian Medick; by the persuasion of some, she called one
Rivierius, a courtly Medick, who feeling her pulse, said, If she had called him
a little sooner, he would have applied a dragm of French flies to the region
most affected, and have presently restored her to sanity: so he left the Matron
grieved, and her ordinary Medick astonished at his humor, manners, words, and
actions; who was so far from adhibiting such a company of these flies, that he
applied not one, and yet restored her to health: for this fly being most dry
and light, it is credible, one weighing not above a grain; what were it less
then carnifice to adhibite sixty of them, which weigh but a dragm, to the
aesture of the Reins? But take this obiter, not because I am incensed against
the man, but that I might show, that these flies are very noxious to the
Bladder, Reins, and other parts, by inducing inflammations; yet very good mixed
with other Medicaments in a small quantity.

CHAP. 35. Of Ants.
PHarmacopolies are not destitute of Ants, which afford an oil commended to
many received uses: for it califies the generative parts, being too frigid, and
reduces them to a better state.

Ants are the most laborious and officious of insects, which exercise their
labors not only on the day, but on the night also, in full Moon; always
treading the same paths, bringing cibaries to their Cells, and reconding them
for the ensuing year. They hunt not after smaller animalls, like Cobs, but
degust them when dead; congest grains, and bear their burdens in their mouths.

Ants are either winged, whose infusion yields the said oil; or wingless,
which are frequently found in dry and incultivated places: sick Bears seek
sanity from them,

There is, in some regions in India where Gold is effoded, a kind of Ants,
equalizing Foxes in magnitude: I find also some equitant ones, and others that
fly the light; but the Apothecary never uses such.

CHAP. 36. Of the Silkworm.
THat glory is now given to Silk, which was given to fine linen, wherewith the
Ancient Kings were invested: and as we read in Luke 10. A certain rich man
arrayed. This flax was a kind of tenuious line, next in dignity to Asbestinum,
whereof most subtle vestments were made, with which women were most delighted;
which, according to Pliny, grew near Elis in Achaia; according to Pollux, in
India, and Egypt; and Pausanias, in Greece, on a tree not unlike our Poplar,
with willowish leaves: but whether its plant be a tree or an herb, it is
altogether unknown to us. It bears not only leaves, but line also, which the
People of Seres, Scytia, and Asiatica, perite in spining, draw out into small
threads, and make it into vestments for rich men; and that which the Serians
work, is called Silk. Asbestus is either a certain stone of a ferreous color,
in the Mountains of Arcadia, which being once accended, can never be
extinguished; or else flax, whereof Napkins are made, that will take flame, and
not burn away; like plumbeous Lead.

But we have no such by ssigerous plant, nor vestments made of their Down; but
only Bombycina, which, as Byssina of old, is now called Silk; which is as good
for dignity in the same uses, and besides accommodated to Medicinal
exhibitions: for Apothecaries, following the Arabians dictate, have an opinion
of Silk, Vires.
that it will purge blood, roborate the vital faculties, recreate the heart,
illustrate the spirits, refresh all faculties, and help all the spirits. These
are the eximious Encomia, wherewith the Barbarians nobilitate the excrement of
their virulent Insect. But seeing any one may Philosophize, and propose his
opinion in the matter in hand, I profess, I think Silk is of small use in
Medicine: for it is the dry, inodorate, exuicous recrement of an imperfect
Animal, affine to Cob-webs, but inept and ineffectual in man's cure.

It may be, that that Byssinum, which the latter writers call fine flax, is
endued with eximious faculties; but no such being now fonnd, nor brought to us,
our Pharmacopolists cannot speak of it, unless they speak in their dreams. And
I wonder, upon what reason they give crude Silk to the sick: when it is tincted
with Scarlet, it is indeed virtuous, but it borrows that faculty from its
infection; and therefore I had rather prescribe the dying grains alone, then
frustraneously spend their succe in dying Silk. But let perite Medicks, who
have only reason for their Law, be Judges in the case.

These Silkworms are little Animals, excluded from small, round, and blackish
seeds, called by some eggs, cherished with a moderate calour; animated, and at
first formed into Minute-worms, which educated on the leaves and boughs of the
Mulberry-tree, after a while spin their slender webs, or Silken threads,
whereof precious cloth is abundantly woven.

When they are more adult, they make of themselves hoods and domicils for
themselves; and there in a short time, they transmute themselves into white
Butterflies, which produce seeds, or small eggs, whereof other worms of the
same kind are generated. But these being known to Women and Children, need no
further description.

Some Medicks use the Galls of many Animals; the Liver and intestines of
Wolves, the brains of Sparrows, the testicles of Cocks, and Asells which are
found under water-vessels: but these not ingreding the compositions in our
Shop, belong not to us. Thus I have in three Books, by Gods auxiliation,
briefly and clearly composed all Medicinal matter: to whom be Honor, Glory and
Praise now and Ever.

ENGLISHED By RICHARD TOMLINSON, APOTHECARY.

LONDON: Printed by J. Streater, and J. Cottrel. 1657.

To his Honored, Learned, and Virtuous FRIEND, WILLIAM WITHEINGS Esquire
Worthy Sir,
THe manifold Testimonies of your real favors, calls for a perpetual
Commemoration; and what requital can be returned, but a bare demonstration,
where ability cannot correspond, or aspire to the dignity of that Desert,
couched within the verge of that manifestation of affection so amply
discovered? And to lie dormant under so much Courtesy, were to invelop my self
within the Rounds of Ingratitude, and in stead of Coronating your deserved
Worth (already bedubbed with the true Sparklings of never-fading Glory) I
should Adumbrate the Luster thereof, (which otherwise would necessarily dispel
the thickest clouds) by the Satirical Screen of Fame-defacing-Oblivion.

To enumerate the many discoveries and dawnings of your Virtues, were to
comprehend a Catalogue of the Universal Genus of Atoms, within the narrow
bounds of a Nutshel: Neither can the weak blandishments of a Quill, emblazon
the least shadow of those Trophies, whose Glory is founded in the true Abyss of
your merited Renown.

Pardon this boldness, SIR, in presuming to lodge this Book within your Gates;
and in making use of your Name without your consent. Let not a sinister
construction, obstruct a gentle remission; nor a rigid apprehension, hinder the
thought of a venial transgression. Doubtless, SIR, the Subject will not
dishonor your Person, in Patronizing it from suffering shipwreck in the
tumultuous gulfs of Contradiction and Detraction; but rather conclude, That the
rays of your Learning being (...) the Imperfections necessarily accruing in
the Alteration of the Garb, will put a period to what may be objected by those,
whose Medulla Scientiae, is nothing else, but the true pourtraicture of that
Livid Viper Envy; whose virulency is Malevolent Censure. Let such endeavor its
Overture, whilst your finger supports it by the Chin, till it arrives with the
fresh gales of your Countenance, to its desired Haven, with its Top-gallant
streaming out the true Characters of your Honor, maugre the carpings of
Zoilus. What need it to fear the trivial Objections of certain Augurs, when its
Patron is both strongly fenced with the Principles of Theory, and garnished
with the Robes of Integrity?

SIR, you are not one whom infant Effeminacy, youthful Delicacy, or voluptuous
Liberty, could ever yet allure your intellect and knowledge from diving into
Divine and Moral Arcana's. Altius surgentes, Innocents licet, comitatur
suspicio. Tacit.
What greater Symbol of true Gentility, then Goodness! It is not the gaudy
luster of the Purple, but the inward virtue of the Person, that proclaims
Greatness; having always observed you to entrain Humility and Integrity for
your Retainers.

Yet if any dare to calumniate Renodaeus, notwithstanding his Accomplishment at
all assays, and his converse with the most acute Judgment, he will proclaim
them viva voce, to be Vox and praeterea nihil.

This only remains, That if I have drawn him in his proper Colors, he will
merit your Patronage; but if mangled, it is in your power, Sir, rather to
impute the fault to the Pen, then the intention of the person, whose Ambition
was ever to be accounted,

SIR, Your most humble Servant, Rich. Tomlinson.

THE PREFACE TO THE READER.
ALL things in general, which the whole Mass of the Earth does expose to sight
and view, or include within her bowels, the greatest portion thereof does
either serve man for Medicament or Aliment; which indeed ought not at all times
to be gathered, whilst the necessity of man calls for them; or the bowels of
the Earth robbed thereof in vain, till the Physician appoint them for the
Relief of Man's body, which is the subject for the which they were created:
Except it be such Exoticks, which upon all occasions in Pharmacopolies ought to
be kept, both for present and future use. Concerning which, Pliny, cap. 1. lib.
28. Hippoc. Epist. ad Abdent. Herophil. has treated of at large.

For whereas Medicine is the gift of God, and Medicament the hand of God, it
must needs follow then, that an Apothecary, of all Professions, must needs be
the most excellent, though not always (it may be) in the greatness of estate,
yet in the Bays of Honor. What is his Shop, but a Magazine of the Globes
Treasure, a Storehouse of Natures Arcana's? whatsoever is comprehended under
the Cope of Heaven, there in the Mass is contained. What can the main Sea
produce, or the depth of the great Abyss? What can the four Elements discover,
that is not of use in our Shops? Alas, is not the Body of Man the receptacle of
innumerable Diseases? else, whither tend these Myriads of Remedies? What
Disease can be found in rerum natura, that has not either an Antidote to
defend, or a Corrosive to destroy? What can now be objected, or produced as an
Aenigma to the Physician? Are not those great Giants, which were veiled in
obscurity to the Ancients, now laid level? Who is there that professes himself
the Son of Aesculapius, that knows not now how to encounter a Solutio Continui,
Phlegmon, Pterygium, Polypus, Hepatitis, Lienteria, Enterocle, Aedema,
Schyrrhus, Podagra, with many others, which formerly puzzled so many Grandees in
knowledge? What place now, wherein there is not a Sanctuary for Remedy to fly
unto, where a salubrious Medicine for every Malady is publicly to be had? What
a gallant spectacle is it, to behold an Apothecaries thecaries Shop well stored
of all things necessary, Instruments for the preparing of Medicines, and
Vessels to repose the same in, etc.

But alas! how is this Art now abused! what a company of illiterate Ignoran^^
(...) whose knowledge is exercised in nothing else, but in setting men's lives
at sale; who out of secular ends, to (...) by felling cheap, have, and do to
this day, (and I am sorry that I have no other Tense to speak in) huddle up a
Medicine after any manner, taking one thing for another; insomuch that the
Medicament neither can effect what might be expected otherwise from it, nor
does it the Patient any good, but rather operate contrary to the Physicians
expectations? These are the Vipers that poison and infect a Commonwe (...) the
disgrace of the Profession, and the ruin of Mankind. I dare a^ou^^, and shall
maintain, that more are killed by the ill-compounded, succidaneous Medicaments
of many Apothecaries here in this City, then by the malignity of any distemper
whatsoever. And hence it is, that the Physician comes to be undervalued ^our
Profession despised and the whole Commonwealth abused; and if a speedy Remedy
be not taken for these abominable Practices, what will follow? Are these men
fit for the society of Christians? or are they to be allowed, to act in a
business of such concernment, where a man's Life runs the hazard of Ruin? It is
the shame of London, (...) amongst so many learned and able Artists, those
Piperly-Dizzards should not be found out and detected.

But we shall detain the Reader no longer in the Porch, but open the Shopdoors,
for every one to enter in; where Knowledge shall be sold at a cheap rate: Only
take notice, That there is intended for the Press, a Treatise discovering the
true and infallible Marks of every Medicine, whereby it may be quickly
discerned, whether it be rightly compounded or no: Together with the lowest
Price thereof. With many other things, which, God willing, shall be made
public, for the information of the Ignorant.

Farewell.
CHAP. 1. Of the House and Shop of an Apothecary.
AT the beginning and nonage of the world, Men used fruits for bread, and
water for wine; and it is probable, both Horses and Beasts had the same
aliment, (Hip. lib. de vet. Med.) but when the fruits which grew spontaneously,
would not suffice for their nutrition and sanity, our forefathers made a
bread, or rather a pultess, of Wheat macerated, shelled, and bruised; whereupon
the Romans lived a long time, after Ausonius. But their stomachs nauseating to
be always served with the same meat, and they not content with bread alone,
begun at length to taste of Birds, and then to hunt after beasts and fishes.
Their desires thus breaking out by little and little, invented culture, and a
Thousand gulous provocations: whereas Ausonius says, that before that time,
the Acorn was man's and beasts common meat, and a trees shade their common house.

For in that first age, caves were their houses, the tectures of wood their
cottages, rocks and saxous places their Cities: and a long time after, the
Dardanians made them sordid houses in mud, the Balearians in hollowed rocks; as
many Indians at this day in Oysters and Tortoises shells; and others weave
themselves houses of reeds and fenny herbs, ( Alex. ab Alex. C. 24. Li. 5.)

But as men's manners are now more polite, their dishes more dainty; so are
their houses more artificially structed: some building themselves edifices in
the middle of (...); others on the top of a hill; others at the Sea side; as
each man's fancy leads him.

But an Apothecaries house, should be built in none of these places; but rather
in a City, then in a Town; in an apprique and lucid place, rather then in an
opaque and umbrous; and in a nited street, rather then in one inquinated with
filth and putretude.

It must be ample, and high, that such simples as should be kept dry, may be
reposed in its highest room; and such as should be moist, in its cellar.

There should be many, at least one cubicle betwixt these two, to which the
Apothecary may betake himself; under which he must have an ample, quadrate, and
lucid Shop: yet neither so much exposed to the Sun, as it may califie, melt, or
too much dry his Medicaments; nor so much to the wind, as to molest them.

In it there should be two doors; the one an outward door toward the street,
the other postical or inward, into his kitchen, or inner chamber; wherein he
may not only eat his victuals, but prudently observe through some
lattice-window, what is done in the Shop, what given, and what received; and so
mind his Apprentices, whether they spend their time idly, faithfully and
accurately execute their office, or do all for his good, and effect his work.

In the other angle of the kitchen, near the Chimney, must be an Aestuary or
Hypocauste, wherein he may repose his Sugar-junkets and solid confections more
safely: and if the place be large enough, there may in the next place be made a
Tabern, wherein he may recond many seeds, fruits, and other simples, which he
buys in great quantity; as Prunes, Almonds, Honey, Seeds, Roots, and much of
Woods.

In his Shop he must repose only compounds, and such simples as are either
rare and precious, or are of diuturnal and frequent use; as Tamarinds, Raisins,
Liquorice, Polypody, Senny, etc.

And that his Medicaments may be duly disposed in his Pharmacopoly, many
shelves must be classically collocated therein, from the bottom upwards, upon
wooden and iron nails fastened in the walls, and the partition betwixt the
kitchen and the Shop, so that some of their rows may include lesser, some
greater boxes; some, Earthenpots; some, Glasses; some, Tinne-vessels; and some,
Woodvessels: so diligently and discreetly collocated, that those that are of
more frequent use, may not be in the same row with those that are more rarely
exhibited; but that the one sort may be nearer at hand, and the other remote.

The names also of the Medicaments, must be inscribed upon every vessel, and
bag, wherein they are included; that the Medicament to be exhibited, may soon
be seen, and not mistaken for another.

CHAP. 2. Of Instr^^ents necessary for the Shop.
THe Shops supellectuals, all which are either useful, or necessary, are almost
innumerable: Those are useful, but more profitable, which are more expetible
for their ornament, and greater splendor, then their inservience; as many
Silver vessels, which take much with the vulgar; and the Apothecaries may by
this external show, acquire that glory, which by their learning and skill they
cannot reach; and they are blamed by Hippocrates, who think this curious stuff
either odious or illiberal.

That same supellex is necessary, which serves either to repose Medicaments in,
as many: Earthen, Glassy, Argenteous, Stanneous, Plumbeous, Cupreous, and
Brasen-vessels; for Syrupes, Sapes, Eclegms, Electuaries, Powders, Oils,
Salves, and Unguents: of which hereafter: or to prepare them; as, Marbles,
Morters, Pestels, of Wood, Stone, and Metals; Rudicles, Pots, Kettles, Basins,
Dishes, Pottengers, Frying-pans, Frixories, Polishers, Files, Sieves, Stainers,
Presses, Gauntlers, Weights, Tongs, Knives, Marble rables, manifold Alembicks,
Refrigerative Channels, called Scrpentine Lakes, in Fundibles, and many more,
which it may be the Apothecary will not use once in a year.

Chemists have yet besides these, some peculiar supellectils, which a witty
fellow calls, The Instruments of Fallacy, and not of Pharmacy: but this I would
speak of their abuse, and not of their use.

The appellation and form of many Pharmaceutrical instruments, are sooner known
then their special uses; for every one knows Saws, Files, Hammers and Knives;
but the Apothecaries use for these, is to scrape Boars-teeth, Ivory, Guaiacum;
to attenuate them into dust, and levigate all such things, as cannot by
attrition be pulverated: but other artificers use them in the works of their
Arts; as the Goldsmith, in making Rings, Bracelets, and vessels of Gold or
Silver; the Blacksmith in making Nails; and all use Hammers, Anvils, and Tongs,
to their peculiar works.

The Knives necessary for Pharmacopolies, must not be of one sort only, but
some greater then others, some oblong, others short, and others otherwise
formed. The long and mucronated Knives, are much in use to scrape and purge
roots; to divide and cleave the minute-boughs of wood, and caulicles of herbs:
the shorter, which are not acuminated, but obtuse, whose backs are very crass,
serve to cut Sugar into lumps; some whereof are very short, but broad, of a
Lunar shape, like those wherewith Shoemakers cut their hides; wherewith some
oleaginous seeds, and condited barks, which cannot be pulverated by a Pestel,
may be cut small.

They serve also to divide Liquorice into small pieces, that it may ingrede the
confection of common junkets.

There is also another Knife longer then the rest, whose point is reflected
like a hook, which fastened upon another hook set in the table, will with much
ease divide Wood (...) Roots, while its haft is pressed.

Yet all these varieties of Knives are not absolutely necessary in each Shop;
for the same Knife which in the Kitchen cuts bread, may in the Shop divide Wax,
and scrape Roots.

CHAP. 3. Of Morters and Pestels.
NO one Instrument is either so necessary, or so frequently used in a
Pharmacopoly, as a Mortar: for nothing almost can either be made up, or brought
to that pass, without the help of the Mortar. For seeing all Medicinal
materials are ordinarily rude, and indig^sted, and nothing almost exhibited, as
it comes out of the bosom of our Grandmother Nature; most things must by
triture be divided, agitated, levigated, and subacted into composition, in a
Mortar.

And seeing that matter is multifarious, and requires various preparations, not
only from the industry of the Apothecary, but the adjument of the Instruments;
wherein it acquires not only a convenient form, and a due magnitude, but a fit
matter, from which the Medicament may mutuate something: and therefore Piles or
Morters are made of various Materials; as of Marble, Achates, Alabaster, or
other stone; and of Tin, Lead, Iron, Brass, Copper; as also of Glass, and
Ivory; and of Silver and Gold, more for ostentation, then pure necessity.

One of Lead, or Glass, or Stone, is enough; but many of Brass, one whereof
must be very ample, for such things as are hard or large; another small, for
Musk, Amber, Civet, Bezaar-stone, and such Aromaticks.

Betwixt both, many of several magnitudes; some whereof may serve for Potions,
others for Glysters or Electuaries.

They must have as many Pestels as Morters, made also of the like matter; for a
plumbeous Pestel best fits a plumbeous Mortar; a brazen one, a brazen Mortar;
but an Iron Pestel fits all Metals, and a wooden Pestel all stony Morters, and
all such as new herbs are brayed in. When dry things must be pulverated, the
Mortar must be covered with Paper or Leather, lest the small Powder fly out and
perish, or trouble the brayers nose and eyes.

Marble tables and Purple stones are also requisite for the smaller levigation
of some things; as Margarites and Precious stones, which may be levigated very
small, with a little Rose Water, or other liquor, for the Medicks scope.

CHAP. 4. Of Spatula^s and Spoone.
SPatulaes and (...) as it were the Apothecaries second hands, wherewith he
agitates Medicaments, while they are tunded in Morters, or cocted in Dishes,
that the pulveration and coction of each part may be equal; and with these he
records the Medicaments in idoneous vessels, and with these takes them out for
uses. Now Spatulaes are broad at one end, like the blade of a bone, which the
Barbarians call Spatulae.

The figure of these Spatulaes is all one, to wit, triangular and oblong, but
their matter diverse; for some are made of Silver, as those little ones which
Chirurgeous use; others of Wood, as th^^ rudicle, wherewith they agitate the
palmeous Emplaister while it is cocting, which is made of a Palm-bough; others
of Iron, as almost all the rest, whether great or small, wherewith Apothe^^ries
work their soft Medicaments, as Honey, Winter-oyl, liquid Electuaries, and the
like confections.

The Shon spoons are made of Iron and Copper; the Table sp^ons of Silver, and
of Wood for the Rustic and poorer people; (...) make little ones of Ivory and
Horn, which serve for measuring (...) and put^ing them into the scales. Many
also of these materials are used in Kitchins, to despumate decoctions: Wood and
Silver Spoons are also used in Shops, but not Glass ones, because they are so
easily frangible; nor Iron ones, because they contract rust, as Brazen ones
also: but they may use any of them, so the servants have a care to keep them
clean, and absterge them as soon as they are inquinated.

CHAP. 5. Of their Caldrons, and other Metalline Vessels.
MAny take Ahenum and Cacabum for the same; but in proper locution, Ahenum is a
brazen vessel, profund and operculated, with a handle on the one side, whereby
it may be holden in ones hand, and shut at ones pleasure: it serves especially
for elixating of water in, which must either be drunk alone, or mixed with some
Wine.

Rich men for sanity, or rather vanities sake, have such vessels of Silver,
that the cocted water may not smell of Copper.

A Dish is another brazen vessel, much broader and larger, wherein Simples are
cocted, Compounds made, and Fruits condited: it has two ears or handles, on
each side one, that it may be set on, or taken off the fire more easily: it is
set on the fire upon a threefooted Iron Instrument, with hot coals under it,
that the liquor therein contained may boil.

A Pottenger is another aeneous, small, but patulous vessel; whereunto a long
start, and a ferreous handle is suffixed, that it may be more commodiously set
on the fire, and holden in either hand.

Such Medicaments as are given in small quantity, are cocted herein; as one
dosis of a Medicament, a small Electuary, a Rosaceous Julip, and the like.

A Drying Pan is another kind of dish, very patulous, with a long start, which
they use in Kitchins to fry flesh, in shops to fry seeds in; as Coriander with
Vinegar, to castigate some quality in it, Millet-seed with Wine, or some other
liquor, fit for some part.

A Caldron is another brazen vessel, which suspended on a Chimney-hook, hangs
over the fire, that whatsoever is contained in its cavity may be cocted. But
seeing this, and more of the vessels are culinary ones, I shall not need to
stand any longer upon their description; especially seeing the Apothecary knows
them well, who uses them often to prepare the decoctions of Simples, and to the
preparation of Syrupes, Unguents, and other Confections.

CHAP. 6. Of Torculars and Presses.
PHarmacopolists have also their little Torculars, wherewith they express
succes and oils by pressure; and this sort of Press is made of two short pieces
of wood, alike in form and magnitude; each whereof have two holes so cunningly
excavated, that within they seem to be two carved circles, not recurring one
against another; wherein two iron Rods are introduced, which by turning
extrinsecally, abduce the beams, and open the Press; but by prying
intrinsecally, adduce and shut it, pressing the interposed matter, and
expressing its watery or oleous succe.

There should be two Presses in each Pharmacopoly; one to express aqueous
succes out of green fruits and herbs; and another, oleous out of Olives.

Such things as are to be pressed, should by coction or triture be prepared for
the press: by coction, thus; flesh must be prepared, whose expressed succe is
given to such as are tabid and lean, by long diseases: by triture, as some
oleaginous Woods, Fruits, and Seeds: which last, lest they should leap and fly
away, must be included in a bag, or a strong cloth, that they may be better
compressed, and the tenuious substance more easily separated from the crass
one. Thus Oil of Almonds is educed; thus the juice of Lentisks, Dates, Nuts,
Line-seed, and the like, is expressed, as we shall hereafter show.

CHAP. 7. Of Sieves and Incernicles.
PHarmacopolists have now got a custom, to call those Instruments which
separate the purer portion of the Medicament from the crasser, Sieves: but this
rustic enunciation is too licentious and abusive; since rusticks Sieves, not
Apothecaries Instruments, are made of skins perviated with many, but small
holes, to purge Corn with.

There are also other Sieves made of Horses hairs, intertexed like a web, to
segregate the Bran from flower; which Aromataries sometimes use in dividing
their Powders, and purging their Prunes, and Cassia-Fistula, from their stones
and seed, which by them are called seraceous subcirnicles, and sometimes
excussive incernicles, because agitated betwixt their hands they excuss the
small Powder. They are sometimes made of Wood, as when Teile-bark is discerpted
into long and small fibers, and lattice-wise connexed, for the cribration of
crasser Powders.

There are many common Sieves, but one peculiar to Aromataries; which being
contexed with more artifice, they call Tamis: it is sometimes made of Horses
hair, often of fine linen, and oftest of silk, operculated above and below with
a Rams skin upon a bending VVood, that the Powder received in the one casket,
may by cribration pass into the other, without any loss by prosilition.

Some of these are less then others, which are more idoneous, for suparating
precious Powders, which are only softly holden in ones hard, and the Powder
delabes without violence; others do not transmit the tenuious Powder without
much percussion.

There is yet another kind of sieve, in form of a great box, much in use; in
whose middle a certain web is intended, through which the Powders superimposed,
fall into the inferior part of the box: The trajection of the Powder will be
more easy and quick, if a Tin or Silver weight be superposed together with
the Powder, that by its motion and gravity may impel the excussive sieve
against some solid body.

All sieves and incernicles serving to segregate dry things, must be moved,
agitated, and impelled; but for moist things, they must remain quiet and
immote; yet the trajection of the things to be separated, may be helped by a
Spoon or Manipulus; as the pulpes of Tamarinds, Cassia, or Prunes; as also
Roots and herbs first cocted to putrelage, then transmitted by this adjument,
for the confection of Cataplasms.

CHAP. 8. Of Colatories or Strainers.
NEither can Pharmacopolies be without colatories of silk, linen, Canvas, and
Woolen; some whereof are rare, others dense, and others indifferent; and some
again, are new, others almost worn; and yet the newest are most used, because
the whole succe of the thing to be strained, may by more valid compressure be
educed, without the fracture of the cloth.

But sometimes these, sometimes the weaker are taken, according to the
consistency of the succes: those that are of themselves tenuious, need a denser
strainer, lest the tenuious part be not only transmitted, but some gross
matter with it. Those that are crass and viscid, must he trajected through a
rare strainer; those of a middle consistency, through a cloth of a middle
density.

Crass and viscid succes require three things; strong percolation, more ample
dilution, and a rarer colatory or strainer: they must also be calified before
collation; for so their density will be more rarefied, and they more easily
transmeate; yea, many will not percolate at all, unless they be very hot,
others when cold, and some only warm: some need only one colature, others
two, and others more; the first colature must be in a rare strainer, the second
in a dense one, and the third in a more compact one, that passage may be
obstructed to all filth: those that are of a liquid consistency, if they be to
be purcolated twice or thrice, it may be done in the same strainer.

There are certain VVoolen Strainers, of a long and pyramidall figure,
numerated amongst these colatories, which they call Hippocrates his sleeves,
wherein the Hippocratical Wine is twice or thrice strained, till it be clear.
These serve also for straining Melicras, congealing salves, and many
decoctions, that all extraneous matters may be separated from them, and they
remain sincere, as we have showed in our Institutions.

CHAP. 9. Of Furnaces.
SOme Furnaces serve only for decoctions, and receive Kettles, Dishes,
Caldrons, and other vessels; wherein simples are cocted, prepared and
compounded: others for distillations, and receive Cucurbites, Retorts,
Bladders, Pots, and other vessels, accommodated to Distillations; made either
by Ascent, or Descent.

Those that serve for decocting Medicaments, are not of one sort; for some are
portatile and rotund, made of molten or beaten Iron; which as their inferior
parts stand upon three valid legs, so does their superior emit three oblong
auricles, more prominent then the Furnaces lips, whereon the Vessels to be
calified are superimposed.

Their supreme part is patulous, like some gaping Mortar; into which coals are
immitted; a Gridiron, or ferreous trabicles, being supposited, which may give
way to the falling ashes, which are afterward extracted out of the posternal
door, structed for that purpose: others are made of Clay, and Bricks; which are
almost quad^ate, fixed, and immovable, standing upon no feet, but within like
the other.

Those which serve for distillations, whether we look at the matter whereof, or
form wherein, they are made, are multifarious; for some are made of Iron,
others of Copper, others of Potters earth, others of common clay, Bricks, and
other businesses requisite to structure; furthermore, some are round, as the
Metalline Furnaces, which have ears on both sides, that they may be carried by
others; Quadrilaterous, Pentagonous, Multifarious, fixed, and immovable;
wherein three Prothecaries are made; the Inferior, the Superior, and the
Middle.

The inferior receives the ashes, and is thence called the Cirerist, or by the
usual Chemical term, Conistery; whereinto a door opens, by which the burning
coals are ventilated by the wind, the Pabulum suppeditated to the fire, and the
ashes extracted: the middle Region of the Furnace, wherein the fire is, which
is divided from the Conistery by a certain craticle, is called Focus by the
latter age; for in it is the fomentation of the calour, which califies the
superimposed, in the superior Chamber of the Furnace; which is variously
formed, according to the various magnitude and figure of the vessel imposed
near that part where the Funary tube is, are certain previations for the smoke
to evade by. But we have tradited the most usual description of a Furnace, in
our Institutions: ( C. 31. Book 2.)

And as structure of the distillative Furnaces is various, so is it in many
elegant: for some are built like a Tower, like a Tortoise, and Simple, which
only contain one vessel; others are structed with very much artifice, and are
manifold, assurging with five or more ^^ricles, each one whereof contains a
peculiar vessel; thus one vessel may be full of hot water, to distill by a bath;
another of ashes; another of sand; another of another matter, according to the
various scope of the Operator: but I would have a Pharmacopoly filled with thus
many Furnaces, seeing it is made for Medicaments, rather then Instruments.

CHAP. 10. Of Alembicks and Cucurbites.
AN Alembick in its larger acception, complects Cucurbites, Retorts,
Glass-pots, and a certain Instrument of Copper, with three feet and three
partitions; in the lowest whereof ashes have their place; in the middle burning
coals; and in the highest a vessel covered with a rostrated capitel, in form of
a Cone, and sometimes round, with a refrigeratory, formed like a small cup,
that it may hold more water; which when it is hot, may be effunded through a
cock; posited in its decline, and other cold water affunded into it again.

But its more angust signification, denotes only a certain beaked distillatory
vessel, joined to another vessel, contained in the superior part of the
furnace; and such are our Alembicks, of Lead, Glass, or Potters-clay, whether
uniform, or acuminated above, broad below, like a bell, whence they are so
called: yet some are capitated and round, and often obvallated with a certain
refrigerative vessel, which they sometimes call a Capitel, sometimes a Hat;
because as the Head is covered with a Hat, so is that receptacle or vessel,
which contains the stillatitious matter; whose various form alters its
denomination, covered with an Alembick. It is sometimes called a Cucurbite;
sometimes a Bladder; sometimes Boccia, Matratium, a Pot, and other names.

But the Bell, whether it be alone, or set on the receptacle, is called an
Alembick; whereof there are two main differences, the one is beaked, which
emits a long channel, propendent like the snout of an Elephant, through which
condensed vapors delabe into the supposited vessel; the other wants this tube,
and is called a blind Alembick: this is proper to the Chemists, who use it in
sublimation, as the beaked one in distillation: some of these have such a long
tube, that they can traject it through the middle of a hogs-head, full of cold
water; which concretes, and contemperates the delabing water better.

Many have a beak deflected like a Serpent or Worm, which name it holds; and is
most accommodate to distill Aqua vitae, which the Chemists call Elixir vitae.

The magnitude also, and figure of the receptacles, are various; for some are
very ample, and bellied; others so small, that they exceed not the magnitude of
a Walnut; and these are destinated to Chemical operations: others are moderate
in capacity, some whereof are straight, as Vials, Urinals, Pots, Cucurbites,
whether greater or less, and Separatories; others inflicted, as Retorts, a
crooked Boccia, called Cornumuse.

Those things are distilled in straight Cucurbites, which are easily sublevated
on high; as Roots, Seeds, Leaves, Flowers, and Atomata's; those in oblique
ones, which are not so easily elevated, as Rosins, Lachrymae, Fats and Gums.

CHAP. 11. Of Tables and Counters necessary in Pharmacopolies.
NO Housholdstuff so small, no cottage so mean, but it contains a Table, or
some thing to eat at, and use; for the Table does not always serve for meat,
but many more works; as in a Pharmacopoly, to receive simples while they be
selected, separated, prepared, measured, orderly disposed, and put into
composition.

Therefore when some solemn and great composition is to be made, as the
Treacle, Mithridate, Aurea Alexandria, or the like, the Apothecary must make
use of a long Table, not in the shop, but in some more retired cubicle, where
he may more liberally select, accurately ponderate, safely keep, and exactly
mix and compound his Medicaments.

And a Money-Counter, or two, must needs be had, in every Pharmacopoly; for all
that are bought, or sold almost, are laid thereupon; this receives all that are
measured, trutinated, brayed in small Morters divided with Knives, or
integrally exhibited.

Its form should be quadrilateral, and it should have many exemptile boxes in
its antic part, which might hold many seeds, and keep other necessaries: in
the other side, next the seat where the Apothecary sits, should be some larger
boxes locked up, wherein some precious Medicaments may be contained.

On the top there should be a chink, or scissure, whereinto the Money received,
and gained, must be dimitted.

Over the counter there should hang a certain Instrument, fastened to the beams
with nails, not unlike a I inverted; in the inseriour part whereof, wooden or
iron nails should be fastened, whereon Scales of diverse magnitudes, Tongs,
Spatula's, and other instruments should be suspended, which being at hand,
might not be to seek.

Besides the wooden ones, they should have some Tables of Marble or
Purple-stone, with a Brayer of the same matter, wherewith Precious-stones may
be levigated.

They must have also a straight Log, which for ornament may be engraven with
soeveral images, to under-set their greatest Mortar.

CHAP. 12. Of little Chests, Boxes, and other officinary Vessels.
ALl the vessels in a Pharmacopoly, serve either for preparation of
Medicaments, whereof I have already treated; or for their reposition, of which
now: and they are Bottles, Pots for Ointments, Pots, Capruncles, Pitchers,
Chests, and Boxes.

Bottles are well known, and they are either of Glass or Clay, serving for the
repositure of distilled waters, which should occupy the lowest part of the
Pharmacopoly; these waters being heavier, and in greater quantity then other
Medicaments: and when frost comes, these Bottles should be reposed in a cellar,
that their waters may not be concreted, till the rigor of the cold be over.

Oyl-pots, which serve for keeping Oils, are sometimes of Potters clay; but
more frequently of Tin, and obduced with a cover, that they may be
operculated or opened with speed: Oils educed by infusion, should be reposed
herein.

There are great store of Pots in a Pharmacopoly; the greatest part whereof are
of Tin, some of Earth, and a few of Lead: Unguents are kept and reposed
herein.

Capruncles are all of Potters-clay, white and smooth within, with a handle on
one side, a tube on the other, through which the liquor may be effunded; and a
very patulous orifice above, that the liquor may more easily be affunded: they
are adorned with various colors and shapes: Syrupes are reposed herein.

Besides these vessels, there should be small ones, like little Pitchers, of
Glass or Clay, wherein cordial Powders may be kept; and they have a peculiar
place, adorned with more artifice, to stand in.

There should be also other small vessels of Tin, wherein several Masses for
Pills are reconded; each one in a peculiar skin wrapped.

There must be also certain ligneous vessels, for the reposition of
Medicaments; as Baskets, Chests, and Boxes. Baskets are contexed of vimineous
boughs or rushes, wherein many fruits are reposed: and they are ordinarily set
in the posterior tabern, or other angle of the shop; but if they be small ones,
they may be suspended in the shop.

Chests are quadrilateral, consisting of five short boards artificially
conjoined, besides a lid; wherein Barks, Wood, Mushromes, Flowers, Tables,
Bones, Horns, Cleyes, and the dry parts of Animals are reposed.

Boxes are round and profund; either made with a throw, or composed of a thin
broad chip, brought to a round form; wherein dry succes, Lachrymae, Gummes,
Minerals, and some dry Roots, are reposed.

The forepart of Boxes and Chests which stand before the shopsdoor, should be
adorned with certain Pictures; only a space should be left, wherein the Name
of the contained might be inscribed in golden or other letters.

Dry Plants are kept sometimes in Chests, sometimes in Bags; as also many small
roots; great roots are trajected on a thread suspended, and so dried and kept.

Thus I think I have briefly described all the Officinary supellectils; which
if any, because of the tenuity of his fortune, cannot purchase all, he must get
the more necessary.

CHAP. 13. Of the Conservation of whole or parts of Simples in a Pharmacopoly.
THe number of Simples which a Pharmacopolist stands in need of, is
indefinitive: for seeing all things sown or produced, all things on which man
conculcates, or which he can handle, are dirigible to his subsidy; He that
would in a short Catalogue complect all Medicinal Materials, undertakes no
less, then he that would depinge in a very small Table, the vastity of the
Universe. Nic. Praepositus indeed, in the beginning of his Antidotary, in many
Chapters recenseates many Simples, wherewith the Apothecary should be
furnished: but without doubt he has not mentioned the hundredth part of all
that serve to Medicinal uses: for every land brings not forth every Medicament;
but that which Nic. knew, some; this that he never saw, others whereof he never
made trial nor heard: out of India, and other Foraign Countries, some Simples
are brought, never before seen, nor known to us, and that daily.

And however, though to recenseate all Simples, and describe the name and form
of such as are of diuturnal use, be burdensome and superfluous, seeing special
Physicians undertaking this task, have not so satisfied the minds of young
men, but many of them will say, That they have either forgotten many, or spoken
of many superfluously: But let such Sycophants withold, whom Jupiter himself
cannot please: we will prosecute our purpose, and recenseate the chief Simples
which should be conserved in Pharmacopolies.

And these Simples of use, are either green or dry; the green are partly
suppeditated by the vicine Country, partly by Gardens; which may be depromed
from each, when need requires; as Hortensian Plants from Gardens, and
Sylvestrian from Woods, and other rural and incultivated places. Wherefore it
were needless to deduce all green Plants, whereof the Apothecary has diuturnal
use, into his Pharmacopoly, and so superfluous for him to be furnished and
surrounded with these; when it is enough for him to have a few of them at
opportune seasons, when exigence requires.

For a heap of green Simples, by long asservation, putrefie, and both their
quality and quantity are worsted. Therefore the Apothecaries act prudently, who
collect or buy green herbs only for a half or a whole week; for it were folly
for a man to onerate his shop with Mallows, Violets, Mercury, Brankurfine,
Pelletory of the wall, Fumatory, Endive, Sowthistle, Purslane, Borrage,
Henbane, and innumerable such others, which are used only green, and collected
in small quantity. Wherefore it were ridiculous to include these in bags, or
repose them in boxes, when he may easily, when exigence calls for them, deprome
them out of gardens or country; or if their feason be past, by the Physicians
advice substitute some other.

Dry ones therefore are only necessary to be kept; as of Roots, the five
apertives, and many other alteratives and purgatives; as the Roots of Cypres,
Angelica, Enula-campana, Grass, Liquorice, the greater Madder, Tormentil,
Bistort, Oinone, Gentian, Poeony, Orris-grass, Acorus, Galingal, Ginger,
Sweet-cane, both Berthworts, Asarum, Sowbread, Bartram, Dittany, Avens, both
the Ferns, Water-betony, Sea-Holly, Ragwort, Bugloss, Sorrel, Chyna,
Sarsaparilla, Marshmallows, the sea-Onyon, Garlic, the greater Comfrey,
Bryony, Mechoacam, Turbith, Polypody, Rhaponticum, Meadow-saffron, Rhabarb,
VValwort, both the Hellebores, and others less usual; besides those that are
usurped green.

Of cauls and leaves, these are especially to be preserved: both the
VVormwoods, Mint, Balsamite, Southernwood, Germander, Groundpine, Hyssop,
Calamint, Nep, Horehound, Peny-royal, Wintersavery, Thyme, Origanum, Dill, Rue,
Lavender, Marjoran, Basil, mother of Thyme, Clary, Scordium, Chamomile,
Melilot, Centory, Cetrach, Dittany, Dodder, S. John's Wort, Knotgrass, Betony,
Balm, Rosemary, Travellers-joy, Fluellen, Vervine, Marshmallows, yellow
Henbane, Mullen, Stoechas, Tamarisk, Mother-wort, Polium, Senna, Laureol, and
Bays.

Some Flowers also must be kept, because their faculties soon perish, but
especially the three cordial Flowers, and also the Flowers of Roses,
Pomegranates, Sage, Rosemary, Violets, Chamomile, Melilot, Broom, Orange,
VValflowers, Jasmine, Gilliflowers, Betony, S. John's Wort, VVater-lillies, and
Saffron.

Seeds necessary to be kept, are the four greater Refrigeratives, the four
lesser Refrigeratives, and the seed of Marshmallows, Arach, Radish, Barberies,
Plantain, Quinces, Fleabit, Line, Foenugreek, Cumin, Dill, Aniseed, Fennel,
Coriander, Agnus Castus, Ladies Rose, Burdock, Bastard-saffron, Dwarf, Elder,
Petroseline, Smallage, Ruscus, Asparagrasos, Gromwel-gith, Poppy, Basil,
Purslain, Carret, Angelico, Mustard, Brooklime, Treacle, mustard, Hartwort of
Candy, Lovage, Rocket, VVinter-cherry, Bays, Ground Ivy, Juniper, Cardamomes,
and all the Peppers, with many more.

Many Fruits also must be kept in Pharmacopolies; as, both sweet and bitter
Almonds, all sorts of Nuts, Oranges, Citrons, odoriferous Apples, Russetins,
Coloquintido, Sorb-apples, the fruit of the Cornel-tree, Prunes, Dates,
Mulberries, Figs, Quinces, Jujubees, Galls, Olives, Capers, Cypress-Nuts,
Acorns, Tamarinds, Myrobalans, Cherries, Anacardium.
the Beans of Malaca, etc.

Barks and Cores are either pilled off the Roots of Plants, as the bark of the
Root of the Capers shrub, or of the trunk of Plants, as Cinnamon; or of their
Fruits, as of Oranges, Lemmons, Pomegranates, and the like: few whereof need be
preserved, because when exigence calls for them, they may be taken of the
Fruits and Roots.

Many Gummes are necessary; as Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Sagapenum, Bdellium,
Opoponax, Assa-foetida, Rosin, clarified Rosin, Tragacanth, Storax,
Gumme-Elemni, Cedri, of the Cherrytree, Ivy, Prune, Juniper, Arabic, Mastick,
Gumme-Lacc. Myrrh, and Frankincense, with many more.

Other succes are kept, either liquid, and in bottles, with a little Oil above
them, as the juice of Lemmons, Gooseberries, and Barberries; or dried, as
Liquorice-juyce, as Opium, Acacia, Elaterium, Aloes, and Scammony.

More distilled Waters also must be preserved then Nic. recenseates: for, who
can enumerate, how many and how various, both Simples, and compound Waters,
are now distilled in shops, not only out of Plants, but also out of integral
Animals, or their parts?

But the use of cordial Waters is most frequent, and celebrated, as of the
Waters of Scabiose, Devils-bit, Goats-beard, Bugloss, Borrage, Roses,
Marigolds, Woodsorrel, Scordium: and of cooling Waters, these; Endive, Succory,
Water-lilly, Purslain, Plantain, Nightshade, Lettice, and many other waters,
which respect the Head, Lungs, or other parts of the Body; as of Betony, Balm,
Eyebright, Fluellen, Coltsfoot, Liverwort, Egrimony, Groundpine, Tamaris,
Pimpinel, Radish, Saxifrage, Pellitory, Hysop, Mugwort, etc.

CHAP. 14. Of Minerals and Metals to be kept in Pharmacopolies.
THey err equally, who ablegate all Minerals from the number of Medicament,
and who usurp them only in expugning diseases: for, as they do not conduce
in all diseases; so it is certain, that they profit in some cases: for Minerals
afford us every kind of Medicament, to wit, Alterative, Roborative,
Cathartical: Chalk, Litharge, and Vitriol, alterate; the Hyacinth,
Terra-Lemnia, and Emerald, roborate; Lapis-Cyaneus, Stibium, and Mercury,
purge. The effect also, besides the Testimony of perite men, shows, that there
are eximious faculties in Metals; for Gold beaten into thin leaves, and taken
with other idoneous Medicaments, cures many affections: Avicenna prescribes it
chiefly to such as are Melancholical, and to such as should have their
faculties roborated, or spirits exhilarated; and hence its dust is exhibited by
the richer, either in cordial confections, which receive of its leaves, as
Aurea Alexandrina, the confection of Alkermes, and Electuarium de Gemmis.

Gold is Chieftain amongst Metals, next Silver, then Brass, Tin, Lead, and
Iron: some add a seventh, to wit, Mercury, which is a Metal rather
potentially, then actually; but there are almost innumerable Minerals, as all
the sorts of earths, amongst which Lemnia holds the chief seat; then,
Bole-Oriental, then Erethrian, Setenusian, Samian, and Synopical earth, with
Ocre, and such Minerals as are effoded out of the bowels of the Earth; as
fossile Salts, Lime, Talkum, Misy, Sorry, Red-Lead, Chalk, Vitriol, Chrysocolla,
Auripigmentum, Alom, Sulphur, Crystal, Stibium; and such as cleave to Metals,
or are collected out of Furnaces wherein Metals are melted, as the flower of
Brass, Cadmia, Ceruse, Brass-Scales, Lead-Ocre, Pompholix, Spodium, Litharge,
and the dross of Brass.

Many stones also are much celebrated amongst Minerals, which for their
eximious virtues, and pulchritude, are called precious stones; as the Saphyr,
Ruby, Carbuncle, Emerald, Hyacinth, Granatus, Topaz, Beril, Achates, Sarda,
Carchedony, Haematites, Jasper, Selenite, Magner, Pumic, and Alome: whereunto
we may add those those that are elicited out of the Sea and waters; as odorate
Amber, Sea Salt, Whales-spume, Bitumen, Coral, Amber, Jeat, Antal, Dental,
Coralin, Spunges, and some others, which being endued with a more imbecile
faculty in Medicine, are omitted.

CHAP. 15. Of Animals, or parts thereof, which are to be kept in Pharmacopolies.
ANimals both nourish us while well, ture us while sick, and vest us always; or
by some other means, whether they be living, or intemperate, tend to our
emolument: as when we use them wholly, or some part or excrement of them, to
the curation of our diseases, nutrication of our bodies, or instauration of our
strength: for Musk and Givet, though excrements, wonderfully roborate the heart
and spirits.

Insects are integrally usurped, such as be Spanish-Flyes, Asels, Worms,
Lizards, Ants, Vipers, Scorpions, Frogs, Crabs, Swallows, and some littles
Birds.

The Medicinal parts of Animals are many, as a man's scull unburied, a Hearts
heart-bone, Sparrows and Hares brains, Boars and Elephants teeth, Frogs hearts,
Foxes Lungs, Goats Livers, Wolves intestines, Beavers and Cocks testicles, Hogs
bladders, Hearts genitals, Serpents skins; Man's, Hogs, Gooses, Sheeps, Ducks,
Badgers, Conies, Goats, Snakes, and Land-Snakes fat; Hearts, Calves, and Goats
marrow; Man's, Stock-Doves, and Goats blood; all Milk, and all that comes of it,
as Whey, Cheese, and Butter; Hens, Partridges, and Ants eggs; Honey, Wax,
Propolis; Hearts, Does, and Unicorns horns; Elkes, Oxes, and Goats Cleyes;
Oysters, Margarites, and many fishes shells.

And seeing excrements have their Medicinal virtues, Pharmacopolists must also
have them in keeping; as Goats, Dogs, Storks, Peacocks, and Stock-Doves dung;
Sheeps grease, Silk, Musk, Civet, and the hairs of some Animals.

And that I may briefly complect all, all the simple Medicaments we have
described in our three Books of Medicinal matter, are necessary for a
Pharmacopolist.

CHAP. 35. Of Compound Medicaments, to be kept in Pharmacopolies.
When the Pharmaceutrical Art was not yet reducted to an Art, nor any
Medicaments, save a few, described or digested into order; then, what compounds
should be retained, and what rejected, was not determinable.

Nicolaus Praepositus indeed described many Medicaments; some whereof he
himself disapproves of, others he transcribed not faithfully, and others he
depraved, by changing something in them: so that from his writings, we cannot
conjecture what to keep, or what not.

Nic. Alexandrinus heaps up such a mole of Medicaments, that they would rather
puzzle, then help an Apothecary.

Actuarius also, Aetius, and Oribasius, describe many; which consisting of
unknown, and rare Simples, are found either inept, or neglected, as endued with
no eximious qualities.

Amongst the latter Writers, Ferneleus, Sylvius, and Rondeletius, have
diligently examined the Medicaments invented by the Ancients, and have rejected
some as inconcinnate, others they have proved, illustrated, and commended, as
invented by riper Judgments, and endued with Nobler faculties.

I have diligently selected the most excellent from learned men, and the most
approved from old and expert men; and of them extracted my Pharmaceutrical
shop, or Antidotary, orderly composed into six books; wherein all the approved
troop of Alterative, Purgative, and Roborative Medicaments, are described;
which being used either by intrinsecal assumption, or extrinsecal adhibition, I
have exhibited those to be introsumed, if Alteratives, in form either of
syrupes, or sapes, or conserves, or eclegms; if Purgatives, either in the form
of a liquid Electuary, or a solid one, or Trochisks, or Pills; if Roboratives,
either in form of a powder, or an opiate confection, or of Pastils: those to be
extraneously adhibited, either in form of an Oil, or an Unguent, or a salve.

All which receipts and forms of Medicaments we have exhibited in distinct
Books and Chapters, described in a good method; wherein all the Medicaments are
contained, wherewith Pharmacopolies should be furnished and guarded. He shall
require no more, neither can he be well furnished with fewer, who desires well
to cure the several affections of man's body.

The Apothecaries Shop, OR, ANTIDOTARY. THE FIRST BOOK. Of Alterative and
Preparative Medicaments, Distinguished into eight SECTIONS. The first whereof
describes only Syrupes selected and approved by long use.
THE PREFACE.
HOw necessary a Method is in delivering of Disciplines, I think is well known
to any moderately-learned man: For without a method, there is no certain rule,
neither for Learner or Teacher to walk by: but with this, Arts are more firmly
established, their Theorems more optably read, and easily learned. Yet you
shall scarce find two, who in writing Antidotaries, have kept in one rode, or
disposed their Compounds in one order. Some preposterously propose Nic.
Praepositus for their example; who himself imitating one Nic. Alexandrinus, out
of whose Works he excerpted those his Works, he calls [Joan. Agricol. Ammonius,
and M. Tatius Alpin.] went on Alphabetically, treating first of those
Medicaments which begun with the letter (A) then with the letter (B) and so he
spoke promiscuously of the Antidotes Acetum Scylliticum and Amylum. Sylvius,
Fernelius, and Joubertus, of the later Writers, have assayed by certain Laws
and Rules, to establish an orderly and duly-disposed method; yet they much
dissent among themselves; and what one of them approves, another disapproves:
yet all think that order is best, which curation prescribes: for a series of
words only demonstrate.

We have observed this method in our Shop, wherein are contained all
Medicaments, for the expugnation of all diseases; not confusedly described, but
such as must be introsumed, are digested in the former part of the Antidotary,
such as must be extrinsecally adhibited in the latter part thereof. The first
part is distributed into three Books; the first whereof treats of Alterative
and Preparative Medicaments; the second of Purgatives; and the third of
Cordials, or Roboratives. Each Book is disterminated into many Sections, and
they subdivided into many Chapters; the first whereof treats of Syrupes; and
first of such as are made of the first and Springflowers, as Syrup of Violets,
Syrup of Coltsfoot, and of the flowers of Peach-trees.

CHAP. 1. Syrupus Violarum; or Syrup of Violets.
of Violet flowers fresh, and picked 2 lb. Infuse them eight hours in 5 pints
of hot scalding water, in a close An Insusionpot. The Author appoints an equal
quantity of sugar to the infusion.
pot well glazed: afterward press them out; and the same Infusion made hot
again, add to it the same quantity as before of fresh Violets, Infusing them 8
hours more, and so sive times repeated: add to the Colature 10 lb. x. of
Loaf-sugar, and so make it into a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Nature alone confects no Syrups, but they acquire their mixtion, coction, and
consistence, by Art: yet that which is made of Violets, Water, and Sugar only,
is called a simple Syrup, in reference to the more compound; which besides
these, admit of the seeds of Quinces, Mallows, Jujubs, Sebesten, and the water
of Gourds; whose Author they make Mesue: but, that I know of, I never found it
thus confected in him. That which we call the Simple Syrup is made in every
Pharmacopoly, but not alike simply confected: for it is sometimes made of the
succe of Violets and Sugar, sometimes of the same, infused and expressed twice,
thrice or oftener; for many infuse and macerate new Violets seven times, others
eight, and some nine. But Fernelius thinks that so often iterated infusion is
needless: They in vain (says he) reiterate the maceration of Violets nine
times, for Syrup of Violets; seeing after the third or fourth infusion, the
Syrup will be as efficacious as after more: But I think that better which is
confected by many infusions.

Some put the expressed succe of Violets, others the conserve of Violets, in
this syrup, incrassated by coction, to make it more Violaceous: others make it
of pure succe of Violets, and white sugar; others coct their sugar first, to
the consistence of an Electuary, and afterward, with the said succe of
Violets, into the crassitude of a syrup.

Many put a difference betwixt the syrup of Violets, and the Violaceous
syrup; calling that the syrup of Violets, which is made of purged flowers,
and that violaceous, which is made of integral and not purged ones: and this
indeed has less of Violets faculties in it, but it is more solutive; for the
herbaceous part is emollitive, as well as its leaves: some put only four
pounds of sugar to five of succe, and coct it into the consistence of a syrup.

Syrup of Violets breaks the acrimony of Choler, tempers the heat of the
bowels, subduces the belly, Qualitates.
and conduces to the vices of the breast. It is a special auxiliatory in
pectoral and lateral inflammations, and against the roughness of the Aspera
arteria: and is very good against the heat of Fevers, choleric and acute
diseases, the ardour of the intrails, and will quench thirst.

CHAP. 2. Syrupus Tusilaginis; or, Syrup of Coltsfoot.
of Coltsfoot fresh m. vj. Maidenhair m. ij. Hyssop m.j. Liquorice ij. boil
them in four pintes of water, till the fourth part be consumed: let the
Colature be clarified, and add thereunto of the finest sugar lb iij. boil it
up to a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
This syrup is denominated from Tussilage, as from its basis, which ingredes
it in greater quantity: Its author is uncertain, and thence its preparation
various. But we have exhibited the best description, appointing the four
prescribed simples, to be cocted in four pounds of water, but lightly.

Those that make this syrup in the beginning of the spring, take only the
flowers of Tussilage; those that make it in summer, add as much of the green
leaves, as they take of its green flowers. Some make it in the middle of
summer, only of the succe of its leaves depurated, and sugar: it may be very
well made of the decoction of the flowers and sugar, and be called simple
syrup, in reference to the former more compound, which admits of the true
Maidens-hair; in stead whereof, Polytrichum may be substituted.

It helps shortness and difficulty of breathing, the asperity of the windpipe;
it cocts, moves, and expectorates spittle: but it must be licked like an
Eclegm, that it may stick longer in the Osophage, and reach the amplitude of
the asper artery.

CHAP. 3. Syrupus florum Persicorum; Or, Syrup of the flowers of Peaches Tree.
of Peach flowers fresh lb j.

Infuse them in three pintes of warm Water, for xij hours; afterward Boil
them a little, and express them; and let the like quantity of flowers be again
infused in the same Colature, and this repeated five times; and to the Colature
add lb iij. of sugar, which Boil into a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
This syrup is either made of the fruits, or the flowers of the Peach-tree:
that which is made of its fruits is seldom in use, as Christophorus, Mesues
commentator, confesses; and it is made in the beginning of Autumn, as that of
the flowers in the beginning of the Spring. Three things require that this
syrup be made of fewer infusions; to wit, the loss, penury and amaritude of
the flowers: the loss of the flowers, which can be regained by no Art; for the
flowers being evelled, new ones grow not again that year, and the tree remains
fruitless: the Penury of them; for this tree is sative only, and without
culture bears no fruit: their Amaritude, which will be more intolerable, by how
much the infusions are more.

This syrup educes water and choler, Vires.
kills worms, frees the Mesentery from infarctures; for it opens the passages,
incides and educes the humors.

CHAP. 4. Syrupus de Lupulo; Or, Syrup of Hops.
of the clarified juice of Hops lb iiij. the juice of Fumatory lb ij. white
sugar lb vj. Boil them according to Art, and make it into a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
All do not describe this syrup alike: for some make it only of the succe of
Hops and Sugar; others add the succe of Fumatory; to whose judgment I rather
incline, for thus its faculties are bettered: it must not be made, till the
season in the Spring be pretty hot; for till then, the Fumatory, whose succe is
required, appears not; otherwise it must only be made of the succe of Hops
depurated, and Sugar cocted to legitimate spissitude.

It allayes the heat of the intrails, Vires.
attenuates cold and crass humors, educes hot ones; it conduces to the
Jaundies, Leprosy, and all diseases caused by obstructions.

CHAP. 5. Syrupus Rosarum Pallid: or, Syrup of Damask Roses.
of Damask Roses fresh, lb vj. infuse them eight hours in a close vessel in lb
xv. of warm Water; afterward express the flowers, and let the same quantity be
again infused, and this repeated nine times; and to the Colature add an equal
weight of Sugar to the infusion, and so Boil it into a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Some put not so much sugar to it, but coct it longer, till it grow thick; and
then it is more purgative, but less grateful to the palate: many following
Mesues advice, keep the first, though twice-iterated infusion in a glass well
operculated, putting Oil upon it, and insolating it forty days; and they call
this maceration of Roses, not expressed, but infused Mucharum Rosarum.

But lest some should judge us unmindeful of our purpose, because promising to
treat here only of Alterative and Preparative Medicaments, we have adjoined
syrup of Roses, which is absolutely Purgative; we Answer, that we describe the
most usual syrupes, in the same order that the season of the year gives them;
not remitting the Purgative, which are very few, till we treat of such
Medicaments: besides, these that do purge, they do it so ignavely, that they
are rather Preparatives then Purgatives.

It is alterative and Hydragogous; for it tempers hotter humors, Vires.
educes watery ones from very remote parts: if it be taken in great quantity,
when it is new made, it is more Purgative; when older, less: it may safely be
given to old men and children.

CHAP. 6. Syrup of Hispidula, or Aelurope, vulgarly called Cats-foot.
of the tops of the flowers of Cats-foot lb j. infuse them a whole night and
day in warm water lb v. afterward Boil them gently upon a small fire, till lb
iiij. of the Colature remains; to which add Sugar lb iij. and so boil it into
a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
It is fure enough, that this syrup has been but of late use, for they of our
age invented it; and, being imboldened by much experience, approved of it.
Joannes Gonerius, a Parisian Apothecary, and perite Medick, first made it at
Paris; who seeing the Plant whereof it was made, coming from the Turenian
fields, sought and found great plenty of it in fields near Paris, and of them
he made his syrup annually, not borrowing elsewhere. It is variously called, to
wit, Hispudula, Guaphilium, Coronario, Aelurope, or Catsfoot; and improperly
Harts-foot.

This syrup is multifariously made; and yet none has hitherto published its
confections: some only take the summities of the Plant, or its Down, and
macerate them in water; others take its flowers and leaves; to whom I easily
assent: for thus it becomes more astrictive, and more convenient to stay
fluxes; others add to its decoction, Liquorice, Jujubs, Raisins, Barley, and
other bechical matters. But this description we have exhibited, is most usual;
whereunto, if we add half a pound of rosaceous sugar, its quality will be more
bechical and cordial, and its sapour more gracious.

The manner of its preparation is so easy, that it needs no further
dilucidation, then that which is in its perspicuous description: if no Plant
but the dry one can be got, then its quantity must be less, and the waters
greater.

This syrup is eximious against many affections of the Lungs: for, Vires.
Aelurope or Hispudula, being a vulnerary Plant, and astrictive, it does not
only cure wounds, and hinder Ulcers, but heal many other vices. It is most
convenient for such as have fluxes descending into their breast, or have their
Lungs infarciated with much pituitous humors: for it cohibits the violence of
the falling humor, cocts the flux, roborates the part affected, and moves
expectoration.

CHAP. 7. Syrupus Papaveris simp. or, The Simple Syrup of Poppy. Mes.
of the heads of white and black Poppy, of each xij. ss. macerate them a whole
day in lb iiij. of Rainwater; and to lb j. of the Colature, add Sugar and
Penidees, of each vj. or lb ss. and so boil them into the consistency of a
Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue calls this syrup Simple, in reference to the more compound, whose
confection has many lenitives; as the seeds of Lettice, Mallows, Quinces,
Jujubs; Maidens-hair also and Liquorice ingrede: whereunto, if need be,
Fernelius would have syrup of Violets, or Jujubs, to make up this simple
syrup: he advises also to add less of black Poppy, because its use is not
safe, and augment the quantity of the white: To which assertion, Joubertus
assents against Rondeletius, and prescribes forty dragms of the black, to
eighty of the white.

Vulgar Apothecaries call this Syrup Diacodium, but imperitely; for Diacodium
is reposed among the Opiates: yet one may supply the defect of the other, when
sleep should be conciliated.

Poppies heads, by Galens advice, must be so long cocted after maceration, till
they be flaccid and marcid, and not till the third or fourth part of the water
be left; for we cannot express their succe, but when they are marcid: and
therefore it is in vain to coct them longer. Rainwater is the best; in defect
whereof, we may use fountain water, if it be limpid, insipid, and void of
qualities; and therefore the water conducted in leaden pipes, must not be
accepted, because there is mud in them: and hence, he that drinks the dregs of
such water, will be overtaken with the Dysentery, though in other cases they be
wholesome.

The Ancients Diacodium was made in form of an Opiate, and very ungrateful; for
it admitted of no sugar, but many insuave, and it is probable, useless things:
it is not now made, but in its stead, this syrup made of the decoction of
Poppies heads and sugar, which many call improperly Diacodium.

Syrup of Poppy conciliates sleep, Vires.
mitigates the temper of the choleric humor, and allayes the Cough: it
becomes more bechical, by the access of Penidia, which the Arabians call
Alphenicum, because of its whiteness: for it is a most white confection of
sugar, so long cocted in the decoction of Barley, till it acquires a ductile
consistence, and may be handled, ducted, and formed with ones hands into
Pastils and Rowls intorted like ropes.

CHAP. 8. Syrupus Papaveris Erratici; or, Syrup of Red-Poppy.
of the infusion of Red-Poppies twice or thrice reiterated lb ij. Sugar lb j.
ss. Sugar of Roses iiij. boil it into a Syrup according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Some contend, that this syrup should be made of more infusions; but two or
three are sufficient: for in so poriferous Medicaments, no intenseness of
faculties are requisite: moreover, so many infusions will make the color and
sapour of the syrup more ungrateful. The proportion of water to the sugar, is
the same in this, with that in syrup of Roses.

None of the Ancients spoke of this syrup of Poppy; but the later age found it
good against the Pleurisy, at the beginning thereof: for it is astrictive,
roborative, bechical, and hypnotical; it cohibits the humors falling down from
the head upon the lungs: and, that it may better effect this, some sugar of
Roses must be added: it may be safely given from half an ounce, to an ounce and
a half, and to two ounces to the more valid; especially if the Pleurisy be but
beginning, or not far gone: for it will either stay the former flux, or
hinder the rising of another.

CHAP. 9. Syrupus Nympheae; or, Syrup of Water Lillies.
of Water Lillies lb ij. infuse them six or seven hours in hot boiling water lb
iij. afterward boil them a little; and to the Colature, add again the same
quantity of fresh flowers, and let this be repeated three times; and to the
Colature, add an equal quantity of Sugar, to boil it up into a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Some make this syrup only of one infusion; but that is more efficacious,
which is confected of two or three: the green, herbaceous, and flave part also
of the flower, should be rejected, and only the white retained. This is
simple, in reference to one more compound, described by
Franciscus-Pedomontanus; which is seldom used, because the Simple one is more
easy of preparation, and no less efficacious. Moreover, the description of the
Compound is by some disallowed of, by some changed; by some the quantity of its
ingredients is augmented, by others diminished: its description is well known.

This syrup refrigerates much, Vires.
cohibits venereous dreams, restrains the immoderate flux of the sperm,
conciliates sleep, allayes the heat of the bowels, and abates the ardour of
Fevers.

CHAP. 10. Syrupus Capil. vener. Com. or, Syrup of common Maidenhair.
of the true Maidenhair, of the common Maidenhair, wall-Rue, Spleen-wort,
Salvia vita, of each m.j. Liquorice bruised ij. infuse them twelve hours in a
sufficient quantity of water; afterward boil them gently, till it comes to lb
v. add to the Colature White Sugar lb iiij. and so make it into a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
This is the most usual description of this syrup; whereunto some add Raisins
and Liquorice, others Jujubs; but none of these please Fernelius, who thinks,
that the syrup is made more ignave and weak, by the admistion hereof: but
Liquorice may be added; for besides its sweetness, it has a quality like the
capillaries; yet some reject it, because it makes the syrup more flave: but
the quality and virtue must be more looked after, then the color. The Parisian
Apothecaries make it accurately, according to the description here given, and
it is most eximiously Medicinal: they that do otherwise, mixing but a small
quantity of capillaries, and macerating them lightly, make indeed a pellucid
syrup, but both in color and virtue aqueous, and so defraud the Patient of
his expectation, and the Physician of his scope.

This is the most celebrated of Preparative syrupes: Vires.
for it is very useful to oppugn all affections of the breast, liver, spleen,
reins, uterus, and to tenuate and prepare humors: for it tempers and cocts
choler, incides phlegm, makes the melancholical humor easy to be expurged,
yea often subduces the belly by much use; it moves expectoration, incides and
cocts the humors contained in the Lungs, and educes them by a second purge.

CHAP. 11. Syrupus capel. Vener. Monspelie. or, Syrup of Monspelian
Maidens-hair.
of Maidenhair fresh and cut m.ij. infuse it twelve hours in a sufficient
quantity of water; afterward boil it a little; clarify the Colature, and to
lb v. thereof, add lb iiij. of Sugar, to boil it up into a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
This syrup is most frequently and simply compounded in the City Montpessier,
being only made of the light decoction of true Maidens-hair clarified, and
sugar cocted to the consistence of a syrup.

For thus it is most grateful, both in color and sapour; and yet that is more
grateful to the palate, which admits of Rose Water; which is adjected by the
Court-Apothecaries, that they may by guile, rather then science, gain their
Princes and Nobles grace, and get their money by subtilty.

It is of affine qualities, but more imbecile then that which admits of all the
Capillaries and Liquorice; for it is more ignave, in inciding and attenuating
the humors, and opening the passages: and that is most imbecile, which admits
of Rose Water; Vires.
for its faculty being somewhat astrictive, reluctates with those of the
Capillaries.

CHAP. 12. Syrupus de quinta radicibus; or, Syrup of the five opening roots.
of the root of Smallage, Fennel, Parsley, Butchers broom, Asparagrass, of each
iiij. boil them in a sufficient quantity of water, till it comes to lb iiij.
add thereunto as much Sugar as will make it up into a Syrup, according to art.

The COMMENTARY.
The roots must be first cleansed, then washed, cut in pieces; their middle cut
out and rejected; then brayed and cocted: some would have the coction made in
eight pounds of water cocted to five; whereunto, when strained and clarified,
they add four pound of Sugar: which manner and proportion I approve of.

Some would have some Vinegar added to the decoction, that its incisive faculty
may be augmented; but when use calls for it, it may be diluted in some
attenuating, opening, or other fit liquour, as the Medicks scope requires.

Some make it only of two roots, to wit, Petroseline, and Fennel roots: but
seeing it is less efficacious, and the other roots easily attainable, it is
better to make it with five roots, and then they shall not need that which is
made of two: But if one more studious of curiosity then necessity, would rather
have it of two, let him take of Petroseline and Fennel-roots each four ounces;
coct them in a sufficient quantity of water, and add to two pounds of the
colature, two pounds of Sugar, and make a syrup.

It incides and attenuates crass and glutinous humors, Vires.
diduces the passages, removes obstructions, expels Urine, moves fluors, ejects
sand, and emends the foetid color of Virgins, and the Jaundies.

CHAP. 13. Syrupus de Althea; or, Syrup of Marshmallows. Des. Fer.
of the roots of Marshmallows ij. red Licers i. of the roots of Grass,
Asparagrass, Liquorice, Raisins stoned, of each ss. the tops of Marshmallowes,
Mallows, Pellitory, Pimpinel, Plantain, both the Maidenhairs, of each m j. of
the four greater and lesser cool seeds, of each iij. boil them in lb vj. of
water, till four remain, and with lb iij. of Sugar make it up into a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
The use of this syrup is much celebrated in Paris, both for its eximious
faculties, and its Authors dignity; to whom posterity is much engaged, for his
illustration of the Medicinal Art, and for those many Medicaments wherewith he
has furnished Apothecaries shops. Syrup of Althea is most useful to sanative
Medicks: its preparation is thus; The roots must first be purged and washed,
then cocted; afterward, the Liquorice must be cocted, for by long coction it
grows bitter; then the herbs, and afterward the seeds: be made in water, to
the dissipation of its third part; Why liquorice must not be long boiled.
for longer coction makes the decoction more viscid: all the Simples whereof it
consists, are dilucidly explicated in the first Book of Medicinal Matter.

This syrup expurges crass and pituitous matters, Qualitates.
takes away obstructions, impels the sand in the Reins, and abates the heat of
Urine.

CHAP. 14. Syrupus de Cichor. comp. cum Rhaeo; or, Syrup of Succory compounded
with Rhabarb. Des. Nic. Florent.
of the roots of Smallage, Fennel, Asparagrass, Barley whole, of each ij. The
herbs of Succory, Dandilyon, Endive, smooth Sowthistle, of each ij. both the
Lettices, Liverwort, Fumatory, Hops, an. m.j. both the Maiden-hairs, Wall-rue,
Ceterach, Liquorice, Winter-cherries, the seeds of Dodder, of each vj. Boil
these in lb xij. of water, or a sufficient quantity, till a third part be
consumed: to the Colature add lb vj. of Sugar, which boil up to a Syrup; and
in the boiling, to every pound of the Syrup, add of Rhabarb ss. and Spikenard
iiij. tied up in a rag, and hung in the Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Nicolaus Praepositus, whom most Apothecaries have as president, doubles the
quantity of Rhabarb prescribed eight times, and adds four ounces of Rhabarb to
every pound of syrup; so that for every ounce of syrup, there are four dragms
of Rhabarb: and thus it is made all over Paris. That it may be exhibited when
use calls for it without delay, some only quadruplicate or triplicate the
quantity. This so ample quantity of Rhabarb, displeases Fernelius, Joubertus,
and others, as being of no utility, but much loss; who think that it were more
profitable, when use calls for it, to infuse some Rhabarb in a convenient
decoction, and mix it with the syrup, because its purgative faculty perishes
by coction and asservation. Yet they act prudently, that make it with eight
times as much Rhabarb: though its faculties be more imbecile, yet it has other
qualities thereby bettered.

The syrup of Succory, compounded with Rhabarb, is alliotical, Qualitates.
roborative, and purgative: it allayes the heat of the intrails, demulceates
the acrimony of choler, opens the veins, takes away obstructions, roborates the
liver, gently purges the stomach, and upp^r region of the body, educes hot and
pituitous humors: if it be assumed in great quantity, it helps in all bilious
diseases, and it may be given safely to all ages and sexes.

That which is made without Rhabarb, is called Simple syrup, though it admit
of all the described Simples, except Rhabarb and Spikenard.

But there is one far more Simple, made only of the succe of Succory
depurated, and Sugar cocted to a legitimate spissitude.

Both of them are good for such as have hot livers, stomachs, and fevers; and
such as labor under the ardour of bowels and obstructions.

CHAP. 15. Syrupus de Endivia simplex; or, the Simple Syrup of Endive.
of the Juice of Endive clarified lb viij. of white Sugar lb v. boil them into
a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Some conceive, that this syrup should be made of the succe of wild Succory
and Sugar; others will rather have it of Endive, because it is more
refrigerative, and not so bitter: in other qualities they agree.

But seeing Intubus is the genus to all the differences of sative Succory, as
Endive and Broadleaf; The syrup may be made of each succe, without
discrepance, and yet be called the Simple syrup of Endive or Intubus: nay,
some in a larger acceptance, call it Syrup of Succory; there being so much
affinity both in form and faculty, betwixt the sorts of Succory and Intubus,
that each may be used for other, without any manifest error.

It mitigates the ardour of the Liver, Vires.
extinguishes the heat of Fevers, and obtunds Choler.

CHAP. 16. Syrupus de Fumar. simpl. or, The Simple Syrup of Fumatory.
of the juice of Fumatory clarified lb ij. ss. Sugar lb ij. boil it into a
Syrup, according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
There are two descriptions of the syrup of Fumatory; the one more compound,
consisting of more ingredients; the other less, consisting only of the succe
of Fumatory and Sugar: The first being hard to make, they often put to young
Apprentices at Paris, to try their ingeny; and a syrup prepared of those
Simples, which are described in its form, is very insuave in odor and sapour,
and black of color: and therefore it cannot be an Alterative Medicament,
because ungrateful and ignave; nor yet Purgative, because inefficacious: it is
better therefore to keep the Simple syrup in Pharmacopolies. Now that it may
be rightly made, the succe of the Fumatory must be depurated in the sun; when
clarified, mixed with an equal weight of sugar, if the syrup must be sweet; if
not, less: But when the Fumatory's amaritude would be ungrateful, it must be
dulcorated with more sugar.

Now Fumatory is a vulgar Plant, whereof there are two sorts; the one
Hortensian and bulbous, which is seldom used in Medicine; the other equally
growing in cultivated and incultivated fields: of whose succe this syrup is
made.

It frees the Hypochondria from obstructions, mitigates choler, Vires.
prepares Melancholy succe, and cures such Fevers as arise from the hot
distemper of the Liver.

CHAP. 17. Syrupus de Fumaria major; or, The greater Syrup of Fumatory. D. Mes.

little in water, from lb x. till lb iij. remains: to the Colature of which,
add of the Juice of Fumatory clarified, and white sugar, of each lb iij. make
it into a syrup, according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
But that I have seen this syrup in many shops, I should willingly have
omitted it: for many will reject it, and think it not worth the description,
because of its sapour and color. Besides, its description prescribes no order
for its composition; but it begins sometimes with Mirobolambs, sometimes with
Flowers, sometimes with Plants leaves, and sometimes with Roots and Fruits.

But that this composition may be rightly peracted, first, Polypody must be
contunded and elixated; whereunto, when moderately cocted, Prunes, Raisins,
Wormwood, Epithymum, Binde-weed, Roses, and Liquorice must be added; then all
must boil together, till seven pounds of the water be absumed; only the
flowers must be added a little before. Sugar must be added to the Colature, and
all cocted to the consistency of a syrup: in the cocting, the expressions of
Cassia, Tamarinds, and Mirobolambs must be added, and so the syrup, besides
its other faculties, will be Purgative.

It gently subduces the belly, opens the passages, Vires.
removes obstructions, takes away all affections and vices of the skin, arising
from salt or adust humors.

CHAP. 4. Syrupus Buglossi; Or, Syrup of Bugloss.
of the Juice of Bugloss clarified lb vj. of the flowers of the same lb j. boil
them a little; and to the Colature ad lb iiij. of sugar, boil it up into the
consistency of a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
This syrup being easy to make, and of eximious faculties, may not be
omitted. That it may be duly made, the brayed Bugloss must lie in a moist and
cold place a whole night, or a day; then it must be calified and expressed; for
its succe being viscid, will not otherwise be easily educed: when it is
expressed, it must stand, to subside. Some contund the flowers of Bugloss, and
coct them a little in that succe, when clarified; others coct them in water,
and affund the colature with sugar upon the succe: all which they coct to the
consistence of a syrup. Some take only the leaves, others the roots of
Bugloss; but I hold the whole Bugloss more convenient.

Syrup of Borrages succe, is made after the same manner, and works the same
effects; so that he that has the one, needs not the other.

It is good for such as are marcid with long grief and sadness, Vires.
labor under the Hypochondriacal melancholy, or splenatick affections.

CHAP. 19. Syrupus de succo Acetosae; or, Syrup of the Juice of Sorrel. D. Mes.
of the Juice of Sorrel depurated in the sun lb iij. white sugar lb ij. Boil
them together, and make it up into a syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
This is the most Simple of syrupes; some make it after the same manner with
the former; others coct sugar to the consistence of a solid Electuary,
whereunto they afterward add the depurated and percolated succe; then
fervefie the mixture, till it attain the consistence of a syrup. But more
frequently, they coct, purge, and percolate the succe, and mix it with
clarified sugar, which they coct to a syrup; but then its faculties are more
imbecile.

This syrup, Vires.
according to Mesue its Author, abates bilious and pestilent fevers,
extinguishes the flammeous ardour of the heart and ventricles, and
contemperates the aestuating bowels.

CHAP. 20. Syrupus Acetatus simplex; or, The simple of Syrup of Vinegar, or
Oxysacharum. D. Mes.
of the purest Sugar lb v. Fountain Water lb iiij. boil them together, till
half the water be consumed; then add white wind Vinegar lb ij. or 3 or 4 lb.
according to the accidity required, and so boil it up into the consistency of a
Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Though this syrup may be made at any time, yet we subjoyn it to the former,
because they have much affinity betwixt their faculties: it is called
Oxysacharum, for the Vinegar and Sugar whereof it consists. That it may be
rightly made, Mesue would have it cocted in Earthen, Tin, or a Stone-vessel;
not Brass or Copper, as some do: some would have distilled Vinegar; but its
quality being very sharp, it hurts the ventricle and nerves: the common Vinegar
is better, and more accommodate, whose various proportions the Author may
prescribe, as the Medick would have it sharper, or less sharp.

It refrigerates hot humors, incides crass and viscid ones, Qualitates.
attenuates and prepares them for expulsion; it arceates putretude, quenches
thirst, and allayes the inflammation of the bowels.

Myrepsus exhibits another simple syrup of Vinegar, whose use I approve of;
and it is thus described:

Vinegar iiij. Juice of Pomegranates viij. sugar lb j. boil it up to a fit
consistency.

It is made as the former; and both of them are called Simple syrupes, in
distinction to another more compound, whose description Nic. Praepositus gives:
But seeing it is of rare or no use, we shall omit it.

This incides crass humors, moves and impels them, if inherent; Vires.
allays calid humors, refrigerates the heat of the ventricle and liver, and
emends the corruption of the humors: or any syrup of Vinegar kills worms,
whether in the Intestines or in the Veins; as I saw in one of Paris, in whose
basilical Vein was a worm of a palms length.

CHAP. 21. Syrupus de Byzant. simp. and comp. or, The Syrup of Dynari, or the
Byzantian.
Syrup both Simple and Compound.

of the Juice of Endive, Smallage, of each lb ij. Hops, Bugloss, Borrage, of
each lb j. boil them a little, and clarify them; and to lb iiij. of the
Colature, add lb ij. ss. of sugar, to make it up into a Syrup.

The Compound you may thus confect:

of the aforesaid Juyces rightly clarified lb iiij. in which boil Roseleaves
ij. Liquorice ss. the seeds of Annis, Fennel, and Smallage, of each iij.
spikenard iij. strain it, and add Vinegar lb ij. the whitest sugar lb ij. ss.
or lb iij. boil them according to Art, to the consistency of a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Both the syrupes are usually made; but he may omit the Simple one, that makes
the Compound; as also the Compound syrup of Vinegar, for it will supply the
want of both. The Arabians call it Dynari, because it purges the Ureters; not
from Denarium, a piece of Money, as some think: neither can I credit Bern:
Dessennius, who says, That this Name was invented by an inept and covetous
fellow, who by Dynari portended some sum of Money.

It is called the Byzantian syrup, from Byzantium, or Constantinople, where it
is very frequent, or was invented; or else because Mesue had its description
from some Byzantian Medick.

This syrup opens, Vires.
incides, and attenuates: it frees the Liver from obstructions, as also the
Spleen and Mesentery: it helps the Jaundies, moves fluors, and cures Fevers,
which arise from viscid humors.

CHAP. 22. Syrupus de Moris comp. or, The compounded Syrup of Mulberries.
of the Juice of Mulberries not altogether ripe lb ss. of the Juice of red
Black- Before they be ripe.
berries, honey despumed, of each lb j. Wine boiled to a good consistence.
sapa iiij. boil these according to Art, to the consistency of a syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
As in stead of Diacodium, which was made in form of an Opiate, we use now the
simple syrup of Poppies: so in stead of Diamorum, the syrup of Mulberries; to
whose confection, some now add the succe of Rassberries, and of Straw-berries,
thus confecting it of three kinds of Berries; others leave both out, and sape
also: the succes must be cocted with honey, to the consistence of a syrup,
which is more dilute then Diamorum, or Rob of Mulberries, which is now seldom
made, most using this compound syrup in its stead.

The simple syrup of Mulberries also is very good, which is made of (...)
succe and sugar; whereunto, if you add a little Rose-wat^^* It will be more
grateful, and efficacious in roborating, and staying fluxes.

The compound syrup cures the eroding Ulcers of the mouth, Vires.
the affections of the teeth and gums, the relaxation of the uvula or flesh in
the orifice of the throat, and all vices of the mouth. It may be taken alone
out of a spoon, or diluted in some convenient decoction, in form of a Gargarism.

CHAP. 23. Syrupus Ribes and Berberis; or, Syrup of Red-Currans or Berberries.
of the Juice of Red-Currans or Berberries lb iiij. sugar lb ij. ss. boil them
according to Art, to the consistence of a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
The vulgar French call this Grossula rubra, the Moors Riben, and the shop-men
Ribes: they are small, round, red fruits, racemously coherent, pregnant with
much succe and small stones, which tunded and pressed, emit a succe; which,
after clarification and colation, must be mixed with sugar: but the sugar must
be added in less quantity to this, then other cold succes; because this succe
will keep long without corruption; and because; by too much sugar, its
pergrateful acidity will be obtunded, and the syrup weakened.

Berberries succe must also be so extracted, and so cocted with sugar into a
syrup. Berberries is a word deduced from Avicenna's Amyrberis, which Dodoneus
makes Oxyacantha.

Syrup of Ribes or Berberries, stays bilious vomiting, Vires.
cures hot ^evers, and Heart-aches, quenches thirst, and cohibits the
immoderate Belly-flux.

CHAP. 24. Sir. de Agresta, seu de Omphacio; or, The Syrup of sour Grapes.
of the Juice of sour Grapes depurated by residence lb v. white sugar lb iij.
boil them together to a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue makes it as the syrup of the succe of Citrons; therefore he confects it
of Omphacium and a Julep, which is of water and sugar, in a Tin or
Potters-vessel, not in a brazen or copper one; the Omphacium must first be
cocted to the thirds, then the sugar must be added, which must first be cocted
in thrice as much water, and clarified; then the mixture must be fervefied into
t^^ ^nsistence of a fyrupe. Some (says Mesue) add Cloves; but (...) are
better left out. Their custom is commendable, who first coct sugar to the
consistence of an Electuary: whereunto, they then add the succe, and coct them
lightly into a syrup; whereinto, they inject the succe of immature Grapes,
that it may be more acid.

This syrup benefits the heart, Vires.
stays vomitings, and the bilious flux of the Belly; quenches thirst, allayes
the heat of the Bowels, recreates the stomach laden with hot humors, cures
bilious Fevers, and is good against poisons. Mesue.

CHAP. 25. Syrupus Limonum and Granat. or, Syrup of Lemmons and Pomegranates.
the Juice of Lemmons or Pomegranates, depurated in the sun, and trajected
through a woollen strainer lb v. white sugar lb iij. boil them gently to the
consistency of a syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
These two Syrupes are jointly described, because their Preparations are one,
the proportion of sugar to their succes the same, and their faculties similar
and affine. Some coct the sugar to the consistence of a solid Electuary:
whereupon, they affund their limpid succe, agitate it with a Spatula, and by
gentle coction reduce it to a Syrup. And this preparation is good: for thus
the faculty of the succes is not obtunded by the fire, but preserved whole and
entire: others elixate the succes to the consumption of their third part, and
thereupon affund a simple Julep, and coct them into a Syrup.

Some take the succes, and dilute them in twice as much sugar, and withal
califie them together, that they may better become a Syrup: and the Syrup
thus confected, will keep best, and has a very idoneous consistence. So the
succes be acid enough, it may also be made by insolation, without fire, by the
addition of more sugar: But the method prescribed, is the easiest, shortest,
and best way of making it, and most in use.

Syrup of Oranges, and many other fruits, may also be thus confected.

The syrup of Lemmons asswages continual, pestilent, Vires.
and contagious Fevers, and all diseases accompanied with great ardour: it
emends also the corruption of humors, heart-ach, and other heart-affections.
The syrup of Pomegranates also recreates the heart, ^^cates putretude, cures
the diseases and vomitings of choler, and stays Belly-fluxes.

CHAP. 26. Syrupus Citoniorum simplex; or, The simple Syrup of Quinces.
of the Juice of Quinces lb x. boil it, till half be consumed; let it stand two
days to settle; afterward strain it, and add to it sugar lb iij. boil it up
into a syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
The manner of confecting this syrup, is various; for some add Wine, others
Vinegar, others both, and many, Aromata's; and so make it a compound syrup.

Some would have it more simple, and make it without cocture, purging its succe
by residence and insolation; then having clarified it with sugar, percolate and
coct it: some dilute the sugar in water, and coct it well, and then adject the
succe, and elixate them a little into a syrup; others make it otherwise: but
the description we have given, is most usual, easy, and best.

This syrup roborates the ventricle, stays vomiting, Vires.
represses belly-fluxes, helps such as labor under the Dysentery, Cholick,
bloody flux, immoderate flux of fluors, or Haemorrhoids, and stays
distillations falling from the head, to the breast and inferior parts.

CHAP. 27. Syrupus de Pomis simplex; or, the simple Syrup of Apples.
of the Juice of sweet-Apples, the Juice of sower-Apples, of each lb v. boil
them till half be consumed; then let it stand that it may settle; afterward
strain it, and with lb iij. of sugar, make it into a syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Some to the confection of this syrup, select the succe of Redolent, others of
Russetins; to whom I willingly assent: though Rondeletius refragate, who
disproves the succe of Russetins upon very infirm grounds, because their flesh
is hard: the succe of those they call Apples of Paradise, is also very laudable.

Some immerge silk newly tincted with scarlet in the succe, either before, or
after depuration, till it be red, and receive the virtue of the tincture, and
so become more excellent; others put Orange-juyce to it: but the description
tradited is best, according to Mesue.

Such Apples must be selected, as are not only fragrant with their suavity, to
recreate the heart; but also subacid, to exhilarate the parts appertaining to
the hearts Economy, arceate putretude, and contemperate Melancholical humors.

This syrup of Apple-juyce incides and diminishes Melancholical humors, Vires.
moves sudour, abates the hearts palpitation, helps its trembling and debility;
and, according to Mesue, prohibits swounding: so that it is of perpetual use.

CHAP. 28. Syrupus Regis Saboris; or, King Sabor's syrup. D.Mes.
of the Juice of sweet smelling Apples lb iij. the clarified Juice of Bugloss
and Borage, Let the Saffron be hung in a Nodule whilst the syrup is a boiling.
of each lb ij. the Leaves of Senna picked from its stalks iiij. Amseed, ss.
Saffron ij. sugar lb iiij. boil these according to Art, to the consistency of a
syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
No Pharmacopoly should be without this eximious syrup; to whose confection,
Senny must first be a little brayed, then macerated a whole natural day, with
Anise, in the succes described; afterward, once or twice fervefied and
strained: the expression strained and clarified, must be cocted into a syrup:
Saffron bound in a linen cloth may be cocted in it: it took its name from Sabor
King of the Medes; for the conservation of whose sanity, it was invented and
instituted.

It recreates the vital spirits, Vires.
exhilarates the mind, contemperates and purges melancholic humors,
attenuates crass and viscid humors, discusses flatuosity, gently subduces the
belly, and purifies the blood.

CHAP. 29. Syrupus Myrtinus, comp. or, the compound Syrup of Myrtle.
of the berries of the Myrtle-tree ij. ss. white Sanders, Rhois Culinariae.
red Sumach, Pomgranate flowers, Berberies, red Roses, of each j. ss. Medlars
lb ss. let these be bruised, and boiled in lb viij. of water, till it come to
lb iiij. add thereunto of the Juice of Quinces and Pomgranates, of each lb ij.
Sugar lb v. boil it to a syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
This syrup holds its old composition, wherein many astrictives are mixed
together, to supply the defect of Myrtle-berries, which are very rare; whereof,
if there were any plenty, it were better to make the syrup only of their
succe, and Sugar. Valerius Cordus mixes it with the succe of wild Apples;
Fernelius, of acid Pomegranates; which I like not.

It roborates the ventricle and bowels, Vires.
abates the antiquate bellyflux, prohibits the eruption of blood, and the
deflux of all humors from the head to the inferior parts.

CHAP. 30. Syrupus Menthae simp. and comp. or, the simple and compound Syrup
of Mint. D.Mes.
of the Juyces of Mint clarified, sweet Pomegranates and sour, of each lb j.
Sugar and Honey, as much as will make it into a syrup.

The Compound is thus made.

of the Juyces of sweet and dulcoacid Quinces, of acid and dulcoacid
Pomegranates, of each lb j. ss. Muzorum. Acido-dulcium.
macerate in these for 24 hours dried Mint lb j. ss. red Roses ij. boil them
till half be consumed: to the Colature add lb ij. of sugar, and in the boiling
hang in a rag ij. of Gallia Moschata.

The COMMENTARY.
These syrupes, by the consent of the Author, may be made either with Honey or
Sugar: but that is better, and more suave, which admits of Sugar; whereof
Fernelius adds twice the quantity to the succe: but the more usual way of
confecting the compound, admits of only two pounds of Sugar; as Mesue hints,
who in his own idiome, calls Dulcoacid and Semi-mature fruits, Muzae, that is,
pleasant; for then their sapour arrides the stomach. He that has the compound,
needs not the simple.

But if the Mint be dry, its quantity is greater; for it is enough that one
pound ten ounces be cocted in the succes, and as much Sugar added to this
Colature; for it will be very insuave, if made as Mesue describes it.

It roborates the ventricle, hinders heart-aches, vomiting, Vires.
sighing and belly-flux: but the more compounded is better.

SECT. II. Of Syrupes which may be made at any time.
IN the first Section, we described in order such Syrupes as should be
confected in the Spring, Summer, and Autumn: for the end of the precedent
season, being one with the beginning of the consequent, those Syrupes which are
made in the end of the Spring, may as well be made in the beginning of Summer:
so that I would not disterminate the former Thirty Syrupes into exact Sections;
yet we have given their description in such order, as the collection of the
Simples required; placing those first, which are made of the first flowers of
the Spring; those last, which are made of fruits in Autumn; and those in the
middle, which are made of flowers, roots, succes, and decoctions in Summer: But
in this Section, we shall only exhibit such as are or may be made in Winter,
or other seasons.

CHAP. 1. Sir. Rosar. siccan. or, Syrup of dry Roses. D. Fernel.
of dried Red Roses.
Roses lb j. Infuse them 24 hours in hot boiling water lb iiij. in the
expression, mix of the finest sugar lb ij. boil it up to the corsistency of a
syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Every one confects this syrup after his own arbitration; one while
augmenting, another while lessening the quantity of Roses; sometimes iterating
their maceration twice, and sometimes oftener: But no description can be more
exact, then this of Fernelius; wherein is observed, a due proportion of Roses
to the water, and of both, to sugar: and this syrup, confected with one
maceration, is all out as efficacious as any: but red Roses must be selected,
not white or pale ones.

It stays the belly-flux, Vires.
roborates the internal parts, gently deterges and agglutinates Ulcers,
asswages vomiting, and cohibits Rheumatism.

CHAP. 2. Syrupus Reg. sive Alexand. etc. or, The Princely or Alexandrian
Syrup, of old called, The Julep of Roses.
of Damask Rose Water lb iij. Loaf-sugar lb ij. boil it gently to a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
He that considers this syrupe's perspicuity, would, with Mesue, call it a
Julep; its consistence, a Syrup; and its suavity, a syrup for Alexander, or
some Prince: for, both Kings and delicate persons delight to use it. It is
easy to make, and may be made at any time; and no Pharmacopoly can well be
without it; though our Ancestors knew not of it, being not of skill to elicite
Rhodostagme or Rose Water.

Mesue describes another Julep of Roses, made of their infusion; after which
manner, two syrupes may be made; one of pale Roses, which is purgative; and
another of dry ones: but neither of them are justly called Juleps.

This syrup is cordial, bechical, roborative, and alterative; Vires.
helping the breast, liver, ventricle, thirst, and all ardour.

CHAP. 3. Syrupus de Absinthio; or, Syrup of Wormwood. D. Mes.
of dried Roman Wormwood lb ss. Roses ij. Spikenard iij. old white wind, Juice
of Quinces, of each lb ij. ss. macerate them a whole day upon hot embers;
afterward boil them, till half be consumed: and to the Colature, add
clarified honey lb ij. to make it into a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Dry Pontian or Roman Wormwood, must be taken, and minutely incided, that it
may be infunded with Roses and Spikenard in generous Wine, as Muskadine, or the
like, in an Earthen vessel leaded, 24 hours, upon the hot ashes; that done,
they must be fervefied once or twice; afterward, honey, or rather sugar, must
be added: some make two sorts; one, of honey and vulgar wormwood; the other, of
sugar and lesser wormwood.

Some make this syrup of one half pound of green wormwood, in three pounds of
water cocted to the third; adding to the colature, clear, generous, and ancient
white wind, and the best white honey, of each one pound, and coct them to the
consistence of a syrup. Which-ever of these ways it is made, it is very
ungrateful; and thence many rightly diminish the quantity of the wormwood, and
augment the sugar: for those things that would roborate the ventricle, if
ungrateful, subvert it.

This syrup roborates the stomach, Vires.
helps concoction, excites appetite, discusses flatuosity, opens the veins, and
moves urine.

CHAP. 4. Syrupus de Stoechade; or, Syrup of Stoecados. D. Fernel.
of the flowers of Stoecados iiij. Thyme, Calamint, Origanum, of each j. ss.
Sage, Betony, the flowers of Rosemary, of each j. ss. the seeds of Rue, Piony
and Fennel, of each iij. boil them in lb x. of water till half be consumed: and
to the Colature, add sugar and heney, of each lb ij. make it into a syrup,
aromatize it with Cinemon, Ginger, sweet-Cane, of each (...) tied up in a linen
rag.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue gives two descriptions of this syrup: in both which, he puts Pepper and
Bartram; which being hotter, are rejected by Fernelius: and he adds certain
cephalical Medicaments; to wit, Sage, Betony, Poeony, and Rosemary, that it may
acquire the effect the Author intends. This syrup is cognominated from its
Basis, to wit, Staecados; whereunto the rest are adjoined, to acquire more
cephalical and noble faculties. Sylvius permits it to be made with sugar, and
not honey, for the more delicate.

It conduces to many affections of the brain, Vires.
as Mesue attests; to which it would nothing confer, if it were made after his
description: for Stoechas, which he puts for its Basis, is more hepatical or
splenical, then cephalical: therefore Fernelius adds many cephalicals, which
make his syrup conduce to the Epilepsie, Cramp, Trembling, and all cold
affections of the brain.

CHAP. 5. Syrupus de Glycyrrhiza; or, Syrup of Liquorice. D. Mes.
of Liquorice scraped and bruised ij. white Maidenhair j. dried Hyssop ss.
macerate them a whole day in lb iiij. of rainwater, then boil them till half
be consumed: to the Colature, add of the best honey, penidees and sugar, of
each lb ss. Rose Water vj. and so boil them into a syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Many do right, in not cocting dry Liquorice long, lest it grow bitter, but put
it in in the end of the coction; they clarify the Colature with Penidia,
Sugar, and Honey, then coct it to a syrup, adding thereunto some Rose Water,
before it be perfectly cocted; which some disallow of, because the syrup is
confected for purgation, and the Rose Water is astrictive; to whose opinion
Joubertus subscribing, substitutes the water of the infusion of Roses as less
astrictive; but this water is therefore commixed, that the syrup may thereby
participate of an astrictive quality, and assumed in the beginnings of
diseases, stay the fluent humors, and coct such as have delabed.

The infusion may be desumed for want of the water, but not as less astrictive.

This syrup consists not only of simple, but compound Medicaments; to wit, of
Penidees, which are made of Barley, Water and Sugar, cocted in such proportion
and Art, that a very solid mass arises thence, so tractable, that it adheres
not to ones fingers, but may be drawn into small, long, crass, short or
intorted threads, always white: and hence its name is Alphenicum.

It stays the humors flowing from the brain, Vires.
cocts such as are fallen, helps the cough, and causes the expectoration of
cocted humors.

CHAP. 6. Syrupus Jujubinar. or, Syrup of Jujubees. D.M.
of Jujubees n. lx. Violets, the feeds of Mallows, of each v. Liquorice scraped
and bruised, Maidenhair, Barley, of each j. the seeds of Quinces, white
Poppies, Melons, Lettice, Gum Thraganth, of each iij. boil them in lb iiij.
of Fountain Water: to the Colature add of sugar lb ij. to bring it into the
consistency of a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
In confecting this syrup, the cleansed Barley must first be cocted, then the
Jujubs added, then the Liquorice, afterward Maidenshair, and the seeds of
Melons, Lettice, and Poppy; at length, Violet-flowers; and Tragacanthum in the
end, lest by longer coction it become fume.

It should be included with Mallows and Quinces-seed in a linen cloth, and
then cocted with the rest in four or five pounds of water, to the absumption of
the third part, and elixated with the said quantity of sugar, into the
consistency of a syrup: the coction should not be to the half, unless the
weight of sugar be abated.

It conduces to hoarseness, cough, pleurisy; it cocts, Vires.
moves and educes spittle, and that of Violets, and is a mean betwixt the
syrup of Poppy; it cohibits all fluxions, and cocts the defluxed humors.

CHAP. 7. Syrupus de Hyssopo; or, Syrup of Hyssop. D. Mes.
of dried Hyssop, the roots of Smallage, Fennel, Liquorice, of each x. Barley
ss. the seeds of Mallows and Quinces, Gum Thraganth, of each iij. Maidenhair
vj. Jujubees, Sebestens, of each n. xxx. Raisins stoned j. ss. dried Figs, fat
Dates, of each n. x. boil them in a sufficient quantity of water, to lb iiij.
to the Colature, add Penidees lb ij. make it up into a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
This syrup is cognominated from Hyssop, its Basis; in the confection whereof,
its Author Mesue is so far from defining a quantity of water, that he mentions
no water at all; but, they should take eight pounds, wherein they should coct
the Barley half an hour; then inject the incided roots to be elixated a quarter
of an hour; then all the fruits; at length the seeds bound in a linen cloth
with Tragacanthum, and at last pretty dry Hyssop, true Maidens-hair, or in its
stead vulgar Maidens-hair: Penidees made without starch must be added to the
Colature; by coction reducted to three pounds, and clarified: some had rather
put in sincere sugar; others, the water of sape and sugar: but it is best to
confect it according to Mesue's description.

The same Author describes more preparations of this same syrup; but this we

The COMMENTARY.
This syrup of Mugwort first described by Matthaeus, containing a mass of
Medicaments perperously congested, was rightly castigated by Fernelius; who
substracting such things as were not known, inconvenient and supervacancous,
left only such as were usesul, as Plantius well observed: for when it is in
vain to add more, where the thing may be better done by fewer; what need had
we of so much cost and time, in seeking and congesting many Simples, when much
fewer were better? yet, no cost or pains must be spared, when the sanity of a
man lies at the stake; so that the labor be not lost, nor cost frustraneous. A
great and solemn composition, whose bonity many ages have found, and experience
sufficiently proved, must neither admit of mutation nor mutilation; but such as
are described without ground or reason, must be either omitted or castigated.
This syrup is denominated from Mugwort, which is its Basis: its preparation is
clear enough in the description.

Yet it may be more Simply, easily, and as efficaciously made, thus:

seeds of Carret, and Roman-Gith, of each j. Sir. de Artemisia simpliciter.

it into the consistence of a syrup.

and allayes the strangulation and subversion of the Uterus.

Roses, and Diatraganthum frigidum, of each lb ss. coct it to a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
The resumptive syrupes, in a general acception, may be referred to all
analepticall and restorative ones; wherein Medicks adhibit Snails flesh, after
the example of that, whereof Joannes Tornamyra is Author by assent; though I
could neither see it in him, nor any other Antidotariographer in my life: and
that which is now made by Medicks, is made after as many different manners, as
there are different Shops wherein it is made; yea all the descriptions that I
have seen of it, (and they were no few) differ among themselves; some admitting
too many attenuatives; others, too viscid ingredients; others, useless ones;
and others in such a confused form, as if they could scarce be prepared as
described.

All of them require nemoral Snails, which yet, if there be any such, are
worse, as Rubetae amongst Frogs, because their succe is sharper and more
fervid, but less nutritive, and apt to resarciate: therefore I judge the vulgar
more wholesome, which live partly on the water, partly on the land.

And Rondeletius said true, that Snails could not always live without water:
whence these terrestrial Snails, must be such as live in muddy and fenny
places, partly on limpid water, and partly on dry land.

But they must be duly prepared, before they accede the confection of this
syrup; their necks, tails, and members, must be first abscinded, their shells
divided or separated, that all the flesh may be extracted, which must be purged
from all filth, cut into pieces, and cocted together with the Simples
enumerated; and those in such order, as they that require longer coction, may
be sooner injected; those that require shorter, later.

And so it were better to coct the simples severally from the flesh, and the
flesh first, or last, as the Medick will. Sugar and Penidees must be added to
the Colature.

It is good for such as resurge from long diseases, Vires.
or are marcid, tabid, or consumed, or labor under some prave affection of the

according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Doctor Laurentius, the King of France's chief Physician, gives this
description, in a certain learned piece of his, about conservation of the
Sight, Melancholy, Catarrhs, and old Age; and he confesses, that his Kinsman
Castellanus, the King of France's chief Surgeon, was its Author: and it is
thus confected:

The grains of Kermes must be infused a whole night in the depurated succes,
upon hot ashes; the sugar diluted in its strong expression; then all cocted
into a syrup; in whose middle, a little bundle must be suspended, wherein the
powders and Saffron are contained: its dosis may be from one ounce to two
ounces, in the morning before meat, or at night before sleep.

It is cognominated exhilarative, because it has an eximious faculty in
recreating the heart and vitals, erecting the saculties, abigating sorrow, and
tempering the malign quality of melancholy.

This syrup may be substituted, in stead of that that is made of Kermes, in
such parts where the Illex is coccigerous: of which consection we were not
unmindeful; but being easy to make, we omitted it, and left to such, whom
Nature has enriched with its eximious succe.

There are inumerable more descriptions of syrupes in diverse Authors; but some
of them being disapproved of, others scarce proved, we will not onerate, or
rather inquinate our Antidotary therewith. For the acid syrup of Manna, the
syrup of sweet Pomegranates, of Persian Apples, of acid Prunes, of Pears, of
deansed Grapes, of Thyme, and many more, which Mesue describes, are out of use.

I hear of the syrupes of the greater Centaury, of St. John's Wort, of Ivy, of
Tobacco, of Fennel, and some others, not yet proved by use; of which, if the
Famous College at Paris approve, I shall approve also. Myrepsus his syrup,
the syrup of Diasireos, the syrupes of Lilly, of Acorus, of Madder, of
Pennyroyal, of Turbith, of Grapes, of Myrobalambs, and others, which Jacobus
de Manliis, Andernacus, Wekerus, and some of the later rank describe, are now
wholly neglected.

SECT. III. Of Syrupes dulcorated with Honey.
THere rest yet some Syrupes, which we shall describe in this Section, that are
not dulcorated with Sugar, but with Honey, nor made like the rest of the
decoctions of Roots, Leaves, Flowers, Seeds, and Fruits, but only of limpid
and aqueous succes: whereunto, we may well refer that Hydromel, which is
called the vinous Hydromel; for in sapour, faculties and consistence, it
responds to a Syrup.

CHAP. 1. Oxymel, seu Acetum mulsum, etc. Oxymel or sweet Vinegar: Secanjabin
in Arabic.
of the best Honey lb ij. of Fountain Water lb iiij. white wind Vinegar lb j.
boil them together in a fit vessel, to the consistency of a liquid Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
The Honey must first be cocted in water, and despumed; then must the Vinegar
be by little and little adjected; then all cocted together, till they acquire
the consistence of a liquid syrup: But the Ancients have not definitely
described the quantity of Vinegar; for seeing Honey, according to Galen, is
hot, and in hot natures turns soon into bile; so much Vinegar must be added, by
Oribasius his advice, as will correct that bilefying faculty; and so it may be
made into Oxymel, convenient and useful for all ages and sexes: for it is as
sweet, as acid, and as mean, and should be made variously according to the gust
of the assumer, so that it may not hurt: for things very sharp, abrade the
intestines, and hinder expectoration; but that which is moderately acrimonious,
is very useful to the affections of the breast and lungs; for it educes
spittle, and facilitates spiration; for it incides and attenuates crass
humors, expurges the bowels without molestation, and attenuates man's meat.

Its preparation then is various, and the proportion of Honey to Vinegar, and
of Vinegar to water, is various; for though the a queous be better to most, yet
it agrees not to all.

Oribasius would have twice as much Honey, and four times as much water, as
Vinegar; and would have them all cocted to the thirds; which is the same with
that that Mesue gives: whereunto, Serapius assents, though he elsewhere makes
them of equal parts; but that is too sour.

Now the middle betwixt both, may be of one part and a half of Vinegar, to two
of the best Honey, which emits not much spume: for all Honey that emits more
spume, is not so good, but must be cocted, and despumed longer, and so its
greatest part dissipated in coction: for it must be cocted till it effer no
more spume.

Thus the quantity of the Vinegar must be augmented and diminished according to
the will of the user, to whom it is more convenient as he more defires is, and
so it should be made according to every disposition: yet that which is kept in
shops, is usually prepared as Mesue has described; and is made more sweet, or
more sour, as the assumer desires it, and the exigency calls for it.

Oxymel incides, Vires.
attenuates and prepares crass and viscid humors for expurgation, conduces
equally to hot and cold affections, and effects what we have before mentioned.

CHAP. 2. Oxymel Stilliticum; or, Oxymel of Squills.
of Honey despumed lb iij. Vinegar of Squills lb ij. boil them in an earthen
pipkin, to the consistency of a liquid Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
The Medick Marcellus makes it after another manner, by superadding water. For
he takes of Squils lb j. Fountain Water lb iiij. loyl them to a pint and half,
and so let it stand a whole day, close covered; afterward press it out, and to
the expression, add as much Vinegar, with lb iij. of the best Honey; let it be
again gently boiled to a fit consistency.

Mervardus also, and Bern. Dissennius, think it cannot be made without water;
to which opinion, some assent, who mix twice as much water with this, as with
the Simple Oxymel: But Sylvius says this is needless, seeing the Honey is
first cocted and despumed in water, and the Vinegar legitimately prepared with
Scilla, and the Acetum is thus made: one pound of the segments of Scilla,
trajected on a thread, and dried in a shade, is macerated in eight pounds of
White Wind; the mixture is insolated in either a Glass-vessel, or an earthen
one, well glazed, with an angust orifice, by the space of forty days in the hot
Sun; then it is strained; and the segments being ejected, and the Liquorice
preserved, which was of more use heretofore then now.

There are many and various ways of making it; but the description we have
given is most usual, and agrees with that which Paulus Aegineta gives of it.

There are also many ways of making Oxymel Scilliticum; but Democrates,
Julian, and the rest, make it more compound: but these are neglected, and no
where made, therefore omitted by us.

It incides crass humors, Vires.
takes away obstructions caused by crass humors impacted on the lungs, and
cures the Epilepsie, Vertigo, Cephalalgia, and Hemitrania.

CHAP. 3. Oxymel Compositum; or, Compounded Oxymel.
of the roots of Smallage, Fennel, Parsley, Butchers-broom, Asperagrass, of each
ij. the seeds of Smallage and Fen^el, of each j. boil them all in lb xij. of
water: in the clarified Colature, mix of the best Honey lb iiij. white wind
Vinegar lb j. coct it into a liquid Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
The compounded Oxymel, is made like the simple Oxymel Stilliticum; one simple
and usual Vinegar is here substituted in stead of the other. Praepositus makes
a certain compounded aromatical Oxymel, and another potently diuretical, mixing
with the one many Aromata's, with the other Grass-Orris and Radish-roots: but
these may be added when use calls for it, and no other composititious Oxymel
kept in shops.

The quantity of Honey is not determined by Authors, because it is sometimes to
be made more acrimonious, at other times sweeter. But if we should define the
quantity, we would make it in a mean, betwixt acritude and sweetness.

It incides, Vires.
attenuates, and absterges viscid and pituitous humors; frees the liver,
spleen, and bowels from obstructions; expels the sand of the reins and bladder,
and moves urine.

CHAP. 4. Hydromel vinosum simplex; or, Simple vinous Hydromel.
of the best Honey lb x. pluvial or fluvial water lb lx. boil them together,
till an egg will swim at top; then insolate it, and preserve it.

The COMMENTARY.
If this Receipt like not any one, he may take water, and coct it to the
absumption of its third part, accurately absterging and abjecting the spume:
for thus the more dissipable part of the water being vanished, the remnant will
have a consistence like a liquid Syrup; its sapour will be sweet, and the
coction fit for conservation.

Many Medicaments mutuate their basis and appellations from Honey, as Mulsam,
or Mede, Hydromel both aqueous and vinous, Oxymel, and many other Medicinal
Honeys; of the succes of Plants, as Rhodomel; or Honey of Roses, Honey of
Violets, Mercury, Raisins, Rosemary, and Anacardium.

Mede consists only of Water and Honey, mixed in a different proportion; and
that is called dilute Mede, that admits but of little Honey, How to make Mede.
and very much water; For we make Mede, says Oribasi^^, when we mix much water
with Honey, and coct them till they cease to emit spume; for then the spume
must be taken off: But the quantity of Honey must be augmented for pituious
humors, both to alter the peccant humor, and to conciliate a more grateful
gust.

Oribasius was out, when he thought that Mede should be made of Wine and Honey,
and Melicrass of Honey and Water: for they are both one. Though Mesue calls
Melicrass, Oxymel, and gives two descriptions thereof; the one consists of Wine
and Honey; the other, besides these two, admits of many Aromata's; as Cloves,
Cinamome, sweet-Cane, Mace, and the like; which by some (he assenting thereto)
is called a Condite.

But this kind of Potion, which consists of Wine and Honey, is called Oinomel;
Oinomel.
it is sometimes confected of two parts of old Wine, and one of Honey; and
sometimes of five parts of new Wine, and one of Honey: which when cold, is
reposed into Hogs-heads, ( Oribasius C. 25. L. 5. Collectorum.)

Simple and vulgar Hydromel is prepared just as Melicratum; so that they differ
only in name, not in substance: yet Galen says, Melicratum or Mede should be
made of rainwater, and Hydromel of fountain water.

Apomeli is made also after the like manner; for according to Galen, it may be
made of rain or any water, so it be pure, and Honey expressed from the comb;
which must be so long cocted together till spume cease to exurge; which must be
taken off, as soon as it emerges; for so it will depose its acrimony. The
Ancients called it syrup of Honey-combs.

Philagrius gives a better description, to a better Apomelie, thus: Let some
Combs, full of the best Honey, be strongly pressed betwixt ones hands; and let
a portion of the honey expressed, be injected into four times as much pure
water, and let the Honey-Combs be also immerged and washed in the water, that
they may depose all their Honey; then let the water be strained, then cocted
over a luculent fire, and well despumed; let it then be taken off, and
frigefie, and let whatever swims upon, be abjected; then boil it again, and
despume it; which iterate thrice: and when it is at last frigefied and purged
from its excrements, inject this Apomeli into an Earthen or Wooden Vessel.

Aqueous Hydromel is scarce ever preserved in shops, but presently made, when
use calls for it; but the vinous is often confected by the Medicks advice, and
kept in Citizens houses, as some Nectar, more precious then Malmsey: for it
potently cocts frigid humors, moves expectoration, roborates the stomach,
hinders crudities, helps concoction, moves appetite, discusses flatuosity,
mitigates cholical dolours, moves urine, and very much profits cold
constitutions.

The English were wont to make a more composititious vinous Hydromel, which
they called Metegla; Metegla.
which received less of Honey, but more Aromata and Leaven: which is thus
confected.

come, then preserve it in a Wine-Cellar for future use.

This kind of potion is most pleasent; it will often keep two years in sapour
and faculties: it responds to Malmsey.

SECT. IV. Of Succes dulcorated with Honey.
PHarmacopolies preserve some Honeys, made of the infusions of Plants, or of
their succes compounded with Honey, which from their confistence and Honey,
some call Syrupes of Honey; but we rather from their succes, which ingrede
their confecture, and Honey, call them Melleous succes: for whether the
extracted succes of Plants be adjoined to Honey, or the Plants themselves be
macerated in Honey, their succes are always mixed with Honey; whence the whole
mixture is rightly called, A Melleous succe.

CHAP. 1. Mel Rosatum, Lat. Rhodomeli, Graec. Geleniabin, Arab. or, Honey of
Roses.
Red Roses a little dried in the shade lb ij. Honey, neither too old nor too
new lb vj. mingle them, and boil them upon a gentle fire in a Pipkin to a good
consistence, and so preserve it for future use.

The COMMENTARY.
All do not prepare honey of Roses alike; but many, despising the descriptions
of Mesue and Nic. Praepositus, one while make it with fire only, another while
by insolation, another while by both; and sometimes by none of them, but only
by maceration: some inject the whole Roses into the honey; others bray them
first: some use only the succe; others both the succe, and other Roses: the
most usual preparation, is after the manner we have tradited; wherein the
Roses, a little dried, must be macerated in honey, then elixated a little,
afterward exposed to the Sun, and moved every third day, that they may be hot
on every side: Whilst they are thus made, and not strained, they are called,
Honey of Rose-leaves; if they be calified, and strained, as they are usually,
before they be used, they are then called Honey of strained Roses; and
especially that that results from brayed Roses and Honey. That which is made of
two parts of the succe of exungated Roses, and one of Honey, cocted together to
the absumption of the fourth part, whose spume must be diligently extracted in
boiling, is called, The liquid distrained Honey of Roses.

Honey of Roses cohibits hot fluxes, Vires.
whether assumed or applied: it helps, deterges, and roborates the stomach.

CHAP. 2. Mel Violatum; or, Honey of Violets.
of the fresh flowers of Violets lb j. the best Honey lb iij. mingle them in a
convenient vessel with a narrow orifice: insolate it, and keep it for use.

The COMMENTARY.
Some to the confection of this honey, bray the Violets; others mix them whole,
being small flowers, with hot honey, in an carthen glazened pot; then they
expose the pot to the Sun for fifteen days, each other day agitating the
mixture with a rudicle: then they repose it; and when use calls for it, mix it
with a little water, elixate it a little, strain it; and thus they get special
honey of Violets: others do otherwise; and, in Mesue's opinion, it may be made
like honey of Roses well: but the Violets should be a little dried, or at least
deprived of all acquisititious humidity, and the honey should be used neither
too new, nor too old.

Honey of Violets is commended to pectoral affections; it mitigates, absterges,
refrigerates and roborates; and therefore it is usefully mixed with many
Glysters and Gargarisms, and adhibited to deterge Ulcers.

CHAP. 3. Mel Anthosatum; or, Honey of Rosemary.
of the flowers of Rosemary lb j. Honey well despumed lb iij. mingle them in a
Jarre-glass, and set it in the Sun; which after a convenient insolation,
preserve for future use.

The COMMENTARY.
This of Rosemary, is made like them of Violets and Roses. Some commend the
oldest honey, but I like the honey of a middle age, because it is neither too
dilute, nor too crass. This is called Mel Anthosatum, because the flowers of
Rosemary are for their dignity and praecellence called Anthos, or flowers.

And seeing Rosemary flourishes twice in a year, once in the Spring, and once
in Autumn, honey of Rosemary-flowers may also be confected twice annually, at
the aforesaid times, when its flower is fresh and fragrant: for when it is dry,
it is almost inodorate and useless.

It is cephalical and nerval; Vires.
it is a special ingredient in Glysters prescribed to the Lethargy, Apoplexy,
and affections of the head: it corrects the parts distempered by cold with its
calour, and dissipates flatuosity.

CHAP. 4. Mel Mercuriale; or, Honey of Mercury.
of the Juice of Mercury lb iij. the best honey lb iiij. mingle them, and after
elixation, despume them, and so preserve them for use.

The COMMENTARY.
They measure not honey all in the same quantity, some adding more of the
succe, and less of honey; others on the contrary; and many a like weight of
both.

We judge the honey to be more praepotent, when it is made of the succe, and of
leaves or flowers macerated, though its quantity exceed the succes. It is
sometimes made only of the decoction of the leaves; but this way I cannot
approve of.

It may be equally confected of the succe of the Male as the Female Mercury;
for both have affine faculties, and convenient for this confection.

To the male Mercury they refer Dogs Colewort; but this honey may not be
confected thereof: it should be made betwixt the middle of the Spring, and end
of Summer; for then Plants are more succulent, and their qualities more
efficacious.

Honey of Mercury serves scarce to any other use, Vires.
save to ingrede Glysters, to make them more absterfive and purgative.

CHAP. 5. Mel Passulatum; or, Honey of Raisins.
of Raisins purged from the stones lb ij. infuse them 24 hours in lb. vj. of
hot water, either fountain or pluvial; afterward boil them, till half be
consumed; strain it with a strong expression; and to lb iij. of the aforesaid
Colature, add lb ij. of the best honey, which boil up to a liquid Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Some have described two Receipts, the one with, the other without honey; for
it may admit of honey, though its Inventor Matthaeus describes it without the
intervent of honey: Whether way soever it be made, it is very grateful to the
palate, and bechical, and therefore justly ingredes the composition of some
Eclegms.

There are other Medicinal honeys; as, the honey of Myrtle, of Squills, of
Anacardium, and that of Myrobolambs; but they being of rare or no use in
Medicine, are seldom made.

We have omitted the honey of Anacardium, for many causes: First, because the
fruits whereof it is confected, are exotical, and very seldom brought to us:
Secondly, because they are endued with a deletery faculty, or intemperate
excessively: Thirdly, because of the ambiguity of Authors about its
preparation; for some only fervefie the decoction of Anacardia with honey,
till it acquire a just spissitude; others bray them, and macerate them seven
days in Vinegar, then coct them to the half, and afterward coct them with
honey into a Syrup: others only bray and boil the fruits in water till it be
red; collecting the innatant spume like Mellago, which they keep for honey of
Anacardium. Lastly, I would not have honey of Anacardium confected, because its
faculties are either noxious or useless, and inconvenient either to preserve or
resarciate sanity.

SECT. V. Of Rob or Sape, or Robub.
THe succes of Plants are conserved for future uses, either by the admixtion of
something; as Honey or Sugar, in confecting Syrupes; or by some change wrought
in them by Artifice; as Rob, that is, Sape, or cocted Wine; or Robub, that is,
the succe of any Plant incrassated by the beat of the Sun, or of fire. Rob
simply, by a certain Antonomasia, denotes Sape, or sweet new Wine, inspissated
by coction; but in conjunction with another word, it signifies the Sape of that
same, as Rob of Berberries.

CHAP. 1. Rob, seu Sapa; or, Rob, or Sape.
of Wine newly pressed from white Grapes lb xij. boil it upon a gentle fire,
till only four pintes remain, or so long till it attains to the consistency of
honey, which preserve in a convenient vessel.

The COMMENTARY.
Sape is made three ways: for women make Sape of all kinds of Grapes injected
into their Kettles, and cocted without water, and expressed and inspissated
into the consistence of honey; and they call it Resinetum, as if they would
say, Racematum, that is, condited of bunches of Grapes.

Apothecaries also have their way of confecting it, but better; for they take
new Wine, expressed out of white, mature, and selected Grapes, and coct it to
the absumption of two of its parts; the third that remains, has the spissitude
of honey, which is the Pharmacopolists Rob, or Sape; but is now seldom kept,
being now seldom used.

Cooks also have their Sape, made of new sweet Wine, cocted to the consistence
of honey, which they use to sawces: they use also cocted wine, called Defrutum,
which being elixated only to the thirds, and despumed, remains still liquid.

Sape is chiefly commended to the diseases of the Mouth: Vires.
for it does not only astringe, roborate, and cohibit the motion of the fluent
matter; but also absterge and digest it, when delabed. But we have treated of
Sapes more largely in our Institutions ( Cap. 6. Lib. 3.

CHAP. 2. Rob Ribes; or, Rob of Currants.
of the Juice of Red-Currans lb ix. boil it till the third part be consumed;
then let it settle, and when it is clear, pour it off; which boy upon a gentle
fire, to the consistency of Honey.

The COMMENTARY.
This is the simple Sape of Ribes, in reference to the more compound;
whereunto, half as much sugar accedes: but it is most usually confected
according to the prescribed form.

It should be made in June, for then all the Ribes are red ripe, and succulent;
and they then brayed, and expressed, emit much succe.

Rob of Ribes is endued with many qualities; Vires.
for it refrigerates, astringes, roborates, and recreates the heart: therefore
it is very fit to alter a hot distemper, to roborate imbecile parts, to propugn
heart-aches, and help such as vomit: for by its clement astringence, and
delectable acidity, it helps and deligh^^ all parts it attinges.

Rob of Berberries may be made after the same manner; or thus:

CHAP. 3. Rob Berberis; or, Rob of Berberries.
of the Juice of Berberries well strained lb viij. boil it in an earthen Pan,
upon a gentle fire, till it acquires the consistency of honey.

The COMMENTARY.
Rob of Berberry may be very well made after the same manner with Rob of Ribes;
for as the fruits are affine in color, magnitude and faculties; so also are
their succes alike confected.

It refrigerates, astringes, Vires.
quenches thirst either arising from the heat of the ventricle, and other
intrails, or a dry distemper: it helps such as labor under the disease of
Choler, or consumption of the Liver, or the Dysentery, or the frequent
proritation of the Belly.

CHAP. 4. Rob de Cornis; or, Rob of the fruit of the Cornel-tree.
of the Juice of Cornel-berries purged from its settlements lb ix. boil it upon
a gentle fire, till six pintes be consumed; and what remains, repose in a glass
or pot for future use.

The COMMENTARY.
Some add Sugar to it, and make it Gelatina; but it is less efficacious, by
how much more suave: and it is better to make simple Sape, and not to condite
it with Sugar, that its faculties may not be broken, but whole. But seeing we
have many astrictive and refrigerative syrupes, as syrupes of dry Roses,
Quinces, Myrtle, and the like, we seldom use this Rob, which is most commended
for its astrictive faculty; and thence was wont to be prescribed to stay the
Belly-flux, Dysentery, and the Cholick, Choler, and Vomitings.

CHAP. 5. Rob Citoniorum; or, Rob of Quinces.
of the Juice of Quinces clarified lb ix. boil it till two parts of it be
consumed, or so long till it acquires the spissitude of Honey.

The COMMENTARY.
That their succe may be well depurated, it should first be calified; then
resided, that it may be clear; then it should be cocted on a slow fire, for so
it will acquire an idoneous spissitude.

Rob of Quinces is astrictive and roborative: Vires.
whence it stays the liquid Belly, roborates the stomach, conduces to the
choleric disease, retains the Haemorrhoids, and all Belly-fluxes.

The Ancients made their Robub of many other fruits, which they often used; but
the later Age had rather make Syrupes and Conserves thereof.

SECT. VI. Of Conserves.
THe parts of many Plants are condited, for their better conservation and
delightful use; and hence by Pharmacopolists called Conserves: whereof we
purpose briefly (as our Method leads us) to treat in this Section; and he that
knows how to condite the fruits and flowers of any Plant with Honey or Sugar,
or both, he may by the same Art condite the fruits and flowers of all Plants,
except some few, which require longer coction, or else shorter then ordinary.
But every young Artist knows how to intend or remit calour, to give shorter or
longer coction, as the nature of the thing to be condited requires.

CHAP. 1. Conserva Violarum; or, Conserve of Violets.
of the flowers of Violets picked clean, and in a stone-Morter beaten very fine
lb j. of the whitest Sugar lb ij. which beat together, till it becomes a
perfect paste, which preserve in a pot.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue would have the Violets a little dried; but they had better keep their
native humidity: for therein is their virtue posited; which being vanished, the
flowers cannot easily be purged from their cauls and herbaceous parts, but they
will be much diminished: and yet the cleansed flower should be only assumed
for this confection, both that its faculties may be better, and its color more
violaceous.

The Violets should be brayed very small, that no asperity may be found
therein; then twice their quantity of Sugar must be added to them; then they
must be again contunded together, till the mass be soft, and fit to be
conserved in an idoneous vessel. Mesue adds thrice their quantity of Sugar;
and then the Conserve is sweeter, but not so valid.

Conserve of Violets allayes the heat of Choler, Vires.
extinguishes the ardour of other humors, quenches thirst, subduces the Belly,
dilates and levifies the jaws and asper artery, and cures all pectoral
affections.

CHAP. 2. Conserva Rosarum; or, Conserve of Roses.
of red Rose-buds purged from their whites lb j. beat them with a wooden
Pestel, in a stone Mortar, till they become a paste; then add of the best
Sugar lb iij. which beat, with the Roses, till they are perfectly mingled; and
after a little insolation, put it up for future use.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue calls that the Sugar, which we call the Conserve of Roses; and he takes
red, white, and all Roses dried in a shade, without difference, with thrice as
much Sugar, whereof he makes his Sugar of Roses; which after three months
space he exposes to the Sun: we take only red Roses, not dried, but brayed, and
mixed with thrice as much Sugar: some put only twice as much Sugar to it, and
so make the Conserve less suave, but more efficacious.

We call that Sugar of Rose Water, which some call Sugar of Roses, solved in
equal measure, and cocted to the consistence of a solid Electuary: of which in
its place.

But our Conserves of Roses are not always alike; but, some are more liquid
and soft, which are made as we before described them, of new flowers brayed and
mixed with Sugar; others more solid, which are made of the powder of dry Roses,
with eight or ten times as much Sugar, diluted in Rose Water, and cocted to the
consistence of a solid Electuary: wherewithal, a little succe of Sorrel or
Lemmons is mixed, which is made into red paste; out of which, oblong morsels,
small at each end, and crasser in the middle, are formed. The Conserves thus
confected, at Agendicum, a City in the Province of Brya, are much commended.

Conserve of Roses is cephalical and cordial: for, Vires.
it roborates the head and intrails, allayes their heat, and cohibits fluxions.

CHAP. 3. Conserva Buglossi; or, Conserve of Bugloss.
of the picked flowers of Bugloss lb j. beat them in a Marble Mortar very well;
to which, add of the finest Sugar, lb ij. beat them well together: which,
after a convenient insolation, repose in a fit vessel.

The COMMENTARY.
I can scarce assent to their opinion, who would have Buglosses flowers, whose
virtue is superficial, and easily dissipable, dried before triture and mixtion;
for they are better, by how much they are newer, and more humid: but if they
lose their native humidity, they lose their efficacy; for they are no whit more
humid, then exigence requires. Moreover, the more aqueous and excrementitious
part of newly confected Conserve, is dissipated by insolation; but if they be
wet with dew or rain, they should be dried in a shade, rather then in the Sun,
before their confecture.

Conserve of Bugloss exhilarates the vital parts, Vires.
recreates the heart, helps the Melancholical, conduces to such as labor in
the Palsy and Cough.

CHAP. 4. Conserva Borraginis; or, Conserve of Borrage.
of the fresh flowers of Borrage well picked lb ss. of the whitest Sugar lb j.
ss. beat them in a stone-Morter, with a Box-Pestel, till it comes to a perfect
Conserve.

The COMMENTARY.
First the flowers must be brayed by themselves, till they be levigated; then
the Sugar: then must they be mixed in triture, and made into a soft mass, which
reconded in an idoneous vessel, must be insolated, and preserved. The Arabians
call it Zuccarum alchibil, that is, Sugar of Borrages; the later age calls it,
Conserve of Borrage-flowers.

It is given to the same affections with Conserve of Bugloss, Vires.
for both recreate the heart and vital spirits, conduce to melancholical
passions: and this, by a peculiar faculty, moves women's fluors, according to
Holerius.

CHAP. 5. Conserva Nenupharis; or, Conserve of Water Lillies.
of the flowers of Water Lillies purged from their herbaceous parts, and dried
a whole day in the shade lb ss. beat them very well with lb j. ss. of white
Sugar, till they come to a perfect Conserve.

The COMMENTARY.
The flowers of Water Lillies being more crass and humid, may be a little
aerified; then contunded, that they may be levigated; afterward the sugar must
be added, brayed, subacted, and concorporated with the tunded flowers: which
mass well subacted, must be reposed in a potters vessel; white flowers must be
selected, whose herbaceous, green, and flave part also, which is in the middle
of the flower, should be abjected. The luteous Water-Lilly neither ingredes
this Conserve, nor the Syrup before-described, because the white one is
better, and more frequent: they should likewise grow in limpid and clear water;
others are worse.

Conserve of Water-Lilly allayes the heat of the intrails, Vires.
quenches thirst, refrigerates the brain, conciliates sleep, and is good for
such as are severish.

CHAP. 6. Conserva Anthos; or, Conserve of Rosemary-flowers.
of the finest flowers of Rosemary very small beaten lb ss. of the whitest
Sugar lb j. ss. mix them well together, with a Box Pestel, till they become a
fine paste, which keep in a Gally-pot well luted.

The COMMENTARY.
The Rosemary-flower being of it self dry, should not be exposed to the Sun
before triture, nor dried: but this, and all calid and dryer flowers, require
more of sugar, not for their conservation, but more suavity; and they need not
so much insolation.

This Conserve is of much use in Medicine: Vires.
for it is very cephalical and nerval, roborates the brain, and propugns all
its affections: it successfully helps or cures the Epilepsie, Apoplexy,
Lethargy, Palsy, and Trembling.

CHAP. 7. Conserva Betonicae; or, Conserve of Betony.
of the flowers of Betony fresh, and finely picked lb j. white Sugar lb iij.
beat them according to Art into a Conserve.

The COMMENTARY.
All do not make this Conserve after the same manner; for some confect it
according to the form prescribed; others coct Sugar in the water of Betony, to
the consistence of a solid Electuary; then mix it with brayed flowers, and make
a Conserve of most laudable sapour and faculties: it may well be made either
way.

Conserve of Betony, whether assumed or adhibited, Vires.
roborates the head, benefits the ventricle, obtunds poisons, and propugns all
affections of the brain.

CHAP. 8. Conserva Salviae, Melissae, Stoechados; or, Conserve of Sage, Balm,
and Stoechados.
of the flowers of Sage, or Balm, or Stoechados lb ss. white Sugar lb s first
beat the flowers very small, afterward the Sugar, beating them well together,
till it becomes a soft mass.

The COMMENTARY.
The plenty of Medicinal flowers, causes plenty of Conserves; but Stoechados
being very rare, and Balm emitting patulous flowers, few Conserves, if any, are
confected of them: but Sage is so frequent, and endowed with so many eximious
qualities, that a most commendable Conserve, Vires Salviae.
for many uses, is made thereof; for by a special faculty, it roborates the
Brain and Nerves, conduces much to trembling, stupour, palsy, and affections
of the Brain. That which is made of Balm, gently helps the Memory: That which
is made of the flowers called Stoechados, frees the Liver from obstructions,
and recreates the Brain.

Many Pharmacopolists, it may be, have more Conserves condited of flowers, and
many fewer; and if any one be not content with these, he has liberty to make
Conserves of Poeony, Tamarisks, Primrose, and Succory, Some make Conserve of
Mallows flowers, which much conduces to the Stone, and vices in the Reins; for
it leniates, allayes heat, diduces the passages, and expels sand from the
Kidneys.

SECT. VII. Of Fruits and other parts of Plants Condited.
FRuits to be condited, must not undergo triture, like flowers, but are
condited either whole, if small, as Ribes and Berberries; or somewhat greater,
as Cherries; or else cut into slices, as Quinces. Roots also purged and sliced,
are condited: Of all which Conditures we shall briefly dissert in this Section.

CHAP. 3. Cerasa condita; or, Condited Cherries.
of Cherries ripe, and purged from their pedicles lb ij. white Sugar lb j. boil
them first upon a clear, then upon a gentle fire (casting off the scum as it
arises) till their Juice and the Sugar becomes a perfect Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
There are many kinds of Cherries, whereof those only are selected for
conditure, which are very red, dulcoacid, very succulent, and inhaere upon a
short pedicle; as also, such as are obscurely red. Now that they may be rightly
condited, a little water must be put to them, for so the Sugar will more easily
liquefie, and the Cherries be sooner cocted. Now they are perfectly cocted,
when a drop of their Syrup effunded upon a Marble, diffuses not; and then they
should be removed from the fire; and when they grow cold, be reposed in
idoneous vessels for preservation.

Condite Cherries, because of their suavity and salubrity, Vires.
are exhibited to the sick of any disease, and at any time.

CHAP. 2. Ribes and Berberis condita; or, Condited Ribes and Berberries.
of red Currants, or Berberries lb j. ss. Sugar lb j. boil them according to Art
with a little water, till their humidity have acquired the consistency of a
Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Of the succe of these fruits, inspissated by heat, we have a Sape; of the
same, and sugar duly cocted, a Syrup also: Both which are eximious, in
restoring sanity to the diseased, as we have above hinted. These same fruits
are also used for Junkets; and to that end integrally condited, that they may
be kept while winter, and exhibited to the diseased, to whom they are not only
pleasant, but conducible. They usually mix some water to their conditure; but
their own succe would do better in its stead: for so the conditure would be
more acid, and sweet also, if an equal weight of fruits and sugar were
conjoined.

CHAP. 3. Pyra condita; or, Condited Pears.
of Pears decocticated, and of the whitest Sugar, of each lb ij. boil them upon
a gentle fire, till the Pears become soft, and the liquor of the consistency of
a Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
Other Pears may be so condited, as those they call Rousselets, and others
whose flesh is solid. Some stick them with Cloves, that they may be more
grateful to the palate: for so they attain an aromatical odor and sapour with
sweetness. Apples having a sorter substance, which by coction would be like a
Pultess, are not condited whole, but cut into slices; and artificially cocted
with Sugar, are made into a certain Paste, which sected into morsels, is
studiously dried and kept.

CHAP. 4. Nuces condita; or, Condited Nuts.
of Nuts both young and green, n.l. purged from their outward Cortex, infuse
them nine or ten days in warm water daily changed; then boil them, till they
grow soft, which spread one by one upon a cloth that they may dry, aromatize
them with Cloves and Cinnamon, and afterward with an equal quantity of Sugar,
to the weight of the Nuts, boiling them gently (adding thereunto a little
water) to a just consistence.

The COMMENTARY.
Many care not for condite Nuts, because they grow black: which ungrateful
color, that it may be hindered, let the Nuts be first cocted, then sticked with
Aromata, and reconded in a vessel; upon which superfuse Syrup perfectly
cocted, while it is hot: if on the following days the Syrup grow crude again,
coct it again, and superfuse it; and if yet it appear too fluid, recoct it,
that it may acquire a legitimate consistence, for so the condite Nuts will be
whiter. They roborate the ventricle, Vires.
disspate flatuosity, cure the cholick, and help coction.

CHAP. 5. Pruna condita; or, Condited Plums.
of Plums not perfectly ripe, of Loaf-sugar, of each lb j. clear water lb ss.
boil them, till the liquor becomes a perfect Syrup.

The COMMENTARY.
There is everywhere great plenty and variety of Plums, whereof Damascens,
white, black, red, and violaceous ones, are very expetible: but most of all,
the Imperial Plums; which, when mature, are most grateful.

And these also, like other fruits, are condited for better preservation: and
first they are decorticated, and presently cast into water, lest they should
grow flave or black; and then they are cocted, till the syrup of their succe,
mixed with sugar, be of a legitimate consistence.

Thus may Peaches and ripe Apples be condited.

The Pills of Oranges and Lemmons, partly because of their hardness, and partly
of their insuavity, are once or twice macerated in warm water before conditure;
into which water at the first time, some inject a little bundle of ashes; at
the second time, they are cocted in simple water, with an equal weight of
sugar, and so conserved in their syrup perfectly cocted.

But for such as delight only in dry confectures, they may be thus made: The
Pills thus condited, must be taken; their syrup wherewith they are madid,
either gently deterged with a cloth, or lightly washed off with water. The
Pills thus wiped and exsiccated, must be immerged in other sugar, cocted to the
consistence of a solid Electuary, and again cocted therein a little; then
amoved, and exsiccated in the sun, Hypocauste, or other hot place, and then
kept. But this curious Art of conditing Fruits, appertains rather to
Confectioners then Apothecaries.

CHAP. 6. Citonia condita; or, Condited Quinces.
of Quinces decorticated, cut in five or six parts, purged from their membranes
and seeds, n.x. or xij. of Sugar the like weight: boil them with a little water
according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Quinces, because of their solidity, endure much coction; and therefore they
require more water. They should be cocted, not only till they be soft, but
till their Syrup be crasser; wherein they must be kept whole, and not
discepted, nor reducted to a Pultess.

Quinces may be condited another way; to wit, cocted with Sugar: and in cocting
agitated, that they may acquire the consistence of a Pultess; and then they
must be removed, and reposed in ligneous Boxes: if the weight of these Quinces
and Sugar be equal, the conditure will be more s^ave, but less astrictive.

There is yet another conditure more red and lucid, made only of the decoction
of the Pills and seeds of Quinces, with an equal weight of Sugar, cocted to the
consistence of a Syrup, and kept in Boxes of Pine-wood: if in cocting, the
vessel be shut and covered which contains them, the conditure will be more red;
which color is most expetible in all conditures of Quinces. Some add the
s^^ce of Quinces thereto, and call it clear Cidoniat.

There is also a Conserve made of Quinces, but after another manner: for their
succe is elicited, cocted and strained, and twice as much sugar added to the
colature, and cocted to the consistence of an Electuary; the succe is in equal
weight mixed with sugar, and so the Conserve made of a red color, grateful
sapour, and eximious faculties.

The Conditure of Leaves. CHAP. 7. Folia Adianti condita; or, The condite
Leaves of Venus-hair.
of white Maidenhair picked from its stalks lb j. good Sugar lb ij. beat them
severally, afterward together, till they become a perfect Conserve.

The COMMENTARY.
Leaves are seldom condited, seeing, when dry, we can take their decoctions,
and make Syrupes of them, endued with their faculties; or keep them dry, some
for a whole year without damage: yet some are so volatile, that they scarce
retain any thing of their genuine quality when dried; as true Maidens-hair,
which for its eximious faculties, is sought by exotical Merchants, and carried
in form of a Conserve, made as before; after which manner, other dry leaves may
be condited: but humid ones thus:

CHAP. 8. Folia Tussilaginis condita; or, The condite Leaves of Collsfoot.
of the Juice of the leaves of Coltsfoot lb j. Sugar lb ij. boil then to the
consistency of an Electuary; to which, whilst hot, add of green Coltsfoot
finely beaten, as much as you see good, and make thereof a Conserve.

The COMMENTARY.
In the confecture of this Conserve, the quantity of the leaves to be brayed,
is not defined; some taking more, others less; a third part, or at most half as
much sugar, is enough. But Conserves thus made, should be long insolated, and
frequently agitated with a Rudicle, that they may califie all over, and their
aqueous humidity be quite dissipated, wherewith they abound. The conditures of
other leaves may be thus confected.

The conditure of these leaves help the Cough, Vires.
Lungs, and hinder the frequent delapse of humors from the Brain, to the
breast and vitals.

The Conditure of Stalks. CHAP. 9. Caules Lactucae conditae; or, The condite
Stalks of Lettices.
of the stalks of Lettices purged from the exterior skin or cortex lb j. Boil
them in water till they wax soft; afterward dry them upon a cloth; then take
the like weight of Sugar, and with a sufficient quantity of water, boil them,
till the liquor become a crass Syrup: which repose in a sit vessel.

If you desire them of a dryer form, let them be wiped and dried; and then in
Sugar boiled to the height of an Electuary, let them a little fervesie;
afterward taken out and dried.

The COMMENTARY.
Very few Plants Cauls are condited, either because of their hardness, or
insuavity, or other useless qualities: But such as have crassitude, sweetness,
tenerity, and excellency of faculties, may rightly be condited; as the cauls of
Lettice and Artichock: Of both which cauls, Confectioners used to make dry
confectures, after the manner prescribed.

They quench thirst, allay the heat of the stomach and liver. Vires.


CHAP. 10. Caules Cynarae conditi; or, The condited Stalks of Artichocks.
of the stalks of Artichocks, the exterior pellicle taken off, and purged from
its fibers lb j. boil them in water, till they grow soft; afterward let them
be dried upon a cloth; then with the like weight of Sugar, and a sufficient
quantity of water, boiled to the body of a crass Syrup: repose the confecture
in a fit vessel; which if required more dry, prepare them as afore-described.

The COMMENTARY.
The white stalks of Artichocks should be desumed, before they erupt out of the
earth: they are used all winter in Paris, where they much abound; which some,
upon no grounds, use, to stimulate Venery: for they afford little of genital
matter, or flatulent spirits to the body, but much Melancholical succe.

The cauls of the vulgar, not of the Spanish Artichock, should be selected, for
that is a kind of Carduus; as both of them seem to be depromed from that
stock; only one of them has by culture attained a more fair aspect, and
gracious sapour.

They are more celebrated for Junkets for the whole, then Diet for the sick.

Condited Roots. CHAP. 11. Radix Poeoniae condita; or, The condited Root of
Poeony.
of the Roots of Poeony washed and purged lb ij. boil them in water, till they
grow soft; then repose them to dry in a shade, that their humidity may be
evaporated: then boil them again with the like weight of Sugar, with a little
portion of the aforesaid decoction, to the body of an Electuary; which take
from the fire, and repose in a vessel for use.

The COMMENTARY.
Some Roots should be condited only in the Spring, before their succe be
immitted into their branches, boughs and leaves; others in Autumn, when Plants
demit their leaves; for then much of the Plants virtue goes into the Roots, and
then the humor is more thoroughly cocted, then at other times: others may be
condited, both in the Spring, Summer, and Autumn, being always succulent,
whose cauls are either not erupted, or grown up, or else dried: They must then
be collected in that feason, wherein their virtue is most prealent; as the
Roots of Ragwort and Rainbow in the Spring; the Root of Poeony in August,
according to Sylvius, or rather in March; the Roots of Enula, Bryony, and
Maidens-grass, in Autumn: as we have showed at large in our Institutions ( Cap.
13. Lib. 1.)

Some of them are amare, sharp, and insuave; which before their conditure,
should be often macerated in water: others are grateful; which being one day
infused in warm water, may in the same or another be cocted forthwith; as the
Roots of Poeony, which may be we^ condited, according to this prescribed form;
or some other of the like sort when they are cocted, and the Sugar cocted like
a soft Electuary affunded upon them: if they become crude, the liquor must be
again cocted, and that again repeated, till they cease from their crudity.

These condited, are of great potency to arceate and cure the Epilepsie, if
they be moderately taken in the morning fasting, and at the hour of sleep.

CHAP. 12. Radices Eryngiorum conditae; or, The condited Roots of S^^-holly.
of the Roots of Sea-holly cut sloping, and purged from its inward pith lb j.
boil them in water, till they become soft: dry them in a shade: Sic Radices
Buglossi condiuntur.
then let Sugar be dissolved in the same decoction, and boiled to the
spissitude of an Electuary: to which add the Roots, and again gently cocted,
that their aqueous humidity may be dissipated (...) epose them afterward (...)
Gally pot, and preserved.

The COMMENTARY.
The Roots of Sea-holly being sweet, needs undergo but one materation before
conditure; and then be cocted in the same water, ^ill they be soft; then
condited with Sugar, as the form shows. Mesue adds some Aromata's, as Cinnamon,
and Ginger, wherewith be would have the Roots stuck; and he boyls them with a
portion of Honey and Sugar; or else Honey only, thrice the quantity of the
Roots. But the form I have exhibited, is more usual, and better.

We everywhere in the Aarabian writings, meet with Secacul, which is hitherto
taken for Sea-holly: But its description given by Avicenna and Serapio, show,
that it is another Plant, dissimilar in face, if not faculties: It grows in
India; and is there condited, and is kept, and given for venereous matters; as
also our Sea-holly, which some do perperously call Secacul, though their
virtues be af^^^e; for both of them are ^or and moist, in the end of the first,
and beginning of the second degree: They move Venery.

Therefore they do right, who for defect of the Indian Secacul, substiture our
Sea-holly: and let such cease to be angry at this substitution, who must have
something of that nature, and cannot get the true Secacul.

Sea-holly is of the kind of aculeated Plants, whose leaves are tender, not
spinous and rigid, and fit for cibaries. Dioscorides says, they are broad
asperated about their ambient, aromatical to the gust, and when perfectly grown
aculeated with many horrid spines. Its heads also are circumvalled with aoute
spines; its roots long, black without white within, tender, sweet, and grateful
to the gust. It is more largely described in our first Book of Medicinal Matter.

Its Root condited, no^^shes, augments seed, Vires.
excites venery moves urine, and expels the sand of the Reins and Bladder.

CHAP. 13. Radices Symphiti condita; or, The condite Roots of Comfrey.
of the roots of the greater Comfrer slieed lb j. macerate and boil them in a
sufficent quantity of water, till they become soft; dry them in a shade for a
whole day: Let them Sugar be put to the decoction, and boiled to the (...)
situde of an Electuary; to which add the roots, and again let them be boiled,
till the aqueous superfluity be evaporated; and when they begin to be condited,
repose them in a vessel for use.

The COMMENTARY.
The roots of Comfrey, as also many other, which by cocture become easily soft,
are rightly condited after this prescript: yet some had rather prepare and
condite them thus; First they coct the washed and cleansed roots; then they
bray them; then they transmit th^^ through a fieve; then put twice their
quantity of Sugar to them, and coct them to the consistence of an Electuary;
then they recalifie them, and recond the conditure in Boxes. And thus they do
with all other crasser roots: for th^^ they may be better p^rged from their
fibers, and more perfectly confected in every part.

They stay the running of blood from any part, Vires.
cohibit the delapse of homours, and agglutinate wounds in the internals.

CHAP. 14. Radices En^^^ conditae; or, The condited roots of En^^a-campane.
of the roots of En^^a-campane washed, purged and sliced lb ij. infuse them in
warm water for the space of four days, the water being daily changed; then
boil them, till they grow tender; then dry them in a shade: afterward take the
like weight of S^gar, which dissolve in the aforesaid decoction, and boil it up
to the consistency of an Electuary; then add the aforesaid roots, and coct
them together gently: which afterward repose in boxes.

The COMMENTARY.
The roots of Enula must be macerated more or less, as their insuavity
requires: and if it may be emended by two or three macerations, they need no
longer immersion, lest their whole virtue be deposed in the water.

They roborate the stomach, Viret.
recreate the heart, discuss fla^^lenty, help concoction, resist poisons, and
pesti^ent vi^ul^^^ diseases.

CHAP. 15. Radices Satyrii conditae; or, The condite roots of Satyrion.
of Satyrion roots washed and picked lb j. boil them in water, till they become
tender; then let them be dried in the shade, covering them with a cloth: when
they are dried, ningle them with the like preportion of Sugar, dissolved in the
abovesaid decoction, and ^oyled to a good consistence; which coct a little,
that the humidity of the water may be dissipated.

The COMMENTARY.
The whole roots of Satyrion should be condited: for their mole hinders not,
but that sugar may pervade their whole substance. We have adjoined no
Aromata's, that they may be more safely exhibited to such as labor under
Hectic Fevers: they are endued with like faculties with Diasatyrium, but more
imbecilely, as we shall show in its due place.

Many other roots are condited after the same manner with these; which for
brevities sake I omit. We have no fresh Ginger, but it comes all condited to us
from Bengala, a country in India.

SECT. VIII. Of Eclegms that must be preserved in Pharmacopolies.
EClegms do by good right challenge place amongst the Preparative Medicaments;
for they prepare the humors contained in the breast for expulsion, by vomit,
or impact them into another place for eduction, by stool. For seeing they are
either acid, or sweet, they incide viscid humors, and make them easy to be
separated from the parts whereunto they adhere. The sweet ones concoct the
same, and make them sit for exclusion by spittle: If they be of a mixed sapour,
and dulcoacid, they both attenuate and concoct: But th^se that the Ancients
kept in their Shops, are now almost out of use. And now when some prave
affection of the highest region of the Breast, or Asper Artery, requires a
Lohoch or Eclegm, they are quickly made for present use, being both for virtue
and sapour at the best. So that the Ancients Eclegms, as they are less
grateful, so they seem to be less useful. Yet lest our Shop should be quite
void of them, we shall select a few, of more easy confecture and particular
use: As,

CHAP. 1. Eclegma Scilliticum; or, Eclegm of Squills. D. Mes.
of the Juice of Squills, Honey despumed, of each lb ij. boil them together
according to Art, to the consistency of Honey.

The COMMENTARY.
This Eclegm is most easy to confect, and most simple, consisting only of the
same things, that make up Honey of Squills; only they differ in preparation
and proportion: For in Honey of Squills, the leaves are confusedly insolated
with the Honey in a fit vessel, and strained when use calls for it: But in the
Eclegm of Squills, only their succe is cocted with Honey, above the
consistence of a Syrup.

Eclegms of Squills potently incide and prepare for expulsion, Vires.
crass and viscid humors, impacted in the spirators. They very much help such
as breath with difficulty, or have much of viscid Phlegm in their Lungs, or
highest region of the Breast.

CHAP. 2. Eclegma de Caulibus; or, Eclegm of Colewort. D. Gord.
of the Juice of Coleworts lb j. boil it a little, and scum it; afterward add
Saffron iij. Sugar and Honey, of each lb ss. boil them according to Art, to the
consistence of a Linctus.

The COMMENTARY.
The succe of Garden-Cauls must first be educed, then depurated by the Sun or
fire; then Honey or Sugar added to it, and they perfectly cocted; then must
well-pulverated Saffron be mixed therewith; or, as Gordi^nus, its Author would
have it, injected therein (...), while cocting, because he will have it tend to
its spissitude: but it is credible, he means by his Electuary, a Lohoch, for
the cure of difficulty of breathing. But the leaves of red Cauls should be
selected, when the diseases of the highest part of the Breast are respected, or
the Belly to be moved.

Lonoch of cauls cures difficulty of breathing, Vires.
inveterate coughs; cocts, moves, and excludes spittle.

CHAP. 3. Eclegma de Pulmone Vulpis; or, Eclegm of Foxes Lungs. D. Mes.
of Fox Lungs prepared and dried, of the Juice of Liquorice, white Maidenhair,
sweet Fennel-seeds, Anise-seeds, of each equal parts: make it into a Lohoch,
with Syrup of Red-roses or Myrtles.

The COMMENTARY.
Some confect it with simple Hydrosa charum, that is, water and sugar; others
with sugar solved, and cocted in Saxifrage water; and some that would have it
more roborative, with Rob, or inspissated succe of Myrtle, as Mesue advises. We
confect it with syrup of Roses, or Alexanders syrup; for so it is more
grateful, then those with Rob of Myrtle, and Hydrosacharum: yea, its faculty
roborates in a mean betwixt them.

But if it be kept for a Roborative, it may be rightly confected with syrup of
Myrtle: but Pharmacopolists do not now preserve it.

Foxes Lungs should, if possible, be only taken by such as are young, sound,
and given to hunting: they must be washed in water, incided, according to the
vessels whereto they adhere, and wherein they are suspended; their blood must
be expressed; then moderately washed in white wind, imposed in a pot, dried in
an Oven pretty hot, and kept.

When use calls for them, a portion of them must be levigated very small, and
mixed with some idoneous liquor, as in this Eclegm, with the said Syrup, and
other pulverated Medicaments.

Mesue describes this Lonoch of Foxes Lungs to difficult breathers; Vires.
but some would rather bray the Lung, and exhibit it mixed with Julep of Roses;
others, upon good grounds, prefer the Lungs of other wholesome Animals, as
Hogs, Rams, or Calves Lungs, for the easure of such as are troubled with
difficulty of breathing: for the diseased may eat these with more delight and
salubrity, to the quantity of two or more ounces; and so better consult the
sanity of his Lungs, then if he uses an ounce of this Eclegm, wherein there is
scarce a scruple of Foxes Lungs. Yet this should be kept in Pharmacopolies,
because it is very bechical, and may be successfully used by such as are tabid.

CHAP. 4. Eclegma sanum and expertum; or, A sound and experienced Lohoch. D.
Mes.
of Raisins stoned, Figs, Dates, of each n. xij. Jujubees, Sebestens, of each
xxx. Foenugreek-seed v. Linseed, Anise-seed, sweet Fennel-seed, dried Hyssop,
Calamint, the roots of Orris, Liquorice, Cinnamon, of each ss. Maidenhair m.j.
boil them all in four pintes of water, till half be consumed: to the Calature,
add Penidees lb ij. boil it again to the crassitude of Honey; then add these
following powders, and pastes, Pine-kernels v. blanched Almonds, Starch, of
each iij. Liquorice, Gumme-Thraganth, Arabic, of each ij. ss. Orris ss. Let
all these be exactly mingled, and beaten into a Lohoch.

The COMMENTARY.
That this Eclegm may be well confected, the root of Orris should be cut into
short pieces, and be first cocted in limpid water by half a quarter of an hour;
then must the seeds be injected; then the fruits and leaves; last the Liquorice
and Cinnamon: the powders being levigated, a part must be confusedly mixed, and
conjected into the colature, duly cocted with Penidees; that of these united
and agitated with a Pestel, may arise an Eclegm, which from its effect is
called Sound and Expert: for it contains many fruits, seeds, leaves, and some
gummes, which commonstrate its eximious faculties; whereunto they add Amylum,
to make it more viscid.

Now Amylum may be made of many cereals; but the best is that, that is made of
Wheat five times madefied with water, till it be soft: which done, the water is
effused without agitation, lest something that is useful, flow out with it:
when it is very soft, and the water effused, it should be calcated with ones
feet, and so broken; then should water be again superfused upon it, and it
again calcated, and the enatant bran received into a sieve, and the rest dried
in a Basket, and forthwith baked in the sun, and kept. For thus it is grinded
without a Mill, and thence called Amylum. It leniates exasperated parts, stays
the fluxions of the eyes, and rejections of Blood.

This Eclegm cures the cough, Vires.
and hoarseness contracted by a cold distemper: it incides, attenuates, and
deterges much, and concocts cold humors.

CHAP. 5. Eclegma de Pineis; or, Eclegm of Pine-kernels. D. Mes.
of Pine-kernels cleansed from their skins xxx. sweet Almonds, Hazel-Nuts,
Gumme-Thraganth, Arabic, Liquorice, Juice of Liquorice, white Starch, white
Maidenhair, Orris-root, of each ss. the Pulp of Dates xxxv. bitter Almonds,
Honey of Raisins, fresh Butter, white Sugar, of each iiij. Honey, as much as
will suffice to make it up according to Art into an Eclegm.

The COMMENTARY.
That this Eclegm may be rightly made, the dry roots must first be brayed
apart; then the Maidens-hair, then the fruits, then the gummes and Amylum: but
such as may better be incided, as Almonds and Filberts, may be cut with a
knife. When all are well levigated, Rob or Honey of Raisins must be added; then
butter; then an idoneous quantity of the whitest and best Honey, that the
Eclegm may be of a legitimate consistence.

It cures inveterate coughs, Vires.
difficulty of breathing; moves viscid spittle: helps the asperity of the
voice, helps coction and expectoration of humors, and cures such affections of
the Lungs and Breast, as arise from the plenty or noxious quality of humors.

Finis Libri Primi.
The Apothecaries Shop, OR, ANTIDOTARY. THE SECOND BOOK. Of most selected and
approved Purgative Medicaments.
THE PREFACE.
THe multitude of Compounded Purgatives are almost innumerable, their forms
multifarious, and their preparations various. We shall here exhibit the most
select, best, and approved; and those either in form of a liquid or solid
Electuary, as Opiates or Hierae; or in form of Pills and Trochisks: For
Pharmacopolists seldom keep Purgatives in form of Powders or Potions. We shall
add the manner and reason of their confecting, and the quality of the
Confection: But we shall withal omit many Purges described by the Ancients,
because their use is not salubre, nor a due order observed in their
Composition, as admitting of many noxious, useless, and unknown Medicaments. We
shall also neglect many described and invented by late men; who, being covetous
of vainglory, cognominated some after their own Titles, and from a fictitious
effect. We shall (I say) relinquish such, and give only the more select,
approved, and useful. We dissect this Treatise into four Sections: In the first
whereof we speak of liquid Electuaries; in the third, of solid ones; in the
fourth, of Pills; and in the second, of bitter Confections, which Medicks call
Hierae.

CHAP. 1. Diacassia. D. N. Praepos.
of the flowers and leaves of Violets, Mallows, Beets, Pellitory, Roman
Wormwood, of each m. ss. boil in lb iiij. of water, till half be consumed: to
the Colature add of Honey lb j. boil it to the consistence of a liquid
Electuary; then mingle with it Gassia lb j. and so make it into an Electuary,
and repose it in a fit vessel.

The COMMENTARY.
All do not make Diacassia alike: for some coct the succes of Plants with
honeys to a fit crassitude, and then adject the Cassia; others elixate the
Plants, and in the colature dilute Cassia and Honey; and then fervefie the
whole mixture, to the consistence of a liquid Electuary. But that manner
wherein the Cassia is so long cocted, is disapproveable; but the other, whereby
the Canes wherein the Cassia is contained, are washed in the strained
decoction, and afterward a pound of honey added, and they cocted to a
legitimate spissitude, that by the adjection of a pound of Cassia, they may
become an Electuary, is very good.

Some, in stead of honey, mix sugar therewith; others, both: some add Manna;
others, Senny; others, other Medicaments: and so confect various Electuaries of
Cassia, whereunto I assent not. For it is enough, that we have Diacassia made
according to the prescript for Glysters; and if the pith of Cassia must be
assumed at the mouth, it may be extracted fresh, and taken alone, or mixed with
other Medicaments, as the Medick requires.

But Egyptian or Oriental Cassia should be selected, which is without redly
black, and within full of a fat, medullous, and black matter; which is of force
to contemperate heat, wash the Belly, and gently purge the Body; and may thence
be securely given to Boys, Old-men, and pregnant Women: for it subduces the
Belly without molestation; but it is thought procurative of flatulency, and
therefore many educe its pith in the vapor of cocted Anise or Fennel; others
mix some Cinnamon with it: and Coraeus gives it with some grains of Berberries,
to such as have weak Intestines.

I hear of a new kind of Cassia brought from Brasile; a half ounce whereof
does more move the Belly, and copiously educe humors, then a whole ounce of
the vulgar and oriental.

Diacassia is a benign Medicament, and purges clemently: it allayes the heat of
the Mesentery, gently moves the Belly, humectates its siccity, and by
lubrication and detersion, deposes the excrements by stool.

CHAP. 2. Electuarium lenitivum; or, The lenitive Electuary.
of Polypody of the Oak, Senny picked, Raisins stoned, of each ij. Mercury
m.j.ss. Barley, Maidenhair, Violets, of each m.ss. Jujubees, Sebestens, of
each number. xx. Prunes stoned, Tamarinds, of each vj. Liquorice ss. boil them in
a sufficient quantity of water, till a third part be consumed: to the Colature,
add Pulp of Cassia-Fistula, Tamarinds, Prunes, Loaf-sugar, and Sugar of
Violets, of each vj. Senny powdered iij. ss. make it into an Electuary according
to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
The Raisins which ingrede this confection, should be purged from their stones:
if white Adiantum, or true Maidens-hair cannot be had, Polytrichum may be
substituted in its stead. Conserve of Violets, or Sugar of Violets, may be
mixed at pleasure. He that judges Conserves inept in Electuaries, may add
Anise or sweet Fennel-seed, or a little Cinnamon: yet this Electuary has
hitherto been confected without any of them, and the users have not found any
molestation from flatulency.

The fruits whose pulps must be educed, must be humectated in a part of the
prepared decoction; another part thereof with sugar must be made into a Syrup,
and the pulps with sugar of Violets, mixed with it while hot: then must an
ounce and an half, or at least an ounce and three dragms of well-levigated
Senny, be added to every pound of the Composition; whereof they say Rhasis is
Author.

This lenitive Electuary, thus cognominated from its effect, Vires.
levifies, mollifies, and subduces the Belly; educes all obvious, but
especially pituitous and melancholical humors, without molestation: it helps
against the Pleurisy, and other pectoral affections.

The Florentine Medicks describe another, by the name of the Magisterial
Electuary; which admits of Turpentine, Ginger, and Scammony; which our Shop may
well be without.

CHAP. 3. Electuarium Catholicum; or, The Catholical Electuary.
of Polypody of the Oak well bruised lb j. pure water lb ix. boil them
together, till a third part be consumed; and in two parts of the decocoction,
let there be boiled Sugar lb viij. to which add pulp of Cassia and Tamarinds,
madefied with the other part of the decoction, of the leaves of Senny, of each
viij. of the best Rhabarb, Polypody, sweet Fennel-seeds, Violets, of each iiij.
of the four greater cool seeds, of each j. Liquorice, Penidees, Sugar Candy, of
each ss. make into an Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
That this universal Antidote may be duly confected, many things must be
brayed, and prepared apart; and first of all, Polypody, which being twice
assumed, must be bifariously prepared. In the first course it must be brayed
only pretty grossly; in the second, it must be levigated very small: that which
is only contunded, must be long cocted in the prescribed, or sufficient
quantity of water; and a Syrup must be made of two parts of its colature and
sugar.

The Tamarinds and Cassia must be humectated with the rest, that their pulps
may be more easily separated and secerned.

The Rhabarb must be brayed alone; the Senny, Liquorice, Fennel, and Violets,
both alone and together; twice as much of the Syrup of Violets, may be mixed
in stead of the Violets: the four cold seeds must be excorticated, and minutely
cut with a Penknife; then must the Penidia and Sugar be pulverated; then must
all be put together, and agitated with a ligneous Pestel or Rudicle, till they
become an Electuary of a legitimate consistence.

And the composition of this solemn Medicament is not only various, but there
are also various opinions concerning its Author: for Sylvius seems to ascribe
the invention thereof to Galen; Joubertus, to Nicolaus Myrepsicus; Bauderonius,
to Nicolaus Salernitanus; Adolphus Occon, to Nicolaus Praepositus; Valor.
Cordus, to Nicolaus Alexandrinus; who indeed has described it, but not as it
is vulgarly made.

But none know certainly, to which of these to attribute its invention: but all
call it Nicolaus his Catholicum, not adding his Surname.

Now this Medicament is called Catholical, or Universal, either because it
expurges all humors, or because it draws them from all parts of the Body.

That which is made according to this prescript, is called Simple Catholicum,
in reference to the more compound; which receives twice as much Rhabarb and
Senny; yet neither of them substantially, or in powder, ingrede that same, as
they do this simple Catholicum: but the Senny is cocted, and the Rhabarb
infused, and its expression joined with the mixture; which formed into an
Electuary, is called Catholicum Duplicatum.

Many coct Anise and Fennel, and others Coriander-seed, with Polypody, to
discuss its flatuosity: but there is Fennel enough in the description, to
effect this; so that there is no need to congest so many Medicaments of the
same faculty together. If any like not Anise, he may in its stead substitute
sweet Fennel or Coriander, or an equal weight of each: yea, any may add some
Cinnamon, to make it more grateful, and it will be of good consequence. The rest
I leave to the old description, which most Medicks approve of, and prefer
before many purges: which to pervert, as Rondeletius has done, were a piece of
a piacle.

Some keep a certain Catholicum in their shops for Glysters, different from the
common one, only in this, that it admits of only old and worse Rhabarb, and
is confected with Honey in stead of Sugar.

That which is very purgative, wherein Apothecaries put Turpentine,
Coloquintida, and Hermodactyls, is not good.

I hear of some that make a more liquid Catholicon, only of Syrup, and the
infusion of some pulps: but its faculties being very imbecile, and not
respondent to the scope of the Author, whoever first made it, I think it is not
now kept or prepared.

Fernelius gives more descriptions of Catholicum: one whereof, amongst other
things, receives Hellecampane, Hyssop, Ginger, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, and Honey;
another amongst Purgatives, Agarick, Turpentine, and Diacridium: which
compositions, made by a perite artificer, are good; but they are seldom kept
in shops.

Let that then which we have, according to the Ancients mind here described,
be continually kept for the true Catholicum in each Pharmacopoly.

It clemently and gently purges all humors, cures Fevers, Vires.
and acute diseases, especially such as proceed from the prave disposition of
the Spleen and Liver.

CHAP. 4. Diaprunum, seu Diadamascenum simplex; or, Simple Diaprunum, or
Diadamascenum. D.N.Myr.
of fresh and ripe Damask-Prunes, n. 100. boil them in a sufficient quantity of
water, till they grow soft; then let them be pulped through a hair-sieve: In
the percolated Colature, boil the flowers of Violets j. In the Colature,
dissolve Sugar lb ij. boil them into a Syrup; to which add the pulp of the
aforesaid Prunes, inspissated by it self lb j. of the pith of Cassia and
Tamarinds, of each j. then sprinkle in these following Powders; viz. White
Sanders, red Sanders, Rhabarb, of each iij. Roses, Violets, the seeds of
Purslain, Endive, Berberries, Juice of Liquorice, Thraganth, of each ij. of the
four greater cool seeds, of each j. make it into an Electuary according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
The description of this Electuary, shows the manner of its confection, which
indeed is the best: though some make it otherwise, who wash and elixate not
only the pulps of Plums and Tamarinds, but of Cassia also, to the consistence
of Honey with a Syrup: whereunto they afterward add the Powders, that,
together with its desired faculty, it may acquire its legitimate consistence.

But all agree not about the quantity of Violets: for some, according to Nic.
Myrepsus his decree, take only half an ounce, others an ounce and a half: we,
aiming at the mean, take one ounce, to be a little cocted in the strained
decoction of the Plums. Some, besides the Authors intention, add Cinnamon; but
we think it unfit for a lenitive and refrigerative Medicament.

And we judge no otherwise of Berberries-seeds, though we know that they are
roborative: for Diaprunum may easily be without their help, seeing it admits of
Rhabarb and Roses, which are far more roborative, and seeing its main faculty
should rather be lenitive then roborative.

But that they call Spodium, is not once to be thought of in this confection,
because the Grecian Spodium is noxious, and the Arabian cannot be had, and is
withal inconvenient; as also Antispodium, which being nothing but burnt Ivory,
has no affinity with the burnt Roots of Cane, which Avicenna calls Spodium: as
we have showed in our third Book of Medicinal Matter, Chap. 11.

CHAP. 5. Diaprunum compositum seu laxativum; or, The Compound or laxative
Diaprunum. D.N.Myr.
of the simple Diaprunum afore-prescribed lb j. Scammony prepared ss. mingle
them, and make them into an Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
Both the sorts of Diaprunum are compounded and laxative, but the simple not
admitting of Diacridium, subduces the Belly easily, scarce moving the first
region of the Body: the other, which admitting of Diagridium, moves the Belly
potently, and deduces humors from all parts, is called the more compound.

Only one ounce of Diacridium, is added to each pound of the simple Diaprunum:
so that one ounce of the Electuary, contains but one scruple of the same. Nic.
Salernitanus does perversely augment the weight of the Diacridium, mixing seven
dragms thereof, with each pound of the Electuary: for so its purgative faculty
becomes more efferous, and its use more unsafe. Diacridium must be levigated
very small, and put to the Electuary while hot.

This Diaprunum, Vires.
besides those qualities it has common with the other, purges potently, and
yet without molestation: it is successfully used in the diseases of the Reins
and Bladder, in Fevers, and all calid affections.

CHAP. 6. Diaphoenicum, seu Confectio de Dactylis; or, Diaphoenicum, or
Confection of Dates. D.Mes.
of Dates not perfectly ripe, macerated three days in Vinegar 100. Penidees l.
of the best Turbith xxx. Diagridium xij. Ginger, Long Pepper, Rue dried,
Cinnamon, Mace, Lignum Aloes, the seeds of Anise, Fennel, Carret, Galangal, of
each ij. Honey despumed lb ss. or as much as will suffice to bring it into the
consistency of a solid Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
Seeing Dates of a perfect magnitude, and not absolutely mature, are somewhat
flave, there is no need of this word Kirron in the prescript, which vulgar
Apothecaries usually add: for if they derive it from the Greeks, it signifies
flave; if from the Barbarians, who write it Kheyron, it signifies immature; or
rather, as it is most credible, Chayrum, a Town or Field where best Dates grow:
which one Saladinus, a Triobolar writer, seems to avouch, when he says, that
Keiron is a Province of the Sarazens. Seeing there is no need to seek immature
Dates for this confection, when mature ones will make it astrictive enough, and
castigate Scammony: yet I think, That neither absolutely immature, nor yet
mature ones, but indifferent betwixt both, are best.

But before they ingrede the composition, they should be purged from their
pills and stones, cut into pieces, and macerated in a small quantity of
Vinegar, only a day, if they be soft; if not, two or three, and that in an
earthen pot; then must they be brayed in a Marble-Morter; then trajected
through a cernicle, and afterward elixated with despumed honey, till their
vinegar be dissipated.

Some macerate Dates in Hydromel, others in white wind; but they are fitter to
the temper of Aromata's, and attenuate Phlegm, which are macerated in vinegar.

The Penidia must be of Barley, which are made of Sugar and Barley-water,
cocted to an idoneous crassitude.

Turbith, Wood-Aloes, Galangal, Ginger, and other Simples, must be pulverated.
Almorids must first be incided small with a knife, and then levigated with
Penidees; then all the Powders may be mixed together, except Scammony, which
must be brayed apart, and last of all mixed with them; not to thrice as much
Honey, as Cordus holds, but to half a pound.

For thus much honey, suffices the Dates, Penidia and Almonds being all sweet;
whose weight in all, is one pound, nine ounces and three dragms; the weight of
the other Powders, eight ounces and six dragms: which put together, make two
pounds and an half; which, with half a pound of despumed honey, constitutes
three pounds, or thirty six ounces: so that for each ounce of the compound,
there is a scruple of Diacridium.

Perhaps this quantity of honey, may not to some seem copious enough to receive
the Powders, nor just to bring the Electuary to a legitimate consistence;
especially seeing Bauderonius, most perite in Pharmacy, takes thirteen ounces
and an half of honey; Bern. Dissennius, two pounds; Joan. Costa, two pounds and
eight ounces; and Rondeletius, six pounds: But Dates, Penidia, and Almonds,
supplying Honey's office, the quantity we have defined may be enough, which by
augmentation makes the virtue of the compound more imbecile.

Some weigh the Dates after they are macerated in vinegar; others take (and
that better) their weight according to Mesu's definition, before their
maceration; and then infuse, then bray and prepare them, as we have declared.
This Medicament is denominated from them, as from its basis: which yet some
call Diaturbith, because Turbith is most prepotent amongst the Purgatives,
which ingrede its composition; because of which, this Medicament is
Phlegmagogous.

Diaphoenicum, Vires.
or confection of Dates, does clemently and safely purge phlegm and choler,
cures Belly-ach, cholick, and all diseases from crude and pituitous humors,
diuturnal also, and pituitous Fevers.

He that has this Medicament, may well be without both the Indo's.

CHAP. 9. Electuarium de Psyllo; or, Electuary of Fleawort. D.M.
of the depurated Juyces of Bugloss, Borrage, Endive, and Smallage, of each lb
ij. the Juice of Fumatory iij. mingle them, and macerate in them a whole day,
of the leaves of Senny j. Anise-seed, Dodder, Asarabacca, of each ss.
Maidenhair, m.j. Spikenard ij. Let all these be fervefied together; to which
add, of Violets iij. Epithimum.
Dodder of Thyme ij. Boil them a little, afterward let them be strained; and
infuse in the Colature for 24 hours, of the whole seeds of Fleabit iij. Let
them be agitated well in the mixture, afterward strained, and to lb iiij. of
the Colature, add of white Sugar lb ij. ss. Boil it to a little above the
consistence of a Syrup; and while it is hot, mingle of Diagridium sinely
sifted iij. Trochisks of Diarrhodon Abbatis, de Antispodio, and of Rhabarb, of
each j. Troches of Berberries, Conserve of Violets, of each ss. and so make it
into an Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
Many commend this Medicament, when congested and compounded; but few celebrate
the Simples whereof it consists; scarce two amongst a hundred keep to one
proportion, or make it after one manner: for, some augment, some detract, and
many change the weight; but we, in the apparation of this Medicament, hold the
words of no Authors for Oracles, but according to the dictate of Reason, change
somewhat of that our Author prescribed: For in stead of the succe of wild
Bugloss, we substitute the succe of Garden Bugloss, or rather Borrage, as
better; in stead of half an ounce of Senny, which could be of no remarkable
potency, we put a whole ounce; in stead of three ounces and an half of
Scammony, we only admit of three, that each scruple thereof, might respond to
each ounce of the composition: For we judge, that its purgative faculty will
thus be valid enough. We do not institute cocted Diacridium, to be recocted in
a Quince, lest its virtue be obtunded.

We have added Conserve of Violets, that it might be more lenitive: we admit of
only half an ounce of Asarabacca, in stead of Mesue's four. But it may be that
weight was changed by the Printer, mistaking iiij. for iiij. Polytrichum may be
substituted in defect of Maidens-hair: the manner of preparation is apparent
enough in the description.

Now if any admire why Mesue, designing a venenate quality to Fleawort, should
put it in so great quantity in this Medicament, whereof it is the Basis: I
answer, That that might happen to him, which many grave men have not avoided,
to wit, to speak something precipitantly, which better thoughts, and further
knowledge, might castigate and change: But however he thought, Fleawort is not
deletery, and therefore accedes this Electuary, which is of much use.

This Electuary does not only temper, but purge choler, Vires.
helps in acute Fevers, and all hot and dangerous diseases, cures the Vertigo,
and all such capital affections as proceed from the ascent or congestion of hot
humors, and helps the hot or obstructed Liver, and other affections flowing
from that fountain.

CHAP. 8. Benedicta laxativa; or, The blessed laxative. D.N. Salern.
of Turbith, Radix, Esulae prepared, of each x. Diagridium, Hermodactyls,
Rose-leaves, of each v. Ginger, Galangal, Cloves, Cardamomes, Amomus, or in its
defect Acorus, Long-Pepper, Mace, Spikenard, Saffron, the seeds of Smallage,
Caraway, Fennel, Saxafrage, Gromwell, Asparagrass, Butchers-broom, Sal Gemme,
of each j. of despumed honey lb j. and viij. ss. to make it up into an
Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
Before the root of Esula be brayed, and used as it should, it must be
macerated four and twenty hours in Vinegar; then exsiccated, and pulverated
with Turbith, Spikenard cut small, Ginger, the lesser Galangal, and
Hermodactyle: when these are half brayed, the Aromata's must be mixed with
them, and all of them levigated together: only Salt, Saffron, Sugar, and
Scammony, must be prepared apart.

The weight of the Powders, without Salt and Sugar, is lij. and thrice as much
despumed honey must be put thereto, that the confection may be of a legitimate
consistence; which benignly subduces the Belly.

Their opinion must be rejected, who think that Diagridium must either be
lessened in quantity, or quite subtracted, lest the Medicament become too
Cholagogous: for there concurring three Phlegmagogous Purgatives, this quantity
is well defined, both to excite the slow faculty of Turbith, and to purge some
choler with the phlegm.

It does not only draw these humors from the first region of the Body, Vires.
but from the Reins also, and remoter parts. It absolves obstructions, expels
all viscid humors, and moves phlegm from the articles.

of Fumatory, pulp of Prunes, and Raisins stoned, of each lb ss. of white Sugar,
and of Honey despumed, of each lb j. boil them to the consistency of Honey;
then sprinkle in these powders: of Agarick, and Senny, of each ij. of Rhabarb
j. ss. Epithimus j. Diagridium vj. Cinnamon ss. Ginger ij. the seeds of Fumatory
and Anise, Spikenard, of each j. make it into an Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
Fernelius has well castigated and changed this Electuary, preserving its
virtue entire, and reducing its description into an easier form: for, as
Plantius says, Myrobolambs twice decocted, and then brayed and imposed, are
frustraneous. Rhabarbs faculty perishes by coction; Cassia, Manna, and
Tamarinds, by coction corrupt: Diagridium also, when cocted, is without virtue,
nor easily commiscible: and yet by Mesue's ancient description, these were all
thus prepared, and confusedly mixed, without art or order. Wherefore we have
extracted this description from Fernelius, as being much better when made, and
much casier to make, without which, no Pharmacopoly should be once found: And
notwithstanding this same Rhythmical admonition of a certain Versificator: Non
eris illusus, teneas si quod tenet usus. When the use is prave, it must be
changed; and that mutation is good, which is from good to better.

Mesue requires to this confection, the Whey of Goats-milk, but defines not how
much: yet we may assume the Whey of Asses milk in its stead; and if that be
wanting, of Cows-milk: in two pounds whereof, the Simples must be macerated and
cocted, and they will depose their faculties therein. The pulps of Raisins and
Plums must be dissolved in the colature; the Honey, Sugar and succe of
Fumatory, must be all cocted therein, above the consistence of a Syrup: the
rest must be added as the description shows; it is easy enough.

This confection purges both the Biles, and salt phlegm; Vires.
and thence conduces to the Canker, Leprosy, Raving, Melancholy, Tetter, Itch,
Scab, and such cutaneous affections.

Barber-Chirurgeons use this, to purge all such as are infected with the French
disease; as though all had one temper, and but one humor peccant in all men.
But such of them as boast more glotiously, and are by conference with Medicks
something more prudent, acknowledge the matter peccant in this disease, to be
various, according to the various natures of the diseased.

iij. of Violets ij. of Penidees iiij. Loaf-sugar lb ss. the whitest Honey

The COMMENTARY.
The acception of the word Tryphera, seems to be contrarily taken by Mesue;
whose Trypherae, as he describes them, are not delicate, as the word denotes,
but grateful in color and sapour, and incommendable in faculties, I exhibit
one endued with all these dowries; for its sapour is very grateful, its color
pleasant, and its faculties eximious, and easily tolerable, by such as need
them.

We leave out Ginger, which was wont to be added to Turbith, because we have
accumulated many Aromata's, to castigate its serity, which are more sweet and
cordial; which also abate of the fury of Diagridium, especially Roses, Violets,
and Santals, which allay also the heat of the Aromata's: Penidia are added for
mitigation, Sugar for suavity, and Honey for conservation.

Anton. Landaeus, an Apothecary of Paris, made it after this form faithfully as
I have described it, and exhibited it by my advice to many sick people, who
without any insuavity to the mouth, subversion to the stomach, or torsion to
the Belly, were thereby successfully purged, and securely liberated from their
diseases.

It is most commodious to such who abound with many bilious and pituitous
excrements, and can take no purgative Medicaments, but grateful ones: for this
confection is not insuave, and yet it potently subduces the Belly, removes
obstructions, purges crass and viseid humors, helps compounded Fevers, and all
such diseases as arise from phlegm and bile: But it is not so good in the heat
of Summer, unless it be drunk in some validly-refrigerative decoction, or other
such liquor.

ij. Sem. Agni Casti, Roman Gith, Spikenard, of each ij. Rosemary, Stoechados,
of each ij. Make it into an Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
Each disease has its praesidy, but every Dispensatory suppeditates not a
Salve for every sore: We shall endeavor now to add something, wherein many
have been defective, and afford an auxiliary for the Hypochondriacal; who, as
yet, have been either overlooked, or taken for desperate. This Medicament is
concinnated for the affections of the Hypochondriacal, Histerical,
Melancholical, and such as venery has proclaimed Frenchmen. It is named
Dialalzemer, from Senny its Basis, which the Arabians call Albazemer; then
which, no Medicament is more melanagogous, nor purge more tolerable. This we
mix partly in Powder, partly in infusion, with such things as discuss
flatulency, attenuate humors, remove infarctures, roborate the spleen, liver,
and bowels, recreate the faculties, respect the Uterus, obtund some malign
quality, and securely propel humors long since congested; not only
melancholical and contumacious ones, but viscid and pituitous also, which
sometimes put on the habit of Melancholy, and some adust bilious humors: and
therefore we add Rhabarb and Turbith, that we may with the Melancholical
Captain-humour, educe the Pituitous, his companion inseparable, and also the
Bilious, which is pedissequous.

And because this Medicament most respects melancholy, we have selected black
Hellebore for this black humor; rejecting the white, as more convenient for
Phlegm.

The manner of its preparation is easy, and sufficiently demonstrated in the
description. But before all be congested into the composition, the Azure-stone
calls for some preparation; as thus:

A sufficient quantity thereof must be taken, brayed in a Metalline Mortar,
washed with common water, dried in the Sun or hot ashes; then again washed and
dried; and so again, and again, till the water remain limpid; then must it be
dried, and that not ten, but, if need be, twenty times; then let it be washed
four, five, or more times in cordial waters; then let it be dried, and kept for
use. For thus its malign quality perishes, and its purgative evades conqueror.
In the confection of Alkermes it is burnt, and its purgative faculty exhaled,
its cordial only then remaining, whereof there is use.

Diabalzemer does miraculoussy help the Splenical, Vires.
Melancholical, Hypochondriacal, Maniacal, Epileptical, Histerical, and
Elephantical: This frees Widows from their foetid colors for want of
concourse; and venereous Indians from their scarlet Noses, contracted by
contract.

CHAP. 12. Hydragogum Eximium.
of the roots of Orris, Reed, Grass, the barks of the roots of Capers,
Asarabacca, Caraway, of each vj. Pimpinel, Polytricus
Maidenhair, Egrimony, Ceterach, Mugwort, of each m.j. of the flowers of the
Peachtree m. ss. Boil them in a sufficient quantity of water: In the Colature
infuse and boil a little, of the leaves of Senny ij. of the seeds of Carret ij.
boil the decoction, till it comes to a pint; to which add Juice of
Damask-Roses lb ss. Sugar lb ss. Honey despumed in the decoction x. boil them
to a Syrup: to which add these following powders, Manna ij. Turbith, Esula.
Milkwort prepared, of each j. ss. Ginger j. Water-flag, Calamus, Aromaticus,
of each j. Mechoacan ij. the seeds of Dwarf-eldern ss. and of Sea-Coleworts
iij. Cinnamon ij. make it up into an Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
Many descriptions we have, which smell more of confusion, then composition,
whose effects show their brangling Authors; and therefore we reject many liquid
Electuaries, as either unaccommodated for cure, by their ill composure; or
obsolete, for want of custom; picking out such as are better described, and
more approved by their sanative effects: As, besides the two former which we
have added, this also, which for its excellence is called, The eximious
Hydragogal Electuary, which we desire may be always in Pharmacopolies, that it
may be ready to open the sluice when the river is stopped, and the banks almost
overrun; lest the hydroptical be without praesidy, and drown his vitals in his
watty Belly. And because we would have this Medicament perfect, we have added
such things as will emend the distemper, remove the obstructions, and roborate
the whole of the Spleen and Liver, from which the hydroptical get much of his
evil. We have also added some, to discuss flatuosity, and awaken the native
calour; Besides many more, which duly prepared, become hydragogous. The form
demonstrates the manner of their preparation.

This may be safely given to such as labor under the Dropsy; Vires.
for it educes watery humors without violence; and is a most accommodate
Purgative for all diseases arising from thence.

The Parisian common people used to flock to a woman-Pharmacopolist, who gave
them a certain Powder, to purge the hydroptical of their watery and serous
humors; but few or none recovered.

SECT. II. Of Hierae.
SOme Purgative Compounds were for their excellent effects, by the Greeks
called Hierae, that is, Holy, and Great; for they are endued with great
virtues, and cure great diseases: but they are most vulgarly denominated from
some famous Author; as,

CHAP. 1. Hiera Picra, seu Dialoe Galeni.
lb of Cinnamon, Mace, Asarum, Spikenard, Saffron, Mastick, Squinant, of each
vj. Aloes not washed 100. or lb j. and ss. the best Honey despumed, the treble
quantity, or lb iiij. make it into an Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
This Hiera is, by Galen its Author, called Picra, that is, amare, because of
the Aloes, which is its Basis; from which it mutuates its Purgative faculty. We
retain the old composition, save that in stead of Xylobalsum, which is scarce
to be had, we, by Fernelius his advice, substitute Mace; and for the flowers of
the sweet Rush, which are not brought to us, the Rush it self: and so we keep
to the quantity which Galen, or rather Andromachus, prescribed to be mixed with
the Aloes.

This Hiera Picra was most usual at Rome; besides other two, which Galen
sometimes used; in which he detracted, changed, or at pleasure added what
exigence called for. But now they are obsolete.

But this yet remains entire, except it be for the wood of Balm, which some
take out, and substitute nothing; others the surcles of Lentisks; and others,
the fruit of Balm: which is equally rare, therefore no good substitute. But
Mace or Sweet-cane may well succeed in its room, and the Hiera no whit less
efficacious. Galen is perhibited its Author, rather because he celebrated it,
then invented it. It is easy to make: the Mastick, Aloes and Saffron must
first be brayed a part, then the rest; and afterward the ingredients must all
be mixed in despumed honey, that they may acquire the spissitude of an
Electuary.

It califies, incides, attenuates, dryes, deterges, Vires.
removes obstructions, expurges bilious, pituitous, crass, and viscid humors:
it conduces miraculously, helps the affections of the Ventricle, Mesentery,
Liver, Head, and Junctures: to each ounce of the compound, put ij. and g. i.
ss. and of the Powder of the rest, g.xv.

CHAP. 2. Hiera Picra with Agarick.
of the species of Hierae without Aloes, Agarick trochiscated, of each ss.
Aloes not washed j. Honey despumed a treble quantity, or vj. make it into an
Electuary according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
This Hierae consists of two benign purgative Medicaments; the one Aloes, which
is Cholagogous; the other Agarick, which is Phlegmagogous: For two humors
might be too hard for one Medicament; therefore to a mixed distemper, we
prescribe a mixed cure, or a compound of mixed qualities. And because Galens
Hiera Picra is often given to the affections of the Ventricle and Brain,
wherein much of crass phlegm lodges, as well as Bile, we have described this
Hiera with Agarick, that it may expurge all at once. It is made as the
precedent, whose powder is often kept in Pharmacopolies, and when use requires,
mixed with Aloes and Honey, or with Aloes, Honey, and Agarick, as the Medicks
scope requires.

But that which admits of Agarick, Vires.
is useful to many things: for it educes all, but chiefly crass and viscid
phlegm, and putrid Bile; it incides humors, takes away infarctures, exonerates
the Mesentery, purges the ventricle, resarciates the appetite, helps coction,
educes noxious humors from the brain, and cures the Epilepsie, Vertigo and
Viligance.

CHAP. 3. Hiera Pachii; or, Pacchius his Hiera. D. Scribon.
of Stoechados, Horehound, Germander, Agarick, Coloquintida, of each x.
Opoponax, Sagapenum, Parsley seeds, long Birthwort, white Pepper, of each v.
Cinnamon, Spikenard, Myrrh, Indian leaf, Saffron, of each ss. Honey despumed a
treble quantity, or lb iij. mingle them according to Art into an Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
Oribasius attributes this Hiera to Ruffius; Paulus, to Archigenus; Scribonius
Largus, to Pacchius: yet he was not the first Author, but a prudent celebrator
thereof, who getting much lucre thereby, kept it to himself as a hidden Secret,
till his death: When he was dead, its description, as it is here given, was
brought to Tiberius Caesar; from whom Scribonius got it, who before that time
was by no art able to extort it. Aetius calls it sometimes the Hiera of
Archigenus, sometimes of Antiochus; and we call it Pacchius his Hierae: and it
is thus made:

Sarpagenum, Opopanax, and Myrrh, must be macerated a whole night in Hydromel
or Wine, rather then Vinegar; then trajected through a strong strainer, that
all their impurer parts may be secerned, afterward mixed with despumed honey,
together with other pulverated simples: but Saffron, Agarick, and Coloquintida,
must be brayed apart; and in the pulveration of Coloquintida, a drop or two of
Oil put to it, that its virtue may not exhale, and that its pulveration may be
more facile: yet its pulp must only be assumed, and white Horehound rather
then black.

Pacchius his Hiera is efficacious to many things: Vires.
for it cures the Epileptical, the furious, vertiginous, cephalalgicous,
suspirious, anhelant, comatous, and such as are obnoxious to the Incubus, and
other affections of the eyes, ears, and head. It purges also the stomach,
emends the affections of the Liver, takes away the sand in the spleen, and
diminishes its hardness; auxiliates the diseases of the intestines, discusses
or opens imposthumes, either already made there, or in making; and moves fluors
in such women as can hardly be purged.

CHAP. 4. Hiera Diacolocynthidos magist. or, The Magisterial Hiera of
Diacolocynthis.
of pulp of Coloquintida j. Agarick, black Hellebore, of each ss. Aloes x.
Diagridium, Polypody, Mastick, Opoponax, Bdellium, Sagapenum, of each ij. of
the roots of Enula-campane, Cyprus, Angelica, Cloves, Cinnamon, Mace,
Bay Berries, Juniper Berries, Cardamomes, Majoran, Stoechados, Saffron,
Spikenard, of each j. Roseleaves iij. Honey despumed lb j. ss. mingle them
according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
In the Apothecaries Dispensatories, nothing is more confounded, then the
descriptions of Hierae, which every one arbitrarily either changes, or
denominates wrong. Hence we see the same Hiera designed by three names; as that
same which is sometimes called the Hiera of Pacchius, sometimes the Hiera of
Archigenus, sometimes of Ruffius, and sometimes also of Diacolocynthis: and
three different Hiera's designed by one name; as this of Diacolocynthis, which
Mesue describes one way, Nic. Myrepsus another, and Fernelius another. But we
prefer the Hiera of Pacchius before them all, which we call Magisterial,
because of the excellency of its Basis and faculties. He that has this, may
easily be without all the Hiera's which admit of Coloquintida; and it is thus
made:

Opoponax, Bdellium, and Sagapenum, must be macerated a whole night, or else a
day, in Vinegar, rather then in Wine, because of the heat of those simples
which ingrede its composition: then they must be well strained, and the Vinegar
resolved upon ashes; the Purgatives must be brayed apart, and a little Oil of
Almonds put to the Coloquintida, lest it molest the Brayer; then the other
simples, the hardest first, the Aromata next, all must be mixed with despumed
honey to a legitimate spissitude.

It is of eximious power, Vires.
in curing the affections of the head, ventricle, and abdomen; which proceed
from crude, pituitous, crass, or melancholical humors; but especially sanative
of the Apoplexy, Drowziness, Lethargy, Palsy, Epilepsie, Incubus, difficulty
of Breathing, Cholick, Hypochondriacal Melancholy, and all affections of the
Belly arising from vitreous and crass phlegm, and all such as stupifie the
senses, or hebescate motion, or both.

SECT. III. Of solid Electuaries, and Purgative Trochisks.
THose that compose, or rather transcribe Antidotaries or Dispensatories, think
they demerit much praise, if without Art or Reason they do congest a heap of
Medicaments, depromed from certain Authors. But we have not only selected all,
but picked out of the most select, such as long Use and Reason have best
approved of. Whereunto we have added, and from which we have detracted what
Reason assured us was useless, or Experience told us was rare and unknown: And
this not only in the descriptions of the Ancients, but of the more Recents
also; for it often happens, that grave men both write and speak from others
relations, and so hold and defend for truth, what they have miss-heard, or not
known. And I therefore describe fewer Medicaments in this Shop, because I would
be able to give the legitimate Composition, the true manner and reason of it,
the illustration and faculties upon good grounds and experience.

CHAP. 1. Electuarium Diacarthami; or, The Electuary of Diacarthamum, or
Diacnic. Des. Arnal. Villan.
of the pith of the seeds of Bastard-saffron, Hermodactyls, Pull Diatrag.
frigid. of each ss. Turbith vj. Ginger, Manna Granata, of each ij. Diagridium
iij. Sugar Candy, the Medulla of Quinces condited, Honey of Roses, of each j.
white Sugar iij. ss. make it according to Art into a solid Electuary tabulated.

The COMMENTARY.
The description of Diacarthamum is as much controverted, as it is used; which
you shall scarce find alike in two Authors. Joubertus describes it three
manner of ways; but Use and Reason assure us, that one of them is more certain
safe, which we have borrowed from Nic. Praepositus, which is somewhat changed
from that which its Author Arnaldus Villanovinus gave of it.

It takes its name from Carthamus, which is its Basis; though Turbith in plenty
and faculties exceed it: Both their qualities are intended by the adjection of
Ginger. Diagridium and Hermodactyls do not only draw phlegm, but bile also
from the articles; their efferous quality is castigated by condited Quinces
flesh: Manna, Diatragacanthum and Sugar, are put to leniate and temper, to
deterge and move phlegm, and Honey to conserve.

Diacarthamum must be thus prepared: The seed of Carthamus must first be
decorticated, then brayed; afterward Ginger, Turbith, and Hermodactyls must be
pulverated; then Diagridium, and Candid Sugar, and Quinces, the Honey, Manna,
and Cidoniatum must be then mixed with the Sugar, cocted to the consistence of a
Syrup whilst hot, and afterward the powders, that they make a solid
Electuary, to be discinded into tabels.

It is of frequent use, Vires.
and is kept ready almost in all Pharmacopolies: it purges pituitous humors
potently, not only from the ventricle and Mesentery, but also from more remote
parts: if it be assumed in greater quantity, it detracts also something of
Bile: wherefore it helps not only in quotidian, and merely pituitous Fevers,
but in complicated also; which arise from the mixture of diverse humors.

CHAP. 2. Elect. de succo Rosar. or, An Electuary of the succe of Roses.
of the depurated Juice of red Roses lb j. Sugar lb j. ss. boil them into a
solid Electuary; to which add of the three Sanders, of each ss. Mastick ij. ij.
dry Citron-pill j. Camphyr j. make of these a hard and solid Electuary, which
roll out upon a board, and last into Tallets, every one to weigh j. ss. or ij.
at least.

The COMMENTARY.
I am not he, who for ostentation would change the old, and promulgate new
sentences, but to pass my judgment on such things as are spoken or written
without reason: and here I challenge liberty to Philosophize.

And now I seeing this Electuary described by Myrepsus, discerpted from
Salernitanus, variously patched, and ill concinnated by the more recent; I
feared not to diminish the too heavy weight, augment the too light, and change
the inept things: All which I did with consultation, not precipitantly; I
seeing no reason that the succe of Roses should be of equal weight with the
Sugar, I diminish the quantity of the succe, and augment the Sugar; well
knowing, that a pound of Sugar will sooner and better be cocted to the
consistence of a Syrup, or an Electuary, in half a pound of Roses succe, then
in a whole one; and its faculties will not be much more imbecile, but
roborative enough.

Something also I have detracted from the weight of the Santals, and have
substituted a little of the Pill of Oranges in its stead; partly to conciliate
more suavity, and partly to arceate putretude, and recreate the vitals. Some
leave out Camphyre, because of its strong sent: but I approve of it; for its
halite quality makes the Electuary more grateful, and its permeative quality
more efficacious.

I have, in stead of Spodium, which cannot be had, Antispodium, which being
only burnt Ivory, is not proper, substituted Mastick, to roborate the
Ventricle, and castigate Scammony.

Burnt Ivory is foolishly and ineptly called Spodium, and substituted for the
fictitious Arabian Spodium: for, let Apothecaries believe as they will, there
is but one true Spodium, and that is the Grecian Pompholix, which should never
be introsumed. The Arabian Interpreters are also miserably out, in rendering
Tabaxir Spodium, and Spodium Burnt Ivory: for Tabaxir is the succe or concreted
liquor of certain Trees, or very crass and tall Reeds, which by the agitation
of the wind, and their mutual collision, sometimes conflagrate; from which
burning, Avicenna mendicated his Spodium, or rather Tabaxir, which his infidous
Interpreter Clusius calls his Spodium. But we get not this Tabaxir from India,
nor the ashes of these burnt Canes from Arabia; neither would they be of much
use in Medicine, if we had them: nor yet does burnt Ivory respond to them as a
substitute; therefore they must either be quite expunged, or some other
congruous Medicament placed in their stead.

In the vulgar description, there are xxxvj. of Diagridium, for each ounce of
the composition: But in our emendation, there accedes only half a dragm of
Diagridium, to each ounce of the compound; and yet it is so valid and potent,
that it may well retain its old name, The spur of Purgatives; for, in a small
mole, it has much of efficacy.

The manner of its preparation, is the same with Diacarthamum, and that is
apparent enough, by the description of the form: some take only the distilled
succe of Roses, wherein they macerate their Tragacanthum, and extract a Mucago
for the comprehension of the Powders, and the concinnation of their solid
Electuary. But I had rather inspissate the succe in S. Mary's Bath, to the
spissitude of a Rob, that so it might better concorporate the Powders. If any
will use unprepared Scammony for Diagridium, he may upon good grounds leave the
wonted quantity of Roses succe.

This Electuary is merely cholagogous, Vires.
and by educing choler potently, cures such affections as proceed from that
humor.

CHAP. 3. Electuarium de Citro solutivum.
of the bark of Citron-Pill condited, of the Conserve of Violets, of the
Conserve of Bugloss-flowers, Pull Diatrag. frigid. of each ss. Turbith v.
Ginger, ss. Senny j. sweet Fennel-seed j. white Sugar dissolved in Rose Water,
and cocted according to Art x. make it into a solid Electuary.

If this our restituted description arride not any one so well, as that antic
one of Stephanus Arnaldus, or Guidon Cauliacus, he may here take it:

of the Conserve of Violets, of Borrage, of each ij. the roots of Bugloss,
Citron-Pill condited, of each j. Ginger ss. Pull Diatrag. frigid. ij. Diagridium
iij. Turbith ss. Senny v. Sugar x. Let this Electuary be made into Tablets,
every one weighing ss. which is the just dose.

The COMMENTARY.
This laxative Electuary of Oranges, is a Catholical, or Universal Cathartick:
for it draws both the Biles and Phlegm potently, and without molestation;
especially that which we described first: wherein every Purgative has its
castigator, as Senny, Fennel, Turbith, Ginger, Diagridium, condite Orange-Pill,
Conserves, and Rose Water, wherein the Sugar is cocted: All which roborate the
heart and faculties, and mitigate the said Purgatives. The Powder of
Diatragacanthum is put in to leniate, the Sugar to deterge, leniate, and
conserve.

We have also added four times the quantity of Orange-Pill, both because it is
its basis, and because it recreates the principal parts of the body. We also
thought good to augment the quantity of Diagridium, to bear some proportion
with the rest: otherwise, its Purgative faculty being already imbecile, would
be made more impotent by the increment of the Conserves: the Basis then of the
Medicament, the roboratives, purgatives, and castigatories being by us rightly
described, the whole, as amended, may be of most safe, easy, and approved use.

The Sugar should be cocted a little below the consistence of a solid
Electuary, because of the quantity of powders.

It is of very much use: for it much conduces in tertian and semitertain Agues;
purges the stomach, expels the prave humors abiding in the Hypochondria; takes
away loathsomness toward meat, emends the ill disposition of the body,
roborates the heart and ventricle, and absumes the excrementitious humidity of
the bowels.

We purpose in our next book, to treat of Trochisks, which are all roborative,
or alliotical, or alterative; save some few, which are purgative: of which, our
method leads us to treat briefly in this Section.

CHAP. 4. Trochisci de Rhabarbaro; or, Trochisks of Rhabarb.
of the best Rhabarb x. of the Juice of Egrimony, bitter Almonds, of each ss.
Rose-leaves iiij. Spikenard, Anise-seed, Madder-roots, Wormwood, The Roots.
Asarabacca, Smallage-seed, of each j. Let them be formed according to Art into
Troches, every one weighting j.

The COMMENTARY.
Few such Pastils are kept in Pharmacopolies, seeing when use calls for them,
Medicks can take some Rhabarb, and mix it with simples fit for their purpose:
but prudent Apothecaries, who are not given to avarice, will not want such;
whose use is salutary, and description good.

But that they may be duly made, the Rhabarb and Folesfoot must first be brayed
small, that they may better pervade the Liver, the infractures of the
Mesentery, and the passages of the Uterus and Reins: The rest must also be
pulverated very small, and made into a mass, with a sufficient quantity of the
succe of Egrimony, whereof Trochisks of any figure may be formed. If the
definite quantity of Egrimonies succe be not sufficient for the receipt of the
powders, it may be augmented, that all may be better subacted; and the
Trochisks, when concinnated, must be dried and kept.

Trochisks of Rhabarb are good against the cold and bilious affections, Vires.
the obstructions, dolours, tumors, and depraved actions of the Liver: they
help also the present or the imminent Dropsy, and the Jaundies.

CHAP. 5. Trochisci de Agarico; or, Trochisks of Agarick. D.Gal.
of the whitest Agarick grated small ij. or as much as thou please: macerate
it in white wind, in which there has been Ginger infused, and thereof make a
soft mass, and of it, Troches; which when dry, let them be again pulverated,
and with the same wine, again redacted to a paste; of which form Troches for
future use.

The COMMENTARY.
Agarick is variously prepared by Mesue, with sweet Wine, with Oxymel of
Squills, with gemmeous Salt, with Whey of Milk, with Carrets, and other simples.

Galen forms it into Trochisks, with lesser, easier, and more commodious
Preparation; which being of much use in Pharmacy, we have here described, and
approve of these as best: some mix gemmeous Salt with them, that with its
weight it may compel the Agarick to the bottom of the Ventricle, that by its
abstersive faculty it may help purgation, and excite its slow faculty: But
Ginger and Wine do not only serve to promote its vomitory quality, but also
stimulate its purgative faculty; attenuate viscid and crass humors, and
attract them from remoter parts. Ginger also, by the tenuity of its parts,
causes perviation; for the Agarick, by its heat, helps purgation, and by its
aromaticity, recreates the Ventricle, heart, and noble parts; as Wine also,
which by its ponderous substance cohibits the levity of the Agarick: by reason
whereof, it delabes slowly to the bottom of the Ventricle; and the supernatant
is sometimes solely excluded with humors.

Trochisks of Agarick purge pituitous humors, Vires.
not only from the first region of the Body, but from remote parts also, if
taken in larger quantity.

CHAP. 6. Trochisci Alhandal; or, Trochisks of Coloquintida. D. Mes.
of the pulp of Coloquintida purged from its seeds x. let it be cut small, and
rubbed with j. of Oil of Roses, Gumme-Arabick, Thraganth, Bdellium, of each vj.
macerate them three or four days in Rose Water, or so long till they be
perfectly dissolved; then with the aforesaid pulp, and part of this mussilage,
make it into Trochisks; which dry in the shade, and keep.

The COMMENTARY.
Trochisks of Coloquintida or Alhandal, as the Arabians have, may be with
success injected into all compositions which receive Coloquintida; for this
cannot be assumed simply, and uncastigated, without molestation; but formed
into Trochisks, and concinnated with others, with safety: for thus prepared, it
ingredes the compofition of other Medicaments, whose faculties it acuates, and
makes them educe phlegm, and other crass and viscid humors more potently.

But that these Trochisks may be right made, the whitest and light pulp of
Coloquintida must be selected, and not only incided, but pulverated small:
being crass, and introsumed, it moves the Dysentery, and abrades the intestines
from such portions as are contained in its gyres and anfractures. Mesue in his
old Book prescribes only x. of the pulp of Coloquintida; but the place is
suspected for erroneous, and x. put for x. for otherwise the quantity of
Bdellium, and other Gummes, of each whereof he has put ij. must be lessened;
which is no more then sufficient for ten ounces.

These Trochisks potently purge viscid phlegm, Vires.
and other glutinous humors; and therefore conduce much to the cholical dolor
arising from vitreous and viscid phlegm; they cure the Apoplexy, Vertigo,
Epilepsie, difficulty of breathing, and cold and arthritical Diseases, not
yielding to common Medicaments.

We shall in the sequent Book treat of other alterative and toborative
Trochisks, and solid Purgatives, as Pills.

SECT. IV. Of Pills.
WE have in the former Sections given liquid and solid Electuaries,
accommodated to all diseases and morbifical causes. Now our Method leads us to
treat of Pills, which many prefer before all other Medicaments. And here we
shall begin with such as receive nothing that is Purgative, but Aloes; then
pass to such as admit Aloes and Agarick; then to such as receive Rhabarb, then
Senny, then Turbith, Diagridium, Coloquintida, or some more potent Cathartick.
We begin with Aloes, because it is the Basis of all or most Pills; and because
it recreates the bowels and noble parts, and can scarce be otherwise
introsumed: for being very bitter and ungrateful, it can scarce be assumed in a
liquid potion, but is given in form of Pills, that it may be more easily
devoured; as we have shown in Chap. 14. Book 3. of our Institutions.

CHAP. 1. Pilulae stomachicae; Stomachical, or Pills before Meat. D.Mes.
of the best Aloes vj. Mastick, Roses, of each ij. with Syrup of Roses, or
Wormwood, make it into a solid mass.

The COMMENTARY.
All Pills which receive of Purgatives only Aloes, or Aloes and Rhabarb, being
clement, and drawing humors only from the first region, and helping the
stomach, are called Stomachical, or Pills before meat; because they may at any
time, a little before meat, be safely taken: of which sort are those Aloes in
the succe of Roses, coacted into a mass with Wine; as also those of Scaliger,
Ruffus, and Pills of Hiera. But these we have given, being most usual, and
easy to make, may serve for a rule, for all stomachical Pills that should be
kept in Pharmacopolies: but they should be made only in small quantity, that
they may be always new and fresh; for by long keeping they become too dry, and
their faculties duller. The mass must be involved in a piece of Leather well
oyled, and then reposed in a Tin-pot well shut.

All Pills and other Purges should be given on an empty stomach, especially
such as should draw noxious humors from remoter parts, which may be assumed
long before or after meat, as after the first sleep; but stomachical Pills not
so: for it is enough that they be taken one hour before breakfast, or other
meals, that the Belly may be gently subduced, and phlegm, or other prave
humors, contained in the Ventricle, or other vicine parts, be educed, Vires.
which all stomachical Pills effect, roborating the stomach, resarciating the
appetite, and exciting it to rest.

CHAP. 2. Pilulae Ruffi; commonly called Pestilential.
of the best Aloes ij. Myrrh j. Saffron ss. and with the best Honey and Wine.
Oinomel, make it into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
There is scarce any Medicament, but it is by some changed from that it was by
its Author at first made. These Pills are compounded by few, but variously
changed by many: for some add a third part of Myrrh, others a fourth, and
some only an eighth: some mix Saffron and Myrrh in equal weight; others take
only half as much Saffron as Myrrh, and half as much Myrrh as Aloes:
according to which opinion, most famous Medicks prescribe, and we have formed
our description.

Rondeletius denies, that Ruffus was the Inventor of these Pills; for he
tradited a Potion, rather then Pills, as Paulus Aegineta evidences. He indeed
described a certain Medicament of Aloes, Myrrh, and Ammoniacum Storax, brayed
in odorate Wine, which he calls a Potion: yet he exhibits it in the magnitude
of a Bean, which concords not with potulent measures, but an usual expression
for the quantity of solid things. And hence the later age, upon good grounds,
pronounces Ruffus the Author of these Pills. We substitute generous Oinomel,
in stead of aromatical Wine, for the reception of the Powders, which is more
convenient; for if they should be subacted only with Wine, the mass would
acquire a stony hardness. Syrup of Wormwood is also a fit recipient for them.

Ruffus his Pills are called Pestilential, Vires.
because they conduce rather to the prevention, then curation of the
Pestilence; for Aloes frees the Body from excrements, Myrrh vindicates it from
putretude, and Saffron recreates the heart and vital faculties: but they very
little profit when the Pestilence is begun; for then more cordial, potent, and
alexipharmacal Medicaments are required.

CHAP. 3. Pills of Mastick.
of Mastick ss. Aloes x. Agarick iij. mix these with vinous Hydromel into a
solid mass.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue calls all the Pills that receive Mastick, Stomachical, whereof he gives
not only various descriptions: But his Commentators, and such as wrote of the
same Subject, and promulgated Antidotaries also, one while augmenting the
Aloes, another time the Agarick, sometimes the Mastick, or else diminishing or
adjecting.

The description we have here given, is more usual and safe; whereunto, if you
add a little Diamoschum, they will be Pills of Aloes, according to the vulgar
edition: But the Agarick should be first brayed; as also the Aloes and Mastick,
and subacted with Hydromel, rather then with Wine, both for efficacy and
conservation.

It is thought, that Petrus de Abano was their Author, who would not denominate
them from their exuberant Aloes, lest many Pills of the same name should be
confounded.

They purge the stomach gently, roborate excellently, Vires.
detract and expel all excrementitious humors from the Abdomen without
molestation; cure the dolor of the head, and many affections of the Uterus.

CHAP. 4. Pilulae de tribus Solutivis; or, Pills of the three Solutives.
of Rhabarb, Aloes, Agarick, of each iij. after they are beaten fine, take
Syrup of Roses solutives, as much as will suffice to bring it into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
These are called the Pills of the three Solutives, because they consist only
of three Purgative Simples, and Syrup of Roses, which indeed is purgative, but
not simple. They are indeed more validly stomachical then the former, because
of the Agarick; which, if it be first made into Trochisks, as it should be,
will be more incisive and attenuative, but less vomitory: The manner of their
preparation is easier, then that it should need explication.

They purge bilious, pituitous, Vires.
crass and viscid humors from the Ventricle, cavities of the Liver and Spleen,
and from the Mesentery; they roborate the stomach, and revoke appetite: and let
this serve for more that might be said of them.

CHAP. 5. Pilulae Imperiales D. Fern. or, Fernelius his Imperial Catholical
Pills.
of the best Aloes ij. choice Rhabarb j. ss. Agarick trochiscated, Senny
picked, of each j. Cinnamon iij. Ginger ij. Nutmegs, Cloves, Spikenard, Mastick,
of each j. and with Syrup of Violets, let them be subacted into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
The Author did not without reason give this egregious denomination to these
Pills, which from the multiplicity of their faculties, and their benignity in
acting, merit a more noble title. They may also be called Catholical Pills,
because they universally expurge all humors from all parts, as the Liver,
Spleen, Ventricle, Brain; and if in greater quantity, from parts farther
dissited.

Nic. Praepositus describes more of the same name, which are seldom made,
because they consist of more things, and are less efficacious.

These Imperial Pills of Fernelius, Vires.
purge, roborate, and liberate all the bowels from infarctures, educe all
noxious and obvious humors, and help the economy of all nutritive parts.

CHAP. 6. Pilulae de Eupatorio majores; or, The greater Pills of Egrimony.
of yellow Myrabolans, the Juyces of Egrimony and Wormwood, of each iij.
Rhabarb iij. ss. Mastick j. Saffron ss. Aloes v. of the Juice, or rather Syrup
of Endive, as much as will suffice to bring it into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue describes two forms of these Pills; the former which we have here
inserted, he calls the greater, the other the lesser; which are seldom (as
both indeed) prepared. But these being very commendable for the Jaundies, and
all obstructions of the Liver, should be kept in Pharmacopolies, that it might
go better with the diseased. They should rather be denominated from Rhabarb,
which is the Basis in the composition: But Authors put names upon the compounds
they invent, rather according to their own wills, then valid reason.

For the due making of them, the succe of true Egrimony and Wormwood should by
evaporation be inspissated, exsiccated, and afterward pulverated; then mixed
with other Medicaments, brayed apart; then all subacted into a fit mass, with
Syrup of Endive or Succory. They act perperously, who following Mesue's
advice, put the Powders into water of Endive, and so coact them into a mass.

These greater Pills of Egrimony do not only cure the Jaundies, Vires.
but periodical and circularly-reiterated Fevers also.

CHAP. 7. Pilulae sine quibus esse nolo; or, Pills without which I would not
be. D. Nic. Praepos.
of the best Aloes xiiij. the five sorts of Myrobalans, Rhabarb, Senny, Agarick
trochiscated, Mastick, Wormwood, Dodder, Rose-leaves, Violets, of each j.
Diagridium vj. ss. Honey despumed with the Juice of Fennel, as much as suffices
to bring it into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
These are also Universal, as well as the Imperial; but more cholagogous and
valid, because of their Diagridium. Their denomination being noted by a certain
circumlocution, show the efficacy and necessity of their use, which no man, or
Master of a Family, that minds his sanity, should be without. Their
ingredients are such as deduce humors from all principal parts of the Body,
and roborate those parts. Rheubarb is their Basis, if we respect their better
part; Scammony, if their more valid and exuperant; and Myrabolambs, if the
weight of fruits.

That they may be duly made, Scammony, Aloes, Agarick, and Mastick should be
pulverated apart; the rest partly alone, and partly together. They must not be
subacted with the water or succe of Fennel, as the Author would; but with
Honey, that they may not too soon become dry and marcid.

These Pills educe Phlegm, and both the Biles, from all parts, Vires.
but especially from the head, eyes, and senses: and thence they lessen the
suffusions of the eyes, conserve sight, and cure the pain and noise in the ears.

CHAP. 30. Pilulae Aureae; or, Golden Pills. D.N.Myr.
of the best Aloes and Diagridium, of each v. of red Roses and Smallage-seed,
of each ij. ss. the seeds of Anise and sweet Fennel, of each j. ss. Powder of
Coloquintida, Saffron, and Mastick, of each j. and with Gumme-Thraganth
dissolved in Rose Water, or rather with Honey of Roses; make it up into a mass
of a legitimate consistence.

The COMMENTARY.
Nic. Praepositus does justly insult over Nic. Myrepsus, the Author of these
Pills, That he described so great a quantity of Diagridium, insomuch that the
place is suspected of Error; where I believe he would have said v. not v.
which may be gathered from his very words, in the end of this 107 Chapter,
where defining the dosis of these Pills, he thus writes: Let them be made like
a Pease, with the water of the infusion of Tragacantha, and nine or eleven of
them taken at night with Mulse or Wine: for this quantity is at least j. ss. or
ij. which admits of almost ss. of Diagridium. However, use has so prevailed,
that they are made according to the manner described: yet with this rule, That
they be exhibited in a just and idoneous weight, according to the Medicks
prudence, and diseased's strength; to whom, if four or five grains of
Diagridium would purge him, so much of these Pills must be given, as receives
just so much Diagridium.

Nic. Praepositus did well in the adjection of Mastick, for the roboration of
the Ventricle, against the attact of such violent Purgatives. Tragacanthum is
also justly commixed, to mitigate the ferity of Scammony: but the Trochisks of
Alhandal were safer, then Coloquintida uncastigated; all must be pulverated
small, and coacted into a mass of a legitimate consistence, with Honey of
Roses: for so it will be softer, then if it had been subacted with the
dissolved Gum of Tragacantha.

They are called Golden Pills, rather from their croceous color, then their
excellent effect: for all Medicaments which potently subduce the Belly, and
validly expurge humors, are not presently denominated aureous or eximious, but
such only as with facility, and without molestation, extract noxious ones.

Golden Pills are very cholagogous; Vires.
for they potently draw Bile and Phlegm also, not only from the inferior, but
also superior Ventricle, and the head; and thence they purge the senses, and
acuate the eyesight.

CHAP. 9. Pilulaede Agarico; or, Pills of Agarick. D. Avic.
of Agarick iij. Orris-root, Horehound, of each j. Turbith, Hierae Picrae, of
each iiij. Coloquintida, Sarcocollae, of each ij. Myrrh j. mingle it with as
much Sape as will suffice to make it into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
Nic. Praepositus adds Mastick to these Pills; the Commentators upon Mesue
like not of it: Fernelius approves of its use, and transcribes their
description out of Praepositus. Joubertus disapproves of it, but gives no
reason. I think it is neither hurtful, nor greatly profitable: for if it be
exploded, the Ventricle cannot want roboratives, as long as Hiera, Myrrh,
Sape, and Orris, ingrede the compound: if it be admitted, it will neither
obtund the faculties of the other, nor much better them.

Their first Author was Avicenna, who described them with Myrrh; which Mesue
omits, as Bauderonius observes in his Book, where he describes Agarick and
Coloquintida, without any express preparation: But it is best to take them
both, when made into Trochisks, and so bray and mix them. The Powder of Galens
Hierae Sacra must be taken with Honey, white Horehound selected, and the Root
of that Orris, whose flower is caeruleous, which Avicenna calls the Celestial
Lilly. The Purgatives must be pulverated apart; the rest partly so, partly
together; and then all mixed together with Sape.

Pills of Agarick purges phlegm potently from all parts, Vires.
conduces to the head and breast; and thence cures the sleepy Disease,
Catarrhs, Vertigo, and such affections as proceed from cold humors, but
especially difficult breathing; for which end Avicenna invented them.

CHAP. 10. Pilulae Cochiae, D. Rhasis.
of the Powder of simple Hierae x. Coloquintida iij. j. Scammony prepared ij.
ss. Turbith, Stoechados, of each v. and with Syrup of Staechados make it up
into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
The Pills of Cochia, are not so called simply from the grain which the Greeks
call (...), but because they are round and small like Pepper-corns; after which
manner, all Pills were wont to be made: and though they be now greater, yet we
give them the same name, as well as the same description. Some think them
excessively purgative, because of the greater quantity of Diagridium. And
seeing Pharmacopolists should have gentle purges for such as are delicate, and
valid ones for the stronger; I would have made them as Rhasis has described
them; for they may be given in such small quantity, that they will not
over-purge the Belly, but educe only noxious humors.

Some doubt in their mixtion, whether Galens Hiera Picra should be taken, or
some other made: We, for many reasons, which for brevities sake we omit, judge
no other Hiera more convenient, valid, or better: but it is safer to admit the
Trochisks of Alhandal, then Coloquintida, unprepared; and if Syrup of Stoechas
be not in readiness, which indeed few keep; then the Powders may be subacted in
Honey, with the decoction of Stoechas despumed, and cocted to the consumption
of its a queous humidity. They are made as the precedents.

These Pills purge partly bilious, Vires.
partly pituitous humors; not only from the head, because of Stoechas, which
is more hepatical then cephalical; but also from other parts, wherein such
humors are contained, for they potently educe them from any part.

CHAP. 11. Pilulae de Hermodactylis majore; or, The greater Pills of
Hermodactyls. D. Mes.
of Hermodacts, Aloes, yellow Myrabolans, Turbith, Coloquintida, Bdellium,
Sagapenum, of each vj. Castor, Sarcocolla, Euphorbium, Opoponax, the seeds of
Rue and Smallage, of each iij. Saffron j. ss. with the Juice of Coleworts make
them into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
These Pills, which take their names from Hermodactyls, are very usual, and
only sufficient for the inveterate dolours of the arteries, and more
efficacious therein, then those we call arthetical Pills: yea, they are more
securely sanative, then such as are denominated from Sagapenum, Opoponax, or
Sarcocolly; so that we shall not need to describe these.

For their due preparation, Sagapenum and Opoponax must be melted in the succe
of Coleworts; then transmitted through a linen cloth, and then a little cocted;
then must the Powders of other simples be mixed in the succe cocted with Honey;
and all brayed, subacted, and handled by hands anointed with oil together, till
they acquire a due consistence: They may also be rightly subacted with the
Eclegm of Cauls.

Pills of Hermodactyls potently evel crass and serous humors from all extreme
parts, Vires.
but especially from the articles; and conduce to the cold diseases of the
head, nerves, and junctures.

CHAP. 12. Pilulae Agregativae, seu Polychrestae; Agregative, or Pills of much
use. D. Mes.
of Aloes, Turbith, of each vj. of Diagridium v. of Rhabarb, and yellow
Myrabolans, of each iiij. of the whitest Agarick, Troch. Alhandal, Polypody,
Chebulan, and Indian Myrabolans, of each ij. Mastick, Rose-leaves, Dodder of
Thyme, Anise-seed, Ginger, Sal Gem, of each j. Juice of Egrimony and Wormwood,
of each ij. with the Syrup of the Juice of Damask-Roses, make it up into a
mass to keep.

The COMMENTARY.
We hold to the ancient description of Mesue, and change only the order of the
Simples, and substitute the Syrup of Roses, for the subaction of the
composition, in stead of the Electuary of Roses.

Mesue gives three descriptions of Pills of this name; the first whereof is
most usual, and prepared almost in all Shops; the other two, both greater and
lesser agregatives, are omitted. They are called agregative Pills, because of
the agregation of many faculties; as also Polychrestae, and Catholical, because
they are of much use, and expurge all humors.

The manner of their mixtion is manifest; the roots must be first brayed, then
the fruits, and afterward the seeds; only Rhabarb and Agarick must be
prepared apart, the Trochisks whereof are better then the simple. The succe of
Egrimony and Wormwood dried and brayed, must be added thereunto; then all being
duly pulverated, must be subacted into a mass, with the Syrup of pale Roses,
which must be involved in leather madefied with Oil of Almonds. And it is not
unreasonable, that the Powders should be received in the Syrup of pale Roses;
partly, because it accedes nearest the mind of the Author, for nothing is
liker Roses then Roses; and partly, because that Electuary of Roses, which
Mesue mentions, is not now made in shops, seeing its composition is inept, and
of no use.

Agregative Pills are not only conducible to many affections of the head, but
also of the Ventricle and Liver: Vires.
for from these parts they detract and purge pituity, Bile, and Melancholical
succe; and therefore help in complex and inveterate Fevers, and complicated
diseases. He may be without the Pills of eight things, and five kinds of
Myrabolambs, that has agregative ones.

CHAP. 13. Pilulae de Fumaria; or, Pills of Fumatory. D. Avic.
of Citrian, Chebulan, and Indian Myrabolans, Scammony prepared v. Aloes vij.
and with the Juice of Fumatory, make it into a mass; which when dried, let it
be again beaten up with the same Juice, and the third time with the Syrup of
Fumatory.

The COMMENTARY.
These Pills are denominated from Fumatory, in whose succe their Powders must
be twice or thrice imbuted, and then dried as often, according to their Authors
prescript; and at length received, not into the same succe, as many ignorantly
conjecture, but into honey, wherein this succe has been by longer coction
dissipated, or rather into the Syrup of Fumatory, which is better, and more
agreeable to the Authors mind: For unless the mass be subacted in the one of
these, or such a like liquor, the powders will soon arefie. The manner of their
preparation is easy, and apparent enough by the description.

Pills of Fumatory purge bilious and sharp humors, Vires.
salt phlegm, and other adust and melancholical humors, from which many vices
of the skin, as Scab, Itch, Tetters, and the like, arise.

CHAP. 14. Pilulae de Lapide Lazuli; or, Pills of the Azure-stone. D.Mes.
of Lapis Lazuli prepared vj. Polypody, Dodder of Thyme, Agarick, of each j.
black Hellebore, Scammony, Sal Gem. of each ij. ss. Cloves, Anise-seeds, of
each ss. Hierae Picrae xv. and with Syrupo Regis Saboris, make it into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
That every humor might have its peculiar Cathartick, we have exhibited these
Pills described by Mesue, to educe the melancholical humor. They are
denominated from the Azure-stone, which is their Basis; which participating of
some alien and vomitory quality, needs some antecedent preparation: but it must
not be burned, as in the confection of Alkermes, lest its purgative faculty
perish, but pulverated very small, and ten or twelve times washed, first in
common water, then in the water of Bugloss, or the like: after each lotion, it
must be dried, and these courses iterated, till it depose its vomitory quality,
and retain only its dejective and roborative.

Its manner of preparation, is all one with the former; we substitute gemmeous,
in stead of Indian salt, which we want; and King Sabors Syrup, in stead of the
water of Endive: for hereby the powders will be more commodiously subacted, and
the mass hence concinnated, more safely kept, of a better consistence, more
excellent faculties, and more apt to educe Melancholical humors.

These Pills help the Leprosy, Canker, quartane Fever, Vires.
and all diseases that arise from Melancholical humors, or adust Bile; their
faculties are the same, but better then the Pills of Indies have, which such
may want as keep these.

CHAP. 15. Pilulae Asajeret. D. Avic.
of Mastick, yellow Myrabolans, of each ss. Hierae Picrae j. of the best Aloes
ij. and with Syrup of Stoechados, make it into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
These Pills are also desumed from Avicenna, who calls them sometimes
Asahajaret, sometimes Sejar; and prescribes them partly to the head, partly to
the ventricle: but they draw little from parts more remote, seeing they admit
not of such things as potently deduce cold humors.

The powder of Galens Hiera Picra must be desumed to their confection, and not
Hiera in form of an Electuary: The Myrabolambs may be purged from their stones,
and brayed apart; then Chian Mastick, then the Aloes; all must be received in
the Syrup of Stoechas, and made into a mass.

These Pills are indeed chalagogous, and much profit the impure and languid
ventricle; and by consequence, benefit the head, and cure such affections as
arise from some sympathy with the stomach, and lowest ventricle.

Pills of Hiera being almost of the same faculties, Vires.
and easy to be made of the powder of Hiera (which is kept in all
Pharmacopolies) by the addition of the Honey of Roses, or the like, in a
sufficient quantity, need no particular description; nor those also which take
both their name and matter from Benedicta, which are seldom or never used; for
they are only nominally eximious, as many Chemical confections, as Aqua
Benedicta, Spiritus Aureus, Elixir Vitae, etc.

CHAP. 16. Pilulae Alephanginae; or, Aromatical or sweet Pills.
Cinnamon, Cloves, Cardamomes, Nutmegs, Mace, Calamus Aromaticus; Galangal,
yellow Sanders, Squinant, Rose-leaves, of each ss.

These must be brayed pretty crassly, and macerated twelve hours in four pounds
of water; then boyl^d on a slow fire, till the third part be absumed: one pound
of Aloes must be dissolved in the colature; and when the aqueous humidity is
spent by hot ashes, Sun, or an Hypocauste, add

Myrrh, Mastick, of each ss. Saffron ij. Syrup of Wormwood, as much as will
suffice to make it into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
We retain a great part of the materials of sweet Pills described by Mesue: but
we have added Galangal, as most convenient, and detracted the most rare and
dear ingredients, as Carpo-balsamum, Xylo-aloes, Cubebs, and the useless ones,
as Asarum. We do not allow of Aloes washed in rainwater, because it makes it
imbecile: neither do we approve of the quantity of Aromata's and water, wherein
they should be cocted, as defined by Mesue: for seeing Aromata's endure not
coction, without the loss of their virtues; what need is there of cocting them
in twelve pounds of water, to the absumption of seven pounds thereof? This is
useless and noxious labor: but if they must be only lightly cocted, to what
end is so much water? and if the third part of the water will serve, why not
the third part of the Aromata's also?

In this our description, we have the faculties and virtues of the third part
of the Aromata's, better then we should have them out of the whole designed by
Mesue, and confected after his rite, who with the absumption of the water,
absumes more of the Aromata's faculties: We have in stead of Wormwood,
substituted its Syrup, for the better coalition of the mass, lest it grow too
dry, or contract chinks and marcour.

Thus we have castigated Mesue's sweet Pills, or rather exhibited our own,
which are easier to make, better, and of lesser charges: to which, if the maker
shall put a little of the liquor of Balm, they shall exceed all Pills in
roborating the stomach.

Sweet Pills are most customachical, Vires.
and roborate the nervous parts best: for they at once purge crass, putrid,
pituitous, and bilious humors from the ventricle and vicine parts, and
recreate the same; preserve native heat, help coction, discuss flatulency,
dispel crudities, resarciate appetite, help cholical dolours, and conduce to

of Aloes, Coloquintida, Scammony prepared, black Hellebore, Bdellium, Gum
Arabic, of each ij. Euphorbium, Nitre, of each j. and with Juice of Coleworts
or Rhodomel, make it up into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
The later age retains the old description of Tralian's Pills, but not the
name: for one calls them Pills of Coloquintida, another of Nitre; and this puts
more of Nitre in them, the other more of Coloquintida. But seeing reason and
use have better approved of the weight of simples described by the more Recent,
we shall follow the Ancients in the materials, but the Recents in the
proportion and weight of these materials.

Now for their confection, prepared Coloquintida, that is, Trochisks of
Alhandal, must be taken. Bdellium must be dissolved, percolated, and cocted in
the calified succe of Brassica, till the succe be consumed; then must the rest
be mixed, and a sufficient quantity of the Honey of Roses mixed with them:
Euphorbium must not, by the advice of many, be added to the mixture, till thus
prepared.

Some quantity of Euphorbium must be taken, pulverated small, with a little Oil
of Almonds rubbed on a stone; like many Collyries; then collected and included
in a Quince excavated, and obvolved with paste; then cocted in a furnace like
Scammony: and thus cocted and repared, preposed for use.

Pills of Nitre move frigid, crass, and viscid humors, Vires.
from parts more remote: whence they conduce in nervous affections, and help
the had laden with contumacious diseases; as also the Epilepsie, Palsy,
Vertigo, and affections of the articles, because they educe both flave and
black Bile: some believe they are good against the Indian disease, and thence
too licentiously call them Indian Pills.

CHAP. 18. Piluae Mechoacanae.
of Mechoacan ss. Turbith iij. Spurge-olive macerated in vinegar and dried, the
seeds of Dwarf-Elder, Agarick trochiskized, of each ij. the roots of Esula.
Milwort prepared, Mastick, of each j. ss. Cinnamon, and Sal Gem, of each ij.

Let them all be made into powder, that same subacted into a mass with
white wind; then let that be dried and brayed, and again coagulated with the
succe of the celestial Orris, which dry, and bray again; and then make into
paste with the Syrup of Damask-Roses, and repose it for use.

The COMMENTARY.
Practical Medicks seek out of Dispensatories, as out of a foecund and fertile
Garden, all kinds of Medicaments, for the deletion of all diseases; but they
find a great part of them described without Art or Reason, and only
convenient for few diseases: yea, sometimes ten Medicaments endued with the
same faculties, and discriminated only by diverse names. But we have, according
to the diversities of diseases and humors, tradited diverse Medicaments,
desumed not only out of vulgar Dispensatories, but out of the Writings of many
grave men: besides which, we do also exhibit some, proved salutiferous by
Reason, Experience, and successful Event; as these Pills prescribed for the
Dropsy, which having Mechoacan for their Basis, from thence mutuate their
denomination, which is of Simples most praepollent, for educing water by stool.
Besides which, there are five more Hydragogous Ingredients, which being all
united together, with some cordial and stomachical ones, potently educe serous
and watery humors, without laesion of the ventricle, not only from the Belly,
but all parts of the Body. I shall not need to add the seeds of Keruy, or
Palma Christi, and Soldanella, seeing these are enough; nor yet subjoyn the
manner of their preparation, seeing it is very easy.

These Pills educing potently aqueous and serous humors, Vires.
cure the Dropsy, and all diseases arising from watery phlegm.

CHAP. 19. Pilulae Foetidae. D. Mes.
of Sagapenum Ammoniacum, Opoponax, Bdellium, Coloquintida, Rue-seed, Aloes,
Epithimus () Esula.
Dodder of Thyme, of each v. Turbith ss. Sca^mony iij. () Milkwort, or
Seaspurge prepared, Hermodacts, of each ij. Ginger j. ss. Cinnamon, Spikenard,
Saffron, Castoreum, of each j. Euphorbium ij. Dissolve the gummes in the Juice
of Leeks, and with it make the powders into a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
They are called foetid Pills, not because they educe foetid humors, as some
think, but because they consist of foetid Medicaments; as Beavers-stones, wild
Rue, Sagapene, Opoponax, and the like. Rhasis, and other Arabians, give other
descriptions of them; but we retain this only as the best, which Mesue calls
the greater, in reference to a lesser description, which we omitted; as less
efficacious.

None, I believe, doubt, whether the seed of wild Rue, or of Hemlock, should
rather ingrede the composition of foetid Pills: for doubtless, Hemlock-seed is
poison; though one Constantinus interprets the Arabian words Harmeli, or
Harmela, Hemlock-seed, when all others say they are wild Rue-seed; in whose
stead, vulgar Ruesseed may be well substituted.

The Hermodactyls should be exotical, whose roots are tubeous and crass, not
rugose; which by small contusion might be reduced to farinaceous powder.

They act perperously, who take Ephemerian, or Colchian, or our Hermodactyls,
whose roots are flaccid; for their qualities are not commendable, but noxious,
killing by small and short suffocation: whence they are called Strangulatories.
The best Hermodactyl comes from Syria, and is thence called the Syrian
Hermodactyl. Esula should be prepared as we have taught before; the Gummes must
be melted, percolated, and cocted in the succe of Leeks; and the Powders must
be adjected, mixed, and subacted with these, which must be handled with hands
madefied with Oil of Almonds, involved in Leather, and reposed in a Tin-box for
use.

Foetid Pills are of much use, for they evacuate frigid, pituitous, Vires.
crude, and also bilious humors; and thence cure such affections as arise from
thence; as the diseases of the Junctures, Podagry, Gonagry, Dolours in the
Backbone, Leprosy, Morphews, Itch, cutaneous infections, and cholical
affections.

Sassafras, Mosch, of each ss. Honey despumed in the decoction of Guaiacum, and

make it into a mass, anointing it with a little Oil of Turpentine, and wrapping
it in a little Bladder for future use.

The COMMENTARY.
That our Antidotary might not be defective, we have not only elicited
Medicaments out of the Monuments of the Ancients, but out of the Writings and
Notes of Neotericks, selected and culled what reason and successful event have
celebrated; as these Pills of Quicksilver, which the Neotericks usurp, to the
expugnation of a new disease: For it is just, that new diseases should have new
remedies invented by Reason, and prepared by Art; especially if the inventions
of the Ancients fail and prove useless.

Now none, I think, will deny, that the French disease is new, seeing it was
never heard of in Europe, before the year 1493. but then brought by
Christophorus Columbus, and his associates, from India to Italy, and there
communicated to the Italian women; who bringing victuals to the French
Soldiers in the Neapolitan siege, with their bodies communicated their disease
to the men; which the men retaining after conquest, gave also to other Italian
women: from whom their returning husbands, persolving the debt of Matrimony,
caught it of their own wives, who had got it of the Frenchmen, the French of
Italian women, and they of Columbus his Soldiers.

Hence the Italians were wroth with the French, and in revenge call their
disease, The French Pox; and ridiculously make their Books-fronts proclaim
Ultion, by denoting the husbands Ignorance, and the wives Whoredom: their
Ignorance, in that they knew not the venereous Pox; the women's Whoredom, in
that they had concourse with the French.

Brassavolus, as it should seem, mindeful of this injury done to his Parents,
wrote a certain book of this disease, which he calls The French Pox; wherein he
assigns 234 differences thereof: certainly either the honest man there played
the Babbler, or else so many of his acquaintance and kinswomen were compressed
by the French soldiers, who left these Hieroglyphical characters, as eternal
signs of their new and quaint marriages. But to my purpose. There are various
preparations of the pills of Quicksilver; for each Confectioner and Surgeon
almost, have their peculiar descriptions, which they keep for hidden Secrets;
some whereof will only by reiteration, move salivation; others frequently
usurped, will a little subduce the Belly: but all of them often iterated, move
sputation, hurt the nerves, and sometimes cause strangulation. Their use
therefore is not safe, unless the Quicksilver be well prepared and castigated,
by the admistion of other Medicaments, as Turpentine-Oyl, or such things as we
have in this prescript described: The manner of whose preparation is apparent
enough by the form; but there are other compounds that admit of Quicksilver: of
which hereafter.

These Pills are Catholical, Vires.
and Alexiterial, seeing they expurge all humors at once, and evince the
malign quality of the French Pox, and radically evel its Vestigia impressed on
the parts affected.

CHAP. 21. What Pills a Pharmacopoly may be without.
AS in Civil Law, many old Laws are obsolete, and of no use and vigor to a
Magistrate: so in Medicine, many ancient Medicaments are either neglected, or
quite disapproved of, as noxious, or at least useless. Some are omitted,
because there are others of the same, or like efficacy and virtue, whereof the
best is selected; for it were a sign of folly in a man, if he should prepare
and keep all the Medicaments Myrepsus has designed, who absolving his Work in
1100 Chapters, has conjoined two or three descriptions in one Chapter.

Yea, neither Medicks desire, nor Diseases require, that any Apothecary should
make and keep all the Medicaments that Aetius, Actuarius, or Praepositus, and
others, describe, but only the more secure, selected, and approved.

Thus in our Antidotary we give only eximious ones; which if Authors
suppeditate not, as they do not for all diseases, we compensate by our own
labor and industry, suggesting the most approved.

We expunge those out of the number of Pills, which they call the greater and
lesser Pills of Light, because they consist of much and unapt matter: And
because Pills, sine quibus, are of efficacy enough for the affections of the
eyes; we have omitted the ancient description of the Imperials, of the five
kinds of Myrobalambs, of the eight Ingredients, and the Arabians Pills, because
the agregative are better, and useful for all such things as the aforesaid are
prescribed for.

We have neglected the Indian Pills, and them of the stone Armentum, because
them of the Azure-stone are affine to them, and more efficacious.

We weigh not the Pills of Rhabarb, because ignave, but give them of Egrimony,
as more efficacious; with whom they have affinity.

Pills of Hermodactyls exclude the arthretical Pills; and the foetid Pills
exclude those that are denominated from Sagapene, Euphorbium, and Sarcocolla.

Pills of Mechoacan make them void, which consists of Esula and Mezereon.

Benedict Pills, and Hiera, may be made at any time, seeing powders are or
should be always in readiness in shops: whereof either Electuaries or Pills
may be confected at pleasure.

Pills of Bdellium are quite neglected, because they are scarce purgative: in
stead, other better, and more roborative Medicaments, easier to be made, may be
confected for present use.

I pretermit many more, as unworthy to be named or used; for many men describe
many Medicaments, not so much that they consult others sanity, as the
augmenting of their Dispensatories grand bulk.

Cathartical Powders being ungrateful, are usually coagmented into liquid or
solid Electuaries, or else Pills: yet Empiricks give the powder of Stibium
only in a little Wine, or other liquor; as also the powder of Mercury,
wherewith a veneficous Circulator at Lutetia promised the cure of all diseases,
openly professing himself a Prophet: but the wretch went about many Cities, to
see whom he might devour: he is not worthy to be named. At last he ran away.

All prepare not Quicksilver or Mercury alike: for some include it with Aqua
fortis in a Matracy, and exhale the water by sublimation, calling that which
remains in the bottom, Powder of Mercury: It is of a yellowish red color, and
rather caustical then cathartical.

Others prepare it otherwise, but better, thus: They immerge Quicksilver in
Aqua fortis, whereinto they inject Brine; then they let the Quicksilver reside,
and the water is ejected by inclination; and the crassament that remains, which
is whitish, is called Powder of Mercury. But in what proportion it should be
mixed, how it may be perfectly dealbated, and with what virtue it is endued, I
need not recenseate, lest Empiricks and Pseudopharmacopoeans abuse it: but if
it be made as P. Pijardus, a learned Parisian Medick taught, its virtues are
eximious and efficacious in curing some Diseases, which will not yield to
vulgar Medicaments.

An APPENDIX. Of some Pills not Solutive.
EAch Medicament is by singular dexterity and ingenuity, effinged into a form
proper for the diseased. Thus some Purgatives are liquid, others solid, and
others in a mean: some Medicaments only purge, others only roborate, and
others alter, and some perform all: but Pills are for the most part purgative;
for all of them, except a few, subduce the Belly, and are exhibited especially
when supervacaneous succes are to be educed from remote parts: for in such a
form and consistence, they abide longer in the ventricle, and their virtue is
more easily carried to the parts diseased, and oppressed with excrementitious
humors. When therefore we would have a Medicament stay longer in the
ventricle, we give it in a solid form; and such are not only the prescribed
purgative Pills, but the Hypnotical and Arterial ones that follow.

CHAP. 22. Pilulae de Cynoglosso; or, Pills of Dogs-tongue.
of Myrrh vj. Olibanum v. the root of Hounds-tongue, Henbaneseed, Opium, of
each iij. Saffron, Castoreum, of each j. ss. and with Syrup of Stoechados,
make it up into a mass, which let be conveniently reposed for use.

The COMMENTARY.
The Neotericks have retained the old description, but not the name of these
Pills: for Mesue their Author calls them from their effect, Pills for all
diseases; but these call them Pills of Cynogloss, which is neither for quantity
nor quality prepollent therein: perhaps they mistake Cynogloss for Arnogloss,
which might more properly give them denomination; for seeing Mesue described
them for astriction, Arnogloss being of an astrictive quality, was more
convenient; but we, with Fernelius, admit of the new name, and add Castorium
for the castigation of Opium: But we think, that Rhodostagm or Rose Water, is
altogether inconvenient for the receipt of the powders, if we would have the
mass of a legitimate consistence, or fit to be kept; and we substitute in its
stead Syrup of Stcechados, by whose quality the head will be roborated, and
armed against the nocuments of Opium, and by its lentour the powders will be
coacted into a more idoneous mass: as for its confection, the root of Cynogloss
must first be brayed with the seed of Henbane, and then the other simples
apart; the brayed Opium must be first subacted by the Syrup, then the other
powders must be mixed, and coacted into a mass.

They conciliate sleep, stay Catarrhs, distillations of the head, Vires.
the Cough, and such succedent affections: for they cohibit all distillations,
whether upon the Breast and Lungs, or Teeth, or elsewhere.

CHAP. 23. Of Laudanum.
NOt many years ago, there arose a company of Pseudo-Medicks, who in stead of
the usual Pills of Cynogloss, exhibited a certain confection, which they called
Laudanum; whereby they promised not only to conciliate sleep, but abigate all
diseases. I then saw a Circulator, who boasted by his Laudanum, to revoke men
almost exanimated or half dead, and man the Encomium of this Medicine so won
upon men, that no Empirick so stupid, no Medicaster so dull, nor Tonsor so
plebeious, but he was a Laudanister, or else not worth flaming.

I wooed some with prayers, some with price, to tell me this Medicament; but
found amongst twenty of its descriptions, not one like another: yea, he that
was most ignorant, would profess he had the best.

But I heard some Mountebanks exhibit Pills of Cynogloss for Laudanum,
extorting for each Pill the weight of half a scruple in gold. And thus were the
credulous Plebeians, drawn with new names, and unusual words, circumvented by
the subtilty of these rafrous Juglers.

The descriptions of Laudanum given by more perite Alchymists, are seldom and
hardly made; for they consist of the best of Gems, Hyacinths, and Corals; of
the essence of Saffron and Opium; of the Oils of Cinnamon, Cloves; Liquor of
Margarites, Powder of Unicorns-horn, of the Bezar-stone, Amber-grise, and other
precious stones: and doubtless a confection of these materials must needs be
eximious: and I approve of the learned rich Alchymists acts, who make, keep,
and exhibit this to the diseased: but alas! the improbous do so impose upon us,
that we can scarce give the honest and good. I saw a certain Laudanum exhibited
by a learned Princely Medick, which wrought happy effects.

This sequel one is eximious, and easy to be made.

of the extract of the Pills of Hounds-tongue ij. Laudanum. Androm.
the extract of the Roman Philonium, and T^ed^le, of each j. Amber, Mosch, of
each ss. Bezoar-stone, Monoceros born, of each gr. vj. Saffron j. and with oy
of Cloves make it up into Laud^^^m.

There might be innumerable descriptions thereof given: for every one, though
meanly learned, strives to add or detract at pleasure; either for the fame, or
imitation of other opiate Medicaments, as of Philonium, by which name Crato
designed Laudanum, which he held to be nothing but a certain Philo^ium, which
many Alchymists take for the basis of their Laudanum; and by adding
magis^eries, essences, and tin^^^es, make an hypnotical Medicament, more
commendable then the vulgar Philonium. But I admire most, that every one
changes the form of his Medicament, and that none can know which is the
genuine, true, and best description thereof: which some take from Paracelsus,
others from Keckius; some from Andernacus, others from Brunerius; and others
from others: and always change something, that they may be thought the first
Authors. I could here adduce many descriptions, but it would be useless labor.
The Chemists call it Laudanum, as though it were the most laudable Medicament;
which they sometimes call also Nepenthe.

Of Bechicall Pills. CHAP. 24. Pill. Bechicae Nigrae; or, black Bechical Pills.

of the jayce of Liquorice, white Sugar, of each vj. Starch, Tragacanth, sweet
Almonds, blanched and beaten, of each iij. and with the the musilidge of Quince
seeds made in Rose water, make thereof a mass.

The COMMENTARY.
This mass is not kept whole, after the manner of other pills, but divided into
particles, of a whole or half scruples weight; which are after formed at
pleasure, one while into triangular or multifatious Trochisks; another while
into round lumps or Pills: whence some refer them to Pastils, others to Pills.
But seeing they should be holden under the tongue, a sphaerical form is most
convenient for them, for so they may be abvolved all over, and liquefie in all
the parts of the mouth. For which use, other Trochisks may be made, as we have
showed in the twentieth Chapter, first Section and fifth Bo^^ of our
Institutions. The manner of their confection is easy. Decorticated Almonds
must first be minutely incided with a Knife, then levigated on a Marble: then
Amylum and Sugar must be taken: afterward the succe of Liquorice must be
brayed in a pretty hot metalline mortar; then Tragacanthum: let all then be
made with the Mucago, into some paste, whereof plain Pills may be made, dried
and kept.

Black Bechical Pills, cure dry coughs, Vires.
arising from sharp and calid matter, as also asperity, and hoarseness, and
hard excretion of the beart, as Mesue shows (cap. de tussil. in sua praxi.)

CHAP. 25. Pil. Bechicaealbae; or, white Bechical Pills.

Pennidees, of each iiij. white Sugar lb j. and with the Musilidge of Gum
Thraganth extracted in Rose water, make a mass, which form into rowles and
Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
Seeing the Author of these Pills is uncertain, every one does at will change
their description, by adding or detracting something. ^ut we have exhibited the
most usual form whereby Pills that are Bechical, grateful and white may be
made: the manner whereof is well known to all.

They are much commended for leniating the asperity of the jaws, Vires.
outing cough and hoarseness, and moving spittle.

Thus I think I have sufficiently described, not only all forms of purgative
Medicaments, but purgative necessary in a Pharmacopoly. It now remains that in
the sequent Book I describe Roboratives and Alteratives.

Finis Libri Secundi.
The Apothecaries Shop, OR, ANTIDOTARY. THE THIRD BOOK. Of ROBORATIVE
MEDICAMENTS, Distinct in three SECTIONS. The first whereof Treats of more
select Cordial Powders.
THE PREFACE.
SCarce any Medicament is of a solitary faculty, but it either purges or
roborates, and alters withal; but the denomination is desumed from the
prepollent faculty: and that which roborates more, and alters less, is called a
Roborative; that which alters more, and roborates less, an Alterative. We shall
treat of both, not only in the same confection, consisting of (...) qualities
but apart, and in diverse Chapters, in this Third Book; because there is much
affinity betwixt these Medicaments, both in qualities, consist^^ce, and manner
of preparation. The Roman Philoniom, and the confection of Hyacinth, have the
same preparation and consistence, and are both described amongst Roboratives;
yet the former is called an Alterative. Now that we may in just order describe
all the Roboratives, we shall begin with the most select Cordial Powders;
^^rtly, at they are described by famous Medicks; partly, as established by our
invention, and approved by long experience. Of what use aromatical and other
Powders are in Medicinal assumptions, applications, or compositions, we have at
large showed, in Chap. 9. Sect. 1. and Book 3. of our Institutions.

CHAP. 1. Diamargaritum frigidum. D. Platearii.
of pellucid Pearls iij. the four greater cool seeds picked, the seeds of
Purslain, and white Poppy, white and yellow Sanders, Lignum Aloes, Ginger, red
Roses, the flowers of Water Lillies, Borrage, Myrtle-berries, of each j. white
and red Coral, of each ss. make of all these a fine powder, which let be kept
in a glass with a narrow orifice.

The COMMENTARY.
Aromatical or Cordial Powders, are either kept alone in a fit vessel well
operculated, that their faculties may not expire; or with Honey solved into a
liquid Electuary; or with Sugar cocted into a solid Electuary or Tabels. They
are kept alone in shops, that a part of them, when use requires, may be
dissolved into applicative Medicaments, or mixed with introsumptive ones.

This powder, which is denominated from Pearl, is so variously described, that
its Author is not known, but every one changes it variously at will: This
though, which we have exhibited out of Platerius, is by most learned Writings
attested the most genuine.

And it is called frigid Diamargaritum, to difference it from another, which is
hotter, but made of few of none: it is also called the compounded
Diamargaritum, in reference to Manus Christi, which consists only of the Sugar
of Roses, and of Pearls. There is yet another compounded one, which admits of
many precious Stones, Amber, and Musk; but differing from the Electuary of
Gemmes, only in that it refrigerates more. It is seldom made.

The preparation of Diamargaritum is most in triture, whereof we have largely
treated in our Institutions. Pearls are oriental and pellucid, which are proved
by their candor, rotundity, smoothness, weight, and magnitude. Those that are
ponderous and crass, are called vinous: which because of their rarity and
value, seldom ingrede Medicinal Compositions; they should, like Coral, be
ducted, and levigated upon a Purple-stone: The four cold seeds must be minutely
incided, and pulverated very small; then the rest, and all confusedly mixed at
last.

Diamargaritum is most efficacious to resartiate strength, Vires.
take away swoundings, to help difficult breathers, to coct the cough, to
refresh the tabid, to recreate the languisher, and to recuperate ones former
state.

CHAP. 2. Electuarium de Gemmis; or, The Electuary of Gemmes. D.Mes.
of pellucid Pearls ij. of the fragments of the Saphyr, Hyacinth, Sardis,
Granate, Smaragdi, of each j.ss. of Setwell, and Aarons roots, Citron Pills,
Mace, Basil-seeds, of each ij. red Coral, Amber, the shavings of Ivory, of each
ij. both the Beans, Cloves, Ginger, Long-Pepper, Spikenard, Indian Leaf,
Saffron, Cardamomes, of each j. Troch. Diarrhodon, Aloes wood, of each v.
Cinnamon, Galangal, of each j. ss. the leafs of Gold and Silver, of each ij.
Mosch ss. make of these a very fine powder.

The COMMENTARY.
This composition is kept either in form of a powder, or of an Electuary; and
that either soft, consisting of an equal quantity of powders, and of honey of
Roses; or solid, consisting of the same, and Sugar of Roses: but it is most
commodious, to keep its powder well occluded in fit vessels for future uses.

It takes its name from the Gems or precious stones, of which it is made, with
the vulgar, and others rare and unknown cordials, whose faculties cannot be
well learned from the Ancients or Neotericks, as appears by the examination we
had of Been: in whose stead, we substitute Enula-Campana's roots, both roots
being pastinacious, cordial, and hotter then Bugloss or Borrage, which some
take for both the Beens: the root also of Tormentil may be substituted in stead
of each Been. But I do not fancy their humors, who in composition of this
solemn Electuary, usurp those exoticall roots designed by the name of the two
Beens; for either Tormentil alone, or Enula alone, or an equal quantity of
each, may be much better assumed for both Beens: and if any one would rather
have Angelica's root, then that of Enula, he may.

The preparation of this powder, consists in idoneus triture; the Gemmes and
Corals must be levigated on a purple stone; the roots, woods, and fruits brayed
in a mortar, and all at length commixed.

The Electuary of Gems is most efficacious for the cold affections of the
brain, heart, ventricle, liver, and uterus, according to Mesue: for it helps
the melancholical, sad, solitary, and fearful; it cures the palpitation of the
heart, hinders swounding, roborates the languid ventricle, and recreates all
the intrails: but Apothecaries seldom make it, because of the rarity and
dearness of the simples that ingrede its composition.

CHAP. 3. Diambra Dom. Mes.
of Cinnamon, supposed Wolfs-bane, Cloves, Mace, Nutmegs, Indian leaf, Galangal,
of each iij. Long Pepper, yellow Sanders, Aloes wood, of each ij. Ginger j. ss.
both the Cardamomes, Spikenard, Amber of each j. Mosch ss. make of all these a
fine powder, and so kept for use.

The COMMENTARY.
This compound is very aromatical and sweet, both because of the Amber, from
which it is denominated, and of the Musk, and other Aromata's that ingrede it.
It is kept either in form of a powder, or of a solid Electuary, or of Honey: if
it be required of a hard consistence, as that of Tabels, its powder must be
received into Sugar of Roses perfectly cocted; if soft, like that of Opiates,
its powders must be received into the Julep of Roses, or Alexandrian Syrup.

Its preparation is only pulveration; which must be effected as we have
demonstrated in the 9 and 10 Chap. and 2 Book of our Institutions.

Diambra does most efficaciously roborate the bowels, Vires.
especially if their imbecility be from a cold cause: for by calefaction it
refects the spirits, and foments the native heat; it helps the affections of
the Uterus, and is very convenient for old men and women.

CHAP. 4. Pilvis Diamoschi.
of Mosch ss. the bone of the heart of a Heart, pellucid Pearl, shavings of
Ivory, white and red Coral, white and yellow Sanders, Aloes wood, Cinnamon,
Mace, and Cloves, of each j. Rose-leaves, Water Lillies, of each j.ss.
Citron-pill, Bugloss-flowers, Spikenard, of each ss. Camphyr gr. ij. make of
these a fine powder according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Vulgar Pharmacopolitan Dispensatories abound with many cordial, but intensely
calefactive Powders, and very few refrigeratives, consisting only of all
kinds of hot Aromata's, promiscuously and confusedly agregated without choice
or care: Of which sort, the two last descriptions (as tradited by the Ancients)
were, and many more, which occur in each Antidotary, are: for, Diacyminum,
Dianisum, Diazinziber, Diatrium Pipereon, Diamargaritum calidum, Diamoschum;
both sweet and amare, produce all the same effects, having all the same
faculties, as compounded all of hot Aromata's. Wherefore I have not only
castigated, but neglected the antique description of Diamoschum, and
substituted another, which well refers the reason of its name and composition,
conducing to imbecility wrought by a hot cause: for it seemed to me
superfluous, to retain the ancient description of Diamoschum, when Diambra, and
the Electuary of Gems pollicitate the same effects: Therefore I have exhibited
another most fragrant Diamoschum, very efficacious in curing hot distempers,
and easily preparable.

Sweet Diamoschum, Vires.
consisting of many Cordials, exhilarates the noble parts, especially the heart
and vital faculties, made languid or imbecile from any, but mainly a hot cause:
It conduces also to many affections of the Uterus.

CHAP. 5. Pulvis Electuarii Triasantali; or, The species for the Electuary of
the three Sanders.
of the three Sanders, Rose-leaves, Fleabit-seed, of each ij. Rhabarb, shavings
of Ivory, Juice of Liquorice, Purslain-seed, of each j.ss. Starch, Gum
Thraganth, Arabic, the four greater cool seeds, Endive seed, of each j.
Camphyr ss. make of these according to Art a Powder.

The COMMENTARY.
Amongst twenty descriptions of this composition, I have not found two alike:
for some in stead of Zuccaria, put Hemlock-seed, as Joubertus; others the seeds
of Psyllium, as Foefius; others omit both, as Cordus; others will have
Sugar Candy; and others Violets, as Euchsius.

There is the same diffidence about Rhabarb, Amylum, and Camphyr; which some
reject, others add. I have with the consent also of learned Authors, described
this form, and added Psyllium as very convenient: but I have expunged Amylum as
unapt; for its viscidity obstructs: Camphyr I admit, that by its tenuity it may
introduce the crasser Medicaments: but I have detracted from its quantity, lest
by its graveolence, it should obtund or deleate the suavity of the Aromata's,
which are but few.

I also allow of Tragacanthum and Arabic, which should be alittle assated
before commixtion, that they may depose their viscidity, and become more
convenient for the Authors intention, who, whatever he was, aimed this
Medicament partly to roborate, and partly to resolve obstructions.

Its preparation is like the former's, depending on due triture.

It mirificously conduces to the freeing the liver from obstructions: Vires.
it helps such as have the jaundies, or are tabid, or troubled with immoderate
heat in their bowels; it allayes also the heat of the ventricle, frees the
first region of the body from infarctures, and vindicates the humors from
putretude.

CHAP. 6. Aromat. Rosatum; or, an Aromatical composition of Roses. D. Gabriel.
of Rose-leaves xv. Liquorice vij. choice Cinnamon v. Aloeswood, Machazari and
Citrini.
yellow Sanders, of each iij. Gum Arabic, Thraganth, of each ij. and ij.
Cloves and Mace, of each ij. ss. Spikenard ij. Nutmegs, Cardamomes the greater,
Galangal the lesser, of each j. Amber ij. Mosch j. make of these a Powder.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue describes many cordial and suaveolent Electuaries, but more especially
six, which he calls aromatical; out of which I have selected this one: and he
that has this, may easily be without the rest.

It is called Aromaticum, from the Aromata's whereof it consists, and Rosatum,
from its Roses, which are therein prepollent both in quantity and quality: It
is cognominated from one Gabriel, it is probable its Author, or Mesue's friend.
But however, the description is good, and its use salutary.

It is kept in form of a Powder, which is easily made; or of a soft Electuary,
which is effected, by admitting it to an equal quantity of the Syrup of Roses,
and of Orange-pill. But it is most usually had in form of a tabellated
Electuary, the Powders being cocted in Sugar.

It roborates the brain, heart, ventricle, and the inferior Belly; Vires.
dissipating the excrementitious humidity of their parts: it corrects all
putretude, excites appetite, helps coction, abates loathsomness and vomiting,
and is very good for such as are weak, and newly recovered from a disease.

CHAP. 7. Diarrhodon Abbatis. D. N. Salern.
of Rose-leaves, Sugar Candy, of each iij. white and yellow Sanders, of each
ij.ss. Gum Thraganth, Arabic, shavings of Ivory, of each ij. Mace, Lavender,
Mastick, Cardamomes, Saffron, Aloeswood, Cloves, Gallia Moschata, Cinnamon, I
wonder what that does there.
Rhabarb, Juice of Liquorice, the seeds of Anise, Fennel, Basil, Berberries,
Endive, Purslain, white Poppies, the greater cool seeds, of each j. the bone in
the heart of a Heart, the best Pearl, of each ss. Mosch gr. iiij. Campyr gr. ij.
make of these a Powder.

The COMMENTARY.
This solemn composition has also undergone castigation; for from its first
description tradited, Nic. Myrepsus, Nic. Salernitanus has detracted Coral,
Lettice, and Mandrake-seeds: Nic. Praepositus following the castigation of
Salernitanus, neither mentions the Corrector nor the Author. Nic. Myrepsus
attributes the invention thereof to one Abbas, a President of a certain
College: and seeing no famous Medicament goes through many hands without
mutation, no wonder if Abbas his Diarrhodum be not always described alike; in
whose composition, Sylvius admits not of Musk, nor Rondeletius of Rhabarb, nor
I of Asarum, because it is vomitory, and an enemy to the stomach; in whose
stead I have substituted Mace. Some admit only the grains of Berberries-seeds;
others, and better, the whole seeds: the four frigid seeds being easily
corruptible, should not be commixed till the time of use; if it be required in
form of a solid Electuary, the powders must be excepted in Sugar of Roses
perfectly cocted.

Diarrhodon roborates the Ventricle and Liver, Vires.
helps coction, ^^cites appetite, discusses flatulency, cohibits belching,
makes the breath sweet, allayes the heat of the bowels, and emends all vices in
the body arising from heat.

CHAP. 8. Pulvi^ latificans; or, A laetificant Powder of an uncertain Author.
of Basil-seed, Saffron, Setwel, yellow Sanders, Cloves, Citron-pill, Galangal,
Mace, Nutmegs, Storax, of each ij.ss. shavings of Ivory, Anise-seed, Dodder of
Thyme, Thyme, of each j. Amber, Mosch, Pearl, the bone in the heart of a Heart,
of each ss. Leafs of Gold and Silver, of each ss. make of them all a Powder
according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
There are two descriptions of this name; one given by Rhasis, which is seldom
made; the other by an uncertain Author, which we have transcribed out of
Praepositus as better. They err, that attribute this confection to Galen; for
it is not contained in his Works, neither did he know many of its ingredients,
as Musk, Camphyr, Amber, and Pearls.

It is alled the laetificant, or Powder of gladness, from its effect; for it
laetificates the heart and spirits: we have expunged Balmwood out of its
confection, being very precious and rare, and in its stead substituted Citrian
Santal: Lentisks, and Aloes-wood are also good substitutes for Balm-wood; as
also for the Hatts heart-bone, its Horn: The rest being always in readiness,
need no substitutes. The preparation is the same with the precedents.

The laetificant Electuary denotes its eximious faculties by its name; it
laetificates the heart, and all the vital parts and faculties, Vires.
recreates the bowels, absumes excrementitious humors, dissipates flatulency,
and roborates the ventricle.

CHAP. 9. Pulvis Dianthos. D.N. Myr.
of the flowers of Rosemary j. of Rose-leaves, Violets, and Liquorice, of each
vj. Cloves, Lavender, Nutmegs, Galangal, Cinnamon, Ginger, Setwel, Mace,
Aloes-wood, Cardamomes, Anise-seed, and Dill-seed, of each iiij. make of these
a very fine Powder according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
The description of this Powder is desumed from Nic. Myrepsue, who put many
simples in less quantity, besides Rosemary; which Actuarius augmented, adding
Worm-seed. It desumes its name from the flowers of Rosemary, which are its
Basis, which by a certain Antonomasia are called Anthos, that is, the flower;
whence the Electuary is called Dianthos; whose preparation is without
difficulty: Pharmacopolists keep it usually in form of a Powder; and if it be
required in form of a soft Electuary, they put the Powders in Honey; if of a
solid one, they put them in the Sugar of Roses perfectly cocted, and make
Pastils thereof.

It is cordial, helping the Epilepsie, and Swoundings; Vires.
it universally auxiliates all imbecility of Body, but especially the
affections of the head.

CHAP. 10. Pulvis Dianisi; or, The compound Powder of Anise-seed.
of the seeds of Anise x. Liquorice, Mastick, of each ss. the seeds of Caraway
and Fennel, Mace, Galangal, Ginger, Cinnamon, of each ij. ss. the three Peppers,
Cassia Lignea, Sermountain-seed, Mountain-Calamint, of each j. the greater
Cardamomes, Cloves, Cubebs, Spikenard, Saffron, of each ij. and gr. v.
Sugar Candy ij. make of these a Powder.

The COMMENTARY.
This Powder is both usual and useful; whose description, as tradited by Mesue,
we retain; only expunging Bartram, and substituting Libistica and Sugar Candy,
for common Sugar: for Bartram being hot and sharp, and not aromatical, may well
be omitted; and Sugar Candy is more idoneous then common Sugar, for the
asservation of the Powders. Cubebs are small round fruits, adhering to long
pedicles, racemously congested; which some say are Galen's Carpesia, others
Dioscorides his wild Myrtles, and others the grains of a Willow-tree: but they
are none of these, and their description differs much from any such.

In Jaoa this fruit is called Cumuc, which the Incolists there so much
estimate, that they boil it before they sell it out, lest it should be sown,
and germinate elsewhere, as we have showed, Chap. 14. Sect. 3. Book 4. of our
Medicinal Materials.

Dianison cures the cold distemper of the ventricle, Vires.
caused by crude phlegm or flatulency: it cures diuturnal coughs, proceeding
from cold humors, and frees the bowels from obstructions.

CHAP. 11. Diacinnamomum; or, The compound Powder of Cinnamon. D.Mes.
of small Cinnamon xv. Cassia-wood, the root of Enula-campane, of each iiij.
Galangal vij. Cloves, Long-pepper, both the Cardamomes, Ginger, Mace, Nutmegs,
Aloes-wood, of each iij. Saffron j. Sugar v. Mosch ij. make of these a Powder
according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Of the Aromata's which this Powder admits, Cinnamon is most prepollent: which
is of two sorts; the one more tenuious and fragrant, which the Arabians call
Darcheni; the other more crass, and less odorate, which we call vulgar or
ligneous Cinnamon. We have depinged both their Histories, in Chap. 9. Sect. 3.
and Book 1. of our Medicinal Matter. The Neotericks, for more suavities sake,
prepare Diacinnamomum with Musk. Its preparation is no more but pulveration,
and the confused union of the Powders.

Diacinnamomum consisting wholly of hot and aromatical ingredients, Vires.
does miraculously resartiate strength, exhilarate the spirits, and cure all
affections proceeding from cold causes.

CHAP. 12. Lithontripticon; or, A Powder to break the Stone.
of the blood of a Buck-goat prepared j. the blood of a Hare burnt ss. the
roots of Sea-holly, Sowbread, Madder, Cyprus, Orris the Florentine, the seeds
of Gromwel and Saxafrage, Winter-cherries, of each ij. Lapis Spongiae,
Egge-shells burnt, the inward tunicle of the ventricle of a Hen,
Juniper Berries, Cardamomes, Cinnamon, Mace, of each j.ss. the seeds of
Smallage, Petroseline, Bishopweed, Asparagrass, Caraway, Carret, Hartwort,
Coriander, Citron, Mallows, Melon, Pepon, and Pimpinel, of each j. the Gum of
the Cherrytree ij. let them be all beaten, and made into a fine Powder.

The COMMENTARY.
We have rejected the old description of this Powder, which vulgar Apothecaries
call Lithontribon, because it receives many astrictives, and some things that
hinder its efficacy in breaking the stone, and extracting the sand of the
Reins; and others that are too rare and precious, or can never be had sincere:
in whose stead we give another Lithontripticon, most aptly composed, to break
the stone, expel sand, and cure other affections of the Reins and Bladder.

But before Goats-blood ingrede its composition, it should be thus prepared:
First, a Goat of four years old, or thereabouts, should be selected and
jugulated; the blood which comes out in the middle, must be put in an earthen
pot, for that which flows out first is too tenuious, the last too crass; then
the pot must be covered with a rare linen cloth, and exposed to the Sun, that
the blood may coagulate; the watery must be rejected, and the more crass
concreted blood dried, brayed, and kept in a glass vessel: they are too
superstitious, who will not kill the Goat, till the Sun be entering into Cancer,
and he have been nourished a long time with Saxifrage, Pimpinella, Smallage,
and the like; nor collect any, save the arterial blood: for though this
preparation be not useless, yet it is not necessary; nay, there can scarce be
such plenty of those plants they require got, as will nourish a Goat a long
time: and besides, his blood, whose pabulum is not changed, is as efficacious
for breaking the stone.

The Hares-blood newly extracted, must be so assated, that it turn not to
ashes, but may be pulverated. There is nothing besides in this preparation,
either difficult or operous.

This Powder taken in a little white wind, Vires.
or water of Pellitory of the wall, or such convenient liquor, will expel
stones and sand from the Reins, Bladder, and Ureters, and potently move Urine.

CHAP. 13. Pulvis Diacalaminthes; or, The compound Powder of Mint. D. N. Myr.
Mountain-Calamint, Peny-royal, black Pepper, the seeds of Massilian Seseleos.
Hartwort, and Parsley, of each iij. and ij. the seeds of Sermountain, () Ameos.
Bishopweed, Dill, tops of Thyme, Cinnamon, Ginger, of each ij. Smallage-seed j.
make of these a fine Powder, and keep it in a glass with a narrow orifice.

The COMMENTARY.
There are various descriptions given of this Powder; but all practical Medicks
take and approve of this of Myrepsus as best. Galen exhibits the like; but he
makes it too hot and sharp, by too much Ginger and Pepper: we have put Dill for
Anise; yet with this reserve, That any one may without difference or damage to
the compound, substitute which he pleases. This is prepared as the precedents.

Diacalamin the extenuates crass and viscid humors, Vires.
discusses flatulency, moves urine and fluors, cures the cough from cold
humors, helps the distribution of the aliment to the Liver, roborates the
ventricle, augments appetite: it may be given in form of a soft Electuary, if
it be mixed with Honey; a solid one, if with Sugar.

CHAP. 14. Pulvis contra Pestem, seu Bezoardicus; or, A Powder against the
Plague, or Bezoar-Powder.
of the roots of Tormentil, Angelico, Enula-campane, Gentian, Pyony,
Aloes-wood, yellow Sanders, Hartshorn, Ivory, the bone in the heart of a Heart,
Juniper Berries, Cardamomes, the seeds of Sorrel and Carduus, Cloves, Mace,
Cinnamon, of each j.ss. the rinds of Citron and Orange, Diptamus, Scordeum,
Squinant, the aromatic Reed, Roseleaves, Saffron, of each j. Bole-armeniack
washed in Rose Water, and Lemnian-Earth, of each ij. Camphyr gr. viij.
Amber-grise, Leaf-gold, of each j. make of these a very fine and small Powder,
and repose it in a glass; which sign, Pulvis Bezoardicus.

The COMMENTARY.
Medicaments which oppugn the Plague, expugn Poisons, evert their harm, and
defend life, are by the Greeks called Antidota, by the Arabians Bezaardica; of
which sort there are some simples, as the Bezar-stone, Zerumbet, and
Precious-stones; some compounds, as Cordials, and Theriacals, which consist of
many things that roborate the heart, spirits, and vital parts, extinguishing
poisons and venenate qualities: therefore they are said to be in a mean,
participating both of our nature and poisonous qualities; as Mithridate, whose
frequent use is not safe, where there is no suspicion of a venenate quality;
for if it find no object on which it may act, it leaves the vestigia of its
inimick quality impressed on the parts, accending the humors, and preying upon
the native calour.

But such compound Medicaments as consist only of cordial and roborative
ingredients, and by some special faculty oppugning poison, are at all seasons
convenient for all temperatures and diseases; as this Powder we have described,
whose faculties are eximious in expugning malign affections, and defending the
noble parts.

And it is given in water, or some cordial decoction, or idoneous conserve; or
else it is excepted in the Syrup of Kermes, or Lemmons, or concinnated into
the form of an Opiate: it may also with Honey despumed in some cordial water,
be coagmentated into the form of a liquid Electuary, and kept in shops like
other confections. Its faculties will be more eximious, if Precious-stones,
Unicornshorn, and Bezar-stone, be added to it. The Powder is easy to be made,
and the ingredients may be had.

It is miraculously efficacious in expugning venenate, contagious, Vires.
and pestilent diseases, and in recreating and defending the principal parts.

CHAP. 15. Pulvis Antilyssos, seu contra Rabiem; or, A Powder against the
biting of a mad Dog. D. J. Pal.
of the leaves of Rue, Vervine, Sage, Plantain, Polypody, common Wormwood,
Mint, Mugwort, Balm, Betony, S. John's Wort, the lesser Centaury, of each m.j.
let them be dried, and at last reducated into a fine Powder.

The COMMENTARY.
This alexiterial Powder I desumed from the famous Jul. Palmarius, who wrote
seven Books of contagious Diseases: the eximious faculties, and admirable
effects of this Medicament, not only he, but Dominus de Pyrou, has frequently
and successfully experienced upon many; from whom he confesses he had its first
description: for as many as were bitten with mad Dogs, and used this, were
presently freed from imminent and incipient Hydrophoby, if no part of the head
above the teeth, or cold member, were abluted; for then there were small hopes
of remedy.

We call this Powder ANtilyssum, because in arceating madness, it is inferior
to none: it cures wounds inflicted by mad Dogs, and impedes that terrible
symptom, whereby those wretches are fearful of water.

The preparation of this famous Antidote is easy; wherein these three things
are chiefly observable: First, that the Simples be then collected, when they
are most virtuous, to wit, in the beginning or end of the Spring; That they be
not dried either by the scorching Sun, or in a moist place; That when they are
dry, they be kept, with this reserve, that they be renovated annually.

There is no need, that any great quantity of this eximious Powder be kept in
Pharmacopolies: for it is enough, if half a pound thereof be reconded in a fit
vessel for present use: But its materials or simples should be kept in
abundance, artificially dried, enclosed in chartaceous bags, and securely
reposed, that Flies may not consparcate them, nor Mice erode them; and when
exigence calls for them, an equal weight of each should be pulverated, and a
whole or half dragm thereof given in the morning before meat, in a spoon, with
twice as much Sugar; or else in pottage, or other convenient liquor, as Wine,
Sider; or else in Honey, like an Opiate.

And although one or two dragms be a dosis sufficient for a very robust man;
yet three or four may sometimes be exhibited, by such especially, who have been
bitten long before, or are already begun to fear water.

This Powder is indeed very eximious; but it would be more efficacious, if the
Powder of Pimpinel and burnt River-Crabfishes were mixed with it: Its name
Alyssum shows, that it is justly preferred before all other of that sort; for
Galen and Dioscorides call it so, because it cures madness, and extinguishes
its poison.

But this plant is rare, and known only to few: it is in aspect like
Horehound, but each genicle emits only two crisped, hoary, and almost
inodorate leaves; spinous cups do verticularly circumvest its Caulicles: I have
often seen it in the Colledge-Garden in Paris.

There is another kind in Germany, called Echioides, like Tizil in form; but
it is inferior to that of Galens: yet he that wants the one, may substitute
the other.

CHAP. 16. Crocus Martis; or, Mars his Saffron.
THis Medicament is so denominated, partly from its matter, as it is the
filings of Steel, or Iron, dedicated to Mars; and partly from its color, which
resembles Saffron: Its preparation is multifarious; for every one prepares it
after his own Model, in which every one dissents from another: whence some have
neglected, or disapproved of its preparation, as useless; and Rivierius
exhibits the bare limature of Iron, for true Saffron of Mars, without ustion or
ablution; professing it to be safer, and more efficacious in curing the foetid
colors of Virgins: but he that will follow the method of so rash a
Periclitator, shall be more formidable then the very diseases.

I find two preparations of this Saffron, more usual then the rest: the first
is vulgar, and well known to Pharmacopolists, who burn the filings of Steel
twice, or more, in a crucible, and wash it as often, partly in Vinegar, partly in
Rose Water, or other fit liquor; then dry it, and make a subruse ponderous
Powder, which they call prepared Steel.

The second is used by the Chemists, who make this ponderous Powder volarile;
whose preparation they thus effect: sometimes they assume the limature of
Steel, sometimes of Iron, or of both, for the qualities are similar; they burn
it a day or two in their fire, then they inject it into water, and assume and
keep what swims above; and, abjecting the water, take what is in the bottom,
and inject it again into the reverberatory fire, where they burn it as before,
and again dimit it into water: what swims above, they again take and keep; what
sinks to the bottom, they again burn, till it subside not, but remain upon the
superficies of the water; which they collect, dry, and keep for special
Chemical Martical Saffron.

Some make it thus: They put the limature of Iron on a dish in a very hot fire,
and permit it to be red hot: when it is cold, they bray it laboriously in an
Iron-Morter; then wash it, that the more sublime part may be separated with the
water: the crasser is again burned, and brayed as before; which they iterate
seven or more times, till all the limature become croceous.

Some wash the limature of Iron in Brine, before they calcinate it; and
afterward in Vinegar: some macerate it in Urine, others put Salt to it, and
others Tartar: some burn it with Sulphur, others turn it into Rubigo: but as
these preparations are too curious, so are they needless; and it is better to
hold to one good way, then hover doubtful amongst so many.

But the dust of Iron must be filed very small for this purpose, that it may be
better calcinated by the fire; then it must be brayed, afterward demerged, and
much agitated in water, and the supernatant part collected, dried with moderate
heat, and kept without further calcination: the crasser part must be again
immitted into the fire, till the whole become volatile, and then it is true
Martial Saffron.

Alchymists make it also of other Metals; for they have Saffron of Tin,
Saffron of Venus: but by how much they seem more perite Artificers, by so much
they are more imperite Medicks.

They say, that Mars his Saffron roborates the liver and spleen, Vires.
takes away the obstructions of the bowels, and therefore cures the foetid
color of Virgins.

Of this and other Cordial Powders, prudent Medicks make a Confection in form
of a soft Electuary or Tabels, called Diastomoma, most efficacious in removing
obstructions, wherewith they mix the Powder of Worms: But I had rather make it
thus:

of Steel well prepared ij. Cinnamon ss. the species for the Electuary of the
three Sanders, and de Gemmis, of each j. the Powder of Dictamus ss. with Sugar
dissolved in Balm-water iiij. of which make Tablets of iij. weight, or ss. one
whereof take in the morning fasting. They used to put more Sugar to Cordial
Tabels, but then they are less efficacious.

THE SECOND PART. Of Powders necessary to be had in Shops.
IN the former part of this Section, we have tradited only most select Cordial
Powders; omitting only such, whose qualities were affine and similar, whose
descriptions were ungrounded, and use disapproved. Now in this second part we
shall treat of such, as, being more frigid and sweeter, are not as the former,
Aromatical, but Bechical and Thoracical; for they are convenient for the Cough
of the Lungs, and all Thoracical affections.

CHAP. 17. Pulvis Diaireos simplex.
of Florentine Orris ss. Sugar Candy, Pull. Diatrag. frigid. of each ij. make of
them all a Powder to be kept for use.

The COMMENTARY.
The Author of this Powder is most uncertain, but its use most frequent: it
should be conveniently excepted in Sugar, duly cocted in the white of an Egg,
clarified with Coltsfoot-water, and concinnated into Tabels or Lozenges: Each
ounce of Powder must have a pound of Sugar; yea, they sometimes put two ounces
of Sugar to one dragm of Powder: and the Electuary thus made, is more grateful,
but less efficacious; as on the contrary, when each dragm of Powder receives an
ounce of Sugar.

The manner of its preparation is so easy, that it needs no further
description.

It stays the distillation of the Jaws, Vires.
attenuates, cocts, and expectorates crass humors.

There is another composition of Diaireos, denoted by Solomon's name; which
being harder to make, more insuave, and no whit more efficacious, is seldom
made.

CHAP. 18. Pulvis Diatragacanthi frigidi; or, The Powder of cold
Diatragacanthum. D. Myrep.
of Penidees iij. Gum Thraganth j. Gum Arabic x. Starch ss. the seeds of white
Poppy iij. of the four greater cool seeds, Liquorice, of each ij. Camphyr ss.
make of these a Powder.

The COMMENTARY.
This Powder has its name and basis from Tragacanthum, which in its
composition is most prepollent. It receives many Bechical, viscid,
refrigerative, and lenitive simples, whereunto Myrepsus its Author adds
Nettle-seed, as very accommodate for the attenuation and expurgation of crass
humors: which, because it makes the compound both in color and sapour
ungrateful, is by Neotericks omitted, others supplying its faculty better.

It is kept either in form of a Powder, as the rest; or of a tabulated
Electuary; each ounce of Powder admitting of a pound of Sugar.

It helps all hot affections of the lungs and breast, Vires.
conduces much to such as are macilent or consumed; it cures the Pleurisy,
asperity of the tongue and jaws, and cocts and expectorates spittle.

CHAP. 19. Pulvis Diapendit sine speciebus; or, The Powder of Penidees without
species. D.N. Myreps.
of Penidees ij. Pine-nuts, sweet Almonds decorticated, white Poppy-seed, of
each iij. the Juice of Liquorice, Gum Thraganth, Arabic, the four greater cool
seeds, Starch, of each j. ss. Camphyr gr. viij. make of them all a Powder.

The COMMENTARY.
Diapenidion is made either without species, as in this form, or with them:
when Cinnamon, Cloves, and Ginger, are added thereto, as Myrepsus its Author
describes it, and the said species, Almonds, Poppy-seed, and Liquorice-juyce
are put in equal weight.

It is kept either in form of a Powder, or of a solid Electuary; which, by the
Authors advice, may be thus made: Three ounces of Violers must be macerated and
cocted in a pound of water, till the water be of a violaceous color; one pound
of Sugar must be cocted in the colature, to the consistence of a solid
Electuary; wherewith, whilst hot, the Penidees, and other levigated simples,
must be so mixed and subacted, that the mass may acquire a solid form, whereof
tabels or Rhombodies may be concinnated and reposed for use. All with one
consent confect Penidees thus, but few agree in the proportion of the simples;
for each one changes their weight: this we have delivered is the most usual
form.

This Powder conduces very much to those that are infested with a cough, Vires.
pleurisy, difficulty of breathing, asperity of jaws, hoarseness, and many
vices of the lungs. If it be made with the species, besides the enumerated
effects, it also incides, attenuates, and cocts viscid, crass, and cold
humors, preparing them for expectoration.

CHAP. 20. Confectio de Rebecha.
of the Powder of Diaireos, cold Diatraganth. of each ij. Powder of Liquorice
ss. Sugar Candy iij. and with Gum Thraganth dissolved in Rose Water make a
Paste, of which Rolls.

The COMMENTARY.
Though this confection be of an unknown Author, yet it is most usual, grateful
for sapour, and commendable for effects. The Powders whereof it consists, are
indeed kept severally, till they be mixed with Tragacanthum, solved in
Rose Water, or other convenient liquor; or else coacted with Sugar, cocted in
some idoneous humor into a mass, whereof Pastills or Bacills may be formed. We
anumerate it amongst Bechical Powders, because it is of the same use and
consistence. Some think this consection is called Rebecha, from Bechia, for it
is Bechical, some ignorant fellow reading Rebechi, for Bechi, in some ancient
Medicks receipt, gave the name to this Confection, which is now called Rebecha.

It cures such as cough, Vires.
breathe difficultly, spit corrupt blood, are infested with the Peurisie,
asperity of the tongue and jaws, and hoarseness.

CHAP. 21. Of Penidees.
PEnidees are much commended amongst bechical and arteriacal Medicaments, which
consist but of a few ingredients; for they are made of Sugar and Barley-water,
mixed in such proportion, and so cocted, that a mass expurges thence, of such
solidity, that it is tractable, not adhering to ones fingers, but easily
ducible into long or short, crass or small threads: which, that it may be duly
effected, the mass, while hot, is adduced, reduced, and drawn upon a ferreous
hook affixed to the Beam, till it be dealbated, and several figures made out
of those threads.

Bulcasis, the Author of this Compound, made it of pure water, Sugar, and
Honey, mixed with as much Oil of bitter Almonds: But now we take Barley-water,
omit Honey, and only anoint the hands of the subacter, and the Marble on which
it is projected, with Oil.

The shop-men call this Medicament Alphenicum, from the whiteness it contracts
by subaction and duction.

It cures the cough, hoarseness, and asperity of the artery; moves, Vires.
cocts, and excludes spittle, and helps all affections of the Lungs and Breast.

SECT. II. Of liquid Antidotes.
THere are of the Powders described, and other Cordial and Alexiterial ones,
diluted in some idoneous liquor, certain soft confections made, which we
sometimes call Liquid Antidotes, sometimes Opiates, and sometimes Cordial
Confections. Now some of them are only Cordial, recreating the spirits and
vital parts; others Alliotical and Hypnotical, altering and conciliating sleep;
and others Theriacal, working the same effects, and withal oppugning and
expugning poison, if they meet with any. We will begin with the true Cordials.

CHAP. I. Confectio Alkermes; or, The Confection of Alkermes. D.M.
of the Juice of fragrant Apples, of the best Damask Rosewater, of each lb
j.ss. infuse in them for the space of a whole day, the husks or Cods of Sericum
crudum.
Silkworms lb j. make a strong expression; to which add the best Juice of
Kermes-berries lb j. Sugar lb ij. boil them till they come almost to the body
or consistence of Honey; to which, whilst hot, add It is better to grind the
Amber with the Powders, and so to mix it.
crude Amber small cut ij. and when it is dissolved, cast in these Powders, of
Cinnamon, Aloes-wood, of each vj. the Azurestone burnt and washed, Pearl, of
each ij. Leaf Gold j. Mosch j. make thereof a foft Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
The greater part of Pharmacopolists infuse silk dyed in the succe of tinctured
grains, or Kermes newly tincted in Rose Water: But Joubertus, to whom I assent,
would rather infuse crude silk in the said liquor, and then add the succe of
Kermes to the expression; for so there is less loss; and the virtue of the
silk, if it have any, may be easily elicited before tincture, by infusion: And
though its first Author Mesue instituted it otherwise, yet it is no piacle to
discede either from him, or any other Author, if the thing may be made either
better, or more useful thereby. I rather assent therefore to such as infuse
crude silk in Rose Water, and succe of Apples, and afterward add Kermes to
the expression.

It is prudently provided in the Roman Antidotary, that only four ounces of
silk be macerated, seeing it may not be totally omitted with loss to the
Medicament: for, as I would not be refractory, so would not I be too credulous,
nor suffer every thing that is spoken or written, too precipitantly to inhere
in my mind. And that I may speak freely, Sericum being the excrement of a
certain sordid Insect, I can scarce persuade my self, that it is endued with so
great virtue as the Ancients put upon it. I know indeed that Clay is not
destitute of faculties, and that the qualities of Animals Hair, Cleys, and very
dung, are not contemptible; but, if not cordial, yet efficacious, by their
sharp and troublesome quality. But more of silk in its proper place. I now
return to our confection, wherein the Azurestone is put; yet not so prepared,
as in the confection of those Pills, which are denominated from it: for therein
it is exhibited crude, that its purgative faculty may remain entire; but here
burnt, that it may perish; in both pulverated, and frequently washed, that it
may depose its vomitory, and keep its cordial and roborative faculty.

It must be burned in a crucible or small earthen pot, then brayed, and often
washed, first in common water, then in cordial, as Rosewater, or such
convenient liquor, and dried, till the water after lotion remain limpid.

This is a precious, but not so operous a compound, as the Augustane
Dispensatory portends: it is prepared as other Confections. The sole dissent
about its composition, is in the tincture of the silk, and the weight of Musk,
which some augment, others minuate: if Aloes-wood cannot be had, Citrian
Santals may be substituted.

It is very efficacious for many things; Vires.
for it cures the palpitation of the heart, swoundings, doting, and sadness
without a manifest cause; and much helps such as are languid, wearied with long
sickness, and newly recovered.

CHAP. 2. Confectio de Hyacintho; or, The confection of Hyacinth.
of Hyacinths, red Coral, Lemnian-Earth, Bole-Armeniack, of each ss.
Kermes-berries, Tormentil-root, Dittany, Citron-seed, Saffron, Myrrh, red
Roses, all the sorts of Sanders, the bone in the heart of a Heart, Harts-bone
burnt, shavings of Ivory, the seeds of Sorrel and Purslain, of each j. Saphyr,
Smaragd, Topaz, Pearl, crude Silk, filings of Gold and Silver, of each ij.
Camphyr. Mosch, Ambergrise, of each gr. v. with Syrup of Lemmons make it up
into a Confection.

The COMMENTARY.
Neotericks invented this Confection, which the Mompelian Medicks, who were
first seen to usurp it, had in much use. It agrees only nominally with that in
the first Section of the greater Luminary, which is denominated of Hyacinth,
under the authority of its Inventor Galen. But whoever was the Author of this,
he has selected the best Medicaments, congested them in the best Method and
Order; and therefore I judge nothing changeable herein, unless it be Ivory,
which I think were better crude then burnt; and Silk, which I would willingly
detract, or tinct it in Kermes before composition.

Some require a greater weight of simples, who may by my permission either
augment or lessen the quantity, if they detract not from the virtue and
efficacy of the mixture; for a little change is none.

It much helps the heart and noble parts in their affections; Vires.
it cures the Syncope, exhilarates the heart, emends palpitation, dulcorates
the breath, takes away melancholy, and her sister sadness, without a manifest
cause: it cures venenate and contagious diseases, and produces the same effects
with the confection of Scarlet grains.

CHAP. 3. Rosata novella; or, A new invented Opiate of Roses. D. N. Myrep.
of Rose-leaves, Sugar, Liquorice, of each ix. Cinnamon ij. Cloves, Spikenard,
Ginger, Galangal, Nutmegs, Setwel, Storax, Cardamomes, Smallage-seed, of each
ij. make of all these a Powder, adding thereunto despumed Honey, as much as
will suffice to make it an Opiate.

The COMMENTARY.
This confection admits of Roses for its Basis and Nomenclature, and of many
Aromata's, both to attenuate and concoct crass and frigid humors, and to
recreate the spirits, and roborate the native heat; and of some Bechical
ingredients also, to move and promote spittle. It is sometimes kept in form of
a Powder, but more frequently of a soft Electuary, or Opiate. We have omitted
some scruples and grains, added, its probable, upon small grounds, to the
greater weights; which he that will, may super-adde: for the detriment will be
none, and the utility as much.

It roborates the imbecile ventricle, Vires.
takes away loathsomness, discusses flatulency, excites appetite, helps
concoction, incides viscid humors, cures cholical dolours, stays vomiting,
and helps the imbecility of the heart and stomach, ( Myrep. cap. 2 14. Sect. 1.)

CHAP. 4. Confectio de Baccis Lauri; or, The confection of Bay Berries.
of dried Rue x. Sagapenum iiij. Opoponax iij. Bay Berries, the seeds of
Bishopweed, Cucumer, Lovage, Roman Gith, Carret, Caraway, Long-Pepper, black
Pepper, true Acorus, bitter Almonds, Origanum, Horsemint, Castoreum, of each
ij. Honey despumed, as much as will suffice to make it up into an Opiate.

The COMMENTARY.
In this confection, Bay Berries, (which give the name) the leaves of Rue,
Origanum, and wild Mint, make up a Basis: it admits of many hot and inciding
seeds, to attenuate viscid humors, califie frigid humors, and dissipate
flatulency; of Gummes, to deterge and discuss; and of Honey, to receive and
conserve the Powders, and to make the compound more efficacious and pleasant.

The Gummes being few, and prescribed in small quantity, need not be solved in
any liquor, but minutely incided, and pulverated with the rest; then all
received together in despumed Honey, whilst yet hot, and coacted into the form
of an Opiate.

It cures the cholical dolor arising from crude humors and flatulency, Vires.
the tympany, turbulency in the guts, belching; and helps cold natures.

CHAP. 5. Antidotus Diasatyri^on; or, An Antidote exciting Venery.
of Satyrion roots fresh and succulent ij. the roots of Garden-Carret, and
Sea-holly, Indian Nuts, of each j. Pine-kernels, Pistaches, of each j. ss.
Cloves, Ginger, Anise-seed, Rocket-seed, Birds-tongue, commonly called
Ashton-keyes, of each v. the loins of Scinci, the seed of Bulbus, or Nettle, of
each ij. ss. Mosch gr. vij. Honey despumed in the decoction of the aforesaid
roots lb iij. make it into an Opiate.

The COMMENTARY.
There are many descriptions hereof, of which this is the best, most usual, and
useful; but there being many kinds of Satyrion, that which has but one
testicle must be selected, and that in the beginning of the Spring, when it is
most succulent.

Some rather take Parsnips-root, then that of Eryngium; but I much matter not
which, for their faculties are affine: and I do not so much esteem them, as
laboring Rusticks, who almost daily feed upon them both, and yet are no more
salacious then before. Rocket indeed I value more, for that will excite the
most slow to Venery; though Land-Crocodiles or Scinci do most potently excite
thereto, the flesh of whose Loins I prefer before their Tail. There is some
dubitation about Onyon-seed: seeing no Medick has explicitly determined, of
what sort, among so many varieties of Onyons, the seed must be; therefore I
substitute Nettle-seed, which is most congruent to that purpose, in its stead.

And it is thus made: First the roots must be boiled in sufficient water, till
they be tabid; then they must be baked, and transmitted through a hair-sieve;
then mixed with despumed and cocted Honey, and then again fervefied on a slow
fire, till the aqueous humidity be absumed; afterward the Pine-kernels and
Pistack-nuts must be taken, and minutely cut, and then levigated like the rest;
the Musk must be brayed apart, and last of all confusedly mixed with the
Cinnamon. The old description has an equal weight of Pistack-nuts and Satyrion;
whereas the Pistack being insuave, and more unapt for the end, should be taken
in much less quantity.

Diasatyrion augments the seed, stimulates venery, Vires.
erects the Yard, excites the languid and drowsy to venery, roborates the
imbecility of the reins and bladder, and augments strength.

CHAP. 6. Antidotus Analeptica D.F. or, The roborative Antidote of D. Fern.
of Rose-leaves, Liquorice, of each ij. gr. v. Gum Arabic, Thraganth, of
each ij. and ij. white and red Sanders, of each iiij. Juice of Liquorice,
Starch, the seeds of white Poppy, Purslain, Lettice, and Endive, of iij. the
four greater cool seeds, the seeds of Quinces, Mallows, Cotton, Violets,
Pistaches, Pine-kernels, sweet Almonds, Pulp of Sebestens, Storax, Cloves,
Cinnamon, shavings of Ivory, of each ij. Saffron gr. v. Penidees ss. when they
are all beaten, take the treble quantity of syrup of Violets, to make it into
an Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
This Analeptical Antidote or restaurative Electuary, as Praepositus calls it,
is much celebrated by Fernelius; in whose description he found nothing to be
changed, but only the order of the simples, and the grains of Berberries; in
whose stead he reposed Pistacks: Buche omitted Storax, which is most
commendable and useful in this confection, whose manner of preparation is so
easy, as that it needs not any more declaration.

It restores lost strength, Vires.
hinders swoundings and syncope, resarciates the habit of the body, extenuated
by long fluxes, or other immoderate vacuations. It helps and benefits the
macilent and consumed, by humectating, nourishing, and roborating them.

CHAP. 7. Antidotum Asyncritum; or, The incomparable Antidote of Actuar.
Myrrh ij. and ij. Opium vj. black Pepper, the seeds of Smallage, Parsley, and
Mustard, of each ss. Squinant ss. Amomus, the best Storax, of each ij. (...).
Hedychroi Magnatis j. and ij. Cassia-Lignea, white Pepper, the seed of
Hartwort, of each j. and j. Honey despumed, as much as will suffice.

The COMMENTARY.
Actuarius calls this the Asyncrital, that is, the incomparable Antidote,
because it has no equal in excellency. Now that it may be made to the Authors
mind, the Opium must be macerated in sweet Sape, till it be of the consistence
of Honey: the Storax must be diduced in honey, wherewith some dry Powders may
be commixed. We have upon good grounds, and much consent, substituted vulgar
ligneous Cassia, or Cane, in stead of the Author's Egyptian Cassia; and not
Cassia Fistula, or the purgative Cane, which Actuarius all along calls Black
Cassia, which is no convenient ingredient in an Antidote.

This Antidote cures old headaches, Vires.
mitigates vertiginous and comitial affections, takes away too much vigilance,
and restrains fury and frenzy: it indulges the dolours of the eyes by
defluxion, helps the toothache, difficulty of breathing, old coughs, the
inflammation of the sides, both dry and humid: it exhausts all the humidity
from off the lungs, condenses thin spittle, and makes it more fit for excretion.

It is of present help for the stomach, astringing its humid laxity; it takes
away loathsomness and sighing, hinders vomitings, and so stays the meat newly
ingested, solves all inflations of the stomach and belly into ructures, cures
the Jaundies, conduces to melancholy, abrogating its sad symptoms, removes the
gravity of the spleen, restores color to the face, dispels obstructions, moves
urine, deturbates sand, cures the calamities of the Uterus, and cholical
dolours, and many other affections, if what Actuarius has published of this
Opiate be true.

CHAP. 8. Philonium magnum seu Romanum; or, The great or Roman Philonium.
of white Pepper, Cassia Lignea, Cinnamon, of each ij. Saffron, Euphorbium,
Pellitory, of each ss. Setwel, Spikenard, of each ij. Henbane-seed ss. Opium
ij. ss. Castoreum, Myrrh, of each j. ss. the seeds of Smallage, Fennel,
Carret, Parsley, of each j. Honey despumed, as much as will suffice to make it
into an Opiate.

The COMMENTARY.
No Medicament is so doubtful and various, as Philonius the Philosopher's
Antidote; to which it happens, as it does to wine which is poured out of one
vessel into another, which cannot be without loss: for as many as have written
of Pharmacy, have retained its name, but nothing more. Galen alone approves of
it; but withal he says, he subscribes many under it more famous and better.
Myrepsus gave four Antidotes of that name; one whereof admits of Opium; one
dimits it: the other are scarce like these, and very incongruent to the true
Philonium. Praepositus detracted a few things from the former description, and
added many more: some have added Castorium, others Poppy-seed: We approve of
Praepositus his description, in stead of Costum, substituting Castorium, the
true castigator of Opium. We have otherwise disposed the order of the Simples,
and lessened the quantity of Pepper, Euphorbium, and Bartram; for so we have
made it more secure, without fear of inflammation: For we have seen some
complaining of great ardour in the bottom of the belly, and the straight
intestine, by the injection of a Glyster, wherein half a dragm of Philonium had
been dissolved; which is no wonder, seeing it consists of seventeen Simples,
all hot, besides Opium, which some say is hot also, and Henbane: yea, it can
scarce be swallowed, but it offends the jaws with its ardour and acrimony. But
as it is by us emended, it may be safely assumed at the mouth, without any
offense to the ventricle, gale or jaws. It is called Roman Philonium, because
it was much used at Rome.

It is prescribed to the Pleurisy and Cholick; whence some call it the
Cholical Antidote; and to all internal dolours. Vires.
It conciliates sleep, stays blood issuing from the internals, takes away
loathsomness, allayes the dolours of the belly, spleen, liver and reins,
arising from a cold distemper, flatulency, or crude humors, and stays sighing.

It must be assumed at the mouth only in small quantity, as the bigness of a
Pease, or little more, according to the age and strength of the assument; and
it must be variously dissolved, for various purposes; sometimes in the
decoctions of Plants; sometimes in wine: Actuarius gave it to the sick in the
stomach, in the succe of the sprigs of Cistus, and a little wine.

But it is most frequently injected into the belly by the fundament in a
decoction of Glysters; which are prescribed for the cure of the most grievous
cholical dolours: whereunto, this much conduces.

CHAP. 9. Opiata Solomonis; or, Solomon 's Opiate. D. Joubert.
Citron-pill condited lb ss. conserve of old Roses, and Sorrel, of each j. ss.
conserve of Enula-campane, and Bugloss, Mithridate, of each vj. conserve of
Rosemary-flowers ss. Wormseed, Citron-seed, of each iij. Cinnamon ij. Cloves j.
the root of white Dittany, Carduus Benedictus, dried Citron-pill, of each ij.
gr. v. Aloes-wood j. Cardamomes, Mace, of each ij. and gr. xv. Gentian-roots
ss. the bone in the heart of a Heart j. Juniper Berries infused a whole night in
Vinegar of Squills n.xxv. Sugar lb ss. Syrup of Citrons, as much as will
suffice to make it into an Opiate.

The COMMENTARY.
Joubertus describes this Opiate from one Solomon, a man of no note in
Medicine, and commends it for many uses. He says its Author was (...), or
uncertain, he only receiving it at the hands of women, no little depraved; as
it happens to such things as are committed to writing, and not to print:
Therefore I should rather call Joubertus its castigator, the Author of it, then
these women, or one Solomon, of whom I have not otherwise heard. But if any one
will, for more ostentation, or Encomium to the Opiate, design it by the name of
that great King, who ruled Gods people, I shall suffragate with him, seeing
many fictitious names are without any better grounds imposed upon other
Medicaments. It is easy to make: for want of Aloes-wood, Citrian Santal may be
taken; and for the roots of Carduus and Dittany, their leaves and seeds: The
rest are vulgar, and easy to be had.

It cures pestilent and contagious diseases, Vires.
roborates the principal parts, arceates putretude, kills worms, stays
vomitings, and helps the languid and weak, from what cause soever.

CHAP. 10. Electuarium de Ovo; or, The Electuary of an Egg.
of Saffron j. ss. or ij.

Let them be included with the yolk of an Egg in an Egge-shell, open only at
one end, where the white has had its passage out; and shut it up with another
Egge-shell, or with Paste, and bake it in an oven: Let the matter be taken out,
and pulverated small; whereunto, add

Dittany, Tormentil, of each ij. Hartshorn, Nux vomica, of each j. Angelica,
Setwel, Juniper Berries, Enula-campane, of each ij. ss. Cinnamon, Mace, of each
j. ss. Camphyr j. Treacle ij. and so mix all together: contund them well, and
put as much Syrup of Lemmons to them, as will make them into an Electuary.

The COMMENTARY.
The description of this Electuary is as uncertain, as the former's Author's
name; for neither are known: Yet there is no Seplasiary so rude, but he will
boast, That he has its best description. I have seen many, but never two
alike: that is best, which is divulged by the Augustane Medicks; yet some
things therein are not tolerable: for though its ingredients be few, and
described in small quantity, yet there is half an ounce of Camphyr, and as much
Mustard as may equalize both the Saffron and Egg yolk there prescribed:
whereas neither of them may be so admitted; the Mustard being very hot, and not
cordial; the Camphyr cordial, but not suaveolent, save in small quantity.
Besides, those grave men command the Powders and the Theriack to be mixed
together, without the intervent of Honey, or a Syrup: and so it cannot be an
Opiate, but a Paste, more solid then any mass for Pills. But we have detracted
Mustard from it as noxious, and Pimpinella as useless; adding thereto Enula,
Mace, and Cinnamon, as cordial and bezoardical; we have instituted a just dosis
of Camphyr, an idoneous quantity of Theriack, and a fit Syrup for their
receipt and subaction. It should be a new Hens-egge, of a moderate magnitude,
through whose perforated head, the White should be educed, and the Yolk left:
what is empty, should be filled with Oriental, not pulverisatous Saffron; and
the hole stopped with Paste, or another shell, that nothing might expire; then
the included being cocted in a furnace or oven, by a slow fire, must be
pulverated, the shells being abjected.

Some disallow of the vomitory Nut, because it is deletery to Dogs and Cats,
and subverts Man's ventricle. But we have often satisfied to this dubitation, for
the nature of Man differs from that of Brutes; for that is often poison to men,
which to beasts is meat. Thus Starlings feed on Hemlock, which is death to man;
Aloes and bitter Almonds kill Foxes, which man safely uses. Furthermore, the
vomitory Nut being alexiterial, and provoking vomit, is very convenient; for
vomits conduce much in contagious diseases, especially to such, whose first
region abounds with prave humors: for the chief parts being thereby purged
from their corruption, their faculties are more operative, and apt to oppugn
poison.

The use of this Electuary has been rare in France hitherto; but I hope when
our emendation is better known, it will be more frequent: for thus described,
it is most efficacious for the cure of the Pestilence; for it is a certain
small Theriack, which later sedulity has invented.

It is very commendable, Vires.
both for the prevention and curation of the Plague, and all pestilent
diseases: it is either given alone, or with some conserve, water, or cordial
decoction.

generous wine lb j. or as much as will suffice to dissolve the Gummes, Liquors
and Juyces; Honey despumed, a treble quantity, or lb ix. and viij. make it into
an Opiate.

The COMMENTARY.
This solemn Antidote is cognominated from its Inventor Mithridates King of
Pontus and Bithynia; for he was a most generous and most learned Monarch, who
understanding the Languages of twenty two Nations, and having much skill in
Medicine, made this noble Antidote against Poison, whereof he was most afraid:
by the use whereof, he lived long free from all virulent and deletery
qualities; for being vanquished by Pompey, and fearing he would lead him alive
in triumph to Rome, he assumed Poison, from which he received not the least
trouble: but becoming weary of longer life, called one Bituitus a Soldier to
him, desiring him to kill him; whose slow and detracting trembling hand, he
himself forced to his own slaughter, and so was said to have trajected himself,
as Appianus has it. Amongst his treasuries and spoils, there was a Roll of
Medicinal Commentations found, which the King had laid up most safely, as the
most curious of Secrets. Pompey brought these to Rome, and gave them to the
Roman Physicians, as Damocrates and Andromachus, who approved of all the
remedies, but especially of the Mithridate, whose description Damocrates
rendered in Latin Verses, that it might not be changed: and though he was not
its author, but transcriber, yet is it cognominated from him, Damocrates his
Mithridate. Galen also delivers another description from Andromachus, not much
unlike this; but it is not so orderly disposed, but somewhat depraved: for it
has an uncertain dosis of the Indian Leaf, of Gentian, Meum, and Cardamome,
and Spikenard twice iterated under two appellatiors, signifying the same thing.
There are furthermore, many simples most convenient for this Antidote, left
out, as the fruit of Balm, and its fit succedany, Dittany, white Pepper, and
Bdellium. It is probable, Andromachus changed the former description, either to
get some glory, or to vindicate it to himself; or else because he found some
such an one amongst the Secrets of Mithridates; or else received it from
Pompey: But however, that of Damocrates is more frequently prepared, and more
celebrated.

Neither was Nic. Praepositus less desirous of vainglory, who described a
Pseudo-Mithridate out of Myrepsus, congested of a great heap of Simples, which
he, for the most part, described in the barbarous Idiome, mixed confusedly, and
disposed in undue order and proportion. In brief, that Antidote has much
difficulty in its preparation, and little utility in its exhibition: and
therefore we leave it to such as will swear to whatever he says; and, like
blind men, will follow their blinking Author whithersoever he leads them.

The chief difficulty in its preparation, is the pervestigation and selection
of the simples which we often want, especially such of them as are exotical; in
whose stead, we are forced to substitute succedaneous ones; as, for the Oil of
Balm, the Oil of Cloves or Nutmeg; for the fruit of Balm, Cubebs, or
Lentisks-seed; for Falernian wine, other generous wine; for Attick Honey,
indigenous Honey: we have added to this out of the Roman Antidote, the root of
Florentine-Orris; and for Arum, which some admit, and others omit, we use round
Birth-wort; all the Gummes, Lachrymae, and Succes, save Gum-Arabick, and
Olibanum, which should be brayed, must be macerated in wine: in the mean while,
the roots must be brayed, and the rest in their order, as we have often
denoted. When the Gummes are macerated, they must be a little fervefied, that
the wine may be absumed; then both these and the Powders must be levigated, and
transmitted through a sieve, and mixed with despumed Honey; and so an Opiate
must be made, reposed in a fit vessel, and agitated once a day, for the first
month, with a rudicle; in the second month, twice a week; in the third, once
a week; in the fourth, thrice of all: and so left, till the sixth month, and
then once again agitated. Vires.


It is the most safe praesidy against Poison, and contagious Diseases: it has
more faculties; but they are so well known, that I shall not need to recenseate
them.

The COMMENTARY.
It is not without ground, that they call Mithridate the Father, and Theriack
the Mother of Medicaments; seeing in dignity and excellency they far exceed
all others, and comprehend all others faculties; for there is scarce any
preternatural affection, whereunto the one of these duly prepared does not
conduce.

Mithridates is justly made the Author of both; for he invented and congested
the matter whereof they both consist: Andromachus and Damocrates disposed it
only more orderly, and added some few things. Thus Theriack had its original
from Mithridate, which Criton first so called from a Viper, which the Greeks
call (...), whose flesh duly prepared, as we shall hereafter show, Andromachus,
Nero's chief Physician, added to Mithridate, and made its faculty, which before
was void and imbecile, as to wild beasts and venenate Serpents stings, now most
efficacious. And thus of Mithridate is made a Theriack, the most present Remedy
against Poison; from which, all Medicaments that extinguish any poison, are
called Theriacal. Andromachus his sedulity was very commendable, who digested
and adorned these two Antidotes with good order and form, which were before
without order and form: in imitation whereof, the later age has described many
Compositions and Theriacks, wherewith some Pharmacopolies are rather onerated
then adorned.

All Theriacks tradited by Rhasis, Avicenna, Mesue, Serapio, Paulus, Oribasius,
Aetius, Myrepsus, and Neotericks, do not only dissent from one another, but
all from the ancient one delivered by Andromachus; and therefore they are
seldom made, but neglected as useless.

And although the Theriack of Andromachus senior be described in Verses, and so
may not be perverted; yet that which his Son gives in Prose, is more
celebrated; which we here exhibit. However, there is no difference of moment
betwixt them.

Many things accede to this confection, which cannot be always had; in whose
stead, others must be substituted a like in first or second qualities, though
not in kind; as when we make one herb succedaneous to another, one seed to
another, and one metal to another. But we usurp such substitutes as are endued
with like qualities, though we have not the best of that kind. Thus Galen
substitutes Wormwood for bitter Almonds; Doves-dung for Euphorbium; Ginger for
Pepper: But now adays the Parisian Apothecaries spare no cost, in acquiring
the most precious and rare Medicaments and Simples; and many of them, that
scarce know their seconds, have all the kinds of Aromata's, Precious-stones,
and rarest Simples in their Pharmacopolies: yea, they scorn to let any Simple
be unknown, that ingredes the composition of Medicaments.

But if any one, as it often falls out, can neither by Art, Labor, nor Price,
acquire some things necessary for confecting this Theriack, he may, in stead of
Opobalsamum, which is most rare, subrogate Oil of Cloves, or of Nutmeg; in
stead of Costus, Setwel; in stead of Schoenantum, sweet Cane; for Cretian
Dittany, indigenous; for Amome, Acorus; for Carpobalsamum, Cubebs, or seeds of
Lentisks; for Falernian, other generous wine. But nothing must be substituted
for Pastils, whose preparation we shall give in the next Section. For want of
small Aristolochy, the long may be used; for the Illyrian Orris, the
Florentine; for Calcithis, Vitriol: which many think may be omitted, as
conducing nothing to the virtue, but only to the color of the Theriack: yet
if a Theriack should be without that color, its Confector would be derided for
his pains. Others on the contrary hold, that it is upon good grounds admitted,
because by its styplicity, it roborates the intrails, and by its siccity
arceates putretude: Moreover, it is mixed in small quantity, and half burnt, or
else Vitriol in its stead, which is burnt totally, and thence participates of
little acrimony. Of old it was otherwise prepared: but the true manner of its
confection, is that which we have given to Mithridate.

And as (...) comprehends all venenate and wild Animals in general, and by a
more peculiar signification denotes a Viper, whose Male is called (...), and
Female (...). so Theriack complects all Antidotes, which either by assumption
or admotion tranquillitate diseases: Galen calls it (...); for it is most
expertly alexiterial against all evils: Vires.
and it cures not only venenate diseases, but many common ones; for assumed in
sweet wine, it cures diuturnal headaches, the Vertigo, heaviness of hearing,
hebetude of eyes, Epilepsie, and difficulty of breathing: it emends the vices
of the stomach, difficult coction, and imbecility of the ventricle: it cures
the inflations, cholical and ileous dolours of the intestines; it kills all
kinds of worms, cures swoundings and imbecility: exhibited with the water of
Radish-roots, or Pellitory of the wall, it breaks the stone, and helps against
the hard mixtion in the reins and bladder: it is of approved use in the
inclining to, or beginning of Fevers, especially quartane Agues: it dissipates
flatulency, absumes putrid humors in the bowels and ventricle, removes
obstructions, emends the color, helps the palpitation of the heart; moves
women's fluors, ejects the dead birth; and given opportunely, cures Hydrophoby,
and the bitings of mad Dogs.

of Senny j.ss. Hermodacts, Turbith, of each vj. the shaving of the Pali sancti.
Holywood, Sarsaperilla, Sassafras, of each ss. of the best Honey despumed in
the decoction of China-root, and cocted to the absumption of the aqueous

The COMMENTARY.
There is no Pharmacoean novellist so ignorant, but he can boast of some secret
Remedy he has, for the virulent flux of sperm, or any venereous Ulcer;
concerning which affections, and their cures, Empiricks are most busy:
whereunto, the vulgarity of Apothecaries frequently run, not without peril; for
this kind of people, being greedy of novelties, and too credulous, will
amplect any error, though capital, so it smell but of Medicine; and take from
deceivers their most deletery Medicaments. It is indeed miserable, that such as
are unwilling to dye, should yet thrust themselves willingly into the hands of
the killer. I would exhort all worthy Apothecaries, to move, induce, and
valiantly infer war upon such nefarious wretches, and use only such remedies
as are delivered and approved by most perite and learned Authors.

We describe this Opiate, for the help of such Youngsters as Venery has
caught: it is Invented by much Reason, described by much Art, and proved by
much Experience; for given when and where it should, it successfully cures the
Indian Pox, which they call the Neapolitan Disease: whence it is justly
cognominated the Neapolitan Opiate. We have often seen another of the same
name, in the Parisian Surgeons hands; which being ill described at first,
was daily changed by every fresh-man: for some only make it of Guaiacum,
Senny, Honey, and Aqua-vitae; others add Bayberries: some take away Guaiacum,
and substitute Sarsaperilla; some approve of Hermodactyls, others Turbith,
others both, and some neither. We exhibit it according to the prescript
established and proved by Reason and Effect. Some add Aquavitae; but I think
Cinamon-water is more conducible: but neither, to hot waters; either, to cold
ones.

It cures the Venereous Disease: it is given every other day, and oftentimes
every morning fasting, from ij. to ss. It is most convenient for such, as for
business cannot lie long, and stay much in their Cubicles.

We have omitted many other Antidotes, described by Mesue, Actuarius, Myrepsus,
and Praepositus; whose composition is not probable, nor use laudable: before
which, we prefer these we have transcribed. For Zazenea, Atanasia, both the
Requies of Nicholaus, Diasulphur, Acaristum, Adrianum, and the confection of
Storax, are seldom or never prepared, because Asyncritum, both in facility in
preparation, and faculty in operation, is much before them all: For their chief
virtue consisting in conciliating sleep, it is enough that we have one or two
Medicaments, as Pills of Dogs-tongue, and the Roman Philonium, that can with
felicity effect this end.

And we judge the same of Alfessera, of Esdra, and of the Hamagogous Antidote;
and other almost innumerable Confections, collected by Authors, or rather
Transcriptors, which would make a man nauseate their number.

SECT. III. Of Alterative and Roborative Trochisks.
WE have hitherto exhibited Roboratives in form of Powders, soft Electuaries,
and Opiates. It now rests, before we put an end to this Book, that we explicate
all Trochisks of consimilar virtues, and all necessary for Pharmacopolies; as
well those which are compounded, that they may ingrede the confection of other
Medicaments, as those that are given alone, and serve to the benefit of no
others. And lest we should have confusedly congested Roborative and Purgative
Trochisks together, as many do, and that perperously; we have adjoined all the
Cathartical, as Trochisks of Rhabarb, of Agarick, and of Alhandal, to the end
of the third Section of our second Book. And now acceding to the explication of
Roborative and Alterative Trochisks, we shall begin with those that constitute
parts of Mithridate and Treacle.

CHAP. 1. Trochisci de Vipera; or, Trochisks of Vipers.
of the flesh of Vipers boiled in water with Dill and Salt lb ss. the Medulla
of the whitest Bread, dried and powdered ij. beat them well together; and with
hands anointed with Opobalsamum, or its succidency, make little Troches, every
one to weigh j. dry them to keep.

The COMMENTARY.
These are called Viperine or Theriacal Pastils; for whose confection, the
Vipers must be taken about the end of the Spring, or beginning of Summer, when
they have been recreated with their wonted meat and air: The Female should be
rather selected then the Male, but not while pregnant; but agile, with a long
neck, a fiery aspect, rutilous and red eyes, a broad compressed head, a snout
reflected upwards, an ample belly, a tail not involved, growing more gracile by
little and little, void of flesh, a firm, but slow pace. The Males tail grows
sensibly more gracile, and is not destitute of flesh; the trunk of its body is
smaller, its neck thicker, its head more august, with only two canine teeth;
the Female has four. Such as inhabit salt and maritimous places, are not
selegible; those that are taken new, are better then the old. But that they may
be rightly prepared, they should be killed with Rods; for their anger being
thereby incensed, they will spit out their poison. Their head and tail must be
abscinded from them when beaten, each of them to the measure of four fingers,
which is enough in greater Vipers: those, which after this amputation, move no
longer, nor effuse any more blood, but lie still, and are exanguous, must be
rejected as useless: The useful must be excoriated, eviscerated, and purged
from all their fatness, washed well three or four times in clear water, and
then cocted in a fit pot, with sufficient of water, with a little Salt, and
more or less of green Dill, as the number of the Vipers is, in the prudent
Apothecaries judgment; as, one handful and a half, or two, for four or five
Vipers: which number will make up three ounces of Trochisks, requisite for the
confection of the Theriack. They must be cocted on a luculent, but not a
violent fire, without smoke, that their flesh may be easily detracted from
their spina; then the separated flesh must be brayed in a stone-Morter, with a
wooden-Pestel, exactly: whereunto, in pulveration, a third or fourth part of
dry pulverated white-bread must be adjected, that six dragms, or one ounce of
bread, may respond to four ounces of flesh. He that adds more bread, makes the
Pastils more imbecile; and he that adds less, more efficacious.

The flesh and bread thus mixed by triture, and subacted into Paste, must be
made into Pastils or Orbicles. They act perperously, who inject any of the
broth, wherein this flesh was decocted, into the triture; for so it becomes
too humid, the Trochisks thereof too rancid, contracting filth, and not easy
to be exsiccated: they must be small, and composed with hands anointed with the
Oil of Balm, Cloves, or Nutmeg; they must be reposed, dried, and kept daily in
a dry, but not an aprique place.

They are endued with much virtue against the bitings of venenate Animals:
Vires.
from them the Theriack mutuates its so profitable a faculty, and all other
things that help the Leprosy, and bitings of mad Dogs.

CHAP. 2. Trochisci Hedychroi; or, Sweet Smelling Trochisks. D. Androm. out of
Galen.
Aloes-wood, Asarabacca-root, the herb Mastick, and sweet-Mar^oran, of each ij.
Calamus aromaticus, Squinant, Costus, Pontick Valerian, Opobalsamum,
Xylobalsamum, of each iij. Indian Leaf, Spikenard, Cassia-Lignea, Myrrh,
Saffron, of each vj. Amomi xij. Mastick j. all which, with generous Wine, bring
into a mass, which form into Pastils.

The COMMENTARY.
Andromachus did prudently, to write this description in Verses; for if he had
done otherwise, it would have retained little or nothing of its pristine
integrity, seeing Galen is found in the description, and in the defining the
dosis of the Simples. Rhasis and Avicenna are not excusable, who rather for
novelties or vanities sake, then want of Simples, changed the Trochisks: The
European Medicks do not subvert, but substitute in such compounds as are
rationally and legitimately described. And it is more easy to get the
descriptions of the Arabian and Grecian Medicaments, then the Simples whereof
they consist; though they must be very rare, if our Parisian Apothecaries
compass them not. He that has not all opportunely in readiness, may for
Asphalathum repose Citrian Santal; for Marum, true Majoran, or Dittany; for
Amaracum, Motherwort; for Costum, Angelica; for Xylobalsamum, Wood of Aloes or
Lentisks; for Cassia, Cinnamon; for Amomum, Acorus.

Rhasis and Avicenna add the bark of the root of Darsihahan; but what Plant
that is, is neither apparent by its name, form, nor faculties. They call these
Trochisci Andaracari; but Andromachus and Galen, Hedychroi; some, Idiocry, from
the author Idiocrius and Idiocrytus, that first composed it: for its
confection, first the roots must be prepared, then the Aromata's, afterward
the rest; but Saffron, Mastick, and Myrrh, which is last, must be prepated
apart, and first mixed with wine; then the other Powders; at length, the Oil of
Balm, or for want thereof, of Cloves: these all brayed and subacted, will make
a mass, whereof Trochisks must be made, and dried in a shade.

But these are not made, save when Theriack calls for them; therefore they are
only dispensed in small quantity, Vires.
yet consisting of many efficacious Simples: they may be given alone, for the
cure of many evils; as Aetius noted in a certain rich man, who desired an
odorate Medicine for the cure of his Ozena; to whom he gave these Pastils,
subacted with old odorate fragrant wine: and, says he, it was strange to see
how soon his affection was cured.

CHAP. 3. Trochisci Stillitici; or, Trochisks of Squills. D.Androm.
of baked Squills lb j. the flower of Orobs viij. beat them in a Mortar, and
make thereof a Paste; of which, form Troches, and dry them in a shade.

The COMMENTARY.
These Pastils of Squills are also made for Theriacks sake, which should, by
Galen's advice, be made after this manner: Squills must be collected in the
middle of June, their exterior bark deraded, the inferior parts, whereby they
adhere to their fibrous Rudicles, must be cut off, separated, and abjected;
they must be involved in Barley Paste well subacted, not in Clay; and then
cocted in hot ashes, or rather in a furnace or oven, till the Paste be hard,
and the Squills soft; then their exterior crust, and interior pith, must be
taken, washed, and brayed in a Mortar: whereunto, a third part of the cribrated
flower of white Orobs must be adjected, as eight ounces of Orobs, to one pound
of Squills; all which, well subacted, make a mass, whereof Trochisks may be
formed, which must be dried in the shade.

The true and best Squills must be selected, as the Spanish Squills; they
should be evelled in July or August, or a little sooner or later, when their
whole stalk and leaves are crupted.

White Ervy or Orobs also must be chosen, not yellowish; which are not so
amare, and yet more alexiterial: some take the root of white Dittany, in stead
of white Ervy; but Ervy being frequent, it is better, with Andromachus and
Galen, to admit of the genuine description, then substitute any thing without
necessity, and defraud the Author of his mind.

Trochisks of Squills incide viscid and crass humors, Vires.
take away infarctures, hinder putretude, cure the Epilepsie, and venenate
discases.

CHAP. 4. Trochisci Cypheos. D.Androm.
of the pulp of Raisins, well cleansed from their stones and skins, pure
Turpentine, of each xxiiij. Myrrh, Squinant, of each j.ss. Cinnamon ss.
Bdellium, Spikenard, Cassia-Lignea, Cyprus-root, Juniper Berries, of each iij.
Calamus Aromaticus ix. Aloes-wood ij. ss. Saffron j. of the best Honey, as much
as will suffice, with a little wine, to make them into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
Cyphi is an ancient word, denoting Perfumes and Odoraments, from whence
Mithridates cognominates these Trochisks, which Damocrates afterward described
in Verse: they consist of many odorate simples, which give a convenient name,
and commendable effect to the confection; which the King of Pontus well knew,
when he mixed them with his Antidote, which he would denominate after his own
name.

The preparation is neither difficult, nor laborious; the Myrrh and Bdellium
must first be diduced in generous wine: whereunto, Turpentine must be first
added; then the pulp of cleansed Raisins, and then the Powders: all must be
received, and subacted in despumed Honey into a mass; whereof Trochisks may be
formed, which must be dried in a shade, and reposed and kept in a glass or
earthen pot.

They are not only used in perfecting Mithridate, Vires.
but are given alone to Ulcers, and many affections of the Lungs and Liver.

CHAP. 5. Trochisci Galliae Moschatae. D.Mes.
of the best Aloes-wood ij.ss. Amber j. Mosch ss. Gum-Thraganth dissolved in
Rose Water, as much as will suffice to make it into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
The word Gallia no little troubled Jac. Manlius, in seeking to accommodate the
reason of that name to these Trochisks: one while he refers it to an
odoriferous Herb; another while to some Province in France: but that Herb is
fictitious, and Mesue never dreamed of France in his life: Neither is it
probable did he design this Composition by the name of Gallia; for aromatical
Confections are by the Arabians called Alephanginae, as consisting of hotter
Aromata's; and sometimes by Rhasis, Ramich; and more specially Such, when they
are compounded of Musk, Amber, Civet, and such suaveolent things. But these may
rather be called the sweet Trochisks of Aloes-wood, then of Gallia. Yet I do
not yield to change the name, which a whole age has received and approved:
neither will I labor in the pervestigation of the name, where I know the thing.

For their preparation, each must be brayed apart; and first Aloes-wood, then
Amber, last Musk; then all must be received in Tragacanthum diluted in
Rose Water, and made into Trochisks, which will emit a pleasant halite: but
Pharmacopolists keep them more for sanity then for suavity. There is much
mention of them in many Medicaments which they ingrede.

They recreate the heart, Vires.
brain, and spirits, commend the odor of the body, roborate the imbecility and
vomitory distemper of childrens ventricles, and resartiate lost strength.

CHAP. 6. Trochisci Aliptae Moschatae. D.N.Sal.
Ladanum iij. Storax ij. ss. Aloes-wood ij. Amber j. Camphyr ss. Mosch j. and
with Rose Water, let them be formed into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
These Trochisks are seldomer made then the former, although in halite, suavity
and odor, they are very affine: they are laboriously made, after Salernitanus
his description; but easily thus: Ladanum must be brayed in a hot
Copper-Morter, with a hot Iron-Pestel, in Rose Water, till by much duction and
agitation, it become like a smooth Unguent, without the least asperity; then
must the Storax be added, and much diduced with the Pestel; afterward
Xylo-aloes, Camphyr, Musk, and Amber, washed apart in a little Rose Water in
another vessel, all brayed, confusedly mixed, and subacted into a mass, may be
made into Trochisks, dried in a shade, and reposed in pots.

They most efficaciously corroborate the brain, heart, liver, Vires.
ventricle, and all nutritive parts, and refresh the spirits.

CHAP. 7. Pastilli Nerae. D.N.
of the best Amber j. Aloes-wood iij. Mosch ss. Camphyr gr. ij. and with
musilidge of Gum-Thraganth, or liquid Amber, form them into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
The Trochisks of Nera, so called, as it is credited, from the Inventor, are
very precious, and very rarely confected, save for Princes and Kings: neither
should they be prepared in great quantity, and kept in shops, but be forthwith
confected, when use calls for them: they differ from those of Gallia, only in
the dosis of the Simples, and superaddition of Camphyr. That they may be duly
confected, the Amber must be mollified in a hot Mortar, with a hot Pestel, and
Aloes-wood, very small pulverated, added to it; then the Musk must be brayed
alone, and last of all the Camphyr: all must be well agitated, subacted, and
mollified, and a little Oil, liquid Amber, or Opobalsamum superadded, that they
may be coacted into a more convenient mass; whereof Pastils may be formed.

They have the same faculties with Trochisks of Gallia, but more efficacious:
Noblemen oftener use them for Persumes.

CHAP. 8. Trochisci de Caphura; or, Trochisks of Camphyr. D.Myr.
of Camphyr ss. Saffron ij. Storax iij. red Roses, Gum-Arabick, Thraganth,
shavings of Ivory, of each ss. the seeds of Cucumer and Purslain, Liquorice
beaten, of each j. and with musilidge of Fleabit-seed, made in Rose Water, make
them into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
Of the various sorts of Trochisks of Camphyr described by the Ancients, that
is only made, which Mesue prescribes for hot Fevers, the ardour of Bile, and
of the Liver, Blood and Ventricle, and thirst inextinguishable; but it
consisting of many hot Simples, as Spikenard, Xylo-aloes, Saffron, and
Cardamome, I cannot easily conjecture, how it can effect these things. I
exhibit others of the same name, much better, more efficacious for those ends,
and more casie to make, out of Myrepsus; in whose description, I find nothing
mutable, but the order of the Simples: only in stead of Spodium, if there be
any such thing besides Pompholix, or the Grecian, I would rather exhibit crude
Ivory then burnt, for many reasons before-urged. The preparation is neither
troublesome nor laborious: the powder or scrapings of Ivory must be levigated
apart, and also the other simples, Saffron, Camphyr, Amylum, Roses and
Liquorice; the Gummes must be brayed in a hot Mortar, Cucumers-seed must be
decorticated, then minutely cut and levigated; then must they all be received
in the musilidge of Fleabane, and made into a Paste for Trochisks.

They mitigate the heat of the liver and other bowels, Vires.
temperate the acrimony of Bile, and stay the fluor of humors delabing upon
^he Lungs.

CHAP. 9. Trochisci Diarrhodon. D.Mes.
of red Roses j. Liquorice ss. Spikenard, Aloes-wood, of each ij. and ij.
Mastick ij. burnt Ivory iiij. Saffron ij. make them into Troches with
white wind.

The COMMENTARY.
Various Authors give various descriptions of these Pastils: for every one at
his pleasure adds, detracts, perverts, changes, and oftentimes designs the
same Medicament with diverse names, calling two or three by one word of the same
acceptance. Besides this of the Trochisks of Diarrhodon, or of Roses, Mesue
describes others, whose significations include others. Their reasons are
futilous, who endeavor to prove the diversity of these, from the diversity of
names: But if I may, with an approved Author, speak my mind, I will call these
the Trochisks of Diarrhodon, and not of Roses; whose preparation further to
declare, were superfluous, seeing it bears nothing of difficulty in it. In
stead of Spodium, we put the vulgar Antispodium, which is burnt Ivory.

They cure pituitous, Vires.
inveterate, and implicit Fevers; they allay the dolours of the ventricle, and
deterge the humors adherent thereunto: they are mixed in many great compounds
described by Mesue.

There are other Troches of Diarrhodon described by Myrepsus, which are made
after this manner:

of red Roses iij. Spodium ij. red Sanders j. ss. gr. vij. white Sanders j. gr.
xij. Saffron ij. ss. Camphyr ss. which with Rose Water form into Troches.

CHAP. 10. Trochisci de Carabe; or, Troches of Amber. D.Mes.
Amber j. Hartshorn burnt, Gum-Arabick burnt, Thraganth, Coral burnt, Acacia,
Juice of Cystus, Balaustians, Mastick, black Poppy-seed, of each ij. and ij.
Olibanum, Saffron, Opium, of each ij. and with the mufilidge of Fleabane-seed,
form them into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
I have selected these Pastils of Mesue, as most efficacious amongst fifteen of
that name, described by as many Authors: a great part whereof are only
nominally like these. They are denominated from Amber, which the Arabians call
Karabe; and the Graecians Electrum; which is very good to roborate the bowels,
cohibit bloody flux, and stay the Rheumatism of the Uterus. Its incrassative
faculty is augmented by the interjection of Gum and Opium; its astrictive
faculty by the shrubs of Cistus and Acacia; Opium is castigated by Saffron; the
ventricle is roborated by Mastick; all are comprehended in the musilidge of
Fleabane, and the asperity of their parts levigated. Mesue commands many things
to be burned for their preparation; but if they be admitted crude, the
Medicament will be no worse: for if Hartshorn or Coral have any eximious
virtue in them, it is probable they have it while crude, and not by ustion. I
am not ignorant, what ustion conduces to Medicaments, what it takes from them,
or what it adds to them; only some are so weak, that they will not endure
such preparation without much loss: But let those burn them that will, so they
retain their faculties with their ashes. Acacia and Hypocistis should be first
minutely cut, then pulverated with Pomegranate-flowers, and then the rest:
Trochisks may be made of all of them, brayed in order, and by art, with the
musilidge of Fleabane.

They are roborative and astrictive: Vires.
one dragm of them taken in Plantain or Rose Water, stay all flux of blood,
especially from the upper region of the body, the Lungs, Liver, Reins, Uterus
and Haemorrhoids; they cure the Dysentery, whether assumed at the mouth, or
injected at the Fundament.

CHAP. 11. Trochisci de Antispodio; or, Trochisks of Antispodium. D.Mes.
of red Roses vij. Antispodium, or burnt Ivory ss. Purslain-seed, Juice of
Liquorice, of each ij. and with the musilidge of Fleabaneseed, make them into
Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
If we may babble with others, we shall call these Pastils, the Trochisks of
Spodium, though unwillingly; for Spodium is not Basis, but rather Antispodium,
which vulgar Apothecaries usurp for the burnt roots of Tabaxir: But let that
Pseudospodium, and the Arabian Spodium be gone, these Trochisks are made and
denominated from Antispodium, so called by us, with the addition of Roses,
Purslain-seed, and Liquorice-juyce, complected in the succe of Fleabane.

And thus made, Vires.
they do not only ingrede the composition of the Electuary of Psyllam, but are
given alone in acute Fevers, inflammations of the Liver, and vehement
thirstings.

Mesue gives others more compound, admitting of Sorrel-feed, the pulp of
Sumach, Amylum, Coriander, Pomegranate-flowers, Berberries, and Gumme-Arabick
excepted in the succe of Omphacium: But they are less usual, and agree not with
the said Electuary.

CHAP. 12. Trochisci de Berberis; or, Trochisks of Berberries.
of the berries of Berberries with their Juice, of the Juice of Liquorice, the
seeds of Purslain, burnt Ivory, of each iij. red Roses vj. Spikenard, Saffron,
Starch, Thraganth, of each j. Camphyr ss. and with Manna dissolved in the Juice
of Berberries, make them into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue has another description of the same name, but now obsolete. Serapio,
A^icenna, and others that write Antidotaries, have many also; but this, as
best, may serve in stead of all: which must be thus prepared: The Spikenard,
Purslain-seed, and Liquoricejuyce, must first be incided, then brayed with
Roses; but Spodium, Amylum, Camphyr, and Tragacamhum, apart: when all are
brayed, they must with Manna be excepted in the melted succe of Berberries, and
made into a mass for Trochisks.

They are commended in hot Fevers, Vires.
and the hot distemper of the Liver and Ventricle; as also in inextinguishable
thirst, and flux of the Belly: they also accede the composition of the
Electuary of Sea-leeks, according to Mesue's description; who, according to his
Interpreters traduction, calls them Trochisks of Oxyacantha: but they ingrede
not the Electuary of Roses delivered by Mesue, as Foesius thinks. They are made
in small quantity, because they serve most for other compositions.

CHAP. 13. Trochisci Gordonii.
of the four greater cool seeds picked, of the seeds of white Poppy, Mallows,
Cotton, Purslain, Quinces, Myrtles, Gum-Arabick, Thraganth, Pine-kernels,
Pistacks, Sugar Candy, Penidees, Liquorice, Barley, the musilidge of Fleabane,
sweet Almonds excorticated, of each ij. Bole-Armeniack, Dragons-blood, Spodium,
Rose-leaves, Myrrh, of each ss. and with Hydromel make them into Troches; let
every one weigh j.

The COMMENTARY.
These Pastils are by Bauderonius faithfully, by Joubertus depravedly
described; for he changed not only the weight of the Simples, but adjoined
others too precious, and not necessary. Their composition is manifold, for they
consist of refrigeratives, detersives, astrictives, roboratives, lenitives, and
some apertives: some of them are prepared by vulgar triture, pulverated solely
by the percussion of a Pestel; as the roots, woods, harder seeds, gummes,
Bolearmeniack, and Myrrh: yet these two last should not be pulverated
confusedly, but apart. Some must first be cut small, then brayed, and mixed
with others; when they are all well brayed, they must be confusedly mixed with
the succe of Sea-onyons and Hydromel, and so coacted for Trochisks.

Now for Dragons-blood, we must neither take Dioscorides his Cinnabris, nor
with Pliny, the blood of a Serpent, or other Animal; nor yet any thing made of
Cynople, Bole-armeniack, or Sorbes and Bricks brayed and subacted; but the
Lachryma of a certain exotical tree called Draco, as we have taught in our Book
of Simples.

Gordonius prescribes them to the Ulcers of the Reins; Vires.
and they are also good for the Ulcers of other internal parts; for they
leniate, deterge, allay acrimony, and roborate: One dragm exhibited in Milk,
much helps internal Ulcers; which, if they be in the Bladder, it must be
distempered with Milk, and projected by a pipe.

CHAP. 14. Trochisci de Capparibus; or, Troches of Capers.
of the bark of the roots of Capers, Vine-seed, of each vj. Gumme-Ammoniacum
ss. Gith, Calamint, Acorus, bitter Almonds, Cressseeds, Rue, round Birthwort,
Juice of Egrimony, boiled up to a good consistence, of each j. which after
triture, with Ammoniacum dissolved, form them into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
We have admitted of Mesue's old description, without any immutation, as
performing what it pollicitates; for these, of all incisive and reserative
Trochisks, are the most efficacious, consisting of many things, which attenuate
and incide crass, melancholical, and terrene humors, take away infarctures,
and mollify hardness. Whereunto, if any will add of the Gum of Lacca and
Madder, an. j. he shall make them much more efficacious; and he shall not need
Trochisks of Lacca, because the Trochisks of Capers are enough, according to
Plantius, for the obstructions of the Spleen, and old affections. Both these
and the superior are made alike. Ammoniack must be dissolved in Vinegar,
cocted to the consistence of Honey, and therein the Powders subacted for
Trochisks.

They are much commended against all obstructions, Vires.
hardness, inflations, and preternatural tumors in the Spleen and Liver: they
help in the King's Evil, and the beginning Dropsy; they take away infarctures,
and discuss flatulency: their dosis is one dragm with tenuious wine, or the
water of the decoction of Capers-roots, ashes, or Tamarisks-bark. Mesue says,
some make them more valid, by duplicating the Ammoniack.

CHAP. 15. Trochisci de Myrrha; or, Trochisks of Myrrh. D.Rhas.
of Myrrh iij. Lupines v. Rue, Horsemint, Penyroyal, Cumin, Madder,
Assafoetida, Opoponax, of each ij. and with the Juice of Mugwort, make them
into Troches, every one weighing ij.

The COMMENTARY.
These Trochisks described by Rhasis, denominated from Myrrh, and used by all
Medicks, must in no wise be omitted; to whose composition, many things accede,
which liberate the Mesentery from obstructions, diduce the passages, take away
infarctures, and potently deturb such humors as either with their abundance
aggravate, or quality offend. That they may be duly confected, the Gummes must
be melted in the hot decoction or succe of Mugwort; then trajected through a
linen cloth, to dissipate their aqueous humidity, that they may be of the
consistence of Honey.

Hereunto must the other simples, when pulverated very small, be added: for
such things as remove obstructions, open passages, and protrude any matter
forth, should be levigated very small: for Asarum, and many simples redacted to
most subtle dust by triture, move urine copiously, which when brayed more
crassly, stay longer, and work more dully.

These Pastils are frequently used, when fluors retard their course, when
secunds are retained, and lochia suppressed: they are given from j. to ij. ss.
and sometimes to iij. with water, or a fit decoction.

CHAP. 16. Trochisci Alexiterii; or, Alexiterial, or Trochisks against the
Plague.
of the roots of Gentian, Tormentil, Florentine-Orris, Setwel, of each ij.
Cinnamon, Cloves, Mace, of each ss. Ginger j. Angelicaroot ij. Coriander
prepared, Rose-leaves, of each j. Citron-pill dried ij. make of these a Powder,
and with the Juice of Liquorice vj. make it into a soft Paste; of which form
either Troches or Rolls.

The COMMENTARY.
These Trochisks are very convenient for the prevention of the Plague; for a
little of them detained in ones mouth, leaves a grateful sapour, and an odor
which arceates and emends the malign quality of the inquinated air, hindering it
from infecting the spirits: for such things as are insipid and inodorate, as
Unicorns-horn, Bezaar-stone, Margarites, Precious-stones, and many more
obsistents to poison, exert their faculties, only when ingested into the body,
or some way infused; which are almost inefficacious, if only contained in the
mouth, emitting no sapour or halite, whereby the ferity of the air may be tamed.

But these Trochisks, whether they be only detained in the mouth, or ingested
into the ventricle, they are of eximious faculties, and most efficacious in
evincing pestilent poison. That they may be duly made, the Liquorice juice,
wherein the powders must be excepted, must be mollified in St. Mary's Bath,
till it be ducible, and may be concorporated with the whole quantity of
powders; which, to the perite, will be but easy, though to the inexpert it
seems too operous: who may add thereto a little Hypocras, or such convenient
liquor, that he may have the Paste soft for Pastils. What Hypocras is, is well
known; it is made of lb ij. of blackish Wine, lb ss. of Sugar, and ss. of
Cinnamon: some add ss. of Ginger, and j. of Cloves.

CHAP. 17. Trochisci Hysterici; or, Hysterical Troches.
Assafoetida, Galbanum, of each ij. ss. Myrrh ij. Castoreum j.ss. Asarabacca,
Savine, Birthwort, Nep, Motherwort, of each j. Dittany ss. and either with the
Juice, or the decoction of Rue, make them into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
We call these our Pastils Hysterical, because they cure the aberration of the
Uterus, and other hysterical affections; for being assumed, they compel, stay,
and hinder the Uterus, or vapors from thence ascending upwards, and those most
grievous symptoms which follow thereupon: For the Uterns delighting in odorate
things, though not under the species of odor, is resisted by these foetid
Trochisks from its ascent: and further, by opening the passages, and loosing
obstructions, they protrude the prave humors that are in woman's continents.

They are easily made, if the pulverables be pulverated small, and be
comprehended in the Gummes macerated in the decoction or succe of Rue strained,
and elixated to the consistence of Honey.

They cure the foetid colors of Virgins and Widows, Vires.
and help all those symptoms which proceed from the filthy vapors of the
sperm, or of corrupt menstruous blood, or of the Uterus ascending to the
Midriff.

CHAP. 18. Trochisci ad Gonorrhaeam; or, Trochisks for the flux of Sperm.
of the seeds of the white Vine, and Lettice, Roses, Pomegranateflowers, of
each j. shavings of Ivory, Amber, of each j. ss. Bolearmeniack washed in
Knotgrass-water ij. Plantain-seed iiij. Sassafras ij. and with the musilidge of
Quince-seeds, extracted in the water of Water Lillies, make them into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
The flux of Sperm is either voluntary, as in copulation; or involuntary, as
when it flows without venery: and that flux is either simple, participating of
no malign quality, proceeding either from the plenitude and quality of the
seed, or from labor, running, equitation, and too much use of hot peppered
things; or else it is virulent, which is contracted by impure congress,
together with the French Pox; wherein white poison, or greenly flave, falls
from the seminals, without sense, whether waking or sleeping. This disease is
often as ill in women as men, especially when it is so strong, as it can creep
over, and affect all the parts of the body.

Our Pastils are good for both; Vires.
for the simple, if the body be before blooded; and for the virulent, while
incipient, and not inveterate, if the body be once or twice purged before, and
the blood diminished: they are given with the decoction of the seeds of Poppy
and Melons, or with Rose Water. Their dosis is from j. to ij. ss. or iij. at
the most. These, as also the precedents, are easy to make.

Of two sorts of Trochisks which are extrinsecally adhibited.
CHAP. 19. Trochisci Narcotici; or, Narcotical Trochisks. D.Fern.
Gummes of Arabic and Thraganth, Starch, of each ss. Ceruse washed in
Rose Water vj. Storax, Myrrh, Castoreum, Opium dissolved in Sape, of each
iiij. Saffron ss. let all these be beaten, and with the musilidge of
Fleabane-seed, form them into Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
There are yet two usual sorts of Pastils only adhibited extrinsecally, which
we rather here adjoyn, then defer to the second Part of our Shop, though it
treat of Medicaments extrinsecally adhibited: the former of them Fernelius
calls Narcotical Trochisks, because when applied, they drown the sense, by
stupefying the part. The composition of these is apt, their use necessary, and
none of like efficacy have been known. For their preparation, all their
ingredients must be brayed apart, and then mixed confusedly, and excepted in
the succe of the seed of Fleabane, and coacted for Trochisks.

These Pastils duly applied, Vires.
drown the dolours of head and tooth-aches: they procure sleep in the ardour of
Fevers; they extinguish St. Anthony's fire, and inflammations; they allay the
dolours of all external parts.

CHAP. 20. Trochisci Albi; or, White Trochisks. D.Rhas.
Ceruse washed in Rose Water x. clear Sarcocolla x. Starch ij. Gumme-Arabick,
Thraganth, of each j. Camphyr ss. and with woman's Milk, make them into little
Troches.

The COMMENTARY.
The Arabians enumerate these Trochisks amongst Sief or Collyries. The
Neotericks have very much changed their old description; for some have added
Gumme-Arabick, others Amylum; some reject Opium, and substitute Camphyr: for
thus the Pastils are whiter, and more efficacious and useful in ocular
affections; but in bitter dolours, Opium should be added, or they should be
prepared after two manners, as Joubertus says, with or without Opium, as the
exigence requires; or a little Opium may be added when use calls for them. The
preparation is so easy, as it needs no further explication.

They are very conducible to many ocular affections: Vires.
for they allay their dolours, mitigate their inflammations, stay their
fluxions, deterge, exsiccate and digest the matter, and roborate the part.

Now I think I have recenseated the most usual and principal Pastils which
should be kept in Pharmacopolies: for others, which occur in vulgar
Antidotaries, are either of none use, or disapproved; or else they may be
easily comprehended under these, and supplied by them.

Finis Libri Tertii.
THE SECOND PART OF The Apothecaries Shop, OR, ANTIDOTARY. Of EXTERNAL
MEDICAMENTS, Distinct into three BOOKS.
In the first whereof we shall treat of all kinds of Oils; and add thereunto
an Appendix of Balsams.
THE PREFACE.
TOpical Medicaments are many, as Fomentations; Epithems, Liniments, Collyries,
Lotions, Frontals, Cataplasms, Synapisms, Dropax, Vesiccatories, Bucklers,
Bags, Coifes, and many more, which are made for present use, and will not keep
long without corruption; whereof we have treated at large in the fifth Book of
our Institutions: Others may be kept a whole year or two without damage, for
future uses; as Oils, Cerates, Unguents, and Salves; whereof we have purposed
to treat in this second Part of our Shop: whose use is both more grateful and
tolerable, then those that are ingested at the mouth; for such, by oppugning
diseases, subvert the Ventricle, take away Appetite, excite Torments, and
disturb the whole economy of Nature. Whence Cornelius Celsus would have
Medicaments and Potions seldom used; for seeing they can scarce be exhibited
in a just dosis, or when exhibited, do their office, seeing they often move,
but move not thoroughly, or propel laudable humors, deserting the malign, or
leaving the internals distempered: They are sometimes perilous; for Aetius
knew an imperite MEdick, who by the undue exhibition of a Medicament, killed a
man: But Topical Medicaments are safe, and may be usurped, not only to
external, but internal vices. For as we seeing Extuberancies appear without,
use purges to coerceate the exuperant humors: So when we are infested with
something within, we often apply Unguents, Oils, and Liniments without. For
whether the Stomach or Liver, Reins, or other interior bowel be pained, much
help may be administered by due external applications: For all the Medicaments
of old were external, which the Ancients, following their Captain Nature, used,
without experience; and Contrymen yet hurt with a blow, a fall, cut, or
knock, without choice assume the first occurrent Plant, and apply it to the
part affected; and it often falls out, that a noxious Medicament, upon strong
natures, produce successful effects. Now we shall in these three Books, show
what Medicaments Topical are best, which should be kept in Pharmacopolies, and
how they are made. And as we have methodically proceeded in the three former;
First, describing the most liquid, as Syrupes; then the more crass, as Eclegms;
then the most crass, as Electuaries; and last, the most solid, as Pills and
Trochisks: So now, in the three later Books we shall begin with Oils first;
then pass to the more spisse, as Unguents; and then to the most crass, as
Emplaisters. Taking then our rise from Oils, whereof Cerates, Unguents, and
Emplaisters matuate much of their parts; we shall first treat of such as are
made by impression or infusion; then fly to such as are made by expression; and
at last to such as are elicited by ascent or descent.

The Apothecaries Shop, OR, ANTIDOTARY. THE FOURTH BOOK. Of Topical or External
Medicaments.
AND FIRST, Of Medicinal Oils made by infusion.
Oils, whereof there is frequent use in Medicine, are either simple, or
compound: Those are simple, which have nothing from Art, but their eduction;
admitting of no mixture, but educed by expression; as Oil, simply so called,
expressed from mature, and Omphacinum, from immature Olives; as also the Oil of
Almonds, the Oil of Walnuts, and many more, expressed out of fruits and seeds,
which mutuate their various qualities from the variety of seeds whence they are
educed; as hot Oils from hot; cold, from cold seeds, etc. Oil absolutely so
termed, is meant of that only which is extracted from mature Olives; whose
expression appertains no more to Apothecaries, then the expression of Wine, or
confection of Bread, as to their manners how: which laborious work and business
is duly committed to Rusticks, and diuturnal laborers. Seeing all these are
aliments, and fitter for Tables then Shops, therefore an Apothecary should not
solicit himself about the expression of common Oil, but about such as are
elicited merely by Art: Of all which we shall treat in this Book. In whose
former Section, we shall examine all such as are made by impression or infusion
of Medicaments, beginning with the Oil of Violets, which are the first flowers
of the Spring.

CHAP. 1. Oleum Violatum; or, Oil of Violets.
of washed Oil lb v. of the flowers of Violets fresh and bruised, of the Juice
or water of the infusion of Violets lb ij. Insolate them together for a whole
week; then take out the Violets by a strong expression, and new ones put in,
afterward boil it till the water be consumed.

The COMMENTARY.
All the Students in Pharmacy, with one consent, follow the dictates of Mesue
their Captain, whom they extol with praises, and adore with admiration: Yet his
Laws and Precepts in compounding Medicaments, cannot by duration challenge to
themselves infallibility; for we see many of them improved, and many disproved:
and it is no imprudence to recede from him, or any old Author, though they
merit most of praise, when one sees by long use and experience, a better and
more compendious way. And thus we have something detracted from, or something
added to the composition of some Medicaments, or their method changed. Thus
they dissent in Medicinal Oils, made by infusion and maceration; as in this Oil
of Violets, to whose confection Mesue commands the Oil of mature Olives, and of
Almonds or Sesama to be taken and washed; then the flowers to be macerated
seven days therein, insolated and expressed; afterward to be cocted three
hours in a double vessel; and this to be interated thrice, the expressed
flowers being always abjected, and fresh ones immitted; and then to be cocted
on a slow fire, till the watery humidity be dissipated, and then they reposed in
a fit vessel.

Many Apothecaries follow this prescript; others will not swear to his words,
but follow the dictate of their own Reasons, and change some things ever and
anon: for it is easy to add, when a thing is invented, or detract something
that is superfluous, or castigate what is ill disposed.

But the Oil of Violets is now made everywhere, almost, after this manner:
First, a certain quantity of sincere common Oil is assumed, verberated, and
washed in Fountain Water, and imposed in a glass, or earthen vessel well
glazened; new Violet flowers are infused therein, and so macerated a whole
week, and if the season permit, insolated; then they are boiled a little on a
slow fire, that they may be expressed; afterward, new flowers are immitted, as
before, and expressed; which is thrice iterated: then the flowers, after the
last infusion, are abjected, the Oil cocted on a flow fire, till its aqueous
humidity be dissipated; and then it is reposed and kept in a fit vessel.

The Oil of Violets extinguishes inflammations, Vires.
helps the Pleurisy, leniates the asperity of the Artery and Lungs, allays hot
impost^umes, remits all inflammations, and mitigates dolours.

CHAP. 2. Oleum Keirinum; or, Oil of Wall-flowers. D.Mes.
of Wall-flowers vij. of the best Oil lb j. ss. of the water of the decoction
of the flowers iij. ss. mingle them, and after insolation, express the flowers,
adding the same three times over; boil the water away, and preserve the Oil.

The COMMENTARY.
The copious Wall-flowers occur next, which the Arabians call Keiri; out of
which, Mesue educes Oil by impression, as he does out of Chamomile and Roses;
that is, by three infusions, insolated and expressed, with a little of the
succe or decoction of the same flowers, which after the last maceration, he
absumes by gentle coction; and having expressed and strained the Oil, he
reposes it in a fit vessel, and keeps it. But it is now commonly made by one or
two infusions, without any commixtion of any succe or decoction; the flowers
being left a whole month confusedly immerged in the Oil before colature: but
this manner is not good; for hereby the Oil is more turbid, and its faculties
weaker.

Being duly made, it calefies moderately, attenuates, allays, Vires.
digests, mitigates dolours from flatulency, cold, or pituitous matter; it
benefits such as are gowty or paralytical, and cures the dolours of the nerves
and junctures.

CHAP. 3. Oleum Irinum; or, Oil of Orris.
of the roots of Orris lb j. the flowers of the same lb ij. macerate them in a
sufficient quantity of the decoction of the same root, adding sweet Oil, or Oil
of the Pulse Sesamum lb v. Boil them in an idoneous vessel, strain out the
roots and flowers, adding a fresh quantity three times over; and the Oil which
is last pressed out, keep for future use.

The COMMENTARY.
There are many sorts of Orris, which we have enumerated in our book of
Simples: the best whereof, is the Celestial Orris; next, the white or
Florentine. Oil is made by infusion out of both, but especially the former,
their roots and flowers being macerated and expressed, as is declared: some
take only the roots a little brayed, and their flowers tunded, and coct them
with the succe of other roots, and then pour Oil upon them, and elixate them
again, till all the water be absumed; and the Oil thus made, is very odorate
and efficacious: yet it would be more efficacious, if this were twice or thrice
iterated, as of old.

There is no dissension amongst Authors about the proportion of the flowers to
the roots, seeing all give twice as much flowers as roots: but they agree not
about the other roots, which must be elixated in the water, and about the water
it self; nor yet about the Oil wherein it must be infused. But leaving, for
brevities sake, the variety of opinions about this matter, we say, That one
pound of roots must be taken, and cocted in four or five pounds of water at the
most, till half be absumed. Some add to this definite weight of roots,
flowers, and water, only two pounds of Oil; others, seven pounds and a half;
and others, eight pounds: I mix five pounds, and coct them all on a slow fire,
till the watery humidity be dissolved.

It calefies, Vires.
mollifies, tenuates, digests, resolves, concocts, penetrates, opens, ripens,
takes away the founding in the ears, discusses biles and other hard tumors,
emends the cramp and native foetour, and allayes dolours from cold matter.

CHAP. 4. Oleum Rosatum completum; or, complete Oil of Roses. D.Mes.
of common Oil washed lb iiij. fresh Rose-leaves lb j. ss. infusion of Roses lb
j. put them into a close vessel well covered; insolate them for seven days;
then boil them in a strong vessel upon a gentle fire for half an hour:
afterward let the flowers be expressed, new put in; and this repeated three
times; at last, what Oil is pressed out, preserve for use.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue calls this the complete Oil of Roses, because it is made of Oil of
mature Olives, frequently washed, and the leaves of red Roses perfectly
explicited, insolated a whole week, and thrice changed, as it is in the
description, wherein we have given a just definite weight of each out of Mesue,
who left all to every man's judgment and will, except the water of the infusion
of the Roses, which he equalized with the Oil: we believe a third or fourth
part will be sufficient for the Oil; for when it is put in more quantity, it is
not easily resolved by infusion; and Oil, by longer coction, acquires alien
calour, and loses much of its native suavity. The other three descriptions
given by Mesue, we omit.

The ablution of Oil is multifarious; for it is either put in some pot or fit
vessel with some water, and long verberated, so that it may be easily separated
when the water is settled; or in a glass vial, whose bottom is perforated, where
it is long agitated, having both its orifice and inferior foramen occluded;
then let it stand an hour, and the inferior foramen being opened, the water
that did subside will flow out; the same being shut, the Oil will remain in the
vial: whereunto sometimes more water is affunded. But we have abundantly
disserted about the preparation of Medicaments, in our Institutions.

The Oil of complete Roses extinguishes inflammations, roborates, Vires.
cocts, densates, tempers the hot ventricle, and recreates it; allayes the
ardour of the reins, cures headache from a hot cause, stays fluxions, and
cohibits the force of humors.

CHAP. 5. Oleum Rosatum Omphacinum, vulgo dicitur incompletum; or, the Oil of
incomplete Roses.
of the washed Oil of unripe Olives lb iiij. of Rose-buds lb j. mingle them in
a fit vessel, and insolate them for seven days; repeat the same three times
over, and make thereof an Oil.

The COMMENTARY.
This is called incomplete Oil, because it is made of Roses not completely
expanded, and of Oil expressed from immature Olives, which is called Omotribes,
crude, green, and Omphacian-Oyl; which is extracted solely for Medicinal uses:
in whose want, we substitute common Oil washed in Omphacium, that it may
acquire acidity, and a refrigerative faculty. The Roses must be red, new, and
not perfectly explicated; which must be purged from their white parts, brayed
in a stone-morter with a wooden-pestel, macerated in Oil, insolated a whole
week, and then expressed: these Roses being abjected, other fresh ones must be
immitted, insolated, and expressed, and the Oil extracted kept for use.

This Oil refrigerates and roborates much, Vires.
and therefore helps such diseases as proceed from a hot cause; extinguishes
St. Anthonies fire, allayes ardours, cohibits the flux of humors, and
mitigates the heat of the ventricle and bowels.

CHAP. 6. Oleum Rosatum simplex, ac vulgar; or, simple and vulgar Oil of Roses.
of common Oil washed lb ij. ss. Roses cut from their whites and bruised lb j.
mingle them, infolate them forty days, then boil them, till the evaporation of
the excrementitious humidity; afterward make a strong expression, and the Oil
expressed, keep for use.

The COMMENTARY.
This description of Oil of Roses, being the most simple and easy to make, is
most usual: but they consult their own ease, more then the diseased's sanity,
who will not make up any Medicament, that has to do with Art and Reason,
though it be never so easy. And thus Apothecaries now adays do, who take any
new Roses, though but reddish, and not exungulated, and macerate them forthwith
in Oil, exposing them to the Sun in a glass, or figuline vessel, by the space
of two months or more; afterward, when use calls for them, they coct them with
a little of the decoction or succe of Roses, and express them, and so repose
the expression.

Simple Oil of Roses has like faculties with Omphacium, Vires.
but weaker: yet the greatest part of Apothecaries use it both alone, and with
other Medicaments; and when a Medick for an inflammation prescribes an
Oxyrrhodinum, they take three parts of this Oil, and add a fourth of Vinegar,
and so confect their Oxyrrhodinum, or Vinegar of Roses.

CHAP. 7. Oleum Liliorum simplex; or, Simple Oil of Lillies. D.Mes.
of mature Oil lb ij. of the flowers of Lillies detracted from their yellow
filaments lb ss. or vij. ss. macerate, and insolate them; and by iterating
maceration and insolation, let the Oil be made as before described.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue gives two descriptions of this Oil: the one whereof is simple, which we
here exhibit, as better and more useful; the other more composititious, which
we omit as useless.

All do not make this alike; for some, contenting themselves with the most
simple preparation, infuse, insolate, and express the flowers only once,
others iterate all these thrice, and add a fourth part of the water of the
decoction of Lillies, to the Oil, which by slow coction they exhale: and the
Oil thus made, is most efficacious, and fit to be reposed for use; for by its
ternal maceration, insolation, and expression, it acquires more virtue.

It calefies moderately, Vires.
resolves, allayes dolours, from what cause soever; mitigates all acrimony, and
tempers all the ardours and dolours of the Breast, Ventricle, Reins, Uterus,
and Bladder.

CHAP. 8. Oleum Nenupharinum; or, Oil of Water Lillies.
washed Oil lb v. the flowers of Water Lillies purged from their herbaceous
part without, their filaments within lb ij. of the decoction of the same
flowers lb j. and iiij. let these be reposed in a fit vessel, insolated, and
expressed; and this reiterated three times, as before described.

The COMMENTARY.
This Oil is made after the same manner with that of Violets: The Oil, whether
mature or immature, must be first washed; for Mesue gives neither definitively:
However, the immature is more convenient and accommodate then the other; in
which, the flowers of the white, not luteous Water-Lilly, must be macerated,
and infused for a Senate; then must the whole be a little fervefied, and
expressed; having before received one pound and three ounces of the water of
the decoction of white Water-Lilly-flowers: when all this is again iterated,
and the aqueous humidity exhaled by a slow fire, the Oil expressed is duly
made, and may be reposed for use. But that the decoction which should be mixed
therewith, may be rightly taken, four ounces of the flowers of white
Water Lillies must be cocted in a pound and an half of Fountain Water, till
three or four ounces thereof be dissipated; and the colature hereof must be
mixed to the maceration.

It refrigerates more then Oil of Violets: it conciliates sleep, Vires.
allayes the heat of the Liver, Reins, and Bowels; obtunds Venery, hinders
stiffness of the Yard, and cures headaches from a hot cause.

CHAP. 9. Oleum de Mentha; or, Oil of Mint.
of Oil lb ij. ss. Garden-Mint lb j. of the Juice of the same vij. ss. mingle
them; exhibit them to the Sun seven days, afterward pressed out, and three
times fresh Mint put in, and the Oil expressed, preserved.

The COMMENTARY.
Some assume Omphacium to the confection of this Oil, that it may by its
stypticity roborate the ventricle; others take mature and complete Oil, that it
may califie more, and help concoction: whence some call it Eustomachical Oil.
Sative Mint should be selected crisp and green, whose leaves should be tunded
and macerated in Oil, and thrice changed, according to the prescript.

Oil of Mint calefies the cold, Vires.
and roborates the imbecile ventricle: it helps concoction, stays vomiting,
revokes appetite, helps the nauseative stomach, and discusses flatulency.

CHAP. 10. Oleum de Absynthio; or, Oil of Wormwood.
of common Oil lb v. Tops of Wormwood lb ij. Juice of the same lb j. and iiij.
mingle them, and macerate them, as before prescribed.

The COMMENTARY.
This Oil is of an uncertain Author: and though it be described by many, yet
the proportion of the Wormwood to the Oil, is always diverse; some adding a
very small quantity thereof; others, a very great one: We, following the
excellent method of the Parisian Pharmacopoeans, add five parts of Oil to two
of Wormwood, and a fourth part of its succe in proportion to the Oil. Some, to
make it more roborative, would have Roses added to its confection: but we think
it better as described; for Wormwood participates of stypticity, especially
the Pontian and vulgar. If any would have it more astrictive, he may, when use
calls for it, mix a little Oil of Myrtle or Roses with it.

It calefies and roborates, Vires.
especially the ventricle: it moves appetite, cocts crude humors, dissipates
flatulency, kills worms, and takes away obstructions from a cold cause.

CHAP. 11. Oleum Anethinum and Chamaemelinum; or, Oil of Dill and Chamomile.
of common Oil lb ij. flowers of Chamomile, or tops of Dill lb j. of the
decoction of the same lb ss. mingle them, and insolate them for seven days,
and boil them till the watery part be evaporated; let this be repeated three or
four times, and afterward kept for use.

The COMMENTARY.
As these two Oils have the same faculties, so the same manner of confection:
some dry the flowers of Chamomile a whole day, in a place not exposed to the
Sun; neither defining the dosis of them, nor of the Oil. Many take an equal
weight of flowers, and of their decoction, and as much Oil as will serve for
their due maceration. Some immerge only one pound of flowers in five pounds of
Oil, and insolate them about half a month in the Dog-dayes; then express them,
and repose the expression.

But if the judication of the good or ill mixtion and preparation be despumed
from the power or imbecility of the Medicament, these Oils will be most
efficacious, if confected after this description.

Oil of Chamomile calefies and resolves moderately, allayes dolours sprung from
a cold cause, and roborates the nerves.

The Oil of Anethum resolves, calefies, discusses flatulency, roborates the
Nerves, takes away laffitude, mitigates the dolours of the articles, relaxates
the spiracles of the veins, and helps in convulsive fits.

The Oil of Rue is and ought to be made after the same manner: Indeed Nic.
Alexandrinus describes a more composititious one, which, besides the tund
leaves of Rue, admits of sweet Marjoram and Cumin. But it is seldom made for
keeping; for that which Mesue gives, will potently enough effect what this
pollicitates. It calefies, attenuates, digests, allayes the dolours of the
Uterus, proceeding from a cold cause, discusses flatulency, and is, according
to Actuarius, accommodate to all dolours, in all parts that require calefaction.

The Oil of sweet Marjoram is either simple, which Mesue confects of its leaves
and succe, or of its decoction and Oil; or else more compound: which, besides
these, admits of Myrtle-leaves, of wild Betony, Southernwood, Water-Mint, and
ligneous Cassia: but this is scarce ever made, the former seldom, save to the
confection of Melilote: and, according to Mesue, the former is made like Oil of
Myrtle; this, like Oil of Melons or of Quinces; that is, the leaves and succe
of sweet Marjoram are confusedly macerated, insolated, expressed, and thrice
changed in Oil. What Sampsuchus is, and if it differs from Marjoram, we have
showed in our Book of Simples.

It calefies and roborates the head, and all kind of Nerves.

Oil of Jasmin should, by the decree of all Medicks, be kept in Pharmacopolies:
for it has most efficacious faculties, both in allaying dolours from a cold
cause, and in digesting and resolving. But it is most commendable for
Belly-aches, which much molest children: it must be confected, as the complete
Oil of Roses, or of VVall-flowers, are made.

CHAP. 12. Oleum Hypericonis simplex; or, The simple Oil of S. John's Wort.
of the tops of S. John's Wort not altogether ripe lb j. common Oil lb ij. of
the decoction of the flowers and leaves of the same lb ss. mingle them, and
insolate them for a whole week; then boil them, and afterward express them,
and repeat this three times.

Oleum Hyperici magis composit. or, The more compound Oil of S. John's Wort. D.
Jac. de Manl.

of the tops of S. John's Wort iij. infuse them for two or three days in x. of
Wine; then boil them to iij. which press out, adding a few more, which
macerate, boil, and strain; to which add, Oil vj. Turpentine iij. Saffron j.
boil them till the wine be consumed; then press out the Ingredients, keep the
Oil.

The COMMENTARY.
There are three sorts of Oils made of S. John's Wort; the most simple and
usual, is made of its leaves and flowers, with Oil; the more compound admits of
Turpentine, Wine, and Saffron, besides these.

The third and most compound, admits of other Oils, Lachrymae, Succes, Roots,
Leaves, and Earthworms. The first is kept in Apothecaries shops; the second in
Chirurgions taberns; and the third sometimes in one, sometimes in another, as
the Medicks design.

The more simple Oil is better, if it be made of the flowers alone macerated
thrice in Oil, insolated, and expressed. Some take the Summities only of the
flowers, with its little leaves and grains; to the confection of this Oil:
which way soever it be made, it is very red, and as it were bloody; of a kind
of middle consistence, betwixt an Oil and an Unguent.

It roborates the Nerves very much, deleates red spots, digests and resolves
humors, mitigates dolours, and recreates the junctures.

That which Manlius describes, seems rather to be some Balsam or Unguent for
agglutinating wounds, then an Oil; yet being eximious, we will not omit it. If
the wine first affunded, be exhaled by the first ebullition, more must be
affunded, that it may be dissipated by the last.

It calefies and siccates, conduces very much to pricks or wounds in the
Nerves: it cures burnings, helps him that has the Sciatica, and is
successfully usurped in all dolours contracted by cold.

The Cyprian or Lygustrian Oil, which the Arabians call Oil of Alcanna, is made
like that of Rue, but it is seldom kept; nor yet the Oil of Enula, of Melilote,
of Carthamus, Citrian Santal, and many more, which Authors describe rather out
of ostentation, then necessity.

CHAP. 13. Oleum de Pomis Mandragorae; or, Oil of Mandrake-Apples.
of the Juice of ripe Mandrake-Apples, Oil of Jasmin, or common Oil, of each
equal parts, boil them till the Juice be evaporated; afterward add again as
much succe, which evaporate as before; and this repeat three times.

The COMMENTARY.
There are two descriptions of this Oil; one tradited by Mesue, which we here
exhibit, as being easier and safer; another by Praepositus; which is too
stupefactive and narcotical: for it admits not only of the succe of Mandrake,
but also of Henbane, Poppy and Hemlock, with Opium also. And seeing benign
Narcoticks, unless they be duly prepared, and rightly exhibited, consopite the
senses, extinguish innate heat; we need not congest so many Medicaments of
contrary qualities into one. Moreover, we do not in the use of Narcotical
Medicaments, so much desire the stupefaction of the senses, as the mitigation
of the inflammation and dolor. If you have not Apples enough in this
confection, you may help out the quantity with the succe of the roots thereof;
for no substitute is so affine to any part of Mandrake, as another part of the
same. The preparation is apparent enough by the description.

It extinguishes all inflammations, allayes dolours, Vires.
stupefies the senses, helps the headache and frenzy; and by way of liniment,
moderates the ardour of the reins.

CHAP. 14. Oleum Myrtinum; or, Oil of Myrtles. D.Mes.
of the leaves of green Myrtle v. Oil of unripe Olives lb j. mingle them, and
insolate them eight days; boil them in a bath, take out the leaves, and let
fresh be immerged, and that three times reiterated; the Oil expressed preserve.

Oleum Myrtillorum; or, Oil of Myrtle-berries.

of Myrtle-berries lb j. Oil of unripe Olives lb ij. ss. of the water of the
decoction of the leaves and berries vij. macerate, and boil them till the
absumption of the water, then eject the berries, and fresh ones added, which
must be macerated and boiled till they grow soft; which must be repeated three
times, if the efficacy of the Oil requires it.

The COMMENTARY.
That is called Oil of Myrtles, which is made of Myrtle leaves macerated and
expressed; that of Myrtles, which is made of Myrtle-berries: both are usual and
eximious. But for want of berries, the other is more frequently kept in shops.
He that has only dry berries, and would make Oil thereof, must immerge them
in odorate wine till they be swelled; then mix them with Oil, and coct and
express them, and repose the expression for use.

They sometimes make the Oil of Myrtles, only of the succe of their leaves and
Oil with a little Ladanum; but the way we have described is more usual, and
better.

Botn of them refrigerate, Vires.
condense, astringe, roborate the brain, nerves and ventricle, retain hairs,
stay them from falling off, cure the gummes and teeth-ach, confirm loose
members, and emend biles or lumps erumping by way of liniment.

CHAP. 15. Oleum Cydoniorum; or, Oil of Quinces. D. Mes.
of the Medulla or flesh of Quinces, and of the Juice of the same, of each lb
ss. Oil of unripe Olives lb j. and iij. let them be insolated in a glass for
fifteen days, afterward boiled to the consumption of the Juice; and after the
Oil is expressed, add thereunto fresh Quinces; and let this be repeated three
or four times, keeping the last expression.

The COMMENTARY.
This Oil, which the Greeks call (...), is made in Autumn, when the Quinces
have attained their perfect magnitude, before maturity. They must be plucked,
not depelled, purged from their Down, then rasped, or deraded, with an
instrument, exasperated with some segments; afterward an equal weight of their
succe, and flesh, not brayed, but deraded, and not expressed, must be taken,
confusedly mixed with the Oil, thrice insolated, cocted and expressed, as in
the prescript. Sylvius says, that the succe of Quinces will so crack and move
while it is cocted in Oil, as that it will excuss all the Oil out of the
vessel; therefore (says he) this Oil should be cocted in a double vessel, lest
by this impression on the Oil, the Quinces faculties evade more imbecile.

It refrigerates, Vires.
astringes, roborates the retentive faculty of the ventricle and intestines,
helps concoction, stays vomiting; and thence conduces to the disease of
Choler, Lientery, and Dysentery, confirming and roborating each loose and
imbecile part.

CHAP. 16. Myrelaeum, seu Oleum Pigmentatum; or, Oil of the Oak of Jerusalem.
the tops of the Oak of Jerusalem, or of the herb so called m. iij. the berries
or seed of the same viij. white wind lb ss. good Oil lb j. ss. mingle them, and
insolate them for seven days; afterward put them in a bath, till the wine be
evaporated, and the expressed Oil keep.

The COMMENTARY.
This Oil should be made about the beginning of Autumn: we call it Myreol, or
Unguent of Pigment, because both the Plants whereof it consists, are called by
the French Pigmentum; as if they should say, Pigment; and by some Ambrosia: for
by the fragrance of its halite, it exhilarates; and by its aromatical lentour,
inviscates the fingers of the contrectants.

When Don Claudius Gonerius, a man of much learning and integrity, of whom we
have often made mention in our Books of Medicinal Matter, had accurately sought
into the nature of these Plants; whose diligence in finding the varieties and
faculties of Simples, has been very great; He was moved, that Medicks should
not celebrate and usurp such eximious Plants, which Nature it self had designed
excellent by their odor, sapour, and pinguetude. But it may be these Plants
are contemptible, because of their frequency: the herb indeed grows most
commonly in cultivated Gardens; but the shrub fruticates spontaneously in all
places about Paris; much whereof, in the beginning of September, is brought
into the City, and bought by women, to conciliate fragrance and suavity to
their vestments.

When I had long explored their faculties, and found them efficacious, I made
this Oil of them, which responds in faculties to many Balsams: for it conduces
much to the Palsy, Vires.
trembling and imbecility of the Nerves; it cures the cold dolours of the
articles, digests watery humors, takes away dolours sprung from phlegm, cocts
and resolves crude tumors, roborates the Brain and Nerves, and with a little
Turpentine, draws dysepulotical Ulcers to sanity.

SECT. II. Of such Oils as may be confected at any time.
IN the former Section of this Book, we have comprehended all Oils more usual
and necessary for Pharmacopolists, which should be made in the Spring, Summer,
or Autumn, by infusion; those seasons suppeditating fresh and eximious
Medicaments in great plenty. Now it rests, that we describe such as Art may
elicite at any time.

CHAP. 1. Oleum Mastichinum; or, Oil of Mastick. D. Mes.
Mastick iij. Oil of Roses xij. generous Wine iiij. boil them till the
consumption of the wine; then strain it, and let the Oil be reposed in a pot
for use.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue gives two descriptions of the Oil of Mastick; one, consisting of the Oil
of Sesamum and Mastick; the other, of Wine, Mastick, and the Oil of Roses,
which is frequently used. Praepositus propounds a third, which all reject.
Myrepsus, besides the former, gives two other, scarce at all used: This
description then that we give out of Avicenna and Mesue, is solely admitted;
for whose confection, the Mastick must be tunded pretty crassly, then cocted
and agitated in a double vessel, together with Oil of Roses and red Wine, till
the Wine be exhaled.

It roborates the brain, Vires.
nerves, ventricle, liver, and articles: it mollifies hard tumors, and allayes
dolours.

CHAP. 2. Oleum Nardinum simplex; or, Simple Oil of Spikenard. D. Mes.
Spikenard iij. Wine and Water, of each ij. ss. Oil of the Pulse Sesamum lb j.
ss. boil them upon a gentle fire, till the water be consumed; stirring of them,
lest they burn

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue is too much occupied in varying the same Oil: for he gives four sorts of
the Oil of Roses, three of Spikenard; amongst which, those only that are first
described, are usurped, the rest seldom or never; as other two which Myrepsus
gives, so sumptuous, that they rather seem Balsams or Unguents, then Oils.

For the confection of this simple Oil of Spikenard, in defect of Oil of
Sesamum, sweet Oil may be substituted, without much error: for Mesue sometimes
prescribes that of Sesamum or sweet Oil at pleasure. The Spikenard must be
minutely cut, and macerated three or four hours in a glass or fictile pot, in
Wine, Water and Oil; then all cocted, till the water and wine be dissipated.
Some macerate it only in water and wine for a whole day; but so its faculties
are worsted: they had better infuse it for a short space in Oil, water and
wine, calefied a little upon the ashes. Now half a pound of Oil seeming too
little for three ounces of Spikenard, much whereof is very light, the Roman
Medicks have added to it a pound more; so that it is lb j. ss.

This Oil is called Benedict, for its eximious virtues: it calefies, Vires.
attenuates, digests, and astringes moderately; and thence conduces much to all
cold flatulent affections of the Brain, Ventricle, Liver, Spleen, and Uterus,
and emends the odor and color of the body.

CHAP. 3. Oleum Croci; or, Oil of Saffron. D. Mes.
of Saffron, Calamus Aromaticus, of each j. Myrrh ss. macerate them five days
in Vinegar; Cordumeni, i. Carui, in ejus loco Cardamomi.
then infuse for a whole day Cardamomes ix. afterward boil them upon a gentle
fire, till the Vinegar be consumed, with lb j. ss. of the best Oil; let the
Colature be put in a fit vessel.

The COMMENTARY.
There is scarce a disease more frequent, then the Neapolitan, or a Medicament
more usual to it, then the Emplaister of Frogs, described by Jo. Vigonius; for
there is not an Oppidane Barber so stupid, but he has made both trial and gain
of this Medicament: to whose confection, Oil of Saffron acceding, it should be
kept in Pharmacopolies; otherwise, the Medicament will be ill confected: yet I
think Mesue invented it not for that end; for it is credible, he never heard of
the Venereous Pox, else he would not have been silent in that point: but he
made it to roborate the Uterus and Nerves, allay their dolours, mollify and
discuss hardness, and conciliate color. What Cordumeni is, we have showed in
our Book of Simples.

CHAP. 4. Oleum de Capparibus; or, Oil of Capers.
of the bark of the roots of Capers j. the middle bark of Tamarisk,
Tamarisk-leaves, the seeds of white Willow, Spleen-wort, Cypress-root, of each
ij. Rue j. Vinegar, generous White Wind, of each ij. mature Oil lb j. boil
them, till the Vinegar and the Wine be consumed, and let percolated Oil be
reposed idoneously for future use.

The COMMENTARY.
The invention of this Oil is attributed to the Neotericks: for none of the
Ancients, that I know of, speak of it. Its Author is uncertain; but whoever he
was, he described this Oil, which is eximiously Medicinal, both legitimately
and methodically: Which is therefore always almost made after the description
we have exhibited; save by Brassavolus, who studying novelties, changed it:
who, I think, is one of them that had rather be seen then estimated.

But that it may be duly confected, the roots of Cypress must first be minutely
incided, then brayed with the barks of Capers and Tamarisks; the other simples
also, as Tamarisks, Scolopendrium, or Ceterach and Rue, must be tunded
together; only the seed of Agnus Castus apart; then all must be mixed together,
macerated fifteen days in Wine, Vinegar, and Oil; then cocted in a double
vessel, till the wine and vinegar be dissipated; and then the Oil strained and
kept.

It much helps the affections of the Spleen, Vires.
for it cures its hardness, swelling, obstructions, and dolours: it opens the
spiracles and pores of the skin, resolves humors, and discusses flatulency.

CHAP. 5. Oleum ex Euphorbio; or, Oil of Euphorbium. D. Mes.
Euphorbium ss. Oil of Wall-flowers, odoriferous Wine, of each v. boil them
together, till the consumption of the wine.

The COMMENTARY.
As water may by Art be made more cold, or more hot; so may Oil, according to
Galen, which may be made very refrigerative, if Sedum or Sempervive be
macerated therein; refrigerative and stupefactive, if Mandrake; and hot, if
Pepper or Euphorbium be macerated in it. From all which legitimately adhibited,
Oils may be by impression elicited, most accommodate for Medicinal uses: for
though Euphorbium be exceeding hot and sharp, yet Galen commends it for many
uses; as mixed with wax, for the affections of the Hips; melted with Oil, to
the Hemicrany from a cold cause: from the lection whereof, Mesue being made
more learned and bold, brought this Oil, which he invented, amongst those other
he describes; adding another out of Avicenna, whereunto he adjects some few
things; but that is of no use, obselete: but for the confection of the former,
white and new Euphorbium should be selected; in defect whereof, by Galens
advice, twice as much old must be usurped: it must be levigated into small
powder, and a little wine, or Oil of Keyri superfused, lest it should offend
the nose and brain of the tunder; when it is brayed, it must be mixed with Oil
of wine, and moved always with a rudicle, then cocted slowly, till all the
wine be exhaled, and then the distrained Oil must be reposed.

It much helps the cold affections of the brain and nerves, Vires.
the Cephalalgie, Hemicrany, and Lethargy, being immitted up the nostrils: it
also helps the cold dolours of the junctures, liver and spleen.

CHAP. 6. Oleum Moschellinum; or, A sweet smelling Oil.
of Nutmegs number. ij. Mosch ss. Indian leaf, Spikenard, Costus, Mastick, of each
vj. Storax, Xylo-Cassia.
Cassia-Lignea, Myrrh, Saffron, Cloves, Cubebs, Bdellium, of each ij. pure Oil
lb iij. generous Wine iij. let them be bruised that are to be bruised, and
mingled together, boiling of them till the Wine be consumed: let the strained
Oil be preserved for use.

The COMMENTARY.
Most dissent about the Author, Description, Name of this Oil, and the dosis of
its simples: for all that have spoken of it, either adding or detracting
something, have obscured its origin, and changed its antique description;
which Joubertus finding shamefully depraved, castigated, and reduced to a
better form; which here we have exhibited, under the name of Musk-Oyl: for it
having two bases, both eximious, and yet affine in faculty, it may be
denominated from either: for whether we call it Muscellinum, from Musk, or
Moscatellinum, from Nutmeg, it may legitimately bear the name. But it is
foolishly, by some, called Oil of Balanus, which is an odorate simple, as
though it were elicited out of the brayed Unguentary Acorn.

That it may be duly made, all its ingredients must be brayed apart, and put
together into Oil and Wine, to be there macerated in an obturated vessel, upon
hot ashes, for a day or two, except Storax and Musk; then they must be all
cocted in a double vessel, till the wine be evaperated; then the Oil must be
percolated, and the pulverated Storax added to the hot colature; which must be
again servefied on a slow fire, and at length the Musk added, and the mixture
kept. Some add ij. of Musk; others iij. which, if it please rich men, let them
take it; but poor men may not compass it.

Alexandrinus assumes Oleum Pumicum, which some interpret pure Oil, others
Carthaginean Oil: we, with Joubertus, take sweet and sincere Oil; for water,
wine; for Neregil, that is, the Indian Nut, Nutmegs: for Costum, if it may not
be had, Angelica's root; for Xylo-Cassia, crass Cinnamon; for Carpobalsamum,
Cubebs, or the seed of Lentisks, or Turpentine-tree: the rest are frequent.

It is good for all corporal frigidity, Vires.
especially for the cold of the ventricle, which it roborates: it calefies and
helps concoction; it cures Strangury, Cholick, and almost all nervous
affections.

SECT. III. Of such Oils as are confected of whole Animals, or of their parts.
MEdicinary Oils are neither all, nor always elicited out of Plants, but
confected of whole or parts of Animals, by infusion or expression: for seeing
all living Creatures were made for Man's use; some he has for Meat, others for
Clothing; some for Service, and others for Medicine: for Sheep nourish him, the
Silk-fly clothes him, the Horse works for him, and Worms cure him. But more
serve for man's Medicament, then his Aliment; whose Medicinal faculties are
diversely extracted, prepared, and exhibited by perite Medicks, whereof they
most frequently confect Medicinal Oils: As,

CHAP. 1. Oleum Lumbricorum; or, Oil of Earthworms.
Earthworms washed in White Wind, of Red-wine, and generous Wine, of each lb
ss. clear and old Oil lb ij. boil them till the absumption of the Wines; let
the percolated Oil be kept for use.

The COMMENTARY.
Those descriptions which are founded on the testimony of no famous man, never
pass through many hands without some maims, seeing any may freely change them,
without fear of rebuke. Yet this Oil, though of an uncertain Author, is alike
described of all; wherein there is no difference, but only in the dosis of
wine and worms, which are in some exemplars equal, in others not: Some describe
less wine then will suffice for the coction of the worms; others, so much as
will require longer coction. We have given a a legitimate proportion of each
to other. For its preparation, the Earthworms must be often washed in change
of waters, and then in white wind, where they may subside an hour; the lotion
being finished, and the wine abjected, the worms must be put into a double
vessel, the Oil with red or white wine affunded, and all cocted, till the wine
be evaporated; then may the Oil, trajected through a Canvas strainer, be
reposed for use. Some bray the worms, mix them with Oil in form of an Unguent:
but such are of rare use.

It allayes the dolours of the articles, Vires.
roborates the imbecility of the nerves from a cold cause, and recreates all
the nerves by way of liniment.

CHAP. 2. Oleum de Scorpionibus simp. or, Simple Oil of Scorpions. D. Mes.
of Scorpions nu. xx. or more or less, according to their magnitude, Oil of
bitter Almonds lb ij. macerate them in a glass with a narrow mouth well
stopped, for thirty days, in the heat of the Sun: and then let the Oil be
strained, and kept.

Oleum de Scorpionibus comp. or, Compound Oil of Scorpions. D. Mes.

of the roots of round Birthwort, Gentian, and Cypress of the bark of the roots
of Capers, of each j. Oil of bitter Almonds lb j. ss. insolate them together in
a vessel well covered for twenty days; then add Scorpions from ten to fifteen,
according to their bigness, which insolate for a month; afterward let it be
strained, and kept.

The COMMENTARY.
Nature takes man for her Son, whom she nourishes, defends, and liberates from
diseases; which she abigates either by the opposition of contraries, or by the
similarity or dissimilarity of Alexiterials. Thus the Theriack, which is in a
mean betwixt the nature of man and of poison, cures malign, contagious, and
pestilent diseases. Thus Scorpions, always to us offensive, do not only cure
the wounds themselves inflicted, but also other venenate diseases, by evoking
the malign quality; out of which, by infusion and expression, Mesue makes a
simple Oil, consisting only of Scorpions and bitter Almonds, and another more
composititious, besides these admitting of Cypress, Aristolochy, Gentian, and
the bark of the root of Capers. If any one, following Manardus his advice, mix
Scorpions with more Antidotes, it shall be work worth his labor; for it is of
eximious virtue against all poison and pestilence. I have omitted the
description of such more composititious Alexipharmacal Oils, because the
frequent description of the same Medicament, would make a man nauseate it.
Mesue took the compound Oil we have transcribed from Rhasis; which should
rather be confected then the simple, because more Medicinal and efficacious:
for whose confection, the root of Cypress, as also Aristolochy, Gentian, and
the root of Capers, must be minutely incided and contunded, then macerated in
Oil, insolated and acted as the prescript shows. Sylvius understands by one
Kissed of oil, one Sextary; but we have put one pound and a half for a more
certain dosis.

By way of liniment, it helps venenate diseases, Vires.
breaks the stones of the Reins and Bladder, diduces the passages, mitigates
dolours, and expels sand; which it does more effectually, if the affected be
therewith anointed after he comes out of a Bath. Both of these Oils have like
faculties, but the compound hotter and better.

CHAP. 3. Oleum de Castorio; or, Oil of Beavers stones.
of Beavers stones cleansed from their membranes j. white wind iij. Oil lb j.
let all be boiled together to the exhalation of the wine; afterward strained,
and kept.

The COMMENTARY.
Praepositus is not unjustly accused of latrociny; for he stole the description
of the Ancients, not detecting their Authors, that he might draw to himself
their glory: as it appears by that mole of Medicaments which he has
transcribed; amongst which, if there be any of his own invention, they are not
like the genuine offspring of a perite Medick, or dexterous Apothecary: which
thing, his description of the Oil of Beavers stones sufficiently evinces; for
whose confection, he prescribes j. of Beavers stone, to be decocted in lb j. of
Oil, till the third be dissipated, without the intervent of any wine, water, or
fit decoction; which the youngest Apprentice would find to be imprudence: for
who knows not, that Oil will endure a whole days coction without sensible
jacture, unless it burn? such things therefore as are cocted in Oil, mollify
not, but become hard. This Oil may indeed be made without any liquor, if it be
only macerated, insolated, and left; for it was of old kept without
percolation. Fernelius adjects j. of Aqua-vitae; but this so small a portion
cannot long endure fire. Manlius gives another more composititious description;
which being harder to make, and more sumptuous, is seldom used: we shall
therefore hold to Praepositus his description, with some castigation, which
shall effect as much as that of Manlius's pollicitates.

For it conduces to trembling, Vires.
to the dolours of the nerves and articles, to convulsious Fits, and Palsy.

Mesue makes an Oil of whole black Vipers, cocted on a slow fire in an earthen
vessel well leaded, with a narrow orifice, till their flesh be dissolved, for
the Itch, Tetters, and other cutaneous vices.

Fallopius assumes two Vipers of any color, cuts them in pieces, immerges them
in Oil, exposes them to the Sun about the canicular days, in a vessel with a
strait orifice; afterward expresses and keeps them: which expression he
prescribes as most conducible in curing the Ulcers of the French Pox.

CHAP. 4. Oleum Vulpinum; or, Oil of Foxes.
a Fox at his full growth, and fat, his intrails taken out, and his skin pulled
off, and cut into small pieces; of common Salt iij. tops of Dill, Thyme,
Germander, of each m. j. boil them together in an equal quantity of water and
white wind, till the flesh be separated from the bones; and to lb ij. of the
Colature, add lb iiij. of Oil, Sage, Rosemary, of each m. j. boil them
together, till the water be consumed; then let the Oil be strained, and kept.

The COMMENTARY.
It is not enough that we select the best simples, but also rightly prepare,
rationally describe, duly mix, and exactly unite them into compounds, that no
useful part thereof be lost. But how ill does the old description of Foxes Oil
accord with these Laws, let its form speak: for Mesue commands, that a Fox
should be exenterated, and then cocted integrally, both body, skin, hairs, feet
and all, in Fountain and Seawater, Oil and Salt, till the members be
dissolved; and a little Hyssop and Anise injected into the coction, and some
more water affunded; whereas there was a pound of each sort before. And thus
you should have a pot of hairs, bones, flesh, and plants, cocted to putretude,
whose expressed pinguetude is Mesue's Foxes Oil. Paulus would have a Fox
exenterated, and yet cocted alive, till his bones were separated: but I cannot
conjecture, how an eviscerated Fox should be cocted alive. Rondeletius would
have one boiled with his skin and guts, and only the excrements of the belly
abjected: but it is past my skill, to eject the recrements, and leave the
intestines in the carcass. His Colleague Joubertus, would rather have the skin
abjected, then the bowels, who would have the intrail washed, and elixated with
the flesh. We reject both skin, tail, and intrails, as useless; afterward, we
cut the members and trunk, and coct them in wine and falt, with nerval and
digestive herbs. We add to the colature, Oil, Sage, and Rosemary, and so coct
it again, till the aqueous and vinous humidity be dissipated.

The Oil thus made is very eximious, Vires.
and most efficacious in what Mesue promises: for it potently digests and
resolves, roborates the nerves, defends them from cold injuries, and cures the
difeases of the articles.

CHAP. 5. Oleum Formicarum; or, Ants Oil.
of Ants with wings ij. mature Oil lb ss. macerate them for the space of forty
days in a vessel well covered, exposing it to the heat of the Sun; afterward
let the Oil be expressed, and kept.

The COMMENTARY.
This Oil is seldom made, being only expetible for calefying the colder
genitals, and exciting venery: yet in that it may be confected with ease and
small cost, and desired by such as are of a cold constitution, I would not have
our Shop quite destitute of it.

SECT. IV. Of Oils educed by Expression.
THere are four kinds of Oils; the first absolutely and properly so called,
which is educed from mature Olives; the second not so properly so called, which
consists of the said Oil, wherein some parts of Animals have been infused and
insolated, or cocted; the third is cognominated from the adjunct whereof it is
made, as Oil of Almonds, the Oil of Laurel-berries; the fourth is proper to
Alchymists, which is elicited by ascent. The extraction of the first being
sufficiently notorious, but withal operous, is committed to Rusticks; of the
second, we have treated at large in the former Sections. It now remains, that
we treat of the rest: and first, of such as are extracted from oleaginous seeds
brayed and expressed; and first of the Oil of sweet Almonds.

CHAP. 1. Oleum Amygdalarum dulcium; or, The Oil of sweet Almonds.
of sweet Almonds, dry, not rancid, blanched from their cortex, as many as you
please; beat them in a stone-Morter very small, involve them in a bag, and with
a press, extract the Oil.

The COMMENTARY.
Almonds are either sweet or bitter: Oil is expressed out of both; sometimes
brayed and expressed with, sometimes without their membranous Pill; sometimes
with, and sometimes without the adjument of fire or external heat: That which
is elicited without fire, is best. The Pharmacopolists therefore are to blame,
that had rather be idle, then occupied in preparing Simples duly. Whence it is
no wonder, that the diseased complain of the rancour, acrimony, and insuavity
of the Oil of Almonds. Now that it may be rightly confected, the Almonds to be
assumed, must be new and dry, purged from both their skins, that the Oil may be
more sincere and pure; they must be long tunded in a stone-Morter, that their
oleous internal humidity may come out; they must be put in a bag of Horse-hair,
and then excepted in a Torcular or common Press, such as Stationers use, when
they cut their Books that are bound.

It should be expressed by little and little, that it may be more pure,
pellucid, and sweet: for that which is hastily extracted, is turbid and
foeculent. It will flow more readily, if the Almonds before expression be
calefied by the fire or Sun; for so its oleaginous humidity is attenuated,
melted, and made more fluxile: it erupts more easily, readily, and copiously;
yea, by so much more readily, by how much the Almonds are hotter, if they be
not burnt: but that which should be introsumed at the mouth, should be elicited
without fire.

Almonds are purged two ways: First, they must be macerated long in warm
water, and then compressed with ones fingers, that the cortex may cleft:
Secondly, they may be put in some Fryingpan, with a small quantity of flower,
and agitated with ones hand over a slow fire, till the Involucrum disrupt,
which will afterward come easily off by rubbing; which second way is better
then the first: for macerated Almonds, unless they be well dried before their
triture, will effund aqueous Oil. One pound of Almonds will emit six ounces of
Oil; and a brayed Magma, irrigated with water, and calefied upon the ashes,
till the water be dissipated, and then pressed, will emit as much: but this
will be more foeculent, and fit only for Liniments, Unguents, and External
Medicaments.

Oil of Almonds is commended to many uses: Vires.
for it conduces to the tabid and consumed, refecting the macilent body, with
humid, viscid, fat, and aereous aliment: it leniates the asperity of the
throat, of the lungs, and other parts; if injected, it allayes the heat of the
Uterus, and of the Bladder; if it be applied as an Unguent, is perduces rough
places to equality, erugates the skin, mollifies hard lumps, and emends the
siccity of all the Junctures, and other parts.

CHAP. 2. Oleum Amagdalarum amarum; or, The Oil of bitter Almonds.
THe Oil of bitter Almonds is educed also by expression, though Alexandrinus
makes it by infusion: for he macerates two pounds of purged brayed Almonds
three days in five pounds of Oil, and afterward cocts them to the half, and
expresses the Oil. But neither the Oil, nor the manner of its confection, is
good: For Alexandrinus erres, in thinking that Oil can be cocted to the half;
for it will rather burn, then dissipate like water. Besides, the Oil thus drawn
by infusion, is not half of it Oil of Almonds; it is not so ungrateful, nor yet
so eximious as by expression. It is therefore better to draw pure and sincere
bitter Oil out of bitter Almonds, by triture and expression: which Oil is much
commended; for it solves obstructions, dissipates flatulency, allayes the
dolours of the nerves, mollifies hardness, deleates the Pimples of the face,
and cures the tinkling of the ears.

For it calefies, incides, digests, and deterges potently: Vires.
wherefore it helps such as have the Stone, Strangury, breathe difficultly, and
are Splenatick: it cures many vices of the skin, kills worms; being assumed, it
helps the coldness of the Uterus; being applied, it cures difficulty of
breathing, and hardness and dolor in the nerves from a cold cause.

The Oil of Peach-stones is educed after the same manner; which having the same
or like faculties, is not made.

CHAP. 3. Oleum Nucum; or, Oil of Nuts.
SUch things as are only Medicinal, and serve only to prevent or cure
diseases, should be tractated by Pharmacopolists alone: but such things as
besides these, are accommodated to esure, or other uses, are seldom by
Apothecaries, but frequently by perite Rusticks, confected in great quantity.
Thus Wine is left to Vintners, and Bread to Bakers: Thus also common Oil, Oil
of Walnuts, and Sesamum, are left to servants to express, who used in
Hand-mills or fit Presses, to grind seeds, and express plenty of Oil for
nutriment to bodies, or to lamps, for the custody of sanity, or cure of
diseases. These Oils therefore are seldom made in Pharmacopolies. But because
the Oil extracted from Walnuts by Rusticks, is insuave and turbid, it were
better that Apothecaries would extract that which they use; for so it would be
more limpid, suave, and efficacious.

It is of much use: for it resolves crass humors, Vires.
dissipates tumors, cures the Cholick, whether from flatulency, or cold
humors: by its digestive and siccative faculty, it cures the punctures and
fores of the nerves. It heals burnings by a special propriety; it is endued
with the same virtue that Oil of Acorus has; for by the tenuity of its
substance, its resolvative faculty and heat, it resolves flatulent matter. He
then that has Oil of Walnuts, needs not Oil of Acorus.

If it be extracted from new and tender Walnuts, Vires.
it will hinder the eruption of Pimples, if childrens faces be anointed
therewith.

CHAP. 4. Some Oils that are seldom made; and their faculties.
AS all men follow not one Law and Rule in Life; so neither are all taken with
one course of Medicaments: for as the old Verse has it; Utitur ingenio patria
quaeque suo: Some admit of a Medicament, others reject it; some approve of none
but new inventions, others of none but old ones: and though both this and that
troop be my friends, yet Reason is my nearest friend, which I have in writing
and acting made my Rule. I adore Mesue in most things; yet in some I leave him
to those he wrote to, leaving some of his Medicaments to such as he left them
to, as appears by the Catalogue of Medicaments contained in this our Shop. He
describes some Oils which are not used; yet he will not omit them, because
their faculties are above contempt: whereof we shall treat in brief.

Mesue says, that the Oil of Filberds allayes the dolours of the nerves and
articles: it is made as the Oil of Almonds. A Filberd is a small Nut, in Greek
(...), sometimes called the Pontian or Praenestine Nut, from the places where
the Plant grows copiously, whose oleous humidity is adonynous, discusses
humors, and is thence fit for the said affections.

The Oil of Apricot-stones mitigates the dolor of the fundament, and the
Haemorrhoids, and digests the tumors of those parts, and Ulcers. It is made
after the same manner with the former. These stones are taken out of some
Apples, which from the place where they are, are called Armeniacks; from their
color, Golden Apples; and from their speedy maturity, Praecocks: Their
carnosity is very sapid and sweet, but their kernels sharp, bitter, and
ungrateful.

The Oil of Peaches kills worms, removes obstructions, allayes the dolours of
the ears, benefits the tumid and dolourous Haemorrhoids. Furthermore, it
calefies, attenuates, resolves, and effects the same with Oil of bitter
Almonds: for the stones of Peaches, whereof it is made, are bitter,
calefactive, and diaphoretical.

The Oil of Kerva or great Spurge discusses crass flatulency, attenuates viscid
phlegm, cures the dolours of the belly and intestines, proceeding from that
humor, and helps the Hydroptical, whether it be assumed or applied. Avicenna
recenseates more of its utilities; but it is very seldom made.

The Oil of wild Saffron, incides and deterges, thence it cures the Jaundice,
the dolor of the breast, lungs and ventricle, from a cold cause. But this is
not often made.

The Oil of Pistack-Nuts, and Pine-Apples, leniates the asperity of the throat,
mitigates the dolor of the breast, cures the Cough, fattens the macilent and
tabid, and augments Sperm: but they are better for esure.

And that I may in brief speak of many things, Oils may at any time be
confected of Cherry-stones, Unguentary Acorn, Orange, and Lemmon-seeds, and the
four cold seeds, and the like, which will have the same faculties that their
fruits, seeds and stones, whereof they are confected, have.

CHAP. 5. Oleum de nuce Moschata; or, The Oil of Nutmeg.
THe Oil of Nutmeg is stomachical, aromatical, and sweet; for it roborates the
weak stomach, cherishes its faint heat, moves appetite, helps coction, cocts
cold humors, resolves hot ones, dissipates flatulency: it is made of Nutmegs
brayed, calefied, and pressed; which emit Oil, which at first is liquid, and
concretes afterward into the solidity of an Unguent.

But because Nutmegs are very precious, and their Oil is better new then old;
it should be confected but in small quantity, and as exigence calls for it,
iterated. This simple Oil differs much from that Moschatelline Oil, confected
of many simples by maceration, which has Musk and Nutmeg for its Basis.

CHAP. 6. Oleum Ovorum; or, Oil of Eggs.
THe Oil of Eggs is made of their Yolks, indurated by coction, which broken in
ones hands, are fried in a Drying Pan, continually moved with a spoon, or the
like, till they exude some pinguetude; which, while they are hot, must be
involved in a Canvas bag, and committed to the press, that their Oil may be
expressed and kept.

There may also an Oil be extracted from these, by coction, triture, and
expression, without frixion, like that of Almonds, and so the Oil will be more
pure, sweet, and less ruddy; but in less quantity, and not so efficacious in
deleating cutaneous vices, whereunto it is prescribed, about twenty or thirty
new Eggs should be taken, their Whites separated from their Yolks, which by
pressure will emit Oil.

It takes away the foedity of the skin, deleates scars, or at least lessens
them, cures burnings and Tetters, helps all cutaneous affections, and very much
benefits the malign Ulcers of the feet, fundament, and hands.

CHAP. 7. Oleum Laurinum; or, Oil of Bays.
FOr the confection of this Oil, new and mature Laurel-berries must be
selected, brayed in a Mortar, cocted in a Kettle without water, and expressed
out of a hollow, not plain Press, into a subdititious vessel, wherein the Oil
that swims above the water, may be collected. The mass may be again brayed, and
moistened with water, and pressed in a hollow Torcular, that more oleous
fatness may be elicited.

Dioscorides confects it a little otherwise; for he elixates the mature berries
in water, which exude their fatness through their skins, which he subacts with
his hands, and puts in a shell: but the former way is more usual; yet
Apothecaries make it not, but buy it thus ready made, of such, as congesting a
great quantity of berries together, make it their work to elicite Oil. Some
bray the fresh and mature berries without other mistion, and express their Oil
out of them in a Torcular.

Oils may be thus extracted out of the berries of Lentisks, Turpentine-trees,
Ivy, Junipers, and the like, which bear odorate berries.

The Oil of Laurel-berries is calefactive, mollitive, apertive, and discussive:
and hence it cures all cold distempers, whether simple, or mixed with phlegm
and flatulency; as also the cholical dolor arising hence, if it be injected
into the intestines with some convenient decoction: it presently cures all cold
affections of the brain, nerves, articles, and loins: it takes away lassitude,
opens the spiracles of the veins, cures the Palsy and Trembling, if the
Backbone be anointed therewith.

CHAP. 8. Oleum Balfami; or, The Oil of Balm.
THe next of this kind is Oil of Balm, which flows from a peregrine Tree,
which is low of stature, and not elegant; of a subcineritious color, with a
luteous flower, like Jasmins; its leaves fall off about the end of Autumn, and
grow again in Spring. It fruticates copiously in the Arabian, Egyptian, and
the Babylonish tract, it is scarcely cicurable in colder Regions. They
sometimes cut off its tender succles, whereunto they annex Canes oblited with
wax, that their fat succe may flow into them: Sometimes they vulnerate its
crasser boughs; out of which wounds, that precious Lachryma which is so much
celebrated, distills.

Some drops of this Oil exhibited on a jejune stomach, help difficulty of
breathing, take away the obstructions of the Liver, move fluours, allay
stomachical dolours, help the tabid and consumed, and excite appetite.

CHAP. 9. Liquid Amber.
LIquid Amber is a certain oleous Rosine, flowing from the incisures of a
Praegrand and Venust tree, of a vast magnitude, whose leaves are hederaceous,
cortex, crass and cineritious; which being vulnerated, emits this Oil, called
from its suaveolence, Liquid Amber, or Oil of Amber.

The Trees from which it flows, are so fragrant, that they send a sweet odor
from the place where they grow, into vicine Regions. This Liquor is of much use
in Medicine; for it calefies, roborates, resolves, mollifies all tumors,
removes obstructions, moves fluors, cures the suffocation of the Uterus, and
other diseases of women.

CHAP. 10. Petreolaeum; or, Oil of Peter.
PEtreol is the work and effect of Natures hand, not of the Apothecaries; for
he only collects it, or buys, keeps and uses it when collected: for Nature
confects it in the bowels of the Earth, and it eructates out of the clefts of
Rocks; whence it is called Petreol, or Rock-Oyl.

It is to be had in those Regions where Bitumen is, whereunto it is related:
for Bitumen is either dense or liquid; the dense, is as it were the fatness of
the earth, which swims upon the water, and by agitation of the winds, is cast
upon the shore, and there concretes, and becomes tenacious and dense. The
legitimate Bitumen is Judaical, by some called, Bitumen of Sodom, because it is
found on the banks of Sodom. It is very rare in Europe. The liquid, which the
Greeks call Naphta, is very white of color, and rapacious of fire; insomuch,
that fire will leap to it from distance, as also to all dense Bitumen. Besides
this Naphta, there is another sort yet more fluxile, like Oil, which distills
from Rocks and Stones; as that which abounds in the Mutinian fields on the
Mount Gibion.

There is also a fossile and terrene Bitumen, and that of two sorts; the one
too hard and frangible, which they commonly call Stonecoal; the other very
dense, and intensely black with nitre, called Gagates: of which we have treated
in our Book of Simples. Some, and that upon good grounds, affirm, that Amber is
a kind of hard Bitumen.

Bitumen then is of large comprehension: to whose family, many refer
Pissaphaltus and Mumy. However, Pissaphaltos is a kind of mixture made of
Pitch and Asphaltos, or dense Bitumen, which is used in maritimous towns, to
Pitch Ships withal. The Arabians call Pissaphaltus, Mumy, which in their
Language denotes Balm: in stead whereof, the Syrians and Arabians of meaner
fortune, used Pissaphaltos, in embalming their dead carcases. And thus they
take Pissaphaltus for Balm, and Balm for Mumy, which agree not so much as in
name: for natural Balsam or Balm, is Opobalsamum; artificial, consists of many
Aromata's, used in conditing Kings bodies. Pissaphaltos, is a certain mixture
of Pitch and Asphaltos: Mumy is a thing arising from one or both of them, and
the putretude of a carcass: whose illicite use now to prosecute and disprove,
appertains not to our purpose; whereunto, I shall now return. Petreol is not to
be rejected by Apothecaries; for its faculties are of much use: Vires.
It calefies, siccates, by the tenuity of its substance opens, penetrates,
digests, resolves all excrementitious matter, helps many diseases of the brain
and nerves, as the Epilepsie, Lethargy, and Palsy.

SECT. V. Of Oils extracted by Distillation: and first of such as are elicited
by descent.
BEsides these ways of confecting Oils, Mesue subjoyns many more; all which,
he says, are made by Resolution. Education by descent and ascent, is a
Chemical term; of whose Oils, opportune occasion now gives leave to treat,
Mesue also leading the way. Of which I shall only subjoyn a few words, both
because laborious work, long time, and great cost, are necessarily requisite to
this education of Oils; and also because they are now adays made by some base,
imperite, and ignorant Circulators, who defraud the Commonalty with their vain
promises, and spend their time in seeking secret Fopperies, and confecting
Magisterial Bables. I do not now speak of men of approved skill, learning, and
knowledge; who, given to the study of abstruser Sciences, seek the more secret
Closets of Nature, and find the more miraculous virtues of Creatures: who make
Medicaments after several manners, change them into several forms, and by
diverse preparations, give them diverse qualities, sejoyning what is useless, and
retaining what is expetible; and so coacting them, that in small quantity they
have much virtue. But such Medicaments should not be exhibited, but by the
perite; for else they are perilous, and precipitate men into open danger: Yet
skilful Medicks and Apothecaries following Mesue their Chieftain, may after a
Chemical manner educe certain Oils by distillation; and that either by descent,
whereunto descension by transudation or by draining, is referred; or else by
ascent, whereunto distillation by Inclination is also referred.

Education of Oil by descent, is, when the elicited humor distills downwards,
without any elevation, into a subdititious vessel, which has no way for
ascent; the liquefied humor, which is elicited in form of a vapor, being
coacted, and then falling downwards. Now Oils are elicited by descent, not
only out of such things as are aqueous, but out of Woods, Rosines, and such
things as are destroyed by the ascending calour. And the Oils thus educed being
crass and black, are of an ungrateful odor and sapour, and only usurpable to
external affections: Yet if they can be introsumed at the mouth, they promise
eximious effects. Many may be made after the example of one or two.

CHAP. I. Oleum Guaiaci; or, The Oil of Guaiacum.
THe Guaiacum must be brayed, put in a Cucurbite of glass or earth, with a
strait orifice, which must be obduced with a plate of Tin full of holes, and
thrust into the more patent orifice of another Cucurbite, and both well joined
and circumlited with tenacious argil, paste or clay; then must the empty vessel
be dimitted into a hole, and buried in the earth, so that the earth may touch
the middle of the Cucurbite, which contains the wood of Guaiacum; and then a
fire must be accended all about it, and Oil will distill from the superior into
the inferior.

Thus are the Oils of Juniper, Ivy, Ash, and many more woods, berries and
rosines, educed.

This Oil of Guaiacum is truly alexiterial to the French Pox: Vires.
for a few drops thereof taken in a morning on a jejune stomach, with water, or
some fit decoction, deleate the venereous Pustuls, allay the night-tormenting
dolours, accelerate the Ulcers sanity, and extinguish the malignant quality of
this affection.

CHAP. 2. Oleum Tamarisci; or, Oil of Tamarisks.
A Boccia must be filled with the tunded wood and barks of Tamarisks, its
orifice must be occluded with a foraminous plate, and it self so placed in the
superior part of the furnace, that its belly looking upwards, may be with clay
well conjoined to the top of the furnace; and its orifice tending downwards,
and trajecting it self through the upper room of the furnace, may be committed
to the orifice of the inferior Boccia, that so Boccia may be set against
Boccia; then the inferior one must be settled on a Trivet, that it may stand
immovable; the fire must be built, and accended about the superior Boccia,
that the matter within it may calefie, and exude its Oil into the inferior,
which is recipient.

This way is like the former; only the inferior Boccia is not buried in the
earth, but placed on an Iron; and the superior is as it were suspended, its
orifice protending it self below the chamber of the furnace, and its belly
looking up; out of which, the Oil liquefied by the fire, wherewith it is
circumcinged, delabes into the inferior receptacle. Wekerus, in the third Book
of his General Antidotary, gives an effigies hereof; after which, others may be
formed.

The Oil of Tamarisks conduces much to Splenatick affections; Vires.
for it respects and roborates that part by a special propriety; it prepares
melancholical humors for ejection; it mitigates its quality, it opens,
attenuates, dissolves, removes obstructions, and discusses flatulency.

Many more may be educed thus; as Oil of Junipers, which is most easily
affected after the sequel mode.

CHAP. 3. Oleum Juniperi; or, Oil of Juniper.
AN idoneous quantity of Juniper Berries must be put into a figuline vessel,
with a foraminous bottom; whereunto, the orifice of another vessel must be
adjoined, and glewed with tenacious argil, or glutinous paste: they must be so
disposed, that the empty one may be put in some hole, and covered with earth;
the other, which contains the Juniper, must be above the earth: which when the
fire is accended all about it, will demit its oleaginous pinguetude into the
pot underneath it.

Oil may by this Art be deduced out of the wood of Juniper, as also out of
Agats stone; and some Rosines.

Oil of Juniper is much commended for cutaneous affections: Vires.
it cures the Morpheous Tetter, and other more profound vices: it conduces also
to the diseases of the reins: it helps the colder Uterus, and makes it more
prompt for conception.

As it is laborious, so were it superfluous to enumerate more Oils educed after
the like manner: We shall therefore now subjoyn some few, which are elicited by
transudation or deliquium in a moist place.

CHAP. 4. Oleum Tartari; or, Oil of Tartar.
THe Tartar must be put in a fictile pot, and calcinated in a furnace till it
be white; then it must be brayed; then it must be imposed in Hippocrates his
Sleeve, or some such Pyramidal receptacle, and suspended in a moist place; and
an idoneous vessel set under it, to receive the liquor that will distillatively
delabe.

Tartar is some Wine-dregs, adhering to the sides of the Hogshead; which, in
generous wine, whether it be white or red, is always good: out of which, a
certain Oil, or rather salsugineous liquor, is educed, put in a fit vessel, and
burned till it be white; which being refrigefied, and brayed, is received into
a Hempenbag, or linen cloth, and suspended three or four days in the moist air
in a Wine-cellar: for thus the contained matter tabefying, emits a certain
liquor or sudour into the subdititious receptacle. This Tartar is often called
Petra Vini.

Some macerate their Tartar in Vinegar, then coct and burn it under hot ashes,
till it be black; then they bray it, and keep it in a declining vessel for
eight or more days, till it be resolved into an aqueous Oil: but it is better
to calcinate the Tartar till it be white, repose it in a bag, and suspend it in
a moist place, till its liquor or Oil exude into the subjected vessel.

This Oil erugates the skin, cures the scab, Vires.
and the running Ulcers of the head: it conduces also to the cure of the
Pustuls of the French disease; it solves obstructions, moves fluors, and opens
the passages, if it be desumed in water, or some fit decoction.

This same Tartareous liquor may also be extracted by ascent: of which by and
by.

CHAP. 5. Oleum Myrrhae; or, Oil of Myrrh.
LEt some new Eggs be cocted till they be hard, then cut in the middle, either
long way or broad way; let the Yolks be taken out, the cavities be filled with
fat, and brayed Myrrh; then let the incided parts of the Whites be conjoined,
and a little constringed with a thread; then let them be collocated upon a
foraminous plate betwixt two Platters, and let these be placed in some
subterraneous and humid cell, for then the liquefied humor of the Myrrh will
delabe distillatively into the lower Platter.

Some use sticks in stead of plates, which they adaptate Latticewise unto the
inferior Platter, on which they lay their hard whites, gravidated with brayed
Myrrh: whose cavities must not be so strictly bound, as to deny entrance to
the liquor; for unless it get some chink, out of which it may delabe, it will
not distill into the inseriour Platter. These sticks are sometimes adapted to a
Fryingpan, or the like vessel; and the Myrrh containing Eggs, superposited
thereon, and the vessel suspended in a well, a foot or two above the water, and
there left a day or two, that the liquor may exude out of the Myrrh into the
subjected vessel. This Oil may be also educed by ascent.

Which way soever it be educed, Vires.
it is commendable for many uses; and specially efficacious in curing cutaneous
affections. They err, that take either of them for Stax, as we have showed in
our Book of Simples.

CHAP. 6. Of Oils extracted by ascent.
THe prolectation of oleous liquors, is either by descent, of which we have
briefly treated; or by ascent, of which as briefly as we may. Now this eduction
is effected two ways; either by an Alembick, or by Inclination: which later
way is, in proper speaking, neither by ascent nor descent, but participates of
both. To the distillation made by an Alembick, a straight Cucurbite is
required, whereon the rostrated Alembick may reside: the Alembick sometimes in
stead of a beak, portends out of its head a certain Pipe, long and crooked,
with turning gyres like a Serpent: whence it is called an Intort or Worm. The
neck of the Alembick should be long and gracile, if the matter to be distilled
be small and tenuious; but short, and more patent, if the matter be crasser:
and seeing it must be often changed and renovated, an Urinal will be apter then
a Cucurbite.

Sometimes Sand, Salt, or the like, is added to the matter to be distilled,
when it fervefies and ascends easily.

The vessel containing the matter, should be so fitted, that the heat might be
put under it, and that there may be a way above for the spirits, which may pass
through the beak, whereunto the long tube is appended; which tending downwards,
and trajecting it self through the Refrigeratory, carries the delabing matter
into its receptacle. Now distillation is either dry or moist: the dry
distillation is made in a furnace, sometimes by the intervent of Coals,
sometimes of Sand, and sometimes of hot ashes; the humid is made in St. Mary's
Bath. Now there are as many varieties of Baths and Furnaces, as there are
different ways of distillation; so that they can scarce be complected: But now
we shall briefly explicate, how the most usual Oils are elicited.

CHAP. 7. Oleum de Lateribus; or, Oil of Bricks.
LEt inveterate Bricks, broken into small pieces, be burned on accended coals,
till they be red-hot; then inject and dimit them into clear and old Oil, till
they be filled therewith; then beat them into powder, and put the powder in a
vitreous Cucurbite: on which impose a rostrated Alembick, and place it in a
furnace duly structed: accend the fire underneath it, and keep the Oil that
flows from it.

The Bricks that are made of old earth, should be selected as best; which
should be broken into crasser pieces, of the weight of vj. or j. which after
ignition, must be extinguished in clear antique Oil, or Oil of Rosemary, if it
may be spared, and pulverated very small, then injected into a vitreous
Cucurbite, well adapted to the furnace, and bedaubed with clay, that the powder
may therein calefie by the fire under it, and exude this Oil; which is diversely
denominated: for some Medicks call it rightly Oil of Bricks, others improperly,
Artificial Petreol, in opposition to the Natural, which distills spontaneously
out of Rocks; others, by a more special Nomenclature, call it, The Holy,
Divine, and Blessed Oil. The Alchymists do more arrogantly call it, The Oil of
Magisteries, and the Philosophers Oil; whom therefore Sylvius derides, because
they only call themselves Philosophers, in their daily speech and writings,
affirming themselves the sole Philosophers; seeking that nominally, which they
cannot attain really.

This Oil extenuates, penetrates, digests, Vires.
and absumes all excrementitious matter; conduces to the cold affections of the
Spleen, Reins, Bladder, Nerves, Uterus, and Articles; it cures also the
Lethargy, Palsy, and Epilepsie. It is hot in the third degree, and by so much
more efficacious, by how much more antique.

CHAP. 8. Oleum Vitrioli^ or, Oil of Vitriol.
TEn or twelve pounds of Vitriol may be injected into a vitreous vessel,
obduced with clay, and set on the fire, till its phlegm be extilled; then it
should be taken off and brayed, and purged from its phlegm; which should be
again iterated, till no phlegm would emanate, but the spirits leap out; then
should it be taken off the fire, and its red calx taken, pulverated, and
imposed in a crooked, or rather straight Cucurbite: whereunto, an ample
Recipient should be adapted, and diligently conjoined with clay, and the Oil
distilled by a luculent fire, continuing both night and day: when all is cold,
the whole Liquor exempted, and imposed in a vitreous vial; first the insipid
water, then the acid, which they call Oil, may be segregated from the sediment.
If this Oil be often imbrued in its phlegm, or the circulation of the spirit of
wine, it will be sweet: for Alchymists mix an equal quantity of this, and this
Oil; then they digest and evoke them out of a singular Vial, till the Alome
being separated from the Sulphur of the Chalcantum, the Oil remain sweet.

Vitriol affords many several Medicinal Remedies; as, Spirits, Oil, both acid
and sweet, Salt, Colchotar, and a certain thing the Chemists call Balsam. The
Spirit of Vitriol differs from its Oil, in its preparation, tenuity, and active
virtue: for it is the more subtle liquor of Vitriol; or, that I may speak in
their own language, the quintessence thereof; which is made after many manners,
as thus: The Vitriol is agitated very much with the vehement heat of the fire,
within its straight Vial, so that that which distills upon the pulverated earth
(which they call Colchotar) is always resunded, and at length, by the
vehemence of the fire, propelled through the crooked glass: and this is the
most efficacious Spirit. Some distill water and Oil together out of the best
Vitriol, which are crasser Spirits; which they purge from their dregs, till
they be attenuated into subtiler Spirits. But they are better elicited, while
they are driven through a new Alembick, by affunding the extillatitious liquor
always upon the dead head, and then circulating it a whole week.

The common Oil of Vitriol, is educed after this vulgar manner: A certain
quantity of natural and good Cyprian Vitriol is taken, calcinated in a vessel
of Copper, till it be quite red, and its phlegm dissipated; then it is brayed
and included in a Cucurbite, obduced with clay, irrigated with Aqua-vitae, and
so left for a day; then it is collocated, and settled in a furnace duly
structed, and at first a modorate, then a vehement fire accended under it, that
all its liquor may extil: which after refrigeration, is put in a small
Cucurbite coarctated with a capitel; and so its aqueous liquor stills in S.
Mary's Bath, and its pure Oil remains in the bottom of the vessel: which is
again put into another Cucurbite, circumcinged with accended fire, that it may
be better and more thoroughly purged. Its color is more or less red or white,
as its efficacy and calour is more or less moderate. iij. of Oil may be
elicited out of lb j. of rubefied Vitriol.

All the qualities of the Oil of Vitriol are so intense, Vires.
that it cannot be assumed alone, but mixed with some water, decoction, or fit
conserve: and though it be exceeding hot, yet a few drops thereof mixed with
much water, become acid, and both grateful and useful to the Feverish. It
penetrates by its tenuity, carries the water to remote parts, removes
obstructions, arceates putretude, recreates the bowels, and conduces much to
the Pestilence, Epilepsie, Palsy, and Strangury. It does not infect the simple
decoction of Roses, but the Syrup of Violets, with a purpureous and elegant
acid sapour; for a few drops thereof cast into an ounce of the said Syrup,
will make it from violaceous, purpureous.

CHAP. 9. Oleum Sulphuris; or, Oil of Sulphur.
LEt a broad dish be so supposited to a suspended Campana, that their brims may
be distant about three fingers; and let a vessel containing Sulphur, which has
not yet suffered fire, be put in the bottom of the dish, and accended and
agitated with a red-hot Iron; when that is absumed, let more be set on, and
ignited as before, that out of its copious vapor erected into the Campana, a
concrete oleous liquor may delabe into the dish.

Some take an equal quantity of Sulphur and Pumice or Flintstone brayed, and
putting the mixture into a crooked Cucurbite, adhibit it to a moderate fire,
and educe most excellent Oil thence.

Oil of Sulphur is educed many more ways: for some add Spirit of Wine, to
pulverated Sulphur, and accend them; when the water is absumed, they bray the
Sulphur, and mix sand with it, including them in a Vial, and eliciting Oil by a
slow fire. Some add Calx, others Tartar, and others Salt: but that is best,
which is educed out of Sulphur solely; and that next, which is educed without
these things.

The Oil of Sulphur is not only profitable for external applications, as to
deablate the teeth, deleate cutaneous foedities, Vires.
and cure venereous Ulcers; but is also introsumed for the expulsion of such
diseases as arise from flatulency, or frigid, crass, and putrid matter: it also
much conduces in the Pestilence, Epilepsie, difficulty of breathing, and many
other affections of the Lungs, if it be taken in water, or some fit decoction:
it cures the toothach, if the dolorous tooth be but touched therewith. It
infects the infusion of Roses with its praetubrous color, if a few drops of it
be injected thereinto.

CHAP. 10. Oleum Mellis; or, Oil of Honey.
LEt a fit quantity of good Honey be injected into a Boccia with a third or
fourth part of Sand; then let a rostrated capitel be fitted on it, and fire
accended below it, or else hot ashes or sand set about it, that Oil may be
elicited.

Sand, or brayed Flint-stones, are mixed with the Honey in the eduction of its
Oil, because else the whole Honey would ascend by the heat of the fire, which
should be luculent: therefore the Cucurbite and Recipient vessel should be
incrustated with clay, and the rostrated capitel ever and anon covered with
cold wet clothes. The liquor that flows first, is not the same with that that
flows next: for the first is as it were white water, the second somewhat red
and oleous: they are sometimes kept a part for several uses; but if they be
mixed together, the bath will segregate them, by extilling the more aqueous,
and retaining the more oleous part.

It cures the Podagry and Wounds; Vires.
it causes hair to grow well and thick, and infects it with a red color.

CHAP. 11. Oleum Cerae; or, Oil of Wax.
LEt some quantity of odorate Virgin-wax be melted, and mixed with a third part
of brayed Flint-stones, or sand purged from filth. When the mixture is cold,
let it be put into a straight Ampulla, covered with a rostrated capitel; let
its fire be at first slow, afterward more luculent, that the Oil may be educed.

We have selected this as the shortest and easiest of all those ways by which
this efficacious Oil is educed; yet if any would make it otherwise, let him
project the odorate liquefied wax into water eight or ten times, always
agitating it with his hands; and then put it in the Retort, and educe its Oil
by fire, or hot ashes. Now if you would not have it so spisse (for it is of the
spissitude of Butter) iterate its distillation twice or thrice, and it will be
liquid and fluxile.

An Oil may be after the same manner educed out of the Gum Elemni, most
accommodate for the cure of Wounds; yea, Oil may after the same manner be
educed out of Fats, by the addition of brayed Flint, Sand, or broken Bricks.

CHAP. 12. Oleum Terebinthinae; or, Oil of Turpentine.
THe Oil of Turpentine may be drawn either in a straight or crooked Cucurbite,
with Sand purged from dust, and a fire accended under it, at first slow,
afterward more valid. The Oil that comes first out, is clear and tenuious; the
second more crass and aureous: each should be reposed by it self.

Some add to three pounds of Turpentine, one handful of Salt, and a little
Aqua-vitae; these confusedly mixed and included in a Boccia, emit Oil by the
help of fire.

The Oil of Turpentine is introsumed to cure Asthma, Vires.
Empyema, difficulty of breathing, the Stone, cholical dolor, and frigid and
flatulent affections. It is externally adhibited to cure Nerves that are
sautiated, or labor under any distemper; and to fill wounds with flesh,
agglutinate them, and draw them to scars.

It extinguishes Quicksilver, which is then good for the French Disease.

CHAP. 13. Oleum Caryophyllorum; or, Oil of Cloves.
LEt a fit quantity of Cloves be macerated twelve hours, or a whole day in
Rainwater, in a straight or retorted Boccia well occurated, that nothing may
expire; then let the capitel be set on it, and it moved with hot ashes, to
extil Oil, which may afterward be sejoyned from the water.

This Oil may also be easily educed by an Alembick of Copper artificially
structed; as also by descent, like the Oil of Guaiacum: some add a part of
stillatitious wine to the Cloves.

Its excellent faculties make it a good substitute for Opobalsamum: for being
introsumed, it recreates the principal parts and spirits, arceates putretude,
dissipates flatulency, opens the passages, digests cold humors, and dissipates
melancholical succe: extrinsecally adhibited, it cures new wounds and old
Ulcers; it emends the corruption of bones, and allayes Toothache, arising from
a cold cause.

Oil of M^ce may be extilled after the same manner: it calefies and digests
frigid humors, roborates the ventricle, helps concoction, moves appetite, and
much more benefits the user.

The Oil of Cinamome is educed with more labor and cost: for one pound thereof
extils not above j.of Oil; but its excellency equalizes it with natural
Opobalsamum almost.

The Oil of Nutmeg is extilled as that of Mace, and exhibited to and for the
same uses; as also the Oil of Nutmegs by expression.

CHAP. 14. Oleum Anisi; or, Oil of Anise-seed.
LEt a pound, or more or less of Anise-seed, be contunded and macerated some
hours in eight or ten times as much water; then let it be put in a Copper
Alembick, with a vicine Refrigeratory; then let it be distilled, first with a
moderate, afterward a more valid fire; then segregate the Oil from the water.

When the Water and Oil thus ascend and descend together into the Receptacle,
they must be sejoyned; which may be done by a certain instrument like a Tunnel,
whereinto the whole liquor must be injected; which must be so collocated, that
the acuminated and angust part thereof, which should be obturated with wax, may
hang downwards; and so the water will occupy the lowest, and the Oil the
highest place: the wax then being rubbed off, and the hole opened, the water
will run out, and the Oil stay.

It cures the cholical dolor arising from flatulency and cold; Vires.
it conduces also to the Tympany, inflation of the belly, crudities, acid
belching, and rumbling of the Guts.

Oils may by this Art be educed out of the seeds of Petroseline, Fennel,
Dauces, and Cumin; which coming from affine Plants, have affine qualities.

CHAP. 15. Oleum de Spica; or, Oil of Spike.
LEt the greater Spike, or latifolious Lavender, be macerated in white odorate
wine, distilled through an Alembick, and then its oleous liquor segregated from
its watery, and kept.

This Oil is seldom used alone, but often mixed with other, especially Topical
Medicaments; as the Vigonian salve; and is adhibited to many more uses, besides
Medicinal ones.

The Oil of Thyme is educed by the same artifice: whether it be intrinsecally
or extrinsecally adhibited, it conduces to cold effects.

There may be a certain Liquor extracted from Pearls, brayed, macerated in
Lemmon-juyce, or distilled vinegar, solved, pulverated, madefied with
Rainwater, and artificially distilled: But the work and cost exceeding its
worth, we judge it not necessary for Shops.

CHAP. 16. Olea Metallorum; or, Oils of Metals.
ALchymists do not only out of Plants and Minerals, but of Metals also,
exhibit certain Oils, by much art, labor, and mixtion; yet they are not so
eximious as they would make them: for no Metals almost, except Gold and Silver,
are afine to our nature; and the Oils of these do little good. But g rant we,
that the tincture, or else some Liquor educed or acquired from Salnitre,
distilled Vinegar, Spirit of Wine, Aquafortis, or any, or all of these, as
also from the succe of Lemmons, should bring any help to other Medicaments; yet
in themselves they are not eximious: But whatever they be, they may not be
introsumed without damage, neither are their effects more then ancipitous, when
extrinsecally adhibited; which Hieronymus Rubeus seems to confess, who was a
most perite Alchymist: They may (says he) being extrinsecally applied by a
perite Medick, profit; but I dare not prove their virtue by introsumption,
because they are drawn from acute waters, and the force of the fire has
invested them with a quality very pernicious to the bowels: upon which account,
I much suspect many Remedies that Paracelsus extols: and many write, That all
those that introsumed his Metalline Remedies, though they found some help at
first thereby, dyed within a years space.

A prudent Apothecary then should not spend his time, nor waste his substance
in reducing Metals to Powder, macerating them in vinegar, solving them,
elaborating them with the Salt of Tartar, Nitre, or other artificial mixture,
seeing those Medicaments they usually keep in their shops, are sufficient for
Pharmacy. Here I will not disprove the use of certain Oils educed by
distillation, for the abigations of such diseases as yield not to ordinary
Medicaments. For seeing an ill knot must have a hard wedge, if the accustomed
remedy will not end the fault, we may, without a Piacle, betake out selves to
more artificial extractions: we have therefore here given the description of
certain useful and moderate Oils, which the prudent Medick may sometimes use.
And as we have neglected many more educed by distillation; so we have also
omitted many elicited by expression and impression, as superfluous, and seldom
used; as, the Oil of Costus, the Indian Nut, of Frogs, Pepper, and the like,
which were rather invented for ostentation, then necessity.

An Appendix to the Oils. Of Balsams.
BAlsam, in a general signification, denotes the Wood, Succe and Fruit of a
certain peregrine Tree; in its more special signification, only the Succe
thereof, which the Greeks call Opobalsamum. The Alchymists do wrongfully wrest
the name of Balsams to their Tinctures, Oils, Liquors, Quintessences, and
Extractions. Medicks also too licentiously, though not improperly, name some
crass and red Liquors, confected with much art and mixture, and endued with
eximious faculties, Balsams: but they should be rather called Antibalsams, or
Balsameols; which name they mutuate for Turpentine, which is as it were the
Basis from which all Aromatical and Rosinous Mixtures, which are analogous to
Balsams, have their odours, colors and faculties. They are most commonly made
by inclinative Distillation, in a Retort, wherein the aqueous liquor is at
first extolled, and then it delabes laterally through the neck of the Retort,
into the Receptacle; the oleous comes next; the third is crass like Honey.

Some Balsams are made without distillation, they including some Medicaments a
month or two in a fit Ampulla, in horse-dung, which they call the Belly, or
other place, till they be macerated, diluted and purified. Thus the water that
is collectedof Elm-leaves, when the worms within are abjected, Turpentine, Oil
of S. John's Wort, and a little Gumme-Elemni included in an Ampulla,
concorporated and insolated, or otherwise somented, become a Balsam most
efficacious, and accommodate for many uses: for it cures Ulcers, though
Dysepulotical and Malign, and all Wounds quickly.

Balsamum primum D. Mes. or, The first Balsam of D. Mes. falsely attributed to
Guidon.
choice Myrrh, Hepatick Aloes, Spikenard, Dragons blood, Frankincense, Mumy,
Opoponax, Bdellium, Carpobalsamum, Ammoniacum, Sarcocolla, Saffron, Mastick,
Gumme-Arabick, liquid Storax, of each ij. Ladanum, Castoreum, of each ij ss.
Mosch ss. Turpentine the weight of them all.

Let the dry ingredients be brayed, macerated in wine, and percolated; then let
all be mixed together with Turpentine; the whole mixture put in an Alembick:
out of which, the fire will at first force a tenuious liquor, and then a crass
and flave one, which is the best Balsam.

The description of this Balsam, is desumed from its Author Mesue, who
recenseates its faculties to admiration: It is good (says he) for all things;
and if a dead body be anointed therewith, it putrefies not: it strengthens the
Soul and Nature.

It roborates the Nerves, removes cold distempers, excites and foments native
heat, conciliates strength to the Members. If the backbone be anointed
therewith, it miraculously cures the Palsy and Stupour: in such affections as
hinder speech, a little of it immitted into the ears and nose, or holden under
the tongue of the speechless, will quickly help him. Petrus Apponensis calls
this Balsam, The Medicament of Medicaments, for the speedy roboration of the
heart, and restitution of strength.

Balsamum 2. D. Hollerii; or, The second Balsam. D. Holler.
Olibanum, Mastick, of each ij. Aloes-wood j. Cloves, Galangal, Cinnamon,

Birthwort, Dittany, the greater Comfrey, of each j. Gumme-Elemni, Opoponax,
Benzoin, of each ij. Juice of Ground Pine and Cowslips, of each ij. Turpentine
the weight of them all.

Concorporate and distill all in an Alembick, water will first extil, then that
which is more oleous, and last the crassest.

The Author says, This Balsam roborates the Nerves, cures Stupour and Palsy;
it helps all frigid distempers, and excites native heat.

Balsamum 3. vulnerarium; or, The third Balsam which is vulnerary.
of Venetian and Cyprian Turpentine, of each iij. Gum-Elemni, Olibanum, of each
ij. Aloes, Myrrh, Mastick, Benzoin, Bolearmeniack, Dragons-blood, of each ss.
Aqua-vitae iiij.

These confusedly mixed, and included in a Retort, extil a Balsam which yields
to none in agglutinating wounds, and filling them with flesh: it also roborates
the Nerves, foments the innate heat of the part, makes the scar not nodous, and
emends distempers.

Balsamum 4. D. Fallopii; or, The fourth Balsam of D.Fallop, which is also
vulnerary.
of clear Turpentine lb ij. Linseed Oil lb j. Rosine of the Pine Tree vj.
Frankincense, Myrrh, Aloes, Mastick, Sarcocolla, of each ij. Mace, Saffron,
Lignum Aloes, of each ij.

Put all into a Retort; let your fire be at first moderate, and it will educe
clear water; then incend it, and you will have rubicund Oil; keep each apart:
They are special Medicaments for the cure of wounds.

Balsamum 5. Med. Florent. or, the fifth Balsam by the Medicks of Florence.
of Turpentine lb j. old Oil vj. Oil of Bays iiij. Cinnamon, Spikenard, of each

It moves Urine, breaks stones, kills worms, helps the hissing of the ears, the
Palsy, Cramp, Gout, and all dolours of the Junctures, either by way of Potion
or Unguent: a small quantity thereof in a water fit for the affection, may be
drunk.

Balsamum 6. Euonymi; or, The sixth Balsam D. Euonym. which is yet vulnerary.
of Turpentine ss. Olibanum vj. Aloes, Mastick, Galangal, Cinnamon, Saffron,
Nutmegs, Cloves, Cubebs, of each j. Gum of Ivy ij.

Pulverate and mix them with Turpentine; then put them in a glass Alembick, and
add to them

Camphyr, and Amber-grise, of each ij.

Distill them with a slow fire: the first water will be white and clear, and is
called the Wine of Balsam; the second is flave, called Oil; the third croceous,
and that is the surest Balsam.

This Balsam is much commended for its excellent faculties: for it is the most
speedy collective of wounds, sarcotical to hollow Ulcers, and epulotical to
all: it is a sure help for the Palsy, and imbecility of the Nerves.

Balsamum 7. and vulgar; or, The seventh and vulgar Turpentine.
of Venetian Turpentine lb j. Gum-Elemni v. common Rosine iij. let these be
melted together, adding thereunto the powder of long Birthwort ij.

This Balsam is inferior to none, in perducing old or new Ulcers to sanity: it
especially cures the external diseases of the head: it is easy to make.

Balsamum 8. and admirabile; or, The eighth and admirable Balsam.
of the leaves and stowers of Tutsan, or the grains; of the leaves, flowers or
tops of S. John's Wort, the tops of both the Oaks of Jerusalem, of the leaves of
Ground Ivy, of each m. ss. of both sorts of Sage, and of Ground Pine, of each
m. ss.

Macerate them two days in lb ij. of white and generous wine; add

lb ij. ss. of old Oil:

Boil them on a slow fire, till the wine be dissipated: add to the colature

of Turpentine lb j. Olibanum iiij. Myrrh iij. Mastick, Dragons-blood, of each
ij. Storax j.

Boil them a little on a slow fire; then repose them seven days in the Sun,
and repose them in an earthen or glass vessel for use.

This Balsam is not causlesly called, The Wonderful one; for many affections
which contemn other Praesidies, are miraculously cured by the adjument of this.
It presently cures any new Wound or Ulcer: it heals also inveterate and
dyepulotical ones; it roborates the nerves, cures trembling and palsy;
conduces to all external affections of the head, especially cold ones: it
foments innate heat, allayes frigid dolours, and roborates the parts.

I could describe more, but they are needless, if these be in readiness.

Finis Libri Quarti.
The Apothecaries Shop, OR, ANTIDOTARY. Of EXTERNAL MEDICAMENTS. THE FIFTH
BOOK. Of Unguents and Cerecloths.
THE PREFACE.
UNguents were of old in such use and fame, that he that handled or sold them
solely, or them and other Medicaments, was called an Unguentary and Myropolist.
The Arabians often call Cerecloths and Salves, Unguents: as Dioscorides does
many odorate Oils; according to that of Hippocrates, A Medick should be
Unguented, that is, Perfumed, that by the fragrant halite of his vesture, he
may purchase glory amongst the vulgar. But now Unguents are in a more angust
acceptance, taken only for those Medicaments which adhibited and illited only
on external parts, are thought to auxiliate them, when other Medicaments would
either through their gravity burden them, or through their humidity hurt them;
and are olaginous, of a middle consistence, betwixt a Cerecloth and a Liniment,
as a Cerecloth is betwixt an Unguent and a Salve. Now the proportion of Oil in
the confection of an Unguent, is such, that one ounce thereof responds to each
dragm of Powder, and two dragms of Wax: So that there is four times as much Oil
as Wax, and eight times as much Oil as Powder. And seeing heat makes the
consistence of an Unguent softer, and cold harder, Myropolists used to mix more
Oil in Winter, and less in Summer, with their ingredients. Now seeing there is
much conformity betwixt a Cerecloth and an Unguent, both consisting of the same
Materials, only differing in proportion; the Unguent receiving more Oil and
less Wax, that it may be of a middle consistence betwixt a Liniment and a
Cerecloth, more spisse then the one, and more liquid then the other: We have
determined to treat of them both in this Book: In whose first Section we shall
describe the most approved and usual Unguents; in the second, Cerecloths. Now
Unguents are either made with fire, as those that admit Wax, Rosines, and
decoctions of Simples; or without fire, as such as need only nutrition and
subaction, as the crude Unguent, and the Unguent of Quicksilver; of which we
shall in particular treat in this Book, beginning with the Refrigerative: The
first whereof that occurs, is the Unguent of Roses.

CHAP. 1. Unguentum Rosatum; or, The Unguent of Roses. D.Mes.
Hogs-suet nine times washed in hot and cold water, fresh red Roses, of each lb
iij. mingle them, and let them be macerated seven days; afterward boil them
upon a gentle fire, and let them be strained; afterward fresh Roses put in,
macerated, boiled, and strained, as before; afterward pour upon it, of the
Juice of red Roses lb j. ss. Oil of sweet Almonds lb ss. boil them upon a
gentle fire, till the Juice be consumed; and if in boiling you add a little
Opium, it will be excellent to procure sleep.

The COMMENTARY.
That this Unguent may be duly confected, the Hog's Grease should be accurately
purged from its membranes, nine times washed in warm water, and nine times in
cold, that it may depose all its odor; for so it will be more apt to receive
any odor, and easily admit of the fragrance of Roses. Now the maceration of
the Roses should be iterated, that they may be more efficacious: half as much
of their succe, and the sixth part of as much of the Oil of Almonds, as there
is of grease, should ingrede the colature, according to Mesue. But to three
pounds of Hog's Grease, we put a pound and an half of the succe of Roses, and
half a pound of the Oil of Almonds. Some, in stead of the Oil of Almonds, put
the Oil of Roses or Omphacinum; but then the Unguent will not open the pores of
the skin, nor permeate so quickly. It may be made without any Oil, seeing it is
liquid enough of it self: and thus, almost, all Myropolists make it. But it is
better to have it too liquid with the Oil of Almonds, then too crass without
it: And as it is against the Rules of Art, that all the quantity of Oil which
Mesue prescribes, should be taken; sois it contrary to right Reason, that all
should be refused.

Some, to acquire a greater redness, and more elegant color, whereof
Aromataries are most studious, mix Alcanet-root with the coction: but it were
much better to mutuate that color from Roses, then other irrequisite simples.

Mesue would have Opium diluted in Rose Water, accede its confection, that it
might withal conciliate sleep to the interruptly vigilant: whereunto I
willingly assent, and wish, that Apothecaries would confect, if not all, yet
part of this Unguent with Opium.

It extinguishes immoderate heat, inflammations, pimples, and S. Anthonies
fires: it allayes the dolours of the head from a hot cause: it mitigates the
ardour of the Ventricle, Reins, and Liver: that which admits Opium, effects all
these more validly; and besides conciliating of sleep, cures Frenzy, and
refects strength.

Unguents of Violets, Water Lillies, and other flowers, of all qualities, may
be confected after the same manner.

CHAP. 2. Unguentum Album Rhasis; or, Rhasis his white Unguent.
Oil of Roses ix. Ceruse washed in Rose Water iij. white Wax ij. make it into
an Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
This Unguent consists of few things, and is described alike by few Authors.
We conjecture, that the variety of its descriptions arises from this, That
Rhasis its author gave not the dosis of the simples definitely, and therefore
every one augments, diminishes, and changes them at his own will. Some, rather
desiring the grace of odor then virtue, adject Camphyr; others the succe of
Tragacanthum: some Lithargie; others the whites of Eggs: so that its
description is nowhere certain, but at Paris, where all the Apothecaries make
it after this; who so rub the Ceruse on the setaceous sieve, that it will go
through; then they wash it often in common water, afterward in Rose Water; then
they dry it, and after siccation, rub it to powder, which they mix with wax
melted in the Oil of Roses, and by agitation with a Spatle, reduce it into an
Unguent of a white color, and legitimate consistence, which is endued with
much virtue; for it cures the Itch, Scab, Adustion, Galling, Vires.
Ulcers, the eruption of Pimples, Tetters, the hot distemper of Ulcers, and
many other cutaneous vices.

CHAP. 3. Unguentum Populeon; or, The Unguent of Poplar. D.N.Myr.
of the buds of the black Poplar-tree lb j. ss. of the leaves of black Poppy,
Mandrake, the tender tops of Bramble, Henbane, Nightshade, Lettice, small
Stonecrop, the greater and lesser House-leek, Violetleaves, Cotyledon
Kidney-wort, of each iij. fresh Hogs-suet lb iij. make it into an Unguent
according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Salernitanus borrowed this description of Myrepsus, and Praepositus of
Salernitanus; but neither of them gave due honor to its Author, both covering
his Name. Now it is called the Populean Unguent, from its Basis, the tender
eyes or buds of the black Poplar, which erupt out of its summities in the
beginning of the Spring, and are collected in March, before they be perfectly
explicated: whereunto, many Refrigeratory and Hypnotical Medicaments are
adjoined, as the leaves of Mandrake, Poppy, Henbane, Lettice, and Nightshade,
and of both the House-leeks, and Stone-crop: but that Vermicular should be
selected, which bears white flowers, and affects not the tongue with any
acrimony. The leaves also of Kidney-wort, which perite Herbalists call
sometimes Cymbal, sometimes Coral, and sometimes Venus her Navel, must be added
hereunto; and it is thus made: The fresh buds of the Poplar must be contunded,
and mixed with the grease purged from its membranes, and put into a figuline
vessel well operculated, and reposed in moderate heat, till May or June, or
till the other expetible Plants may be had; which must then be collected,
purged, brayed in a Mortar, and concorporated with the former fermentated
mixture; which must then again be reposed in a warmer place for a week or
longer; then put in a Caldron with one pound of Wine, or Vinegar, which many
think more convenient: but wine in so small a quantity will not harm the
Refrigeratives; whereas some would add Burre-dock, which is hotter; some take
Nightshades succe to it, that the color may be greener.

It conciliates sleep, Vires.
helps such as labor under hot Fevers or Headaches from hot causes, if their
foreheads and temples, their feetplants or hands-palms be anointed therewith.

CHAP. 4. Ungaentum Natritum, seu crudum; or, The crude or Triapharmacal
Unguent of Lithargie. D.Mes.
of Oil of Roses lb j. Litharge finely beaten lb ss. Vinegar iiij. beat these
together in a Mortar, till they acquire the consistency of an Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
This is one of those Unguents which are depraved by each Artist, because of
the indefinite dosis of the simples whereof it consists: for Mesue prescribes
only to this preparation, That sometimes Oil, sometimes Vinegar and Lithargie,
accede, which should be well labored in a Mortar: yea, many to this day
neither limit the quantity of Oil nor of Vinegar, butonely describe as much as
will suffice; others take equal parts of both, and as much Lithargie; others,
and that better, take one pound of Oil, half a pound of Lithargie, and three
ounces of Vinegar: We have given a due proportion of each; yet if the
Myropolist in its agitation find one thing too little or too much, he may at
his judgment change it. Now this Unguent should be continually agitated with a
Pestel, till it acquire a fit spissitude. Much of Oil or Vinegar must not at
first be affunded on the Lithargie, lest it be submerged, and never be able to
attain an Unguentary consistence. Some agitate it in a plumbeous Mortar, with a
plumbeous Pestel, that it may be more desiccative: but this obscurer tincture
many like not in Unguents; others wash Lithargic in Rose Water: some add the
succe of Nightshade with Ceruse; but it is best to prepare it after the form
given, which the Parisian-Apothecaries follow: yet all need not at all times to
take Oil of Roses, but, without error, sometimes common Oil. It is called the
crude Unguent, because it is made without fire; the nutritum, because with much
nutrition it acquires an Unguentary form; sometimes the Triapharmacal, from the
union of the three simples whereof it consists: of which, duly cocted, may be
made a salve, that should be kept in all shops, as most usual.

It represses, desiccates, generates flesh in hollow Ulcers, Vires.
and heals them.

CHAP. 5. Unguentum de Bolo; or, The Unguent of Bole.
Bole-armeniack lb ss. of the Juyces of Nightshade and Plantain, of each iij.
Vinegar ij. Oil of Roses lb j. Mingle them, and stir them together in a Mortar,
till they come to the consistency of an Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
Guido Cauliacus gives the same or like description, which, they say, he
discerped from the ninth Book of Galens simples: but I evolving that Book,
find no such thing. But whoever was its Author, it is a Medicament very
expetible by Surgeons. The preparation of this and of the precedent, is one;
and both being made without fire, may be called Crude Unguents.

It is refrigerative, astrictive, and roborative; very convenient for the
beginnings of fluxions, and therefore hinders the eruption of Pimples,
Inflammations, and the like.

CHAP. 6. Unguentum Stypticum; or, The Styptical Unguent. D.Fern.
of Oil of Roses often washed in Alome-water lb j. ss. white Wax iiij. unripe
Galls, Cypress Nuts, Balanstians, Pomegranate-Pill, Acorn-Cups, Acacia, Sumach,
Mastick, of each j. and with the Juice of Medlars and Sorb-apples, make it up
into an Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
This Unguent being most validly astrictive, may, according to Plantius, be
usurped for the Unguent of Comitissa, or any other astrictive. That it may be
rightly made, all its ingredients must be pulverated small, and macerated about
four days in the succes of Sorb-apples and Medlars, or each of them; then
dried on a slow fire, and mixed with wax melted in Oil.

It is the principal of astrictives; it roborates imbecile parts; it stays
fluent humors, and angustates and constringes laxer parts: for it intercepts
all fluxions, Vires.
cohibits the prolapse of the Matrix, Uterus, Fundament, and Intestines; and by
adhibition, stays the bloody flux, retracts the pendent Mammillaries, makes
them lesser, and erugates the belly after birth.

CHAP. 7. Desiccativum rubrum; or, The red Desiccative.
Oil of unripe Olives lb j. white Wax v. Terra-Lemnia, or Bolearmeniak, Lapis
Calimiaris, of each iiij. Lithargie of Gold, Ceruse, of each iij. Camphyr j.
make it into an Unguent according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
This Topical Medicament, which is most usual and successful, is from its
effect called Desiccative; from its color, Red. And though its Author be
uncertain, yet all describe it and make it after this form: Ceruse, Camphyr,
and Lithargie must be brayed and levigated apart, the wax by moderate heat
melted in Oil; yet so, that the Camphyr may be last injected: all this
confusedly mixed together, must be diligently agitated with a ligneous Spatula,
that they may acquire a legitimate spissitude.

It may also be made as Sylvius would have it: The Lithargie may be first
nutrited by fire, then mixed with the other powders; but thus coadunated, it is
more Desiccative, and less Refrigerative: some make it with Lemnian-Earth; but
Bole makes it as efficacious.

It refrigerates, roborates, stays fluxions, defends parts affected; digests,
absumes, and siccates excrementitious humidity, and heals Ulcers and Wounds.

CHAP. 8. Unguentum Diapompholygos; or, The Unguent of Pompholyx. D. N. Alex.
of Oil of Roses x. the Juice of Nightshade granes iiij. boil them gently, till
the Juice be consumed; add white Wax v. Psimmythii.
washed Ceruse iij. Powder of Lead, Pompholyx, of each ij. Frankincense j.
Reduce them into the form of an Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
This Unguent is desumed from Alexandrinus, but the dosis of its simples
changed, and its self redacted to a better form, according to Sylvius his
castigation: Its Basis is Pompholix. What this Pompholix is, and how it differs
from Tutia, has been declared. Alexandrinus prescribes the powder of burnt
Lead, to be assumed and washed; but I had rather use the powder of crude Lead,
as better. However, he that will have burnt Lead, he may use it thus, by
Dioscorides his advice: Put thin plates of Lead into a new earthen pot, and
sprinkle Sulphur upon them; then put in more, and still sprinkle Sulphur on
them, till the pot be full; then accend the Sulphur, and stir the flagrant Lead
with a ferreous rudicle, till it be perfectly redacted to powder, and cleave to
the rudicle; then stopping your nostrils, lest the halite offend you, take out
the Lead: the file-dust of Lead may be easily burnt with Sulphur; as also
without it, if thin plates thereof be imposed on a luculent fire, and moved
with a ferreous rudicle, till all be solved into ashes.

Some burn it without Sulphur, thus: They repose it in a new earthen pot, and
circumcepting it with burning coals; melt it, always stirring it with a
ferreous rudicle, and augmenting the intense heat of the fire, till it eructate
much spume, and at last wholly become spume, which is like ashes, and may be
easily pulverated by a second adhibition to the fire: when it is burnt and
pulverated, it must be washed like Cadmia; but it might be easily redacted to
powder, while crude, if its thin plates were minutely incided, immerged three
days in sharp Vinegar, daily changed, and then exempted, dried and brayed
without ustion. Now for the confection of the Unguent, first coct the succe of
Nightshade in the Oil of Roses, till the succe be dissipated; then melt the wax
in the same Oil; then add the small powders, and agitate the mixture with a
ligneous rudicle, till it be cold, and in form of an Unguent.

It is the best curer of wounds: for it mitigates their heat, Vires.
dryes their humidity, tames their malignity, allayes their dolor, impletes
their cavities, and draws them to scars: it is most convenient for the Ulcers
of the Legs.

CHAP. 9. Unguentum ad Pruritum; or, An Unguent for the Itch.
Hogs-suet often washed in the Juice of Scabious, sour Dock-roots boiled to
Pultess, and pulped; Brimstone washed in Juice of Lemmons, of each j. ss.
Unguenti Populeon nourished in the Juice of Enula-campane ss. mix them well
together in a Mortar.

The COMMENTARY.
Whilst I was writing these things, there came a Rustic to sinplore my help
for a Kinsman of his, who being continually pestred with a pastulous Itch, and
had been forced to buy a Remedy of a Barber-Surgeon; the Barber sold him a
familiar Unguent made of Mercury, Sulphur, and Swines-grease, wherewith he
anointed his body once or twice: but the Unguent did so violently move the
Colluvies of his whole body toward his neck and throat, that by violent
suptation, the man was almost suffocated. I will recenseate no more such
stories: for hence it sufficiently appears, what error the imperite are
hurried into, while they unhappily prescribe a Liniment confected of
Quicksilver and Fat, or Butter and Sulphur. But lest they again run into the
like folly, or for want of others, prescribe such dangerous ones, we give this
Unguent, which is easy to make, and most efficacious in curing the Itch; for
it mitigates bilious humors, and sharp and salt phlegm: it moderates all calid
humors, and cures the itchy Scab.

CHAP. 10. Unguentum Ophthalmicum; or, The Ophthalmical Unguent.
Bole-armeniack washed in Rose Water j. Lapis Caliminaris washed in
Eyebright-water, Tutty prepared, of each ij. Pearl finely beaten ss. Camphyr
ss. Opium gr. v. fresh Butter often washed in Plantainwater v. make it into an
Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
It can scarce be credited, to how many and great diseases and symptoms the
eye is obnoxious: for the oppugning whereof, many kinds of Medicaments are
profitable; but the forms of all are not idoneous; for the eyes will not
tolerate any, save Collyries and Unguents: for Cataplasms, Salves, and the
like, may sometimes profit, when applied to the Eyelids; but immitted into the
Eye, they would blind it. This Ophthalmical Unguent, so called from its
effect, arceates the fluxions of humors, temperates their heat, mitigates
their acrimony, stays and dryes away tears, allayes dolor, takes away
redness, and roborates the Eye, if after its universal remedies, purgation and
phlebotomy, it be adhibited to the Angles of the Eyes and Eyelids.

CHAP. 11. Unguentum de Minio; or, The Unguent of Red-Lead, or the red
Camphyrated Unguent.
of sifted Red-Lead iij. Lithargie ij. Ceruse j. ss. Tutty iij. Camphyr ij. Oil
of Roses lb j. ss. make it into an Unguent according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
There are two descriptions of this Unguent; one more simple, which is made
without; the other more composititious, which is made with Camphyr. It is
called the red Unguent, from its color, and its Basis Red-Lead: it conduces to
ill and inveterate Ulcers, which scarce admit of integral curation, and
perduces them to scars.

Of hot Unguents.
CHAP. 12. Unguentum Resumptivum; or, The Resumptive Unguent. D.Praep.
yellow Wax lb ss. Hogs-suet quart. j. Goose, Duck, and Capons-grease, Oil of
Almonds, Dill, and Chamomile, of each ij. the musilidge of Marshmallow-roots
and Linseed, of each j. ss. the Oesypum.
Grease that proceeds from the necks of sheep ss. make it into an Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
Rondeletius finding this Unguent in Praepositus his Antidotary, in many things
reprehensible; some things he detracted, others he substituted; others he
disallowed of, as inaccommodate to that purpose; and the whole Composition he
much changed: for in stead of white wax, he puts flave; in stead of Oil of
Violets, the Oil of Almonds: but he expunges the succe of Tragacanthum,
Gum-Arabick, and Quinces-grains, as inconvenient by their astrictive virtue to
digest humors. But if in resolving the principles of Diseases, some
Roboratives be requisite; when use calls for this Unguent, a little Oil of
Quinces, or Omphacium, or the like, as occasion requires, may soon be mixed
therewith. Now that it may be more digestive, the succe of Foenugreek is added
thereto, though in small quantity, because its odor is insuave. If the Marrow
of Calves-bones be adjected, it will be more emollitive and laxative, according
to Fernelius. That it may be duly made, the wax first cut into pieces, must be
melted with the Oil; then the Butter and Greases: when all are melted, Oesypus
must be added to them, and all agitated with a rudicle; then they may be taken
from the fire, and the succes extracted first in common, or, as some say is
better, in Rose Water, must be mixed with them, and all moved with a stick,
till they acquire a due spissitude.

This Unguent leniates the dolours of the Breast, cocts the humors that cause
coughing, moves spittle, helps the pleurisy, resolves the useless and noxious
humors that adhere to the Muscles of the Breast, and relaxates, leniates, and
mollifies the parts.

CHAP. 13. Unguentum de Althea; or, The Ointment of Marshmallows. D. Myreps.
of Marshmallow-roots, Linseed, and Foenugreek, of each lb ss. Squills iij. let
them be washed, and macerated for three days in lb v. of water; then boil
them, till they grow thick: to a pound of this musilidge, add lb ij. of Oil;
boil them, till the musilidge be dissipated; then add Wax lb ss. clarified
Rosine, common Rosine, of each iij. Turpentine, Gum-Thraganth, Gum of Ivy, of
each j. Let all these be melted in a Kettle, stirred, and so removed from the
fire, till it grows cold, and becomes into the consistence of an Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
Fernelius gives a far more simple description of this Unguent, omitting
Squills, Scammony, Galbanum, and Ivy Gum, because they make the Unguent too
sordid: and lest these should impair its digestive faculty by their absence, he
adds some simples to make it efficacious. Yet I think these so necessarily
requisite, that he that expunges them, expunges much of the odor and virtue of
the Medicament. If Ivy Gum cannot be had, its succe may be substituted. The
quantity of water, which was three pounds, being too little to elicite and coct
the succes in, is augmented to five pounds.

The rest are easy; the manner of its confection, and the description, plain.

It calefies, Vires.
mollifies, mitigates, humectates, and digests: thence it removes the cold
distemper, and cures the hardness of the nerves; it emends too much siccity,
and cures the Pleurisy, and other affections arising from crude humors
adhering to the Muscles.

CHAP. 14. Tetrapharmacum; or, The lesser Basilicon. D.Mes.
yellow Wax, Rosine, black Pitch, of each ij. ss. sweet Oil lb j. make it into
an Unguent according to Art.

Basilicum majus; or, The greater Basilicon.

Wax, clarified Rosine, Heifers-suet, Ship-Pitch, Frankincense, Myrrh, of each
j. Oil lb j. make it into an Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
This Medicament is from its prepollent faculty in cocting and suppurating
humors, called the Basilical or Regal Unguent: which, when it consists only
of four Simples, is called Tetrapharmacum, or lesser Basilicum; when of more,
the greater Basilicum: both of them are Diapyetical, or suppurative; but the
simple one is more imbecile, and less calid, then the more composititious:
wherefore, being temperate, it is more idoneous for cocting and suppurating
humors. For the temperate Medicament is truly pepastical and maturative,
having more cognation with our native calour: whence Galen says, It rather
acts by quantity then quality; whereas Resolvatives, being more valid, work
more by quality then by quantity, not absuming superfluous humors. Seeing then
that this Tetrapharmacum is as it were symmetral, it must needs be the best
suppuratory; and by cocting humors, rightly convert them into slimy matter,
just as the temperate palm of a man's hand, moved long on any part abounding
with prave humors.

Rosine and black Pitch, which has not yet been used in pitching ships, must
be melted with Oil, and when cold, agitated with a Pestel into the consistence
of an Unguent.

The Tetrapharmacal or Basilical Unguent, mitigates dolours, Vires.
cocts noxious humors impacted on the part, allay their acrimony, and fill
Ulcers with flesh.

CHAP. 15. Mundificatum expertum; or, The expert Mundificative.
of Wormwood, the lesser Centaury, Egrimony, Speedwel, Clary, Plantain, of each
m.j. macerate them in lb xij. of water, and boil them upon a gentle fire; and
in lb ss. of the colature, dissolve common Honey lb ss. boil them again, till
the water be almost consumed; to which, add Oil of Roses lb j. wax melted in
the same iij. powder of burnt Crabs iij. flower of Lupines, and powder of
Gentian, of each ij. Myrrh, Aloes, of each j. ss. Orris, Verdigrease, of each
j. make these into an Unguent according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Seeing vulgar Dispensatories afford no eximious Mundificative, responsible to
Surgeons minds in deterging Ulcers, we have for their sakes concinnated
this rhyptical or extersive Medicament, endued with such faculties, as Galen
requires, Reason calls for, and Use approves of to that end: For seeing such a
Medicament should by the tenuity of its substance, and its exsiccative faculty,
exterge the Ulcer, and separate the filth from the part whereunto it is
adhibited; one that is emplastical and viscid, aggesting and cohibiting the
excrements and filth within the Ulcer, is much distant from such. But the
vulgar Mundificatives, being for the most part made of Sarcocolla,
Frankincense, and Mastick; and sometimes of Rosine, Comfrey, and House-leek,
are so far from cleansing Ulcers, that they much defile them. Let then this
our rhyptical Unguent, which will effect what it pollicitates, be kept in
shops, and the rest ejected.

It receives burnt River-crabfishes, which are eximious in exterging and
exsiccating: The River-crabfishes should be selected; but in defect thereof,
Sea-crabs may be assumed. They must be burned on a red-hot Platter, till they
may be easily levigated; their powder must be mixed with the powders of the
other simples brayed apart; then must all be incorporated, agitated, and united
into an Unguent of just crassitude.

It absumes the watery, Vires.
separates the crasser, and exterges all humors from the Ulcer: yet such as
are conspurcated with crasser corruption, and cadaverous flesh, require a more
valid and catharetical Detersive. However, this by a peculiar and eximious
faculty, cures wounds inflicted by mad Dogs, extinguishes their virulency by a
specifical propriety, and exterging, siccating, and absuming their infected
humors.

CHAP. 16. Unguentum Aureum; or, The golden Unguent. D.Mes.
of Oil lb ij. yellow Wax lb ss. clear Turpentine ij. Rosine, clarified Rosine,
of each j. ss. Olibanum, Mastick, of each j. Saffron j. make it into an Unguent
according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
This Unguent is called Aureous, from its color; and Regal, from its virtue:
for it is flave as Gold, and so eximious, as it is fit for a Prince: it is
scarce ever exhibited without success, and yet so easy to make, that the
youngest Apprentice cannot err therein. They act perperously, who for
Parsimonies sake, abstract Saffron and Mastick from it; for so they rob it of
its aureous color, and regal virtue.

If rightly made, it agglutinates wounds with sanity, fills hollow and cleansed
Ulcers with flesh, mitigates dolor, if there be any, and quickly perduces them
to scars.

The Fusk Unguent, which is made of a pound and an half of Oil, four ounces of
new wax, black Pitch and Sagapene, of each two ounces, Mastick, Galbanum,
Frankincense, and Turpentine, of each one ounce, is endued with the same or
like faculties; for both are sarcotical, filling Ulcers with flesh, and
perducing them to sanity.

CHAP. 17. Unguentum Enulatum cum Mercurio; or, The Ointment of Enula with
Mercury.
of the root of Enula boiled in Vinegar, and pulped lb j. Hogs-suet iij. new
Wax j. Quicksilver killed, clear Turpentine, of each ij. common Salt ss. make
it into an Unguent of a just consistence.

The COMMENTARY.
Praepositus discerpted this description from Myrepsus, who has such an
Unguent in the end of his third Section; who, that he might seem the first
Author, added Oil, Wax, Salt, and Turpentine, and made it more efficacious: yet
before this adjection, Myrepsus, because of its admirable faculties, called it,
The wonderful Unguent.

Pharmacopolists make it most usually after the greater description, as more
secure then the simple one; though both of them are averse to Nature, because
of the Quicksilver: yet its extinction by spittle, or the succe of Lemmons, may
excuss all fear from their minds. Moreover, Turpentine and Swines-grease are
added thereto; which would obscure its ferity, if any remained. Some put
Sulphur in stead of Quicksilver; others the succe of Fumatory, or Lemmons:
some, to the confection of this Unguent, only bray the root of Enula in
Vinegar, and traject it through a sieve; but it is better to coct it to
putrelage, in two pounds of Vinegar, and two pounds of water, rather then in
Vinegar only, for so it is too acrimonious.

Let the grease therefore be added to the wax, melted in Oil, and afterward
add the pulp of Enula, then the Quicksilver, Salt, and Turpentine; which mix
together, agitate, and subact into an Unguent.

It is very efficacious in curing the dry and moist Scab from what cause
soever, and other foedities of the skin. Vires.


CHAP. 18. Unguentum ad Vermes; or, An Unguent against Worms.
of the lesser Centaury, Wormwood, flower of Lupines, of each j. Pulp of
Coloquintida macerated in Vinegar and dried ij. Oil of bitter Almonds lb ss.
Wax j. ss. make it into an Unguent of a just consistence.

The COMMENTARY.
Worms are generated in many parts of the body, especially in such, where there
is any corrupt excrementitious matter; as in the Intestines; out of which,
three kinds of Worms are rejected: out of the superior Intestines, round and
long ones; out of the Colon, broad ones; and out of the straight gut,
ascarides, or short grubs: all are killed by sharp, salt, acid, and amare
Medicaments introsumed, as by Aloes, Southernwood, and Rhabarb; or externally
adhibited, as by the Unguent we have here described: for whose preparation,
Coloquintida must be first brayed, and macerated in Vinegar; then dried by
insolation, or the heat of ashes; afterward it must be mixed with wax, melted
in Oil, with the other simples redacted to powder; then all must be agitated,
and accurately united into an Unguent.

It kills Worms, Vires.
if the umbilical region be anointed therewith, or the whole belly; or if a
part thereof be injected into the belly like a Glyster up the Fundament.

CHAP. 19. Unguentum ad Achoras, vulgo Tineam; or, An Ointment against Moth. D.
Gordion.
of white and black Hellebore, living Brimstone, Auripigmentum, Lithargie,
Limestone not quenched, Alome, Galls, Soot, of each ss. Quicksilver killed,
Verdigrease, of each ij. make of these a Powder, which boil upon a gentle fire
in the Juyces of Borrage, Scabious, Fumatory, Sorrel, and Vinegar, of each iij.
and when the Juyces are consumed, add old Oil lb j. liquid Pitch ss. Wax a
little, to make it up into an Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
Gordonius is perhibited the first Author of this Unguent, though Johannes de
Concoregio mentions one, who dissents from the dosis of the Hellebores limited
by him; as also Guido Cauliacus, who detracts much from the quantity of
Quicksilver and Verdigrease; whose castigation we follow. The Quicksilver may
be extinguished after many manners; but the most usual way is by jejune
spittle, or succe of Lemmons, or sometimes of Henbane: the rest are easy to
prepare, and the form is plain.

Gordonius says, that this Unguent is of such eximious virtue, that it will,
without doubt, after purgation of the body, cure all infections curable by
humane knowledge; as the Moth, Scab, Vires.
Malid Mortuum, Morphews, and all other infections: wherefore (as he says) it
should be had in much honor and reverence.

CHAP. 20. Unguentum Apostolorum; or, The Ointment of the Apostles. D.Avic.
of common Oil lb ij. Wax, Turpentine, Rosine, Ammoniacum, of each xiiij.
Lithargie of Gold ix. round Birthwort, Olibanum, Bdellium, of each vj. Myrrh,
Galbanum, of each ss. Opoponax, Verdigrease, of each ij. make it into an
Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
They say Avicenna both invented and denominated this Unguent; and yet he
neither knew the number of the Apostles, nor worshipped God in that way: for
such as follow Gods Laws, and know him truly, know thus much for certain, that
the Apostles cured the diseased by words, and the very shadow of their
vestures, and not by Unguents. Whence I easily believe, that the Interpreters
of the Arabian Tongue erred, in rendering this Unguent, which Avicenna calls
Alhauarim, The Apostles Unguent. But whoever imposed this Nomenclature, I will
not disallow of it; for it designs a Compound of so many Simples as there were
Apostles: which is thus made:

First the Gummes are macerated twelve hours in Vinegar; then strained, and
cocted on a slow fire, to the spissitude of Honey; wherein, whilst hot,
Turpentine should be diluted: in the meanwhile, the Lithargie should be
levigated in Oil, and nutrited on a slow fire; in which, the Wax and Rosine
must be melted: with which, after ablation from the fire, the Gummes duly
prepared must be injected; then Aristolochy, Myrrh, and Frankincense; and at
length Rust; whose dofis many imperitely augment, that they may make the
Unguent more green: but it acquires more vehement acrimony, together with its
color, and thence becomes too mordacious and noxious.

It expurges wounds and contumacious Ulcers by detersion, absumes dead flesh,
and accelerates the restitution of new flesh.

The Unguent of Chalk seven or ten times washed in common water, and then in
Rosewater, and excepted into a sufficient quantity of Oil, and redacted to the
crassitude of an Unguent, does very much agree with this in quality; for it
efficaciously exterges corruption from Ulcers, absumes humidity, and heals
them. There is another more composititious Unguent of this sort made, whereunto
they add Ceruse, Pompholyx, Lithargie, Calves-fat, and the Unguent of Roses;
but it is seldom in use.

CHAP. 21. Unguentum Aegyptiacum; or, The Egyptian Unguent.
Verdigrease v. Honey xiiij. strong Vinegar vij. boil them upon a fire, till
they be brought into the form of an Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
That all Egyptians were Medicks, is now a Proverb; and that the first Laws of
curing, and many Medicaments, were deduced from them, their ancient Writings
and Monuments attest. But the Greeks, always covetous of glory, have so
craftily changed what they borrowed from them, that they are now thought the
first Authors: yet there are yet some Oils and Unguents from them denominated,
as this now described, which was at first divulged by an Egyptian. For it is
probable, that it rather derived its name from this cause, then from its dusky
color, like that of the Egyptians. Many call it the Melleous Unguent, from
its Basis, which is Honey; but use must sometimes be preferred before reason:
We, with Myropolists, call it the Egyptian Unguent. It is thus made: The Honey
must be cocted with Vinegar, and pulverated Verdigrease, in an earthen vessel,
on a slow fire, till the Vinegar be dissipated, the tincture of the Verdigrease
changed, and all brought to the consistence of an Unguent. Mesue calls it the
great Unguent, that is, the eximious; not in difference of any lesser.

It is of most use for inveterate and fistulous Ulcers; for it deterges them,
arceates putretude, absumes corruption, eats up excrescent and dead flesh, but
not without sense of dolor: if masculine Frankincense be added to it,
whereunto Mesue seems to assent, it will be somewhat milder, and not so
sarcotical.

Unguent according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Myrepsus calls this Unguent (...), the Latins de Agrippa, referring it, by
what reason I know not, to King Agrippa. But perhaps it is so called, because
it is made of the succes of wild simples left by maceration in Oil, for (...)
is wild succe, whence its Nomenclature is detorted. But I mean not to dissert
about the reason of the name, seeing the thing is well known. Salernitanus
changed a little this description given by Myrepsus, taking in stead of the
root of wild Althea, the root of Asinine Cucumer, as more convenient for his
purpose, in educing watery humors, and more accommodated to the cure of the
Dropsy, for which Myrepsus institutes it. Its preparation is of this sort:
First fresh roots must be selected, washed, diligently purged from their filth,
and brayed; then they must be macerated in Oil five or six days in a Potters
vessel upon hot ashes; then cocted till they be tabid, and their aqueous
humidity be exhaled, then strained; the colature must again be adhibited to the
fire: whereinto, when it is ready to boil, the wax must be injected, and so an
Unguent made by Art; Vires.
wherewith the Hydropticals belly may be anointed for benefit, and the
Splenaticks left Hypochondrium. It subduces the belly, though it be but
extrinsecally applied, but especially childrens and weaker men's bellies: it is
endued with many more qualities, which for brevities sake I omit.

roots be macerated in Wine, boiled with the Oil, strained, and then the Fats
and Powders added, and so make it into an Unguent according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
They that will evolve the Commentaries of Medicks about the preparation of
this Unguent, shall find as many varieties as Authors in its descriptions: for
Salernitanus adds the roots of Bryony, Asinine Cucumer, and the leaves of both
Fleabanes; Fernelius admits of this addition, and omits the roots of Orris, and
changes the dosis; others either add or detract other things. We follow
Joubertus, who more faithfully adheres to the Author; and we exhibit the
description he redacted into due order. It preparation is thus: The roots and
herbs must be brayed, purged from their filth, and macerated a whole day; next
day they may be taken out, and well brayed; then immerged in Oil, where they
should continue seven days; then let them be cocted and strained: to the
colature, add Butter, Fat, and Wax: when these are melted, let Oil be poured
on, and then the Powders mixed with it: all, thus permixed and subacted,
confect an Unguent of a legitimate consistence, which from its effect is called
(...), that is, Auxiliatory; by some, Adjutory; by Praepositus foolishly,
Aragon.

It cures cold affections, Vires.
convulsions, resolutions, cholical and articulate dolours: it is good to
anoint the backbone and shoulder-points with it, before the invasion of the
Quartane-Ague.

and the Oil added to them; which again let be boiled: in the strained liquor,
dissolve the Wax, afterward the Butter and the Fats, and last of all the
Powders.

The COMMENTARY.
Salernitanus thinks, that this Unguent should be called Martianum, from
Martianus; Manlius says, Martiatum, from Martiaton, a most perite Medick, and
its Inventor: But whose-ever it was, he has described it a most efficacious
and useful Medicament: which consisting of many Simples, is called, The great
Martiate, in reference to one more simple, delivered by Alexandrinus.

But lest any one should err in its dispensation, we shall dilucidate the
obscure appellations of some of its simples: By Acanthum then we understand
Brank-ursine; by Balsamita, Water-Mint; by Elelisphacum, Sage; by Spargula, the
Greeks Goose-grass; by herba Venti, not Pellitory of the wall, sometimes so
called, but wild Anemone: however, either of them may be taken without any
error; by herba Paralysis, Primcrose; by Nostras Costus, Grecian Mint,
commonly called, S. Mary's grass; by Sempervive, House-leek, or the greater
Aizoon; by Quinque Nervia, Plantain; by Cardiobotanum, Carduus Benedictus; by
Periclymenum, Woodbinde; by herba Moschata, the first species of Storks-bill;
by Crispulum, wild Camomile, not stinking Camomile, which we call Ox-eye; by
herba Camphorata, Southernwood: the rest are easy.

We do not, with Joubertus, put Feverfew, but Marjoram, in stead of Tamarisk,
as more convenient for the purpose. For its preparation, the roots and herbs
that are gathered in the middle of Spring must be washed, purged, brayed, and
macerated in a sufficient quantity of generous wine in a fit vessel, and then
cocted upon hot ashes, till half the wine be dissipated; then must the Oil be
affunded, and all again cocted, till all the wine be perfectly dissipated; then
removed from the fire, put in a bag, and pressed; then set again on the fire,
and the wax added and melted; then must the Butter, Fats, Marrow, and
Pulverables be usurped, all dissolved, well mixed, and united by agitation;
then removed from the fire, that they may become an Unguent.

It cures the cold affections of the Brain, Nerves and Articles; the trembling
Palsy, Convulsion, and Gout: it conduces to the hard tumors of the Spleen,
and all dolours sprung from crude humors.

to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Seeing this Unguent has its name, not color, from Oranges (for it is white)
it should rather be called, The Unguent of Oranges, then the Citrian Unguent:
but the affinity of the names makes the error small. It is rather of the
number of those that appertain to the Cosmetical and Exornatory Art, then the
Medicinal: for it consists of many things, which erugate and deterge the skin,
emend its prave color, and reduce it to a more laudable state. Many of its
ingredients are enunciated in barbarous words; which, lest by their ambiguity,
or multifarious acceptations, they should deceive the imperite, we shall thus
interpret: By sweet Amiantum or Amentum, we mean scissile Alome, or plumeous,
not cocted Targot, as Manlius suggests; by Sea-navels, Sea-shels, representing
a Man's Navel; by Antalium, a marine Tube of a fingers length, striated without,
of the number of shells; by Dentalium, a small, long, round, white shell,
smooth within, crooked, and acuminated on one side, wherein a certain Sea-worm
lives. Now Antalium and Dentalium being Conchiles, Sea-welks, and Cockles, may
be substituted in their stead.

By Gersa, we understand a certain Ceruse or Foecula, made of the root of the
herb Dragon; or in defect thereof, of the root of Jairy, and Rose Water; which
is thus prepared: The roots of the greater herb Dragon must be collected in the
Spring, washed, purged and dried; then pulverated very small in a Stone-Morter,
and put in an earthen or glass vessel with Rose Water; then covered with a
linen cloth, and dried in the Sun; afterward brayed, madefied with Rose Water,
and dried by insolation, which must be iterated three or four days; then the
powder madefied with odorate wine, coacted into Pastils, dried in a shade,
reposed for use, and usurped for Garsa.

The Unguents preparation is after this manner: The greases must all be melted
together in an earthen pot, wherein two Citrons or Oranges cut into pieces,
must be macerated a whole night; the next morning cocted and percolated; the
Marble, Crystal, Coral, Navels, Antals, and Dentals, must be pulverated very
small, as also the rest, but all of them apart, especially Camphyr, Amylum,
Frankincense, Amiantum, and Boras: but Gersa being friable, may be levigated,
by light motion, on an inverted sieve. When all are duly levigated, they must
be mixed and agitated together with the melted, strained, and hot fats, that
they may concrete to an Unguent. But the quantity of Fats seems too little for
the Powders, which therefore must either be augmented, or they lessened: for
Apothecaries require for one pound of Powders, seven or eight of Fat; but the
Powders may be saved, and when use calls for them, mixed with a sufficient
quantity of Fats.

It represses Pimples arising from bile or salt phlegm in the skin, Vires.
but especially in the face. It exterges Tetters, black and blue places,
deleates foetid scars, takes away the redness of the eyes, and cures cutaneous
affections.

CHAP. 26. Unguentum Spleniticum; or, An Ointment for the Spleen.
Oil of Capers, of Jasmine, of each ix. fresh Butter lb ss. Juice of Bryony,
and Sowbread, of each lb ss. Gum-Ammoniacum dissolved in Vinegar ij. of the
Powder of the bark of Tamarisk, Ashton-keyes, Ceterach, white Willowseed, of
each j. Cumin-seed ij. new Wax, as much as will suffice to body it into an
Unguent.

The COMMENTARY.
Many are infested with the tumor of their Spleen; others with its induration,
without any great tumor; and others with both: all of them have gravity and
gripings in their Hypochondria, tumors in their left sides, difficulty of
breathing, and prave and plumbeous colors, black and turgid veins toward
their Spleens, inflation of feet; and lying on the left side is grievous to
them.

This Unguent adhibited to the regions of their Spleens, after general
Praesidies will much profit; for it is malactical, or mollitive, resolvative,
apertive, roborative, and splenetical; whence it has that name. It should not
therefore be omitted; but seeing its use is salubrious, should be kept in
Pharmacopolies.

For its preparation, let the Oils and Butter boil on a slow fire with the
succes, till the succes be dissipated; then mix dissolved Ammoniack with them,
then the Powders, afterward the Wax, and make an Unguent: whereunto, add some
Oil of Spike, which by its tenuity will cause better permeation for the rest,
and emend the Unguents odor.

Bays, Chamomile, and Worms, of each ij. of Spike j.ss. Aqua-vitae j. yellow
Wax ij. Turpentine washed in the Juice of Enula-campane iij. Powder of

The COMMENTARY.
I wish, that Medicks would speak of the venereous disease and its cure,
without injury to any Nation: For many, ignorant of its original, cause and
nature, refer it to such, from whom they received it, whether justly or
injustly. Hence some call it the Spanish, others the Italian, and others the
French disease. But the French, being men that will not put up an injury,
hearing the disease imposed on them, which they had rightly called the Indian,
or Venereous Pox; they called both the disease and its remedy, Italian, because
the Italians had wronged them first; and sometimes the Indian: for the
Spaniards brought it first out of India into Italy; whence the French, taking
Neapolis, brought home this Neapolitan fruit. But to my purpose. This Indian
Unguent may serve in stead of very many of that name, which are unduly
confected of Swines-fat, and Quicksilver, and sometimes a few simples unduly
united, and kept in many Pharmacopolies; whereby the diseased, in stead of
help, gets the Palsy, Stupour, and Trembling: But this we have described,
consists of many things that hinder such affections, that roborate the Nerves,
extinguish the malign and peccant quality of the humors, and resolve the
humors, propelling many by sputation. Some add Petreol and Euphorbium, which
being exceeding hot and tenuious, may help cold natures; but they much harm the
bilious and temperate. Some also add Mithridate and the Theriack; but we omit
them, as not alexiterial to this disease: but Quicksilver is very efficacious,
if duly prepared, as we have elsewhere demonstrated.

For the preparation of this Unguent, the wax must first be melted on a
moderate fire with the Oils; then Aqua-vitae added to them, which must be
agitated and calefied till the water be exhaled; then incorporate them with
Quicksilver, Fat, and Turpentine; whereunto add the Powders, and subact all
into an Unguent.

That the Quicksilver may be duly prepared, it should first be trajected
through a woollen cloth, that its plumbago may be segregated; then extinguished
with jejune and sound spittle: for being thus tamed, it is fitter for this
confection, then when extinct in the succe of Henbane and Lemmons, though the
Grease and Turpentine take away much of its ferity. Its malign quality may be
very well castigated in the Oil of Turpentine duly prepared.

It cures the flux of the mouth, or the exputation of virulent humors through
the mouth, if after purgation, the parts be twice or thrice anointed therewith.

We have neglected many Unguents described in vulgar Antidotaries, because
their use is either not approved of, or disallowed of, or their faculties
respondent to, and contained in these we have described. For he that has the
Styptical Unguent, or Aregon of Fernelius, needs not the Unguent of Comitissa
and Arthanita.

SECT. II. Of Cerecloths.
AS Cerecloths are in the middle betwixt Unguents and Salves; so we describe
them in the middle. They are called Cerata, because they admit of Wax; as also
Ceronea: which are now made of such solidity, that they differ not from Salves,
but are taken indiscriminately by Surgeons, who call such as repose broken
or disjoynted bones, Ceroneous Salves. But Cerata, in a more angust
acceptance, denote an external Medicament aggregated of Oil, Wax, the parts of
Plants, Animals, Metals, and Minerals, to a middle consistence, betwixt
Unguents and Salves: for they admit of more Wax then Unguents, and less then
Salves. Now the proportion of Wax to Oil in Unguents, is of two dragms and an
half to one ounce; in Cerata, of two dragms and a half to an ounce; in Salves,
twice, thrice, or four times as much Wax as Oil: which proportion varies,
according to the different mixtion of other Ingredients, and the season they
are confected in; for where there is required much of Powders, there must be
more; where little, there less Oil: in Summer also less Oil is requisite, then
in Winter; so that it is in the perite Artists power to change, augment, or
lessen the quantity of Wax and Oil: and as Cerone is used for an Emplaister; so
is Ceratum for an Unguent: for their preparation, commixtion, and spissitude,
are almost one; yea, a Ceratum is sometimes more liquid then an Unguent.

CHAP. 1. Ceratum refrigerans Gal. or, The cooling Cerate of Galen.
of white Wax j. Oil of Roses iiij. melt them together, and pour on a little
coldwater, keeping it continually stirring; at the last, adding Vinegar ss.
make it into a Cerate.

The COMMENTARY.
There is not amongst all compound and euporistical Medicaments, one more
frequent or simple, then this described and celebrated by Galen; which some
call an Unguent, some Ceratum Album, and some Ceratum refrigerans Galeni.

You may thus make it: Divide the wax into pieces, melt it in the Oil of Roses
not perfectly explicated; take it from the fire, and transfuse it into another
vessel; and when it is cold, and moderately concreted, affund cold water upon
it, and agitate it; which iterate, till the mixture will take no more:
whereunto, if you add a little thin white wind Vinegar, it will be more
humectative and refrigerative. Galen advises, when it should be made very
refrigerative, to put the succes of Lettice, Nightshade, Sempervive, and such
refrigerants to it. But this needs not be done, but when the time of use calls
for it, these may be added; for it is better to have it made in the shops after
the most simple form.

It cures Inflammations, S. Anthonies fires, Pimples, Carbuncles, Vires.
red Swellings, and all hot distempers. It also much helps the Feverish, if it
be put upon their Hypochondria.

CHAP. 2. Ceratum Santalinum; or, The Cerate of Sanders. D.Mes.
of Rose-leaves xij. red Sanders x. white and yellow, of each vj.
Bole-armeniack vij. white Wax washed xxx. Ivory vij. Camphyr ij. Oil of Roses
lb j. make into a Cerate.

The COMMENTARY.
The Pharmacopolist that wants Sugar, is not so derisible, as he that wants
this Ceratum; whose continual and happy use, sufficiently nobilitate it. It is
from Wax called Ceratum; from Santals, Santalinum. You may make it thus:

First pulverate all the Santals together; the Roses, Bole-armeniack, Ivory,
and Camphyr apart; then mix the Wax with the Oil, that they may be liquefied on
a slow fire; when they are confusedly melted, and a little cold, wash them
thrice or more in Rosewater; whereunto adject the said powders, yet in such
method, that the Camphyr be last put in; then agitate, subact, and unite all
into the consistence of a Ceratum. We have put crude, not burnt Ivory, for
Spodium: and why we have so done, has been frequently showed.

It allayes the inflammations, exustions, and hot distempers of the Ventricle,
Liver, and other parts, with much efficacy.

CHAP. 3. Ceratum Stomachicum; or, A Cerate for the Stomach taken out of Mes.
Roses, Mastick, of each x. dried Wormwood vij. ss. Spikenard v. Wax ij. Oil of
Roses ix. make it according to Art into a Cerate.

The COMMENTARY.
This Ceratum of Mesue's being more efficacious then those two which Galen
describes, it is more usual and frequent in shops. For its preparation, melt
the Wax and Oil; when cold, wash them often in Rose Water; melt them again, and
wash them in equal portions of the succe of Quinces and of black austere wine,
with a little Vinegar (which may be well omitted.) In the meanwhile, pulverate
the Roses and Wormwood together, Mastick and Spikenard apart; then confusedly
mix all the powders with the wax and Oil duly washed, and subact them into a
legitimate spissitude. Galen, to whom Mesue attributes its description, gives
it otherwise; therefore the invention of the description, or at least of the
better description, is due to Mesue. It it called Stomachical, because it
conduces to that part; for it foments the heat of the stomach, and of the whole
Ventricle, helps concoction, dissipates flatulency, cocts crude humors, moves
appetite, and stays vomiting: but it should and must be extended all over the
region of the stomach, and sometimes the whole Ventricle; for it roborates that
also, and makes it more prompt and apt to perform its office.

CHAP. 4. Ceratum Oesypatum, Gal. tributum, D.Mes.
Oesypi x. Oil of Camomile, Orris, of each lb ss. Wax iiij. Mastick,
Turpentine, of each j. Rosine ss. Spikenard ij. ss. Saffron j. ss. Ammoniacum
j. Storax ss. make it into a Cerate according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue describes three Cerata's, whereof we select this one, attributed to
Galen, as most efficacious and usual: which yet Rondeletius, by the addition of
Ammoniack and Storax, has made more effectual: for thus confected, it performs
those effects which the descriptions of Pilagrius and Paulus pollicitate.
Wherefore he that has this, may be without the others. It is called Oesypatum,
from its Basis Oesypum; which you may thus extract: Take a fit quantity of
wool evelled from the necks, bellies and privities of sheep; macerate it eight
hours in hot water, agitate it all the while with a stick; then servefie it on
the fire, till it depose its fatness into the water: extract, and violently
express the wool; and then transfuse the water from one vessel to another with
much force, that it may eructate much spume; which collect, and repose in a
vessel apart: iterate the transfusion in the hot Sun, till all the fat spume be
collected; which wash, and agitate in pure water, till its filth be segregated,
and the last water remain limpid, and the fatness leave no acrimony on the
tongue; then put it in a dense earthen pot, and keep it in a cold place. It is
emollitive, resolvative, calefactive and anodynous.

The Ceratum you may thus confect: first pulverate the Saffron, Mastick,
Spikenard and Storax apart; then mix their powders together; macerate Ammoniack
in Vinegar, melt it, and coct it to the consistence of Honey; then liquefie the
wax in Oil; take them from the fire, and put therein Oesypum, dissolved
Ammoniack, and Turpentine together, then agitate and subact all the powders
together, that they may acquire due spissitude.

It mollifies, resolves, digests, and allayes dolours; and thence conduces to
the hard tumors of the Liver, Spleen, Uterus, Nerves, Articles, and other
parts.

Authors describe other external Medicaments, under the name of Cerata; which
being of a harder consistence, we shall prosecute in our next Book of Salves.
Mesue describes some softer then these, which are seldom or never made.

THE PREFACE.
BOth the Matter and Virtue of Unguents and Salves are one, their consistence
different; which in the one is soft and liquid, in the other crass and solid:
which are therefore made into Rolls and Bacils of a fingers length and
crassitude, and sometimes much more; and not reposed in vessels like Unguents,
but involved in papers, and so kept in Pharmacopolies. That they may acquire
that crassitude, they admit of more Wax, and less Oil then Unguents; as twice,
thrice, and sometimes four times as much Wax as Oil: which quantity of Wax must
be augmented or lessened, according to the quantity of Rosines and concrete
succes; as also the quantity of Oil, as the dosis of Fats, Grease and Marrow
may ingrede the confection. Now Salves are confected of the parts of Plants and
Animals, of Minerals and Metals; some whereof give only the body and
consistence, without any great virtue, as Wax, common Oil, Quicksilver, and
some Rosines; others with matter, give also virtue and efficacy, as Minerals,
Plants, and the other Ingredients. All Salves do not admit of Wax and Rosines,
but receive Ladanum, Frankincense, and other things for their matter: Some also
are made without Wax and fire, whose materials are Honey, viscid Succes, Cream,
and the like, concreted to a due spissitude; as the Salve of Bread-Crusts and
Bayberries, and the like. This order must be observed in confecting Salves:
first the Wax must be melted in Oil; then the liquors, succes, and Mucagines
mixed therewith, and cocted on a slow fire, till the aqueous humidity be
exhaled; then must the Fats and Rosines be added; as also all kinds of Gummes:
Some whereof are mixed sincere, others diluted, colated, and cocted in Wine,
Vinegar, or other liquor: if Turpentine be required, it may be added when the
Salve is percocted, and abstracted from the fire; then must the hard Powders be
cast and sprinkled, agitated, subacted, and concreted into a mass neither soft
nor hard, but moderate and viscid, which will not inquinate the contractants
hands. If liquid succes, as Wine, Vinegar, Medicinal Waters or Decoctions,
ingrede a Salves confection, they must be cocted till their aqueous humidity be
dissipated. New and spiss Succes must be dissolved in some liquor, which must
also be dissipated by coction; dry and friable ones must be pulverated and
mixed therewith. And as it is of great moment, which must be first put in the
dispensation, and which last: so also, which must be longer, which less cocted.
For the light coction of Lithargie makes the Medicament white; the longer,
black. Verdigrease makes it sometimes citreous, sometimes green, and sometimes
fusk, according to the various heat of the fire: And the mutation of color,
often argues the mutation of qualities; for Lithargie, by longer coction, makes
the Salve both blacker and more exsiccative. And though the consistence and
faculties be the most looked after in Salves; yet their color and odor make
them more commendable. But seeing we have abundantly treated of general
Precepts in confecting Salves, in our Institutions (Chap. 4. Book 3.) it now
only rests, that we discuss the particular preparation and confection of each
of them.

CHAP. 1. Diachylon simplex. D.Mes.
old Oil lb j. Lithargie finely beaten lb j. ss. Our London- Apothecaries
usually add as much water as Oil, to boil it with.
of the musilidge of Marshmallow-roots, Linseed, and Foenugreek, of each iiij.
make it into a Plaster of a legitimate consistency.

The COMMENTARY.
The denomination of this Salve is multifarious: for from the mucagineous
succes, which it admits in great plenty, it is called Diachylon; from its
color, Album; from its usual frequency, Commune; and from the five Simples
that ingrede its Confection, Pentapharmacum; and often, Simple Diachylon, in
reference to another more composititious. The whole Family of Myropolists
acknowledge Mesue its Author, though Serapio and Avicenna gave descriptions
thereof before him: and all exhibit it according to the superior form, wherein
Oil and Lithargie suppeditate matter and corpulency, and Succes efficacy; which
mixed in diverse proportions, and after diverse preparations, make up this
Emplaister. For more dilucidation, prepare it thus: Purge the Lithargie from
its Lead, dross, and filth; then levigate it small, agitate, and subact it
twelve hours in a Metalline-Morter with Oil; then coct it on a slow fire,
always stirring it, till the Lithargie incrassate to a melleous consistence,
and adheres not to the bottom of the Kettle; then take it off the fire, that it
may coo^; then fervefie the succes extracted in water aparr, till their more
aqueous parts be exhaled; then mix about a third part thereof accurately with
the Lithargie, and coct them again, till the Lithargie incrassate as before;
then put the rest to it, and agitate them, letting them fervefie on a slow
fire, till they be all united, and concorporated into a Salve of a legitimate
consistence; and if you put an ounce of the powder of Orris, to each pound of
this Salve, then you have Diachylon Ireatum. It is a sign the Salve is
perfectly cocted, when a part thereof adheres not to a Marble, nor inquinates
the contrectants hands: yet it should be sequacious and viscid, that Rolls may
be formed thereof, involved in paper, and kept.

It is the best Mollitive: for it mollifies the hard tumors, and cocts the
humors of the Liver, Spleen, Ventricle, and other parts: that which admits of
Orris, attracts, incides, and resolves more.

CHAP. 2. Diachylon Magnum. D. Mes.
of Lithargie of Gold finely powdered lb j. Oils of Orris, Dill, and Camomile,
of each lb ss. musilidge of Marshmallow-roots, Figs, Linseed, Foenugreek,
Isinglass, Juyces of Orris, Squills, Oesypi, of each xij. ss. Turpentine iij.
Rosine, Wax, of each ij. make it into a Plaster according to Art.

Diachylon Magnum cum Gummis.

Bdellium, Sagapenum, Ammoniacum, of each ij. dissolve them in wine, and boil
them to the crassitude of Honey; adding the mass of Diachylon Magnum, and make
it into a Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
As the Simple and Ireatum were, so the great and Gummatum Diachylon are
conjoined, and described all in one order, because in name and faculties they
have much affinity. Paul. Aegin. dissents much from Mesue, in the description
and confection of the greater. Oribasius dissents from Paulus; and the usual
method accommodated to Mesue, from both: which we now follow, only neglecting
Raisins; in whose stead we, by Guido's advice, substitute Althea's-root: and
you may thus confect it: Agitate and move Lithargie, already brayed and purged
in a Mortar of Copper with Oil very long; then coct it on a slow fire, always
stirring it, till it incrassate; then add the musilidges, and coct them, till
their watery humidity be absumed; afterward put Fish-glue diluted in the succe
of Orris and Squills, into the confection, and coct them till the succes be
spent: in stead of Alkanach, you may put Alkam, or Bird-lime, which is more
convenient for this Emplaister: The Wax and Rosine must be put into these,
whilst they are on the fire; the Turpentine and Oesypus may be added, when they
are abstracted from the fire: all the mass must be continually agitated, that
its consistence may be idoneous. Some, by industrious sedulity, mix a small
quantity of the Mucagines, at first, with the Oils and Lithargie, that they may
hinder its subsidence to the bottom of the vessel, and make the Salve whiter.

Its faculties effect the same with the former, but more efficaciously: for it
mollifies, cocts, and digests better: The Gummatum Diachylon attracts,
mollifies, and resolves potently.

CHAP. 3. Emplastrum de Mucaginibus, seu Diachylon compositum; or, The Plaster
of Musilidges, or Diachylon compound.
of the Musilidge of the seeds of Marshmallows, Lin, Foenugreek, the middle
bark of Elm, of each iiij. Oil of Camomile, Lillies, and Dill, of each j.
Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Opoponax, Sagapenum, of each ss. new Wax xx. Turpentine
ij. Saffron ij. make it into a Plaster according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Though this Salve be of an uncertain Author, yet all Pharmacopolists make it
after this description which we exhibit from Fernelius its Transcriber: for
whose confection, first extract the Chyles in water; then coct them with Oils
on a slow fire, till their a queous humidity be dissipated; cut the wax into
pieces, and melt it herein, agitating it with a spatle: add the Gummes diluted
first in Vinegar, strained and cocted to the absumption of the Vinegar; then
take them off the fire, and add Turpentine and Saffron to them, still
agitating the mass, till it acquire a due consistence: whereof form Rolls of
half or a whole ounce weight.

It partly mollifies, partly cocts and maturates, and therefore conduces to the
cure of humors preternaturally indurated. It is enumerated amongst the
mollitive and suppurative Salves, and frequent in use.

CHAP. 4. Emplastrum de Meliloto; or, Melilot Plaster. D.Mes.
of Melilot vj. Camomile-flowers, tops of Wormwood, wild Marjoram, Foenugreek,
Bayberries, Marshmallow-roots, of each iij. the seeds of Smallage, Bishopweed,
Cardamomes, Orris, Cypress, Lavender, Cassia-Lignea, of each j. ss. Ammoniacum
x. Storax, Bdellium, of each v. Turpentine j. ss. Figs number. xij. Goats-suet,
Rosine, of each ij. ss. Wax vj. Oil of Marjoram and Spike, of each vj. of the
water of the decoction of Melilot, Camomile, and Foenugreek, as much as
suffices to reduce it to a Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
This Salve consists of many things; which should be artificially prepared
apart, before they accede to its confection: and first of all the roots must be
brayed; secondly the seeds; thirdly the herbs and flowers; and then Cinnamon and
Storax, but apart both; then must all be mixed. Bdellium and Ammoniack must in
the meanwhile be macerated in Vinegar, rather then the decoction of Melilote,
Camomile, and Foenugreek; though the Mucagines or Chyles of the roots of Althea
and Foenugreek, should and ought to be extracted therein: To whose colature,
brayed Figs, macerated in the same decoction, and trajected through a sieve,
should be added; then Turpentine, and at last the Powders: whereinto, when well
subacted, six dragms, or an ounce at most, of the Oil of Marjoram, and as much
of the Oil of Spikenard must be adjected. For Bauderonius, by the addition of
six ounces, makes the Confection an Unguent, not a Salve. If the Figs be dry,
both they and the Bdellium may be pulverated: but it is better to macerate and
strain them. Caraway-seed may be substituted for Cordumenum; not Cardamome, as
many think, because of the affinity of the words.

It mollifies, cocts, and resolves the inveterate hardness of the Liver,
Spleen, Ventricle, and other parts; it laxates the tensions of the
Hypochondria, and discusses flatulence.

Joubertus describes the Triapharmacal Emplaister, amongst the number of the
Mollitives and Resolvatives: but as its composition is simple; so is its
faculty imbecile, and its use rare. Its matter is the same with that of the
crude Unguent, or Unguent of Lithargie; for it consists of Oil, Lithargie and
Vinegar, cocted to an Emplastical consistence.

CHAP. 5. Emplastrum Oxycroceum. D. Myr.
of Saffron, Ship-pitch, clarified Rosine, Wax, of each iij. Turpentine,
Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Myrrh, Frankincense, Mastick, of each j. and iij. make
these into a Plaster according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
Myrepsus invented and instituted this Salve also, for mollifying and digesting
hardness; who gave it a name from Vinegar, wherein its Gummes are macerated and
dissolved; and from Saffron, wherewith it is infected. You may make it after
this manner: Bray Ammoniack and Galbanum a little, macerate them a whole night
in Vinegar, that they may be dissolved; then coct them till the Vinegar be
exhaled; in the meanwhile, melt the wax in a fit vessel; when it is melted,
add Ship-Pitch and Scammony to it; then with these, mix the Gummes duly
liquefied, and take them from the fire; then add Turpentine, then Myrrh,
Frankincense, Saffron and Mastick, all brayed apart; unite them all by
agitation into a fit mass: which inject upon a Marble anointed with Oil of
Mastick, insperged with powder of Saffron, and form Rolls of the accustomed
magnitude: Some diminish the quantity of Saffron, which being done without
loss, may be assented to.

This Salve is mollitive and digestive, allaying the dolours of the nerves and
articles, and helping broken bones.

He needs not make Ceroneum, that has this, because of the great affinity
betwixt their faculties.

CHAP. 6. Emplastrum de Janua; or, The lesser Plaster of Betony. D.P.
of the Juyces of Betony, Smallage, Plantain, of each lb j. yellow Wax, Rosine,
Turpentine, Pitch, of each lb ss. make it into an Emplaister according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
There are two Emplaisters of Betony; one of a lesser description, which
Apothecaries call Emplastrum de Janua; and another of greater composition,
which they call simply, Betonies Salve: which is hitherto frequently made,
because of the excellency of its faculties. Andernacus, they say, is its
Author; but Praepositus invented this de Janua: which, according to his
description, you may thus confect: Melt the Wax, Pitch, and Rosine, in the
succes of Plantain, Betony, and Smallage, strained, but not depurated; then
coct them with a portion of Turpentine, always moving them, that the succes
may be resolved; then add the rest of the Turpentine, and fervefie them all
again, that they may be united into a mass of a fit consistence: whereof form
Rolls for use.

It is maturative and digestive, and by a peculiar faculty, roborates the head,
and cures its Wounds and Ulcers.

CHAP. 7. Emplastrum de Betonica; or, The greater Plaster of Betony. D. Andern.
of green Betony, Pimpinel, Agrimony, Sage, Penyroyal, Cinqfoil, the greater
Comfrey, Garden-Clary, of each vj. Frankincense, Mastick, of each iij. Orris,
round Birthwort, of each vj. white Wax, Turpentine, of each lb ss. Gum-Olei
Aethiopiae.
Gum-Elemni ij. Rosine of the Pinetree vj. Oil of the Firre-tree, white wind,
of each as much as will suffice to make it into a Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
Seeing there are many capital Diseases, which besides the help of Surgeons,
require Topical Medicaments; and few of them only can be helped by the
Emplaister de Janua: Andernacus did well, to describe this of Betony, which is
more efficacious, perfectly curing more preternatural affections of the head.
You may thus prepare it: Contund the herbs well in a Mortar, macerate them a
whole week in white wind, agitate and coct them, express and strain the wine,
and coct it, till the third part be absumed; then put Oil of Fur to it, then
melted wax, afterward Gummes and Rosines, and last of all Turpentine: when
these are pretty cold, add to them the rest that are pulverated or concreted,
always agitating them till the whole humor be exorbed; last of all put
Goats-milk or Cows-milk to them, and make Rolls.

It unites fractures, Vires.
covers bones with flesh, detracts the splinters of bones; and evokes such as
are deeply sunk: it restores lost and hard flesh; it absterges, digests, and
ficcates notably.

CHAP. 8. Emplastrum de Baccis Lauri; or, The Plaster of Bayberries. D.Mes.
of Bayberries ij. Olibanum, Mastich, Myrrh, of each j. Cypress, Costus, of
each ss. Honey despumed, as much as will suffice to make it into an Emplaister.

The COMMENTARY.
Mesue neither adds Oil, nor Wax, nor Fat, to this confection; only an
indefinite quantity of Honey to receive the rest: whose dosis he leaves to the
Artificers judgment; who think, that one and a half, or two ounces, are
sufficient for the comprehension of the powders, which give a legitimate
consistence to this Emplaister, which Mesue describes as most efficacious in
curing the Dropsy, if the quantity of Cypress be triplicitated, and as much
Goats or Cows-dung as the weight of the whole amounts to, added. But it is
better to confect it more simple, or else only to triplicitate the Cypress;
or, when use calls for it, to add the dungs of both or one.

For its confection, pulverate all apart but Honey, and add Cypress and Costus
to the Honey, while hot, despumed, but not cocted: when it is cold, put
Frankincense, Myrrh, and Mastick to it, and make Rolls of it; but because they
will soon dry, some repose them close in earthen pots, and so they keep longer
without damage.

It allayes the dolours of the Ventricle, Intestines, Liver, Reins, Vires.
Uterus, and Bladder, sprung from flatulency, or a cold cause: it conduces to
the dry Hydroptical person, by discussing the more tenuious and flatulent
matter.

CHAP. 9. Emplastrum Tonsoris; or, The Barbers Plaster. D. Aetii.
of dry Pitch lb ij. Wax lb j. Rosine of the Pine Tree lb ss. the flower of
Foenugreek, the flower of the root of the black Chamaeleon-Thistle, of each
iiij. Cumin-seed powdered ij. make it into a Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
Medicks do daily prescribe Medicaments for present use, better then the vulgar
Dispensatories suppeditate; which Pharmacopolists have described and kept,
after they have noted their effects; and thus women keep some Receipts in their
Closets, from which they once found ease: And thus a Bythinian Barber had a
Salve from some of his coaetaneous Medicks, which being often successfully
used, is since always called, The Barbers Salve. Thus also a Weaver of Paris
got a black Unguent, like the vulgar Basilicon, which he exhibited to all
Sores; and when he was dead, his Son made, and gave the like: Insomuch, that
one could scarce live half a week in Paris, but he would see and try the
Weavers Unguent.

And although Medicks often disapprove of such as the ignorant approve of; yet
Aetius much commends this Barbers Salve, for the cure of the Spleen, Dropsy,
and Sciatica: for, says he, it has freed many from the dolor of the Hips;
for it attracts, digests, and resolves watery humors; which it effects more
facilely, if it be confected with Oil of Orris, or some Fat: nay, it can scarce
be made without Fats; therefore I think half a pound of Oil should be adjected.

If Chamaeleons-root cannot be had, an equal weight of the root of vulgar
Bryony, commonly called White-vine, may be added in its stead; especially when
it is required for the cure of the Spleen and Dropsy. But the root of the
other Bryony, which they call The blessed Virgins Seal, is a more convenient
substitute for the cure of the Sciatica, or any arthritical dolor.

Which wild Bryony is a kind of soft Ivy, so delighting in arundincous and
watery places, that it always seeks water-banks; insomuch, that wherever
Botanicks find this Plant, they conclude there is water underneath.

Arnoldus Villonavanus calls it, The Celestial Sigil; and says, that it cures
the Gowry dolours; in these words, The heavenly Sigil will cure Podagry for
ever.

CHAP. 10. Emplastrum Palmeum, seu Diachalciteos.
of old Oil, If water be not added, you may stir till Doomsday before it will
be white.
Lithargie of Gold, of each lb iij. Hogs-suet lb ij. white Vitriol iiij. boil
it upon a gentle fire, continually stirring it with a Spatula, till it comes to
a white Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
Myropolists and Surgeons do rather from Custom then Reason retain this Name
of Diapalma, which was given to this Salve, because it is in cocting, agitated,
moved, and subacted with a rudicle of Palm-wood: some, mutuating its name from
its Basis, call it more rightly, The Emplaister of Diachalcitis; but such as
put a difference betwixt Vitriol and Chalcitis, say, that this is made of
Chalcitis, Diapalma of Vitriol, and in all things the they are alike. However,
many make them not alike: for in the confection of this of Diachalcitis, they
put only three ounces of burnt Chalcitis, injecting into its coction, by
Galen's advice, some branches of the Palm minutely incided: but they make the
palmeous Emplaister after the form prescribed, agitating it always with a
palmeous spatle; and first of all they coct the Lithargie minutely pulverated
on a slow fire, with Oil and Fat, always agitating it with a rudicle of the
Palm, or some other astrictive Tree, as the Oak or Medlar, newly cut from the
Tree. And that the Salve may communicate more of its Medicamental faculty, they
prescind its extremities, and abrade it to the very radical moisture. When the
mixture is cocted and incrassated, they substract it from the fire, and put
Roman or white Vitriol in it; and in defect of the true Chalcitis, inject the
pulverated one, and subact it: and so they have a mass of a just consistence,
whereof they make Rolls. Many would have the Vitriol cocted with the other
Ingredients, that it might depose part of its acrimony: in which there is
reason.

It cures green wounds, pestilent tumors and exitures; as also Ulcers,
Bruises, and divelled parts.

CHAP. 11. Emplastrum gratia Dei; or, A Plaster by the grace of God.
of Rosine lb j. Turpentine lb ss. white Wax iiij. Mastick j. Vervain, Betony,
Pimpinel, of each m. j. after they are bruised, let them be boiled in
white wind; and in the decoction, let the other Simples be boiled, till the
liquor be consumed; and so make it into a Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
This Salve is one of them which is endued with a specious name for
ostentations sake; as that Isotheos Antidotus in Aetius, that Emplastrum Isis
in Paulus, and that other which Aetius mentions, that is called Man, consisting
only of Sandyx and Oil: for by such a name not only Rusticks, but those of
the Citizens, that think themselves wiser, are incited to buy such a
Medicament. We will therefore, with the troop of Aromatories, call this
Medicament Emplastrum de gratia Dei, and confect it thus: We take green herbs
newly gathered, cut them small, bray them well in a stone-Morter, macerate them
a whole day in a sufficient quantity of generous wine; then coct them, till
half the wine be absumed; then we express the herbs, and abject them, breaking
or cutting the wax into the percolated liquor, there to be melted and cocted,
continually agitating it till the liquor be absumed; then we bray, commix, and
melt therein the Rosines; and taking it off the fire, unite the Turpentine
therewith: when it is almost cold, we adject the Mastick, and so we acquire a
Salve of a legitimate consistence.

It purges and closes wounds and Ulcers, Vires.
roborates the parts to which it is adhibited: all which it would do more
efficaciously, if it were made with red wine.

CHAP. 12. Emplastrum Divinum; or, The Divine Plaster.
of the Loadstone iiij. Ammoniacum iij. and ij. Bdellium ij. Galbanum, Myrrh,
of each j. and ij. Olibanum j. j. Opoponax, Mastick, long Birthwort,
Verdigrease, of each j. Lithargie of Gold, common Oil, of each lb ss. new Wax
lb ss. mingle them to a Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
Whilst I read or hear these specious Names, I cannot but think of the
eximious Remedies of the Alchymists, who seeing their Elixir-vitae grow
threadbare, called it The Angelical Potion: but the name is tolerable, where
the faculties are responsible; as in this Emplaister, which being very
efficacious, though not Divine, we shall by authority call Divine.

You may thus confect it: Agitate, move, and stir well-pulverated Lithargie for
twelve hours space with Oil; and always moving it, coct it to the crassitude
of Honey; then cut the wax in pieces, mix it with the Oil, and melt it: in the
mean time, macerate, dissolve, and strain the Gummes in Vinegar, or tenuious
white wind, and coct them till the aqueous humidity be discussed and
evaporated; then mix Turpentine therewith, and inject and incorporate them all
with the Lithargie, united with Oil and Wax: to all these, add the Powders of
Myrrh, Mastick, Frankincense, Aristolochy, and the Magnet brayed apart; then
mix Verdigrease brayed, but not cocted too long, lest it make the Salve red:
These well united, and commixed, will be a Salve of a due spissitude. Some, in
stead of the Powder of Amyentis, take the Powder of sweet Amentum, that is, the
fat of Glass: but it is better confected with the Magnet.

It mollifies the parts whereunto it is adhibited; it allayes dolours,
attracts, digests, and resolves humors.

CHAP. 13. Emplastrum de Cerusa; or, The Plaster of Ceruse.
Oil of Roses lb ij. Ceruse lb j. ss. white Wax iiij. boil them together, and
make them into a Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
The Author indeed of this Emplaister is uncertain; but the description, dosis
of its simples, and the manner of its preparation, are far more uncertain:
for some confect it in form of an Unguent, as Praepositus; others in form of an
Emplaister: to whose composition, some assume Lithargie, Amylum, and the Whites
of Eggs, as Paulus and Myrepsus; others make it of Wax, Ceruse, and Oil: Some
again assume twice as much Oil as Ceruse; others, a like quantity of both: Some
take more Wax, others more Oil. The description we give is most usual, the
confection we teach is most easy, and the composition we approve of most
efficacious; wherein we rather assume two pounds of Oil of Roses and
Omphacinum, then of common Oil, a pound and an half of Ceruse, and only four
ounces of Wax. Now before Ceruse ingrede the confection, it should be often
washed in common or Rose Water, then agitated in a Marble-Morter with a
ligneous Pestel; then it should reside; and when it is settled, the water be
effused, and more again affunded, with which it must be agitated; which must be
iterated, till the water appear pure and limpid; which then may be ejected, and
Trochisks formed out of the remaining white Ceruse, which must be dried in the
Sun, and reposed for use: whereof the described quantity must be taken, and
levigated very small, for the confection of this Salve: But after levigation,
it must be first cocted in the radiant Sun over a slow fire, and agitated
continually with a spatle; then must the wax be melted, and stirred with it,
that all may acquire a due spissitude.

It is of much use, not only in drying cutaneous vices, and superficial
Exulcerations, but also in coagulating greater Ulcers, allaying Inflammations,
and curing Clefts and Kins: it also heals burnings.

CHAP. 14. Emplastrum pro Stomacho; or, A Plaster for the stomach.
of Wormwood, Mint, Marjoram, Roses, Pomegranate-flowers, Cypress-Nuts, of each
iij. Ginger, Nutmegs, Cloves, the seeds of Dill and Carret, of each ij.
Benzoin, Storax, of each ss. Oil of Mastick and Quinces, of each iij. yellow
Wax lb ss. make it into a Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
What Medicaments soever are extrinsecally imposed upon the stomach, they are
too licentiously called by Asclepiades and Andromachus, Malagms; Galen calls
them better, Stomachicals, because they roborate the stomach, as those they
call Splenicals do the Spleen; for they mutuate their names from the places
whereunto they agree most, not from such as they may by consequence profit:
whence they are well called Stomachical Emplaisters, which roborate the
stomach, and resarciate its imbeciler faculties; as also many Simples, which
recreate it by calefaction, and from a certain affinity respect its help; of
which we have selected some, and concinnated this Emplaister: for we do not
approve of that Chaos of Simples, whereof vulgar Stomachicals are confected;
wherein the Pharmacopoean Apothecary undergoes much of labor, cost, and
unnecessary burden. This Emplaister then shall consist of fewer, but more
Eustomachical Ingredients: for whose confection, first melt and agitate the Wax
with Oil; then mix together brayed Storax and Benzoin, and then the rest duly
levigated, moving and subacting all into a legitimate crassitude.

CHAP. 15. Emplaistrum de Mastiche; or, The Plaster of Mastick.
of Mastick iij. Bole-armeniack washed in black Wine j. ss. Roses vj. shavings
of Ivory, Red Coral, of each ss. Turpentine ij. yellow Wax lb ss. Oil of
Myrtle-berries iij. or as much as suffices to make it into a Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
This Emplastick is also Stomachical, but not so hot as the former: for seeing
all imbecility of stomach arises not from cold causes; as subsersion, which
frequently happens without a cold distemper; and proneness to vomit, which
follows upon any distemper, without vicious humors, it is not equal that its
roborative Medicament should be always hot; but Reason commands, that it
should be varied and changed, according to the variety of the peccant cause:
for it is impossible to find out a Medicament that is best for all affections,
but it will more efficaciously help one, and another more imbecilely; and it
often falls out, that a hot Emplaister may profit the stomach, and offend the
hot Liver. Hence the Proverb: Stomachicum juvat, and occidit Hepaticum. This
Emplaister then may safely be adhibited to the hotter imbecile Ventricle: For
whose preparation, all must be pulverated and brayed apart; then the wax must
be melted with the Oil, and the Turpentine added when it is subtracted from
the fire; then must Bole, Ivory, Roses and Coral, after just levigation, be
commixed therewith; then must all be accurately subacted with the Mastick into
a just crassitude.

It roborates the whole Ventricle, contemperates its heat, cohibits supinity,
and subversion, stays vomiting, and removes imbecility.

CHAP. 16. Emplastrum pro Matrice; or, A Plaster for the Fits of the Mother.
D. Praep.
of Bistort-roots lb ss. Aloes-wood, sweet smelling Sanders, Nutmegs,
Berberries, Rose-seeds, of each ss. Cinnamon, Cloves, Squinant,
Camomile-flowers, of each ij. Frankincense, Mastick, Aliptae Moschatae, Galliae
Moschatae, red Storax, of each ss. Mosch gr. v. yellow Wax ix. Turpentine iij.
Ladanum lb ij. Ship-pitch lb j. ss. Oil of the Musk-wood, Crowfoot ij. make it
into a Plaster according to Art.

The COMMENTARY.
The Matrix or Uterus does not only abound with Diseases, but is the very
Spring and Continent of most Muliebral Affections: for when that suffers, the
whole Body is ill-affected; when that is recreated, the whole Body recruits.
And hence Medicks have prescribed many Medicaments for its solace, as
Priapiscota, Fomentations, little Baths, Liniments, Unguents, and Salves,
wherein suaveolent and aromatical Ingredients are admitted; with whose
fragrancy, whether interiously immitted, or exteriously adhibited, it is much
delighted, though not under species of odor, as we have noted in our
Institutions. Its most usual Topical Medicament is this Emplaister, thence
denominated: for whose confection, you must take wax and Ladanum cut into
pieces, and melt and agitate them with Oil: when they are thus melted, remove
them from the fire; and while they are hot, put Turpentine and Storax to them:
when these are thus untied and refrigerated, mix the rest of the powders with
them, always agitating and subacting them, till they acquire due spissitude.
Praepositus adds neither Fat nor Oil: but it cannot be well made without the
one of these; we have therefore adjoined Moschatelline Oil, as most convenient
for the scope and part. We may hence gather, how inept a Writer Praepositus
was, who speaks so barbarously; and how imperite a Pharmacopoean, who knows not
the legitimate Composition, nor the manner of due preparation, nor the idoneous
consistence of Medicaments. I admire that this later Age will tolerate the Name
of so foolish an Author, and precipitantly evolve his leaves, and not expunge
each line for folly. But this by the way: I will not carp at the dead; Though
such dead men bite those that receive their perilous Medicaments. But to my
purpose. Some think, that the Oil of Jeat, or some such foetid stuff, should be
adjected hereto, that it may better agree to the strangulation of the Uterus:
but such ratiocination smells of no skill; for no imposition of foetid
Medicaments to the region of the Uterus, can hinder its suffocation. But such
must be adhibited to the Nostrils, if they be taken for benefit. And though we
should grant, that some graveolents might profit the Uterus, yet they should
not surely be mixed with Musk, Citrian Santal, and such aromatical Materials.
Here note, That by Antera, we understand the inferior part of Roses,
accompanied with capillaments and grains; not Anthera, that is, florid, which
was an ancient Medicament described for the vices of the mouth, but now
obsolete.

CHAP. 17. Emplastrum Herniam; or, A Plaster against Rupture. D. N. Praep.
Ship-pitch, Aloes, of each iij. Lithargie, white Wax, clarified Rosine,
Galbanum, Ammoniacum, of each ij. Missletoe of the Oak vj. long and round
Birthwort, A species of Talkum.
Gypsum, of each iiij. Myrrh, Frankincense, of each vj. Turpentine ij.

Earthworms, Galls, the greater and lesser Comfrey, Bole-armeniack, of each
iiij. Man's Blood lb j. Oil of Mastick and Quinces, of each lb ss. of the Broth
of the skin of a Ram, as much as will suffice to body it into a Plaster.

The COMMENTARY.
It is easy to know those Medicaments which Praepositus transcribed, from
those he described and invented: for those he invented are either defective or
excessive; or peccant in the dosis of the Simples, or in the manner of their
preparation; or else ineptly described, as this very Emplaister, which, if made
after the Authors mind, would in consistence resemble a hard Paste, no Salve;
for it would be presently dry, hard, and pulverable: therefore I thought good
to add some Oils, with other Simples accommodated to the scope, and convenient
for the colligation of the Powders.

That you may duly confect it, cut the skin of a young Ram newly detracted,
into pieces, and coct it, and the wool on it, twelve hours, or a whole day, if
need be, that it may dissolve; then express the decoction, and abject the
wool; in one pound of the colature, coct the berries of the Missletoe of the
Oak, or of some other tree, of like quantity, till their aqueous humidity be
absumed; then strain them: in the mean while, wash Earthworms in wine, cocting
them, till they be dissolved, and then strain them; mix Oil with the colature,
and set it again on the fire, till its watery humor be discussed; then mix the
two colatures together, and therein melt the Wax, Colophony, and Pitch, exactly
agitating them, that they burn not; mix Galbanum and Ammoniack, which must
first be dissolved, strained, and cocted to a melleous spissitude, with the
liquor almost consumed by cocture: substract all from the fire, and put
Turpentine to them; and then add the powders artificially levigated: and all
these duly prepared, mixed, united and subacted, will be an Emplaister of a
legitimate consistence.

In defect of the berries of the Missletoe of the Oak, Joubertus substitutes a
Succedanium, adding many more astrictives, that the Salve may be more
agglutinative. Arnaldus foolishly postulates the blood of a red Man; as though
the blood of another sound and sanguineous Man were not better: but Swines
blood is all out as convenient. Praepositus requires red wax, that is, new wax,
which is so flave, that it seems subrubeous; but white wax is more accommodate.
He would also have the Marble whereon the mass is injected, madefied with Oil
of Violets: we choose the Oil of Mastick for that purpose.

It most efficaciously constringes and roborates lax parts, cohibits fluxions:
it coarctates the dilatation of the Peritonaeum, through which the Intestines
delabe: whence it cures bursting, and is by some Pharmacopolists called the
Emplaister for bursting; and by others, The Emplaister of the Rams-skin.

The COMMENTARY.
As the parts of the Body are dissimilar in form, temper, and actions: so must
their Medicaments, whereby each part is conserved or cured, be dissimilar; for
the Eyes call for one, the Lungs another, the Uterus another, and the Bones
another: yea, the same part often requires diverse Medicaments, according to the
diversity of the affection wherewith it is pestered. For those Medicaments that
conduce to the rottenness and wormeatenness of the Bones, are not used in their
Fractures: for the curing whereof, most Surgeons perperously adhibit only
astrictives; some exhibiting only Oxycroceum; others, Emplastrum de pelle
Arietina, or Contra Rupturam; others, The vulgar Ceroneum: whence, perhaps, the
Nomenclature of that Emplaister is decocted, which is so much celebrated at
Paris, which they give indiscriminately to all that crave help, and adhibit
promiscuously to all diseases and parts. And hence many, by the occlusion of
their passages, and retention of their excrementitious humors, are laden with
dolours, infested with the Itch, or beset with Ulcers.

Apothecaries therefore should have peculiar skull-Plaisters, which may not be
only astrictive and roborative, but withal conservative, accelerating
generation and increase; as this we now exhibit, whose preparation we shall a
little open for Apprentices sakes: First then the roots must be cleansed, and
cut into pieces; the herbs cut small, and cocted in an equal portion of black
wine, and steel-water, till half thereof be dissipated; the succes must be
injected into the strained liquor, and boiled there, till the aqueous humidity
be exhaled; then must the Oils be commixed, afterward the Wax, and then the
Lithargie: when they are taken off the fire, percolated, and united by
agitation, the Turpentine must be added, and then the Powders; and all must be
well mixed, agitated, and subacted, that they may make up an Emplaister of a
due consistence.

If Tutsan cannot be had, the seed or summities of S. John's Wort may be
substituted in its stead. By Virgins-wax, we mean that which is flave, citrian,
and newly segregated from the Honey, which is more apt and useful in roborating
the Nerves.

This Salve has an excellent faculty in curing the fractures of Bones: for it
helps and accelerates their coalition, when they are coagulated, increases
their brawniness, foments the innate calour of the part, and stays the
fluxions of humors.

I could wish all Surgeons to make this Emplaister, and not to suffer some
ignorant fellows so freely; who with one Ceroneum (as they call it) unduly
prepared (it is probable) promise the cure of all Sores.

CHAP. 19. Emplastrum Vigonium de Ranis; or, Vigo 's Salve of Frogs.
Oil of Camomile, Dill, Spike, and of Lillies, of each ij. Oil of Bays j. Oil
of Saffron j. Calves fat lb ss. Euphorbium v. Frankincense x. Vipers fat ij.
ss. Living Frogs number. vj. Worms washed in Wine iiij. ss. the Juyces of the
roots of Dwarf-elder and Enula-campane, of each ij. Squinant, Stotchas,

of the Wine: and to the Colature add Lithargie lb j. clear Turpentine ij.
White or yellow Wax, as much as will suffice, Liquid Storax j. ss. after it is
removed from the fire, add iiij. of Quicksilver killed with fasting spittle,
stirring it with a Spatula.

The COMMENTARY.
As India, by the institution of Nature, first produced both the Venereous Pox
and its Remedy: so Italy, which first infected Europe with this Disease,
refects the same with the best Medicament: for Joannes de Vigo, an Italian,
consulting his own (it may be) and Countries good, composed this Emplaister, of
eximious virtue, for the cure of the Italian, which they ineptly call the
French disease: whose description is good, though the manner of preparation
which he prescribes, be ill enough; for he would have all confusedly cocted
together, till he come at Lithargie. But Neotericks do thus better instruct.

First wash the Earthworms in wine, and coct them and living great Water-frogs
together, in the Fats of a Swine and a Calf, and wine, till the third part of
the wine be absumed; then add Motherwort, Stoechados, and Schoenantum; and
then boil them again, till the wine be exhaled; and then add the succes and
Oils, and a little after, the Fat of a Viper, or, for want thereof, of a Snake;
then coct them, till the aqueous humor be absumed; and afterward express them
strongly: in the Colature, coct the Lithargie duly levigated, agitating and
stirring it into the form of an Unguent; then add the wax, and melt it; then
take it off the fire, and conject brayed Frankincense and Euphorbium into it;
afterward Turpentine and Storax: when you have duly mixed, agitated, united,
and refrigerated these, traject the Quicksilver through a dense cloth, after
its extinction by jejune spittle, and mix it with the rest: which subact and
reduce into the idoneous form of an Emplaister, whereof form Rolls for use.

This is the best form for the composition of this Emplaister, which the most
Apothecaries follow; some whereof duplicate, others triplicate the quantity of
Quicksilver, that the Medicament may be more efficacious in expugning the
Indian Pox. Some like not its extinction by jejune spittle, but had rather have
it done with a little Turpentine, or Hog's Grease; and it may indeed be very
well extinguished by any of these ways: but I had rather have it done with
Sage; for the Quicksilver so castigated will not hurt the Nerves.

Some desire to know what Oil they must take, of the many varieties of them of
Spike: I answer, That Vigo means that Oil which is educed by distillation from
the greater latifolious Lavandula, and not the other that is educed by infusion
out of the Indian Spike, which the same Author, and Mesue, always call Oil of
Spikenard, calling the other Oil of Spike simply.

Neither do all consent about Frogs: for some say Water-frogs, others
Wood-frogs, and others Palustrian-frogs: I always prefer the Water-frogs
before the other, which are often venenate; but any, in defect thereof, may
well enough supply the place: and any one may at liberty choose these or the
other, seeing they all agree equally almost to this external Medicament.

The faculties of this Medicament, which some make in form of a Ceratum or an
Unguent, are well known, not only to Medicks and Surgeons, but all such as
have been harmed by Venery.

CHAP. 20. Tela Galteri; commonly called Saradrap.
Oil of Roses lb ss. Rams fat iiij. Wax x. Lithargie, Rosine of the Pine Tree,
Frankincense, Mastick, of each ij. Bole-armeniack, Volatile flower, of each j.
make it into an Emplaister according to Art; and while it is hot, immerge a
cloth, that it may be salved.

The COMMENTARY.
To the number of Emplaisters, they refer a certain cloth Emplastical on both
sides, which Neotericks call Sparadrappa; whereof there are as many sorts, as a
Cloth may be infected with Salves: for some are vulnerary, others catagmatical;
the one used in agglutinating wounds, the other bones: but no diseases call for
Sparadraps so frequently, as inveterate Ulcers, and holes left by Pyroticks;
whereunto this we have described is most useful. For whose confection, first
melt the fat and wax with Oil, mix the brayed Lithargie with the liquament;
wherein, agitate, stir, and coct it: afterward, add the other Powders,
always stirring, mixing, and uniting them into a legitimate Emplaister;
wherein, a cloth somewhat worn must be demerged, and incalcated while it is
hot, till it be all over infected, inquinated, and incrustated: which then
extract, expose to the air that it may dry, and repose for use.

This Cloth is partly Sarcotical, partly Collective and Epulotical; that is, it
generates flesh, agglutinates, siccates, and heals wounds and Ulcers: it stays
fluxions, and roborates the parts whereunto it is adhibited.

He that would have more descriptions of Sparadrappes, may read the last
Chapter of the second Section of our fifth Book of Institutions.

There may as many Sparadrappes be made by Art, as Emplaisters.

We have omitted some few Salves; as such as we could either not approve of, or
disallow of; or else such as were more then supplied in those we have
described. For the use of the Salves of Barbary and Diaphoenician, is quite
decayed; the Apostolical Salve is seldom made; and he that has the Divinum,
may well be without it; as he that has Oxycroecum, without Ceroneum. We have
given the best and most useful, not only of Salves, but also of other
Medicaments, for internal assumption, and external adhibition: All which, if an
Apothecary will make, and keep in his Shop, he shall not want any thing for the
expugnation of Diseases.

AN APPENDIX.
Of some Medicinal Waters made by Art.
BEsides simple distilled Waters, some others are kept in Pharmacopolies, more
compositious, whose use is commendable in many things; and that not only in
external adhibitions, but internal assumptions; also to correct distempers,
roborate the parts, and erect the faculties: Of which sort, these are the most
usual and eximious; which, lest any thing necessary should be wanting, we have
here subjoyned, beginning with such as are introsumed.

Aqua Theriacalis; or, A Theriacal Water.
of the roots of Enula-campane, Tormentil, Angelica, Masterwort, of each j.
Cypress, Orris, of each vj. Setwel, the Pills of Citron, and Orange, Cinnamon,
Cloves, the seeds of Carduus, Ivy-berries, and Juniper, of each ss. Dittany,
Scordium, Balm, Marigolds, of each m. ss. Macerate them a whole day upon hot
embers in a vessel well covered, with lb vj. of white wind; the next day add
of the decoction of Goats-beard, Betony, and Water Lillies lb ij. afterward
boil them a little upon a gentle fire: In which dissolve Treacle iiij.
afterward put them into an Alembick, and distill it in a Bath.

There is no Theriacal and Alexiterial Water better, Vires.
or more efficacious, then this; for it does not only recreate the faculties,
but oppugn and extinguish all pestilent and venenate qualities. It cures the
Syncope, Palpitation, Swounding, Vertigo, Lethargy, Epilepsie, Apoplexy, and
Palsy.

Aqua Theriacalis alia; or, Another Theriacal Water, more easy to make.
of the roots of Enula-campane, Angelica, of each iiij. Carduusseed, Cloves,
Juniper Berries, of each j. Scordium, Vipers Bugloss, Goatheard, Marjoram,
Balm, Betony, of each m.j. boil them in water to lb iiij. in which, infuse for
a whole day and half Mithridate and Treacle, of each ij. put them into an
Alembick, and distill of the water according to Art.

Its faculties are affine to, but more imbecile then those of the former: not
only Pharmacopolists, but also any one may make it; for it consists but of a
few things, and they easily compassable.

Aqua Cinamomi; or, Cinamon-Water.
of the best Cinnamon bruised lb ss. of the best Rose Water, and generous
white wind, of each lb j. mingle them, letting them stand in a fit vessel for
two days well covered; afterward distilled off according to Art, and let the
Water be preserved.

All do not consent about the proportion of Cinnamon to Wine and Rose Water; for
some put twice as much wine, and four times as much Rose Water as Cinnamon;
others put water and wine in equal quantity: wherein they macerate Cinnamon, and
distill the whole; which is the most usual and best way.

This water accelerates Birth, expels Secunds, moves fluors, recreates the
faculties, and discusses flatulency.

Aqua vulgo Clareta dicitur; or, The Water commonly called, A Claret.
of Mace, Cloves, Cinnamon, of each j. Galangal ss. Cardamomes, Squinant, of
each ij. Ginger ss. infuse them in Aquavitae lb j. in a Bath for 24 hours, the
waters of Wormwood and Roses, of each lb ss. Sugar viij. let them be trajected
three or four times through Hippocrates his Sleeve, and make thereof a Claret,
which keep in a fit Bottle.

It roborates the stomach, helps coction, discusses flatulency, corrects the
cold distemper of the nutritive parts, restitutes the hearts strength, and
erects the faculties.

Claretc alia; or, Another Claret.
of the roots of both Pyonies, Missletoe, of each ij. the wood of Bays, and
Lentisk, of each ss. the flowers of Betony, Sage, and Rosemary, of each p. ij.
macerate them a whole day in lb j. ss. of whitewine, and lb ss. of Balm-water,
and afterward distilled; and in the distilledwater, macerate Cinnamon j.
Sugar Candy v. which strain and keep.

This does most admirably help for the cure of the Epilepsie, Lethargy,
Palsy, Apoplexy, and other cold affections of the Brain and Nerves.

Clareta alia; or, Yet another Claret.
of the Waters of Balm and Coltsfoot, Put the sugar in a bladder, and hang the
bladder in water, and it will dissolve it.
of each lb ss. infuse therein a whole night Enula-campane ij. Orris j. Cinnamon
iiij. make an expression, and filtrate it, adding dissolved or liquid
Sugar Candy iij. which after a little insolation, put up.

It has an excellent faculty in curing difficulty of breathing, coughs from a
cold cause, and (...); for it incides, attenuates, cocts, and moves spittle.

The ardent Syrup is made of Sugar diluted in Aqua-vitae accended: for after
its conflagration, the liquor that is left is oleous, and of the spissitude of
a Syrup.

Clareta vulgaris; or The vulgar Claret.
of the best Aqua-vitae lb ss. of red Rose Water iiij. Sugar iij. Cinnamon j.
traject them three or four times through Hippocrates his Sleeve, and make
thereof a Claret.

This Claret is most grateful, recreating the heart and principal parts,
fomenting innate calour, and discussing flatulency.

Aqua contra Calculum; or, A Water against the Stone.
of the roots of Smallage, Restharrow, Sea-holly, Radish cut in slices, of each
ij. Bean-cods iij. all the Saxifrages, Sea-Rattlegrass, Pimpinel, Bishopweed,
tops of Marshmallows, of each m. ij. Wintercherries, Red Cicers, the seed of
Grumwel, of each ij. Citrons cut orbicularly number. iij. macerate them a whole
day in a sufficient quantity of white wind; afterward distill it, and put to
the distilled water, a little Oil of Vitriol, to make it more acid to the gust.

This water is eximious in breaking and expelling the Stone, moving Urine and
Fluors, accelerating Birth, attenuating viscid humors, and removing
obstructions: two spoonfuls, or thereabouts, according to the age and strength
of the assument, should be taken in the morning fasting, or long after meat.

Aqua ad Gonorrheam; or, A Water for the flux of Sperm.
of Bears-breech, Garden-dock cut small, tops of Marshmallows, of each m.ij.
the flowers of Water Lillies m.i j. Linseed, Hawthornseed, of each j. ss. the
four greater cool seeds, of each j. macerated a whole day in Asses or Heifers
Milk, afterward distilled in a Bath.

It leniates, takes away acrimony, purges the Reins, Ureters, and Seminaries
from filth, and emends their distempers.

Of Topical Waters, or such as are externally adhibited.
Aqua Ophthalmica; or, A Water for the Eyes.
of the Juyces of Salendine, Fennel, Rue, Smallage, and Clary, of of each lb
ss. Honey iij. Goats-Gall j. the Galls of Cocks and Capons, of each ss. Alees
vj. Cloves, Nutmegs Sarcocolla, of each ij. put them into an Alembick, and
distill of the Water according to Art.

This cures many ocular affections; as hebetude, dullness, and debility of fight.

Aqua Communitatis; or, The Water of Community.
Eyebright m.ij. Salendine, Vervine, Betony, Groundpine, Dill, tops of Clary,
Redflowered.
Pimpinel, Bishopsweed, Avens, of each m.j. Rosemary m.ss. Long-Pepper ij.
Macerate them in white wind for a whole day, and then distill of the Water.

It is called the Water of Community, because it is common, and should not be
wanting in any house. It cures imbecility of sight, deterges the eyes from
filth, takes away spots or Pearls, cures Ulcers, hinders suffusion of blood,
augments the clarity of the eye, and roborates it.

Aqua ad Epiphoram, and oculorum ruborem; or, A Water for the dropping and
redness of the Eyes.
White Wind, Rose Water, of each lb ss. Tutty prepared j. Powder of Mace ss.
Let these be mingled in a Vial well stopped, and insolated for three weeks.

It deleates the redness of the eyes, exsiccates tears, roborates the Tunicles,
and cures its Ulcers.

Aqua Calcis; or, Water of Lime.
THe Water wherein Chalk or Lime has been often extinguished, is thence called
Aqua Calcis: it is very eximious in curing many Cankerous and Dysepulotical
Ulcers; which seeing it may easily be made at any time, needs no farther
description.

Aqua Fortis.
AQua Fortis appertains rather to Goldsmiths then Apothecaries; which they use
in separating Silver from Gold; and thence called, The Separatory Water; in
French, Eau de depart: for it melts the Silver, and moves not the Gold. Now
that same which they have once used, and that has admitted of a portion of
water, or is become ignave, and of an azure color, is commonly called Aqua
secunda; which all Surgeons keep for the Praesidy of such as have got the
Plague of Venery.

It is made of Vitriol and Saltpeter, included and closely shut in a Mortar, or
other fit vessel well bedawbed; into which, Spirits are forced by the fire.

Another sort is made of Auripigment, Salnitre, the flour of Brass, and
Rock-Alome, which I leave to such as use it.

De Aquis Comptoriis, seu Fucatoriis; or, Of Comptory or Ornatory Waters.
I Cannot think that pulchritude or deformity of Body, conduce any thing to the
probity or improbity of manners: for many more deformed then Thersites, have
been famous; and many more beautiful then Adonis, infamous. I have also known
many deformed women, impious to purpose: But I purpose not to exhibit Paints to
these, nor Comptory Waters to toothless old Hags, to erugate or emend their
Faces; herein following the prudence of Galen, though a Pagan, who disallows of
not only the Painting of Faces, but the Tinctures of Hair; professing, that he
never exhibited any thing of that nature, to such as took more delight in
Ornaments then Health.

Our Antidotary then shall want these nefarious Medicaments, wherewith Harlots
incite and deceive Youngsters: for this Fucatory Art, we see, is exercised by
none but some Juglers, and vafrous Knaves, who seeking secretly to pick a
Whores Purse, promise her Oil of Talkum, which they never saw, wherewith she
may not only erugate her Face, but restore her self to Youth again; and then
exhibit two Unguents, the one Red, and the other White, both Spanish, and
participating of a malign quality. For that which they call album Hispanum,
admits Sublimatum in its confecture: which though it consists of equal parts of
Quicksilver, Vitriol, and common Salt, rather then of Amoniack; which are not
lethal apart in themselves, but are duly mixed in a Glass sublimatory vessel,
whereunto fire is added gradually for the space of twelve hours: They make a
Powder so caustical and deletery, as can scarce be cicurated by any art. And
hence it is, that women who use these Sublimata's, have black Teeth wormeaten,
corrugated Faces, and praevious old Age. The Color therefore which Nature's
Pencil draws is best: whose Works, whilst we admire, let us give Eternal Glory
and Praise to the Creator.

A PHYSICAL DICTIONARY. OR, An Interpretation of such crabbed Words and Terms
of Art, as are derived from the Greek or Latin, and used in Physic, Anatomy,
Surgery, and Chemistry. With a Definition of most Diseases incident to the
Body of Man: And a Description of the Marks and Characters used by Doctors in
their Receipts.

Published for the more perfect understanding OF MR. TOMLINSON'S Translation of
Rhaenodaeus Dispensatory And whatever other Books of Physic and Surgery are
extant in the English tongue.

This Dictionary will be as useful and sufficient to all our late English
Practitioners in Physic, or Surgery (especially such as are not Scholars)
as any Dictionary of Ten Shillings price.

Approved by several Doctors, Surgeons, and Apothecaries; and Recommended by
them in an Epistle to all English Practitioners in Physic and Chirurgerie.

To all English PRACTITIONERS IN PHYSIC, ANATOMY, SURGERY, And CHEMISTRY.

HOw great the necessity is, of having a PHYSICAL DICTIONARY for Explaining
hard Words and terms of Art in the Medicinal Sciences of Physic, Chyrurgery,
and Chemistry; such as are versed in the understanding th^se most useful,
mysterious and noble Arts, d^ very will know* It is intended for such Persons
as spend their time and employment in studying Physic, and are acquainted with
no other than their Mother tongue; yet, many times more readily Cure a Disease,
by their observant, diligent, and strict keeping to an approved Medicine, than
many others, that trust wholly to their Art: Therefore, for the help of
charitable and honest-meaning People, this Dictionary was Compiled, which has
in is as much as is necessary for understanding hard Words in the forementioned
Arts, being freed from that troublesome and superfluous Number of unnecessary
Words, which serve for nothing but to swell up the Bulk and Price of Books.

And thus much we have thought fit (English Reader) to say unto thee in
Commendation of this best of Physical Dictionaries.

THE STATIONER TO HIS COVNTRY-MEN.
Kind Countrymen,
THe Explaining the Art of Physic, having found so welcome Entertainment, I
hope for the like friendly Acceptance amongst you, having preserved this
Dictionary for your Good, which others would have deprived you of, wherein such
difficult Terms as are derived from the Greek or Latin, and dark to the English
Reader, are made English; and such Marks and Characters as are used by
Physicians and Apothecaries in their Receipts explained; and for your ease and
better understanding, put down the signification of their Weights and Measures
according to their Characters: with a definition of most Diseases incident to
the Body of man. And whereas there are many Words in Mr. Tomlinson's
Translation of Rhaenodaeus Dispensatory, not understood by any ordinary
Scholars (much less such as are not) I have caused them to be Explained by Able
Persons, well Acquainted with the Practice of Physic, so that the meanest
Capacity, by making use thereof, may rightly understand whatever Difficult
Expressions he shall meet withal in the said Dispensatory.

Your Friend, and Servant, JOHN GARFIELD.
