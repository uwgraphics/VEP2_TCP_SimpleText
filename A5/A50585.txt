Memorable Song on the unhappie Hunting in Chevie-Chase, between Earl Piercie
of England, and Earl Douglas of Scotland.
To the Tune of, Flying Fame.
God prosper long our Noble King,
our lives and safeties all,
A waful Hunting once there did
in Chevie-Chase befall:
To dr^ve the Deer with hound and horn,
Earl Piercy took his way,
The child may rue that is unborn
the hunting on that day.
The stout Earl of Northumberland,
(...) vow t^ ^od did make,
His pleasure in the Scottish woods,
three Summers days to take:
The chiefest Hearts in Chevie-Chase,
to kill and bear away,
These tidings to Earl Douglas came
in Scotland where he lay.
Who sent Earl Piercy persent word,
he would prevent his sport,
The English Earl not fearing this,
did to the woods resort,
With fifteen hundred Bow-men bold,
^ll chosen men of might,
Who knew full well in time of war,
to aim their Shafts aright.
The gallant Greyhound swiftly ran,
(...) chase the Fallow Dear,
(...) Monday they began to hunt
(...) d^y l^g^^ ^id appear.
^^d long before high-noone they had
^n h^^dred f^t Bucks slain*
(...) having dined* the Drovers went
^owze them up again.
(...) ^ow-men mustred on the Hills,
^^ll able to endure,
^^^ir back sides all with special care
(...) day were guarded sure:
(...) Hounds ran swiftly through the woods
^^e nimble Dear to take
with their cries the hills and dales
(...) ^cho shrill did make.
(...) ^^erc^ to the Quarry went,
(...) ^iew the tender Dare,
^^oth he, Earl Dow^l^s promised
(...) ^ay to meet me here
(...) if I thought he would not come,
(...) ^o^ger would I stay
(...) ^^at a brave young Gentleman
(...) ^o the Earl did say:
(...) ^^^der does Earl Douglas come,
(...) ^en in Armor bright,
(...) ^^^nty hundred Scottish Spears
(...) ^g in our sight;
(...) ^^n of Tevidale*
(...) ^iuer Tweed,
Then cease your sport Earl Piercy said,
and take your Bows with speed.
And now with me my Contrymen
your courage forth advance
For never was there, Champion yet
in Scotland or in France
That ever did on horseback come,
but if my hap it were,
I durst encounter man for man,
with him to break a Spear.
Earl Douglas on a Milk white Steed,
most like a Baron bold,
Rode foremost of the company,
whose Armor shone like gold:
Show me (said he) whose me ye be,
that hunt so boldly here,
That without my consent do chase,
and kill my Fallow Dear;
The man that first did answer make,
was Noble Piercy he,
Who said, we list not to declare,
nor show whose men we be:
Yet we will sp^nd our dearest blood,
thy chefest Hearts to slay,
Then Douglas swore a solemn oath,
and thus in rage did say:
Ere thus I will out-braved be,
one of us ^wo ^^^l dye,
I know thee well, (...) th^^ art,
Lord Piercy, so am I;
But trust me Piercy pity it were,
and great offense to kill
Any of these our harmless men,
for they have done no ill.
Let thou and I the ^attell try,
and let our men abide:
Accursed be he Lord Piercy said,
by whom it is denied:
Then stepped a gallant Squire forth,
Wi^heringon was his name,
Who said I would not have it told
to Henry our King for shame,
That ere my Captains fought on foot,
and I stood looking on,
You two be Earls quoth Witherington
and I a Squire alone:
I Will do the best that do I may,
while I have power to stand,
While I have power to weild my sword
I Will fight with heart and hand.
Our English Archer^ bent their bows,
their hearts wars good and true,
At the first flight of Arrows sent,
full four score ^cots they slew,
To drive the Deer with hound and horn,
Dowgals bad on the bent,
A Captain moved with mickle pride,
the Spears to shivers went.
They clo^^d full fast on every side,
no slacknesse there was found,
And many a gallant Gentleman
lay gasping on the ground:
O Christ, it was a grief to see,
and likewise for to hear
The cries of men lying in their gore,
and scattered here and there.
At last these two stout Earls did meet,
like Captains of great might,
Like Lyns moved they laid on load,
and made a cruel fight;
They fought until they both did sweat
with swords of tempered steel,
Vntll the blood like drops of rain,
they trickling down did feel.
Yield thee Lord Piercy, Douglas said,
in faith I will thee bring,
Where thou shall high advanced be
by James our Scottish King;
Thy ramson will I freely give,
and thus report of thee,
Thou art the most courageous Knight
as ever I did see.
No Dow^^^s ^^^th Earl Piercy then
thy proffers I do (...)
I will not yield to any Scot
that ever yet was borne:
With tha^ there came an Arrow keen,
ou^ of an England Bow,
And st^uck Earl Douglas to the heart,
a deep end deadly blow.
Who never spak more words then these
fight on my merry man all,
For why my life is at an end,
Earle^ Piercy sees my fall:
Then leaving life, Earl Piercy took,
the dead man by the hand,
And said Earl Douglas for thy life
would I had lost my Land.
O Christ my very heart does bleed,
with sorrow for thy sake,
For sure a more redoubted Knight
mischance did never take.
A Knight among the Scots there was
which said Earl Douglas dye,
Who strait in wrath did vow reveng
upon the Earl Piercy.
The Second Part,
to the same Tune.
SIr Hugh Montgomery was he called,
who with a Spear full bright,
Well mounted on a gallant Steed,
ran fiercely through the fight.
And past the English Archers all,
wi^^^ut all dread or fear
And through Earl Pierc^^ body then
he thrust his hateful Spear,
With such a vehement force and might
his body he did gore,
The staff came through the other side
a large cloth-yard and more:
Thus did both these stout Nobles dye,
whoes courage none could stain,
An English Archer then perceived
the Noble Earl was slain:
He had ^ood Bow in his hand,
made of a trusty Tree,
An Arrow of a cloth-yard long
unto the head drew he:
Against Sir Hugh Montgomery,
so right his shaft he set
The Grey-goose wing that was thereon
in his heart blood was wet.
The fight did last from break of day,
till setting of the Sun,
For when they rung the Evening bell
the battle scarce was done.
With stout Earl Piercy there was slain
Sir John of Ogerton,
Sir Robert Ratcliffe and Sir John,
Sir James that bold Baron.
And with Sir George and good sir James,
both Knights of good account,
Good Sir Ralph Rabby there was slain,
W^ose prowess did surmount:
For Witherington needs must I wa^le,
as one in doleful dumps,
For when his legs were smitten off,
he fought upon his stumps.
And with Earl Douglas there was slain
Sir Hugh Montgomery,
Sir Charles Morrell, that from the field
one foot would never fly:
Sir Charles Morrell of Harcliffe too,
his Sisters son was he
Sir David Lamb, so well esteemed,
but saved he could not be,
And the Lord Markwell in like case,
did with Earl Douglas dye
Of twenty hundred Scottish Spears,
scarce fifty five did fly:
Of fifteen hundred Englishmen,
went home but fifty three,
The rest were slain in Chevie-Chase,
under the green-wood Tree.
Next day did many widows come,
their husband to bewail,
They washed their wounds with brinish tears,
but all could not prevail:
Their bodies bathed in purple blood,
they b^re with them away,
They kissed them dead a thousand times,
ere they were clad in clay.
This news was brought to Edenburg,
where ^cotlands King did reign
that brave Earl Douglas suddenly
was with an Arrow slain:
O heavy news King James did say,
Scotland can witness be,
I have not any Captain more,
of such account as be.
Like tidings to King Henry came,
within as s^ort a space,
That Piercy of Northumberland
was slain in Chevie-Chase:
Now God be with him, said our King,
since 'twill no better be
I trust I have within my Realm
side hundred as good as he.
Yet shall not Scots nor Scotland say,
but I will vengeance take,
And be ^ev^nged on them all
for brave E^rl^ Piercie'^ sake:
This vow theKing did well perform,
after on H^mb^e Down
In one day fifty Knights were slain,
with Lords of high renown.
And of the rest of small account,
did many hundred dye,
Thus ended the Hun^ing in Chevie-Chase
made by the Lord Piercy.
God save the King and bless this Land
with Pleasure Joy and Peace,
and grant henceforth that ^ll debate
'twixt Noblemen may cease.
FINIS.
