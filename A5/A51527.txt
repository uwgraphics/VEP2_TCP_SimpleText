The Mourning Conquest. Or, The Woman's sad Complaint, and dolesul Cry.
To see her Love in Fainting fits to lie.

The Tune is, A loving Husband will not be unto his Wife unkind.
Alas poor thing.



AS I did walk abroad one time,
I chanced for to see,
a Young man and a Maid, but
they did not know of me;
She being in the vain then,
chuckt him under the chin,
And smiling in his face, she said,
alas poor thing.
The Young Man very bashful was
but had a good intent,
He loved the Maid with all his heart
but knew not what she meant,
And much a do she had, poor heart,
this Young man for to bring,
Unto her bow, which made her cry,
alas poor thing!
She by his loving Complements,
did understand and find,
That she might safely let him know
and understand her mind:
Pretending for to stumble,
on the ground herself did fling,
And said, Sweetheart I fell by chance
alas poor thing!
The young man standing all amazed
for a little space,
And finding opertunity,
and a conveniant place,
Under a shady-Bower,
close by a pleasant Spring;
Upon the Maid himselfhe he throws,
alas poor thins,
I could not choose but laugh to see
these two so close employed,
The young man was contented, and
the Maid was over joy'd,
Expressing of her love, she
did closely to him cling,
But finding him begin to fall,
alas poor thing.


IT was not long before this young man
was tired with this sport,
He said him down to rest a while,
he took his brenth full short:
She turned about, and kiss him, and
did closely to him cling.
Sweetheart (quoth she) how do thou (now,
alas poor thing!
But finding him in fainting fits, (joints
she then began to weep,
And with her hands she rubbed his
to keep this Youth from sleep;
Quoth she, sweetheart, thy weakness (makes
my very heart to sting:
Come ^ye, for shame rouse up thy self
alas poor thing!
And coming to himself again,
his face looked wondrous wan,
Wishing he were as strong, as when
he first with her began:
And in a ^age he swore, he thought
no Woman t're could bring,
A man so weak, which made him cry
alas poor thing!
Quoth she, sweetheart, the Soldier
does venture in the (...)
Although at first (...)
the day they ^ (...)
But face about, and Charge again,
and take the other fling:
I Will do my best to second thee,
alas poor thing!
Poor heart, she did what in her lay,
this Young-mans heart to cheer;
By kissing him, and calling him,
her Honey, and her Dear,
But finding of his Courage,
so sadly for to hing,
Down she fell again, and cried,
alas poor thing!
The youngman hearing of her moan
his credit for to gain,
Resolving for to try his strength,
but all was spent in vain:
And troubling of his love-slain mind
he like a Logg did cling,
Which made her kick him off, ^ cry,
alas poor thing!
So to conclude, I saw this youth,
most farely beat in field:
The stoutest heart that ever drew,
is sometimes forced to yield,
And so put up his Blade again,
London, (...)
