TWELVE Considerable Serious Questions touching CHVRCH GOVERNMENT. Sadly
propounded (out of a Real Desire of Unity, and Tranquillity in Church and
State) to all Sober-minded Christians, Cordially affecting a speedy settled
Reformation, and Brotherly Christian Union in all our Churches and Dominions,
now miserably wasted with Civil Unnatural Wars, and deplorably lacerated
with Ecclesiastical Dissentions.

By William Prynne, of Lincolnes Inn, Esquire.

1 Cor. 1.10. Now I beseeech you Brethren by the Name of Our Lord Jesus Christ,
that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you:
but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same
judgment.

1 Cor. 3.3, 4. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you
envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?

For while one says, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollo, are ye not
carnal?

1 Cor. 14, 33. God is not the Author of unquietness, but of peace, as in all
Churches of the Saints.

HAving neither Leisure nor Opportunity to debate the late unhappy differences
sprung up amongst us touching Church Government (disputed at large by Master
Herle, Doctor Steward Master Rotherford, Master Edwards, Master Durey, Master
Goodwin, Master Nigh, Master Sympson, and others,) which much retard the speedy
accomplishment, and establishment of that happy Reformation, we all earnestly
pray for, and at least pretend Cordially to desire, I have (at the importunity
of some Reverend Friends,) digested my subitane apprehensions of these
distracting Controversies, into the ensuing considerable Questions, which sadly
pondered, and solidly debated by sober-minded peaceably disposed men of greater
Ability and Vacancy for such a work, then I enjoy, may put a happy period to
all our dissentions about th^s subject, and heartily unite our divided
Judgments, Affections, the better to secure our selves against the common
Enemies, who prevail most by our divisions.

1. Whether the Gospel being by Christ's own Injunction, to be Matthew. 28.19,
20. Mar. 16.15. Romans 10.18. Col. 1 5.6.23. Ephesians. 3.5. to 12.
preached to all Nations and people whatsoever, (who have their several
established different forms of Civil Government, Laws, Manners, Rules, and
Customs, suitable to their respective dispositions, climes, republikes,) it can
be infallibly evidenced by any Gospel Text, That Christ has peremptorily
prescribed one and the self same form of Ecclesiastical Government,
discipline, Rites to all Nations, Churches in all particulars from which they
may in no case vary, under pain of mortal sin, Scisme, or being no true
Churches of Christ, with whom good Christians may not safely communicate? Or
(rather) whether every several Nation, republike and National Church has not
under the Gospel 1 Cor. 14.40. c. 11.34.
a Liberty, and latitude left them to choose and settle such an orderly form of
Church Government, discipline, and Ecclesiastical Rites, as is most suitable
to their particular Civil Government, Laws Manners, Customs: always
provided it be consonant and no ways repugnant to the Word of God, nor
prejudicial to his sincere Worship, or the peoples salvation, nor such as
hinders their Christian Communion, amity, Charity among themselves and with
other true Christian Churches? This being (as I conceive) a generally received
truth among all See the Harmony of Confessions Section 10, 11 16.
Protestant Churches; the very substance of the 34. Article of the Church of
England; of the 77. Article of the Church of Ireland, and of the Statutes of 2.
and 3. E. 6. c. 1.3. and 4. E. 6. c. 10.5. and 6. E. 6. c. 1.1. Eliz. c. 2.8.
Eliz. c. 1. And whether some things in all Church Governments, Disciplines,
Ceremonies whatsoever, are not and must not be left to humane prudence, for
which there is no direct precept nor pattern in sacred Writ? Which truth is
assented to by all parties, Churches whatsoever, in theory or practice.

2. Whether, if any Kingdom or Nation shall by a National Council, Synod and
Parliament, upon serious debate, Elect such a public Church Government, Rites,
discipline as they conceive to be most Consonant to Gods Word, to the Laws,
Government under which they live, and manners of their people, and then settle
them by a general law; all particular Churches Members of that Kingdom and
Nation, be not thereby actually obliged in point of 1 Cor. 14.32.33. Romans
13.1.2. 1 Pet 2 13, 14, 15. 1 Cor. 10.32.33.
Conscience and Christianity, readily to submit thereto, and no ways to seek
an exemption from it, under pain of being guilty of Arrogancy Scisme,
Contumacie, and liable to such penalties as are due to these offenses?

3. Whether that form of Ecclesiastical Government, which has sufficient
(if not best) warrant for it in the New Testament: the examples of the
Primitive Church, of the best reformed Churches in this latter age to back it;
the resolutions of the most eminent persons for Learning and Piety in all
Protestant Churches, approving it, tends most to effect, establish Christian 1
Cor. 12.12. to 29. c. 14.33. c. 1.10. to 15. c. 11.16. Ephesians. 4.3. to 17 Romans
15.56. Ia. 3.14.15, 16^ 17, 18. Phil. 2.1.2, 3. 1 Cor. 3.3.4.
Unity, Peace and Amity, in the Churches, Nations, Kingdoms embracing it, and
with foreign Churches professing the same Religion; suites best with the
public civil Government, Laws, Manners of those Realms who receive it, and
serves most effectually to prevent, suppress all Heresies, Errors, Scismes,
Factions, diversities of opinions, corruptions of manners Libertinisme,
Injustice, with other inconveniences which may infest a Church or State; is
not to be chosen, rec^ived as a true undoubted Church-Governement, agreeable to
the Gospel of Christ, and to be preferred before that Ecclesiastical
Government, which has no such express ^arrant for it in Scripture, no
pattern for it in the Primitive, or best reformed ^^urches, no general
approbation of the most eminent persons for Learning and Piety in all
Protestant Churches, asserting it; tendes not to effect maintain or establish
Christian Unity, Peace, Amity in the Churches, Nations, Kingdoms embracing
it: suits not with their established civil Laws, Go^ernment, and is no
effectual means to prevent or suppress, but rather to intro^^ce and foment
all Heresies, Errors, Scismes, Factions, diversities of opinions, corruptions
of manners, Libertinisme, Injustice (for want of Appeals) and other
inconveniences, which may infest a Church or State?

4. Whether the Presbiteriall form of Church Government, if rightly ordered,
be not such as is expressed in the former: the Independent such as is mentioned
in the latter part of the preceding question? and therefore the first of them
rather to be embraced then the last, without any long debate?

5. Whether the grounds and reasons principally in^isted on for an Independ^nt
Church Government, be not such as if duly examined, will by unevitable
necessary consequence subvert, dissolve, at least imbroyle, endanger all
National, Provincial Churches, Councels, Synods, all settled Monarchical,
Aristocraticall, or Oligarchicall forms of civil Government in Nations,
Republikes, States, Cities; reduce all Ecclesiastical, all Civil public
kinds of Government, to that which is merely Parochial or Domestical, and
make every small Congregation, Family, (yea person if possible) an Independent
Church and Republike, exempt from all other public Laws, or Rules of civil
and Ecclesiastical Government, but what they shall freely elect; prescribe
unto themselves, during pleasure and alter as they see occasion, upon more
light of truth revealed?

6. Whether in all Nations Ages, from the first preaching of the Gospel till
this present as Christians and believers multiplied, particular Churches, did
not likewise multiply, which had a dependency on, and communion one with
another, and were all subordinate to National or Provincial Synods, and
public Ecclesiastical constitutions? And whether any one example of such a
particular Independent Congregationall Church or Government, as some now
strennuously contend for, (or any one eminent Writer who maintained the same)
can be produced in any Christian Nation, Kingdom or Republike, totally
converted to Christianity, since Christ's time, till within our memories? If
yea; then let the Independents nominate the place, age, Author, if they can. If
not: then doubtless that can be no Church Government of Christ's or his
Apostles Institution, which had never yet any being, nor approbation in the
world, till this present age, for ought that can be proved.

7. Whether the selfsame Law of Nature, God, and rule of rectified reason,
which instructed, warranted all persons, Nations, as they multiplied, from
private families to unite themselves into several Villages, Gen 4 17. c. 10.
and 11 and 14. Arist. pol. lib. 1. c. 1.2. etc.
Cities, Kingdoms, Republikes, and to subject themselves to some one or other
public form of Civil Government, and such general Laws, (obliging all
persons, societies of men alike) which they conceived most useful, necessary
for their common safety, and prosperity; did not heretofore, and now likewise
teach persuade and instruct all men to use the selfsame form of proceeding in
matters of Church Government, as the number of Christians, Churches multiplied,
or shall yet increase among them? Since all Nations whatsoever upon their
conversion to Christianity have proceeded in this Method, as all
Ecclesiastical Histories and the Acts of Councels testify? For example, first
one person (or more) in a Nation was converted to the Faith of Christ; who
converted his Family, and so perchance for a time had a private Romans 16 15 1
Cor. 16.19 Acts 11.19. to 25 and 13.14 and 16. and 17. and 18 c. 28.30, 31.
Church in his own house; This Family after converted other persons, families
by degrees, who united themselves into a Congregationall or Parish Church;
after which the Christians multiplying, and their Princes, Magistrates, Nations
embracing the Christian Religion, they divided themselves into many Parochial
Churches, Diocese, Provinces; none of which Parochial Churches, when
multiplied and the whole Nation converted, either were or claimed to be
independent but were ever subordinate to See Binius, Surius, Crab, Merlin,

Common Council of Presbyters, and governed by general Laws or constitutions,
to which they still submitted: just like our new Chappells and Churches lately
built about London and other places which are not Independent, but subordinate
to the Ecclesiastical Laws and public settled Government of our National
Church. A course observed in all Religions, Nations in the world since Adams
time till now, for ought appears to me.

And why this order, dictated by God, nature, and constantly pursued in all
Nations converted to Christian Religion, should not be perpetually observed,
but Independent Congregations gathered; not of Infidels, but of men already
converted to and settled in the Christian faith, of which form of congregating
Churches, no one example, (unless derived from the private Conventicles of
Arrians, Donatists, and other Heretics, who yet were not Independent amongst
themselves) nor any direct Scripture, Reason, or Authority can be produced, to
satisfy Conscience, for ought ever I could yet discern, nor yet for
particular Church Covenants, (to which all Members must subscribe before
admission into Independent Churches) I can yet see no ground.

8. Whether the concession of one Catholic Church throughout the world, denied
by none: the Exo. 23.17 c. 34.23, ^4. c. 35.1. Deu. ^6.15, 17. c. ^1 1. Lev.

Ezra. 31. c 10 1 etc Neh. 8.1.10.18. Luke 1.41.
National Assembly, and Church of the Israelites under the Law, (who had yet
their distinct Synagogues and Parochial Assemblies) Instituted, approved by
God himself; the Synodall Assembly of the Apostles, Elders, and Brethren at
Jerusalem, Acts 15. who Acts 15.22 to 32. c. 16 14. c. 21.25.
made and sent binding De^rees to the Churches of the Gentiles in Antioch,
Syria, Cylicia, and other Churches; compared with the several general ^ Cor.
7.17 c. 11.6. c. 4.^3. c. 16.1.2. Gal. 1.1. See Rev. 1.11.20. c. 2.7. c. 22.1^.
Injunctions of Paul in his Epistles to Timothy, Titus, the Corinthians, and
other Churches he wrote to, touching Church discipline, Order, Government;
seconded with all Oecumenicall, National, Provincial, Counsels, Synods, and
the Church Government exercised throughout the world, in all Christian Realms,
States, from their first general reception of the Gospel till this present;
compared with Acts 7.38. c. 2.47. c. 5.11. c. 8.1.3. c. 12.5. c. 15.22. c.
20.28. Math. 16.18. Ephesians. 3.10.21. c. 5.25.27.29.32. Col. 1 18.24. 1 Timothy
3.5.15. Be not an infallible proof and Justification of National Churches; of
a common Presbyterian, Classical government, to which particular
Congregations, Persons ought to be subordinate, and an apparent subversion of
the Novell Independent Invention? Whether all answers ^iven to these examples
and Texts, by Independents be not, when duly scanned, mere palpable shifts or
evasions which can neither satisfy the Consciences or Judgments of any
intelligent Christians? And whether their argument from these phrases Acts
9.31. c. 15.4^. c. 16 5 Romans 16.4^ 16. ^ Cor 7.17. c. 11, 16^ c. 1^.33, 34. c.

the Churches, the Churches of Christ, of Asia, Macedonia; all Churches, etc.
in the plural number (meant only of the Churches then planted in several
Cities, Provinces, Regions, Nations, under distinct civil Governments,
comprised in Scripture under this aggregate Title the Church, often times, and
then equivalent to National Churches derived out of them as the Gospel, and
believers of it multiplied) be any more or better proof of particular
Independent Churches in one and the self same City, Nation, Kingdom,
Republique; Then Historians, Counsels, and Canons mentioning of the Churches
of England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, France, Spain, or the Churches within
the Province of Canterbury, York, or Diocese of London, etc. argue, all or
any of their Parish Churches to be Independent, not one Parochial Church in
all these Realms being yet independent, but always subordinate to the whole
National or Provincial Churches, Councels, Parliaments, Synods of these
Kingdoms, as all Authors and experience witness.

9. Whether the Independents challenge of the Presbyterians to show them any
National Church, Profes^ing Christ in our Saviors or the Apostles days,
before any one Nation totally converted to the Christian faith, or any general
open profession made of it by the Princes, Majestrates and Major part of any
Nation, Kingdom, Republique, who were then all generally Pagans and
Persecutors of the Gospel, not then universally embraced, be not a most
irrational unjust demand? And whether this Argument from thence.

There was no National Church professing Christian Religion in the Apostles
days (before any Nation totally converted to Christianity.)

Ergo, there ought to be no such National Church now; though the Isay 2 2 3.
Mic 4.1. to 5. Ps. 72.17. Ps, 82.8. Psalm. 86.9. Ier. 16.19 Mal. 1.1^. Isa.
11.9. to 16 c. 9.12.23. c. 54.1.2, 3. c. 60.3. to 22. Zach. 8.22.
Prophets long before assured us; and Lu. 2.32. Mar. 13.10. Act. 1^.46.47.48.
Ro^. 10.18.20. ^ 1.12. etc.
Christ with his Apostles certainly knew and predicted there should be
National convertions, Churches after their days.

Be not as absurd an Argument as these ensuing.

There was no Nation wholly converted to the ^aith, nor any Church-meetings of
Christians in public Churches, but only in Romans 16.5. 1 Cor. 16.19. Col. 4
15. Philem. 2.23. Heb. 11.37.38. Acts 20.7.8. Acts 1.13.14. I^h. 20 19.
private Families, Caves, Corners in the Apostles days.

Ergo, no Nations ought to be totally converted to the faith, nor any
Christians to meet in public Churches, but only in private Families, Caves,
Corners now; as they did then.

There was no Nation, Kingdom, City, Republique, Catholic, Congregationall,
or Parochial Church in Adams younger days, before people were multiplied, but
only a family Government, and Church.

Ergo, there ought to be none but an Oeconomicall or Family Government, and
Church, but no Nation, Kingdom, City, Republike, Catholic, or Parish Church
now. No man will be so void of sense or reason to argue thus.

Every man in his Infancy is borne destitute of Religion, of the use of speech,
reason, understanding, faith, legs, etc.

Ergo, he ought to continue so when he is grown a man.

Yet this is the maine Argument of some Independents.

The Christian Church in the Apostles times, whiles she was in her very
Infancy, and under persecution, was not National, but so and so, (yet never
Independent.)

Ergo, she must not now be National, but still necessarily continue in, and be
reduced to her primitive infant condition, and to an Independent Government.

When as the very History of the Acts, and Paul's Epistles clearly inform us,
that as the number of Christians multiplied, so their Gal. 1.1. Acts 9.31. c.
15.41. c. 16.5. Romans 16 4.16. 1 Cor 7.17. r. 11.16. c. 14.33. c. 16.19. 2 Co^.
1.18.19.23.24.11.28, 2 These. 1 Rev. 1.^1.20 c. 22.16.
Churches, Church Officers multiplied, their Church government, Discipline
varied. At first the Christian Church had none but Apostles to preach and
instruct the people; but when believers multiplied, then they and the Apostles
ordained Acts 6.1. to 8. 1 Timothy 3.8.
Deacons: after that Act 11.30. c. 15.2.4. Phil. 1.1. Tit. 1.5. 1 Timothy 3. c^ to
6. c. 5.17. Iam. 5.14. 1 Pet. 5.1.2. 1 Cor. 1^.28.29. Ephesians. 4.21.12, 13. 1 Timothy
5.3.9.10. 2 Pet. 1.20.21.
Elders, Evangelicall Bishops, Widows, with other Church Officers. And then
fell, not only to write new Gospells, Epistles, Canonical Scriptures, and
rules of faith, (as appears by the whole New Testament) for the Churches
further instruction, Edification, direction, by the special guidance of 2 Timothy
3.16.2.
Gods spirit: but also to prescribe new necessary 1 Cor. c. 1 and 3. and 4. and
5. and 6 c. 11.34. and 7. and 8. and 9. and 10.11. and 12. and 14. and 16. etc.
1. (...) 2 Epist. to Tim. Tit c. 1. and 2. 1 Cor 7.17 c. 3.4.3.
Rules, Canons, directions, with sundry matters of Order, Discipline, as new
occasions were Offered, which liberty of ordaining, supplying, instituting new
Rites, Orders, Canons, things necessary or expedient for the Churches peace and
welfare, they transmitted to posterity; and all Churches of Christ in all ages,
places, yea the Independents themselves, have claimed and exercised this very
liberty, as their right; there being many things in their independent
Government, which have no express warrant nor example in sacred wit to
justify them.

10. Whether Independents can produce any one solid reason, why they ought not
(in Point of Conscience) willingly to submit to a Presbyteriall Government in
case it shall be established among us by the general consent of the Synod, and
Parliament, as most consonant to Gods word, the Laws and Government, of our
Realm? and if not, whether it will not be justly reputed an high degree of
Obstinacy, Singularity, Arrogance, Selfe-ends, and peremptory Schism in them
to oppose this form of Government, or demand a special exemption from it,
for themselves alone? when as Papists, Anabaptists and all other Sects may
claim the like exemption, upon the like grounds as they allege?

11. Whether that Independent Government which some contend for, if positively
and fully agreed on, and laid down without disguises, and then duly pondered
in the balance of scripture or right reason, be not of its own nature, a very
Seminary of Schisms, and dangerous divisions in Church, state? a floud-Gate to
let in an inundation of all manner of Heresies, Errors, Sects, Religions,
distructive opinions, Libertinisme and lawlesnesse among us, without any
sufficient means of preventing or suppressing them when introduced? Whether
the final result of it (as Master Williams in his late dangerous A Bloody
Tenent.
Licentious Book determines) will not really resolve it self into this
detestable conclusion. That every man, whither he be Jew, Turk, Pagan, Papist,
Arminian, Anabaptist, etc. ought to be left to his own free liberty of
co^scienc, without any coertion or restraint, to embrace and publicly to
profess what Religion, Opinion, Church, Government he pleases, and conceives
to be truest, though never so erroneous, false seditous, detestable in it self?

And whither such a Government as this ought to be embraced much less
established among us (the sad effects whereof we have already experimentally
felt, by the late dangerous increase of many Anabaptisticall, Antinomian,
Heretical, Atheistical opinions, as of the souls mortality divorce at
pleasure, etc. lately Broached, Preached, Printed in this famous City, which I
hope Our grand Council will speedily and carefully suppress, and by our
devisions between some of our Commanders refusing to be dependent or
subordinat one to another,) I refer to the judgment of all such who have any
sparks of love to God, Religion, their bleeding dying distracted native
Country flaming in their breasts, or any remainder of right reason residing in
their brains.

12. Whether the very title of Independency be not altogether improper for any
man or Christian, as such, who is naturally as a man, spiritually as a
Christian, Genesis 2.18. c 9.17. c. 10.11. r. 4. Arist. Polit. l. 1. and ^.
^sociable 1 Cor. 12.10 31. Acts 10.5. to 48 c. 11.21. 22, 26, c. 15.1. to 37.
1 Cor. 16 1, 32,. 2 Cor. 2.11.11. 2 Cor. 11.28. 15. Acts 19.9.10 c. 11.21.22.
dependent creature needing both the Communion, and assistance of other
persons, Nations, Churches? Whether the National League and Covenant we have
taken does not in sundry respects strongly engage us against Independency? and
whether the root from which it originally springs (if really searched to the
very bottom and stripped of all disguised pretenses) be not a Pharesaical Romans
10.14. Isay. 65.5. Lu. 18.10. to 19. Pro. 30.12. Math. 7.1.
dangerous spiritual Pride, vainglorious Singularity, or selfe-conceitednes of
men's own superlative holiness (as they deem it) which makes them, contrary to
the Apostles rule Ph^l. ^.3.
to est^^^^ others better then themselves: to deem themselves so transendently
holy, sanctified, and Religious above others, that they esteem them altogether
unworthy of yea wholly exclude them from their Communion and Church-society, as
Lu. 18.10.11.12. Math. 18.17.
Publicans, Hethens, or profane persons (though perchance as good, or better
Christians then themselves) unless they will submitt to their
Church-covenants, and Government, refusing all true brotherly familiarity,
society with them, and passing often times most uncharitable censures on their
very hearts and spiritual estates (of which God never made them Judges and
Math. 7.1. Romans 2.1. r. 14.10.
Forbids them for to judge, because he 2 Chronicles. 6, 30, 17.9.10.
only knows men's hearts: Which has lately engendered an extraordinary
strangnes unsociablenesse and coldness of brotherly affection, if not great
disunion, disaffection, and many dissentions among Professors themselves, yea,
carelessness and neglect of one another wel^^^^^^ Our mutual Christian
dependency on and Relations one to another as Christian Brethren. As members of
the selfsame state and visible Church of Christ, Acts 2.44, 45, 46. 1 Cor
12.12 to 26. c. 16 ^, ^.2. Cor 8. Ephesians. 4, 3, 4, 5, 6^ c. ^^ 25, to 23. 1 Timothy
5, 8, 2. Cor 11, 21. c. 12, 14.
being the strongest bond of unity, of brotherly love, care, relief, and
mutual assistance in all times of need: it being the common (...) and
natural disposition of all men, to Judges ^ 28. Luk 9^ 53, 5^ (...) 8, (...)
disrespect, neglect the relief, assistance ^^re and protection of those who
are independent on them, or have no relations to them, no communion with them,
and whom they esteem as strangers, with whom they neither have nor think fit
to have any brotherly Church-society; Whence those of different Churches, or
contrary religions (as Christians, Turks, Papists, Protestants, etc.) are
always for the most part at variance, enmity, seldom or never friendly,
brotherly, charitable or assistant one to another. Since then this
New-Invention of Independency, is apt to produce snch uncharitablenes,
unsociablenesse, strangeness, differences, coldness of brotherly love, care,
relief, and mutual assistance, even among Christians who profess themselves
true Saints of God; and tends apparently to the violation of these Principal
John 13.34, 35. 1 John 4.21. c 3.14, 18, 19^ 1 These. 4.9 1 Pet. 1.2^^ c ^^17.
precepts of the Gospel, and chiefest badges of Christianity, by which we know
we are of the truth, that we are Christ's Disciples indeed; translated from life
to death, and may assure our hearts hereof; namely; to love one another: to
love all the Saints and Brethren unfeinedly, not in word and in tongue, but
indeed and in truth, with a pure heart fervently: Ephesians. 5, 2. c 4.^ to 7. Col.
3.12, 3, 14, 15.
to walk in love as Christ loved us: to put on as the elect of God (holy and
beloved) bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness,
long-suffering: to be kind and tender hearted one toward another: and above
all things to put on Charity which is the bond of perfectness; endeavoring to
keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace, to which we are called in
one body; there being, (and we all having) but one body, one spirit, one hope
of our calling, one Lord, one faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of all,
who is above all, and thorough all, and over us all; I humbly refer it to the
serious consideration of all pious and peaceable Christians, whether it can be
any Church Government of Christ's invention, approbation, or institution fit to
be embraced in any Christian Realm: wherein we should with Rom 15.5 6. 1 Cor.
1.12
one mind and one mouth glorify God; and all speak the same thing without
any divisions among us, being perfectly joined together in the same mind, and
in the same judgment. This Gods own precept; and it shall be my daily prayer,
it may now prove all our real practice. I shall close up all with this
exhortation of the Apostle, necessary for our distracted times; Phil. 2.1.2, 3,
4.
If there be any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any
fellowship of the spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill ye my joy, that
you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord and of one mind,
Let nothing be done (henceforth as to much I fear has formerly bin) through
strife or vain glory; but in lowlines of mind, let each esteem of others better
then himself: Look not every man on (or after) his own things, but every man
also on the things of others; Romans 6.17. c. 14.19. c. 12.16. Ephesians 4.31 c. 5.3.
And I beseech you Brethren mark them which cause divisions and offenses,
contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them; Follow after
the things which make for peace, and such things only wherewith one may edefie
another; laying aside all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and
evil speaking, with all malice, covetousness, pride, and self seeking: which
duly practiced will speedily reconcile and terminate all our differences,
eternally unite us in a lasting bond of real Unity and brotherly love against
our. Common enemies; who endeavor to ruin^^s by our unnatural sad divisions.

FINIS.
